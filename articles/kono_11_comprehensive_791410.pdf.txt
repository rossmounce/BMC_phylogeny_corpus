Comprehensive prediction of chromosome dimer
resolution sites in bacterial genomes
Nobuaki Kono1,2, Kazuharu Arakawa2*, Masaru Tomita2,3

Abstract
Background: During the replication process of bacteria with circular chromosomes, an odd number of
homologous recombination events results in concatenated dimer chromosomes that cannot be partitioned into
daughter cells. However, many bacteria harbor a conserved dimer resolution machinery consisting of one or two
tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and their 28-bp target site, dif.
Results: To study the evolution of the dif/XerCD system and its relationship with replication termination, we report
the comprehensive prediction of dif sequences in silico using a phylogenetic prediction approach based on
iterated hidden Markov modeling. Using this method, dif sites were identified in 641 organisms among 16 phyla,
with a 97.64% identification rate for single-chromosome strains. The dif sequence positions were shown to be
strongly correlated with the GC skew shift-point that is induced by replicational mutation/selection pressures, but
the difference in the positions of the predicted dif sites and the GC skew shift-points did not correlate with the
degree of replicational mutation/selection pressures.
Conclusions: The sequence of dif sites is widely conserved among many bacterial phyla, and they can be
computationally identified using our method. The lack of correlation between dif position and the degree of GC
skew suggests that replication termination does not occur strictly at dif sites.

Background
In bacteria, replication fork arrest is mainly repaired by
homologous recombination [1]. When such a recombination event occurs an odd number of times in one
DNA replication event of circular chromosomes, the
replicated chromosome is not properly segregated into
two daughter chromosomes but instead produces a concatenated dimer [2,3]. Therefore, many bacteria harbor
highly conserved chromosome dimer resolution (CDR)
machinery to separate the dimer chromosome into two
monomer daughter chromosomes.
In Escherichia coli, chromosome dimers are resolved
by two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, by the
addition of a crossover at a specific 28-bp sequence
called the dif site, which is located in the replication termination region of the chromosome [4,5]. The dif
sequence contains a pair of palindromic sequence motifs
that correspond to the binding domains of XerC and

XerD. The reaction is coordinated to the last stages of
cell division by an essential cell division protein, FtsK,
which functions as a septum-located DNA translocase
[6-10]. FtsK moves along the chromosome unidirectionally towards the dif sequence, thanks to polar and orientated sequences, the KOPS [11-13]. CDR is initiated
when FtsK reaches dif and its extreme C-terminal
domain directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of
XerD [14-18]. The dif/XerCD chromosome dimer resolution system seems widely conserved. In vivo experimental evidence for its conservation has been obtained
in Xanthomonas campestris, Caulobacter crescentus and
Vibrio cholerae [19-21]. In vitro characterization of Xer
recombinases and dif sites has also been carried in
Haemophilus influenzae and Bacillus subtilis [22,23].
However, the importance of dif/XerCD for the fitness of
bacteria has only been demonstrated in E. coli and
V. cholerae [20,24]. In some other bacteria, like Lactococci and Streptococci, chromosome dimer resolution is
resolved by single tyrosine recombinases that act at specific dif site [25,26]. In this case, dimer resolution still
depends on FtsK and dif is still located opposite the

origin of replication between oriented polar sequences
[27]. Several filamentous phages are known to hijack
this site-specific recombination machinery of dif/XerCD
for their integration into the host chromosome, containing pseudo-dif sequences within these phage genomes
[28-34]. However, the dif sequence remains intact during such recombination process to ensure the integrity
of chromosome dimer resolution machinery [35,36].
The dif-like sequences in phages often contain more
variable central region that is longer than the canonical
6 bp [31,33,34], and the XerD binding arm is considerably degenerate [28].
Because there is only one origin of replication on bacterial circular chromosomes, replication generally terminates in a specific region of the chromosome. This can
be followed by the existence of a GC skew on the two
replichore arms of the chromosomes with a shift-point
opposite the origin of replication [37]. Based on the
observation that dif sites are generally located at or near
the GC skew shift-point, Hendrickson and Lawrence
proposed that replication might generally terminate at
dif, which coordinate replication and chromosome
dimer resolution [38]. In E. coli, the replication process
usually terminates at a narrow region that includes
approximately 5% of the genome length and is located
directly opposite the replication origin [39-41]. This is
partly due to the existence of the Tus/Ter replication
fork trap [41]. dif is located within the replication fork
trap but termination occurs precisely at the Tus site,
not at dif [42] and dif is active when displaced outside
of the replication termination region if it is still within
the zone where KOPS converge [24]. Nevertheless, the
lack of universal conservation of the Tus protein may
suggest that replication terminated at dif sites until the
relatively recent takeover by the Tus-Ter system [43].
We reasoned therefore that the comprehensive identification of dif sites and of their location with respect to
the GC skew shift-point in hundreds of complete genomes might provide clues to the evolution of the CDR
machinery and its possible link with the replication termination mechanism in bacterial species.
Prediction of the dif sequences has been reported by
several groups with different approaches. Hendrickson
and Lawrence showed that sequence skew can be used
to predict the location of dif sites, and they identified
putative dif sequences in 25 bacteria based on
sequence similarity [38]. Le Bourgeois and colleagues
reported a new type of tyrosine recombinase, named
XerS, which is responsible for CDR in Streptococci and
Lactococci and this recombinase targets a 31-bp
sequence element named dif SL [25]. For comparison,
they predicted dif sequences in 22 Firmicutes based on
their similarity to that of B. subtilis with Megablast
[44] and on the fact that the dif sequence occurs only

Page 2 of 14

once per genome. Val and colleagues identified that V.
cholerae chromosome II, whose many features are
plasmid-like, has an original dif sequence independently, and therefore it has FtsK-dependent CDR [20].
For this purpose, they predicted dif sequences in five
a-Proteobacteria and ten b-Proteobacteria that harbour
multiple chromosomes, and discussed a conserved
FtsK-dependent CDR on multiple chromosomes based
on the close relative distance of the position of dif
sequences and the GC skew shift-points. Their prediction method is based on a HMMER [45] score (<1.0e05) with a profile built from 27 aligned dif sequences
in the largest chromosomes of g-Proteobacteria species,
with manual checking for 6-bp spacing between two
XerC and XerD binding motifs.
Carnoy and Roten reported the most comprehensive
predictions to date, identifying putative dif sequences in
204 chromosomes in 137 Proteobacteria strains, discussing the high conservation of dif/XerCD systems and the
possible loss of dif sequences in endosymbionts, with
suggestions for other CDR mechanisms [46]. Here, the
prediction was based on BLAST searches and YASS
alignment [47] with the dif sequences of E. coli and B.
subtilis, and candidates were selected based on their
proximity to the GC skew shift-points and a single
occurrence per chromosome. Previous predictions were
therefore limited to three bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria,
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.
To this end, we describe comprehensive predictions
for dif sequences based on a machine learning approach,
tracing the phylogenetic conservation patterns of XerCD
recombinases and using an iterative hidden Markov
modeling method. Furthermore, we observed the relationship between predicted dif sequence positions and
GC skew shift-points, and investigated whether replication termination occurs at the dif site.

Results
Overview of dif sequence prediction

We first analyzed the phylogenetic conservation patterns
of XerC and XerD in bacterial species by calculating the
distances of their amino acid sequences from those in
the seed organisms with known dif sequences (experimentally confirmed: E. coli and B. subtilis and computationally predicted: Frankia alni). As depicted in Figure 1
and Additional file 1, Figure S1, sequence similarity distributions were clearly distinguished by phylum.
Sequences belonging to different phyla always showed
ClustalW distances of â¥0.3, and based on this phylogenetic distribution pattern, we separately trained and predicted the dif sequences in each phylum using iterated
HMM. By this phylogenetic prediction approach, we
predicted dif sequences in 578 genomes out of 592 that
harbor the XerCD recombinase (Additional file 2, Table

predict dif sequences in 63 organisms with 137 chromosomes (Table 1).

All of these predictions resulted in unique hits above the
threshold, and their validity was further confirmed
through leave-one-out cross-validation. On the other
hand, predictions below the threshold (score < 10 and
e-value > 1.0E-04) often resulted in multiple candidates
with insufficient scores. When the initial prediction
using the strict threshold failed, we manually checked
the predicted sequences for the conservation of palindromic structure in the 7-12-bp and 17-22-bp positions,
and candidates that were located close to the origin of
replication were removed because the displacement of a
dif sequence near the origin significantly reduces the
growth rate [24].

In Proteobacteria, fuzzy matching in 28 Escherichia
strains based on the dif sequence of E. coli K12 for the
creation of an initial seed profile hidden Markov model
yielded a unique dif sequence in each of the 28 strains.
Iterated HMM using this seed profile resulted in unique
predictions over the validation threshold in 306 genomes. An additional 137 chromosomes in 69 genomes
were predicted with iterated HMM separated by classes,
and 10 distant genomes were predicted using an alternative seed profile created with the 3 most similar genomes. The predicted dif sequences totaled 482 in 414
organisms, with a prediction rate of 98.61% for singlechromosome strains and 95.00% for multiple-chromosome strains. Predictions failed in eight organisms and
ten chromosomes, namely, Agrobacterium tumefaciens

Nitrosospira multiformis ATCC 25196 (b-Proteobacteria), Desulfotalea psychrophila LSv54 (Î´-Proteobacteria), Sulfurimonas denitrificans DSM 1251 and
Nitratiruptor sp. SB155-2 (Îµ-Proteobacteria).
For Firmicutes, fuzzy matching in 17 Bacillus strains
(based on the dif sequence of B. subtilis str. 168 for the
creation of the initial seed profile hidden Markov
model) yielded a unique dif sequence in each of the 17
strains. Iterated HMM using this seed profile resulted in
unique prediction over the validation threshold for 79
chromosomes in 79 genomes. The dif sequences are
predicted in a total of 97 organisms, with a prediction
rate of 97.00%. Prediction failed in three genomes,
namely, Clostridium perfringens str. 13, C. beijerinckii
NCIMB 8052 (Clostridia), and Lactobacillus helveticus
DPC 4571 (Lactobacillales).
Although no experimentally confirmed dif sequence is
available for Actinobacteria, that of F. alni is suggested
to be 5â-CACGCCGATAATGCACATTATGTCAAGT3â [38]. Therefore, we used this sequence for fuzzy
matching in two genomes, Nocardia farcinica IFM
10152 and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis K-10, whose XerCD amino acid sequences were
most similar to those of F. alni. Iterated HMM using
this seed profile resulted in successful predictions above
the validation threshold in all 66 genomes.
In Chlorobi, an initial seed profile was created with
predicted dif sequences in Chlorobaculum parvum
NCIB 8327 and Prosthecochloris aestuarii DSM 271 that
scored above the validation thresholds using the Firmicutes profile, which resulted in the highest scores compared to those of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.
Likewise, the profile of Firmicutes yielded the highest
scores in Chlamydiae, where the initial seed profile was
created from predicted dif sequences in Chlamydophila
pneumoniae CWL029 and Protochlamydia amoebophila
UWE25, which were below the validation thresholds,
but contained palindromic structure and were located
within 0.01-1.48 degrees from the shift-points of GC
skew. Using these seed profiles, iterated HMM successfully predicted dif sequences in all 11 genomes in Chlorobi and 14 genomes in Chlamydiae.
Because the number of genomes is very small in all of
the other phyla, we utilized the profiles of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi, and Chlamydia that were created thus far instead of applying
iterated HMM based on specific seed profiles, and all of
the following candidates were confirmed based on
scores, palindromic structure, and position. In Elusimicrobia and Tenericutes, all profiles showed high
HMMER scores, and predictions using the profiles of
Firmicutes and Chlamydiae predicted identical dif
sequences. Similarly, the profiles of Firmicutes,

Page 4 of 14

Chlamydiae, and Proteobacteria predicted identical dif
sequences in Nitrospirae, and predictions based on the
profiles of Proteobacteria and Chlorobi were identical in
Gemmatimonadetes.
In Spirochaetes, predictions using the profiles of Firmicutes, Chlamydiae and Proteobacteria profiles resulted
in unique dif sequences in species with single chromosomes, and the profiles of Firmicutes were used for the
predictions of 12 chromosomes in 6 species with multiple chromosomes, all with HMMER scores above the
validation thresholds. The most suitable profiles varied
among species in other phyla. In Acidobacteria, the dif
sequence of Acidobacterium capsulatum ATCC 51196
was predicted by the profiles of Firmicutes, Chlamydiae,
and Chlorobi dif sequences, and other species were predicted using the profile of Firmicutes only. In Verrucomicrobia, profiles based on Proteobacteria, Firmicutes
and Chlorobi predicted Methylacidiphilum infernorum
V4, and that of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes predicted
Opitutus terrae PB90-1 and Akkermansia muciniphila
ATCC BAA-835. In Chloroflexi, the Chlorobi profile
was suitable for Dehalococcoides sp. BAV1 and Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1, and that of Actinobacteria was
used in D. ethenogenes 195 dif sequences. dif sequences
were predicted in 14 Bacteroidetes strains using the profile of Proteobacteria, and those in five strains were predicted using alternative profiles created with the three
most similar genomes. In this way, we successfully predicted dif sequences in most phyla, although the prediction failed in the phyla Cyanobacteria and
Planctomycetes.
Correlation of the dif sequence position and the GC skew
shift-points

Using the predicted dif sequences, we compared their
positions within the genome to the shift-points of the
GC skew. Firstly, we analyzed the distributions of relative genomic distances of xerC, xerD and ftsK genes
from the predicted dif sites. As a result, xerC genes
were mostly located near the dif sites, xerD genes were
near the replication origin, and ftsK genes were located
mostly in between xerC and xerD genes (Additional file
1, Figure S2). The comparison of positions between predicted dif sites and the shift-points of the GC skew
showed that the dif sequences predicted in the phyla
Proteobacteria and Firmicutes correlated significantly
with the GC skew shift-points that are highly likely to
be located within the terminus region (Spearmanâs rank
correlation coefficients: r = 0.844 and 0.715, respectively; Figure 2A). The differences among these positions
fell to within 0.00-1.39% of the genome for Â±1s, and
outliers did not exceed 3% in distance relative to the
genome size (Additional file 1, Figure S3). The above

GCSI
Figure 2 The relationship between dif sites and GC skew. A. Correlation of the GC skew shift-point (corresponding to the replication
terminus region, Y-axis) and the locations of dif sequences (X-axis) for genomes with predicted dif sequences. Genomes with no visible GC skew,
as indicated by GC skew Index (GCSI) â¤ 0.05, are omitted. Both axes are shown as the relative distance in percentage of half of the genome size
(replichore size), from the position directly opposite of the replication origin. For example, 0% means that the position is directly opposite of the
replication origin identified by the GC skew shift-point, and 100% means that it is at the replication origin. In other words, the higher the
percentage, the closer the distance to the replication origin. Here the positions of GC skew shift-points and dif sites are strongly correlated in all
three phyla. B. Lack of correlation between the difference in the positions of GC skew shift-points and dif sites (Y-axis) and the GCSI (X-axis). GCSI
is a quantitative measure of the degree of GC skew, where GCSI = 0 is no observable skew, and GCSI = 1 is extremely pronounced skew.
Typically GC skew is visible at GCSI â¥ 0.1, and it is pronounced when GCSI â¥ 0.3. Since we see no correlation in these plots, stronger replicationrelated mutation bias (i.e. larger GCSI) does not necessarily result in closer positions of the GC skew shift-point and the dif site. These results
suggest that the replication termination occurs near the dif site, but not at the dif site. The number of dif sites is 517 in all bacteria, 438 in
Proteobacteria and 97 in Firmicutes. The r in this figure is Spearmanâs rank-correlation coefficient.

results confirm that chromosome replication and CDR
are related, and that show the accuracy of the predictions described in this work.
To further investigate whether replication terminates
at the dif site, by observing the overall contribution of
the genomic selection/mutation pressures of the replication machinery to the collinearity of the dif sequence
positions and GC skew shift-points, we plotted the distances between them against the GC Skew Index (GCSI)
of genomes to quantify the degree of replicational

mutation/selection pressures. GCSI is an index that
quantifies the degree of GC skew of a given genome,
which can be used as a comparative measure of the
accumulated replicational mutation/selection pressures
[48]. Since the strength of the GC skew is speculated to
partly correlate with the growth rate of bacteria [49],
high replication mutation/selection rate indicated by
GCSI implies a greater number of replication events in
these organisms. Therefore, if the replication terminates
at or around the dif site, even allowing for statistical

Kono et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/19

fluctuations, we can assume that the increasing number
of replication events should shape GC skew shift-points
closer to the dif site by the central limit theorem and by
the law of large numbers. Hence, genomes with higher
GCSI should have closer relative distance between the
GC skew shift-points and dif sites, if replication terminates at the dif site. However, as depicted in Figure 2B,
we observed no correlation between these two variables
(Spearman rank correlation coefficients in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes: r = -0.046 and 0.112, respectively).

Discussion
In this study, we first demonstrated that the conservation of XerCD genes follows phylogenetic conservation
patterns that are specific to each bacterial phylum
(Figure 1). Based on this principle, we comprehensively
predicted the dif sequences in hundreds of completely
sequenced genomes using a recursive strategy that iteratively models and predicts these sequences using profile
hidden Markov models. As a result, we obtained unique
candidate dif sequences in 715 chromosomes in 641
strains that were validated through multiple means,
resulting in the largest collection of predicted dif
sequences assembled to date. In comparison to previous
work by Carnoy and Roten, which predicted dif
sequences in 228 genomes, our predictions coincided
with their results in 208 genomes and we added 507
genomes, including Aromatoleum aromaticum str.
EbN1, which Carnoy and Roten reported to lack the dif/
XerCD system. Excluding strains or chromosomes we
could not predict, namely, A. tumefaciens str. C58, Burkholderia sp. 383 chromosome I, II, D. psychrophila
LSv54, N. multiformis ATCC 25196, P. denitrificans
PD1222 chromosome I, II and S. denitrificans DSM
1251, the predicted dif sequences in this study differed
in 12 chromosomes in comparison to the results of Carnoy and Roten: C. crescentus CB15, Granulibacter
bethesdensis CGDNIH1, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis
TAC125 chromosome II, Ralstonia eutropha H16 chromosome II, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 chromosome
I, R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 chromosome II, Rickettsia bellii
OSU 85-389, R. conorii, R. felis URRWXCal2, R. prowazekii, R. typhi Wilmington, and Shewanella sp. ANA-3.
For R. eutropha H16 chromosome II and P. haloplanktis
TAC125 chromosome II, both studies predicted positions that were symmetric from the origin of replication,
and although experimental confirmation is required to
confirm which candidates function in vivo, the palindromic structures of the XerCD binding sites are more conserved in the candidates predicted by our method.
Therefore, overall, our results were identical with those
of Carnoy and Roten for 92% of the genome analyzed
(208/228), and 11/12 mismatch resulted in candidates
with more conserved XerCD binding sites, with the

addition of 507 genomes among numerous phyla. Carnoy and Roten noted that some Vibrio species contain
two dif sites both located at the vicinity of the GC skew
shift-points. Therefore, we further tested whether the
predicted dif sites in multiple chromosomes are all
located near the GC skew shift-points. Using 5% genomic distance as a threshold, 45 out of 54 strains with
two chromosomes, including Vibrio species, and 6 out
of 9 strains with three chromosomes showed such
agreement of the positions, (Additional file 2, Table S1).
There are four factors that may explain the advantages
of our results. First, the selection of bacterial strains in
the study by Carnoy and Roten was limited to genomes
harboring XerCD that were identified by their similarity
to those of E. coli, whereas we used all genomes with
XerCD orthologs as identified by the KEGG Orthology
database. While there is a little time-delay until the
sequences are annotated and incorporated into the
KEGG Orthology database, use of this database provides
a more generic and comprehensive starting point. Second, similarity searches using software tools such as
BLAST are not suitable for short sequence motifs that
undergo mutation, and the difficulty in identifying only
those dif sequences with sequence similarity has been
shown for C. crescentus [50] and several classes of Proteobacteria [20]. Third, dif sequences require two binding motifs of XerC and XerD to be functional [51];
therefore, the conservation of palindromic structure at
the 7-12-bp and 17-22-bp positions should be confirmed
for each predicted candidate. Finally, the use of iterated
HMM allowed dif sequence prediction using the profiles
of closely related species for each iteration, following the
phylogenetic conservation pattern of XerCD.
The high predictability shown in this study suggests
that the dif/XerCD system of chromosome dimer resolution is highly conserved among bacterial species and
that dif sequences are almost always conserved when
XerCD is present within the genome. In fact, according
to the KEGG Orthology database, XerC and XerD are
conserved in approximately 60-70% of bacterial species,
which is a higher percentage than is found for the replication termination protein Tus [52] and for universal
genes such as the SOS response repressor LexA [53]. In
light of the remarkable conservation of the dif/XerCD
system, although it is beyond the scope of this study,
explorations of alternative CDR machinery in species
that lack the dif/XerCD machinery would be an interesting area of future research. Chromosome dimer resolution pathways are suggested to be present in species
that lack the dif/XerCD system, and several alternative
pathways have been reported and suggested. Le Bourgeois et al. reported an unconventional CDR pathway
involving only one recombinase (XerS) in Streptococci
and Lactococci, along with a 31-bp dif sequence [25].

Kono et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/19

Similarly, through computational analysis, Carnoy and
Roten suggested the existence of another pathway,
termed XerH, in Îµ-Proteobacteria in place of XerCD and
XerS and discussed the likelihood of the existence of dif
analogues in these species [26,46]. The basic strategy of
iterated HMM should be applicable in predicting dif
analogues in these species when defined seed sequences
and detailed positions of recombinase binding sites are
elucidated.
Although we limited our analysis to strains containing
XerCD orthologs, our predictions failed in several species. In Proteobacteria, we could not identify dif
sequences in five organisms and seven chromosomes,
including species with single chromosomes (Nitratiruptor sp. SB155-2 and S. denitrificans DSM 1251) that are
Îµ-Proteobacteria, where an alternative CDR mechanism
involving XerH is suggested [46], and species with multiple chromosomes (P. denitrificans PD1222 chromosome I, P. denitrificans PD1222 chromosome II,
B. phytofirmans PsJN chromosome I, and Burkholderia
sp. 383 chromosome I and III). Among these, B. phytofirmans PsJN and Burkholderia sp. 383 contained dif
sequences in other chromosomes, indicating that the
dif/XerCD system is conserved in these strains. Similarly, in Firmicutes, we could not determine dif
sequence in L. helveticus DPC 4571, C. perfringens str.
13 or C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. Among these strains,
L. helveticus DPC 4571 has an alternative CDR recombinase XerS in its genome, indicating that the dif/XerCD
system may not be functional. This is an intriguing
example of possible evolutionary intermediate with the
co-existence of two systems, presumably resulting from
a horizontal gene transfer event. While we are unable to
find a dif sequence corresponding to the XerS machinery, xerS gene in this species is located close to the GC
skew shift-point (xerC: 1031814-bp, xerD: 1055574-bp,
xerS: 1228715-bp, and GC skew shift-point: 1225733bp), which is indicative of its functionality as shown in
previous works [25,26,46]. C. perfringens str. 13 and C.
beijerinckii exhibit highly biased GC contents (28.57%
and 29.86%, respectively), and hidden Markov profiling
of AT-rich dif sequences may have failed due to the
background AT-richness of the genome. Comparative
studies of dif/XerCD systems using close relatives of
these genomes may provide evolutionary clues regarding
the acquisition and loss of CDR machinery. For example, mapping the types of CDR machinery to the phylogenetic tree of Îµ-Proteobacteria obtained using 16S
rRNA sequences with the dnaml program in the Phylip
package shows that a XerH type of CDR machinery may
have diverged at an early stage within this phylum. The
XerCD type of CDR seems to be absent in the Campylobacter and Helicobacter genera, except for Helicobacter
hepaticus, which suggests the existence of the XerH

Page 7 of 14

type of CDR in the common ancestor of these species
(Figure 3). The dif candidate in H. hepaticus was predicted with iterated HMM only marginally above the
threshold, with a score of 10.2 and an e-value of 5.5e05. Further analysis is required to identify whether this
species actually contains dif/XerCD or XerH-type
machinery.
Predictions failed in all species belonging to the phylum Cyanobacteria. Although XerCD is present in these
species, the sequence similarity distance of XerCD in
Cyanobacteria to those of other phyla was high (average
of 0.358 Â± 0.0159, N = 540), with a minimum distance
of 0.322 to Actinosynnema mirum (Actinobacteria),
which exceeded the 0.3 threshold that was shown in
Figure 4. Therefore, this divergence of XerCD in Cyanobacteria from those of other phyla implies low applicability of the iterated HMM approach, which utilizes the
phylogenetic conservation pattern of XerCD. One possible explanation for the prediction failure in this phylum
is that the dif sequences and XerCD are highly divergent
in Cyanobacteria, preventing their identification with
sequence profiles. The replication origin in Cyanobacteria is yet to be identified, and GC skew is weak in
these species, implying low degree of replicational mutation/selection pressures, which could also be a reason
for the failure of prediction in these species.
Predicted dif sequences largely existed in non-coding
regions (93.92%). More than half of these coding regions
that contained dif sequences were hypothetical, with no
functional annotation. Furthermore, we found two dif
sequences included in phage ORF in Vibrio and Xanthomonas. While these sequences may be integrated with
the phages by their hijacking of the host recombination
machinery, these sequences are speculated to be the
functional dif sites, due to 1. their unique occurrence
within the genome opposite of the replication origin,
and 2. their similarity as identified by our phylogenetic
modeling approach. As previously shown in Proteobacteria [46], the XerC binding site is more variable and
the XerD binding site is more conserved in all phyla
(Figure 5), both for genomes with single chromosomes
and for those with multiple chromosomes, presumably
due to the interaction between XerD and FtsK for the
initiation of first strand exchange [14]. The dif
sequences in a-Proteobacteria with single chromosomes
showed higher variation compared to these of other
classes and phyla, but this variation was correlated with
variations in genomic GC content (Additional file 1,
Figure S4). These differences between variations are
partly explains the failure of our prediction in extremely
AT-rich genomes, such as those found in C. perfringens
and C. beijerinckii.
Although dif sequences are expected to be located
near the shift-point of the GC skew, we did not use this

Figure 4 Prediction strategy. A. Example of the iterated HMM in Proteobacteria. The first seed profile hidden Markov model is created from
the seed dif sequence of Escherichia coli, by searching for dif sequences in 28 genomes belonging to the genus Escherichia by means of fuzzy
matching. Based on this initial profile hidden Markov model, dif sequences were predicted in the genomes of the closest genus to the
Escherichia genus (in this case, Shigella) according to XerCD amino acid sequences. Subsequently, a new profile is created using the previous
profile and the newly predicted dif sequences, and this new profile is used to predict in the second closest genus (in this case, Salmonella). In
this way, profile creation and dif sequence prediction were repeated recursively in decreasing order of similarity of XerCD from the Escherichia
sequence. In this way, iterated HMM is conducted for each phylum. B. Flow chart of the overall strategy.

feature to predict and validate dif sequences with iterated HMM; therefore, using the comprehensively predicted dif sequences across numerous phyla, we were
able to directly compare the positions of predicted dif
sequences with those of the GC skew shift-points to
analyze their relationships. As expected, these two positions are highly correlated in terms of genomic loci,
confirming a previous work [38]. In this respect, because
GC skew is the cumulative result of replicational selection/mutations, the degree of conservation of the CDR
machinery is presumably in concordance with the
degree of replication selection/mutation pressures (i.e.
GC skew), which is partly characterized by the difference in the replication machinery and partly

characterized by the growth rate [54]. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 2B, the differences in the positions of the GC skew shift-point and the strength of the
GC skew, as quantified by GCSI, were not correlated. If
replication termination occurs at the dif site, as proposed by Hendrickson and Lawrence [38], a stronger
GC skew that is generated by a larger number of replication events and/or a higher mutation rate should statistically bring the GC skew shift-point closer to the dif
site by the central limit theorem and law of large numbers. In fact, the overall correlation of these loci leads to
the proposal that the dif site is the replication termination point. However, because a stronger degree of replication mutation/selection pressures does not bring these

Nucleotide position within dif sequence

class (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, a-Proteobacteria, b-Proteobacteria, g-Proteobacteria, and Î´-Proteobacteria). The

two loci closer to each other, they are not in a causal
relationship. Therefore, although the dif sequence is
located near the replication termination site for efficient
CDR, the replication termination site is suggested to be
at a site other than the dif site, as was recently shown in
vivo [42]. On the other hand, the dif sequences in Firmicutes are more conserved in various phyla because the
profile of Firmicutes was the best suited as the initial
profile of iterated HMM in Chlorobi, Acidobacteria,
Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Elusimicrobia, Tenericutes, and Spirochaetes, where initial seed sequences
were not available, and those in Proteobacteria were
more variable, as shown by the requirement to predict
by iterated HMM in classes instead of phyla. Tus proteins, which are shown to terminate replication in vivo,
are more conserved in Proteobacteria and are not widely
conserved in other, partly supporting the possible
change in replication termination mechanism by a relatively recent takeover by the Tus-Ter system [43]. On
the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, Tus analogues have not been comprehensively searched in other
phyla, and therefore further analysis is required in order
to fully support this hypothesis.

Conclusions
By taking the phylogenetic iterated HMM approach and
validating predicted candidates through a combination
of HMMER score thresholds, conservation of palindromic structure, and cross-validation, we achieved a comprehensive identification of unique dif candidates in
hundreds of genomes. As the result, we obtained unique
candidate dif sequences in 715 chromosomes in 641
strains that were validated through multiple means,
resulting in the largest collection of predicted
dif sequences assembled to date. All of the predicted
dif sequences described in this study, as well as visualizations of dif locations on circular genome maps,
are freely available in an online database at http://
www.g-language.org/data/repter/. The locations of dif
sequences can be useful for studies of the regions surrounding the replication terminus, for phylogenetic
studies of the replication termination and chromosome
dimer resolution mechanisms, and can serve as supporting evidence for GC skew analyses.
Furthermore, we compared the positions of predicted
dif sequences with those of the GC skew shift-points to
understand the relationship between dif sequence and
replication terminus using GCSI. As the result, although
these two positions were highly correlated in terms of
genomic loci, the differences in the positions of the GC
skew shift-point and the GCSI were not correlated.
Therefore, despite the dif sequence is located near the
replication termination site for efficient CDR, the

Page 11 of 14

replication termination site is suggested to be at a site
other than the dif site.

Methods
Software and sequences

All analyses in this study were conducted using programs written in Perl with the G-language Genome
Analysis Environment, version 1.8.10 [55-57]. Hidden
Markov Modeling and searching was conducted with
HMMER, version 2.3.2 [45]. The dif sequence is the
binding site of the XerCD recombinase; therefore, we
first selected 734 circular bacterial chromosomes among
658 species/strains according to their conservation of
XerCD using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) Orthology database (KO; [58]). We
obtained these sequences from the NCBI FTP Repository [59]. The following experimentally confirmed
(E. coli and B. subtilis) or computationally predicted
(F. alni) dif sequences were used as seed sequences for
subsequent searches and machine learning:
E. coli 5â-GGTGCGCATAATGTATATTATGTTAAAT-3â [60]
B. subtilis 5â-ACTTCCTAGAATATATATTATGTAAACT-3â [23]
F. alni 5â-CACGCCGATAATGCACATTATGTCAAGT-3â [38]
Iterated Hidden Markov Modeling

XerCD conservation does not immediately imply dif
sequence conservation [20]. Therefore, to determine the
phylogenetic conservation patterns of XerCD, we first
aligned all XerCD amino acid sequences in the 734 genomes analyzed in this work with those in organisms with
the above-mentioned dif sequences using ClustalW [61].
The average of the distances of XerC and XerD sequences
that were calculated from this alignment were used to
infer phylogenetic conservation patterns among phyla.
Based on the phylogenetic conservation patterns of
XerCD, we iteratively created the hidden Markov models (HMM) for the accurate prediction of dif sequences,
seeded with the previously described dif sequences
(Figure 4A). Iterated HMM is shown to be able to build
a more diverse and potentially more sensitive models
than regular HMM, by incorporating distant homologous sequences while avoiding the contamination of
non-homologous sequences into the model [62], and
thus iterative HMM has been frequently utilized in
bioinformatics and computational biology [63-66]. In
this work, the first profile hidden Markov model was
created from the dif sequences identified in genomes
belonging in the same genus as the genome harboring
the seed sequence. For example, in Proteobacteria, the
seed sequences came from E. coli; therefore, the dif

Kono et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/19

sequences were searched in 28 genomes belonging to
the genus Escherichia by means of fuzzy matching with
the seed sequences of E. coli K12 using Perl module
String::Approx 3.26 [67]. For fuzzy matching, the maximum numbers of insertions, deletions, and substitutions
were previously determined to be 0-bp, 0-bp, and 8-bp,
respectively [60]. Likewise, initial profiles were created
for Firmicutes based on 24 genomes in the genus Bacillus and for Actinobacteria based on two genomes in the
genus Frankia. Based on these initial profile hidden
Markov models, dif sequences were predicted in the
genomes of the closest genus to the seed genus according to the amino acid sequences of XerCD proteins.
In the case of Proteobacteria, an initial profile was
created using genomes belonging to the genus Escherichia, and this profile was used to predict dif sequences
in the genus Shigella. Subsequently, a new profile was
created using the previous profile and the newly predicted dif sequences, and this new profile was used to
predict the second nearest genus (in the case of Proteobacteria, Salmonella). In this way, profile creation and
dif sequence prediction were iterated in decreasing
order of similarity of XerCD from the seed sequences;
thus, iterated HMM was conducted for each phylum.
Because no dif seed sequences were available for phyla
other than the three described above, the three profile
hidden Markov models obtained by iterated HMM in
Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were
used as the initial profiles. At each iterated HMM, predicted candidates were validated according to the following criteria: 1) HMMER score â¥10 and E-value <
1.0e-04, 2) leave-one-out cross-validation using the new
profiles, and 3) conservation of the palindromic structure. For cross-validation, each time a new profile was
created in the iterated HMM, we tested the validity of
the training set by leaving out one of the dif sequences
from the accumulated set of dif sequences and checking
that the prediction of the left-out sequence by training
with all of the other dif sequences is always above the
threshold for all dif sequences collected up to that iteration. For the palindromic structure, positions 7-12-bp
and 17-22-bp of dif sequences, corresponding to the
binding sites of XerC and XerD, were checked for complementarities. For example, the palindromic structure
of E. coli dif sequences in bracket notation is ââ(â
((((((-()-)))))) â)ââ, and the conservation threshold is
set to more than four pairs of complementarities within
the 7-12-bp and 17-22-bp positions of the predicted dif
sequences.
Although iterated HMM is based on phyla, this taxonomic unit is sometimes too diverse to accurately follow
phylogeny with recursive means. Therefore, prediction
was separately conducted in classes instead of phyla for
60 strains, harboring 130 chromosomes for classes a-,

Page 12 of 14

b- and g-Proteobacteria. Similarly, sometimes, a species
is highly phylogenetically distant from the seed organism, making it the case that utilization of profile hidden
Markov models from other phyla is more suitable than
own phylaâs profile. When iterated HMM fails in such
cases, an alternative seed profile is created using the dif
sequences from the top three genomes with the closest
XerCD sequences, as determined by alignment using
ClustalW (Figure 4B).
GC skewâs shift-point, calculated as (C - G)/(C + G),
was computed using the find_ori_ter function of the Glanguage GAE, based on the cumulative GC skew [68]
at 1-bp resolution. Although GC skew is widely
observed in bacterial species, a number of genomes do
not exhibit notable compositional bias [48,69]. To determine the presence of genomic nucleotide compositional
bias, the GC skew Index (GCSI) was calculated for all
genomes, and GCSI â¥ 0.05 was used as the threshold
[48,70]. GCSI quantifies the degree of GC skew using
the compositional distance between the leading and lagging strands and the spectral amplitude of 1 Hz signal
of GC skew graph using Fast Fourier Transform. In this
study, the replication origin is defined based on the
cumulative GC skew at 1-bp resolution using the G-language GAE [55].
Calculation of the conservation quantity of dif sequences

Conservation quantity was calculated based on the
nucleotide variance in each position of dif sequences in
Figure 5. Firstly, we calculated the position-specific base
composition of all dif sequences in a group (phylum or
class). Subsequently, variance of the most frequent base
in that position is calculated from the base composition.
For example, when a group with 100 dif sequences has
nth base composition of (A, T, G, C = 100, 0, 0, 0) or
(A, T, G, C = 25, 25, 25, 25), the variance is 2500 or 0,
respectively. Hence, if the position-specific base composition is biased toward any one base, its high variance
indicates high degree of conservation. These values are
normalized to percentages for comparison with other
groups in Figure 5. In the case of multiple chromosomes, since these conservation quantities were calculated in each strain, the average value was used for
normalization.
