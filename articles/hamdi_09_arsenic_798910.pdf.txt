Abstract
Background: Arsenic is one of the most ubiquitous toxins and endangers the health of tens of millions
of humans worldwide. It is a mainly a water-borne contaminant. Inorganic trivalent arsenic (AsIII) is one of
the major species that exists environmentally. The transport of AsIII has been studied in microbes, plants
and mammals. Members of the aquaglyceroporin family have been shown to actively conduct AsIII and its
organic metabolite, monomethylarsenite (MAsIII). However, the transport of AsIII and MAsIII in in any fish
species has not been characterized.
Results: In this study, five members of the aquaglyceroporin family from zebrafish (Danio rerio) were
cloned, and their ability to transport water, glycerol, and trivalent arsenicals (AsIII and MAsIII) and
antimonite (SbIII) was investigated. Genes for at least seven aquaglyceroporins have been annotated in the
zebrafish genome project. Here, five genes which are close homologues to human AQP3, AQP9 and
AQP10 were cloned from a zebrafish cDNA preparation. These genes were named aqp3, aqp3l, aqp9a,
aqp9b and aqp10 according to their similarities to the corresponding human AQPs. Expression of aqp9a,
aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l and aqp10 in multiple zebrafish organs were examined by RT-PCR. Our results
demonstrated that these aquaglyceroporins exhibited different tissue expression. They are all detected in
more than one tissue. The ability of these five aquaglyceroporins to transport water, glycerol and the
metalloids arsenic and antimony was examined following expression in oocytes from Xenopus leavis. Each
of these channels showed substantial glycerol transport at equivalent rates. These aquaglyceroporins also
facilitate uptake of inorganic AsIII, MAsIII and SbIII. Arsenic accumulation in fish larvae and in different tissues
from adult zebrafish was studied following short-term arsenic exposure. The results showed that liver is
the major organ of arsenic accumulation; other tissues such as gill, eye, heart, intestine muscle and skin
also exhibited significant ability to accumulate arsenic. The zebrafish larvae also accumulate considerable
amounts of arsenic.
Conclusion: This is the first molecular identification of fish arsenite transport systems and we propose
that the extensive expression of the fish aquaglyceroporins and their ability to transport metalloids
suggests that aquaglyceroporins are the major pathways for arsenic accumulation in a variety of zebrafish
tissues. Uptake is one important step of arsenic metabolism. Our results will contribute to a new
understanding of aquatic arsenic metabolism and will support the use of zebrafish as a new model system
to study arsenic associated human diseases.

Background
Arsenic is a well known environmental toxin and Group A
human carcinogen. Humans are exposed to arsenic via a
variety of other geochemical and anthropogenic sources,
especially drinking water. The two major oxidation states
of inorganic arsenic in water are trivalent arsenite (AsIII)
and pentavalent arsenate (AsV) [1]. Arsenate is usually
reduced to arsenite in the cytosol of cells [2,3]. Usually, in
well water and surface water, both AsIII, the more toxic
form, and AsV, the oxidized but less toxic form co-exist at
variable ratios [4]. Since water is the major source of
chronic exposure, most countries limit the upper level of
arsenic allowed in drinking water. In the United States,
the EPA lowered the maximal containment limit (MCL)
from 50 ppb to 10 ppb http://www.epa.gov/EPA-WATER/
2001/January/Day-22/w1668.htm. In Oakland County,
Michigan (the location of Oakland University), wells contaminated with arsenic that leaches out of the Marshall
Sandstone result in chronic arsenicosis in individuals
dependent on those wells (front page of the Detroit Free
Press, November 19, 1997; Flint Journal, Feb 14, 2008).
Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane channel proteins that mediate the bidirectional downhill flux of water
and selected small amphipathic molecules across cellular
membranes [5]. Aquaglyceroporins are a subfamily of
aquaporins that translocate larger molecules such as glycerol. Inherited mutation of AQPs is associated with multiple physiological disorders [5]. In total, twelve human
aquaporins have been reported, and four of them, AQP3,
AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10, are aquaglyceroporins. These
AQPs play important roles in the tissues where they are
expressed. For example, AQP7 is an adipose isoform that
releases glycerol into the blood stream during lipolysis,
while AQP9 is a liver isoform that uptake the glycerol
[6,7]. The interplay of these two AQPs is critical for gluconeogenesis during starvation [8]. In addition to their
physiological roles in nutrient transport, aquaglyceroporins have been shown to facilitate uptake of trivalent
metalloids arsenite and antimonite because in solution
they are trihydroxylated inorganic mimics of glycerol [9].
AQPs including E. coli GlpF [10], Yeast FPS1 [11], plant
Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Proteins (NIPs) [12] and mammalian AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9 [13] were shown to transport arsenite. We have previously demonstrated
mammalian AQP9 transports both inorganic AsIII, and its
cellular methylation product, MAsIII [14]. Since AQP9 is a
bi-directional channel, we have proposed that it mediates
both influx of arsenite from blood into liver and efflux of
MAsIII from liver to blood.
Fish, along with other aquatic organisms, are known to
accumulate significant amounts of arsenic as well as other
toxic metals such as mercury, copper, cadmium and
nickel. For example, feral marine fish usually contain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/104

from 1 μg As/g dry mass to more than 10 μg/g dry mass
[15]. In contrast, the reported levels for terrestrial animals,
such as cattle or chickens, are only in the range of 7 - 30
ng As/g dry mass [16]. Although there are many studies
concerned with general arsenic accumulation and speciation in various types of fish, there have been no mechanistic studies of arsenic detoxification in fish. Since zebrafish
is the most studied fish model, in this study, we examined
the capacity of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins for metalloid
uptake. By querying the zebrafish annotated genome database with the sequence of the human AQP9, seven members of aquaglyceroporins were indentified. These Aqps
share high sequence similarity with the corresponding
human AQPs. Only one, termed aqp3, has been characterized to date [17]. In this study, we demonstrate that five
zebrafish aquaglyceroporins are functionally expressed in
Xenopus oocytes and transport water, glycerol and the metalloids AsIII, MAsIII and trivalent antimonite (SbIII). These
Aqps are differentially expressed in a variety of zebrafish
organs. Thus, the extensive expression of Aqps may
account for the accumulation of arsenic in different tissues. The identification of arsenic metabolism pathways
in fish is important to understand the arsenic transformation mechanisms in aquatic organisms and to evaluate the
safety of fish as a food.

Methods
Protein sequence alignment
The protein sequences were obtained from NCBI. The
alignment was done using ClustalW http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using TreeViewX http://dar
win.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/treeviewx/ (Fig. 1). To perform a detailed protein sequences alignment, the
sequences were first allinged with ClustalW, and then performed by Boxshade server http://www.ch.embnet.org/
software/BOX_form.html. Sequences in black background indicate identical residues while in grey background means similar residues (Fig. 2).
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR
To generate a full-length cRNAs, the total RNA was
extracted from isolated adult organs as well as the 72hours post fertilization (hpf) embryos (Invetrogen, Trizol) and reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA
using a commercial kit (Superscript III, Invitrogen Co.)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was
performed using specific primers (Table 1. The primers
were designed according the published sequences and
synthesized commercially (IDT DNA). The optimum
annealing temperature of each gene was determined by
gradient PCR. Where the average melting temperature
(Tm) of the forward and reverse primers for each gene was
used for setting the annealing temperatures for the gradi-

ent PCR. The annealing temperatures ranged from (Average Tm-5°C) to the elongation temperature (72°C).
Some RT-PCR products in the studies of tissue expression
were partially sequenced by using forward primers in
Table 2. Specifically, RT-PCR products of aqp9a from
intestine and kidney, aqp9b from eyes, aqp3 from eye,
aqp3l from eye and skin, aqp10 from intestine, kidney and
liver were verified by partial sequencing.
Identification and cloning of aquaglyceroporin genes from
zebrafish cDNA
The sequence of human AQP9 was used to identify
zebrafish Aqps from the sequences in the NCBI zebrafish
database. Seven different zebrafish aquaglyceroporin
genes were annotated. Unique primers were designed to
clone five closest human AQP3, AQP9 and AQP10 homologues. The following PCR conditions were employed:
preheat 94°C for 2 min; denature 94°C 1 min; anneal
45°C for 1 min; elongate 72°C for 1 min; repeat 30 cycles.
A second round of PCR was done if the amount of product
from the first round was too low. The PCR products were
ligated into vector plasmid pGEMT-easy (Promega Co.) or
PL2-5 [18] and their sequences were verified by DNA
sequencing (Beckman CEQ2000).

Expression of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins in Xenopus
oocytes
The capped RNA from five zebrafish Aqps were transcribed in vitro using mMessage mMachine T7 ultra kit
(Ambion Co.), as described previously [18]. Stage V-VI
Xenopus oocytes were isolated and treated by 0.2% collagenase A (Roche) for 2 hours. The defoliated oocytes were
injected with 10 ng of different cRNAs. They were then
incubated in ND96 buffer (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1
mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH7.5) for 3
days at 16°C and used for uptake assays [19].
Water osmolarity measurement
Pf was determined by placing oocytes in 50% ND96 buffer
and swelling was recorded using a microscopy (Nikon
LABOPHOT-2) and camera system (SPOT PURSUIT,
Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) at 10 sec intervals for 1 min.
The images were processed by ImageJ software http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/. The water permeation coefficient (Pf)
was calculated as reported previously [20].
Transport assays
In vivo metalloid uptake assays were performed as previously described [18]. In brief, oocytes were incubated in
either 0.5 mM 3H-glycerol, 1 mM sodium arsenite

gift from William Cullen at the University of British
Columbia, Canada) or 1 mM potassium sodium tartrate
antimonite (Sigma), which all dissolved in ND96 buffer.
After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the
oocytes were collected and washed in ND96 buffer three
times. The oocytes were either treated with 10% SDS for
scintillation counting or with 70% nitric acid at 70°C for
metalloid quantification. One oocyte was used each time
and at least seven replicates were used to calculate the
standard error. The amount of arsenic and antimony was
determined by inductivity coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ELAN 9000, PerkinElmer, Norwalk,
CT). Zebrafish tissues or Xenopus oocytes were completely
digested with 0.1 ml of 70% (vol/vol) HNO3 for two

hours. The samples were then diluted to 2 mL final volume with HPLC grade water for metalloid assays.
Arsenic treatment for zebrafish larvae and adults
The zebrafish (AB line) larvae were treated with 5 ppm (46
μM) of sodium arsenite (Sigma) in 20 mL water from 2 to
6 days post fertilization (dpf). Adult zebrafish were
treated with arsenic by placing 5 ppm sodium arsenite in
I L water continuously for 96 hr. The water that containing
arsenic was changed every day with fresh arsenite to avoid
oxidation to arsenate. Following arsenic exposure, the fish
were transferred to arsenic-free fresh water for one hour to
remove nonspecifically bound arsenic. The zebrafish were
euthanized with 0.2 mM tricaine (MCA222, Sigma). Each
data point represents three samples, and each sample contains ten larvae, which were pooled and homogenized.

Various adult organs, including as brain, heart, muscle,

fish and analyzed for arsenic accumulation. These samples were weighed, and total arsenic was determined by
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),
as described above.
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative results are shown as means ± standard deviations. The results were subjected to statistical analysis
using single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). P values
< 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Nomenclature of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins
Three human aquaglyceroporins, AQP3, AQP7 and
AQP9, have been shown to facilitate arsenite influx with
different efficiencies [21]. AQP9 is the major liver isoform
and shows the highest rate of arsenite conduction in vitro
[22]. In a query of the zebrafish database with human
AQP9, seven distinct zebrafish aquaglyceroporin homologues have been located. Zebrafish aquaporin water
channel homologues were identified by querying with
human AQP1. Fig. 1 shows a phylogenetic tree of the
orthodox aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. The
sequences of five aquaglyceroporins that have been studied are aligned in Fig, 2.

Among these seven aquaglyceroporins, one has been characterized as an amphipathic channel and was named aqp3
[17]. The other six are uncharacterized open reading
frames (ORF). In this study, four out of these six genes
that encodes the aquaglyceroporin were cloned and studied. Through discussion with the Zebrafish Nomenclature
Committee, and in accordance with the committee's principles [23], these genes have been named aqp9a, aqp9b,
aqp3l and aqp10, according to the similarity of their gene
products to the human gene products (boxed in Fig. 1).
Unfortunately, the other two genes were not successfully
obtained by RT-PCR and their function remains unknown
(NCBI
accession
number
NP_956204
and
NP_001076516). These four zebrafish Aqps, along with
Aqp3, share high sequence identities with the human
AQPs (44%-65%) and are most highly conserved at the
two NPA/NPAR motifs (Indicated in Fig. 2). The NCBI
access number and the names of these genes, along with
their protein sequence identities and similarities are listed
in Table 2.
Tissue specific Aqp expression
Expression of aqp genes in adult zebrafish tissues was
examined by RT-PCR. The aquaglyceroporins exhibited
different patterns of expression. The aqp3 was expressed in
multiple tissues, including eye, gill, heart, intestine, kidney, liver and skin (Fig. 3). These results are consistent
with data from in-situ hybridization in zebrafish larvae

Metalloid transport
Metalloid transport by the five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins was examined. Each Aqp facilitated uptake of either
AsIII or MAsIII (Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B). Overall, three Aqps
facilitate organic MAsIII at higher rates than inorganic AsIII,
which is consistent with our previous observation with
mammalian AQP9 [14]. Oocytes expressing aqp3l and
aqp10 exhibit 4 and 6-fold increases in the rate of MAsIII
uptake compared with AsIII uptake, respectively. (Fig. 5A
&5B). It appears that rate of AsIII transport is comparable
to glycerol transport, and both are relative lower than the
transport of MAsIII. Transport of trivalent antimony (SbIII)
was also examined. In the periodic table, the metalloid
antimony is in the same column as arsenic, and it shares
similar chemical properties. Antimony is also a toxic metalloid that exists in aquatic surroundings. Oocytes
expressing aqp9a, aqp9b or aqp10 exhibited SbIII permeation, but oocytes expressing aqp3I did not (Fig. 5C).
Oocytes expressing aqp9b or aqp10 exhibited higher rates
of SbIII transport than for AsIII (The transport rate of AsIII

Similar to other animals, zebrafish aquaglyceroporins
have a differential but extensive tissue expression pattern.
The Aqp3 is unique member that can be detected in most
tissues except for brain and muscle. The expression of
Aqp3 has been studied in many other fish species. It has
been found that in different fish, Aqp3 has a different
expressional pattern. For example, in fresh water and sea
water tilapia, Aqp3 is present in brain, pituitary, kidney,
spleen, intestine, skin, eye and gill [26]. While in silver sea
bream, Aqp3 was detected in gill, kidney, liver, brain,
heart, and spleen [27]. It appears that the gill and skin are
sites where Aqp3 can be found in many types of fish.

Functional expression of zebrafish aquaglyceroporins in
Xenopus oocytes
Five aquaglyceroporin genes, aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l,
and aqp10, were cloned using a cDNA library of whole
adult zebrafish (a gift from Jeffery Yoder, North Carolina
State University). The 5' capped RNA made in vitro was
microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes expressing
any of the five transporters conduct water or glycerol
uptake efficiently compared with control (Fig. 4). Water
and glycerol are two typical substrates for aquaglyceroporins. The results clearly demonstrated that all these five
aquaglyceroporins are expressed in Xenopus oocytes and
function as aquaglyceroporins.

Ki

that showed expression of Aqp3 in gill and skin (Bernard
and Thisse, ZFIN direct submission). The expression of
Aqp3 in embryonic eye was also previously reported (zfin
direct submission, http://www.zfin.org)[24,25]. Using
RT-PCR, it has been found that Aqp3 can be detected in
more adult tissues in addition to these three organs (gill,
skin and eye) that are detected by in-situ hybridization
(zfin direct submission). The first possibility is that RTPCR is a more sensitive approach to study mRNA transcription. Second, the Aqp3 may be developmentally regulated. The close Aqp3 homologue, Aqp3l, shows
different tissue expression when compared with Aqp3.
Aqp3l was mainly detected in eye and skin (Fig. 3). Aqp10
was expressed in intestine, kidney and liver (Fig. 3).
Aqp9a was detected in brain, intestine, kidney and liver
while Aqp9b was detected in brain, eye, gill and liver (Fig.
3). The differential expression of the individual aqp gene
results in all examined tissues expressing at least one type
of aquaglyceroporin.

that these channels which can take up arsenic are
expressed early in development.

Effect of arsenic exposure on arsenic accumulation in
zebrafish tissues
Arsenic is primarily a water-borne pollutant. Inorganic
arsenic, including trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate, are often found in natural waters [4]. Fish accumulate arsenic through mouth and gills. Since arsenite is
more toxic than arsenate, arsenic accumulation was
assayed in zebrafish larvae and adult tissues following
arsenite exposure. Zebrafish larvae accumulated considerable amounts of arsenic (Fig. 6), which is consistent with
our observation that larvae express aqp genes (data not
shown). Adult fish tissues accumulated arsenic in different amounts. As is the case with humans, arsenic accumulates most highly in liver. Arsenic exposed fish had
enlarged livers (data not shown), which has been
observed also in humans [28]. Arsenic accumulated in
gill, muscle, heart, eye, liver, intestine and skin. Brain is
the only organ that exhibited limited ability to accumulate arsenic (Fig. 6). It is shown that zebrafish larvae accumulated as much arsenic as adult muscle, demonstrating

Discussion
It has been previously demonstrated that metalloids,
including arsenic, antimony, boron and silicon are transported by microbial, mammalian and plant aquaglyceroporins [5,29]. Since arsenic is a major water-borne
contaminant, it is reasonable to speculate that fish uptake
and accumulate this toxic element. Fish are already
known for their high tolerance and accumulation of toxic
metals and metalloids [30,31]. These elements are taken
up via gills or consumed in the diet. However, the specific
molecular mechanisms involved in arsenic accumulation
and metabolism are not known. As uptake is the first step
in arsenic metabolism, the first question to ask is what
transporters are responsible for the observed high levels of
arsenic accumulation. Since aquaglyceroporins are known
to transport both inorganic arsenite [13] and organic
MAsIII [14] in other species, it is logical to investigate the
function of aquaglyceroporins in zebrafish. Aquaporins
play an important role in water balance in all organisms
including aquatic organisms [17]. Aquaglyceroporins may

have additional functions in glycerol metabolism and
cold tolerance, as this is the case in other organisms [32].
In this study, we cloned five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins,
aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l and aqp10. Their function in
water, glycerol and metalloid AsIII, MAsIII and SbIII transport was studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes. All five are efficient water/glycerol transporters. In addition, each of
these aquaglyceroporins actively conducts metalloid
arsenic and antimony transport with one exception that
Aqp3 does not transport antimonite. These properties
indicate that aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l and aqp10 have a
unique importance in normal physiological function as
well as in toxin metabolism.
Metalloid transport by human aquaglyceroporins has
been well characterized. The liver isoform, AQP9, has a
high rate of transport of both AsIII and MAsIII [18]. Intracellular arsenic undergoes a series of oxidative methylations and reductions in many mammals, including
humans. These methylations and oxidations are catalyzed
by the enzyme AS3MT, an arsenic methyl-transferase [33],
and result in the production of the organic mono- and dimethylated arsenic species MAsIII (monomethylarsonous
acid), MAsV (monomethylarsonic acid), DMAsIII (dimethylarsonous acid) and DMAsV (dimethylarsonic acid) [34].
MAsIII is believed to be an early intermediate in the process of arsenic methylation in liver. It has been proposed
that AQP9 facilitates the efflux of MAsIII which is produced in the liver and transported to the blood and eventually urine [14].
Similar to humans, multiple zebrafish aquaglyceroporins
transport both environmental AsIII and intracellularly generated MAsIII. This observation provides a basis to position zebrafish as an excellent model organizm to study
arsenic-associated diseases. Additionally, the zebrafish
model has a number of practical advantages. The
zebrafish is a vertebrate with rapid embryonic development and organ differentiation, and its entire genome has
been sequenced. As such, the zebrafish fills the gap
between microorganisms and mammals. Furthermore, it
has a short generation time that allows for statistical analysis of large groups. Many zebrafish genes exhibit high
sequence similarity to their human homologues. For
example, the zebrafish aquaglyceroporin genes examined
in this study are close homologues to aquaglyceroporin
genes found in humans. Additionally, the zebrafish fish is
native to streams of the Ganges region in eastern India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, where the concentrations of arsenic are of the highest in the world. The
zebrafish commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches,
ponds, and slow-moving to stagnant water bodies, including rice fields, which are often contaminated with arsenic.
It would not be surprising if the zebrafish has adapted to
this environmental exposure by expressing arsenic detoxi-

fication genes. In this study, we demonstrated that five
zebrafish aquaglyceroporins facilitate the uptake of both
AsIII and MAsIII. This is similar to the results found with
human AQP9. These five Aqps were shown to have different tissue localizations. This may partially explain why
multiple adult organs accumulate large amounts of
arsenic. While there is a lack of autopsy data to show the
differential arsenic accumulation in human tissues, studies with rats show that after a single oral dose of arsenite,
arsenic accumulates primarily in the liver and followed by
the kidney [35].
With more mechanistic studies of arsenic metabolism in
zebrafish, it will be possible to clarify how environmental
arsenic is detoxified by aquatic animals. Zebrafish is a
promising model to simulate this process in other fish,
including multiple commercial fish species such as tilapia,
salmon and trout. By examining arsenic metabolism in
zebrafish, we will discover valuable information to evaluate the safety of fish that is consumed as a food. With further studies, it may be possible to produce genetically
modified zebrafish for use as a bio-monitor to evaluate
environmental arsenic contamination.

Conclusion
Our studies demonstrate that five zebrafish aquaglyceroporins actively conduct water and glycerol, which is consistent with functions in osmoregulation. In addition, these
five aquaglyceroporins conduct the metalloids arsenic
and antimony, which is consistent with the observation
that larvae and selected adult organs exhibit significant
arsenic accumulation. Our results indicate that zebrafish
can become a promising animal model to study arsenicassociated cancers and non-cancer-related diseases.
