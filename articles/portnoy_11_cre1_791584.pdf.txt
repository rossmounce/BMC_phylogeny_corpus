Abstract
Background: The identification and characterization of the transcriptional regulatory networks governing the
physiology and adaptation of microbial cells is a key step in understanding their behaviour. One such wide-domain
regulatory circuit, essential to all cells, is carbon catabolite repression (CCR): it allows the cell to prefer some carbon
sources, whose assimilation is of high nutritional value, over less profitable ones. In lower multicellular fungi, the
C2H2 zinc finger CreA/CRE1 protein has been shown to act as the transcriptional repressor in this process.
However, the complete list of its gene targets is not known.
Results: Here, we deciphered the CRE1 regulatory range in the model cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading
fungus Trichoderma reesei (anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina) by profiling transcription in a wild-type and a delta-cre1
mutant strain on glucose at constant growth rates known to repress and de-repress CCR-affected genes. Analysis
of genome-wide microarrays reveals 2.8% of transcripts whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four
experimental conditions: 47.3% of which were repressed by CRE1, whereas 29.0% were actually induced by CRE1,
and 17.2% only affected by the growth rate but CRE1 independent. Among CRE1 repressed transcripts, genes
encoding unknown proteins and transport proteins were overrepresented. In addition, we found CRE1-repression
of nitrogenous substances uptake, components of chromatin remodeling and the transcriptional mediator
complex, as well as developmental processes.
Conclusions: Our study provides the first global insight into the molecular physiological response of a multicellular
fungus to carbon catabolite regulation and identifies several not yet known targets in a growth-controlled
environment.

Background
Many filamentous fungi have developed a predominantly
saprobic lifestyle, in which successful competition with
other microorganisms for the limited resources present in
the environment is the key for survival. To this end
mechanisms evolved that allow a rapid adaption to changing nutrient conditions. One such wide-domain regulatory circuit is carbon catabolite repression (CCR): it allows
the preferred assimilation of carbon sources of high nutritional value over others [1-4]. This is usually achieved

through inhibition of gene expression of enzymes involved
in the catabolism of other carbon sources than the preferred ones. In multicellular ascomycetes, the C2H2 type
transcription factor CreA/CRE1*, which is related to
Mig1/Mig2/Mig3 proteins that mediate glucose repression
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5] and to the mammalian
Krox20/Egr and Wilm’s tumour proteins [6], has been
shown to act as a repressor mediating CCR [7,8]. CreA/
CRE1 binds to the promoters of the respective target
genes via the consensus motif 5’-SYGGRG-3’, whose function in vivo has been shown both in Aspergillus nidulans
and Trichoderma reesei [9-12]. Functional CreA/CRE1
binding sites frequently consist of two closely spaced 5’SYGGRG-3’motifs, and it has been suggested that direct
repression would only occur through such double binding

sites [10,11]. In addition, phosphorylation of a serine in
a conserved short stretch within an acidic domain of
T. reesei CRE1 has been demonstrated to regulate its DNA
binding [13].
Today, a plethora of genes have been shown to be
under control of CreA or CRE1 (reviewed in [7]) but the
mechanisms triggering regulation by CreA/CRE1 are less
well understood. In A. nidulans, regulation by CreA can
be initiated by several so called “repressing” hexoses,
requires their phosphorylation, and is affected by the
growth rate [14-16]. Most studies on CCR in fungi have
been made with gene model systems where CCR functions in the counteraction of gene induction [7]. In contrast, little information is available about which genes
directly respond to a relief from CCR. Since creA/cre1knock out mutants display severe phenotypic changes
such as reduced growth, abnormal hyphal morphology
and sporulation [17,18], such studies are only possible
under carefully controlled conditions. Here we chose to
use chemostat cultures on D-glucose as a carbon source
at two different growth rates (one repressing and one
derepressing [16]) to investigate the genome-wide
changes in gene expression in relation to CRE1 function,
using a Δcre1 recombinant mutant strain of T. reesei and
corresponding control strain.

of Sordariomycetes and therefore name the Trichoderma
CreA orthologue CRE1.

Results
Construction and phenotypic characteristics of a cre1
knock-out strain of T. reesei

We constructed a Δcre1 recombinant strain of T. reesei
QM 9414 by replacing its ORF and part of its 5’-and 3’-nt
regions by a hygromycin B resistance gene [19] under constitutive expression signals. In accordance with NakariSetälä et al. [18], the corresponding knock-out strains
exhibited a reduced radial growth rate on plates, and
formed smaller colonies, fewer aerial hyphae and less
spores. In addition, the Δcre1 strain displayed shorter but
more robust hyphae, that contained a considerably thickened cell wall and less septa (Additional File 1: Figure S1
and Table S1). All these mutant phenotypes were eliminated by retransforming the Δcre1 strain with the cre1
gene, thus proving that they are cre1 specific (data not
shown). We used phenotype microarrays to analyze
whether the above noted reduction in the growth rate is
general or specific for some carbon sources only. The
results showed that - in contrast to the radial growth on
plates - the Δcre1 strain grew significantly slower on only
5 of 95 carbon sources (Glycogen -37 [±4], p = 0.004;
arbutin -27 [±4], p = 0.0006; adenosine -42 [±5], p =
0.022; salicin -34 [±4], p = 0.007; and amygdalin -42 [±6],
p = 0.013), but on the other hand was unaffected on the

majority of them (within ± 25% of variation, Chi square
test p > 0.05; see Additional File 1, Figure S2). However,
increased growth of > 30% of the control, which would be
expected if CRE1 represses growth on a given carbon
source, was observed for 9 carbon sources shown in Additional File 1, Figure S3 (D-galactose +38 [±3], p = 0.0008;
L-sorbose +34 [±3], p = 0.027; D-xylose +48 [±5], p =

p = 0.002; stachyose +45 [±4], p = 0.03; xylitol +37 [±4],
p = 0.017; adonitol +46 [±6], p = 0.0008); and glucuronamide +73 [±3], p = 0.044).
Wide domain regulation by CRE1: experimental design
and properties

We have used whole-genome DNA microarrays with the
goal of identifying the main genes in T. reesei that are controlled by CRE1. Since carbon catabolite repression is
known to be dependent on the growth rate, the microarray
experiments were therefore performed in chemostat cultures at two constant growth rates that were earlier shown
[16] to be carbon repressing (0.07 h-1) and potentially carbon derepressing (0.025 h-1), respectively (Figure 1). After
data pretreatment and normalization, we applied the linear
modeling approach and the Bayes statistics implemented
in the limma R package [20] to our biological replicates as
described in the Methods part. Using these criteria we
retrieved a list of 251 genes whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four experimental conditions.
One of them was cre1 itself (in the parent strain), which is
trivial and was omitted from all further investigations. The
(in part overlapping) occurrence of the truly regulated 250
genes under the four different experimental conditions is
shown in Additional File 1, Figure S4. We used clustering
algorithms (see Methods) to divide them into 9 different
clusters (Figure 2). The effect of CRE1 and its interplay

were compared, i.e. T. reesei QM 9414 (as the reference strain) and a
Δcre1 strain derived from it. In addition, two growth rates (which
have previously been shown to lead to CCR repression and

0.025 h-1 . Two dye switch hybridizations were performed. The

with the growth rate is summarized in Figure 3: 47.3% of
the identified genes are in fact repressed by CRE1, but
29.0% are CRE1 induced and 17.2% are CRE1 independent. In addition, 62.2% of the genes are influenced by the
high growth rate (34.5% induced and 27.7% repressed),
24.9% are derepressed at the low growth rate and 6.4% are
growth rate independent. A complete list of all genes is
given in Additional File 1, Table S2. To confirm these
microarray results, quantitative Real-Time-PCR (qRTPCR) was performed on a subset of the genes belonging to
different clusters. The gene for isocitrate lyase was
included in this set, as its regulation by CRE1-mediated
carbon catabolite repression is known ([16], and references
therein) and its appearance in our dataset confirms that
the growth rates were chosen appropriately. As shown in
Additional File 1, Table S3, these genes that showed differential expression between two or more of the used

Page 4 of 12

conditions in the microarray study were also differentially
expressed in the same direction upon Real Time-PCR analysis. We therefore conclude that the microarray expression ratios indeed reflect differences in the expression of
these genes.
Up and down regulated genes were annotated and categorized as described in the Methods section. The enrichment for the major FunCat categories was assessed in
each cluster, and a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was also done on the whole dataset as further control (see Additional File 1, Tables S4 and S5).
Genes upregulated in the absence of CRE1 function in
T. reesei

As shown in Figure 3, genes which were upregulated in
the Δcre1 mutant strain could be grouped into four
classes: genes that were upregulated in the CRE1

induced, or independent) were obtained from the microarray results (from A to H, and X). The color code indicates the effect of the growth
rate: blue specifies clusters of genes affected only by a high growth rate (dark blue indicates upregulation, light blue downregulation). Purple
specifies the genes upregulated at a low growth rate. Gene clusters whose expression is not influenced by the growth rate are given in orange.
The percentages indicate the fraction of the total genes that is present in the respective cluster and the number of genes in each cluster is

knockout independently of the growth rate (cluster C,
16 genes); genes upregulated in the CRE1 knockout at
high growth rate only (cluster E, 50 genes); genes for
which CRE1 function counteracted an induction at high
growth rate (cluster G, 26 genes); and genes for which
CRE1 function counteracted an induction at low growth
rate (cluster H, 26 genes).
Figure 4a shows the distribution of functional categories (FunCat) within these 4 gene clusters. Genes
which have orthologues in other fungi but for which no
function can be predicted were most abundant in clusters E and G. Genes for carbohydrate degradation were
most abundant in the cluster that groups together the
genes upregulated in the CRE1 knockout at high growth
rate (cluster E). In this cluster, we detected a significant
enrichment of genes involved in cellular transport (see
Table S4). This category was also significantly enriched
in cluster C, which comprises the genes upregulated in
the CRE1 knockout independently of the growth rate.
The nature of cellular transport proteins was diverse in
cluster E, but was dominated by permeases for transport
of nitrogenous compounds in cluster C.
The cluster of the genes upregulated in the CRE1
knockout at high growth rate (E) also exhibited genes
linked to transcription regulation (e.g. the helicase SNF2
involved in chromatin remodeling and the transcriptional
regulator MedA involved in sporulation), as well as PhiA
and RAS1, both participating in hyphal development.
This latter function was also represented with the bys1
transcript in the cluster of genes for which CRE1 function counteracted an induction at high growth rate
(cluster G). This cluster comprised different genes
linked to carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. glycoside

Page 5 of 12

hydrolases and glycoside transferases), as well as hsp30,
a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein
that is induced by several stresses, including glucose
limitation [21].
As found for cluster E, the cluster that groups together
genes for which CRE1 function counteracted an induction at low growth rate (cluster H) exhibited a majority
of genes involved in cellular transport. A membrane protein linked to sporulation, CMP1, has also been found in
this cluster. The significance of the enrichment of these
functional categories has been verified using Gene Ontology annotation (Additional File 1, Table S5).
Genes contained in cluster X exhibited a heterogenous
pattern of gene expression, but their expression was
consistently highest in the Δcre1 strain at low growth
rates, and lowest in the parental strain at high growth
rates. We therefore conclude that genes of this cluster
are also subject to CRE1-dependent CCR. Gene with
putative functions did not reveal any common characteristics. However, we detected the orthologue of
A. nidulans creD (cre4), which encodes a protein with
arrestin and PY motifs known to interact with ubiquitin
ligase [22]. Disruption of creD in A. nidulans confers
partial relief from CCR [23].
Genes downregulated in the absence of CRE1 function in
T. reesei

The expression of a smaller number of genes was
decreased in the Δcre1 strain, either only at the low
(cluster D, 36 genes) or the high growth rate (cluster F,
36 genes), suggesting that CRE1 acts - either directly or
indirectly - positively on these genes. The highest number of genes from the cluster that groups together the

upregulated in the absence of CRE1 function (a), genes downregulated in the absence of CRE1 function (b), and genes regulated only by the
growth rate but not by CRE1 (c).

genes downregulated in the CRE1 knockout at high
growth rate (F) corresponds to genes that encode proteins involved in cellular transport or proteins for which
no function has been characterized (Figure 4b). This
cluster also comprised 4 genes for carbohydrate metabolism, 2 synthases and 2 oxidoreductases involved in secondary metabolite formation, as well as 3 transcription
factors with Zn2Cys6 and bZIP DNA binding domains.
Cluster D, which comprise genes downregulated in the
CRE1 knockout at low growth rate, exhibited a significant enrichment of genes encoding carbohydrate active
enzymes. This cluster also exhibited a broad composition of other various gene categories, those encoding
unknown proteins and compounds involved in cellular
transport being most abundant.

Presence of CRE1-binding sites in the 5’-region of the
identified genes

In order to link the diverse regulatory effects of CRE1
identified in this study to a direct gene target, we looked
for the CRE1 binding pattern 5’-SYGGRG-3’ [10,11] in
sequences 1 kb upstream of the coding region of the
genes that were up-or down-regulated in the microarray
experiments. For each cluster, an average number of sites
per gene was calculated and normalized to the average
number of sites per gene found in the whole T. reesei
genome. Since binding of CreA/CRE1 has been described
to require two adjacent binding sites, or may be clustered
in cis-regulatory element enriched regions (CRERs, [24]),
we also looked for the occurrence of direct or inverted
repeats (motif pairs). The total number of these “paired
motifs” was calculated for each gene, and an average per
gene was again measured for each cluster, and then normalized to the average number in the genome. Two spacing distances between the two motifs were tested, which
were maximally 20 bp or 50 bp. For a value of 50 bp, the
average number of complex motifs per gene for the
whole genome was 0.9 while it was 0.5 for a 20 bp distance value. For each motif pair alone, values ranged
from 0.1 to 0.5. Significance of the differences in average
per cluster compared to the average on the whole genome was assayed with bi-directional Student t-test. The
relatively high frequency of the motifs, combined with
the possible presence of genuine primary and secondary
CreA/CRE1 target, resulted in often high standard deviation, making statistical validation difficult. However,
the results (Table 1) show that the CRE1 binding motif,
was significantly more abundant in the CRE1 repressed
cluster E, and in the CRE1 activated cluster D. This

Genes regulated only by the growth rate but not by CRE1

17.2% of the genes detected in this study displayed an
expression pattern that was independent of CRE1 function, i.e. their expression was different only between the
two growth rates, but not in any direct comparison
between the parent and the Δcre1 mutant strain. 24 of
them were activated (cluster B), whereas 19 (cluster A)
were actually repressed by a high growth rate. A significant enrichment of genes for carbohydrate metabolism
has been detected in the cluster of genes repressed by
the high growth rate (cluster A), whereas the group of
genes induced at high growth rate (cluster B) comprised
the whole set of genes needed to catabolize N-acetylglucosamine to fructose-6-phosphate and exhibited five
genes dedicated to fatty acid metabolism (Figure 4c; see
also Additional File 1, Tables S4 and S5 for enrichment
statistics).

observation was less clear for cluster H (genes for which
CRE1 function counteracted an induction at low growth
rate), while no enrichment was detected for cluster F and
G (genes downregulated in the CRE1 knockout at high
growth rate, and genes for which CRE1 function counteracted an induction at high growth rate, respectively).
While we were not able to statistically validate this, a
trend in enrichment is visible for cluster C, which groups
together genes that were upregulated in the CRE1 knockout independently of the growth rate. These results suggest that clusters D, E and maybe C are enriched in
direct CRE1 targets while clusters F and H are indirect
results of the CRE1 regulation. In support of this conclusion, the values obtained for the CRE1 independent
genes contained in clusters A and B were in the range of
(or even below) the genomic average.
We also looked for the presence of nucleotide motifs
that are shared by genes regulated by CRE1, as described
in the Methods section. One of the detected motif using
the RSA-Tools software (5’-SAGGGRG-3’) was indeed
significantly enriched in clusters D and E (i.e. the clusters
most enriched in CRE1 motifs). This motif is otherwise
found at least once at a 57% frequency in all T. reesei
promoters.

Discussion
The carbon catabolite regulator CreA/CRE1 is one of a
few wide-domain master regulators identified in multicellular fungi, and has been shown to govern the repression of genes involved in polysaccharide degradation
and in the utilization of ethanol and amino acids as carbon sources [7,8]. However, the major drawback inherent to these studies is that the growth rate was not
controlled. Using chemostat cultures, we show here that
- depending of the gene considered - the function of T.
reesei CRE1 can be dependent on the growth rate, thus
implying that the physiology of the fungal cell does
affect the function of CRE1 in different ways for different genes. In addition, we show that in 29.0% of the
detected genes, CRE1 actually activates (rather than
represses) their expression. This number is similar to
CreA-activated genes found in A. nidulans, although the
latter investigated only a subset of the genome [25]. Our
data therefore illustrate that the function of CRE1 is
more complex than previously thought and clearly goes
beyond CCR alone. CRE1 should therefore rather be
considered a master regulator of carbon metabolism
that adjusts gene regulation in relation to the rate of
glucose assimilation.
Since the genome of T. reesei contains 9,129 predicted
genes [26], the 250 highly differentially regulated genes
we detected account for 2.8%, which may be considered
only a low percentage. However, this study did not
detect those genes where CRE1 interferes with the

Page 7 of 12

induction but not with basal transcription (e.g. cellulases and hemicellulases, ethanol catabolism [7], see
below); the number of genes actually controlled by
CRE1 is therefore probably larger and in many cases
carbon-source-dependent. In this context, it is interesting to note that an orthologue of Med2, a component
of the mediator complex that is conserved in all eukaryotes [27], was found to be repressed by CRE1. This
protein complex mediates signals between enhancerbound factors (activators) and the core transcriptional
machinery. In S. cerevisiae, Med2 - together with Gal11
- has been shown to mediate the strongest activations
[28], thus making them being logical targets for regulation. The identification of T. reesei med2 as a CCRrepressed gene may hence be interpreted as an effective
means by which the cell controls expression of a broad
set of genes when a drop-down in the growth rate renders their induced expression uneconomic.
207 of the genes identified in this study were in fact
regulated by CRE1, whereas the other 43 only influenced by the growth rate independently of CRE1 function. 118 of the CRE1-regulated genes appeared to be
repressed by CRE1. Besides unknown proteins, genes
encoding membrane permeases represent the highest
portion indicating that T. reesei carbon catabolite
repression acts preferentially at the entry of substrates
into the cell. Carbon catabolite repression of a high-affinity hexose permease is known in A. nidulans [29], and
constitutes a mechanism by which fungi can retrieve
even traces of high value carbon sources at a high rate.
Interestingly, most of the permeases transporting nitrogenous compounds were regulated by CRE1 in a
growth-rate independent manner, suggesting that proteins and their degradation products are among the preferred substitutes for fast metabolizable carbohydrates.
A similar increase in amino acid uptake upon CCR has
been reported for S. cerevisiae [30], but the effect was
MIG1 independent in this case. Since the natural habitat
of T. reesei (decaying wood) is poor in nitrogen but also
in repressing carbon sources, this mechanism may
enable the fungus to recruit available nitrogenous compounds at an enhanced rate.
There is a general believe that the transcription of
genes encoding extracellular hydrolases (CAZome) are
repressed by CRE1. Although this was in fact shown for
several such genes in this study, they constituted only a
very minor portion of the T. reesei CAZome (200 genes).
Particularly, although the regulation of e.g. cellulolytic
and xylanolytic enzymes by CRE1 has been demonstrated
earlier [10,18], none of these genes was strongly upregulated in the Δcre1 mutant. These data are in agreement
with the findings that CRE1 mediated carbon catabolite
repression mainly affects their induction but not their
basal expression [31].

We and others have previously shown that loss-offunction of CRE1 or CreA leads to an alteration in
nucleosome repositioning upon addition of glucose
[32-34]. Our detection of snf2 as a gene subject to
repression by CRE1 at a high growth rate offers an
explanation for this finding: Snf2 is a component of the
yeast Swi/Snf multisubunit chromatin remodelling complex [35], one of the cellular mechanisms altering chromatin structure by modulating DNA-histone
interactions [36]. Swi/Snf is required for the transcriptional regulation of about 5% of the total yeast genome
[37] and Snf2 plays an essential role in it by associating
with nucleosomes two helical turns from the dyad axis
[38].
It has also previously been reported that a loss-of-function mutation in creA/cre1 leads to an altered morphology
and an impairment in sporulation. We identified several
genes that could be responsible for the alterations in morphology in the Δcre1 strain: a central position may be
played by RAS1, a small GTPase that was repressed by
CRE1 only at high growth rates but not by the growth rate
itself. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
Ras1 regulates two distinct pathways: one that controls
mating through the Byr2-mitogen-activated protein kinase
cascade and one that signals through Scd1-Cdc42 to maintain elongated cell morphology. In the filamentous fungi
Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus fumigatus, the RAS1/
RasA orthologue has been reported to regulate morphology, asexual development and cell wall integrity [39,40].
Also, S. cerevisiae RAS1 is regulated by glucose [41]. It is
therefore possible that RAS1 is responsible for the phenotypic consequences of a cre1 loss-of-function, and the
other genes may only indirectly be affected via ras1. In
fact, three of the genes associated with morphology or
sporulation (encoding PAG1, MedA and a phosphoproteoglycan, respectively) were repressed by CRE1 also at
the high growth rate and the effect of CRE1 could therefore be via RAS1. Pag1 encodes a protein associated with
protein kinase Cbk1p and that is required for cell morphogenesis and proliferation in S. cerevisiae [42]. MedA
encodes an orthologue of Fusarium oxysporum REN1,
Aspergillus nidulans MedA and Magnaporthe grisea ACR1
[43] that are transcription regulators involved in conidiogenesis, and whose loss-of-function leads to abnormal
conidiophores and rod-shaped, conidium-like cells. Two
other genes (encoding orthologues of the Blastomyces
yeast phase specific extracellular protein BYS1, and the A.
fumigatus cell wall protein PhiA) were affected by cre1
also at the high growth rate. This regulation under conditions where ras1 is repressed implies that their expression
is independent of the CRE1 effects on ras1 and thus likely
direct. Both genes contain a paired CRE1 binding motif in
their promoter, which would support this assumption.
Our data suggest that the interplay between CRE1 and

Page 8 of 12

RAS1 may be an important factor regulating developmental processes in T. reesei.
An investigation of the occurrence of the established
CRE1 target sequence 5’-SYGGRG-3’ in the regulated
gene set confirmed its relevance to CCR, as 2 clusters out
of the 6 that were regulated by CRE1 were also enriched
in this CRE1 consensus site. In addition, an even higher
enrichment was found for motif pairs biased toward
CRERs (Cis Regulated Enriched Regions). These findings
are in accordance with previous results showing that only
a double CRE1 target is functionally in vivo [10,11]. In
addition, we also identified an additional GC-rich (5’SAGGGRGR-3’) consensus to be overrepresented in
CRE1 regulated promoters. This motif has not been previously described in filamentous fungi or any other
organism, and we therefore do not know which proteins,
if any, bind to it. However, a study on motifs in Mig1/
Mig2/Mig3 regulated promoters in S. cerevisiae [5]
detected a 5’-GGGAGG-3’ motif, which is completely
covered by the 5’-SAGGGRGR-3’ sequence. The authors
reasoned that the 5’-GGGAGG-3’ motif may bind a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in phosphate metabolism. However, none of the genes of our
study that show an enrichment of the 5’-SAGGGRGR-3’
sequence in their 5’ nontranslated sequences, are
involved in phosphate metabolism. Notably, the presence
or absence of the 5’-SYGGRG-3’ motifs (or any other
motif) in the promoters of regulated genes did not correlate with the way they are regulated by CRE1 (i.e. with a
up- or a down-regulation).

Conclusions
Carbon catabolite repression by CreA/CRE1 in filamentous fungi has mostly been studied in relation to the utilization of alternative carbon sources of either industrial
interest (e.g. plant biomass components), or genetic
model systems such as ethanol and proline catabolism
[7,8,10,11], but these studies have so far not revealed
the impact of this regulator on the physiology of the
fungus in its natural environment. Here, we have identified new targets for T. reesei CRE1 and also dissected
the dependence of their regulation on the rate of growth
(equivalent to the nutritional condition) of the fungus.
Noteworthy, a predominant effect of CCR seems to act
at the transporter level and on the use of nitrogen substrates. Several genes that could explain morphological
changes and sporulation behavior were also affected.
Additionally, these growth-controlled environments also
reflect some industrial conditions that can be used with
fungi. The data and genes obtained will be a valuable
basis for future attempts towards understanding the role
of carbon nutrition for saprobic fungi. Finally, the strategy used in this paper may be useful also in further studies of other wide domain regulators in fungi.

Methods
Fungal strains and cultivation conditions

H. jecorina QM 9414 and the Δcre1 strain derived from it
(see below) were maintained on malt extract agar. Constant-mass, chemostat-type continuous cultivations were
performed in a 2.5 l glass bioreactor with a working
volume of 2 l, essentially as described earlier [31]. The
feeding medium contained 3 g l-1 glucose, a concentration low enough to make the culture carbon-limited.
Steady-state of the cultures was established when no
changes in biomass dry weight were observed in three
successive samples taken over a period of three residence
times (= the reciprocal value of the dilution rate). In
D-glucose limited cultures, the steady-state biomass concentration was 1.46 ± 0.21 g l-1, irrespective of the dilution rate. The residual steady-state concentrations of
D-glucose in the medium were 0.08-0.10 mM. The calculated growth yield (grams of biomass formed per gram of
carbon source consumed) was between 46 and 49% for
all cultures, which correlates well with our previous studies [34]. Two subsequently achieved, independent
steady-states were sampled and analysed for each dilution
rate and fungal strain.
Construction of a cre1 knock-out strain of T. reesei QM
9414

A cre1 deletion vector was constructed by using the
double joint PCR technique [44]. Primers used are given
in Additional File 1, Table S6. Oligonucleotides cre5’F
and Cre5’Rtailhph were used for the promoter region,
cre3’R and Cre3’Ftailhph for the terminator region, and
M1LHhph and M2LHhph for the hygromycin B expression cassette [45] amplification. The outside primers
(cre5’F and cre3’R) were used for the amplification of
the whole deletion fragment in a fusion PCR assay. The
resulting fragment was subsequently cloned in pGEMTEasy resulting in pΔcre1hph. The cre1 deletion fragment
was released from plasmid pΔcre1hph by a NotI restriction digest. The respective 5.3 kb fragment was eluted
with a QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN GmbH)
and was used to transform protoplasts of the strain QM
9414 as described by Gruber et al. [46]. Transformants
were selected on malt extract medium containing hygromycin (50 μg/ml). 40 transformants were selected from
the transformation plates and transferred to small malt
extract plates containing hygromycin (50 μg/ml). 25
transformants exhibited a stable phenotype and their
respective spores were plated on malt extract medium
containing hygromycin (50 μg/ml) and Triton X-100
(0.1%) to isolate single spore colonies. The cre1 loci of
the six transformants and the parental strain QM 9414
as a control were amplified with the primers cre5’F and
cre3’R using the following PCR conditions: 2 min of

Page 9 of 12

denaturation (94°C), were followed by 32 cycles of 45 s
denaturation (94°C), 45 s of annealing (55°C), and 6 min
of elongation (72°C), concluded by 7 min at 72°C. Genomic DNA of strain QM 9414 yielded a fragment of
4.3 kb, while homologous insertion of the deletion vector lead to an increase of the fragment size to 5.3 kb
fragment in cre1 deleted strains. For the retransformation of the Δcre1 strain the cre1 gene was amplified
with oligonucleotides cre1retrafo1 and cre1retrafo2,
which are located about 1500 bp upstream and 700 bp
downstream of the coding region, respectively. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Transformation was performed with the A. nidulans amdS as
marker [47]. Successful retransformation of the Δcre1
strain with plasmid pcre1amdS was verified by PCR
amplification of the cre1 gene and resulted in colonies,
which showed a QM 9414 growth phenotype.
Nucleic acid isolation and microarray hybridizations

Fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed with
distilled cold water, frozen and ground under liquid
nitrogen. For extraction of genomic DNA, plasmid DNA
and RNA, purification kits (Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit, PureYield Plasmid Midiprep System and SV
Total RNA Isolation System, respectively, all from Promega) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Standard methods were used for electrophoresis,
blotting and hybridization of nucleic acids. The microarray data and the related protocols are available at the
GEO web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under
accession number: GSE21072. Briefly, the fungal RNAs
of each experiment were reverse-transcribed and
labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 dye using the indirect labelling
procedure and dye-switch on two biological replicates.
We then hybridized 1 μg of labelled cDNA with the 1 ×
244k T. reesei DNA chip manufactured by Agilent and
designed using the Teloenn software as described previously [48]. Arrays were read using a GenePix 4000B
scanner (Molecular Devices) and signals analysed by the
GenePix Pro 6.1 software. Spots when the “align blocks”
algorithm was not able to locate features on the slide
were flagged “not found”. A spot was labelled as “detectable” when the raw mean intensities were above the
background. Data pretreatment was applied on each
result file to discard GenePix flag and saturating spots.
The data were normalized without background subtraction by the global Lowess method performed with the
Goulphar software [49]. The background threshold was
calculated by adding two standard deviations to the
average intensity of all the “not found” features. For
each probe the log2 hybridization ratio was linked to
genome annotation coming from the JGI website. The
final log2 ratio for each transcript was obtained by

Portnoy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:269
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/269

averaging the “detectable” hybridization values from all
probes located inside the coding sequence on the
matching strand. Transcripts with no or only one probe
marked as “detectable” were discarded from further analysis. For the two biological replicates on each four
experiments we applied on the pretreated results the linear modeling approach implemented by lmFit (using
each replicate as independent variable) and the empirical
Bayes statistics implemented by eBayes both from the
limma R package [20]. We selected the list of statistically regulated genes with an adjusted p-value, using the
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction, lower than
0.05. Finally we kept as the most highly regulated targets
only transcripts with a final log2 hybridization ratio
greater than 2 or lower than -2.
Real Time PCR quantification of T. reesei transcripts

DNase treated (DNase I, RNase free; Fermentas) RNA (5
μg), obtained from T. reesei QM 9414 and the delta-cre1
strain grown in chemostat cultures (vide supra), was reverse
transcribed with the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Kit
(Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with
a combination of the provided oligo-dT and random hexamer primers. All real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed on a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) iCycler IQ. For the
reaction the IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) was prepared for 25 μl assays with standard MgCl2
concentration (3 mM) and a final primer concentration of
100 nM each. Primers used are given in Additional File 1,
Table S7. All assays were carried out in 96-well plates,
which were covered with optical tape. The amplification
protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step (3 min at
95°C) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (15 sec at
95°C), annealing (20 sec at 57°C) and elongation (10 sec at
72°C). Determination of the PCR efficiency was performed
using triplicate reactions from a dilution series of cDNA (1,
0.1, 10-2 10-3). Amplification efficiency was then calculated
from the given slopes in the IQ5 Optical system Software
v2.0. Expression ratios were calculated using REST© Software [50].
Biolog phenotype microarray experiments

Growth of T. reesei QM 9414 and two Δcre1 independent transformed clones from it on 95 carbon sources
was investigated using Biolog® phenotype microarrays
essentially as described by Druzhinina et al. [51]. Biomass concentration (OD750) was measured after 96 h of
growth. One-way or main-effect analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) were used to compare the growth of selected
strains on individual carbon sources. Tukey’s honest significant difference (Tukey HSD) test as implemented in
STATISTICA 6.1 was used for post hoc comparisons to
detect the contribution of each variable to the main
effect of the F test resulting from the ANOVA. The

Page 10 of 12

significance of increased growth on selected carbon
sources was tested by the Chi-square test. Only p-values
< 0.05 were considered as significant.
Cluster analysis of microarray results

Clustering analysis was done using the MultiExperiment
Viewer software [52]. An expression matrix was built from
all the genes sorted as strongly regulated for the four conditions we hybridized. From this matrix we selected the
expression profiles corresponding to the main behaviour
categories we expected which are: CRE1 repressed genes at
high growth rate (GR), CRE1 induced genes at high GR,
genes induced by CRE1 at low GR, genes repressed by
CRE1 at low GR, genes repressed or induced by GR alone,
CRE1 repressed genes alone and CRE1 induced genes
alone. Then each of these gene expression groups was
extended using the Pavlidis Template Matching method
[53] fixating the absolute R threshold when all gene
included in the group used as template are retrieved.
Genes not classified in one of the groups where clustered
using the Clustering Affinity Search Technique [54] procedure using the Pearson correlation coefficient and a 0.8
threshold. From the clusters obtained, two of them could
be associated to already detected groups. Finally a hierarchical clustering was performed on each expression groups
using Euclidian distance and the average linkage method.
From this clustering each gene expression group was separated in two subclusters using the two more external nodes
of each tree, resulting in clusters A to H and X.
Gene identification and functional prediction

Genes were first identified according to their ID number.
In the case of genes that were either poorly or not yet
annotated, they were subjected to BLASTX at NCBI, and
all hits with E < -50 retrieved and aligned. Proteins with
>75% identity and over >90% of the amino acid sequence
in other fungal taxa were considered to be their potential
orthologues, and this hypothesis tested by phylogenetic
analysis. Proteins that fell outside these criteria were
termed “unknown proteins”. Proteins with < 25% of identity and less then 75% of the size of the best hits were
considered “unique”. Identified proteins were categorized
according to the Functional Catalogue (FunCat [55])
using the T. reesei genome database implemented in the
Pedant server of the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences [56]. For each of the FunCat categories
selected we calculated for each gene cluster the enrichment ratio compared to the whole FunCat annotation
and we used the hypergeometric distribution to compute
the statistical p-value associated to this enrichment.
We performed a whole enrichment analysis for all the
171 annotated genes (among 250) detected as highly regulated targets using the Gene Ontology annotation of T. reesei from the JGI web site. We calculated the significance of

Portnoy et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:269
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/269

the enrichment ratio using the hypergeometric distribution
and the p-value where adjusted for multiple test using the
Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. There are 4,977
genes annotated with at least one Gene Ontology term
among the 9,129 genes from the T. reesei genome.

Promoter sequence analysis

All analyses were performed with the RSAT software suite
[24]. Promoter sequences were obtained using the
“retrieve sequence” algorithm, with -1000 to -1 coordinates input and the “noORF” option unchecked. Motifs
were searched using the “DNA Pattern Matching” algorithm, with the “prevent overlapping matches” parameter
checked. For a given set of genes (any cluster, or whole
genome), the total number of motifs found was collected
and an average number of sites per gene was calculated.
Finally this number was normalized to the average number
of sites in the whole genome. Significance in mean values
between cluster and whole genomes groups were assessed
using a Student t-test with Microsoft Excel “ttest” function, using bidirectional and heteroscedastic (unequal variances) options. P-values of 0.1 and 0.05 were considered
(and indicated in Table 1). For search of new regulation
motifs, the “oligo analysis” and “Dyad Analysis” algorithms
were used for each cluster or group of clusters. To ensure
the selection of statistically relevant motifs, for each condition tested (Dyad, 5, 6, 7 or 8 words length), three different
random gene groups of the same size were assessed in parallel (using the “random gene selection” algorithm). Only
motifs with scores higher than the highest score obtained
with the corresponding control set +0.5 were considered.
This usually resulted in a 1.5 score selection threshold.
Selected motifs were validated with enrichment in clusters
and statistical tests described above.
