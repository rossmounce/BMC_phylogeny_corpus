Abstract
Background: Regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a crucial role in many
developmental and physiological processes in plants. miRNAs act to repress expression of their
target genes via mRNA cleavage or translational repression. Dozens of miRNA families have been
identified in rice, 21 of which are conserved between rice and Arabidopsis. miR172 is a conserved
miRNA family which has been shown to regulate expression of APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription
factors in Arabidopsis and maize. The rice genome encodes five AP2-like genes predicted to be
targets of miR172. To determine whether these rice AP2-like genes are regulated by miR172 and
investigate the function of the target genes, we studied the effect of over-expressing two members
of the miR172 family on rice plant development.
Results: Analysis of miR172 expression showed that it is most highly expressed in late vegetative
stages and developing panicles. Analyses of expression of three miR172 targets showed that
SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) and Os03g60430 have high expression in developing panicles.
Expression of miR172 was not inversely correlated with expression of its targets although miR172mediated cleavage of SNB was detected by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Overexpression of miR172b in rice delayed the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem,
and resulted in floral and seed developmental defects, including changes to the number and identity
of floral organs, lower fertility and reduced seed weight. Plants over-expressing miR172b not only
phenocopied the T-DNA insertion mutant of SNB but showed additional defects in floret
development not seen in the snb mutant. However SNB expression was not reduced in the
miR172b over-expression plants.
Conclusions: The phenotypes resulting from over-expression of miR172b suggests it represses
SNB and at least one of the other miR172 targets, most likely Os03g60430, indicating roles for
other AP2-like genes in rice floret development. miR172 and the AP2-like genes had overlapping
expression patterns in rice and their expression did not show an obvious negative correlation.
There was not a uniform decrease in the expression of the AP2-like miR172 target mRNAs in the
miR172b over-expression plants. These observations are consistent with miR172 functioning via
translational repression or with expression of the AP2-like genes being regulated by a negative
feedback loop.

Background
microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory small RNAs that
have important roles in regulating development and stress
responses in plants [1-4]. They repress gene expression by
targeting cognate messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for cleavage
or translational repression [5,6]. Since the identification
of the first rice miRNAs, based on sequence conservation
with Arabidopsis [7], many new rice miRNAs have been
identified using high-throughput small RNA sequencing
approaches; the majority of these newly identified miRNAs are rice-specific [8-12]. miR172 is conserved in
higher plants and has been shown to regulate expression
of a sub-group of APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription factors that contain two AP2 domains in Arabidopsis
[13,14], tobacco [6] and maize [15-17].
In Arabidopsis, miR172 serves as a negative regulator of
AP2 to specify floral organ identity. Over-expression of
miR172 causes floral homeotic phenotypes similar to ap2
loss-of-function mutants [18], such as conversion of
sepals and petals into carpels, and reduction of stamen
numbers [14]. Expression of a miR172-resistant version of
AP2 increases stamen number [19]. Arabidopsis miR172
also acts as a repressor of the AP2-like genes, TARGET OF
EAT 1 (TOE1), TOE2 and TOE3 to promote early flowering [13,20]. miR172-mediated cleavage of mRNAs of
these target genes has been detected [21], but there is
strong evidence to suggest that the primary mode of
repression of these target genes by miR172 is translational
inhibition [13,14]. In turn, the transcription of miR172
target genes is under direct or indirect feedback regulation
by their protein products [21].
In maize, expression of GLOSSY15 (GL15), an AP2-like
gene with an mRNA targeted for cleavage by miR172, is
gradually down-regulated during the early stages of vegetative development due to a progressive increase of
miR172 levels, promoting the juvenile-to-adult transition
[17]. Another two AP2-like paralogs, INDETERMINATE
SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and SISTER OF INDETERMINATE
SPIKELET1 (SID1), play multiple roles in inflorescence
architecture in maize. Loss-of-function mutants of IDS1
lose spikelet determinacy and generate multiple florets
[22]. No mutant phenotype has been observed in single
sid1 mutants, but ids1 sid1 double mutants produce fewer
tassel branches and generate multiple bracts in place of
florets [16]. The ids1 sid1 double mutants rescue the phenotypic defects of tasselseed4 (ts4), a loss-of-function
mutant of MIR172e [16], one of the five MIR172 genes in
maize. This result suggests that both IDS1 and SID1 are
targets of miR172. It has been shown that IDS1 and SID1
are regulated at the level of translation and transcript stability, respectively [15,16], indicating that a single miRNA
can act in different ways on closely related mRNAs. The
maize flowering-time gene ZmRap2.7 is closely related to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/149

Arabidopsis TOE1. Over-expression of ZmRap2.7 results
in delayed flowering, while knock-down of this gene leads
to early flowering [23]. However, it is not known whether
or not ZmRap2.7 is also regulated by miR172 as TOE1 is
in Arabidopsis.
The rice miR172 family contains four members
(MIR172a-d), which are predicted to target five AP2-like
genes,
Os03g60430,
Os04g55560,
Os05g03040,
Os06g43220 and Os07g13170 [ref [24] and this study].
Os07g13170 (SNB - SUPERNUMERARY BRACT) has been
shown to be required for the correct timing of the transition from spikelet to floral meristem and for determination of floral organ identity. The T-DNA insertion mutant
of SNB generates additional bracts (equivalent to rudimentary glumes) before development of a floret and also
shows defects in floral organ development [24]. SNB,
Os03g60430, Os05g03040 and Os06g43220 are the putative rice orthologs of maize SID1, IDS1, ZmRap2.7 and
GL15, respectively [16].
We characterized the expression of miR172 and its putative AP2-like target genes in rice and did not find inversely
correlated expression patterns although at least three of
the AP2-like mRNAs were found to be cleavage targets of
miR172, suggesting roles of miR172 via transcriptional
and translation repression with the latter as a possible predominant mode of action of miR172 in rice. To investigate the functions of the AP2-like genes, we studied the
effect of elevated expression of miR172 on rice development. Over-expression of miR172b recapitulates the phenotypes of snb and also gives rise to additional
developmental defects not seen in snb. These results suggest that SNB and at least one of the other AP2-like target
genes are down-regulated in plants over-expressing
miR172b, indicating that other members of the AP2-like
gene family also have roles in rice floret development.

RESULTS
Expression profiles of miR172 and its target genes
To determine where miR172 and its target transcripts are
expressed during rice development, we analyzed miR172
expression by RNA gel blot and expression of the AP2-like
target mRNAs by qRT-PCR in various tissues. The mature
miR172a-d sequences differ only in their 5' and 3' bases
and therefore hybridization with a miR172a probe is
likely to detect expression of all mature miR172
sequences. In wild-type plants, miR172 expression varied
considerably between organs and developmental stages.
Mature miR172 accumulation increased significantly in
leaves but not in roots as plants grew, reaching a maximum in the flag leaf (Figure 1A). Similar expression patterns of miR172 have also been observed in vegetative
tissues of Arabidopsis and maize [13,17], suggesting that
miR172 has a conserved role during vegetative develop-

ment. In reproductive tissues, miR172 was consistently
expressed although its abundance reduced gradually during panicle development (Figure 1B). Expression of
miR172 was below the detection limit in 10 DAF (daysafter-fertilization) grains (Figure 1B). Higher expression
of miR172 in later stage vegetative tissues and developing
young panicles is consistent with a role in regulating the
timing of floret initiation and development in rice.

The abundance of intact transcripts of miR172 target
genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR using primer pairs spanning the miR172 cleavage sites. Expression of SNB
(Os07g13170) was highest in developing panicles (<4 cm
in length), in which differentiation of the spikelet and floral organs is progressing; expression of SNB was also high
in roots from 10-leaf plants (Figure 2A). Os03g60430 was
highly expressed in developing panicles and also in young
seedlings (2L-S) (Figure 2B). In contrast expression of
Os05g03040 was highest in young seedlings and roots
(Figure 2C). All these three genes had a very low expression level in embryo, endosperm and pericarp of 10 DAF
grains (Figure 2A, B, C). Expression of SNB and
Os03g60430 showed an inverse correlation with the abundance of miR172 in two-leaf shoots, leaf four and leaf ten,
but generally the expression of miR172 was not inversely
correlated with the expression of its targets in the tissues
analyzed (Figure 2A, B, C). We were unable to specifically

amplify Os06g43220 even though several primer combinations were tried; this could be a result of very low
expression (supported by the relatively low number of
ESTs found in both japonica and indica rice; data not
shown). We were unable to quantify Os04g55560 expression as the gene-specific product was always accompanied
by a non-specific product. These expression profiles support previous results showing that SNB has a role in controlling spikelet determinacy and floret development [24],
and also suggest that Os03g60430 could play a role in floret development.
miR172-mediated cleavage of target genes
miR172 has been shown to cleave AP2 and AP2-like target
mRNAs in Arabidopsis [13,14,21] and maize [15,17], but
is thought to act predominantly through translational
repression [13-15]. To determine whether the five putative targets of miR172 in rice are cleaved by miR172, 5'
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis was
performed using RNA isolated from two-leaf stage shoots,
1-10 DAF grains and booting panicles (BP). Cleavage of
Os04g55560 was detected in a mixed sample of shoot and
grain as well as in booting panicles; cleavage of
Os06g43220 was only detected in the mixed sample with
a low frequency (most likely contributed by young seedlings as accumulation of miR172 was below the detection
limit in 10 DAF grains); and cleavage of SNB was only
detected in booting panicles. No cleavage was detected for
Os03g60430 or Os05g03040 in any of the samples analyzed (Figure 3). These results suggested tissue- or celltype-specific expression of miR172 and/or its target genes.

Over-expression of miR172b delays the transition from
spikelet meristem to floral meristem
We generated transgenic plants expressing the stem-loop
precursors of miR172a and miR172b, transcribed by the
maize ubiquitin promoter. Elevated levels of miR172
were detected in these miR172 over-expression plants,
particularly in plants transformed with pre-MIR172b (Figure 4). Transgenic plants over-expressing miR172b
showed normal vegetative growth and heading time, but
the inflorescence (panicle) of the transformed plants was
smaller, producing the half number of primary branches
of the untransformed wild-type (Table 1). A wild-type
spikelet consists of a single floret and two subtending
pairs of bract-like structures - a pair of rudimentary
glumes and a pair of empty glumes (Figure 5A, J). Spikelets of plants over-expressing miR172b were generated
from primary or secondary branches as in wild-type, but
the majority of spikelets were abnormal and showed variable defects in floral organs. The common phenotypes of
the mutated spikelets were that more than two, and in
extreme cases as many as 20, bract-like structures were
generated before transition to floral development (Figure
5B to 5H); in some cases no obvious floral organs were
produced (Figure 5I). The majority of these spikelets
lacked a pair of empty glumes (compare Figure 5A with
Figure 5B to 5H; Table 2). Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) showed that the lower part of the rudimentary
glumes in the wild-type plant had round projections and
small trichomes (Figure 5J). In the miR172b over-expression plants, similar round projections coated the surface
of the bract-like structures though fewer trichomes were
seen (Figure 5K), suggesting that the additional bract-like
structures in the miR172b over-expression lines have the
same identity as rudimentary glumes. This result suggests
that reproductive development of plants over-expressing
miR172b was not affected until the formation of the
spikelet meristem, but the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem was delayed, leading to the reiteration of bract-like structures.
Over-expression of miR172b reduces fertility and seed
weight
Plants over-expressing miR172b showed significant floret
defects and reduced fertility (0-44.1%) compared to wildtype. Based on the number of deformed spikelets and
degree of fertility, plants over-expressing miR172b could
be grouped into strong (Figure 5M) and moderate (Figure
5N, O, P) phenotypes. Plants with <10% fertility and
>10% severely degenerated spikelets were defined as having a strong phenotype, with the remainder classified as
moderate phenotype plants. Spikelets without obvious
floral organs (Figure 5I), or with several layers of small
lemma- and palea-like structures but without distinguishable internal reproductive organs (Figure 5H) were classed
as severely degenerated spikelets. The percentage of

severely degenerated spikelets was as high as 45% in some
strong phenotype plants. In addition, the remaining
spikelets of strong phenotype plants were also significantly deformed (Figure 5M), with phenotypes including
multiple layers of lemma and palea (Figure 5C, D),
twisted lemma and palea (Figure 5E), degeneration of
either lemma or palea (Figure 5F), or leaf-like structures
replacing lemma and palea (Figure 5G). All of these
deformed spikelets were sterile, and as a consequence,
most strong phenotype plants were completely sterile.
Some strong phenotype plants set a small number of fertile spikelets but none of them had a wild-type appearance
(Table 1). On average, the moderate phenotype plants
had ~6% severely degenerated spikelets and ~40% fertility
(Table 1), but less than 5% of the fertile spikelets were
essentially normal, i.e. with a pair of empty glumes and
normal lemma and palea. Analysis of miR172 expression
showed that plants with the strongest phenotypic aberra-

tions had the highest expression levels of miR172
(Figure 4).
The common features of fertile but abnormal spikelets
were that they had four or fewer lemma- and palea-like
structures, and that part of or even the whole of the grain
was naked due to failure of the lemma and palea to close
after flowering (Figure 5R, S, T) or because of degeneration of these structures (Figure 5O, P). The weight of these
seeds was reduced compared to wild-type seeds (Table 1),
with the most naked seeds showing the greatest reduction
(Figure 5S). This suggests that closing of lemma and palea
may be important for optimal grain filling and maturation in rice.

and a carpel with two stigmas is called floret (Figure 6A).
Wild-type lodicules have a wide base, a rough surface and
a narrow apex (Figure 6B, C, D). When flowering, the floret opens due to swelling of the lodicules, and closes after
a few minutes (depending on temperature and humidity)
due to shrinking of the lodicules. In plants over-expressing miR172b, florets with five or more layers of lemma
and palea could not open due to the tightly closed lemma
and palea. Florets that did not completely close up after
flowering had altered numbers and/or morphology of
lodicules. One (due to fusion of two lodicules; Figure 6E,
F, G) to as many as eight lodicules were observed (Table
2). Multiple lodicules were arranged in one (Figure 6H to
6K) or two (Figure 6I, J) whorls, with similar surface features to those of wild-type but swollen (Figure 6H), or
elongated significantly and converted into a structure similar to the palea marginal region (Figure 6I, J, K). In the
case of two whorls of lodicules, usually only the lodicule
in the outer whorl was converted (Figure 6J). In the converted lodicules, two edges of the base section retained
their original identity (Figure 6L), resulting in a mosaic
floral organ. The most frequently observed mosaic floral
organ was a lodicule base with an anther fused to the elongated lodicule apex (Figure 6M). Occasionally, a mosaic
organ with a lodicule base and an anther top was observed
at the innermost whorl of the floret, in which the mosaic
organ replaced the carpel and the identities of two stigmas
were also converted (Figure 6N, O). In some florets, a
stigma was partially converted into an anther (Figure 6P).
These results suggest that timing and/or positioning of the
floral organ meristems are interrupted by over-expression
of miR172b, indicating that a proper expression of
miR172 target genes is important in specification of floral
organ identities.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/149

Stamens were also frequently altered in plants overexpressing miR172b. All florets of the strong phenotype
plants and approximately half the florets of the moderate
phenotype plants had less than the six stamens found in
wild-type (Table 2). Usually, anthers of plants overexpressing miR172b were slightly smaller than those of
wild-type, although no other obvious defects were
observed. The carpel was the most stable floral organ, with
<5% of spikelets developing two carpels (Figure 6R; Table
2). In some spikelets both carpels were fertilized and
developed into normal-looking grains (Figure 5T). Occasionally, three stigmas were observed instead of two (Figure 6Q). Ectopic florets were found in ~10% of spikelets,
a few of these developed incomplete internal floral organs
(Figure 6S, T), none were fertile.
Plants transformed with pre-MIR172a did not show any
altered phenotypes (data not shown), even though
miR172 accumulated to a higher level than in wild-type
plants (Figure 4).
SNB mRNA abundance is not reduced in miR172b overexpression plants
The phenotype observed in miR172b over-expression
plants is consistent with reduced SNB function during
panicle development. As SNB is cleaved by miR172 a
reduced accumulation of SNB mRNA would be expected
in miR172b over-expression plants. However, we
observed more SNB mRNA accumulating in early stage
panicles in these plants (Figure 7A). A similar effect was
observed for Os05g03040 mRNA (Figure 7C). Reduced
accumulation of the Os03g60430 mRNA was observed in
panicles between 0.5 cm and 4 cm (Figure 7B), suggesting
that the over-expression of miR172b can lead to increased
cleavage of this transcript.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that over-expression of
miR172b in rice resulted in i) a smaller panicle due to
reduction of primary branches, ii) spikelets with multiple
bracts resembling rudimentary glumes, iii) florets with
multiple layers of lemma- and palea-like structures but
without empty glumes, iv) abortion of inner floral organs,
especially in spikelets with more than 10 bracts or four
layers of lemma- and palea-like structures, v) changes in
numbers, size, appearance, and identities of floral organs,
especially lodicules and stamens, vi) ectopic florets, and
vii) sterility and reduced seed weight. These phenotypes
not only recapitulated but enhanced the mutant phenotypes of SNB, suggesting that SNB and at least one of the
other four targets of miR172 were repressed in plants
over-expressing miR172b. We provide direct evidence for
miR172-mediated cleavage for SNB, Os04g55560 and
Os06g43220. However, expression of SNB was not

inversely correlated with expression of miR172 in wildtype, and over-expressing miR172b did not reduce the
expression levels of SNB in <1 cm long panicles where
development of spikelets and florets is occurring, instead
SNB transcript abundance increased significantly. The
unchanged or increased abundances of miR172 target
mRNAs in the miR172b over-expression plants is reminiscent of observations made in Arabidopsis [13,21] where
there is evidence that miR172 acts to repress translation
and for transcription of the AP2-like genes to be under
negative feedback regulation via their protein products.
Our data cannot distinguish between these possibilities
but do suggest a conservation of regulation of the AP2-like
genes between Arabidopsis and rice.
Control of spikelet determinacy and floret development in
rice
Rice spikelets, initiated from primary or secondary
branches of the inflorescence, have a determinate fate and
consist of two rudimentary glumes and a single functional
floret. Previously, BRANCHED FLORETLESS1 (BFL1) or
FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) and its maize ortholog
BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1) have been shown to be
regulators of spikelet determinacy in rice and maize,
respectively [25-27]. Knock-out mutants of BFL1 and BD1
fail to initiate floret meristems, and instead they continuously generate axillary branch meristems from the axils of
rudimentary glumes to produce a highly branched inflorescence [25-27], indicating that they specify meristem
identity during the transition from spikelet meristem to
floral meristem. Recently, SNB, a target of miR172, has
been shown to be another gene regulating this transition
[24] with snb mutants producing multiple bract-like structures that are equivalent to rudimentary glumes. Our
results show that SNB is a target of miR172, which adds
another layer of complexity to the regulation of spikelet
determinacy in rice. It has been proposed that SNB acts
downstream or independentlyof BFL1, based on the phenotypes of the respective mutants and mRNA expression
patterns determined by in situ hybridization [24,26].
However, further experiments are required to confirm this
relationship.

SNB is required for the correct timing of the transition
from spikelet meristem to floret meristem in rice as this
transition is delayed in the snb mutants [24]. According to
previous in situ results, SNB is initially expressed in the
branch meristem and spikelet meristem, and is then primarily restricted in the boundary region of the spikelet
and glume primordia. Once the spikelet meristem is converted into a floret meristem, a decreased expression of
SNB was observed [24]. Our data showed that both
miR172 and SNB are highly expressed in <1 cm long panicles, so miR172 could be acting to restrict the expression

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:149

domain of SNB. However at present the precise expression
domain of miR172 in the panicle is yet to be determined.
Phylogenetic analysis has shown that SNB and
Os03g60430 are likely to be orthologous to maize SID1
and IDS1, respectively [15,16]. These genes together with
the Q gene of wheat [28] appear to be grass specific and
are involved in panicle and spikelet development. Single
mutants of SID1 do not show visible phenotypic changes,
but null mutants of IDS1 lose spikelet determinacy and
produce extra lateral florets [22]. However, double
mutants of IDS1 and SID1 continuously initiate multiple
bracts and do not make any florets [16]. Thus, both IDS1
and SID1 are necessary for initiation of floral meristems.
Both snb and the ids1 sid1 double mutants produce multiple bracts, but snb only occasionally produces bracts continuously [16,24], whereas plants with strongly overexpressed miR172b have an average of 22% of spikelets
without floral organs (Table 1). We speculate that the
additional floret defects observed in plants over-expressing miR172b are due to repression of Os03g60430 by
over-expressed miR172 because both SNB and
Os03g60430 are relatively highly expressed in developing
panicles (Figure 2A, B), they have similar mRNA expression patterns determined by in situ hybridization [24,29],
and Os03g60430 is down-regulated by elevated levels of
miR172 in 0.5-4 cm long panicles (Figure 7B).
5' RACE results suggest that Os04g55560 is regulated by
miR172 in both vegetative and reproductive tissues (Figure 3). Among the five miR172 targets in rice, Os04g55560
is most similar to Arabidopsis AP2 based on phylogenetic
analysis, but its function has not been investigated in rice.
In Arabidopsis, both loss-of-function ap2 mutants and
miR172 over-expression plants have carpels in place of
perianth organs (sepals and petals) due to the absence of
AP2 and ectopic expression of AGAMOUS (AG), a class C
gene, in the outer two whorls of the flower primordium
[13,14]. We occasionally observed florets with two carpels
or a carpel with multiple stigmas. In most florets multiple
lodicules with changed morphology were seen. Lodicules
are thought to be homologous to petals in eudicots. These
phenotypic changes could be partly resulted from repression of SNB because the snb mutant also showed changes
in lodicules [24]. Further investigation is required to
determine whether these altered phenotypes are also
related to changes in expression of Os04g55560.
Functional specificity of miR172 members
Maize MIR172e loss-of-function mutants show increased
inflorescence meristem branching and develop carpels
within the tassel [15], indicating miR172e has a specific
function. This could be a result of spatiotemporal expression differences between individual members of the
miR172 family, or their targets, but does not rule out the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/149

possibility that only MIR172e is functional. Of the four
rice MIR172 members, MIR172b has a mature miRNA
sequence identical to maize MIR172e. In addition, the rice
MIR172b and maize MIR172e are located in a syntenic
region [15]; therefore, it is of interest to know whether
MIR172b also plays a non-redundant role in inflorescence
and spikelet development in rice and whether the other
three members are expressed and functional in rice development.
Expression analysis of the mature miR172 sequences and
their precursors in different tissues and developmental
stages might help determine where and when each
miR172 member is likely to be expressed; however, distinguishing expression of individual miR172 family members using hybridization and PCR-based approaches is
difficult because the four miRNAs have few sequence differences. Small RNA sequencing is able to distinguish
individual members with identical mature miRNAs due to
differences in the miRNA* sequences. It has been shown
that miR172b is expressed in seedlings and developing
grains [8,10,12], whereas miR172c is not detected in
developing grains [12]. miR172a/d is detected in seedlings and developing grains but the miRNA* is only
detected for miR172d [[8,12]http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/].
These results suggest that miR172a might not be expressed
in these two tissues. In our study, over-expression of
MIR172a did not show any visible mutant phenotype.
This might be because the accumulation of miR172 in the
MIR172a over-expression plants was not sufficient to
cause a phenotypic change (Figure 4). The reduced accumulation of miR172 could be because the transgene containing pre-MIR172a is transcribed less efficiently than the
pre-MIR172b transgene, or as pre-MIR172a is the least stable precursor (ÎG = -49.1 kcal/mol) among the four
miR172 precursors in rice, it may be cleaved by miR172a
itself as shown in Arabidopsis [30]. In Arabidopsis, a
miR172a miR172b (both with the same mature miRNA
sequence as rice miR172a) double mutant does not show
any floral defects (it is not clear whether the plants have
other defects) [19]. Further work is needed to determine
whether miR172a has a role in rice development.

Conclusions
Over-expressing miR172b resulted in delayed transition
from spikelet meristem to floret meristem and caused
defects in floret development. This is a result of repression
of SNB and at least one of the other four target genes, most
likely Os03g60430, by the elevated levels of miR172 in
plants over-expressing miR172b. Our analyses of expression of miR172 and its target mRNAs are consistent with
it acting through transcriptional and/or translational
repression with the latter as a possible predominant mode
of action of miR172 in rice.

Methods
Plant materials and growing conditions
All experiments were performed using rice (Oryza sativa
spp. japonica) cultivar Nipponbare. Rice tissue samples
were collected from plants grown in a controlled glasshouse at 25 Â± 3Â°C with 16 hours of light, except the twoleaf-stage shoots and roots that were collected from young
seedlings grown in Petri dishes at 28Â°C. For miR172 overexpression transgenic lines, mature leaves (for northern
blot) and panicle samples (for qRT-PCR) were collected
from T0 plants. The two-leaf-stage shoot sample included
shoot apices and all leaves. The 10-leaf-stage shoot apex
sample included the basal ~0.5 cm part of young leaves
that are ~1 cm in length. Two-, four- and ten-leaf-stage
samples were used to represent juvenile, intermediate and
adult vegetative stage, respectively. Panicles with a length
of less than 0.5 cm and 0.5-4 cm represent differentiation
stage of spikelets and florets, respectively. Booting panicle
was representative of developed panicle.
Generation of miR172 over-expression constructs and
transgenic plants
The genomic sequences containing pre-MIR172a or preMIR172b were amplified using locus-specific primers. For
the MIR172a locus, the primers were 5'-GAGCTCCATGGATGGAACGGTAGAGTCGGTGT-3'
and
5'GAGCTCGTATGGTCTTTGAATAGCAGAGGAGC-3'. For
the MIR172b locus, the primers were 5'-GAGCTCCAGTAGAGAGTGTGATGCCGCAGCT-3' and 5'-GAGCTCGCGGCGTTGGTACAATTAAGCTGATG-3'. The first six
nucleotides in each primer formed a SacI restriction site.
The PCR fragments were cloned into pGEMÂ®-T Easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI). To generate the ubiquitin-preMIR172 constructs, the SacI fragment released from the
pGEMÂ®-T Easy vector was gel purified and cloned into the
similarly digested vector pKU352 [31]. Rice transformation was performed by the Agrobacterium tumefaciensmediated co-cultivation approach as described previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/149

[32]. Transformed calli were selected on hygromycin-containing media.
RNA isolation, qRT-PCR analysis and miR172-mediated
cleavage of target genes
Total RNA was isolated as described previously [12]. Ten
micrograms of total RNA was treated with 10 units of RQ1
RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), and purified
by phenol-chloroform extraction. Five micrograms of
DNase-treated total RNA was used in both reverse transcription (RT) reactions and no RT controls. First-strand
cDNA was synthesized by random primer using the SuperScript III RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the
manufacturer's instruction.

qRT-PCR analyses were carried out using an ABI 7900 HT
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). For each PCR, 5 Î¼l of 1:40 diluted template
cDNA was mixed with 1 Î¼l of 10 Ã PCR buffer, 0.7 Î¼l of 50
mM MgCl2, 0.4 Î¼l of 5 mM dNTPs, 0.4 Î¼l each of 10 mM
forward and reverse primers, 0.5 Î¼l of 1:10000 diluted
SYBR and 0.1 Î¼l of platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 1.5 Î¼l of DEPC dH2O to a final
volume of 10 Î¼l. The amplification program was: 15" at
95Â°C, followed by 15" at 95Â°C, 15" at 60Â°C and 45" at
72Â°C for 35 cycles, and then followed by a thermal denaturing step to generate dissociation curves to verify amplification specificity. All reactions were performed using
one biological sample with at least three technical replicates, and the sizes of the PCR products were validated by
electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Rice 18S rRNA was
used as control for internal normalization because it was
found to be uniformly expressed in the tissues used in this
study. PCR efficiencies were calculated using the LinRegPCR program http://www.gene-quantification.de/down
load.html#linregpcr. Relative expression analyses were
based on Pfaffl (2001) [33]. Primers used are listed in
Table 3.

5' RACE was used to analyze cleavage of the predicted target genes of miR172 following the approach described
previously [12].
Northern blot hybridization analysis
Approximately 30 Î¼g of total RNA was separated on 18%
polyacrylamide denaturing gels, using a rice miR172a
RNA oligonucleotide as a size marker. RNAs were transferred to Amersham Hybondâ¢-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) and hybridized with a locked
nucleic acid DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the
miR172a sequence, which had been T4 kinase labelled
with Î³-32P ATP. Blots were prehybridized and hybridized
at 42Â°C in 125 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 250 mM NaCl2,
7% SDS and 50% formamide, and washed at 42Â°C twice
with 2 Ã SSC, 0.2% SDS followed by a higher stringency
wash of 1 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37Â°C if required. Blots were
imaged using an FLA-5000 phosphorimager (Fuji Medical
Systems Inc. USA). U6 was used as a loading control.
Scanning electron microscopy observations
Spikelets from the wild-type and miR172b over-expression plants were fixed in 70% ethanol for two hours. After
dehydration through an ethanol series, the samples were
dried to a critical point and mounted on stubs, and then
were examined with a scanning electron microscope (EVO
LS15; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
