Abstract
Background: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been successfully used for various genetic and
evolutionary studies in eukaryotic systems. The eukaryotic model organism Neurospora crassa is an
excellent system to study evolution and biological function of SSRs.
Results: We identified and characterized 2749 SSRs of 963 SSR types in the genome of N. crassa.
The distribution of tri-nucleotide (nt) SSRs, the most common SSRs in N. crassa, was significantly
biased in exons. We further characterized the distribution of 19 abundant SSR types (AST), which
account for 71% of total SSRs in the N. crassa genome, using a Poisson log-linear model. We also
characterized the size variation of SSRs among natural accessions using Polymorphic Index Content
(PIC) and ANOVA analyses and found that there are genome-wide, chromosome-dependent and
local-specific variations. Using polymorphic SSRs, we have built linkage maps from three line-cross
populations.
Conclusion: Taking our computational, statistical and experimental data together, we conclude
that 1) the distributions of the SSRs in the sequenced N. crassa genome differ systematically
between chromosomes as well as between SSR types, 2) the size variation of tri-nt SSRs in exons
might be an important mechanism in generating functional variation of proteins in N. crassa, 3) there
are different levels of evolutionary forces in variation of amino acid repeats, and 4) SSRs are stable
molecular markers for genetic studies in N. crassa.

Background
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) refer to the sequences that
are one to six-nucleotides (nt) repeated in tandem in a
genome. SSRs have many advantageous features for various biological studies: SSRs are ubiquitous and abundant
in a genome, highly variable and suitable for high-

throughput applications [1-8]. In addition to practical
usages of SSRs for biological studies, the SSRs have also
been under the intense scrutiny of researchers to elucidate
the evolution of genomes: (1) why are they ubiquitously
present in a genome, (2) how do they arise, (3) why are
they are unusually polymorphic, and (4) what are their

biological or structural functions are [1,9]? The evolutionary dynamics of SSRs have been actively discussed and
hypotheses for experimental confirmation have been
reviewed in the recent literature [1,9-11].

opportunity to explore the non-random distribution of
SSRs shaped by the de novo genesis in the eukaryotic
genome.
In this report, we investigate the distribution and size variability of SSRs across the N. crassa genome. We had four
specific questions in mind. 1) Is the distribution of SSRs
random or not in the N. crassa genome? If it is not random, what factors could explain this? 2) What are the biological functions of SSRs? 3) What are the forces causing
the size variation of SSRs? 4) Could we use SSRs for population studies in intra-species populations as previously
suggested [8]?

The growing numbers of completed genome sequences in
eukaryotic organisms from fungi to human have greatly
assisted understanding SSRs at the genome-wide level.
One obvious observation from the genome-wide studies
was that the distribution of SSRs in the genome was not
random in several respects: tri-nt and hexa-nt SSRs in coding regions were the dominant SSR types; other SSR repeat
types (except tri-nt or hexa-nt SSRs) were found in excess
in the non-coding regions of the genome but were rare in
coding regions; differential distribution in terms of abundance of SSRs was observed in between intronic and intergenic regions 5' and 3' UTRs, and different chromosomes;
and lastly, different species have different frequencies of
SSR types and repeat units [2,10,12,13]. The current
experimental and observational evidence suggests that
these non-random distributions of SSRs, both in coding
and non-coding regions, may be associated with a functional significance, which presumably results in adaptive
advantages [9,14-20]. Two alternative hypotheses were
suggested to explain the genesis of SSRs. These hypotheses
propose that SSRs originate either spontaneously from/
within unique sequences (de novo genesis) or that they are
brought about in a primal form into a receptive genomic
location by mobile elements (adoptive genesis). These
two hypotheses are both adequate for explaining the
ubiquitous distribution of SSRs. However, there remains
much to be understood to elucidate which one is right
and how the non-random distribution of SSRs has
emerged in the eukaryotic genome [1,9-11]. N. crassa has
been well characterized for its diverse genome defence
mechanisms that inactivate genetic mobile elements and
gene duplication across the genome except in some
restricted regions close to telomeres and centromeres [2124]. Thus, we reasoned that characterizing the SSR distribution in the N. crassa genome would provide a unique

Our data on the distribution and size variation of SSRs in
the N. crassa genome reveal both similarities and uniqueness in composition and distribution patterns in comparison to the other eukaryotic genomes, including other
sequenced fungal organisms. We discuss the potential
forces for shaping non-random distribution and size variation of SSRs, and biological implications of size variations of SSRs in the N. crassa genome.

Results
Genome-wide distribution of SSRs by the SSR unit size
In order to systematically characterize the distribution of
SSRs, we surveyed all of the SSRs in the N. crassa genome.
With our filter conditions (Methods), we identified 2749
SSRs (Additional File 1). SSRs were present equally in the
genic and intergenic regions in the N. crassa genome; 51%
in the genic region and 49% in the intergenic region (Fig.
1 and Table 1). Tri-nt SSRs were the most abundant SSRs
overall (Fig. 1 and Table 1). SSRs in different repeat units
show differential or non-random distributions in the different genomic locations. It is noteworthy that tri-nt SSRs
were the most abundant SSR type in the genic region,
whereas, mono-nt SSRs were the most abundant SSR type
in the intergenic region (Fig. 1). In an attempt to analyze
the differential distribution of SSRs more clearly, we char-

acterized the distribution of SSR types in each repeat unit
across genomic locations.
Mono-nt SSR
Mono-nt SSR was the second largest class by repeat unit,
representing 36% of the total SSRs in N. crassa. Mono-nt
SSRs were distributed preferentially in the intergenic and
intronic regions and were rare in the exonic region (Fig. 1
and Table 1). The relative abundances of mono-nt SSRs in
intergenic, intronic and exonic regions were 38.4, 56.3
and 0.2 per Mb, respectively. Among the possible four
types of mono-nt repeats (poly-A, -T, -G and -C), poly-A
and -T were the predominant forms: 11.4 poly-A per Mb
and 11.3 poly-T per Mb in the genome (Fig. 2).
Di-nt SSR
Unlike other organisms, the di-nt SSRs were a minor class
SSR type in the N. crassa genome (Fig. 1 and Table 1)
[11,25]. But it was consistent that the di-nt SSRs were preferentially distributed in the nongenic region (Fig. 2) as
found in other organisms [11]: 88% of di-nt SSRs present
in the intergenic region and 12% in the genic region
(0.5% exon and 11.5% intron) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). AG/
GA, GT/TG, AC/CA are the most abundant SSR types in dint SSRs (about 1 SSR per Mb in each case). The relative
abundance of AT/TA was about half that of AG/GA, GT/
TG, and AC/CA. No GC/CG SSR type was identified in our
analysis.
Tri-nt SSRs
The tri-nt repeat was the most abundant SSR in terms of
unit number: 39.4% of the total SSRs (1084 out of 2749)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/31

(Fig. 1 and Table 1). The relative abundance of tri-nt SSRs
in the exonic region was approximately two-fold higher
than in the intergenic region (40.2 per Mb vs. 19.1 per
Mb) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Among the tri-nt SSRs, AAC/
ACA/CAA was the most abundant (Table 1). We also
found that some tri-nt SSR types were not randomly distributed in the genome. For example, a group of SSR types,
AAC/ACA/CAA, GCT/CTG/TGC, AGC/GCA/CAG, was
preferentially located in the exonic region (Fig. 2C). And
AAT/ATA/TAA was exclusively located in the intergenic
region (Fig. 2C). The tri-nt SSRs in the exonic region are
translated into amino-acid repeats, which possibly contribute to the biological function of the protein.
We investigated the frequency of the amino-acid repeats
encoded by the tri-nt repeats in the exon (Fig. 3). The frequency was measured based on the encoded amino-acid
repeats that are composed of at least 5 repeats of a single
amino acid without any interruption. To see if there is a
bias in the distribution of amino acid repeats (AAR)
encoded by the tri-nt SSRs in the exonic region, we compared the expected and observed frequencies of the
encoded AAR (Methods) (Fig. 3). Among the AAR, three
AAR accounted for 50% of the total: Glutamine (Gln),
174 repeats, 29%; Serine (Ser), 75 repeats, 12.9%; and
Glycine (Gly), 66 repeats, 11.1%. Interestingly, some AAR
are present far more abundantly than the expected frequency in the exonic region (p < 0.001). These amino
acids are Gln, Glutamic acid (Glu), and Asparagine (Asn),
Gly. On the other hand, another group of amino acids,
Cysteine (Cys), Tryptophan (Trp), Arginine (Arg), Leucine
(Leu), and Valine (Val), are observed at less than expected
frequencies (Fig. 3). The longest AAR encoded by tri-nt
SSRs was observed for Gln with 81 repeats. Generally, the
proportion of amino acid repeats exponentially decreases
as the number of repeat units increase in all types of AAR
(Fig. 4). This suggests that there could be functional
adverse effects when an AAR becomes too large. To characterize the potential biological effects of the size variation of AAR, we grouped the proteins containing AAR
using gene ontology (GO). This showed that the proteins
containing the AAR that prevail in the N. crassa genome
are involved in important biological functions in sustaining life, including physiological process (GO ID: 007582),
binding (GO ID:0005488), and catalytic function (GO
ID:0003824). Small modifications of these genes could
trigger large effects in downstream pathways (Additional
File 2).
Tetra-, penta-, hexa-nt SSRs
Tetra-nt SSRs were predominantly distributed in the nongenic regions (Fig. 2D). The two most frequent tetra-nt
SSRs were (TAGG)n and (ACCT)n, representing 1.58 and
1.07 repeats per Mb respectively in the genome (Fig. 2D).
Penta-nt SSRs were also predominantly distributed in the

nongenic regions (Fig. 2E). The most abundant penta-nt
SSR was (CTTTT)n. The relative abundance of hexa-nt SSR
in the intergenic region was slightly higher than those
SSRs in the exonic region: 2.14 vs 1.74 SSRs/Mb, respectively. The most common amino acid repeat encoding
hexa-nt SSRs was Gln-Gln repeats (13.8% of the total
amino acids encoded by hexa-nt SSRs), which is the same
as Gln repeats by tri-nt SSR. The second most common
AAR encoded by hexa-nt SSRs was Gly-Ser repeats and
Glu-Lys repeats: 6.1% each in hexa-nt SSRs.
SSR genesis rate in chromosomes and genomic locations
The apparently non-random distribution (Fig. 2)
prompted us to further characterize the distribution of
SSRs in each chromosome and different genome locations. In this analysis, our goal was to test the de novo gen-

esis model in detail: what are the potential parameters
that cause the genesis rate of SSRs in the N. crassa genome?
If the genesis of SSRs (birth of SSRs) in the genome is random, one could interpret that the high abundance of SSRs
as the high occurrence rate of SSRs [26].
In general, the number of SSRs increases with the size of
the chromosomes except for chromosome 2 (linkage
group II) (Figure 5A, B). The average abundance of SSRs
in chromosome 2 is significantly higher than the other
chromosomes. Among 963 SSR types that we identified,
only 19 different SSR types were present at least more than
once per Mb (Table 2). Thus, we classified these SSR types
as abundant SSR types (AST). Only mono-, di-, and tri-nt
SSRs are included in the AST (Table 2). About 71% of the
total N. crassa SSRs (1,990) belong to one of the 19 AST

and the relative abundance of AST reflects the relative
abundance of the total SSRs among chromosomes (Fig.
5B). Moreover, the high copy number of AST allows us to
perform statistical tests to characterize the chromosomal
distribution of different SSR types.
In addition to the variation in the distribution of different
SSR types in different functional regions (Fig. 2), the relative abundance of SSR types (SSR counts per Mb) also
appears to be variable across the chromosomes (Fig. 5C).
Thus, the data suggest that the occurrence rate of a SSR
type may depend on both chromosome and functional
region. To statistically validate these apparent differences,
we performed an analysis of SSR abundance for the 19
AST using a Poisson log linear model [27]. The probabilistic motivation for the Poisson model is that random
occurrence of an SSR in the genome is synonymous with
SSR "events" occurring according to a Poisson process,
when traversing the genome from one end to the other.
The data presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 indicates substantial variability in abundance rates among types in each
chromosome and genomic location (Fig. 2 and 5). There
was no a priori reason to expect variation in abundance
between chromosomes. However, the log-linear modelling approach allowed multiple factors to be examined
simultaneously in a unified statistical framework. Thus,
we analyzed three factors in our analysis: chromosome,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/31

SSR type, and genomic location (genic vs. intergenic). Our
analysis was based on the data for the 19 AST, with a
cumulative total of 1990 SSR occurrences. For the purpose
of our statistical analysis, the data were summarized as
two 19 by 7 contingency tables (one for genic and one for
intergenic regions) giving the frequencies of the 19 SSR
types on each chromosome (Additional File 3). The abundance for each SSR type/chromosome/region combination was defined as the number of SSRs divided by the
length of the relevant region on the chromosome in Mb.
Our statistical model assumes that the effects are all additive on a log rate scale, and therefore multiplicative on the
rate scale (Methods). The goodness-of-fit of this model is
summarized in the analysis of deviance decomposition
given in Table 2. In particular, the residual deviance for
the full model, 228.79 with 222 degrees of freedom, indicates a good overall fit. In addition, all of the factors in the
model, including the chromosome main effects, are statistically significant. In particular, adding SSR type as an
explanatory factor to the null model reduces the residual
deviance by over 1500, which is clearly statistically significant (p < 0.0001 when compared to a chi-squared distribution with 18 degrees of freedom). Thus, abundance is
clearly not uniform over SSR types There is also a modest,
but statistically significant, chromosome main effect (chisquared = 14.53 with df = 6, p = 0.02). The cause of the
significant chromosome effect was the higher overall SSR
abundance on chromosome number 2 relative to all other
chromosomes.
The statistical significance of the SSR type/genomic location interaction was partially explained by the fact that the
8 mono- and di-nt SSR types (among the 19 AST) were
almost non-existent in the genic region, whereas the 11
tri-nt SSR types combined are approximately equally
abundant in the genic and intergenic regions. For this reason we considered separate fits of the log linear model to
the mono/di-nt SSR data and the tri-nt data, with the
genomic category factor omitted from the model in the
mono/di-nt data case. The sequential deviance decompositions for the two data sets are reported in Tables 3 and 4.
Table 3 indicates a significant SSR type effect as observed
in Table 2, but no strong evidence of differences between
abundance rates of mono/di-nt SSR types among chromosomes. The statistical significance of the SSR type factor
was a consequence of the large differences in the empirical
abundance rates, which strongly suggest that the genesis
rates of different SSR types were not uniform. The residual
deviance after dropping chromosome as a factor in the
model was 45.75 with 48 degrees of freedom, indicating a
good fit for the Poisson model with SSR dependent abundance rates.
The story for the tri-nt SSR counts was more complex
(Table 4). Dropping chromosome from the model

increases the residual deviance by a statistically insignificant 10.38. Examination of the chromosome coefficients
does indicate a significantly higher abundance value on
chromosome number 2. This may be just a statistical
anomaly or may indicate the existence of a differential SSR
genesis rate in chromosome 2. The residual deviance for
the reduced model was 142.69 with 136 degrees of freedom, again indicating that the Poisson variation model
was reasonable. However, not only do the abundance
rates vary by SSR type, but the differences depend upon
the genomic location category (intergenic/genic). While
abundance was generally higher in the genic region, the
pattern was not uniform across all 11 tri-nt types. In some
cases there was no significant difference between genic
and intergenic regions (Table 5).
Size polymorphism in SSRs among natural accessions
Next, we tested if the size variations of SSRs among natural accessions suggest evolutionary forces for the cause of
SSR size variations. We scanned the genome using a 250
kb window and randomly selected a SSR within each window. Mono-nt SSRs are not easy to accurately assay for

their repeat number and could mislead our analysis [28],
so they were eliminated from this analysis. Of the 1759
SSRs (after removing mono-nt SSRs), we selected 162
SSRs for further analysis (Methods). We analyzed the
characteristics of the 162 selected SSRs and found that
their distribution, repeat units, and frequencies were comparable to those in the complete genome-wide collection
(Additional File 4). To test size polymorphism of the 162
SSRs, primers were designed and used to screen the length
polymorphism in a SSR locus with 7 natural accessions
(Methods). Subsequently we accessed the size variability
of SSRs represented by the polymorphic index content,
PIC (Methods). The PIC value 0 represents no polymorphism among alleles and the PIC value 1 represents the
most complete polymorphism. Of the 162 SSR loci, 33
SSR loci were eliminated from further characterization
due to PCR failure or ambiguous results. We calculated
the PIC scores for the remaining 129 SSR loci. The range
of the PIC scores spans from 0.63 to 0.86. All the results
of the polymorphism analysis for the 129 sampled SSR
loci can be found in Additional File 5. In this analysis, we
considered two different parameters, physical characteristics of SSRs (repeat number, type, and length) and
genome location of SSRs (chromosomes and genic vs.
intergenic). First, we grouped these experimentally characterized SSR loci to test if the distributions of PIC scores are
associated with different physical characteristics of the
SSRs. There were no significant differences in the mean
values of PIC scores among repeat units or SSR types (p =
0.86 and p = 0.84 respectively, using one-way ANOVA)
(Fig. 6A and 6B), and there was no significant correlation
between PIC and repeat number (p = 0.4) (Fig. 6C). Second, we compared PIC scores of 129 SSRs in two functional regions (genic vs. intergenic) (Fig. 6D) and the
seven chromosomes (Fig. 6E). We also found that there
were no significant differences in the distribution of PIC
scores in different functional genome regions (genic vs.
intergenic) (p = 0.2, Fig. 6D) and chromosomes (p = 0.94,
Fig. 6E). Thus, these data suggest that there was no systematic difference in terms of the variations of PIC values
among different physical characteristics of the SSRs tested
here, or across functional regions, or chromosomes.
Finally, we also compared the PIC value distributions of
the same SSR type (AAC/ACA/CAA) in 20 different loci at
different functional genome locations and found that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/31

our study is relatively high, in comparison to other organisms [5,6], with an average PIC score = 0.8.
We were concerned that the PIC values calculated from
seven accessions might not reflect the true PIC values
among all accessions in nature. To test this, we randomly
chose 32 strains from the collection of natural accessions
in the Fugal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC, Kansas) and
analyzed the PIC score of one SSR type, AC/CA, at three
randomly chosen different loci. The PIC values of the AC/
CA SSR type with two different population sizes, 7 vs. 32,
were not significantly different (two sample t-test, p =
0.19, Additional File 6).
Statistical inference for evolutionary forces of size
variation of SSRs
We thought that the size variation of SSRs in seven different accessions could provide some insights in terms of the
occurrence of size variations in nature. We hypothesized
three simple scenarios regarding the scope of evolutionary
forces in SSR size variation for statistical tests: 1) Hypothesis #1 (genome-wide effect), the sizes of the SSRs in the
genome are either longer or shorter for a given strain in
comparison to those in other strains, 2) Hypothesis #2
(local effect), the sizes of some SSRs are either significantly shorter or longer than other SSRs, 3) Hypothesis
#3, there could be both significant differences among
strains and within a strain (Additional File 7). To test
these hypotheses, we used 33 SSRs that had no missing
data in seven strains (Additional File 8). The distribution
of repeat numbers across all seven strains and 33 markers
is considerably right-skewed. This skewness was largely
removed by a (natural) log transformation. In the following analysis we attempted to isolate the sources of variation in the log transformed repeat numbers by taking into
account the strain, chromosome, genome regions (genic
vs. intergenic), and SSR type. It is worth noting here that,
unlike in the analysis of the SSR counts, there is no particular reason that the repeat number should have a Poisson
distribution. Accordingly, our analysis of the repeat numbers uses classical linear models with the natural logarithm of the repeat number as the response variable.

age of repeat numbers than the other six strains (P < 0.05
for all pairwise comparisons with strain FGSC#2489). The
strain FGSC#2489 is the sequenced standard laboratory
strain that has been developed through an extensive backcrossing in the laboratory [29]. We are tempted to speculate that the systematic difference in the repeat numbers of
SSRs between FGSC#2489 and other natural accessions
could be a result of repeated selection in the laboratory
environment. This supports our hypothesis #1 that there
was a strain specific (genome-wide) effect in SSR size variation. There are also significant differences among the six
natural strains. However, after Bonferroni adjustment of
the pairwise P-values, the only significant differences were
strains FGSC#3223 and FGSC#2489 having higher average repeat numbers than strains FGSC#4720 and
FGSC#4724. Strains FGSC#4825, FGSC#2223, and
FGSC#4715 have average repeat numbers in between
these two pairs, none being significantly different from
either extreme after Bonferroni adjustment.
In an attempt to more carefully analyze the size variation,
we performed two-way ANOVA analyses: 1) strain by
functional regions, 2) strain by chromosome, and 3)
strain by SSR type. Analysis of the means by strain and
region shows no significant interaction (P = 0.36) and no
genic region main effect (P = 0.07). Analyses of the means
by strain and chromosome shows no significant interaction (P > 0.99) and no significant chromosome main
effects (P < 0.30), but a significant strain effect (P <
0.0001). The estimated strain effects have a similar pattern
as in the one-way analysis. Thus, this result also supports
the hypothesis that there was a genome-wide regulation of
SSR repeat number.
Since each marker occurs exactly once in each strain, it was
not possible to conduct a global test for strain by marker
interaction. However, a singular-value decomposition of
the 33 by 7 interaction matrix, M[30], reveals that there
are two dominant components that account for more
than 60% of the residual variation after accounting for
strain and marker main effects. Thus, we consider a linear
model of the form,

Comparison of the averages of repeat numbers for the
seven strains using one-way ANOVA indicates significant
differences among the strains. Pairwise comparisons indicate that strain FGSC#2489 has a significantly higher aver-

FGSC#2489. Thus, one source of the strain by marker
interaction appears to be caused by the extremely high
repeat numbers for marker 48 in strains FGSC#4720 and
FGSC#4715, relative to the other five strains. The second
eigenvector for markers has a dominant positive loading
on marker 201 and a dominant negative loading on
marker 1. In this case, the corresponding eigenvector for
strain was a contrast between the pair of strains,
FGSC#4724 and FGSC#3223, and the remaining five
strains. Thus, a second source of interaction appears to be
due to the contrast between these two groups of strains
with respect to the difference in repeat numbers between
markers 1 and 201, relative to this contrast for any other
pair of markers. These data support our hypothesis #3 that
there are variations in SSR repeat numbers that genomewide effects alone cannot explain.

is the main effect of strain i,

is the main effect of marker j. The vectors uk and

vk, k = 1,2, are the unit eigenvectors corresponding to the
largest two eigenvalues of the matrices, MM' and M'M,
respectively. This is an additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model that has been widely
used in the analysis of agricultural yield trials [31]. The εij
terms account for residual variation (interaction) not
explained by the multiplicative component. The least
squares estimate of the parameter, λk, is equal to the singular value associated with the eigenvectors, uk and vk, in
the singular value decomposition of the interaction
matrix, M. The square of this singular value is equal to the
sum of squares explained by the multiplicative interaction
component in the ANOVA decomposition for this model
as summarized in Table 6.

An alternative simple analysis is to look for markers that
have highly variable (log) repeat numbers across the
seven strains. Under the assumption that the seven (log)
repeat numbers for a particular marker are a random sample from a normal distribution, the sample variance is
proportional to a chi-squared statistic with 6 degrees-offreedom. Specifically, 6s2/σ2 ~ χ(6), where σ2 is the
unknown true variance. Using the chi-squared reference
distribution with σ2 replaced by the median sample variance from the 33 markers, we found 4 markers with significantly large sample variances (P < 0.005). In order of

Examination of the first eigenvector for markers reveals a
very large positive loading on marker 48. On the other
hand, the first eigenvector for strain was essentially a contrast between two groups of strains, one group including
FGSC#4720 and FGSC#4715 and other group including
FGSC#4825, FGSC#2223, FGSC#4724, FGSC#3223, and

increasing variance these are markers 201, 34, 48 and 1.
Thus, three of the four markers with the largest sample
variances are the ones found using the ANOVA methods.
Based on these data, we concluded that there are genomewide, chromosomal, and local effects in size variation of
SSRs.
Genetic map construction
It was suggested that SSRs could be useful molecular
markers for genetic analysis in intra-species populations
due to the hypervariablity of SSRs [8]. Earlier in this paper
we also confirmed this high variability of SSRs in N. crassa.
In addition to hypervariability, a useful genetic marker
should show stable inheritance. Thus, we wanted to examine the stability of the SSRs as genetic markers by constructing linkage maps from intra-species populations
generated by crossing N. crassa natural accessions (Table
7). We also reasoned that the polymorphic SSR markers
could provide a means of detecting chromosome rearrangement if there was a significant chromosome rearrangement among accessions. We found that 140 SSR
markers out of the 162 (86.4%) exhibited polymorphisms
of either co-dominant or presence/absence types in at
least one pair of the mapping parents (Table 7). Utilizing
the polymorphic SSR markers, 188 F1 haploid progeny
derived from each mapping population were genotyped
(Methods). We coalesced 109 SSR loci out of 140 SSR loci
into the three genetic maps: N2 (50 out of 71 SSRs,
70.04%), N4 (69 out of 94 SSRs, 77.2%), and N6 (70 out
of 91 SSRs, 76.9%) (Additional File 9).

To evaluate the co-linearity of the mapped SSR loci among
the three populations and the physical map based on the
sequenced strain, FGSC# 2489, SSR marker orders among
the three mapping population were cross examined by
using commonly mapped loci and a physical map. The
positions of the mapped SSR loci from the three mapping
populations were highly consistent with the physical map
positions, with few exceptions (Fig. 7). These exceptions
are found in closely linked markers, especially when the
markers are located in the same contig, for example,
MN153 and MN061 on linkage group 5. No errors in genotyping or significant segregation distortion at adjacent
markers were detected (Additional File 9).

Discussion
Distribution of SSRs in the sequenced N. crassa genome
There is a discrepancy between the numbers of the estimated SSRs in the N. crassa genome in our study and a
previous report [32]. The discrepancy could be attributed
to the following facts: 1) we used different algorithms
from the one used in the previous analysis; and 2) we used
the most up-to-date genome sequence (release 7),
whereas, the previous analysis used an earlier version
(release 3) of the genome sequence. In addition, it should
be noted that there is currently no consensus among
researchers regarding how to define SSRs [1]. To achieve
our goals, we applied more stringent conditions to define
the SSRs than previously used. Since rates of SSR mutations are positively correlated with SSR lengths, we chose
to have the number of nt within the SSR locus to be
greater than 21 [1,33,34].

We found similarities and differences in SSR compositions and distributions between the sequenced N. crassa
genome and other eukaryotic genomes. In the mono-nt
SSRs, which accounted for 36% of the total SSRs, poly-A/
T was far more abundant than poly-G/C. Indeed, A/T is
most abundant across the N. crassa genome. Most monont SSRs were located in the intergenic and the intronic
regions but rarely located in the exonic regions. This overrepresented A/T SSR tract in the N. crassa genome resembles the pattern found in the primate genome
[2,32,35,36]. In general, di-nt SSRs are the most common
SSRs in many organisms [2,36]. However, di-nt SSRs represent only 6.9% of the total SSRs in the N. crassa genome.
Among the di-nt SSRs, the proportion of the AT/TA SSR
type was smaller than those of the other di-nt SSRs: AG/
GA, GT/TG, AC/CA, and CT/TC. This result may reflect the
difference in SSR compositions between fungal and other
organisms [1]. It is also possible that the AT/TA SSR type
could have been underestimated because of our stringent
SSR definition (discussed earlier), thus accounting for the
difference between the studies.
Tri-nt SSR is the major class of SSRs in the N. crassa
genome. In our analysis, tri-nt SSRs accounted for 39.4%
of the total. This is larger than the di-, tetra-, penta- and
hexa-SSRs combined (24.5%). The predominance of tri-nt
SSRs in N. crassa appeared to be a unique feature com-

pared to other sequenced fungal genomes [32]. In terms
of relative abundance, there were twice as many tri-nt SSRs
present in the exonic region than in the intronic and intragenic regions combined. The enrichment of the tri-nt in
the exonic region has been observed in other eukaryotic
organisms across taxa [2,10,35,37]. This pattern was
attributed to a tight negative selection on the other SSRs
(other than tri-nt SSRs) that would perturb the reading
frame in the coding regions [2,10,38-40]. Our analysis
shows that most SSRs (74%) are predominantly distributed in the intergenic and intronic regions, with tri-nt and
hexa-nt SSRs being exceptions (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Moreover, the presence of SSRs, such as ATG variants that could
act as a start codon, or TTA variants that could act as a stop
codon, are restricted in the exonic region (See Table 1, Fig.
1 and Fig. 2).
Potential role of AAR encoded by tri-nt SSRs
Our results suggest that AAR encoded by tri-nt SSRs have
undergone positive and negative selections, depending on
their sequence types: three AAR (Gln, Glu and Ser) were
over-represented and three AAR (Leu, Cys and Val) were
under-represented in the genome (Fig. 3). This suggested
that the observed size variation of tri-nt SSRs within a
gene may be differential, possibly due to functional selection on the amino acid reiteration in encoded proteins
[10,11,41]. Previous analyses of protein database and
genomic sequence in different taxa found that AAR
stretches of small hydrophilic amino acids were more tolerated in proteins [10,41]. In agreement with previous
reports, our data showed that the hydrophilic amino acids
including Gln, Glu and Ser repeats are over-represented in
the N. crassa genome (Fig. 4). However, the tolerance of
AAR stretches in proteins has certain restrictions. Our
results showed that the proportion of AARs exponentially
decreased as the number of repeat units increased in all
types of AARs, with 25 repeats being a critical threshold
(Fig. 4). This may be because longer AAR repeats have
such detrimental effects on protein functions that they are
apt to be selected out in the genome [10,41,42].

Numerous lines of evidence have been accumulated to
support the potential roles of the AAR encoded by tri-nt
SSRs in the functional divergence of proteins

[10,12,43,44]. Hydrophilic AAR stretches can be a major
source of phenotypic variations [10,18]. For instance,
expansion of CAG repeats resulting in poly-Gln repeats in
various neurological genes in humans can cause changes
to their original gene functions and lead to various neuronal disorders including Huntington's disease, detatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinbulbar muscular atrophy,
and spinocerebellar ataxia [44].
It is suggested that gene duplication has a fundamental
role in diversifying gene function[45]. However, diversifying gene function by gene duplication is probably not a
good option for N. crassa because it has a genome defense
mechanisms, Repeat-Induced Point mutation or RIP [45].
Neurospora detects duplicated copies of sequences in the
genome and mutates both sequences by repeated point
mutations during the sexual cycle [45]. Thus, the questions of whether and how N. carssa could generate diversified functional genes has been raised [46]. We propose
that the AAR encoded by tri-nt SSRs might have a crucial
role in creating functional variability of gene regulation.
Since RIP requires a minimal duplicated sequence length
of about 400 base pairs (bp) [46], a tandem repeat of SSRs
less than 400 bp within a gene may escape from the influence of RIP and hence may modify the original gene functions efficiently [10,47]. The proteins including AAR are
in diverse functional groups (Additional File 2). Furthermore, the size variations of tri-nt SSR in exonic regions are
variable across the N. crassa genome (Fig. 6). These raise
the possibility that highly active contraction and expansion of the tri-nt SSRs in exonic regions may play roles in
the evolution of gene functions that may facilitate adaptation in new environments [10,14,47].
We explored the possibility of SSRs being a target of functional variation of circadian rhythms in nature. First, we
surveyed the variation of repeat numbers of SSRs located
in ORFs of known circadian clock genes, white collar-1 (wc1), white collar-2 (wc-2), vivid (vvd), and frequency (frq),
among 143 N. crassa natural accession collected from all
over the world. We found significant size variations of
SSRs in clock genes. Furthermore, these variations were
associated with circadian rhythms [48]. WC-1 is a bluelight receptor for circadian clock and it functions as an

Genetic linkage maps of three mapping populations. Each linkage group is named according to their cross number and
the corresponding chromosome number. Cross number is expressed by a letter; A (N6, FGSC#4825 × FGSC#2223), B (N4,

activator in a complex with a partner, wc-2. We focused
our study on the polyglutamine repeat domain in the
amino-terminal of wc-1, NpolyQ, which has been proposed as an activation domain [49,50]. Previous studies
also suggested that NpolyQ plays a role in clock-specific
activation [51,52]. We found that NpolyQ is a target for
period variation. Furthermore, we found evidence that
variation in the circadian clock was associated with latitude of collection, which suggested that the WC-1 genotype provided an adaptive advantage in natural
populations. The quantitative role of variation in the
amino-terminal polyglutamine (NpolyQ) domain of WC1 in period variation among accessions has been confirmed in an independent experimental line cross population [48]. Further functional characterization will be
directed toward determining the effects of the variable
AAR encoded by tri-nt SSRs on the corresponding gene
functions and their ecological implication.

Evolutionary inference of SSR variations in N. crassa
We attempted to infer factors on size variation of SSRs in
the N. crassa genome by statistical analysis of size variations of 33 markers in seven accessions. Our results suggest that there were at least three different levels of
statistically significant factors (genome-wide, chromosome-specific, and local effects) involved in size variations of SSRs in the N. crassa genome. Our study does not
address the actual mechanism of variation in SSR repeat
numbers; however, it provides foundations for further
experimental verification. One of the widely discussed
theories on the genesis of the length variation of SSRs is
the strand-slippage theory, that the variation of length in
SSRs is caused by slipped-strand mis-pairing and subsequent errors during DNA replication, repair, and recombination [1,11,53,54]. This could be a good explanation for
the strand-slippage theory with an assumption that there
is no bias in the rate of mis-pairing in genomic regions

during the replication process. However, there are reports
that the length variation does not follow in a step-wise
manner because the efficiency of the length variation may
differ due to numerous local circumstances in the genome
[1,10,11]. Our data also suggest that the genome-wide
mechanism cannot be the only source variation for SSR
size variations. The existence of chromosome-specific and
local effects suggests that genomic context is an important
factor for the variation of SSR repeat numbers. More
research should be focused on the factors influencing the
local variation.
RIP could be a potential mechanism for the observed species-specific bias in SSR distribution. RIP refers to a genetic
phenomenon that mutates duplicated sequences in a
genome during the sexual cycle [22,55]. Both duplicated
regions go through C:G to T:A mutations preferentially at
CpA di-nt [56,57]. For example, a segment of the Tad 1-1
sequence, ...ACACA..., is mutated to, ...ATATA..., after RIP
in all progeny the authors analyzed (Fig. 4 in [21]). The
systematic mutations of these types could accelerate the
genesis of certain types of SSRs and interrupt others. We
did not find CG/GC repeats in the N. crassa genome. This
observation could be explained by RIP since the expanded
CG/GC repeats could be a target for repeated RIP. Characterizing the roles of RIP in SSR evolution requires more
careful study.
Marker potential
The estimated PIC value was comparable and relatively
high for SSR markers compared to other organisms [5860] where the SSR marker system has been applied to
many genetic analyses. The average PIC in rice is 0.637
[61], in soybean 0.43 [62], and in wheat 0.40 [63]. The
mean PIC score in the rust fungus, Puccinia graminis, is
0.49 [64], and the mean PIC score in Diplodia pinea [=
Sphaeropsis sapinea], a well-known pathogen causing a
shoot or tip blight of numerous pine species and some
other conifers, is 0.43 [65]. Compared to these organisms,
SSR size variability estimated by PIC scores in N. crassa
seems to be relatively high. To estimate a mean PIC value
objectively, the tested SSR loci should be randomly sampled. However, unbiased sampling, as done in our study,
is not easy to achieve even in sequenced organisms. Since
the PIC calculations in many studies, including those
mentioned above, are based on the available SSR marker
set rather than a random sample, they could produce
biased estimates of the PIC for the genome.

The high PIC value in N. crassa implies that the SSR
marker system has sufficient resolution/polymorphism to
be used for genetic studies. Even though our current study
of polymorphism of the selected SSR types uses a rather
small sample of 7 strains, our PIC estimation of the SSR
type AC/CA was consistent with the estimation using a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/31

larger sample of 32 strains (Additional File 6). A larger
scale study of genome-wide SSR analysis with a bigger
population would be required to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of SSRs in fungal genomes.
We investigated whether the polymorphism of SSRs could
be affected by any of the factors including different repeat
units, SSR types, chromosomes, repeat numbers, and total
SSR lengths (Fig. 6). Our result showed that there were no
significant differences in PIC scores among those criteria
(Fig. 6) in the N. crassa genome. Since the mutation rate
seems to be random across the genome, it was difficult to
estimate the mutation rates of SSRs in different categories,
i.e. SSR types or functional regions. Thus, empirical characterization of size variability for each SSR is necessary to
estimate the usefulness of a particular SSR as a molecular
marker.
Currently, genomic sequences of many fungal organisms
are accessible through public genome databases. Identification of SSRs can be easily done using several publicly
available software packages. However, despite the many
advantages of SSR markers in various biological studies,
the lack of experimental data on polymorphic SSR markers is still a major limitation for utilizing SSR markers in
biological studies in fungal systems. Thus, community
based databases for SSRs will expedite the implementation of SSR markers in genetic and genomic studies in N.
crassa as well as in other fungal organisms.
SSR based genetic map construction
Recently, molecular marker techniques for assisting efficient mapping/gene-cloning have been developed in N.
crassa system [66-68]. All of these techniques utilize polymorphisms at the nucleotide level. The usefulness of polymorphisms found in SSRs for evolutionary studies was
explored by Dettman and Taylor [8]; 13 SSRs in 147
strains from eight species of Neurospora have been analyzed. The authors sequenced 5 SSRs and about 500 nucleotides of the flanking sequences, and then characterized
the genealogical relationships between SSR alleles by
mapping them onto a tree drawn by flanking sequence
data. This study revealed that SSRs are not appropriate for
studies on inter-phylogenetic relationship among species
due to high mutation rates in SSRs (about 2500 times
greater than those of flanking sequences) and allele length
homoplasy [8]. The same report also suggested that SSRs
could be used for population studies in inter-species populations. In the current study, we wanted to test if we
could experimentally confirm this prediction by constructed three linkage maps using three independent F1
populations.

Based on our SSR polymorphism data, we were able to
construct three different genetic maps from the three different pairs of N. crassa natural accessions (Table 4). A previous study estimated that the Neurospora genome is about
1000 cM [29]. The discrepancy in the estimated genomewide map units, between our estimation and the previous
study, is mostly due to the different coverage of either
molecular or genetic markers for each strain. Our linkage
maps roughly agree with the previous estimation, about
1000 cM [29].
The orders of SSR markers along the chromosomes were
conserved well among the three mapping populations in
our analysis. Furthermore, the positions of mapped SSR
loci from the three mapping population are highly consistent with the positions in the physical map, with a few
exceptions, suggesting that the genetic architecture of the
6 natural accessions are highly similar to each others. One
of the exceptions was the loci order between closely linked
markers. Because of this, the inconsistency is mostly
attributable to statistical complications caused by a lack of
recombination information between two tightly linked
markers, rather than chromosomal rearrangements due to
missing values or segregation distortions. A previous simulation study also supports our interpretation [69].

Methods
SSR analysis in the Neurospora genome sequence
The 39.2 Mb Neurospora genome sequence, release 7, was
downloaded from the Broad Institute [70], and was analyzed to identify SSRs. We utilized the "tandem repeat
finder" program [71]. We used stringent cut-off parameters as follows: matching weight = 2, mismatching penalty
= 7, indel penalty = 7, match probability = 80, indel probability = 10, minimum alignment score to report = 50, and
maximum period size to report = 6. From the analysis, we
selected 2749 SSRs and subsequently categorized the SSRs
by unit size and repeat motif in different genomic locations. In our study, the genomic location categories were
intergenic and genic (exon and intron) regions. Each of
the SSRs was considered as unique and was subsequently
classified according to theoretically possible combinations in each SSR. For example, (AC)n is equivalent to
(CA)n, (TG)n, and (GT)n, while (AGC)n is equivalent to
(GCA)n, (CAG)n, (CTG)n, and (TGC)n. Lastly, we determined the abundance of each SSR motif and unit size in
the different genomic regions by normalizing the size of
the corresponding genomic region. To describe the abundance of SSRs in different genomic region, we chose to use
the "relative abundance", which is calculated by dividing
the number of SSRs by mega base-pair (MB) of sequences
in our analyses.

Conclusion
We conclude that the distributions and size variations of
the SSRs in N. crassa showed statistically significant patterns. We could not find evidence that the mutation rates
(manifested by PIC score) are correlated with various factors including chromosomes, genomic categories, SSR
types, repeat numbers, and total SSR lengths. This suggests
that the factors affecting the mutation rate could be random across the genome. Thus, the non-random distribution pattern of SSRs presumably reveals the functional
significance of SSRs. The size variations of tri-nt SSR in
exons might be an important mechanism in generating
functional variation of proteins in the N. crassa. Using statistical analyses, we concluded that there are both
genome-wide and local effects in size variation of SSRs.
Since genetic mobile elements are inactive in the most of
N. crassa genome, the detected size variation of SSRs cannot be explained by transposable elements as demonstrated in other systems. Considering their high PIC
values, SSRs are good genetic markers for intra-species
populations of N. crassa. However, since the polymorphism level is locus specific, more thorough empirical
characterizations of size variability of SSRs across the
genome are necessary to increase their efficiency as molecular markers.

SSR markers
To characterize the overall pattern of polymorphism of
the SSRs in the Neurospora genome, we strived to select
SSRs randomly from the Neurospora genome. We divided
the genome into 250 kb windows and selected SSRs randomly within each window. A total of 164 SSR loci consisting of di- to hexa-SSRs with various sequence motifs
were chosen for further analysis. The scatter plot of the
selected markers showed that they were evenly distributed
in the genome (Data not shown). With the SSRs selected,
we designed oligos using Primer3 software (Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research, Boston, USA) in flanking sequence to amplify the targeted SSR loci. The range of
the annealing temperatures in each primer set was
between 50°C and 60°C and the primer pairs yielded
amplification products between 100 and 350 bp.

For semi-automated genotyping analysis, the 5' M13
sequence was attached to a forward primer in order to
incorporate a florescent dye into the PCR product. Fluorescent dye labelled M13 forward primer and a marker
specific reverse primer were used to generate fluorescentlabelled PCR product as previously described [72]. The
composition of the PCR master mix was prepared as
described in Cho et al. [73], and the PCR profile was modified from Schuelke as follows [72]. The basic profile was:
5 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 55°C,
1 min at 72°C, and 25 cycles of 15 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at

53°C, 1 min at 72°C, and 10 min at 72°C for final extension. Fluorescent-labelled PCR products for SSR loci were
multiplexed with regard to each molecular weight and fluorescent dye. Each multiplexing set of primers was called
a panel. One panel consisted of 12–15 SSR marker sets.
The multiplexed PCR products were analyzed by an ABI
3730 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allele sizes of SSR loci were determined using Genemapper3.0® (Applied Biosystems).
Estimation of predicted amino acid repeats encoded by
exonic tri-nt SSRs
We generated the predicted amino acid sequences with an
assumption that exonic tri-nt SSR sequences had an equal
chance to be translated in all the possible reading frames
of the tri-nt repeats. For example, SSR sequences GCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCT can be translated in three different
frames: 1) GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT, which will be
translated into Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, 2) CTG CTG CTG
CTG CTG CTG, which will be translated into Leu-Leu-LeuLeu-Leu-Leu, and 3) TGC TGC TGC TGC TGC TGC, which
will be translated into Cys-Cys-Cys-Cys-Cys-Cys. Only
one of the three possible reading frames would be used to
generate the "observed" amino acid repeats.
Evaluation of polymorphism
The measurement of the allelic diversity or polymorphism
information content (PIC) value was first described by
Botstein et al. [74] and modified by Anderson et al. [75].
PIC was defined as the probability that two randomly
chosen copies of gene will be different alleles different
within a population. The formula for the PIC value
applied in our study was as follows:
n

PIC i = 1 −

∑

2
Pij

j=1

where Pij represents the frequency of the jth allele for
marker i, and summation extends over n alleles. The
allelic polymorphism of the 162 SSR markers in the seven
natural
accessions,
FGSC#2223,
FGSC#4825,
FGSC#4720, FGSC#4715, FGSC#3223, FGSC#4724, and
FGSC#2478, were calculated following the formula. The
genome structure of seven N. crassa strains are divergent
and not related among each other (unrooted tree analysis,
minimum pair-wise dissimilarity = 0.91).
Genetic mapping analysis
The 564 F1 progenies (188 F1 haploid progeny from each
line-cross, Table 7) were genotyped to determine the linkage maps for each cross. Genetic linkage maps of each
population were constructed using two different algorithms, Map Manger QTX v. 0.3 [76] and GMENDEL v.3.0
[77] with the Kosambi mapping function [78]. Using Map

manager, the initial linkage grouping was performed
using the Double Haploid option with a threshold level of
P = 0.001. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulation with
500 iterations was used to test the marker locus order generated by GMENDEL.
Statistical Analysis
Let Y denote a frequency and L the associated length, then
the (relative) abundance is given by A = Y/L. Our modelling strategy incorporates the frequency and length information by assuming that the counts are Poisson random
variables with expected values proportional to their associated lengths. If E denotes the expected value of a count,
then the expected rate is R = E/L. A log-linear model is
used to describe how these rates vary as a function of SST
type, genomic region category, and chromosome. The fit
of a particular model can be assessed by comparing the
empirical abundance values, A, to maximum likelihood
estimates of expected rates which satisfy the model
assumptions, using the model deviance statistic,

∑ Y log E

D=2

Y

where the summation is over all 266 cells in the 19 × 7 ×
2 contingency table. Our most general model has the
form,
log R = α + T + C + G + T × G,
or equivalently,
log E = log L + α + T + C + G + T × G,
where T denotes the main effect of SSR type, C denotes the
effect of chromosome, G is the main effect of genomic
location category, and T × G allows for type by region
interaction, that is, differential type effects by genomic
category.
