Abstract
Background: Colonial invertebrates such as corals exhibit nested levels of modularity, imposing
a challenge to the depiction of their morphological evolution. Comparisons among diverse
Caribbean gorgonian corals suggest decoupling of evolution at the polyp vs. branch/internode
levels. Thus, evolutionary change in polyp form or size (the colonial module sensu stricto) does not
imply a change in colony form (constructed of modular branches and other emergent features).
This study examined the patterns of morphological integration at the intraspecific level.
Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata (Verrill) (Octocorallia: Gorgoniidae) is a Caribbean shallow water
gorgonian that can colonize most reef habitats (shallow/exposed vs. deep/protected; 1–45 m) and
shows great morphological variation.
Results: To characterize the genotype/environment relationship and phenotypic plasticity in P.
bipinnata, two microsatellite loci, mitochondrial (MSH1) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences, and
(ITS2) DGGE banding patterns were initially compared among the populations present in the coral
reefs of Belize (Carrie Bow Cay), Panama (Bocas del Toro), Colombia (Cartagena) and the Bahamas
(San Salvador). Despite the large and discrete differentiation of morphotypes, there was no
concordant genetic variation (DGGE banding patterns) in the ITS2 genotypes from Belize, Panama
and Colombia. ITS1–5.8S-ITS2 phylogenetic analysis afforded evidence for considering the species
P. kallos (Bielschowsky) as the shallow-most morphotype of P. bipinnata from exposed
environments. The population from Carrie Bow Cay, Belize (1–45 m) was examined to determine
the phenotypic integration of modular features such as branch thickness, polyp aperture, interpolyp distance, internode length and branch length. Third-order partial correlation coefficients
suggested significant integration between polypar and colonial traits. Some features did not change
at all despite 10-fold differences in other integrated features. More importantly, some colonial
features showed dependence on modular features.
Conclusion: Consequently, module integration in gorgonian corals can be shifted, switched or
canalized along lineages. Modular marine organisms such as corals are variations on a single theme:
their modules can couple or decouple, allowing them to adapt to all marine benthic environments.

Background
Important questions in the study of evolution are whether
the characteristics of organisms are mutually independent
or behave and evolve as integrated systems or modules,
and whether the integration of modules can be shifted,
switched or canalized along lineages [1]. In modular colonial organisms, which form by the reiteration of identical
units, the emergent forms are usually complex networks
[2,3]. Colony form in these invertebrates is a consequence
of modular (polyp) replication, and if there is tight integration (e.g. pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium) among
modular and supra-modular traits (e.g. polyp aperture,
inter-polyp distance or spacing, branch thickness, internode and branch length), then changes at the module
level may lead to changes in colony architecture. Alternatively, different groups of traits may change semi-independently (or conditionally independently) if pressures
or developmental mechanisms differ. It has been found
that all characters are mutually associated, integration
being strongest among the colony level (network) characters, which suggests that branching characters within colonial organisms can be independent of module characters
in interspecies comparisons [4]. Nevertheless, the integration or decomposition of modular features at the intraspecific level is unknown in marine modular organisms.
A particular attribute of gorgonian coral colonies is the
existence of different levels of nested modularity, such as
various types of microscopic sclerites (length variation
0.1–1 mm), polyps that always have eight pinnate tentacles (1–20 mm), and modular branches placed at nearly
fixed internodes (1–50 cm), which are all repetitive modules but morphologically fixed features throughout the
colony (e.g., [5-7]). Comparative analyses among several
Caribbean gorgonians suggest decoupling of evolution at
the polyp vs. branch levels [4]. Consequently, evolutionary change in polyp form or size does not imply a change
in colony form, or vice versa. These characteristics of
marine modular invertebrates are consistent with the
modular concept of phenotypic plasticity widely demonstrated in plants [8]. In addition, developmental controls
of colony form in gorgonian corals seem different from
the traditional axial patterning of most unitary metazoans
but are related to allometric changes in growth rate and
reproductive onset or heterochrony [2,7]. These features
of astogenetic growth also accord with the view of developmental reaction norms as whole-organism allometric
functions (e.g. [9]), which reveals once again that phenotypic plasticity should be considered a feature of modular
traits [8]. Could the modular concept of phenotypic plasticity explain the morphological integration of modularity
in marine invertebrates such as corals?
Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata (Verrill) (Octocorallia: Gorgoniidae) is a shallow water Caribbean gorgonian coral that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/122

can colonize most coral reef habitats. In a single location
such as Carrie Bow Cay, Belize barrier reef, it is found continuously from wave-swept environments as shallow as 1
m to the deepest portions of the reef (~ 45 m) where there
is very low water movement and less light (Fig. 1), as well
as inshore lagoonal habitats such as sea grasses and mangrove roots in the Pelican Cays. In addition, the species
ranges from purple and yellow coloration in lagoonal
habitats to gray and beige in exposed fore-reef environments [9], and can adopt bushy, fan- and feather-like
forms with over tenfold differences in branch length
towards its environmental extremes. This explains why
this species has been considered a taxonomic complex
(e.g. [10,9]). To integrate findings on the evolution of
modularity in gorgonian corals at the intraspecific level,
the aims of this study were: (1) to ascertain, using genetic
information, whether the different P. bipinnata "complex"
phenotypes belonged to the same species; (2) to quantify
the variation of different modular traits in different environments; and (3) to determine the morphological integration and decomposition of the same traits in relation
to the plasticity of the species.

Results
Genetic differences among Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata
morphotypes
Mitochondrial DNA sequences from 9 colonies of the P.
bipinnata complex were nearly invariant including 3 samples from the traditional P. bipinnata morphotypes from
Carrie Bow Cay (CBC), Belize, here to fore referred as

type from CBC, one from the Bahamas (typical) and three
from the species considered as P. kallos (Bielschowsky),
smaller and bushier morphotype from shallow and
exposed habitats (Fig. 1). The three morphotypes showed
also slight differences in the diagnostic sclerites, surface
scaphoids [10], P. kallos had it smaller and robust than the
progressively longer and thinner of the typical intermediate and deep water P. bipinnata morphs (Fig. 2), though a
great deal of overlapping forms were observed. The phylogenetic analyses included 14 species of the same family
to show the differentiation and distance among and
between other congeners of Caribbean gorgonian corals
and it was clear that all the species from the complex
showed no differentiation (Fig. 2A). Despite notable
divergence with congeners the P. bipinnata "complex"
showed less than 0.03 substitutions per site comparing
nuclear DNA sequences (ITS1, 5.8s and ITS2: Fig. 2B).
This phylogenetic hypothesis placed the three typical
intermediate morphotypes from the Bahamas basally
respect to 8 colonies of the three morphotypes from
Belize, which were not reciprocally monophyletic. Moreover, differences where found in the ITS2 secondary structures (Fig. 2B). The two heterologous microsatellite loci
showed very low variation within the P. bipinnata complex, most colonies had the same homozygous genotype
at each locus, though a few heterozygous were observed in
four colonies from the Bahamas, two from the Pelican
Cays in Belize and several congeners [See additional file
1]. Compelling evidence was afforded by comparing
DGGE banding patterns of the genotypes from individuals of the three morphotypes from Belize against the intermediate morphotype from Panama and the intermediate
and deep morphotypes from Colombia (n = 32), no other
morphotypes where found in these two locations. DGGE
revealed 15 different ITS2 copies, distributed as single,
double, and triple bands per individual colony, only 4
copies were shared between Belize and Panama samples
and 11 copies were likely private alleles (Belize 3, Panama
4, and Colombia 4) [See Additional file 2]. Colombia had
only single copy banding patterns whereas Belize and
Panama had also double and triple bands in ITS2. Besides
a single individual, no unique alleles where found in
either intermediate or deep morphotypes, which support
geographic distance as the driving force for genetic variation in ITS2 [See Additional file 2].
Plasticity and morphologic integration in
Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata
The "colonial" features branch and internode lengths
were significantly longer in the deep morphotypes with a
clear gap among morphotypes variances (Shallow vs.
Intermediate [includes mangrove, Pelican Cays] vs. Deep;
Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.001; Fig. 3A–B). There were colonies in the same reef (Carrie Bow Cay, Belize) with
branches up to 13.5 times longer in the deep morphotype

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/122

respect the shorter P. kallos branches (14–189 mm, minmax; Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the "polypar" variables
had ranges between 0.4 and 2 mm. Thickness and polyp
apertures were higher in the deep morphotype (K-W, P <
0.001) though great overlap in variances among all morphotypes occurred. Inter polyp distance was slightly
higher in the shallow P. kallos but there were no significant differences among morphotypes (K-W test, P > >
0.05). Bivariate zero-order correlations, e.g., branch
length vs. thickness, were all significant but those against
interpolyp distance (Table 1). Third-order partial correlation coefficients (PCC), e.g., branch length vs. thickness
but controlling for their correlation with the other three
variables, retained only stronger correlations that suggested morphological integration. Consequently, PCC
analyses revealed integrated "modules" of traits changing
together across the plasticity of the P. kallos-P. bipinnata
complex. Branch length, thickness, and polyp aperture
retaining significant 3rd order PCC formed an interesting
loop of integration whereas internode remained alone
correlating with the loop through branch length (Fig. 4).

Discussion
The Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata complex provided a good
model for exploring phenotypic plasticity and morphological integration at the intraspecific level. P. bipinnata
did not show the same pattern of morphological integration found among species, which suggests tight morphological integration of all traits and decoupling of
evolution at the levels of polyp (the colonial module sensu
stricto) vs. branch/internode (an emergent modular feature produced by colonial growth) [3]. Some features did
not change at all despite 10-fold differences in other integrated features; more importantly, some colonial features
showed dependence on modular features. The gorgonian
corals Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata and P. kallos apparently
belonged to the same species (at least phylogenetically),
exhibiting remarkable plasticity, particularly in branch
and internode lengths. Molecular evidence from nuclear
and mitochondrial DNA sequences, as well as two microsatellite loci and ITS2 DGGE banding patterns, corroborated the view that the morphological differences
corresponded to phenotypic plasticity. This finding differs
from those in other corals (e.g. fire coral, Millepora
dichotoma), where the different morphotypes found in different environments are associated with different fixed
molecular patterns rather than phenotypic plasticity [11].
Allometric change during growth is a characteristic of gorgonian coral colonies. It is known that gorgonian colonies
tend to spread their branches against unidirectional flow,
forming a 2-dimensional network even after transplantation [12,13]. In essence, most species vary from 3-D bushlike colonies in multidirectional flows to fan-like 2-D networks in environments with unidirectional flow (e.g.

[14]). Other colonial traits such as axial core composition
and stiffness differ considerably within species owing to
the preferred level of water movement [15]. This is related
to gorgonian community structure, where many species
overlap totally or partially along an environmental continuum in wave exposure and depth [9]. This change in
growth forms and preferences of species may be interpreted as allometric changes that enable resources to be
exploited optimally [16]. The observed change in P. bipinnata, in contrast, did not seem to follow a simple continuum allometric pattern but seems to support the modular
concept of phenotypic plasticity [7]. An integrated allometric change that produced the nested modularity of gorgonian corals would have to include changes in most
traits; but it was clear that some traits changed less than

others and one trait, inter-polyp distance, did not change
at all across environments.
Traits may differ in their evolutionary constraints, but the
rate of change of any one trait may or may not depend on
others. For gorgonians, the pattern of phenotypic integration at the intraspecific level showed the same interdependence of branches and internodes as found at the
interspecific level, but also showed an integrated loop
among branch length and minute "polypar" traits such as
branch thickness and polyp aperture. This was not wholly
inconsistent with the interspecific pattern of decoupled
evolution between the "colonial" vs. "polypar" traits [3]
because despite a more than tenfold change in branch and
internode lengths across habitats, interpolyp distance did
not correlate (e.g., zero-order PCC) with any other feature,
suggesting a decoupled mechanism of change for this
trait. The link between micro- and macro-evolutionary
changes in the shape of modules and colonies in gorgonian corals may possibly depend on which traits are independent and which are integrated.
When a species trait is invariant in different environments
while others show different phenotypic responses, there
may be canalization of this particular phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the level of canalization
since different factors may interact from gene expression
to morphology, and life history traits to behavior [17]. If
the species Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata is divided in two
lineages by a geographic barrier, for instance, their
descendants could include short and long branched colonies that all have the same inter-polyp distance. On the
other hand, inter-polyp distance might undergo a process
of decanalization in which plasticity starts to occur under
new environmental challenges. It is suggested that canalized traits can attain variability depending on the degree
and conditions driving this event [17]. In addition, phenotypic plasticity for some traits can be an adaptive
response to new selective pressures (e.g. [18,19]). The
interplay between canalization and morphological inte-

gration might be the link from phenotypic plasticity to
what we perceive as macroevolution.
One indication of the link between micro- and macroevolutionary changes could be the interplay among plasticity and integration with genetic variability and assimilation (e.g., [20], but see [21]). The link between microand macro-evolutionary changes in the branch and
polypar features of P. bipinnata seems to be related to constraints on change in some already-fixed features, but
implies integration of changes in branch length with other
unconstrained traits: inter-polyp distance, which varies
widely among species [3], was constant at the intraspecific
level. Moreover, other modular traits, apparently not integrated at the macroevolutionary level, became correlated
with branch length at the intraspecific level (Fig. 4).
The three main phenotypes did not exhibit clines and
were found in overlapping zones. Although the change of
phenotype was apparently independent of genotype, two
phenotypes were seldom seen side-to-side sharing the
same environment (Fig. 1). This could mean that
although this species has characteristic phenotypes at certain depths, there were exceptions where the ancestral,
derived or intermediate phenotype could co-exist with a
phenotype that was not expected to occur in these conditions. Speculatively, there could be maternal-specific
developmental "signals" determining phenotype in marginal environments; or, alternatively, it could be an incipient case of genetic assimilation. It is also important to
mention that phenotypic plasticity can show variations in
which the population mean and variance change [22].
Therefore, the presence of two morphotypes at the same
depth may just be some type of variation occurring in
some locations. It would be interesting to have more estimates of these overlapping zones so that more precise
conclusions could be drawn. It would be even more desirable to place experimental colonies at in-between depths
to see whether there is plasticity, as seems to be the case,
or whether a phenotype becomes fixed. Nonetheless,
more refined molecular and experimental approaches are
needed to evaluate genotypic vs. phenotypic variance.

Conclusion
Module integration within gorgonian coral species can be
shifted, switched or canalized along lineages. Marine
modular organisms such as corals are variations on a single theme: their modules can couple or decouple, allowing them to adapt to all marine benthic environments.
Adaptation to a certain environment does not always
mean that the trait is fixed [18]. Ecotypes can make some
traits exhibit phenotypic plasticity but are not so extreme
as to fix these traits in the species genome (see discussion
in [21]). Nonetheless, genetic assimilation [20,23] can be
a viable event for octocorals, where habitat seems to be a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/122

conditioning factor for niche separation. Species that are
geographically widely distributed, such as P. bipinnata,
also tend to be widely distributed across reef habitats [9].
This trend has been found in many groups of terrestrial
organisms (e.g. [24]). Even so, there is no clear evidence
of such a pattern in marine organisms. Phenotypic plasticity costs have been studied and it has been shown that the
type of response by the organism determines its viability
(e.g. the response of enzymes to the environment has little
energetic cost in Stellaria longipes plants: [25]; see [26] for
plasticity cost models). It remains unclear whether is it
better for P. bipinnata to fix a certain phenotype or express
it depending on the environment; the costs and benefits
of this plasticity have yet to be defined.

Methods
Genetic differences among Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata
morphotypes and congeners were initially estimated
using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences as well
as two microsatellite loci allelic variation. Collected specimens were prepared for sclerites observations with compound microscope and a few sclerites were observed with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (see methods in [27]).
Mitochondrial sequences comprised the 5' end of msh1
gene using primers by [28,29] and the nuclear sequences
comprised a portion of the tandem array of ribosomal
genes including complete ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 sequences
using primers by [30]. DNA extractions were made
according to [31] protocol using CTAB from alcohol preserved material (Ethanol 95%). PCR conditions were followed [4] and sequencing as in [32] using the Edge
Biosystems kit and sequencing using BigDye 3.1 (AB
3100, capillary electrophoresis automated sequencer).
The matrix editing, translation, and alignment for the
diverse genes were accomplished using Bioedit [34] and
ClustalW [35]. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in
PAUP* [36] coupled with Modeltest for maximum likelihood analyses [36,37]. New sequences were deposited in
GENBANK (accession nos. EU04312–EU043127). Predicted RNA secondary structures were modeled for the
portion corresponding to the ITS2 following the methods
from [33].
Two heterologous microsatellite loci, Pel74 and Pel1,
developed for the sister species Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae Bayer by [38] were used to assess finer genetic differences among morphotypes. For that purpose, 4
colonies from the Bahamas, 8 from Bocas del Toro (Panama), and 30 from different habitats around Carrie Bow
Cay, Belize were screened. DNA extractions we made as
above and PCR conditions as suggested by [38]. Microsatellite alleles were visualized using an AB3100, capillary
electrophoresis automated sequencer, with fluorescently
labeled primers.

In addition, a study of the ITS2 variation among morphotypes and locations was done for 32 colonies from Belize
(14), Panama (12), and Colombia (6). The ITS2 region
was amplified using primers and protocols from [33].
PCR reactions were separated in a Denaturing Gradient
Gel Electrophoresis-DGGE (ABS) containing 8% polyacrilamide, 1× TAE Buffer and linear denaturing gradient
from 40% to 80% of Urea and Formamide. Before electrophoresis the gels were pre-run at 60°C and 150 V for 20
min, followed by the electrophoresis at 60°C and 150 V
for 9 h. The gels were stained with Ethidium Bromide during 15 min and analyzed using a BIORAD chemidoc system. All the reactions were conducted without CG-clamp.

Plasticity and morphologic integration in Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata were studied using the same traits and methods as in [3] for 30 colonies collected in the vicinity of
Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, between 0.2 and 45 m of water
depth (same colonies used for microsatellite loci above).
Measurements (10 per colony, 30 colonies, 5 variables),
included branch thickness, polyp aperture, inter polyp
distance, internode and branch length. Patterns of morphological integration were examined as proposed by [1]
using third-order Partial Correlation Coefficients (PCCs)
that were determined among the studied variables [3].
