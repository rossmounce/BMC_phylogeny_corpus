Characterization of in vivo-acquired resistance to
macrolides of Mycoplasma gallisepticum strains
isolated from poultry

Abstract
The macrolide class of antibiotics, including tylosin and tilmicosin, is widely used in the veterinary field for
prophylaxis and treatment of mycoplasmosis. In vitro susceptibility testing of 50 strains of M. gallisepticum isolated
in Israel during the period 1997-2010 revealed that acquired resistance to tylosin as well as to tilmicosin was
present in 50% of them. Moreover, 72% (13/18) of the strains isolated from clinical samples since 2006 showed
acquired resistance to enrofloxacin, tylosin and tilmicosin. Molecular typing of the field isolates, performed by
gene-target sequencing (GTS), detected 13 molecular types (I-XIII). Type II was the predominant type prior to 2006
whereas type X, first detected in 2008, is currently prevalent. All ten type X strains were resistant to both
fluoroquinolones and macrolides, suggesting selective pressure leading to clonal dissemination of resistance.
However, this was not a unique event since resistant strains with other GTS molecular types were also found.
Concurrently, the molecular basis for macrolide resistance in M. gallisepticum was identified. Our results revealed a
clear-cut correlation between single point mutations A2058G or A2059G in domain V of the gene encoding 23S
rRNA (rrnA, MGA_01) and acquired macrolide resistance in M. gallisepticum. Indeed, all isolates with MIC ≥ 0.63 μg/
mL to tylosin and with MIC ≥ 1.25 μg/mL to tilmicosin possess one of these mutations, suggesting an essential
role in decreased susceptibility of M. gallisepticum to 16-membered macrolides.
Introduction
Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the major mycoplasma
pathogen in poultry, causing Chronic Respiratory Disease in chickens and Infectious Sinusitis in turkeys [1].
In Israel, due to control measures, M. gallisepticum outbreaks occur infrequently in breeder flocks. However,
M. gallisepticum is sometimes present in meat-type turkey flocks or other types of commercial flocks maintained for long growing periods with minimal
biosecurity, which thereby may provide reservoirs of
infection. Macrolides (tylosin, tilmicosin) and fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, difloxacin) are among the antibiotic families most widely used in poultry in many
countries [2], including Israel.
Tylosin has been used prophylactically and therapeutically for mycoplasmosis in certain poultry sectors in
Israel for more than 40 years [3]. Historically, tylosin

was used for eradication of M. gallisepticum by egg-dipping at the same time as being used for control in the
progeny, a practice that was linked to the emergence of
M. gallisepticum tylosin-resistant strains, initially in turkey breeder flocks and later in broilers and meat-type
turkeys [3]. With the successful eradication of M. gallisepticum in breeder flocks, there was a marked decrease
in the use of tylosin in poultry and, probably as a consequence, only sporadic detection of M. gallisepticum tylosin-resistant strains [4]. Notably, tylosin-resistant M.
gallisepticum strains, all with the same molecular profile
identified by random amplification of polymorphic DNA
analysis, were consistently isolated in one geographical
region of Israel where tylosin-treated commercial flocks
served as an environmental reservoir for outbreaks in
breeder flocks [5].
The antibacterial activity of macrolides is due to inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the
23S rRNA component of the bacterial 50S ribosomal
subunit. Usually in bacteria with a small number of
rRNA operons, such as mycoplasmas, acquired

resistance to macrolides has been associated with mutations within domain II or V of the 23S rRNA genes or
in rplD and rplV, genes encoding ribosomal proteins L4
and L22 [6].
Enrofloxacin has a fairly wide spectrum of efficacy and
has been used as the routine choice for treatment of a
variety of poultry diseases in addition to mycoplasmosis
in many countries [2,7] including Israel where it was
first introduced in the early 1990s. This practice may
account for the relatively rapid emergence of enrofloxacin-resistance in clinical isolates of M. gallisepticum
recently reported by our group [8] and others [9]. Molecular characterization of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of DNA gyrase and
topoisomerase IV in M. gallisepticum isolates with different levels of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones showed
that enrofloxacin-resistant isolates harbor amino acid
substitutions in the QRDRs of each of three proteins
(GyrA, GyrB, and ParC) [10].
The present study reports on in vitro susceptibility to
two macrolides (tylosin and tilmicosin) and to enrofloxacin in 50 M. gallisepticum clinical strains isolated in
Israel during 1997-2010. In addition, by sequence analysis of domains II and V of the 23S rRNA genes as well
as genes encoding ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 in
clinical isolates with different levels of susceptibility to
tylosin and tilmicosin, we investigated the mechanism of
M. gallisepticum acquired-resistance to these two 16membered macrolides. Furthermore, molecular typing
by gene targeted sequencing (GTS) [11] was performed
to characterize the M. gallisepticum strains isolated in
Israel over time, attempting to gain insight into the
emergence and dissemination of the resistance phenotype(s) in this population.

Materials and methods
M. gallisepticum strains and growth conditions

A total of 50 M. gallisepticum strains isolated during the
period 1997-2010 from 15 meat-type turkey flocks
(MT), 7 turkey breeder flocks (TB), 23 broiler breeder
flocks (BB), 4 broiler flocks (B) and 1 Leghorn-type
breeder flock (LB) were analyzed (Table 1). These
include 24 isolates described previously [10]. In addition,
reference strains M. gallisepticum PG31 (ATCC 19610),
M. gallisepticum S6 (ATCC 15302), prototype pathogen
M. gallisepticum R, and Israeli reference strain 227 were
included in this study. Samples from breeder flocks (TB,
BB and LB) were submitted to the laboratory within the
framework of the national mycoplasma control program;
clinical signs were not necessarily present. In contrast,
samples from MT and B flocks were received by survey
of flocks with respiratory disease and/or serological evidence of M. gallisepticum infection. The outbreaks had
no known epidemiological link.

All isolates were propagated at 37°C in Frey’s broth
medium. Isolates of M. gallisepticum were identified by
direct immunofluorescence (IMF) of colonies using species-specific conjugated antiserum. Mixed cultures were
cloned to IMF homogeneity by microscopic selection of
target colonies. Notably, isolates were not filtered cloned
in order to avoid inadvertent selection of a non-representative variant [12]. Aliquots of low-passage (3-4 p)
cultures were stored at -80°C.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

In vitro susceptibility for tylosin (98%, batch RS 0315),
tilmicosin (91%, batch RS 0263), kindly provided by Eli
Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA), and for enrofloxacin (98%
active material, Fluka AG, Seelze, Germany) was determined by the microbroth dilution method as previously
described [13], following the guidelines recommended
by Hannan [14]. Two-fold dilutions of antibiotics from
0.04 - 10 μg/mL were tested. For M. gallisepticum
strains sensitive to macrolides or to fluoroquinolones at
the lowest concentration in the preliminary test, an
additional round of testing with tylosin and tilmicosin
or enrofloxacin in the range 0.0008 - 0.2 μg/mL was
performed. The microbiological criterion (epidemiological cut-off value) was used for interpretation of MIC
results [15].
MIC values for tylosin and tilmicosin in reference
strains S6, R and PG31 were 0.0063 μg/mL and 0.0032
μg/mL, respectively for each of the strains (data not
shown). The MIC values for enrofloxacin in reference
strains S6, R and PG31 were 0.01, 0.005 and 0.01 μg/
mL, respectively (data not shown). The MIC values for
tylosin, tilmicosin, and enrofloxacin in this study were
consistent with the previously published values for these
strains [8,16-19].
The MIC values for Israeli reference strain 227 were
1.25 μg/mL for tylosin and tilmicosin and 0.05 μg/mL
for enrofloxacin (data not shown).
PCR amplification and sequence analysis of domains II
and V of the 23S rRNA genes, rplD and rplV genes

M. gallisepticum genomic DNA was extracted from 10
mL logarithmic-phase broth cultures using the Maxwell® 16 apparatus and Maxwell 16™ Cell DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used in this study
were designed on the nucleotide sequence of M. gallisepticum strain Rlow (AE015450, [20]) (Table 2). Since
the nucleotide sequences of the two M. gallisepticum
23S rRNA genes (MGAr01 (rrnA) and MGAr04 (rrnB))
are highly homologous, four different PCR systems were
designed to specifically amplify domains II and V in
each gene. One of the primers in each PCR system
(initial step) recognizes a sequence in the respective

flanking gene (MGA_0754 to amplify domain V and
MGA_0746 for domain II of MGAr01; MGA_1046 for
domain V and MGAr03 for domain II of MGAr04)
(Table 2). The primers MG23S-1F and MG23S-1R (for
the nested reactions) contain a nucleotide sequence
found in domain V of both MGAr01 and MGAr04
genes. Likewise, primers MG-rRNAII-F and MGrRNAII-R (nested) recognize a nucleotide sequence in
domain II of both MGAr01 and MGAr04 genes (Table
2). In addition, gene-specific primers corresponding to
genes rplD and rplV, encoding ribosomal proteins L4
and L22, respectively, were synthesized (Table 2).
PCR reaction mixtures contained 50 μL Ready-Mix
PCR Master Mix (ABGene, Surrey, UK) with 30 pmol/
μL of each primer (Sigma-Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel) and
about 100 ng of mycoplasmal DNA. PCR amplifications
were carried out in an MJ Research PT200 thermocycler
(Waltham MA, USA). PCR conditions for primers MG23S-1F/MG-0754-R and MG-23S-1F/MG-1046-R were
the following: one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, 1 min 45 s at
56°C, 1 min 45 s at 72°C; 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 56°
C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min 45 s; 72°C for 10 min.
To amplify domain II of the 23S rRNA genes (primers
MG-mdh-F/MG-rRNAII-R or MG-16S-F/MG-rRNAIIR) the following program was used: one cycle of 3 min
at 95°C, 2 min at 52°C, 2 min 30 s at 72°C; 30 cycles of
95°C for 45 s, 52°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 2 min; 72°C
for 10 min. When the final PCR product of domain II
or V of 23S rRNA was absent or was weak on the agarose gel, it was subjected to semi-nested PCR with primers MG-23S-1F/MG-23S-1R (for domain V) or with
primers MG-rRNAII-F/MG-rRNAII-R (for domain II) as
follows: one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, 45 s at 50°C, 1 min
at 72°C; 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min. The nested program
was also used for amplification of the rplD (primers
MG-L4-F/MG-L4-R) and rplV (primers MG-L22-F/MGL22-R) genes (Table 2). PCR products were visualized
on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels, and then purified from the gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).

Sequencing was performed at the DNA Sequencing
Unit, Weizmann Institute (Rehovot, Israel), utilizing the
Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer with the ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence editing,
consensus, and alignment construction were performed
using DNASTAR software, version 5.06/5.51, 2003
(Lasergene, Inc. Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
Numbering of the nucleotide substitutions in domain
V of the 23S rRNA sequenced amplicon is according to
the sequence of the respective genes in Escherichia coli.
GTS typing

Molecular typing was performed by modified GTS analysis [11]. The pvpA, gapA, and lp (MGA_0319) partial
gene sequences were amplified using primers pvpA 4F/
3R, gapA 3F/4R, and lp 1F/1R described previously [11].
However, the mgc2 gene was amplified using primers
mgc2 2F/2R, previously described by Garcia et al., [21],
resulting in an amplicon of about 300 bp. Amplified
gene fragments of the respective genes were sequenced
as described above.
The sequences obtained from each corresponding forward and reverse primer were assembled using the SeqMan program (Lasergene, DNASTAR) and the
extremities showing single strand sequences, as well as
aberrant sequences, were trimmed. All sequences
obtained for each gene were aligned using Clustal V
(Megalign, Lasergene, DNASTAR, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA) and trimmed to the same size for diversity analysis. Phylogenetic trees for individual genes were constructed from the Clustal V alignments by the neighborjoining method and 1000 bootstrap replicate analysis
using the MEGA 5 software [22,23]. In contrast with the
previously published GTS analysis, in which mgc2 and
pvpA gene fragments were 584 bp and 455 bp-long,
respectively [11], mgc2 and pvpA sequences were 300 bp
and 700 bp-long, respectively (sizes corresponding to
the M. gallisepticum Rlow genome [20]). The different
sequences obtained for each gene fragment were
assigned different allele numbers, designated by Arabic

numerals (1, 2, 3, etc; data not shown). The GTS types,
based on the allelic profiles of the four genes, were
designated by Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc) (Table 1).
The four gene sequences corresponding to each of the
GTS types identified amongst the 51 strains analysed,
were concatenated head-to-tail for diversity analysis
using Darwin 5.0 [24] available at [25]. A distance tree
was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm
with the “simple matching” option (no correction
applied to dissimilarities). The “pairwise gap block correction” option was selected with a minimal length for
gap blocks of one nucleotide. This implied that all consecutive gaps, starting from one nucleotide, were considered as a single event. A bootstrap analysis with 1000
replicates was performed to test the stability on randomly chosen sets of positions.

Sequences of 50 M. gallisepticum isolates and 1 Israeli
reference strain were submitted to GenBank under the
following accession numbers: gapA, JN102573-102623;
MGA_0319, JN102624-102674; pvpA, JN113291-113341;
mgc2, JN 13342-113392.

Results
Antimicrobial susceptibility

An overview of the MIC values, MIC50, and MIC90 for tylosin, tilmicosin, and enrofloxacin for the 50 strains tested is
presented in Table 3. Bimodal distribution of MIC was identified for all three antimicrobial agents, indicating acquired
resistance in isolates in the higher range of MIC values.
In Table 1 susceptibility data are presented on an individual strain basis indicating year of isolation and poultry sector of origin.

* MIC values for enrofloxacin are presented for 26 M. gallisepticum strains tested in this study and for 24 strains tested by the same method with the same

The molecular basis of macrolide resistance in M.
gallisepticum clinical isolates

No nucleotide mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to macrolides were identified in the rlpD and
rlpV genes or in domain II of the 23S rRNA genes (data
not shown). However, sequence analysis of domain V
revealed that all 25 M. gallisepticum tylosin and tilmicosin-resistant clinical isolates had nucleotide transitions
in one or both 23S rRNA genes (Table 1). Twenty-four
tylosin and tilmicosin-resistant M. gallisepticum strains
showed an A2059G transition in both rrnA and rrnB
and strain MCK showed an rrnA A2059G transition
(Table 1). The Israeli reference strain 227 with MIC of
1.25 μg/mL to tylosin and to tilmicosin had rrnA
A2058G and rrnB A2059G transitions. In the cohort of
25 tylosin- and tilmicosin-susceptible clinical isolates, 19
possessed only the rrnB A2059G substitution and 6 did
not show any substitution (Table 1). Notably, no
increase in the MIC values was found between cohorts
of M. gallisepticum isolates showing the genotype found
in reference strains S6 and R (rrnA A2058A/A2059A
and rrnB A2058A/A2059A) and M. gallisepticum strains
possessing the single nucleotide substitution A2059G in
rrnB (Table 1).
Molecular typing of M. gallisepticum clinical isolates

The genetic variability of Israeli M. gallisepticum strains
was assessed by a modification of the previously
described GTS method [11]. Overall, 13 GTS groups,
arbitrarily designated I through XIII, were distinguished
by analysis of the partial gene sequences of mgc2, pvpA,
gapA, and lp (Table 1 and Figure 1). The results show
that 38 of the 51 strains analyzed belong to two major
groups: GTS type II, comprising 28 isolates, and GTS
type X, with ten isolates. Type II was identified in 28/35
(80%) of M. gallisepticum strains isolated between 1997
and 2006 and was not identified after 2006 (Table 1,
No. 1-35). Type X, first detected in 2008, was found in
10/14 (71%) of the strains isolated since then (Table 1,
No. 37-50). Type X differs from type II by the nucleotide sequences of three genes (mgc2, pvpA, and lp). Two
isolates each possess GTS type IV and GTS type VIII.
The remaining nine strains were found to have unique

patterns. Interestingly, GTS type X is very closely related
to type VIII (Figure 1). They diverge only by a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the pvpA sequence,
namely by 1 out of 1837 nt of the concatenated
sequences analyzed (0.054% divergence). GTS type VIII
was first identified in 2006 and was found again in 2009.
Notably, the susceptibility profiles of M. gallisepticum
strains presented in Table 1 show that isolates with
molecular type II vary with respect to susceptibility to
tylosin and enrofloxacin (11 strains susceptible to both
antibiotics, nine resistant to tylosin and susceptible to
enrofloxacin, seven susceptible to tylosin and resistant
to enrofloxacin, and one resistant to both antibiotics). In
contrast, all the M. gallisepticum strains with molecular
types VIII and X were resistant to enrofloxacin as well
as to tylosin and to tilmicosin (Table 1).

Discussion
In the present study, the microbiological criterion was
used for interpretation of MIC results, since no Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for tylosin, tilmicosin and enrofloxacin are available for the
avian pathogen M. gallisepticum [26]. The bimodal distribution of the cohort of strains tested (Table 3) allows
wild-type susceptible populations of bacteria to be distinguished from those with acquired resistance [15,27].
Indeed, according to the data presented in Table 3, M.
gallisepticum field strains with MIC of ≥ 0.63 μg/mL to
tylosin, ≥ 1.25 μg/mL to tilmicosin and ≥ 1.25 μg/mL to
enrofloxacin should be considered as resistant strains.
The difference between susceptible and resistant populations for macrolides is more than tenfold (0.05 vs. ≥
0.63). Using this criterion, 50% of all M. gallisepticum
strains checked in this study were resistant to tylosin
and tilmicosin and 46% were resistant to enrofloxacin
(Table 3). Moreover, 12/14 (86%) and 13/14 (93%) of
recently isolated M. gallisepticum strains (2008-2010)
were resistant to tylosin and tilmicosin and to enrofloxacin, respectively (Table 1). Resistance to tylosin is not a
new phenomena in Israel, being present at least sporadically since the 1970s [3]. Moreover, tylosin-resistant M.
gallisepticum strains have been previously isolated under
field conditions in many countries [9,19,28-30]. In

contrast, although enrofloxacin has been used in local
poultry since the early 1990s, enrofloxacin-resistant M.
gallisepticum strains were first detected in 2005. However since then, 23/29 (79%) of the M. gallisepticum
field strains tested were resistant to enrofloxacin (Table
1). The emergence of widespread resistance to tylosin
and tilmicosin in clinical isolates of M. gallisepticum in
Israel, often together with resistance to enrofloxacin,
may confound treatment of mycoplasma infection in
poultry.
The data presented herein demonstrate that a single
point mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of
operon rrnA is highly correlated with decreased susceptibility of M. gallisepticum to 16-membered macrolides
(Table 1). Indeed, with one exception, all isolates with a
MIC of ≥ 0.63 μg/mL to tylosin and a MIC of ≥ 1.25
μg/mL to tilmicosin show the transition A2059G in the
rrnA. Interestingly, the single exception is M. gallisepticum strain 227 that has the nucleotide transition
A2058G in domain V of 23S rRNA gene of rrnA (Table
1). This strain was isolated more than 30 years ago and
possesses a unique GTS-pattern. No correlation between

the presence of nucleotide substitution A2059G in rrnB
and acquired resistance or decreased susceptibility to
tylosin was found in this study.
It has been shown previously that tylosin-resistant M.
gallisepticum mutants selected in vitro by erythromycin
harbored an A2058G substitution in one of the two 23S
rRNA genes [31]. However, since the authors did not
use the designation rrnA and rrnB, it was not possible
to clarify in which 23S rRNA gene the A2058G mutation was identified. In addition, among the tylosin-resistant mutants selected by erythromycin, a G2057A
mutation and an A2059G mutation were found in one
of the 23S rRNA genes. In the same study, in M. gallisepticum tilmicosin-selected tylosin-resistant mutants,
two mutations, A2058G and A2503U, occurred in one
of the two 23S rRNA genes and those mutants were
characterized by markedly high resistance [31]. In
another study, in vitro selection of M. gallisepticum
mutants resistant to tiamulin, a member of the pleuromutilin family of antibiotics that also bind at the peptidyl transfer site in the 23S rRNA, resulted in nucleotide
substitutions within domain V of the 23S rRNA genes

Gerchman et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:90
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/90

[32]. Mutants with the A2058G or the A2059G mutation showed cross-resistance to erythromycin, tilmicosin
and tylosin. Interestingly, 1/3 of these mutants harbored
A2058G substitution in the rrnB gene, while the other
two have A2058G or A2059G in the rrnA gene [32].
The nt substitutions at 2058 or at 2059 have been previously reported as hot spots for macrolide resistance in
other bacteria and mycoplasmas [6,33-39].
Molecular typing of the 50 Israeli isolates analyzed in
this study revealed the presence of two predominant
types: GTS type II dominated until 2006 and type X has
been dominant since first detected in 2008. By molecular analysis of the nucleotide sequences of pvpA, lp, and
mgc2 genes, type X is relatively distant from type II but
very closely related to VIII and may be considered as
part of the same clonal complex.
Interestingly, all M. gallisepticum strains of the currently dominant GTS type X (as well as type VIII) are
resistant to tylosin, tilmicosin, and enrofloxacin, suggesting clonal dissemination of this phenotype (Table 1).
However, this apparently was not a unique occurrence,
as evidenced by the presence of a resistant strain with a
different GTS pattern (Table 1, No.39).
In conclusion, our study shows the recent emergence
of acquired resistance to both the macrolide and fluoroquinolone classes of antibiotics in M. gallisepticum,
mainly present in field isolates closely related by molecular typing. A comparison between cohorts of M. gallisepticum tylosin- and tilmicosin-resistant and -susceptible
field strains revealed that acquired resistance to tylosin
and tilmicosin may be attributed to mutations A2058G
or A2059G in domain V of 23S rRNA gene (operon
rrnA). This is the first report of a mechanism for macrolide-resistance in M. gallisepticum clinical isolates. A
comparison of MIC in organisms with genetically characterized resistance mutation/s may offer a feasible way to
validate MIC breakpoint values. Therefore, the data presented in this paper may help establish a workable breakpoint for macrolides in M. gallisepticum.
Characterization of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes in
a greater number of M. gallisepticum macrolide-resistant
clinical isolates, especially those originating from other
countries, will help elucidate whether the nt mutations
observed in this study are characteristic only of this
cohort of strains or are the universal markers for macrolide resistance in this pathogenic mycoplasma.
