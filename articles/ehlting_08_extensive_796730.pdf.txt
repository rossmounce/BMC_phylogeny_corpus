Abstract
Background: Sequencing of the first plant genomes has revealed that cytochromes P450 have
evolved to become the largest family of enzymes in secondary metabolism. The proportion of P450
enzymes with characterized biochemical function(s) is however very small. If P450 diversification
mirrors evolution of chemical diversity, this points to an unexpectedly poor understanding of plant
metabolism. We assumed that extensive analysis of gene expression might guide towards the
function of P450 enzymes, and highlight overlooked aspects of plant metabolism.
Results: We have created a comprehensive database, 'CYPedia', describing P450 gene expression
in four data sets: organs and tissues, stress response, hormone response, and mutants of Arabidopsis
thaliana, based on public Affymetrix ATH1 microarray expression data. P450 expression was then
combined with the expression of 4,130 re-annotated genes, predicted to act in plant metabolism,
for co-expression analyses. Based on the annotation of co-expressed genes from diverse pathway
annotation databases, co-expressed pathways were identified. Predictions were validated for most
P450s with known functions. As examples, co-expression results for P450s related to plastidial
functions/photosynthesis, and to phenylpropanoid, triterpenoid and jasmonate metabolism are
highlighted here.
Conclusion: The large scale hypothesis generation tools presented here provide leads to new
pathways, unexpected functions, and regulatory networks for many P450s in plant metabolism.
These can now be exploited by the community to validate the proposed functions experimentally
using reverse genetics, biochemistry, and metabolic profiling.

Background
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which catalyze substrate-, regio- and stereo-specific oxygenation steps in
plant metabolism, have evolved to a huge superfamily of

enzymes. Plant genome sequencing initiatives recently
revealed 39 full-length P450 genes in Chlamydomonas reinhartii, 71 in the moss Physcomitrella patens, 246 in Arabidopsis thaliana, 356 in rice and 312 in Populus trichocarpa

[1]. However, according to the most recent survey [2],
only 41 of the 246 coding sequences in the A. thaliana
genome have been associated with a specific biochemical
function(s). The high complexity of the P450 superfamily
as opposed to the relatively scarce information available
on the functions of individual P450 enzymes was one of
the surprises of the first sequenced plant genomes [3-5].
Assuming that P450 number and diversification in plants
mirrors the evolution of chemical-, ecological- and biodiversity, it points to an unexpectedly poor understanding
of secondary metabolism, even in model plants. This led
us to assume that an extensive analysis of P450 gene
expression might actually be used to identify the metabolic networks, to highlight overlooked aspects of plant
metabolism, and to reveal functions of "orphan" P450
enzymes.
An extensive and sustained annotation of the P450 genes
in sequenced organisms, including plants, is being carried
out and has been made publicly available on a University
of Tennesse website maintained by David Nelson (Table
1). Annotation of A. thaliana P450 genes has also been
curated and collated in other databases by different organizations (Table 1). They include comments on genomic,
cDNA and protein sequences, genetic maps, phylogeny,
function, available mutants and tissue-specific gene
expression based on a boutique P450 gene microarray.
On the other hand, information on the expression of indi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/47

vidual P450 genes can be obtained from large scale digital
gene expression databases. Also several large scale coexpression tools are available to compare the expression
profile of a gene of interest with individual genes, or all
genes available on the microarray [6-10] (Table 1).
Such resources have been used as a starting point to create
the comprehensive database, 'CYPedia' (see Availability
and requirements section for URL), which combines large
scale P450 (co-)expression data with functional annotation. In a first step, Affymetrix ATH1 microarray data were
extracted from publicly available experiments to generate
comprehensive gene expression matrices for all P450s. In
a second step, correlation of the expression of each P450
gene with the expression of 4,130 selected and carefully
re-annotated genes representative of plant metabolism
was examined. Such a comparative analysis reveals highly
complex and divergent expression patterns for the majority of P450s, and provides novel clues on P450 functions,
related pathways, and corresponding regulatory networks.
This paper describes the construction of the database, its
content, and provides some examples of general and more
specific information, which can be extracted from it.

sponding locus identifiers (Atxgxxxxx) 227 genes were
found to be represented on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray represented by 216 probe sets (see Methods for
details). A list of all P450 genes, the associated AGI loci,
and the probe sets used can be found in Additional File 1
and at the 'CYPedia' homepage. A description of their biochemical function is also given (if known) and links to relevant publications as well as to information in external
databases, such as 'MAtDB, 'TAIR', or 'SIGnAL' (Table 1).
We retrieved normalized gene expression data for the
selected probe sets from the 'Genevestigator Digital
Northern' tool [10] covering more than 1,800 microarrays. Upon background correction, the mean intensity
ratios of replicates from each experiment was placed in
one of the following four categories: i) organ and tissue
samples from wild type plants (compared to background
levels), ii) stress treatment of wild type plants (compared
to untreated control), iii) hormone, nutrient (deprivation), and other treatments (compared to control), and
iv) mutant plants (compared to wild type samples).
Organ and tissue-specific expression
Across the organ and tissue data set, only seven P450
genes (represented by six probe sets) are not expressed
more than twofold above background in any sample. An
additional 6 genes (represented by 5 probe sets) are
expressed in only one sample, and two genes in only two
samples (Additional File 1). These may thus be considered as not detectably expressed in the organ sample set.
This group includes all putative pseudogenes represented
on the Affymetrix array. Conversely, 93 probe sets do
show expression in more than two experiments, but in
less than 20% of the 277 organ and tissue samples (Additional File 1; corresponding to the first four bins in Figure
1a), indicating highly specialized expression for 43% of
the P450 genes represented on the array. Groups of
flower, root, or leaf specific P450s are apparent. For example, 56 probe sets exhibit expression (twofold above background) in more than 80% of all root samples (23
experiments); of these, nine are expressed in less than
20% of other samples (Figure 1b). Using the same definition, we also identified five flower specific and four leaf
specific P450s. These represent the most specifically
expressed genes (Figure 1b). On the other hand, only 16
probe sets indicate expression in more than 80% of the
tissue and organ samples covered (Additional File 1), and
the corresponding 18 P450 genes may thus be considered
constitutively expressed or house-keeping genes (last four
bins in Figure 1a). The complete P450 organ and tissue
expression matrix can be found at the 'CYPedia' web page
following the link 'view matrices'.

We compared expression of the highly specific genes with
expression data generated using a dedicated P450 array
generated by spotting gene specific PCR products [2].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/47

Most organ specific genes identified here also show a predominant or exclusive expression in the respective organs
using the boutique array (not shown). Also on a larger
scale, the expression profile observed with the ATH1 array
is in good agreement with results from the boutique array
(Figure 2). We selected samples similar to those used on
the boutique array from the Affymetrix organ data set and
generated mean centered expression ratios from roots
compared to the average expression in all organs analyzed. The majority of P450s follow the same trend in
both array platforms with R2-values for a linear regression
of 0.508 (Figure 2). Another group is ambiguous, as its
expression is different from the average (more than twofold) using one platform, while the other suggests close to
average expression. Only for four genes opposing results
were obtained in the comparison of the two platforms.
Although correlations were less pronounced in the other
organ comparisons (data not shown), they also suggest a
good agreement between the different methods, in particular given the large difference in the biological material
used. The present analysis, however, benefits from a much
larger set of experiments.
Stress response
A large group of P450s is responsive to one or several
stresses across the 239 stress treatment experiments. More
genes are up-regulated than down-regulated. While 38
probe sets show induction in more than 20 experiments,
only two genes are repressed in more than 20 treatments.
The complete stress response matrix of all P450s can be
found at the 'CYPedia' web page following the link 'view
matrices'. To highlight stress induction of P450s, we
selected 49 probe sets representing 53 P450s showing
more than twofold up-regulation in at least 30% of the
experiments, within at least one of the treatment groups
(Additional File 2). A group of nine probe sets representing eleven P450s stands out as being strongly induced by
bacterial and fungal pathogens (Figure 3). These genes are
induced rapidly in incompatible interactions between A.
thaliana and Pseudomonas syringae, while induction in
compatible interactions is comparatively slower as it has
been observed for many defense related genes [12,13].
They are also induced by elicitors and by some abiotic
stresses including oxidative, osmotic, and UV stress (Figure 3, Additional File 2). Among these genes, CYP71B15
has been well characterized as being pathogen-responsive
and has been shown to encode an enzyme involved in the
last step of camalexin biosynthesis, the major A. thaliana
phytoalexin [14,15]. More recently, CYP71A13, was
shown to catalyze an earlier step in camalexin formation
[16]. Also previously characterized as differentially regulated in compatible and incompatible interactions and
senescence is CYP76C2 [17], although in this case the protein function was not elucidated. Conversely, CYP710A1
had not been implicated in defense response, but was

Comparison of expression data between platforms
Comparison of expression data between platforms. P450 expression data generated using a spotted microarray covering gene specific PCR products (CYP-array) were retrieved from the 'Functional Genomics of Arabidopsis P450s' web page
(Table 1). In this analysis, signal intensities in roots from 1 week old seedlings were generated by comparison to a 'universal
RNA' sample [2]. Not detectable intensities were artificially set to a ratio of 0.05 compared to the 'universal control' and after
log2-transformation expression data were mean centered across the experiments. Expression data from published Affymetrix
ATH1 array hybridizations were processed as described in Methods. The mean intensities from 17 experiments derived from
young roots were selected. To generate a control similar to the 'universal RNA', mean intensities from 69 experiments covering similar samples were calculated and log2 ratios were generated. Shown is a 2 × 2 plot comparing the mean centered expression ratios [log2(sample/mean)] from both platforms using data for all P450 genes represented on both array types. Data points
following the same trend are shown in black, points which are more than twofold different from the average expression in one
platform, but less than twofold different in the other are shown in gray. Red dots indicate genes with opposing expression
using the two platforms

shown to be involved in stigmasterol biosynthesis [18].
So far, no function or involvement in defense has been
described for the remaining genes in this group.
Another distinct cluster is defined by a group of 13 P450s
(starting with CYP74A in Additional File 2). These genes
are not (or weakly) responsive to pathogens, but are
induced by several abiotic stresses, in particular by
wounding, oxidative stresses (such as treatment with

paraquat, ozone or H2O2), genotoxic stress (imposed by
bleomycin), and by osmotic and salt stress (treatment
with mannitol and NaCl, respectively). Within this group
are the well characterized allene oxide synthase (AOS,
CYP74A) and the hydroperoxyde lyase (HPL, CYP74B2)
[19]. Both enzymes are involved in the oxylipin pathway
leading to the biosynthesis of jasmonate and other oxygenated lipid derivatives involved in stress signaling. Also
in this group is CYP86A2, which encodes an enzyme that

?-hydroxylates fatty acids and is involved in cuticle oxylipin metabolism [20,21].
Hormone response
Many P450s appear induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJ) (Figure 4). While 22 P450s are induced in
more than 30% of all MeJ treatment experiments, only
three are repressed (Figure 4a). Among the former are
again CYP74A and CYP74B2, involved in the metabolism
of fatty acid hydroperoxides [19], which are well known
to be induced by jasmonate, but also a large number of
additional P450s (Figure 4b). Not all these are expected to
be involved in oxylipin metabolism, but the group may
include genes involved in other pathways regulated by jasmonate. This holds true for CYP79B3, which converts
tryptophan to the corresponding oxime, thus leading to
the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates, to camalexin,

and to auxin [22-24]. It is interesting to note that
CYP79B3 is repressed upon indole acetic acid (IAA) treatments. Other obvious groups comprise P450s that are
strongly induced by IAA treatment (top of Figure 4b), or
repressed by gibberellic acid (GA) in seeds (lower part of
Figure 4b, starting with CYP84A1). In general, an extensive crosstalk between different hormone responses is
apparent: eleven P450s are responsive to more than one
hormone (> twofold) in at least three treatment experiments per hormone group. Antagonistic transcriptional
responses of individual P450s are apparent between IAA
and GA, MeJ and IAA, and cytokinin and IAA (Figure 4b).
Strikingly, most of the hormone responsive P450s, when
their functions are characterized, are themselves involved
in hormone biosynthesis or catabolism: e.g. CYP734A1
(BAS1) and CYP72C1 (SOB7) are both involved in brassinosteroids catabolism [25,26], CYP735A2 is catalyzing

trans-zeatin formation [27], and CYP79B2 is involved in
IAA biosynthesis [24,28]. Other hormone-responsive
P450s with so far uncharacterized functions may thus also
participate in hormone metabolic networks.
Mutant wild type comparisons
The mapping of P450 expression in mutants most often
highlights very specific responses in isolated mutants or
mutant groups. In a few cases only, subsets of ten or more
genes are co-regulated in response to one or several mutations. Such coordinate responses provide leads to metabolic pathways as shown below. The most striking feature
revealed by this data set is a very strong positive correlation of the activation of the set of P450 genes involved in
stress response with the activation of the LEAFY gene [29].
The complete P450 mutant response matrix can be found
at the 'CYPedia' web page following the link 'view matrices'.

In summary, expression matrices identify groups of genes
with specific functions during plant development or roles
in plant defense, and signaling networks. These may guide
further investigation into the function of individual members of this large gene family, including fine expression
analyses, description of mutant phenotypes and tissuetargeted metabolic profiling. Obvious hormonal networking and cross-talk may help to identify other enzymes
involved in hormonal homeostasis and to highlight new
and so far overlooked signaling pathways.
Co-expression analysis
P450s catalyze slow and irreversible steps in all branches
of the plant secondary metabolism. The underlying
hypothesis of the CYPedia approach assumes that genes
acting in the same biochemical pathway are co-expressed.
When their function is known, P450s are usually co-regulated with other enzymes in the same branch-pathway
[6,30]. Assuming that this may hold true also for yet
uncharacterized P450s, we performed a comprehensive
co-expression analysis comparing the expression of each
P450 with that of 4,130 selected genes involved in A. thaliana metabolism. These were retrieved from diverse databases including 'KEGG', 'AraCyc, 'AcylLipid', BioPathAt',
and selected publications devoted to the annotation of
secondary metabolic pathways (Litpath) [30-35]. A list of
all pathways and the associated genes can be found from
the 'CYPedia' page following the link 'browse pathways'.
For these genes, we then added annotations derived from
the 'Functional Catalogue' at 'MatDB' [36] and manually
curated 'GeneOntology' terms from 'TAIR' [37], as well as
gene descriptions from 'TAIR' (Table 1). Based on a manual assessment of the combined annotations and literature reviews, each gene was given an annotation score
reflecting the accuracy of the annotation (see Methods for
details).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/47

The annotation information of each gene was combined
with expression data as described above for the P450
genes. Using the four expression vectors for each P450 as
bait we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients (rvalue) with each of the 4,130 selected genes for a total of
3.78 × 106 calculations on a Beowulf computer cluster. For
each P450, similarly expressed genes (r > 0.5) were kept.
Based on the number and annotation score of coexpressed genes, co-expressed pathways were identified
for each P450 and expression dataset. The lists of coexpressed pathways can be found from the 'CYPedia'
home page following the 'pathway maps' link for each
P450. From there, links can be found to the individual
heatmaps depicting the expression profile and detailed
information of all co-expressed genes in each of the four
data sets.
Validation of pathway prediction: the phenylpropanoid
metabolism as an example
In most cases, predicted functions based on top scoring
co-expressed pathways agree well with the actual function
of characterized P450s (Additional File 3). For 27 out of
43 P450s with known functions the correct pathway was
predicted using this approach (63% success rate). For an
additional four P450s, no co-expressed pathways were
identified. This was in most cases because the gene was
not expressed to detectable levels in any experiment. Of
the eleven P450s for which a wrong pathway was predicted based on co-expression analysis, three had the correct pathway present within the ten highest scoring
pathways. This leaves eight genes for which no correct
pathway was identified (19% false identification rate).
Most of those are involved in hormone metabolism.

Among the correctly predicted P450s are all three hydroxylases involved in lignin part of the phenylpropanoid
pathway [38]. For example, when using CYP73A5 encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) as bait, both in the
organ and stress data sets all other genes characterized to
act in the general phenylpropanoid pathway were
retrieved with r-values higher than 0.5 (Additional File 4).
Correlations were less pronounced in the remaining two
datasets, but the annotated pathways 'Phenylpropanoid
Metabolism' (BioPath) and 'Lignin biosynthesis' (AraCyc)
were the top scoring pathways found in all four data sets
in accordance with the actual biochemical function of
CYP73A5 [39]. Not only genes of different branches of the
downstream phenylpropanoid pathways, but also isoforms for all upstream steps in the shikimate pathway [30]
leading to phenylalanine biosynthesis are co-expressed,
thus reconstituting the full pathway (Additional File 4).
It is important to note that a significant proportion of
P450s might act in biochemical pathways not yet elucidated and may produce natural compounds which were

never described. Obviously, genes in such unknown pathways have not been annotated, and it is therefore impossible to predict these pathways using the co-expression
approach. However, even in such cases valuable information can be obtained by careful inspection of co-expressed
genes. This may be exemplified using the CYP98 family.
CYP98A3 encodes p-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate 3'hydroxylase (C3'H) and is involved in the biosynthesis of
monolignols [40,41]. This gene is tightly co-expressed
with C4H and most other characterized genes involved in
the general phenylpropanoid pathway (Additional File 4).
Two other genes of the same family (CYP98A8 and
CYP98A9) share extensive sequence similarity with
CYP98A3, but were shown not to encode C3'H [41]. Both

CYP98A8 and CYP98A9 share an overlapping expression
pattern that is very distinct from C3'H, with expression
predominantly in floral tissues (Figure 5 & Additional File
5). In the organ data set, the top scoring co-expressed
pathway for both genes appears as 'miscellaneous acyl
lipid metabolism' (AcylLipid) due to a large number of
putative and known genes related to fatty acid metabolism, which are likely involved in pollen coat/wall development. However, several genes related to the
phenylpropanoid pathway are also co-expressed with
CYP98A8 and CYP98A9 (highlighted in orange in Figure
5). Altogether, they encode 'phenylpropanoid-like'
enzymes with unknown functions sharing sequence similarities with characterized phenylpropanoid enzymes

Expression analysis using CYP98A8 as bait
Expression analysis using CYP98A8 as bait. Data from published Affymetrix microarrays representing 167 organ and tissue samples were retrieved from the Genevestigator database [10]. Background correction and ratio log2-ratio generation was
performed as describe in Methods. The expression vector of CYP98A8 was compared to those of 4,119 genes annotated in
diverse databases to be involved in any metabolic pathway using the 'ExpresionAngler' algorithm [9]. Expression profiles of coexpressed genes with a correlation coefficient of more than 0.6 are shown as a heatmap. Groups of samples are indicated on
top of the heatmap. Mean-centered signal intensity ratios are color coded as indicated on the bottom of the heatmap. Genes
with similarity to enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway are highlighted in orange. Genes related to lipid metabolism are
highlighted in blue. Detailed information on the co-expressed genes and samples can be found in Additional File 5. To the right
a section of the phenylpropanoid pathway is outlined in red and the putative duplicated pathway as hypothesized based on the
co-expression analysis of CYP98A8 is outlined in orange.

[30,32,35]. This co-expression group thus appears to
result from the duplication of at least a portion of the phenylpropanoid pathway and its subsequent recruitment for
a novel flower specific pathway (Figure 5). Identification
of the substrate(s) of any of these enzymes should lead to
the elucidation of this 'phenylpropanoid-like pathway'.
In summary, these examples show that co-expression
analysis combined with pathway mapping of coexpressed genes is a powerful tool to identify genes encoding enzymes acting in the same biochemical pathway. As
a proof of concept, the majority of known P450s were
placed in the expected pathway. But the approach also
provides leads to novel pathways for a large set of orphan
P450s.
P450s related to plastidial activity (chlorophyll/carotenoid
pathways)
One of the most striking features revealed by the coexpression analysis is an unexpectedly large subset of
P450 genes being mapped to pathways identified as 'plastidial isoprenoids' (BioPath), 'photosystems' (BioPath),
'photosynthesis' (KEGG or FunCat), and 'biogenesis of
the chloroplast' (FunCat). At the 'CYPedia' homepage follow the link 'browse pathways' and 'CYP => pathway' to
the corresponding database for detailed information.
Their pathway predictions scores, frequently far above
500, are the highest of the whole analysis. Those include
CYP97A3 and CYP97C1 that were recently shown to be
involved in the hydroxylation of the ?- and ?-rings of carotenoids [42,43], but also as many as 79 other still orphan
P450 genes.

All these genes show very similar expression patterns, as
exemplified in Figure 6 (see also Additional File 6) for
CYP97A3, with very high expression in all green tissues.
They also frequently show down-regulation upon pathogen attack in leaf tissues (not shown). Eleven of them are
predicted to have a plastidial localization based on a
ChloroP prediction. Based on manual assessment, Schuler
and co-workers identified eleven P450s to be likely localized to the plastids [2]; seven of these are among the
group with predicted plastidial activity. This may suggest
that the role of P450 oxygenases in the metabolism of
plastidial (di)terpenoid derivatives, such as carotenoids,
chlorophyll prosthetic group, tocopherols, phyllo- and
plastoquinones, was so far overlooked. It may also indicate that a number of plant P450 enzymes have functions
related to primary photosynthetic metabolism for the synthesis of antioxidants, plastidial structural components,
signaling molecules related to energetic metabolism or
light perception. The latter case is illustrated by CYP90A1
that shows the typical expression pattern depicted in Figure 6. CYP90A1 catalyzes the 23-hydroxylation step in the
biosynthesis of brassinosteroids [44] and was recently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/47

reported to be under diurnal light-dependent control
[45]. On the other hand, some P450 in this group may
have house-keeping function or be involved in the biosynthesis of constitutive natural products, which are spatially and temporally coupled to energy production and
active plant growth. CYP86A2, which was recently
described as involved in the biosynthesis of cuticular lipids [21], may be representative of this latter category.
Candidate P450s acting on triterpenoid compounds
Terpenoids are C5 isoprene-derived compounds which
form the largest and most diverse class of natural products. In plants, they play important roles in development
and adaptation via hormones and antioxidants, but most
of them are mediators of antagonistic or beneficial interactions with other organisms, such as defense against
pathogens or attraction of pollinating insects [46]. Among
these, triterpenes are produced from 2,3-oxidosqalene by
triterpene synthases (TTPS) encoded by 13 genes (including the sterol cyclases CAS and LAS) in A. thaliana [47].
Each TTPS produces a unique set of terpenoids, which
may then be further modulated, e.g. hydroxylated, by
P450s to generate the plethora of decorated triterpenoid
compounds. While many TTPS genes have been characterized, only one P450 involved in triterpenoid modification
has been identified [48]. Our pathway mapping approach
identified 63 P450s as co-expressed with genes placed in
the category 'triterpene, sterol, and brassinosteroid metabolism' (LitPath) among them 27 belonging into the category 'triterpene biosynthesis' (from the 'CYPedia'
homepage follow the link 'browse pathways' and 'pathway => CYP' to 'LitPath'). In order to further identify individual pairs of TTPS and P450 genes possibly acting in
concert, we calculated, for each expression data set, correlation coefficients comparing expression vectors of each
TTPS with each P450. For seven of the TTPS genes, up to
six tightly co-expressed P450s (r > 0.75) were identified
(Table 2). A total of 20 P450s (represented by 18 probe
sets) are co-expressed with at least one TTPS in at least one
of the datasets. None of these P450s has been characterized to date. Seven of these belong to the CYP705 family,
while no other family is represented by more than two coexpressed genes, indicating a particular role for this family
in triterpenoid modulation, which may be driven by
CYP705/TTPS co-evolution.

The strongest correlations were found for TTPS6 and
TTPS5 (MRN1). TTPS6 (thalianol synthase) catalyzes the
cyclization of 2,3-epoxysqualene to form the tricyclic triterpene thalianol [49], while MRN1 catalyzes an atypical
epoxysqualene cyclization into a monocyclic iridal triterpene named marneral [50]. Neither product nor further
metabolites have yet been identified in planta. Related
iridal triterpenoids were however described in Iridaceae.
MRN1 and TTPS6 share an overlapping expression pattern

For each TTPS, all P450s are shown that have an r-value of more than 0.75 in at least one data set with the given TTPS.

with the same set of four P450s in all data sets, though
most pronounced in the organ data (Figure 7, Additional
File 7). They are highly expressed in roots, seedlings
(potentially the root part thereof), and some cell cultures.
Within the cluster, CYP705A5 and CYP708A2 are
expressed more similar to TTPS6, while CYP705A12 and
CYP71A16 share a more similar organ pattern with
MRN1, being expressed mainly in more mature root samples (Figure 7). Likewise, this gene set forms a separate
cluster in the hormone data set, with induced expression
upon cytokinin (zeatin) and MeJ treatments, with again
the same sub-clustering (Additional File 7). MRN1 is not
stress responsive (and therefore having no co-expressed
P450s in the stress data set), but TTPS6, CYP705A5 and
CYP708A2 form a clear cluster characterized by induced
expression in roots upon wounding, drought, and some
other stressors, although r-values are comparatively low
(Table 2, Additional File 7). The whole group forms again
a strong cluster in the mutant data set with a typical
expression pattern. It displays repressed expression in det2
and ga1 mutants (Additional File 7), which are blocked in
the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids and gibberellic acid,
respectively [51,52]. It appears thus that blockage of hormone pathways branching upstream of TTPS action
results in down-regulation of these pathways as well.

In summary, two subgroups of strongly co-regulated
genes were identified. Among them, CYP705A5 and
CYP708A2 are good candidates for catalyzing further
modifications, possibly sequential hydroxylations, of
thalianol to form a stress responsive, root specific triterpenoid. While this manuscript was under evaluation, this
prediction was fully confirmed by the functional characterization of the thalianol pathway by Fields and Osbourn
[53]. Their characterization of this pathway was guided by
an operon-like physical clustering of the co-expressed
genes. CYP705A12 and CYP71A1, on the other hand, are
more likely involved in modifications of marneral to form
a triterpene iridoid derivative, similar to multi-hydroxylated iridoids so far considered as characteristic of Iridaceae [54]. Equally consistent leads were obtained from
the clustering analysis of other P450s related to triterpenoid pathways initiated by TTPS1, TTPS2, and TTPS3.
P450s related to plant hormone biosynthesis
Cytochrome P450s play central roles in the metabolism of
all classes of plant hormones [4]. Our co-expression
approach was in particular successful in the case of the
octadecanoid pathway leading to the biosynthesis of jasmonate and other oxylipins. Jasmonate is a well characterized stress response signal that also fulfills hormonal
actions in stamen and pollen development [55]. Both
characterized P450s acting in this pathways, allene oxide

Figureexpression of co-expressed triterpene synthases (TTPS) and P450s
Organ 7
Organ expression of co-expressed triterpene synthases (TTPS) and P450s. Microarray expression data were
retrieved from the 'Genevestigator' database and processed as described in Methods. Expression vectors from the organ and
tissue data sets of five TTPS genes (from A. thalaina was used as a bait for co-expression analysis comparing it's expression with
that of all P450 genes. We retained five TTPS genes, which were co-expressed (r > 0.75) with at least one P450 in the organ
and tissue expression data set, and the corresponding P450s (Table 2). This set of genes was used visualize expression. TTPS (in
bold) and correlated P450 genes with high correlation coefficients are color coded.

synthase (AOS, CYP74A) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL1,
CYP74B2) [19], were correctly placed in the pathways 'jasmonic acid biosynthesis' (TAIR-GO) and 'lipoxygenase
pathway' (AraCyc), respectively. However, additional
P450s might be involved in the metabolism of jasmonate
(e.g. catalyzing hydroxylations of jasmonate) and other
oxylipins. In addition, a subset of genes involved in
defense or plant development is expected to be selectively
activated by the jasmonate cascade. Indeed, as many as
ten additional P450s are co-expressed with genes related
to jasmonate signaling (i.e. being placed into the categories 'jasmonic acid biosynthesis' [AraCyc], 'jasmonic acid
biosynthesis' [TAIR-GO], or 'response to jasmonic acid
stimulus' [TAIR-GO]). Table 3 lists correlation coefficients
with jasmonate related genes for P450s, which have coexpressed gene in at least two data sets, and which have
more than five co-expressed genes in at least one data set.
Four so far uncharacterized P450s share a common hormone-response profile with many jasmonate related
genes (top of Table 3), due to a strong and specific induction upon methyljasmonate treatment. These genes also
share a common profile with jasmonate related genes in
other datasets (Table 3). Phylogeny and in vitro functional
analysis predicts most of them (CYP94s, CYP96A4) to be
involved in the metabolism of oxylipins [56]. For a second group of genes, correlated expression with the jasmonate pathway is especially striking in the organ data set
(bottom of Table 3). Those are known or predicted to participate in the light perception/plastidial activity

(CYP97B3, CYP90A1[44], CYP72A11), or the biosythesis
of glucosinolates (CYP83B1 [57], CYP71B7). It is interesting to note that in the case of 12-oxophytodienoate
reductases, OPR3 is co-expresssed with most of P450s
(including AOS and HPL1) in the hormone and stress
data sets, while OPR2 shares a similar expression with
P450s exclusively in the organ data set.
Distinct P450 subsets were associated with various other
hormone pathways (not shown). However, r-values are
generally lower compared to the jasmonate related genes
and co-expression is limited to fewer genes in the respective pathways. This may be due to the fact that metabolism of these hormones is less characterized, or, more
likely, due to the relatively low and cell/tissue specific
expression of most of the genes involved in these hormonal pathways.
In summary, the co-expression approach associates
groups of P450s with specific hormonal pathways. The
analysis is however more informative in the case of stress
signaling which involves strong responses than in the case
of low concentration hormones controlling plant development. It is thus expected to mainly support characterization of new stress signaling pathways.

Conclusion
The abundance of publicly available microarray expression data provides a stunning amount of information that

has been exploited only sparsely to date. A correlation
between gene expression and their biological/biochemical roles is necessary, and when genes encode metabolic
enzymes acting in the same pathway, they are expected to
be co-regulated. The data presented here covering known
pathways largely confirm these assumptions. Based on coexpression analysis of the complete P450 superfamily in
A. thaliana we have generated novel hypotheses regarding
biochemical and biological functions for a large number
of individual genes or gene groups involved in common
pathways. Strikingly, the first validation of a new pathway
predicted from our data was published independently
during evaluation of this manuscript [53], thus further
confirming the potential of this approach. More leads will
emerge from this analysis in the next years, supported by
an increasing number of characterized genes functions.
New hypotheses can now be addressed experimentally by
exploiting the expanding toolbox of reverse genetics, such
as insertion mutants combined with targeted metabolic
profiling, and by reverse biochemistry using collections of
recombinant proteins and medium throughput screening
of substrate collections [58]. The same approach can also
be extended to other gene families, including transcription factors, and thus has the potential to considerably
accelerate the molecular understanding of plant natural
product metabolic networks and regulation.

Materials and Methods
Probe set selection and expression data of P450 genes
A collection of all cytochromes P450 from A. thaliana
(271 genes as of April 2005) and the corresponding AGI
(Arabidopsis Genome Initiative) locus identifiers
(Atxgxxxxx) were retrieved from the' PlaCe Arabidopsis
P450 database' (Table 2). For 21 P450 genes annotated at
PlaCe, no AGI locus was associated. Those included 18
annotated pseudogenes. Two pairs of P450 genes were
associated with the same AGI-locus (CYP71A27P and
CYP71A28: At4g20240; CYP71A23 and CYP71A24:
At3g48290), leaving a total of 248 AGI loci. These were
used to identify corresponding probe sets on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray using the 'Genevestigator' probe
selection tool [10]. 21 genes were not represented on the
array. The remaining 227 genes were represented by a
total of 229 probe sets, with 26 genes being represented by
more than one probe set, and 32 probe sets representing
more than one gene. Using the 'Genevestigator' probe
selection tool we identified all genes recognized by these
probe sets, and if more than one probe set was present for
a given gene, we selected a single, specific (if available)
probe set for that gene. This resulted in 216 selected probe
sets; of these 191 recognize a single P450 gene, 21 recognize two genes, 3 probe sets may hybridize with three
genes and one recognizes four genes for a total of the 227

represented P450s, and three non-P450 genes (flanking
genes that are also recognized by the probe set). The probe
sets used and the genes recognized by these probe sets can
be found at the 'CYPedia' home page.
We then retrieved normalized expression data for these
probe sets from the 'Genevestigator Digital Northern' tool
[10]. Data were downloaded in May 2005 (dataset 1), covering 1,823 microarray experiments, and in April 2006
(dataset 2, an update including dataset 1) covering 2,202
microarrays. For each probe set, background was defined
as the average signal intensity of all probes called 'absent'
by the Affymetrix software, and all absent probes were set
to this background value. If replicate arrays were available,
the mean intensity of all replicates was determined. Each
experiment was placed in one of the following four categories: i) organ and tissue samples from wild type plants,
ii) stress treatment of wild type plants, iii) hormone,
nutrient (deprivation), and other treatments of wild type
plants, and iv) mutant plants compared to wild type samples treated equally (if applicable). Signal intensities from
organ and tissue samples were then compared to the background intensities, thus generating log2-ratios over background. Intensities from both treatment groups were
compared to signal intensities from the corresponding
control samples generating log2-ratios comparing treatment with control, and intensities from mutant samples
were compared with intensities from equally treated wild
type samples thereby generating log2-ratios for mutants
compared to wild-type. Each dataset was divided into 30
expression groups using K-means clustering and the combined heatmaps from all clusters can be found at the
'CYPedia' home page following the link 'view matrices'.
For visualization of the expression matrices the 'HeatMapper' tool at the 'Bio-Array Resource (BAR)' [9] was used
and the resulting heatmaps were incorporated into commonly used spreadsheet formats (Adobe PDF, Microsoft
Excel and OpenOffice Calc).
Selection of metabolic genes
A list of genes related to any aspect of plant metabolism
(pathway database) was generated by retrieving all A. thaliana genes, which were annotated in the following databases: i) 'KEGG Orthology (KO) – Arabidopsis thaliana'
(KEGG) [59], ii) the 'Metabolic Pathways' at 'The Arabidopsis Information Resource' (AraCyc) [60]; iii) the 'Arabidopsis Lipid Gene Database' (AcylLipid) [61], iv) the
'Biochemical Pathway Knowledge Database' (BioPathAt)
[34], v) a selection of publications devoted to the annotation of secondary metabolic pathways (Litpath) [3033,35,62]. Information from all databases were combined
in one data matrix and Affymetrix probe sets were selected
for the set of unique genes as described above resulting in
4,129 unique probe sets. For this set of genes, annotations
were added that were derived from the 'Functional Cata-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/47

logue' at the 'Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences (MIPS-FunCat) [36] and manually curated
'GeneOntology' terms from TAIR [63] (i.e. having the evidence codes IDA [inferred from direct assay], IMP
[inferred from mutant phenotype] and/or TAS [traceable
author statement].
Each gene was given a pathway annotation score with: ten
points for biochemically characterized genes (i.e. annotation as 'functional' in 'AcylLipid' or 'BioPath', or identified
in literature reviews); nine points for genes with immediate biochemical function described as IDA in TAIR-GO,
eight point for genes annotated as 'functional(?)' or
'inferred from mutant phenotype' in 'AcylLipid', 'BioPath', or literature; seven points for genes with evidence
code IMP at TAIR-GO; six points for genes with a
described mutant phenotype, but with unclear molecular
function; five points for genes with high similarity (WUBLAST e < 10-50) to a characterized plant gene; four point
for genes with high similarities to another plant gene, but
function of that gene not validated; three points for genes
with similarity (WU-BLAST 10-10e < 10-50) to a characterized plant gene; two points for genes with low similarities
(WU-BLAST e > 10-10) to a characterized plant gene; one
point for members of large gene families with low similarities (WU-BLAST e > 10-10) to a characterized plant gene.
Co-expression analysis and pathway mapping
Affymetrix expression data for the selected 4,129 probe
sets were retrieved and processed as described above for
the P450s and the expression matrices were merged. Coexpression analysis was performed as described earlier [9].
In brief, expression vectors were mean-centered and Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) were calculated
between the expression vector of each P450 and those of
the 4,129 genes in the "pond" for each data set. Subsequent manipulations were performed using the R environment [64]. For each P450 and data set co-expressed
genes with r > 0.5 were retrieved and the corresponding
biochemical pathways were extracted from the pathway
database (see above). For each pathway, the number of
co-expressed genes was counted and the sum of annotation scores (see above) was calculated. The pathway was
retained only when at least one gene in the list had more
than six annotation points. The number and the score of
co-expressed genes in a given pathway was compared to
the total number and score of all genes in that pathway.
Based on a tailed hypergeometric distribution analysis
only pathways over-represented in the group of coexpressed genes (p [hyper] < 0.005) were retained. Subsequently, pathways identified in all four datasets were
identified and the number and scores of genes found in
each dataset were summed. The resulting tables were
sorted according to scores and imported into an OpenOffice Calc (OpenOffice.org) template and thumbnails of

the actual expression heatmaps, generated using the
'Heatmapper plus' tool at the 'BAR' [9], were added and
saved in html format. Results for each P450 can be found
at the 'Pathway Map' webpage for each P450. Expression
data and pathway information data for co-expressed genes
(r > 0.5 for a maximum of 50 genes) were merged and
sorted according to r-value. Expression tables were color
coded using the 'Heatmapper plus' tool at the 'BAR' and
saved as static web pages linked to the corresponding
pathway maps.
Array platform comparison
P450 expression data generated using a spotted microarray covering gene specific PCR products were retrieved
from the 'Functional Genomics of Arabidopsis P450s'
web page (Table 1). Using this dual channel platform
(CYP-array), signal intensities in roots from 1 week old
seedlings (and four other organs) were generated by comparison to a 'universal RNA' sample. This 'universal RNA'
consists of a mixture of RNAs derived from roots and
shoots from seedlings and leaves, stems and flowers from
mature plants [2]. In order to generate a similar 'universal
control' from public ATH1 microarrays, we selected 14
shoot samples from seedlings, 9 leaf samples from mature
plants, 17 root samples from seedlings, 19 whole flower
samples, and 10 stem samples from the processed organ
data set (see above). We then calculated the mean log2
intensities over background form all samples and compared it to the mean intensity of the root samples and
thereby created root/'universal control' ratios similar to
those from the CYP-array. For the latter, not detectable
intensities were artificially set to a ratio of 0.05 compared
to the universal control and ratios were log2-transformed.
Expression data for genes represented on both platforms
were mean centered across the experiments. Based on a
linear regression model comparing the two data sets an R2
value was calculated.
