Bacterial diversity at different stages of the
composting process

Abstract
Background: Composting is an aerobic microbiological process that is facilitated by bacteria and fungi.
Composting is also a method to produce fertilizer or soil conditioner. Tightened EU legislation now requires
treatment of the continuously growing quantities of organic municipal waste before final disposal. However, some
full-scale composting plants experience difficulties with the efficiency of biowaste degradation and with the
emission of noxious odours. In this study we examine the bacterial species richness and community structure of an
optimally working pilot-scale compost plant, as well as a full-scale composting plant experiencing typical problems.
Bacterial species composition was determined by isolating total DNA followed by amplifying and sequencing the
gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA.
Results: Over 1500 almost full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were analysed and of these, over 500 were
present only as singletons. Most of the sequences observed in either one or both of the composting processes
studied here were similar to the bacterial species reported earlier in composts, including bacteria from the phyla
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus. In addition, a number of
previously undetected bacterial phylotypes were observed. Statistical calculations estimated a total bacterial
diversity of over 2000 different phylotypes in the studied composts.
Conclusions: Interestingly, locally enriched or evolved bacterial variants of familiar compost species were observed
in both composts. A detailed comparison of the bacterial diversity revealed a large difference in composts at the
species and strain level from the different composting plants. However, at the genus level, the difference was
much smaller and illustrated a delay of the composting process in the full-scale, sub-optimally performing plants.

Background
Composting is an aerobic process, during which organic
waste is biologically degraded by micro-organisms to
humus-like material. The end product should not contain pathogens or viable seeds, and it should be stable
and suitable for use as a soil amendment [1]. Many factors such as oxygen content, moisture, composition of
the feed, pH, and temperature, affect the composting
process and ultimately the end product. Furthermore,
these parameters are strongly connected.
The source of separated biowaste, as collected and
treated in the Nordic countries and other cold climate
areas, primarily consists of food waste which in itself
has a low pH and contains high quantities of

carbohydrates that form organic acids upon degradation.
The low initial pH limits microbial activity and delays
the increase in temperature [2,3].
In recent years, composting has attracted much attention as a viable and environmentally sensible alternative
for treatment of organic municipal waste. In 2005, the
European commission prohibited final deposition of
municipal waste in landfills without prior treatment
(Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC). Currently there are 22
composting plants for municipal organic waste in Finland. Unfortunately, a number of problems have
appeared in many of these plants [4]. Due to insufficient
aeration of the drum or tunnel composting units, or
from running the units at overcapacity, the start-up of
the composting process is in many cases slow which
delays reaching the thermophilic phase of the process.
The resulting immature material emerging from the
drums/tunnels requires a prolonged maturation and

stabilization in windrows. Malodorous emissions from
these windrows have in some cases been extensive [3].
Immature compost can also be a health-risk for people/
workers handling the compost mass and may preclude
its use as a fertilizer.
Both bacteria and fungi are present and active in a typical composting process [5]. Earlier studies have revealed
that major bacterial groups in the beginning of the composting process are mesophilic organic acid producing
bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp. and Acetobacter spp.
[6]. Later, at the thermophilic stage, Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus spp. and Actinobacteria, become
dominant [7]. However, it has been observed that the
most efficient composting process is achieved by mixed
communities of bacteria and fungi [8].
As the traditional, cultivation based methods have
many recognised limitations regarding the coverage of
the identification of microbes in a sample, methods based
on molecular techniques have become popular. Fingerprinting methods, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), phospholipid fatty acid analysis
(PLFA), restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) and single strand-conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) [9-20] have been found to focus on the most
abundant groups, while deep characterisation of compost
microbes through cloning and sequencing has not been
carried out. With these fingerprinting methods the
numerically rare sequence types are not generally
detected [21]. Furthermore, most of these studies have
been carried out in small laboratory-scale batch processes
and the results cannot be directly extrapolated to fullscale processes. The volumes and masses involved in fullscale processes result in huge differences in heat loss,
compaction of the material and exchange of gaseous substances when compared to laboratory scale setups.
The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial
diversity at different stages of composting in both pilotand full-scale composting plants. As microbes play a key
role in the composting, the knowledge of the microbial
communities present at different stages of the composting
process and in differently functioning processes is of value.
Understanding the microbiology of composting is critical
for understanding the process itself, and for finding new
methods to boost the process and improve the final product. In a recent study by Hultman and colleagues [22]
the fungal communities in the same samples were extensively studied by cloning and sequencing. Clear differences
were detected between the fungal communities in optimally and suboptimally functioning processes.

Methods
Sampling

Samples were collected from the Kiertokapula Ltd. waste
management facility (full-scale composting unit) situated

Page 2 of 11

in Hyvinkää, Finland, and from a 5 m3 pilot-scale composting unit situated at the waste management facility
of Päijät-Häme Waste Disposal Ltd. in Lahti, Finland.
The two units located ca 70 km apart, were fed with
comparable, source separated municipal biowaste, typical for the region in Southern Finland [22]. In both the
pilot-scale composting unit (5 m3 drum) and in the fullscale combined drum and tunnel unit (160 m3), municipal biowaste mixed with wood chips, was loaded into
the feeding end of the drum. The Kiertokapula composting plant consists of two rotating drums (each 160
m 3 ), followed by an aerated tunnel composting unit
(Figure 1). The retention time in the full-scale drums
was approximately 3 days, and in the tunnel between
14-21 days. More details of these composting plants and
how sampling was carried out has been described elsewhere [22]. Information on the sampling and the physical-chemical properties at the sampling dates is
illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 1. pH was measured as
described by Sundberg et al. [2]. The retention time in
the pilot-scale drum was 7 days, except that the approximate age (time after loading) of the first unloading end
sample was 39 days.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

DNA was extracted from compost samples using Fast
DNA®SPIN kit for soil according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qbiogene Inc., Carlsbad, USA). DNA
extracted from compost samples was used as a template
for the PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA genes with
primers pA and pH’ [23]. The 50 μl PCR reaction mixture contained 1 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.5 mM of betaine, 2.5%
of dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.2-1 μl of template DNA, 5 μl of
F-516 10× DyNAzyme buffer, 1 U of DyNAzyme II
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and 0.05
U of Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The Pfu-polymerase was used to minimize the PCR
derived errors [24]. Thermal cycling was carried out by
initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 24
amplification cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 1
min, with a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min (Gradient Cycler PTC-225 Peltier Thermal Cycler PCR-apparatus, MJ Research, Waltham, USA). A low cycle
number was used to avoid PCR artefact formation. The
PCR products were purified with purification plates
(Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) using water suction
(Ashcroft ® , Berea, USA). In order to enable efficient
ligation, A-nucleotide-overhangs were inserted to the 3’
ends of the PCR products in a 50 μl reaction containing
5 μl of F-516 10× DyNAzyme buffer, 250 μM of deoxynucleoside triphosphate and 1 U of DyNAzyme II DNA
polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) at 72°C for 1 h.

Time in days after loading of material into composting unit

The products were purified with MicroSpin™ S-400 HR
Columns (Amersham Bioscences, Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, UK). The PCR products were cloned using the
Qiagen Cloningplus-easy kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the
following modifications: the ligation mixture contained 4
μl of insert DNA and 0.2 μl of vector. A 3 μl aliquot of the
ligation mixture was used for the transformation. The rest
of the cloning and sequencing procedure was carried out
as described [25] with the following variations: inserts
from clones were amplified using universal vector primers,
and sequencing reactions were carried out with the universal pD’, pE, and pF’ primers [23]. All primers were
obtained from Oligomer Ltd. (Helsinki, Finland).

Sequencing analysis

The 16S rRNA gene sequences were edited and
assembled using the Staden Software Package [26] and
sequences with ≥ 99% similarity were grouped to OTUs.
OTUs were compared against the EMBL-all database
using the FASTA program [27]. Sequences with < 95%
match were classified as unknown bacteria, sequences
with 95-97% similarity were classified according to
genus, and sequences with > 97% similarity were identified to the species level based on sequences matched in
the EMBL-all database. A representative sequence of
each OTU has been deposited in EMBL sequence database under the accession numbers FN667019FN667540.

Phylogenetic analysis

Services of CSC (Finnish IT Center for Science, Espoo,
Finland) were used for phylogenetic analysis for 16S
rRNA genes. The sequences were aligned with ClustalX
version 1.8 using the default settings [28], and the phylogenetic tree was built using the neighbour-joining
method [29] and by bootstrapping datasets with 1000
replicates. The cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis
(AB016520) was used as an outgroup, and the tree was
edited and illustrated using the NJ-Blot program [30].
Check of putative chimeric sequences

Sequences were checked with Bellerophon’s chimera
detection program [31]. Putative chimeric sequences
were further checked with the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP) chimera check program [32].

reached only temporarily in the unloading end of the
drum 3-4 days after feeding (average 45°C) and more
consistently in the tunnel compartment (50-70°C), 4-7
days after feeding. Also the pH rose faster and to a
higher level in the pilot-scale composting unit than in
the full-scale composting plant (Table 1). In addition,
the bulk density (g/l) was found to change during the
processes (Table 1).
16S ribosomal RNA libraries

For analysis of bacterial population diversity, 16S rRNA
genes were amplified from the total DNA extracted
from compost samples. From the cloned fragment 1560
almost full-length 16S rRNA sequences were generated;
924 sequences from the pilot-scale unit and 636 from
the full-scale composting plant. The suspected chimeric
sequences (23) were removed before further analyses.

Estimations for real diversity of bacteria

In order to obtain an estimate of the real diversity of
bacteria in different samples from differently working
composting plants, both richness and coverage estimates
were calculated. This was achieved using the Chao1model [33], the Simpson’s reciprocal index and Simpson’s Index of Diversity [34], and the ACE-model [35]
for modelling the diversity of bacteria.
Unifrac analysis

For weighted UniFrac distance metric analyses [36] the
sequences were aligned with Muscle [37] and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The environmental file linking the sequences to different stages of the composting
process was used in the UniFrac calculations. As a result
a UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic mean, a technique that merges the closest pair of
environments or clusters of environments at each step)
cluster of samples, based on the phylogenetic lineages
(sequences) they contained, was created.

Results
Physical characteristics of the composting process

A total of 18 compost samples were collected; 8 from
the pilot-scale composting unit and 10 from the fullscale composting plant (Table 1). During the sampling
period, the full-scale composting plant was operating
under sub-optimal conditions; the temperature and pH
rose slowly to the levels typical for thermophilic composting. The pilot-scale compost unit, in contrast, was
operating under optimal conditions and the composting
process progressed well.
The temperature in the pilot-scale compost rose
quickly to the thermophilic stage. Within two days after
feeding waste into the feeding end of the drum, the
average temperature exceeded 50°C, while in the fullscale composting unit the thermophilic phase was

Diversity of bacteria

Of the 1560 sequences generated, a total of 522 OTUs
unique to either the pilot or full-scale facility were
found with 99% sequence similarity clustering. A total
of 267 sequences were found in samples from the fullscale composting plants and 275 sequences were present
in the pilot-scale compost. Surprisingly, only 20
sequenced OTUs were found in both composting units.
Also at the species level only a small fraction of the
OTUs were shared. Out of 210 species found in the
full-scale unit and 166 in the pilot-scale unit, only 32
were present in both. On the genus level the portion of
shared sequences was larger. Out of 27 genera in the
full-scale unit, and 41 in the pilot-scale unit, 18 were
present in both.
The sequences belonged to five bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and
Deinococcus-Thermus) based on a phylogenetic analysis.
Despite the large difference in the distribution of bacterial sequences, most bacterial phyla observed were found
in both composting units (Figure 2, Figure 3). Since
sequences representing the Firmicutes were by far the
largest group, this phylum was further divided into the
classes Bacillales, Clostridia and Lactobacillales in order
to study the community composition (Figure 2).
Based on the observed frequencies of similar sequence
types, bacterial sequences were thus divided into six
main groups: Actinobacteria, Bacillus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Thermoactinomyces and Acetobacter.
Sequences included in the above mentioned groups
were those classified up to the genus or species level.
The group, “other bacteria” included bacterial sequences
representing other bacterial classes and genera than the
six bacterial classes or genera used here. The uncultured-group included sequences that are reported as
uncultured bacteria in the EMBL database and the

used. The scale bar shows the distance between clusters in UniFrac units: a distance of 0 means that two environments are identical and a
distance of 1 means that two environments contain mutually exclusive lineages. Shading was used to differentiate the three nodes representing
different stages of the process.

unclassified-group represent sequences with no
close similarity to sequences in the nucleotide database
(Figure 2).
In order to compare the communities in different
stages of the composting process and in the two different scales studied, the UniFrac metric analysis was used
[36]. UniFrac measures the differences between two
environments by the fraction of the total branch length

in a phylogenetic tree that leads to sequences from one
community or the other but not both [36]. An UPGMA
clustering was conducted for the environments with the
phylogenetic tree containing the 522 OTUs and the
annotation file containing the sampling information and
number of sequenced in the OTUs (Figure 3). Based on
a redundancy analysis the abundance of Acetobacter and
Lactobacillus groups was found to be related to low pH

Partanen et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/94

whereas the presence of Actinobacteria was related to
the age, i.e. time elapsed after the feeding of composting
material (data not shown).
The feed samples were clustered in the UPGMA tree
(Figure 3) to the same node. In the sequence analysis no
bacterial species or genus was dominating and a diverse
community was detected. In the feeding end of the
drum of both the pilot- and the full-scale composting
units, by far the most common sequences one day after
feeding belonged to the Lactobacillus group. Also a
remarkable number, 17%-28%, of the sequences in the
full-scale unit samples were members of the Acetobacter
genus (Figure 2). In Unifrac clustering the samples from
the feeding end of the drum of both scales clustered
together (Figure 3), with the exception of sample PS7. It
contained more sequences similar to Actinobacteria
than the other samples from the feeding end of the
pilot-scale unit, and clustered with samples from drum
unloading ends. In addition, samples FS3 and FS4, from
the full-scale unloading end of the drum and from the
tunnel, clustered with the feeding end of the drum samples of the pilot-scale process.
At the sequence level the major difference between
bacterial profiles from the feeding end of the drum of
the pilot- and full-scale unit was that the pilot-scale
compost contained much higher numbers of sequences
closely related to Bacillus (up to 45%) and Actinobacteria (up to 42%, Figure 2). The full-scale unit reached
the phase where Bacillus become predominant only at
the unloading end of the drum which contained
approximately 3-day old material. The unloading end of
both types of drums contained a large proportion of
Bacillus sequences. Sequences of Actinobacteria clearly
formed the largest group (2%-78%) in the 5-14 day old
compost mass of the unloading end of the pilot-scale
compost. In the unloading end of the full-scale drum
(ca. 3 day old material), Actinobacterial sequences were
not found, whereas many sequences of Lactobacillus
were still present in some of the samples (in FS10 50%
of all sequences, Figure 2).
In the full-scale facility composting continued in the
tunnels. The compost from the tunnel contained large
amounts of Bacillus sequences (4%-52%), and sequences
which belonged to Thermoactinomyces (0-22%), and
Actinobacteria (0-6%). Only one Lactobacillus sp.
sequence was found in the tunnel of the full-scale composting unit. Based on the UniFrac analysis the situation
in the tunnel of the full-scale composting plant was
comparable to the situation in the unloading end of the
drum in the pilot-scale unit (Figure 3) as the samples
formed a distinct cluster. The major difference between
the pilot-scale unloading end and the tunnel of the fullscale plant was that the tunnel contained higher numbers of Clostridium spp. sequences indicating oxygen

limitation (Figure 2). The percentage of Clostridium-like
sequences was highest (85%) in the tunnel sample FS11
which clustered apart from the drum unloading end and
the other tunnel samples.
Estimations of total bacterial diversity

Estimations of the fraction of total bacterial diversity
covered ranged from 15% to 67%, depending on the estimation model used. The true diversity of different samples estimated by the ACE model ranged from 12-671
species (coverage: 17-67%), and with the Chao model
from 12-658 species (coverage: 18-67%). Simpson’s reciprocal index varied from 1.5-137, and Simpson’s index
of diversity from 0.31-0.99. The results obtained with
the ACE model, the Chao model and Simpson’s reciprocal index, and Simpson’s index of diversity were fairly
congruent with each other (Table 2). The highest diversity was found in the sample PS1 in the beginning of
the pilot scale drum with 658-672 estimated species.
The Chao model could not be used for the sample PS3
because it did not contain any doubleton sequences.

Discussion
The microbial community and its physical and chemical
changes during the composting process have received
much attention during recent years. However, the picture of the community structure of composting generated by earlier studies, based on cultivation,
Phospholipid Fatty-acid Analysis (PLFA), Denaturing
Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) or Single Strand
Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP), has not been as
wide nor as specific at the genus and species level as the
one presented here. In earlier studies, such as those by
Adams and Frostick [38] and Takaku et al. [39],
sequences obtained via DGGE analysis are identified, in
some cases to the species level, but the total number of
clones sequenced is relatively small. In this study we
used a DNA-cloning and sequencing based method to
determine, as broadly as possible, the bacterial diversity
during the active early phases of composting. The targeted composting units were a pilot-scale unit and a
full-scale composting facility. Both units were run semicontinuously using normal source-separated household
bio-waste as the substrate. At the full-scale facility also
the conditions were realistic with all the challenges of
running the unit as efficiently as possible. For economical and capacity reasons, there is always a tendency to
push the capacity limits, minimize the retention time,
and the usage of matrix material (wood chips), at fullscale plants. This may lead to unwanted compacting of
the material and suboptimal aeration, with all the consequences that this may have on pH, odour emissions, and
loss of efficiency. The full-scale unit used in this study
was typical in this sense.

Time in days after loading of material into composting unit

The pilot-scale unit thus represented an optimized
situation, but running with parameters that realistically
could be implemented in full-scale units. The amount of
matrix material was sufficient to guarantee good
exchange of gas, and the feeding schedule was designed
to obtain efficient composting, instead of trying to treat
maximal amounts of waste. Since the conditions
observed in the studied full-scale unit are very common
among composting plants in at least the Nordic countries (M. Romantschuk, unpublished), the results presented here have more relevance for people doing
commercial composting at full scale rather than composting in ideal conditions with no pressure of maximal
usage of the capacity. On the other hand, the comparison made here may help in finding the key parameters
for transforming a suboptimally functioning unit
towards improved performance. Furthermore, in both
the case of the suboptimally working, and the optimized
unit, the bacterial community analysis presented is the
broadest and most accurate ever performed in the area
of composting.
Bacterial diversity in full-scale samples

The bacteria found in the feed were as expected mesophilic bacteria, such as members of the Lactobacillus,
Leuconostoc and Pseudomonas genera, typical for
organic household waste [40,41]. Interestingly, the feed
also contained sequences related to the thermophilic
Thermus genus. The waste was processed at waste treatment stations, which means that material from old

waste and mature compost may inoculate the incoming
waste. Bacteria may be present throughout the composting process as active or dormant cells, or as spores.
Only their numbers and level of activity change during
the composting process [42]. The diversity and the
numbers of bacteria divided into different OTUS was
more evident in the feed than at later stages, which is
likely to reflect the fact that the composting process and
competition for nutrients had not yet started [1].
Since the temperatures rose rather slowly from ambient (0°C - 25°C) to the mesophilic range (25°C - 45°C),
it is not surprising that sequences of mesophilic bacteria
were still found in the feeding end of the drum in the
full-scale composting unit. The low pH in the feeding
end of the drum is apparently a result of the high occurrence of lactic acid bacteria in combination with ample
fermentable sugars which are broken down to form lactic acid and other organic acids, plus carbon dioxide
and ethanol in oxygen limited conditions [6,43]. It is
known that many lactic acid bacteria possess an ability
to produce antibiotic compounds [44], which could
partly explain the low levels of other bacterial genera in
some samples. In addition, many Lactobacillus species
are known to live in close interaction with yeasts. Several yeast species are known to posses the ability to stimulate certain Lactobacillus species to produce lactic
acid [45]. The high concentrations of both lactic acid
bacteria and yeasts from genera Saccharomyces, Candida and Geotrichum [22], producing lactic acid and
ethanol, respectively, indicate oxygen limited conditions.

Partanen et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/94

The presence of Acetobacter-like phylotypes in the feeding end of the drum is explained by the fact that those
bacteria use substances produced by lactic acid bacteria
and by yeasts as growth substrates [46,47].
The oxygen-limited conditions appear to persist in the
unloading end of the drum, apparently as a result of a
high moisture content and poor aeration. This is in
agreement with the fact that a large fraction of the
sequences clustered with the Clostridium-group and the
closely related Megasphaera. High numbers of yeast-like
sequences from genera Pichia, Candida and Issatchenkia
were also detected in the unloading end of the drum
phase [22]. This location appears to represent a transition phase since some species of Bacillus were becoming
abundant. These typically aerobic species and the anaerobic Clostridium are known to metabolize relatively
recalcitrant materials such as cellulose and lignin. In
addition, species of Bacillus are known to secrete catabolic enzymes, such as proteases, which through proteolysis may raise the pH, as earlier suggested in the case
of composting [48] and soy product fermentation [49].
Truly thermophilic composting conditions were only
reached in the tunnel of the full-scale composting unit.
In samples FS4 and FS8 a high concentration of phylotypes clustered with Bacillus and Thermoactinomyces.
Only one sequence clustering with Lactobacillus was
detected in sample FS4. The high number of Clostridium sequences in the tunnel sample FS11 suggests that
the oxygen supply may be restricted even in the tunnel
phase. In the samples FS9 and FS10 taken on the same
day from different stages of the process, the sequences
clustering with the Lactobacillus-group were particularly
abundant - the percentages of these sequences were
63% and 50% respectively. Although the full-scale facility
did not represent an optimal composting process, it
does represent a typical situation at many full-scale
composting plants.
Bacteria in the pilot-scale composting unit

Also in the pilot-scale unit the high concentration of
Lactobacillus spp. as well as numerous Acetobacter spp.
sequences is symptomatic of low pH and mesophilic
temperatures in the beginning of the composting process. However, a relatively high concentration of Bacillus spp. sequences in samples from the feeding end of
the drum suggests that decomposition of proteins and
amino acids had started. Also, higher numbers of Actinobacteria, compared to compost of equal age from the
full-scale feeding end, indicates the beginning of the
decomposition of slowly degradable material like lignin
and cellulose.
The high temperature and high pH environment in
the unloading end of the pilot-scale drum represents an
active stage of composting where Actinobacteria and

Page 9 of 11

Bacillus spp. at high concentrations have started to
decompose hemi-cellulose, cellulose and lignin, as
reported also by Yu and colleagues [50]. The fungal
community of these samples comprised of termotolerant
Zygomycota and Pezizomycota [22]. The concentration
of Lactobacillus spp. sequences had dropped below
detection in the unloading end of the drum which indicates lack of carbohydrates and/or a too high temperature for this bacterial group. Clostridium spp. sequences
were found in small amounts in both the feeding end
and the unloading end of the pilot-scale composting
unit. Even optimally working municipal waste composts
can contain anaerobic pockets allowing the presence of
about 1% anaerobic bacterial species [51].
Comparison of bacterial community composition

The status in the feeding end of the drum in the pilotscale compost was comparable to the same stage in the
full-scale composting plant as was shown in the
UPGMA clustering. The major difference was the high
concentration of sequences from Bacillus spp. and to
some extent, Actinobacteria, in the pilot drum. This
indicates a more efficient and faster composting process
in the pilot-scale drum during this initial phase.
The environment and the bacterial distribution in the
unloading end of the pilot-scale drum were more similar
to the full-scale tunnel than the full-scale drum unloading end. This reflects a slower composting process in
the full-scale composting unit resulting from lower oxygen levels. The amounts of the Gram-negative bacteria
declined sharply in both units when the temperature
reached the thermophilic phase, which is in agreement
with results reported by Dees and Ghiorse [52].
It seems apparent that a high concentration of lactic
acid bacteria indicates an early phase of the composting
process and/or slow, suboptimal composting, while a
high concentration of Bacillus spp. indicates a shift
from the mesophilic to the thermophilic phase. At the
thermophilic stage, Actinobacteria and Thermoactinomyces spp. mark a fast, well-aerated composting process
while Clostridium spp. and other closely related species
indicate an oxygen-limited environment, in spite of thermophilic temperatures and high pH.
Based on the observation that very few OTUs were
found to be shared by both composting units, even in
comparable conditions, it appears unlikely that a single
strain or species can be used as an indicator of a certain
phase or condition in the process. However, the data
suggest that the bacterial families or genera mentioned
above may be used, since a high correlation was seen
between physical-chemical conditions and abundance of
major genera. This notion opens up new possibilities for
qPCR in compost evaluation. Although dead cells or
released DNA may skew the result of any PCR based

Partanen et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/94

analysis, this is a relatively small problem in a composting environment with its extremely rapid turnover of
organic material - dead cells degrade rapidly as shown
for example by the rapid decline in lactobacilli in both
composting units. We observed similar rapid changes in
the fungal communities [22].
Estimations for real diversity of bacteria

Estimations of coverage ranged between 15% and 67%,
and all estimation models, the ACE model, Chao model
and Simpson’s reciprocal index and diversity index, gave
fairly similar results (Table 2). This suggests that they
all give comparable and equally reliable approximations
[33-35].
It can be argued that estimation models based on PCR
results are unreliable - some sequences are over-represented or that major OTUs mask the presence of minor
OTUs. On the other hand PCR itself can favour one
sequence over another [53]. However, although high
amounts of sequences representing Lactobacillus spp.
were observed in some samples, the method still
revealed a high total diversity in the same samples. This
study demonstrated that minor bacterial species could
be amplified and cloned. Furthermore, the proportions
of different bacteria were similar in comparison to
results from earlier reports using other methods [5,6,8].
We can conclude that the bacterial community composition and the physical and chemical conditions in the
composting mass were related. This observation is
neither new nor surprising but to our knowledge, the
bacterial diversity present during the active phase of
composting has not been studied in such detail. The
approach used here enabled us to include all the major
phylotypes, as well as a wide range of less abundant
phylotypes in the comparison of microbial communities
present during composting. As a result, many phylotypes
without reference sequences were found. Amplification
and cloning of ribosomal genes using universal bacterial
primers does bring its own inherent biases, but these
are likely to be much smaller than with other methods
used in the past, particularly when over 1500 individual
fragments have been sequenced.

Conclusions
Diagnosing a composting facility by microbial community structure analysis can be done, but with the
approach used here, it becomes very expensive and time
consuming. Rapid and relatively simple methods based
on quantitative PCR or DNA micro-arrays may, however, become feasible in the near future.
The utility of the comparison made in this study has
been demonstrated after finishing the empirical phase of
the study. Namely, by adjusting the conditions at the
full-scale composting facility to mimic those of the pilot

Page 10 of 11

scale unit, the performance of the Kiertokapula composting plant has improved remarkably (data not
shown). The main adjustments made were: (i) increasing
the proportion of wood chips used as the matrix material (effect on bulk density), (ii) monitoring and adjusting the pH using wood ash, (iii) improving the internal
aeration of the composting mass. The environmental
burden in the form of noxious odours has disappeared,
and no complaints from residents in the area have been
received since early 2007.
