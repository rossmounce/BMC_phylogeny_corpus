Abstract
Cartilage destruction in the arthritides is thought to be mediated
by two main enzyme families: the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) are responsible for cartilage collagen breakdown, and
enzymes from the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
domain with thrombospondin motifs) family mediate cartilage
aggrecan loss. Many genes subject to transcriptional control are
regulated, at least in part, by modifications to chromatin,
including acetylation of histones. The aim of this study was to
examine the impact of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors on
the expression of metalloproteinase genes in chondrocytes and
to explore the potential of these inhibitors as chondroprotective
agents. The effects of HDAC inhibitors on cartilage degradation
were assessed using a bovine nasal cartilage explant assay. The
expression and activity of metalloproteinases was measured
using real-time RT-PCR, western blot, gelatin zymography, and

collagenase
activity
assays
using
both
SW1353
chondrosarcoma cells and primary human chondrocytes. The
HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate potently
inhibit cartilage degradation in an explant assay. These
compounds decrease the level of collagenolytic enzymes in
explant-conditioned culture medium and also the activation of
these enzymes. In cell culture, these effects are explained by the
ability of HDAC inhibitors to block the induction of key MMPs
(e.g. MMP-1 and MMP-13) by proinflammatory cytokines at both
the mRNA and protein levels. The induction of aggrecandegrading enzymes (e.g. ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, and
ADAMTS9) is also inhibited at the mRNA level. HDAC inhibitors
may therefore be novel chondroprotective therapeutic agents in
arthritis by virtue of their ability to inhibit the expression of
destructive metalloproteinases by chondrocytes.

Introduction

Normal cartilage ECM is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with
a balance between synthesis and degradation. For the degradative process, the major players are metalloproteinases that
degrade the ECM, and their inhibitors. Pathological cartilage
destruction can therefore be viewed as a disruption of this balance, favouring proteolysis.

Articular cartilage is made up of two main extracellular-matrix
(ECM) macromolecules, namely, type II collagen and aggrecan (a large, aggregating proteoglycan) [1,2]. The type II collagen scaffold endows the cartilage with its tensile strength,
while the aggrecan, by virtue of its high negative charge, draws
water into the tissue, swelling against the collagen network,
and enabling the tissue to resist compression. Quantitatively
more minor components (e.g. types IX, XI, and VI collagens;
biglycan; decorin; cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; etc.)
also have important roles in controlling matrix structure and
organisation [2].

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of 23
enzymes in man that facilitate turnover and breakdown of the
ECM in both physiology and pathology. The MMP family contains the only mammalian proteinases that can specifically
degrade the collagen triple helix at neutral pH. These include

ADAMTS = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM) with thrombospondin motifs; APMA = 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; DMEM =
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM = extracellular matrix; FCS = fetal calf serum; HDAC = histone deacetylase; IC50 = median inhibitory
concentration; IL = interleukin; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; NaBy = sodium butyrate; OSM = oncostatin M; PCR = polymerase chain reaction;
RT = reverse transcriptase; TIMP = tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; TNF = tumour necrosis factor; TSA = trichostatin A.

the 'classical' collagenases – MMP-1, -8, and -13 – and also
MMP-2 and MMP-14 (which cleave the triple helix with less
catalytic efficiency). The enzyme(s) responsible for cartilage
collagen cleavage in the arthritides remains open to debate
[3].
A second group of metalloproteinases, the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin
motifs) family, consists of 19 members, including the so-called
'aggrecanases', currently ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, -8, -9, and -15 [47]. Current data support the hypothesis that aggrecanases are
active early in the disease process, with later increases in
MMP activity (several MMPs can also degrade aggrecan), but
the exact enzyme(s) responsible for cartilage aggrecan
destruction at any stage in arthritis is unclear [3,8,9].
A family of four specific inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), has been described. TIMPs are
endogenous inhibitors of MMPs and potentially of ADAMTSs
[10]. The ability of TIMP-1 to -4 to inhibit active MMPs is
largely promiscuous, though a number of functional differences have been uncovered. TIMP-3 appears to be the most
potent inhibitor of ADAMTSs, for example, with a subnanomolar Ki against ADAMTS-4 [3].
Metalloproteinase activity is regulated at multiple levels,
including gene transcription. However, the role of chromatin
modification, and in particular acetylation, is little researched in
the metalloproteinase arena. The packaging of eukaryotic
DNA into chromatin plays an important role in regulating gene
expression. The DNA is wound round a histone octamer consisting of two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and
H4, to form a nucleosome [11]. This unit is repeated at intervals of approximately 200 base pairs, with histone H1 associating with the intervening DNA. Nucleosomes are generally
repressive to transcription, hindering access of the transcriptional apparatus [11]. However, two major mechanisms modulate chromatin structure to allow transcriptional activity: ATPdependent nucleosome remodellers such as the Swi/Snf complex [12,13]; and the enzymatic modification of histones, via
acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation [14-16].
Acetylation by histone acetyltransferases occurs on specific
lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4.
This neutralisation of positive charge leads to a loosening of
the histone:DNA structure, allowing access of the transcriptional machinery; furthermore, the acetyl groups may associate
with and recruit factors containing bromodomains [11]. Many
transcriptional activators or coactivators have (or recruit) histone acetyltransferase activity, giving a mechanism whereby
acetylation can be targeted at specific gene promoters
[15,16]. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have also
been characterised. Hypoacetylation of histones associates
with transcriptional silence, and several transcriptional repressors and corepressors have been identified that have (or
R504

recruit) HDAC activity [17-19]. Nonhistone substrates of histone acetyltransferases have also been described, for example, p53, E2F, nuclear factor κB, Sp3, and c-Jun [20,21].
There are two families of HDACs, the NAD+-dependent, socalled SIR2 family (sometimes called class III HDACs), and the
classical HDAC family. The classical HDACs can be grouped
into three classes (I, II, and IV) based on phylogeny [22]. Class
I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) are related to yeast RPD3, and
class II HDACs (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) are more closely
related to yeast HDA1 [17]. HDAC11 alone represents class
IV, and HDAC11-related proteins have been described in all
eukaryotic organisms other than fungi [22]. Trichostatin A
(TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBy), are HDAC inhibitors
[23,24] with a broad spectrum of activity against class I and II
HDACs, but not the SIR2 family. Addition of these reagents to
cells should therefore block histone deacetylation and result in
increased acetylation of histones on susceptible genes. The
prediction would be that this would lead to an increase in gene
expression, and this is largely borne out experimentally. However, there are many instances of HDAC inhibitors acting as
repressors of gene expression [25-29].
HDAC inhibitors have potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities in cancer cells and this has led to the development of specific inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy. Such
compounds are currently in both preclinical development and
clinical trials [30].
Two recent reports demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors modulate gene expression in synovial cells [31]. In an animal model
of rheumatoid arthritis (adjuvant arthritis), the expression of
tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) was inhibited and this led to
a reduction in synovial hyperplasia and joint swelling with
maintenance of joint integrity [31]. Similar results were
obtained in an autoantibody-mediated murine model [32].
However, no study has looked at the effect of these inhibitors
on cartilage. Here, we show for the first time that HDAC inhibitors repress the expression of several members of the metalloproteinase family in chondrocytes and block cartilage
destruction in an ex vivo model system. Hence, inhibition of
HDAC activity offers a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent cartilage destruction in the arthritides.

Materials and methods
Cell culture
SW1353 human chondrosarcoma cells (ATCC, USA) were
routinely cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine, 100
IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Serum-free conditions used identical medium without fetal bovine serum. For
assays, cells were grown to confluency, then starved of serum
for 24 hours before the addition of IL-1α (R&D Systems) (5 ng/
ml) and oncostatin M (OSM) (R&D Systems) (10 ng/ml) in the
absence or presence of HDAC inhibitors (TSA, 50 to 500 ng/

Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/7/3/R503

ml, and NaBy, 1 to 10 mM) (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK).
Experiments were performed in six-well plates (Nunc, Fisher
Scientific, Loughborough, UK) with all conditions in duplicate
or triplicate. To obtain primary human chondrocytes, fresh
human articular cartilage samples (from patients undergoing
hip or knee replacement surgery at the Norfolk and Norwich
University Hospital) were digested overnight in DMEM containing 2 mg/ml of collagenase Type 1A (Sigma, Poole, UK).
The resulting cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in
DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics as above, and
then plated at 1 × 106 cells in 75-cm2 flasks. At confluence,
cells were passaged and replated at 1:2 dilution.
RNA isolation and synthesis of cDNA
RNA was isolated from monolayer cultures using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesised from 1 µg of total
RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
and random hexamers in a total volume of 20 µl according to
the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was stored at -20°C
until use in downstream PCR.
RT-PCR
For quantitative real-time PCR, sequences and validation for
MMP and TIMP primers and probes are as previously
described [33] and so are ADAMTS primers and probes [34].
In order to control against amplification of genomic DNA, primers were placed within different exons close to an intron/exon
boundary with the probe spanning two neighbouring exons
where possible. BLAST searches for all the primer and probe
sequences were also conducted to ensure gene specificity.
The 18 S ribosomal RNA gene was used as an endogenous
control to normalise for differences in the amount of total RNA
present in each sample; 18 S rRNA primers and probe were
purchased from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK).

Relative quantification of genes was performed using the ABI
Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems)
in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. PCR reactions contained 5 ng of reverse transcribed RNA (1 ng for 18
S analyses), 50% TaqMan 2X Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 100 nM of each primer, and 200 nM of probe in a total
volume of 25 µl. Conditions for the PCR reaction were 2 min
at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and then 40 cycles each consisting
of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
Conventional RT-PCR for collagen and aggrecan expression
was as previously described [35].
Cartilage degradation assay
Bovine nasal cartilage was cultured as previously described
[36]. Briefly, discs (approximately 2 mm in diameter by 1 to 2
mm thick) were punched from bovine nasal septum cartilage;
three discs per well in a 24-well plate were incubated overnight in control, serum-free medium (DMEM containing 25 mM
HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml

penicillin, 2.5 µg/ml gentamicin, and 40 u/ml nystatin). Fresh
control medium with or without test reagents (each condition
in quadruplicate) was then added (day 0). Cartilage was incubated until day 7 and supernates were harvested and replaced
with fresh medium containing the same test reagents as day 0.
On day 14, supernates were harvested and the remaining cartilage was digested with papain. The viability of cartilage
explants was assessed by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the conditioned medium (CytoTox 96 assay,
Promega, Southampton, UK). Hydroxyproline release was
assayed as a measure of collagen degradation [37], and glycosaminoglycan release was assayed as a measure of proteoglycan degradation [36]. Collagenase activity was
determined by the 3H-acetylated collagen diffuse fibril assay
using a 96-well plate modification [38] and a standard curve
and appropriate sample dilutions; one unit of collagenase
activity degraded 1 µg of collagen per minute at 37°C. APMA
(4-aminophenylmercuric acetate) was used to activate procollagenases [38]. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.
Gelatin zymography
Samples were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions
by SDS–PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels copolymerised
with 1% gelatin. Gels were washed vigorously twice for 15
min in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, then incubated
overnight in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH7.5, 5 mM CaCl2 at 37°C.
Gels were then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Parallel
gels were incubated in buffers containing either 5 mM EDTA
or 2 mM 1,10-phenanthroline to show that lysis of gelatin was
due to metalloproteinase activity.
Western blotting
Samples of conditioned culture medium were precipitated
with an equal volume of ice-cold 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid.
Precipitates were resuspened in loading buffer and electrophoresed under reducing conditions by SDS–PAGE in 10%
polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to an
Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Watford, UK) and probed
with either rabbit anti-(human MMP-1), [39], sheep anti(human MMP-1) [40], or sheep anti-(human MMP-13) [40].

Results
Histone deacetylase inhibitors block cartilage
resorption and concurrently decrease collagen- and
gelatin-degrading proteolytic activities
The combination of IL-1α and OSM has previously been
shown to reproducibly and potently induce cartilage proteoglycan and collagen proteolysis both in vitro and in vivo
[41,42]. The addition of TSA or NaBy to bovine nasal cartilage
explant culture stimulated to resorb with IL-1α and OSM
caused a dose-dependent (50 to 500 ng/ml TSA, 1 to 10 mM
NaBy) inhibition of both proteoglycan and collagen release (at
day 7 and 14 respectively) (Fig. 1). TSA is reported to have an
IC50 (median inhibitory concentration) in the nanomolar range

collagen loss induced by IL-1α/OSM
Histone deacetylase inhibitors block cartilage glycosaminoglycan and
collagen loss induced by IL-1α/OSM. Bovine nasal cartilage discs were
cultured in the presence or absence of I/O (a combination of IL-1α and
oncostatin M (OSM)) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, either (a) I/O
(1 ng/ml IL-1α, 10 ng/ml OSM) with trichostatin A (TSA) or (b) I/O (0.2
ng/ml IL-1α, 2 ng/ml OSM) with sodium butyrate (NaBy). Cartilage was
incubated until day 7 and supernates were harvested and replaced with
fresh reagents until day 14. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release is
shown as at day 7 and was assayed using the dimethylmethylene blue
method. Collagen release is shown as at day 14 and was measured
using an assay for hydroxyproline. Viability was assessed by measuring
lactate dehydrogenase in the conditioned medium. Assays were performed at least twice using quadruplicate samples; means ± standard
deviations are represented. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

(50 ng/ml = 165 nM), but this does vary depending upon the
HDAC and assay used (e.g. [43]); NaBy is reported to have an
IC50 in themillimolar range. The need for TSA, a hydroxamate,
to penetrate the highly negatively charged cartilage matrix will
also raise the effective IC50 in the cartilage explant assay. The
time points of medium collection, days 7 and 14, are those at
which release of, respectively, proteoglycan and collagen are
reproducibly close to 100%, since proteoglycan release is an
earlier event in cartilage degradation. At these time points, proteoglycan release showed less sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors
than collagen release, behaviour that may reflect its more rapid
kinetics. Indeed, in a preliminary experiment at day 3, where IL1α/OSM-induced proteoglycan release was approximately
50%, an increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors was seen
(data not shown). Lactate dehydrogenase release, used as a
measure of toxicity, was no greater in the presence of TSA or
NaBy (at any concentration) than in the comparator control
cultures (i.e. either without any addition or treated with IL-1α/
OSM) at either day 7 or day 14; furthermore, no dose-dependent effects of TSA or NaBy on the release of lactate dehydrogenase were observed (data not shown).
Figure 2a shows collagenase activity at day 14 in the absence
or presence of TSA, assayed in the conditioned medium from
the explant assay discussed above. Treatment with IL-1α and
OSM increased collagenase activity in the medium, and all collagenases were in the active form (since the addition of the
procollagenase activator APMA did not lead to an increase in
activity). The additional presence of TSA at the lowest dose
(50 ng/ml) decreased the level of active collagenase, whereas
total collagenase was unchanged; that is, the percentage of
collagenase that was active was decreased (since the addition
of APMA led to increased activity in the assay, demonstrating
the presence of procollagenases). With increasing dose, TSA
decreased the level of both active and total collagenase; that
is, the total amount of collagenase in the medium was
decreased and the percentage of this enzyme(s) that was activated also decreased. Similar results were obtained using
NaBy (data not shown).
Figure 2b shows a gelatin zymogram of the day-14 medium
cartilage-explant-conditioned medium in the absence or presence of TSA. Unstimulated explants produce a low constitutive level of gelatinolytic activity, which was probably due to
proMMP-2. The addition of IL-1α and OSM induced three
major gelatinolytic activities, which ran as poorly resolved doublets (all activities shown were blocked by metalloproteinase
inhibitors EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, and were therefore
due to the action of metalloproteinases; see Materials and
methods). The largest of these probably equates to bovine
MMP-9 (both pro- and active); there was an induction and activation of MMP-2 and an induction of a lower-molecular-weight
activity that may represent collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-13,
but could include other MMPs, many of which have at least
some activity against gelatin. Both of the collagenases, and

HDAC inhibitors decrease collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity from bovine nasal explants and block collagenase activation. Conditioned media
activation
from cartilage assays (day 14) as in Fig. 1a were assayed (a) for collagenase activity in the presence or absence of 0.67 mM APMA, an activator of
procollagenases (means ± standard errors of the mean), and (b) for gelatinase activity, using gelatin zymography. APMA, aminophenylmercuric acetate; HDAC, histone deacetylase; I/O, a combination of IL-1α and OSM; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; OSM, oncostatin M; TSA, trichostatin A.

particularly MMP-13, have gelatinolytic activity [44,45], and
this would therefore be in agreement with the induction of collagenase activity shown in Fig. 2. TSA at the lowest dose (50
ng/ml) caused a marked reduction in the lowest-molecularweight activity, while increasing doses reduced the activities
of all the gelatinolytic enzymes to background levels.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors modulate MMP gene
expression
Using the SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell line as a model in
which to look at the regulation of metalloproteinase and TIMP
gene expression, we profiled the expression of all MMPs,
ADAMTSs, and TIMPs in cells stimulated with IL-1α and OSM
in the absence or presence of HDAC inhibitors at the doses
used for the cartilage explant experiments above. Figure 3a
shows typical responses for genes induced by IL-1α and
OSM. A number of genes – MMP1, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8,
MMP10, MMP12, MMP13, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS9 –
were robustly induced by the combination of IL-1α and OSM
(though both ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 were expressed only
at low levels in this cell line, with ADAMTS5 showing a weak
induction with IL-1α and OSM). Of these induced genes,
including ADAMTS5, all but ADAMTS4 showed repression by
both TSA and NaBy. ADAMTS4, while strongly induced by IL1α and OSM, was not repressed by either HDAC inhibitor in
this cell line. The expression of a number of genes (MMP2,
MMP9, MMP16, and MMP19; ADAMTS1, ADAMTS2,
ADAMTS7, ADAMTS12, ADAMTS13, and ADAMTS20;
TIMP3) was unaffected by the HDAC inhibitors, whereas the
expression of several genes was induced by HDAC inhibitors

alone (MMP17, MMP23, MMP28; ADAMTS15 and
ADAMTS17; TIMP2). The varying response to HDAC inhibitors across the gene families also affirms that the compounds
are not simply showing a nonspecific toxicity.
In order to verify that the effects of HDAC inhibitors were not
specific to the SW1353 cell line, we undertook a similar experiment on a subset of genes, using primary articular chondrocytes isolated from both knee and hip joint (i.e. from two
different donors). MMP1 and MMP13, the two major specific
collagenases, were strongly induced by IL-1α and OSM, and
this induction was repressed by both TSA (500 ng/ml) and
NaBy (10 mM) (Fig. 3b). MMP8 was expressed at much lower
levels in these cells but followed the same pattern of
responses (data not shown). The IL-1α and OSM induction of
MMP3 gene expression was only poorly repressed by HDAC
inhibitors in the primary chondrocytes (data not shown). In
these cells, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, and ADAMTS9 were all
induced by IL-1α and OSM and the induction was repressed
by HDAC inhibitors (Fig. 3c). These primary chondrocytes,
although grown in monolayer culture, still express type II collagen and aggrecan at the passage at which this experiment
was performed.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors repress MMP protein
expression and activity
In order to ascertain if changes at the level of steady-state
mRNA are mirrored at the protein level, we performed western
blots on the conditioned medium of SW1353 cells at a 24hour time point. Both MMP-1 and MMP-13 proteins were

Histoneexpression and activity repress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
protein expression and activity. Cells were starved of serum for 24
hours before stimulation with I/O, a combination of IL-1α (5 ng/ml) and
oncostatin M (10 ng/ml), for 24 hours in the absence or presence of trichostatin A (TSA) (500 ng/ml) or sodium butyrate (NaBy) (10 mM).
Conditioned media were subjected to western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-(human MMP-1) antibody or a sheep anti-(human MMP-13) antibody or gelatin zymography, as described in Materials and methods.

potently induced by treatment with IL-1α and OSM and this
induction was repressed by both TSA and NaBy in the same
manner as the mRNA (Fig. 4). Two different anti-MMP-1 antibodies (one raised in rabbits [39] and one raised in sheep
[40]) cross-react with a protein of slightly lower Mr than MMP1 in the SW1353-conditioned medium. The identity of this
protein is unknown, but its expression has been previously
documented [40] (though misinterpreted as that of active
MMP-1), it is unaltered by the stimuli used, and it is not present
in conditioned medium from primary chondrocytes (data not
shown).
Gelatin zymography showed some induction of MMP-9, as
well as multiple bands at around the Mr of the collagenases
that are induced by IL-1α/OSM and repressed by the additional presence of HDAC inhibitors in this system.

Discussion
HDAC inhibitors are currently being developed as cancer therapeutics, largely by virtue of their impact upon the cell cycle
and apoptosis [30] in transformed cells. However, it is clear
that such compounds have pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Conceptually, the action of HDAC inhibitors leading to an
increase in histone acetylation should induce expression of
susceptible genes, but in fact, many instances of a repression
of gene expression have been reported [25-29]. In yeast, the
ability of TSA to down-regulate some genes very rapidly
(within 15 min of exposure) suggests that HDACs may function as direct transcriptional activators in some instances [25].
The combination of IL-1 and oncostatin M potently induces
both cartilage aggrecan and collagen degradation in vitro and
in vivo [41,42] and these factors induce the expression of a

number of metalloproteinase genes in chondrocyte cell lines
[46]. The addition of either of two chemically distinct HDAC
inhibitors to cartilage explant cultures blocks IL-1/OSMinduced cartilage catabolism with a decrease in collagenolytic
activity in the conditioned culture medium. TSA and NaBy
themselves do not directly inhibit collagenase activity, and it
therefore seemed likely that they were altering expression of
genes encoding the metalloproteinases or their inhibitors.
Using SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells, which are known to
respond to IL-1/OSM [40], and primary chondrocytes, realtime RT-PCR gene profiling showed that the expression of a
number of MMP and ADAMTS genes was robustly induced by
IL-1/OSM and repressed by HDAC inhibitors. In SW1353
cells, MMP2 is not induced by IL-1/OSM nor altered by HDAC
inhibitors; MMP9 is weakly induced by IL-1/OSM and this
induction is repressed by HDAC inhibitors. In primary
chondrocytes, MMP2 expression is induced approximately
twofold to fourfold by IL-1/OSM, but is not then repressed by
HDAC inhibitors. This is in marked contrast to the zymography
data from cartilage explants and suggests a role for cell–matrix
interactions in mediating the effects of IL-1/OSM on these
gelatinase genes.
Previous studies have shown that TSA represses MMP2
expression in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts but not in human HT1080
fibrosarcoma cells [47,48], showing that the effects of HDAC
inhibitors on MMP expression are specific to cell type and
potentially to species. In primary chondrocytes, the effects of
HDAC inhibitors on the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8,
MMP13) mirrored that seen in the SW1353 cell line; however,
MMP3, though strongly induced by IL-1/OSM in primary
chondrocytes, was not significantly repressed by HDAC inhibitors. The ability of HDAC inhibitors to repress MMP expression at the mRNA level is reiterated at the protein level, as we
have shown for MMP-1 and MMP-13. In primary chondrocytes, the aggrecanases ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, and
ADAMTS9 were also strongly induced by IL-1/OSM and were
repressed by HDAC inhibitors. In SW1353 cells, both
ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 genes are expressed at a very low
level and are therefore difficult to measure; ADAMTS9, however, is expressed robustly, is induced by IL-1/OSM, and is
repressed by HDAC inhibitors, with a pattern similar to that
shown for MMP1 and MMP13 in Fig. 3a. This repression of
aggrecanase gene expression is consistent with the ability of
HDAC inhibitors to inhibit cartilage glycosaminoglycan release
as shown in Fig. 1.
HDAC inhibitors appear to affect not only the expression of
collagenolytic and gelatinolytic MMPs, but also their activation
(Fig. 2). It is known that activation of procollagenases is a key
control point in cartilage resorption and this can be mediated
by cascades within the MMP family (e.g. MMP-3 can activate
procollagenases) or via the action of other enzyme families
(e.g. plasmin, a serine proteinase) [49,50]. Therefore, it is likely
that HDAC inhibitors repress the expression of one or more
R509

Young et al.

key procollagenase activators in cartilage; study of, for
example, plasminogen or plasminogen activator expression
might be informative.
Since almost all metalloproteinase genes that are robustly
induced by IL-1/OSM are then repressed by the further addition of HDAC inhibitors, a likely explanation is the ability of
HDAC inhibitors to interfere with IL-1/OSM signalling. Since
these cytokines are proinflammatory mediators, action via
nuclear factor κB is one possibility; however, the literature
shows that TSA actually potentiates signalling through this
pathway [51,52]. OSM, an IL-6 family cytokine, signals
through the STAT pathway; recent reports show that HDAC
activity plays an essential role in at least STAT1 signalling, and
that TSA can therefore abrogate STAT1-induced gene expression [53,54]. We (TEC and co-workers) have previously
reported that at least STAT3 signalling indirectly mediates the
ability of IL-1/OSM to induce MMP1 gene expression [55].
Dissecting the pathways that mediate the impact of HDAC
inhibitors on induction of metalloproteinase genes by IL-1/
OSM will therefore be one focus of our future work.
Two previous reports using the rodent models of rheumatoid
arthritis (rat adjuvant arthritis and murine autoantibody-mediated arthritis) showed that HDAC inhibitors (TSA, phenylbutyrate, or FK228) block proliferation of cultured synovial
fibroblasts with accompanying up-regulation of cell cycle
inhibitors (p16INK4 and p21Cip1) [31,32]. In vivo, this was mirrored with inhibition of synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation, leading to abrogation of cartilage destruction in the
models. Interestingly, the HDAC inhibitors also repressed
expression of TNF-α and/or IL-1 in synovial tissue. These
reports suggest that HDAC inhibitors may represent a new
class of compounds for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
[31,32]. Anti-inflammatory properties of another HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), have also been
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, via the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 [56,57].
All of these papers suggest a major effect of HDAC inhibitors
in repressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Our
current data show for the first time that HDAC inhibitors can
also function as potent repressors of key metalloproteinase
expression in cartilage and chondrocytes and thus block cartilage breakdown. This suggests they may have wider therapeutic use outside of just the inflammatory arthritides, as
chondroprotective agents. It should be underlined that where
the action of HDAC inhibitors is to repress the induced expression of MMP or ADAMTS genes, this expression is pushed
back to control levels but not to zero. This may be important in
any therapeutic use of HDAC inhibitors, since normal connective tissue turnover may therefore be unimpaired (though it
should also be noted that some MMP and ADAMTS genes are
induced by HDAC inhibitors). Our future work will identify the
HDAC(s) that have an effect on metalloproteinase expression
R510

and identify the mechanism by which this occurs. This has the
potential to allow the design and use of compounds specific
for one HDAC (or a small number of HDACs), which may be
crucial in avoiding toxicity in vivo.

Conclusion
HDAC inhibitors can repress the expression and activity of
matrix-degrading proteinases in chondrocytes and cartilage.
These compounds, in preclinical development as chemotherapeutic agents, also have strong potential as chondroprotective
agents.
