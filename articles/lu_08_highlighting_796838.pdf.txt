Abstract
The Second Symposium on Computations in Bioinformatics and Bioscience (SCBB07) was held in
Iowa City, Iowa, USA, on August 13–15, 2007. This annual event attracted dozens of bioinformatics
professionals and students, who are interested in solving emerging computational problems in
bioscience, from China, Japan, Taiwan and the United States. The Scientific Committee of the
symposium selected 18 peer-reviewed papers for publication in this supplemental issue of BMC
Bioinformatics. These papers cover a broad spectrum of topics in computational biology and
bioinformatics, including DNA, protein and genome sequence analysis, gene expression and
microarray analysis, computational proteomics and protein structure classification, systems biology
and machine learning.

Introduction
Bioinformatics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that
evolves very rapidly, with new research content, such as
translational bioinformatics, constantly being added to
the already long list of topics. The mission of the Symposium of Computations in Bioinformatics and Bioscience
(SCBB) is to provide a regular forum for researchers who
are interested in computations in bioscience and bioinformatics to share their research experience and achievements, discuss various issues pertaining to biological
computation and software development, and strengthen
existing and foster future research collaborations. The first
symposium (SCBB 2006) was held in Hangzhou, China

and 26 peer-reviewed papers were selected for publication
in the BMC Bioinformatics special issue [1].
The Second Symposium on Computational Biology and
Bioinformatics (SCBB07) in conjunction with the International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences 2007 (IMSCCS|07) was held at the
University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA, on August 13–
15, 2007. Besides regular scientific presentations, the symposium had four keynote presentations addressing pressing issues, from high performance computation to
genome annotation. The symposium also hosted a tutorial section on nanotechnology and image processing.

This special issue consists of 18 peer-reviewed papers
authored by research scientists, faculty and graduate students in different disciplines, with diverse backgrounds,
from 30 institutions in four different countries or regions.

ated from p-Edge Contraction and Refinement (p-ECR), a
topological transformation approach [5]. It is concluded
by the authors that this enhanced method can efficiently
improve local topological transforms and result in better
evolutionary trees.

Process of submission and reviews
All manuscripts were electronically submitted through
EasyChair, a conference management system (http://
www.easychair.org/IMSCCS07). Each manuscript was
critically reviewed by at least two referees. The quality of
each paper was evaluated on the significance of its contribution to computational biology and bioinformatics, its
technical novelty and its rigor in methodology. The
selected papers published in this special issue cover a
broad range of topics and can be divided into the following major categories:

Micorarray and gene expression analyses
Microarray analysis as a high-throughput technology has
brought us not only many unprecedented opportunities,
such as monitoring expression profiles of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously, but also many unseen
challenges, such as data processing and analysis, and
molecular pathway discovering. How to find biologically
significant genes and discover co-regulated gene networks
using the methods and exploratory techniques of inferential statistics is still the most compelling topic in this year's
symposium.

DNA, protein and genome analyses
Genome comparison has become an essential means of
determining the function of genes and non-coding
regions of the genome. Yang et al. report their findings on
bidirectional promoters, i.e., the regulatory regions shared
between two consecutive genes, in eight vertebrate model
organisms [2]. Their mapping study shows that many
bidirectional promoters occurred after the divergence of
chicken and fish. This observation is important because it
leads to a sound understanding of bidirectional promoter
evolution.
Identifying DNA-binding proteins is an important step
towards unveiling the complexity of gene regulatory networks. Chang et al. introduce a promising approach that
employs the profiling of evolutionarily conserved residues revealed in DNA-protein contact domains to predict
whether a domain or a protein can be bound to DNA [3].
Their approach was found to be highly sensitive, with the
capability of identifying all positive samples, but did not
lose its high selectivity, with a false positive rate of less
than 5%.
Sequence comparison as a fundamental bioinformatics
operation has many applications such as gene finding and
protein function annotation. Lu et al. proposed an
improved string composition method to quantify evolutionary information in genetic sequences for further
sequence comparison [4]. Using simulated and experimental datasets, they show that their proposed method is
more robust than existing counterparts and comparable in
robustness to alignment-based methods.
Inference of phylogeny is one common task faced by
many biologists. There is no optimal solution, however,
in the construction of phylogenetic trees. Guo et al. propose a new method called p-ECRNJ that uses a neighbor
joining (NJ) algorithm to refine unresolved nodes gener-

Deng et al. propose an Intersection-Union Tests (IUT)
adjustment procedure, called Relaxed IUT, to identify statistically significant genes in treatment versus control samples [6]. Simulation and real case studies highlight the
advantages of this new procedure over traditional IUT. It
is less conservative and more powerful for intersecting
independent tests than the traditional Venn diagram
approach. Zeng et al. introduce a dimension reduction
methodology that combines feature extraction with
redundant gene elimination for tumor classification [7]. A
novel metric of redundancy was proposed by the authors
to eliminate redundant genes before feature extraction
using the discriminative ability of each gene and pairwise
complementarities. The analytical result of two microarray datasets illustrates that this innovative method is more
effective and reliable in dimension reduction.
Clustering is a powerful exploratory technique for the discovery of co-regulated genes and gene networks in microarray data analysis. Wu introduces a genetic weighted kmeans algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm and a
weighted k-means algorithm for large-scale gene expression data clustering analysis [8]. The analytical result of
both synthetic and real gene expression datasets shows
that this improved algorithm is superior to the traditional
k-means algorithm. There are many clustering algorithms
for microarray data analyses; however, it remains an open
question which clustering algorithm is more reliable.
Wilkin and Huang compare the Lloyd's k-means clustering method with the progressive greedy k-means clustering method, using both randomly-generated and
experimental datasets, for running time and distance efficiency [9]. Their study concludes that the Lloyd's k-means
clustering algorithm is more efficient; however, the conclusion may change in different circumstances.

There is growing interest in identifying gene pathways,
i.e., a group of genes interacting with each other to perform certain biological functions, in the study of diseases.
Liang et al. introduce a method based on the concept of
fuzzy set theory to measure the significance of gene pathways in disease [10]. Their experiment, with published
diabetic gene expression datasets, together with a list of
predefined pathways, shows that their approach provides
a feasible solution to the general problem of measuring
the difference between two groups of datasets.
The contents and data models in microarray repositories
are largely heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to perform a database search. Stokes et al. introduce ArrayWiki,
a computer program that resolves the above-mentioned
problem by uniting disparate meta-data regarding microarray meta-experiments [11]. The software contains many
attractive features including a friendly knowledge management interface and a programmable interface, which
can be accessed at http://www.bio-miblab.org/arraywiki.

High performance computing
High-performance computing (HPC) describes integrated
computer systems developed for and capable of performing large amounts of computation quickly. Chin et al.
introduce a computational framework named the Biological Graph Environment (BioGraphE) that connects graph
problems in biology to computational solvers and highperformance systems for graph analysis [12]. It can automatically identify and deploy complex graph algorithms
and integrate those algorithms with powerful and efficient
computational solvers and HPC systems. This platform
brings high-performance software and hardware capabilities to solve challenging graph problems without requiring biologists to know much about specific computing
environments.
Govil et al. describe MLIP, a multiprocessor two-point
genetic linkage analysis system that supports statistical
calculations based on the full parameter space implicit in
the linkage likelihood [13]. Both simulated and real
experimental datasets are analyzed using MLIP and the
results show it significantly speeds up linkage calculations
over a grid space of model parameters. With MLIP, full
multidimensional genome scans can be accomplished
within a reasonable timeframe. Mishima et al. employs a
queuing scheduler built on Grid Engine and runs on a
Rocks Linux cluster for the analysis of statistical genetics
[14]. Their experiment with a large dataset of loci and
families shows that the deployment of exhaustive haplotype analyses using non-parallel software on a Linuxbased system is an effective and efficient approach in
terms of both cost and performance.

Computational proteomics
Tandem mass spectrometry has emerged as a fundamental, high throughput proteomic technique, owing in part
to the successful application of database searching and de
novo sequencing algorithms. Wu et al. describe a novel
method that can be used for assessing the quality of tandem mass spectra for better annotation [15]. In their computational experiment with tandem mass spectra datasets
acquired by ion trap mass spectrometers, this new method
is able to eliminate the majority of poor quality spectra
with a slight loss of high quality spectra. This shows the
outperformance of the proposed method compared to
existing ones. Their method is applicable to assessing the
quality of spectra acquired by virtually any instrument,
not just limited to ion trap mass spectrometers.

Protein structure classification
Protein function is mainly determined by its structure. Gu
et al. introduce a protein structural classification method
that integrates information and probability theories
together with a long-term correlation consideration [16].
A residue occurrence frequency is used instead of physiochemical indices for calculating long-term correlations,
whereas the statistical strategy of residual occurrence frequency is changed from a single sequence to a wholetraining dataset. Both re-substitution and cross-validation
tests show that this new method significantly improves
the accuracy of protein structure classification.

Systems biology
Systems biology is a relatively new field that focuses on
the systematic study of complex interactions in biological
systems. Arikuma et al. propose a new Ontology-Driven
Hypothetic Assertion (OHA) framework that includes
pathway generation, drug interaction detection, simulation model generation, numerical simulation, and hypothetic assertion [17]. Their study results demonstrate that
the OHA framework is a promising approach for in silico
prediction of drug interactions. Many numerical solvers
currently used in systems biology are often ill-conditioned
due to stiffness. Quo and Wang [18] describe new optimal
numerical solvers by systematically comparing qualitative
and quantitative performance metrics. The classic Belousov-Zhabotinskii (BZ) reaction described in the Oregonator model is studied and two general rules are found
for selecting optimal numerical solvers for stiff, complex
oscillatory systems. Their experiment provides insights
into the systematic study of a variety of molecular-level
models of biomedical systems for human disease diagnosis, which will lead to a better understanding and prediction of disease mechanisms and progression in
therapeutic treatments.

Machine learning
The quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR)
modeling of drug molecules enables one to predict molecular activities and thus reduces the cost of traditional
experiments needed for drug design. Li et al. introduce a
strategy called asymmetric bagging to deal with the issue
of unbalanced samples where the number of drug molecules is relatively small [19]. A new algorithm is developed to remove redundant and irrelevant features of drug
molecules for the analysis of asymmetric bagging. Their
computational results with molecular activity data show
that the asymmetric bagging strategy improves sensitivity
values regarding molecular activities and the feature selection algorithm enhances prediction ability pertaining to
molecular activities.
