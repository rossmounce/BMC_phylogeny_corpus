The evolutionary history of the stearoyl-CoA
desaturase gene family in vertebrates

Isabel Cunha1

Background: Stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) are key enzymes involved in de novo monounsaturated fatty acid
synthesis. They catalyze the desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates at the delta-9 position, generating
essential components of phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and wax esters. Despite being crucial for
interpreting SCDs roles across species, the evolutionary history of the SCD gene family in vertebrates has yet to be
elucidated, in particular their isoform diversity, origin and function. This work aims to contribute to this
fundamental effort.
Results: We show here, through comparative genomics and phylogenetics that the SCD gene family underwent
an unexpectedly complex history of duplication and loss events. Paralogy analysis hints that SCD1 and SCD5 genes
emerged as part of the whole genome duplications (2R) that occurred at the stem of the vertebrate lineage. The
SCD1 gene family expanded in rodents with the parallel loss of SCD5 in the Muridae family. The SCD1 gene
expansion is also observed in the Lagomorpha although without the SCD5 loss. In the amphibian Xenopus
tropicalis we find a single SCD1 gene but not SCD5, though this could be due to genome incompleteness. In the
analysed teleost species no SCD5 is found, while the surrounding SCD5-less locus is conserved in comparison to
tetrapods. In addition, the teleost SCD1 gene repertoire expanded to two copies as a result of the teleost specific
genome duplication (3R). Finally, we describe clear orthologues of SCD1 and SCD5 in the chondrichthian,
Scyliorhinus canicula, a representative of the oldest extant jawed vertebrate clade. Expression analysis in S. canicula
shows that whilst SCD1 is ubiquitous, SCD5 is mainly expressed in the brain, a pattern which might indicate an
evolutionary conserved function.
Conclusion: We conclude that the SCD1 and SCD5 genes emerged as part of the 2R genome duplications. We
propose that the evolutionary conserved gene expression between distinct lineages underpins the importance of
SCD activity in the brain (and probably the pancreas), in a yet to be defined role. We argue that an expression
independent of an external stimulus, such as diet induced activity, emerged as a novel function in vertebrate
ancestry allocated to the SCD5 isoform in various tissues (e.g. brain and pancreas), and it was selectively
maintained throughout vertebrate evolution.

Background
Fatty acids are chief components of all living organisms,
participating in various metabolic processes such as
energy storage and as structural elements of biological
membranes. They are the components of a wide variety
of lipids including oils, waxes, phospholipids and others.
Fatty acids occur in saturated and unsaturated forms, a

fundamental feature of their physical properties. Diet
provides a relevant source of fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) de novo synthesis from acylCoA involves a series of elongations followed by a final
desaturation step. Desaturation and elongation alternating steps, are also key physiological processes in the
generation of long chain or very long chain fatty acids
(from the essential a-linolenic and linoleic acids). Desaturases comprise a group of membrane-bound enzymes
able to activate oxygen and use this reagent to modify
C-H bonds at saturated carbons, in diverse substrates

such as alkyl groups, acyl residues in thio-, amide- or
oxygen-ester linkages, carotenoids, sphingolipids aldehydes and sterols [1]. Their classification into delta-9,
delta-6 and delta-5 types reflects the position at which a
double bond is introduced counting from the methyl
end. In the biosynthetic pathway of MUFAs, a critical
committed step is the introduction of the cis- double
bound in the delta-9 position. This process is catalysed
by the steroyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) [2], a rate-limiting
enzyme localised to the endoplasmic reticulum and
composed of four transmembrane domains (Figure 1).
SCDs introduce a double bond at the delta-9 position of
saturated fatty acyl-CoAs such as palmitic and stearic
acyl-CoA, which are converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA and
oleoyl-CoA, respectively (Figure 1). These in turn represent key substrates for the construction of complex lipid
molecules such as phospholipids, triglycerides (TG), wax
esters, cholesterol esters (CE), and alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerols [3]. Over the years, the accumulated data suggests
that SCD expression impacts fatty acid composition of
membrane phospholipids, TG and CE, thus changing
lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, affecting obesity and
membrane fluidity [4]. In fact, fatty acid unsaturation is
of paramount importance for the physical properties of
membrane lipids. In poikilotherms there is a cold
induced increase of membrane lipid unsaturation related
to a compensatory increase in the fluidity and conservation of membrane physical properties and functions
(homeoviscous adaptation). The ratio of oleic and stearic
acid is crucial to the fluidity of membranes and cell-cell
interaction [5].
The regulatory setting governing SCDs is largely
derived from data of the four tandem linked genes in
the mouse. SCD1 is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue (although ubiquitous in the organism) and
has a clear upward trend in high carbohydrate diet fed
animals [6]. A downward expression tendency is

observed during starvation and with polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA) rich diets, with an inhibition of the
liver SCD, which is also observed in humans [7-9]. Significantly, SCD1 knockout mice have an attenuation of
the obese phenotype when on a high fat diet [10]. There
are also some naturally occurring SCD1 deficient mice
strains (asebia mouse), which, amongst other traits have
impaired triglyceride biosynthesis [11]. In fishes, the
impact of dietary lipid contents and temperature has
also been reported [12]. In the common carp, the genome specific duplication has generated two isoforms
expressed in the liver [13]. A decrease in ambient temperature causes a transient upregulation in one isoform,
while dietary fatty acid composition modulates the
expression of a second isoform [14]. Overall, regulation
of SCD gene expression underscores responses to dietary, thermal and hormonal treatment [15].
The delta-9 genes are universally present in living
organisms. Surprisingly, we find remarkable variability
in the gene complement of SCDs in vertebrate species.
The rodent reported gene number varies between four
isoforms (SCD1-SCD4) in Mus musculus (in a 200 kb
span of chromosome 19) and three in Mesocricetus auratus (golden hamster) [16,17], though the absence of
full genome information in the later precludes conclusions regarding the absence of a forth gene. In humans
two genes have been characterised (SCD1 and SCD5),
SCD1 being co-orthologous to the four mice genes [13].
SCD5 was initially thought to be primate exclusive, but
has now been found in other mammals (but not in the
mouse) and birds [18-20]. SCD5 is mostly expressed in
the brain and pancreas, in both mammals and chicken
[20]. Teleost genes are clearly SCD1-type with no report
so far on the presence of SCD5 [13]. On the whole, the
current distribution of SCD genes in the various vertebrate species provides no clear evolutionary scenario for
the origin of SCD1 and SCD5 (and their function). Two

rounds of genome duplication (2R) in vertebrate ancestry have now been firmly demonstrated with the
sequencing of the Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus)
genome [21]. As a consequence, numerous gene families
have specifically expanded up to four copies in the vertebrate lineage. An extra genome duplication in teleosts
(3R) [22] contributed further to gene number increase.
With respect to the SCD gene family, while the two
SCD1 teleost isoforms have clearly resulted from 3R
[13], the duplication origin of SCD1 and SCD5 is
unclear. In fact, whereas SCD1 is present in both Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, SCD5 has only been
reported in Amniotes. Thus, it is uncertain whether
these genes are ancient paralogues, with their origin
coinciding with the appearance of vertebrates; or if they
result from a more recent event of gene duplication in
the Amniote lineage. Phylogenetics, comparative genomics and examination of evolutionarily informative species should clarify these issues.
The integration of the reported gene diversity with the
functional physiological impacts requires the clarification of the SCD evolutionary path. Here, we provide a
clear insight into SCD genes in vertebrate history by
means of comparative genomics, phylogenetics and gene
expression. We determine the timing of the duplication
event which gave rise to SCD1 and SCD5 paralogues
and propose a scenario for the evolution of gene function in the SCD gene family.

Results and Discussion
Human SCD1 and SCD5 map to the NK-linked paralogon

The first human SCD gene to be described, SCD1, localizes to the long arm of chromosome 10. Importantly,
this chromosome region is part of the so-called NK
homeobox gene paralogon [23,24]. Paralogons are
formed by paralogy regions, which in vertebrates largely
comprise of a series of unrelated linked genes on one
chromosome, which have linked paralogues on three
other chromosome regions (or composite regions) due
to the 2R events in early vertebrate evolution. The designation of the NK-linked paralogon results from the
widespread presence of numerous NK homeobox genes
throughout a four composite arrangement, involving
chromosomal segments in human chromosomes 2/8
(Hsa2/8), human chromosome 4 (Hsa4), human chromosome 5 (Hsa5), and human chromosome 10 (Hsa10)
[23,24]. SCD1 maps in the proximity of a NK cluster
gene pair (TLX1/LBX1) at Hsa10 [22]. A second SCD
gene, named SCD5, was recently isolated and characterized in humans [18]. It maps to the q arm of Hsa4, a
location which is also part of the NK gene cluster paralogon, and close to an NK homeobox gene NKX6.1
(~1.9 Mb). Taken together, both sites are highly indicative of a potential involvement of 2R genome

duplications in the origin of these two genes. If correct,
this would imply that SCD1 and SCD5 are old paralogues having emerged in vertebrate ancestry as a consequence of 2R.
We analysed in detail the gene family content in the
immediate proximity of SCD1 and SCD5 genes in the
human genome (Figure 2(A)), to determine their duplication and mapping patterns. We find twelve and nine
open reading frames surrounding SCD1 and SCD5,
respectively, within a 1 Mb interval (Figure 2(A)). Of the
various gene families, the majority are single copies. Of
those which are multi-copy, we find that their duplicate
paralogues typically localize to regions of the genome
included in the NK-linked paralogon (Figure 2(A)). This
is the case for WNT8B (Hsa10), which has a second
member localising to Hsa5 (an expected region of paralogy) [22]. Phylogenetic analysis of this gene family
shows a clear pattern of pre-teleost/tetrapod duplication,
in agreement with 2R (additional file 1). Likewise, in the
mapping region of SCD5 we also find gene families with
duplicated members in expected regions of the NKparalogon. The HNRNPD/HNRPDL pair has a paralogue mapping to Hsa5 at 4 Mb from the NK-like homeobox gene MSX2. However, the most striking case is
represented by the SEC31 gene family, which is composed of two members: SEC31A and SEC31B. SEC31A
maps next to SCD5 in Hsa4, while SEC31B is in close
proximity to SCD1 at Hsa10. The phylogenetic tree also
indicates that, as expected for gene families duplicated
from 2R, 31A and 31B genes have duplicated at least
before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods (additional file 1). Overall, the gene families within the SCD
genomic regions have a duplication history expected
under the 2R genome duplications (additional file 1).
The localization of the human SCD gene isoforms in a
2R-generated paralogon implies two testable predictions.
Unless independent gene expansions have taken place,
invertebrate chordates should have a single SCD gene
equally related to their vertebrate counterparts. Second,
invertebrate SCD genes should be flanked by gene families
that have their human orthologues/paralogues localising
to regions of SCD paralogy (Hsa4, Hsa10, Hsa5 and Hsa2/
8), even if conserved micro-synteny (conservation of
immediately adjacent neighbours) is not observed. To test
these predictions, we have analysed the genomic locus of
the SCD gene in the invertebrate chordate B. floridae.
Although we expected to find a single SCD isoform, our
search retrieved three distinct SCD-like genes. Nevertheless, these represent an independent gene expansion in the
amphioxus lineage (Figure 3), since they group together
outside of the vertebrate SCD1/SCD5 clade (Figure 3). We
name these genes BfSCDa, BfSCDb and BfSCDc. With the
exception of BfSCDc, we find the amphioxus SCD’s
flanked by gene families which have their human

homologues mapping to regions of SCD paralogy (Hsa4,
Hsa10, Hsa5 and Hsa2/8) (Figure 2(B)). For example, close
to BfSCDb a single TET1/3 gene is found with the human
paralogues TET1 and TET3 mapping to chromosomes 10
and 2, respectively (Figure 2(B)). A similar situation is
found close to BfSCDa where a GRID1/2 gene is found.
Human GRID1 and GRID2 localise to Hsa10 and Hsa4 as
expected, under the scenario that these regions represent
an amphioxus-specific partitioning of the 2R unduplicated
genomic locus. Thus, although a conserved proximal synteny is not observed, the amphioxus data clearly supports
the hypothesis that vertebrate SCD1 and SCD5 expanded
in the vertebrate lineage as part of 2R genome
duplications.

Upon its initial characterization, SCD5 was proposed
to be primate specific [18], while SCD1 had a more
widespread presence in vertebrate genomes. However,
the more recent identification of SCD5 orthologues in
bovines [19], and chicken [20] suggested that the original SCD1/SCD5 duplication pre-dated the timing of the
bird/reptile-mammal divergence. Our analysis shows
that the genomic location of SCD1/SCD5 and the phylogenetics of flanking gene families indeed supports an
older age for the duplication event that gave rise to the
SCD1 and SCD5 paralogues. The reported scenario
strongly hints that SCD1 and SCD5 are the remaining
two duplicates of the four that originated from an
ancestral invertebrate SCD gene as a result of 2R.

Alternatively, after 1R, one of the duplicated SCD genes
was lost leaving one remaining for duplication during
2R, producing SCD1 and SCD5.
Gene loss and tandem duplications illustrate the tetrapod
SCD repertoire

The evolutionary setting emerging from the paralogy
analysis creates some important repercussions. For
example, the phylogenetic distribution of both SCD isoforms is potentially broader than previously found. Also,
the absence of SCD genes (either 1 or 5) in vertebrate
classes would mean gene loss and not a different timing
of the SCD1/SCD5 gene duplication.
To elucidate these matters, we started by analysing
tetrapod species using two strategies. Firstly, by determining the duplication timing through phylogenetics,
and secondly by investigating the SCD gene loci in available tetrapod genomes representing various lineages.
The information on gene complement and loci organization was collected from Homo sapiens (Placental Mammal, human), M. musculus (Placental Mammal, Rodent,
mouse), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (Monotremata, platypus), Monodelphis domestica (Marsupial, opossum), Gallus gallus (Bird, chicken), Anolis carolinensis (Reptile,
anole) and X. tropicalis (Amphibian, african clawed
frog). The analysis was expanded to include Oryctolagus
cuniculus (Placental Mammal, Lagomorpha, rabbit)
given the surprising number of SCD1 genes.
The orthology of the designated tetrapod SCD1 and
SCD5 genes was assessed by the phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 3). Although some nodes are poorly supported
in the SCD1 branches, in general we find good statistical
support for the separation of these two gene lineages,
SCD1 and SCD5, in tetrapod species. Within the SCD1
mammalian clade, we find that SCD1-type gene expansion is not restricted to the Muridae family represented
here by M. musculus and Rattus norvegicus (brown rat),
though in the later only three SCD genes are found.
This increase is extended to the entire Rodentia order
for which genome data (partial) is available (not shown).
Another mammalian species, O. cuniculus, was also
found to have an expansion of the SCD1-type
sequences. The common ancestry between rodents and
lagomorphs probably indicates that the expansion of
SCD1 genes took place in the ancestor of both lineages
at 83 mya [25]. However, we find the four rabbit genes
to cluster strongly together and not with the previously
reported M. musculus genes (Figure 3). Though this
could imply two separate duplication events, we find
gene conversion in the rabbit SCD gene cluster a more
plausible alternative. As more SCD sequences become
available in these groups, a detailed analysis should clarify the origin and functional consequences of the
reported phylogenetic pattern.

SCD5 internal nodes are more robustly supported.
Within tetrapods we find no SCD5-like sequence in the
amphibian X. tropicalis. In contrast to mice, Cavia porcellus (guinea pig, Rodent) and O. cuniculus have SCD5
orthologues (Figure 3).
The unsupported position of the amphibian and bird
SCD1 genes raises some questions regarding their
orthology. Thus, we next inspected the loci gene content
as a means to determine a common evolutionary origin.
The SCD1 gene locus is organised in a highly conserved
arrangement (Figure 4(A)). Notwithstanding some gene
order variation, we find PKD2L1 to outflank SCD1 in
most of the analysed species, while WNT8B is typically
downstream of SCD1 (Figure 4(A)). We confirm that
the mouse SCD1 repertoire is expanded to four members organized in tandem in agreement with previous
reports (Figure 4(A)), and similar to what is found in O.
cuniculus (Figure 4(A)).
Next, we examined the SCD5 genomic locus in the
various tetrapod species (Figure 4(B)). In contrast to
SCD1, no evidence of gene tandem expansion was
observed. SCD5 retains a single copy status in a highly
conserved arrangement across species (Figure 4(B)). No
orthologue was found in X. tropicalis or O. anatinus. As
previously noted SCD5 is absent from M. musculus and
R. norvegicus [20]. However, we find SCD5 orthologues
in another Rodentia species (C. porcellus), which indicates that the loss of SCD5 is secondary and probably
restricted to the Muridae family (Figure 3). In O. anatinus and X. tropicalis, no SCD5 was identified. However,
we suspect that the low coverage of the genome
sequence in the case of the platypus is the likely cause
for this absence since we were also unable to find other
neighbouring genes. In the case of X. tropicalis, we find
that the genes typically flanking SCD5 in other tetrapod
species are present but in different scaffolds (Figure 4
(B)). We find the SEC31A gene located at the end of
scaffold_151, a possible indication of a sequence gap in
the genome assembly. To investigate whether a potential
SCD5 sequence was present but not assembled, we
searched the trace sequence genome archives. No
sequence reads with similarity to SCD5 were found.
An alternate hypothesis, which opposes the paralogy
findings, postulates that SCD1/SCD5 isoforms emerged
after the divergence of amphibians in the Amniote
clade. In that case, the amphibian SCD gene should outbranch the mammalian, bird and reptile SCD1/SCD5
genes in phylogenetic trees. However, we find that the
Xenopus gene groups with the described SCD1 genes
(Figure 3), though the bootstrap value is relatively low
(63), when more basal vertebrate lineages are included).
Documenting gene loss is a challenging task in the presence of incomplete genomes. Thus, verifying if SCD5
absence is a true biological reality in a second

amphibian should address both the technical and general implications of this preliminary finding.
Teleosts have lost SCD5 and SCD1a/SCD1b are 3R
paralogues

The SCD gene complement is unexpectedly variable in
tetrapods. Thus, we next inspected various teleost species. These included species with full genomes available
such as Danio rerio (zebrafish), Gasterosteus aculeatus
(three-spined stickleback), Tetraodon nigroviridis (green
spotted puffer), Takifugu rubripes (Japanese pufferfish)
and Oryzias latipes (medaka). Typically, two SCD1
genes have been described in this group [13]. Here, we
use a distinct nomenclature for the fish isoforms,
SCD1a/SCD1b in contrast to SCD1/SCD2, respectively
[13]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that both isoforms are
SCD1 and specifically duplicated in the teleost lineage
with two strongly supported groups: 1a and 1b (Figure
3) [13]. The D. rerio sequences introduced a different
topology, in a pattern previously noted [13], and were
left out of the phylogenetic analysis. However, the synteny analysis clearly supports that the D. rerio genes are
also of the 1a/1b type.
The teleost genome has experienced an extra genome
duplication (3R), to the two rounds that initially
occurred in stem vertebrate evolution [22]. Thus, it has
already been shown that the SCD1a/1b duplicates are
the result of the 3R [13]. The analysis of the regions
harbouring SCD1a/SCD1b in the five species with fully
sequenced genomes confirms this pattern (Figure 4(C))
[13]. We find the gene families in the immediate proximity of SCD1a to have duplicate members in the scaffold or chromosome where SCD1b resides (Figure 4(C)).
For example, DNAJB12b maps a few kb away from
SCD1a, while DNAJB12a is immediately localized downstream of SCD1b (Figure 4(C)).
To demonstrate further that the 1a/1b duplication
resulted from the 3R genome duplication, we decided to
investigate the basal ray-finned fish, Polypterus senegalus
(bichir). This basal Actinopterygii diverged pre-3R [26].
Our degenerate PCR approach isolated a single partial
sequence (711bp). The inclusion of the bichir sequence
in the phylogenetic analysis shows that the P. senegalus
SCD1 outgroups the 1a and 1b teleost genes (bootstrap
72), adding further support to the proposal that indeed
the SCD1a/1b duplication resulted from 3R.
No SCD5 gene sequence has been so far described in
teleosts. Furthermore, in available full genome teleost
sequences no SCD5 annotation is found. To test
whether the absence of SCD5 orthologues was due to
genome incompleteness or absence of gene description,
we examined the location of the tetrapod SCD5-flanking
genes in the available teleost genomes (Figure 4(D)).
The similarity in gene arrangement between the fish

Page 8 of 14

group and SCD5 tetrapod loci is remarkable, and suggests that SCD5 was a targeted deletion in teleosts. We
were unable to confirm if this loss event post or pre
dates 3R, since our attempts to isolate SCD5 from Polypterus were unsuccessful. Thus, it is unclear if the gene
complement in P. senegalus is restricted to SCD1. In
summary, despite the absence of SCD5, we find that teleosts retain an SCD gene complement similar to most
tetrapods due to the specific duplication of SCD1 genes.
SCD1 and SCD5 orthologues are present in the
cartilaginous fish Scyliorhinus canicula

One of the predictions emanating from the paralogy
analysis is that clear SCD1 and SCD5 orthologues
should be found in extant vertebrate classes, unless loss
events have taken place. SCD5 genes were found in reptiles and birds so far, but not in teleosts with strong evidence for gene loss. To determine whether SCD1 and
SCD5 have been preserved in the oldest group of jawed
vertebrates, we searched the emerging genome sequence
of the elephant shark Callorhinchus milii [27]. Also,
using a degenerate PCR strategy we aimed at isolating
orthologues of the SCD gene family from the lesser
spotted dogfish, S. canicula. We found partial sequences
with similarity to either SCD1 or SCD5 in the elephant
shark, but too small to provide solid confirmation (not
shown). In the case of S. canicula, our approach yielded
two distinct sequences with similarity to either SCD1 or
SCD5. Sequence extension was achieved with various
PCR strategies, resulting in two sequences coding for
proteins with 341 and 325 amino acids when finally
isolated.
To provide a clear confirmation, we have examined
the phylogenetic relationships of the S. canicula
sequences (Figure 3). We find that these sequences
group consistently; ScSCD1 with the SCD1 clade (bootstrap 63), and ScSCD5 with SCD5 genes (bootstrap 88).
SCD tissue expression suggests the conservation of an
ancestral function

We next addressed the expression location of newly isolated SCD shark genes, as a proxy for functional appraisal. SCD1 genes are ubiquitously expressed in the
various species analysed so far, with high expression
being observed in the liver and adipose tissue [20]. In
contrast, available data on SCD5 shows that in birds
and mammals, a distinct localised expression is
observed, with emphasis in the brain and the pancreas
[20]. In accordance, we find ScSCD1 expressed at variable levels in all the tested tissues (Figure 5), while
ScSCD5 has a clear expression in the brain, and a minor
expression in the testis and salt secreting rectal gland
(Figure 5). A second site of conserved expression
between birds and mammals is the pancreas. However,

we did not examine the pancreatic expression in S.
canicula.
At the start of this investigation, we found that paralogy studies suggested a much earlier date for SCD1/
SCD5 duplication, probably to the stem of vertebrate
evolution. The finding of clear of SCD1 and SCD5
orthologues in a basal jawed vertebrate confirms this
hypothesis. The overall phylogenetic analysis also provides insight into a more revealing evolutionary pattern
(Figure 6). We note that SCD1 is retained in all lineages
examined, with occasional gene expansion either
through tandem duplications or as a result of genome
duplications. In rodents and lagomorphs tandem duplications have increased the gene number up to three/
four members, while in teleosts the 3R genome duplication is accountable for the presence of two SCD1 genes.

SCD5 has a more scattered phylogenetic distribution. It
has been lost in teleosts and the mammalian Muridae
family, with its absence in X. tropicalis being impossible
to confirm unequivocally at this stage. We conclude that
clear SCD1 and SCD5 orthologues were present in basal
jawed vertebrate, and loss and duplication events took
place during vertebrate evolution (Figure 6).
The parallel expression profile between Amniote
(mammal and bird) and Chondrichthyes SCD orthologues, is a remarkable finding in lineages that have been
separated for more than 350 million years. It supports
some important propositions namely (a) that they represent an ancestraly conserved trait acquired in vertebrates
following 2R (e.g. SCD5 brain expression and SCD1 ubiquitous role) and (b) that a selective force must be operating to maintain the proteins with similar roles in these

distinct lineages. Paradoxically, we find an evolutionary
pattern of clear SCD5 gene loss in at least two groups,
which at face value contradict the relevance of the conserved function of SCD1 and SCD5 (Figure 6). For
example, we find loss of SCD5 in teleosts and some
rodents (Figure 6). This opposes the specific SCD5 localised brain expression as being evolutionarily relevant,
unless particular adaptations have taken place. In support, we find some observations to explain partially this
apparent contradiction. In mice although having lost
SCD5, the SCD1 complement expanded to four genes.
The expression profile of the murine SCD1/2/3/4 genes
shows a compartmented profile: SCD1 is highly
expressed in the liver, SCD4 is exclusively found in the
heart, SCD3 is unique to the skin, and SCD2 is almost
entirely restricted to the brain [16,28]. Thus, having lost
SCD5 and its localized expression in the brain, an
apparent functional recruitment of the murine SCD2
has taken place. As for teleosts a more complex outline
emerges. While no SCD5 orthologue exists, SCD1b was
found to be expressed almost uniquely in the D. rerio
brain (although in a small tissue panel) [13]. This observation also suggests that a selective pressure is present
for the maintenance of a SCD “brain function“ in zebrafish. This is a noteworthy pattern of apparent functional
interchange between 2R and 3R paralogues and echoes
the functional swapping between 2R paralogues [29].
The case of the SCD1 in teleosts mimics that of the
Cdx transcription factor gene family. The Cdx gene
complement is composed of three genes in vertebrate
classes (Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4). However, in teleosts
Cdx2 has been lost, while Cdx1 has duplicated as a
result of 3R [30]. The characterization of Cdx1a/Cdx1b
in zebrafish shows that Cdx1b replaced the role of
mammalian Cdx2 in gut development [31], in a functionally equivalence process.
To infer whether the teleost SCD1a/b expression profile corresponds to a transversal pattern retained in teleost species needs clarification. Currently, with the
exception of zebrafish no other complete dataset involving the expression of both isoforms is available. Thus,
we analysed the 1a/1b profile in the stickleback. Surprisingly, in G. aculeatus, SCD1a and SCD1b are found ubiquitously (additional file 2), in sharp contrast to the
zebrafish. SCD regulation parallels other gene involved
in teleost lipid metabolism. ELOV2, an enzyme essential
for the elongation of LC-PUFAs, is present in freshwater
Ostariophysan species (e.g. D. rerio), while absent in the
Acanthopterygii order (e.g. G. aculeatus) [32]. It has
been proposed that the retention of ELOV2 is related
with the poor-LC-PUFAs in freshwater habitats, when
compared to marine ecosystems which are fuelled with
phytoplankton [32]. In the context of the delta-9 desaturation, a distinct regulation of SCD expression in

Page 10 of 14

zebrafish and stickleback could be related with distinct
availabilities of fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid) in their habitat
or differences in feeding strategies. Also, in the common
carp two SCD1 genes are expressed exclusively in the
liver and subjected to distinct regulation, one of which
is independent of dietary inputs [14]. However, these are
not directly comparable since they are carp genome specific SCD1a duplicates [13]. We note also that in the
grass carp (no genome duplication) SCD1a is expressed
strongly in the liver with vestigial signs in the brain
[33], but so far no orthologue of SCD1b has been
described. Determining the expression of SCD1a and
SCD1b genes in a larger panel of teleost species should
prove clarifying.
Whereas the function and regulation of SCD1 is widely
studied, SCD5’s particular function is largely unknown.
However, in humans, both genes shown similar subcellular
localization [18]. Surprisingly, they also show similar desaturase activities in vitro, both producing oleic acid [18].
Where they differ distinctly is in their expression pattern,
an aspect which we now conclude dates back to the origin
of gnathostomes. The brain SCD5 profile is most suggestive. Oleic acid, one of the outputs of the SCD enzymatic
action, is a relevant component of the brain, in particular
of myelin [34]. Lengi and Corl [19] have put forward that
the maintenance of optimum levels of oleic acid in the
brain might signal the potential role of SCD5. In fact, in
rats the levels and origin of oleic acid in the brain appear
to be independent of the diet [34,35]. In this context and
in contrast to SCD1, SCD5 regulation (and function)
would be independent (or at least less dependent) of low
dietary intake. In agreement, the mouse SCD2 regulation
(a potential functional equivalent of SCD5) is not influenced in the adult irrespective of the dietary intake of
PUFAs [36]. Thus, we propose that a major distinction
between SCD5 and SCD1 would be at the regulatory level,
with SCD5 being unresponsive to external inputs (e.g. food
sources) in its action in the brain (but probably also other
tissues). In this context, the acquisition of this novel setup
would allow the maintenance of optimal oleic acid levels in
brain cell membranes (an aspect fundamental for its activity), irrespective of environmental availability of lipid food
sources. In support, we find that one of the common carp
SCD1 specific duplicates behaves independently of dietary
variation in the response to cold induction [14].
SCD5 has also been shown to be highly expressed in the
pancreas, in birds and mammals [20], a tissue we have not
examined in S. canicula. Elevated levels of saturated fatty
acids have been linked with beta cell death in vitro [37].
SCD activity was recently shown to be involved in a cytoprotective mechanism by transferring saturated fatty acids
into MUFAs which are then incorporated into lipids [38].
The contribution of SCD5 to this role has not yet been
elucidated, as well as its expression pattern under different

Castro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:132
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/132

dietary conditions. To understand if this is also conserved
between the various vertebrate species remains a
challenge.
Overall, two alternate possibilities can explain the phylogenetics and genomics data reported here. Either, an
ancestral SCD gene gave rise to four genes as a result of
2R, with two genes being lost; or after 1R, one SCD
gene was deleted with the remaining SCD duplicating
during 2R. Both proposed scenarios resulted in the
retention of SCD1 and SCD5 in most lineages. We suggest that these genes have diverged functionally, with
SCD5 gaining a distinct regulatory program from that of
SCD1, probably independent of external dietary lipid
inputs.

Conclusion
We find that the duplication which gave origin to the
SCD1/SCD5 paralogues dates back to the 2R genome
duplications. Concomitantly, we find SCD1 and SCD5 in
a basal jawed vertebrate, the cartilaginous fish. We argue
that a regulatory divergence between SCD1 and SCD5,
accounts for their functional differentiation in the aftermath of 2R. Thus, a tissue specific expression (e.g. brain
and probably pancreas) emerged in vertebrate ancestry
allocated to the SCD5 isoform, which has been selectively
kept in most lineages. However, exceptions have survived
the loss of SCD5. A “brain” specific expression is still
retained, albeit through the use of diverse strategies. In
muridae, a SCD1-type gene (SCD2) has fulfilled the function. In the teleost D. rerio, a 3R SCD1 gene also has a
localised expression in the brain. We consider that the
interplay of gene regulatory setups in a selective environment was at play in the SCD evolution, and was probably
involved in the emergence of a SCD gene expression
independent of dietary intakes. Overall, we provide a
clear framework of the evolutionary history of SCD genes
in vertebrates that should prove instrumental for the
functional analysis that may follow.
Methods
Sample collection and storage

Adult three-spined stickleback G. aculeatus were
obtained from the Minho River (North of Portugal) by
weir fishing. Adult bichir, P. senegalus, were obtained
through a local aquarium fish supplier. These freshwater
species were kept separately in the lab in dechlorinated
tap water within 100 l recirculation systems at appropriate temperature (17°C and 25°C, respectively) and on
natural photoperiod. Fish were fed artificial flake or pellet food daily. Adult lesser spotted dogfish, S.canicula,
were collected by bottom trawling off the northern Portuguese coast. Fish were held in 2000 l seawater tanks
in a recirculation system with temperature control (16°
C). They were fed mackerel until satiety twice a week.

Synteny and Paralogy examination

We located the human orthologues of SCD1 (Hsa4) and
SCD5 (Hsa10) using the Ensembl genome database
release GRCh37. To deduce whether the genomic surroundings of both genes had signs of duplication, attributable to the 2R genome duplications (i.e. part of a
paralogon), the gene content in a 1 Mb Ensembl interval
was analysed. Gene families with more members mapping to distinct regions were identified. Their phylogeny
was determined to infer the duplication pattern. Amino
acid sequences were collected from Ensembl and JGI.
Gaps and regions of uncertain homology were discarded.
The phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining from the MEGA4 package [39]. Confidence
on each node was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Synteny data for the examined species was retrieved
from the following Ensembl database releases: H. sapiens
GRCh37, M. musculus NCBIM37, M. domestica
BROADO5, O. anatinus OANA5, G. gallus WASHUC2,
A. carolinensis AnoCar1.0, O. cuniculus oryCun2, X. tropicalis JGI4.1, G. aculeatus BROADS1, T. nigroviridis
TETRAODON8, T. rubripes FUGU4, D. rerio Zv9, and
O. latipes MEDAKA1. Mapping information of B. floridae SCD’s was retrieved from GenBank. We analysed
the two immediate ORF’s flanking each SCD gene.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis

SCD1 and SCD5 sequences of S. canicula were aligned
with those from a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrate species using CLUSTALW in Bioedit. To maximise the number of included species we considered the
use of incomplete sequences (e.g. P. senegalus). Phylogenetic reconstruction used annotated sequences retrieved
from GenBank and Ensembl databases. The accession
numbers are given in legend of figure 3. Gaps and
regions of uncertain homology were removed to obtain
a final alignment of 183 amino acids of 56 sequences.
We applied Protest [40] to determine the best model of
amino acid substitution (LG+I+G). A Maximum Likelihood tree was constructed with PHYML [41]. The
robustness of the tree was assessed through 100 bootstrap replicates of the data. Visualisation was performed
in TreeView [42].
SCD1 and SCD5 isolation in S. canicula and P. senegalus
and gene expression

Total RNA was isolated from the collected tissues (e.g.
brain) using the Illustra RNAspin minikit from GE
Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK) with on-column DNase
I treatment. The RNA integrity was verified in a 1%
agarose gel stained with Gelred (VWR). RNA concentration was measured with a Qubit fluorometer platform
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). Conversion of total RNA into
first strand cDNA was performed using the iScript

cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer recommendations (Bio-Rad). To isolate of SCD1and SCD5 from S.
canicula and P. senegalus we designed degenerate primers with the CODEHOP program [43] (table 1). Various PCR protocols were followed using the Phusion
Flash hot start high fidelity polymerase mix with the
manufactures recommended conditions (Finnzyme Helsinki FI). Bands of the appropriate size were isolated
from the agarose gel (GFX cleaning kit, GE Healthcare),
and sequenced directly with one of the flanking primers
(Stabvida). Positive sequences were used to design race
primers in S. canicula with the Primer3 program (v.
0.4.0; [44]). Race cDNA and PCR was prepared according to the SMARTer RACE cDNA kit instructions
(Clontech Mountain View CA). Bands were sequenced
directly with race primers. Full ORF integrity was determined with flanking primers (table 1). Sequences were
deposited in Genbank: ScSCD1: [JF729408], ScSCD5:
[JF729409], and PsSCD1: [JF729410].
Gene expression was verified through RT-PCR with
specific primers, which were tentatively designed to outflank conserved introns (Table 1). Briefly, total RNA
from the various tissue samples was converted into

ORF PCR

cDNA as described above. The same concentration
input per sample was used. One microliter of cDNA
was used in a PCR reaction with the following cycle
conditions: 94°C 30 sec, 55°C 30 sec, 72°C 30 sec for 30
cycles (to avoid the PCR plateau). Samples were run on
a 2% agarose gel, stained with Gelred, and digitized
images acquired for analysis (LAS4000mini, FujiFilm,
Tokyo, Japan). Actin was used to normalize gene
expression [45].
