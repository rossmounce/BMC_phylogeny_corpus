Abstract
Background: The P-loop NTPases constitute one of the largest groups of globular protein
domains that play highly diverse functional roles in most of the organisms. Even with the availability
of nearly 300 different Hidden Markov Models representing the P-loop NTPase superfamily, not
many P-loop NTPases are known in Plasmodium falciparum. A number of characteristic attributes
of the genome have resulted into the lack of knowledge about this functionally diverse, but
important class of proteins.
Method: In the study, protein sequences with characteristic motifs of NTPase domain (Walker A
and Walker B) are computationally extracted from the P. falciparum database. A detailed secondary
structure analysis, functional classification, phylogenetic and orthology studies of the NTPase
domain of repertoire of 97 P. falciparum P-loop NTPases is carried out.
Results: Based upon distinct sequence features and secondary structure profile of the P-loop
domain of obtained sequences, a cladistic classification is also conceded: nucleotide kinases and
GTPases, ABC and SMC family, SF1/2 helicases, AAA+ and AAA protein families. Attempts are
made to identify any ortholog(s) for each of these proteins in other Plasmodium sp. as well as its
vertebrate host, Homo sapiens. A number of P. falciparum P-loop NTPases that have no homologue
in the host, as well as those annotated as hypothetical proteins and lack any characteristic functional
domain are identified.
Conclusion: The study suggests a strong correlation between sequence and secondary structure
profile of P-loop domains and functional roles of these proteins and thus provides an opportunity
to speculate the role of many hypothetical proteins. The study provides a methodical framework
for the characterization of biologically diverse NTPases in the P. falciparum genome.
The efforts made in the analysis are first of its kind; and the results augment to explore the
functional role of many of these proteins from the parasite that could provide leads to identify novel
drug targets against malaria.

Background
Despite encouraging advances in vaccine development,
malaria remains the most serious and widespread parasitic disease of humans. Each year, approximately 300–
500 million people become infected with malaria and two
to three million die as a result [1]. The availability of the
complete genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the
causative agent of fatal cerebral malaria, has opened new
avenues to identify genes important for the parasite's survival. This information can be utilized for the development of effective drugs or vaccines against the parasite.
Unfortunately, nearly 60% of the P. falciparum genome
(5411 proteins) has been designated as hypothetical proteins as they lack sequence similarity to any protein
known to date [2]. This large and unexplored group of
hypothetical proteins may contain proteins that play an
important role in physiological pathways specific to the
malaria parasite. The functional interruption of such proteins/pathways without deleterious consequences to the
host should be the one of the primary tasks in data mining. A pipeline of systematic studies is thus required to
elucidate the functional relevance of such proteins in the
parasite's survival.
A number of these hypothetical proteins (unknown protein function) in P. falciparum genome contain a P-loop
NTPase domain. Briefly, the P-loop NTPases constitute a
large super-family of proteins [3] and are involved in disparate physiological processes. For example, processes
include translation, transcription, replication and DNA
repair, intracellular trafficking, membrane transport and
activation of various metabolites [3-5]. The P-loop
NTPases carry out such diverse cellular functions by
hydrolyzing the α-β phosphate bond of a bound nucleotide triphosphate i.e. ATP or GTP [6].
Based on amino acid sequence, the P-loop NTPase fold is
characterized by the presence of a N-terminal Walker A
motif, represented by a flexible loop joining a β-strand
and an α-helix. The loop typically adopts the sequence
pattern GxxGxGK [ST], whose function is to properly position the triphosphate moiety of a bound nucleotide. The
distal Walker B motif (hhhhDE) contains a conserved
aspartate (less commonly glutamate residue). The motif is
situated terminally in a β-strand and binds a waterbridged Mg2+ ion [5,7]. On structural aspects, the P-loop
NTPases are α-β proteins that contain regularly recurring
α-β units with the five β-strands (β1–β5). The β-strands
forms a central core arranged in the order β(5-1-4-3-2) or
β(5-1-3-4-2), surrounded by α-helices on both sides [8,9].
The P-loop NTPases can be divided into two groups: one
group includes the nucleotide kinases and the GTPases
where the β-strand leading to the P-loop and the Walker B
strand are direct neighbors. The second group includes
AAA, ABC, SF1/2 helicases and RecA/F1 ATPases and is

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/69

characterized by an additional β-strand inserted between
the P-loop strand and the Walker B strand [10-12].
Despite these basic common sequence and structural features, the P-loop NTPases exhibit extreme sequence divergence. The huge sequence diversity had so far hampered a
clear understanding of the phylogenetic relationships
within these P-loop proteins. The entire complement of
the P-loop NTPases of an organism varies considerably in
sequence and the functional aspects. Therefore, identification and phylogenetic classification of the P-loop NTPases
of an organism may provide insights into distinct physiological processes involving these proteins. Since the
malaria parasite resides inside the host cells during most
part of its life cycle, some of these processes such as trafficking of proteins and translocation of metabolites might
be unique to the parasite and involve P-loop NTPases. In
the present study, a comprehensive survey of the P-loop
NTPases in P. falciparum is carried out by analyzing the
sequence and structural features of the NTPase domain of
functionally diverse proteins. Further, based on these
identified features, a few of these hypothetical proteins are
classified. For robustness of the analysis, the traditional
cladistic and phylogenetic tree approaches (based on
sequence and structural motifs of P-loop NTPases) are
also combined. The study underlines the evolutionary
information in addition to other sequence-structure features and thus, to develop a systematic classification of the
P-loop NTPases in the P. falciparum. The study has also
facilitated identification of some of the parasite specific P
loop-NTPases as putative novel drug targets against the
parasite.

Methods
Retrieval of sequences with classical Walker A and Walker
B motifs
An initial computational search of the complete P. falciparum genome for the Superfamily: P-loop NTPase
(SSF52540) revealed 302 proteins; 67 out of which are
annotated as hypothetical proteins. In addition, to extract
the proteins with classical Walker A and Walker B motifs
and their variants, the motif search tool of PlasmoDB
release 4.4 http://v4-4.plasmodb.org/restricted/plasmod
bmotif.shtml is used. These two motifs are represented by
GxxGxGK [TS] and hhhhDE patterns, respectively where
'x' is any of the 20 amino acids and 'h' is any hydrophobic
residue. It led to the inclusion of those proteins which
have been annotated as P-loop NTPases by PlasmoDB and
Pfam databases. From this analysis, an initial set of 120 Ploop NTPase sequences containing both Walker motifs is
obtained. Further, for each of these proteins; the sequence
regions corresponding to the P-loop domain only (comprising both Walker regions) are extracted. Variation in
the sequence length (171 to 8094 amino acids) and
Walker A and Walker B motifs is observed for most of
these proteins. The unavailability of crystal structures of

most of these proteins is a major hindrance in the structure based multiple alignments and their systematic analysis; hence only 97 proteins in which the P-loop domain
encompasses a length of 300 to 400 residues are studied,
to facilitate in sequence based multiple alignments (Additional file 1). The refined dataset is then used for secondary structure and phylogenetic analyses, followed by
classification and orthology studies. Apart from above
analysis, the protein sequences are also screened using signalP 3.0, TMHMM v2.0 and TMpred tools to predict signal and transmembrane domains. The absolute
expression profiles of these proteins that are temperature
synchronized are also obtained from PlasmoDB.
Functional classification using Pfam v21.0
Since the P-loop NTPases are known to belong to functionally diverse groups therefore a domain analysis of
dataset of 97 P. falciparum P-loop proteins is performed
for functional classification of these proteins using Pfam
v21.0 database of domains. The proteins are functionally
correlated based on the domains present with E-values
with a threshold of 10-2.
Secondary structure analysis of proteins
To perform secondary structure analysis of the P-loop
domain of the dataset of 97 proteins, a representative
dataset of 533 seed protein sequences is generated pertaining to Pfam accession ID: PF00004, PF07724,
PF07726, PF04326 and PF07728. The secondary structure
is predicted by the standalone version of PSIPRED v2.0,
which is a simple and reliable method, incorporating two
feed-forward neural networks that perform an analysis on
output obtained from the initial run of PSI-BLAST at the
cut-off E-value of 0.001 (Blast v2.2.4) [13]. PSIPRED predicts the secondary structure for each residue and provides
a confidence score for three types of secondary structures:
helix, sheet and coil. The sequences are aligned according
to the secondary structure for AAA+ proteins to classify
them into classical AAA or AAA+ and other super-families
based on the structural conformations and domain organizations. Multiple alignments are obtained using CLUSTALW (1.83) [14-16], which are manually refined to
reflect the available structural information.
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic relationships amongst various classes of
proteins are determined using the Phylip 3.67 package
[17]. PROTDIST is used on the 97 sequences to calculate
a distance matrix according to the Dayhoff PAM probability model [18]. The computed distances represent the
expected fraction of amino acid substitutions between
each pair of sequences. The distance matrix is then used to
estimate phylogenies using the neighbour joining (NJ)
method. Bootstrapping is carried out using SEQBOOT
(1,000 replicates for the PAM model of substitution).
CONSENSE is used to compute the consensus tree by the

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/69

majority rule method. The final unrooted tree diagram is
generated
using
TreeView
http://taxonomy.zool
ogy.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.
Identification of orthologous protein sequences using
OrthoMCL
To identify the possible drug targets in terms of orthology
of proteins between P. falciparum and its human host and
with other Apicomplexans, OrthoMCL algorithm is used
[19], which performs the Markov Clustering (MCL) to
group orthologs and paralogs across proteins of multiple
organisms. The stand-alone version 1.3 of OrthoMCL is
obtained
from
http://www.orthomcl.org/cgi-bin/
OrthoMclWeb.cgi. Protein FASTA files of each of the
genome is given as input to the algorithm. An all-againstall BLASTP analysis (at E value of 10-5) is carried out using
OrthoMCL. The blast output, which describes genes
paired by BLAST matches, the E-value, and the identity
percentage and the related HSP information, is parsed to
OrthoMCL. The evolutionary related proteins are interlinked in a similarity graph matrix. MCL http://
micans.org/mcl/ is then invoked to split mega-clusters as
an analogous process of manual review in COG construction (Clusters of Orthologous Groups). As a result, different clusters of orthologous proteins are created.

Results and discussion
Sequences with P-loop motifs: Generation of dataset
Using consensus sequences of Walker A (GxxGxGK [ST]),
Walker B (hhhhDE) motifs and their variants along with
other proteins annotated as P-loop NTPases (PlasmoDB),
a dataset of 97 P. falciparum protein sequences is generated. These proteins showed variations in the length of the
P-loop NTPase domains having insertions and repeat
regions between Walker A and Walker B motifs. In addition, some of the proteins showed variations in the P-loop
motifs compared to canonical forms, suggesting their
divergence from other P-loop NTPases. These sequences
are further analysed for protein domain organization, secondary structure and phylogenetic and orthologous relationships. A list of all the 97 proteins and their
characteristics is provided in Additional file 2.
Functional classification based on domains and secondary
structural analysis
Analysis of the secondary structures of the P-loop NTPase
domain and presence of the Pfam domains served as the
basis for functional classification of these proteins. Typically, the functional groups have been defined based
upon the presence of Pfam domains and the hierarchical
classification of individual proteins is carried out on the
basis of structural analysis of P-loop domains in these
proteins using PSIPRED (Figure 1) [20,21]. Based upon
these studies; the repertoire of P. falciparum P-loop
NTPases is classified into clades, families and subfamilies
(Additional file 2).

Leipe et al., 2002; 2003). The families marked in red are not observed in Plasmodium falciparum. The clades that together
form the Pre-sensor-1 β hairpin superclade are highlighted in blue.

Kinase GTPases
In this class two myosin binding proteins of molecular
motors, PFL1435c (myosin d) and PF13_0233 (myosin a)
are identified. Unlike other myosins, PFL1435c contains
long asparagine repeats between the Walker A and Walker
B motifs. The orthologs of PF13_0233 protein are also
found to be present in other Plasmodium species as well as
in a closely related apicomplexan organism (Toxoplasma
gondii); suggesting its evolutionary conservation. Four
other kinases are also identified (MAL13P1.148,
PF11_0416, PFE0175c and PFF0675c), that showed
major variation in the P-loop domain organization; the Ploop domain of these proteins lack a classical Walker B
motif. Although a total of 99 protein kinases have been
identified in P. falciparum genome [22], only PF13_0334
is found to contain the classical P-loop NTPase fold.

The P. falciparum GTPases that have been classified within
P-loop NTPases include PF11_0183, a nuclear binding
protein and two transcription initiation and elongation
factors, PFA0595c and PF13_0069. Based upon Pfam
domain analysis along with their secondary structures, the
two hypothetical proteins (PFF0810c and PF14_0052) are
also classified as Kinase GTPases.
ASCE/RecA fold division
ABC transporters and SMC family
ABC transporters are part of a large ATP binding protein
family that plays physiological function of translocation

of metabolites across the membranes. In P. falciparum, 15
ABC transporters are identified that contain core β-strands
and helices along with sensor-1 residue, which intercalates between the P-loop and aspartate residue of the
Walker B motif. The characteristic signature 'LSGG' of ABC
proteins, located upstream of the Walker B motif is found
in only five P. falciparum ATPases while a hydrophobic
residue substitution primarily at the first position of the
motif is noticed in a majority of remaining proteins (Figure 2). Based upon these sequence features and secondary
structure analysis these 15 ABC transporters are phylogeneticaly assigned into subfamilies following [23]. Out of
these 15 ABC proteins, three are full transporter [with two
transmembrane domain (TMD) and two nucleotide binding domain (NBD)] PFC0875w, PFE1150w and
PF14_0455; and eight are identified as half transporters
(with one TMD and one NBD) PF13_0218, PF13_0271,
PFL0495c,
PFA0590w,
PF11_0466,
PFL1410c,
PF14_0133 and PF14_0244; whereas four other ABC proteins are found to lack the transmembrane domain. Based
on these observations, PF13_0218, PF13_0271,
PFL0495c, PF14_0455 and PFE1150w have been assigned
to the ABCB subfamily, which is known to include multidrug resistant proteins (MDR/TAP). These P-glycoprotein
(PgP) homologues of the P. falciparum are found to be
similar to the mammalian MDR proteins and have been
implicated in providing parasite resistance against antimetabolites [24]. ABC transporters have also been implicated to export proteins (responsible for host modificaPage 4 of 20

tion, virulence and immune responses) in the host via
alternative pathways [25]. The PF11_0466 protein
belonging to ABCB subfamily, is an ABC transporter,
expressed in late trophozoite stages [26] and contains a
hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence. The N-terminal
signal sequence is known to be responsible for default
trafficking of a parasite protein through endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi apparatus pathway to the parasitophorous vacuole in absence of any organelle targeting signals.
It is not clear if PF11_0466 protein is localized to mitochondria or apicoplast; in absence of targeting to any of
these organelles it may localize in the plasma membrane
or parasitophorous vacuolar membrane and might have
novel function(s) in protein trafficking. Two other P. falciparum ABC tarns porters, PFA0590w and PFL1410c are
suggested to be involved in redox metabolism and might
have functional activities of MRP (MDR associated protein) and/or GSSG pumps [27]. These characteristics suggested that these proteins may be classified under the
ABCC subfamily. The mammalian MRPs belonging to the
ABCC family are associated with extrusion of oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) generated during glutathione synthesis, a major element of antioxidant defense for the parasite
[28]. Interestingly, the protein PFL1410c showed no
homology with any of the known human MRPs and
hence can be studied as a potential drug target.
PF14_0244 is assigned to the ABCG subfamily a reverse
transporter with N-terminal NBD and C-terminal TMD.
Further, the proteins without transmembrane region have
been classified under the ABCF subfamily; members of
this family are not known to be involved in any membrane transport functions [23].
Along with the ABC transporters, SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) proteins also represent a large
family of ATPases involved in chromosome organization
like the sister-chromatid cohesion and DNA repair [27].
Apart from high sequence similarity, SMCs also share
structural similarity with ABC proteins (Figure 3). Five P.
falciparum proteins are annotated as putative SMC proteins (PlasmoDB). The P. falciparum SMC proteins are
found to be highly conserved amongst Plasmodium species
which suggests that they may play an important role as a
component of chromosomal maintenance complex and
are probably indispensable for the parasite. Although ABC
transporter proteins are functionally different from the
SMC proteins, Figure 2 clearly illustrates that the N-terminal region of proteins belonging to these two groups is significantly conserved near the Walker-A motif, extended by
two small conserved regions having charged residues (Lys,
Arg, Glu) flanked by hydrophobic (Leu, Ile, Ala) or polar
residues (Ser, Asn, Gln). Based on secondary structure
analysis, three SMC proteins (PFD0685c, MAL13P1.96
and PF11_0317) clustered together as compared to
PFF0285c; probably due to two long stretches of continu-

ous helical regions in the PFF0285c protein. Evolutionary
studies that the ATP binding domain of proteins belonging to the same ABC subfamily are more closely related to
each other than to those belonging to other subfamilies,
suggesting their concerted evolution whereas SMC proteins clustered together away from ABC families and have
evolved further from these subfamilies (Figure 3).
Unfoldases
The unfoldase division of ASCE/RecA fold proteins is
characterized by the core P-loop containing Walker A and
B motifs, and the presence of arginine finger at the N-terminus of β5 (Figure 4). The division includes SF1/SF2 helicases, F- and V- type ATPases/Rho and AAA+ superfamily
of proteins.
SF1/SF2 Helicases
Helicases are enzymes that unwind duplex DNA or RNA
coupled to nucleoside 5' triphosphate (NTP) binding and
hydrolysis [29]. Structural and sequence comparison of
these proteins from different organisms have identified
seven to nine short, conserved motifs called helicase signature motifs [30]. Most of the known 3'-5' DNA helicases
are members of SF1 or SF2. These two superfamilies have
similar sets of conserved motifs that are responsible for
coupling of ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation and
unwinding. However, sequence homology across SF1 and
SF2 families is very weak and limited to the signature
sequences, required for NTP binding (Walker A and B
motifs) [31]. ATP hydrolysis by SF1 helicases is stimulated
only by ssDNA, whereas the ATPase activity of SF2 helicases is stimulated by both ssDNA and dsDNA [32]. In the
present study, seven P-loop NTPases in the P. falciparum
genome are found to contain helicase, HA2 and DEAD/
DEAH domain(s), characteristic of DNA/RNA helicases.
The secondary structures of these helicases are dominated
by helices towards the N-terminal, followed by regions
having alternate α-helices and β-sheets. Multiple
sequence alignments revealed that although the DEAH
box helicases had high sequence conservation throughout
the P-loop domain, PF08_0042 and PFC0440c had an 'I'
→ 'A' replacement in the DEAH box (Figure 4). In addition to some hydrophobic residue conservations among
sequences, a sequence pattern 'I [LI]DE [AVIL] is found to
be highly conserved. Downstream to the observed pattern, a Ser/Thr residue is found to be well-conserved
amongst all the P. falciparum helicases.
AAA+ superfamily
The proteins belonging to AAA+ superfamily are highly
diverse and are involved in varied cellular functions [33],
but have a common AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse
cellular Activities) structural fold [9]. The AAA+ domain
contains a characteristic region of high sequence conservation called as the second region of homology (SRH) that

distinguishes AAA+ proteins from other P-loop NTPases.
The SRH includes a polar residue at its N-terminal known
as 'sensor 1' and an 'arginine finger' at the C-terminal helical domain that carries a conserved arginine residue
known as 'sensor 2' [34] (Figure 5). The AAA+ superfamily
include classical AAA proteins as well as proteins having
divergent sequences but classical AAA structural fold. The
AAA+ superfamily has been divided into several different
clades. The P. falciparum AAA+ proteins have been
grouped based upon their sequence and structural features and discussed according to their respective functional clades.
Clamp loader/RFC clade
The clamp loader ATPases have a synapomorphic 'SRC'
signature associated with the arginine finger [35]. In the
preset study, five P. falciparum RFC (replication factor C)
proteins are identified following the Walker A and B consensus analysis. Three of these proteins (PF14_0601,

PFL2005w and PFB0840w) share high sequence similarities as compared to other two (PFA0545c and PFB0895c).
Further, the sequence analysis revealed that the sensor-2 is
conserved among all the five RFC proteins while the SRH
is conserved in only three proteins (PF14_0601,
PFL2005w and PFB0840w). The structural analysis
revealed one hypothetical protein (PF14_0326) having
secondary structure similar to that of known RFC proteins. This protein showed a single residue substitution in
the Walker B motif; 'W' residue replacing A in the {AVIL}
pattern (Figure 4). In order to analyse the correlation
between the secondary structure of the P-loop domain
and functional role of a protein, the helicases and the RFC
proteins are studied together. The sequence pattern 'I
[LI]DE [AVIL], that is observed for helicases, is also found
to be conserved in the RFC proteins. The evolutionary
analysis of the helicases along with the replication factor
C (RFC) proteins revealed that helicases proteins have a
tendency to cluster. The only exception is MAL13P1.14

protein, which falls out of the cluster probably due to
extended sequence length in the N-terminal of its P-loop
NTPase domain. Three RFC proteins are observed to
group closer with the helicases as compared to the other
RFC proteins (Figure 6). These results indicate that helicases and RFC proteins might have undergone a convergent evolution since majority of the helicases are found to
be similar both at the sequence as well as in the structural
organization of the P-loop domain with the RFC proteins.
DnaA/CDC6/ORC clade
This clade is defined by the presence of two α-helices after
strand 2 (of approximately equal size) that are packed
against each other [35]. The only representative of this
family is PFL0150w. The N-terminus of the protein had
rich low complexity regions and the ATPase domain had

secondary structure similar to that of other AAA+ proteins
(Figure 6).
ClpA/B ATPase clade
Members of the ClpA/B ATPases family contain two AAA+
domains that vary from each other in terms of sequence
and phylogenetic affinities. The ClpB ATPases contain a
middle domain (M domain) between the two ATPase
domains as compared to ClpA. The ClpB ATPases play
role of important chaperones whereas ClpA ATPases interact with Clp proteases to carry out regulated protein degradation [36]. Two P. falciparum proteins (PF14_0063 and
PF11_0175) have been annotated as ClpA/B ATPases by
PlasmoDB. However, PF14_0063 is found to contain substitution in some of the functionally conserved residues
including R → E substitution in the arginine finger and R

studies nested these plasmodial ClpA/B homologs within
the ClpA/B proteases of bacterial lineage suggesting that
they have been acquired from the prokaryotic precursors
(Additional file 3). The AAA domain of the P. falciparum

downstream of strand 2 except the conserved glycine at

of AAA module of parasite ClpA/B homologs clustered
them separately from rest of the AAA proteins (Figure 8).
Importantly, the absence of any human ClpA/B homologue renders the Plasmodium ClpA/B ATPases as important drug targets.
"Pre-sensor-1 β hairpin" (PS1BH) superclade
The remaining lineages of AAA+ namely HslU/ClpX/Lon,
MCM, dynein/midasin and other relatives have been unified into a one large monophyletic group. The entire
superclade is defined by the presence of an insert between
the sensor-1 strand and the preceding helix known as
"pre-sensor-1 β hairpin" [35]. In this superclade, two distinct clades are identified, which are further divided into
three protein families in the parasite genome.

domains). The ATPase domain of HslU is interrupted by
an 'I' domain involved in the substrate binding [37,38].
This clade is supported by an extended loop between
strand-2 and helix-2. The HslU (ClpY) and ClpX ATPase
interact with the protease partner HslV (ClpQ) and ClpA
respectively to form multimeric protease degradation
complex machineries as in case of ClpAP. Although ClpX
ortholog is absent in P. falciparum, the ortholog of HslU
(PFI0355c) annotated as ATP-dependent heat shock protein is identified. HslU orthologs are known in apicomplexans and kinetoplastids are predicted to be localized in
the mitochondria or plastid [39]. Sequence and structural
analysis of PfHsIU confirmed the presence of three characteristic domains of HslU proteins, N-terminal domain
(N-domain), Intermediate domain (I domain) and C-terminal domain (C-domain) [40]. The HslU ortholog is an
ATP binding regulatory subunit of prokaryotic proteasome complex with HslV/ClpQ threonine proteases. The
ortholog of the prokaryotic HslV protease in the malaria
parasite has been recently identified and is shown to be
functionally important in the parasite [41]. Both HslU
and HslV lack any homolog in the vertebrate host and
may be considered as a promising drug targets against the
parasite. The Lon proteins from archea and bacteria define
another family (LON family) within this clade. The
PF14_0147 protein is identified as a P. falciparum Lon protease that contains the characteristic LAN domain and a
Lon-protease domain flanking the AAA domain at the Nand C-termini, respectively.

HslU/ClpX/lon clade
The HslU/ClpX clade proteins contain one ATPase
domain as compared to ClpA (with two ATPase

Helix-2 insert clade
As the name suggests, the defining feature of the clade is
an insert in helix-2 that folds into two β-strands [35]. In

the P. falciparum genome, the helix-2 insert clade is represented by Mini Chromosomal Maintenance proteins
(MCMs) and dyneins, whereas other members of the
clade such as NtrC, YifB and MoxR are not found in the
parasite genome.
MCM family
The MCM proteins are essential DNA replication initiation factors and the best characterized among them is a
family of six structurally related proteins (MCM2–7) [42].
In the P. falciparum database three proteins (PF14_0177,
PFD0790c and PFL0560c) have been annotated as MCMs
belonging to the MCM2/3/5 family (PlasmoDB). Five
other members of the MCM family (PF07_0023,
PF13_0095, PF13_0291, PFE1345c and PFL0580w) that
have certain minor deviations from the canonical form of
P-loop motifs like Gxx [G/x]x [G/A]KS sequence of the
Walker A motif are observed. The secondary structure
analysis of the AAA region of all these MCM proteins
revealed the classical helices and strand pattern. An invariably conserved sequence motif 'GLT' (for the observed
pattern of ' [AG] [FL]T' in other organisms) in helix-2

region before the beta-alpha-beta insert is observed. The
beta insert in the helix-2 of MCM family members of the
malaria parasite is predominantly rich in hydrophobic
residues except highly conserved charged residues of '
[KR]D' and 'LE', 5th and 14th positions, respectively,
downstream of the GLT motif (Figure 9).
Dynein family
Dyneins are large molecular motor that transport various
cellular cargo by "walking" along cytoskeletal microtubules towards the minus-end of the microtubule, which is
usually oriented towards the cell center. Thus, they are
called "minus-end directed motors". They contain six tandem AAA+ domains in the same polypeptide chain [9,43].
The parasite genome contains seven representatives (average length of ~ 6000 amino acids) from this family out of
which only four proteins (PF14_0626, MAL7P1.162,
PF10_0224 and PF11_0240) are annotated at PlasmoDB.
Three other proteins PFI0260c, PFL0115w and
MAL7P1.89 annotated as hypothetical proteins at PlasmoDB, are identified as dyneins based upon the protein
domain analysis. These proteins have two dynein heavy

and DHC N-2 except in MAL7P1.89 and PF11_0240,
which only have the DHC N-2 domain. The PFI0260c
protein is also found to contain spectrin-like repeats.
AAA clade
Proteins belonging to the classical AAA clade contain
highly conserved P-loop NTPase domain including SRH.
The characteristic feature of the clade is the presence of an
additional short helix immediately downstream of strand
2 in the P-loop domain [35]. The AAA clade consists of all
ATPases that originally are defined as the members of the
AAA superfamily [44]. The P. falciparum AAA proteins
have been classified under following categories: metalloproteases, proteasomal subunits and 'D1 and D2' proteins. A conserved glycine residue at the N-terminal of the
arginine finger is observed in all the members of this clade
(Figure 7). Three P. falciparum proteins are identified as
metalloproteases (pan-bacterial protein family) belonging to the M41 family of peptidases and proteases [45,46].
PFL1925w has been annotated as cell-division protein
FtsH whereas PF11_0203 and PF14_0616 have been

annotated as hypothetical proteins (PlasmoDB). The
domain analysis of these proteins showed that these
hypothetical proteins contain a single AAA (Pfam domain
id-PF00004) domain fused to the metalloprotease
domain (Pfam domain id-PF01434) as in case of other
FtsH proteins. Moreover, in all the three metalloproteases,
a functional motif 'abXHEbbHbc' where 'a' is most often
alanine or serine (instead of valine or threonine residues
observed in metalloproteases of other organisms), 'b' is an
uncharged residue (tyrosine or alanine here) and 'c' is a
hydrophobic residue (leucine or isoleucine here) is
observed. Thus both, domain and sequence-structure
analysis, suggested that the two hypothetical proteins
with characteristic features of the family may be functionally equivalent to FtsH metalloprotease. Upon performing
the phylogenetic analysis based on their secondary structures, these three proteins tend to cluster together.
The 26S proteasomes complex is a component of the regulated protein degradation machinery in eukaryotic cell.
The 19S regulatory component of the 26S proteasome

(Rpt1–6) [47,48]. These proteasomal ATPases contain
tandem repeat of AAA module and are conserved throughout the archeao-eukaryotic branch [49,50]. In the P. falciparum genome database, five proteins (PFD0665c,
PF10_0081, PF11_0314, PF13_0033 and PF13_0063)
have already been identified as Rpt homologues. Another
protein PFL2345c, which is annotated as the tat-binding
protein homolog, has also been found to be the part of
this complex based on its sequence similarity and structural patterns. Secondary structure analysis shows that all
six the proteins have classical helical and β-strand pattern
(Figure 7). The 'D1 and D2' is another family that contains proteins with two AAA domains named as D1 and
D2. This family includes N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
fusion protein (NSF), ATPase family gene (AFG) and Cell
Division Cycle 48 (CDC48) proteins [51,52]. The NSF
proteins play an important role in vesicle mediated protein trafficking in which the D1 AAA cassette is the active
ATPase while D2 is nucleotide binding [47,48]. The only
NSF homologue identified in the malaria parasite is
PFC0140c that contains the N-domain (essential for soluble NSF-attachment protein binding). The ATPase CDC48
family has two representatives in the P. falciparum
genome, PF07_0047 and PFF0940c. An additional protein (MAL8P1.92) is observed, having similar sequence
features and structural as that of known CDC48 proteins.
It shows a significant sequence similarity of MAL8P1.92
with known CDC48 proteins along with the conserved
secondary structural features such as the presence of an
additional helix downstream of strand-2 in the ATPase
domain. Phylogenetic analysis clustered proteins of proteasomal complex in a tight cluster close to another cluster
of FtsH proteins (Figure 8).
RuvB/TIP49 clade
The TIP49 ATPases associate with the TATA-binding proteins and appear to play a critical role in the assembly of
complexes related to transcriptional activation [53]. Three
proteins (PF11_0071, PF08_0100 and PF13_0330) have
already been annotated as RuvB DNA helicases in the P.
falciparum genome. However, presence of certain key features such as conserved 'pre-sensor-1 β hairpin' which is
the characteristic of RuvB DNA helicases is not observed
in these three proteins. Instead, the N-terminal module
with H [ST]H motif, a characteristic of TIP49 family
[35,54] is found in these proteins. Furthermore, the multiple sequence alignment based secondary structure analysis showed presence of an additional small helix
downstream of strand 2, as in the case of classical AAA
clade proteins (Figure 10). These observations suggest that
these three proteins should be annotated as TIP49 proteins in the classical AAA clade instead of RuvB DNA helicases.

MutS proteins/DNA mismatch repair proteins
The precise cladistic classification of this group of proteins
is not known due to the lack of any unique/peculiar feature(s) pertaining to this group of proteins. In the P. falciparum genome database, three proteins (MAL7P1.206,
PF14_0254 and PFE0270c) have been annotated as DNA
mismatch repair proteins. The characteristic motifs
(Walker A, STF, Walker B and STH) for this class of proteins are found to be well conserved in all the three proteins. A hypothetical protein PF14_0051 is also found to
contain similar domain as other MutS proteins but
showed sequence variations all along the length of P-loop
domain, including considerable substitution of 'T' → 'L' in
the STF motif (Figure 11). Phylogenetic classification
based on the secondary structure of the P-loop domains of
these proteins grouped them within the cluster of five
ABC transporter proteins (Figure 12) and thus together
these can be classified under the ABC/SMC superfamily.
AAA domain sequence and secondary structure based
functional classification of hypothetical proteins
The phylogenetic analyses of all the 97 P. falciparum Ploop NTPases based upon the secondary structure as well
as sequence features of their AAA domain led to an interesting observation. The functional distribution of all 97
proteins is shown as a percentage of total number of proteins for each of the clade studied (Figure 13). Proteins
with similar functional roles (or which are parts of larger
functional complexes) are found to be grouped together
in the analysis. This is remarkably observed for FtsH,
ClpA/B and dynein ATPases families. A number of hypothetical proteins with characteristic functional domains
are also found to strongly cluster with the annotated proteins of respective families. For example, the two hypothetical proteins having FtsH domains (PF11_0203 and
PF14_0616) clustered with the annotated FtsH protein
when subjected to both sequence and secondary structure
based analyses (Figure 12). A similar result is found for
the hypothetical protein PFI0260c, having dynein heavy
chain domain, which clusters with four other dynein proteins (Figure 12). These results suggest a correlation
between the sequence and structure conservation of the Ploop domain and the functional role of these proteins.
Thus it can be speculated that proteins involved in similar
functions may group together due to conservation of
structural and sequence patterns of their NTPase domains
and thus may be suggestive of their putative role. A
number of hypothetical proteins that contain only AAA
domain are also found to group within clusters of proteins
having a defined functional role (Figure 12). These results
suggest that the AAA domain sequence and secondary
structure homology based phylogenetic grouping may
help to infer possible functional role of these AAA pro-

teins and may be used as a complementary method in the
annotation process.
Absence of sequence similarity with any other known proteins is a major hurdle in functional classification of large
number of P. falciparum hypothetical proteins. Martin
[55] used hydropathy plots to identify novel membrane
transporters from these hypothetical proteins of P. falciparum. The possible functional roles for few of P. falciparum hypothetical proteins are predicted based upon
their grouping with other functionally annotated P-loop

proteins in the phylogenetic analysis. The PF14_0126 protein is found to cluster with two functionally annotated
RFC proteins and PFD0935c is observed to fall within the
cluster of three MCM proteins and thus these proteins
might have functional roles as RFC and MCM proteins
respectively. Similarly PFF0810c and PF10_0099 are
observed to cluster with SMC proteins, MAL13P1.13 with
ABC transporters and PF14_0052 with ran/tc4 family proteins, suggesting their possible functional roles as SMC,
ABC transporters and ran/tc4 proteins respectively. These
hypothetical proteins have shown significant similarities

at both the sequence and secondary structural levels.
Thus, this approach may be extended to other organisms
to classify and assign putative functions to many hypothetical proteins.
Identification of orthologous protein sequences using
OrthoMCL
Firstly, 1,580 different orthologous groups are found
between P. falciparum and Homo sapiens, consisting of
1,683 different proteins from the parasite. Interestingly,
37 P. falciparum P-loop NTPases have no ortholog in H.
sapiens. These proteins include helicases, ABC transporters, Clp protease and heat shock protein. Out of these 37
proteins, 17 are annotated as hypothetical proteins.
Together, this analysis offers opportunities to explore the
potential of these proteins as novel drug targets without
affecting the host.

The OrthoMCL analysis amongst six Plasmodium sp.
namely P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, P.
yoelii and P. knowlesi, identified 88 different P. falciparum

P-loop NTPase proteins that have at least one ortholog in
another malaria parasite species. The remaining nine
NTPase proteins of P. falciparum are the proteins, which
are unique to P. falciparum genome. These proteins
include ABC transporter, 26S proteasome subunit Rpt3
and DNA replication licensing factor MCM2 in addition
to hypothetical proteins. These proteins might be responsible for some dedicated pathways in the life-cycle of the
parasite and thus can be of immense interest for further
research that may provide clues to a number of unanswered questions in the parasite biology.
Since, there are few characteristic similarities among P. falciparum and plants; an attempt is made to identify orthologous of P. falciparum P-loop NTPase proteins in
Arabidopsis thaliana a model organism to compare. A total
of 57 parasite NTPase proteins have ortholog in A. thaliana genome. Four of these proteins are predicted to be
targeted to the apicoplast of the P. falciparum. These are
cell division cycle ATPase (PF07_0047), heat shock protein
(PF11_0175),
ATP-dependent
transporter

(PF14_0133) and a hypothetical protein (PF08_0063).
Out of these four proteins, the ATP-dependent transporter
protein has no human ortholog. The expression profile of
this protein shows the peak expression at late-trophozoite
and early schizont stages of the life-cycle. Together, this
protein may be considered as a promising drug target.
The orthologous search is further extended to prokaryotes
(Synechococcus sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia
coli and Staphylococcus aureus) where only 10 P. falciparum
P-loop NTPases are observed to have orthologs in at least
one of these prokaryotes. These 10 NTPases from the parasite showed sequence or structural similarity with bacterial ATPases such as multidrug resistance protein; heat
shock protein and cell division protein FtsH protein
(present in all eubacterial species). It strongly suggests
that few unique processes of the parasite are governed by
prokaryotic type mechanisms such as drug-resistance, cellcycle or protein folding involving heat shock proteins.
Some of these prokaryote like-parasite proteins may play
crucial role in the parasite life cycle and can be studied as
novel drug targets.
Concluding remarks
P-loop NTPases comprise one of the largest protein families with members present in all kingdoms of life. Numerous subgroups of the family are involved in diverse
cellular functions. The functional roles of a number of

families belonging to P-loop NTPases superfamily are still
unknown in eukaryotes. The repertoire of the P-loop
NTPase has not been identified and classified in P. falciparum. The challenge of studying and classifying these
NTPases further increases in P. falciparum due to low
sequence similarity and unique features of the genome
such as extended insertions and repeats. In the present
study, a systematic classification of the P-loop NTPases in
P. falciparum genome is carried out, that provided information on their function, classification, phylogenetic and
orthologous relationships amongst various protein families and organisms. Variations in critical residues within
the conserved regions as well as long insertions are
observed in the P-loop NTPase domain for most of the P.
falciparum NTPases suggesting that the parasite has
evolved constantly to sustain inspite of the mutations/variations in these imperative regions. The study provided an
understanding of the P-loop NTPases, especially in terms
of their structural and functional relationships. The proteins with similar functional roles are observed to have
similar sequence and structure pattern of P-loop domain.
Based on this, putative functional roles for 14 hypothetical proteins are predicted. This is one of the key findings
of the study pertaining to the fact that most of P. falciparum proteins are not homologous to any other eukaryotic protein and have been annotated as hypothetical
proteins. Therefore, elucidation of putative roles of these
proteins that are unique to the parasite may provide leads

to identify novel drug targets. The sequence orthology
based studies are found to be useful in identifying P-loop
NTPases either similar to prokaryotic origin or restricted
to Plasmodium species. Such P-loop NTPases involved in
important physiological pathways may lead to identification of new drug targets. It must be emphasized that the
current study demonstrates the possible achievements of
a computational analysis and is a preliminary investigation. Experimental evidence to explore the role of these
genes is thus required. It becomes mandatory in the case
of P. falciparum where new functional roles have been predicted for a significant number of hypothetical proteins
inspite of very low levels of sequence similarity. Overall
the study provides us new leads in investigating the functions and biology of P. falciparum P-loop NTPases.
