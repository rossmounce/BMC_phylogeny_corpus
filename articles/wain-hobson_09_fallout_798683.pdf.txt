Humans are unique in encoding eleven APOBEC cytidine
deaminases that edit single stranded DNA (ssDNA). So far
no other species encodes so many. To be exact, prime face
evidence has been found for 8, the remaining 3 proving to
be recalcitrant. Single stranded DNA is synonymous with
replication and transcription and might suggest a role in
epigenetic modification. The most widely known member
goes by a different name, AID, and is responsible for class
switch recombination and somatic hypermutation of rearranged immunoglobulin V region loci. Retroviral cDNA is
of course, single stranded and an anti-viral activity possible. In fact the lentiviruses and one of their precursors
were so vulnerable to some of the APOBEC3 enzymes that
they evolved the vif gene more than 10 M years ago to
effectively take them out. By contrast, HTLV-1 and other
retroviruses seem not to be bothered. By contrast several
human APOBEC3 genes do act as major restriction factors
for hepatitis B virus in vivo. Some of the APOBEC3 genes
are upregulated by interferon-α, which goes a long with
an anti-viral role for certain APOBEC3 members. Finally
some of the human genes at least, may also restrict some
other human viruses in vivo presumably during replication and/or transcription. Indeed, a rather eclectic ensemble.

Massive retroviral hypermutation can be used as a surrogate marker for elevated expression of these deaminases in
vivo. Given that three laws of thermodynamics shows that
no machine is perfect, is it possible that over-expression of
some of these cytidine deaminases results in a breakdown
of the proper stoichiometry associated with APOBEC3
complexes allowing excess enzyme to turn against cellular
DNA? In short, can they help push cells down the road to
cancer? This is a particularly exciting idea, given that the
exploding field of cancer genomics is showing that not
only are there far more mutations in a cancer cell than
hitherto thought (>103), but also the most frequent mutation is precisely the C->T transition. The presentation will
address all aspects of the above.

The role of these deaminases in controlling the replication
of retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)
doesn't fit well with their phylogeny and gene copy
number. For example, the mouse genome encodes only
one APOBEC3 gene while humans have seven. The avian
and reptile lineages are full of ERVs yet they do not encode
any APOBEC3 gene. Similarly, there are no such genes in
plant genomes, despite a plethora of retroviruses.
