Abstract
Background: Patterns of mtDNA variation within a species reflect long-term population
structure, but may also be influenced by maternally inherited endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia.
These bacteria often alter host reproductive biology and can drive particular mtDNA haplotypes
through populations. We investigated the impacts of Wolbachia infection and geography on mtDNA
variation in the diamondback moth, a major global pest whose geographic distribution reflects both
natural processes and transport via human agricultural activities.
Results: The mtDNA phylogeny of 95 individuals sampled from 10 countries on four continents
revealed two major clades. One contained only Wolbachia-infected individuals from Malaysia and
Kenya, while the other contained only uninfected individuals, from all countries including Malaysia
and Kenya. Within the uninfected group was a further clade containing all individuals from
Australasia and displaying very limited sequence variation. In contrast, a biparental nuclear gene
phylogeny did not have infected and uninfected clades, supporting the notion that maternallyinherited Wolbachia are responsible for the mtDNA pattern. Only about 5% (15/306) of our global
sample of individuals was infected with the plutWB1 isolate and even within infected local
populations, many insects were uninfected. Comparisons of infected and uninfected isofemale lines
revealed that plutWB1 is associated with sex ratio distortion. Uninfected lines have a 1:1 sex ratio,
while infected ones show a 2:1 female bias.
Conclusion: The main correlate of mtDNA variation in P. xylostella is presence or absence of the
plutWB1 infection. This is associated with substantial sex ratio distortion and the underlying
mechanisms deserve further study. In contrast, geographic origin is a poor predictor of moth
mtDNA sequences, reflecting human activity in moving the insects around the globe. The exception
is a clade of Australasian individuals, which may reflect a bottleneck during their recent introduction
to this region.

Background
Patterns of within-species variation in animal mtDNA are
influenced by various factors, including mutation, selection, demography and geography, and analysis of haplo-

type diversity patterns can provide information on
population structure and gene flow. In addition, mtDNA
sequences are often used to investigate the evolutionary
history of a species, by combining geographic and phyloPage 1 of 10

genetic information in phylogeographic studies [1]. However, theory predicts that mtDNA variation and evolution
may also be influenced substantially by endosymbionts
that are maternally co-inherited with the mitochondria
[2]. In insects, maternally-inherited intracellular Wolbachia bacteria are of particular concern, because they
have been detected in hundreds of species [3] and are estimated to infect about 2/3 of all insect species [4]. Wolbachia cause various modifications of host reproductive
biology, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis, feminisation and male-killing [5,6]. In
addition, a single infection can be responsible for causing
more than one phenotype, e.g. CI and male-killing [7].
Wolbachia enhance their own spread through the host
population by means of these phenotypes and, in so
doing, drive the associated host mitochondrial haplotypes
to high frequencies, causing dramatic changes in host
mtDNA patterns [8]. Consequently, analysis of variation
in insect mtDNA should take account of possible endosymbiont effects whilst attempting to uncover and explain
patterns in terms of host ecology [2,8].
Here, we explore the role of Wolbachia bacteria in explaining patterns of mtDNA variation in the diamondback
moth (Plutella xylostella), a global pest of Brassica plants
(cabbages and relatives). A previous study [9] reported the
occurrence of two different Wolbachia isolates in two different P. xylostella individuals during a general screening
of diverse insects for Wolbachia infections; however, there
have been no wider studies of the occurrence of these isolates in P. xylostella or of their effects on host phenotypes
and genetic variation. Consequently, we screened individuals from four continents for Wolbachia infections and
then investigated the correlation between infection with
the dominant isolate (plutWB1) and mtDNA variation.
We also sequenced a biparentally inherited nuclear gene
marker, whose phylogeny should reflect demography and
geography, but not any Wolbachia-associated driving of
cytoplasmic factors. In addition, we conducted experiments to test whether plutWB1 produces a phenotypic
effect on the host that is likely to drive the infection, and
its associated mtDNA haplotype, through local populations.
The diamondback moth is amongst the most globally distributed of all Lepidoptera [10]. It is generally thought to
be endemic to the Mediterranean region [11], although an
African origin has also been suggested [12]. Its current global distribution is due to two processes – natural migrations and man-made introductions. Direct observations
using vertical-looking radar have confirmed that long distance migration from continental Europe is the source of
populations in the UK in late spring [13]. Meanwhile,
transport to many disparate locations across the globe is
likely to be the result of accidental introductions during

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/49

vegetable shipments [14]. Consequently, we predict an
unusually weak correlation between geographic and
genetic (mtDNA) divergence in P. xylostella because recent
human activity has moved moths between continents.
In summary, we screened P. xylostella samples from four
continents in order to: (1) determine the global diversity
and prevalence of Wolbachia infections, (2) test whether
Wolbachia infections were associated with particular
mtDNA haplotypes, (3) test whether plutWB1 produces a
drive phenotype, 4) test for a breakdown of the usual
strong link between geographic continent of origin and
mtDNA sequence variation, and 5) compare mtDNA
results with those from a nuclear marker that should not
have its phylogeny shaped by cytoplasmic drive mechanisms.

Results
Global screening for Wolbachia in P. xylostella
In order to explore the prevalence and diversity of Wolbachia, we screened 306 individuals from 10 countries on
four continents (Table 1) and isolated three Wolbachia isolates, termed plutWA1, plutWA2 and plutWB1 (Figure 1).
The first two isolates were extremely rare and found in
only two individuals each, while plutWB1 was found in
about 5% (15/306) of the global sample of individuals
(Table 1). We detected Wolbachia only in individuals from
Malaysia, Kenya and Germany. However, even in these
countries, most individuals were uninfected (Table 1).
Moth mtDNA phylogeny
We obtained mtDNA sequences for 92 P. xylostella individuals and three members of the closely related outgroup
species Plutella porrectalla (Table 1). The mtDNA fragment
analysed consisted of 637 bp of the CO1 gene. There were
72 variable nucleotide sites, of which 55 were informative
for maximum parsimony (MP) analyses. This variation

yielded 22 discrete haplotypes (Figure 2), of which 11
where unique to one individual.
MP and neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenies were very
similar and revealed a deep split (2.5% sequence divergence) between all individuals infected with plutWB1 and
all those that were not (Figure 2). In contrast, the largest
pairwise distance between any two uninfected individuals
was only 1.75%. We sequenced 21 individuals from
Kenya and Malaysia that were infected with plutWB1. They
all had very similar COI sequences, with maximum pairwise divergence of only 0.314%, forming haplotypes 1–3
and a well-supported monophyletic clade (Figure 2). This
supports a single origin of the infection and we further
tested for an association between mtDNA haplotypes and
plutWB1 by randomising the infection status of individuals across the tips of the phylogeny and calculating the
minimum number of changes in infection status implied
(see [15], for a similar application). All of the 100 randomisations implied more than the one change observed

in the actual data set, providing significant support (P <
0.01) for the association between infection status and
haplotype that is apparent by eye. In contrast to the clear
pattern found with this isolate, the two A clade Wolbachia
isolates were each found in only two individuals, precluding further useful analysis.
In general, individuals do not cluster on the phylogeny
according to their geographic origin. However, all individuals from Australia (Haplotypes 7, 8 and 13) and New
Zealand (Haplotype 7), along with one from Malaysia
(Haplotype 7) form a well-supported monophyletic clade
(Figure 2). Australasia was the best sampled region, with
individuals from 14 sites spanning most of Australia, as
well as two sites in New Zealand.

from 0.0013 to 0.091. The highest nucleotide diversity
was found in Asia, followed by Africa; importantly, these
are the two regions that harboured the plutWB1 infection
and its associated divergent haplotypes. Australasia

showed the lowest haplotype diversity and nucleotide
diversity, despite field sampling from 14 sites across Australia and two in New Zealand. This is reflected further by
comparisons with data from Hawaii (Table 2). Hawaii,
like Australasia, is isolated by sea from other continents
and was probably only colonised relatively recently by P.
xylostella due to human travel. Only four individuals from
Hawaii were sampled, but these had higher haplotype
diversity than the Australasian individuals and values similar to those in Europe. All infected groups have lower
haplotype number, and haplotype and nucleotide diversity, than their respective uninfected groups (Table 2).
Moth nuclear DNA
We also analysed approximately 200 bp of the L27a
nuclear ribosomal protein gene for the same 92 P. xylostella individuals. We obtained 74 different sequences
(Genbank accession numbers EU833259–833333), 65 of
which were unique to one individual. However, there was
low sequence divergence and the vast majority of pairs of
individuals differed by only 1–4 nucleotide substitutions.
Further, many substitutions were unique and therefore
not phylogenetically informative. Nevertheless, two
clades can be defined by the presence/absence of a 9 bp
indel event. Clade A contained 74 individuals from all five

continents, while clade B contained 20 individuals from
Europe, Asia and Africa (Figure 3). In contrast to the case
for mtDNA, there were not separate infected and uninfected clades. A mixture of infected and uninfected individuals occurred in each clade. All individuals from
Australasia were in clade A, indicating that Australasian
populations have reduced nuclear diversity compared to
most other countries (present in both clades), as suggested by Endersby [14], based on microsatellite markers.
Sequence variation in the Wolbachia wsp gene
The plutWB1 isolate found in our study shows high
sequence divergence (17.3–17.5%) from the B-clade Wolbachia isolate (wXyl-B1) previously identified infecting P.
xylostella [9] (Figure 1). However, it has the same wsp
sequence (0–0.2% sequence divergence) as an isolate
found infecting the African butterfly, Acraea pentapolis
[16].
Phenotypic effects of Wolbachia
We found a female biased sex ratio of approximately 0.62
(proportion females) in field P. xylostella populations in
the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia (Table 3). The sex ratio
was only significantly different from 1:1 for the site with
the largest sample (or using pooled data from all sites).
However, the sex ratio was actually remarkably consistent
(0.60–0.63) between the four sites surveyed in this region
(Table 3).

We successfully established two infected and three uninfected isofemale lines from field-caught Malaysian P.
xylostella individuals and maintained them in the laboratory for nine generations (see methods). The two infected
lines had female biased mean sex ratios (0.68, 0.66, Table
4) that were similar but slightly more biased than those
observed in the field populations (see above) and these
did not change significantly over nine generations of laboratory culture (F = 3.634, d.f. = 2, P > 0.05). In contrast,
the uninfected lines had unbiased sex ratios (0.5, 0.54,
0.52) (Table 4). The plutWB1 infection appears to be a sex
ratio distorter that increases the proportion of female
hosts, as infected lines have significantly higher proportions of females than uninfected lines (t = 8.82, d.f. = 3, P
< 0.01).
The proportion of infected individuals in infected lines
decreased over the nine generations (F = 63.66, d.f. = 2, P
< 0.05), suggesting that vertical transmission of Wolbachia
is not perfect. This was also found when both sexes were
tested separately (Males: F = 26.15, d.f. = 2, P < 0.05 and
Females: F = 496.19, d.f. = 2, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the sexes, with a mean of 68%
of males and 74% of females infected (t = 1.4, d.f. = 17, P
> 0.05).

Wolbachia have driven this haplotype group to a significant if low frequency in infected populations. Our study
further suggests that this infection is a sex ratio distorter
and this phenotypic effect upon the host is likely to have
driven the infection and associated haplotype group into
the wider population. In contrast, there is little correlation
between mtDNA haplotype and geographic origin.
Infected and uninfected individuals from the same site in
Malaysia (or Kenya) fall into the two different clades
rather than group together.

Discussion
Wolbachia infections in P. xylostella
We detected three different Wolbachia isolates in Plutella
xylostella. The two A-clade isolates were very rare, each
occurring in only two individual moths. The B-clade isolate plutWB1 was more common, but, where present in
Malaysia and Kenya occurred at low frequencies of about
10%. It is therefore likely that further screening in some of
the other countries will also reveal plutWB1 (see Jiggins et
al. 2001 for a discussion of sampling effort and Wolbachia
detection). Interestingly, plutWB1 differs considerably in
wsp sequence from a previously reported B-clade infection
(wXylB1) of P. xylostella in the USA [9]. It thus appears that
P. xylostella has acquired different Wolbachia infections in
different parts of its now global distribution. None of
these infections appears common or widespread and
some may be transient.

Interestingly, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, another major
crop pest with an essentially global distribution, has also
been found to harbour a number of different Wolbachia
infections [17]. The plutWB1 infection in P. xylostella is
present in at least two continents and these insects probably stem from a single ancestral infection event, since their
mtDNA haplotypes are very similar and form a well-supported and differentiated monophyletic group within the
P. xylostella COI phylogeny (Figure 2). There is a small
amount of variation in both the COI sequences of infected
individuals (Figure 2) and the wsp sequences of their
infections (Figure 1), reflecting a small amount of evolution since the original infection event.
Phylogenies, infection and geography
The host COI phylogeny has two major clades that correlate perfectly with presence or absence of the plutWB1
infection. The association between the very similar haplotypes 1–3 and plutWB1 infection supports the idea that

In contrast, there is little tendency for individuals from the
same country or even continent to cluster together in the
mtDNA phylogeny (Figure 2). However, the lack of this
pattern is consistent with recent and repeated movements
of insects between continents due to trade in cruciferous
crops. It is interesting that Australasia stands out as an
exception to the general pattern. We sampled many Australian populations and two from New Zealand and all
individuals belong to a single clade with very little
mtDNA variation. This suggests that Australian and NZ
populations probably stem from a single colonisation
event from Asia around 120 years ago [18] that was then
transferred from Australia to NZ or vice versa. The very
low mtDNA diversity could reflect a small initial founder
population from SE Asia. Low variation in the L27a gene
(this study) and low microsatellite diversity [14] in Australian individuals further support this idea and suggest
success of stringent quarantine procedures in modern
times [14].
Finally, we note that selection for resistance to pesticides
and biocontrol agents [19,20] may also influence P. xylostella genetic variation. However, this would most likely
influence both mtDNA and nuclear DNA, while our main
result is a clear association of a sex-ratio distorting infection with patterns of mtDNA variation.
Sex ratio distortion
Our data show that the plutWB1 infection is associated with
substantial sex ratio distortion, so that females outnumber
males about two to one in infected lines. The fact that infection frequency was the same in males and females in our
experiments argues against it being a male-killer. However,
such a low infection frequency would be surprising for a
feminizing bacterium, but is not unusual for a male-killer
and host resistance to male-killing can evolve, as in the but-

terfly Hypolimnas bolina [21]. Male-killing alone cannot
explain the sex ratio bias in our infected lab lines and feminisation of genetic males is an interesting possibility for
future study. It is also possible that a more complicated scenario could apply and that Wolbachia is not, or not the
only, agent of sex ratio bias [22]. Our evidence for the role
of Wolbachia is currently only correlational, which is an
important but not definitive line of evidence [22]. Recent
work has revealed that other less common, but still widespread [23] insect endosymbionts can cause similar hosts
effects to Wolbachia [23,24]. Furthermore, detailed analysis
of a case involving Ostrinia moths, initially thought to
involve a feminising Wolbachia isolate, has revealed complex fitness interactions between sex chromosomes and
infection status leading to differential mortality by sex [25].

Conclusion
Global patterns of mtDNA variation in the diamondback
moth are shaped largely by the presence or absence of the
plutWB1 Wolbachia infection. This occurs patchily at low
frequencies and apparently distorts host sex ratios to a 2:1
bias in favour of females. The cause and mode of sex ratio
distortion deserves further study. In contrast to infection
status, the geographic origin of a given individual is a poor
predictor of its mtDNA haplotype, due to recent human
transport of insects between continents in vegetable crops.

Methods
Field sampling of insects on four continents
Between 2001–2006 we sampled Plutella xylostella individuals from 33 sites in 10 countries: Australia, New Zealand,
Malaysia (Peninsular and Sabah), Kenya, South Africa,
United Kingdom, Taiwan, Sweden, Germany and Hawaii.
We also included three Plutella porrectella individuals from
the UK as outgroups. Insects used were either final instar
larvae or adults and were field caught individuals or their
F1 offspring (except Sweden, South Africa and UK –
Oxford, which were laboratory cultures). Insects were
stored in 70–100% ethanol for preservation of DNA.
DNA extraction
To minimise the risk of contamination, the pre-extraction
treatment and all DNA extractions were performed under
sterile conditions After taking insects out of their collection
tubes, each individual was cleaned by immersion in 70%
ethanol, followed by two rinses in double-distilled DNA/
RNA free water and then allowed to dry for 5 min. Larvae
were dissected and checked for endoparasites. DNA was
then extracted by grinding the abdomen of adults, or the
entire larva, in 200 ul of 5% Biorad Chelex 100 resin solution in the presence of proteinease K (12μg/μl), followed
by 3 h incubation at 55°C and 15 min boiling at 96°C. The
samples were then centrifuged and stored at -20°C until
use. For each set of extractions a blank extraction was performed using all the reagents minus the DNA extract (this
was performed at least once for every 10 insects).

Wolbachia screening and sequencing
We tested 306 individuals for the presence of Wolbachia
infection with PCR using extended versions of the Wolbachia specific primers ftsZf1 5' GTT GTC GCA WTA CYG
ATG CTC A 3' and ftsZr1 5' CTT AAG TAA GCT GGT ATA
TCA ATA 3' [26] to amplify an approximately 1000 bp
stretch of the FtsZ gene encoding the bacterial cell cycling
gene. We scored individuals yielding a product of the
expected size as provisionally infected, and samples that
did not amplify as provisionally uninfected.

DNA extracts that tested positive for ftsZ were then double-checked by performing a PCR using a different set of
Wolbachia specific primers (wsp81F and wsp691R) [27],
which amplify the wsp (Wolbachia Surface Protein) gene
and yield a product of approximately 550 bp. All samples
that were positive for ftsZ also tested positive using the wsp
primers. We later sequenced these wsp products.
Provisional negative samples were tested for the quality of
DNA extract by performing PCR for part of the insect
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene. We
used C1-J-2183 (alias Jerry) and L2-N-3014 (alias Pat)
primers, which yield an approximately 1000 bp product
[28]. If CO1 PCR was successful, we regarded the sample
as uninfected. If it failed, we excluded the sample from
our data. DNA extracts that scored as Wolbachia infected
were also amplified for the CO1 gene. All the CO1 genes
amplified were later sequenced.
Finally, a segment of the nuclear L27a gene, encoding the
ribosomal protein L27a was amplified using the primers
L27aFor1 5' ACG GTC ATG GAC GTA TCG GTA A 3' and
L27aRev2 5' ATG TTG ATG ACT GGC ACC TTG C 3' (S.
Baxter, pers. comm.) to yield an approximately 200 bp
product, which was later sequenced.
The PCR temperature profile for ftsZ was 95°C for 30 sec,
55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, for a total of 35
cycles, and final elongation time of 7 min at 72°C. We
used the same conditions for wsp, L27a and CO1 (annealing temperature reduced to 50°C). We electrophoresed 25
ul of each PCR product on a 1% agarose gel to determine
amplicon presence and size. We excised gel bands and
purified them using a GFX DNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), before sequencing directly
in both directions using the PCR primers. Sequences were
obtained using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer Inc.) and the ABI Prism
3700 DNA Analyser (Perkin Elmer Inc.) and assembled
using Sequencher™ (Gene Codes Cooperation).
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned manually using SE-AL v2.0a11
Carbon [following previous alignments and excluding the
third hypervariable region in the case of wsp [9,27,29]].

There were no gaps in the CO1 sequence alignment of P.
xylostella samples. There was a 9 bp gap that started at base
182 in the L27a sequence alignment. All phylogenies were
estimated using PAUP* version 4.0b [30].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/49

valleys are separated by forested mountain ridges and
consist of farms that grow commercial Brassica plants and
other vegetables.

To determine the phylogenetic affinities of the Wolbachia
isolates we constructed a neighbour-joining tree [31] of
the wsp sequences. We adopted the standard criterion of
2.5% wsp sequence divergence to distinguish between
Wolbachia isolates [27]. Isolates differing by this amount
should be discrete infections, although recent work shows
that infections with similar sequences in one gene may
differ considerably in other genes, making a multi-locus
strain typing (MLST) approach necessary to show close
identity of apparently similar isolates from different hosts
[32,33].

We established two plutWB1 infected lines (17 and 95)
and three uninfected ones (26, 61 and 86) from the fieldsampled insects by mating a virgin male with a virgin
female individual. Each line was kept in a rectangular,
transparent container (116 × 8 × 7 cm L × W × D) and containing a cotton-wool ball soaked in 10% honey solution
and an egg-laying sheet (tin foil, 13 × 5 cm) dipped in cabbage solution (65 g cabbage per 500 ml ddH20) for 3 days.
We then reared the eggs produced by each pair to the
pupal stage on Brassica napus seedling trays (50 × 25 × 6
cm) in cages with a metal cube frame, covered in fine netting. To avoid overcrowding, no more than 100 larvae
were reared per seedling tray.

MtDNA (CO1) phylogeny was reconstructed using NJ and
MP methods. MP trees were reconstructed using the
method of Quicke et al. [34] by conducting an initial heuristic search of 10,000 random additions, tree-bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch swapping, and holding one
tree per replicate. We then used the trees generated by the
initial search as starting trees for a second heuristic search,
in which we saved multiple trees. We assessed clade support using 1000 bootstrap replications.

To continue each isofemale line, pupae were collected and
placed in individual tubes and checked daily for emergence of adults. At least 100 individuals (50 males and 50
females) from each isofemale line were then placed in
containers (with an egg laying sheet and honey solution)
for 3 days. Subsequently, the eggs were reared and the isofemale line continued as above.

We used MODELTEST 3.06 [35] to select nucleotide substitution models for NJ trees. The model HKY+G was
selected for wsp and CO1. Bootstrap values were generated
from 10,000 replicates. We rooted the mtDNA phylogeny
using the outgroup (Plutella porrectalla).
MtDNA haplotype analysis
Haplotype number, haplotype diversity and nucleotide
diversity (π) [36-38] were calculated for five geographic
regions: 1. Australasia (Australia/New Zealand), 2. Africa
(Kenya/South Africa), 3. Europe (UK, Germany, Sweden),
4. Asia (Malaysia, Taiwan) and 5. Hawaii, and also for
matched infected and uninfected groups (Tables 2 &3).
Haplotype diversity describes the number and frequency
of different haplotypes and nucleotide diversity is defined
as the average number of pair-wise nucleotide difference
per site. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity measurements are appropriate for this type of data because they do
not depend on the length of DNA fragment or sample size
[36], unlike the number of pairwise nucleotide differences
or haplotypes.
Phenotypic effects of plutWB1
We collected individuals from four valleys in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia in May 2004 to obtain data on
field sex ratios and insects to establish isofemale laboratory lines. We scored 293 individuals collected as last
instar larvae or pupae and then reared to adulthood. The

In each generation the sex ratio of each line was recorded
by counting the total number of male and females. The
prevalence of plutWB1 was estimated by screening at least
10 males and 10 females per line. However, low numbers
reduced sample size in two lines (17, 95) in generations
one and two. The lines were kept in a controlled environment room, with a 16:8 light: dark cycle, at 23 C and 50–
75% humidity.
Statistical analysis of the phenotypic effects of Wolbachia
We first tested whether plutWB1 infection was associated
with host sex ratio distortion and then whether there was
evidence for male-killing. Since both sex ratio and infection status are binomial variables yielding proportion
data, we arcsin transformed [arcsin(√proportion (p)] these
variables. Data analysis was performed in Excel with the
Analysis-It software.

We tested for departures from a 1:1 sex ratio in field populations using the Chi-squared test on data from individual and pooled valleys in the Cameron Highlands,
Malaysia. The same test for deviation from 1:1 was also
used for sex ratios of infected and uninfected isofemale
lines.
We tested for a significant difference in sex ratio between
infected and uninfected lab lines. We first used an
unpaired t-test to examine if there was any significant difference in the sex ratio between infected and uninfected

lines, using the total numbers of males and females in all
nine generations for each line. We then examined whether
infected lines varied across generations, by comparing the
sex ratios of early (1 to 3), mid (4–6) and late (7 to 9) generations using a repeated measures ANOVA. Finally, we
confirmed that there was no difference between the two
infected lines using a paired t-test (t = 0.46, d.f. = 8, P >
0.05).

For infection frequency, we first confirmed that there was
no difference between the two infected lines, using a
paired t-test (t = 1.51, d.f. = 8, P > 0.05). This then allowed
us to use the two lines as independent replicates in a
repeated measures ANOVA to test if infection frequency
changed between early, mid and late generations (see
above). We conducted this analysis for males and females
separately. Finally, we used a t-test on all males and all
females to test for a sex difference in infection frequency.
This focus on differences between the sexes is because a
male-killing Wolbachia infection is expected to occur at
(much) lower frequency in males than in females, unless
effective host resistance has evolved.
