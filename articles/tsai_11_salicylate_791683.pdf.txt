Phenolic metabolites that contain salicylic acid (SA)-like
moieties are major non-structural constituents in Populus leaves, shoots and roots. These so-called phenolic
glycosides (PGs) are taxonomically limited to the Salicaceae, where they are known to mitigate insect and animal herbivory. SA itself is an important signaling
molecule in plant defense and abiotic stress responses,
and is derived from the isochorismate or phenylpropanoid pathways, depending on the species [1,2]. Hyperaccumulation of SA reduces growth in Arabidopsis[3],
while high levels of PG have been associated with
reduced growth in Populus[4]. Although the common
PGs, salicin, salicortin, and their derivatives contain a
salicyl moiety, a direct metabolic relationship between
PG and SA in Populus has not been shown. We have
therefore been using stable isotope tracers, cell culture
feeding, functional genomics and transgenic perturbation to probe the relationship between SA, PG and
growth in Populus.
Stable isotope incorporation confirmed a hydroxycinnamate-benzoate origin of the salicyl moiety of PGs, and
provided the first empirical evidence that the bioactive
hydroxycyclohexenone moiety of salicortin is also a phenylpropanoid derivative [5]. Therefore it is unlikely that
PG biosynthesis involves the salicylic acid pathway. To
further address any possible involvement of the isochorismate pathway in PG biosynthesis, isochorismate
synthase (ICS) was characterized. ICS is present as a single-gene in most sequenced plant genomes, but is duplicated in Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis, chorismate-derived
SA is the obligatory route for defense signaling,
mediated by AtICS1 in response to various biotic and
abiotic cues. In contrast, the single-copy Populus ICS is
not stress-inducible, and is involved in biosynthesis of
phylloquinone for photosynthetic electron transport [2].

We found no evidence of ICS involvement in SA or PG
biosynthesis in transgenic Populus, pointing to lineagespecific evolution of the ICS-derived SA pathway in
Arabidopsis.
We transformed Populus with the bacterial genes for
the biosynthesis and degradation of SA for a more indepth investigation of the possibility of an SA interaction with PG regulation. SA-hyperaccumulating and
SA-deficient lines were generated by expressing a salicylate synthase and a salicylate hydroxylase, respectively.
SA was converted to SA-glycoside (SAG) and gentisic
acid-glucoside (GAG) in the hyperaccumulating lines.
SAG and GAG were very low in wild-type and were not
detected in the SA-deficient lines. Despite these clear
differences, no changes in PG levels were detected.
These results argue against SA as potential precursor of
PGs. Survival and establishment of rooted cuttings were
negatively affected by SA-hyperaccumulation. Once
established, however, growth rates were similar among
plant lines, in sharp contrast to SA-over-producing Arabidopsis. SA-hyperaccumulating lines exhibited altered
thermal tolerance, based on electrolyte leakage assays
and metabolite profiling. Together, our results provide
support for a phenylpropanoid origin of PGs, and argue
against the involvement of SA in PG biosynthesis. The
data is consistent with complementary roles for SA and
PG in Populus fitness.
A number of other experiments were conducted to
investigate the regulation of PG homeostasis in Populus.
Administration of a putative PG precursor salicyl alcohol to cell cultures yielded the glucoside, salicin. Salicyl
alcohol-feeding also altered the partitioning of carbon
into condensed tannin (CT) biosynthesis, another quantitatively important phenylpropanoid product [6]. Salicyl
alcohol-feeding induced expression of several glycosyltransferases (GT1), as well as genes associated with
sucrose catabolism, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, presumably to accommodate the increased glycosylation.

Conversely, transcript levels of most of the flavonoid
pathway genes were reduced, consistent with reduced
CT synthesis. Given that glycosylation was the only PG
biosynthetic step occurring in the fed-cells, the results
suggest that glycosylation of phenolic products can play
a role in regulating the tradeoff between competing chemical defenses, e.g., PGs and CTs.
Correlation analysis was used to identify PG-coregulated genes from a number of inductive treatments. One
such candidate, SUT4 encoding a tonoplast sucrose
transporter, was of particular interest because of the
reported salicin transport activity of its Arabidopsis
ortholog. RNAi-silencing of SUT4 altered sucrose distribution between source and sink organs, and reduced PG
accrual by 20-30%, accompanied by altered biomass partitioning [7]. Chemical and molecular analyses revealed
a complex network linking PG accrual and carbohydrate
homeostasis.
PG-coregulated GT1 members were also targeted for
characterization, due to the prominent role of glycosylation in PG biosynthesis. We identified a novel salicyl
alcohol glycosyltransferase (UGT71L1). Over-expression
of UGT71L1 in transgenic Populus led to a ~2-fold
increase in concentrations of salicin and salicortin in
roots. The quantitative effect on secondary metabolism
is significant, as PGs are the second most abundant
non-structural phenolics, after CTs, in the roots of this
poplar clone. UGT71L1 is phylogenetically distinct from
the well-characterized SAGTs. It belongs to a Populusspecific clade with no close homologs in Arabidopsis,
Vitis,Medicago and Oryza, consistent with the limited
taxonomic range of PGs. Overall, the experiments
described highlight the important contributions of sugar
transport and phenolic glycosylation to PG homeostasis,
while also showing that SA and PGs make independent
but complementary contributions toward the maintenance of Populus fitness.
