melanogaster cell lines

Abstract
Background: During Drosophila development, titers of the steroid ecdysone trigger and maintain temporal and
tissue specific biological transitions. Decades of evidence reveal that the ecdysone response is both unique to
specific tissues and distinct among developmental timepoints. To achieve this diversity in response, the several
isoforms of the Ecdysone Receptor, which transduce the hormone signal to the genome level, are believed to
interact with tissue specific cofactors. To date, little is known about the identity of these cofactor interactions;
therefore, we conducted a bioinformatics informed, RNAi luciferase reporter screen against a subset of putative
candidate cofactors identified through an in silico proteome screen. Candidates were chosen based on criteria
obtained from bioinformatic consensus of known nuclear receptor cofactors and homologs, including amino acid
sequence motif content and context.
Results: The bioinformatics pre-screen of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome was successful in identifying an
enriched putative candidate gene cohort. Over 80% of the genes tested yielded a positive hit in our reporter
screen. We have identified both cell type specific and common cofactors which appear to be necessary for proper
ecdysone induced gene regulation. We have determined that certain cofactors act as co-repressors to reduce
target gene expression, while others act as co-activators to increase target gene expression. Interestingly, we find
that a few of the cofactors shared among cell types have a reversible roles to function as co-repressors in certain
cell types while in other cell types they serve as co-activators. Lastly, these proteins are highly conserved, with
higher order organism homologs also harboring the LXXLL steroid receptor interaction domains, suggesting a
highly conserved mode of steroid cell target specificity.
Conclusions: In conclusion, we submit these cofactors as novel components of the ecdysone signaling pathway in
order to further elucidate the dynamics of steroid specificity.

Background
Steroid hormones regulate many developmental processes in higher organisms, including postembryonic
development, metamorphosis, and reproduction [1-3].
Pulses of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone
(referred to from here on as ecdysone) direct the morphological transitions of Drosophila throughout its life
cycle [4-12]. Titers of ecdysone increase before each

postembryonic larval molt and it is required for triggering metamorphosis transitions [3]. One of the highest
peaks of ecdysone triggers the transition from third larval
instar to puparium formation at the onset of metamorphosis, which involves simultaneous down-regulation of
cell death inhibitors and up-regulation of cell death activators in larval tissues while activating proliferation and
differentiation cascades in imaginal tissues [2,3,13]. This
increase in the ecdysone titer during puparium formation
is transduced to the target gene level via an Ecdysone
Receptor (EcR)/Ultraspiracle (USP) heterodimeric complex [14]. As established by the Ashburner model, this

complex activates a cascade of transcription factors [3,14]
called early genes [1,15-17] and concurrently represses a
set of ‘late genes’. These “early genes” coordinate the
temporal and spatial activation of late genes, which then
carry out the metamorphic process [14,17].
The EcR/USP heterodimer is a conserved protein complex that resembles several vertebrate nuclear receptor
complexes. Thus, the discovery that the tissue specificity
of vertebrate nuclear receptor transcription is mediated
by coregulators led to identification of Drosophila
nuclear receptor coregulators [18]. While many of the
molecular mechanisms involving the ecdysone response
are known, very little is known about the coregulators
required for proper signal transduction and specificity.
Because ecdysone controls varied functions in distinct
tissue types, it is likely that specific cofactors interact
with EcR in the various tissue types. We have sought to
identify at least a subset of these unknown cofactors by
utilizing a bioinformatically informed RNAi luciferase
reporter screen.
Extensive evidence has shown that many steroid receptor cofactor proteins harbor an LXXLL motif, where L is
leucine and × is any amino acid [19-21]. The LXXLL
motif was first identified in proteins that are important in
nuclear receptor (NR) regulation and specifically bind to
the AF-2 region of nuclear receptor Ligand Binding
Domains (LBDs) [19]. Subsequently, data continued to
reveal that many steroid receptor coactivators that
enhance transcriptional regulatory function of the NRs
have interacting domains that contain highly conserved
LXXLL motifs (LXD’s)[22,23], and that these domains
are both necessary and sufficient to mediate association
of coactivators to ligand-bound receptors [24] by an
alpha helical locking mechanism which causes the receptor to retain secure binding of the ligand. Conversely,
steroid corepressors tend to contain extended LXD
motifs, often some version of LXLXXL or LXIXXL,
which impedes the binding of ligand molecules and
thereby removing the transcriptional activation of the
hormone signal [21]. The clinical and developmental
necessity of these domains is further exhibited in familial
disorders in humans, attributed to genetic variations
which ablate these domains and impede steroid functions
[25].
For the study reported here, we conducted an in silico
pre-screen of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome to
identify putative cofactor candidates that were then interrogated in an RNAi in situ luciferase reporter screen. Using
prior knowledge of spatial structure amino acid context
and abundance of LXD motifs in known coactivators and
corepressors, we compiled a list of candidate EcR cofactors.
Also, by including a computational screen of Drosophila
proteome function and interaction databases [26-29], we
filtered the candidate gene list for transcriptional function

and/or known physical interaction with transcription factor
complexes. Ultimately, this functional study included 95
putative EcR cofactors (Table 1) and we utilized four distinct cell lines to investigate tissue specificity of cofactor
function. The cell lines included, two embryonic lines
(Kc167 and S2) and two imaginal lines (L1 and D20), all of
which were derived from unique tissue sources, in order to
determine whether the specific cofactors are involved in
either activation or repression of the ecdysone reporter
gene in distinct tissue types.

Results
In silico pre-screen of Drosophila melanogaster proteome
for putative cofactors; LXD motifs predict cofactor
function

Our first goal, in experimental design, was to conduct a
concise functional screen of deduced putative cofactors as
opposed to a more expensive, data intensive and false
positive stricken whole genome screen. Armed with compelling evidence of cofactor protein LXD domains from
Yeast to Human and all in between, we have focused our
cofactor search on proteins which harbor these extensively
studied LXD motifs. Accordingly, we anticipate increasing
the probability of finding actual cofactor hits in our reporter screen by capturing the putative cofactors which have
the necessary structure to function as a steroid receptor
cofactor. Recent directed mutagenesis studies have shown
that the LXXLL (LXD) motif creates an AF-2 interaction
domain necessary for coactivator function of specific steroid receptor complexes and is further characterized as
having specific hydrophobicities and charged amino acid
contexts [19,20,30-38]. Based upon this evidence, we utilized an extensive search for the LXD and extended LXD
motifs throughout all proteins in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.
We initially identified 4782 genes with at least one LXD
according to the genome annotation version, Dmel r3.1
http://www.Flybase.org. Already having reduced the
15,000 gene genome by over 70%, we then utilized the
functional protein models of known coactivators and corepressors to enhance our in silico screen for amino acid
context. Our next level of filtering required the proteins to
have more than one LXD within 200 amino acids
[20,37,39-41] as the published steroid receptors all had at
least two motifs (Figure 1A). In addition to these LXD
motif requirements, we also incorporated the flanking
regional properties of amino acid charge and hydrophobicity common to known nuclear receptor cofactors. By
using these characteristics of known cofactor LXD’s as
pre-filtering parameters [37,38,40,42-47], we identified 130
genes which matched the requisite motif primary
sequence, protein sub-structure and amino acid composition. This list of putative cofactors yielded a Gene Ontology enrichment for “positive regulation of transcription”,

Listed in the order of orientation in the 96 well plate assay. Symbols in superscript next to gene symbols summarize the results from our RNAi screen for each
cell type; * indicates the cofactor was a hit in D20, ~ indicates the cofactor was a hit in L1, + indicates the cofactor was a hit in Kc, ^indicates the cofactor was a
hit in S2. In addition, columns indicating whether candidates are also binding targets for EcR based on published whole genome assays and the average
expression level of each gene in the relevant cell types from data extracted from NCBI GEO (normalized expression units). Over 85% of the putative candidates
were significant hits in our screen

with a Benjamini corrected p-value of 1.5E-6 which further
supported the impact of our proteome pre-screen.
In addition, similar to the LXD motif, extensive evidence has indicated that “extended LXD motifs” within
corepressor proteins have an antagonistic effect on
nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. Using similar
algorithms developed for the LXD search, we conducted
an in silico proteome screen for the extended LXD
motif and found 563 genes with at least one extended
LXD. Of these, only 24 had two or more motifs and we
used each of these in our study. This list did not show a
statistically significant enrichment of negative regulation
after Benjamini correction; however, there was a clear
enrichment of transcriptional regulation.
As another bioinformatics measure, we queried the
NCBI GEO database to determine if our putative cofactors were all expressed in the cell lines of interest
(Table 1). While not all candidates appeared to be
expressed in each cell line, we did confirm that during
the lifecycle, all genes were expressed at timepoints relevant to at least one pulse of ecdysone. Ultimately, our in
silico screen did identify previously known EcR cofactors, such as Taiman and Kruppel, which we have
included in our assay. This suggests our in silico search
was successful in predetermining cofactors of the hormone receptor signal.
The luciferase screen is ecdysone responsive

To ensure that our reporter screen would be effective in
identifying EcR cofactors, test transfections were performed in Kc176 and S2 cell lines with Pal1sx-188ccLuc

and S188cc-RLuc plasmids [48] to first ensure the transfections were successful and also that the in vitro reporter system is 20 hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) responsive
(Figure 1B and 1C). The expression constructs and the
reporter construct architecture are depicted in Figure 1B.
Cells transfected with the reporter construct alone displayed low levels of luciferase activity, indicating the
transfection was successful (data not shown). However,
since this plasmid is not under an EcRE promoter, there
was no difference in luciferase activity in cells treated
with ecdysone. Therefore, we employed an ecdysone sensitive test plasmid to measure the hormone sensitivity of
the transfection/reporter system in each cell line (Figure
1C). The Pal1sx-188ccLuc construct harbors a 5X EcRE
promoter and shows significant differences (over 10 fold)
in luciferase activity between cells treated with or without
ecdysone (Figure 1C - top). These results indicate that
the cell line system is ecdysone responsive. We next
tested the sensitivity of our actual assay plasmids. The
co-transfection of the expression and reporter constructs
also show ecdysone sensitivity and expected lower levels
(due to lack of the 5X EcRE), but within 2-4 fold induction of reporter expression (Figure 1C- bottom).
Distinct cofactor behavior among cell types

We chose four cell lines for our study, representing two
tissue types; imaginal discs and embryonic (Figure 2).
Previous seminal ecdysone treatment studies indicate
each cell type exhibits unique morphological responses
to the hormone [49-51], correlating to the original tissue
response which are also summarized in Flybase and the

Drosophila Genome Resource Center references. These
data suggest that different subsets of target genes are
modified during hormone pulses within each cell type. In
validation of this, a recently published study [52] shows
distinct gene signatures in each of our cell lines, in
response to the same ecdysone treatment. To accomplish
this targeting of distinct genes by ecdysone in the organism, we hypothesize the different cell lines have unique
cofactors which direct the receptor to targeted genes of
specific functions and determine whether the target
genes will be activated or repressed. Figure 2A depicts
the pairwise statistical testing of each cell lines’ mean differences of reporter gene expression in response to the
RNAi knockdown of 95 putative cofactors (Table 1) following ecdysone treatment. The results show each cell
line exhibited significantly unique reporter gene activity
across the assay when compared to one another. This

indicates there is considerable cell type specificity of
cofactor actions on the reporter construct, which most
likely correlates to the endogenous ecdysone target gene
response.
Figure 3 displays a scatterplot of normalized reporter
gene expression levels for each cofactor knockdown (in
order of 96 well orientation, see Table 1) and color/marker
coded by cell type. We see on a gene by gene basis that
each of the cofactors tested have a varying range of reporter gene impact among the different cell types. Statistical
testing indicated that each cell line had a significant number of unique reporter gene modulations, meaning within
each cell type, each cofactor hit had a distinct reporter
gene impact from the other cofactors (Figure 3) (i.e. no
single cofactor had the same impact on reporter response
across all cell types). Pearson correlation analyses indicate
none of the cell line assays were significantly correlated;

however, the two embryonic cell lines’ (Kc and S2 =
0.1479) assays were relatively more similar when compared to the correlation scores against imaginal cell lines
(-0.072) while L1 and D20 showed the same trend. This
result is to be expected, as the lines are not derived from
the same type of embryonic or imaginal disc origin tissues
and we would expect the distinct differentiation mechanisms of each organ in response to ecdysone pulses requires
unique cofactors for divergent organogenesis pathways.
Bi-polar cofactors, tissue-type specificity of transcriptional
coactivator vs corepressor regulation

The nature of our experimental design allowed us to distinguish between coactivators and corepressors in our
ecdysone inducible system. In fact, within some lines the
removal of particular cofactors causes a higher level of
hormone induced activation of the reporter, when

compared to the no RNAi (well A10) while in other cell
types it causes repression (Figure 3 and Table 2). We
found that 9 cofactors function as both coactivators and
corepressors in a cell type dependant manner. Cofactors
which exhibit this bi-polar regulation effect harbor both
the LXD and extended LXD motifs in their amino
sequence (Figure 4A). Of these, three genes show the
strongest tissue type correlation of polarity in reporter
gene response where they have the same activation or
repression conserved within embryonic, in contrast to
having the opposite activity in imaginal cell types. These
genes, Twister, Kismet and RfC3 show pulses of expression during both metamorphosis and embryogenesis
(Figure 4B) and are each highly conserved proteins
(Figure 5). This suggests that preferential usage of certain
domains could be the mode of achieving differential target gene responses unique to certain tissue type.

Cofactors elucidated from our screen are implicated in
ecdysone signaling

Of the 94 cofactors tested 37 were implicated as cofactors
in D20 cells, 18 were implicated as cofactors in L1 cells,
19 were implicated as cofactors in Kc cells, and 35 were
implicated as cofactors in S2 cells (Table 2). In addition,
there were several cofactors found to be shared among
different cell types (Table 3).
Seven cofactors were common to both the embryonic
lines, Kc and S2 (Table 3) and are therefore considered to
be embryonic specific ecdysone cofactors. Several of these
genes have highly conserved functions throughout the animal kingdom and a few are conserved even within plant
and bacteria (Figure 5). The temporal and spatial expression patterns of our cofactors correlate with ecdysone
pulses and EcR action. For example, Rfx is an RNA Pol II
transcription factor that is expressed in the peripheral nervous system and brain during embryogenesis [53], is
absent in the sensory organ precursors of imaginal discs,

and then appears again after puparium formation [54].
Mor encodes for a component of the ATP-dependent
chromatin remodeling BRM complex, and is thought to be
essential for complex integrity [55,56]. Mor transcription is
regulated by the DRE/DREF regulatory pathway, which is
required for expression of genes involved in cell proliferation [56] and implicated in ecdysone regulation [57].
MED23 has RNA Pol II transcription mediator activity
and is involved in transcription initiation from the RNA
Pol II promoter. MED23 is a part of the Mediator complex
and is required for differentiation-inducing factor and
heat-shock factor mediated transcriptional activation [58]
both of which are related to ecdysone regulation. Orc5
plays a crucial role in cellular proliferation through its
involvement in DNA replication and chromosome condensation and organization during mitosis [59]. Boss
encodes a G protein coupled receptor that is required for
propter insulin signaling [60]. Taf2, a TATA-box binding
protein-associated factor, is involved in transcription

initiation from the RNA Pol II promoter and is essential
for viability [61].
Four implicated cofactors were common to both
imaginal lines, D20 and L1 (Table 3). Polycomb (Pc) is
extensively known to form multi-protein chromatin
complexes which maintain transcriptional repression of
homeotic genes throughout development via chromatin
remodeling and histone modification [62] and has
recently been implicated in an ecdysone mediated regulation of neuronal remodeling [63]. Kismet (Kis) a
member of the CHD subfamily of chromatin-remodeling factors is thought to stimulate early elongation by
Pol II and counteract Pc group repression [64]. It has
a temporal expression pattern which correlates with
ecdysone activity (Figure 4) Myospheroid (Mys), which
encodes the b integrin bPS, is involved in the behavioral responses to aversive and attractive odorants
[65]. Alien has been shown to be a corepressor of

nuclear hormone receptors EcR and TR, and is
thought to mediate gene repression by recruitment of
SIN3A [66]. Incidentally, in our study Sin3A was found
to be an implicated cofactor in D20, the imaginal
antennal disc line (Table 1).
Twister (Tst) is the only cofactor that was implicated in
the EcR signaling pathway in all four cell lines. Tst has
homology to both yeast and human RNA helicases and
has protein motifs that are typical of the Superfamily II
helicase family, and is thought to be involved in the 3’-5’
mRNA turnover pathway in Drosophila [67]. Tst is
expressed in two transcript variants which result in two
protein products that vary in size and are differentially
expressed throughout drosophila development [67]
Babo, a TGF-b/Activin type I receptor and an implicated cofactor in L1 and Kc lines, is known to mediate
neuronal remodeling in Drosophila by upregulation of
expression of the EcR isoform EcR-B1 [68].

Discussion
Evolution of LXD motifs may impact steroid receptor
cofactor interaction and function

Previous studies have investigated the evolution of nuclear
receptor cofactors and their amino acid sequence conservations [18,69-72]. Alignments of amino acid sequences
with human homologs were done for the cofactors which
were common among most of the cell types. Alignments
revealed that these proteins’ amino acid sequences were
significantly conserved and their homologs also retained
specific cofactor functions. Intriguingly, the Drosophila
coactivator proteins investigated have LXD motif regions
that are also present in human homologs indicating their
potentially conserved function and also implying their
importance in development (Figure 5). For instance two
proteins which functioned as co-repressors in our screen
(Twister and Kismet) harbor extended LXD motifs conserved in humans that would be necessary for receptor
repression interaction, and their human homologs are also

annotated to function as negative regulators of transcription [67,73]. In contrast, the Kismet human homolog is
annotated (GO) to be an RNA helicase which may now
implicate helicase activity for proper ecdysone regulation
of target genes. In addition, as mentioned above, we were
able to find co-existing LXD and extend LXD motifs in
the ‘bi-polar’ cofactors that were also present in their
human homologs. Indeed, at least one of these corepressors (SKI2W) plays a dual role as a positive regulator of
transcription in human models and harbors both LXD
an extended LXD motif (Figure 4), which is necessary
for receptor activator interaction. In some cofactor LXD
motifs, the human homologs appear to have only remnants of the LXD motifs and or development of new
motifs. For instance, we found that several human coactivator homologs have a different structure of the LXD
domains and/or an increase in the number of motifs. In at
least one homolog comparison we find that the drosophila
coactivator functions as a corepressor in humans and the

Seven of the cofactors tested appear to be embryonic specific while four appear to be imaginal cell specific.

LXD motif appears to have evolved into an extended LXD
motif. This suggests that in conjunction with this transformed function, the human homolog protein structure
has transformed as an extended motif in comparison to
the drosophila protein which only has two short LXD
motifs. This finding thus sets a stage to investigate the
micro-evolution of LXD domains and correlating function
of corepressor vs coactivator.
Due to the increased complexity of steroid signaling
between flies and humans, in both variety and function,
we would expect to see many sequence differences among
homologs. The trend of conserved motifs and/or novel
motifs that correlate with transformed transcriptional regulation polarity suggests there is potential to identify
mechanisms of molecular evolution of steroid networks
on a systematic level. For this study, we did not investigate
whether each of the Drosophila coactivators, has a human
homolog which could have transformed into corepressors
through emergent extended LXD motifs (or vice versa).
Such an investigation would be extremely intriguing and
we will begin this interrogation presently. This type of in-

depth analysis of transitioning motifs throughout the phylogenic tree can uncover the mode of functional transformation that leads to steroid signaling dynamics among
different organisms and would be ground breaking in
terms of evolutionary biodiversity and steroid signaling
network dynamics.
Conservation across all phyla indicates highly utilized and
required cofactor function

Several of the cofactor hits in our screens are highly conserved across all phyla (Figure 6) suggesting a highly conserved mechanism of tissue specific steroid target gene
regulation. Indeed, steroid signaling is an integral part of
development in all animals and even in plant morphogenesis, phytoecdysteroids play important roles [74]. With the
presence of homologs in higher organisms and with such
high scores of sequence conservation, we can assume that
because these proteins have been conserved through so
many layers of evolution that they are essential components of viability or development and these cofactor interactions, while still somewhat a mystery in terms of direct

interactions and cell type specific impacts, are crucial to
proper target gene regulation in response to steroidal cues.
In fact, the most highly conserved proteins appear to be
components in protein complexes which function in basic
transcriptional machinery and chromatin remodeling,
such as brm, elf51 and tbp-1. In contrast, some metamorphic specific genes are only moderately conserved
throughout animals, such as SUR2 and mys, indicating
these cofactors are probably exclusively functional in true
steroid signaling regulation and transduction involved in
morphogenic animal processes (Figure 6A and 6B
respectively).
Further studies of homolog interaction with EcR homology receptors will uncover whether tissue specific cofactor-receptor interactions are maintained throughout
different phyla. This will greatly impact and inform translational investigations which utilize model organism interrogation of hormone signals to elucidate human disease
and treatment models.
Networks of cofactor interactions may uncover the
heterogeneity of hormone receptor complexes

Previous studies have investigated the genome-wide interactions of proteins in Drosophila. We queried these and
other protein interaction studies using the STRING interaction database [75-77]. We found that several of the
cofactors we identified as significant to ecdysone regulation have previously been shown to interact with one
another, either genetically or physically on the protein
level. Figure 7 shows the previously identified interactions
between the cofactors identified in our study. Clearly,
there are several proteins which have not been identified
as EcR related prior to our study; however, there are some
intriguing associations which may uncover the nature of
EcR complex heterogeneity among specific cell types. For
instance, our data indicates that the strongest hit in our
study, Moira, indirectly interacts with EcR through
approximately 3-5 degrees of experimental separation (S2
and Kc). This involvement with ecdysone signaling
through brahma complexes has been suggested prior to
our cofactor screen [78] where ecdysone inducible genes
were highly misregulated in the absence of brahma complex genes. Our study shows functional validation of this
hormone signal interaction with the complex as several
components of the brahma family have been implicated in
ecdysone signaling. It appears, in our reporter system, its
interaction requires components of the brahma complex.
Similarly, mys has been implicated in imaginal disc processes regulated by ecdysone and our study is the first to
show valid transcriptional functional interaction. A phenotypic enhancement screen previously showed a low confidence single degree of separation between mys and EcR

Page 13 of 18

(GRID interaction database). In our screen, we find that
mys is a significant hit in both imaginal disc cell lines, corresponding well with their specific tissue origin.

Conclusions
Steroid signaling cell type specificity... unraveling
complexity

In our ecdysone inducible reporter system, we have clearly
shown that the knockdown of over 80 putative candidate
genes have a significant impact on reporter gene expression in a cell type specific manner, implying their cofactor
activity with the endogenous EcR. We submit these cofactors as novel components of the ecdysone signaling pathway as coregulators to achieve spatial distinction of target
gene regulation. For decades, it has been readily accepted
that steroid signaling, while exposed to the entirety of an
organism, is quite refined and directed in organ specific
responses. Using a biologically informed in silico search,
we have quickly identified and validated several of the cell
type specific cofactors necessary for proper target gene
regulation. While several of these genes have been implicated in ecdysone related process, this is the first time
they are presented to have direct influence on ecdysone
target gene regulation.
Dynamics of tissue specific transcriptional polarity of
cofactor interactions

While certain cofactors have exhibited a distinct coactivator or corepressor function, several have exhibited
potential to play both roles in distinct cell types. To
achieve the function of both corepressor and coactivator,
we have confirmed that these proteins harbor both
LXXLL domains (coactivator specific) and extended
LXXLL domains (corepressor specific). These domains
are also conserved in higher order homologs (Figure 5)
along with conserved annotated function. This work has
shed light upon molecular mechanisms of tissue specific
protein interactions in the context of steroid hormone
spatial specificity.
While we were unable to address this in our current
study, we know that EcR has distinct isoforms with preferential expression in certain tissue types (i.e. EcR-B1 in larval tissues and EcR-A in imaginal tissues). We expect that
the endogenous EcR is expressed during this assay and
may interact with the reporter plasmid. Therefore, our
data may indicate that the mode of action for specific
cofactors is most likely not via the same direct interaction
with the receptor and this perhaps could be due to different receptor isoforms having distinct AF-2 domains and
therefore, exhibiting a distinct functional interaction
potential with the cofactor. This work lays groundwork for
identifying preferential protein domain interactions

between specific cofactor LXD or extended LXD domains
and the AF-2 domains of distinct steroid receptor isoforms. Such data would further unravel the mystery of tissue specific responses to hormone signals.

Methods
Drosophila cell culture and cell line derivation

The cell lines, S2, Kc157, D20c and L1 were utilized in this
study. The S2 and Kc cell lines are both embryonic lines

Davis et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/66

and two of the earliest established from Drosophila
[79,80]. The S2 (S2-DRSC from DGRC) line exhibits properties and markers of macrophages while the Kc line
(Kc167 from modEncode) exhibits markers of lymph
gland cells and hemocytes. Lastly, the L1 and D20 cell
lines are derived from distinct imaginal discs after the
mid-third instar competency pulse [81-83]. The L1 (CMEL1 from DGRC) line was derived from leg imaginal discs
while the D20c line (ML-Dm20c5 from the DGRC) was
derived from an eye antennae imaginal disc. All cell lines
were maintained at 25°C with no CO2 in 5 mL of media
with the composition prescribed by the cell line source,
Drosophila Genomic Resource Center (DGRC) https://
dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/cells/.
Computational screen and candidate cofactor selection

A computational screen of the Drosophila melanogaster
genome was conducted to determine putative cofactors.
The program and pipelines utilized were customized by I.
SanGil utilizing mixtures of Perl and Python scripting.
Initially, more than 44,000 amino acid sequences were
found to have the LXXLL motif, and a subset of these
sequences was found to have between 2 and 22 of the
LXXLL motifs. The majority of the known cofactors had
between two and seven motifs that were within 1,000
amino acids of each other. In addition to these LXD motif
requirements, we also incorporated the flanking regional
properties of amino acid charge and hydrophobicity common to known nuclear receptor cofactors. By using these
characteristics of known cofactor LXD’s as filtering parameters we further delineated suitable cofactor candidates.
Ultimately, these computational findings were used to create a list of the top 130 cofactor candidates to be studied
further (Davis and San Gil, unpublished). The top ninetysix of these 130 cofactors were used in this study.
dsRNA synthesis

dsRNA primer sequences were obtained from the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center at Harvard Medical
School, which is now housed and distributed through
the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. These primers are the second generation design, and have previously been tested and confirmed to have no detectable
off target effects. (Previous studies have established the
efficiency of these sets to knock down transcription/
translated levels of target genes, therefore it was not
necessary to conduct such assays in our study. More
information on OTE’s can be found at the DGRC RNAi
screening center website: http://www.flyrnai.org/DRSCHOME.html). PCR was performed using 1 μM of the
appropriate cofactor primer, 1.1 μg DNA and Platinum
Taq. In vitro RNA transcription was performed using
MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All product sizes were verified by

Page 15 of 18

running on a 1% agarose gel (data not shown). dsRNA
was purified using Multiscreen PCR plates (Millipore)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfection and ecdysone treatment of cell lines

We utilized a dual luciferase reporter system (Firefly/
Renilla), which enabled us to normalize reporter activity
with expression of an unrelated constitutively expressed
luciferase, which gives an indication of transfection efficiency. Cell lines were reverse transfected with either
Pal15x-188ccLuc or S188cc-RLuc plasmids for sensitivity
testing and the CMA-GBD-EcR-B1-N with UASx4188ccLuc for the RNAi screen [84]. The Pal15x-188ccLuc
plasmid contains a synthetic promoter enhancer region
which harbors multiple adjacent copies of an EcRE for a
known ecdysone target gene. This plasmid was mainly utilized to establish the ecdysone inducibility of our dual luciferase detection was reproducible in each cell line. The
protein expression construct, CMA-GBD-Ecr-B1-N, is a
fusion construct that contains an EcR ligand binding
domain fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain under the
regulation of an actin gene promoter (Figure 1B). UASx4188ccLuc contained the luciferase reporter gene driven by
an inducible promoter via a Gal4 UAS sequence repeat.
Cells were reverse transfected in a 96 well format with
both constructs, pooled in equal amounts, and upon activation of the EcR protein by ecdysone treatment, the Gal4
DNA binding domain was expected to bind to the UAS
and activate transcription of the luciferase gene (Figure 1).
Pal1sx-188ccLuc contains the firefly luciferase reporter
gene driven by an ecdysone-response element (EcRE). S188cc-RLuc contains the enzymatically different Renilla
luciferase and no detectable EcREs [84]. Transfections
were performed using the FuGENE Transfection Reagent
(Promega) with a 2:1 FuGENE Reagent: DNA ratio
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Three microliters of a [1 μg/ul] of ecdysone (20 Hydroxyecdysone Sigma, H5142) was added 1 hour after transfection. 100
ng of the appropriate cofactor dsRNA was added 24 hours
after ecdysone addition, therefore each screen took
approximately two days.
Luciferase assay and calculations

For each cell type, at least three replicates of the RNAi
screen was completed using a reverse transfection protocol (above) in a 96 well plate format. Luciferase activity
was detected 16-20 hours after addition of the dsRNA
using Dual-Glo Luciferase kit (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For each dsRNAi gene, the
reporter gene activity (ki) was calculated by creating an
average ratio of Renilla ((Rlu) and Firefly luciferase (Flu),
thereby normalizing for luciferase detection, across all
replicates (i-n). The luciferase reporter activity was then
transformed into a change of reporter activity (Dk i )

values by calculating the log 2 ratio of the dsRNAi gene
and the “no-RNAi” control wells’ reporter activity. The
log2 values of these ratios are shown in Figures 1 and 2,
and were used for statistical analyses to identify significant changes in reporter activity due to RNAi of a candidate gene. Any cofactor that had a standard deviation
greater than 2.0 relative to the no-RNAi control was
selected as a significant cofactor. The no-RNAi controls
were considered to be the normal ecdysone response
value as these transfected cells were treated with ecdysone but not dsRNA. Fold differences of significant
cofactors compared to removing EcR were then calculated by subtracting the EcR-RNAi value from the RNAi
cofactor reporter value.
