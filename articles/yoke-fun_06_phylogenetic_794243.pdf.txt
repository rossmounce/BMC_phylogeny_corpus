Abstract
Background: Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a common causative agent of hand, foot and
mouth disease (HFMD). In recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with high numbers
of deaths and severe neurological complications. Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified
from these outbreaks. The mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these subgenotypes
are unknown.
Results: Six EV-71 isolates from an outbreak in Malaysia, in 1997, were sequenced completely.
These isolates were identified as EV-71 subgenotypes, B3, B4 and C2. A phylogenetic tree that
correlated well with the present enterovirus classification scheme was established using these full
genome sequences and all other available full genome sequences of EV-71 and human enterovirus A
(HEV-A). Using the 5' UTR, P2 and P3 genomic regions, however, isolates of EV-71 subgenotypes
B3 and C4 segregated away from other EV-71 subgenotypes into a cluster together with
coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/G10) and EV-71 subgenotype C2 clustered with CV-A8. Results from
the similarity plot analyses supported the clustering of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast,
at the same genomic regions, a CV-A16 isolate, Tainan5079, clustered with EV-71. This suggests
that amongst EV-71 and CV-A16, only the structural genes were conserved. The 3' end of the virus
genome varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various HEV-A viruses. Numerous
recombination crossover breakpoints were identified within the non-structural genes of some of
these newer EV-71 subgenotypes.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic evidence obtained from analyses of the full genome sequence supports
the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving EV-71 and various HEV-A, including
CV-A16, the most common causal agent of HFMD. It is suggested that these recombination events
played important roles in the emergence of the various EV-71 subgenotypes.

Background
More than sixty different types of human enteroviruses
have been identified [1]. Species human enterovirus A
(HEV-A) which include 11 members of the coxsackievirus
A (CV-A) group; CV-A2, CV-A3, CV-A4, CV-A5, CV-A6,
CV-A7, CV-A8, CV-A10, CV-12, CV-14, CV-A16 and

human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) are associated with several
human diseases [1,2]. CV-A2, CV-A6, CV-A8 and CV-A10
are known to cause herpangina [2]; CV-A2, CV-A4, CV-A7
and CV-A10 cause aseptic meningitis [2] and CV-A5, CVA10, CV-A16 and EV-71 usually cause hand, foot and
mouth disease (HFMD) [2]. Amongst these HEV-A

viruses, only EV-71 is associated with major outbreaks
involving infections with severe neurological complications and deaths. Recent outbreaks in Malaysia, Taiwan
and Vietnam claimed more than 130 deaths [3,4]. In these
outbreaks, EV-71 was isolated from patients' specimens
and post-mortem tissues, suggesting its direct involvement as the etiologic agent [5,6]. Molecular epidemiological investigations performed using the partial gene
sequences of all available EV-71 isolates suggested the
presence of several EV-71 lineages co-circulating during
most of the Asian outbreaks [3,6-11]. EV-71 subgenotypes
B3, B4, C1 and C2 were reported in Malaysia with subgenotype B3 being the most prevalent in the 1997 outbreak
[3,7-9]. The subgenotype B4 was present initially at a low
level but became endemic and eventually replaced subgenotype B3 as the predominant virus in the subsequent
outbreaks in Malaysia and the region [7,9]. Neither the B3
nor B4 subgenotype, however, was associated with any
fatal infections outside the Malaysia 1997 outbreak. Similarly, the C2 isolates were identified as the main causal
agent of the HFMD-associated severe and fatal infections
during the 1998 Taiwan outbreak [6,10]. These isolates
also caused severe infections in the Perth 1999 outbreak
[7,9] but no report of serious infection or death attributed
to these isolates was recorded from the Malaysia 1997 outbreak [8,12]. Recently, two new EV-71 subgenotypes, C3
and C4 were proposed to accommodate EV-71 strains isolated from cases of aseptic meningitis and paralysis in
Korea and China, respectively [7,13,14]. There were no
reports, however, that the subgenotype C4 isolates were
associated with severe infections [13,14]. The emergence
of the various EV-71 subgenotypes with varying degree of
clinical severity is puzzling. The viruses together with
other HEV-A viruses are known to be present in the region
and usually cause the typical mild HFMD [7-9,15]. In the
present study, the potential mechanisms that could play
important role in the emergence of the different EV-71
subgenotypes are phylogenetically investigated.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships between EV-71 and other HEVA viruses
The complete genome sequences of all the EV-71 isolates
were aligned with other available HEV-A complete
genome sequences obtained from the Genbank. The total
length of the genomes varied between 7395–7434 nucleotides and they encode for 2189–2201 amino acids. The
differences in genome length were caused by the presence
of deletions or insertions within the 5' UTR, capsid gene
and 3' UTR sequences. The capsid genome region of EV-71
was longer (1 – 4 amino acids) or of the same length with
other HEV-A viruses, with the exception of CV-A4 and CVA6 which have eight extra amino acid insertions. No deletions and insertions were observed in the P2 and P3
genomic regions, hence, the gene length within these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/74

genomic regions remained constant for all the HEV-A
viruses.
EV-71 VP1 gene sequences had an average sequence divergence of 17–22% at nucleotide level and 3–8% at amino
acid level, respectively. The average sequence divergence
between EV-71 VP1 and other HEV-A viruses was 22–29%
at the nucleotide level and 10–20% at amino acid level,
respectively (not shown). These suggested that EV-71 in
general, were distinct from all the other existing HEV-A
viruses and using the EV-71 VP1 gene sequence, several
subgenotypes were identified [7,9,16,17]. An unrooted
phylogenetic tree constructed using the whole genome
sequences of all EV-71 and HEV-A viruses had all the EV71 isolates subdivided into three genotypes, A, B (B2, B3
and B4) and C (C2 and C4). The phylogenetic tree was
similar to that constructed using the VP1 gene sequence
with all the HEV-A viruses clustered into their respective
groups (Figure 1a). A similar tree topology depicting the
characteristic grouping of EV-71 and other HEV-A viruses
was obtained using the complete amino acid sequences
(Figure 1b).
At the 5' UTR genomic region, the prototype EV-71, BrCr
branched out together with CV-A2 and CV-A3, and segregated away from the rest of the EV-71 genotypes. Isolates
of EV-71 subgenotype C2 were phylogenetically closer to
CV-A8 and this segregation was supported by a high bootstrap value (Figure 2a). EV-71 genotype B and C4
remained as one cluster, while CV-A4, CV-A14 and two
CV-A16, CV-A16/G10 and Tainan5079 grouped into
another distinct cluster. At the P1 genomic region, no segregation of any EV-71 isolates was observed and all the
other HEV-A isolates were distantly related to one another
(Figure 2b). The tree topology was very similar to that
drawn using complete amino acid sequences (not
shown). Based on the tree drawn using the P1 genomic
region, at least six clustering patterns were observed; (i) all
the EV-71 isolates together with CV-A16, (ii) CV-A2 and
CV-A4, (iii) CV-A3 and CV-A8, (iv) CV-A5 and CV-A12,
(v) CV-A6 and CV-A10 and (vi) CV-A7 and CV-A14. These
patterns received high bootstrap support (> 95%) and corresponded to the neutralization cross-reactivity patterns
observed previously [18].
At the P2 genomic region, EV-71 BrCr clustered with CVA2, CV-A3, CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A12, while the EV-71
subgenotype C2 isolates were phylogenetically closer to
CV-A8 (Figure 2c). EV-71 isolates of subgenotype B2 and
C4 segregated from all other EV-71 and formed a cluster
together with CV-A4, CV-A5, CV-A14 and CV-A16/G10
(Figure 2c). CV-A16 Tainan5079 segregated away from
the prototype CV-A16/G10 and grouped with EV-71 BrCr,
CV-A2, CV-A3, CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A12 (100% bootstrap support, Figure 2c). At the P3 genomic region, the

different EV-71 lineages formed four distinct clusters
together with other HEV-A viruses. Isolates of subgenotype C2 were phylogenetically closer to CV-A8 and this
was supported by a high bootstrap value (100%). Isolates
of subgenotype B3 and C4 isolates clustered with CV-A4,
CV-A14 and CV-A16 and support for the clustering was
also significant (100% bootstrap). EV-71 isolates of subgenotype B2 and B4 were phylogenetically closer to CV-A5,
although this did not receive high bootstrap support
(65%). The genotype A isolate BrCr segregated from all
the recent EV-71 subgenotypes and clustered with CV-A2,
CV-A3, CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A12 (Figure 2d). At the P3
genomic region, isolate CV-A16 Tainan5079 segregated
away from CV-A16/G10 and grouped with EV-71 BrCr,
CV-A2, CV-A3, CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A12 (Figure 2d).
An unrooted phylogenetic tree drawn using only the 3'
UTR showed clustering of EV-71 isolates of subgenotype
of B3 and C4 with CV-A4, CV-A14 and CV-A16 (95%
bootstrap support, not shown). No significant segregation
(< 30% bootstrap support), however, was observed for the
remaining isolates and this was perhaps due to the short
sequence length of the 3' UTR. The clustering of isolates of

subgenotype B3 and C4 with CV-A4, CV-A14 and CV-A16
at the 3' UTR genomic region was consistent with the previous clustering at the P2 and P3 genomic regions. Based
on these results, it appeared that sequences of genes at the
3' half of the EV-71 genome contributed to the multiple
and diverse EV-71 subgenotypes and these genes showed
high similarity to different HEV-A viruses.
Inter-typic recombination between EV-71 and other HEVA viruses
The conflicting tree topologies in the 5' UTR, P2 and P3
genomic regions raised the possibility that the different
EV-71 genotypes contained chimeric genome sequences,
perhaps as a result of a previous recombination event.
Similarity plot analysis performed using consensus
sequences of each EV-71 subgenotype against other EV-71
subgenotypes and HEV-A viruses showed that the P1
genomic region of all the EV-71 genotypes have relatively
high genome sequence similar to each other (81–82%)
with very low sequence similarity (< 50%) to other HEVA viruses. In the P2 and P3 genomic regions, however,
three different similarity patterns for all the EV-71 isolates
were observed. The first pattern grouped EV-71 genotype

These viruses shared relatively high sequence similarity
(83–86%) to each other, and with low sequence similarity
to other EV-71 genotypes (Figure 3a). The second pattern
grouped EV-71 isolates to their respective genotypes. Isolates of genotype B were highly similar to each other for
examples, subgenotype B2, MS87 had high sequence similarity to subgenotype B4 (≥ 88%, 100% bootstrap support, Figure 3b, 3h) and vice versa, subgenotype B4
isolates had high sequence similarity to the subgenotype
B2 (≥ 91%, 100% bootstrap support, Figure 3d, 3i). The
third pattern included EV-71 isolates of subgenotype B3
and C4. These isolates had high sequence similarity to EV71 genotype B, CV-A4, CV-A14 and CV-A16/G10 at P2
genomic region (≥ 81%) and high sequence similarity to
CV-A4, CV-A14 and CV-A16/G10 at P3 genomic region
((≥ 83%), Figure 3c, 3f, 3g). At the P3 genomic region, the

sequence similarity of isolates of subgenotype B3 and C4
to the rest of the EV-71 genotypes was only between 75–
79%. Similarly, EV-71 of subgenotype C2 shared higher
sequence similarity to CV-A8 (≥ 84%) and low sequence
similarity to other existing EV-71 genotypes (≤ 78%, Figure 3e). These phylogenetic segregations received a high
bootstrap support value (Figure 3j). Using a smaller scanning window size of 400 nucleotides, the 5' UTR of subgenotype C2 isolates also showed high sequence similarity
to CV-A8 (Figure 3k).
Evidence of multiple recombination crossover points with
at least five breakpoints delineating the whole genome
was obtained from the similarity plot analysis of EV-71
subgenotype C4 isolate, SHZH98 (Figure 4a). For this
analysis, a smaller scanning window size of 400 nucleotides and sequences of EV-71 isolates were used together

Emergence of EV-71 subgenotypes by recombination with other HEV-A viruses
Emergence of EV-71 subgenotypes by recombination with other HEV-A viruses. Similarity plot analyses were performed using
the full genome sequence of all EV-71 genotypes and subgenotypes. The sequences were queried against all other available
HEV-A viruses. The nucleotide sequence of BrCr, genotype A (a), nucleotide sequence of MS87, subgenotype B2 (b), consensus nucleotide sequence of subgenotype B3 (c), consensus nucleotide sequence of subgenotype B4 (d), consensus nucleotide
sequence of subgenotype C2 (e) SHZH98, subgenotype C4 (f) and SHZH03, subgenotype C4 (g) were used in the similarity
plot analyses. Results from the bootscan analyses indicate the likelihood of clustering of subgenotype B2 isolate, MS87 (h), subgenotype B4 (i) and subgenotype C2 (j) isolates with their respective potential parental isolates. A sliding window of 1000
nucleotides was moved in increments of 20 nucleotides at a time. All gaps were stripped and the sequences were corrected for
multiple substitutions. A transition to tranversion ratio of ten was used and 50% consensus files were used to exclude the
poorly conserved sites. The subgenotype C2 isolates (k) were also queried against other HEV-A viruses using a window size of
400 nucleotides in increments of 20 nucleotides per slide. Bootstrap values of > 70% were used to indicate robust support for
the tree topology [43]. The different HEV-A viruses and EV-71 genotypes are represented by the different line colors.

with CV-A16/G10 as the outgroup virus. This was done to
overcome the phylogeny noise problem. Three genomic
regions nucleotides 1–355, 3634–4148 and 6770–7199
showed 88%, 82% and 84% genome sequence similarity
to EV-71 genotype A, respectively. One genomic region
(nucleotides 378–3632) shared ≥ 88% sequence similarity to EV-71 subgenotype C2 while another genomic
region (nucleotides 4157–6752) had 83% sequence similarity to CV-A16/G10 (Figure 4a). The χ2 values support-

genome sequences within the genome of isolate SHZH98
were maximal at the genomic region spanning nucleotides 378–3632 and 4157–6752, respectively. These
results reflect possible mosaicism of isolate SHZH98
genome involving sequences of EV-71 genotype C structural genes, CV-A16/G10 non-structural genes and the
remnants or perhaps fossilized ancestral sequences of the
prototype EV-71 BrCr, interspersed within the genome. It

Identification of recombinant sequences in the genome of EV-71 subgenotype C4 and CV-A16 Tainan 5079
Identification of recombinant sequences in the genome of EV-71 subgenotype C4 and CV-A16 Tainan 5079. The organization
of the EV-71 genome, the respective crossover breakpoints and potential parental sequences are shown. The upper panel
shows results of a pairwise comparison between SHZH98 (a), SHZH03 (b) and CV-A16 Tainan 5079 (c) genome sequences
against the consensus sequences of EV-71 genotypes A, B2, B4, C2, and CV-A16/G10. The lower panel shows results from the
bootscan analysis which illustrates the likelihood of clustering of the putative recombinants with respect to the parental virus.

from the comparison.
was noted, however, that the BrCr-like sequences were no
longer found in the non-structural regions of the more
recent subgenotype C4 virus isolate, SHZH03 (Figure 4b)
and based on the maximum χ2 values, only two crossover
points were located within nucleotides 156–187 (5' UTR)
and 3755–3802 (2A/2B junction). At the 5' UTR, however, the first 150 nucleotides were still similar to BrCr
sequences but the latter crossover point switched the
genome from subgenotype C2 to CV-A16-like sequences
with no insertion of BrCr sequences. These results provided additional evidence that EV-71 subgenotype C4 isolates may have emerged due to recombination between
subgenotype C2 and CV-A16/G10-like viruses.
Support for inter-typic recombination involving CV-A16
and EV-71 were also obtained from the phylogenetic
investigation of the CV-A16 Tainan5079. Several recombination breakpoints were revealed when the CV-A16
Tainan5079 whole genome sequence was queried against
several potential parental genome sequences (Figure 4c).
A major recombination breakpoint was identified
between nucleotides 3616–3781 within the 2A gene (≥
84% sequence similarity), hence switching the CV-A16
Tainan5079 genome sequences to that of the non-struc-

tural gene sequences of EV-71 BrCr (nucleotides 3781–
7409). Two additional breakpoints were noted between
nucleotides 168–193 and 513–584 of the 5' UTR
sequences switching the genome sequence from CV-A16like to that of EV-71 subgenotype C2 (Figure 4c). Acquisition of the EV-71 subgenotype C2 sequences also resulted
in the CV-A16 Tainan5079 isolate acquiring the EV-71like 5' UTR RNA stem loop structure (not shown). When
the amino acid sequences of the non-structural genes were
examined, at least 45 amino acids were found to be similar to that encoded by the ancestral EV-71 BrCr and not to
CV-A16 G/10. Of these amino acids, 21 amino acid differences occurred within the 3D RNA polymerase gene
alone, suggesting that the gene was very much EV-71-like
than CV-A16 (not shown). These results revealed that the
recently isolated CV-A16 had most of its genome 5' half
including all the structural genes except the 5' UTR consisting of CV-A16-like sequences and the remaining 3' half
of the genome consisting of the supposedly no longer circulating EV-71 genotype A BrCr sequence.

Discussion
Results from the full genome sequence similarity plot

support the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving EV-71 and various HEV-A, including CVA16, the common causal agent of HFMD. All the EV-71
isolates examined had conserved 5' half of the genome,
which consisted of mainly the structural genes including
VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. These structural gene sequences
particularly VP1 and VP4 when used to construct the phylogenetic trees clustered all EV-71 isolates into a unique
clade of its own, away from other HEV-A viruses. This justifies usage of these genes for the molecular identification
of EV isolates [19,20]. It is possible that the structural
genes especially the virus capsid gene, carries genetic
restrictions required to ensure virus receptor recognition,
binding and entry into host cells, and hence remain
highly conserved. CV-A16-like sequences were present
within the genome 3' end of EV-71 subgenotype B3 and
C4. Conversely, EV-71-like sequences were also found
within the genome 3' end of CV-A16 Tainan5079. These
highlight the possible occurrence of recombination events
in the wild between the two common causal agents of
HFMD. This possibility is not difficult to envisage considering that both EV-71 and CV-A16 viruses are known to
co-circulate within the same population and cause a common disease. It is particularly true in parts of the world
where the level of hygiene practices and sanitation are
lacking or less developed, as in these circumstances the
possibility of co-infection is expected to be higher.
Results from the present study also suggest that inter-typic
recombination events occurred between EV-71, CV-A16
and other HEV-A viruses. The incongruent phylogeny patterns observed suggest the possible occurrence of recombination in EV-71 in a similar manner to those previously
reported for a number of enteroviruses [21-27]. It is
reported that most of the current circulating HEV-B
viruses are actually recombinants relative to its prototype
strains isolated in the 1950s [23,27]. Recombination
amongst HEV-A viruses has also been described in CV-A6,
CV-A10 and CV-A12 [18] and a novel group of HEV-A
consisting of EV-76, EV-89, EV-90 and EV-91 [28]. The P1
genomic region of EV-70, a virus that causes acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis is highly similar to EV and rhinovirus. In addition, the P2 and P3 genomic regions are
phylogenetically closer to CV-B and swine vesicular disease virus [29]. Another EV, CV-B5, has its major capsid
proteins that are most closely related to swine vesicular
disease virus, with the 5' and 3' UTR and the P3 genomic
region that are highly similar to the corresponding regions
of other CV-B viruses [30]. Other example of EV with
highly diverse genome sequence origin includes the prototype EV-73 isolated in California in 1988. This EV has
P1 genomic region that is highly similar to echovirus 6,
echovirus 29, echovirus 21 and echovirus 30, with the P2
and P3 genomic regions that share high similarity to CVB3 [31]. Together, these findings reiterate the suggestion

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/74

that recombination is one of the potential mechanisms by
which genetic diversity, is generated in EV-71 and other
HEV-A viruses especially within the non-structural genes
where recombination hot spots are mainly located
[21,23,32-35]. While recombination could occur within
the structural gene region, it perhaps yielded nonviable or
unstable progeny viruses that did not survive and this
could be due to generation of less fit variants with deleterious mutations [36]. Selection of a better fit virus is likely
to have contributed towards the demise of the recombinant EV-71 B3 virus once found prevalent in Peninsula
Malaysia and Sarawak during the 1997 outbreak, Singapore and Japan in 1997 [7,8] and Perth in 1999 [9]. This
virus was shown to replicate less efficiently in comparison
to EV-71 B4 viruses [37], hence it could be the reason why
it was rapidly replaced with EV-71 B4 viruses which
remained endemic in the region for at least up to 2002,
causing infections in Sarawak, Singapore, Taiwan and
Japan [7,8]. The acquisition of a segment of genes from
CV-A16 by EV-71 B3 virus [21,37] could have rendered
the virus less fit to adapt to a new environment especially
the host immunity.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic evidence of possible inter-typic recombination amongst HEV-A viruses including between the two
causal agents of HFMD, EV-71 and CV-A16, were
obtained from analyses using the virus isolates' full
genome sequences. The finding highlights the potential
role of recombination in the emergence of the newer EV71 lineages including those perhaps with varied virulence
and clinical manifestations. Active molecular surveillance
of EV-71 and CV-A16 would help to ensure rapid identification of emergence of any potentially highly virulent EV71 or CV-A16 strains. This is particularly pertinent in
regions where recurring HFMD outbreaks involving the
different HEV-A have occurred.

Methods
RNA isolation and sequencing
Six EV-71 isolates initially identified into the different
genotypes using the 5' UTR sequences were completely
sequenced (Table 1). Purified total RNA of EV-71-infected
Vero cells at either passage two or three were extracted
using the TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Centre, Inc.,
USA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Prior to the amplification, virus genomic RNA was
reverse transcribed to generate cDNA fragments using
oligo dT primers (Promega, USA) and EV-71 specific
reverse primers. A total of eight sets of specific primers
designed based on the published EV-71 sequences were
used to obtain the complete genome sequences (Table 2).
The PCR parameters for all the primer pairs were: 95°C for
3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 54°C for
1 min and 72°C for 1 min and final extension of 5 min at

* EV-71 isolates sequenced in the present study
+ Reference: 2

72°C except annealing at 50°C for EV8 primer pair. The
amplified DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick
Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Germany) and sequenced directly.
In instances when direct sequencing results were poor, the
amplified DNA fragments were ligated into pGEM®-T
cloning vector (Promega, USA) for transformation into
Top 10F' Escherichia coli (Invitrogen, USA). DNA inserts
were sequenced in both directions using the T7 and SP6
primers with ABI PRISM BigDye® Terminator kit and ABI
Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Sequencing analysis
Overlapping DNA sequences with at least 85% sequence
homology and a minimum of 20 overlaps were assembled
into contigs to generate consensus sequences using
Sequencher version 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corporation,
USA). The consensus sequences were aligned against
other EV-71 and HEV-A complete genome sequences
retrieved from the GenBank (Table 1) using Clustal X version 1.81 [38]. All completely sequenced EV-71 isolates

available in the GenBank and the six isolates obtained
from the present study were used for construction of phylogenetic trees. The genetic distance was determined by a
pairwise estimation of the sequences percent divergence.
Positions with gaps were included, transition and transversion ratio was fixed at 10 and corrections for multiple
substitutions were made. These options were chosen to
take into account the ambiguous part of the alignments
and to correct for more than one substitutions happening
at many sites that may underestimate the actual genetic
distances [38]. Phylogenetic trees presented here were
constructed using the neighbour-joining method [39]. All
the unrooted trees were displayed using TreeView version
1.66 [40]. The strength of the phylogenetic trees was estimated by bootstrap analyses using 1000 random samplings. A bootstrap value of ≥ 70% indicates a strong
support for the tree topology [41]. Amino acid sequences
were examined after stripping the 5' UTR and 3' UTR
sequences and consensus sequences for each EV-71 genotype were established.

Recombination analysis
Potential recombination amongst the isolates was determined as previously described [42]. Initially, the neighbour-joining trees were constructed using the various gene
regions of the complete genome. The trees were manually
inspected to determine if there was any shifting of the tree
topology in comparison to that constructed using the
whole genome sequence. The putative recombinant isolate, determined from the shifting of the tree topology,
was then queried against all the existing HEV-A virus
genomes. Initially, all the 31 manually corrected and
aligned complete nucleotide sequences were used. Isolates that shared similar patterns were grouped together to
generate consensus sequences. Recombination was identified when conflicting genome sequence profiles appeared
suggesting acquisition of sequences from a different
parental genotype. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for
each of the putative recombinant sequences using the
neighbour-joining tree algorithm and maximum likelihood distance model and support for the tree topology
was determined by bootscanning analyses that utilized
the bootstrapping procedures with 100 resamplings
[42,43]. Bootstrap values of > 70% were used to indicate
robust support for the tree topology [43]. The crossover

breakpoints were identified when χ2 values were at the
maximum [44].
For the analysis of EV-71 and HEV-A viruses, all gaps were
stripped and the sequences were corrected for multiple
substitutions, transition to tranversion ratio of ten was
used and 50% consensus files were used to exclude the
poorly conserved sites. A sliding window of 1000 nucleotides was moved in increments of 20 nucleotides at a
time and the resulting similarity values were plotted along
the virus genome. Transition and transversion ratio of 10
was chosen based on that used for HEV-A viruses to avoid
underestimation of actual genetic distances [18]. Both the
similarity plot and bootscanning analysis sliding windows were based on that used for HEV-B to increase the
phylogenetic signals and reduce the noise of unrelated
phylogeny [33]. However, for the analysis amongst EV-71,
the sequences were not corrected for multiple substitutions, and a transition to tranversion ratio of two and a
sliding window of 400 nucleotides was used to map the
possible recombination breakpoints [21].
