glycoside hydrolase genes in Brachypodium
distachyon

Abstract
Background: Glycoside hydrolases cleave the bond between a carbohydrate and another carbohydrate, a protein,
lipid or other moiety. Genes encoding glycoside hydrolases are found in a wide range of organisms, from archea
to animals, and are relatively abundant in plant genomes. In plants, these enzymes are involved in diverse
processes, including starch metabolism, defense, and cell-wall remodeling. Glycoside hydrolase genes have been
previously cataloged for Oryza sativa (rice), the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the fastgrowing tree Populus trichocarpa (poplar). To improve our understanding of glycoside hydrolases in plants
generally and in grasses specifically, we annotated the glycoside hydrolase genes in the grasses Brachypodium
distachyon (an emerging monocotyledonous model) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum). We then compared the
glycoside hydrolases across species, at the levels of the whole genome and individual glycoside hydrolase families.
Results: We identified 356 glycoside hydrolase genes in Brachypodium and 404 in sorghum. The corresponding
proteins fell into the same 34 families that are represented in rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar, helping to define a
glycoside hydrolase family profile which may be common to flowering plants. For several glycoside hydrolase
familes (GH5, GH13, GH18, GH19, GH28, and GH51), we present a detailed literature review together with an
examination of the family structures. This analysis of individual families revealed both similarities and distinctions
between monocots and eudicots, as well as between species. Shared evolutionary histories appear to be modified
by lineage-specific expansions or deletions. Within GH families, the Brachypodium and sorghum proteins generally
cluster with those from other monocots.
Conclusions: This work provides the foundation for further comparative and functional analyses of plant glycoside
hydrolases. Defining the Brachypodium glycoside hydrolases sets the stage for Brachypodium to be a grass model
for investigations of these enzymes and their diverse roles in planta. Insights gained from Brachypodium will inform
translational research studies, with applications for the improvement of cereal crops and bioenergy grasses.

Background
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are enzymes that hydrolyze
the bond between a carbohydrate and another compound, such as a second carbohydrate, a protein, or a
lipid [1]. The Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy)
database categorizes GHs into at least 108 different
families, defined by sequence similarity [1,2]. GH genes
are present in a wide range of organisms from archaea
and bacteria to animals and plants. Not surprisingly,

given plants’ photosynthetic capacity and their carbohydrate-rich cell walls, plants contain a relative abundance
of genes for carbohydrate-active enzymes, including
GHs [3]. Although experimental characterizations of
plant GHs are limited, these enzymes have been
assigned a broad array of functions. They are implicated
in the defense against pathogens through attacks on the
carbohydrate components of microbial cell walls, the
mobilization of energy reserves through the degradation
of starch, and hormone signaling through the cleavage
of inactivating glycosyl groups from hormone conjugates, among many other processes [4]. Some plant GHs
are thought to function in the synthesis, remodeling,

and degradation of plant cell walls [4-6]. Developmental
events involving cell-wall loosening or degradation
include cell expansion, seed germination, lateral root
emergence, stomatal formation, xylem differentiation,
pollen tube growth, and fruit ripening [7-10]. The recalcitrance, or resistance to degradation, of cell walls is a
major obstacle to the efficient conversion of plant feedstocks into biofuels [11]. Therefore, in addition to their
roles in planta, GHs capable of modifying cell walls are
also of interest for biofuel applications [5].
Here, we present the annotation and analysis of GH
genes in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon (referred to hereafter as Brachypodium). Brachypodium is a small annual in the grass subfamily the
Pooideae. Brachypodium’s short stature; simple growth
requirements; amenability to genetic transformation;
and compact, sequenced genome make Brachypodium a
suitable research model for its less-tractable grass relatives [12-17]. Members of the grass family, the Poaceae,
provide the majority of the world’s food and feed. Key
crops are included in the subfamilies Ehrhartoideae
(rice), Panicoideae (maize and sorghum), and Pooideae
(wheat, oat, and barley) [18]. Increasingly, grasses are
also being exploited for fuel: Species such as Miscanthus
(Miscanthus × giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) are being investigated as dedicated energy crops
for the production of biofuels [19,20], and crop residues
from maize, rice, and wheat may also be utilized as biomass feedstocks [21]. With carbohydrates as major components of grains, fodder, and cellulosic biofuel
feedstocks, a better understanding of carbohydrateactive enzymes in the grasses is needed.
Genome-wide analyses of GH genes have been previously published for one grass, Oryza sativa (rice) [22],
and two dicotyledonous plants, the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis) [23] and the fastgrowing tree Populus trichocarpa (poplar) [24]. Comparisons between Arabidopsis and rice or Arabidopsis and
poplar have been used to draw conclusions about the
evolutionary history of GHs or differences in the GH
profiles of large plant groups. For example, Arabidopsis
and rice GH28 family members were compared to estimate the number of GH28 genes in the common ancestor of these divergent species [25]. Also, differences in
the number of GHs between Arabidopsis and rice or
poplar have been hypothesized to reflect differences in
the GH profiles of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants (Arabidopsis versus rice) [22] or herbaceous
and woody plants (Arabidopsis versus poplar) [24]. The
sequencing of additional plant genomes allows such
comparisons to be extended to more species, increasing
the robustness of the analyses by reinforcing the conclusions or by identifying over-generalizations from pairwise comparisons. To improve our understanding of

Page 2 of 21

plant GHs generally and grass GHs specifically, we have
annotated both the Brachypodium and Sorghum bicolor
(sorghum) GHs and compared them to the GHs from
rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar. When significant differences between the grasses and eudicots were identified,
we broadened the analysis to include GHs from other
species (maize, wheat, soybean, Medicago, castor bean,
tomato, etc.) with significant, but variable, available
sequence resources. This large-scale analysis will help
guide research into this important group of enzymes.

Methods
Identification of Brachypodium GH genes

Rice and Arabidopsis GH protein sequences were
retrieved from the CAZy database [1,2] and used as
queries in BLASTp searches [26] of the version 1.0 predicted proteome of Brachypodium, including splice variants [27]. Additional files 1 and 2 list rice and
Arabidopsis GH sequences, respectively. The E-value cutoff was set to 10-10. For GH families with no known rice
or Arabidopsis representatives, the Brachypodium predicted proteome was searched using another, usually
microbial, GH sequence selected from the CAZy list.
Using the Pfam database [28,29], each candidate Brachypodium GH was analyzed for the presence of a predicted
GH domain. The Pfam domain predictions are listed in
additional file 3. To further confirm GH family assignments, Brachypodium GH sequences were used as
queries in tBLASTn searches against GenBank entries,
March to May, 2009 [30]. Each gene model was then
individually examined using expressed sequence tag
(EST), Illumina transcriptome, and splice-junction data,
as well as predicted alternative transcripts, for Brachypodium (available at http://www.brachypodium.org) [27,31];
relevant gene models from Arabidopsis and rice (accessible at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/plant/jsf/
brachypodium/index.jsp) [27,32]; and Pfam domain predictions, to decide whether and how a Brachypodium
gene model could be improved through manual modifications. The few Brachypodium GH models which were
modified are indicated with an “m” beside the gene name
in additional file 3. The modifications and modified
sequences are listed in additional file 4.
To search for GH genes possibly omitted from the
version 1.0 annotation, Brachypodium EST sequences,
including Sanger and 454 sequencing reads as well as
the TAU models built from Illumina short reads [27],
were mapped onto the unmasked Brachypodium genome sequence [27] using BLAT [33] with a minimum
identity of 92%. Only the “best match” position was
selected as the genomic location for each query EST
sequence. Gene models were then predicted using
Augustus [34], with the genomic locations of the Brachypodium ESTs as extrinsic evidence. The protein

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

sequences of predicted Brachypodium gene models were
compared with Arabidopsis (version 8 [35]) and rice
genome annotations (version 6 [36]) using BLASTp [37].
For motif analysis, protein sequences were scanned for
domains using blastprodom, coils, gene3d, hmmpanther,
hmmpir, hmmpfam, hmmsmart, hmmtigr, fprintscan,
patternscan, profilescan, and superfamily implemented
in InterPro [38-41]. The resulting candidate GHs were
individually evaluated, as described above, for possible
improvements to the gene models. The GH genes identified in this analysis of the unmasked genome are noted
in additional file 4. Protein sequences for all the Brachypodium GHs are listed in additional file 5.
Identification of sorghum GH genes

Sorghum GHs were identified in the same way, except
that rice, Arabidopsis, and Brachypodium GH protein
sequences were used as queries in BLASTp searches of
the Sbi1_4 version (Sorbi1_GeneModels_Sbi1_4_aa.fasta.
gz) [42] of the predicted proteome of sorghum [43]. In
contrast to the analysis performed for Brachypodium,
sorghum GH gene models were not systematically evaluated for potential errors, nor did we search for GH
genes not contained in the annotation. Additional files 6
and 7 list the sorghum GHs and their protein sequences.
Construction of phylogenetic trees

Full-length GH protein sequences from Arabidopsis,
rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar were used as
the basis for constructing phylogenetic trees. Arabidopsis and rice sequences were accessed through the CAZy
database [1,2]. Brachypodium and sorghum GH
sequences were identified in this study, and poplar GH
sequences were identified via BLASTp searches of the
version 1.1 Populus proteome (proteins.Poptr1_1.JamboreeModels) [44,45], using Arabidopsis and rice GH
proteins as queries. GH sequences from additional species (maize, wheat, soybean, castor bean, grape, tomato,
Medicago, strawberry, etc.) were later incorporated into
selected trees. These additional sequences were either
downloaded from the CAZy database, identified by
querying GenBank [30,46] from November of 2009
through May of 2010 with known GH sequences, or
retrieved from the research literature. Sequences were
aligned by ClustalW [47] using default parameters (a
Gonnet protein weight matrix and gap-opening penalties
of 10 and gap-extending penalties of 0.1 and 0.2 for
pair-wise and multiple alignments, respectively) implemented in the MEGA4 program [48]. The ClustalW
alignments were manually examined and found to be
highly accurate. Thus, no manual adjustments were
made except for the elimination of entire proteins that
appeared to be truncated or otherwise incorrectly annotated. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in MEGA4,

Page 3 of 21

using the Neighbor-Joining method [49] and 1,000 bootstrap replicates [50] for each analysis. Pairwise deletion
was employed to address alignment gaps and missing
data.

Results and discussion
Identification of Brachypodium and sorghum GHs

To identify candidate Brachypodium GHs, BLASTp
searches [26] of the version 1.0 Brachypodium predicted
proteome [27] were performed using rice and Arabidopsis GH sequences as queries. The resulting candidates
were compared against the Pfam protein families database [28] to detect protein domains. Brachypodium proteins without predicted GH domains were removed
from consideration, with the following exceptions: one
Brachypodium GH33 and two GH95 members were
considered to be GHs because the Pfam database does
not contain a specific entry for either a GH33 or a
GH95 domain. In these cases, we relied on the Brachypodium proteins’ high sequence similarity to rice and
Arabidopsis family members. Two of the five Brachypodium GH27 family members lacked a significant match
to a Pfam GH domain but were nevertheless considered
to be GHs because they are highly similar to rice and
Arabidopsis GH27 family members which also lack a
predicted Pfam GH domain. After modification of the
gene model, one additional gene (Bradi1g27870) was
determined to encode a GH16 protein. These analyses
identified 340 Brachypodium GH genes. Since the version 1.0 annotation, based on a repeat-masked Brachypodium genomic sequence, was missing genes in other
families, such as the F-box family [27], we also searched
for Brachypodium GH genes in the unmasked genome,
using an annotation pipeline based on transcriptome
expression evidence as well as a protein domain search.
This secondary search yielded an additional 16 Brachypodium GHs. In total, 356 Brachypodium genes in 34
GH families were identified; the full list is given in additional file 3. Protein sequences for the Brachypodium
GHs are listed in additional file 5.
The gene models for all of the Brachypodium GHs
were examined for possible improvements. Of the 356
GH gene models, 14 (3.9%) were modified based on criteria such as EST data and gene models from other species. Additional file 4 details the modifications and
additions made to version 1.0 of the Brachypodium genome annotation. Nearly 80% of the Brachypodium GH
genes were supported by EST and/or Illumina transcriptome data (additional file 3) [27]. The limited changes
compared to the version 1.0 annotation and the large
proportion of genes with expression support testify to
the high quality of the initial genome annotation.
Approximately 84% of identified Brachypodium GHs
had good matches (E-value ≤ 10-100 ) in both rice and

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

Arabidopsis (additional file 3). Another 14% of Brachypodium GHs matched both rice and Arabidopsis GH
sequences with an E-value ≤ 10-10 . Only 7 Brachypodium GHs - in the GH5, GH16, and GH18 families were good matches to rice GHs but lacked clear Arabidopsis orthologs (additional file 3). As discussed below,
these GH5 and GH18 sequences represent major clades
which are missing in Arabidopsis. No Brachypodium
GHs were found outside the families represented in rice
and Arabidopsis, despite our queries using GHs from
other organisms.
A similar approach was used to identify sorghum
GHs: rice, Arabidopsis, and Brachypodium GH protein
sequences were used as queries in BLASTp searches of
the sorghum predicted proteome [43], and the resulting
candidates were analyzed for the presence of Pfam-predicted GH domains [28]. Sorghum was found to have
404 GHs in the same 34 families that are represented in
Arabidopsis, rice, and Brachypodium (Figure 1 and additional file 8). Additional files 6 and 7 include the full list
of sorghum GHs and their corresponding protein
sequences.
Comparisons to Arabidopsis and rice GHs

To compare GH profiles across plant species, we
retrieved the numbers of GH family members in both
Arabidopsis and rice from the CAZy database [1,2]. The
number of gene family members was updated as follows:
one putative GH28 gene (At1g23470) was removed from
the Arabidopsis list, because At1g23470 is annotated as
a pseudogene in the most recent, TAIR9, release of the

Arabidopsis genome [35]. The number of rice genes in
four families was reduced because several genes were
listed multiple times. The GH5 gene Os10g0370800 was
listed three times, the GH16 gene Os08g0240500 twice,
and the GH17 gene Os01g0947000 twice. Two CAZy
entries for the rice GH32 family [GenBank: AAD10239.1
and AAK72492.2] correspond to genes already included
in the list; we therefore considered these entries to be
duplicates. Also, two fragmentary rice sequences [GenBank: BAA01617.1 and BAG87724.1] were removed
from the GH13 and GH36 families, respectively.
Overall, Brachypodium and sorghum have similar
numbers of GHs as rice and Arabidopsis. The 356 GHs
in Brachypodium represent 1.4% of the 25,532 predicted
protein-coding genes [27], while the 404 GHs in sorghum correspond to 1.5% of the 27,640 protein-coding
genes [43]. This is in comparison to 390 GHs in Arabidopsis (1.4% of the 27,379 TAIR9 protein-coding genes)
[35] and 414 GHs in rice (1.4% of the 30,192 RAP2 protein-coding genes) [51,52].
Despite the global similarity in the total number of
GHs, the number of members in individual GH families
varies widely. For Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and
sorghum, the number of GHs in each family is shown
graphically in Figure 1 and numerically in additional file
8. Some families - e.g. GH2, 9, 10, 37, 43, 77, and 100 contain similar numbers of members in each of the four
species. In other families - e.g. GH1, 5, 13, 18, 19, 28,
and 51 - the number of members differs by up to fourfold (Figure 1 and additional file 8). Previous studies
have detected some of these differences. For example,

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

the GH28 family of polygalacturonases is larger in Arabidopsis (66 genes) than rice (41 genes); conversely, the
GH18 family of chitinases is much larger in rice (34
genes) than Arabidopsis (10 genes) [22] (Figure 1 and
additional file 8). However, with such pairwise comparisons of species, it has been difficult to evaluate whether
differences represent variation between major groups,
such as dicots and monocots, or merely between the
two species examined. For many GH families, the Brachypodium and sorghum data are largely consistent with
those for rice. The identification of 41 GH28 members
in Brachypodium and 38 in sorghum supports the idea
that grasses contain fewer polygalacturonases than eudicots do. In other cases, such as the GH18 family, the
trend breaks down: Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium,
and sorghum have 10, 34, 14, and 25 GH18 genes,
respectively (Figure 1 and additional file 8). This observation highlights the danger of making large taxonomic
generalizations based on pairwise comparisons.
Poplar GHs

The unusually high number of GH genes reported for
poplar (600 genes) [24] complicates global comparisons
with other species; some of the poplar gene models may
actually be annotation artifacts arising from the heterozygous nature of the large, complex, and duplicated
poplar genome. Whereas multiple rounds of computational and manual improvements have resulted in highquality Arabidopsis and rice gene models [35,36,52], the
sorghum and poplar models are “first drafts” derived
from computational predictions, gene homology, and
expression data [43,45]. Future refinements of the sorghum and poplar gene models may therefore alter the
number of GHs, as well as the corresponding protein
sequences, in these species. In fact, while cataloging carbohydrate-active enzymes in poplar, Geisler-Lee et al.
found that some models were fragmentary and should
be merged into larger genes [24].
For detailed analyses of specific GH families, poplar
sequences were retrieved via BLASTp searches of the
version 1.1 Populus proteome with Arabidopsis and rice
GH proteins as queries. The searches yielded non-identical, although largely overlapping, sets of poplar GH
candidates. For example, poplar reportedly has 22 GH5
family members, identified via BLAST searches using all
entries in the CAZy database [24]. Our searches of the
poplar proteome using the Arabidopsis GH sequences
identified 17 poplar GH5s; searches using the rice GHs
identified an additional 5 poplar GH5 proteins, for a
total of 22. These results are consistent with the finding
of Tuskan et al. that almost 12% of predicted poplar
genes did not have clear orthologs in Arabidopsis [45].
Poplar was not known to have any members in the
GH33 and GH85 families [24]. Although the GH33 and

Page 5 of 21

GH85 families are small, with one to two members each
in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum (Figure 1 and additional file 8), it was surprising that poplar
would completely lack representatives of these families.
Interestingly, our searches identified one poplar GH33
gene (Poptr825914) and three poplar GH85 genes
(Poptr226914, Poptr226918, and Poptr419935). (See the
additional file 9 for the full gene names and sequences.)
The poplar GH33 was an especially good match - with
an E-value of 10-147 - to the rice GH33, Os07g0516000.
The Pfam database does not list a specific GH33
domain, and, correspondingly, Poptr825914 and the
GH33 family members in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum do not have any significant matches
to Pfam GH domains. However, analyzing the
Poptr825914 protein with the InterProScan feature of
the InterPro database [40] identified a sialidase domain,
which is characteristic of the GH33 family [2]. The
three poplar GH85 proteins, Poptr226914, Poptr226918,
and Poptr419935, were all retrieved as matches to Arabidopsis and rice GH85 sequences, and all contain a
characteristic, Pfam-predicted Glycosyl hydrolase family
85 domain.
The identification of GH33 and GH85 members in
poplar means that poplar has the same GH families
which are present in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium,
and sorghum. The presence of these families in five,
diverse flowering plant species, combined with the
apparent absence of plant sequences from other families,
suggests that these 34 GH families are common to
angiosperms.
Phylogenetic analyses

To further elucidate the relationships between plant
GHs, we selected several families for phylogenetic analyses. Full-length protein sequences from five species Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar served as the basis for building phylogenetic trees. Making the trees with full-length sequences allowed all the
information contained in the protein sequences to contribute to the phylogenetic placement of the genes. To
be sure that this overall evolutionary history agreed with
the GH domain alone, we also constructed trees based
only on the GH domains (not shown). For the GH18,
GH19, GH5, GH28, and GH13 families, the domainonly trees had the same structure as the trees based on
the full-length sequences. For the GH51 family, the
bootstrap values in the domain-only tree were too low
to be informative for distinguishing the highly-similar
sequences. Thus, in this case, the sequence outside the
GH domain was crucial for teasing out the relationship
between the proteins. To enrich the investigation,
sequences from other organisms were included for some
of the GH families. These evolutionary analyses,

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

performed with the MEGA4 program [48], emphasize
comparisons between eudicots and grasses, especially
the model plants Arabidopsis and Brachypodium.
The GH18 and 19 families

Chitin, a long-chain polymer of beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) linkages, is the second-most-abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. It forms the
major component of fungal cell walls and is also found
in the exoskeletons of insects and shells of mollusks
[53]. Chitinases are enzymes that break down chitin by
hydrolyzing this polysaccharide into simple sugars, and
chitinolytic enzymes have been identified in viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoan parasites, insects, animals, and
plants [1,30]. Chitin is not synthesized in plants. However, expression of several plant chitinases is induced by
pathogen challenge, and these proteins make up five of
the seventeen families of plant pathogenesis-related (PR)
proteins: PR2, PR3, and PR4 are GH19 family members,
and PR8 and PR11 are GH18 family members [4,54].
This implicates chitinases as key plant-defense proteins.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that chitinases
have both antifungal and antibacterial activities [55-61].
Environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, frost,
wounding and osmotic pressure also can induce chitinase expression in plants. Other studies suggest that
chitinases likely play a role in growth, development, and
the generation or degradation of signaling molecules
[62-66]. Nod factors produced by nitrogen-fixing soil
bacteria include chitin oligomers of four or five N-acetyl
glucosamine residues that can be cleaved and inactivated
by specific plant chitinases, revealing a role for these
proteins in symbiosis. It is not surprising, then, that
plant genomes contain a large number of chitinase
genes, the majority of which are classified in the GH18
and GH19 families. Together these two families comprise 24 genes in Brachypodium, 42 in sorghum, 50 in
rice, 24 in Arabidopsis and 56 in poplar (additional files
8 and 9).
The GH18 family

Despite shared chitinolytic activity, the GH18 and GH19
families do not share sequence similarity. The two
families are clearly distinguished by their sequences and
three-dimensional structures, indicating they are derived
from different ancestral genes. The GH18 and GH19
plant chitinases are further divided into seven classes (IVII) based on amino acid sequence and the presence or
absence of auxiliary domains flanking a catalytic domain
[67,68]. The GH18 family includes the class III and class
V chitinases that are more closely related to fungal
enzymes involved in morphogenesis (class III) and bacterial exochitinases (class V) than they are to GH19 proteins [67]. The GH18 domain is an eight-stranded b/a

Page 6 of 21

barrel with a pronounced active-site cleft at the C-terminal end of the b-barrel and a conserved DXXDXDXE
motif [69,70]. GH18 class III chitinases can have dual
lysozyme and chitinase functions, and these dual-function proteins tend to be better-targeted at murein in
bacterial cell walls than the other classes of chitinases
[4]. The GH18 family also includes a number of “inactivated” chitinases which represent evolutionary adaptations that recruit the ancient and stable GH18 scaffold
to novel functions. These include GH18 xylanase inhibitor proteins (XIPs) that lack chitinolytic activity but
have adapted a new defense mechanism targeting the
pathogen-produced GH10 and GH11 xylanases that
degrade arabinoxylans in plant cell walls [69,71]. Nodulins, involved in interactions with symbiotic bacteria, as
well as narbonins and concanavalin B, seed proteins
lacking conserved catalytic residues, also group within
the GH18 family [67,69].
A phylogenetic analysis of the GH18 proteins from 23
plant species is presented in Figure 2 and additional file
10. The Neighbor-Joining tree was generated using 1000
bootstrap replicates and includes 8 monocot (Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, bamboo, tulip, bread wheat, durum
wheat, and maize) and 15 eudicot (Arabidopsis, poplar,
sugar beet, longleaf ironwood, jelly fig, strawberry, soy
bean, white lupine, Medicago, a legume, winged bean,
ginseng, adzuki bean, cowpea, and grape) species. For
the scientific names of species in this tree, see additional
file 11. Sequences within this family resolve into four
distinct, well-supported clades. The class V chitinases
group into a single clade that shares little sequence
similarity with the class III proteins. Monocot and eudicot sequences group separately within the class V clade.
Brachypodium and rice each have one representative in
this group and sorghum has two; interestingly, class V
chitinases have not been reported in maize [55]. Compared to these monocots, the eudicots Arabidopsis and
poplar have greater representation in the class V clade.
This is explained by local duplications resulting in
expansion of class V chitinases in these species.
GH18 class III chitinases are divided between the
remaining three clades of the tree. Initially, we aligned
sequences from Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, Arabidopsis, and poplar, and in the analysis of these data, two
clades comprised only grass sequences (data not shown).
These sequences were used to query the NCBI (National
Center for Biotechnology Information) non-redundant
protein sequence database [30] in order to expand the
number of species represented. The retrieved proteins
from both monocot and eudicot species were used in
combination with the original set to construct a new
tree. The majority of the retrieved eudicot sequences
aligned with the sequences in the class IIIa group that
contains the only Arabidopsis class III protein. In this

Figure 2 The GH18 chitinase family. The tree includes GH18 proteins from 23 species: Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum,
and poplar, as well as sequences from 13 other eudicots (sugar beet, longleaf ironwood, jelly fig, strawberry, soybean, white lupine, Medicago, a
legume, winged bean, ginseng, adzuki bean, cowpea, and grape) and 5 other monocots (bamboo, bread wheat, wild tulip, durum wheat, and
maize). The tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The percent of bootstrap replicates
supporting each major branch is indicated. Distances are proportional to the number of amino-acid substitutions per site. Sequences from
eudicots are indicated in blue (Arabidopsis with filled triangles, other eudicots with open triangles); sequences from monocots are indicated in
red (Brachypodium with filled circles, other monocots with open circles). For clarity, gene names or accession numbers are shown only for
Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. Chitinase class designations are listed by each clade and specific XIPs are labeled. For complete branch labels and
bootstrap values, see additional file 10.

clade, the monocot and dicot sequences are mixed,
rather than forming two distinct groupings as seen for
the class V proteins (Figure 2).
The class IIIb clade in Figure 2 was proposed by
Suzukawa et al. (2003) [72] in studies of a tulip-bulb
chitinase and was also used by Shoresh and Harmon
(2008) [55] to describe a group of maize GH18 proteins.
In our original tree, this group contained only monocot
sequences; yet it is closely related to the GH18 narbonin
and nodulin-like proteins. Narbonin is a globulin protein
from the eudicot Vicia narbonensis that lacks conserved
chitinase catalytic residues and enzymatic activity. In

legumes such as fava bean and soybean, nodulins are
induced in response to signals generated by symbiotic
bacteria. These are eudicot species, and therefore, it was
apparent that we needed to expand our dataset to get a
better understanding of the proteins that cluster with
the narbonin and nodulin proteins and the neighboring
class IIIb group. A BLASTp search retrieved a variety of
eudicot sequences that group within the IIIb clade. Soresh and Harmon had compared maize sequences only
to rice, tulip, and Arabidopsis and concluded that class
IIIb is monocot-specific, because the only dicot considered, Arabidopsis, did not have a representative in the

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

IIIb group. Our original tree included poplar, which also
lacks a class IIIb protein. However, the presence of several eudicot class IIIb sequences in our expanded tree
(Figure 2 and additional file 10) illustrates the need for
caution when drawing conclusions based on data from a
few species. The narbonin and nodulin nucleotide
sequences do not encode predicted signal peptides. In
their analysis of one tulip, two rice, and three maize
class IIIb proteins, Soresh and Harmon reported that
these sequences also lack signal peptides. We used Signal P and Sig-Pred software to evaluate signal peptide
predictions for the Brachypodium and sorghum GH18
proteins and found that the Bradi3g26840, Bradi3g26850, and Sb5g006880 sequences in the class IIIb
clade lack predicted signal peptides. However, the class
IIIb proteins Bradi3g26810 and Sb01g21920, as well as
all of the other Brachypodium and sorghum GH18 proteins, do contain predicted signal peptides.
The remainder of the class III chitinases form a distinct clade that remains monocot-specific even after the
addition of BLASTp-retrieved monocot and eudicot
sequences to the phylogenetic analysis. These proteins
have been grouped with the class IIIa chitinases; however, they can be clearly distinguished from the class
IIIa chitinases by sequence and functional characteristics. This distinct clade represents a group of xylanase
inhibitor proteins (XIPs) that have lost chitinolytic activity and have gained the ability to inhibit the GH10 and
GH11 xylanases used by pathogens to attack plant cell
walls [69,71]. XIPs for which reports have been published, wheat XIP-I and XIP-III [73], wheat XIP-RI and
XIP-RII [56], and rice RIXI [69], are labeled in Figure 2.
In our analysis, the clade containing these sequences is
referred to as class IIIa-XIP. The class IIIa-XIP chitinases have a modified version of the DXXDXDXE motif
that is required for catalytic activity. In XIPs, the third
D is usually mutated to an aromatic residue (F or Y). In
addition, these proteins contain two mutations introducing R residues at positions C-terminal to the
DXXDXDXE motif that can form salt bridges with the
conserved E residue. This interaction blocks the chitinbinding site, preventing chitinase activity [56,69]. The
sorghum and maize proteins within the clusters containing RIXI, XIP-RI, XIP-RII, and XIPI all contain the
characteristic XIP mutations. All of the Brachypodium
sequences within the class IIIa-XIP clade also have these
changes, suggesting that they may function as XIPs,
whereas the Brachypodium class IIIa and IIIb sequences
do not contain these mutations (Figure 3). Bradi4g09420
contains the two R mutations, but in place of the active
site mutation, it has a large deletion through the chitinbinding domain, entirely eliminating the DXXDXDXE
motif in this protein. This deletion is unique among the
proteins included in the class IIIa-XIP clade. The cluster

Page 8 of 21

of the class IIIa-XIP clade that does not contain a Brachypodium representative also appears to consist of XIP
proteins. Most of the rice, sorghum, and maize
sequences within this group have the three described
XIP substitutions; however, a few sequences have variations.
The
Os05g0247100,
Os05g0247500,
Os05g0248200 sequences have an additional N substitution in place of the first D in the catalytic motif.
Os11g002200 has an A instead of the first R, and
Os05g0247100, Os05g0247500, Os05g0248200 each
have a K instead of the second R (Figure 3 and data not
shown). The considerable number of sequences for each
species represented in this clade is mainly explained by
a large number of local duplications of class IIIa-XIP
genes. The evolution of XIP proteins from class III chitinases appears to represent a successful functional adaptation specific to monocots, and, in this analysis,
particularly for grasses.
The functional adaptations within the GH18 family
highlight the challenges of assigning protein functions
based solely on sequence similarities. Numerous studies
have been performed to identify the targets of class III
chitinases. Chitinases have different substrate specificities, activities, reaction mechanisms, and expression patterns. Activity and substrate specificity are diverse even
among identical classes of enzymes. For example, two of
the rice class IIIb proteins, Os10g0416500 and
Os10g0416800, have highly similar sequences. Yet
Os10g0416500 is expressed in response to pathogen
challenge and has substantial antifungal activity, whereas
Os10g0416800 is expressed in response to environmental stresses [59]. Through the comparison of increasing
numbers of chitinase sequences, however, new groups
emerge, such as the class IIIa-XIP proteins, and functional predictions based on sequence patterns begin to
become possible.
The GH19 family

The GH19 family is found primarily in plants, but members have been identified in a number of bacteria and in
nematodes [1]. Analyses of GH19 proteins reveal structural similarities with lysozymes, despite a lack of significant sequence similarity, and suggest that these two
enzyme groups arose from a common ancestor originating before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes
[30]. The chitinase classes represented in the GH19
family (I, II, IV, VI, and VII) are distinguished by characteristic small deletions in the sequence and by the
presence of auxiliary domains flanking the main catalytic
domain, including a cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain
(CRD or CBD), a proline- and glycine-rich hinge region,
and a carboxy-terminal extension (CTE) [55,67,74].
A phylogenetic analysis of the GH19 proteins from
five plant species is presented in Figure 4 and additional

Figure 3 Alignment of GH18 class III chitinase sequences. Forty sequences were selected from the one hundred fourteen class IIIa, IIIa-XIP,
and IIIb sequences used to construct the GH18 family phylogenetic tree. The selected proteins include the experimentally verified wheat (Ta)
and rice (Os) proteins. All of the Brachypodium (Bradi) class III proteins were included in the alignment along with sorghum (Sb) and rice
proteins selected to represent branches of the class III clades. The sequences were aligned using the Clustal W method in MegAlign 5.05
(DNAStar software package). The region presented includes the DXXDXDXE motif (within the blue box) required for chitinolytic activity and two
residues (within the red boxes) that in most of the IIIa-XIP sequences contain amino acids (R or K) capable of forming salt bridges with the E in
the DXXDXDXE motif. The class IIIa-XIP protein Bradi4g09429 contains a large N-proximal deletion, and the first amino acid shown is at position
33 in the sequence. The position of the first amino acid shown ranges from positions 139 to 159 for the other class IIIa-XIP proteins, from
positions 139 to150 for class IIIa, and from positions 125 to 149 for class IIIb.

file 12. The Neighbor-Joining tree includes three grass
(Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum) and two eudicot
(Arabidopsis and poplar) species. The sequences within
this family are resolved into four distinct, well-supported
clades (Figure 4). We used the designated chitinase
classes for the Arabidopsis GH19 proteins [35,75] and
the sequence alignment generated for this tree to assign
chitinase classes to Brachypodium proteins with similar
arrangements of auxiliary domains and deletion patterns.
Class designations for the Brachypodium and Arabidopsis
sequences are indicated by Roman numerals within Figure 4. Three of the clades contain sequences primarily
from a single chitinase class, II, IV, or VI, whereas one
clade contains sequences mixed between classes I and II.
Sequences for classes I and II, although similar, are distinguished by the absence of the CRD and the CTE and a
small deletion in the catalytic domain in the class II

proteins. Placement in previous phylogenetic analyses
also suggests that class II proteins have polyphyletic origins, arising multiple times within class I lineages [67].
Two of the Brachypodium sequences in this clade have
notable differences from the classic representatives of
their assigned classes. Bradi2g26000 has a large CRD
containing 16 cysteine residues, twice the usual number,
and may represent two tandem CRDs. Bradi1g29880
looks like a class II protein but lacks the signal peptide
usually found in this class. One class VII protein,
At3g47540, resides within the class IV clade. In addition
to the two deletions in the catalytic domain that are characteristic of the class IV proteins, this protein also lacks
CRD and CTE regions. Previously, classes II and IV were
reported to be found mainly in dicots [67]. However, the
three grass species included in this analysis, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum, each have representatives in the

Figure 4 The GH19 chitinase family. The tree includes GH19 proteins from five species: Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum,
and poplar. Tree construction is as in Figure 2. Sequences from eudicots are indicated in blue (Arabidopsis with filled triangles, poplar with open
triangles); sequences from grasses are indicated in red (Brachypodium with filled circles, rice and sorghum with open circles). For clarity, gene
names or accession numbers are shown only for Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. Chitinase class designations are listed by each clade and are

clades containing these class II and IV chitinases, suggesting that monocot sequences have been heretofore
under-represented in these classes. There are few examples of class VI and VII proteins in the literature, and we
identified only one class VI and no class VII proteins
amongst the Brachypodium chitinases. Class VI chitinases have an arrangement of auxiliary domains similar
to class I proteins but contain a CRD with fewer cysteine
residues than the class I domain, as well as variations in
the hinge and CTE regions. One of the Arabidopsis proteins designated class VI in this analysis, At1g05850, earlier was reported to be a class VII protein [75]. However,
At1g05850 lacks the catalytic-domain deletions characteristic of the class IV and VII proteins. As more
sequences from additional species are added to such analyses, a clearer picture of the profiles of these families
emerges.

Each clade of the GH19 family contains at least one
representative from all five species analyzed; however, the
grass and eudicot sequences group as separate clusters
within the clades (Figure 4 and additional file 12). The
difference in the number of genes between species is primarily due to localized, tandem duplications of sequences
within the two larger clades. Three good examples are
the five Arabidopsis genes (At2g43580, At2g43590,
At2g43600, At2g43610, and At2g43620); six sorghum
genes (Sb06g021210, Sb06g021220, Sb06g021230,
Sb06g021240, Sb06g021250, and Sb06g021260); and four
poplar genes (Poptr249950, Poptr547380, Poptr249966,
and Poptr826290) present in the class IV clade. Additionally, the clade with mixed class I and II sequences shows
expansions in two Brachypodium regions (Bradi1g29880
and Bradi1g29890, as well as Bradi2g47190 and
Bradi2g47210); one poplar region (Poptr557015,

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

Poptr557013, Poptr649160, Poptr72170, Poptr 72160,
Poptr649163, and Poptr200449); and two rice regions
(Os05g0399300, Os05g0399400, and Os05g0399700, as
well as Os06g726100 and Os06g726200). One possible
explanation for this observation is proposed by Bishop et
al. [76] as a result of their analyses of the PR proteins
represented by the GH19 class I chitinases [67]. These
researchers observed that the GH19 proteins disproportionately accumulate adaptive mutations in the active-site
cleft. This unusual pattern of mutation is not shared by
chitinases of the GH18 family, suggesting that adaptive
functional modifications rapidly emerge as a result of
direct pathogen defense against plant chitinolytic activity.
This plant-pathogen coevolution of GH19 genes could
be facilitated by the observed gene duplications: Mutations in the additional gene copies could confer adaptive advantages in the face of attacks by a variety of
pathogens.
The GH5 family

The GH5 family, previously named cellulase family A,
includes plant-cell-wall-modifying enzymes such as cellulases, mannanases, and b-glucosidases [1,2,4,5]. The
enzymatic activities of a few plant GH5 members have
been characterized. One of these is HvMAN1, a mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) from barley (Hordeum vulgare) [77].
Purified from 10-day-old seedlings, HvMAN1 exhibited
relatively high rates of hydrolysis on moderately substituted galactomannan and unsubstituted glucomannan
substrates [77]. Another mannanase, LeMAN4a,
expressed in ripenning tomato (Solanum lycopersicon,
syn. Lycopersicon esculentum), was also cloned, its endob-D-mannanase activity confirmed in an in vitro assay,
and its structure solved [78,79]. RNA-mediated suppression of LeMAN4a expression slightly increased the firmness of ripening tomato fruits, suggesting that
LeMAN4a plays a supporting role in fruit softening [80].
The rice GH5BG gene (Os10g0370500) encodes a GH5
family b-glucosidase that is expressed in the shoots of
seedlings and leaf sheaths of adult plants [81]. Salt
stress, submergence, and the stress hormones methyl
jasmonate and abscisic acid induced the expression of
GH5BG, hinting at a possible connection between
GH5BG-mediated cell-wall remodeling and responses to
environmental conditions [81].
To obtain a more complete picture of the plant GH5
family, GH5 sequences from other plants (barley, maize,
wheat, tomato, coffee, soybean, apple, peach, tomato,
grape, etc.) and from green algae (Micromonas and
Ostreococcus species) were retrieved from the CAZy
database or, in the case of HvMAN1, from the research
literature. (For a full list of species, see additional file
11.) These protein sequences were combined with the
Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar

Page 11 of 21

GH5 sequences to build an evolutionary tree. The plant
GH5 proteins formed three major clades, A, B, and C,
with high bootstrap support (Figure 5 and additional file
13). The mannanases HvMAN1 and LeMAN4a are in
clade A, while the b-glucosidase GH5BG is in clade B
(Figure 5). Initially, clade B appeared to contain only
monocot sequences and one sequence from a gymnosperm, sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). However, tBLASTn
searches of GenBank using the two Brachypodium clade
B representatives yielded additional members from dicotyledonous species: poplar, castor bean, tomato, and
grape (Figure 5). For complete information on species
included in the tree and branch labels, see additional
files 11 and 13. Strikingly, the Arabidopsis GH5 proteins
fall within Clades A and C, but not B (Figure 5). Performing tBLASTn searches of the Arabidopsis transcriptome (TAIR9) [35] using the Brachypodium and eudicot
Clade B members as queries yielded no Clade B
matches, confirming the lack of an Arabidopsis Clade B
representative. Sequences from green algae (Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Ostreococcus tauri, and Micromonas)
cluster with clades A and B with 100% and 98% bootstrap support, respectively (Figure 5). This finding suggests that both the A and B clades arose early in
evolution. The absence of Arabidopsis from clade B, a
group spanning diverse plant species, underscores the
point that, although Arabidopsis is a powerful tool, it is
not sufficient for studying all aspects of plants. Multispecies comparisons are needed to form a comprehensive picture.
The GH28 family

The GH28 family includes polygalacturonases, which
act on pectin [1,2,4]. Pectin consists of carbohydrate
polymers (e.g. homogalacturonans and rhamnogalacturonans) rich in galacturonic acid [82]. Pectin is a major
component of the middle lamella connecting adjacent
plant cells to each other [9,82]. In eudicots such as
Arabidopsis, pectin is also abundant in primary cell
walls, where it forms a matrix surrounding the network of cellulose and hemicellulose [82,83]. GH28
polygalacturonases have been implicated in the reduction of cell-to-cell adhesion and the remodeling of cell
walls, contributing to developmental processes such as
pollen development, organ abscission, and fruit ripening [4,9,84]. For instance, loss-of-function mutations in
the Arabidopsis GH28 family member At3g07970 also known as QUARTET2 (QRT2) - result in the production of tetrad pollen, caused by the failure of the
four microspores to separate following meiosis [84,85].
QRT2 and the related genes ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE1 and 2
(ADPG1 and ADPG2) are all involved in anther dehiscence, a cell-separation process which allows for pollen

release [84]. QRT2 and ADPG2 (At2g41850) both contribute to floral-organ shedding [84,86]; ADPG1
(At3g57510) and ADPG2 together promote the dehiscence of seed pods [84]. In vitro biochemical assays
have confirmed the polygalacturonase activity of
ADPG1, ADPG2, and the protein encoded by another
GH28 family member, At1g48100 [84]. Twenty years
ago, in tomato, it was shown that suppressing the
expression of an endogenous polygalacturonase with
antisense RNA inhibited the degradation of pectin during fruit ripening [87,88]. Since then, the importance
of polygalacturonase activity in the ripening of many
other fruits has also been demonstrated [9].
Both tandem and whole-genome duplications have
contributed to the presence of a relatively large number
of GH28 genes in Arabidopsis compared to rice [22,25].
The type I cell walls of dicots contain much higher levels
of pectin than the type II walls of grasses [89], and it has
been proposed that the increased number of GH28s in
Arabidopsis reflects a greater need for pectin-active
enzymes [22]. Consistent with this hypothesis, maize
(Zea mays) was recently reported to have 16 fewer GH28
genes than Arabidopsis [90], even though the maize genome is an order of magnitude larger and contains ~19%
more protein-coding genes [91,92]. Our identification of
41 GH28 family members in Brachypodium and 38 in
sorghum reinforces the conclusion that grasses have
smaller numbers of polygalacturonase genes (Figure 1
and additional file 8). Although small compared to Arabidopsis, the GH28 family in each of the grasses still consists of a substantial number of genes, possibly reflecting
enzymatic functions associated with the pectin-rich middle lamella and the role of pectin during cell division.
To investigate the evolutionary history of the GH28
family, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium,
sorghum, poplar, and maize (Figure 6 and additional file
14). The maize sequences were as identified by Penning
et al. [90], except that the proteins encoded by
AC210013.4 and AC231180.2 were omitted from the
analysis, because they did not contain Pfam-predicted
GH domains. For ease of reference, groups of GH28
proteins are labeled with the designations used by Penning et al. for Arabidopsis, rice, and maize [90]. These
labels are included here to simplify comparisons across
studies and do not necessarily correlate precisely with
the clades of the six-species tree shown in Figure 6. For
instance, while Group A has 100% bootstrap support,
Group E as identified by Penning et al. [90] is split into
two clades in our phylogenetic tree and is more appropriately regarded as part of the larger E/F/H clade (Figure 6 and additional file 14). The proteins encoded by
QRT2, ADPG1 and ADPG2 fall into group D and the
At1g48100-encoded protein into group C (Figure 6).

Page 13 of 21

As has been noted previously [90], the increased number of GH28 genes in Arabidopsis appears to be due to
expansion within groups, rather than the creation of
entirely novel, eudicot-specific groups (Figure 6). For
example, Group G and the less-cohesive Group E contain noticeably more Arabidopsis than Brachypodium
members. There are, nevertheless, eudicot- and grassspecific clades; these include the eudicot-specific Group
F and the grass-specific Group H recognized by Penning
et al. [90] (Figure 6). In our analysis, Groups F and H
have strong bootstrap support, 99 and 100%, respectively. These two groups also form part of a larger
Group E/F/H, which is supported by 96% of 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Figure 6 and additional file 14).
A tree constructed from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize
sequences had indicated that Group B is “Arabidopsis
only” [90]. In our larger tree with additional sequences
from Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar, Group B was
loosely clustered (50% bootstrap support) and contained
one GH28 each from Brachypodium and sorghum (Figure 6 and additional file 14). Additionally, a tBLASTn
search with the Brachypodium Group B member, Bradi5g18370, identified a wheat cDNA [GenBank:
AK330487.1, E-value = 2-119] predicted to encode a protein with a GH28 domain. The presence of Brachypodium and sorghum sequences in Group B and the
identification of a related wheat sequence suggest that
monocots are under-represented in, rather than absent
from, the GH28 Group B.
A further distinction between the three-species GH28
tree of Penning et al. [90] and the six-species tree presented here is the presence - in the larger tree - of a
small, but very-well-supported, grass-specific clade comprised of two Brachypodium, one rice, and one sorghum
sequence (indicated with an asterisk in Figure 6). Both
of the Brachypodium genes, Bradi2g04520 and Bradi2g04550, have EST and Illumina transcriptome data
supporting their expression. When the four grass
sequences in this clade were used as queries in
tBLASTn searches of GenBank, matches from five additional species (grape, castor bean, oilseed rape, avacado,
and white spruce) were retrieved. However, none of
these additional sequences fell into the same clade as
the query sequences; this result is consistent with the
apparent absence of the clade from species outside the
Poaceae. As more genomes are sequenced and analyzed,
it will be interesting to determine how widely distributed this clade actually is and whether it has a specialized
function.
The GH51 family

The GH51 family includes a-L-arabinofuranosidases,
which cleave terminal, non-reducing a-L-arabinofuranose residues from arabinose-containing compounds [1].

The pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I, found
in dicot primary cell walls, and glucuronoarabinoxylan
(GAX), the predominant hemicellulose in grass primary
cell walls, both contain terminal arabinose residues in
their side chains [82,83,89]. Correspondingly, GH51
family members are implicated in plant-cell-wall remodeling [4]. The barley GH51 protein AXAH-I, for example, released arabinose from sugar beet arabinan, wheat
arabinoxylan, and larch wood arabinogalactan [93].
In contrast to barley AXAH-I, some GH51 members are
bi-functional enzymes, exhibiting both a-L-arabinofuranosidase and b-D-xylosidase activities. Arabidopsis
ARAF1, for instance, exhibits a preference for arabinose-containing substrates but can release both
L-arabinose and D-xylose from wheat and rye arabinoxylan [94].
Arabinosidases have received particular attention for
their contributions to pectin degradation during fruit
ripening: while GH28 polygalacturonases cleave the pectin backbone, arabinosidases degrade pectin side chains
[9]. During strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit
development, a-L-arabinofuranosidase activity is prominent; in a comparison of two strawberry cultivars, the
softer fruit of one cultivar also had higher a-L-arabinofuranosidase specific activity and higher transcript levels
for three arabinofuranosidase genes, FraAra1, 2, and 3
[95]. Expression of GH51 family members is not, however, limited to fruits. The peach ARF1 gene, although
initially identified based on its activity in fruit, is also
expressed in leaves and roots [96].
Arabidopsis ARAF1 (At3g10740 or ASD1) is similarly
broadly expressed, with ARAF1 transcripts detectable in
roots, rosettes, stems, flowers, and siliques [97]. Analyses
of plants transformed with an ARAF1-promoter-driven
reporter indicated that ARAF1 is specifically expressed
in tissues such as emerging lateral roots; the primary
and developing secondary xylem of mature roots; the
vasculature of cotyledons and leaves; and the phloem,
cambium, and guard cells of the stem [97,98]. ARAF1
enzymatic activity is higher in young, growing stems
than in mature stems, consistent with a possible cellwall-remodeling function for ARAF1 [94]. Inmmunolocalization assays with the LM6 antibody, which binds
arabinan epitopes, revealed localized increases in signal
intensity in mutant araf1 stem and root tissues compared to the wild-type [98]. Conversely, wild-type stem
sections exhibited markedly reduced signal intensity
upon treatment with partially purified ARAF1 [98].
Together, these results suggest that ARAF1 acts on
endogenous arabinose-containing polysaccharides in
these tissues [98].
In contrast to the large GH28 family, which is overrepresented in eudicots, the smaller GH51 family is
over-represented in grasses. Whereas Arabidopsis has

Page 15 of 21

two GH51 family members and poplar three, each of
the grasses examined has approximately double this
number: Rice has eight GH51 genes, Brachypodium five,
and sorghum six (Figure 1 and additional file 8). A phylogenetic tree constructed from Arabidopsis, poplar,
rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum GH51 proteins, as
well as additional eudicot and grass GH51 sequences
retrieved from the CAZy database and GenBank, is
shown in Figure 7 and additional file 15. The grass
sequences form two clades, both distinct from the single
eudicot clade. This well-supported family structure
(≥98% bootstrap values for the three major clades) suggests that there has been duplication and diversification
within the grass lineage. The clear separation between
eudicot and grass sequences likely reflects the differing
architectures of eudicot and grass cell walls, underscoring the need for a grass model. The similarity between
Brachypodium and other grasses with regard to the cellwall-related GH5, GH28, and GH51 families illustrates
that Brachypodium can meet this need.
The GH13 family

The GH13 family is well-known as the a-amylase family
[99]. It encompasses most of the starch-modifying
enzymes with a wide range of substrate specificities and
catalytic activities, such as a-amylases, pullulanases, isoamylases, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases
(CGTases), and branching enzymes [99,100]. Starch is
the main component of cereal seeds and provides up to
80% of the calories consumed by humans. In addition,
ethanol produced from starch is used as a transportation
fuel [101]. Based on an analysis of catalytic domains, the
GH13 family has been divided into 35 subfamilies, most
of which represent a single catalytic activity; in those
subfamilies with more than one catalytic activity, the
activities are closely related [100]. Crystal structures
have been reported for many GH13 family proteins.
They have three conserved domains: domain A is the
N-terminal, catalytic, (b/a)8 -barrel domain; domain B is
a loop inserted in domain A; and domain C is a C-terminal, b-sandwich domain [99,102,103].
We identified 13 GH13 genes from Brachypodium, 19
from sorghum and 13 from poplar (additional files 3, 6,
and 9). There are 10 and 18 members in Arabidopsis
and rice, respectively [2]. A phylogenetic tree based on
protein sequences was constructed to investigate the
evolutionary history of the GH13 family (Figure 8 and
additional file 16). A typical feature of this tree is that
most of the branches have representatives from all species, suggesting broad conservation of the GH13 family
in plants. The tree consists of three clades that are correlated with enzymatic activities: a-amylases (EC
3.2.1.1), branching enzymes (EC 2.4.1.18), and debranching enzymes including pullulanases (EC 3.2.1.41) and

8 and additional file 16).
a-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) are the best-studied of the
GH13 enzymes, due to their wide industrial use. a-

amylases catalyze the hydrolysis of internal a-D-(1,4)glucosidic linkages in starch (amylose and amylopectin),
glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides, releasing maltodextrins, maltooligosaccharides and glucose
[102]. There are three a-amylase genes (AtAmy1-3) in

Arabidopsis, and they represented three groups in previous phylogenetic analyses of a-amylase proteins from
multiple species [104,105]. The AtAmy1 (At4g25000)
protein contains a signal sequence and was predicted to
enter the secretory pathway, AtAmy3 (At1g69830) was
identified as plastid-targeted, and AtAmy2 (At1g76130)

does not appear to be targeted to any particular compartment of the cell [104]. Each enzyme is believed to
have a different role in plants, given the putative subcellular localizations [105]. In our phylogenetic tree (Figure
8), the a-amylase clade is divided into two groups. One
group containing AtAmy1 (At4g25000) includes a

Tyler et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:600
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/600

relatively large number of grass sequences. It has only 1
Arabidopsis and 3 poplar members, but 3 Brachypodium, 8 rice, and 9 sorghum members. Most of the
additional rice and sorghum sequences are in clusters
within the genome, indicating that the gene expansion
was due to recent, local duplication, which is common
for plant glycosidase- and glycosyltransferase-related
genes [3]. The other group clusters AtAmy2 and
AtAmy3 together with representatives from other species into two separate subgroups. Based on predictions
of the TargetP program [106] (data not shown), these
a-amylase genes, except two sorghum genes
(Sb02g026625 and Sb03g032830) and two poplar genes
(Poptr259394 and Poptr231366), encode proteins with
the same subcellular location as the Arabidopsis member in the same group or subgroup.
Branching enzymes catalyze the formation of branch
points by cleaving the a-1,4 linkage in polyglucans and
reattaching the chain via an a-1,6-glucan linkage; conversely, debranching enzymes directly hydrolyze the a1,6-glucosic linkages of polyglucans [107]. They are
involved in starch biosynthesis in the cereal endosperm
[107] and affect the eating and cooking quality of rice
[108]. In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 8 and additional
file 16), the branching and debranching enzymes form
two clades. Each member is well-conserved between different species, except that poplar lacks one isoamylase
and Arabidopsis lacks one branching enzyme representative (Figure 8). The presence of both grass and eudicot
sequences in each of the major clades and most of the
subclades of the GH13 family likely reflects the key
roles of starch-modifying enzymes in plants.

Conclusions
A decade ago, phylogenetic trees for plant GHs primarily
showed that a handful of plant enzymes were more closely
related to each other than to their bacterial counterparts.
Since then, genome sequencing efforts have uncovered
many more plant GH genes, whose cataloging can build
the foundation for detailed functional studies. Now, with
the availability of genome-wide analyses of GHs in Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, Brachypodium, and sorghum, it is possible to examine evolutionary histories and hypothesize
about orthologous relationships within plant GH families.
Our analysis showed that, while all angiosperms likely possess members of the same 34 GH families, there are significant differences between monocots and eudicots in the
relationships within these families. These differences probably arose in part because of the compositional differences
between grass and eudicot cell walls. However, by including additional species in our comparisons, we determined
that several clades of GHs previously thought to contain
only monocot or dicot proteins do, in fact, contain GHs
from both eudicots and monocots. This highlights the

Page 18 of 21

importance of examining several species before making
broad generalizations.
By defining the complement of Brachypodium GH
genes, we set the stage for Brachypodium to be used as
a grass model for investigations of the GHs and their
diverse, associated functions. As with the eudicot model
Arabidopsis, forward and reverse genetics combined
with the phenotypic characterizations possible in a
small, rapidly growing plant will help elucidate the in
planta roles of GHs. Insights gained from Brachypodium will inform translational research studies, with
applications for the improvement of cereal crops and
bioenergy grasses.
