Abstract
Background: The nontoxigenic V. cholerae El Tor strains ferment sorbitol faster than the toxigenic
strains, hence fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains are defined by sorbitol fermentation test.
This test has been used for more than 40 years in cholera surveillance and strain analysis in China.
Understanding of the mechanisms of sorbitol metabolism of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains
may help to explore the genome and metabolism divergence in these strains. Here we used
comparative proteomic analysis to find the proteins which may be involved in such metabolic
difference.
Results: We found the production of formate and lactic acid in the sorbitol fermentation medium
of the nontoxigenic strain was earlier than of the toxigenic strain. We compared the protein
expression profiles of the toxigenic strain N16961 and nontoxigenic strain JS32 cultured in sorbitol
fermentation medium, by using fructose fermentation medium as the control. Seventy-three
differential protein spots were found and further identified by MALDI-MS. The difference of
product of fructose-specific IIA/FPR component gene and mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase, may be
involved in the difference of sorbitol transportation and dehydrogenation in the sorbitol fast- and
slow-fermenting strains. The difference of the relative transcription levels of pyruvate formatelyase to pyruvate dehydrogenase between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains may be also
responsible for the time and ability difference of formate production between these strains.
Conclusion: Multiple factors involved in different metabolism steps may affect the sorbitol
fermentation in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of V. cholerae El Tor.

Background
Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. Out of the 200 serogroups of V. cholerae,
only two biotypes of serogroup O1 (classical and El Tor)
and serogroup O139 cause severe diarrhea and epidemic
cholera [1], although not all strains in these two sero-

groups are pathogenic. Toxigenic and nontoxigenic V.
cholerae strains are genetically diverse. The toxigenic
strains form a genetically homogenous group, while nontoxigenic strains are heterogeneous and may have diverse
origins [2-4]. The nontoxigenic strains, which are usually
isolated from environmental sources such as sewage, oysPage 1 of 10

ters, and brackish water, do not carry cholera toxin (CT)
and other major virulence genes necessary for human
pathogenesis [5].
V. cholerae is capable of metabolizing many types of carbohydrates. Previously, we found that not only is D-sorbitol metabolized by V. cholerae, but it is also fermented at
different rates by the toxigenic and nontoxigenic El Tor
strains. The toxigenic strains have a low sorbitol fermentation rate and are called slow-fermenting strains, whereas
the nontoxigenic strains have a faster sorbitol fermentation rate and are called fast-fermenting strains [6]. The
sorbitol fermentation test is included in the Phage-biotyping scheme, which consists of phage typing and biochemical typing and is developed in 1970s in China. This
scheme is used to distinguish and type the El Tor strains
which are pathogenic and are potential to cause epidemic
or not [6]. It is found that the O1 El Tor strains isolated
from patients and environmental samples in epidemics
are toxigenic and sorbitol slow-fermenting, whereas the
strains isolated from environment in non-epidemic periods are nontoxigenic and fast-fermenting.
In some bacteria, D-sorbitol is transported into the cell via
the sorbitol specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) or
some non-sorbitol specific PTS, and then it is transformed
from sorbitol-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and
enters the fructose/mannitol metabolism pathway. All
genes involved in the fructose/mannitol metabolism
pathway in V. cholerae have been identified and annotated
on the genome [7], but the genes involved in sorbitol
transportation and transformation are unknown http://
www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?vch00051,
though a previous study identified the differential proteins expressed in the presence or absence of sorbitol,
based on which only the sorbitol induced proteins could
be found [8].
An investigation into the mechanism behind the different
fermentation rates in toxigenic versus nontoxigenic V.
cholerae strains may help to further the understanding of
their genetic and evolutionary differences. Here, we used
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify differences in
metabolites and proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation between toxigenic (sorbitol slow-fermenting) and
nontoxigenic (sorbitol fast-fermenting) V. cholerae El Tor
strains. Proteomics is a useful high-throughout technique
and has been used in V. cholerae to construct proteome reference map [9], protein expression analysis in the different culture environments [8,10,11] and in the human
host environment [12]. Large genetic differences exist
between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic V. cholerae based
on the comparative genomic hybridization [13], accordingly protein components of these strains will be much

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/135

more divergent. The direct comparison of protein profiles
of the fast- and slow-fermenting strains cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium will lead the confusion and
misunderstanding of the proteins associated with the
mechanisms of fermentation difference. Fructose and
sorbitol metabolisms share the same pathway after the
fructose-6-phosphate step, and we found no differences in
fructose fermentation rates between the sorbitol fast- and
slow-fermenting strains, therefore in this study we used
fructose as a control when comparing protein profiles, to
exclude proteins constitutively involved in sugar metabolism. This approach allowed to identify differences in protein expression associated with sorbitol metabolism
difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic V. cholerae
strains. Differences of formate production, fructose-6phosphate production and subsequent metabolism were
found to be causative mechanisms in the sorbitol fermentation difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic V. cholerae strains.

Methods
Bacterial Strains
Two V. cholerae strains of serogroup O1 El Tor (N16961
and JS32) were used to compare protein expression profiles by 2-DE analysis. N16961 is a toxigenic strain whose
complete genome was previously published [7], while
JS32 is a nontoxigenic strain isolated in 1982 in China. An
additional eight toxigenic strains (97005, LN2001-5,
GD97-73, ZJ62-10, D118, 93–284, WUJIANG-2 and 63–
12) and three nontoxigenic strains (V05-18, 79327 and
60–61) isolated in China were also included in this study
(Table 1).
Sorbitol and fructose fermentation tests
Fresh colonies cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar were
selected and inoculated statically in 1 ml LB broth at 37°C
for 2 hours, to reach the OD600 of 0.5 or 1 × 107CFU/ml
equivalently. Then 100 μl cultures were transferred into 3

ml fermentation media (0.01% peptone, 5% NaCl, 2%
sorbitol or fructose, and 0.025% phenol red; pH 8–9) and
inoculated statically at 37°C. Sugar fermentation was
measured as the color change in the medium 4 and 8
hours post-inoculation (yellow, fast fermentation or a
positive test; red, slow fermentation or a negative test) [6].
Considering the high concentration of sorbitol in the fermentation medium, fructose at a similar concentration
was used as a control sugar in the proteome analysis to
eliminate differences in nutrient usage, osmotic pressure
and pH in the media with and without sorbitol. pH of the
fermentation medium was measured with CPpH 5900305 (Cole).
1H-NMR

One milliliter of the fermentation media cultured with the
test strains was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at
room temperature for 10 min to clarify the supernatant.
The1H resonance of D2O (10%) was used to lock the field
and for shimming. Tetramethylsilane was used as internal
standard. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA
600 spectrometer (Varian Inc, USA) operating at 60 MHz
with the following parameters: pulse 55.1 degrees, mixing
0.15 sec, acquire time 4.573 sec, 7 kHz spectral width, line
broadening 0.5 Hz, 128 repetitions, FT size 131072.
Comparative proteome analysis
V. cholerae strains N16961 and JS32 were cultured in 400
ml sorbitol or fructose fermentation media. The V. cholerae cell precipitates were washed with precooled low salt
PBS (3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl, 9 mM
NaH2PO4) and disrupted and solubilized using lysis solution (7 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT)
and sonicated for 2 min on ice using the Sonifier 750
(S&M0202, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT,
USA). After centrifuging at 100,000 × g 15°C for 45 min,
supernatant aliquots were stored at -70°C and the protein
concentration was determined with the PlusOne 2-D
Quant Kit (Amersham Pharmacia, Sweden).

2-DE was performed using the Immobiline/polyacrylamide system and 18 cm IPG strips (pH ranges 4 to 7)
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Seven hundred
microgram samples were loaded, and isoelectric focusing
was conducted at 20°C for 58,000 Vhrs (maximum voltage of 8,000 V) on IPGphor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). For the second dimension, vertical slab
SDS-PAGE (12.5%) was used (Bio-Rad protean II Xi, BioRad laboratories, USA). Gels were stained using Colloidal
Coomassie Blue G-2500 (5 g G-250, 170 ml methanol,
212.5 ml 40% ammonium sulfate, 15 ml phosphoric
acid, and 102.5 ml purified water). Three sample preparations were made for every strain, and each sample was
repeated at least twice. Images were analyzed using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/135

Image-Master 2D Elite (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Sweden).
In-gel protein digestion, MALDI-TOF-MS and protein
identification
Protein spots of interest were excised from the gels. After
destaining, gel pieces were digested with trypsin (Roche,
Germany) for 12 h at 37°C. The extracts were dried and
resolubilized in 2 μl of 0.5% TFA. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) measurements were performed on a
Bruker Reflex™ III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) working in reflectron mode with 20 kV of accelerating voltage and 23 kV of
reflecting voltage. A saturated solution of α-Cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) in 50% acetonitrile and
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used for the matrix.
Mass accuracy for PMF analysis was 0.1–0.2 Da with external calibration; internal calibration was carried out using
enzyme autolysis peaks, and the resolution was 12,000.
Database searches were performed using the software
Mascot v1.7.02 (Matrix Science Ltd.) licensed in-house
http://mascot.proteomics.com.cn/
search_form_PMF.html against the database of V. cholerae
N16961 (Version Vib CLEAN 040921, 3814 sequences).
Monoisotopic peptide masses were used to search the
databases with a mass tolerance of 100 ppm and one partial cleavage. Oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine was considered. Scores
greater than 48 were significant (p < 0.05), with more
than five peptides matched and sequence coverage greater
than 15%.
Sequencing of the gene VCA0518
The gene VCA0518 (designated in the genome of
N16961, GenBank Accession Number NC002506), which
corresponds to the fructose-specific IIA/FPR component
(PTS system, FIIA), was amplified from all tested strains
using primers 5' GCG CTG GAT TTA AGG TGA TGG 3'
and 5' TCG CCT ATA GAG GCA GAC AGG 3' and
sequenced. The sequences were searched in the CDD database (V2.16-27036PSSMs, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) for conserved domain analysis.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA from N16961 and JS32 cultured in sorbitol fermentation media was extracted at the inoculation time
points 2, 4, 6 and 8 h with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The following primer pairs were used in reverse
transcription and amplification of genes: 5' CCG CAG
GAA TCG TGT TGA TGT AG 3' and 5' GAA TCC GTT GTC
CGT GAA GAA GG 3' for pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit
E1 (VC2414); 5' CAC GAC GCT GGC TAC ATC AAC 3'
and 5' ACC ATA CGG ATA CCA CCA TTA GGG 3' for
pyruvate formate-lyase 1 activating enzyme (PFL)
(VC1866); and 5' AAG ATT GGT GTG ATG TTT GGT A 3'

and 5' CAC TTC TTC GCC TTC TTT GA 3' for the internal
standard recA gene. The reaction was performed using the
SYBR premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The 2-ΔΔCt
method was used to calculate relative expression of the
VC18166 gene to the VC2414 gene in the N16961 and
JS32 strains, and normalized with the control gene recA.

Results
Dynamic change of the fermentation medium pH
We measured the pH of the sorbitol fermentation media
of the strains during the fermentation test, by extracting 5
ml of the media serially at each time point, from a volume
of 400 ml culture of each strain. The pH-time curves (Fig.
1) demonstrate that the JS32 sorbitol fermentation
medium pH dropped gradually over time, while that of
N16961 leveled off at pH 6.5 for about 2 hours before
dropping again. The change in pH was consistent with the
sorbitol fermentation test, showing that nontoxigenic
strains display positive results earlier than toxigenic
strains [6].

analysis
In order to understand the differences in pH observed for
the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains, we examined
changes in medium components using 1H-NMR. The
majority of the components in the sorbitol fermentation
media exhibited similar depletion or formation for JS32
and N16961 (Fig. 2). One exception was the appearance
of two volatile compounds (formate and lactic acid). Formate appeared in the JS32 culture earlier than in the

N16961 culture, and the different production rates of formate between these two V. cholerae strains were consistent
with their pH changes and fermentation rates. At the time
of color change in the JS32 fermentation sample, the concentrations of acetic acid and formate in the medium were
30.53 mg/L and 16.86 mg/L (0.509 mmol/L and 0.367
mmol/L, respectively). In contrast, the acetic acid concentration in N16961 fermentation media was 24.37 mg/L
(0.406 mmol/L), and formate was below the level of
detection.
Comparative proteomic analysis
At the positive time point of the sorbitol fermentation test
of JS32 (4 hours), whole cell proteins from four different
cultures were prepared and separated by 2-DE. These protein profiles were designated FN, SN, FJ and SJ, indicating
samples prepared from N16961 in fructose, N16961 in
sorbitol, JS32 in fructose, and JS32 in sorbitol fermentation medium, respectively.

On the SN and FN proteome profiles, 901 and 903 spots
were identified, respectively, but only 39 spots had
changed in abundance, in them 27 were more abundant
in N16961 cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium
(SN), 12 were more abundant in sample of FN (Fig. 3)
[also see Additional file 1]. Such similarity also existed in
the SJ and FJ profiles, with 34 differential spots found, 17
were more abundant in samples of SJ and FJ respectively
(Fig. 3) [also see Additional file 1]. All of the 73 differential protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-MS, and 71
spots significantly matched known proteins (one spot of
FJ and one spot of SN were not identified) [see Additional
file 1]. Sixty-two percent of the spots were identified as
proteins involved in energy metabolism and central intermediary metabolism, and six spots were identified as
transport/binding proteins.
Out of 73 total differential spots identified in the SN/FN
and SJ/FJ comparisons, 10 common signified potential
proteins of these two comparison groups may be involved
in the difference between the sorbitol and fructose metabolism pathway: amino acid ABC transporter, perosamine
synthase, malate dehydrogenase, aminotransferase NifS,
heat shock protein HtpG, succinyl-CoA synthase, FIIA,
glycerol kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and oxygeninsensitive NAD(P)H nitroreductase. Three of these proteins (glycerol kinase, oxygen-insensitive NAD(P)H
nitroreductase, and FIIA) were more abundant in sorbitol
medium.
Two proteins within the identified 73 spots, the FIIA protein of PTS system and mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase
(MtlD), may be involved in the transportation and transformation of sorbitol. FIIA was a common differential
protein observed in the comparisons of SN/FN and SJ/FJ,

both of which were more abundant in the sorbitol
medium than in the fructose medium (Fig 4A). MtlD was
more abundant in sorbitol than in fructose fermentation
medium of the sorbitol fast-fermenting strain JS32, but
was not found difference in SN/FN comparison of the
sorbitol slow-fermenting strain N16961 (Fig. 4B), suggesting its potential role in the sorbitol metabolism difference between these two strains. Two different pI forms of
it were also found in SJ sample (Fig. 4B). Two proteins,
pyruvate dehydrogenase and PFL, were also found differences in the comparison of sorbitol to fructose fermentation in JS32 and N16961, pyruvate dehydrogenase was

more abundant in SJ of SJ/FJ comparison but less abundant in SN of SN/FN comparison, and PFL was more
abundant in both FJ and FN (Fig. 4C and 4D). These two
enzymes were both involved in pyruvate transformation,
and PFL catalyzes pyruvate to produce formate. Their different expression may suggest their roles in formate production in the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains.
In addition, the haemolysin and hcp proteins, which are
related to V. cholerae pathogenicity, were also abundant
spots on the SN gel, showing higher expression levels in
N16961.

Sequencing of the VCA0518 gene
Due to the observed differences on the 2-DE gels (the
VCA0518 gene product, FIIA component), the VCA0518
gene from all toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains studied

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/135

were amplified and sequenced (GenBank: EF581766 to
EF581778). All of the sequences contained three predicted conserved domains: the fructose specific PTS EIIA
component, the EIIA component of PTS, and the HPr protein. The sequences of the nine toxigenic strains were
highly similar but differed from the nontoxigenic strains,
while three of four nontoxigenic strains had identical
sequences. A comparison of amino acid residues of the
nontoxigenic and toxigenic strains revealed changes
mainly localized at the spacer region between the latter
two domains. Nearly all of these residues involved
changes in the polarity or acid-alkalinity of the amino acid
(Fig. 5). Three of the four nontoxigenic strains (JS32,
79327 and V05-18) lacked a 15 nucleotide (nt) region
(AGCTGTGGGAACGAT) from 861 to 875, and the pIs of
their proteins changed from 5.88 to 5.75. This data was
consistent with the appearance of the FIIA protein spots
on the 2-DE gels. The nontoxigenic strain 60–61 did not
lack the 15 nt fragment, but amino acid mutations placed
it in the farthest phylogenetic cluster from the other
strains (data not shown).
qRT-PCR of VC1866 and VC2414
PFL (VC1866) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (VC2414)
were identified as spots in the proteomic analysis (Fig. 4)
and are involved in the production of fermentation acids.
We monitored transcription levels at four time points during the fermentation assay. The transcription levels of
both VC1866 and VC2414 of JS32 were higher than those
of N16961 in sorbitol fermentation medium at 4 hrs and

reversed at 8 hrs (Fig. 6A). When comparing the relative
transcription levels of VC1866 to VC2414 of JS32 and
N16961 (Fig. 6B), we found that the relative transcription
of VC1866 of JS32 was higher than of N16961 at all time
points. JS32 transcription of VC1866 reached a peak fivefold increase at 6 hrs, whereas N16961 transcription was
only increased two-fold. No wonder the fast-fermenting
strain JS32 showed much higher production of formate
than did the slow-fermenting strain N16961.

Discussion
Nontoxigenic V. cholerae strains ferment sorbitol at a
faster rate than toxigenic strains, one of phenotyping
included in the Phage-biotyping, which has been widely
used as a typing scheme in cholera surveillance for many
years in China and has been confirmed by thousands of
strains [6]. To understand the mechanism of this difference in sorbitol fermentation rate, here we compared the
expression of proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation
in toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. The proteome profiles of the cells cultured in sorbitol and fructose medium

were very similar with few differential spots, indicating
that the status of the cells in these two conditions was similar. Therefore, we could subtract the most commonly
expressed constitutive proteins not related to sorbitol fermentation when comparing SN/FN and SJ/FJ. This
approach identified two PTS proteins and two proteins
involved in formate production.
In general, the specificity of sugar PTSs lies in their EIIA
component, while the HPr protein and EI enzyme are
encoded by independent genes and are commonly used
by different sugar PTS systems. In the conservative
domain analysis of the V. cholerae VCA0518 gene, we
found that this EIIA component was larruping and it contained three conservative domains, two of which are not
sugar-specific. The sequences of the three domains were
almost completely identical for all tested strains, further
demonstrating their highly conserved nature. We conjectured that the low specificity of the co-expressed HPr and
EIIA domains endowed the VCA0518 gene product with a
role in sorbitol utilization. Contrary to the conservation
of the domains, the entire VCA0518 gene sequences of the
13 tested strains showed obvious differences between the
toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains, with the variable
amino acid residues located at the spacer region between
the domains. These differences may impact the steric conformation and the regulation of this protein, and further
impact the efficiency of sorbitol transportation. The regulation of transcription, which maybe also affects the
expression of VCA0518 in the sorbitol fast-fermenting
and slow-fermenting strains, should also be considered
MtlD catalyses the transformation of mannitol-1-P to
fructose-6-P, the later enters the fructose metabolism
pathway. Mannitol and sorbitol are very similar in molecular structure. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, sorbitol is transported by the mannitol PTS system and transformed by
polyol dehydrogenase, which has a broad substrate spectrum [14,15]. In a previous study we confirmed the transcriptions of the N16961 VCA1046 gene in sorbitol and
mannitol fermentation media [16]. Here, our results indicate that two non-sorbitol specific PTSs are involved in the
V. cholerae sorbitol utilization process. This may be similar
to the uptake of L-sorbose in Lactobacillus casei where Lsorbose is mainly taken up via EIISor and EIIMan plays a secondary role [17]. In Bacillus subtilis, MtlD is required for
sorbitol assimilation in addition to the gut operon [18].
Interestingly, both of these PTSs are located on chromosome II of V. cholerae. Several studies indicate that the two
chromosomes of V. cholerae are heterologous and that
chromosome II may be a megaplasmid captured by an
ancestral V. cholerae [7]. The ability to ferment sorbitol
used to differentiate V. cholerae strains may provide clues
as to both the origins and genetic variation of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.

The traditional sorbitol fermentation test is a phenotypic
method using phenol red as the indicator. In our study,
we showed that the observed differences in sorbitol fermentation rates were the result of changes in the production rate of formate in the fast-fermenting and slowfermenting strains. The fact that the ratio of formate to
acetic acid was not consistent between the two strains also
indicated that, besides the differences early in the metabolic pathway (including the transportation and transformation of sorbitol), pyruvate catabolism could be
different in sorbitol fermentation in the toxigenic and
nontoxigenic strains. Both pyruvate dehydrogenase and
PFL can catalyze the transformation of pyruvate to acetylCoA, but they have different electron acceptors and outputs. Their activities affect the relative proportion of the
end products [19]. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces CO2
in addition to acetyl-CoA, while formate is the product of
PFL. In the proteomic and qRT-PCR analyses of this study,
the respective expression and transcription levels of these
two genes were significantly different in the fast-fermenting JS32 and slow-fermenting N16961. Consistent with
this fact was that formate was produced earlier in JS32
than in N16961. In a previous study, we had confirmed
that the sequences of VC1844 including the promoter
region of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains could be
identical (data not shown). The differential transcription
or metabolism of pyruvate was not at VC1844 gene level
and there must be a regulation mechanism, which acts at
the pyruvate point, differs between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.
The most important difference between the toxigenic and
nontoxigenic strains is the presence or absence of the
cholera toxin gene ctxAB. When we deleted ctxAB from the
toxigenic strains or complemented ctxAB via plasmid into
the nontoxigenic strains, we did not observe the reversion
of the sorbitol fermentation rate when comparing the
mutants with the wild-type strains (data not shown). In
the proteomic analysis, we identified two virulencerelated proteins. Among them, hemolysin has a predominant role in lethality and confers V. cholerae the ability to
prevent clearance and establish prolonged colonization
without a requirement for cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pili [20,21]. V. cholerae Hcp protein is a 28-kDa
secreted protein regulated coordinately with hemolysin.
The expression of both proteins has been shown to promote expression of virulence determinants in vivo and
increase LD50 in the infant mouse cholera model [22,23].
Consistent with their co-regulation relationship, both
hemolysin and hcp were more abundant in the N16961
sorbitol culture profiles, suggesting that sorbitol induction and metabolism may have relationship with the regulation of the expression of virulent elements in V.
cholerae.

Conclusion
We carried out a comparative analysis of the differences
induced by sorbitol between toxigenic (sorbitol slow fermentation) and nontoxigenic (sorbitol fast fermentation)
V. cholerae strains. Our results suggest that the differential
expression of the FIIA protein and MtlD of mannitol PTS
demonstrate changes in the transportation and metabolism of sorbitol, and that pyruvate dehydrogenase and PFL
relate to the different production rate of the acid metabolites. The contribution and functional mechanisms of
these proteins in the V. cholerae sorbitol fermentation
pathway in toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains will require
further study.
