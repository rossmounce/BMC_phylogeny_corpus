Genetic structure of Leptopilina boulardi
populations from different climatic zones of Iran
Majeed Askari Seyahooei1,2*, Jacques JM van Alphen3, Ken Kraaijeveld1

Abstract
Background: The genetic structure of populations can be influenced by geographic isolation (including physical
distance) and ecology. We examined these effects in Leptopilina boulardi, a parasitoid of Drosophila of African
origin and widely distributed over temperate and (sub) tropical climates.
Results: We sampled 11 populations of L. boulardi from five climatic zones in Iran and measured genetic
differentiation at nuclear (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism; AFLP) and mitochondrial (Cytochrome
Oxidase I; COI) loci. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) for the AFLP data revealed that 67.45% of variation
resided between populations. No significant variation was observed between climatic zones. However, a significant
difference was detected between populations from the central (dry) regions and those from the wetter north,
which are separated by desert. A similarly clear cut genetic differentiation between populations from the central
part of Iran and those from the north was observed by UPGMA cluster analysis and Principal Coordinates Analysis
(PCO). Both UPGMA and PCO further separated two populations from the very humid western Caspian Sea coast
(zone 3) from other northern populations from the temperate Caspian Sea coastal plain (zone 2), which are
connected by forest. One population (Nour) was genetically intermediate between these two zones, indicating
some gene flow between these two groups of populations. In all analyses a mountain population, Sorkhabad was
found to be genetically identical to those from the nearby coastal plain (zone 2), which indicates high gene flow
between these populations over a short geographical distance. One population from the Caspian coast (Astaneh)
was genetically highly diverged from all other populations. A partial Mantel test showed a highly significant
positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances, as well as separation by the deserts of central Iran.
The COI sequences were highly conserved among all populations.
Conclusion: The Iranian populations of L. boulardi showed clear genetic structure in AFLP profiles, but not in COI
sequence data. The transfer of fruits containing Drosophila larvae parasitized by L. boulardi appears to have caused
some unexpected gene flow and changed the genetic composition of populations, particularly in urban areas.
Nevertheless, our results suggest that climate, geographic distance and physical barriers may all have contributed
to the formation of genetically distinct populations of L. boulardi. Inevitably, there will be overlap between the
portions of variance explained by these variables. Disentangling the relative contributions of climate and
geography to the genetic structure of this species will require additional sampling.

Background
Changing climates are expected to have profound effects
on the genetics of insect populations. One way to study
such effects is to compare populations of a widely distributed organism across contrasting climates.

One of the main constraints on local genetic differentiation and adaptation is extensive gene flow between
populations. Reduced dispersal between populations can
lead to genetic subdivision of populations [1] and may
facilitate local adaptation. Environmental or physical
barriers may promote isolation of populations. These
include geographic distance [2] and physical barriers
like mountains, rivers and stretches of unsuitable
habitat.

DNA markers provide powerful and efficient tools to
study genetic diversity in insect populations [3-5] at
both inter- and intraspecific level. Amplified Fragment
Length Polymorphism (AFLP) is a useful DNA fingerprinting technique to study genetic diversity within a
species [6-9] because it allows detection of genetic variation of organisms based on DNA from any source and
complexity [10] without prior knowledge of the gene
structure or sequences. AFLP markers have been used
to infer the role of geographical distance and barriers to
gene flow in shaping the genetic structure of population
[e.g., [11-13]] in a variety of organisms. The results of
AFLP analysis can be translated to the genetic distances
[4,8,14] of populations. Genetic distance of isolated
population is the most fundamental information need to
assess the role of geographical barriers and distances in
genetic diversification of populations. Mitochondrial
markers have also been used in population genetic studies [e.g., [15-17]] of insects. For example, in the ant
Leptothorax rugatulus [16] a mitochondrial marker was
found to be more informative than microsatellites and
discriminated significantly better between populations.
Using mitochondrial markers may provide valuable
information on the migration of females between populations because mitochondria are maternally inherited.
Insect parasitoids have been a favorite model in ecology
and evolutionary biology [18] studies. Drosophila parasitoids have played a major role in these studies, because
of their ease of maintenance in the laboratory, the enormous biological and genetic information on their Drosophila host, which has been used as model organism for
almost a century [19] and because of their diversity
which allows comparative studies. In the present study
we used AFLP markers and mitochondrial gene sequencing to investigate the role of geographical distance in
shaping genetic variation in Iranian Leptopilina boulardi
(Hymenoptera: Figitidae) populations. L. boulardi is a larval parasitoid of Drosophila of African origin [20] which
is widely distributed over tropical and warm temperate
regions. We used both AFLP and COI gene sequencing
to study the genetic structure among 11 populations of
L. boulardi collected from five contrasting climate zones
in Iran (Figure 1, Table 1). The zones were chosen to
represent five distinct climates varying in precipitation,
length of season and minimum and maximum temperatures. The main goal of this study was to investigate to
what extent the genetic structure of these populations
matched climatic and geographical patterns.

Results
AFLP analysis

The 9 primer combinations yielded 670 scorable bands
of which 147 (21.94%) were polymorphic. AMOVA of
the AFLP results revealed that the main proportion of

Page 2 of 9

genetic variation resided among populations (67.45%,
P < 0.001). Pair-wise differences of F st values among
populations ranged from 0.53 - 0.94 (Additional file 1).
No significant differences were observed between populations from different climate zones. However, a significant proportion of variation was explained by the
distinction between central and northern populations
(18.1%, P = 0.017). Consistent with AMOVA, UPGMA
tree and bootstrap analysis indicated that the three
populations from the central part of Iran (Dorcheh,
Khairabad and Zamankhan) clustered together, but were
differentiated from the northern populations sampled
along the Caspian Sea coast (bootstrap value = 87%,
Figure 2). One population from the very wet Caspian
Sea coast (Astaneh) was considerably different from all
other populations. In pair-wise comparison of population the highest Fst values was observed when we compared this population with the others. UPGMA tree also
separated this population strongly from all other with
high bootstrap value (bootstrap = 88). The Sorkhabad
population, collected from a mountainous region on the
slope of the Damavand mountain near Mazandaran
clustered together with the wet Caspian Sea coastal
populations. Consistent with UPGMA tree and PCO
plots, low F st values in pair-wise comparison were
observed when we compared Sorkhabad with other
northern populations (e.g. Chalus: Fst = 0.53).
Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) revealed informative separation of populations (Figure 3). The first three
coordinates explained 69.32% of AFLP variation. By
plotting the first two coordinates (which together
explained 52.73% of the AFLP variation) the three populations from the dry central region of Iran clustered
separately from the northern populations. These two
principal coordinates also separated the populations
from the two northern zones (zone 2 and 3), except
Nour - a population from zone 2 clustered as zone 3
and Astaneh - the most divergent population which
stood apart from all others. The other two PCO plots
showed further evidence for divergence among the
populations along the Caspian Sea coast. By plotting the
first and third coordinates and second and third coordinates (which in total explained 46.67% and 39.26% of
AFLP variation, respectively) two clusters were evident
among the populations from the Caspian Sea coast,
while Astaneh, the most divergent population, again
stood apart from all other groups. Furthermore, the
Zamankhan population from a Mediterranean climate
(zone 5) appeared separated from the two other central
populations from zone 4 (Khairabad and Dorcheh).
Consistent with the UPGMA analysis, the Sorkhabad
population from the mountain region clustered with
populations from the geographically close, but ecologically different wet Caspian Sea coast.

Figure 2 Dendogram derived from the UPGMA (unweighted pair group methods of arithmetic averages) analysis of 147 polymorphic
AFLP bands. Shown are the genetic distances of 11 population of Iranian Leptopilina boulardi and their outgroup (a population of L. boulardi
from France). Scales indicate genetic distances (Nei& Li, 1979) and the numbers at nodes represent bootstrap value (1000 replicates).

Isolation of populations by distance

A significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed among the L. boulardi populations (Mantel test; r = 0.47, P < 0.001). The result of this
test showed that a considerable part of the genetic variation
was explained by geographic distance and supported the
UPGMA and Principal Coordinate analyses since all geographically-close populations resembled each other. The
only exception was the population from Astaneh, which
was highly distinct from all others populations, even from
those collected from a distance of less than 15 km. A partial
Mantel test including all populations found no significant
effect for isolation by the deserts of central Iran (mantel
test; r = 0.12, P = 0.25). However, by excluding the Astaneh
population from the partial Mantel test, we found a significant effect for isolation by dry desert (mantel test; r = 0.38,
P = 0.001). After correcting for the effect of isolation by
desert, the partial correlation between geographic and
genetic distances decreased somewhat, but still remained
highly significant (mantel test; r = 0.41, P = 0.011, Figure 4).
Variation in cytochrome oxidase I (COI)

COI sequence was found to be highly conserved among
the Iranian L. boulardi populations. Only two bases
were found to be different in two Caspian Sea coast
populations and four insertions and one replacement
were found in the out-group compared to the Iranian
populations (Table 2).

Discussion
The AFLP analysis provided enough information to allow
a clear distinction among L. boulardi populations

originating from different climatic zones in Iran. With
the exception of one population (Astaneh), the genetic
distances between populations correlated closely with
geographic distances. A partial Mantel test revealed a significant correlation between habitat isolation and genetic
diversification. AMOVA also indicated diversification of
populations originating from distinct dry or wet regions.
Populations collected within short proximity tended to
resemble each other genetically (e.g. Qaemshahr1 and
Qaemshahr 2; distance 1.5 km), as expected because of
the high likelihood of gene flow. This was true even for
populations that were ecologically very different: the
mountain population of Sorkhabad was genetically indistinguishable from populations from the nearby coastal
plain. The partial Mantel test showed significant effects
of geographical barriers as well as the distance on genetic
divergence. The positive correlation between genetic and
geographic distances in our study is consistent with several other genetic structure studies [11,13,21] on insect
populations. However, studies on the genetic structure of
Drosophila parasitoid populations are rare. A comparison
of L. clavipes populations in western Europe found distinct genetic differentiation between sexual and asexual
populations [22], but no correlation between geographic
and genetic distances.
The different climatic environments we sampled
(including desert, Mediterranean, and wet temperate
conditions) undoubtedly impose different selection pressures on the life history of parasitoids. The genetic differences we observed between geographically isolated
populations imply low gene flow. This will facilitate
genetic response to such selection.

Figure 3 Separation of Iranian L. boulardi populations by the first three coordinates in Principal Coordinates analysis. The first three
coordinates explained 69.23% of AFLP variations among Iranian L. boulardi populations. For the origin zone of populations see table 1.

In addition to geography and climate, human activity
also appears to affect the genetic structure of L. boulardi populations. Parasitized fruit fly larvae may be
transported with fruits and give rise to populations dissimilar from the neighbouring ones, in particular in
urban areas. We found unexpected genetic divergence

in two northern populations Astaneh (which was
highly divergent from the neighbouring) and Nour
(which showed intermediate structure between two
Caspian Coast zones). Both populations originated
from urban areas and could have arrived with fruit
transports.

of L. boulardi from different climate zone of Iran. Geographic distance by itself explained a large amount of
the variance in AFLP profiles. The two most distinct
clusters, namely populations from central Iran versus
those from the north, are also separated by a large area
of unsuitable habitat, suggesting that such barriers may
further contribute to genetic divergence. The mountain
population from Sorkhabad showed that differences in
ecology by themselves are not enough to overcome the
homogenising effect of gene flow over short geographic
distances. Climate may drive host distribution patterns
and select for differences in life-history traits of parasitoids. The reduction in gene flow between geographically isolated populations will facilitate genetic
adaptation to such selection pressures.

Methods
Field sampling
Figure 4 Partial correlation between genetic and geographic
distances, excluding Astaneh, the most divergent population in
all analyses.

In addition to geography and climate, variation in hosts
may result in adaptation and genetic differentiation of
parasitoids [23], due to the intimate relationship between
host and parasitoid. However, we found no evidence of
the differentiation caused by hosts in this study.
Populations in the central part of Iran were sampled
from isolated locations surrounded by dry desert. The
relatively high genetic divergence over relatively short
geographic distance between these central populations
compared to northern populations implies that the barrier formed by unsuitable habitat may contribute to
genetic diversification independently of geographic distance (Figure 1, 2; compare geographic and genetic distances between Zamankhan and Dorcheh or Khairabad
in central Iran to those between Qaemshahr1,2 and
Chalus in the north).
Sequence data on the cytochrome oxidase I gene were
less informative in our study than ALFPs. Mitochondrial
markers are potentially informative markers in genetic
studies of insect populations [15-17], sensitive to differences in the rates of male and female migration [24]
between populations. However, most studies using CO I
and II as molecular markers in insects have used them
in phylogenetic and taxonomic contexts to discriminate
between higher taxa [24-26] than populations. Our
results demonstrate a highly conserved pattern for COI
among L. boulardi populations.

Conclusion
In summary, this study provides strong evidence for
genetic divergence of geographically isolated populations

Leptopilina boulardi populations were sampled along a
climatic cline stretching from the northern to the central regions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The transect
covered five climatic zones as follows (Table 1, Figure 1):
cool mountains in Damavand (zone 1), wet forests (zone
2) and very wet rain forests along the Caspian sea coast
(zone 3), a dry and hot climate with cold winters in the
Esfahan region (zone 4) and a Mediterranean climate
with very cold winters in Shahre Kord (zone 5). Sampling was conducted in mid-summer (July 2006) to
increase the likelihood of collecting adult wasps from all
the zones. At each sampling site, we placed 12 traps.
The traps consisted of plastic containers (diameter 10
cm; height 7.5 cm) with a 3 cm diameter circular hole
in the lid, which was covered with a plastic mesh wide

enough for Drosophila flies and their parasitoids to
enter the traps. Several layers of filter paper were placed
in each trap to absorb water and provide pupation sites
for Drosophila larvae. The traps were baited with a
piece of banana and suspended from trees and its position was recorded by GPS (Additional file 2). After a
week the traps were collected and all pupae in the traps
were wrapped in filter paper and transferred to the lab.
Leptopilina boulardi was the only parasitoid collected
from all locations. Partially inbred lines were set up
from each sampling site and 20 female wasps per population from early generations were frozen at -80Â°C for
genetic analysis.
DNA extraction

Five female wasps in four replications were pooled per
strain for DNA extraction using an adapted CTAB protocol for insects [27], including an extra RNase A step.
The quality of the extracted DNA was checked on a
0.8% agarose gel and its quantity measured by a spectrophotometer (ND-1000, http://www.nanodrop.com ). In
the case of low quantity or sheared DNA the DNA
extraction was repeated using five new females from the
same strain.
AFLP analysis

To assess the genetic diversity of the L. boulardi populations, we employed the Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphism (AFLP) technique [10] with a slight modification to the standard procedure. Approximately
500 ng of genomic DNA was incubated with EcoRI and
MseI enzymes (New England Biolabs:http://www.neb.
com). EcoRI/MseI adaptors were ligated to the restriction fragments. Preamplification was conducted using
EcoRI+A and Mse+C primers (Table 3). A touchdown
profile amplification during which the annealing temperature was dropped by 0.7Â°C in each cycle was used
to increase the optimal primer selectivity in this step.
Selective amplification was performed using one of three

respectively. Different combinations of these primers
resulted in 9 useful primer combinations (Table 4).
PCR products from the selective amplification were
purified run on a DNA sequencher MegaBACEâ¢ 1000
system (Amersham Pharmacia USA, http://www.gelifesciences.com/aptrix/upp01077.nsf/Content/life-sciences_
homepage at 10 kV for 75 min. The fluorescent profiles
were loaded into Fragment Profilerâ¢ software ver1.2
(Amersham, Biosciences, http://www.amersham.com)
using specific peak filters and were manually checked for
correct alignment of the size standard. The positions of
polymorphic markers between 80 and 500 bp were scored
and exported as a binary matrix in an excel sheet.
Amplification and sequence alignment for COI

A 638 bp portion of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I
(COI) gene was amplified for three individuals per strain
to evaluate the mitochondrial variation among the 11
Leptopilina boulardi populations from Iran. A L. boulardi population from Sospel (France) was used as outgroup. PCR amplification was performed using a
forward primer designed by Scheffer and Grissell [28],
COI-1775-F 5â-CGAATAAATAATATAAGATTTTG-3â
and a reverse primer designed for Leptopilina clavipes
(K. Kraaijeveld, unpublished), COI-2413-R, 5â-TCATCTAAAAATTTTAATCCCAGT-3 â . The amplification
was carried out on a Thermocycler PTC-2000 using the
following thermal cycles: 3 min at 92Â°C followed by a
touchdown with one degree drop in annealing temperature per cycle from 53-40Â°C (10 sec at 92Â°C, 10 sec at
53-40Â°C and 2 min at 72Â°C), then 25 cycles of 10 sec at
92Â°C,10 sec at 40Â°C and 2 min at 72Â°C, ending with 5
min extension at 72Â°C. Each PCR reaction contained 1.2
Î¼l of 2.5 mM DNTPs, 0.5 Î¼l of 10 Î¼M of each primer,
0.15 Î¼l of Taq DNA polymerase(5 U), 1.5 Î¼l of 10X Buffer and 0.45 Î¼l of 15 mM MgCl2 Î¼l; all Qiagen products
and was adjusted to 15 Î¼l with autoclaved nanopure
water. The PCR products were purified using Wizard
SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, http://
www.promega.com ) following the manufacturerâs protocol. The amplified bands were sequenced both forward
and reverse on MegaBACEâ¢ 1000 sequencher. The
Sequencher software Version 4.2 (Gene Codes Corp.)
was used to assemble the contigs and obtain consensus
sequences. The sequences were aligned using pairwisealignment in MacClade 4.08 [29] and edited manually.
Data analysis

Population structure was investigated using a molecular variance software package (AMOVA) and Fst statistics were estimated using ARLEQUIN software [30,31],

were calculated from the AFLP data using Nei and Liâs
index [32] in Treecon version 1.3b [33] for windows.
UPGMA cluster analysis [34] with 1000 replications of
bootstraps was performed in Treecon and genetic distances were visualized in a dendrogram format. The geographic distances between collecting sites were calculated
from their GPS locations and combined with the genetic
distance values into a pair-wise genetic and geographic
distance matrix. We set an indicator as isolated (1) or connected (0) for the isolation by unsuitable habitat in to 0/1
binary character matrix. Isolation by distance and geographical barrier was investigated with a partial Mantel test
[35] using the web-based program Isolation by distance
web service (IBDWS) [36] version 3.16. The combined
binary AFLP data matrix was used to perform Principal
Coordinate analysis (PCO) with GenAlex 6 [37] using Nei
and Liâs coefficient [32] for calculating similarities, three
first coordinates were used to graphically depict genetic
variation among populations.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Fst and P value for pair wise comparison of
populations. Below diagonal Fst value and above P value of pair wise
comparison of populations derived from AMOVA of AFLP results of
eleven populations of Leptopilina boulardi from Iran.
Additional file 2: Sampling points. Sampling points and their GPS
coordinates, climate zone and elevation above sea level.
