Abstract
Background: Smallpox is a lethal disease that was endemic in many parts of the world until
eradicated by massive immunization. Due to its lethality, there are serious concerns about its use
as a bioweapon. Here we analyze publicly available microarray data to further understand survival
of smallpox infected macaques, using systems biology approaches. Our goal is to improve the
knowledge about the progression of this disease.
Results: We used KEGG pathways annotations to define groups of genes (or modules), and
subsequently compared them to macaque survival times. This technique provided additional
insights about the host response to this disease, such as increased expression of the cytokines and
ECM receptors in the individuals with higher survival times. These results could indicate that these
gene groups could influence an effective response from the host to smallpox.
Conclusion: Macaques with higher survival times clearly express some specific pathways
previously unidentified using regular gene-by-gene approaches. Our work also shows how third
party analysis of public datasets can be important to support new hypotheses to relevant biological
problems.

Background
Large scale gene expression analysis with microarray technology is expanding and generating a large amount of
high quality, publicly available data. In the present work
we analyzed a dataset derived from monkeys infected by
smallpox, published by Rubins et al [1]. Smallpox is a
lethal disease that was endemic in many parts of the world
until eradicated by a massive immunization program

developed by the World Health Organization. Its fatality
rate was estimated to be 30%, and the survivors often had
disfiguring scars [2].
There are serious concerns about the use of smallpox as a
bioweapon [3,4]. Recently, some health care workers were
vaccinated by the UK government for the analysis of antibody responses [5]. Pox viruses display unique abilities to

interfere with the host immune system, producing
immune modulators [6] and there are at least 16 viral
genes involved in combating the host immune response
[7]. The original study's goal was to analyze the evolution
of the gene expression of the peripheral blood cells of variola-infected monkeys, so as to clarify the biological processes associated with host-pathogen interactions [1].
Among the important results was the absence of a TNF-α/
NF-κB-activated transcriptional mechanism during systemic infection, which could suggest that variola interaction with the mammalian host immune system may be
ablative to this response [6].
Given the importance of this dataset, we have analyzed
the data with systems biology approaches considering the
expression profiles of gene groups instead of individual
genes. These approaches are more powerful, less vulnerable to common experimental variation and usually more
advantageous for obtaining biologically meaningful
results.

Results and discussion
Active Modules
The goal of our analysis was to identify differentially
expressed modules in monkeys with early death, i.e., died
in the first three days, and monkeys with a later death (ED
and LD, respectively). Our hypothesis is that these modules play crucial roles in the host response to smallpox
infection. The gene groups were defined according to the
KEGG database (updated on 04/17/2006) [8], as
described in the Methods section.

Initially, this analysis was based on the ED and LD monkey groups using all KEGG Orthology (KO) categories (at
level 4), indicating three highly active modules in LD
monkeys: Cytokines and Cell Adhesion Molecules
(CAMs), which are consistent with the classical model of
immune and inflammatory responses, where an activation and proliferation of leukocytes take place. The Alzheimer's Disease module also appeared as differentially
activated, most likely due to its hybrid composition (20/
22 genes that compose the AD module are present in the
microarray platform used by Rubins et al [1], and 14/20
are also members of other modules).
In addition to the ED and LD analysis, modules were also
analyzed during the disease course. We have found 27
modules presenting differential activation in at least one
point (Figure 1). Several of those modules are related to
immune response, like CD molecules, CAM ligands, antigen processing and presentation and the previously considered activated in a late death Cytokines and Cell
adhesion molecules.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/38

A novel finding highlighted by our systems biology
approach for all macaques (Figure 1) was an altered
expression in the Natural Killer (NK) mediated cytotoxicity module. NK cells play a major role in the host-rejection
of virally infected cells. Due to their strong cytolytic activity and the potential for auto-reactivity, they are tightly
regulated. The activation of NK cells requires the action of
proinflammatory cytokines in combination with cell surface receptors [9]. Under normal conditions, inhibitory
NK cell receptors engage MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules.
Such inhibitory activity normally predominates over that
provided by the activating receptors, which bind to ligands expressed on virus-infected and other stressed cells
[10]. Cells with normal levels of MHC-I are generally protected from NK cell-mediated lysis. Virally infected cells
often express reduced levels of MHC-I and this inability to
engage the inhibitory receptors makes the cells susceptible
to NK cell attack [10]. The down regulation of Natural
killer cell mediated cytotoxicity module reported here
could indicate a susceptibility to a NK cell mediated lysis
(days 1–3, Figure 1).
The contributions of individual molecules for each significantly altered module are available in the additional
material [see Additional files 1 and 2], represented by
scores and the respective p-values.
Relevance Networks (RNs)
To understand the profiles of interaction between the
genes of the groups studied, we used a procedure known
as relevance networks (RNs), initially proposed by Butte
et al [11]. Interaction here represents significant correlation between two variables (i.e. molecules), which may
(but not necessarily will) physically interact with each
other.

Cytokines and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) modules
were highly expressed in LD monkeys in the early phase of
the infection (Figure 1) and were further explored in more
detail by using the RN approach. A metamodule (CAMs
and ECM receptors combined) was created to gain a better
understanding of leukocyte migration to the infection
locus. The connections between ICAM2 and ITGAV and
ITGA6 shows a significant change (p value < 10-3) when
comparing day 0 versus the earliest infection groups (days
1–3), see Figure 2A.
To establish a successful infection, pox viruses affect the
release of immune modulators by the infected cells, so it
is crucial to understand the dynamics of the host immune
system [6]. The population of the immune cells varies during the infection, as do their exposed membrane proteins.
Therefore, the Relevance Networks approach can reveal a
more detailed perspective on the dynamics of the molecules involved in the disease. A better assessment of the

variation of those molecules during the onset of the infection could give a better understanding of the host
response to smallpox, and ultimately of what may be the
key factors that set the 30% mortality rate.
To reach the infection focus and kill the pathogen, the
immune cells have to adhere and overpass the endothelium. These events are possible due to the interaction
between the integrins and the extra cellular matrix receptors and are modulated by cytokines. More specifically,
ESAM is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule and
ITGAV, ITGB1 and ITGB5 are integrins, which are het-

erodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an
alpha chain and a beta chain. ITGAV encodes an alpha
chain; ITGB1 and ITGB5 encode beta chain integrins,
known to participate in the cell-surface mediated signaling. ICAM2 is an intercellular adhesion molecule that promotes an inflammatory response and the activation of
AKT (a kinase). AKT phosphorylates components that
block the apoptosis pathway [12,13]. To explore further
the graphs produced by RNs for the ECM receptors +
CAMs the relations concerning ICAM2 and ESAM are
detailed. The complete network is available in the additional material [see Additional files 3 and 4]. RNs of day

and negative correlation values, respectively.

0 and days 1–3 show statistically significant alterations in
the interactions between ICAM2 and the integrins ITGAV
and ITGA6 (Figure 2A), which are important extracellular
matrix receptors, involved in the adhesion, migration, differentiation, survival and proliferation of cells and
cytoskeleton organization. Day 0 versus days 4–6 RNs
revealed a significant relation between ICAM2 and other
molecules that play crucial role in immune response
against pathogens, PLXNC1 [14] and CDH5 [15] (Figure
2B). The relevance networks produced for cytokine group
is available in the additional material [see Additional file
5].
ESAM shows a strong relation with ITGAV, ITGB1 and
ITGB5 with variable patterns along the time course of
infection. The quartet of ESAM, ITGAV, ITGB1 and ITGB5

reveals the relationship between alpha and beta chains in
the composition of integrins and the relation of such heterodimeric proteins with ESAM. It is worth mentioning
that ITGB3, ITGB6 and ITGB8, elements that interact with
ITGAV, are present in the microarray platform design, but
were excluded from analysis in the filtering steps (see
Methods section).
Active modules and the RNs results pointed out drastic
changes in the expression levels and interactions of
important genes involved in essential cellular processes of
the host response, such as cellular adhesion, apoptosis
and immune response. These results constitute interesting
new biological hypotheses about smallpox virus infection
that could be further explored by expert virology groups.

Overlapping with Rubins et al and Jahrling et al
The data analyzed in our manuscript was previously analyzed by Rubins et al [1] and Jahrling et al [16]. The former
focused on the microarray data and the later on the clinical findings. Rubins et al [1] reported the expression profile in IFN response, cell cycle/proliferation response,
TNF-α/NF-κB regulated genes, dose response and lymphocyte and Ig responses. Meanwhile Jahrling et al [16]
discuss the hemorrhagic diathesis, cytokines activation
(IL6, IL8, INFG, CCL2 and CCL4) and lymphocyte depletion.

Rubins et al [1] performed a detailed analysis of IFN
response genes. The KEGG module of cytokines includes
IL6, IL8, IFN -α, -β and -γ, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP1β),
TNF-α and NF – κB. The influence of each molecule in the
modules activation was also computed [see Additional
files 1 and 2]. Once KEGG separates the molecules into
functional classes, it is not possible to define cascading
effects, like Rubins et al did [1]. Despite this fact, we manually compiled a module with the IFN-responsive genes
detailed by Rubins et al [1] (in Figure 2A). For the ED and
LD analysis, this module is significantly down regulated
in monkeys that died early and up regulated in those
which died later (see Methods for details). In addition, for
the time course analysis, the IFN-responsive module is
down regulated for day 0 and up regulated for days 1–3
and inactive for the other days (data not shown). Therefore, our results suggest that activation of IFN-responsive
genes may play an important role in a successful immune
response upon infection, as previously reported by Rubins
et al [1].
The decrease in the relative abundance of B cells and MHC
II reported by Rubins et al [1] are corroborated by the profile of module Antigen processing and presentation (Figure 1). The Cell cycle, Complement and coagulation
cascades, Cytokines and Hematopoietic cell lineage modules identified here were also reported by Rubins et al [1]
as differentially expressed using gene by gene approaches.
Altered D-dimer levels were interestingly investigated by
Jahrling et al [16], which reflect the serious influence of
smallpox virus inhibitors in the complement and coagulation cascades. Our active modules are also in agreement
with such findings. Our results suggest an unbalanced
cytokine levels, which is strongly associated with sepsis
and organ failure death in infected animals.
In addition, we have also observed alterations in the
hematopoietic cell lineage module which could be a consequence of the influx of immature leukocytes into the
bloodstream, particularly neutrophils (aka "left shift",
using medical jargon).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/38

Rubins et al [1] observed a considerable depletion of T
cells, and a large number of apoptotic cells in the splenic
periarterial lymphatic sheath, possibly due to the viral
replication in antigen presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, which could lead to apoptosis in the lymphocytes.
The lysis of vulnerable cells induced by NK cells
(described earlier) and the down regulation of the NK cell
mediated cytotoxicity module supports such hypothesis.

Conclusion
The usage of active modules pointed out the major role of
the cytokines and ECM receptors in an effective host
response. We have also pointed out that the population of
the ECM receptors and cytokines significantly changes
during the infection, possible due to a host response to
eliminate the virus. In order to have a closer perspective of
the dynamics of the molecules involved in this response
we used the Relevance Networks. Despite the need of an
experimental validation of these new biological hypotheses, one of our goals was to exemplify and stress the
importance of public microarray datasets analysis by
using different and novel bioinformatics models and thus
expand knowledge and information about important biological problems.

Methods
Data description
In this work we used cDNA microarray data containing
37,632 elements that represents approximately 11,000
unique genes and approximately 12,000 genes without
identification [1,17]. The slides were produced with
human cDNA clones and the test samples were extracted
from primate models (cynomolgus macaques). The samples of interest were always labeled with Cy5 and the reference samples were labeled with Cy3. The original
dataset was obtained from the SMD [18,19] and is associated with the Experimenter and ExptDate keys
"KRUBINS" and "2001-08-05", respectively. In this work,
only data associated to studies 1 (Harper or India 7124
variola strains through a combination of aerosol exposure
[5 × 108 plaque-forming units (pfu)] and high-titer i.v.
inoculation [109 pfu]) and 2 (India 7124 strain via i.v.
route alone [109 pfu]) [1] were used. Our goal is to analyze the host response to a successful infection; therefore
the third study (varied viral dose) data was not used here.

The raw data was submitted to exploratory analyses. The
main problem found was a bias of log ratio values from
left to right in the majority of the chips, see Figure 3A. To
address this problem, we used a normalization procedure
proposed by Futschik and Crompton [20] known as
OLIN. The OLIN method has some clear advantages: (i) it
relies on strong statistical formalism; (ii) has the capacity
to remove spatial and intensity (systematic) errors in
microarray data, which is the main problem we found in

the original dataset; (iii) Futschick and Crompton [20]
precisely addressed the importance of optimization of
model parameters on microarray data normalization
(instead of simply accepting the method default values);
(iv) the method performance was conveniently compared
to other proposed methods [20]. Basically, the effect of
log ratio values in relation to mean expression values (M
and A, respectively) was is estimated using LOWESS
regression [21]with an optimization step for the selection
of the parameter αA that control the smoothing of the
regression. Subsequently, a new LOWESS regression was
performed with log ratio values based on the x and y directions on the slide, and again, the optimization step of the
parameters αx and αy was performed. This model successfully corrected the spatial-dependent artifact observed in
the dataset (Figure 3B). Also, in a filtering step, we used
only spots with signal intensity greater than background
intensity in any sample and all spots with signal intensity
greater than 2.5 times background intensity in 80% of the
samples.

Active modules
In order to find significantly altered gene groups we used
the "active modules" approach, originally proposed by
Segal et al [22]. The rationale of this method is to evaluate
differential activation or repression of gene modules,
which represent the biological processes.

The first step was to organize the data in a matrix Eij, i =
1,...,ns, j = 1,...,nl, where eij represents the gene i in the sample j. In the present study, 199 groups were selected
according to the level 4 of KEGG [8] (updated on 04/17/
2006) [see Additional file 6], so each group has ng genes,
g = 1,...,199.
After the data normalization described earlier, expression
values were standardized by subtracting the average
expression calculated over all the arrays. This process
adjusted the mean values of each gene to zero, which were
then used to build a discrete version of Eij, named Eij*, by
applying the indicator function eij* = I(eij ≥ 1) - I(eij≤-1) for
all i and j (an indicator function assumes value 0 or 1 for
false or true, respectively). Thus, Eij* is a matrix where

Page 6 of 9

BMC Systems Biology 2007, 1:38

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/38

each element can assume the discrete values 1 (induction), 0 (equal expression) or -1(repression).
Using the matrix Eij* the following operations are performed:
ns

(
i =1

∗
q1 j = ∑ I eij = 1

)

ns

(
i =1

)

∗
q2 j = ∑ I eij = −1 .

For each of the g groups of interest, each array j was then
splitted in two disjoint sets of genes: one with exactly the
ng elements of the group, and other constituted by the
remaining ns-ng genes. One should also consider two random variables Y1j (g) and Y2j (g) representing the number of
induced genes in the first and second group, respectively.
Under the null hypothesis of no biological activity for g in
sample j, Segal et al [22] propose that Y1j (g)~hypergeometric(ng; ns-ng; q1j) and Y2j (g)~hypergeometric(ng; ns-ng; q2j).
Intuitively, the absence of biological activity makes the
probability of an induced (or repressed) gene to belong to
the first group equal to 1/2 and p-values associated with
the observed values y1j (g) and y2j (g) can be easily calculated. This procedure defined a new matrix Pgj where the
element pgj represents the fraction of induced genes of
group g in the array j, or zero for the non-significant modules (we assumed a significance level α = 0.05). In the
cases where the significance is for the repressed genes, we
just made the fraction pgj negative. The arrays were then
categorized in biological types t = 1,, t and for each pair of
gene set g and biological type t, we count the number of
arrays of type t that showed gene set g induced
(repressed). We then used the hypergeometric distribution to classify each gene group as significantly induced or
repressed across the biological types (p value < 0.05).
The biological types are defined as following: nt = 1 means
that the macaque was not infected, nt = 2 means death 1
to 3 days after infection, nt = 3 means death 4 to 6 days
after infection and nt = 4 means death after the 6th day. nt
= 2 was also labeled Early Death (ED) and nt = 3 and nt =
4 were labeled Late Death (LD). The contribution of molecules for activation of a significantly altered module was
computed for time course and "ED and LD" analyses [see
Additional files 1 and 2]. Using these values, it is possible
to evaluate the influence of each gene in the module activation or repression (p-value).

relationships. Interaction here is inferred by significant
correlation between two variables (i.e. molecules), which
may (but not necessarily do) physically interact with each
other. Aiming to identify such correlations, the Relevance
Networks (RN) method, initially proposed by Butte et al
[11], was employed. The method computes the squared
2

linear Pearson correlation coefficient, rij , between all
gene pairs for each biological type (as described in the
active modules section of methods), defining a fully connected graph. Using a re-sampling method, the algorithm
estimates a cut-off value, c, to split the graph into small
2

sub-graphs where rij > c. These sub-graphs are the relevance networks (RNs).
In order to identify significant differences between two
RNs, we adapted this method to contrast two distinct conditions. Therefore, the linear Pearson correlation coeffi1
cients between every pair of genes in each condition, rij

2

and rij are computed and then a Fisher's Z-transformation [23] is used to translate the probability distribution
2
1
of the random variable rij - rij into an approximated

standard normally distributed random variable, which
permits the identification of pairs of genes that displayed
1
significant (positive or negative) differences between rij

2

and rij (p < 0.001). This type of analysis was accomplished for the 199 gene groups used in the active modules procedure, linking the findings with biological
knowledge.

interaction and includes also functional or phylogenetic
