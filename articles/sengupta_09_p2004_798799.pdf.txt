Background
India is experiencing a rapid and extensive spread of HIV1 and has entered the third stage of epidemic in many
urban areas. Majority of HIV infection has been reported
to occur through heterosexual contact except in few states,
where it occurs through sharing of contaminated needles
and syringes among Injecting Drug Users (IDU).

Methods
In order to characterize HIV-1 strains among IDUs and
Female Sex Workers (FSW), peptide-EIA, Heteroduplex
Mobility Assay (HMA), Multi-region Hybridization Assay
(MHA), DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were
conducted. Recombinants were detected by simplot analysis. HIV seropositive samples were used to amplify gag,
env, nef and tat genes by nested polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to determine the HIV-1 subtypes.

env genes. The US-B strain was detected for the first time
in Calcutta with respect to both env and nef genes and
more interestingly C/US-B recombinants were also
detected based on both the genes.

Conclusion
Emergence of HIV-1 recombinants in both Eastern and
North-eastern India, especially among the IDU population has been observed. Continuous monitoring is under
progress in our laboratory to see whether any Circulating
Recombinant Form (CRF) of HIV-1 is evolving in India.

Results
Subtype C was found as the major strain among IDUs in
North-eastern India along with subtype Thai-B. Phylogenetic analysis showed 89% of samples (25/28) infected
with subtype C for both gag (p24-p7) and env (C2–V3)
genes. But, 11% (3/28) showed subtype discordance
where the presence of intersubtype recombination
between C and Thai-B was detected. However, IDUs from
Eastern part of India showed the only prevalence of subtype C based on gag, env and tat genes. The p17 gene
encoding HIV-1 matrix protein was analyzed among FSWs
in Calcutta and when compared with other Indian and
global C-strains, it clearly revealed a different cluster of
Indian sequences. Same result was obtained for gag and
