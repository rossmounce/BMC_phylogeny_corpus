Abstract
Background: Lentiviruses such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV)
undergo continual evolution in the host. Previous studies showed that the late-stage variants of SIV
that evolve in one host replicate to significantly higher levels when transmitted to a new host.
However, it is unknown whether HIVs or SIVs that have higher replication fitness are more
genetically stable upon transmission to a new host. To begin to address this, we analyzed the
envelope sequence variation of viruses that evolved in animals infected with variants of SIVMne that
had been cloned from an index animal at different stages of infection.
Results: We found that there was more evolution of envelope sequences from animals infected
with the late-stage, highly replicating variants than in animals infected with the early-stage, lower
replicating variant, despite the fact that the late virus had already diversified considerably from the
early virus in the first host, prior to transmission. Many of the changes led to the addition or shift
in potential-glycosylation sites-, and surprisingly, these changes emerged in some cases prior to the
detection of neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting that other selection mechanisms may be
important in driving virus evolution. Interestingly, these changes occurred after the development
of antibody whose anti-viral function is dependent on Fc-Fcγ receptor interactions.
Conclusion: SIV variants that had achieved high replication fitness and escape from neutralizing
antibodies in one host continued to evolve upon transmission to a new host. Selection for viral
variants with glycosylation and other envelope changes may have been driven by both neutralizing
and Fcγ receptor-mediated antibody activities.

Background
Lentiviruses such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) are notorious
for their extensive genetic variation, and for their rapid
diversification within a single host [1]. In part, this diversification is due to the virus' rapid rate of replication and
the high error rate of reverse transcription. However, there
is also evidence that viruses evolve under selection pressure to both evade the host immune response and to
achieve higher levels of replication fitness. Variants that
emerge at later stages of infection tend to be more pathogenic than those found earlier, and there is some indication that virus diversification may reach a plateau late in
infection [2]. It is unclear to what extent genetic variation
of lentiviruses such as SIV and HIV is influenced by the
properties of the infecting strain, the level of replication,
or the immune response to the virus. It is also not known
whether viruses that have achieved high fitness in one
host continue to diversify following transmission to a new
host.
The SIV/macaque model is an appealing system for examining lentiviral evolution over the course of infection
because the sequence of the infecting virus and the time of
infection are defined [3-5]. In previous studies, we investigated virus evolution in pig-tailed macaques infected
with a cloned virus, SIVMneCL8 [6-8]. These analyses
were focused on the envelope gene because it encodes the
surface unit (SU) glycoprotein, which plays a key role in
viral entry and is a target of both humoral and cellular
responses [9]. These early SIV studies showed that variation occurred primarily in previously defined hypervariable domains of envelope, especially the first variable region
(V1). In particular, there was a notable accumulation of
potential N- and O-linked glycosylation sites [8]. Biochemical studies showed that these amino acid changes
were, in fact, targets for the addition of carbohydrates and
that such glycosylation changes allowed the virus to
escape the neutralizing antibodies directed against the
parental, infecting cloned virus, SIVMneCL8 [6,7]. Similar
changes in glycosylation sites in SU over the course of
infection have since been noted in both in the SHIV/
macaque model [10-12] and in HIV-1 infection in
humans [13,14].
To examine properties of viruses that emerge later in infection, prototype variants of SIVMneCL8 that evolved in
infected animals at intermediate and late stages of infection were isolated and characterized [6,7,15,16].
SIVMneCL8 itself has characteristics that are similar to
variants found early in HIV-1 infection of humans – it is
macrophage-tropic, neutralization sensitive, and causes
an infection with viral replication levels typical of HIV-1
infection in humans [7,16]. The prototype intermediatestage virus, SIVMne35wkSU, differs from SIVMneCL8 at

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

only four amino acid positions, all in V1, each of which
are sites for carbohydrate modifications [6,7]. This intermediate-stage virus has escaped neutralizing antibodies
directed against the infecting virus, SIVMneCL8 [7].
Molecular clones representing later viruses from both
blood (SIVMne170) and lymph node (SIVMne027) are
also antigenically distinct from the 'early' virus,
SIVMneCL8, and they are more cytopathic in both primary T-lymphocytes and T-cell lines [15,16].
Animals infected with intermediate- and late-stage variants had approximately100-fold and 3,000-fold higher
plasma RNA levels at set-point, respectively, than animals
infected with the parental, early virus [17]. Moreover, animals that were infected with the intermediate and latestage variants did not show evidence of having elicited
neutralizing antibodies to the autologous virus at 24
weeks post-infection [17]. However, it is unknown
whether antibodies that can neutralize the intermediateand late-stage variants developed at later times in infection, perhaps at levels that would not have been detected
in previous studies where a relatively stringent 90% cut off
was applied to define neutralization. Nor was there any
information on non-neutralizing antibody activities, such
as those mediated by Fc-Fcγ receptor (FcγR) interactions,
which is detected early and that correlates with the decline
in viremia during acute HIV infection [18].
Given that the intermediate and late-stage variants replicated to high levels in these animals in the apparent
absence of a neutralizing antibody response, we wondered whether the viruses continued to evolve in a manner similar to that observed for SIVMneCL8. To begin to
define how the fitness of the infecting virus strains affects
subsequent viral diversification in the host, we analyzed
sequence variation of the V1–V3 region of envelope over
time in the animals infected with early-, intermediate- and
late-stage viruses. We also assessed the neutralizing antibody response at later times in infection and examined
associations between antibody responses, viral load, and
virus diversification. In addition, we examined antibodydependent virus inhibition (ADCVI) activity, an FcγRdependent antibody response, that we hypothesized
could play a role at earlier stages of infection based on
findings in HIV-1-infected humans [18].

Results
Intermediate and late-stage SIV variants continue to
diverge upon transmission to a new host
In a previous study, SIV variants were isolated from an
infected animal at early, intermediate, and late stages of
infection, and these sequential variants were used to infect
a new set of macaques [17]. To evaluate the evolution of
SIV variants upon transmission to a new host, we compared envelope (env) V1–V3 sequences from each of two

animals infected with the early (SIVMneCL8), intermediate (SIVMne35wkSU) and late-stage (SIVMne170 and
SIVMne027) variants. We cloned V1–V3 env sequences
from PBMC DNA from two times post-infection, 40 weeks
and approximately 75 weeks (71–77 weeks depending on
the sample available), both of which were after the
immune response to the virus had a chance to develop,
but before most of the animals had overt AIDS. To avoid
resampling bias, we obtained a total of 8–12 clones from
2–3 independent low-copy PCRs from each sample. We
examined a median of 16 sequences per animal per time
point (range 10–42).
A phylogenetic tree was generated from all unique
sequences from all animals (Figure 1). In general,
sequences from animals that were infected with the same

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

initial variant clustered together. Within these clusters,
sequences from the same animal grouped together (not
labeled). Sequences from animals infected with
SIVMneCL8 tended to be less divergent than sequences
from animals infected with SIVMne35wkSU, which were
less divergent than sequences from animals infected with
SIVMne170 and SIVMne027. As an exception, some
sequences from an SIVMneCL8-infected animal grouped
with the SIVMne35wkSU sequences; while we cannot rule
out contamination, this could also be the result of convergent evolution.
For each animal, we calculated the average diversity and
the average divergence from the infecting clone for
sequences sampled at both 40 and ~75 weeks post-infection. For purposes of comparison, we grouped the results

of the animals infected with the two different late-stage
variants together, as animals infected with both late-stage
viruses had similar viral loads (Table 1) and disease
course [17]. As shown in Table 1, at week 40 the average
SIV sequence diversity in animals infected with the early
variant, SIVMneCL8, (0.39%) was lower than that in animals infected with either the intermediate variant
(1.20%) or the late variants (1.05%). At ~75 weeks after
infection, a similar trend was observed, and diversity has
increased in all groups. At this time, the average diversity
was 0.96% in animals infected with the early variant,
1.39% in animals infected with the intermediate variant,
and 1.69% in animals infected with the late variants. We
also calculated the divergence of each SIV sequence from
the infecting variant at both 40 and ~75 weeks post-infection, as shown in Figure 2. At 40 weeks, the average divergence was 0.20% for animals infected with the early
variant, 0.71% for animals infected with the intermediate

variant, and 0.94% for animals infected with the late variants. At ~75 weeks, the average divergences had increased
to 0.60%, 1.17%, and 1.44%, respectively. We assessed
whether the extent of virus evolution was significantly
higher in animals infected with the late variants
(SIVMne170 and SIVMne027) compared to animals
infected with SIVMneCL8 using a Mann-Whitney U test.
At 40 weeks post-infection, there was a trend for increased
diversity in animals infected with the late variants (p =
0.07), while at ~75 weeks post-infection, this relationship
was not significant (p = 0.17). At both 40 and ~75 weeks
post-infection, there was a trend for increased divergence
in animals infected with the late variants (p = 0.06 and p
= 0.07, respectively).
We were interested in determining whether the nucleotide
changes that arose in animals infected with the intermediate and late variants reflected continued diversification or

reversion towards a more ancestral state [19]. We calculated the average divergence from the SIVMneCL8
sequence for sequences from each animal at both 40 and
~75 weeks post-infection. The infecting clone
SIVMne35wkSU is 0.8% divergent from SIVMneCL8, and
animals infected with this variant had an average divergence from SIVMneCL8 of 1.41% at week 40 and 1.76%
at week ~75. The infecting clones SIVMne170 and
SIVMne027 are 2.56% and 2.70% divergent from
SIVMneCL8, respectively; animals infected with these
clones had average divergences of 2.65% and 3.18% from
SIVMneCL8 at week 40 and 3.44% and 3.45% at week
~75. Thus, we did not observe any general reversion
towards the ancestral SIVMneCL8 sequence. As shown in
Figure 3, we observed several specific amino acid positions in the majority of sequences from animals infected
with SIVMne170 that reverted to the amino acid present
in SIVMneCL8. For example, position 120 was a K in
SIVMneCL8 and an R in SIVMne170, and reverted to a K
in animal J94233 (19/27 sequences). Position 137 was a
T in SIVMneCL8 and an I in SIVMne170, and reverted to
a T in most sequences from animal F94393 (13/22
sequences), and was highly variable in J94233. Overall,
however, virus populations continued to diverge, and the
average divergence from SIVMneCL8 was in fact greater in
animals infected with late variants compared to animals
infected with SIVMneCL8, although there was only a
trend for statistical significance (Mann-WhitneyU test, p =
0.06 for week 40, p = 0.07 for week ~75).
Intermediate and late variants have higher
nonsynonymous divergence
Because the intermediate and late-stage variants replicate
to higher levels than SIVMneCL8, they could achieve a
higher level of diversity and divergence due to the random
accumulation of changes throughout many rounds of
virus replication. To determine whether the increased
virus evolution observed among animals infected with the
intermediate and late variants was due to random accumulation of changes or selection, we calculated the ratio
of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS)
between each sequence and the infecting variant using
SNAP http://www.hiv.lanl.gov[20]. As shown in Table 1,
the average dN/dS ratio was <1 for animals infected with
SIVMneCL8 at both 40 and ~75 weeks post-infection
(0.16 and 0.81 respectively), indicating purifying selection. By contrast, the dN/dS ratio was close to or higher
than 1 for animals infected with the intermediate and late
variants, indicating a lack of selection or in some cases evidence for positive selection. We evaluated whether the
average dN/dS ratio was significantly higher among animals infected with the late variants (SIVMne170 and
SIVMne027) compared to animals infected with
SIVMneCL8. We found a trend for significance at 40 weeks

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

(Mann-Whitney p = 0.06) and no association at ~75
weeks (Mann-Whitney p = 0.24).
We also separately evaluated the nonsynonymous and
synonymous divergence of each sequence compared to
the infecting variant. For each animal, we calculated the
average nonsynonymous divergence and synonymous
divergence in the envelope sequences. At 40 weeks post
infection, envelope sequences from animals infected with
the late variants had marginally significantly greater nonsynonymous divergence than animals infected with the
early variant (Mann-Whitney p = 0.06), however there
was no difference in synonymous divergence (MannWhitney p = 0.16). At ~75 weeks post infection, the difference in both nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence was marginally significant (Mann-Whitney p =
0.06). Together, these results indicate that difference in
virus evolution between animals infected with the latestage variants versus early-stage variants can not be
explained entirely by a higher level of error-prone virus
replication.
Intermediate and late variants evolve more changes in
length and glycosylation sites
We next compared specific sequence features that may be
associated with adaptive evolution: length variation and
changes in potential glycosylation sites. We calculated the
length of the env V1–V3 region for each sequence and
determined the number of sequences from each animal
that differed in length from the infecting variant (data not
shown). For animals infected with the early variant, there
was no length variation at 40 weeks and little length variation at ~75 weeks (7% in one animal). Some animals
infected with the intermediate and late variants also had
no length variation, while others demonstrated extensive
variation (up to 80% in one animal). Although animals
infected with the late variants had more length variation
than animals infected with the early variant, this difference was not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney p =
0.14).

We calculated the percent of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) that were added, deleted or shifted to an
adjacent residue. In the animals infected with the early
and intermediate-stage variants, no PNGS changes were
detected at 40 weeks post-infection; in the late-stage virusinfected, 0.7% to 9.4% varied. We saw the same pattern at
~75 weeks after infection, when 0.4% to 2.2% of the
PNGS varied in sequences from animals infected with the
early-stage virus and 2.2% to 15.1% varied in the
sequences from the animals infected with late-stage variants.
Because most of the amino acid differences that we
observed were in the V1 region, we performed a more

Page 7 of 15

Virology Journal 2008, 5:90

detailed analysis of this region. We compared the amino
acid sequences of all the unique variants detected at 40
and ~75 weeks PI to the sequence of the infecting variant
(Figure 3). Extensive variation in V1 was evident as early
as 40 weeks PI in some animals, including changes that
would be predicted to create sites of N and O-linked glycosylation. In general, we observed very little variation in
the animals infected with SIVMneCL8 compared to animals infected with the intermediate and late variants.
There were several common changes that were present in
viruses from animals infected with the late-stage variants.
There was a shift in a potential N-linked glycosylation site
(PNGS; a sequence of NxT/S) from position 114 to 116
(positions are based on the sequence of SIVMneCL8 envelope surface unit) in viruses from all the animals infected
with SIVMne027 and SIVMne170. However, this shift in
PNGS from 114 to 116 was not detected in any of the variants from animals infected with either early or intermediate-stage virus. In animals infected with SIVMne170, there
was an additional shift in PNGS from position 146 to 148.
There was also considerable variation in the mid region of
V1, between the two variable PNGS noted above, particularly in animals infected with SIVMne170. This is a region
of V1 in which we previously identified sites of O-linked
glycoslyation [6]. In virus from animals infected with
SIVMne170, there were a number of changes to threonine
and to a lesser extent, to serine, further enriching this
region within the center of V1 with potential targets for Olinked carbohydrates. Interestingly, relatively few changes
in SIVMne027 were to serine and threonine, perhaps
reflecting the fact that the infecting parental virus,
SIVMne027 had the highest number of serine and threonines in this region (N = 11) relative to the other infecting viruses (N = 7–9). In contrast, there were more serine
and threonine changes in viruses from animals infected
with SIVMne35wkSU, a virus with lower density of these
amino acids in the infecting virus (N = 9). Surprisingly,
there were relatively few changes in V1 in animals infected
with SIMneCL8, which had the fewest initial serine/threonine (N = 7), except in three clones from one animal
(J95155) at 77 weeks. These changes at 77 weeks, which
included 4 additional serine/threonine (in addition to a
threonine to create the PNGS at 146), created a cluster of
residues reminiscent of those that evolved to create the
SIVMne35wkSU variant in another animal infected with
SIVMneCL8 [5].
Neutralizing antibody (NtAb) responses develop later in
animals infected with late-stage variants
The extensive variation within V1 in animals infected with
the intermediate and late-stage variants was unexpected
because we could not detect any SIV-specific neutralizing
antibodies against the infecting virus at 24 weeks post-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

infection in any of the macaques infected with these variants (<90% neutralization at 1:4). In contrast, both
macaques infected with the early-stage virus, SIVMneCL8,
generated neutralizing antibodies at levels typical of
SIVMne infections (>90% neutralization at 1:64) during
that same period [17].
To understand the kinetics of NtAb responses in each of
the infected monkeys, we assessed sera taken from various
times after infection for neutralization activity against the
inoculating virus, using a cell line TZM-bl [21] that
expresses CD4 and CCR5 and that is highly susceptible to
infection by all the SIVMne variants (not shown). For
comparison, we also examined neutralization using the
sMAGI indicator cells [6], which express CD4 and endogenous coreceptor, because we had used these cells for neutralization assays in our previous study [17]. The
neutralization activity was measured as the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50), which is the reciprocal of sera
dilution that is required to inhibit viral infection by 50%.
As shown in Figure 4a, both monkeys infected with
SIVMneCL8 developed comparable NtAb kinetics, which
peaked as early as 16–20 weeks post-infection, with
potent IC50 titers around 1,000 using the TZM-bl cell
assay. After the initial peak, the NtAb IC50 titers against the
infecting virus were maintained at ~100. The
SIVMne35wkSU-infected monkeys had much lower IC50
NtAb titers (Figure 4b) than SIVMneCL8-infected monkeys, and there was no NtAb detected before 40 weeks
post-infection. Similarly, neither SIVMne170-infected
monkey had detectable NtAbs before 40 weeks post-infection. However, the NtAb titer was relatively high (IC50 of
431) at 40 weeks post-infection in monkey F94393, and
subsequently declined (IC50s of 65 – 99) after 40 weeks
post-infection. The second SIVMne170-infected animal,
J94233, had a low but detectable NtAb responses at 40
and 77.5 weeks PI (Figure 4c). The NtAb responses in both
SIVMne027-infected monkeys were comparable and
peaked at 52 weeks post-infection (IC50s of 1,161 and
1,278; Figure 4d).
The average NtAb IC50 was not significantly higher for animals infected with the late variants (SIVMne170 and

IC50 was also not significantly different (Mann-Whitney p

0.06). The contemporaneous NtAb IC50 was not associated with virus evolution at either 40 weeks or ~75 weeks

The peak NtAb IC50 was also not associated with viral
load set point (Spearman's rho = 0.61, p = 0.15).
Because we did not detect NtAb through 24 weeks PI in
some animals in our previous study using the sMAGI cells
as targets for infection [17], but we did detect responses at
later times using the TZM-bl cells here, we also examined
neutralization by sera at different times post-infection
using sMAGI cells. In general, the IC50 titers determined
using sMAGI cells were lower than those determined
using TZM-bl cells. For example, the neutralization titers
were at least several-fold, and in some cases more than 10fold lower in the sera of SIVMneCL8-infected animals at

almost every time point tested. There were also notable
differences in the IC50 values using these two cell lines for
the animal 94393 infected with SIVMne170 (Figure 4c),
but not for either animal infected with SIVMne027 (Figure 4d). The IC50 values were also consistently higher for
animals infected with SIVMneCL8 throughout the course
of infection, particularly at the earliest time points, using
the TZM-bl cells as targets for infection. In contrast, NtAb
responses were low to absent up through 24 weeks PI in
animals infected with the intermediate- and late-stage variants using both sMAGI and TZM-bl cells.

ADCVI antibody activity is detected in all animals
Previous studies have shown that ADCVI antibodies,
which inhibit virus in the presence of Fcγ receptor-bearing
effector cells, can be detected very early in acute HIV infection[18]. To determine whether ADCVI antibody was
present prior to the evolution of potential sites for N- and
O-linked glycosylation in animals infected with the different variants, we examined these antibodies in plasma
samples taken at 4, 7 and 16 weeks PI infection in animals
infected with SIVMneCL8, SIVMne35wkSU and
SIVMne170 (Figure 5). In all animals, greater than 50%
inhibition by plasma at a dilution of 1:100 could be
detected by 7 weeks PI, and greater than 80% was detected
by 16 weeks PI. There was very little difference in the timing or magnitude of this activity in animals infected with
the different variants, suggesting that all three infecting
viruses were capable of eliciting ADCVI antibodies.

Discussion
This study is the first to directly compare the evolution of
primate lentiviral variants from different stages of infection after they were transmitted to a new host. This analysis focused on envelope diversification in animals infected
with molecularly cloned SIVs from early, intermediate
and late stages of infection in the index animal. Surprisingly, the highest amount of diversity and divergence
from the parental strain was observed in animals infected
with the late-stage viruses, despite the fact that this infecting virus had already been selected for fitness and persistence in the first animal. In all measures of sequence
evolution we analyzed and at each time point, virus evolution was highest in animals infected with the late-stage
virus compared to the early-stage virus. The primary limitation of this study was the small number of animals
included (2 animals were infected with the early-stage variant, two with the intermediate-stage variant, and four
with the late-stage variants). However, despite the small
sample size, many of the differences that we observed in
virus evolution and neutralizing antibody response
approached statistical significance. Envelope variation,
including changes in glycosylation, was detected in some
cases prior to the detection of neutralizing antibodies, but
after the development of an ADCVI antibody response.
The late variants replicate to higher levels than the early
virus and thus undergo more rounds of error-prone
reverse transcription. However, this increased replication
is not likely to completely explain the higher envelope
diversification of the late-stage viruses because the dN/dS
ratio was higher among animals infected with intermediate and late-stage viruses compared to animals infected
with the early virus, at least at 40 weeks post-infection. In
addition, there was greater nonsynonymous divergence
but not synonymous divergence in animals infected with
the intermediate and late variants. Finally, animals

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

infected with intermediate and late variants had more
length changes and more changes in potential glycosylation sites.
We observed that the virus populations in these animals
continued to evolve away from the ancestral SIVMneCL8
strain, rather than reverting to an ancestral state. Reversion has been observed in other studies of SIV [22,23] and
HIV [19,24]. However, in these studies, reversion was generally observed at earlier times in infection than was
examined in this study. Furthermore, ours was the only
study to compare virus evolution with respect to a known,
cloned ancestor, SIVMneCL8, allowing us to examine
reversion to known ancestral sequences, rather than predicted sequences.
There were some common changes among viruses from
different animals, particularly those infected with the latestage variants. These included shifts in PNGS at both the
N (114–116) and C terminus (146–148) of the V1
domain. While the shift at the N terminus was found in all
four animals infected with the late-stage variants, such a
shift was not detected in any of the variants from animals
infected with either early or intermediate-stage virus, suggesting the advantage of this PNGS may be context
dependent. There was no C-terminal PNGS in the original
parental SIVMneCL8, but a PNGS was present in the intermediate and late-stage variants. Previous biochemical
analyses have verified that the predicted glycosylation site
in the C-terminus of V1 is indeed a target of carbohydrate
addition [6]. The changes between these two PNGS
included several that would be predicted to add sites for
O-linked carbohydrates; in all animals, variants evolved
that had almost half of the amino acids in this mid region
of V1 as serine and threonine. In general there tended to
be more changes of this type in viruses from animals
infected with a variants that had fewer serines or threonines initially.
In previous studies, we showed that at 24 weeks PI, NtAb
were detectable in SIVMneCL8-infected animals, but not
animals infected with the intermediate or late-stage
viruses. The present studies, which include additional follow-up, showed that animals infected with the late-stage
variants did eventually develop NtAb, and in some cases,
at titers comparable to those of SIVMneCL8-infected animals. There was some variation in the magnitude of the
NtAb response depending on the assay that was used –
TZM-bl or sMAGI cells. In general, the assays gave qualitatively similar results, although values with TZM-bl assay
were almost always higher and more so with sera from
some animals versus others. It is not clear why there were
quantitative differences in these assays that appear
dependent on the virus and serum combination tested,
but it could reflect differences in the coreceptor used for

Page 11 of 15

Virology Journal 2008, 5:90

entry in the two cell lines: CCR5 for TZM-bl cells and an
unknown coreceptor for sMAGI cells [25].
In animals infected with the late-stage variants, NtAb
responses were delayed, with peak responses at 40–52
weeks in animals infected with late-stage variants versus
16–20 weeks in animals infected with the early virus. In
general, NtAb responses were poor in animals infected
with the intermediate virus, although low levels could be
detected starting at 40–60 weeks. Thus, it is possible that
neutralizing antibody responses to the intermediate and
late-stage viruses, which have a higher density of glycosylation sites in V1, are delayed due to the fact that key
epitopes are shielded by carbohydrates. The fact that
responses eventually develop suggests that this shield is
not impenetrable.
There was no obvious relationship between the extent of
virus variation and the timing or magnitude of NtAb
response. For example, as noted, animals infected with
SIVMnCL8 had the earliest peak NtAb responses, but
showed little divergence and diversity at either 40 or ~75
weeks after infection. Animals infected with the intermediate and late-stage variants had later peak NtAb
responses, but demonstrated considerable virus evolution
before this peak, at 40 weeks after infection. The magnitude of the NtAb response was not associated with either
virus evolution or viral load at 40 or ~75 weeks after infection.
The peak NtAb response was also not associated with the
viral load set point. This is in contrast to findings in one
study of chronically HIV-infected humans, where there
was a negative correlation between NtAb responses to
autologous virus and viral load [26]. It is worth noting
that this association was observed when examining contemporaneous virus and antibody and from variable
times in infection using a cross sectional study design. In
contrast, our study specifically examined NtAb response
to the infecting virus and the relationship of these NtAb
responses to viral levels. In a separate study, HIV-1 neutralization was positively correlated with viral load among
individuals infected with nef-attenuated viruses, while no
association was observed among a control cohort [27].
Thus, the relationship between neutralizing antibody
response and viral load remains unclear and may depend
on other factors. Our finding of no relationship between
these factors is consistent with a model proposed by Frost
et al. [28], in which antibodies may exert "soft" selection
pressure that promotes the survival of certain virus variants but not others, while not affecting the absolute level
of virus replication. However, it is important to note that
the small sample size of our study may limit our ability to
identify more subtle relationships between NtAb and viral
set point.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

In some cases, the variation that was observed in V1,
including changes in PNGS, was detected prior to the
detection of NtAbs. This is best exemplified in animals
infected with SIVMne170 virus. In these animals, shifts in
PNGS, as well as changes in a region thought to be a target
of O-linked glycosylation [6], were observed by 40 weeks
PI. However, NtAb could not be detected in advance of
this time, and were quite low even at 40 weeks and thereafter in one animal, 94233, who had viruses with extensive variation in V1 at 40, 52 and 73 weeks PI. This may
suggest that other selective pressures are important in
driving these changes. Given that the parental, infecting
virus SIVMne170 was already highly fit for replication, as
evidenced by viral set point levels of >106, it seems
unlikely that the changes are simply ones that permit high
replication fitness. We also consider it somewhat unlikely
that selection was driven by T cell responses because the
types of changes – addition of carbohydrates – and the
cluster of multiple changes is not particularly characteristic of changes in epitopes that are targeted by CD4 or CD8
T cells; however, we cannot rule out this possibility. Notably, we found that ADCVI antibody responses were
present prior to the detection of this variation. Indeed,
potent ADCVI was detected by 7–16 weeks post-infection
in all animals examined, irrespective of the sequence of
the infecting virus. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that
ADCVI activity may have played a role in selecting viruses
with these gylcosylation changes because these responses
were observed very soon after infection and well before
viruses with these changes were observed. Furthermore,
ADCVI or other FcγR-mediated antibody functions have
been shown to be active against lentiviruses in vitro [29].
Nonetheless ADCVI alone does not explain why there
were so few V1 changes in animals infected with the earlystage virus, because these animals also developed ADCVI
antibody within the first few months of their infection.
Moreover, these animals had the earliest NtAb responses.
This suggest a combination of the level of virus replication, the properties of the virus itself, and various B cell
responses may contribute to the evolution of glycosylation changes.

Conclusion
This study of macaques infected with highly related,
cloned SIVs allowed a unique window into the relationship between infecting viral strain, viral evolution and
immune responses. We found that SIV variants that had
achieved high replication fitness and escape from neutralizing antibodies in one host continued to evolve upon
transmission to a new host. Furthermore, we observed evidence that this evolution was not merely the result of a
high replication level, but included changes that were similar between animals and that had plausible biological
consequences. The timing of virus diversification suggests
that neutralizing antibodies are unlikely to have played a

Page 12 of 15

Virology Journal 2008, 5:90

major role in selecting these changes, while ADCVI antibodies might have been an important source of early
selective pressure. Overall this study indicates that virus
evolution is a continual process that is largely shaped by
selective pressures that remain poorly understood.

Methods
Cloning of SIV envelope sequences
DNA was extracted from viably frozen macaque PBMC
samples, obtained from a previous study [17], using the
Qiagen Blood Mini kit and the resulting DNA was stored
in aliquots at -20°C until use. All DNA purification steps
were performed in a separate lab, free from any amplified
DNA products to reduce the possibility of contamination
from other sequences in the subsequent PCR steps.

Nested PCR was performed to amplify env sequence
encompassing the variable regions as described previously
[5], except the second round PCR product was amplified
using SIVenv 37 and SIVenv 50 primers (5'
GCCTTGTGTAAAATTAACCCC3' and 5' GGATGTTTGACAATGGTCTG 3' respectively). The resulting product
spanned sequences encoding V1–V3 of SIVMne envelope.
Five to ten proviral copies, as quantified by real-time PCR
[30], were added to each first round PCR. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol and
sequenced using standard procedures.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences from all animals were aligned using Clustal
[31] and manually edited using MacClade [32], and no
sequence regions were removed from analysis. Nucleotide
distances were calculated using a GTR model in
PAUP*4.10b [33]. Diversity was calculated as the mean
distance between sequences from the same animal and
time point. Divergence was calculated as the mean distance to the infecting variant. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed from all unique sequences
using PAUP*4.10b. For each animal at each time point,
the average nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence
from the infecting variant were calculated using SNAP
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov[20]. The average dN/dS ratio was
calculated for each animal at each time point, using all
sequences with non-zero synonymous divergence.
Viral stocks and neutralization assay
The titer of SIV stocks used for neutralization assays was
determined by infecting either TZM-bl [21] or sMAGI [6]
cells by directly counting β-galactosidase-positive "blue"
foci at 48 h postinfection. To perform neutralization
assays, TZM-bl or sMAGI cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at 1 × 104 cells per well one day before
infection. About 250 infectious particles were incubated
with two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera, or

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/90

with growth medium alone, in a total volume of 50 μl at
37°C for 1 h. The virus-serum mix was then incubated
with the pre-seeded TZM-bl or sMAGI cells at 37°C for 2
h in the presence of 20 μg/ml diethylaminoethyl-dextran.
After the incubation, an additional 100 μl growth
medium was added into each well. In 48 h, infection levels were determined using Galacto-Light Plus (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), a quantitative assay measuring β-galactosidase activity present in the cell lysate. Infections were performed in triplicate within each experiment,
and the results shown are averages from at least two independent experiments. Differences between β-galactosidase activity in the presence of sera and growth medium
alone were calculated as the percentage of neutralization.
No neutralization activity above 50% was observed with
sera from before inoculation. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated from a dose-response curve
using the logarithmic function of Microsoft Excel and is
expressed as the reciprocal dilution of serum required to
inhibit infection by 50%. The highest concentrations of
sera tested were 1:8 for monkeys infected with the
SIVMne35wkSU virus, and 1:16 for other study monkeys.
Detection of ADCVI antibody
ADCVI antibody activity was measured using methods
similar to those described previously [18,29,34]. Briefly,
target cells (CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells obtained from the NIH
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were
infected with virus (SIVMneCL8, SIVMne35wkSU or
SIVMne170) for 96 hours and washed. Plasma from
infected animals or from an uninfected control animal
was then added to attain a final concentration of 1:100. In
addition, fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear
effector cells were added at an effector:target ratio of 10:1.
Seven days later, p27 was measured in the supernatant
fluid by ELISA. ADCVI activity is reported as percent virus
inhibition: 100 [1 - ([p27t]/[p27n])], where [p27t] and
[p27n] are the concentrations of p27 in supernatant fluid
from wells containing test plasma or negative control
plasma, respectively. Each plasma sample was assayed in
triplicate on two separate occasions using a total of four
different effector cell donors.
Statistics
Average nucleotide diversity and divergence, dN/dS, and
NtAb IC50 were compared between animals infected with
the late variants versus animals infected with the early variant using a Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between
virus evolution, viral load and NtAb IC50 were performed
using Spearman's correlation test. Statistical analyses were
conducted using STATA 9 [35].
