Abstract
Background: The Brassica species include an important group of crops and provide opportunities
for studying the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy. They are related to Arabidopsis thaliana,
for which the first complete plant genome sequence was obtained and their genomes show
extensive, although imperfect, conserved synteny with that of A. thaliana. A large number of EST
sequences, derived from a range of different Brassica species, are available in the public database,
but no public microarray resource has so far been developed for these species.
Results: We assembled unigenes using ~800,000 EST sequences, mainly from three species: B.
napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea. The assembly was conducted with the aim of co-assembling ESTs of
orthologous genes (including homoeologous pairs of genes in B. napus from each of the A and C
genomes), but resolving assemblies of paralogous, or paleo-homoeologous, genes (i.e. the genes
related by the ancestral genome triplication observed in diploid Brassica species). 90,864 unique
sequence assemblies were developed. These were incorporated into the BAC sequence annotation
for the Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project, enabling the identification of cognate genomic
sequences for a proportion of them. A 60-mer oligo microarray comprising 94,558 probes was
developed using the unigene sequences. Gene expression was analysed in reciprocal resynthesised
B. napus lines and the B. oleracea and B. rapa lines used to produce them. The analysis showed that
significant expression could consistently be detected in leaf tissue for 35,386 unigenes. Expression
was detected across all four genotypes for 27,355 unigenes, genome-specific expression patterns
were observed for 7,851 unigenes and 180 unigenes displayed other classes of expression pattern.
Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly resolved the individual microarray datasets for B. rapa,
B. oleracea and resynthesised B. napus. Quantitative differences in expression were observed
between the resynthesised B. napus lines for 98 unigenes, most of which could be classified into
non-additive expression patterns, including 17 that showed cytoplasm-specific patterns. We further

characterized the unigenes for which A genome-specific expression was observed and cognate
genomic sequences could be identified. Ten of these unigenes were found to be Brassica-specific
sequences, including two that originate from complex loci comprising gene clusters.
Conclusion: We succeeded in developing a Brassica community microarray resource. Although
expression can be measured for the majority of unigenes across species, there were numerous
probes that reported in a genome-specific manner. We anticipate that some proportion of these
will represent species-specific transcripts and the remainder will be the consequence of variation
of sequences within the regions represented by the array probes. Our studies demonstrated that
the datasets obtained from the arrays can be used for typical analyses, including PCA and the
analysis of differential expression. We have also demonstrated that Brassica-specific transcripts
identified in silico in the sequence assembly of public EST database accessions are indeed reported
by the array. These would not be detectable using arrays designed using A. thaliana sequences.

Background
The cultivated Brassica species are the group of crops most
closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana. They are members
of the Brassicaceae (sometimes referred to as the Crucifereae) family [1]. The species typically termed the "diploid"
Brassica species, B. rapa (n = 10), B. nigra (n = 8) and B.
oleracea (n = 9) contain the A, B and C genomes, respectively. Each pairwise combination has hybridized spontaneously to form the three allotetraploid species [2], B.
napus (n = 19, comprising A and C genomes), B. juncea (n
= 18, comprising A and B genomes) and B. carinata (n =
17, comprising B and C genomes). The genome of B. rapa
is the smallest, at ca. 500 Mb [3], and a genome sequencing project is under way, with both sequences and
sequence annotations in the public domain http://
brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/
The lineages of B. rapa and B. oleracea diverged ca. 3.7 Mya
[4] and genetic mapping has confirmed that the overall
organisation of their genomes is highly collinear [5]. Their
hybridisation to form B. napus probably occurred during
human cultivation, i.e. less than 10,000 years ago. Comparative genetic mapping showed that the progenitor A
and C genomes in B. napus have undergone little or no
gross rearrangement during that time [6] and also
revealed extensive duplication within the Brassica
genomes [5]. Recent cytogenetic studies have shown that
a distinctive feature of the Brassiceae tribe, of which the
Brassica species are members, is that they contain extensively triplicated genomes [7].
Even at the resolution of linkage maps, extensive collinearity can be identified between the genomes of Brassica
species and A. thaliana. For example, a landmark study
using sequenced RFLP markers demonstrated that 21 segments of the genome of A. thaliana, representing almost
its entirety, could be replicated and rearranged to generate
a structure approximating that of the B. napus genome [8].
A study across the Brassicaceae subsequently identified 24
conserved chromosomal blocks, relating them to a pro-

posed ancestral karyotype of n = 8 [9]. A number of
genome analyses have been conducted in B. oleracea, B.
rapa and B. napus using physical mapping techniques. The
results have shown that the diploid Brassica genomes contain extensive triplication, consistent with their having
evolved from a hexaploid ancestor [10-12]. Two
sequence-level studies, one in B. oleracea [13] and one in
B. rapa [14] have provided further support for the hypothesis of hexaploid ancestry for the Brassica species. If this
hypothesis were true, the duplicate genes we observe in
the extant diploid genomes would formally be "paleohomoeologues". However, here we will use the more general term paralogue, which is free of this assumption, to
clearly delineate from the recognisable homoeologues in
B. napus arising from the very recent hybridisation of the
A and C genomes. The studies using physical mapping
and sequencing approaches showed that, although sets of
three related genome segments (paralogues) will often be
identifiable within the genome of the diploid Brassica species, a proportion of the genes in these segments will have
been lost.
Brassica polyploids can be synthesised artificially. For
example, B. napus can be resynthesised by hybridization
of B. rapa and B. oleracea. However, it has been found that
such lines display genome instability [15], which can persist for many generations and is thought to involve
homoeologous non-reciprocal translocations. They have
been shown to be correlated with qualitative changes in
the expression of specific genes and with phenotypic variation [16].
Microarrays have become a widely-used tool for transcriptome analysis in plants. Essentially, they consist of an
immobilised array of DNA sequences (probes) which are
hybridized in situ using fluorescently-labelled sequences
(targets) derived by reverse transcription of polyadenylated transcripts. Imaging of the hybridized array, followed by computational analysis of the signal intensity
data, leads to a quantification of the transcript abundance,

in the sampled tissue, of the genes represented by the
probes in the array. There are numerous microarray platforms available and they have been applied to a wide
range of studies in plant biology, reviewed by Galbraith
[17].

Table 1: Summary statistics of unigene assembly

Results
Assembly of Brassica unigenes
All available Brassica species ESTs were downloaded from
GenBank in September, 2007. These consisted of three
principal sets: B. napus (567,240), B. rapa (180,611) and
B. oleracea (59,696). A total of 810,254 ESTs after cleaning
and removal of low quality and short (<100 bp)
sequences was reduced to 803,326 reads. Since the initial
goal was to develop a widely useful Brassica microarray, all
available ESTs were assembled together using the TGICL
software package [20] with default settings (94% identity,
90% coverage). The statistics for this assembly are shown
in Table 1. Sequences were oriented either based on their
alignment with a known protein or by the presence of a
polyA (polyT) tail. A total of 3,694 sequences (330 assemblies and 3364 singletons) could not be oriented and were
thus represented in both orientations in the data set from
which the array was designed, making 94,558 sequences
in all. The assemblies and singletons were annotated by

Total assemblies

As the Brassica species diverged from A. thaliana only ca.
17 Mya [18], exon sequences show a high level of conservation, ca. 85% at the nucleotide level [19]. Therefore
some types of microarrays designed for use in A. thaliana
can be used for the analysis in Brassica of the related genes.
However, an analysis of ca. 100,000 Brassica EST
sequences showed that ca. 9% showed no similarity with
any gene in A. thaliana [14]. A. thaliana-based microarrays
therefore would fail to measure the expression of a significant number of Brassica genes. In addition, Brassica
genomes show extensive triplication, with the subgenomes estimated to have diverged ca. 14 Mya
[13,14,18]. A. thaliana-based microarrays would lack the
capability to resolve the contributions to the transcriptome of such families of paralogous genes. Consequently,
a number of groups have developed Brassica cDNA-based
microarrays, but these have been based upon relatively
modest EST collections and none are available as community resources. We aimed to address this deficiency by
developing a microarray based upon all public EST data,
validating its utility for transcriptome analysis across multiple Brassica species, and placing it in the public domain.
The validation experiment involved transcriptome analysis in two "resynthesised" B. napus lines and their B. rapa
and B. oleracea progenitors. This experimental design enables the identification of both species-specific and
genome-specific expression, whilst the long oligonucleotides used essentially eliminate the possible complications due to allelic variation (SNPs and small indels).

Incorporation of assemblies into the Brassica genome
sequence annotation
As partners in a multinational consortium to sequence the
gene space of the Brassica rapa genome, we make available
(from http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk a first-pass annotation
of completed BACs immediately on deposition in the
public sequence databases. The annotation is rendered
through the GBrowse genome browser system [21]. For
the present study, 673 BAC sequences were available for
analysis and were annotated. The sequence coverage was
approximately 80 Mbp, which is equivalent to ~14.5%
coverage of the entire ~550 Mbp B. rapa genome pro rata
[8], but this might represent a greater fraction of the gene
space because the original seed BACs and hence the scaffold extensions were targeted to the gene-rich euchromatin.

There were 19,148 separate instances of unigenes aligning
within this annotation set and 10,606 of the 17,862,
(59.4%) FGENESH gene models predicted had EST support arising from some overlap with these EST alignments.
Of the 90,864 unigenes comprising the assembly, 13,938
(15.4%) appeared at least once within the annotation set,
including 38 of the unigenes represented in both orientations. Gene predictions around the latter may aid in their
resolution.
Design of the microarray
One of the primary requirements for the design of the
microarray was that it should be applicable for transcriptome analysis across a range of Brassica species. Therefore,
we required a platform based on "long oligonucleotide"

probes in order to minimise susceptibility to SNP variation across species, whilst retaining the capability of
resolving the transcripts of significantly diverged gene
families, such as those with paralogous relationships
within the Brassica genomes. To accommodate these
design requirements, the Agilent Technologies microarray
platform, which uses 60-mer oligonucleotide probes, was
selected http://www.chem.agilent.com.
The assembled Brassica sequences (94,558 instances
including those represented in both orientations) were
submitted to Agilent Technologies' eArray web portal for
gene expression probe design. For each 60-mer oligonucleotide probe that is designed using this tool, a base composition score is calculated to reflect the theoretical
performance of the probe in standard hybridization conditions. Probes with a base composition score greater than
or equal to 3 were omitted from the final design. This
resulted in a total of 91,854 unique probes (including
6,989 derived from oppositely oriented pairs of
sequences) that were included in the microarray design, of
which 10,466 were predicted to have cross-hybridization
potential. To utilize the full capacity of the microarray,
11,893 probes were randomly selected to be represented
in duplicate in the final design, which also included Agilent Technologies' standard panel of quality control and
spike-in probes. This design was then used to manufacture
microarrays using Agilent Technologies' SurePrintâ¢ Technology in the 2Ã 104 k format (two microarrays containing ~104,000 probes on a single 1" Ã 3" glass slide).
Qualitative analysis of gene expression across genotypes
The experimental design used to test the performance of
the microarray included four genotypes: two "resynthesized" B. napus lines and their progenitor B. rapa and B.
oleracea lines. The nuclear genomes of the resynthesised B.
napus lines should be identical but, as one (B. napus 1)
involved a cross of B. oleracea onto B. rapa, and the other
(B. napus 2) involved a cross of B rapa onto B. oleracea,
they differ in cytoplasm, and hence contain different chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. For each genotype,
RNA was isolated from four biological replicates making
a total of sixteen independent samples. The gene expression profile for each sample was generated by labelling
and hybridizing each sample to one of 16 separate microarrays. The data are available from the GEO repository,
accession number GSE15915.

The parameters used for the assembly of the unigenes had
been set such that transcribed sequences from orthologous genes, including homoeologues from the A and C
genomes in B. napus, should co-assemble. In order to
assess the number of probes that, nevertheless, report
genome-specific expression, we used the presence or
absence of significant signal (qualitative expression) for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/50

each probe to classify the expression pattern of the corresponding unigene. The probes were considered to give no
signal if no significant expression was detected in any of
the 16 microarrays. 31,705 of the 103,747 non-control
probes on the array fell into this class. Of the probes for
which significant expression was identified in at least one
microarray, those that give only matching reports of either
significant signal or no significant signal across every set
of replicates (i.e. there were no instances of only 1, 2 or 3
replicate microarrays yielding significant signals from a
particular genotype) were considered to have produced
consistent reports of qualitative expression. In total,
39,689 probes produced consistent reports of qualitative
expression and were used to classify qualitative expression
patterns into 15 classes across the genotypes (see additional file 1: Spreadsheet1). The results, with duplicate
probes removed in order to show the number of unigenes
represented, are summarised in Figure 1. 1,109 of the
35,389 unigenes represented are from the dual-orientated
subset, of which 108 were reported in both orientations.
Significant qualitative expression can be detected across
all genotypes for 27,355 unigenes. Genome-specific
expression can be detected for 7,851 unigenes; 3,427 are
expressed in B. rapa and B. napus, but not in B. oleracea
and thus can be considered A genome-specific while by
analogous criteria 4,424 can be considered C genome-specific. Significant expression was detected for 135 unigenes
in B. rapa only and for 19 unigenes in B. oleracea only. No
unigenes were expressed only in a diploid while 12 unigenes (not shown in Figure 1) were expressed only in a
tetraploid. Very few unigenes (14 in total) were categorised into the remaining 9 classes of qualitative expression.
Resolution of genotypes by Principal Component Analysis
In order to visualize the significant sources of variation
within the entire data set, a principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed. The PCA was performed using zscore transformed intensity measurements for all noncontrol probes on the microarray. The resulting scatterplot
is depicted in Figure 2, with each colour representing a different genotype. The plot demonstrates that the biological
replicates within each genotype cluster closely together.
Furthermore, the largest source of variation in the gene
expression data is the different species as evidenced by the
distinct groupings of each genotype along the x-axis
(which depicts principal component 1). There was limited
resolution of the resynthesised B. napus lines, which differed only by cytoplasm.
Identification of differential gene expression in
resynthesised B. napus
Apart from heritable epigenetic differences, the nuclear
genomes of the resynthesised B. napus lines should be
identical, but their chloroplast and mitochondrial

genomes differ. We investigated whether the microarray
was capable of detecting any cytoplasm-specific differences in gene expression or any deviation from the
expected additive contributions of the parental nuclear
genomes to the transcriptome of the amphidiploid, typically termed transcriptome remodelling or non-additive
gene expression. Quantitative expression was compared
between the resynthesised B. napus lines. 98 unigenes
were identified that showed significant (P < 0.001) expression differences between the two lines (see additional file
2: Spreadsheet2) For each of these unigenes, the genome
of origin (nuclear, chloroplast or mitochondrion) was
determined by using BLAST to identify similarity between
the unigene sequence and annotated genes or other
sequences in the public databases. The expression patterns
were further classified, where possible, based upon significant differences between expression in other pairs of genotypes, i.e. involving the B. oleracea and B. rapa genotypes
(see additional file 3: Spreadsheet3).
Seventeen unigenes showed cytoplasm-specific expression profiles (i.e. there is a significant difference between
the reported expression in the B. oleracea and B. rapa lines
and the expression reported in the resynthesised B. napus
lines corresponds to that of the maternal parent in the
respective hybridization). Of these, 12 unigenes are of
chloroplast origin, two are of mitochondrial origin and
three are of nuclear origin. These patterns are consistent
with cytoplasmic inheritance (chloroplast and mitochondrial genes) or epigenetic imprinting (nuclear genes).
Non-additive expression could be identified for 60 unigenes, 58 of which are nuclear-encoded and two that are
mitochondrial. The expression patterns of 21 unigenes
(13 nuclear-encoded, five chloroplast encoded and three

mitochondrion-encoded) that showed significant differences in expression between the resynthesised B. napus
lines could not be classified, as a result of lack of significance in expression levels between other combinations of
genotypes. These results show that the expression data
generated using the microarray are, with four biological
replicates, of a sufficiently high quality to enable the classification of expression patterns for 77 of the 98 unigenes
(79%) showing significant differences in expression
between the resynthesised B. napus lines, including the
identification of many cytoplasm-specific expression patterns for genes encoded by chloroplasts or mitochondria.
Characterization of sequences showing genome-specific
expression
Expression of 7,851 unigenes was found in both B. napus
lines and only one or other of the two diploids. Of these,
3,427 are from the A genome. BLASTN was used to scan
the sequenced BACs for these probes and for the corresponding complete unigene sequences. Of the aligned
(cognate) unigenes, ten were randomly selected for further analysis. The entire unigene sequences were used to
identify, using BLAST, homologous TAIR8 CDS from A.
thaliana and the position of the probe within the aligned
sequences was used to assess whether the probe is likely to
lie in coding or untranslated regions of the transcript. The
results are summarised in Table 2. In most (eight) cases,
the unigene aligns to an A. thaliana CDS and the position
of the microarray probe can be inferred as being in a 3'
UTR. In two cases, the alignment to an A. thaliana CDS
suggests that the probe lies within the coding region.

Twelve unigenes were identified that had cognate genes in
sequenced B. rapa BAC clones, but did not show homology to A. thaliana CDS. The sequences of these unigenes
were assessed, using BLASTN, for similarity with any A.
thaliana genomic sequences or other sequences in the
NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database. The results
are summarised in Table 3. In two cases, the unigene contains some sequences with homology to short stretches of
A. thaliana genomic sequences. However, in most cases
(ten), the unigenes appear to represent Brassica-specific
sequence, as no similarities were identified with genomic
sequences from A. thaliana or any other organism. The
majority of these (eight) originate from positions in the B.
rapa genome that lie between genes showing collinearity
with the A. thaliana genome. The remaining two originate
from positions within gene clusters (one of protein
kinase-encoding genes and the other of oxidoreductaseencoding genes).

Discussion
We assembled unigenes using 810,254 EST sequences,
mainly from three species: B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea.
The assembly was conducted with the aim of co-assem-

bling ESTs of orthologous genes (including homoeologue-pairs in B. napus from each of the A and C
genomes), but resolving assemblies of paralogous genes
(i.e. the genes related by the ancestral genome triplication
observed in Brassica species). To do this, the assembly cutoff was set at 94% identity, based on our estimates of
nucleotide conservation between paralogues of ~84%
[13] and between A and C genome orthologues of 94â
97% (unpublished). In total, 94,558 unigenes, representing 90,864 unique sequences were developed. An anticipated consequence of the close phylogenetic relationship
between Brassica and A. thaliana, for which a complete
genome sequence is available and has been annotated to
a high standard, the majority of the unigenes (72,148)
could be annotated and orientated on the basis of
sequence similarity to proteins in the Uniprot100 database. The remaining 18,716 unigenes are candidates for
encoding Brassica-specific proteins or non-coding RNAs.
In the absence of genomic sequence data, the functional
significance of the large number of Brassica-specific unigenes is difficult to assess. As a first step, the assemblies
were incorporated into the BAC sequence annotation for
the Brassica rapa Genome Sequencing Project, enabling
the identification of cognate genomic sequences for a proportion of the assemblies and contributing to the annotation of the emerging B. rapa genome sequence.
A 60-mer oligo microarray was developed using the unigene sequences and its utility validated by conducting an
experiment aimed at testing its ability to analyse the transcriptomes of multiple Brassica species. Gene expression

was analysed in two resynthesised B. napus lines and the
B. oleracea and B. rapa lines used to produce them. The B.
napus lines represented progeny resulting from both B.
oleracea crossed onto B. rapa (thus possessing the B. rapa
cytoplasm) and B. rapa crossed onto B. oleracea (thus possessing the B. oleracea cytoplasm). The 60-mer probe
design enables an analysis of differential expression
regardless of allelic variation due to SNPs or short indels
which might interfere with transcript detection by the
probes. The analysis showed that significant expression
could consistently be detected in leaf tissue for 35,386
unigenes. This proportion of the total number of 94,558
unigenes (37.4%) is consistent with our expectations as
many of the ESTs in the original collection were derived
from other tissues (particularly developing seeds). Our
criteria for significant expression were stringent (resulting
in the elimination of 32,353 probes for which nevertheless at least one array detected significant expression).
Expression was detected across all four genotypes for
27,355 unigenes (77.3% of those for which consistent
expression was detected) and principal component analysis clearly resolved the individual microarray datasets for
B. rapa, B. oleracea and resynthesised B. napus. Quantitative differences in expression were observed between the
resynthesised B. napus lines for 98 unigenes, most of
which could be classified into non-additive expression
patterns, including 17 that showed cytoplasm-specific
patterns.
In the two diploids, genome-specific expression patterns
were observed for 7,851 unigenes (22.2% of those for
which consistent expression was detected). These may
represent instances in which the probes were designed to
sequences that differ between the A and C genome orthologues. However, the anticipated sequence polymorphism
rate between coding regions of orthologous genes of
~3.4% would typically result in ~2 differences per probe,
which is unlikely to destabilize the hybridization sufficiently to abolish signal. We have, however, observed that
sequences that are orthologous between the Brassica A and
C genomes also differ in insertion-deletions (InDel)
(unpublished), which could result in more extensive
destabilization if overlapping the region to which the
probe is designed. Alternatively, these may be sequences
that are present in only one of the Brassica genomes, or
their genome-specific expression may be tissue-dependent (we have analysed only leaf tissue). To begin to understand the basis for this difference, we exploited the
emerging B. rapa genome sequences in order to characterize the genome sequences cognate to some of the unigenes showing genome-specific patterns of expression, as
reported by the microarray. This revealed that, in the
majority of cases, the probes are positioned in 3' UTR
regions. However, ten of the aligned unigenes were found
to be Brassica-specific sequences, including two that origi-

nate from complex loci comprising gene clusters. Therefore, we can hypothesise that a proportion of the unigenes
showing genome-specific patterns of reported expression
are likely to represent either Brassica-specific genes or
Brassica-specific non-protein coding sequences. The
observation of two instances of novel transcripts from
clusters of genes that show evidence of recent duplication
and rearrangements, and are reminiscent of some classes
of disease resistance loci in plants, is particularly intriguing as it provides evidence for these loci producing novel
genetic and transcriptional variation.

Conclusion
We successfully developed and validated a microarray
resource for use by the Brassica research community. The
microarray enabled the detection of gene expression
across all Brassica species tested for >27,000 unigenes.
Genome-specific expression was observed for more than
7000 further unigenes. We anticipate that these will represent both species-specific transcripts and the consequences of variation of sequences within the regions of
the unigenes represented by the array probes. Our studies
demonstrated that the datasets obtained from the arrays
can be used for typical analyses, including PCA and the
analysis of differential expression. Our analysis of unigenes showing genome-specific expression patterns confirmed the transcription of sequences not represented in
A. thaliana. Indeed, numerous transcripts were identified
that represent Brassica-specific sequences. These transcripts would not be detectable using arrays designed with
A. thaliana sequences and may represent functional genes
not represented in other species.

Methods
Growth of plants
Seed was sown into Plantpak 9 cm pots containing Scotts
Levington F1 compost (Scotts, Ipswich, UK) and covered
with a plastic propagator lid. The seeds were germinated
and grown in long day glass house conditions (16 hours
photoperiod) at 15Â°C (400 W HQI metal halide lamps).
Plants were pricked out after 11 days into Plantpak P15
modules containing Scotts Levington M2 compost and
arranged into a four block randomised design with three
plants each for each of the four genotypes per block and
randomised within each block. Leaves were harvested 15
days after pricking out, 26 days after sowing. Leaf harvest
was carried out as close to the midpoint of the light period
as possible. The first true leaf of each plant was excised as
close to the petiole as possible and the weight was
recorded. Three leaf samples for each genotype from each
experimental block were pooled and frozen in liquid
nitrogen, giving a final harvest of four pooled leaf samples
per genotype.
Preparation of RNA
RNA was prepared by grinding tissue in liquid nitrogen
and extracting using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was resuspended in 50 Î¼l DEPC treated
water (Severn Biotech Ltd., Kidderminster, UK). The RNA
samples were further purified using the Qiagen Mini Kit
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the RNA
Clean up protocol given in the RNeasy Mini Handbook
(4th edition, April 2006).

Gene Expression Profiling
The quantity and purity of the extracted RNA was evaluated using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and its
integrity measured using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. For
microarray hybridizations performed, 500 ng of total
RNA from each sample was amplified and labeled with a
fluorescent dye (Cy3) using the Low RNA Input Linear
Amplification Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.
The amount and quality of the fluorescently labeled cRNA
was assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. A consistent amount
of Cy3-labeled cRNA (1.6 Î¼g) were hybridized to the custom Brassica microarray, which was manufactured by Agilent Technologies, for 17 hours, prior to washing and
scanning. Data were extracted from scanned images using
Agilent's Feature Extraction Software (Agilent Technologies).
Data Analysis
Gene expression data was loaded into the Rosetta
ResolverÂ® Gene Expression Analysis System version
7.0.0.1.9 and biological replicates were combined using
an error-weighted average. Ratios were then calculated
comparing each possible combination of samples. The

criteria for identification of differentially expressed transcripts was an absolute fold change value > 2.0, a log ratio
p-value < 0.001, and a log(10) intensity measurement > 1.8. Rosetta Resolver was used to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) using z-score transformed intensity
data for all non-control features present on the microarray
for each of the 16 samples that were profiled.
The statistical significance of probes representing differentially expressed transcripts was determined using the
Bayesian-moderated test statistic described in [22]. The
statistic was calculated in a linear model framework provided by the library limma, which is part of the BioConductor suite of libraries for the statistical programming
language R. The p-value cut-off, given above, for significance was established by inspecting the distribution of pvalues associated with the control probes on the microarray.
Annotation and databases
Finished Brassica rapa BAC sequences available in the public domain were annotated using the Brassica 95 k unigene set as described below and the results published to
complement the other annotation tracks available
through the GBrowse genome browser at http://
brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk. Briefly, the 95 k set was first queried

against each BAC sequence using BLASTN 2.0MP-WashU
[20-Apr-2005] [23] implemented on a Linux cluster with
an initial E-value threshold parameter of 1 Ã 10-50. Positive hits were saved and the corresponding transcript
assemblies were then re-aligned against the genomic
sequence with BLAT [24] using a sequence identity threshold of 95%. Coordinates of the BLAT alignment blocks
were parsed to GFF format with the annotation Perl script
and loaded into the MySQL database driving the Genome
browser, which is also directly accessible via a programmatic interface to allow querying.

In addition, full details of the composition of the 95 k unigene set were loaded into a separate MySQL database
which can be interrogated through a web front-end also at
http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk. This database may be searched
with text terms or fragments (which will be wild-carded)
for matches on a number of fields, including assembly or
singleton identifier, the identifier, gene name, description
or source organism of the best UniProt BLASTX hit and,
where appropriate, the identifiers, tissue sources and
source Brassica species of the ESTs contributing to an
assembly. Search results are returned in HTML tabular
form and, where appropriate, are marked up with hyperlinks to GBrowse views, EBI sequence and InterPro
descriptions and NCBI dbEST records. The sequence of
the unigene is also returned and, if it appears on the array,
the 60-mer Agilent probe designed is rendered in lower
case.
Finally, the DNA sequences of all members of the 95 k
unigene set are available for similarity matching through
a BLAST server at http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/BrassicaDB/
95k_blast.html and the fasta sequence file is downloadable from the FTP site ftp://149.155.100.41/pub/brassica/

Spreadsheet 3. Classification of expression patterns of unigenes for which
probes report significant (P < 0.001) differences between expression levels
in B. napus 1 and B. napus 2. Definition of classification terms; nonadditive: expression in one or both B. napus lines departs from that
expected for additive expression of the values observed in the parent lines;
cytoplasm-specific: expression in B. napus matches the characteristics of
that in the maternal parent line; unclassified: insufficient data are available to permit classification. The small variation in intensity values
reported for a given genotype arises from normalizations being performed
independently for each pairwise comparison conducted.
