Chromosomal clustering of genes in Drosophila

Abstract
Background: The trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are responsible for
the maintenance of stable transcriptional patterns of many developmental regulators. They bind to
specific regions of DNA and direct the post-translational modifications of histones, playing a role
in the dynamics of chromatin structure.
Results: We have performed genome-wide expression studies of trx and ash2 mutants in
Drosophila melanogaster. Using computational analysis of our microarray data, we have identified 25
clusters of genes potentially regulated by TRX. Most of these clusters consist of genes that encode
structural proteins involved in cuticle formation. This organization appears to be a distinctive
feature of the regulatory networks of TRX and other chromatin regulators, since we have observed
the same arrangement in clusters after experiments performed with ASH2, as well as in
experiments performed by others with NURF, dMyc, and ASH1. We have also found many of these
clusters to be significantly conserved in D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura and partially in
Anopheles gambiae.
Conclusion: The analysis of genes governed by chromatin regulators has led to the identification
of clusters of functionally related genes conserved in other insect species, suggesting this
chromosomal organization is biologically important. Moreover, our results indicate that TRX and
other chromatin regulators may act globally on chromatin domains that contain transcriptionally
co-regulated genes.

Background

1,036 genes that are arranged in clusters located in 52 underreplication regions of the larval salivary gland polytene
chromosomes.

Differential gene expression is essential to the cellular diversity required for adequate pattern formation and organogenesis during the first stages of development in multicellular
organisms. Thereafter, epigenetic regulatory systems must
ensure the maintenance of these gene expression patterns to
preserve cell identity in adulthood [1]. Regulation of transcription is, therefore, crucial to proper temporal and spatial
gene expression throughout development. The complex transcriptional regulatory code that governs the different gene
expression programs of an organism involves many different
actors, such as transcription factors, regulatory sequences in
the genome, chromatin structure and modification states [2].
Chromatin packaging plays a central role during gene transcription by controlling the access of the RNA polymerase II
transcriptional machinery and other gene regulatory elements (such as transcription factors) to the promoter region
of the genes [3,4]. The dynamics of chromatin structure is
controlled through multiple mechanisms, such as nucleosome positioning, chromatin remodeling and histone posttranslational modifications [5].
Gene regulation can occur in the genome at distinct levels of
organization: individual genes, chromosomal domains and
entire chromosomes [6]. Thus, a set of transcriptionally
active genes and the regulatory elements necessary for their
correct expression are generally associated with open chromatin domains, while silent genes are embedded in more
compact chromatin regions [7]. The main effect of such
domains on genome organization is observed in the non-random distribution of genes in a genome, which can favor coordinated gene expression. In fact, the interplay of genome
rearrangements, gene expression mechanisms and evolutionary forces could explain the complex landscape of gene regulation [8].
Since the publication of the sequence of many eukaryotic
genomes [9-12], several whole-genome studies about genome
organization have established the existence of clusters of coexpressed genes, in some cases functionally related (see [8]
for a comprehensive review). Examples have been found in
many species such as yeast [13,14], worm [15,16] or human
[17,18]. In D. melanogaster, the presence of clusters has been
studied by several groups. Ueda et al. [19] found that genes
controlling circadian rhythms tend to be grouped in local
clusters on chromosomes, suggesting this is due to higher
order chromatin structures. Spellman and Rubin [20] analyzed the chromosomal position of gene expression profiles
from 88 different experimental conditions and found that
over 20% of all genes were clustered into co-regulated groups
of 10-30 genes of unrelated function. Boutanaev et al. [21]
identified 1,661 testes-specific genes, one-third of which were
clustered on chromosomes in groups of three or more genes.
The effect of chromatin structure on a particular cluster of
five genes in the previous screening [21] was successfully validated by Kalmykova et al. [22]. Belyakin et al. [23] reported

Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is necessary for the
correct deployment of developmental programs and for the
maintenance of cell fates. The Polycomb and Trithorax epigenetic system, initially discovered in D. melanogaster, is
responsible for the maintenance of gene expression throughout late development and adulthood. Polycomb group (PcG)
proteins are required to prevent inappropriate expression of
homeotic genes, while trithorax group (trxG) proteins seem
to work antagonistically as anti-repressors. Recent studies
have identified and characterized several multiprotein complexes containing these transcriptional regulators. They control transcription through multistep mechanisms that involve
histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and interaction
with general transcription factors. In flies, PcG and trxG complexes are recruited to certain regulatory sequence response
elements of the genome denominated PRE/TREs (see [24-27]
for a review on trxG and PcG proteins).
Systematic examination of gene expression patterns using
microarrays can provide a global picture of the distinct regulatory networks of different genomes [28-31]. In particular,
several genome-wide expression experiments involving
members of trxG have recently been published [32-34].
Trithorax (trx), the first isolated member of the trxG, is
required throughout embryonic and larval development for
the correct differentiation in the adult [35]. The trx gene
encodes a histone methyltransferase that can modify lysine 4
of histone 3 (H3K4). This methylation is an epigenetic mark
associated with transcriptionally active genes [36]. In the
work presented here we have combined the expression profiles obtained from microarray experiments with exhaustive
bioinformatic analyses that include gene clustering, comparative genomics and functional annotation to gain insight into
the role of trxG proteins. Our results show the existence of
evolutionarily conserved chromosomal clusters with most of
the genes being also regulated by other chromatin regulators,
and functionally annotated as components of the cuticle.

Results
Whole-genome expression analysis of trx mutants
In order to investigate the molecular signature of the trx
mutants in Drosophila melanogaster, we have compared
whole-genome expression profiles of trx mutant third instar
larvae and wild-type larvae (see Materials and methods). We
designed two-color cDNA microarrays containing 12,120
genes annotated in RefSeq from D. melanogaster [37]. The
analysis of the microarray experiments identified 535 genes
showing a statistically significant change (at least 2-fold
change, p-value <0.05) in expression between mutant and
wild-type samples (see Materials and methods). Of these, 260

mutant larvae (Additional data file 1).

parameters: window length, 25,000 bp; window step, 1,000
bp; minimal number of co-expressed genes, 3; q-value ≤0.05.
The chromosomal distribution of clusters and genes along the
genome of D. melanogaster is shown in Figure 1 (up-regulated genes are depicted in red, down-regulated genes in
green; the genomic position of each cluster is represented
with the corresponding red or green triangle and each cluster
is labeled with the same identifier used in Table 2). Clusters
of genes deregulated in trx mutant larvae are not uniformly
distributed along the genome: 15 out of 25 clusters (60%) are
located on chromosome 3L (Table 1). Remarkably, the proportion of genes in clusters increases dramatically in chromosome 3L: 62 genes out of 163 deregulated genes mapped to
this chromosome are clustered (38%), as opposed to only 35
genes out of 372 deregulated genes mapped to the other chromosomes (9%) (Additional data file 2).

We mapped these deregulated genes to the fly genome
(assembly dm2, April 2004) using the RefSeq [37] track of the
UCSC genome browser [38], and the chromosomal distribution is shown in Table 1. The number of RefSeq genes annotated on each chromosome is also displayed. We mapped
more co-expressed genes on chromosome 3L than on any
other chromosome (30% of 535 deregulated genes; Table 1):
69 up-regulated genes (p-value <10-2) and 94 down-regulated
genes (p-value <10-8). Chromosomes 2R and 3R are, however, richer in number of annotated genes (3,993 and 4,843
genes respectively, compared to 3,775 genes in chromosome
3L in Table 1).

Chromosomal clustering of genes deregulated in trx
mutants

Volume 9, Issue 9, Article R134

Blanco et al. R134.3

The clusters reported here contain a total of 162 genes (97
deregulated genes and 65 genes whose change in expression
was not significant), comprising in total 372,967 nucleotides,
with an average gene density of 4.3 genes per 10 Kb. In contrast, the average gene density in the fruit fly genome is 1.6
genes per 10 Kb. The average length of the genes in clusters is
946 bp, while the length of the deregulated genes that are not
clustered is 3,416 bp (the overall average for D. melanogaster
is 6,976 bp). Since the REEF program approach is based on
genomic proximity measured in number of nucleotides, this
could favor artifactual cluster definition in gene-rich regions
of the genome. To rule out this possibility, we have designed
an alternative clustering algorithm based on measuring the
number of co-expressed genes within a window containing a
fixed number of annotated genes, rather than a fixed number
of nucleotides (see Materials and methods for further details).
Results obtained with our clustering strategy are highly concordant with those produced by the REEF program (Additional data file 3): 27 clusters were detected (22 identical
clusters, 2 clusters with additional genes, 3 new clusters and

Since chromatin modifications are typically associated with
the coordinated expression of groups of nearby genes [3] and
the analysis of different transcriptome datasets has shown
that genes with a similar expression pattern are frequently
located next to one another in the linear genome [21,39], our
next step was to determine whether deregulated genes in our
trx mutants are located in close proximity in the fly genome
(chromosomal clusters). There are many possible definitions
of what a cluster of genes is (see [8] for a review). Here, we
define a cluster as a group of genes located close to each other
on the same chromosome in the genome, but not necessarily
adjacent, that showed the same expression pattern (up-regulation or down-regulation) in the microarray experiment (see
Materials and methods).
Chromosomal clusters can be identified computationally
[20,40]. We detected 97 genes, organized in 25 genomic clusters, that are deregulated in trx deficient larvae (10 clusters of
up-regulated genes and 15 clusters of down-regulated genes;
Table 1), using the program REEF [41] with the following

1 missing cluster). Therefore, the high gene density observed
in our clusters is not the consequence of any computational
limitation in the clustering method. Given the high concordance of the two clustering approaches and since REEF is the
more standard approach, we have based our subsequent analysis and experiments on the REEF results (the list of the clusters and the genes that constitute each cluster are shown in
Table 2).
As a control test to assess the statistical significance of the
clustering, we repeated the analysis on 100 sets of genes that
were randomly selected from the fly genome, preserving the
gene distribution in the chromosomes that we observed in the
set of genes deregulated in trx mutant larvae (see Materials
and methods). The number of clusters identified on the ran-

dom sets was very small (on average 1.7 clusters compared
with the 25 clusters observed from the experimental data)
despite containing the same proportion of genes on every
chromosome (Figure 2a). In addition, we computed the Zscore of the number of clusters observed in our microarray,
using the distribution of number of clusters found in the random sets as background distribution (see Materials and
methods). This score is highly significant for trx clusters:
17.25 (Additional data file 4). Because of the small size of clustered genes, one could argue that the clustering described
here is due to specific properties of short and active genes,
and not related to a trxG characteristic. Therefore, we
retrieved all small genes of the fly genome (that is, genes with
the same range of sizes as the ones found in this work) and
repeated the previous test (see Materials and methods). The

Genomic map of clusters of genes deregulated in trx mutants
Figure 1
Genomic map of clusters of genes deregulated in trx mutants. The location of each gene significantly deregulated in the microarray is indicated with a
vertical line (up-regulated genes in red, down-regulated genes in green). Genes in the forward strand are displayed above the chromosome line; genes in
the reverse strand are displayed below. Clusters of genes are indicated with a triangle in red or green according to their expression. The genome map was
produced using the program GFF2PS [102].

number of clusters observed in the whole collection of fly
small genes was significant: 107 clusters (including 21 of the
25 trx clusters; Z-score 9.75; Additional data file 4). The existence of clusters of small sized and active genes has already
been established for many genomes and it is thought that this
organization could favor coordinated and efficient gene
expression [42,43]. However, the clustering tendency of
genes regulated by TRX is stronger as the Z-score for trx clusters (17.25) clearly contrasts with the one measured in the
whole fly genome (9.75). As an additional control, we generated 100 random sets of genes preserving the same size distribution observed in up-regulated and down-regulated genes
(see Materials and methods). The number of clusters detected
in trx deregulated genes is highly significant (10 and 15 clusters, respectively) in comparison to the average number of
clusters identified on these random gene sets (0.9 and 1.4
clusters). This is strongly indicative that the clustering tendency observed here is a specific characteristic of TRX regulated genes, and not a general feature of short genes
(Additional data file 5).
In the analysis presented here, we have used no information
about homology between genes within clusters to control for
overrepresentation of gene families. Many genomic clusters
corresponding to gene families have indeed been previously
identified [44,45]. Such genomic clusters could cause spurious co-expression because of probe cross-hybridization
between highly similar genes. In fact, some of the clusters that
we have computationally identified do contain members of
the same gene family (Table 2). We have searched for regions
of similarity between the sequences of the genes within each
cluster but no significant pairwise sequence alignments were
found for any cluster (see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we confirmed the reported change in the expression of
these genes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in two clusters
(Figure 2b).

Finally, we used the specific set of 445 genes (302 RefSeq
genes) that are basally expressed in larvae described by Arbeitman et al. [28] to measure the specificity of our results (see
Materials and methods). We were not able to reproduce in
this data set the organization in clusters found in genes regulated by TRX (only one potential cluster was found), indicating that this is not a general feature of the larval stage in D.
melanogaster development.

Chromosomal clustering of genes controlled by other
chromatin regulators
To determine whether the chromosomal organization in clusters is also common to genes regulated by other proteins
involved in chromatin dynamics, we performed a second
microarray expression experiment with mutant larvae for
another such factor, ASH2, and compared the results
obtained in this experiment, as well as previous published
results on the transcriptomes of NURF [46], dMyc [47] and
ASH1 [34], with the results obtained in the microarray analysis of the trx mutant. In all experiments, deregulated genes
have been clustered on the D. melanogaster genome using
the REEF program (Additional data file 6).
The ash2 gene (absent, small, or homeotic discs 2) is another
member of the trxG involved in chromatin-mediated maintenance of transcription [48,49]. The microarray analysis identified 244 genes showing a statistically significant change (at
least 2-fold change, p-value <0.05) in their expression
between mutant and wild-type samples (see Materials and
methods). According to their pattern of regulation, we identified 123 over-expressed genes and 121 under-expressed genes
in the mutant larvae (Additional data file 7). As in previous
studies [32,33], we found the same proportion of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the ash2 mutants. We also
mapped these genes to the genome of D. melanogaster
according to the RefSeq annotations in the UCSC genome
browser, and identified eight clusters of co-expressed genes

NURF is an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling complex [50]. Badenhorst et al. [46] performed a
microarray analysis using larvae from D. melanogaster lacking the NURF specific subunit NURF301. We mapped the list
of 274 genes (265 RefSeq genes) that require NURF301
according to this experiment (the list of up-regulated genes

has not been published) to the genome. We then identified
seven clusters of down-regulated genes using the program
REEF (Table 3).
Goodliffe et al. [47] reported that the Polycomb protein (Pc),
a member of PcG, mediates Myc autorepression and its transcriptional control at many loci. In this study the authors used

performed microarray analysis to examine the effect on gene

expression. We mapped the list of 272 genes (203 RefSeq
genes) up-regulated in this experiment (the list of down-regulated genes is unavailable) and then identified 6 clusters of
co-expressed genes using the program REEF (Table 3).
More recently, Goodliffe et al. [34] extended the studies on
Myc function and reported a coordinated regulation of Myc
trans-activation targets by Pc and ASH1. The ash1 gene
(absent, small, or homeotic discs 1) is also a member of the
trxG [48]. In this work, the authors used RNAi to reduce the
levels of ash1 and conducted microarray experiments [34].
The analysis of these microarrays identified 398 genes with a
substantial change in their expression (239 over-expressed
RefSeq genes and 159 under-expressed RefSeq genes). We
mapped these genes to the fly genome and identified eight
clusters of co-expressed genes (seven clusters of up-regulated
genes and one cluster of down-regulated genes) using the
program REEF (Table 3).
Together, these results suggest that chromosomal organization in clusters is a distinctive feature of some genes controlled by chromatin regulators. To elaborate more on this
hypothesis, we compared the clusters identified in the micro-

array experiments of trx with those identified in the experiments of the other factors at three different levels: common
clusters, common genes in clusters and common genes in the
transcriptome maps (see Materials and methods for further
details). We consider that two clusters from two different
microarrays are matching if and only if they are overlapping
in at least one commonly deregulated gene. The results of the
comparison are shown in Table 4 and, as an example, the regulatory gene profiles of trx, ash2, Nurf, dmyc and ash1 along
the chromosome 3L and the clusters containing these genes
are shown in Figure 3 (the regions of the chromosome harboring the same cluster at the same time in both the trx experiment and another microarray are indicated with gray).
Overall, between 50% (ASH1) and 100% (dMyc) of the trx
clusters are also detected in the other chromatin regulators
(71% on average; Table 4). This strongly suggests that there is
high concordance between the trx clusters and the clusters
inferred for the other chromatin regulators. There is not,
however, an exact equivalence: clusters from different regulators that overlap in genome space with trx clusters may contain different regulated genes. Thus, the intersection between
the genes deregulated by TRX and the genes regulated by

Genomic map of clusters of genes on chromosome 3L that are regulated by several chromatin regulators
Genomic map of clusters of genes on chromosome 3L that are regulated by several chromatin regulators. The location of each gene reported on every
microarray is indicated with a vertical line (up-regulated genes in red, down-regulated genes in green). Genes in the forward strand are displayed above the
chromosome line, genes in the reverse strand are displayed below. Clusters of genes in each experiment are indicated with a triangle in red or green
according to their expression. Clusters present in two or more microarrays are highlighted by gray bands. Clusters of small genes identified along the fly
genome are denoted with a triangle in gray.

other factors in the common clusters ranges from 38%
(ASH1) to 75% (ASH2) of the genes (50% on average; Table
4). Nevertheless, this value dramatically decreases when the
whole transcriptomes of each experiment are taken into
account. In this case, the intersection between the set of genes
deregulated in trx mutant larvae and any other set of genes
whose expression was significantly affected by other chromatin regulators is lower than 20% on average (Table 4). These
results suggest that the clusters identified in common form a
group of gene targets directly or indirectly regulated by these
chromatin regulators. In addition, this clustering is a specific
feature of short and active genes: the average length of deregulated genes in these clusters is 1,135 bp, while the size of
deregulated genes in these microarrays that are not clustered
is, on average, 4,204 bp (Additional data file 8). These clusters overlap with clusters of small genes identified along the
fly genome in the previous section: 75% of them for ASH2,
57% for NURF, 83% for dMyc, 75% for ASH1 (see Figure 3 for
a graphical comparison on chromosome 3L).
The clustering organization reported here might be general
for transcription factor target genes, and not a feature of
genes regulated by chromatin remodeling factors. To rule out
this hypothesis, we have collected microarray data for six
transcription factors to extend the clustering analysis: fkh
(fork head) [51], ey (eyeless) [52], spdk (spotted-dick) [53],
gcm (glial cells missing) [54], Otd (Orthodenticle) [55] and
lab (labial) [56]. We mapped each set of genes to the fly
genome, using the program REEF to identify putative clusters. In most cases, however, no clusters were detected (Additional data file 9), indicating that clustering is not a general
characteristic of transcription factor target genes. The lack of
clustering in these microarrays does not merely reflect the
larger gene size for the targets of these genes (Additional data
file 10).
Finally, we used the expression data published by Riedl et al.
[57] as a negative control to qualitatively assess the signifi-

cance of our results. The information has been obtained from
two microarray experiments involving rover and sitter larvae
to study foraging locomotion in the fruit fly [57]. The intersection between these transcriptomes and the trx transcriptome
is only slightly lower than that observed between TRX and the
other chromatin regulators (6% and 9% for rover and sitter,
respectively). However, only five clusters in total were
detected among the genes regulated in the rover and sitter
microarrays (2 and 3 clusters, respectively). Of these, only
one mapped to chromosome 3L and none overlapped the trx
clusters (Table 3).

Analysis of co-expressed genes that constitute the
clusters
The genomic structure of the gene clusters governed by chromatin regulators does not appear to be homogeneous. The
average size of clusters in the trx mutants is 3.5 genes, while
the genomic region that harbors such genes contains, on average, 6.7 genes (Additional data file 2). For instance, although
the cluster shown in Figure 4a contains four genes down-regulated by TRX (depicted in green), there are five additional
genes annotated in this genomic region (depicted in blue) for
which no change in expression was detected in the microarray. In addition, the comparison of the clusters identified in
the different microarrays indicated that, as already outlined,
only about 50% of the genes in a cluster regulated by either
TRX or another chromatin regulator are actually deregulated
in both experiments at the same time (Table 4). In many
cases, therefore, either genes in the equivalent clusters from
different experiments do not show the same regulation pattern or the boundaries of the clusters are not exactly the same.
For example, the same cluster containing eight genes shown
in Figure 4a, b was identified by the program REEF in both
the trx and the ash1 microarrays. However, there are three
interesting differences: the gene boundaries of the clusters
when considering only the regulated genes are not the same;
the expression of the genes changes in the opposite sense

We used the whole-genome expression data generated by
Hooper et al. [30] to investigate whether all genes within the
genomic expanse of the trx clusters, and not only those defining the clusters themselves, are co-expressed (there are 162
genes within the region of the trx clusters, but only 97 in the
clusters). For this dataset, Hooper et al. measured the expression of genes during the first 24 hours of embryonic development in D. melanogaster (1 hour time points). We used the
data between 4 h and 24 h to minimize the possibility that the
maternal effect could mask zygotic expression (see Materials
and methods). Co-expression was evaluated both by using
only those genes that define the trx clusters and using all
genes located within the boundaries of each cluster. Based on
the expression data provided in [30], we computed the
Pearson's correlation coefficient between each pair of genes
within the same chromosome across the 20 time points. For
each cluster, the level of co-expression was then defined as
the mean of Pearson's correlation coefficients between all
pairs of genes in the cluster (see Materials and methods). As
a reference set, we calculated the same values for each possible artificial cluster of N consecutive genes in the genome (2
≤ N ≤ 15).

were produced using the program GFF2PS [102]. (c) Graphical
comparison between co-expression of genes in trx and artificial clusters,
according to the expression data provided in [30]. For each cluster, the
co-expression level was computed as the mean of Pearson's correlation
coefficient between all pairs of genes in the cluster. The distribution of coexpression values within the boundaries of the trx clusters (including all
genes or only the deregulated ones) is clearly skewed to the right,
indicating much stronger co-expression than expected at random.

The distribution of values obtained for the clusters containing
only the genes deregulated in trx mutants, the clusters containing all genes mapped within the boundaries of the clusters and the artificial clusters of several sizes using the 4 h-24
h expression data set are shown in Figure 4c. Interestingly,
the distribution of co-expression levels in randomly generated clusters of different sizes appears to be slightly positive
(means ranging from minimum to maximum), probably suggesting an overall induction of transcription during the first
stages of larval development. The distribution of co-expression levels computed within the boundaries of clusters, and,
in particular, computed only from the regulated genes defining the clusters, is, however, clearly skewed to the right, indicating much stronger coexpression than expected at random.
The bimodal shape of the distribution, more accentuated
when considering only the genes defining the clusters, suggests the existence of a class of clusters with tight regulation
of expression. The deviation from randomness in the trx clusters is perhaps more appreciable in the cumulative plots
(Additional data file 11).
Therefore, genes present within the genomic boundaries of
the trx clusters, including those not in the defined clusters,
are overall co-expressed. There are several causes that can
explain the existence of additional genes within the boundaries of a trx cluster. These genes might not have been included
in the clusters either because they were not in the array (4
cases out of 65 additional genes), because the gene showed a
different pattern of regulation (up-regulated instead of downregulated or vice versa, 1 case), or because the expression

intensity from the microarray was below the selected thresholds (60 cases).

After mapping the up-regulated and down-regulated genes of
the trx mutant from D. melanogaster to the other Drosophila
genomes, we used the program REEF with the same set of
parameters to identify putative clustering of these genes. The
number of clusters detected in these species is shown in Table
5: 20 clusters in D. simulans (corresponding to 7 up-regulated clusters and 13 down-regulated clusters in the trx
microarrays), 25 clusters in D. yakuba (11 up-regulated clusters, 14 down-regulated clusters) and 14 clusters in D. pseudoobscura (1 up-regulated cluster, 13 down-regulated
clusters). We have compared the clusters obtained in D. melanogaster with the clusters identified in these three species:
24 out of 25 clusters (96%) identified in D. melanogaster
were conserved in at least one other species (80% of the clusters were conserved in D. melanogaster and two more species, 36% of the clusters were conserved in all species). In
contrast, the percentage of clusters identified in these species
that was not detected in D. melanogaster was very low (0% in
D. simulans, 16% in D. yakuba, 14% in D. pseudoobscura;
Table 6), indicating that this set of deregulated genes is similarly organized in the genome of these species. The distribution of clusters on each genome is shown in Figure 6 (the
clusters of D. melanogaster that are conserved in other species have the same identifier as in Figure 1).

Clusters may contain both up- and down-regulated
genes
The trxG members are known to be positive regulators of
transcription [24]. However, in our study, we found a similar
number of up-regulated compared to down-regulated genes
in the trx mutants. Similar results have recently been
reported for ash2, ash1 and Nurf301 [33,34,46], suggesting
that trxG proteins might also act directly or indirectly as
repressors of certain genes. We once more applied the REEF
clustering strategy, but this time considering all trx deregulated genes together, irrespective of the direction of their regulation. In addition to the 25 clusters previously detected, this
method allowed us to identify six additional 'hybrid' clusters
(with both up- and down-regulated genes). Moreover, we also
enriched previously detected clusters with genes regulated in
the opposite direction (Figure 5). In total, we identified 129
deregulated genes that were organized in 31 clusters.

The chromosomal clustering is conserved in other
species
The clusters of genes detected here might be acting as transcriptional units with coordinated transcriptional regulation.
One would therefore expect some level of conservation of
cluster organization across species. The genomes of multiple
species of Drosophila have been recently made available
through the UCSC genome browser [38], allowing investigation of the conservation of trx clusters in other Drosophila
species. Only three of these genomes have been completely
assembled: D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura
[58]. We have mapped all D. melanogaster genes to the
genomes of each of these species using the BLAT alignments
provided by the UCSC genome browser [59] (see Materials
and methods). The number of genes annotated on each species using this method is shown in Table 5.

Another genome of interest for the identification of homologous clusters potentially regulated by the trx gene is that of
Anopheles gambiae [60]. We obtained the list of putative
Anopheles orthologs to the D. melanogaster genes using the
ENSEMBL annotations [61]. Less than 50% of the fly genes
could be mapped to the mosquito genome in this way (Table
5). Consequently, only 7 clusters were identified. Most of
these clusters, however, were conserved in D. melanogaster
(Figure 6 and Table 6).
In the work presented here, we identified a set of 25 gene clusters in D. melanogaster that are phylogenetically conserved
in other flies. However, given the strong synteny between the

For each species, we show: number of genes for which an ortholog in D. melanogaster was found, number of orthologs for up-regulated genes,
number of orthologs for down-regulated genes, number of up-regulated clusters, number of down-regulated clusters, total number of clusters,
number of deregulated genes from D. melanogaster that constitute the clusters.

Drosophila genomes (see divergence time estimates in Table
6), we can not claim that the conservation of clusters that we
observed is not simply a consequence of such an overall synteny. To discard such a hypothesis, for each cluster identified
in D. melanogaster we examined the number of genes in
common found in the corresponding cluster in each of the
other Drosophila species (allowing for gene rearrangements
and chromosome inversions inside the region; see Materials
and methods for further details). We also analyzed the
number of genes in common between the corresponding
flanking areas of these clusters in order to compare the
number of genes that are conserved inside and outside them;
the results are shown in Table 6. While the genes that constitute the clusters of trx in D. melanogaster are mostly the
same in the clusters of the other species (96% in D. simulans,
88% in D. yakuba, 96% in D. pseudoobscura), the number of
conserved genes in the vicinity of each cluster decreases in
more distant species (86% in D. simulans, 64% in D. yakuba,
58% in D. pseudoobscura). Additional statistical tests confirmed these observations (see Materials and methods).
According to these results, we conclude that the overall synteny between the Drosophila genomes is not enough to

explain the high level of conservation observed in the clusters
of genes deregulated by TRX in D. melanogaster.

Clusters of deregulated genes are enriched in some
functional categories
In order to characterize the clusters previously identified in
D. melanogaster, we functionally annotated their constituent
genes (Additional data file 12) using Gene Ontology (GO)
[62]. GO is a hierarchical dictionary of biological terms structured into three main categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. We also annotated the
function of the full set of genes in our microarray and of the
genes that were reported to be up-regulated or down-regulated to estimate the statistical significance of our results.
We analyzed the information available for the genes of each
respective set (12,120 genes in the microarray, 535 deregulated genes, 97 genes in clusters) at the third level of the
molecular function ontology (see Materials and methods). A
graphical representation of the more abundant categories for
each of the three gene sets is shown in Figure 7a. The clusters
of down-regulated genes are significantly enriched in struc-

Functional annotation of genes deregulated in trx mutants

well as structural components of the peritrophic membrane
(p-value <0.005; see Materials and methods). The set of upregulated genes is also, albeit to a lesser extent, enriched in
these categories, while no over-representation is observed in
the complete set of genes in the microarray (Figure 7). A more
detailed inspection of the functional annotations of the clusters reveals that this over-representation is due to the abun-

dance of genes involved in the subcategory 'chitin binding'
[62].
According to this, the clusters of genes deregulated in the trx
mutant contain a significant number of genes involved in
cuticle structure and other related functions. To confirm
these results, we performed a whole-genome clustering of the
genes from D. melanogaster according to their functional

Genome Biology 2008,

annotation in GO, in which no expression data were used (see
Materials and methods). We focused, in particular, on the two
functional categories over-represented in the clusters of
genes deregulated in trx mutants: structural constituents of
cuticle (GO:0042302) and chitin binding (GO:0008061).

in many cases, but they can be found both upstream or downstream of the gene [64-66]. Several methods have been proposed to detect PRE/TRE elements in genomic sequences.
For example, Ringrose et al. [67] developed a computational
approach to detect potential PRE/TREs and identified 167
candidates in the fly genome, some of which were validated
experimentally [67]. More recently, several ChIP-on-chip
experiments have been performed to search for PcG targets.
Among others, Schwartz et al. [68] determined the distribution of the PcG proteins Pc, E(z) and Psc and of H3K27me3 in
the whole genome, Tolhuis et al. [69] constructed a map of
binding patterns of the PcG proteins Pc, esc and Sce in chromosomes 2L and 4, and part of chromosomes 2R and X, and
Negre et al. [70] analyzed the binding profile of the PcG proteins Pc and ph, and the GAGA factor in certain regions of
chromosomes 2L and X.

We found 98 genes annotated as components of the cuticle in
the genome of D. melanogaster. Using the program REEF
with the same set of parameters, we identified 12 clusters of
genes involved in cuticle structure (shown as blue stars in Figure 7b), 8 of which are located on chromosome 3L. We found
67 genes annotated as chitin binding proteins and identified
6 clusters, 5 of which are also located on chromosome 3L
(shown as purple circles in Figure 7b). Of the 18 functional
clusters, 8 overlap the clusters of genes regulated by TRX
(shown as red and green marks in Figure 7b). In addition,
most genes in the functional clusters are annotated as being
in the same functional categories (Additional data file 13).

Clusters of genes deregulated in trx mutants are
enriched in tissue specific genes
We have also attempted to characterize the expression pattern of genes in the trx clusters. Using data from the Li et al.
[63] study, in which the tissue distribution of genes expressed
18 hours before the larval to pupal metamorphosis in D. melanogaster was determined, we characterized the expression
of the members of three different gene sets (genes in the
microarray, deregulated genes, genes in clusters; see Materials and methods for further details); results are shown in Figure 8a. As expected, the proportion of genes in our microarray
expressed in different tissues is very similar to that reported
by Li et al. [63]: 28% are expressed in the central nervous system, 24% in wing discs, 20% in the midgut, 16% in salivary
glands and 12% in the epidermis. Most genes regulated by
TRX, on the other hand, are expressed in the midgut (30%, pvalue <10-5) and in the epidermis (27%, p-value <10-6), while
the genes that constitute the clusters regulated by TRX are
abundantly expressed in salivary glands (41% of genes, pvalue <10-5). We compared the tissue-specific expression pattern of the genes in the trx clusters with the functional annotation of these genes as inferred through the GO annotations
(see previous section) and results are shown in Figure 8b: 16
of 25 clusters (64%) contain genes that are either expressed in
salivary glands or code for structural cuticle proteins. In
addition, the clusters appear to be divided into those containing genes expressed in salivary glands and those containing
genes coding for structural proteins. Together, these results
demonstrate that TRX plays a key role in the regulation of
clusters containing genes involved in the structure of the cuticle during the larval stages of D. melanogaster development.

PRE/TRE predictions and experimental approaches
The PcG and trxG complexes bind to sequences called PRE/
TREs. However, not only is the genomic distance between
well-characterized PRE/TREs and their target genes highly
variable, ranging from a few nucleotides to more than 60 Kb

Volume 9, Issue 9, Article R134

Blanco et al. R134.14

We mapped the PcG target sites identified in each of these
experiments (251 sites in Schwartz et al. [68], 131 sites in Tolhuis et al. [69] and 36 sites in Negre et al. [70]) and the 167
PRE/TREs predicted by Ringrose et al. [67] in the fly genome
(assembly dm2, April 2004). We then compared the location
of the 25 clusters of genes deregulated by TRX in the fruit fly
genome with the location of the PcG target sites and the PRE/
TRE predictions (Figure 9). Since the distance between the
PRE/TRE and its target gene can be highly variable, we
decided to confine the search to the PcG binding regions or
PRE/TREs that were located at most 100 Kb distant from our
clusters. According to this restriction, we found 14 out of 25
clusters (56%) near one experimental evidence or a PRE/TRE
prediction, five of which were supported by both a PcG binding site and a PRE/TRE (Additional data file 14). We performed ChIP analysis of third instar larvae, using both antiTRX and H3K4me3 specific antibodies, to test the possible
binding of the TRX protein to some of the predicted PRE/
TREs [67] that are in close proximity to the trx deregulated
clusters. Preliminary results seem to indicate that TRX is
capable of binding to at least two of the PRE/TREs tested
(Additional data file 15). In keeping with its role as a histone
methyltransferase, TRX binding correlates with the presence
of H3K4me3.

Discussion

In this study we have compared the whole-genome expression profiles of trx mutant and wild-type fly larvae and
located the deregulated genes on the fly genome. Considering
the stringent threshold used in this study, it is possible that
the total number of regulated genes may be underestimated.
In the absence of genome-wide ChIP data, we can not assess
TRX binding and its putative relationship with H3K4 trimethylation, but taking into account that most active genes
have this mark in most species, it is tempting to speculate that

the TRX protein itself or another member of this group
should be responsible for it. Nevertheless, the genome mapping revealed the tendency of some trx deregulated genes to
cluster within a few genomic locations with 97 genes (about
20% of all deregulated genes) organized in 25 genomic clusters covering less than 400,000 bp (about 0.3% of the fly

genome). This appears to be a distinctive feature of the regulatory networks of other chromatin regulators. Indeed, our
microarray experiments on ash2 mutants, as well as experiments performed on NURF [46], dMyc [47] and ASH1 [34],
indicate that the genes regulated by these chromatin factors
are also clustered in the fly genome. Remarkably, these clus-

ters are a subset of the trx deregulated clusters, despite that
only about 20% of the trx deregulated genes are also deregulated in these other experiments. In fact, the number of genes
in clusters is likely to be also underestimated, because of the
thresholds used to establish deregulation. Moreover, when
using the time course whole-genome expression data during
the first 24 hours of embryonic development [30], we observe
an overall positive correlation between the expression levels
of all genes within the boundaries of the trx clusters (irrespective of whether they are included in the clusters themselves).
Similar results are observed when using the transcription
maps generated across the fly genome in the same developmental stage by Manak et al. [71]. In fact, most genes in the
trx clusters present similar patterns of overlapping transcribed fragments (transfrags; Additional data file 16). In
addition, we found a significant under-representation of nonexonic transfrags within our clusters (the observed overlap
between transfrags and clusters was 100 bp and the expected
overlap was 2,610.8 bp, χ2 homogeneity test, p-value = 0).
Since the presence of transfrags in the vicinity of genes is
often an indication of alternative transcription initiation and
termination sites, their under-representation suggests that
the boundaries of the genes in these clusters are under tight
transcriptional control.
Some clusters detected here have been previously described
in the literature. For instance, clusters 9 (Lcp65A, larval cuticle proteins) and 21 (Ccp84, cuticular genes cluster), both
down-regulated in the trx microarray, are two well-known
groups of genes involved in the determination of the physical
characteristics of the insect cuticle [72,73]. Other interesting
examples are clusters 11 (Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp27) and 13
(Sgs3, Sgs7, Sgs8), which are up-regulated in trx deficient
flies and down-regulated in flies lacking ash2 or Nurf301.
Hsp23, Hsp26 and Hsp27 are heat shock genes also
expressed in the absence of stress during embryogenesis and
metamorphosis in D. melanogaster but their role in these
processes is not well understood [74,75]. Sgs3, Sgs7 and Sgs8

form a cluster of genes that code for proteins that are part of
the salivary glue secreted by Drosophila larvae to fix themselves to an external substrate for the duration of the prepupal and pupal periods [76,77]. Both clusters were previously reported to be regulated by the 20E- inducible BroadComplex (BR-C), an early ecdysone response gene complex
that is active during larval to pupal metamorphosis and
encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors [78,79].
Although Sgs expression is known to be indirectly controlled
by BR-C [80], up-regulation of br (a member of BR-C) in trx
mutants could explain the up-regulation of both clusters.
Consistent with this hypothesis, br has a reduced level of
expression in ash2 and Nurf301 mutants, where such clusters
are down-regulated, suggesting BR-C can be an intermediate
step in the regulation of the expression of Sgs and Hsp clusters. Homeotic genes are also clustered in the genome and
their expression state is maintained by PcG and trxG proteins
after the initial transcriptional regulators disappear from the
embryo [27]. In our trx mutant microarrays most homeotic
genes did present a decrease in expression; however, the difference was inferior to the fold change threshold selected to
filter and normalize the expression data. In addition, homeotic complexes are substantially larger than the trx clusters
reported in our work, which suggests that the computational
tools used here should be reconfigured to detect them.
We compared the results of several ChIP-on-chip experiments on different fragments of the fruit fly genome that have
already been published [68-70] and the set of computational
PRE/TRE predictions obtained by Ringrose et al. [67] with
the location of our clusters. The analysis of this information
is, however, difficult due to the different conditions in each
experiment, the genome coverage of them and the limited
knowledge of the PRE/TRE sequences [26]. In contrast to
vertebrates, it seems that only around 30% of PcG binding
sites are within 2 Kb of a promoter in flies, complicating the
assignment to specific genes [81]. Half of the gene clusters
deregulated in trx mutants are close (less than 100 Kb) to

functional PcG binding sites or PRE/TRE predictions, suggesting that some clusters may be directly regulated by TRX,
while others can be under indirect regulation. A recent study
presented evidence for the existence of arrays of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) and genomic regulatory blocks in five Drosophila species [82], giving rise to some
controversy about whether PRE/TREs might be found inside
those regions or not [26]. We mapped the HCNEs identified
by Engstrom et al. [82] to our clusters (Additional data file
17), detecting a significant under-representation of such elements in comparison to the rest of the genome (the observed
overlap between HCNEs and clusters was 190 bp, and the
expected overlap was 1,342.7 bp, χ2 homogeneity test, p-value
= 0).

are in support of the selective constraints to maintain the
cluster organization.

Multiple genome-wide approaches for the detection of clustering organization have been published (see Hurst et al. [8]
for a review), and a variety of computational approaches
towards that end have been developed [20,40,41,83]. Comparison of the results, however, is complex because of several
reasons: the lack of a standard definition of a cluster (from
series of two/three adjacent genes to groups of 10-30 genes),
the statistical engine is different, even in the same species,
different sets of genes were used, or the biological conditions
(tissues/developmental stage) of the study are not comparable. The clusters presented here are located in relatively small
regions of the genome (average cluster size of 15,918 nucleotides) in contrast to larger clusters reported in previous
studies (cluster length between 20 and 200 kb in [20]). In
addition, we tolerate within the boundaries of the genomic
clusters the presence of genes that are not shown to be regulated in the microarray data (only adjacent co-expressed
genes were accepted in clusters in [20,21]).
The growing body of evidence supporting the existence of
non-random gene distribution in genomes [8] indicates that
genome organization may be partially evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. Phylogenetically conserved clusters
of co-expressed genes have recently been reported in human
and mouse [84,85], while adjacent pairs of essential genes
that are evolutionarily conserved have been shown to cluster
in regions of low recombination [86]. In fact, neighboring
genes are thought to experience continuous concerted expression changes during evolution, which can lead to the formation of clusters of co-expressed genes. However, the pattern of
expression might be evolving slowly within the clusters. On
the other hand, some clusters may be maintained by natural
selection because of their similar biological functions [87].
Recently, a comparative analysis of the genomes of 12 Drosophila species has been published [88,89]. Here, we identified a set of 25 clusters in D. melanogaster that are
phylogenetically conserved in D. simulans, D. yakuba and D.
pseudoobscura. The conservation that we have observed in
these clusters is stronger than the overall synteny among the
Drosophila genomes. Our preliminary results on A. gambiae,
which diverged from Drosophila about 250 million years ago,

Lee and Sonnhammer [90] recently reported the existence of
a link between functional pathways in the KEGG dabatase
[91] and the chromosomal distribution of genes involved in
them. Here, we functionally annotated the genes constituting
the clusters of genes deregulated in the trx mutant using GO
[62], and detected a significant enrichment in structural proteins involved in cuticle formation and chitin metabolism. To
assess the importance of this overrepresentation, we
extracted all genes of the fruit fly genome annotated with
these functions and used the program REEF to identify
potential clusters on this set of genes. Remarkably, there is a
high overlap between the map of functional clusters and the
map of regulatory clusters. The overrepresentation of structural proteins involved in cuticle formation suggests that the
trxG proteins analyzed here may play a role in the hormonal
response that takes place during metamorphosis. Indeed, a
function for the histone methyltransferase protein TRR
(Trithorax-related) as a coactivator for the ecdysone receptor
[92] and a direct link between NURF and ecdysteroid signaling in larval to pupal metamorphosis [46] have been
reported. If genes involved in larval/pupal transition, such as
the ones described here, are among the trxG targets, a putative explanation for the preferential localization in chromosome 3L may be just that 67% of the functionally annotated
clusters of genes involved in cuticle structure are located in
this chromosome. Moreover, it is known that many mutations
affecting trxG genes (either null alleles or heteroallelic combinations) are lethal at the third instar larval stage, probably
due to a large dowry of maternally loaded mRNA, and do not
undergo larval to pupal metamorphosis. In spite of other phenotypic differences between these larvae, it is tempting to
speculate that lethality could be caused by desiccation due to
defective cuticle secretion and that the trxG/PcG regulation of
the clusters could have a pivotal role in metamorphosis.

Conclusion

Further experiments correlating gene expression states and
chromatin modifications in specific tissues during development as well as chromatin protein binding maps will be
required to understand the complex role of trxG proteins.

Materials and methods
Drosophila strains
All Drosophila strains and crosses were kept on standard
media with 0.025% bromophenol blue. The reference line
used was the w1118iso; 2iso; 3iso isogenic line from the DrosDel
Collection [93]. To reduce the differences in the biological
background between the alleles under study and the reference
strain, we transferred chromosomes X, Y and 2 from the isogenic line to the TM6c-balanced ash2I1, and to trxB11 and trxE3
alleles, which were used in trans-heterozygosity. Their geno-

Microarray data collection

Microarray design
Microarrays were printed on Corning UltraGAPS slides
(Corning, Corning, NY, USA) at the Plataforma de Transcriptòmica (SCT - PCB, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain) using the
Drosophila Genome Oligo Set version 1.1 (Operon Biotechnologies Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA), a collection of 14,593
probes representing 13,577 Drosophila genes with Flybase ID
(12,120 genes in RefSeq). The 70 mer Arabidopsis sequences
from TIGR [94] and spots with no material or with buffer
were also printed to be used as spike-in and negative controls,
respectively. The microarray annotation is deposited in the
Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number
GPL3797. Wandering blue-gut staged Tb+ early third instar
larvae were selected in all cases to extract total RNA using the
RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). At
least two independent total RNA extractions were carried out.
Quality was assessed in all samples using the Eukaryote Total
RNA Nano Assay on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total RNA from w1118;+;+
larvae was used as a common reference. Four microarrays
were hybridized for each experiment in biological replicate
pairs, such that the total RNA from the sample used as a starting material came from different extractions. Both arrays
from each pair were hybridized with the same amplified RNA
from sample and common reference (obtained using the
Amino-Allyl Messageamp II aRNA Amplification Kit from
Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) using dyes Cy3 and Cy5 (GE
Healthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Microarray analysis
GenePix Results (GPR) data files were obtained for each
microarray with an Axon 4000B scanner and GenePix Pro 6
(Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). All GPR files
were analyzed with the Limma package from BioConductor
[95,96] using the same criteria. The spots not fulfilling the
quality thresholds (based on spot size, foreground versus
background signals, saturation, coincidence between differently calculated ratio measures and R2 of regression ratio)
were eliminated from the analysis, and the data were background corrected with the normexp method and normalized
using OLIN [97]. Between-array normalization was carried
out independently for each set of four arrays using the mad
method from OLIN, and a linear model was fitted and corrected with False Discovery Rate (FDR) [95]. We obtained
lists of genes that were differentially expressed two-fold in the
mutants compared to the isogenic strain (FDR-corrected pvalue lower than 0.05). Raw and normalized data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (user name:
sergiba_rev_1, password: 2139861083) with the accession
number GSE8783, which includes the data for trx (GSE8748)
and ash2 (GSE8750) mutants.

two-fold in the larvae (302 RefSeq genes). We extracted the
gene expression data for Nurf301-/- from Badenhorst et al.
[46] (only the list of down-regulated genes was published).
The set of up-regulated genes in response to dmyc overexpression was taken from Goodliffe et al. [47]. We extracted
from Goodliffe et al. [34] the set of up and down-regulated
genes when the regulatory activity of ash1 was repressed
using RNA interference to study the interaction between the
dMyc complex and ASH1. We used the expression data from
two microarray analyses (rovers and sitters) about foraging
locomotion from Riedl et al. [57] as a negative control in the
clustering process. The set of genes expressed in five different
tissues (midgut, salivary glands, epidermis, central nervous
system and wing disc) studied in the larval stage of D. melanogaster was obtained from Li et al. [63].

Real-time RT-PCR analysis
Reverse transcription reactions with RNA independently isolated in Trizol from all mutant alleles and the reference were
used to synthesize cDNA with M-MLV RT (Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions. We used 1 μl of a 1/10 dilution of cDNA on each quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR was
performed on the ABI PRISM® 7700 following the recommended protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Each sample was replicated three times and average values
were used for further analysis. Data were analyzed by the
ΔΔCT method, being normalized by subtracting the value of
the control gene dia. TaqMan primers and probes designed
and synthesized by Applied Biosystems for this analysis were:
Dm02371023_s1 (CG30458); Dm02366349_s1 (CG30457);
Dm02366353_s1 (CG10953); Dm01792445_s1 (CG14567);
Dm01792458_s1 (CG14572); Dm01792469_s1 (CG14565);
Dm01792478_s1 (CG14564); and Dm01811206_g1 (dia).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP assays were essentially performed as previously
described by Papp and Muller [98] with the following
changes: 40 wandering third instar larvae were fixed with
1.8% formaldehyde solution for 25 minutes at room temperature, collected in 700 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris
HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM EDTA) and disrupted 6 times for 20
seconds at 30% of a Branson sonifier. Samples were centrifuged at top speed at 4°C and aliquotes of 100 μL of extract
were used per immunoprecipitation. Ten percent of the
immunoprecipitated extract was used as input, and a sample
immunoprecipitated without antibody as a precipitation control. A 300 bp fragment corresponding to the transcription
start of the Ultrabithorax gene, which has been previously
described to present a TRX binding site [98,99], was used as
a positive control. TRX antibody was a gift from A Mazo and
H3K4me3 antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. The prim-

To evaluate the significance of the number of clusters identified in our microarray, we generated 100 randomly generated
sets with the same size and chromosomal gene distribution of
the real sets of genes regulated by TRX. We then performed
the clustering analysis in such data sets to find out how many
clusters could be obtained by chance (expected clusters). The
Z-score of the results observed in our microarray was thus
calculated using the distribution of clusters identified in the
random sets:

Gene mapping in the genome
All gene sets were mapped in the genome of D. melanogaster
using the RefSeq track of the UCSC genome browser [38]
annotations (genome assembly dm2, April 2004). We considered only one transcript per gene (the first one present in the
annotations). The file refGene.txt was used to retrieve the
coordinates of each gene in RefSeq. The official name and the
description of each gene were retrieved from the file
refLink.txt. The statistics of gene distribution on each chromosome were computed using the 19,670 unique RefSeq
genes contained in the file refGene.txt as well. To measure the
statistical significance of the gene distribution, we randomly
generated 1,000 rounds of sets of genes with the same size to
evaluate the p-value of each result using a hypergeometric
distribution. We used the BLAT alignments between the RefSeq genes from D. melanogaster and the genomes of D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura to produce a catalogue
of genes for these species (Additional data file 18). On each
genome distribution, the file xenoRefGene.txt contains the
best BLAT hits of the genes of other species in that genome
[38]. We selected only the best hit for each RefSeq gene from
D. melanogaster in the corresponding genome distributions
of D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura. The sets of
up- and down-regulated genes in the trx microarray were
then mapped in those genomes using the appropriate catalogue of genes. We used the list of orthologous genes between
D. melanogaster and A. gambiae provided by the Biomart
tool [100] from ENSEMBL. The association between the
ENSEMBL gene identifier and the official gene name in the
fruit fly genome was used to cross this information with the
set of RefSeq genes of fly annotated in the UCSC.

Cluster identification
We define a cluster as a group of neighboring genes located in
a limited region of the genome, not necessarily consecutive,
that show the same expression pattern (up-regulation or
down-regulation) in the microarray experiment. Clusters are
determined by the physical position in the genome, the
number of co-expressed genes inside and the total number of
genes in such a genomic fragment. The length of the clusters
can be then defined in terms of nucleotides or number of
genes annotated on that region. We follow two similar
approaches to computationally detect the clusters in the sets
of genes in our work: the program REEF and our own implementation of a clustering program. No significant difference
was observed between the results obtained with both computational approaches.

where x is the number of observed clusters in the trx microarray, and μ and σ are the mean and the standard deviation of
the distribution of number of clusters found in the random
sets, respectively.
To evaluate whether regulation by TRX imposes a stronger
clustering tendency compared to gene size, we extracted all
genes from the fruit fly genome whose size is within the range
delimited by the size observed in genes from trx clusters
(average size 946 bp, standard deviation 788 bp). We thus
mapped the 6,626 genes that match this condition on the
genome to get their coordinates and identified 107 clusters,
using the REEF program. In order to assess the statistical significance of the clustering (and to measure which parameter,
trx regulation or gene size, is more discriminant in the clustering), we repeated the analysis on 100 sets of genes that
were randomly selected, preserving the gene distribution
observed in the dataset of short genes. As an additional control, we also counted how many clusters can be identified in
100 different random sets of 260 genes (number of up-regulated genes) and 275 genes (number of down-regulated
genes), which preserve the same gene size distribution
observed in both lists of deregulated genes in our trx microarray (average and standard deviation).
The program REEF [41] identifies regions of a genome
enriched in specific features, compared with a reference landscape of feature density. The two input files are: the list of reference features (genes annotated in the fly genome) mapped
on a genome sequence; and the list of selected features among
the reference set (genes regulated by TRX in our microarray)
with their genomic positions and the number and the length
of the chromosomes in the genome under consideration.
REEF scans the reference genome using a sliding window
approach, calculating the statistical significance of each window using the hypergeometric distribution and the FDR. The
windows are defined as fragments of a fixed genomic length.
Consecutive significant windows form a cluster of regional
enriched features. Using an approach similar to that used by
Spellman and Rubin [20], we defined the optimal set of
parameters comparing the growth function in the number of
clusters obtained in random sets and in the real reference set
for different values (Additional data file 19). The optimal con-

bp; minimal number of co-expressed genes, 3; q-value

microarrays, we computed the percentage of co-expressed
genes that was present in each pair of equivalent clusters (the
ratio between the number of common genes and the total
number of genes on each cluster).

Cluster identification based on gene density

Two clusters of genes identified in two different genomes are
considered to be equivalent when the percentage of genes that
are present in both clusters is 50% or higher. To calculate the
percentage of genes that are common in two clusters, the
genes that are located in a different relative order within the
clusters are considered to be conserved. Clusters of genes that
are conserved in different strands of the chromosomes are
considered to be equivalent as well (allowing for chromosomal inversions in the flanking regions). The length of the
left and right flanking areas of each cluster is equal to the
number of genes of the corresponding cluster. To measure the
statistical significance of these results, we randomly sampled
10,000 artificial clusters of seven genes in D. melanogaster
(the average size of our clusters is 6.7 genes) and found the
location of the equivalent cluster on the other genomes. We
examined the number of genes shared between each artificial
cluster of genes in D. melanogaster and its equivalent cluster
conserved on each of the other Drosophila species. Each artificial cluster on each genome was constituted of the corresponding gene and the three genes annotated before and after
in the same location (the average length of our clusters is 6.7
genes). The results are shown in Table 6. The conservation of
the artificial clusters in terms of common genes is more similar to the conservation observed in the flanking area of our
clusters (90% in D. simulans, 79% in D. yakuba, 65% in D.
pseudoobscura). In fact, the difference between the number
of conserved genes inside our clusters and inside the artificial
clusters is significant in all the species (D. simulans p-value
<10-3, D. yakuba p-value <10-3, D. pseudoobscura p-value
<10-6; Wilcoxon test). Similar results were obtained in the set
of clusters detected in A. gambiae (Table 6).

We have also implemented our own approach in Perl to cluster the genes regulated by a certain gene. Basically, we scan
the genome following a sliding window approach combined
with the hypergeometric distribution to evaluate the statistical significance of the clusters. The length of the windows is
determined, however, in terms of genes rather than nucleotides. Thus, the clustering process is not limited by a fixed
window length. Some parameters in this algorithm must be
adjusted in order to maximize the sensibility and specificity.
Firstly, only clusters of at least three genes showing the same
sense of deregulation were considered. Another important
parameter is the size of the window to apply. Using the results
in random sets, a window size of seven genes was selected as
the optimal length (the number of clusters found in trx data
seems to grow logarithmically with the size of the window
used, while the number of clusters found in random sets
grows exponentially). We used our algorithm to scan the
chromosomes of D. melanogaster using window lengths of
seven genes, advancing one gene between two instances of the
window so that all possible seven-gene windows were tested.
To avoid multiple testing problems, we took a conservative pvalue threshold of 10-3. Consecutive statistically significant
windows were merged up in only one cluster. Results
obtained with our clustering strategy are highly concordant to
those produced by the REEF program (Additional data file 3):
27 clusters were detected (22 identical clusters, 2 clusters
with additional genes, 3 new clusters and 1 missing cluster).

Clustering characterization and comparison
We computed different values on the genes that constitute the
clusters (using the file refGene.txt downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser): the average gene length, the gene
length distribution, the number of bidirectional/opposed
genes on each cluster according to their strand, and the average intergenic distance. Such values were compared to those
observed in the whole set of genes annotated in the fruit fly
genome, to evaluate their significance. The comparison
between the clusters of genes regulated by TRX and the clusters regulated by other chromatin regulators was performed
at three different levels: common genes in the transcriptomic
maps, common genes in clusters and genomic position of the
clusters. The intersection between two transcriptomes is
defined as the quotient between the number of common
genes (twice) and the total number of genes in both experiments. Two clusters from two different microarrays are
matching if and only if they are overlapping in at least one
commonly deregulated gene. Thus, we calculated the clusters
identified in a second experiment (ash2, Nurf, dmyc, ash1)
that were supported by another cluster in the trx microarray
results. Once a set of common clusters was identified in two

Gene co-expression in clusters
Hooper et al. [30] generated whole-genome expression data
for the first 24 h of embryonic D. melanogaster development
by extracting RNA from overlapping 1 h time points for the
first 6.5 h of development and non-overlapping 1 h time
points for the rest. We generated a table containing all pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients between all genes
expressed between 4 and 24 h in the study by Hooper et al.
[30]. For each cluster identified in the trx mutants, we computed the mean of all pairwise correlation coefficients
between the genes constituting the cluster to assess if they are
co-expressed along the embryonic development. We also calculated the mean, including all the genes included in the
boundaries of each cluster. As a reference set, we computed
the same value for each set of correlative N genes in the
genome (2 ≤ N ≤ 15). We then evaluated if each particular
cluster was located in any of these tails and the total percentage of clusters that were found in these tails.

We downloaded the GO terms and relationships (file
gene_ontology_edit.obo, release 1.2) and the associations
between gene products from D. melanogaster and GO terms
(file gene_association.fb, release 1.94) from the GO web site
[62]. We annotated different gene sets (full set of genes in the
trx microarray, the up-regulated and down-regulated genes
in the same experiment, the clusters identified in such coexpression sets) using the annotation available at level 3 of
the 'molecular function' ontology tree. We climbed up in the
ontology to obtain the corresponding parent term at level 3
for those genes that were annotated at deeper levels in the
hierarchical tree. The statistical analysis was performed using
hypergeometric distribution to test the probability of observing a given GO term significantly enriched in genes belonging
to such clusters:

In this case, G is the number of up- or down-regulated genes,
A is the subset of G that are annotated in that GO term, k is
the number of genes up- or down-regulated in clusters, and n
is the subset of k annotated in the GO term.
We performed a whole-genome clustering of the genes from
D. melanogaster annotated with the hierarchies based on the
term structural constituents of cuticle (GO:0042302). No
data about gene expression in the microarrays were used
here. We first extracted the fly genes annotated with the following GO terms: structural constituent of cuticle
(GO:0042302); structural constituent of chitin-based cuticle
(GO:0005214); structural constituent of chitin-based larval
cuticle (GO:0008010); structural constituent of pupal chitinbased cuticle (GO:0008011); structural constituent of adult
chitin-based cuticle (GO:0008012); and structural constituent of collagen and cuticulin-based cuticle (GO:0042329).
Then, we used the program REEF to identify clustering
organization events in this gene set (the same configuration of
parameters set in the case of co-expressed genes). We also
performed a whole-genome clustering of the genes from D.
melanogaster annotated with the hierarchies based on the
term chitin binding (GO:0008061). We first extracted the fly
genes annotated with the following GO terms: chitin binding
(GO:0008061); polysaccharide binding (GO:0030247); carbohydrate binding (GO:0030246); and pattern binding
(GO:0001871). Then, we used the program REEF to identify
clustering organization events in this gene set.
