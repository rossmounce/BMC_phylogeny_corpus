Abstract
Background: Salinity is known to affect almost half of the world's irrigated lands, especially rice
fields. Furthermore, cyanobacteria, one of the critical inhabitants of rice fields have been
characterized at molecular level from many different geographical locations. This study, for the first
time, has examined the molecular diversity of cyanobacteria inhabiting Indian rice fields which
experience various levels of salinity.
Results: Ten physicochemical parameters were analyzed for samples collected from twenty
experimental sites. Electrical conductivity data were used to classify the soils and to investigate
relationship between soil salinity and cyanobacterial diversity. The cyanobacterial communities
were analyzed using semi-nested 16S rRNA gene PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
Out of 51 DGGE bands selected for sequencing only 31 which showed difference in sequences
were subjected to further analysis. BLAST analysis revealed highest similarity for twenty nine of the
sequences with cyanobacteria, and the other two to plant plastids. Clusters obtained based on
morphological and molecular attributes of cyanobacteria were correlated to soil salinity. Among
six different clades, clades 1, 2, 4 and 6 contained cyanobacteria inhabiting normal or low saline
(having EC < 4.0 ds m-1) to (high) saline soils (having EC > 4.0 ds m-1), however, clade 5 represented
the cyanobacteria inhabiting only saline soils. Whilst, clade 3 contained cyanobacteria from normal
soils. The presence of DGGE band corresponding to Aulosira strains were present in large number
of soil indicating its wide distribution over a range of salinities, as were Nostoc, Anabaena, and
Hapalosiphon although to a lesser extent in the sites studied.
Conclusion: Low salinity favored the presence of heterocystous cyanobacteria, while very high
salinity mainly supported the growth of non-heterocystous genera. High nitrogen content in the
low salt soils is proposed to be a result of reduced ammonia volatilization compared to the high
salt soils. Although many environmental factors could potentially determine the microbial
community present in these multidimensional ecosystems, changes in the diversity of cyanobacteria
in rice fields was correlated to salinity.

Background
The Indian agriculture is suffering with many man-made
problems like canal irrigation, pesticide and chemical fertilization application. However, the former is responsible
for salt accumulation in the soil which is further expanding due to water-logging in paddy fields. Salinization is
predicted to result in 30% of farmable land loss globally
within the next 25 years, and up to 50% by the year 2050
[1]. In developing countries like India and China, the
problem could be more serious due to the increasing
demand for rice as a staple food. If water-logged conditions prevail for lengthy durations salinization of the soil
occurs and, in India, this is commonly known as the formation of Usar land [2]. High salt concentrations lead to
a decline in soil fertility by adversely affecting the soil
microbial flora, including nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria
and therefore further decreasing rice productivity.
Cyanobacteria, the ancient oxygen-evolving photoautotrophs, are the dominant microbial inhabitants of rice
fields. Members of the orders Nostocales and Stigonematales assume a special significance in this environment [3].
Salinity adversely affects photosynthesis and therefore
productivity [4], the functioning of plasma membranes
[5], ionic balance in the cells [6] and protein profiles [7,8]
of some phototrophs including cyanobacteria. However,
salinity does not affect all cyanobacteria to the same
extent due to their morphological and genomic diversity
[9,10], and therefore the distribution of cyanobacterial
communities in natural habitats is not uniform. The adaptive ability of cyanobacteria to salinity makes them the
subject of intense biochemical and ecological investigation [11].
The classical methods for cyanobacterial identification
and community assessment involve microscopic examination [3,12,13]. This assessment has, however, been criticized on the grounds that morphology can vary
considerably in response to fluctuations in environmental
conditions [14]. In addition, the perennating bodies of
cyanobacteria such as hormogonia, akinetes and heterocysts may be difficult to characterize by microscopy and
thus the actual diversity can be underestimated [15]. In
view of the above, cyanobacterial diversity assessments
and community analysis should be investigated by microscopic observation supplemented with a molecular taxonomy. Therefore, cyanobacterial diversity assessments
using molecular tools have been widely applied [16]. The
application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) along with PCR for studying natural cyanobacterial assemblages has increased our understanding of their
complexity in environmental samples [17]. Among the
various gene sequences used to assess cyanobacterial biodiversity, 16S rRNA gene has been applied most often
[16].

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/4

Cyanobacterial diversity has been assessed from a variety
of geographical locations, including the Colorado plateau
[18,19], exposed dolomite in central Switzerland [20], hot
springs [21], the McMurdo Ice Self [22], and Southern Baltic Sea [23] using a combination of 16S rRNA gene PCR
and DGGE. A considerable number of studies have been
done on DGGE based identification and phylogenetic
characterization of toxic cyanobacteria [24-26]. In contrast to above, cyanobacteria have been characterized only
at morphological level in rice fields of India [27,28],
Bangladesh [29], Chile [30], Pakistan [31], Korea [32] and
Uruguay [33]. However, the work of Song et al. [34] constitutes the only known report on the biodiversity assessment of cyanobacteria in rice paddy fields (Fujian, China)
during September 2001 to January 2002 using molecular
tools.
Despite the considerable negative impact of salinity on
physiology of pure cultured cyanobacterium as observed
under laboratory conditions, nothing is known regarding
its effect on the biodiversity of cyanobacteria in rice fields
having different salt levels. Thus there is a need to examine how salinity-induced changes among other physicochemical properties of soil affect the distribution of
cyanobacteria in paddy fields. In view of the reports by
Stal [35,10] that cyanobacteria have a remarkable yet varying flexibility to adapt to a wide range of environmental
conditions, we propose that the resilient physiologies of
certain cyanobacteria, including exopolysaccharide production, afford resistance to higher salinity compared to
strains with relatively simpler morphologies. Further,
high salinity inhibits ammonia volatilization [36], and
this would result in soils with high nitrogen content and
favor the proliferation of non-heterocystous cyanobacterial genera. This study was undertaken to provide first
hand data on cyanobacterial diversity using PCR-DGGE,
and correlate it to different salt levels of soil to investigate
salinity-induced changes in the distribution of cyanobacteria in Indian rice fields. Further, how far the salinity
affects the agriculturally important cyanobacteria was also
examined.

Results and discussion
Physicochemical analyses of soil
Eight different parameters, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+/K+
ratio, SAR, EC and pH were taken into consideration for
the measurement of salinity levels in soil. In addition to
this, available phosphorus and total nitrogen were also
estimated to determine the nutritional status of the soil.
PCA analysis was performed to correlate the soil properties, especially those related to salinity, with the cyanobacterial diversity. Soil properties change significantly due to
salinity in rice fields, which can ultimately determine biodiversity and hence productivity. The PCA analysis
revealed two principal components (PC1 and PC2) with

percentage variances of 43.51 and 19.42, respectively. The
above-mentioned ten parameters distributed into three
clusters (Figure 1A): (i) phosphorus, Na+/K+ ratio and
Mg2+, (ii) K+ alone, and (iii) the remaining six parameters.
This suggests that there are three major physicochemical
variables that could significantly affect the cyanobacterial
diversity in these rice fields. Among the different cations
examined, Na+, which constituted the largest fraction of
both soluble and exchangeable ions in the soil, had the
most obvious influence on cyanobacterial distribution
(indicated by the longest distance from the point of origin
in the PCA plot) [37]. This result is reflected in the observation of Onkware [38] who observed deleterious effects
of soil salinity (mainly Na+) on plant diversity and distribution in the Loburu delta of Kenya.
The sampling sites showed a wide range of Na+ concentrations (2.12 â 9.15 ppm) and EC (1.89 â 7.55 ds m-1),
thereby indicating a saline-sodic nature of the soils [39].
However, the highest EC (7.55 ds m-1) and Na+ (9.15
ppm) were observed in the soil of Rauri. In contrast to
this, the soils of Madhopur and Parasurampur had the
lowest EC (1.89 ds m-1) and Na+ (2.12 ppm) levels,
respectively. The regression analysis between Na+ and EC
(P < 0.05) also showed a wide distribution of soil samples
(Figure 1B). Further, K+ content in saline soils was very
low; lowest in the Rajatalab soil samples. This probably
contributes to high Na+/K+ and thus the sparse population
of cyanobacteria observed since K+ is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis, cell turgor and protein synthesis [40]. K+ also plays a vital role in extreme
environments, both as an extracellular signal and as an
intracellular metabolic regulator [40] essential for growth
and metabolism. Microscopically, the lower Na+/K+ ratio
was shown to support luxuriant growth of cyanobacterial
mats. Although regression analysis revealed that cyanobacterial diversity decreased with an increase in Na+/K+
ratio, a significant correlation between the number of
cyanobacterial phylotypes (in terms of DGGE bands) and
Na+/K+ ratio was not confirmed. This result is in contrast
to that reported by Parker et al. [41] who demonstrated K+
toxicity to Microcystis in natural ponds. The soil of Makara
also had a low Na+/K+ ratio but was associated with a
sparse cyanobacterial population, however, this could be
attributed to a high pH in this case.
A high SAR recorded for these soils (Table 1), ensues limitation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ due to Na+-induced displacement
of these cations [42], which may be responsible for thin
cyanobacterial population in these soils [39]. A relatively
low concentration of Ca2+ and very high Mg2+ content of
the soil from Jaddopur was due to the Mg2+ induced deficiency of Ca2+ [42]. In addition, the pH was found to
range from neutral (Anei and Parsurampur, 7.40) to
highly alkaline (Rauri, 9.04). A significant negative corre-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/4

lation (P < 0.05) observed between pH and the number of
cyanobacteria in every soil sample, reflects the optimal pH
for cyanobacterial growth at 7.5. This is supported by the
fact that most diverse cyanobacterial group of this study,
Anabaena and Nostoc prefer neutral to slightly alkaline soil
[27]. Further, the concentration of available phosphorus
in the soils varied between 13.65 (Chauki) and 103.71
ppm (Parsurampur). This fluctuation in the availability of
phosphorus may also be due to the relative presence of
monovalent (Na+ and K+) and divalent (Ca2+ and Mg2+)
cations since the former are responsible for soluble and
the latter for insoluble phosphorus. However, the regression analysis between available phosphorus and cyanobacterial populations does not demonstrate any
significant relation. This can be due to the fact that 1.0
ppm available phosphorus has been reported to be sufficient for the growth of plants [43,44]. In contrast to this,
available nitrogen was found to be negatively correlated
(P < 0.05) with number of cyanobacteria (Figure 2B). This
can be explained in the light of the observation of FernÃ¡ndez-Valiente et al. [45] who demonstrated inhibitory
effect of nitrogen fertilizers on the growth of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in paddy fields. Since the studied paddy
fields have high diversity and population of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, salinity-induced increase in available
nitrogen [36] may eliminate their population. The positive correlation between available nitrogen with EC, Na+
content, pH and SAR (P < 0.05) finds support with the
observation of El-Karim et al. [36] that nitrogen availability in saline soil depends on EC, Na+ and Ca2+ content visa-vis SAR and pH.
EC, the most appropriate parameter to characterize soil
salinity [46], was employed to classify the soil samples
into two categories, normal (hereafter low) (< 4.0 ds m-1)
and saline (hereafter high salinity) (> 4.0 ds m-1) soil [39].
This classification divided the sample soils into the following: (i) low salinity: Anei, Bardah, Bakesh, BHU, Jaddopur, Kataka, Madhopur, Maharupur, Makara,
Misirpura, and Phootia, and (ii) high salinity: Aswania,
Bithwal, Chauki, Kartihan, Parsurampur, Rajatalab, Rauri,
Sewapuri and Teduababa. The regression analysis showed
a significant negative correlation (P < 0.05) between the
cyanobacterial population and EC (Figure 2A). Further,
the influence of EC on cyanobacterial population was
found highest among other parameters as reflected by a
high r value (0.75) in regression analysis.
Microscopic observation of cyanobacterial community
Microscopic observation of the samples revealed the presence of diverse forms of cyanobacteria with most belonging to the order Nostocales. Cyanobacterial communities
of rice fields were composed of the morphologicallydefined genera Anabaena, Nostoc, Aulosira, Cylindrospermum, Gloeotrichia, Rivularia and Tolypothrix of the order

terms of cyanobacterial genera present at specific sites, are
provided in Table 2. This observation is supported by the
microscopic observations of Ali and Sandhu [31] and
Tiwari and Singh [28], who reported occurrence of these
cyanobacteria in saline soils of the Punjab, Pakistan and
slightly acidic soil of rice fields of Manipur, India respectively. These cyanobacteria were previously characterized
from different soil types in India [47]. Further, Pereira et
al. [30] reported occurrence of different species of Anabaena, Nostoc, Cylindrospermum and Gloeotrichia in rice
fields of Chile. In this study, the number of above-mentioned genera varied considerably across different samples. Samples from the hypersaline conditions also
generally contained non-heterocystous filamentous and
unicellular genera. In contrast to this, the mesosaline samples had a population with more heterocyst-forming
cyanobacteria. The sample from BHU showed maximum
cyanobacterial diversity with minimal diversity present at
Kartihan and Rauri, in terms of cyanobacterial genera
present. However, a general trend of a larger number of
cyanobacteria in low salinity soils than high salinity soils
was observed. In this study the presence of Aulosira in a

large number of samples was supported by the results of
Singh [2], who suggested it to be the dominant genus in
Indian rice paddy fields.
DGGE and molecular diversity
Molecular identification was used to support the morphological classification of cyanobacteria. This polyphasic
approach to rice field cyanobacterial systematics provided
a basis for comparison with previously identified taxa and
also for future comparisons with taxa with similar physiologies. The characterization of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA
gene by PCR-DGGE is shown in Figure 4. Different banding patterns for each soil sample were observed, with a
total of 73 delineated PCR products. Bands that showed
significant reproducibility and minor changes in intensity
after triplicate analyses were selected for further assessment. A total of 51 bands was selected for sequencing on
the basis of their relative position on the gel and band
intensity. However, BLAST analysis showed that only 31
DGGE bands had significant difference in their sequences.
This may be due to that fact that DGGE is a very sensitive
technique and can detect single nucleotide differences in
a sequence [48], however, these differences may be insignificant in terms of percentage similarity across the entire
molecule.

cyanobacterial genera have also been characterized from
rice fields of China and Thailand [34,49]. As reported elsewhere, most of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained
from DGGE did not share absolute identity to the
sequences obtained from cultured cyanobacteria [50,51].
Of the sequences analyzed, 58% belonged to heterocystous Nostocalean genera having highest similarity with
species of Anabaena and Nostoc. This finds support with
the observation of Nayak and Prasanna [27]. Molecular
data were found to agree with morphological attributes
except in few cases, which may be due to either missing
DGGE band information or phenotypic plasticity. Further, the results suggested a wide distribution of Aulosira
across a range of salinities. In summary, the rice fields of
Eastern Uttar Pradesh contained numerous species of the
nitrogen-fixing Anabaena and Nostoc but have Aulosira (A.
fertilissima) as the most cosmopolitan cyanobacterium.

cyanobacteria, and 2 with plastids of diatoms and higher
plants. Table 3 compares the data on the similarity of
DGGE bands sequences to representatives from various
cyanobacterial genera. Six PCR fragments (A. doliolum, A.
anomala, A. oryzae, and A. variabilis) showed high similarity to Anabaena (96â99%), four (N. endophytum, N. muscorum and Nostoc sp.CCG3) with Nostoc (94â98%), two
with Aulosira (A. fertilissima and Aulosira sp. PP615) (95%
each.), Cylindrospermum (Cylindrospermum sp. A1345 and
CENA33) (95 and 98%), Gloeotrichia (both with G.
echinulata) (94 and 98%) and Hapalosiphon (H. welwistchii
and Hapalosiphon sp. CCG6) (94 and 96%), and one each
with Rivularia (Rivularia sp. PCC7116) (95%), Tolypothrix
(Tolypothrix sp. PCC7415) (95%) and Fischerella (F. muscicola) (87%). Of the different 16S rRNA gene sequences
having similarity to non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, two
had matches with Lyngbya (highest similarity with an
uncultured Lyngbya sp. followed by Phormidium corium
and Microcoleus sp.) (97 and 98% with uncultured Lyngbya
sp.) and one each with Oscillatoria (O. spongeliae) (95%
with uncultured Oscillatoria sp.), Phormidium (P. inundatum) (94%), Aphanothece (Aphanothece sp. OES3853)
(96%) and Gloeothece (Gloeothece sp. SK40) (96% with
uncultured Gloeothece sp.) (Table 3). The remaining two
sequences showed similarity with unidentified cyanobacteria (at 95 and 96% identity), and one each with the plastids of a diatom (95%) and tobacco (96%). These

For assessment of the genetic relatedness among different
cyanobacteria and description of the genetic diversity in
relation to salinity levels of the different soils, a neighbor
joining tree was constructed using additional 43
sequences of 16S rRNA gene from cyanobacteria and plastids from database along with the 31 sequences obtained
in this study (Figure 5). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of
Bacillus and Flavobacterium were used as out-groups. The
phylogenetic tree showed six different clades supported by
significant bootstrap values (1000 data resamplings), of
which clade 1 belonged to the Nostocalean genera Anabaena and Nostoc. The correlation between the phylogenetic analysis and the distribution of cyanobacteria
according to the salinity level may be particular for this
ecosystem. Clade 1 also harbored two species of Gloeotrichia and one of Cylindrospermum. While all identified
species of Anabaena were mainly confined to low salinity
soils, except for Anabaena sp. (DGGE band 7) present in
the sample from Parsurampur, all species of Nostoc were
distributed over a range of salinities. Further, in this study,
the two strains of Cylindrospermum and Gloeotrichia were
found in soils with low salinity. The presence of Nostoc
and Anabaena in same clade may be explained by the close
genetic relatedness among these species [52]. Clade 2
exclusively contained branched heterocystous cyanobacteria of the genera Hapalosiphon and Fischerella from soils
having a moderate to high salinity (Figure 5). The monophyletic origin of heterocystous taxa also finds support
with the results of Gugger and Hoffmann [53] and
Rajaniemi et al. [52]. This was accompanied by a small
clade of Rivularia strains (3), obtained from soil of low
salinity. Further, Rivularia and Gloeotrichia, both members
of family Rivulariaceae were found in two different clades
and are therefore genetically distant but morphologically
similar [54].
Aulosira, Phormidium and Lyngbya formed clade 4 with
sparse occurrence of Anabaena oryzae, Anabaena anomala

and uncultured cyanobacteria (correspond to plastid 16S
rRNA gene). All of these species were found within sites
having a wide range of salinities suggesting that the species in this clade (clade 4) are salt tolerant. Of these Aulosira emerged most widely distributed among the sample
sites. Densely aggregated trichomes, macroscopic structure and the presence of a thick exopolysaccharide layer
are the mechanisms that could permit this ecological
adaptation [10]. Further, Zulpa de Caire et al. [55] have
reported that salinity induces the synthesis of exopolysaccharides, which may help to tolerate high salinity. This
molecular data highlights the role of Aulosira in the nitrogen budget of this region and in the potential reclamation
of Usar (saline) land by aggregating the soil particles [2].
Sequences of clade 5 were present in high saline soil in
this study and included Oscillatoria and Gloeothece. However, presence of cyanobacteria belonging to Chroococcales and Oscillatoriales in same clade may be due to their
polyphyletic origin [56]. Rest of the species fell in clade 6
consisting of DGGE band similar to Aphanothece and
uncultured cyanobacteria.
The nucleotide diversity was measured using Tajima-Nei
model, which assumes equal substitution rates among
character positions and between transitions and transver-

sions. This model revealed the minimum evolutionary
distance among members of Stigonematales. However,
maximum genetic diversity was observed among the
members of Nostocales. This may be due to the lower
prevalence of Stigonematales compared to Nostocales in
this phylogeny. Genetic distances were highest between
Nostocales and Oscillatoriales and minimum between
Chroococcales and Oscillatoriales.
Based on these observations, salinity tolerance in cyanobacteria would appear to be an adaptive trait that has
evolved in parallel to speciation. Since this observation is
based on 16S rRNA gene, a highly conserved gene, the better picture of salinity tolerance would probably emerged
using the gene sequences not much conserved so may represent the effect of environmental variables on diversity of
cyanobacteria. This finds support with the work of Jaspers
and Overmann [57] that microorganisms vary considerably in their genomes and thus ecophysiologies even with
similar ribosomal gene sequences. Thus the mechanism
for salinity tolerance may well be conserved in closely
related cyanobacteria but differs considerably across this
group of prokaryotes and may be attributed to genome
plasticity in cyanobacteria.

The cyanobacterial strains mentioned in parenthesis represent the close similarity of respective DGGE bands with cultured cyanobacterial strains.

These results demonstrated that the morphological characters and molecular phylogeny were almost congruent
for these populations that contained a large number of filamentous and heterocystous species either with or without branching. It is established that the morphology of
unicellular cyanobacteria is not as well defined and thus
there is a considerable difference between morphology
and the 16S rRNA gene based phylogeny for this group.
Therefore, the morphological characters for the identification of cyanobacteria and its agreement with the phylogenetic classification depends largely on the type of
cyanobacteria in question.
Salinity-induced changes in cyanobacterial community
Figure 6 demonstrates the diversity of cyanobacteria in
selected rice fields with different salinity levels. It was

anticipated that salinity would play a dominant role in
determining the cyanobacterial diversity in this environment. However, in some cases pH was also a determining
factor. Low salinity soils had greater cyanobacterial diversity (as measured by 16S rRNA gene DGGE bands) compared to soils with very high EC values. Dominance of
cyanobacteria in these paddy fields based on band intensity on gels was not calculated, since gene abundance may
be due to the varying number of 16S rRNA gene per cell or
PCR amplification biases [58]. However, the application
of DGGE in combination with group-specific PCR for
microbial ecology and diversity assessment is a widely
accepted methodology [15]. In this study, Nostoc emerged
as the second most prevalent and salinity adapted cyanobacterial genus after Aulosira. Again, this could be attributed to its colonial habit, macroscopic structures and

thick extracellular mucilage, which provide protection
from osmotic fluxes in the environment [59]. This observation finds support with the report of Mollenhauer et al.
[60]. The presence of Gloeothece and Oscillatoria (O.
spongeliae) in the rice fields having high salinity can be due
to high nitrogen content in these soils and suggests that

they can sustain high salt. In addition, species of Aphanothece, Hapalosiphon and Rivularia present in the soil of
Jaddopur may uphold high Mg2+ in comparison to the
cyanobacteria from other regions. High concentrations of
Ca2+ and low Mg2+ in the soils of Rauri and Rajatalab,
respectively, also seemed to select for a specific cyanobacPage 11 of 17

terial community. Finally, the most diverse population of
cyanobacteria (as revealed by DGGE) was from the rice
fields of site with low salinity that was characterized as
having neutral to slightly alkaline pH and low EC while
being phosphorus replete.
Relatively low salinity levels favored the growth of heterocystous cyanobacteria while high salinity (more than 4 ds
m-1) appeared to select for non-heterocystous species (Figure 6). Since high salinity reduces ammonia volatilization
[36], the high nitrogen content in saline soil would be detrimental for heterocystous cyanobacteria [45]. Likewise,
Staal et al. [61] demonstrated that in less saline conditions, the glycolipid envelop of a heterocyst provides a
selective advantage over non-heterocystous cyanobacteria. The distribution of phylogenetic relationships across
environmental gradients is not well understood. However, here we obtained a distinct relationship between
cyanobacterial occurrence and salinity levels using both
morphological and molecular data. This ecosystem is
characterized by numerous overlapping factors other than
salinity. Therefore, the community structure that was
described here may vary with other environmental perturbations.
Soil salinity is one of the major determinants of cyanobacterial distribution and diversity in the rice fields of Eastern
Uttar Pradesh. This study has shown that salinity influences cyanobacterial species distribution in rice fields,
whereby high salinity soils selectively support the growth
of non-heterocystous cyanobacterial populations. Threats
imposed by ever-increasing salinity have resulted in thin
cyanobacterial populations that lead to a reduction in biological nitrogen fixation and increased demand of chemical fertilizers in the paddy fields.

Methods
Sampling sites, sampling and biochemicals
A total of 20 rice fields situated in six districts of Eastern
Uttar Pradesh were selected for sampling (situated from
24Â°56' to 26Â°06' N and 81Â°14' to 83Â°19' E). The names
of villages and dates of sampling are listed in Figure 7 and
translated into sample numbers (see Table 2). The sites
were selected having consideration that (i) the sampling
should be random, and (ii) rice fields should not be much
disturbed. The samples were collected during September
2006, which is the monsoon season in this part of India
and considered the optimal period for cyanobacterial
growth. Climatic factors such as light, humidity and rainfall were uniform since all sites are located in the same
geographical region. Although, some reports state that
cyanobacterial diversity is better correlated with water
characteristics in rice fields [62], others describe an affiliation with soil properties [63]. In view of the presence of
cyanobacteria deep within the soil of rice fields [34], latter

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/4

proposal seems more feasible. The soil samples were collected on sunny days having temperatures between 27 to
30Â°C and between the hours of 10.00 and 11.00 AM
(IST). The collected samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at -20Â°C. All experiments relating
to the physicochemical properties of soil and PCR-DGGE
were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice to
ensure the reproducibility of the results. All biochemicals
were procured from the Sigma Chemical Co. USA unless
otherwise specified.
Chemical composition of soil samples
For the analysis of pH and electrical conductivity (EC), 50
ml of double-distilled deionized Milli-Q water was added
to 10 g of soil and homogenized. The suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for the measurement of pH and EC using
a pH (Systronics, India) and EC (Hanna Instruments, Portugal) meters respectively.

For Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ analysis, 5 g of soil was predigested with concentrated H2SO4. To this, H2O2 was
added drop-wise until the solution became colorless. This
solution was incubated on a hot plate at 70Â°C for 2 h and
the process was repeated thrice. When the solution
became dry, 10 ml of double-distilled deionized Milli-Q
water was added. The resulting solution was analyzed
using a Perkin Elmer 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer [64]. The sodium absorption ratio (SAR) was calculated using the formula:

SAR = Na + / â [(Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ ) / 2]
Available phosphorus was measured using the method of
Olsen et al. [65]. One gram of soil was mixed with 20 ml
of 0.5 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) and 200 mg activated charcoal. This was shaken for 30 min at 200 g in an environmental
shaker
(Model-3597-ICOGMPR,
USA)
maintained at 25Â°C followed by filtration through Whatmann No. 1 filter paper. The pH of extract was maintained
to 5.0 using concentrated H2SO4. The extract was then
quantified for phosphorus content using molybdophosphoric acid [66].
Ammonia- and nitrate-nitrogen were measured by extracting 10 g of soil in 50 ml 2 M KCl and Morgan's Reagent
(pH 4.8) respectively. In each sample 250 mg activated
charcoal was added to obtain the clear supernatant. These
were subjected to filtration through Whatmann No. 1 filter paper and used for ammonia-nitrogen measurement
by phenate method [67] and nitrate-nitrogen estimation
using the procedure described by Jackson [68]. Data were
presented in terms of total nitrogen (combination of
ammonia- and nitrate-nitrogen).

each district is given in the material and methods section).

Microscopic observation
The samples were microscopically analyzed using a trinocular microscope (Kyowa, Getner, Japan). The morphological characteristics of the cyanobacteria were compared
with those in the literature of Desikachary [3] and Geitler
[12]. Photo-documentation was performed with a digital
camera and 40Ã magnification (Olympus).
Genomic DNA isolation and PCR amplification of 16S
rRNA gene
Total genomic DNA from the natural samples (paddy
field soil and cyanobacterial mat) was isolated using the
phenol and lysozyme-free method of Srivastava et al. [69].
The DNA thus obtained was passed through a spin column containing Sepharose 4B for the removal of salts and
humic acids. Soil and mat samples were selected for DNA
isolation from perennating bodies and growing cyanobacteria respectively. The primers CYA106F (CGC ACG GGT
GAG TAA CGC GTG A) and CYA359F (GGG GAA TYT
TCC GCA ATG GG) with a 40 nucleotide GC clamp (5'CGC CCG CCG CGC CCC GCG CCG GTC CCG CCG

for amplification of a segment of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA
gene [70] were synthesized (Sigma Chemical Co., USA). A

semi-nested PCR reaction was carried out with the first
reaction using primers CYA106F and CYA781R followed
by a reaction with primers CYA359F and CYA781R. PCR
was performed in a 25 Î¼l final volume of reaction mixture
containing 100 ng of DNA, 2.5 Î¼l of 10Ã PCR buffer with
15 mM MgCl2, 200 Î¼M dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer,
200 Î¼g bovine serum albumin (nuclease free) and 0.2 U
Taq DNA polymerase (Bangalore Genei, India) in an Icycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The thermal cycling profile was as
follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94Â°C, followed
by 35 amplification cycles each consisting of 1.5 min
denaturation at 94Â°C, 1 min annealing at 59Â°C, and a 2
min elongation at 72Â°C, with a final 5 min elongation at
72Â°C.

The PCR products of mat and soil samples obtained after
the second PCR reaction were subjected to DGGE analysis
using the DGGE-2001 system (C.B.S. Scientific Company,
Inc. USA). An aliquot of 25 Î¼l of PCR product was mixed
with 5 Î¼l of 10Ã gel loading solution (100% glycerol,
0.25% bromophenol blue and 0.25% xylenecyanole) and
applied directly onto a 6% polyacryamide gel (acrylamide/bis 38.93/1.07) (w/v) in 1Ã Tris-acetate-EDTA
(TAE) buffer with a linear 35â55% denaturant gradient
(100% denaturant solution contained 7 M urea and 40%
(v/v) deionized formamide). A gradient dye solution
(0.5% bromophenol blue, 0.5% xylenecyanole and 1Ã
TAE buffer) was used to check the gradient formation.
DGGE was carried out at 60Â°C (constant temperature) for
16 h at 100 V (35 mA). The gel was stained for 15 min
with ethidium bromide (1 Î¼g ml-1 in 1Ã TAE buffer) and
visualized by UV transillumination and photographed.
The PCR (16S rRNA gene) products of cultured Anabaena
PCC7120, Anabaena doliolum LCR1 and Hapalosiphon intricatus BHULCR1 were included as genetic markers on each
gel alongside the environmental samples (data not
shown).
Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene
A total of 51 bands were carefully excised from the DGGE
gels using an autoclaved surgical scalpel and re-suspended
in sterile Milli-Q water for 3 h to elute DNA from the gel
matrix [71]. The eluted PCR products were used as template for re-amplification of the corresponding DGGE
bands using the primer set CYA359F (with GC clamps)
and CYA781R, and subsequently followed by another
DGGE as described above. Only reactions that resulted in
a single band with the predicted mobility were processed
further. The specific bands were again excised and reamplified. PCR conditions were the same as mentioned
above for 16S rRNA gene amplification except the primers
did not have the GC clamp and 0.5 Î¼l template DNA was
used. PCR products were sequenced commercially (Bangalore Genei, India) with the same amplification primers

in separate reactions. However, only 31 DGGE bands
which showed significant difference in their sequences
were selected for further analysis.

[GenBank: EF624390].

Competing interests
Phylogenetic analyses
A multiple alignment was produced using the
CLUSTAL_X ver. 2 [72] and manually corrected using
JalView. Bands with identical mobility on DGGE gel were
considered to have identical sequences. Sequence similarity between the 31 different partial 16S rRNA gene
sequences resulting from DGGE analysis were deposited
in GenBank and assessed by BLASTN [73] homology
searches using the nonredundant NCBI GenBank database. In addition to this, 43 16S rRNA gene sequences
from GenBank, which showed the closest similarity with
the different DGGE-PCR products, were also included in
the multiple alignment. Pair-wise distance matrices were
calculated using the Tajima-Nei method [74]. Character
positions with gaps were deleted. The 16S rRNA gene
sequences of cyanobacteria were classified into phylogenetic groups as proposed by Desikachary [3] for the determination of genetic variability within and between the
groups. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining algorithm [75] provided in MEGA4
[76]. One thousand bootstrap replicates of the alignment
data were also performed and the consensus tree was constructed.
Data analyses
Results of the soil analysis were statistically analyzed
using one-way ANOVA followed by correlation coefficient
(r) analysis using SPSS 10.0. Principal component analysis was performed using Statistica 8.0. For PCA analysis,
the soil analysis data presented in Tables 1 and 2 were
considered. The clustering in the PCA was performed as
per Coeyne et al. [77] using cluster analysis (similarity
measure: Pearson or product-moment correlation coefficient; clustering method: UPGMA). Further, to correlate
cyanobacterial abundance and the physicochemical properties of soil (EC and available nitrogen), each band on a
DGGE gel was treated as an individual species. The total
number of bands present in any individual lane was considered to be the cyanobacterial diversity in that soil sample. Further, for accurate estimation of diversity,
microscopic observations were also compared with the
molecular data. Three independent variables were used
for each experiment.
Nucleotide accession numbers
The 31 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences which showed
significant difference in their sequence were analyzed and
taxonomically assigned using the BLAST program of
NCBI. The sequences were deposited in the database
under the accession numbers [GenBank: EF619446] to
