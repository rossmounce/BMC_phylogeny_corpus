Abstract
Background: It has been shown in a variety of organisms, including mammals, that genes that
appeared recently in evolution, for example orphan genes, evolve faster than older genes. Low
functional constraints at the time of origin of novel genes may explain these results. However, this
observation has been recently attributed to an artifact caused by the inability of Blast to detect the
fastest genes in different eukaryotic genomes. Distinguishing between these two possible
explanations would be of great importance for any studies dealing with the taxon distribution of
proteins and the origin of novel genes.
Results: Here we used simulations of protein sequences to examine the capacity of Blast to detect
proteins of diverse evolutionary rates in the different species of an eukaryotic phylogenetic tree
that included metazoans, fungi and plants. We simulated the evolution of protein genes with the
same evolutionary rates than those observed in functional mammalian genes and with among-site
rate heterogeneity. Under these conditions, we found that only a very small percentage of
simulated ancestral eukaryotic proteins was affected by the Blast artifact. We show that the good
detectability of Blast is due to the heterogeneity of protein evolutionary rates at different sites,
since only a small conserved motif in a sequence suffices to detect its homologues. Our results
indicate that Blast, at least when applied within eukaryotes, only misses homologues of extremely
fast-evolving sequences, which are rare in the mammalian genome, as well as sequences evolving
homogeneously or pseudogenes.
Conclusion: Although great care should be exercised in the recognition of remote homologues,
most functional mammalian genes can be detected in eukaryotic genomes by Blast. That is, the
majority of functional mammalian genes are not as fast as for not being detected in other
metazoans, fungi or plants, if they had been present in these organisms. Thus, the correlation
previously found between age and rate seems not to be due to a pure Blast artifact, at least for
mammals. This may have important implications to understand the mechanisms by which novel
genes originate.

Background
It has been shown that novel genes, that is, genes with a
restricted taxonomic distribution, evolve faster than older
genes. These genes are normally identified by performing
Blast searches [1] in genomes of different organisms.
When genes are detected in only one species or in a group
of very closely related species, these genes are called
orphan genes. Orphan genes were shown to evolve very
fast in bacteria [2] and Drosophila [3]. Genes which are not
strictly orphans, but also have a narrow taxonomic distribution, such as genes present only in rodents, also showed
markedly accelerated rates [4]. In addition, mammalian
genes which are present only in vertebrates exhibited
higher evolutionary rates than genes of precambrian origin [5]. These observations were extended to mammalian
genes classified in four different ages -Old, Metazoans,
Deuterostomes and Tetrapods-, which showed increasingly faster evolutionary rates in genes of more recent origin [6]. Similar conclusions could be deduced from fungi
classified in different linage specificities [7]. Therefore, the
relationship between age and rate seems to apply to genes
of all ages and to different taxa.
The relationship between age and evolutionary rate of
genes not only has importance for using age as one of
many predictors for protein evolutionary rate [8,9], but
also to understand the origin of novel genes. DomazetLoso and Tautz [3] proposed a model to explain how
orphan genes may arise from duplicated genes. In their
scenario, one of the duplicates evolves so fast, probably by
strong positive selection, that its sequence becomes unrecognizable by sequence homology searches. These genes
probably acquire a new function in the lineage where they
evolve. After the origination of the new sequence, evolution slows down due to the constraints imposed by the
conservation of function. Albà and Castresana [6]
extended this model to genes of different times of origin,
and not only to orphans, as one possible explanation for
the correlation found between age and rate of genes. A
logical outcome from this model is that genes evolve fast
in their early stages and then slow down due to increased
functional constraints. This same idea has appeared several times in the literature [10-12]. Although sequence
similarity is lost, the use of the protein structure might
help to detect the original copy from which some of these
genes arose [13,14]. Thus, according to this model, and
despite talking about "novel genes", genes do not appear
de novo in the genome, but originate from a gene duplication. The name "novel genes" would be justified because
the exceptionally fast rates in their initial stages, just after
the duplication, made them unrecognizable from the
sequence point of view and determine their point of birth
from a functional perspective. This is a simplified model
that could be appropriate for the origin of most novel
genes. Notable exceptions where different models may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/53

apply include the origin of slow-evolving orphan genes
[3] or the formation of some novel genes from noncoding
DNA [15].
In most works where Blast has been used to detect putative novel genes in other genomes, the logical concern was
expressed that some of these genes may have been incorrectly classified as novel because, being fast genes, they
simply were not detected by Blast in other organisms. In
the case of the study of mammalian genes of different ages
[6], this was supposed not to have a significant effect
because the same correlation between age and rate was
observed in a set of highly conserved genes, with nonsynonymous rates lower than 0.051 substitutions/position,
where Blast would most probably always find homologues in all genomes. However, Elhaik et al. [16] argued
that the assertion that new genes evolve faster is indeed an
artifact due to the Blast relative performance in sequences
of different evolutionary rates. They based their argumentation on the results from Blast searches using simulated
DNA sequences of the same age and evolving at different
evolutionary rates. Upon classifying these simulated
sequences in different groups according to Blast detection,
DNA rates had averages (but not distributions) similar to
the nonsynonymous rates found in Albà and Castresana
[6]. If the Blast effect could explain the results, the proposed punctuated model for the origin of orphans and
other novel genes [3,6] would not be necessary, since
these genes would be normal genes with just faster rates.
However, there were several features in the work of Elhaik
et al. [16] that made their conclusions difficult to extrapolate to other works. First, they used simulated DNA
sequences and calculated DNA genetic distances, which
cannot be directly compared to nonsynonymous genetic
distances. Second, they performed DNA Blast searches,
which are much less sensitive than protein Blast searches
in which most studies are based. Third, in their simulations all positions in the sequences can experience mutations during evolution, as if they were pseudogenes, and
thus it is again difficult to extrapolate these simulations to
functional proteins, which typically contain motifs and
are easier to detect with Blast.
An important issue regarding the power of Blast to detect
homology is that the information contained in sequences
degrades as these sequences accumulate mutations. However, the point at which the information is completely lost
depends on the type of mutational process. In the present
work, we simulated protein sequences evolving with and
without among-site rate variation in the mutational process, and with evolutionary rates equivalent to those of the
mammalian genome. Our results show that, when
sequences were evolved with among-site rate variation,
the large majority of mammalian genes were able to find
their homologues in the most distant species considered

in this work. This indicates that the large amount of novel
genes found in the genomes of mouse and human (all of
them presumably functional and therefore evolving with
among-site rate variation) and the observed correlation
between age and rate are not due to a pure Blast artifact.
Instead, this correlation may have important biological
implications, since it supports a model for the origin of
novel genes that implies low constraints in the early stages
after the duplication and an increase of constraints with
time.

Results and Discussion
Amino acid rate distributions of mammalian genes
Our previous work showed that the distributions of nonsynonymous evolutionary rates of 4706 mammalian
genes classified in different ages -Old, Metazoans, Deuterostomes and Tetrapods – were very different, with the
youngest genes having faster rates [6]. The species used to
make the age classification by means of Blast homology
searches are shown in Figure 1. Since genes of different
ages were of different length, and to avoid any influence
from this variable, we repeated the calculations with a
subset of genes coding for proteins between 300 and 500
amino acids. Due to this restriction, the total number of
genes was smaller than in the original study (1558 genes
distributed in 900 Old, 502 Metazoans, 134 Deuterostomes and 22 Tetrapods), but now the average length of
genes was close to 400 amino acids for all ages. In addition, since our simulations were performed at the amino
acid level, we calculated the protein evolutionary rate of
the translated sequences (extrapolated from the humanmouse protein genetic distances) instead of the nonsynonymous rate previously calculated from the DNA
sequences.

The shape and mean of the new rate distributions, controlling for protein length, was very similar to the distributions obtained with the original data set (Figure 2A).
There was also a fourfold increase in the mean rate from
the oldest to the youngest genes: 0.11 amino acid substitutions/position in Old, 0.14 in Metazoans, 0.27 in Deuterostomes, and 0.47 in Tetrapods. Genes of all age
categories were involved in all types of biological processes [6], and thus it is very surprising that the oldest genes
are more conserved than the younger genes. Could these
rate distributions be due to a pure Blast artifact, as previously proposed [16]?
Simulations of protein sequences
We set up our simulation experiments to know how many
times the age of mammalian genes was misclassified by
protein Blast. In addition, we wanted to compare the
actual observations about novel genes to the results
obtained with the null hypothesis of a common origin of
all genes (and differential detection by Blast depending

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/53

on speed of evolution). A key feature of our simulation
was the use of rate heterogeneity. The rationale for using
this assumption is that all mammalian sequences whose
origin we wanted to elucidate are present, at least, in
mouse and human (we did not use strict orphan genes,
that is, genes present in a single species), and all of them
have an assigned GO function. Therefore, most of these
sequences are very likely to be functional and evolve
under a rate heterogeneity model. The basic approach was
then to simulate sequences of 400 amino acids evolving
under a rate heterogeneity model, and along a given phylogenetic tree. The branch lengths of the tree were proportional to the approximate times separating the plant,
animal and fungal genomes that were used to classify
genes in different ages (Figure 1). Sequences C and D of
this tree were included only to produce a more homogeneous taxonomic distribution and better view the simulated alignments. This tree was multiplied by different
factors to obtain sequences of different evolutionary rates.
We were specifically interested in knowing how Blast
behaves with sequences of evolutionary rates equivalent
to the rates of mammalian genes. For this purpose, we
measured the exact amino acid rate of each simulation
(genetic distance between A and B) and, from the performed simulations, we randomly pooled a set of genes
with the same overall distribution of rates than the real
ones. Then, we used Blast to classify these simulated
sequences as Old, Metazoans, Deuterostomes or Tetrapods. In this setup, we know that sequences not classified
as Old are misclassified due to Blast detection errors. Figure 2B shows that the number of misclassified genes is
insignificant. Total numbers of misclassified genes were
57 in Metazoans, 16 in Deuterostomes, and 2 in Tetrapods (different pools always produced very similar results).
If we subtracted an equivalent number of misclassified
genes from the distributions of real genes (Figure 2A),
these distributions would almost not change. Thus, the
Blast effect seems to be very small and with no consequence for the age classification of genes. In addition, the
results of these simulations do not fit the observed data,
where a much higher number of novel and fast genes
exists than predicted by the null hypothesis. The existence
of such novel genes thus needs an explanation different
from the Blast artifact.
As expected, detectability values of Blast (that is, the proportion of properly classified genes) clearly showed a
decrease with faster rates. For example, most of the genes
with the highest rates (around 0.825 or 0.925 substitutions/site) were clearly misclassified. But the bulk of
mammalian genes is highly conserved, and for the rate
categories where most of the genes are found detectability
values approach 100%. This shows again that the Blast
effect is not sufficiently strong as to explain the high
number of novel genes found in the mammalian genome

and the tendency of younger genes to evolve faster, at least
when Blast is performed at the protein level and within
eukaryotic genomes.
Heterogeneity of evolution and Blast detectability
As explained above, an important feature of our simulations was the use of among-site rate heterogeneity. When
sequences were simulated without rate heterogeneity,
Blast misclassified much more sequences of the three
youngest categories, affecting genes of almost all rate categories (Figure 2C). This simulation experiment is more
in line with the results found by Elhaik et al. [16]. However, it is important to remark that all mammalian
sequences we used have an assigned GO category, are
present in at least mouse and human, and therefore are
most surely functional. Functional sequences evolve in a
heterogeneous manner: those sites which are most crucial
for function are highly conserved, others are only moderately conserved, and others typically evolve very fast. If
some conserved sites in a sequence are in close proximity,
and even if the sequence has a high overall evolutionary
rate, Blast will find its homologues in very distant species.
As an example, figure 3A shows fragments of sequences
simulated under heterogeneous evolution, which contain
some conserved sequence patches, and Figure 3B shows
homogeneously simulated sequences, where the conservation of all sites degrade equally with time. It is interesting to note that, despite deriving from the same tree,
homogeneously evolved sequences look more divergent

than heterogeneous sequences due to the lack of conserved positions in the former. On the other hand, heterogeneously evolved sequences have conserved positions,
but the nonconserved positions are plagued with multiple
substitutions, thus explaining that the same genetic distances are measured from both alignments. Of course,
Blast behaves very differently in both types of alignments
and detectability of homologues is much higher in the
one evolved heterogeneously (see legend to Figure 3).
Heterogeneity of evolutionary rates within a protein
sequence thus explains why Blast sensitivity is quite
decoupled from overall divergence, at least for moderately
divergent sequences.
Trivial correlation between rate and age in simulated
sequences
Simulated genes that escape Blast detection, and are thus
not classified as Old, will tend to be fast evolving genes,
creating an obvious correlation, as can be seen in Figure
2B, and even more exaggeratedly in Figure 2C. However,
this cannot explain the observed relationship between
gene age and evolutionary rate [16], since the fact that
genes that escape Blast detection evolve fast does not
mean that all fast genes escaped Blast detection. As indicated above, what it is necessary is to subtract the misclassified genes from the set of real genes, and analyze if the
correlation is maintained in the real genes. We have
shown that the proportion of misclassified genes is so
small – when sequences are simulated heterogeneously

and with rates like those observed in mammalian genes –
that the relationship existing between age and rate in the
real data set cannot be explained only by a Blast artifact.

Conclusion
The appearance of novel genes in genomes is one of the
most intriguing aspects in evolutionary genomics. The
danger of miss-classifying fast-evolving genes as novel by
Blast has been clearly exposed by Elhaik et al. for homogeneously evolved sequences [16]. We have shown that,
specifically for mammalian functional genes and for their
detectability by protein Blast within higher eukaryotes,
the loss of sensitivity for the fastest genes does not affect
significantly the overall assignment of the age and rate of

genes. Therefore, these data support a more complex scenario for functional sequences that involves the existence
of a large number of novel genes, many of which happen
to be relatively fast evolving. This correlation between age
and rate may have a crucial biological interest, because it
is consistent with a model of origin of novel genes that
assumes that these genes arose through a gene duplication
and an initial phase of exceptionally high evolutionary
rates. The end of this phase, and the beginning of negative
selection, would indicate the point of birth of these genes.
From here on, increased functional constraints would be
reflected in lower evolutionary rates. However, the history
of every gene is very complex and may include many particularities that cannot be covered by the general type of

study presented here. More detailed studies will be necessary to see if this model of origin of novel genes is true and
to understand the molecular evolution of every particular
novel gene.

Methods
Gene dataset
The results of Blast are highly dependent on the length of
the gene used as query. Since mammalian genes of different ages were of different length [6], and to avoid any

inference from this factor, we extracted the genes encoding proteins between 300 and 500 amino acids from the
dataset in [6]. Now the number of genes was smaller
(1558), but the average length of genes was close to 400
amino acids for all ages (with no statistical differences in
length among them). The distribution of amino acid substitution rates of genes from this subset was very similar to
the one in the original, larger dataset. The list of genes
used is given in additional file 1.

Protein sequence evolution simulations
We simulated protein sequences of 400 amino acids by
means of Rose [17]. This program allows the simulation
of different substitution rates in different positions with a
predetermined spatial pattern. We extracted spatial patterns of rate heterogeneity from 14 different eukaryotic
protein alignments using TreePuzzle [18] with a model of
rate heterogeneity that assumed Gamma distributed rates
with 16 rate categories. In particular, we took, for each
alignment position, the category and associated relative
rate that contributed the most to the likelihood. These relative rates were then used by Rose to simulate different
positions with different rates. The 14 alignments used to
extract relative rates contained a similar set of species than
that of the eukaryotic genomes used in Albà and Castresana [6]. Most heterogeneity patterns produced similar
results in terms of detectability by Blast. The thresholds
for gap insertion and for gap deletion in the simulations
by Rose were set to 0.0001. The PAM model of amino acid
substitution was used. Using these parameters, random
ancestral sequences were evolved along a phylogenetic
tree with branch lengths proportional to the approximate
times separating the genomes used in Albà and Castresana
[6] (Figure 1). Sequences C and D of this tree were
included only to better view the alignments. This tree was
multiplied by 15 different factors (from 0.025 to 5.5) to
obtain sequences of different genetic distances, that is,
evolving at different evolutionary rates. One thousand
simulations were performed for every rate heterogeneity
pattern (derived from each of the 14 alignments) and evolutionary rate, making a total of 210,000 simulations (14
heterogeneity patterns × 15 evolutionary rates × 1000 simulations). In addition, we also simulated another set of
210,000 alignments without using rate heterogeneity but
with all other parameters in the Rose program being identical.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/53

tances were then used as surrogates of evolutionary rate.
The rate measured with Protdist in the simulations is normally slightly smaller than the initial rate used for the simulation, particularly for the highest rates, due to the
saturation of the measured genetic distances, but it provides a better comparison with the rate measured by the
same method in the real genes. To compare the distributions of rates (see below) both the real and simulated
alignments were assigned an evolutionary rate category
according to 0.025 substitutions/position intervals.
From each set of 210,000 simulated alignments we
selected pools of genes belonging to different rate categories in such a way as to maintain, in each pool, the same
evolutionary rate distribution than that observed in the
1558 real mammalian genes. This was achieved by using
a probability of selection of each simulation proportional
to the frequency of its evolutionary rate category in the
real dataset divided by the frequency of its category in the
simulated dataset. Each pool contained a number of simulations close to 1558, the number of genes in the real
dataset, and all extracted pools produced essentially the
same results. This strategy made unnecessary the calculation of explicit Blast detectability values for each rate category and made easier the comparison of expected and
observed results. As all genes were evolved along the same
tree, as if they were Old, the number of real genes expected
to escape Blast detection is directly reflected in the distributions of simulated genes falling in the "Metazoans",
"Deuterostomes", and "Tetrapods" categories.

Blast searches and age classification
The equivalent to the human sequence in each simulation
(sequence A) was used to search by protein Blast the database of all other simulated sequences. The E-value used as
threshold was 10-8 (104 smaller than in Albà and Castresana [6] to account for databases approximately 104
smaller in the searches performed in the present work).
Genes were classified according to the Blast hits.
Sequences present in B, E, F and G were classified as
"Old", present in B, E, and F but not in G as "Metazoans",
present in B and E but not in F and G as "Deuterostomes",
and present only in B as "Tetrapods".

Protdist of the Phylip package [19] with the JTT model of
evolution [20] was used to estimate the protein genetic
distance between human and mouse sequences of the real
data set and between the simulated A and B sequences
(equivalent of human and mouse). These genetic dis-
