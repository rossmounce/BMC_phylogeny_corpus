Abstract
Background: CtBP1 and CtBP2 are transcriptional co-repressors that modulate the activity of a
large number of transcriptional repressors via the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. Many CtBPregulated proteins are involved in pathways associated with tumorigenesis, including TGF-β and
Wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as RB/p130 and HDM2, as well as adenovirus
E1A. CtBP1 and CtBP2 are highly similar proteins, although evidence is emerging that their activity
can be differentially regulated, particularly through the control of their subcellular localisation.
CtBP2s from diverse species contain a unique N-terminus, absent in CtBP1 that plays a key role in
controlling the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of the protein.
Results: Here we show that amino acids (a.a.) 4–14 of CtBP2 direct CtBP2 into an almost
exclusively nuclear distribution in cell lines of diverse origins. Whilst this sequence contains
similarity to known nuclear localisation motifs, it cannot drive nuclear localisation of a heterologous
protein, but rather has been shown to function as a p300 acetyltransferase-dependent nuclear
retention sequence. Here we define the region of CtBP2 required to co-operate with a.a. 4–14 to
promote CtBP2 nuclear accumulation as being within a.a. 1–119. In addition, we show that a.a. 120–
445 of CtBP2 can also promote CtBP2 nuclear accumulation, independently of a.a. 4–14. Finally,
CtBP1 and CtBP2 can form heterodimers, and we show that the interaction with CtBP2 is one
mechanism whereby CtBP1 can be recruited to the nucleus.
Conclusion: Together, these findings represent key distinctions in the regulation of the functions
of CtBP family members that may have important implications as to their roles in development, and
cell differentiation and survival.

Background
CtBP proteins were originally identified as C-terminal
binding proteins of type 2/5 adenovirus E1A proteins [1].
They function primarily in the nucleus as transcriptional
co-repressors, modulating the activity of a large number of

transcriptional repressors via recruitment of chromatin
modifiers such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases and polycomb proteins [2-4], and sequestration of histone acetyltransferases [5]. CtBP proteins also
play a role in the cytoplasm in regulating mitotic Golgi

membrane fissioning [6,7], and also associate with centrosomes during mitosis [8]. CtBP proteins have been
implicated in tumorigenesis, as their interaction with the
C-terminus of E1A is essential for immortalisation of primary rodent cells, and also negatively regulates E1A-mediated transformation, tumorigenicity and metastasis
[1,9,10]. In addition, many transcriptional repressors regulated by CtBPs are involved in pathways associated with
tumorigenesis, including TGF-β and Wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as RB/p130 and HDM2
[11-15]. Presumably, as a consequence of disruption of
some of these critical functions, inhibition of CtBP expression in cancer cells can result in apoptosis [16]; reviewed
in [17].
Humans possess two CtBP gene loci, CTBP1 and CTBP2.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 proteins share 78% amino acid identity
and 83% similarity [18]. Alternate promoter usage and
gene splicing from the CTBP2 locus generates RIBEYE, a
retina-specific CtBP2 variant [19]. The CTBP1 locus also
similarly encodes a CtBP1 variant with an alternate N-terminus, variously described as CtBP3, BARS or CtBP1-S
[20]. The primary protein products, CtBP1 and CtBP2,
both contain a conserved N-terminal domain involved in
the binding of transcription factors possessing a consensus PxDLS peptide motif, and a central dehydrogenase
homology domain that has a number of functions,
including dimerisation. CtBP1 and CtBP2 appear to function interchangeably, at least in terms of their role as transcriptional co-repressors, but evidence is emerging that
they are subject to differential transcriptional and posttranslational regulation (reviewed in [21]).
Control of subcellular localisation is emerging as an
important mechanism whereby CtBP1 function is regulated. For example, phosphorylation of CtBP1 at Ser158
by p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) results in cytoplasmic
localisation and inhibition of its corepressor activity
under certain growth conditions [22]. Certain PxDLS-containing transcriptional repressors are able to recruit CtBP1
to the nucleus, such as Ets family member NET [23] and
the tumour suppressor protein HIC1 [24]. CtBP1 is modified by sumoylation at K428, which, in conjunction with
protein-protein interactions involving its C-terminal PDZbinding domain [25,26], regulates its nuclear localisation
[26]. CtBP2 lacks both this sumoylation site and the PDZbinding domain, indicating that its subcellular localisation is likely to be regulated in a different manner to
CtBP1. We therefore examined the primary sequence of
CtBP2 to look for alternative sequence motifs that could
be involved in the regulation of its localisation. This analysis identified a putative, evolutionarily conserved nuclear
localisation signal (NLS), which has recently been shown
to be functional in promoting the nuclear accumulation
of CtBP2, [27,28] though it has been shown to function in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/35

nuclear retention, rather than nuclear import [27]. In this
present study, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of
the role played by this N-terminal sequence of CtBP2 in
regulating CtBP protein localisation.

Results
Structure and phylogenetics of CTBP loci
The CtBP2 protein sequence was subjected to an in silico
search for potential nuclear localisation signals [29] and a
potential NLS (KxKRQR) was identified at amino acids
(a.a.) 8–13. Because this sequence is located within the
non-conserved N-terminus of CtBP2, and because of the
differential promoter usage and alternative splicing of the
variant CtBP proteins, we first clarified the genomic structures of the 5' regions of the CTBP1 and CTBP2 loci (Fig.
1a). Fig. 1b shows the N-terminus of human CtBP2 and its
homology to other known CtBP proteins. The putative
NLS in human CtBP2 is conserved completely in mouse
and zebrafish CtBP2, and contains a single amino acid

substitution in quail CtBP2. CtBP1, as well as the single
CtBP in Drosophila and Xenopus, do not contain this
sequence, though Drosophila CtBP does contain a short
lysine-arginine rich sequence (KRSR) that is not present in
CtBP1 proteins. It is also interesting to note that a.a. 1–20
in CtBP2, including the putative NLS, is encoded by a
short exon 1 that is located more than 30 kb upstream of
the rest of the gene.
Amino acids 4–14 of CtBP2 promote its localisation to the
nucleus
In order to establish whether the unique N-terminal
region of CtBP2 is important in determining CtBP2 subcellular distribution, we expressed various CtBP2-EGFP
fusion proteins in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2). 48 hours after
transfection, cells were fixed and counterstained with
DAPI, and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. Control,

EGFP alone localised to the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.
2a). Both full-length CtBP2-EGFP (Fig. 2b) and a truncated version containing a.a. 8–13 and the N-terminal
PxDLS-binding domain, CtBP2(1–119)-EGFP (Fig. 2c),
were detectable exclusively in the nucleus. Deletion of
eleven amino acids encompassing a.a. 8–13 in full length
CtBP2 (CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14-EGFP) resulted in a partial
redistribution of the protein to the cytoplasm, although it
was still predominantly nuclear (Fig. 2d). The Δ4–14
mutation was also made in the context of CtBP2(1–119)EGFP (Fig. 2e), and resulted in a more pronounced redistribution to the cytoplasm compared to its effect on the
full length protein, though again EGFP fluorescence was
still detectable in the nucleus. Substitution of a.a. 4–14
with a bona fide NLS from SV40 large tumour antigen at
the N-terminus of the truncated CtBP2 mutant (CtBP2(1–
119)NLS-EGFP) also resulted in exclusive nuclear locali-

sation (Fig. 2f). Thus, residues 4–14 of CtBP2 are important for maintaining its nuclear localisation, although
other regions within CtBP2 protein are clearly also
involved.
To ensure that the above results were not affected by the
presence of a large EGFP tag, we cloned various CtBP constructs into a vector containing a smaller myc-his tag
(mh). Expressed proteins were detected using a 6xHis-specific primary antibody. A nuclear localisation in HEK 293
cells was confirmed for exogenous full-length CtBP2(1–
445)mh (Fig. 3b). The deletion mutant (CtBP2(1–
445)Δ4–14mh) showed a similar nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation to its corresponding EGFP fusion protein
(Fig. 3c). We also cloned full length CtBP1 into this
expression vector, in order to compare results with that of
CtBP2, and with other studies. Consistent with previous
studies on other cell lines, exogenous CtBP1(1–440)mh

localises primarily to the nucleus, with some cytoplasmic
staining (Fig. 3a).
Cell type-specific differences have been observed in the
degree of nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation of overexpressed CtBP1 [23,26,30]. We wanted to investigate the
behaviour of CtBP2 following over-expression in different
cell lines, and specifically whether it would still be localised to the nucleus in cells in which CtBP1 is cytoplasmic.
As expected [26], CtBP1(1–440)mh is distributed in the
both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cells, with staining being strongest in the nucleus (Fig. 4a). Similar to a
previous report [23], we found that CtBP1(1–440)mh
localises predominantly to the cytoplasm in over 60% of
Cos-7 cells, with some cells showing a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 4d). CtBP1(1–440)mh is
nuclear and cytoplasmic in MCF-7 cells, similar to HeLa
cells (Fig. 4g). CtBP2(1–445)mh localises exclusively to
the nucleus of all three cell lines (Figs. 4b,e,h). In the
absence of a.a. 4–14, CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14mh remains
primarily nuclear in all three cell lines, though with a clear
increase in cytoplasmic staining similar to our findings in
HEK 293 cells, (Figs. 4c,f,i). These experiments, particularly those with Cos-7 cells, confirm that the presence of
a.a. 4–14 in CtBP2 confers upon it an almost exclusively
nuclear distribution. This is in contrast to CtBP1, which
shows cell type-dependent variations in its localisation.
Binding of PxDLS-containing proteins is not required for
the a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation of CtBP2
Our experiments show that even when a.a. 4–14 are
absent, a large proportion of the CtBP2 still localises to
the nucleus. As a previous study has shown that binding
of a PxDLS-containing protein to CtBP1 promotes its
nuclear localisation [25], we decided to investigate
whether such an interaction may also drive the nuclear
localisation of CtBP2. We introduced a point mutation
(V72R) into the PxDLS-binding motif of the CtBP2(1–
445)mh constructs to generate CtBP2(1–445)V72Rmh
and CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14V72Rmh. This mutation renders
CtBPs defective in their interaction with PxDLS-containing proteins [31]. Full-length CtBP2(1–445)mh with the
V72R mutation localises to the nucleus in both Cos-7 and
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5a,c). CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14V72Rmh
localises to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5b,d),
with no further increase in cytoplasmic distribution compared to the CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14mh protein (compare
Figs. 5b,d with Figs. 4f,i). We therefore conclude that the
a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation of CtBP2 in
these cells also occurs independently of its PxDLS binding
ability.
CtBP2 influences CtBP1 subcellular localisation
We, and others, have shown that the unique N-terminal
region of CtBP2 is a major factor driving its accumulation

nisms determining its subcellular distribution remain an
important question for understanding the regulation of its
function. To this end, we asked whether heterodimerisation with CtBP2 might be able to recruit CtBP1 to the
nucleus. To examine this, we analysed the effects of coexpressing both mhCtBP1 and various CtBP2-EGFP constructs in Cos-7 cells. CtBP1(1–440)mh, when transfected
individually (Fig. 4d) or with EGFP-N1 control (Fig. 6a),
is predominantly cytoplasmic. Co-expression of
CtBP1(1–440)mh with CtBP2(1–445)-EGFP results in a
striking relocalisation of CtBP1(1–440)mh to the nucleus
in a high proportion of the cells (Fig. 6b). Quantification
of this by counting stained cells showed over-expressed
CtBP1(1–440)mh to be primarily cytoplasmic in 75% of
the cells, with a mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic localisation in
25%. When co-transfected with CtBP2(1–445)-EGFP, this
changes to 45% nuclear/cytoplasmic and 55% primarily
nuclear. This effect is dependent on CtBP2 being correctly
localised to the nucleus, as demonstrated by the effects of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/35

co-expressing CtBP1(1–440)mh and CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–
14-EGFP (Fig. 6c). Finally, we demonstrate that the
recruitment of CtBP1 to the nucleus by CtBP2 requires a.a.
120–445 of CtBP2, as co-expression of EGFP-CtBP2(1–
119) does not alter the localisation of CtBP1(1–440)mh
(Fig. 6d), and the two proteins fail to co-localise. As a.a.
120–445 contain the dimerisation domain, this finding is
consistent with heterodimerisation with CtBP2 being a
mechanism whereby CtBP1 can be recruited to the
nucleus.

Discussion
We show firstly that the deletion of eleven amino acids
(Δ4–14) encompassing the putative NLS sequence
KVKRQR at a.a. 8–13 of CtBP2 results in shift in the localisation of detectable CtBP2 from exclusively nuclear, to
nuclear and partly cytoplasmic. This effect was observed
in a number of cell lines of diverse origin. These initial
findings confirm a recently published study which identi-

fied a role for a.a. 1–21 in the nuclear localisation and
retention of CtBP2 [27], as well as another study which
was published whilst this manuscript was being submitted [28]. Our data further localises the critical sequence
elements to a.a. 4–14. One of the cell lines, Cos-7, was
chosen because a previous study had shown that transfected CtBP1 primarily localises to the cytoplasm in these
cells, making them a useful experimental model [23].
Amino acids 4–14 also direct nuclear accumulation of
CtBP2 in Cos-7 cells. Therefore, whatever the mechanism
that underlies the cytoplasmic localisation of CtBP1
expressed in Cos-7 cells, it does not affect the ability of a.a.
4–14 to localise CtBP2 to the nucleus. As a primary function of CtBP proteins is as nuclear transcriptional corepressors, this sequence in CtBP2 is likely to play a key
role in maintaining nuclear CtBP activity in cells where
CtBP2 is expressed.
Before considering the role of a.a. 4–14 further, it is
important to note that we, as well as Zhao et al [27] who
examined the effects of an a.a. 1–21 deletion, observed
that CtBP2 with these N-terminal sequences deleted still
retained a predominantly nuclear localisation, with only
a partial redistribution to the cytoplasm. Interestingly,
Verger et al [28] found than a CtBP2Δ1–25 mutant localised almost exclusively in the cytoplasm in Cos-1 cells.
This different result could be due to the slightly larger
deletion that they used, the cell type, or experimental differences. However, our experiments clearly show that
domains other than a.a. 4–14 can be important in defining the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of CtBP2. These
could potentially become important under conditions
whereby the N-terminal sequences of CtBP2 might be
masked, such as following binding of another protein or
through post-translational modification. As the localisation of CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14mh in all four cell lines
closely resembled that of transfected CtBP1 in HEK 293,
HeLa and MCF-7 cells it is possible this a.a. 4–14-independent nuclear localisation occurs through the same
mechanisms that regulate CtBP1. In studies on Cos-7
cells, Criqui-Philipe et al [23] showed that CtBP1 could be
recruited to the nucleus through an association with
PxDLS containing transcription factors. Structural studies
on rat CtBP1-S (BARS) have characterised the PxDLSbinding interface, and identified mutations (e.g. V55R)
that disrupt CtBP-binding to the C-terminal domain of
E1A. We therefore examined the effects of generating the
CtBP2 equivalent of the CtBP1-SV55R mutation. Our
finding that this V72R mutation of CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–
14mh does not affect its subcellular localisation excludes
the PxDLS-binding interface as the major determinant for
the a.a. 4–14-independent localisation of CtBP2 to the
nucleus in these experiments. The N-terminal 119 a.a of
CtBP2 is able to engage in other protein-protein interactions through less well-defined interfaces, e.g. [12], and a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/35

role for these interactions in CtBP2 subcellular distribution cannot yet be excluded.
Our experiments showed that CtBP2(1–119)Δ4–14mh
has a markedly more cytoplasmic distribution than
CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14mh. This identifies a.a. 120–445 as
having a role in nuclear localisation. When compared to
domains in this region of CtBP1 with a known role in subcellular localisation, CtBP2 lacks the PDZ binding motif
present at the extreme C-terminus of CtBP1 [25], as well
as the equivalent of the sumoylation site at K428 [32].
Sequences that are conserved which are good candidates
for a role in CtBP2 nuclear localisation are the Pak1 phosphorylation site at Ser 164, given that the phosphorylation status of the corresponding site in CtBP1 (Ser158)
regulates its subcellular localisation [22], and possibly the
dimerisation domain. In the intact CtBP2 protein, the N-,
C- and core domains do not function independently [31].
It is quite possible that whilst a.a. 120–445 are necessary
for optimal nuclear localisation, a functional interaction
between this region of the molecule and other sequences
within a.a. 1–119 is required for a.a. 4–14-independent
nuclear accumulation.
The experimental data obtained from our analysis of truncations and mutants of CtBP2 also provides additional
insight into the mechanism of regulation of subcellular
localisation by a.a. 4–14 containing the putative CtBP2
NLS. Zhao et al [27] demonstrated that this region does
not, in fact, function as a classical NLS, but rather that it is
necessary for lysines within it, primarily lysine 10, to be
acetylated for it to direct localisation in the nucleus. Specifically they showed that lysines in this sequence are
acetylated in vivo and that this is likely to be through the
actions of the p300 acetyltransferase, a known CtBP binding protein. Their experiments using a non-acetylatable
K10R mutant of CtBP2 showed that this acetylation is
required for retention of CtBP2 in the nucleus, and that
this mutant actually enhances CtBP2 nuclear export. Analogous to our experiments with the V72R mutant, they also
showed that a different mutant in the PxDLS binding
domain (A58E) does not affect acetylation by p300, and
therefore p300 must bind to different sequences on CtBP2
than other PxDLS transcription factors. In contrast, Verger
et al [28] concluded that this N-terminal lysine-arginine
rich region functions as a classical nuclear localisation signal, with a role in nuclear import, rather than retention.
The experiments that we have performed do not distinguish between these two alternative mechanisms. Our
finding that a.a 1–119 of CtBP2 is sufficient to drive efficient nuclear accumulation of EGFP provides an important advance in our understanding of the regions that
regulate the subcellular distribution of CtBP2. However,
the data are consistent with a role of a.a. 4–14 in either

nuclear retention or import. Both previous studies demonstrated that the N terminal 25 amino acids cannot,
alone, target a heterologous protein to the nucleus. This
could be either due to an NLS or nuclear retention signal
not being correctly presented to their target binding proteins in the context of these molecules, or the requirement
for docking of acetyltransferases to a separate part of the
molecule in order to achieve activation of the nuclear
retention signal by acetylation. In CtBP2(1–119)-EGFP
either the sequences may simply be sufficiently spaced
from the EGFP for a.a. 4–14 to be correctly presented as an
NLS, or this region may include the p300 binding site,
allowing activation of the nuclear retention signal by
acetylation. CtBP2(1–119)-EGFP is small enough to enter
the nucleus by passive diffusion, and therefore the presence of a nuclear retention signal would be sufficient for
nuclear accumulation. Expression of a.a. 1–119 in the
context of a fusion with 2XEGFP would generate a larger
protein that could only accumulate in the nucleus if it
were actively imported through nuclear pores. However
further experimentation would be required to determine
conclusively whether this was due to a.a. 4–14 functioning as an NLS, or interaction of a.a. 1–119 with other
actively imported proteins such as PxDLS containing transcription factors [23], HDM2 [12], or possibly p300
acetyltransferase [33].
Finally, we have identified heterodimerisation with CtBP2
as a novel mechanism that can promote the nuclear localisation of CtBP1. This interplay between the two proteins
has also, very recently, been demonstrated by other investigators [28]. It will be interesting to determine the extent
to which this heterodimerisation contributes to CtBP1
subcellular distribution in different cell types, compared
with the other mechanisms that have been described previously. It is important to note that CtBP2 expression is
clearly not an absolute requirement for nuclear CtBP1
activity in many cell types [34]. The contrasting subcellular localisations of over-expressed CtBP1 and CtBP2 in
Cos-7 cells add weight to the growing argument that the
two proteins are regulated differently. Indeed, studies on
the role of CtBP1 and CtBP2 during murine development
revealed a more severe and lethal phenotype in Ctbp2-/mice compared to Ctbp1-/- mice [35]. This has been attributed to temporal and spatial differences in the expression
of Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 during development [35]. Alternatively, it could be explained by the different modes of regulation of protein localisation and function between these
two proteins, implying that perturbation of the constitutive nuclear function of CtBPs is responsible for the
embryonic lethality of Ctbp2-/- animals. CtBP2 with an Nterminal motif that promotes its nuclear localisation is
present in mice, man and fish. It is not yet known whether
the smaller KRSR sequence in Drosophila CtBP is functional, and Xenopus CtBP does not contain any such motif

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/35

in its N-terminus. Therefore, CtBP in Xenopus, and possibly Drosophila, will likely be dependent upon other protein-protein interactions for its recruitment to the nucleus.
It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that this is an indicator of an increased importance of the nuclear activities of
CtBP proteins in the regulation of the complex patterns of
gene expression in higher organisms.

Conclusion
CtBP1 and CtBP2 show a high degree of similarity at the
sequence and functional level. Differential control of their
subcellular localisation is likely to provide mechanisms to
regulate critical nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of
CtBPs in the cells of higher organisms. Here we have identified distinct regions in CtBP2 that play a key role in regulating the subcellular distribution of both CtBP2 and
CtBP1 proteins.

Methods
Expression constructs
pcDNA3.1CtBP2(1–445)mh is previously described [12].
CtBP2(1–445)-EGFP was generated by ligation of a NheI/
KpnI digested insert of pcDNA3.1CtBP2(1–445)mh, into
NheI/KpnI-digested pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), followed by
site directed mutagenesis (SDM; QuikChange, Stratagene), to place the EGFP in frame (forward primer 5'CCCAACGAGCAGGTACCGCG-3').
Full-length
pcDNA3.1CtBP1(1–440)mh was constructed by PCR
amplification of CTBP1 cDNA, using the following primers: forward 5'-GCCGGAATTCATGGGCAGCTCGCACTTGCTC-3';
reverse
5'GCGCCAAGCTTCAACTGGTCACTGGCGTGGTC-3', and
ligation into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(-)/MycHisA (Invitrogen). CtBP2(1–119)-EGFP was generated by
NheI/SacI digestion of pcDNA3.1CtBP2(1–445)mh and
ligation into pEGFP-N1. Deletion mutants lacking residues 4–14 (CtBP2(1–445)Δ4–14 and CtBP2(1–119)Δ4–
14) were generated by SDM in both pEGFP-N1 and
pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-HisA backgrounds (forward primer: 5'TCCATGGCCCTTGGTCTCGACAGAATTTGT-3'), which
replaced a.a. 4–14 with gly-leu (a BsaI restriction site).
CtBP2(1–119)NLS-EGFP was generated by replacing residues 4–14 with an SV40 large tumour antigen NLS
(PKKKRV)
(forward
SDM
primer:
5'TCCATGGCCCTTCCGAAGAAGAAGCGGGTGGAGCTCGACAGAATTTGT-3'). PxDLS-binding mutants were constructed
by
SDM
(forward
primer:
5'GGAAATCCACGAGAAGCGTCTAAACGAAGCCGT-3').
All clones were confirmed by sequence analysis.
Cell culture and transfection
All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% foetal
bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear) and penicillin (100 U/
ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and L-glutamine (292 μg/

ml) (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at the required density
on glass coverslips 24 h prior to transfection. Effectene
transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used to transfect 0.2 μg
(0.4 μg for dual localisations) DNA into cells, as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48
h, and fixed for fluorescence microscopy.
Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, and permeabilised using
0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min. They were blocked for
30 min in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS, and
incubated as required with primary antibody (Anti-6xHis
antibody, Abcam) for 1 h in 0.6% BSA/PBS, followed by
Alexa594-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes). Cells were counterstained with 1 μg/
ml DAPI during the secondary antibody incubation.
When EGFP-fusion proteins only were visualised, all antibody incubation steps were omitted, and fixed and permeabilised cells were incubated with DAPI in 3% BSA/
PBS for 10 min. Coverslips were mounted on slides with
fluorescent mounting media (DakoCytomation). Cells
were visualised using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent
microscope and images were collected using an Orca-ER
digital camera (Hamamatsu), and processed using Openlab 3.5.1 Software (Improvision).
