Abstract
Background: Nitrogen, a component of many bio-molecules, is essential for growth and
development of all organisms. Most nitrogen exists in the atmosphere, and utilisation of this source
is important as a means of avoiding nitrogen starvation. However, the ability to fix atmospheric
nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme complex is restricted to some bacteria. Eukaryotic organisms
are only able to obtain fixed nitrogen through their symbiotic interactions with nitrogen-fixing
prokaryotes. These symbioses involve a variety of host organisms, including animals, plants, fungi
and protists.
Results: We have compared the morphological, physiological and molecular characteristics of
nitrogen fixing symbiotic associations of bacteria and their diverse hosts. Special features of the
interaction, e.g. vertical transmission of symbionts, grade of dependency of partners and
physiological modifications have been considered in terms of extent of co-evolution and adaptation.
Our findings are that, despite many adaptations enabling a beneficial partnership, most symbioses
for molecular nitrogen fixation involve facultative interactions. However, some interactions, among
them endosymbioses between cyanobacteria and diatoms, show characteristics that reveal a more
obligate status of co-evolution.
Conclusion: Our review emphasises that molecular nitrogen fixation, a driving force for
interactions and co-evolution of different species, is a widespread phenomenon involving many
different organisms and ecosystems. The diverse grades of symbioses, ranging from loose
associations to highly specific intracellular interactions, might themselves reflect the range of
potential evolutionary fates for symbiotic partnerships. These include the extreme evolutionary
modifications and adaptations that have accompanied the formation of organelles in eukaryotic
cells: plastids and mitochondria. However, age and extensive adaptation of plastids and
mitochondria complicate the investigation of processes involved in the transition of symbionts to
organelles. Extant lineages of symbiotic associations for nitrogen fixation show diverse grades of
adaptation and co-evolution, thereby representing different stages of symbiont-host interaction. In
particular cyanobacterial associations with protists, like the Rhopalodia gibba-spheroid body
symbiosis, could serve as important model systems for the investigation of the complex
mechanisms underlying organelle evolution.

Background
Historically, the phenomenon of symbiosis has been
defined as a close and prolonged interaction between two
different species [1]. This includes parasitic, mutualistic
and commensalistic interactions. However, more modern
interpretations use the term "symbiosis" for interactions,
which are more or less beneficial for both partners. Here,
we use the term "mutualistic symbiosis" or "mutualism"
for symbiotic interactions where a mutual benefit is confirmed. For interactions in general and where the exact
nature of interaction is unknown or is not easily defined,
we use the general term of "symbiosis".
It is generally thought that all eukaryotic organisms are
descendents of progenitors in which at least two partners
have interacted symbiotically. Mitochondria have originated from an α-proteobacterial ancestor, which was dramatically reduced during evolution [2,3]. Plastids, the
typical organelles of photoautotrophic eukaryotes, are
thought to have been derived from the merger of a cyanobacterial-like progenitor and a phagotrophic eukaryote
[4]. The driving force for the close interactions that have
led to organelle formation appear to be the metabolic
needs of at least one of the participants in the interaction.
In the case of mitochondria, ATP synthesis carried out by
the α-proteobacterial symbiont has been the principal
driving force for the co-evolution of both partners. In the
case of plastids, the need for photosynthetic products has
presumably driven symbiosis. Both metabolic capacities
are exclusively prokaryotic inventions and only symbiotic
interaction has allowed them to be used by eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic invention and eukaryotic utilisation through
symbiosis also applies to molecular nitrogen fixation.
Nitrogen is an essential compound of many molecules,
including proteins, nucleic acids and vitamins. Associations of eukaryotic host organisms with nitrogen-fixing
bacteria occur in many environments and have thus
increased the bioavailability of nitrogen. These associations are numerous and diverse, ranging from loose interactions to highly regulated intracellular symbioses.
Here we compare the morphological, physiological and
molecular characteristics of symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria and their host organisms (animals, fungi, plants and
protists). We classify the evolutionary state of some of
these interactions, and discuss the potential of these for
becoming model systems for investigating the molecular
basis of the transition from endosymbiont to organelle
[5,6].
Molecular nitrogen fixation and nitrogenase
Most animals and fungi use nutrition to heterotrophically
acquire nitrogen bound in biomolecules. However, other
organisms including plants and many bacteria use inorganic nitrogen compounds like ammonium or nitrate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/55

bound to soil or present in water. The fixation of molecular nitrogen into bioavailable compounds for cellular
anabolism is a process restricted to some bacteria. Such
bacteria are termed diazotrophs, as they obtain all their
nitrogen by fixing molecular nitrogen.
During biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) molecular
nitrogen is reduced (Figure 1A) in multiple electron transfer reactions, resulting in the synthesis of ammonia and
the release of hydrogen [7]. Ammonium is then used for
the subsequent synthesis of biomolecules. This reduction
of molecular nitrogen to ammonium is catalyzed in all
nitrogen-fixing organisms via the nitrogenase enzyme
complex in an ATP-dependent, highly energy consuming
reaction (Figure 1B). The nitrogenase complex is comprised of two main functional subunits, dinitrogenase
reductase (azoferredoxin) and dinitrogenase (molybdoferredoxin) [8]. The structural components of these subunits are the Nif (nitrogen fixation) proteins NifH (γ2
homodimeric azoferredoxin) and NifD/K (α2β2 heterotetrameric molybdoferredoxin). Basically three types of
nitrogenases are known based on the composition of their
metal centres: iron and molybdenum (Fe/Mo), iron and
vanadium (Fe/V) or iron only (Fe) [9]. The most common
form is the Fe/Mo-type found in cyanobacteria and rhizobia. An important feature of the nitrogenase enzyme complex is its extreme sensitivity to even minor concentrations
of oxygen. In aerobic environments and in photoautotrophic cyanobacteria, where oxygen is produced in the
light reactions of photosynthesis [10], nitrogenase activity
must be protected. This protection is realised by different
mechanisms in nitrogen fixing bacteria, depending on
their cellular and physiologic constitutions. Aerobic bacteria like Azotobacter limit high intracellular oxygen concentrations by high rates of respiratory metabolism in
combination with extracellular polysaccharides to reduce
oxygen influx [11,12]. In some filamentous cyanobacteria, BNF is restricted to specialised cells, the heterocysts,
which are separated from other cells, and show reduced
photosynthetic activity without oxygen production
[13,14]. Unicellular cyanobacteria combine photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation within the same cell and
show a temporary separation of these two pathways where
BNF is restricted to the dark period, when the oxygen-levels are low [15]. In addition to these protections, the concentration of oxygen can be decreased by biochemical
pathways like the Mehler-reaction or by special oxygenscavenging molecules such as cyanoglobin and leghemoglobin, the latter playing a major role in rhizobia-plant
interactions [16,17].
Diversity and specificity of symbioses between nitrogen
fixing bacteria and eukaryotes
The ability to fix molecular nitrogen is a widespread characteristic of prokaryotic cells, being established among

intracellularly within host cells. Among these associations
an interaction is considered as obligate for one partner if
it is not able to survive outside the symbiotic association.
In the case of symbiotic bacteria, an obligate status is often
accompanied by deleterious genome evolution, e.g. the
loss of genes whose products are no longer required for
the new host-dependent lifestyle [22,23] whereas nonobligate (facultative) symbionts retain their autonomy
and are indistinguishable from their free-living forms
with respect to gene content. Numerous manifestations of
symbiotic interactions between nitrogen-fixing bacteria
and their hosts are known and they reflect considerable
diversity and complexity. The following sections provide
an overview of main types of associations and their characteristics.

various groups of bacteria including some archaea
[18,19]. The distribution of BNF among archaea and
eubacteria indicates that nitrogen fixation is an ancient
innovation [15,20,21], which developed early in the evolution of microbial life on earth. Within the eubacteria,
nitrogen fixation has been described for members of the
proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, spirochaetes, clostridiales, purple-sulfur (Chromatiales) and greensulfur (Chlorobiales) bacteria (Figure 2). However, only
some of these diazotrophic bacteria are known to interact
with eukaryotes symbiotically (Figure 2, Table 1).
A diversity of eukaryotic partner organisms (animals,
fungi, plants and protists) from different environments is
involved in symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria (Table
1). The kind of these nitrogen fixing symbioses range from
rather loose, temporary and non-specific contacts to stable and permanent interactions, the latter ones often characterised by morphological and/or physiological
modifications of one or both partners and also the vertical
transmission of symbionts to the next host generation.
Symbionts can reside either extracellularly in more or less
close association to their hosts or exist as endosymbionts

Symbioses of nitrogen fixing bacteria with sponges, corals
and insects (invertebrates)
Marine sponges (Porifera) are evolutionary primordial
invertebrates, which can harbour a variety of extra- and
intracellular bacteria or bacterial communities [24-26].
However, the symbiotic character of these associations is
well defined only in a few cases [27]. Symbioses with
sponges have been described for many different groups of
cyanobacteria [28], where the symbionts seem to provide
their hosts with organic carbon, nitrogen or secondary
metabolites [27,29]. This might also be the case for the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria spongeliae, which is
found to be host-specific in Dysidea spp. [30]. Cyanobacterial symbionts of Chondrilla australiensis are thought to
be vertically transmitted [31,32], but an obligate status for
these interactions has yet to be tested rigorously.

Corals in general are partners of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), which provide photosynthetically
derived carbon to their animal hosts [33], but nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria is also a well-known feature of
coral reefs and coral communities [34-36]. The metazoan
coral Montastraea cavernosa is an example of a host harbouring symbiotic cyanobacteria [37]. In the Montastraea
endosymbiosis, two symbiotic organisms, the zooxanthellae and cyanobacteria, share the same host compartment. Here, the nitrogen fixation by the cyanobacteria
might be facilitated by the host providing energy rich
compounds. If so, this would indicate a high degree of
specificity association between all three partners [31].
Also higher invertebrates benefit from the metabolic
capacities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The hindgut of
wood-feeding termites is colonised by flagellate protozoa
[38,39], which facilitate digestion of lignocellulose [40].
The carbon-rich but nitrogen-poor nature of the termite
diet requires nitrogen from other sources [41]. This is
thought to be provided by intracellular bacteria associated

with termite gut flagellates, such as Trichonympha agilis in
Reticulitermes santonensi [42]. These are examples of permanent endosymbionts placed phylogenetically in a new
phylum endomicrobia [42]. Interestingly, although the
endomicrobia are symbionts of the flagellate protists
rather than the termites, they might best be considered as
animal endosymbiotic associations. More recently, freeliving spirochetes of the termite hindgut have also been
revealed to fix molecular nitrogen and provide their host
with nitrogen metabolites [43]. A further interaction has
also been identified in Tetraponera ants, which harbour a
subset of different bacteria in a special organ ("bacterial
pouch"), among them relatives of Rhizobium, Pseudomonas
and Burkholderia [44]. However, although these symbionts are related to nitrogen fixing and/or root-nodule
associated bacteria, it is only speculated that the insect
host benefits from fixation of molecular nitrogen. More
likely, nitrogenous waste secreted by the host is metabo-

lised and recycled by the bacteria. This is also indicated by
the high amount of Malphigian tubules in the pouch,
which transport nitrogenous waste. Nevertheless, nitrogen fixing activity of the symbiotic bacteria of Tetraponera
cannot be excluded as a possibility. The diverse symbiotic
interactions between nitrogen fixing bacteria and insects
described so far share some common characteristics.
These symbionts often inhabit specialised organs or
regions of the host. This localisation in turn provides an
optimal environment for their activity, without symbionts
needing to reside inside host cells. This is in contrast to
other well-known bacterial interactions with insects, like
the Buchnera symbiosis [45]. Here, the symbionts reside
within specialised host cells and show a remarkable
degree of adaptation leading to an obligate and permanent level of interaction. One prerequisite for such co-evolution of both partners is stable vertical transmission of

Overview of nitrogen fixing bacteria, including selected symbiotic interactions, possible host organisms and symbiont localisation. Details of the individual symbiotic
associations are described in the text. n.d.: not detected

symbionts which usually takes place maternally, via infection of eggs or larvae [45,46]. In contrast to endosymbionts, stable integration and transmission of gut and cavity
symbionts seems to be challenging as they are more vulnerable for replacement by other mircobes. Ants and termites are colony organised insects and transmission of
extracellular symbionts could take place horizontally via
close contact of different individuals or via feeding of larvae by infected workers. However, reproduction of social
insects is accomplished only by few individuals, thus vertical transmission from queens to the offspring is necessary for the foundation of new colonies. Phylogenetic
analyses of the gut microbiota of termites indicate symbiont-host coevolution based on vertical transmission in
combination with frequent horizontal exchange between
congeneric species [47,48]. Consequently, the special
social lifestyle of termites and ants might be one prerequisite for the establishment of stable vertical transmission
and cospeciation of extracellular symbionts in these lineages.

Symbioses of nitrogen fixing bacteria with fungi:
cyanolichens and symbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi
In lichen symbioses, a fungal partner (mycobiont) is associated with an extracellular photobiont. The latter are
mostly different photosynthetic algae, but cyanobacteria
also occur as photobionts in lichens, either alone (bipartite symbiosis) or in combination with algae (tripartite
symbiosis) [49]. The benefit to the photobiontic partner is
not fully understood, but it might include the provision of
water, minerals, protection from predators and UV damage [50]. The advantage for the fungal partner is the provision of photosynthesis-derived carbon metabolites from
the photobiont. Cyanobacteria (cyanobionts) provide, in
addition to carbon, fixed nitrogen to their hosts. The
importance of molecular nitrogen fixation is reflected in
the physiological and morphological adaptations of
lichen-associated cyanobacteria. These include an
increased number of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts in symbiotic Nostoc sp. compared to free-living filaments. A further

adaptation is found in tripartite symbioses where the
cyanobacteria are concentrated in special areas called
cephalodias, where they fix nitrogen and are protected
from high oxygen concentrations. In these tripartite symbioses, photosynthesis is restricted to the algal photobionts, and these supply the other partners with fixed
carbon compounds [51]. The fact that most cyanobionts
are not vertically transmitted and are also found as freeliving organisms indicates that they are not obligate symbionts, and thus not dependent on host metabolism. Nevertheless, the morphological characters of lichens suggest
a high degree of coevolutionary adaptation of all participants. Although commonly considered a mutualistic
interaction, some hypotheses propose that lichen symbioses are a form of parasitism [50]. Even so, the ecological
and evolutionary success of lichens suggests mutual benefit is characteristic for the association.
The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis between
fungi and plant roots is the most common of this type of
interaction in the rizosphere [52]. The fungus supplies the
plant with water and nutrients such as phosphate, while
the plant provides the fungus with photosynthetically
produced carbohydrates. The AM fungus Gigaspora margarita harbours intracellular bacteria from the genus Burkholderia [53,54], which supply the fungus with fixed
nitrogen. However, the extent of physiological adaptation
or reduction of these endosymbionts leading to an obligate status of interaction has yet to be determined.
A further symbiosis, discovered in the Spessart-mountains
(Germany), was identified by analysing the fungus Geosiphon pyriformis, related to AM fungi [55]. At the hyphal
tips of this fungus, unicellular multinucleated "bladders"
develop, which harbour Nostoc punctiforme. It has been
shown that these bladders fix CO2, which may be the
major contribution of the cyanobacterium to the symbiosis. The symbiont also forms heterocysts, suggesting that
nitrogen is fixed as well [56]. However, as these heterocysts are somewhat similar to those of free-living relatives
of this Nostoc strain, nitrogen fixation may only serve the
needs of the symbiont itself.
Symbioses of nitrogen fixing bacteria with plants
Interactions of bacteria with various groups of plants are
the most common symbiotic association for nitrogen
assimilation. A multiplicity of bacteria with different
physiological backgrounds are involved in these associations, including gram-negative proteobacteria like Rhizobia sp. and Burkholderia sp., gram-positive Frankia sp. [57]
and filamentous or unicellular cyanobacteria [58]. The
physiological and morphological characteristics of these
symbioses range from extracellular communities to highly
adapted interfaces within special organs or compartments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/55

The mutualistic symbioses between various non-photosynthetic proteobacteria of the order Rhizobiales with
plants of the orders Fabales, Fagales, Curcurbitales and
Rosales are the most extensively studied interactions
between bacteria and plants [59]. The rhizobia-legume
symbiosis is characterised by typical root-nodule structures of the plant host, which are colonised by the endosymbiotic rhizobia, so-called bacteroids [60]. The
nodulated plant roots supply the bacteria with energy-rich
carbon compounds and obtain fixed nitrogen by the
bacteroids in return. The nodule formation is a highly regulated and complex process driven by both partners. Freeliving rhizobia enter the plant root epidermis and induce
nodule formation by reprogramming root cortical cells.
Of special importance for the establishment of the symbiosis are flavonoids secreted by the plant partner [61] and
the subsequent induction of bacterial nodulation (nod)
genes [62]. The Nod-factors play a role in the formation of
the nodule, a complex structure optimised for the requirements of both partners [63,64]. Analysis of root epidermal infection and the underlying signal transduction
pathways [65-67] indicate that Nod-factors may have
evolved following recruitment of pathways, which developed in a phylogenetically more ancient arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis [68,69]. In the nodule, bacteroids
reside within parenchym cells, where they are localised in
membrane bound vesicles (Figure 3a) [70]. Nitrogenase
activity is ensured by the spatial separation of the bacteroids inside the nodule structure and special oxygen-scavenging leghemoglobin that is synthesised in the nodules
[71]. An interesting feature of rhizobia is that nitrogen fixation is restricted to symbiotic bacteroids, whereas freeliving bacteria do not express nitrogenase [72]. Although
the rhizobia-legume symbiosis is a highly adapted and
regulated interaction it can not be termed permanent or
obligate. Both partners can live and propagate autonomously, and each host generation has to be populated by
a new strain of free-living rhizobia.
Rhizobia-legume symbioses are not the only root-nodule
forming interactions of bacteria and plants. Actinobacteria of the genus Frankia spp. are known to develop nodules
for nitrogen fixation in various families and orders of
angiosperms known as actinorhizal plants [73]. Free-living Frankia is characterised by a unique morphology,
including three structural forms, hypha, sporangium and
vesicle, the latter one being a compartment for nitrogen
fixation. Although functionally analogous, Frankia nodules differ from those in rhizobia-legume interactions in
development and morphology [74]. In contrast to rhizobia all Frankia strains are also capable of fixing molecular
nitrogen as free-living bacteria [75]. The appearance of the
Frankia-symbiosis as a nodulation dependent interaction
emphasises the adaptation of both partners. Other plants,
including important economic crops like Zea mays and

Oryza sativa have established associations with different
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including Azospirillum [76] and
Azoarcus [77]. However, such symbioses have never been
found to result in nodule formation.

rates of N2 fixation compared to those of free-living cells.
In addition, photosynthesis of symbiotic cyanobacteria is
depressed in various associations to avoid competition
between symbionts and host for CO2 and light [86].

In addition, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria are also often
found interacting with plant partners. For example, symbioses of filamentous heterocyst-forming Nostoc sp. have
been reported for bryophytes, pteridophytes (Azolla),
gymnosperms (cycads) and angiopsperms (Gunnera) [7881]. In all plant hosts, with the exception of Gunnera, symbiotic Nostoc filaments are localised extracellularly in different locations depending on the host species. In
bryophytes, like hornworts, the cyanobacteria are found
within cavities of the gametophyte [79], whereas an Azolla
sp. harbours the bacterial partners in cavities of the dorsal
photosynthetic parts of the leaves [80]. In cycad-cyanobacterial associations the symbionts are limited to specialised coralloid roots where they reside in the cortical
cyanobacterial zone [81]. More specialised is the mutualistic intracellular Gunnera-Nostoc symbiosis. Here the
process begins with invasion of the petiole glands, followed by intracellular establishment within the meristematic cells of this tissue [60,78].

In conclusion, different adaptations are found in cyanobacterial-plant interactions but they are not as specific and
highly regulated as the complex nodule-forming symbioses. A common feature of all bacteria plant symbioses is
their non-obligate, non-permanent character, including a
lack of vertical transmission of symbionts to the next host
generation. An exception might be the Nostoc-Azolla symbiosis, where cyanobacterial homogenia are transmitted
via megaspores [88].

The symbioses of cyanobacteria with their plant partners
differ remarkably from the rhizobia-legume interactions.
First, cyanobacteria show a broad host range and thus differ from rhizobia or Frankia sp., which are limited to legumes or angiosperms, respectively. In addition,
cyanobacteria do not induce the formation of highly specialised structures like root-nodules after colonisation of
the host but reside in plant structures known as symbiotic
cavities [82], which also exist without symbiosis. The lack
of nodule-like organs can be explained by the fact that
heterocyst forming cyanobacteria also fix nitrogen as freeliving cells and therefore do not need a special environment for N2-fixation in symbiosis. This makes them distinct from rhizobia, which only fix nitrogen in the
protective environment of the nodule. Although symbiotic cavities do not display the close and highly regulated
interface of a legume-nodule they are nevertheless regions
that exhibit adaptations for symbiosis. A common specialisation in occupied symbiotic cavities of plant hosts is the
elaboration of elongated cells to improve nutrient
exchange [83] and the production of mucilage-exopolysaccharides for water storage or as nutrient reserve (e.g.
[84,85]). The infection process is controlled via the production of hormogenium-inducing factors by the host
plant, resulting in the development of vegetative cyanobacterial filaments (hormogonia), important for host colonisation [86,87]. The main adaptations to the symbiotic
lifestyle found in the bacterial partners concern changes of
morphology and physiology. These include a remarkable
increase of heterocysts in symbiotic Nostoc, and higher

Symbioses of nitrogen fixing bacteria with protists
Symbioses of bacteria with unicellular eukaryotes are
exceptional as they involve the whole host rather than
specialised parts of the host organism. Also these intracellular symbionts require a high degree of regulation and
adaptation to maintain the mutualistic relationship. This
feature, in conjunction with vertical transmission, suggests that co-evolution and dependence of partners is sufficiently advanced to regard the relationship as unification
of two single organisms. The mitochondria and plastids of
recent eukaryotes are extreme examples of this kind of
association [89,90]. Cyanobacteria have also been
detected in intracellular association with an euglenoid
flagellate [91], heterotrophic dinoflagellates [92-94], a
filose amoeba [95], diatoms [96,97] and, extracellularly,
with some protists, e.g. diatoms [98]. Only rarely has the
nitrogen fixing activity of the prokaryotic partner been
demonstrated in these symbioses (e.g. [99]). In the next
paragraph the range of symbiotic associations between
cyanobacteria and protists is described in a progression of
interactions from temporary to permanent. As such, these
symbioses provide an opportunity to investigate the cellular changes that may accompany the evolutionary transition from extracellular symbiont to intracellular
endosymbiont and cell organelle.

Petalomonas sphagnophila is an apoplastic euglenoid that
harbours endosymbiotic Synechocystis species [91]. The
cyanobacteria occur inside a perialgal vacuole and remain
alive for several weeks, before they are metabolised, so
that they must be regarded as temporary endosymbiotic
cell inclusions. These intracellular cyanobacteria are thus
reminiscent of kleptochloroplasts found in some heterotrophic dinoflagellates, marine snails, foraminifera and
ciliates. These associations can be understood as a mechanism for the temporary separation of ingested and
digested prey [92-94,100]. However, in all well-documented cases of kleptochloroplastic interactions, only the
plastid or the plastid together with surrounding cell compartments (never the whole cell) is incorporated as a klep-

onts. At present this problem is limiting our understanding of the potential benefits of these prokaryote/eukaryote
mergers. Some filamentous cyanobacteria are known to
interact with diatoms. Extracellular epibionts, endosymbionts and also symbionts positioned in the periplasmic
space between the cell wall and cell membrane of the diatom are known to occur [58,98]. Electron microscopy
scanning of such interactions has demonstrated a dual
symbiotic nature of some symbionts. E. g. Richelia intracellularis has been observed to interact either as an epibiont
(with Chaetoceros spec.) or as endosymbiont (with Rhizosolenia clevei) [98]. In these examples, nitrogen fixation for
the benefit of the host has been demonstrated by the cultivation of the symbiont-diatom association in the
absence of an external fixed nitrogen source. Nitrogen fixation is also suggested from morphological features such
as the presence of heterocysts. At least in tropical environments, the production of B12 vitamins may also be a further benefit for the host [101].

tochloroplast by the host. In contrast, the cyanobacteria of
P. sphagmophila are not disintegrated during their internalisation by the euglenoid [91]. Symbiont integrity is therefore likely to be a prerequisite for the functioning of the
cyanobacterial nitrogen fixing machinery. The enslaved
cyanobacteria may also provide energy-rich C-compounds or, as suggested for other symbiotic interactions,
vitamin B12 production to it host [101]. These hypotheses
are yet to be investigated thoroughly.
Phaeosomes are symbionts found in some representatives
of the order Dinophysiales. They exhibit morphological
characteristics of Synechocystsis and Synechococcus cells and
are located either extracellularly or intracellularly [94]. In
the case of intracellular cells, the symbioses seem to be
permanent and the benefit of the symbiosis to the host
may be efficient nitrogen fixation. However, as in the case
of P. sphagnophila, difficulties in cultivating these strains
complicate molecular characterisation of the endosymbi-

The cyanobacterial endosymbionts of the diatom
Rhopalodia gibba
Some diatoms, including Climacodium frauenfeldianum
and Rhopalodia gibba, are known to harbour permanent
endosymbionts [96,97,102]. As indicated by EM investigations of R. gibba, these endosymbionts are intracellular
and are transmitted vertically [102,103]. The endosymbionts, so-called spheroid bodies [96], are localised in the
cytoplasm, and separated by a perialgal vacuole from the
cytosol. Each spheroid body is surrounded by a double
membrane. As additionally internal membranes are also
visible, this morphotype is similar to that of cyanobacteria
(Figure 3b). 16S rDNA sequences have been amplified
from an environmental sample of C. frauenfeldianum [97]
and from isolated spheroid bodies of R. gibba [102]. Phylogenetic analysis groups these sequences together with
free-living cyanobacteria of the genus Cyanothece (Figure
2). This robust grouping is also evidenced from phylogenetic analysis of a nitrogenase subunit gene, isolated from
R. gibbas's spheroid body [102]. In phylogenetic reconstructions of both genes, the branch lengths separating
free-living cyanobacteria and the cell inclusions of C. frauenfeldianum and R. gibba are very short, indicating that origins of the protist symbioses are relatively recent. This is
unlike the situation for plastids and extant cyanobacteria,
which have an ancient phylogenetic relationship. Cyanothece sp., the closest known free-living relatives of spheroid bodies and the endosymbiont of C. frauenfeldianum,
are typical unicellular and diazotrophic cyanobacteria. To
protect the nitrogenase from oxygen tension, Cyanothece
show a strong physiological periodicity, restricting nitrogen-fixation exclusively to the dark period of growth
[104]. During this period, the energy demand for N2 fixation is sustained by large amounts of photosynthetically
derived carbohydrates, which are stored as starch parti-

cles. Nitrogen fixing activity of R. gibba was first indicated
in the 1980s via acetylene reduction assays [99] and confirmed in latter studies [102]. Intracellular localisation of
the enzymatic activity has been undertaken by scanning
for protein subunits of nitrogenase [102]. Immunogold
experiments have shown that the nitrogenase is localised
within the diatom spheroid bodies, thereby confirming
that the endosymbiont is responsible for the fixation of
nitrogen. Furthermore, corresponding genes for the nitrogenase activity have also been isolated from purified spheroid bodies [102]. Interestingly, spheroid body nitrogen
fixation in R. gibba is a strictly light dependent process.
This might be the result of several adaptations to the
endosymbiotic lifestyle. Spheroid bodies lack a characteristic cyanobacterial fluorescence based on photosynthetic
pigments, indicating that they have lost photosynthetic
activity and that energy for nitrogen fixation is supplied by
the host cell. The protection of the nitrogenase enzyme
complex is accomplished through the spatial separation
of the two pathways, with N2 fixation in spheroid bodies
and photosynthesis in the host plastid. The loss of photosynthetic activity of spheroid bodies is also expected to
lead to the loss of autonomy resulting in an obligate
endosymbiosis. This hypothesis is consistent with the
observation that R. gibba cells are never observed without
spheroid bodies and that cultivation of the endosymbionts outside the host cells has not been possible [102].
Definitive evidence is still required to determine the exact
nature of symbiotic interaction and whether the spheroid
body of R. gibba is an obligate endosymbiont, or perhaps
even an unrecognised DNA-containing organelle.

Conclusion
The ability to fix molecular nitrogen is restricted to
selected bacterial species that express the nitrogenase
enzyme complex. Nevertheless, various eukaryotic organisms have utilised this capacity by establishing symbiotic
interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria. In these associations, fixed nitrogen is provided to the hosts, thereby
enabling them to colonise environments where the supply of bound nitrogen is limited. In mutualistic symbioses, bacterial symbionts benefit from these associations,
e.g. by protection against predators or by being provided
with host metabolites. Symbioses for molecular nitrogen
fixation can be found in many different habitats, with
host organisms including all crown groups of eukaryotic
life. Although all partnerships are based on the same enzymatic reaction, the diverse associations differ with respect
to the physiological and morphological features that characterise the interconnection of partners. Such features
include the development of special host organs for optimal performance of bacterial symbionts, adaptations in
host and symbiont metabolism, and the intracellular
establishment of bacteria within the host.

Close associations involving multiple adaptations and coevolution between partners can result in permanent and
obligate relationships, whereby the bacterial symbiont is
stably integrated into the host system, and vertically transmitted across generations. These close interactions are
mainly found in intracellular symbioses, where free-living
bacteria reside within the cells of the host organism. These
are similar to organelles of eukaryotes, such as mitochondria and plastids, which both derived from symbiotic
interactions and where continuous adaptation and coevolution lead to a fusion of two distinct organisms [3,4].
In both cases, the metabolic capacity of the bacterial symbiont was the driving force for maintenance and evolutionary establishment, resulting in an inseparable merger
of host and symbiont. The same basis of interaction
applies for molecular nitrogen fixation, where eukaryotic
hosts benefit from the unique metabolic capacity of special bacteria, leading to various symbiotic interactions
with different specifications. In particular, bacteria interacting with protists, like the spheroid bodies of R. gibba,
might serve in the future as important model systems for
investigating the establishment of molecular nitrogen fixation in eukaryotic hosts. The detailed study of this interaction will thus provide a great opportunity to understand
the complex mechanisms underlying the evolution of
obligate endosymbionts and organelles.
