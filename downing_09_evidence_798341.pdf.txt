Abstract
Background: The comparative analysis of genome sequences emerging for several avian species with the
fully sequenced chicken genome enables the genome-wide investigation of selective processes in
functionally important chicken genes. In particular, because of pathogenic challenges it is expected that
genes involved in the chicken immune system are subject to particularly strong adaptive pressure.
Signatures of selection detected by inter-species comparison may then be investigated at the population
level in global chicken populations to highlight potentially relevant functional polymorphisms.
Results: Comparative evolutionary analysis of chicken (Gallus gallus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)
genes identified interleukin 4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4Rα), a key cytokine receptor as a candidate with a
significant excess of substitutions at nonsynonymous sites, suggestive of adaptive evolution. Resequencing
and detailed population genetic analysis of this gene in diverse village chickens from Asia and Africa,
commercial broilers, and in outgroup species red jungle fowl (JF), grey JF, Ceylon JF, green JF, grey francolin
and bamboo partridge, suggested elevated and balanced diversity across all populations at this gene, acting
to preserve different high-frequency alleles at two nonsynonymous sites.
Conclusion: Haplotype networks indicate that red JF is the primary contributor of diversity at chicken
IL-4Rα: the signature of variation observed here may be due to the effects of domestication, admixture
and introgression, which produce high diversity. However, this gene is a key cytokine-binding receptor in
the immune system, so balancing selection related to the host response to pathogens cannot be excluded.

Background
The chicken represents one of our most important sources
of food protein worldwide but remains a potential threat
to human health as a reservoir for diseases and foodborne pathogens. Emerging diseases such as avian influenza [1] provide a new impetus to investigate chicken
immunity – in particular the relationship between population diversity and disease susceptibility.
The geographic distribution, population densities and disease epidemiology of chickens is likely to have changed
dramatically since their domestication, undoubtedly
shaping their genetic diversity. Novel diseases and
increased incidence of infection would have challenged
the chicken immune response, necessitating adaptive evolution at key immune genes. Evidence for such adaptation
is found in the sequence conservation of immunityrelated genes, the lowest of any functional category [2],
and in several studies reporting the association of allelic
variation at particular immune genes with susceptibility
to infection. For example, different alleles at the chicken
MHC-B locus are known to alter susceptibility to a diverse
array of diseases [3]. Genes such as the chicken Mx gene,
which determines susceptibility to the myxovirus [4],
have been shown to be subject to selection [5,6]. Genes
involved in the immune system therefore represent
appealing candidates for examining the selective processes shaping genetic diversity. Knowledge about the
nature of selection acting on a gene can illuminate their
evolutionary history and can provide insight into the
complex relationship between diseases and genes [7].
New large-scale sequencing projects in several avian species, for instance the zebra finch genome project http://
songbirdgenome.org, now allow the genome-wide comparative analysis of avian genes and the detection of selection on a wider scale. Approximately 20% amino acid
changes between chicken and zebra finch have been fixed
by positive selection [8], so by comparing coding
sequences (CDS) between these birds, chicken genes with
signals suggestive of adaptation can be identified.
In this study, we report that the chicken interleukin receptor 4 alpha chain gene (IL-4Rα) showed a relative excess
of nonsynonymous substitutions and may be subject to
selection. It is associated with disease: for example, its
expression is downregulated by the avian influenza virus
during infection [1]. The human ortholog of this gene
encodes a transmembrane receptor for IL-4 and IL-13,
both of which are key immune system cytokines that initiate signalling pathways in the inflammatory response to
infection [9]. The IL-4Rα gene was resequenced in 70
Asian and African village chickens, 20 commercial broilers, and in 6 closely related species: red, grey, Ceylon and
green jungle fowl (JF), bamboo partridge and grey franco-

lin. High allelic variation at this gene appeared to be balanced at two nonsynonymous SNP sites in particular.
Although this may enhance immune system variability in
response to challenges by pathogens, a consequence of
the complex domestication history of the chicken is that
introgression, multiple origins and migration are likely to
have altered the pattern of diversity at this locus, complicating selection signatures.

Methods
Identifying candidate genes subject to selection
As the most extensively sequenced other bird species, all
available zebra finch genes were compared with the
chicken genome. This was achieved by clustering [10] validated zebra finch mRNAs and expressed sequence tags,
then using chicken protein sequences to search this zebra
finch database with Blastx, [11] and subsequently implementing T-Coffee [12] to generate 3,653 pairwise CDS
alignments from the Blastx best-hit pairs (for details see
supplementary methods).

Pairwise dN/dS (ω) was calculated for each CDS alignment
using the codeml implementation of the PAML 3.15 package [13]. If synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations
are neutral, the relative rates of each are expected to be
equal so that ω = 1 [14]. Departures from this, where ω >
1 (dN > dS) suggest that nonsynonymous mutations are
advantageous, and are maintained under directional
selection. If ω < 1 (dN <dS) then the nonsynonymous SNPs
may be deleterious since they are not preserved and are
likely to be subject to purifying selection. We compared ω
by maximum likelihood under two different models: a
neutral model where ω was fixed = 1, and a model where
ω was free to vary. These models were compared using a
likelihood ratio test (LRT) to determine if the variable
model was significantly better at explaining the data [13].
As a consequence of this conservative strategy of calculating ω across the entire gene length, genes may be discounted when the signal of directional selection is focused
on specific regions or domains and thus obscured by purifying selection operating on the majority of the gene [15].
Many genes known to be subject to positive selection have
0.5 <ω < 1 [16], so using a lower cut-off point to identify
candidate genes that may be subject to selection can be
effective. Accordingly, chicken-zebra finch alignments
with ω > 0.5 where the variable model was significantly
favoured (p < 0.05) were identified. The annotation associated with the best human orthologs from the Panther
database [17] was used to identify the function of chicken
genes with relevance to the immune system.
The chicken IL-4Rα mRNA sequence (Refseq ID:
XM_414885), initially determined by Boardman et al.
(GenBank accession: CR407301) and Caldwell et al. [18],

was aligned as a best hit to two clustered zebra finch ESTs,
DQ213788 and DQ213787[19].
Sample collection
A total of 90 chicken samples were acquired: 70 village
birds from Asia and Africa (International Livestock
Research Institute, Kenya) and 20 commercial broilers
(Manor Farms, Co. Monaghan, Ireland). The commercial
birds were composed of 10 Ross breed chickens from Ireland and 10 Hubbard Flex from France. The Asian and
African samples included 10 chickens from each of 3
Asian (Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and 4 African
(Botswana, Burkina Faso, Kenya and Senegal) populations. One sample for each of six outgroup species were
also sequenced. Three were species known to be closely
related to the chicken: [20] Chinese bamboo partridge
(Bambusicola thoracica, CAS89821), green JF (Gallus varius,
CAS85707) and grey francolin (Francolinus pondicerianus
interpositus, CAS87894) (Department of Ornithology and
Mammalogy, Californian Academy of Sciences). And
three other JF were also obtained: Grey (Gallus sonneratii),
Ceylon (Gallus lafayetii) and red JF (Gallus gallus) samples
(Wallslough Farm, Co. Kilkenny, Ireland). DNA was isolated from the samples using a phenol-chloroform extraction following a proteinase K digestion.
Resequencing strategy
The UCSC http://genome.ucsc.edu, GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
and
Ensembl
http://
www.ensembl.org browsers were used to investigate the
gene structure. At the time of analysis, a portion of the
chicken IL-4Rα region was not displayed on these browsers, so the reference assembly (NC_006101) and reference
contig (NW_001471454) were aligned with the IL-4Rα
mRNA sequence from GenBank (XM_414885) using TCoffee [12] to determine potential coding regions. A further T-Coffee alignment of the human and chicken IL-4Rα
protein sequences identified chicken regions orthologous
to variable regions in humans (Additional file 1): accord-

human IL-4Rα (Uniprot: P24394), most variation is in
the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. Genscan was
used to corroborate the predicted gene structure http://
genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html.
PCR primers were designed using Primer3 software http:/
/frodo.wi.mit.edu and were constructed by VHBio, UK
http://www.vhbio.com. The details of the primer
sequences and optimal parameters for their usage are
available in Additional file 2 (Table S1). Each amplicon
was amplified according to the PCR cycle setup (Table S2
in Additional file 2): 8 were successfully amplified for all
96 samples (Figure 1). The use of this large sample size
increases probability of identification of a target of selection [21]. The forward and reverse PCR product sequences
were determined by Agowa, Germany http://
www.agowa.de.
Sequence assembly
Sequencing reads were assembled into contigs using the
Phred-Phrap-Consed-Polyphred pipeline programs http:/
/www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html
Phrap
v0.990319 and Phred v0.020425.c [22,23]. Bases were
called with Consed [24] using P(base is correct) = 1–10-S/
10, where S the base quality score [25]. Any bases with S <
20 were not included in the analysis, so all bases had at
least a 99.0% probability of being correct: most had S ≥ 40
(99.99%). Only SNPs with high probability of being accurate (polyphred ranks 1, 2 or 3) were used in further analyses, and only SNPs in polyphred rank 1 were used for the
outgroup samples. Polyphred version 5.0 [26,27] was
used to assemble the data for further processing.

A list of the genotypes for each sample was collated and
PHASE [28] was used to infer missing haplotypes. These
assigned haplotypes were cross-referenced with haplotypes generated by Arlequin [29] to ensure consistency –
both were identical. Any sequence sites with inadequate

sub-standard base quality scores, or had insufficient coverage for either forward or reverse sequences, were
removed – leaving a total of 5,298 bp for further analysis.

chicken genotypes yielded no significant changes to
results, except at certain sites with model M8 for a divergent sample (FJ542675). The PAML models implemented
here are sensitive to low numbers of sequences [45].

Data analysis
DnaSP 4.0 [30,31] was used to analyse the polymorphic
characteristics of the data and to perform a series of population genetic analyses. The numbers and types of SNPs
were assessed. Nucleotide diversity was measured using π,
the average number of nucleotide differences between
sequences pairs [32]. The haplotype diversity (Hd, the
number and frequency of haplotypes in the sample) [33],
the number of haplotypes, Kelly's ZnS [34] and θW = 4Neμ
[35] were determined. The four gamete test for the minimum number of recombination events (RM) [36] and R
(the degree of recombination) [37] were calculated, as
was the GC content.

The free-ratio (M1) model was used to calculate tree
branch lengths and ω for each species lineage in the sample. To identify specific codon sites with evidence of selection, site-specific models estimated ω for each site across
the whole sequence by using a random sites model under
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) [13,46,47]. For each model
both the ω values and the fractions of sites affected are
informative. For M1a, a neutral model, only two (K = 2)
fixed ω values are permitted: ω0 = 0 (conserved) and ω1 =
1 (neutral). For M2a, a variable model, these two classes
are used with an additional class (K = 3) where ω is freely
estimated to allow for deviations from neutrality. Similarly, M7 is a neutral model that models K = 4 site classes
sampled from a β-distribution, all of which have 0 ≤ ω ≤
1. Variable model M8 has the same four β-distributed
classes as M7 with an additional class where ω > 1 (K = 5).
A LRT was conducted between the paired neutral and variable models (M1a vs M2a, M7 vs M8). BEB was used to
determine the posterior Bayesian probability of ω for each
amino acid site: a significantly high posterior probability
for this variable ω class suggests that a particular site is
under selection, if ω > 1 and M8 (or M2a) is significantly
favoured by the LRT [48]. Candidate positively selected
sites from M8 were examined using PMut to assess the
functional impact for each nonsynonymous substitution.

A set of summary statistics were used to identify departures from neutrality using coalescent simulations: Fu and
Li's D and F [38], Tajima's D [39], Fu's Fs [40], Fay and
Wu's H [41]. These tests were performed using DnaSP for
103 replicates with the following parameters estimated
from the resequenced data: numbers of genotypes, segregating sites, total sites, sample sizes and rate of recombination. These simulations generated empirical
distributions with which the statistical values were compared to determine the extent of their deviation from neutrality. It is an indication of non-neutral evolution if the
observed values lie at the extremes of the distribution.

Results

Median-joining haplotype networks were constructed
using Network version 4.2.0.1 http://www.fluxus-tech
nology.com. AMOVA tests [42] were conducted using
Arlequin [29] with 103 permutations. Predictions to estimate the extent of functional impact for each radical substitution were conducted using PMut http://
mmb2.pcb.ub.es:8080/PMut/[43].
The McDonald-Kreitman test [44] was implemented
using DnaSP to examine the relative ratios of fixed and
non-fixed nonsynonymous differences to fixed and nonfixed silent changes, which can indicate the presence of
non-neutral evolution. Significance was based on a twotailed Fisher's exact test.
Selection at IL-4Rα among avian species
To investigate for evidence of selection in IL-4Rα between
chicken and each of the 6 outgroups, CDS alignments
were generated and ω was determined under a variety of
models using codeml [13]. For this analysis, a chicken
sequence from the most numerous haplotype was used
(FJ542575). Although the chicken coding haplotypes
observed at IL-4Rα were diverse, substituting this for other

Confirming the signature of selection at IL-4Rα
Tests on 3,653 chicken and zebra finch CDS pairwise
alignments identified genes with ω > 0.5 where the variable model was significantly favoured from (Table S3 in
Additional file 2; Additional file 3). From these, IL-4Rα
was selected for further analysis because of its critical function in the immune response, including an implicated
role in the anti-viral response [1]. Interestingly, another
chicken immune gene identified by the pairwise comparison method (Progesterone-induced blocking factor) had
a human ortholog that binds IL-4Rα.

IL-4Rα was resequenced in 7 closely related bird species:
chicken, red JF, grey JF, Ceylon JF, green JF, grey francolin
and bamboo partridge. An excess of nonsynonymous
compared to synonymous substitutions was observed in
all birds except red JF (Table S4 in Additional file 2).
Branch-specific models of evolution, implemented in
PAML [13] were used to investigate evidence of selection
among the sequenced lineages. Using the free-ratio
model, the branch leading to the Gallus genus was determined to have a high ω value (0.92) (Additional file 4),
though this cannot be taken as strict evidence of positive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/136

selection. Consequently, site-specific models were implemented to investigate whether particular codon sites contributed to the evidence of selection. Model M8, one the
most conservative models of site-specific evolution was
determined to be significantly more favoured in comparison to the neutral M7 model (p = 5 × 10-23; Table 1). Bayes
Empirical Bayes (BEB) was used to estimate the proportion of sites under positive selection: 48 (9.8%) of the
sites had ω > 9.5, values much greater than that expected
under neutrality [47]. Under M8, 28 sites were identified
with a BEB posterior probability of at least 95% for ω > 1
(Table 2). There were substitutions between the chicken
and red JF sample or genome sequence at 6 of these sites
(5, 517, 547, 590, 628 and 665). PMut found 4 substitutions at these sites would have a neutral effect on protein
structure (Table S5 in Additional file 2).
SNP and Population diversity
Of the 100 SNPs observed among the chicken populations, 7 were singletons. In protein-coding regions 17
SNPs were observed: 10 were nonsynonymous and 7 were
synonymous. Assuming red JF was the primary ancestral
origin of diversity at this gene, some replacement mutations between red JF and chicken are potentially associated with the domestication process. In the chicken 7
nonsynonymous substitutions were identified as segregating at high frequencies (55% or more): F5L, L520P,
S590G, L594R, M665R, S670Y and T692S (Table 3, Additional file 5).

The generation of median-joining networks (Figure 2)
illustrated a high degree of allele diversity among samples
and little geographical structuring among populations.
The number of genetically divergent high-frequency haplotypes showed a trend of balanced diversity (Figure 2).
When only the nonsynonymous SNPs were examined, an
interesting pattern of dominant haplotypes emerged (Figure 3); when silent SNPs were included, recombination
obfuscated these groups (Additional files 6 &7). Four haplotypes containing 81% of the 180 genotypes were characterised by substitutions at two sites: F5L and L520P. The 4
alleles possible at these 2 sites (F-L, F-P, L-L and L-P) were
present in all 8 populations. No single variant was domi-

nant among the samples: 32 were F-L, 38 were F-P, 46
were L-L and 64 were L-P. Both sites 5 and 520 showed
evidence for positive selection in the site-specific test in
codeml (Table 2, Additional file 8). Here, red JF and
chicken both shared L520 and P520 alleles as well as F5,
but L5 was unique to chicken.
The feature of high population diversity and low geographic partitioning in the networks was apparent in the
analysis of variation using AMOVA with the Arlequin
package [29]. This assessed the extent of partitioning of
diversity at different levels of population structure. Most
variation lay within the populations (94.1%, p < 1 × 105), a trend seen in other studies of chicken populations
[48,49]; the remainder partitioned between the populations (1.8%, p = 0.060) and the continents (4.1%, p =
0.033).
Summary statistics and tests of neutrality
There was further evidence for the trend of elevated allelic
diversity: 115 haplotypes were observed in just 180 genotypes. This was reflected in the high Hd value, a statistical
measure of haplotype diversity (Table 4). Fu's FS was
highly negative, signifying an excess of rare alleles. Nucleotide, haplotype and SNP diversity were all higher in Asia
than in Africa as expected, despite sampling fewer birds in
Asia (30) than in Africa (40).

The significantly positive Tajima's D in Asia and Africa
(Table 4) and in each of their populations (Table S6 in
Additional file 2) was paralleled by a highly negative Fay
and Wu's H, an indicator of an excess of derived alleles.
Together, these metrics suggest a clear tendency for alleles
to rise to mid- or high- frequency levels. Tests on the protein-coding portion of the gene alone indicated a significantly negative Fay and Wu's H (-3.02, p = 0.04) and a less
positive Tajima's D (0.61); the latter may be a consequence of stronger conservation in coding regions, which
appears to limit diversity, except at sites 5 and 520.
Moderate recombination was detected at IL-4Rα: for the
given value of the recombination rate R, coalescent simulations showed the minimum number of recombination

events (RM) was significantly high among all groups
(Table 5).
Evidence of non-neutral evolution was evident from the
McDonald-Kreitman [44] test results. The McDonald-Kreitman test examines the relative ratios of fixed and nonfixed nonsynonymous differences to fixed and non-fixed
silent changes between species. Purifying selection may
explain a rate of fixation of nonsynonymous differences
much lower than that for silent substitutions. Alternatively, if there is a significant excess of fixation of nonsynonymous changes compared to silent ones, then
directional selection may be present. The chicken genotypes were tested against the red JF genome sequence and
also against each of the outgroup samples. Both tests
showed an excess of fixed nonsynonymous substitutions
(p = 0.002 with the genome sequence, p = 0.040 with all
the outgroup samples; Table 6), indicating that selection
may have affected the evolution of this gene.

Discussion

Identifying IL-4Rα as a candidate for resequencing
A pairwise comparison of ω = dN/dS in chicken and zebra
finch genes identified IL-4Rα as having an elevated rate of
nonsynonymous substitutions, suggesting it as a candidate for positive selection [50], though relaxed selective
constraint has been observed in other domestic species
[51]. Due to an important role in the host immune
response and evidence of selection in humans, IL-4Rα was
resequenced in 6 closely related birds and subsequently in
70 global village chickens and 20 commercial broilers. An
analysis of sequence data from these 6 related species
identified a large number of sites likely to be subject to
positive selection, supporting the initial detection of IL4Rα as a candidate gene undergoing adaptive evolution.
Probable confounding factors in these results, however,
are the complex domestication history of these populations and high rate of recombination identified at this
locus.

The identification of chicken IL-4Rα is of particular interest
given the vital role played by its human ortholog as a regulator of IgE production and TH2 cell differentiation [52,53].
The critical role of human IL-4Rα in the immune response
is evidenced by its differential expression during particular
infections and its association between polymorphism and
disease susceptibility; it facilitates gastrointestinal nematode clearance [54] and its expression is upregulated in
response to HIV-1 infection [55]. Variation in human IL4Rα has been shown to affect signal transduction [56] and
to modulate TH1/TH2 balance in the blood [57], as well as
contributing to various allergies [9] and to mumps virus
infection susceptibility [58]. Selection at IL-4Rα in human
populations may be driven by different TH1 (viral and bacterial) and TH2 (parasitical) immune responses to pathogens [52], and the dysregulation of such components of
immunity may be associated with atopy [59].

The origin of diversity at IL-4Rα
Although nucleotide diversity at this gene (5.19 per kb)
was comparable to that observed between red JF and
domestic fowl (5.36 per kb on average) [2], the substantial excess of haplotypes was suggestive of non-neutral
evolution. Despite this, the significantly positive Fu and
Li's D and F values show that there was a relative deficit of
singletons [39]. A deficit of rare alleles in commercial
chicken lines has been observed in other studies comparing wild and standard breeds [65]. In this study, the Hd
and Fu's FS values highlighted this rare allele deficiency in
the commercial broilers, in contrast with the excess of
haplotypes in the Asian and African samples. In addition,
the significantly high RM values indicated that some
recombinant alleles were present in the populations,
implying either relaxed selective constraint or adaptive
processes favouring allelic diversity.

Tajima's D compares the proportions of low- to mediumfrequency alleles and is an indicator of directional selection when negative, and balancing selection when positive [40] (Tajima 1989). Fay and Wu's H measures the
relative frequency of derived alleles, which increases when
there are more high-frequency haplotypes [42]. The
observed surplus of mid- and high-frequency haplotypes
at the IL-4Rα locus has generated highly significant D and
H values that are more extreme than those observed by
other studies of disease-associated chicken genes [6,48] –
however, D and H are likely to be affected by demographic aspects of chicken history and the samples pooling [66].
The networks were diffused into several divergent highfrequency haplotype clusters with high intra-population
diversity. A distinctive set of balanced alleles was apparent
when silent substitutions were removed. The signal of balanced diversity in the chicken populations appeared to
centre around two nonsynonymous substitutions: F5L
and L520P. All four variants at these two sites were segregating in the 8 populations surveyed at similar frequencies. Site-specific models of evolution identified both
these sites as likely subject to selection across species.
An alignment of the chicken and human IL-4Rα protein
sequences identified the amino acid positions orthologous to sites 5 and 520 in chicken (Additional file 1). The
site orthologous to the latter is segregating in humans
(C431R, rs1805012) [67,68] at an intermediate frequency
of over 10% in the population [69], similar to the chicken
polymorphism. Substitution C431R is in the cytoplasmic

domain of the receptor and is linked with better survival
from gliomas in humans [70]. The human amino acid
position orthologous to chicken site 5 is conserved (F10)
and is located in the signal peptide of the protein, indicating that the L5 chicken variant might affect activation of
the receptor protein.
There is series of shared population genetic properties
between chicken and human IL-4Rα that may be the
result of equivalent functional roles for each. The genes
possess comparable McDonald-Kreitman test results and
positive Tajima's D values [49] and share orthologous
high-frequency nonsynonymous SNPs (L520P and
C431R). And given that several amino acid substitutions
in IL-4Rα affect disease susceptibility in humans (see
Franjkovic et al. [71]), the variability at nonsynonymous
substitution sites in chickens is likely to be of biological
importance.
The balanced and elevated variation and possible selective
processes at chicken IL-4Rα may be in response to the
common pathogens and the range of pleiotropic roles
that the receptor plays in facilitating cytokine binding in
the innate immune response. The trend of high diversity
fuelled by balancing selection is seen in other chicken
immune genes including MHC-B [3], Mx [6] and IL1B
[48], which initially suggests that immune system genes
may maintain high diversity in order to respond to a wide
array of pathogens.
Another explanation for the observed elevated balanced
diversity is that multiple domestications of red JF and genetic

introgressions of other JF have both enhanced and distorted
variation at this locus. The lack of observed geographic structure, which has also been observed at other chicken genes,
[48] may be in part a consequence of this. There are likely to
have been multiple events of chicken domestication in
South and South-East Asia [72-74]. And though the red JF is
the main source of chicken genetic diversity [2,75], genetic
introgressions have come from other wild JF [76]: possibly
from Ceylon JF [77] and unambiguously at the yellow skin
locus from grey JF [78]. Wild red JF and domestic village
strains are closely related [50,79], indicating that introgressions of red JF may have continued after domestication.
Here, networks of IL-4Rα indicate that red JF is the most
closely related wild relative to the domestic chicken. This
does not exclude the possibility of multiple contributions of
different genetic sources of JF. If admixture of different
sources occurred sufficiently early through trading and
migration [80,81] this may explain the presence of the four
alleles at the two nonsynonymous sites in each population.
Regardless of whether this signal of high and balanced diversity is from biological pleiotropy or from multiple origins, it
is persisting, indicating that it may have an important role in
current chicken immunity.

Conclusion
This study shows evidence for high and balanced diversity
at the chicken IL-4Rα gene, which was initially identified
through the evaluation of the rate of nonsynonymous to
synonymous substitutions in pairwise comparisons of
chicken and zebra finch orthologs. This strategy incorporated functional and literature information to detect a
suitable gene for resequencing in African, Asian and commercial chicken samples, as well as in related JF and bird
species. Haplotype networks, tests of neutrality and summary statistics indicated a signal of balanced nonsynonymous polymorphisms at two sites in the IL-4Rα gene.
Networks showed that red JF is the primary source of
diversity at this gene. The elevated and balanced diversity
present in all the populations might be a result of the
chicken's history of multiple domestications [72-74],
introgressions [76-78] and subsequent admixture of different types [79-81]. However, the identification of two
potentially functionally significant SNPs as fulcrums of
the balancing signal suggest that the functions of IL-4Rα

in the immune system may affected by selective processes
for specific allelic variants in response to new pathogenic
challenges during domestication.
