Abstract
Introduction: Jorge Lobo's disease (Lacaziosis) is a subcutaneous infection of humans living in the
Amazon region of Latin America, and in dolphins inhabiting the east coastal areas of the United
States. The disease mainly affects people from rural areas living or working in close contact with
vegetation and aquatic environments. Most patients refer having developed lesions after accidental
trauma with plant thorns or insect bites. Inter-human transmission has never been confirmed
suggesting that Lacazia loboi is acquired from environmental propagules.
Case presentation: We report the case of a 41-year-old woman from São Paulo, Brazil, a nonendemic area of Jorge Lobo's disease, with L. loboi skin infection most likely accidentally acquired
while manipulating experimentally infected mice in the laboratory.
Conclusion: Because many patients with Jorge Lobo's disease do not recall accidental skin trauma
before their infections, the possibility of accidentally acquired Jorge Lobo's disease through
unnoticed broken skin should be considered during the clinical investigation of nodular skin
diseases in people who have contact with the fungus or who live in endemic areas. This is the
second report of animal to human transmission of this disease.

Introduction
Jorge Lobo's disease is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis
restricted to the geographic area of the Amazon (Brazil,
Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Bolivia, Peru and
Colombia) and other Latin American countries where isolated cases have also been reported [1-3]. The geographical distribution of Jorge Lobo's disease expanded after
reports of the occurrence of the disease in dolphins [4].

Due to the fact that this anomalous pathogen resists culture, the reservoir of Lacazia loboi in nature is largely
unknown. However, it is believed that L. loboi might be
present in the humid areas of the Amazon basin [1,2,5].
The disease mainly affects male patients from rural areas
living or working in close contact with vegetation and
aquatic environments [1,5,6]. Most patients report having

developed lesions after accidental trauma with plant
thorns or insect bites, yet others do not recall trauma
before the disease. The transmission between humans,
especially domiciliary dissemination, has never been confirmed suggesting that L. loboi is mostly acquired from
environmental propagules [1]. This hypothesis is strongly
supported by the unusual disappearance of the disease
when an entire Brazilian Caibi Indian tribe, usually
affected by L. loboi, was relocated to a non-endemic area
of the disease [1,6]. However, human to human, animal
to animal and animal to human transmission cannot be
ruled out since accidental and experimental Jorge Lobo's
disease has been well documented [7-10].

Case presentation
In March 2007, an otherwise healthy 41-year-old Caucasian female veterinarian from Instituto Lauro de Souza
Lima, Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil complained of a slowly
growing subcutaneous nodule on the inner side of her left
hand middle finger. The patient did not recall any previous trauma in that particular anatomical area. The nodule
had appeared 10 months earlier as a small hard cutaneous
swelling on the proximal articular side of the middle phalanx, resembling a synovial cyst. The nodular skin lesion
was very small and painless, therefore the patient did not
seek immediate medical attention. In the following
months after she had first noted the tissue swelling, the
nodule increased in size and interfered with flexion of the
affected finger. It was difficult to determine whether the
nodule was attached to the skin or to the subcutaneous
tissue at palpation. Clinical examination of the subcutaneous nodular lesion (~2.0 × 1.5 cm in diameter) by a surgeon led to diagnosis of a giant cell tumor of the flexor
tendon, and surgical excision was advised. Physical examination revealed that the patient was in good general
health and had no other similar skin lesions. Surgery was
performed 10 months after the initial onset.
The granulomatous 2 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm excised mass
was attached to the dermis, nerves and tendons of the
affected finger. It consisted of a firm yellowish tumorallike mass resembling a lipoma, with a smooth bright surface. Because of the initial diagnosis of a benign tumor,
microbiological testing (including culture) was not
requested. Histopathological examination of hematoxylin-eosin stained sections showed a granulomatous infiltrate constituted by histiocytes and giant cells filled with
numerous thick walled yeast-like cells, either singly or in
chains, characteristic of L. loboi (Figures 1 and 2). The
majority of the fungal elements in the infected tissues
showed clear cytoplasmic content, a morphological characteristic of viable L. loboi yeast-like cells. Methenamine
silver staining showed spherical to oval yeast-like cells
mostly uniform in size and arranged singly or in small
chains of cells linked by small tube-like structures (Figures

after use of clofazimine and dapsone, which have antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activity, in concomitant leprosy and Jorge Lobo's disease patients, Jorge
Lobo's lesions became atrophic. Itraconazole was chosen
as the antifungal drug because of its low toxicity, high
affinity to skin and good results when used with clofazimine in a Jorge Lobo's disease case. To prevent recurrence
of the lesion in the present patient, drug therapy with

included processing of human skin biopsies and mice
foot pads infected with L. loboi. She also purified L. loboi
fungal cells for mice inoculation, antigen preparation and
L. loboi DNA extraction. Moreover, since L. loboi cannot be
cultured, she had worked with purified live fungal yeast
cells of L. loboi for maintenance of these strains in laboratory mice (she usually processed samples containing 5.1 ×
106 L. loboi yeast-like cells). For the past 3 years, she had
made several 1-week field trips to the State of Acre, Brazil.
During these trips, she collected several skin biopsies from
patients with the disease, performed viability tests and
collected environmental samples from the tropical rainforest in the Antimary Reservation Area, where many Jorge
Lobo's disease patients reside.

clofazimine (50 mg/day), dapsone (100 mg/day) and itraconazole (200 mg/day) was initiated immediately after
surgical intervention and continued for 1 year.

Discussion
Our patient had lived for the past 10 years in the city of
Bauru, São Paulo State, Brazil, a non-endemic geographical area for Jorge Lobo's disease. However, she had
worked extensively with the fungus L. loboi in experimentally infected mice and had visited an endemic area for
Jorge Lobo's disease. Her main laboratory activities

The human Jorge Lobo's disease cases reported in the literature refer to long-term incubation and slow growth of
lesions in cases acquired from endemic areas [1,5]. However, the incubation intervals of humans residing outside
the endemic areas of Jorge Lobo's disease varied. For
instance, a French aquarium caretaker developed the disease 3 months after handling a L. loboi infected dolphin
[10]. In contrast, in a man who apparently acquired the
infection after traveling to Venezuela, the lesion appeared
two and a half years after his trip to the endemic area [11].
A Canadian woman developed Jorge Lobo's disease 1 year
after she had been to Guyana and Venezuela [12]. A
bizarre case of experimental human Jorge Lobo's disease
in a laboratory assistant inoculated with the yeast-like
cells collected from a Venezuelan man with Jorge Lobo's
disease was reported by Borelli [8]. The lesion slowly
increased in size, and after 4 years, had attained 33 mm in
diameter. In addition, experimental inoculation of BALB/
c mice with L. loboi cells obtained from patients with the
disease showed macroscopic lesions in 7 to 8 months [9].
Interestingly, it has been noted that lesions developed
faster within 4 months after inoculation, on continuous
passages from mice to mice, indicating a better adapted L.
loboi to experimental mice infection [7].
In this case report, the patient had had contact with the
fungus for about 10 years and her finger lesion increased
in size relatively rapidly in an 8-month period since May
2006, when she first noted a small skin lesion. If the
patient had acquired the infection from environmental
propagules or by yeast-like cells from infected humans,
most likely the fungus would slowly reproduce and the
lesion would appear not in a few months, but years after
the traumatic implantation, as is usually the case in
patients with Jorge Lobo's disease [1,5,6]. Moreover, our
patient developed a single lesion on her left hand middle
finger extensively used to manipulate biopsied tissues and
to inoculated mice with live yeast-like cells. This observation and the rapid progress of her finger lesion might suggest that she probably came into contact with L. loboi

while manipulating samples from Jorge Lobo's disease
patients or during experimental inoculation of mice, and
less likely from natural environmental propagules of L.
loboi.
This accidentally acquired case of Jorge Lobo's disease in
a woman working with live L. loboi yeast-like cells raises
several questions regarding the epidemiology and virulence of L. loboi. This fungus does not grow in vitro and it
has never been identified in environmental samples. It is
therefore believed to be a restricted human and dolphin
pathogen, and transmission between susceptible hosts
seems to be its survival strategy [6]. However, several lines
of evidence suggest that L. loboi is acquired either through
contact with propagules present in contaminated ecological niches closely related to rivers and damp wooded areas
[1,2,5,6,11,12], or through contact with propagules from
hosts infected with Jorge Lobo's disease (humans, dolphins and experimentally infected mice) [7,9,10]. The
classical examples of naturally acquired Jorge Lobo's disease are the cases of the disease reported during trips to
endemic countries [11,12] and the relocation of a Brazilian Indian tribe, where Jorge Lobo's disease cases were
known, to a non-endemic area [1,6]. Alternatively, Jorge
Lobo's disease could be directly acquired between hosts
with the disease such as dolphins to humans [10] and by
the many reports of experimental inoculation with live
yeast-like cells of L. loboi in humans [8] and mice [7,9].
A classical myth about L. loboi is that this anomalous fungal pathogen has low virulence and is limited to the cool
areas of the subcutaneous tissues [2,5]. However, the
present report and other similar cases of naturally and
experimentally acquired Jorge Lobo's disease [8-12] suggest that L. loboi has a well developed degree of virulence
and can cause disease in apparently healthy as well as in
immunocompromised hosts [3,8,10-13]. In the present
report, the infected patient did not recall a major trauma
at the site of infection. This implies that L. loboi could
eventually reach the subcutaneous tissues through imperceptible abrasions on the upper layers of the skin. Since
this pathogen is a slow growing fungus in its parasitic
stage, L. loboi should possess a yet to be described adhesive
mechanism to maintain close attachment to the injured
skin. The activation of such a mechanism should be of
particular importance in anatomical areas such as the
hands, constantly washed with detergents and other
chemicals.
Since L. loboi has been phylogenetically linked to other
dimorphic fungal pathogens in the family Ajellomycetaceae [14,15], it could well be a dimorphic fungus with a
mycelial form in nature and high tropism for soil of damp
environmental areas. Thus, it could be acquired through
skin trauma either by propagules accessible in nature, per-

http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/3/1/67

haps similar to that present in the mycelial form of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, or by contact with the L. loboi yeastlike cells present in the host's infected tissues. Based on
the epidemiology and location of the lesion in our
patient, we also believe that L. loboi possess a sophisticated mechanism to remain attached to the injured skin,
and therefore this adhesive substance might be an important virulence factor.
All in all, we believe that L. loboi has evolved and developed unique virulence factors allowing the pathogen to
remain in the infected tissues for long periods of time (≤
50 years), and thus becoming the perfect pathogen. This is
in direct contrast to other members of the Ajellomycetaceae. The ability of L. loboi to remain in the infected tissues
for years without killing the host might have had a significant role in shaping its genome during its evolutionary
path to a more restricted mammalian pathogen.

Conclusion
This is a report of animal to human transmission of Jorge
Lobo's disease. Because most patients with Jorge Lobo's
disease do not recall accidental skin trauma during daily
activities before their infections, the possibility of having
accidentally acquired Jorge Lobo's disease through unnoticed broken skin on people residing and/or working in
endemic areas, health care personnel dealing with Jorge
Lobo's disease proven cases in humans or dolphins, or
researchers working with purified yeast-like cells of L.
loboi, should be carefully considered during clinical investigation of nodular skin disease.
