Abstract
Hantavirus genome sequences were recovered from tissue samples of Myodes rufocanus, Microtus
fortis and Microtus oeconomus captured in the Baikal area of Buryatia, Russian Federation. Genetic
analysis of S- and M-segment sequences of Buryatian hantavirus strains showed that Myodesassociated strains belong to Hokkaido virus (HOKV) type while Microtus-associated strains belong
to Vladivostok virus (VLAV) type. On phylogenetic trees Buryatian HOKV strains were clustered
together with M. rufocanus- originated strains from Japan, China and Far-East Russia (Primorsky
region). Buryatian Microtus- originated strains shared a common recent ancestor with M. fortisoriginated VLAV strain from Far-East Russia (Vladivostok area). Our data (i) confirm that M.
rufocanus carries a hantavirus which is similar to but distinct from both Puumala virus carried by M.
glareolus and Muju virus associated with M. regulus, (ii) confirm that M. fortis is the natural host for
VLAV, and (iii) suggest M. oeconomus as an alternative host for VLAV.

Background
Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) are
negative-strand RNA viruses with a tripartite genome,
each carried by a specific rodent or insectivore host [1].
Some hantaviruses, e. g. Hantaan and Seoul viruses in
Asia, Puumala (PUUV), Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses in
Europe, Sin Nombre and Andes viruses in the Americas,
are human pathogens while others, e.g. Microtus-associated hantaviruses of both hemispheres are considered
apathogenic [2,3]. For some hantaviruses, e.g. PUUV-like

Hokkaido virus (HOKV) associated with Myodes rufocanus
or Topografov virus (TOPV) carried by Lemmus sibiricus,
pathogenicity was neither convincingly demonstrated nor
completely ruled out [4,5].
In addition to the abovementioned HOKV, TOPV,
Hantaan, and Seoul viruses, several more hantaviruses
have been found in Asia. These include three well-established species: Thottapalayam virus in Suncus murinus [6],
Thailand virus in Bandicuta indica [7], and Khabarovsk

virus (KHAV) in M. fortis [8]. Also several provisional species have been described: Da Bie Shan virus in Nivivevnter
confucianus [9], Gou virus in Rattus rattus [9], Vladivostok
virus (VLAV) in M. fortis [10], Amur/Soochong virus in
Apodemus peninsulae [11,12], and Muju virus (MUJV) in
Myodes regulus [13]. Of all Asian hantaviruses, so far only
TOPV was found in Siberia. In this project we attempted
to analyze hantaviruses circulating in Buryatia, the autonomy in Russian Federation located between the Lake
Baikal and Mongolia. The biogeographic position of Buryatia is interesting because the taiga corridor zone south
of the Lake Baikal has been important for the exchange of
eastern and western elements of the palearctic fauna.

Methods
Screening of rodent samples
Rodents were trapped in August 2005 in five localities in
Buryatia, Russian Federation. Samples of 504 small mammals were collected, including samples from lung, kidney
and spleen (of most animals) in RNA Later [Ambion] and
in Laemmli sample buffer, and in addition a blood sample dried on filter paper. The blood samples were
extracted from the filter paper to PBS and were screened
by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the presence of
antibodies to hantaviruses (Puumala and Dobrava virus
antigens) (the details of trapping and IFA-screening will
be published elsewhere). Ab-positive rodents were
checked for the presence of hantaviral N-antigen (N-Ag)
using immunoblotting of the lung tissue samples as
described earlier [14,15].
RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing
RNA was purified from N-Ag-positive lung tissue samples
with the TriPure reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then subjected to the RT-PCR to recover: (i) complete or partial
(coding region) S segment sequences, and (ii) partial (nt
2766-3007) M segment sequences (sequences of primers
and other experimental details are available upon
request). PCR amplicons have been gel-purified with
QIAquick Gel Extraction-kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced
either directly or after cloning into pGEM-T vector
(Promega) using ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator or ABI
PRISM™ M13F and M13R Dye Primer sequencing kits
(PerkinElmer/ABI, NJ), respectively. HOKV genome
sequences described in this paper have been deposited to
the GenBank sequences database under accession numbers AM930972, AM930975, and AM930976. VLAV
genome sequences described in this paper have been
deposited to the GenBank sequences database under
accession numbers AM930973, AM930974, AM930977,
AM930978, and AM930979.

Phylogenetic analysis
To infer phylogenies, the PHYLIP program package [16]
was used. Hantavirus sequences used for comparison were
recovered from the GenBank. 500 bootstrap replicates
generated for complete coding sequences of the S segment, as well as partial sequences of the M segment (Seqboot program) were submitted to the distance matrice
algorithm (Dnadist). Distance matrices were analyzed
with the Fitch-Margoliash tree-fitting algorithm (Fitch) or
with Neighbor-joining algorithm (Neighbor) using the
ML model for nucleotide substitutions; the bootstrap support values were calculated with the Consense program.
The nucleotide sequence data were also analyzed using
the Tree-Puzzle program (maximum likelihood) [17] with
the HKY model for nucleotide substitutions and 10 000
puzzling steps.

Results
Screening of rodent samples for the presence of hantaviral
markers
Rodents were first screened by IFA for the presence of antihantaviral antibodies. Altogether eight Ab-positive
rodents were selected; these were further checked for the
presence of hantaviral N-Ag. Five animals were found positive, namely two Myodes rufocanus, #767 and #791, captured near Muhorshibir town, one Microtus oeconomus,
#483 captured near Barguzin river and two Microtus fortis,
#500 and #503, trapped in the vicinity of Nesterikha village. All five N-Ag-positive rodents were analyzed by RTPCR with hantavirus-specific primers and all five were
found positive for hantaviral RNA. Hantaviral S and M
segment sequences were recovered from these five
rodents. Complete S segment sequences were recovered
from M. rufocanus #767, M. oeconomus #483, and M. fortis
#503. Partial S segment sequences were recovered from M.
rufocanus #791 (almost complete coding region) and M.
fortis #500 (complete coding region). These partial
sequences appeared identical to the corresponding parts
of the S-sequences recovered from M. rufocanus #767 and
M. fortis #503, respectively. Partial M segment sequences
were recovered for all five animals: nt 2766-3007 for
Microtus, and nt 2702-3007 for Myodes (the numeration is
given for PUUV sequence).

As expected, S- and/or M-sequences from M. rufocanus
showed the closest similarity to the previously described
M. rufocanus- originated sequences from Japan
(Hokkaido), China (Fusong) and Far-East Russia (Primorsky region). The name "Hokkaido virus (HOKV)" has
been suggested for the Myodes (erlier called, Clethrionomys)
rufocanus- associated hantavirus and, following this line,
we designated Buryatian wild-type (wt) strains as HOK/
Muhorshibir/Mr767/2005
and
HOK/Muhorshibir/
Mr791/2005, or Muhorshibir767 and Muhorshibir791,
for short.

The S-sequences from Buryatian M. fortis showed the closest similarity to M. fortis-originated sequence recovered
from Vladivostok area, Far-East Russia [10] thus providing
additional evidence that this rodent species can harbor
VLAV. We designated these hantavirus strains VLA/Nesterikha/Mf503/2005, and VLA/Nesterikha/Mf500/2005
or Nesterikha503 and Nesterikha500, for short. To our
surprise, the S-sequence recovered from M. oeconomus,
captured near river Barguzin, was very close to the Ssequence of Nesterikha503 strain. To rule out possible
mistakes in species identification, mtDNA from rodent
#483 was analyzed and its initial identification as M.
oeconomus confirmed. Since hantavirus genome sequence
recovered from M. oeconomus belonged to VLAV genotype
the corresponding wt hantavirus strain was designated as
VLA/Barguzin/Mo483/2005, or Barguzin483, for short.
Genetic analysis of Buryatian HOKV strains
As mentioned above, the S segment sequence of
Muhorshibir767 strain appeared most closely related to
the corresponding sequences of other HOKV strains. For
coding regions the sequence identity was 84–86% (3'noncoding regions could not be aligned unequivocally).
On the phylogenetic tree calculated for the S segment coding region (Fig. 1), strain Muhorshibir767 was placed
within the well supported clade formed by three hantavirus species associated with Myodes voles: PUUV, HOKV,
and MUJV. Within this clade, PUUV and HOKV shared a
more ancient common ancestor and the pair appeared as
sister taxa to MUJV. Notably, the deduced amino acid (aa)
sequences of the N protein of PUUV, HOKV, and MUJV
were of the same length (433 aa residues), a clear sign of
their close genetic ties and shared evolution. Furthermore,
the N protein sequence of Muhorshibir767 strain not only
showed the highest identity to the corresponding
sequences of HOKV strains from Hokkaido and Fusong
(97.5% and 96.5%, respectively) but also carried a specific
aa signature of HOKV: Val/Ile68, Ile262. In addition, all
HOKV strains shared seven signature aa residues with
PUUV: Asp6, Ile134, Val251, Ser305, Ala313, Ile324, and
Gly/Ser412, but only four with MUJV: Lys5, Arg26,
Lys258, and Pro283. On the S-tree (Fig. 1), HOKV strains
formed three genetic lineages represented, respectively, by
strains from Japan (strains Kamiiso and Tobetsu), China
(Fusong strains), and Buryatia (strain Muhorshibir767). It
should be noted that, while PUUV strains (the ones
shown on the Fig. 1 belonged to six genetic lineages)
formed a distinct, well-supported group, the monophyly
of HOKV strains did not receive a substantial bootstrap
support. Hopefully, when more HOKV sequences become
available the phylogenetic resolution would improve.

Similarly to the S segment sequences, the M-sequences
recovered from Buryatian M. rufocanus were most closely
related to the corresponding sequences of other HOKV

strains: the ones from China (Fusong) [sequences available from GenBank] and also Far-East Russia (Primorsky

region) [18]. The M segment sequences of Japanese strains
were not determined yet and, consequently, the Japanese
genetic lineage was not presented on the phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 2). Within HOKV group, Chinese and Russian strains
showed geographical clustering and formed a distinct
genetic lineage. Another lineage was formed by two Buryatian strains. The monophyly of all HOKV strains was supported reasonably well (64%). Again, all Myodesoriginated sequences showed the host-dependent clustering of PUUV, HOKV and MUJV genetic variants, in good
agreement with the idea of co-evolution of hantaviruses
with their natural carriers [19-21].

substitution only (sequence identity 99.6%). Complete Ssequences of strains Nesterikha503 and Barguzin483 were
very close to each other: only nine nucleotide substitutions were found in the coding region (sequence identity
99.3%) and only seven mutations, six substitutions and
one deletion, in the 3'-noncoding region that, in this case,
could be easily aligned. Seven of nine nucleotide substitutions found in the coding region were silent. Two mutations caused homologous aa substitutions in the deduced
sequence of the N protein: Lys96->Arg and Ile326->Val.
Partial M segment sequences of these two strains differed
by three silent substitutions (sequence identity 99.2%).

Genetic analysis of Buryatian VLAV strains
The S segment sequences of two Nesterikha strains were
identical; their partial M-sequences differed by one silent

Two closely related S segment sequences of Buryatian
VLAV strains showed the highest level of sequence identity
to the prototype wt strain from Vladivostok (Far-East Russia): 87.3–87.4%. The deduced aa sequences of the N protein of two Buryatian VLAV strain were 95.5% identical to
the corresponding sequence of Vladivostok strain. The Nsequence identities with closely related KHAV and TOPV
were substantially lower: 91.0% and 90.3%, respectively.
On the phylogenetic tree constructed for the S segment
coding region (Fig. 1), two Buryatian VLAV strains clustered in the closest proximity to each other and shared the
most recent common ancestor with the Vladivostok
strain. This trio, in turn, shared a more ancient common
ancestor with KHAV and TOPV. All the branches within
this group were well supported (87% to 100%). Phylogenetic trees calculated for partial M segment sequences
showed a similar branching pattern (Fig. 3). All three
VLAV strains from Buryatia clustered together and formed
a monophyletic group with KHAV and TOPV. However,
the bootstrap support values were, again, rather low, most

probably due to the very small number (and, perhaps,
also the low genetic diversity) of the sequences available
for this analysis.

Discussion
There are no earlier data on hantaviruses in Buryatia. The
taiga region south of Lake Baikal has acted as a corridor for
the palearctic fauna and Buryatian rodents were therefore
of special interest in the study of hantavirus evolution in
Eurasia. Myodes rufocanus is found throughout the palearctic taiga, and Microtus fortis is at the northwest corner of its
distribution range in Buryatia. Samples of both species
were found positive in our immunoblotting assay; this
suggested a possible involvement of HOKV and KHAV or
VLAV. Earlier, HOKV genome sequences were recovered
from M. rufocanus captured in Japan, Far-East Russia and
China [10,18]. M. fortis was known as the natural host for
KHAV [8]. Our earlier analysis of KHAV and TOPV suggested that a host-switch had occurred in the evolution of
these hantaviruses [5].
There was also a report describing the recovery of partial
hantaviral S segment sequence of from M. fortis captured
near Vladivostok [10]. In our experiments, RT-PCR followed by sequencing confirmed the presence of HOKV
and VLAV in M. rufocanus and M. fortis, respectively. These
data support the notion on M. fortis as a natural host for
VLAV. Furthermore, our findings of VLAV sequences in M.
oeconomus suggest that this rodent species could carry
VLAV as well. Notably, both vole species belong to the
same subgenus Alexandromys in the genus Microtus, i.e.
genetically they are closely related to each other [22]. Of
course, spillover of VLAV from its real host (whatever it is)
to other sympatric rodent species, cannot be excluded and
therefore further investigation of this issue is needed.
Phylogenetic analysis of newly recovered Buryatian hantavirus sequences was complicated by limited datasets available for HOKV and especially VLAV genetic variants. This,
in our opinion, was the very reason for the lower than
desired resolution (seen as <70% bootstrap support values for a number of branching points). Our previous experience tells that, at least in some cases, an addition of onetwo "critical" sequences to the dataset could remarkably
improve the phylogenetic resolution [23,24]. Some
improvement could also be achieved by the recovery of
longer M segment sequences directly from rodent tissue
samples. So far, this presented a real problem for our Buryatian collection. Isolation of HOKV and VLAV in cell culture would, undoubtedly, speed the progress in this
direction. Despite these drawbacks, the general phylogeny
of HOKV genetic variants looked logical and supportive to
the hypothesis of hantavirus-host co-evolution (Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/4

Our finding of VLAV sequences in M. oeconomus was a bit
surprising and thus added a new twist to the already quite
intriguing relationships between TOPV, KHAV, and VLAV.
KHAV and VLAV, both carried by Microtus voles, do not
cluster on the phylogenetic trees with other hantaviruses
carried by Microtus (TULV, PHV, ISLAV, and BLLV) but
instead appeared monophyletic with TOPV and the
KHAV-VLAV-TOPV trio forms a sister taxon to the Myodescarried hantaviruses: PUUV, HOKV, and MUJV (Fig. 1).
This clustering is in apparent disagreement with strict
hantavirus-host co-evolution and would suggest hostswitching event(s). One could imagine three possible scenarios. The first scenario includes a host-switch of an
ancient hantavirus from Myodes to Lemmus yielding an
ancestor for TOPV, KHAV, and VLAV, followed by two
independent, and separated in time, host-switching
events of a Lemmus-associated virus to Microtus yielding
KHAV and VLAV. The second scenario involves a "jump"
of an ancient hantavirus from Myodes to Microtus followed
by diversification of hosts for KHAV and VLAV and
another "jump" of pre-KHAV from Microtus to Lemmus
yielding TOPV. The third scenario implies that Microtusassociated hantaviruses are the most ancestral ones
among the group carried by Arvicolinae rodents. According
to this scenario, in a single host-switching event an
ancient Microtus-carried virus gave origin to the ancestor
of all Myodes-carried viruses and later pre-KHAV virus
"jumped" from Microtus to Lemmus, producing TOPV.
Future studies, incuding analysis of larger sets of TOPV,
KHAV and VLAV variants, preferably originated from a
wider geographical area and showing substantial genetic
diversity, would be needed to evaluate these hypotheses.

Conclusion
In this paper, for the first time, we describe HOKV and
VLAV strains found in Buryatia, Russian Federation.
Although no human cases have been so far attributed to
either of these two hantaviruses, further epidemiological
studies are needed to estimate a seroprevalence to HOKV
and VLAV (as well as other hantaviruses, such as Amur/
Soochong virus carried by Apodemus peninsulae) in Buryatian population and to evaluate potential threats to
human health which might be imposed by these hantaviruses.
