Abstract
Background: In insects, including Anopheles mosquitoes, Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) appears
to be involved in phagocytosis of pathogens, and shows pathogen-specific splice-form expression between
divergent pathogen (or parasite) types (e.g. between bacteria and Plasmodium or between Plasmodium berghei and
Plasmodium falciparum). Here, data are presented from the first study of Dscam expression in response to genetic
diversity within a parasite species.
Methods: In independent field and laboratory studies, a measure of Dscam splice-form diversity was compared
between mosquitoes fed on blood that was free of P. falciparum to mosquitoes exposed to either single or mixed
genotype infections of P. falciparum.
Results: Significant increases in Anopheles gambiae Dscam (AgDscam) receptor diversity were observed in parasiteexposed mosquitoes, but only weak evidence that AgDscam diversity rises further upon exposure to mixed
genotype parasite infections was found. Finally, a cluster of AgDscam exon 4 variants that become especially
common during Plasmodium invasion was identified.
Conclusions: While the data clearly indicate that AgDscam diversity increases with P. falciparum exposure, they do
not suggest that AgDscam diversity rises further in response to increased parasite diversity.

Background
The innate immune system is common to both invertebrates and vertebrates, and although less well studied
than the adaptive immune response, is probably responsible for eliminating the majority of infectious organisms. This is achieved through engulfing cells (e.g.
phagocytes), antimicrobial compounds (e.g. defensins)
and non-specific reactive intermediates such as nitric
oxide [1-5]. The vertebrate adaptive immune system
appears to have more complex features: functional antibodies assembled by V-(D)-J joining of gene segments
and diversified by somatic hypermutation accommodate
an unrivalled resolution in terms of pathogen recognition for the vertebrate adaptive immune response [6].

Invertebrates, lacking antibodies and having only an
innate immune system, rely on germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pattern associated molecular patterns and initiate a response [2,7-9].
The absence of an equivalent of the vertebrate adaptive immune system has long fostered doubts that the
invertebrate immune system could incorporate specificity and/or memory [10-12]. However, the absence of
the cellular and genetic components of a vertebrate-like
anticipatory immune system does not preclude a functional equivalent in invertebrates [13], and there exists
evidence of enhanced secondary responses to homologous infectious challenges [14-22]. Moreover, in invertebrates, the genetic background of both hosts and
parasites plays a critical role in determining the probability of infection, a phenomenon called genetic specificity [13,23,24]. Thus invertebrate defences do not lack
sophistication, but the genetic and cellular mechanisms

that underlie either invertebrate genetic specificity or
enhanced secondary responses remain obscure (but see
[25]).
Alternative splicing could permit a single gene to
mediate alternative immune responses via the production of multiple proteins, and the flexibility of such a
mechanism could have important implications for the
spread of resistance alleles [26]. The Down syndrome
cell adhesion molecule (Dscam), which can take some
tens of thousands of different forms through alternative
splicing, is commonly associated with its function in the
vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems, but seems
to also play a role in invertebrate immunity [27-30]. In
the fruit fly Drosophila, Dscam is expressed in cell types
that play major roles in the fly’s immune system, and
RNA interference-mediated depletion of Dscam was
shown to impair the insect’s capacity to engulf bacteria
by phagocytosis [29]. Similarly, the silencing of Anopheles gambiae Dscam (AgDscam) compromises the
mosquito’s ability to resist Plasmodium [30]. Moreover,
AgDscam produces pathogen-specific splice form repertoires upon immune challenge [30]. In particular, the
Dscam repertoire in response to parasite exposure differs between bacteria and Plasmodium and between
Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum [30].
However, such specificity has so far only been observed
in studies comparing these divergent Plasmodium parasites, which probably last shared a common ancestor
around 55 million years ago [31].
The response of AgDscam transcription to P. falciparum diversity (i.e. within-species rather than betweenspecies parasite exposure) may shed light on the resolution of the innate immune system’s specificity and
dynamics, as well as its limitations. In theory, 31,920
unique splice forms of Dscam can be generated through
the alternative splicing of 84 variable exons contained
within three variable exon cassettes (these are exon 4,
exon 6, and exon 10) [30], and which could potentially
contribute to a capability to distinguish between different genotypes of Plasmodium. This capability would
imply a more specific innate immune response than previously supposed. Here, research is described that relates
P. falciparum genetic diversity to the expression characteristics of the alternatively spliced Dscam receptor in
the An. gambiae mosquito.
Two independent experiments were performed. The
first was a field study that utilized freshly harvested
blood from human subjects for which the genetic diversity of naturally acquired P. falciparum infections was
characterized. The second experiment was based in the
laboratory, where mosquitoes were exposed to either
single parasite clones or mixtures of clones contained
within human red blood cells in culture following an
established protocol [32]. AgDscam receptor diversity

was studied in two ways. First, a diversity index was calculated based on exon 4 and exon 6 frequencies to
assess whether overall AgDscam expression diversity
increased under exposure to P. falciparum parasites, and
if it increased further with greater parasite infection
diversity. Second, it was assessed whether particular
Dscam exon transcripts were associated with infection
diversities (in the field study) or particular parasite genotypes (in the laboratory study).

Methods
Mosquito infection in Kenya

Blood was obtained from primary school students in
Iguhu (34°45’E, 0°10’N) in Kakamega district, western
Kenya. The predominant malaria vector species in the
area is An. gambiae s.s. [33,34]. During and shortly after
the rainy season, children (5-14 years of age) were
screened for gametocytes by thick blood-films stained in
Giemsa’s stain.
Gametocyte carriers who had >40 gametocytes/μL of
blood and who consented to participate in the study
were asked to donate 10 mL of blood, which was
obtained intravenously by a clinician, and drawn into
heparinized tubes. A total of six gametocyte donors
were used in this study (two donors per gametocytepositive infection group). Most of this blood was used
for mosquito infections through membrane feeders, with
around 50 μL also spotted onto Whatman paper for
later DNA extraction using a Chelex-100 isolation technique [35]. Methods for infecting mosquitoes are
described in [36]. Drawn blood was immediately centrifuged at 700 × g, and the serum discarded and replaced
with human AB serum (Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD, USA). Blood was then placed in warmed
membrane feeders. Five to seven-day old Anopheles
gambiae Kisumu strain mosquitoes were placed in paper
cups at a density of 60/cup and allowed to feed on the
infected blood for 30 minutes. Mosquitoes used in this
experiment were originally obtained near the Kenya
Medical Research Institute in Kisumu [37], but had
been bred in an insectary and adapted to feed from a
membrane feeder for many years (thus the mosquitoes
were unlikely to be highly polymorphic).
A total of twenty four mosquitoes were used in the
field study (three mosquitoes per treatment × four infection groups × two independent replicates). Mosquitoes
were transferred to cages post-blood meal, and then
placed into RNAlater (Ambion) at 24-hours post-blood
meal. Mosquitoes were harvested 24-hours post-feeding
because this is the peak time that Plasmodium ookinetes
penetrate the mosquito midgut [30]. Total RNA extraction was carried out using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit.
On day 7 after they had been exposed to infected blood,
the remaining fed mosquitoes from each cage were

dissected in 2% mercurochrome and examined for

infections.

Statistical analyses

Plasmodium microsatellite typing

To estimate P. falciparum diversity, microsatellite loci
were chosen based on their strength in terms of percentage PCR positives, frequency distributions of allele
length important for sizing amplicons [38], size in basepairs [39], and allele frequencies [40]. A hemi-nested
PCR reaction was carried out to amplify six select
microsatellite loci from each DNA extraction sample
[38]. Applied Biosystems Genemapper v4.0 software was
used to automate the measurement of allele length and
to quantify peaks in samples containing multiple alleles
per locus. Only peaks from samples that amplified >200
fluorescent units were included in the deduction of
infection diversity. Multiple alleles per locus were scored
if the minor microsatellite peaks were >33% the height
of the predominant allele.
Mosquito infection in the laboratory

Five to seven-day old female An. gambiae (Keele strain)
mosquitoes were offered blood meals containing in vitro
grown gametocytes of two different genotypes of P. falciparum (clone 3D7 [41] and clone HB3 [42]) through
membrane feeders, and three whole mosquitoes per
treatment were harvested after 24-hours. Three independent experiments on three different dates were performed. A total of thirty six mosquitoes were used in
this study (three mosquitoes per treatment × four treatment groups × three independent replicates). The gametocyte culture and membrane feeding protocols followed
those previously described [32]. The isolation of total
RNA was carried out using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini technology kit.
Quantifying Dscam diversity

RNA extracted from three individual mosquitoes per
treatment was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and primers were designed to amplify a fragment of
AgDscam spanning from exon 3 to exon 7 (primer
sequences were: Forward; 5’ - GTATACGCCTGC
ATGGCTAAGA - 3’, Reverse; 5’ - GCCCTTATCCT
CCTTCTTG - 3’). Thus, the amplicons comprised variable exons 4 and 6, and the conserved exon 5. PCR
products were cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit
with pCR4-TOPO vector and transformed in chemically competent Escherichia coli. Up to 48 clones per
mosquito were sequenced in a 96-capillary ABI 3730xl
DNA Analyzer (provided by the Gene Pool Sequencing facility, University of Edinburgh). Sequences were
aligned using BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 and identified by
cross-referencing with the known An. gambiae

Diversity was measured with Simpson’s Index (1-D) [43],
which quantified the combination of expressed exon 4
and exon 6 variants in each transcript as determined by
sequencing. The presence and abundance of each individual exon, and exon 4:6 combination was identified. Statistical analysis of data using general linear modelling
and one-way analysis of variance was carried out using
Minitab 15.1.1.0 software. For the laboratory study,
‘clone’ was the single fixed effect with three levels, 3D7,
HB3 or mixture of both, and for the field study, the
number of genotypes detected (single, double or triple
infection) was a fixed effect and donor was added as a
random effect to account for variation. Data were normalized with a square root transformation of Simpson’s
Index (D) before analyses. The Neighbour-Joining trees
(additional file 1) were produced using PHYLIP and variation in counts of exon groupings were carried out
with chi-square contingency table analysis.
Ethical statement

The ethical review boards of the Kenya Medical
Research Institute, Kenya reviewed and approved our
protocol for screening of P. falciparum gametocyte carriers and subsequent intravenous blood drawing. Written, informed consent to participate in the study was
provided by all study subjects and/or their parents or
guardians (see also [36]). All gametocyte donors were
subsequently treated with amodiaquine by the clinicians
at the Iguhu Health Centre, per the guideline of the
Ministry of Health of Kenya. Feeding of mosquitoes was
conducted in a secure, insect-proof room at the Iguhu
Health Centre.

Results and Discussion
For the field study, An. gambiae were membrane-fed on
blood samples taken from gametocyte-carrying children,
and RNA was harvested from the insects 24-hours postexposure, a time when parasites are traversing the midgut epithelium [30]. cDNAs were then cloned and
sequenced to identify specific AgDscam gene variants (at
exons 4 and 6) expressed within insects fed from different blood samples. Control blood was taken from children carrying no Plasmodium (as detected with
microscopy). A set of P. falciparum microsatellite markers [38] were used to identify parasite genotypes in
gametocyte carriers. As blood samples contain whole
populations of parasites, it is not possible to precisely
estimate the number of genotypes present. However, by
simply counting alleles at each locus, it is possible to
identify the minimum number of genotypes present in a

sample, and thus the methods used yielded a lowerbound of parasite genetic diversity. Single, double and
triple infections were subsequently identified.
AgDscam expression, as characterized by a diversity
index [43] and averaged over both studied exons, was
affected by the blood that the mosquitoes fed upon in
the field (F3,20 = 3.22, P = 0.045; Figure 1). It appears
that AgDscam is more diverse when parasites are present (diversity was significantly lower in uninfected
blood controls than in all other samples; Figure 1). It is
the combined diversity at exons 4 and 6 that drive this
pattern, as a relationship between expression diversity
and parasite diversity was not apparent when the exons
were studied separately (exon 4: F1,22 = 3.33, P = 0.081;
exon 6: F 1,22 = 0.02, P = 0.901). It was interesting to
note that there was a non-statistically significant trend
for an association between exon 4 (but not exon 6)
diversity and parasite diversity. This may imply that
exon 4 has a bigger role than exon 6 in responding to
Plasmodium in the field. Additionally, AgDscam diversity was also higher when mosquitoes fed upon blood
with double infections when compared to single infections, but diversity did not rise further with triple infections (Figure 1). Thus, these field data provided only
limited evidence of a link between host response recognition capacity and parasite intraspecific diversity. As
the blood stage diversity as measured by microsatellites
could not be certain to be representative of gametocyte
diversity, i.e. it is conceivable that not all parasite types
were producing gametocytes (see [44]), a laboratorybased study was carried out using gametocyte-producing
lines of P. falciparum. In this way, the diversity of gametocytes entering the experimental mosquitoes could be
certain.

For the laboratory study, mosquitoes were membranefed on blood infected with gametocytes of either P. falciparum clone 3D7 [41] or HB3 [42], or a mixture of the
two, and RNA was harvested from the insects 24-hours
post-exposure. cDNAs were cloned and sequenced and
AgDscam exon 4 and exon 6 variants expressed were
identified within mosquitoes exposed to different treatments (control blood with no Plasmodium, clone 3D7,
clone HB3, and clones 3D7 and HB3 mixed). It was
found that AgDscam expression was affected by the
blood that the mosquitoes fed upon (F3,32 = 5.29, P =
0.004; Figure 2). Thus, as with the field study, it appears
that AgDscam is more diverse when parasites are present (diversity was significantly lower in uninfected
blood controls than in all other samples; Figure 2).
Although diversity increased under exposure to either
laboratory parasite clone, it did not increase further in
response to a mixture of the two clones (Figure 2). As
with the field data, it was the combined diversity at
exons 4 and 6 that drove this pattern, as variation in
Dscam diversity was not apparent when the exons were
studied separately (exon 4: F1,34 = 3.10, P = 0.087; exon
6: F1,34 = 0.16, P = 0.690). Again, there was some evidence of a trend for exon 4 but not exon 6, as previously seen in the field study, implying that the
variability rendered by exon 4 in responding to Plasmodium may be relatively more important than the variability offered by exon 6 expression.
A c2 analysis was used to identify whether particular
splice variants were over- or under-represented in any
of the field (control, single, double or triple) or laboratory (control, clone 3D7, clone HB3, mixed) infections.
Because the extreme splice variation leads to very low

counts for individual exons, exon variants were grouped
into categories based on their genetic distance. Although
this grouping may not reflect any relationship between
biological function and antigen recognition similarity,
varying the cut-off points did not change the qualitative
results. Based on a Neighbour-Joining (NJ) tree (exon 4,
see additional file 1; exon 6, see additional file 1),
genetic groupings of exon variants were defined such
that exon 4 variants were clustered into 3 groups (see
additional file 1), and exon 6 into 3 groups also (see
additional file 1).
c2 contingency tests were used to determine whether
the number of observations (counts) of each group differed between the infection categories (see additional
file 2 for raw data). In general, no exons were over- or
under-represented in any particular infection grouping
in either the field or laboratory experiments. The only
exceptions to this were exon 4 variants 4.11, 4.12 and
4.13 which are clearly a distinct genetic grouping (see
additional file 1), and were under-represented in control
mosquitoes compared to exposed treatments in the field
(Pearson’s Chi-Square = 6.318, DF = 2, P = 0.042), and
exon 6 variants 6.1 and 6.9 which are also a distinct
genetic grouping (see additional file 1), and were underrepresented in control mosquitoes, but also over-represented in mosquitoes exposed to a single genotype of P.
falciparum in the field (Pearson Chi-Square = 19.975,
DF = 6, P-Value = 0.003). These data suggests that exon
4 variants 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13, and exon 6 variants 6.1
and 6.9, may be particularly important for the mosquito’s immune response to Plasmodium in the field.

Conclusion
The results show an increase in AgDscam splice-form
diversity at 24-hours post-exposure, when the parasites
are crossing the insect’s midgut epithelium [30,45,46].
This observation, confirmed both in the field and the
laboratory, reinforce that the AgDscam receptor
responds to Plasmodium at a vital stage for the parasite’s development. The limited association between
AgDscam diversity and P. falciparum genotype-diversity
in the field raises the possibility that the alternativelyspliced receptor could be responding to P. falciparum
diversity. This observation, however, was not seen
between double- and triple-exposed treatments.
Although it cannot be assumed that every parasite genotype detected in the blood samples in the field is represented in the sexual stage, there is an apparent
consistency in the results showing a lack of genotypespecific Dscam expression diversity following two different experimental approaches (field and laboratory).
Naturally, the field data may also be affected by unmeasured factors, for example some of the blood samples
could conceivably have harboured other parasite species.

This possibility was investigated using PCR detection for
other Plasmodium parasites (specifically Plasmodium
malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax),
and the presence of P. malariae in both of the blood
samples containing a single genotype of P. falciparum
was recorded (see additional file 3). Consequently, the
single infections were confounded with multi-species
infections, and yet AgDscam diversity of these multispecies exposures was lower than the diversity levels of
the double and triple P. falciparum exposures. Although
even higher Dscam expression diversity could be
expected in this instance, this was not observed, and
thus other interpretations are possible depending on
whether one species has a stronger influence on Dscam
expression within a particular multiple-infection than
another. It was also interesting to note that the overrepresentation of the group of exon 6 variants (variants
6.1 and 6.9) found in these multi-species infections was
not found in the single-species infections, implying that
these variants could be influenced by the presence of P.
malariae. The significance of these observations remains
to be investigated. It was also determined whether P.
falciparum infection intensity in the blood samples, i.e.
abundance of parasite stages (as determined by quantitative PCR), could have affected our results, but we found
no relationship between parasite abundance and Dscam
diversity (see additional file 3). Finally, future studies
may benefit from the use of multiple mosquito genotypes. It is possible that different genotypes may respond
differently to the same parasite challenge in terms of
AgDscam expression. This may be a logical direction for
future work as the relative absence of related studies on
AgDscam allows little speculation on whether the colonies used in this study would be a good proxy for what
can be expected in natural populations. Thus, in summary, the data clearly indicate that AgDscam diversity
increases with parasite exposure, but they do not suggest that AgDscam diversity rises further in response to
increased parasite diversity.
