Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genome sequence analysis is critical to the diagnostic evaluation of mitochondrial
disease. Existing methodologies differ widely in throughput, complexity, cost efficiency, and sensitivity of
heteroplasmy detection. Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0, which uses a sequencing-by-genotyping technology, allows
potentially accurate and high-throughput sequencing of the entire human mitochondrial genome to be
completed in a cost-effective fashion. However, the relatively low call rate achieved using existing software tools
has limited the wide adoption of this platform for either clinical or research applications. Here, we report the
design and development of a custom bioinformatics software pipeline that achieves a much improved call rate
and accuracy for the Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0 platform. We used this custom pipeline to analyze MitoChip v2.0
data from 24 DNA samples representing a broad range of tissue types (18 whole blood, 3 skeletal muscle, 3 cell
lines), mutations (a 5.8 kilobase pair deletion and 6 known heteroplasmic mutations), and haplogroup origins. All
results were compared to those obtained by at least one other mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis method,
including Sanger sequencing, denaturing HPLC-based heteroduplex analysis, and/or the Illumina Genome Analyzer
II next generation sequencing platform.
Results: An average call rate of 99.75% was achieved across all samples with our custom pipeline. Comparison
of calls for 15 samples characterized previously by Sanger sequencing revealed a total of 29 discordant calls,
which translates to an estimated 0.012% for the base call error rate. We successfully identified 4 known
heteroplasmic mutations and 24 other potential heteroplasmic mutations across 20 samples that passed quality
control.
Conclusions: Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0 analysis using our optimized MitoChip Filtering Protocol (MFP)
bioinformatics pipeline now offers the high sensitivity and accuracy needed for reliable, high-throughput and costefficient whole mitochondrial genome sequencing. This approach provides a viable alternative of potential utility
for both clinical diagnostic and research applications to traditional Sanger and other emerging sequencing
technologies for whole mitochondrial genome analysis.

Background
MitoChip is an array-based platform that was first
developed by Maitra et al (2004), in collaboration with
Affymetrix, to sequence the entire human mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) coding region (15,451 base pairs (bp))
[1]. Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized in situ and
tiled over each coding position of both strands to interrogate its base composition. The subsequent version,
MitoChip v.2.0, has expanded coverage across the entire
human mitochondrial genome by adding redundant
probes that target the most common haplotypes in the
highly variable control region [2]. In their original
paper, Zhou et al (2006) showed a very high reproducibility (>99.99%) of base calls for MitoChip v.2.0, with an
average call rate of 94.6% (ranging from 89.2 to 96.8%).
While the reproducibility and accuracy were impressive,
the call rate they achieved was suboptimal for clinical
diagnostic purposes. This finding alone has limited the
wide adoption of MitoChip v.2.0, such that traditional
Sanger sequencing and emerging Next Generation
Sequencing technologies are typically preferred in a clinical diagnostic setting, despite their inherently higher
cost and slower turn-around time.
Affymetrix GSEQ 4.1, which uses the Zhou et al.
(2006) algorithm that was first implemented in RA tools
[3], is the most commonly used software tool for analyzing MitoChip v2.0 data. Base calling with default settings in GSEQ 4.1 can achieve a call rate and accuracy
in excess of 90% and 99.9%, respectively http://www.
affymetrix.com. Several studies have shown that both
metrics can be improved by varying several parameters,
and that additional information can be obtained from
redundant probes on the array. Most notably, an average
call rate of 99.48% and accuracy of 99.98% were
achieved in a comparative study [4] that used a set of
bioinformatics filters developed by Pandya et al. [5].
Other efforts to develop an improved bioinformatics
analysis pipeline for MitoChip v2.0 have met with only
limited success. For example, in the method developed
by Hartmann et al. [4], the call rate was improved by
using the probe intensity values of redundant probes. A
base call was determined when the ratio of the highest
probe set signal intensity to background noise exceeded
an empirically determined cutoff value. Unfortunately,
this approach may improve the call rate without necessarily improving accuracy, and is more subject to batch
effect when the background noise levels differ between
sample sets.
Several additional challenges have limited the clinical
utility of mtDNA sequence analysis using the MitoChip
v2.0 platform. The first challenge is the detection of
insertions or deletions (indels), particularly in regions
known to have such variants. At present, the GSEQ 4.1
algorithm provides no explicit way to detect indels. A

Page 2 of 16

second challenge is an apparent lack of sensitivity and
specificity to detect and report heteroplasmy. Since
pathogenic mtDNA mutations may only be present in
certain tissues and/or at certain percentage loads [6],
the accurate detection and assessment of heteroplasmy
levels are imperative to understand disease diagnosis
and prognosis [7]. While the Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0
platform has the potential to detect heteroplasmy with
great sensitivity [1], GSEQ 4.1 does not provide an efficient method for making accurate heteroplasmy calls
[4]. A third challenge is the lack of a robust quality
metric, as no measurement accurately captures the overall quality of each MitoChip data set. Call rate offers one
reflection of robustness but can be misleading if used as
the sole parameter of sample quality, since it is subject
to influence not only by technical factors but also by
biological factors such as the presence of indels. A final
challenge is the absence of a base call summary method
at regions of common variation that are captured by
multiple probes placed on MitoChip v2.0.
Here, we describe the development and implementation of a custom bioinformatics pipeline that addresses
these challenges. We assessed and validated the effectiveness of this pipeline using a carefully selected set of
mtDNA samples. Our pipeline improves MitoChip v2.0
call rate without sacrificing accuracy and, at the same
time, provides an effective means for assessing data
quality, detecting large indels, and systematically identifying heteroplasmic mtDNA variants.

Implementation
We designed and developed a customized bioinformatics
pipeline, MitoChip Filtering Protocol (MFP), to analyze
mtDNA sequence data generated by Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0 (Figure 1). The methods and algorithms used
in the study were implemented as MATLAB code that
is publicly available at MATLAB Central file exchange
using the keyword “MFP” http://www.mathworks.com/
matlabcentral/fileexchange/ (Additional File 1).
DNA Sample Description

A total of 24 human mtDNA samples were studied
(Table 1). These DNA samples were extracted by standard techniques from whole blood (18 samples), skeletal
muscle (3 samples), or cell lines (3 samples). Two of the
DNA samples were extracted from different tissues of
the same individual that had variable heteroplasmy loads
(samples #7 and #8 from muscle and whole blood,
respectively). Eighteen of the samples were previously
sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing on a
clinical basis at either the Baylor Mitochondrial Laboratory (8 samples by whole mtDNA genome sequence
analysis) or on a research basis by the authors (10 samples), following the methods of Palanichamy et al. [8].

reference sequence (hg18) including the mitochondrial
genome allowing up to 2 mismatches. All reads that did
not align or aligned to mtDNA (chrM) and had fewer
than 5 alignments at 0, 1, and 2 mismatches were
selected. This step yielded 6,673,682 mtDNA candidate
reads. These reads were assembled using Velvet (0.7.31
PMID 18349386) with an overlap setting of 31. Velvet
produced 57 contigs, which were aligned to the hg18
‘chrM’ using fasta35 to assess coverage. A consensus
sequence was also generated with MAQ (easyrun mode
v0.7.1 http://maq.sourceforge.net/) using the same set of
input sequences and the hg18 chrM sequence as a
reference.
GSEQ 4.1 Analysis

Two other samples had previously been studied only
with a common mtDNA point mutation panel at Baylor
Mitochondrial Laboratory (samples #1 and #2). Three
additional samples were previously analyzed by denaturing HPLC-based heteroduplex analysis on a clinical
basis at Transgenomics Laboratory (samples #3, #4, and
#5). The last sample (#15) was previously processed
using Illumina Genome Analyzer II at the University of
Pennsylvania. Known pathogenic mutations in this data
set included a five kilobase (kb) pair deletion (#14), and
six known heteroplasmic mutations (#2, #6, #8, #17,
#18, and #21). Samples #16 through #24 were selected
to represent a wide range of common and rare mtDNA
haplogroups (V7, H11, U4a1, D5a, J1c2, T1a, U4b3, and
D5c). A total of 5 muscle DNA samples previously analyzed by Sanger sequencing were used as an independent, validation data set.
MitoChip v2.0 Sequencing

All 24 DNA samples detailed in Table 1 were processed
in the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia using the Affymetrix GeneChip
Human mitochondrial resequencing array version 2.0
(MitoChip v2.0) per standard Affymetrix protocol [2].
Illumina Genome Analyzer II Sequencing

The mtDNA library for Sample #15 was sequenced to
36 bp (single end) using an Illumina Genome Analyzer
II. The resulting 9,760,673 reads were aligned using
ELAND (pipeline version 1.30) to the human genome

RAW data (cel files) of the 24 MitoChip v2.0 data sets
were initially processed with GSEQ 4.1 software using
both diploid and haploid models. All default parameters
were used with the exception of the quality score
threshold, which was set at 3 rather than the default setting of 12 to optimize sensitivity and specificity [4]. Base
calls were made for each sample and position, which
included “A”, “C”, “G”, and “T”. “N” was used to indicate when no base call could be confidently made
because the quality score was below 3. Aside from base
calls, the sequences and intensities of each probe were
exported and analyzed for additional base and heteroplasmy calls.

Results
Quality control (QC) analyses

The call rate of a genotyping array is generally considered to be a good indicator of data quality but can
potentially be misleading when influenced by technical
factors or biological contributions such as pathogenic
indels. In addition, using a threshold by which to identify poor quality samples can be subjective. Therefore,
we devised a procedure that used call rate and base call
quality correlation coefficient to identify potentially problematic samples. The generalized extreme studentized
deviate (GSD) many-outlier method was then applied in
the following manner to eliminate any outliers that had
poor data quality [9]. First, we plotted the quality score
distribution of all bases for each of the 24 DNA samples
(Figure 2). As expected, quality scores were normally
distributed for all samples except for the one that had a
known 5-kb deletion (#14). While a large number of
bases in this sample had the lowest quality score, the
remaining bases in this sample appeared to have normally distributed quality scores. This observation correlated with the large mtDNA deletion known to be
present in the sample.
Next, correlation coefficients of quality scores between
different samples were analyzed (Figure 3). While it was

13 clinical samples and 11 research samples were analyzed by MitoChip v2.0. Tissue origin, comparative mtDNA genome sequencing methodologies, unique or pathogenic features that characterize particular
samples based on a priori sequencing knowledge, variant heteroplasmy levels, as well as MitoChip performance in terms of ability to detect known variants and the call rate achieved using MitoChip Filtering
Protocol (MFP) are detailed. The ‘mtDNA haplogroup’ column details the manually curated haplogroup based on full sequence analysis for each sample. ‘MitoSNP predicted haplogroup’ was based on a subset of 22
mtDNA positions and generally agreed with manual curation, with the exception of haplogroups B, K, and D that were not properly identified by MitoSNP prediction. &, muscle and blood samples originated from
the same subject.

expected that sample #14 would correlate poorly with
other samples due to its large deletion, three additional
samples (#4, #17, and #18) showed similar evidence of
poor correlation. Thus, correlation coefficient analysis
was strongly indicative of the overall poor quality of
these four samples. Additionally, while their overall
quality score distributions were similar to that of other
samples, peaks at low-quality ends could clearly be seen
for these samples, albeit to a much lesser degree compared to sample #14.
Finally, the mean quality score across all samples for
each probe was used as the baseline for purposes of
computing the sum of square of the difference between
each sample and the baseline (Figure 4). As before, samples #4, #14, #17, and #18 were found to be outliers
from the remaining twenty samples. Call rates for those
samples originally made using a quality score cutoff of 3
in GSEQ were all below 97% and represented a clear
departure from the remaining samples that had call

rates of approximately 99%. This observation supported
the interpretation that these samples were problematic
and should not be included in downstream analyses.
The atypical nature of sample #14 became more evident when the average quality score was plotted across
its mtDNA genome using a 25 bp moving window for
all samples. In this analysis, samples with a deletion or
insertion were expected to show a significant dip in the
plot at the corresponding genomic region. Indeed, this
is exactly what was seen for sample #14 (Figure 5).
While the rest of that sample’s mitochondrial genome
behaved similarly to the other study samples in terms of
the distribution of mean quality scores, consecutive
stretches ranging from nucleotide positions (np) 10152
to 15945 had extremely low quality scores (Figure 5a,
top panel). A continuous and significant drop of the
highest probe intensity was also seen across the same
region using a 25 bp moving window (Figure 5a, bottom
panel). The pattern became more obvious when the

Figure 4 Residual sum of squares (RSS) plot for all 24 samples.
Using the mean quality score across all samples for each probe as
the baseline, the sum of squares of the difference between quality
score for each sample and the baseline was determined. Samples
#4, #14, #17, and #18 were outliers as had been shown by the
generalized extreme studentized deviate (GSD) many-outlier
procedure performed in Figure 2 [9].

The large 5791 bp deletion in sample #14 located
between np 10154 and 15945 had previously been identified by Sanger sequencing. This result indicated that
precise structural variants can be reliably detected and
defined from MitoChip data simply by plotting either
the average probe quality scores or the highest probe
intensity values. Break-point determination with this
approach was also highly accurate, as coordinates of the
predicted deletion only differed by 2 bp on one side.
This result supported the feasibility of detecting at least
large size deletions using a moving window approach.
At the same time, our failure to detect a 2 bp AC deletion in the control region of sample #15 demonstrated
the limitation of this method for identifying structural
variants at finer resolution. Unfortunately, a series of

samples with indels of different sizes were not included
in the study samples to permit experimental determination of this method’s sensitivity.
However, we did explore a computational approach to
predict the estimated size of structural variation that
could potentially be detected by our moving window
approach, (Additional File 2). We started by developing
a statistically rigorous measure of a deletion, rather than
using visual inspection alone (as illustrated in Figure 5),
that involved grouping and collectively assessing the
quality scores from all samples having no known deletions. A quality score that was 3 standard deviations
below the mean was chosen as the cutoff. If the average
quality score of a stretch of consecutive bases fell below
this cutoff, this segment was deemed to be deleted. In
our set of samples, the cutoff value was determined to
be 14.86, which allowed us to determine that the deletion in sample #14 was located from np 10154 to 15943.

Because of the lack of samples with various sizes of
deletions, we estimated the sensitivity of our method
using simulation tests. Briefly, we first randomly chose a
segment of a given size from the known deletion of
sample #14 and used its data to replace those of a segment of the same size randomly chosen from another
sample. We then applied our method to assess whether
or not this segment was detected as a deletion. As seen
in Additional File 2A, deletions that were 25 bp or
longer could be clearly detected. Deletions that were
smaller than 25 bp in length could still be detected but
with increasing difficulty as their size decreased (Additional File 2B). To quantify the sensitivity of our method
for deletions 2-24 bp in length, we repeated 200 simulations for each given size using the global cutoff value of
14.86 as described before. The fraction of times that we
could detect the deletion was estimated as the sensitivity
of our method. As shown in Additional File 2C, the

Xie et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:402
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/402

sensitivity was as high as 90% for deletions of 18 bp or
larger, but as low as 20% for deletions of 10 bp or
shorter.
Limitations to base call rate in GSEQ 4.1

GSEQ 4.1 sets the default quality score cutoff at 12.
When keeping all other parameters at default values but
lowering the quality score cutoff to 3, an average call
rate of 99.0% was achieved for the 20 samples having
consistently high quality scores. The call rate for those
20 samples ranged from 98.3% to 99.3% with a standard
deviation of 0.22%, which is still not high enough to
consistently satisfy the rigorous requirements of clinical
diagnostic applications. While the call rate could be
improved by further lowering the quality score setting,
this would also increase erroneous base calls. Thus, it
was evident that a method was needed to improve the
call rate without sacrificing accuracy.
Incorporating intensity values to improve call rate

GSEQ 4.1 software uses the quality score as the sole
threshold by which to determine base calls. This standard leads to greater confidence being placed on base
calls with higher quality scores. However, we found
that quality score was highly correlated between samples, where certain loci had proportionally lower quality scores than did others. Therefore, relying solely on
quality scores to determine base calls may diminish
call rates for certain regions of the mitochondrial
genome.
To further improve call rate, we incorporated into our
pipeline an advanced analysis of intensity values that
were determined in GSEQ 4.1 software. Rather than
simply taking the probe with the highest intensity value
at a given position, a call was made if the probe that
had the highest intensity of all probes significantly
exceeded background noise. While many approaches
can estimate background noise, the second highest
intensity value from both strands was used to provide
conservative noise estimations. The ratio between the
highest and second highest intensity values from both
strands was used to measure confidence in generating
additional base calls. A threshold was selected based on
our statistical analysis of the ratio distribution.
Sample #14, which contained the large 5.8 kb deletion,
provided a good measure of signal to noise ratio reliability based on thousands of data points, since the signals
from deleted loci could all be considered as noise. The
ratios of the deleted bases in this sample were closely
analyzed (Additional File 3). The median plus four times
the standard deviation of the inter-quartile value (1.26)
was chosen as the threshold to differentiate outliers or
true signals from pure noise. For all other samples,
bases with non-calls ("N”) were reexamined. If the

Page 9 of 16

signal-to-noise ratio exceeded 1.26, then a call was
made according to the probe with the highest signal.
Otherwise, the non-calls remained as they had initially
been defined. In addition, any single nucleotide variant
(SNV) calls having a quality score below 12 were converted to “N”. Our revised analytical method was then
applied to SNV calls across the entire mitochondrial
sequence of each sample, where any probe having the
highest to second highest signal intensity ratio less than
1.26 were converted into non-calls.
Analysis of base calls in common variable regions

Affymetrix MitoChip is a sequencing-by-genotyping
technology. It relies upon the signal intensities of a set
of 25-mer probes that hybridize to the DNA sample and
specifically interrogate the base composition at the position corresponding to the 13th position of these probes.
Its performance is complicated by the existence of many
common mtDNA sequence variants, especially in the
control region. Probes that do not match perfectly with
the DNA sample at the bases beside the 13th position
could therefore potentially lead to ambiguous calls or
non-calls. To address this problem, redundant probes
were tiled over the common variable regions on the
Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0. Details of the design can be
obtained from the Affymetrix website http://www.affymetrix.com. Unfortunately, GSEQ 4.1 does not provide
an effective and integrated way to use these data.
An algorithm called ReseqChip was recently developed
to improve the call rate in these regions [10], but uses
very complex methodologies to do so. We employed a
similar but much simpler scheme. For a given position
in a polymorphic region, all base calls for all probes having a quality score above 3 were collected and a majority
vote was used as the final base call. In cases when two
different base calls had an equal number of votes, a
rank sum test of their quality score was examined. If the
resulting p-value was less than 0.05, then the base call
with the higher average quality score was chosen as the
final base call. Bases with a p-value higher than 0.05
were further examined for potential heteroplasmy.
Combined improvement in call rate achieved using MFP

All of the above-mentioned methods were integrated
into a single MitoChip data analysis pipeline, which we
called the MitoChip Filtering Protocol (MFP). Significant improvement in the call rate was obtained in MFP
relative to that generated in GSEQ 4.1 (Figure 6). For
the 20 samples that passed our QC filtering and did not
have a large deletion, the average call rate achieved was
99.75% (range: 99.4-99.8%). By contrast, the average call
rate for the same data sets using GSEQ 4.1 by itself was
99% (range: 98.3%-99.3%). Interestingly, different magnitudes of improvement in call rate were seen in different

gene regions for different samples (Figure 7). As
expected, significant improvement was seen in all samples in the control region attributable to the improved
use in MFP of redundant control region probes.
Accuracy of base calls generated using MFP

To assess the accuracy of base calls generated in MFP,
we compared calls for 14 samples that had previously
been analyzed by either Sanger or Illumina GAII next
generation sequencing. A summary of the variant results
by sample is provided in Table 2. On average, we
observed two discordant base calls per sample, which
translates to approximately 99.99% concordance rate
between MFP-analyzed MitoChip v2.0 data and traditional Sanger (or Illumina GAII) whole mtDNA genome
sequencing methods. This calculation was based on the
ability of MitoChip v2.0 to interrogate only 16,544 of
16,569 bp of the mtDNA genome.
The discordant base calls were closely examined
(Additional File 4). MitoChip v2.0 data had high quality
scores (≥12) using GSEQ 4.1 analysis for eight of the
discordant bases that occurred at one of three nucleotide positions in the HVS1: 16360 (#19, #20), 16362 (#7,
#19, #20, #24), and 16356 (#18, #23). We are confident
that the 16362 and 16356 polymorphisms are present (i.
e., they are not errors created during Sanger sequencing)
because they are phylogenetically diagnostic mutations
for the samples’ respective haplogroups. Thus, these

polymorphisms were clearly missed by MitoChip. Extra
calls by MitoChip that were not seen in Sanger
sequences or the NGS sequence were also noted. Six of
the 14 mutations occur near known polymorphisms.
Most of these mutations also involved unusual transversions. One of these transversions was found in two samples that belonged to two different mtDNA haplogroups
(U4 and H), further suggesting that an error occurred in
the MitoChip read.
The percentage of no-calls at cytosine (c) positions
was consistently high across all samples (Additional File
4), as was similarly reported in prior studies [1,9,11].
Rates of “no-calls” were not linked to the mutational
aspect of any specific haplogroup. In other words, there
was no bias in mutation ascertainment towards phylogenetically older or younger haplogroups relative to one
another. In addition, the majority of the extra calls
appeared as atypical transversions, with many being
adjacent to or near real polymorphisms.
We noted a high percentage of discordant calls for
two samples (#17 and #18) relative to other mtDNAs in
the sample set (Additional File 4). This difference may
reflect the fact that they were the first samples that
were processed and analyzed using MitoChip 2.0 in our
data set. In spite of this problem, nearly all of the polymorphisms identified in the samples through Sanger
sequencing were also detected by MitoChip 2.0, with
most of the observed discrepancies being extra calls

made by MitoChip 2.0. These results indicate that DNA
samples collected 1-2 decades ago, such as #17 and #18,
are amenable to sequence analysis with the MitoChip
2.0 and can produce very high call rates, despite their
being of possibly slightly lower quality than recently collected samples.

Therefore, we devised a mathematical approach to utilize the intensity values of multiple samples for purposes
of detecting heteroplasmic sites. A ratio of intensity
values at each position of a given sample was calculated
as detailed in Equation 1:
intensitynew,i = log

Improved sensitivity for heteroplasmy detection using
MFP

A potential advantage of Affymetrix MitoChip array
technology over Sanger sequencing technology is its
higher sensitivity for heteroplasmy detection [1]. Since
the heteroplasmy calls in GSEQ 4.1 often appeared to
be questionable, as suggested by other studies [4], we
developed our own statistical method for heteroplasmy
detection. Intensity patterns of typical heteroplasmic
sites are illustrated in Figure 8. The highest and second
highest intensity values are close to each other but significantly differ from the other potential base calls.
Importantly, we observed a high degree of correlation
among probe intensities across different samples at the
same position.

where i is the base position of interrogation. This
equation measures the relative difference between the
highest and second highest intensity value as compared
to the second highest and lowest intensity value. At a
heteroplasmic position, the second highest intensity
would be much closer to the highest intensity but much
more distant from the lowest intensity. Such ratios follow a bell-shaped distribution pattern, where extreme
values to the left side of the distribution are suggestive
of heteroplasmic loci.
To further eliminate false positive heteroplasmy
detection, a four-step method was applied. First, since
a true heteroplasmic site was assumed to have an
extreme value both within a sample and across all

Discrepant calls between MitoChip v2.0 using our custom MFP bioinformatics
algorithm are summarized for each of the 15 study samples for which full
mtDNA genome sequencing had been previously performed (samples #14,
#17 and #18 were excluded from this comparative analysis due to consistent
findings of poor sample quality on multiple analyses). Total number of
discrepant calls is detailed, with numbers in parentheses specifying calls
missed by MFP-based MitoChip analysis that had been made by standard
sequencing, as well as the extra calls made by MFP-based MitoChip analysis
that had not been detected by standard sequencing. The specific discordant
variants from each sample are catalogued in Additional File 4.

samples, three standard deviations was used as a cutoff
threshold. Second, any positions for which two different bases had the highest intensities on forward and
reverse strands were filtered out. Third, potential false
positives were filtered out using the base calls from
GSEQ 4.1 that were made with either a diploid or haploid model. Calls were considered to be “real” only if
the base calls were different using different models at
a given base, which was another indication of a potential heteroplasmic site. Finally, we eliminated any

heteroplasmic calls detected immediately adjacent to
another detected SNP, since those heteroplasmic bases
appeared to be false positives caused by neighboring
positions to an imperfect match.
We applied this method to the 20 samples that passed
quality control parameters to detect a total of 28 heteroplasmic sites in these samples, including four that had
been previously identified by Sanger sequencing. We
also assessed heteroplasmy calls with default GSEQ 4.1
settings for the same 20 samples. Of these variants, two
of the six heteroplasmic loci identified by Sanger
sequencing were missed by GSEQ 4.1. Sample #15 was
sequenced using GAII with single-end 36 bp reads to
provide an average 375X depth of coverage, which
allowed for validation of some additional heteroplasmy
calls that we had made in MFP. For this sample, GSEQ
4.1 detected one heteroplasmic mutation at np 3433.
Examining the GAII sequence alignment using Tablet
[12], we did not find any supporting evidence for this
site being heteroplasmic, as it appeared to be entirely
homozygous for thymine ("T”) (Additional File 5). By
contrast, our pipeline identified two potentially heteroplasmic loci from the same sample at np 15940 and
15944, which were supported by the GAII data (Additional File 6). Collectively, these results suggest that our
MFP method for detecting heteroplasmy has a higher
sensitivity and specificity than does GSEQ 4.1 alone
(Figure 9). However, more extensive validation of the
capability of MFP to detect heteroplasmy needs to be
conducted, ideally using a next-generation sequencing
technology for comparison.
Heteroplasmy load quantitation using MFP

The heteroplasmy level at a given locus can be estimated using relative intensity ratios. For a detected heteroplasmic position, we first determined the relative
ratio of two alleles and then calculated a product average of the two ratios, as per Equation 2:

(yellow highlight) on both forward (left panel) and reverse (right panel) strands that had been originally demonstrated by Sanger sequencing.
The peak at each position corresponds to the signal intensity of one of 4 probes (A,C,G,T) in a probe set.

where i is heteroplasmy loci, and intensityallele k, i,
the intensity value of allele k at

Using this method, we estimated that the heteroplasmy
levels for the A3243G mutation in sample #2 and for
the C5049T mutation in sample #6 were 63% and 40%,
respectively. Sanger sequencing followed by allele refractory mutation system (ARMS) based quantitative PCR
[13] estimated the heteroplasmy mutation load for
A3243G at 84% in sample #2. Heteroplasmy at the
C5049T position was identified by Sanger sequencing
but not further quantified in sample #6. Interestingly,
MFP analysis identified heteroplasmy at np 5537 and
5538 for sample #9, which was reported to have an
inserted thymine ("T”) between these exact positions
through Sanger sequencing. MFP-based MitoChip v2.0
analysis also detected similar heteroplasmy levels as estimated by Sanger sequencing alone or with ARMS
qPCR, with these heteroplasmy loads being between
30% and 84%, respectively (Table 3). However, a heteroplasmic variant identified by Sanger sequencing in sample #18 at an estimated 25% heteroplasmy level was not
identified by MFP analysis.

MitoChip v2.0 data are detailed in Additional File 7.
Overall, the MFP-based analysis of MitoChip v2.0
results closely matched those generated by Sanger
sequencing, with an average of 1 base call error per
sample being observed. It was noteworthy that the same
base call discrepancy (A12307G) accounted for 3 of the
5 total SNP discrepancies identified across all five samples (Additional File 7C). The three samples affected all
belong to mitochondrial haplogroup U, which has an
A12308G change compared to the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence (Additional File 7D). These results
highlight the limitations with MitoChip v2.0 design at a
few individual loci, but further support the utility of the
MFP pipeline to provide superior overall accuracy and
call rate.

Discussion
The Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0 resequencing array provides a relatively fast, high-throughput, cost-effective,
and sensitive method for detecting both homoplasmic
and heteroplasmic mutations across the entire human
mitochondrial DNA genome. The costs for each MitoChip v2.0 array and reagents (currently estimated at less
than $200/sample) are lower than any other commercially available mitochondrial DNA sequencing methodology. Furthermore, under a week is needed to
sequence and analyze MitoChip v2.0 data using the
MFP pipeline. By contrast, the current cost of sequencing the whole mitochondrial genome using Sanger
sequencing or more recently available NGS platforms
typically exceeds $2,000 per sample at a clinical diagnostic laboratory, and can take up to two months to obtain
analyzed results. Furthermore, while GSEQ 4.1 is a standard software package designed to analyze MitoChip
v2.0 data, it provides less than the desirable call rates
necessary for clinical diagnostic applications in suspected mitochondrial disease.
In this study, we systematically analyzed the MitoChip
v2.0 data from 24 carefully selected samples with a
number of statistical methods. The outcome was the
development of a custom pipeline, MFP, that significant
improved the call rate and accuracy relative to GSEQ
4.1. With an average call rate of 99.75% across the entire
genome and an estimated accuracy of 99.98%, MitoChip
v2.0 analysis with the MFP bioinformatics pipeline can
now be viewed as a viable and highly attractive alternative to Sanger sequencing.
A distinct advantage of Sanger sequencing over MitoChip v2.0 has been its ability to detect and precisely
determine the breakpoints of indels of any size. In this
study, we showed that, while indels of a few base pairs
in size are still difficult to detect with MitoChip v2.0,
deletions larger than 10 bp should be fairly straightforward to detect and precisely define. It is not clear

Sample #2, #6, #8, and #21 had heteroplasmic variants detected both by Sanger sequencing and MFP analysis of MitoChip v2.0 data. Of interest, the
5537_5538insT in tRNA-TRP identified by Sanger sequencing in sample #9 was interpreted in MFP as a heteroplasmic mutation at both positions 5537 and 5538.
Although a heteroplasmic A1709G site was detected by Sanger sequencing in sample #18, this sample was excluded from MFP analysis due to poor sample
quality. “N.D.” = not determined.

whether the oligos in the Mitochip v2.0 can be further
modified to detect smaller indels in mtDNA samples.
Since the MitoChip v2.0 platform was designed based
on the revised Cambridge reference sequence that
belong to mitochondrial haplogroup H [14,15], it has
been suggested that MitoChip analysis would not reliably detect sequence variants from more divergent haplogroups, such as L0 [16]. As shown in Table 1, the 24
study samples analyzed here originate from a number of
diverse haplogroups. If the data set passed QC control
parameters, then a desirable call rate could be readily
achieved in all cases. These data satisfactorily address
concerns about the potential lack of sequence identification of the probes for divergent or rare mitochondrial
DNA lineages.
While haplogroup origins could be precisely determined
based on our manual curation of the MFP-determined
mtDNA genome sequence, we note that implementation
in MFP of an automated algorithm that relies solely upon
a panel of 22 SNPs to assign haplogroup [17] failed to permit the accurate assignment of B (sample #3) or D5 haplogroups (samples #19, #20, #24). The haplogroup for
sample #14 that had a 5.8 kb deletion was also understandably misassigned, as several of the haplogroup-defining variants for this sample (which belongs to haplogroup
K) fell in the deleted region of this sample. Thus, haplogroup assignment can be readily made with MFP but
must be viewed with caution if based on the 22 common
SNP panel used here or if the sample harbors a large deletion. However, the use of an expanded set of SNPs representing a wide range of phylogenetically important
markers from a global set of haplogroups will likely rectify
these kinds of misassignments.
Another potential advantage of MitoChip v2.0 analysis
over Sanger sequencing is its potential to more sensitively
detect heteroplasmy. However, failure to exploit the data
captured on MitoChip v2.0 relative to heteroplasmy
detection and quantitation appears to be attributable to a
limitation of the current GSEQ 4.1 and other software.

This same problem has been noted in previous studies
employing the MitoChip v2.0 [4]. While we were able to
use MFP to detect 6 confirmed heteroplasmic bases (4
consistent with Sanger sequencing and 2 consistent with
Illumina GAII), more extensive validation results are
needed to determine the conditions that must be met to
consistently achieve those calls across the mtDNA genome. MFP analysis did detect two potentially low-level
heteroplasmic mutations in sample #15 at np 15940 and
15944, which were supported by deep sequencing data
(Additional File 6). This result suggests that MFP can
potentially make robust and accurate heteroplasmy calls.
Any array-based sequencing technology has inherent
limitations that cannot be fully addressed by statistical
or informatic means. Aside from the difficulty of detecting small indels, as mentioned above, another important
issue is the reliable and consistent detection of very low
levels of heteroplasmy. As newer technologies emerge,
superior heteroplasmy detection will be achieved. In this
regard, next-generation sequencing technologies offer
enormous depth of coverage for the mitochondrial genome such that point mutations, small indels and low
levels of heteroplasmy (at least 5%-10%) can be reliably
and quantitatively detected [18-20].
Yet, current next-generation sequencing technologies
are not without their own limitations. For example, such
technologies are still relatively expensive in terms of
equipment, reagents, and labor costs. Furthermore, they
are high-throughput technologies only in terms of the
amount of sequence data that they generate per run, but
not in terms of the number of samples that can be individually processed at the same time. In contrast to NGS
methods, MitoChip v2.0 analysis can be run on individual samples without having to accumulate a sufficient
number of samples to batch analyze them.

Conclusions
In summary, we conclude that MFP-based analysis of
MitoChip v2.0 data provides a highly attractive option

Xie et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:402
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/402

for both clinical diagnostic applications as well as
research-based evaluation of the human mitochondrial
DNA genome. The custom MFP bioinformatics pipeline
reported here performs with consistently high call rate
and accuracy, provides improved metrics to assess sample quality control, permits improved detection of the
occurrence of both large deletions and heteroplasmic
variants, and performs consistently well in samples of
diverse haplogroup origins. With the bioinformatics
algorithm improvements described here that we incorporated into a single MFP pipeline, MitoChip v2.0 analysis can now provide a fast, cost-effective, flexible, and
truly high-throughput way of achieving comparable or
higher accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing in the
evaluation of a large number of individuals for potential
pathogenic mutations throughout the mitochondrial
genome.

Authors’ contributions
MJF, XG, and TGS conceived of the project idea. MJF, EP, CC, and AS
obtained clinical samples for analysis. JAB and JS provided the HeLA cell line
sample and Illumina GAII sequence data from this line for comparison. MPK
provided the 5.8 kb deleted cell line sample and comparative sequence file.
TGS, MCD, MG, and SIZ selected and provided nine haplogroup samples for
analysis, completed the Sanger sequencing of these samples for comparison,
and made manual haplogroup calls for all samples. AA, CK, and HH
performed all Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0 PCR and hybridization protocols of
the original data set. VP provided the validation set sample data as analyzed
by both Sanger sequencing and Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0. JCP and HMX
established the custom bioinformatic pipeline and processed all MitoChip
sample data. HMX, XG, TGS, MCD, and MJF wrote the manuscript. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
