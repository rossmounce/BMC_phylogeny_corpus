Ejecting chick cheats: a changing paradigm?
Tomáš Grim

Abstract
Evolutionary arms-races between avian brood parasites and their hosts have typically resulted in some spectacular
adaptations, namely remarkable host ability to recognize and reject alien eggs and, in turn, sophisticated parasite
egg mimicry. In a striking contrast to hosts sometimes rejecting even highly mimetic eggs, the same species
typically fail to discriminate against highly dissimilar parasite chicks. Understanding of this enigma is still hampered
by the rarity of empirical tests - and consequently evidence - for chick discrimination. Recent work on Australian
host-parasite systems (Gerygone hosts vs. Chalcites parasites), increased not only the diversity of hosts showing
chick discrimination, but also discovered an entirely novel host behavioural adaptation. The hosts do not desert
parasite chicks (as in all previously reported empirical work) but physically remove living parasites from their nests.
Here, I briefly discuss these exciting findings and put them in the context of recent empirical and theoretical work
on parasite chick discrimination. Finally, I review factors responsible for a relatively slow progress in this research
area and suggest most promising avenues for future research.
Introduction
Science advances by a triad of major types of contributions: most frequently by collecting data to test hypotheses that were already formulated or tested by others
(most papers in any scientific journal), less often by suggesting novel hypotheses (e.g. [1]) and most rarely by
discovering completely new and unexpected natural
phenomena (e.g. [2]). Recent work by Sato et al. [3] and
Tokue and Ueda [4] belong to this last category of
scientific endeavour. These two studies showed for the
first time that hosts of parasitic birds (genus Gerygone)
may defend against alien (little bronze-cuckoo Chalcites
minutillus) chicks by physically removing the living
parasite from the nest, so saving the lives of their own
nestlings. This qualitatively novel host behaviour contrasts with host deserting [5], feeding less [6] or pecking
[7] parasite chicks which were the only anti-chick
defences documented so far. Coupled with other recent
studies of parasite chick discrimination [7,8], these findings have important implications for our understanding
of host-parasite relationships specifically and parent-offspring interactions in general.

A novel host anti-parasite adaptation
Interactions between brood parasites and their hosts are
one of the most intensely studied natural models of coevolution, recognition and learning [9-11]. Until recently,
the majority view of host defences to mitigate costs of
parasitism was that most host species reject at least
some proportion of alien eggs but that hosts typically
accept alien chicks (reviewed in [12-14]). Virtually any
paper or textbook on brood parasitism is a testimony of
this (for an exception see [15]). Some studies even
claimed ‘hosts do not reject nestlings’ [16] despite rare
but existing evidence to the contrary (see older references in Table one in [12]). This view prevailed for decades despite rarity of any thorough studies on host
responses to alien nestlings [13]. Further, theoretical
arguments seemed to explain an apparent absence of
chick discrimination. An elegant and influential model
by A. Lotem [17] showed that imprinting on the first
clutch/egg is adaptive in hosts of evicting parasites
whereas imprinting on the first brood/chick is maladaptive. However, the model was based on a critical
assumption of learned recognition with naïve breeders
being unable to reject the parasite by definition (thus,
the model does not hold for non-learned innate recognition, see p. 744 in [17]). That assumption does not hold
empirically for many hosts because already first-year
naïve breeders often reject parasitism and no effects of
female age on her ability to recognize parasite eggs were

typically found [e.g. [18-20], Grim, Samaš, Cassey and
Hauber in prep.] (this, of course, does not exclude an
age-related fine-tuning of innate or learned discrimination abilities in other host species [21]). Also, Lotem’s
model [17] is unlikely to apply in hosts that show ~100
rejection of alien eggs, i.e., there is no inter-individual,
and by implication intra-individual variation in host
behaviour [22,23]. Limited data for parasite chick discrimination in relation to host individual experience [5,6]
also suggest that the misimprinting model does not
apply to chick discrimination in the host-parasite systems studied so far (but see [7] for a case of conspecific
parasites). As the known biological reality of inter-specific parasites does not generally fit assumptions of the
Lotem’s model [17], the misimprinting argument does
not constrain chick discrimination [5,6,12,24-26].
Brood parasitism literature was always heavily biased
in favour of egg discrimination [13]. However, absence
of evidence is not evidence of absence and, strikingly, all
recent papers that looked for parasite chick discrimination by hosts have found some evidence for host differential responses to alien nestlings ([3-5,7,27,28]; see also
p. 750 in [29] and [30]; earlier studies reviewed in
[12,31]). Although there are many studies based on
nests with parasite chicks, they typically did not follow
parasite chicks up till fledging. Such studies are inconclusive because discrimination can occur shortly before
[27,31] or even after fledging [32]. There are few careful
studies showing that chick rejection does not occur [9].
So, why are the new studies [3,4] so exciting?
The most striking aspect of the newly described chick
discrimination systems [3,4] is that chicks were not simply abandoned (as in the previous studies documenting
chick discrimination under natural conditions [12]).
Instead, hosts grasped the parasite nestlings with their
beaks and ejected them from their nests. Although eviction of dead chicks is known as an expression of nestcleaning behaviour in many birds (discussed in [12]),
such behaviour was never previously observed in the
context of host-parasite interactions.
Tokue and Ueda [4] work is further exciting for
another reason. Previously reported chick discrimination host responses were highly costly to hosts in
terms of (a) prolonged care for the parasite chick
before its desertion [33], (b) high rates of rejection
errors [3], or (c) a complete loss of host own progeny
([5]; but see [7] for a case study of conspecific brood
parasites). In contrast, Tokue and Ueda [4] showed
that chick discrimination may take place (a) almost
immediately after the parasite hatches, and (b) without
rejection errors (though in small sample sizes), thus (c)
rejecting host individuals saved their whole current
parental investment before the parasite chick had a
chance to destroy it.

Supplementary video materials to both Sato et al. [3]
and Tokue and Ueda [4] clearly demonstrate that such a
physical task is feasible even for small hosts like Gerygone warblers. As clear terminology is essential to
science, I suggest the removal of alien chicks is referred
to not as ‘eviction’ (as in [3]) but as ‘ejection’. By definition, eviction is performed by a cuckoo chick when
pushing host eggs and/or nestlings from a host nest (see
[9,34,35] and references therein). In contrast, ejection is
performed by a host parent when removing parasite
eggs (or nestlings) from its nest [9].
Admittedly, sample sizes were limited in both new
chick ejection studies. Still, in a Popperian vein, even
a single observation of hosts rejecting an alien chick
falsifies the hypothesis that hosts always accept them.
Of course, as in the egg discrimination studies, we
need to consider a possibility of chick recognition
errors (as documented by Sato et al. [3]). However,
such errors themselves suggest that hosts respond to
chick own-vs.-parasite identity. Also, we need more
detailed data showing that ejected nestlings did not
suffer from a disease - birds are known to remove sick
and/or dead chicks from their nests (see references in
[12]).
Another aspect of the two Gerygone-Chalcites studies
that should be highlighted is methodological. Both
papers provided readers with direct video-recording evidence of chick discrimination (see the supplementary
on-line video files for both studies). No paper on egg
discrimination has provided readers with such direct
evidence perhaps because some journals are reluctant to
publish electronic supplementary files. Still, various journals did publish supplementary video files for brood
parasitism studies but solely for studies of parasitic
chicks [2-4,7,36]. Perhaps journal editors and reviewers
do not encourage it because egg discrimination is a
well-known phenomenon, unlike chick discrimination.
In the future, such video-recording evidence might be
published as a useful supplementary material in egg discrimination studies too.
Egg discrimination studies often lack controls (see,
e.g., the three published studies with the highest sample size: [28,37,38]). Specifically, egg discrimination
studies did not always include control unmanipulated
nests (to quantify background nest desertion rates that
are not a response to parasitism) and/or observed
nests directly (to exclude a risk that a parasite egg disappeared not by host ejection but by being removed by
predators, brood parasites, or conspecifics). Both Sato
et al. [3] and Tokue and Ueda [4] employed control
nests for comparisons and monitored nests by continuous video-recording. This might inspire future egg discrimination studies to rest on more robust
methodologies than before.

Grim Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:14

The present arguments are not meant to devalue the
egg studies in any way - only by pinpointing imperfections of our past research we can improve it in the
future. This holds for studies of both eggs and chicks.
Further, research at the chick stage should not constrain
but complement research at the egg stage. Overall, I
explicitly stress the importance of balanced empirical
and theoretical research at all developmental stages, i.e.,
eggs, chicks and adults [28].

New findings fit theory
From a theoretical point of view it is remarkable that
both systems fit predictions from theory. Both the ‘rarer
enemy effect’ [12], an extension of rare enemy effect,
and the ‘strategy-blocking’ models [25,26] predict that
chick discrimination should evolve mostly in hosts that
do not successfully reject natural cuckoo parasitism (i.e.,
hosts are either acceptors of any, even highly dissimilar
foreign eggs, or their existing rejection abilities are compromised by evolved cuckoo egg mimicry). This is
essentially because of the asymmetry of cost/benefit
ratios of egg vs. chick discrimination (chick discrimination requires stronger selection pressure to evolve than
egg discrimination [12]) and an inevitable fact that the
parasite is always present in a host nest earlier as an egg
and only later in the form of a nestling. Obviously, a
host correctly rejecting parasite eggs (’rare enemies’) will
have no chance to face parasite chicks (which, as a consequence of host own behaviour, become even ‘rarer
enemies’). Paradoxically, egg-rejecting hosts themselves
eliminate selection pressure that would enable them to
evolve an ability to discriminate parasite chicks [12].
Thus, successful previous lines of defence (including
nest defence [39]) decrease positive selection pressure
on later lines of defence. Indeed, gerygones are currently
acceptors of natural cuckoo eggs ([3], see also Table
one in [12]) and, interestingly, recent work [40] suggests
that this might not be because of mimicry but because
dark cuckoo eggs are cryptic in dark host domed nests.
Still, this has the same consequences for evolution of
host defences - egg crypsis forces hosts to accept parasitism at the egg stage similar to egg mimicry, phylogenetic constraints and other mechanisms responsible for
high similarity in host vs. parasite phenotypes [41].
Given that gerygones are able to eject non-mimetic
experimental eggs (R. Noske pers. comm.) it is possible
that cryptic cuckoo eggs evolved as an evolutionary
response to host discrimination simply because dark
cryptic eggs would escape visual host discrimination.
This novel hypothesis provides an alternative explanation for the evolution of cryptic eggs not considered by
Langmore et al. [40]. Evolution of mimetic eggs (similar
to host eggs) or cryptic eggs (similar to dark nest interiors) represent two alternative pathways with effectively

Page 3 of 6

the same consequences - both cryptic or mimetic egg
appearances force hosts to accept parasitism and reduce
selection pressure on the evolution of chick discrimination [12,40].
Older empirical data fit the rarer enemy effect well
(Table one in [12]) and the strategy-blocking models
[25,26] and novel observations by Sato et al. [3] and
Tokue and Ueda [4] support the same views (see also
[30]). Additionally, low clutch sizes and high risks of
multiple parasitism by cuckoos may contribute to chick
ejection being a more adaptive strategy than egg ejection
in these hosts (the ‘egg dilution effect’ hypothesis [42]).
Chick ejections from the new studies [3,4] are compatible with both innate [12,26] and learned [17,43] discrimination. Although it is unlikely, due to the short
exposure of hosts to their own chicks, the latter option
cannot at present be safely evaluated because the ejected
cuckoo chicks hatched shortly after the host chicks (see
also [7] and a discussion of ‘sibling imprinting’ in [24]).
Only one study [44] followed individuals of known
breeding histories to test the effects of experience on
desertion of a single parasite vs. a single own chick
under natural unmanipulated conditions in the superb
fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. Nothing is known about
parental age effects on chick discrimination (and, by
implication, about innate and learned bases of such discrimination) in both chick-ejecting gerygones and any
other study systems with presumed or documented
defence against nestling parasites (but see a laboratory
study [6]). Long-term experimental studies with individually marked naïve first-time breeders with subsequently manipulated breeding histories (cf. natural unmanipulated observations in [44]) are needed to see
whether and how chick discrimination ability changes
during an individual’s lifetime.
It remains to be seen whether the prevalence of parasite chick ejection extends to other gerygone congeners
(that are often victimized by Chalcites cuckoos). If so,
the genus Gerygone may become an excellent model for
the study of parasite-host coevolution at the nestling
stage.

Constraints on detecting and studying chick
discrimination
What is the general lesson from recent studies on chick
discrimination? The traditional conception of host
inability to discriminate against divergent nestlings was
misleading. Why?
(a) Due to fundamental differences in avian and
human vision it makes little sense to look at host vs.
parasite phenotypes and judge their similarity [41,45].
All previous studies that claimed dis/similarity of host
vs. parasite nestlings were based on subjective human
vision-based assessment. Only very recently, the

Grim Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:14
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/14

assumption of chick differences was tested by objective
analyses of what host parents really perceived [8].
(b) Hosts may pay attention only to a specific trait (e.
g., gape colour reflectance in UV) and ignore other, perhaps less informative (but for humans more conspicuous!) traits (see also [8,46]). Such mechanisms were
already documented in the context of egg discrimination: some hosts pay attention to UV and blue colours
but ignore other regions of egg reflectance spectra [45]
and discriminate alien eggs based on blunt - but not
sharp - egg pole appearance [47,48].
(c) In contrast to egg discrimination, which is primarily or solely a visual task (which fits human sensory
biases), the discrimination of chick impostors might be
based on single or combined visual, acoustical or even
olfactory cues (that are harder to detect in the visiondominated human sensory world [5,12]). Additionally, I
suggest a novel potential cue for chick discrimination:
chick behaviour, e.g., posturing or wing-shaking, typically differs between host and parasite chicks [36], and,
thus, hosts might base their discrimination on such
behavioural traits. Also the eviction behaviour is performed solely by cuckoo nestlings and, consequently,
might be used by hosts to identify the parasite [30].
This hypothesis could be tested in host-parasite systems
where the behaviour of nestling parasites deviates from
that of host nestlings (examples reviewed in [36]).
Further, discrimination cues were typically tested in isolation in previous studies (e.g., visual cues only: [46];
acoustical cues only: [49]). I suggest, that a particular
cue may not work per se, or additively with another cue,
but could trigger discrimination only in interaction with
other cues (for an example of testing a similar ‘interactive’ hypothesis see [28]).
(d) Discrimination need not rely on recognition cues host-parasite chick similarity may be irrelevant for host
decisions to accept or reject chicks. Recognition-free
discrimination mechanisms rest on predictable differences in non-phenotypic cues associated with the presence of a parasite chick in the host nest. Such external
cues include brood size [3], amounts of care in terms of
feeding rates [33], or the length of parental care [27].
Except for one work [27], external cues like provisioning
costs or temporal costs of care were not experimentally
manipulated in any study of chick discrimination.
(e) Chick discrimination may result not only in an
outright rejection of the parasite by ejection [3,4], pecking [50], desertion [27] or starvation [51] but may also
be manifested in feeding parasites with a lower quality
[52] and/or quantity of prey [53]. Consequently, parasite
chicks may only decrease in growth instead of dying
[46]. This makes potentially continuous chick discrimination harder to detect than a dichotomous host decision to remove an alien egg or to let it stay in the nest.

Page 4 of 6

(f) Some subtler tactics of chick discrimination happen
at temporal scales of days [5] to weeks [33]. Thus, they
are much harder to detect than a simple act of egg ejection that occurs at temporal scales of days, hours or
even seconds [9].
(g) Chick discrimination may be poorly developed
before fledging [31]. Very few studies followed the fates
of parasitized nests up to fledging (reviewed in [12,31];
see also [33-35]. Moreover, discrimination may start
after fledging [12,32] and we lack detailed info on postfledging care in most host-parasite systems [9].
(h) That hosts accept parasite chicks under natural
conditions does not mean that hosts lack chick discrimination abilities - those might be countered by evolved
chick mimicry (just like egg rejecters are sometimes
forced to accept alien eggs that are highly mimetic
[9,15,22]). Therefore, without experimental manipulation
of chick traits [46] or testing host responses to chicks of
different species [6] it is not possible to say anything
conclusive on the existence or absence of chick discrimination in any host.
On the other hand, not all cases of parasite chicks not
thriving in host nests are evidence for specific host antichick defences [14,53]. Also, similarities between parasite and host chicks is not evidence of mimicry, or, by
implication, of chick discrimination. This is because
such similarities may be non-mimetic - they may arise
due to multiple reasons unrelated to brood parasitism
[41]. Thus, studying mechanisms of chick discrimination
provides theoretically, logistically and interpretatively
more challenging tasks than the research on egg discrimination does. These eight factors, coupled with the
previous rarity of empirical work, may explain the traditional myth of the absence/rarity of chick
discrimination.

Conclusions
Recent years have seen an increasing interest in host
responses to parasite chicks (14) and empirical data for
chick discrimination has begun to accumulate. This
shifting paradigm has already been reflected in some
textbooks [10,11]. Where to next?
(a) Various recent studies (see above) showed that just
because chick discrimination is not easy to document,
does not mean that it is non-existent or unimportant.
An emerging picture is that rejection of chick cheats
may not be a rare phenomenon. Clearly, more thorough
documentation of host abilities to reject alien chicks
across different species is needed (see also p. 750 in
[29]) as a starting point for future studies of causes and
consequences of host chick discrimination. Candidate
study systems are plenty [12,28,30,31].
(b) Several studies [7,27,49] confirm experimental
tractability of diverse chick discrimination systems. Still,

Grim Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:14
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/14

except for a single well studied system [5,8,40,44,49] we
know next to nothing about proximate chick phenotype
cues that trigger parental discrimination, repeatability
and heritability of chick discrimination abilities, or how
an ability to discriminate is moulded by experience.
Generally, we have no information on what the specific
mechanisms of discrimination at the cognitive, neural
and physiological levels from any host are. This holds
also for egg studies. Further, non-representative sampling across host taxa and low research effort in this
study area prevent analyses of phylogenetic patterns of
chick discrimination. Better knowledge of the phylogenetic distribution of chick discrimination will enable us
to address additional exciting questions, e.g., which lifehistory host traits facilitate or constrain evolution of
host defences against foreign chicks [24] and whether
discrimination of alien chicks by particular hosts is a
specific co-evolutionary adaptation or ‘collateral damage’
resulting from general host life-history traits unrelated
to parasitism per se [28,54].
(c) The successful incorporation of objective measurements of parasite/host phenotypic dissimilarity coupled
with realistic modelling of how hosts perceive such dissimilarity [23,45,55-57] was a major advance for brood
parasitism studies at the egg stage. However, we still
lack studies that would parallel such advances at the
nestling stage (but see [8,58]).
(d) An understanding of chick discrimination will be
further enhanced if theoretical models [12,17,25,26,43]
and empirical data will mutually inform each other.
In the past, the study of brood parasitism at the egg
stage was mostly empirical whereas studies at the nestling stage mostly relied on theoretical work [9,17].
Recently, the parasite nestling field went through the
discovery stage of scientific work with various cases of
chick discrimination being found across the globe. It is
exciting to see that future experimental work on broodparasite host arms-races, as a textbook example of coevolution, is no longer hindered by the lack of suitable
model study systems.
