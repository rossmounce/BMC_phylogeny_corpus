Abstract
Background: Streptococcus thermophilus represents the only species among the streptococci that has “Generally
Regarded As Safe” status and that plays an economically important role in the fermentation of yogurt and cheeses.
We conducted comparative genome analysis of S. thermophilus LMD-9 to identify unique gene features as well as
features that contribute to its adaptation to the dairy environment. In addition, we investigated the transcriptome
response of LMD-9 during growth in milk in the presence of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, a companion
culture in yogurt fermentation, and during lytic bacteriophage infection.
Results: The S. thermophilus LMD-9 genome is comprised of a 1.8 Mbp circular chromosome (39.1% GC; 1,834
predicted open reading frames) and two small cryptic plasmids. Genome comparison with the previously
sequenced LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 strains revealed 114 kb of LMD-9 specific chromosomal region, including
genes that encode for histidine biosynthetic pathway, a cell surface proteinase, various host defense mechanisms
and a phage remnant. Interestingly, also unique to LMD-9 are genes encoding for a putative mucus-binding
protein, a peptide transporter, and exopolysaccharide biosynthetic proteins that have close orthologs in human
intestinal microorganisms. LMD-9 harbors a large number of pseudogenes (13% of ORFeome), indicating that like
LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066, LMD-9 has also undergone major reductive evolution, with the loss of carbohydrate
metabolic genes and virulence genes found in their streptococcal counterparts. Functional genome distribution
analysis of ORFeomes among streptococci showed that all three S. thermophilus strains formed a distinct functional
cluster, further establishing their specialized adaptation to the nutrient-rich milk niche. An upregulation of CRISPR1
expression in LMD-9 during lytic bacteriophage DT1 infection suggests its protective role against phage invasion.
When co-cultured with L. bulgaricus, LMD-9 overexpressed genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism
as well as DNA replication.
Conclusions: The genome of S. thermophilus LMD-9 is shaped by its domestication in the dairy environment, with
gene features that conferred rapid growth in milk, stress response mechanisms and host defense systems that are
relevant to its industrial applications. The presence of a unique exopolysaccharide gene cluster and cell surface
protein orthologs commonly associated with probiotic functionality revealed potential probiotic applications of
LMD-9.

Background
Originally described by Orla-Jensen in 1919 [1], Streptococcus thermophilus is a low G + C, Gram-positive, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, facultative
anaerobic, homofermentative lactic acid bacterium that
has restricted natural habitats in the bovine mammary
mucosa and raw milk. Among the ninety-three currently
classified species from the genus Streptococcus [2], S. thermophilus represents the only species that is “Generally
Regarded As Safe” (GRAS). Accordingly, S. thermophilus
plays a prominent role in food biopreservation. Notably,
the species is used extensively in yogurt, cheese, and other
dairy fermentations, where it is traditionally paired with
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus helveticus. In these products, S. thermophilus is responsible for rapid acidification as well as formation of the
expected flavor and texture properties [3]. In addition,
yogurt cultures have also been linked to various probiotic
effects, including the alleviation of lactose intolerance [4],
modulation of intestinal microbiota [5], immunostimulation of host production of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines [6,7], and inhibition of specific
periodontal pathogens [8].
There are currently 48 completed genome sequences
from the genus Streptococcus that are listed in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
Microbial Genomes database. In addition, 311 streptococcal genome sequencing projects are currently in progress. Among these, three complete genomes belong to
S. thermophilus, with a fourth that is in progress. The
genome blueprints of S. thermophilus LMD-9 and two
other S. thermophilus strains, CNRZ1066 and LMG
18311 [9], have led to the identification of several
important features. Not surprisingly, genes associated
with virulence in other streptococci are either non-functional or completely absent in S. thermophilus [9,10],
suggesting that reductive evolution had occurred during
its domestication in the nutritionally-rich milk niche. In
addition, the LMD-9 genome contains regions unique to
this strain, including genes encoding for the production
and regulation of a broad spectrum bacteriocin, Thermophilin 9, genes involved in quorum sensing and competence development [11-16], and several of the
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) regions not present in both CNRZ1066 and
LMG 18311 that are involved in bacteriophage defense
[17,18].
Interestingly, long before even the notion of a genome
had even been conceived, S. thermophilus was reportedly
known “more by the things which it cannot do than by
its positive actions” [19]. Numerous studies have led to
the realization that this view is no longer accurate and
that S. thermophilus is indeed genetically equipped to

Page 2 of 17

perform numerous biological functions [20]. In this current report, we describe the many unique properties
present in this organism, as revealed by comparative
genomic analyses of LMD-9 with other S. thermophilus
strains as well as commensal and pathogenic streptococcal species. We also present results obtained from transcriptome analysis and in-depth mining of the annotated
LMD-9 genome to uncover other genetic features that
are potentially relevant to its adaptation and performance in the dairy environment.

Methods
Genome sequencing

The genome sequencing of Streptococcus thermophilus
LMD-9 (ATCC BAA-491) was described previously [10].
The complete genome sequence and curated annotation
of S. thermophilus LMD-9 can be accessed at GenBank
under accession number CP000419 (chromosome),
CP000420 (cryptic plasmid pSTER_A) and CP000421
(cryptic plasmid pSTER_B).
Bioinformatic analyses

The GAMOLA [21]/Artemis [22] software suite was used
to manage the genome annotation. Protein-encoding
open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using the
ORF-prediction program Glimmer2 [23]. ORFeome previously predicted by Makarova et al. [10] was used as a
reference. A manual inspection was performed in order
to verify or, if necessary, redefine the start and stop positions of each ORF based on sequence alignment with
proteins in the non-redundant protein database provided
by NCBI and potential ribosomal binding sites. Assignment of protein function to ORFs was performed manually using results from several sources. BLASTP [24] was
use on both a non-redundant protein database provided
by NCBI and clusters of orthologous groups (COG) [25]
databases. HMMER [26] was used to identify protein
motifs to the PFAM libraries [27]. TMHMM [28] was
used to predict transmembrane sequences, and SignalP
[29] was used for the prediction of signal peptides. The
TatP prediction tool was used to search for proteins that
contain a TAT signal peptide and TAT motif [30]. Chromosomal and plasmid maps were constructed using the
Microbial Genome Viewer [31] and Clone Manager Professional software (Sci-Ed Software, Cary, NC),
respectively.
Whole genome sequences were aligned using the GenomeComp software tool [32] with the external MEGABLAST nucleotide sequence alignment search program
available from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/) and
default run parameters. Metabolic pathway mapping of
S. thermophilus LMD-9 ORFeome was executed using
the software suite PathwayVoyager [33] with the Kyoto

Goh et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S22
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S22

Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) online
database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html).
A Functional Genome Distribution analysis (FGD, E.
Altermann, in preparation) was performed using 39 publicly available Streptococcus genome sequences, including
S. thermophilus LMD-9 (Additional file 1). FGD analyzes
the functional similarity between microbes based on their
predicted ORFeomes. FGD is a comparative genomics
approach to genome-genome comparisons, emphasizing
functional relationships rather than ancestral lineages.
Briefly, pooled ORFeomes are subjected to all-versus-all
analyses, evaluating the level and quality of amino-acid
similarities between individual ORFs pairings. Results for
each genome-genome combination are then combined
into a symmetrical distance matrix and was visualized
using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
mean (UPGMA) method [34]. Strain and cluster conserved and specific gene sets were mined based on respective BLAST e-values, using custom developed software.
The distance matrix was imported into MEGA4 [35] for
visualization. Based on the FGD calculations, ORFeome
synteny on amino acid level between all genomes was
assessed using ACT [36].
Transcriptome analysis. (i) Bacteriophage infection

S. thermophilus LMD-9 was incubated in M17 + glucose
at 42°C until reaching OD625 ~ 0.4, then the culture was
split. The lytic bacteriophage DT1 was added at a M.O.I.
of 1 to one culture as the expression treatment and samples were taken at time points of 5 min before infection
and 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min after infection. The cells
of the other half of the culture were immediately harvested
by centrifugation as the control.
(ii) S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus synergism in milk

L. bulgaricus BAA-365 was grown in skim milk for 7 hrs
at 42°C, and then added at an equal volume to S. thermophilus LMD-9, also in skim milk. Sterile skim milk at a
similar pH was added to a parallel culture of LMD-9 as a
control. After 4 hours or when pH 5.5 was reached, cells
were collected for RNA isolation.
(iii) Microarray fabrication, hybridization and data analysis

Microarrays were fabricated as 60mer oligo-chip arrays
generated from the S. thermophilus LMD-9 genome (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each oligomer was contact-printed
using the OminGrid robotic arrayer (GeneMachine, San
Carlos, CA), in triplicate, for a total of 4,866 features per
microarray. Slides were pre-treated according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using a UV cross-linking
method to anchor the oligos to the surface of the epoxy
slide.
Cells grown under various growth conditions were
harvested by centrifugation, and RNAprotect (Qiagen

Page 3 of 17

Inc., Valencia, CA) was used to stop gene expression
and stabilize the RNA [37]. RNA isolation was achieved
using the chaotropic agent TRI reagent (Molecular
Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, followed by bead-beating
and chloroform extraction, purification, and DNase
treatment (Turbo DNase, Ambion/Applied Biosystems,
Austin, TX). The cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 30 μg
of extracted RNA and directly labeled with two different
fluorochromes (Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA); Cy3
was used to label the treatment group and Cy5 was
used to label the control group. The labeled probes
were hybridized to the microarray slides in a HybChamber (GeneMachine) for 16 to 20 hours at 43 °C, then
the slides were washed in a series of three washing buffers [(1) 1X SSC, 0.03% SDS, (2) 0.2x SSC, and (3) 0.05
x SSC] and scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner
(Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale,
CA) at 5 μm per pixel resolution.
Statistical analysis of the data was based on the median
pixel intensities (at wavelengths of 635 and 532 nm) generated by the GenePix scanner. The values were normalized between spots and between each of the three
replicates performed using LimmaGui software package
(http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/) with general loess
after background correction. The least squares method
was used to determine differentially expressed genes, and
only those genes with a p value of ≤ 0.05 were considered
significantly different.

Results and discussion
General genome features

The general genome features of S. thermophilus LMD-9
was previously described as part of a multiple lactic acid
bacteria genomes sequencing project and comparative
analysis [10]. The LMD-9 genome is comprised of a single
circular chromosome (1,856,368 bp; 39.1% G + C) and
two cryptic plasmids, pSTER_A (4,449 bp; 37.0% G + C)
and pSTER_B (3,361 bp; 35.1% G + C) (Figure 1). Collectively, the LMD-9 genome is approximately 60 kb larger
than the genomes of the previously sequenced plasmidfree strains LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 [9] (Table 1).
Despite the modest differences in genome size, all three
genomes have the same G + C content of 39.1%. The
LMD-9 chromosome contains 1,834 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) that accounts for 81.2% of the chromosomal sequence. The ORFeome has an overall G + C
content of 39.93% and an average gene length of 822 bp.
Putative biological roles have been assigned for 1,417
(77%) of the ORFs, whereas the remaining 417 ORFs
encode for hypothetical proteins in which no probable
function could be predicted. As many as 241 (13%) ORFs
appear to be pseudogenes (Additional file 2). The majority

transcriptional regulators.

(Figure 2).

Genome comparison with S. thermophilus LMG 18311 and
CNRZ1066

Approximately 83% of the S. thermophilus LMD-9
ORFeome are common to both CNRZ1066 and LMG
18311 and constitutes the backbone of these three
strains. The latter two strains shared about 93 to 94% of
their ORFs [9]. As observed previously [38], the LMD-9
genome exhibited a lesser degree of global synteny when
compared to both LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066,

Genome alignment revealed chromosomal regions of
approximately 137 kb (7.4%) and 144 kb (10.6%) in the
LMD-9 strain that are not present in CNRZ1066 and
LMG 18311, respectively. These genomic segments correspond mainly to 73 and 65 regions of >50 bp specific in
LMD-9 when compared to CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311
genomes, respectively. Collectively, an approximate
114 kb of LMD-9 chromosomal regions encompassing
127 ORFs (representing 6.9% of the LMD-9 ORFeome)

are not found in both LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 (Additional file 3). These ORFs are located in 27 chromosomal
loci, six of which spanned more than 8 kb in length
(Figure 2). Interestingly, the distribution of these 27 loci
appears to concentrate at regions distal from the origin
of DNA replication (Figure 1, circle 12). Remarkably, 14
of these 27 LMD-9 specific chromosomal loci are flanked
by intact or truncated transposases, suggesting IS elements as a significant contributor to the genome diversity
in S. thermophilus.
Deduced proteins from 57 (45%) of the 127 LMD-9
specific ORFs have no orthologous counterpart in other
streptococcal species (see below), indicating they likely
originated via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Approximately
one-fifth (24/127) of the LMD-9 specific ORFs are predicted pseudogenes, providing further evidence that gene
decay had continued following strain divergence. The

majority of the remaining intact genes (40/103 or 39%)
encode for proteins involved in amino acid transport and
metabolism, transposases, or proteins having unknown
functions.
Eight of the LMD-9 specific regions contain ORFs with
conserved homologs in Streptococcus salivarius (more
than 90% sequence identity), notably genes coding for glycosyltranferases (R12 and R20), the his gene cluster (R14),
and numerous unknown proteins, suggesting that these
ORFs were most likely lost in both LMG 18311 and
CNRZ1066 strains. Similar to both LMG 18311 and
CNRZ1066, genes implicated in virulence from the pathogenic streptococci are either absent or truncated in the
LMD-9 genome, or are involved in other physiological
functions relevant to the adaptation towards dairy environment. In addition, only 17 of the LMD-9 specific ORFs
have closest orthologs with the pathogenic streptococci.

Most of these genes encode for unknown proteins and
transporters, some of which are truncated. One region
(R9) encoding a partial spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter, along with a putative chloride channel and a cell
envelope serine proteinase PrtS, is flanked by transposases
and showed conserved sequence and synteny to Streptococcus suis [39]. While the absence of PrtS in both LMG
18311 and CNRZ1066 strains has been previously noted
[16], this region, a so-called “ecological island”, was frequently found in the chromosomes of recently emerged S.
thermophilus industrial strains [39].
Three regions (R2, R5, and R11) encode for proteins
related to exopolysaccharides (EPS) biosynthesis with closest identities to corresponding proteins from Enterococcus
faecalis (STER0149, STER0150), Lactobacillus rhamnosus
(STER0656), Lactobacillus gasseri (STER1061), Lactococcus
lactis (STER1057), Clostridium beijerinckii (STER1059),
and intriguingly, gastrointestinal-specific bacteria Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus obeum (STER1063-1065).
Aside from the aforementioned PrtS, LMD-9 also acquired
an additional dipeptide/oligopeptide ABC transporter
(STER0142-STER0145) located within R2 that potentially
contributes to nutrient uptake in milk environments. This
peptide transporter exhibited moderate similarity (50 to
60% identity) to the corresponding transporter components
from various Bifidobacterium species also specifically associated with the human gut. Eight other LMD-9 specific
regions encode for proteins that potentially broadened its
repertoire of defense mechanisms. These included two
copies of a putative antimicrobial peptide ABC transporter
(STERψ0571-0572 and STER1347-1348) that have
close orthologs in Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus fermentum. Also identified were components of
restriction-modification (R/M) systems (STER0731 and
STER0750), an abortive infection phage resistance protein
(STER1698), and the previously identified CRISPR3 region
(R22) [18] which showed moderate sequence homology
(60 to 87% identity) to orthologs in Streptococcus mutans,
Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equi, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Strain LMD-9
also encodes a 1,009-amino acid residues surface protein in
R4 (STER0576) that was closely related to mucus-binding
(MucBP) domain-containing proteins in lactobacilli. This
putative mucus-binding protein (Mub) is not found in
other streptococci, and has a single MucBP domain with
an N-terminal YSIRK signal peptide and a C-terminal
LPNTG cell wall anchoring motif.
The genome of LMD-9 harbors a prophage remnant
(STER0810-0830) where part of the region (STER08160830) showed high degree of conservation with the
prophage remnant in CNRZ1066. Examination of the
corresponding chromosomal region in LMG 18311 and
S. salivarius SK126 draft genome, both of which lack the
phage remnant, indicated that the prophage elements in

Page 6 of 17

both LMD-9 and CNRZ1066 were integrated between
the genes encoding for para-aminobenzoate synthases
component I (STER0809/str0771) and 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate–homocysteine S-methyltransferase (STER0831/str0785). The remaining 3.7 kb of the
prophage region (R8), which is present only in LMD-9,
exhibited a high degree of sequence homology with lactococcal phages, suggesting the acquisition of this region
after strain divergence.
(ii) Regions absent in LMD-9

Approximately 105 kb and 103 kb in total of chromosomal regions in CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311, respectively,
were absent in the LMD-9 genome. Overall, 57 ORFs
interspersed in 14 chromosomal regions were present in
both strains but not in LMD-9. Fifteen of these ORFs
are pseudogenes, including remnants of gene clusters
coding for an amidase (str/stu0973), an amino acid ABC
transporter substrate-binding protein (str/stu0975), and
a maltose/maltodextrin ABC transporter (str/stu1015strstu1017). These genes appear intact in S. salivarius
and S. mutans, indicating that like LMD-9, these genes
are also undergoing degeneration, albeit at a slower rate,
in the other two strains. On the other hand, as in Streptococcus gordonii, both CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311 possessed a second copy of biotin synthase-encoding gene
bioY2 (str/stu1308) in a 8.6-kb unique region (str/
stu1308-1315), which displayed 42% sequence identity
to bioY1 present in all three S. thermophilus strains. The
remainder of the region encodes for a proline/glycine
ABC transporter that showed 60-70% similarity to the
corresponding orthologs in Streptococcus gallolyticus,
and a partial L-histidine degradation pathway consisting
of histidine ammonia-lyase (hutH, str/stu1313; EC
4.3.1.3) and a urocanate hydratase (hutU, str/stu1315;
EC 4.2.1.49). These enzymes are involved in the initial
steps of the pathway, although both CNRZ1066 and
LMG 18311 lack imidazolonepropionase (EC 3.5.2.7)
and formiminoglutamase (EC 3.5.3.8) required to yield
the final product, L-glutamate. Both strains also
appeared to have acquired type III R/M system components (str/stu 0884 and 0885) that most closely
resembled the orthologs in Listeria monocytogenes (70
to 80% identity). Strain LMD-9 also lacks genes encoding two oxidative stress defense proteins (str/stu0183
and str/stu1314) in CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311 that are
homologous (99% identity) to the OsrE and OsrF of S.
thermophilus CNRZ368 [40].
Genome comparison of S. thermophilus with other
streptococci

Comparative analysis of the ORFeomes among
sequenced streptococci using the FGD analysis revealed
functional clustering of the species that is consistent

with their grouping (pyogenic, mutans, salivarius, and
mitis) based on 16S rDNA phylogenetic inferences [41]
(Figure 3). Both S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 and LMG
18311 formed a tight cluster that diverges from the
LMD-9 strain. The S. thermophilus strains and the other
member of the salivarius group, S. salivarius SK126 (a
human skin isolate), formed a functional cluster, with S.
mutans as the closest pathogenic relative. Comparison
of genome content between all three S. thermophilus
strains and the draft genome of S. salivarius SK126
revealed that both species shared approximately 75% of
the protein-coding genes (E-value cutoff 1e-10). A set of
68 genes was identified as unique for S. thermophilus
compared to SK126, including genes encoding urease
biogenesis, lactose utilization (lactose permease LacS
and beta-galactosidase LacZ), CRISPR elements, transposases, various transporters, a type II R/M system, and
numerous hypothetical proteins of unknown function
(Additional file 4). It is interesting to note that the
urease gene cluster, lacS and lacZ are commonly found
in human oral-associated strains of S. salivarius but
apparently are absent in the skin-associated SK126
strain. Since these genes are not universally present in
other streptococci, it is plausible that they were acquired
by clonal populations of S. salivarius and S. thermophilus via LGT in their natural habitats. Meanwhile, 428
genes from S. salivarius SK126 are absent in all three S.
thermophilus strains. S. salivarius has a broader repertoire of genes involved in carbohydrate utilization and
biosynthesis of complex polysaccharides, including an
elaborate set of glucosyltransferases for glucan biosynthesis, as well as the complete pathway for the synthesis
of glycogen (STRSA0001_0011 to STRSA0001_0014). In
addition to the SrtA sortase, which is present as an
intact gene only in LMD-9 among the sequenced S.
thermophilus strains, S. salivarius also possesses an SrtB
sortase, and a wider array of cell surface proteins.
Among all the sequenced streptococcal strains included
in the comparative analysis, 510 genes were found conserved (E-value ≤ 1e-60 cutoff) in all strains. These core
genes, which are mostly involved in housekeeping functions, account for 27.8% of the total ORFs encoded in the
LMD-9 chromosome. Among the non-core genes, only 13
have no significant identity to all other streptococci and
therefore are species-specific for S. thermophilus, which
includes a putative arginase/agmatinase, a homoserine/
threonine efflux protein, a probable serine/threonine protein kinase, oxidoreductases, transposases and conserved
hypothetical proteins (Additional file 4). Meanwhile, 8
genes were identified as conserved in all streptococci
excluding S. thermophilus, notably genes that encode for
enzymes from the tagatose-6-phosphate pathway, a transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) involved in the pentose phosphate

Page 7 of 17

pathway, and a carbamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.2) belonging to
the arginine deiminase pathway.
Recent extensive genome analyses of pathogenic streptococci have established that capsular polysaccharide
genes and phage elements are major contributors to the
genome diversity among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae [42,43] and S. pyogenes [44-48], respectively.
Our comparative genome analysis revealed functional
sub-clusterings among the sequenced strains of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (Figure 3). Within the S. pneumoniae strains, eleven genes were detected as unique
for both R6 and D39 (cluster SP1), notably genes encoding for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (Additional
file 5). On the other hand, the SP1 strains lack seven
genes that are conserved in all cluster 2 (SP2) strains of
S. pneumoniae. Aside from capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic genes, both clusters also differ by the exclusive
presence of a bacteriocin immunity protein BlpX and a
prophage maintenance system killer protein in the SP2
cluster strains. It was previously reported in the TIGR4
(an SP2 strain) genome that the bacteriocin biosynthesis
and immunity protein genes are among those that
underwent lineage-specific gene duplication [42]. Meanwhile, the S. pyogenes strains appeared as three subclusters, with an apparent divergence of the M1 strain
SF370 (subcluster SY1) from the other strains, including
the contemporary M1 strain MGAS5005. Only four
genes, Spy0942, Spy0944, Spy0978 and Spy2147, were
detected as SF370-specific, of which the latter three are
phage-associated proteins (Additional file 6). Interestingly, no ORF was detected as conserved in all other S.
pyogenes strains that is absent in SF370. The major difference between the remaining SY2 and SY3 subclusters
is the presence of lantibiotic biosynthetic genes, phagerelated genes, and virulence-associated genes, such as
fibronectin-binding protein and serum opacity factor in
the SY2 subcluster.
Metabolic and biosynthetic capabilities

The LMD-9 genome encodes sets of enzymes conserved in
the LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 strains for glycolytic pathway, the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate
pathway, and pyruvate metabolism [16]. Unlike other closely-related Gram-positive species of lactococci, enterococci, bacilli, listeria and lactobacilli, the pyruvate
carboxylase-encoding gene required for the formation of
oxaloacetate from pyruvate is absent in all streptococci.
Instead, the key precursor for the biosynthesis of aspartate
family amino acids is generated from phosphoenolpyruvate
by a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc) conserved in
the streptococci. In S. thermophilus, it was demonstrated
that the activity of Ppc is essential for the bioavailability of
L-aspartic acid during growth in milk [49].

Unlike its pathogenic counterparts such as S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, which are auxotrophic for most amino acids, the putative pathways for
the biosynthesis of all amino acids with the possible
exception of alanine and lysine were identified in the
LMD-9 genome. The absence or inactivation of these
enzymes will also affect peptidoglycan biosynthesis,
which suggests that the generation of key intermediates
(L-alanine and meso-diaminopimelate) for peptidoglycan
synthesis may involve an alternate pathway. LMD-9 has a
7.4-kb his gene cluster (STER1198 to STER1207) that
encodes a complete histidine biosynthetic pathway, but
appears to be deleted in LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066
[16], which is further evidenced by the relative conservation of the adjacent genes flanking the his cluster
between LMD-9 and S. salivarius SK126. Nonetheless, in
LMD-9, we speculated that the presence of several copies
of transposases at the upstream vicinity of the his gene
loci might be involved in the inactivation of an EPS biosynthesis protein homolog (ψSTER1211) and the deletion
of glycosyltransferase genes which are otherwise found
intact in the corresponding region in S. salivarius.
S. thermophilus is predicted to be capable of de novo
synthesis of both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Like
the majority of the streptococci, S. thermophilus has the
gene which encodes for nucleoside diphosphate kinase
(EC 2.7.4.6; STER0929), a key enzyme for generating
dTTP, which was not found in S. mutans [50], S. sanguinis [51], S. gordonii, and S. pyogenes. Genes encoding salvage enzymes were identified for the utilization and
recycling of pre-formed nucleobases and nucleosides for
nucleotide synthesis as well as sources of energy, carbon,
and nitrogen. Purine salvage enzymes include adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase (STER1190), hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (STER0013), and purine
nucleoside phosphorylases (STER1072 and STER1075)
allow salvage of adenine, guanine, and xanthine nucleobases. Meanwhile, genes encoding for a xanthine phosphorybosyltransferase and a putative xanthine permease
(ψSTER1311 and ψSTER1312) that are present as a
potential operon appears to be inactivated by frameshifts.
The pyrimidine salvage pathway involves uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (STER0394) that converts uracil to
UMP, which is complemented by two putative uracil
uptake permeases (STER0375 and STER0556). The pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.2) gene
responsible for salvaging cytosine is truncated in all three
S. thermophilus strains, whereas the gene is intact in the
closely related S. salivarius and S. mutans. Nonetheless,
the presence of a uridine kinase (STER1238) and a thymidine kinase (STER0792) potentially permits uridine,
cytidine, and thymidine nucleosides as additional substrates for nucleotide synthesis.

Page 9 of 17

While the biosynthetic pathways for the cofactors biotin, pantothenate, pyridoxine, thiamine, and riboflavin
were incomplete, it is predicted that S. thermophilus is
capable of synthesizing coenyzme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein with L-cysteine or pre-formed pantothenate
as precursors. As previously noted by van de Guchte et
al. [52], the organism also possesses the complete pathway for folate biosynthesis from GTP or p-aminobenzoic
acid (PABA) precursor, as well as de novo synthesis of
PABA from chorismate (STER1554, STER0809).
Protein secretion systems

The transport of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane is a function of the general secretion (Sec) pathway.
A second pathway determined as the TAT (twin arginine
translocation) pathway secretes folded proteins. LMD-9
encodes components of both pathways that have been
described in both LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 [16]. As
with the YidC orthologs in LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066,
these proteins may interact with SecYEG, the membranespanning translocase, thereby potentially playing a role in
membrane protein folding and assisting SecYEG to insert
membrane proteins into the membrane [53].
The TAT translocase consists of either two, TatA and
TatC, or three TatA, TatB and TatC integrated membrane
components with the required energy provided by the proton motive force [54]. The TatP prediction tool was used
to search for proteins encoded by LMD-9 that have a
TAT signal peptide and TAT motif [30]. Seventeen proteins were identified, but only STER1023 has both a TAT
signal peptide and TAT motif (Additional file 7), whereas
the remaining 16 contained a potential TAT signal peptide
only. STER1023 encodes for a probable iron-dependent
peroxidase that may play a role in tolerance to oxidative
stress and shows high identity (97%) to the corresponding
ortholog in S. salivarius. BLAST analysis with the nonredundant database revealed orthologs in S. salivarius
SK126 with high identity (~94%) for TatA and TatC.
Orthologs for both TatA and TatC were found in the oral
commensal and also opportunistic pathogenic streptococci
S. gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguinis and Streptococcus parasanguinis indicating that the TatAC rather
than TatABC system is more common in streptococci.
EPS gene clusters

Similar to S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 and LMG 18311,
LMD-9 has two EPS clusters, an eps cluster and a rgp
cluster, the latter of which resembled the rgp cluster of
S. mutans that encodes for the biosynthesis of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide [16]. As in the case for
most S. thermophilus eps operons [55], the eps clusters
in all three S. thermophilus and S. salivarius SK126
showed conserved sequence (≥90% identity) and synteny

Figure 4 The exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic gene clusters in S. thermophilus and S. salivarius SK126. ORFs were color-coded
according to their prediction functions (see legend at lower left panel). Regions exhibiting sequence similarities among the eps clusters are
shown in light blue-shaded boxes. The size of each eps cluster is indicated in bracket.

confined to the terminal 5’ and 3’ regions of the clusters
(Figure 4). All four eps clusters are flanked by deoD
(encoding a purine nucleoside phosphorylase) and bglH
gene (encoding a beta-glucosidase), noting that bglH is
interrupted by frameshifts in all three S. thermophilus
strains.
There is considerable variation in the sequence and little synteny in the central regions of the eps clusters in
the S. thermophilus strains. Interestingly, the EPS biosynthetic components within this region of LMD-9 exhibited
highest sequence similarity to the corresponding proteins
in dairy associated L. lactis as well as microorganisms of
human intestinal origin, such as E. rectale, R. obeum, and
L. gasseri (R11, Additional file 3). The presence of two
divergently-orientated transposase remnants together
with the atypically low G + C content indicates that this
region is likely acquired via LGT. Approximately 10 kb
larger, the LMG 18311 eps cluster has a more complex

mosaic structure, with several of the genes conserved
with the eps genes from S. thermophilus IP6757. Meanwhile, CNRZ1066 has the most conservative eps cluster
that is almost identical to the ones previously described
in S. thermophilus MTC360, MR-2C and Sfi6 [56]
Although the physiological function of EPS production
in S. thermophilus remains elusive, the marked variability of the eps regions and prominent presence of mobile
elements at the vicinity of the eps clusters suggests the
presence of unknown factors that drives the evolution
and diversification of EPS among S. thermophilus strains
via lateral genetic exchange. Aside from the main contribution of EPS to the texture and rheology of fermented
products, EPS has also recently been associated with
host immunostimulative effects [57]. It is likely that the
diversity of the eps clusters may impart distinct immunomodulatory characteristics of the EPS produced by
S. thermophilus.

Specialized adaptation to the dairy environment.
(i) Carbohydrate utilization

Lactose represents the principal carbohydrate component in milk. Like the majority of the S. thermophilus
strains [58], LMD-9 was only able to ferment lactose,
sucrose, and glucose, in order of preference, as assessed
with API test and growth experiments (data not shown).
Major gene decay among carbohydrate utilization genes
occurred in LMD-9, a similar observation that was previously reported for strains LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066
[9]. In fact, the sets of intact carbohydrate utilization
genes and pseudogenes are almost identical to those of
LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 (Table 2), indicating that
gene degeneration occurred in the ancestor strain. Consequently, the limited repertoire of carbohydrate metabolic genes include three intact sugar hydrolases: a betagalactosidase, a sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, and an
intracellular alpha-amylase, in addition to (i) three intact
PTS with predicted specificities for mannose/fructose,
cellobiose, and sucrose; (ii) three putative sugar ABC

Page 11 of 17

transporters of unknown substrates, and (iii) two sugar
permeases predicted for the uptake of glucose and
lactose, respectively. The glucose/ribose permease
(STER0891) gene in all three S. thermophilus strains is
absent in S. salivarius SK126 and is located within a
previously identified 17-kb LGT hot spot [9]. This sugar
permease showed high identity (88 to 91%) to the orthologs in L. rhamnosus, L. lactis and L. helveticus that
shared a close ecological niche. Meanwhile, all three
S. thermophilus possessed complete pathways for the
conversion of N-acetylglucosamine to substrates of
glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and peptidoglycan
biosynthesis. Bovine milk contains oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids that potentially serve as a
source for N-acetylglucosamine. This suggests that aside
from lactose, S. thermophilus is also equipped to utilize
N-acetylglucosamine as an energy source during growth
in milk.
The gal-lac gene clusters are conserved in S. thermophilus and S. salivarius [59], and analogous lac-gal gene

clusters are also present in the sequenced strains of
L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus salivarius. However, L. bulgaricus, a companion culture for
S. thermophilus during yogurt fermentation, only has a
lacSZ operon. While absent in S. pyogenes and Streptococcus uberis, the galRKTE gene cluster is relatively conserved in the other sequenced streptococcal species. The
galM gene encoding an aldose 1-epimerase is found
only in strains of S. thermophilus, S. salivarius and
S. equi. The GalM orthologs from S. equi strains, however, showed only moderate sequence homology (50%
sequence identity) with the corresponding proteins from
the former two species.
Orthologs of the S. thermophilus cytoplasmic alphaamylase were found in most sequenced streptococci
(with 60-70% sequence identity) with the exception of
S. pyogenes and S. suis strains. Due to the inability of
LMD-9 to ferment starch, the intracellular alpha-amylase
is less likely to have a direct role in starch degradation, as
previously described for Streptococcus bovis and
S. mutans. The intracellular amylases of S. bovis strains
were shown to be essential for rapid cell growth [60], or
acted as maltotriose-producing endo-amylase [61]. In
S. mutans, this enzyme is involved in the accumulation of
glycogen-like intracellular polysaccharide during growth
on maltose [62]. Meanwhile, remnants of a putative pullulanase, a trehalose 6-phosphate hydrolase, and two betaglucosidase-encoding genes are also present in the
genome, the latter of which likely explained the inability
of LMD-9 to utilize cellobiose despite the presence of an
intact orphan cellobiose PTS EIIC-encoding gene. Overall, the majority of the pseudogenes are involved in the
transport and hydrolysis of glucosides, suggesting a possible niche transit of S. thermophilus ancestor strain from
plant to dairy environment.
(ii) Proteolytic system

Milk is poor in free amino acids as its rich protein content is present mainly in the form of casein. Although
LMD-9 is predicted to be capable of synthesizing most
of the amino acids, its genome encodes an intact cell
wall-associated proteinase PrtS, an abundance of cytoplasmic peptidases and transport systems that allows the
utilization of exogeneous protein source in milk. As previously mentioned, the PrtS is encoded in one of the
LMD-9 unique regions (R9; Additional file 3) and is
highly conserved (95% identity) with the PrtS of S. suis.
Although recent work suggested that PrtS contributes to
the virulence of S. suis [63], it is well established that in
S. thermophilus strains, the primary role of PrtS involved
the cleavage of casein to oligopeptides, a clear function
related to its dairy adaptation. Previous study with the
PrtS of S. thermophilus CNRZ385 showed that the

Page 12 of 17

proteinase is essential for growth in milk unless co-cultured with L. bulgaricus [64].
The LMD-9 genome possessed all 12 cytoplasmic peptidases (pepA, pepC, pepF, pepM, pepN, pepO, pepP, pepQ,
pepS, pepT, pepV, pepX) present in both LMG 18311 and
CNRZ1066 [16] strains that potentially provide flexibility
in peptide substrate specificities. Unlike most lactic acid
bacteria where some peptidase genes formed operon
structures with adjacent amino acid/peptide transporter
genes, none of the peptidase-encoding genes in S. thermophilus is located at the vicinity of any amino acid/peptide
uptake system. Nine complete ABC transport systems are
complemented by five permease porters for the uptake of
amino acids, oligopeptides and polyamines, including: two
oligopeptide opp ABC transporters (STER0142-0145,
STER1405-1409), three polar amino acids ABC transporters (STER0905-0907, STER1539-1542, STER1617-1619),
one ABC transporter (STER0398-0402) and two symporters for branched-chain amino acids (STER0993,
STER1315), one glutamine ABC transporter (STER14611462), and one spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter
(STER1493-1496). As mentioned previously, one of the
opp transport systems (STER0142-0145) is located within
a 10.2-kb unique region (R2; Additional file 3) of LMD-9
that shared moderate homology with distant species of
Bifidobacterium. This finding has led us to speculate that
LGT events potentially occurred beyond the milk niche.
(iii) Stress response and transcriptional regulation

S. thermophilus often encounter physiological stresses
caused by adverse conditions during commercial production of yogurt and cheeses as well as preservation of starter cultures. These include low pH, changes in osmolarity
and temperatures, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation
and competition in mixed culture environments. The
ability of strains to adapt and perform in these industrial
stress conditions is crucial to the consistency and organoleptic properties of the final products. The LMD-9
genome encodes a proton translocating F0F1-ATPase system (STER0515-0522) and a putative cation transport
ATPase (STER1107) that likely contribute to internal pH
homeostasis in high acidity environments. To cope with
oxidative stress, LMD-9 possesses a Mn-superoxide dismutase (STER0762) for the elimination of reactive oxygen species along with disulfide-reducing pathway
enzymes, including a glutathione reductase (STER0447),
thioredoxins (STER1776, STER1825) and thioredoxin
reductases (STER1382, STER1615). Other putative proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance include an
NADH oxidase (STER1258) that potentially plays a role
in the removal of oxygen and two methionine sulfoxide
reductases (STER1314 and STER1596) that serve housekeeping protein function via methionine sulfoxide reduction in proteins.

The classical class I heat-shock genes encoding the conserved chaperone complexes GrpE-DnaK-DnaJ and
GroES-GroEL were identified, with the HrcA repressorencoding gene located upstream of the grpE-dnaK-dnaJ
operon. Other heat-shock genes include the class III CtsR
repressor (STER0108), along with four Clp-ATPase chaperones (STER0109, STER0625, STER0648, STER1578)
and a ClpP proteolytic component (STER0395) that
degrade nonfunctional proteins. The pSTER_B plasmid of
LMD-9, a pC194 family rolling circle replicating plasmid,
encodes a 143-amino acid small heat shock protein (sHsp;
pSTER_B1) that is conserved (≥ 81% identity) in several
other plasmid-bearing S. thermophilus strains [65,66]. In
fact, pSTER_B1 is identical to the sHsp from pER1-1 of S.
thermophilus ER1 along with the upstream conserved
CtsR regulatory region [65], and the RepA deduced proteins from both plasmids shared 99% sequence identity.
Expression of these plasmid-encoded sHsp has been
shown to be upregulated at low pH or elevated temperatures, suggesting that pSTER_B potentially provides multitude cross-protections that enhance the survival of LMD-9
under various stress conditions. Meanwhile, S. thermophilus has two cold-shock protein genes (STER0879 and
STER0880) arranged in tandem and both deduced proteins shared only 50% identity. No homolog of STER0879
was found among other streptococci, whereas STER0880
is conserved mainly among the pyogenic group of streptococci (~ 80% identity). Interestingly, STER0879 and
STER0880 showed highest similarity to the tandem cspCD
genes in L. lactis (95% identity), which was induced by
cold shock at 10°C [67]. While one glycine-betaine transporter, OpuD (STRSA0001_1242) was found in the S. salivarius SK126 draft genome, no specific transporter or
biosynthetic pathway for compatible solutes was detected
in the S. thermophilus genomes. Nevertheless, several Trktype K+ transporter homologs are present (STER0311STER0312 and STER0350-STER0351) that may play a role
in cytoplasmic osmoregulation.
The ability of microorganisms to survive and adapt to
changing environments relies on the intricate sensing
and signal transduction mechanisms of two-component
regulatory systems. Hols et al. [16] previously noted that
all three S. thermophilus sequenced strains have the same
set of 20 two-component regulatory system (2CRS)
genes. Closer examination of the LMD-9 2CRS gene sets
revealed six sets of 2CRS consisting of both histidine protein kinase (HK) and response-regulator (RR) genes adjacent to each other (Additional file 8), compared to seven
and eight sets of 2CRS that were identified in CNRZ1066
and LMG 18311 strains, respectively. In comparison, the
S. salivarius SK126 draft genome has 12 sets of HK-RR
systems, reflecting its adaptation to a more complex
lifestyle.

(iv) Cell surface proteins

Cell surface proteins can be anchored to the cell wall
peptidoglycan through the action of sortase which
recognizes an LPXTG binding motif preceding a hydrophobic region at the C-terminus of the precursor proteins. The LMD-9 strain encodes for an intact sortase,
SrtA (STER1255) which presents as a pseudogene in
both LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 [16]. In addition,
three proteins with cell sorting motifs are pseudogenes
in LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066, whereas LMD-9
encodes for three sortase-dependant proteins in addition
to two pseudogenes containing the sortase recognition
motif. The three intact proteins which all contain an
LPNTG motif are the aforementioned PrtS and Mub, in
addition to a cyclo-nucleotide phosphodiesterase CpdB
(STER0198). Inactivation of the srtA gene in S. sanguinis
[68] and S. uberis [69] demonstrated its role in bacterial
colonization. The sortase from LMD-9 showed high
identity (~90%) with the sortase from S. salivarius
SK126. In addition to a second sortase, SrtB, S. salivarius also encodes for 420 proteins with signal peptide
sequences compared to 271 in LMD-9 (Additional file
7), reflecting the roles of secreted proteins in different
environmental niches of these closely related commensal
versus dairy domesticated species.
Unlike PrtS and CpdB, the putative Mub does not have
a SPaseI signal sequence at its N-terminal end, but rather
the YSIRK Gram-positive signal peptide [42] ([YF]
SIRKxxxGxxS[VIA]; IPR005877), in this case YGIRKFSFGAASVAIA. There is little sequence homology to
MucBP domain proteins from S. salivarius, however
Mub shares 66% identity with a conserved hypothetical
protein from L. fermentum that also contains a single
MucBP binding domain and an LPXTG motif. The presence of this gene in LMD-9 may represent an ancestral
remnant as Mubs are not encoded in the other S. thermophilus genomes. The loss of these functions in dairy bacteria has also been demonstrated in other lactic acid
bacteria that have evolved to a specific ecological niche.
For example, the small intestinal-associated L. acidophilus encodes for several Mubs compared to none in the
closely related cheese starter strain of L. helveticus,
demonstrating reductive evolution in their dairy environment [70]. Mubs in the case of streptococci may
be important for pathogenesis of these strains, providing
an advantage in regard to colonization. Loss of these
virulence-like features is a common trait observed in
S. thermophilus strains [9].
The third cell surface protein, CpdB, is believed to
convert non-transportable nucleotides produced by
RNaseI to nucleosides which can then readily enter the
cell and be utilized as a carbon source. CpdB has
recently been reported as a virulence factor and was

Goh et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S22
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S22

upregulated under iron starvation in S. suis [71]. Identification of this orthologous gene (SntA) in S. suis
revealed a tripeptide RGD motif in CpdB [72]. This
RGD motif has been demonstrated to bind to integrins
of mammalian cells and hence may play a role in host
interactions. Interestingly the CpdB of LMD-9 also contains an RGD motif starting at amino acid position 519.
Both LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 possessed a truncated
CpdB that has an LPXTG motif but lacks an N-terminal
signal peptide [16]. The CpdB of LMD-9 shows high
homology (91%) to the CpdB of S. salivarius and intermediate identity to orthologs from S. sanguinis (60%)
and S. suis (56%). Compared to LMG 18311 and
CNRZ1066, it is tempting to suggest that LMD-9 has as
yet not undergone as extensive genomic decay in terms
of genes that may play a beneficial role in the gastrointestinal tract such as mucin binding and utilization of
metabolites, which has also been observed for probiotic
lactobacilli [70]. This is in addition to an intact sortase
in LMD-9 that allows processing of PrtS for cell surface
exposure that potentially confer an advantage for growth
of LMD-9 in milk.
(v) Response to bacteriophage infection

Several mechanisms exist within the S. thermophilus
genome to combat bacteriophage infections. Bacteriophage resistance is usually conferred via non-specific point
mutations in genes involving cell receptor sites [73]. In
addition to other, more traditional bacteriophage resistance mechanisms, S. thermophilus LMD-9 possesses
three separate CRISPR loci, and 14 cas genes [18]. The
activity of CRISPR genes at the onset of phage DT1
exposure was determined by DNA microarray analysis
for each of the 14 known CRISPR genes, spread among
3 separate loci in the S. thermophilus LMD-9 genome
(Figure 1, circle 10). The phage response arrays indicated a transient increase in global gene expression,
including that of CRISPR genes, 5 minutes post infection, followed by a decrease in gene expression (Additional file 9).
The increased expression of the CRISPR1 locus (specifically, cas2 and cas1 genes) is indicative of their higher
activity during the phage response. CRISPR1 is known
to have repeat degeneracy within the CRISPR gene
sequence, with spacer size more highly conserved and in
the highest number when compared to the other two
loci [18]. This increase in spacer number and conservation in CRISPR1 is likely evidence of an effective
mechanism to integrate novel spacers when faced with
novel phage infection [74]. CRISPR3 plays a lesser role
in phage response, and likewise less gene expression was
observed. CRISPR2 has not been associated with active
phage response [18,74].

(vi) Protocooperation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus

During yogurt fermentation, protocooperation between
S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus results in rapid acidification of milk. As S. thermophilus is used in conjunction
with L. bulgaricus for yogurt fermentations, the sequencing of both genomes revealed additional symbiotic or
“protocooperative” relationship between both strains. The
advantages conferred between both species have been discussed previously with the release of the L. bulgaricus genome sequence [52]. These include an extracellular cell wall
bound proteinase (PrtB) encoded by L. bulgaricus and the
biosynthetic pathways of folate, p-aminobenzoic acid and
ornithine by S. thermophilus [52]. More recently, in silico
analysis of both genomes predicted genes acquired by
LGT for both species [38]. These LGT events included the
transfer of an EPS biosynthesis cassette from S. thermophilus to L. bulgaricus, and genes for the metabolism of
sulfur-containing amino acids from L. bulgaricus (or
L. helveticus) to S. thermophilus.
In silico analysis of LMD-9 revealed the presence of a
gene (STER0938) encoding a putative enzyme with conserved domain (COG0010) and a pfam domain (00491)
related to the arginase family of enzymes. The putative
arginase/agmatinase is likely involved in the biosynthesis
of polyamine putrescine by the conversion of L-arginine
to L-ornithine and urea, and thus may contribute to
protocooperation with L. bulgaricus through polyamine
metabolism. This gene is uniquely present in S. thermophilus (Additional file 4) as no ortholog is found in
other streptococci, L. lactis or lactobacilli. In fact, the
next best sequence match in the current database was
less than 30% identity with orthologs from an archaea
species isolated from metagenomic analysis of soil. Its
low G + C composition (28.2%) confirms that the gene
was horizontally acquired, presumably from another low
GC microorganism.
The transcriptomics of S. thermophilus LMD-9 during
milk fermentation in co-culture with L. bulgaricus
revealed significant regulation of several amino acid
metabolism and transport genes compared to the control (data not shown). This result was expected, as the
presence of L. bulgaricus and its extracellular protease
would increase the level of hydrolyzed proteins that
would be available for use once the free amino acids
from the milk media were depleted. Herve-Jimenez et
al. [75] likewise showed that there was an upregulation
of amino acid biosynthesis and nucleic acid metabolism
in S. thermophilus when grown in co-culture with
L. bulgaricus.

Conclusions
Although milk is a rich growth medium for many
microorganisms, bacteria that grow and compete well in

Goh et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S22
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S22

the milk environment must, at minimum, be able to use
lactose as an energy source and milk protein as a source
of amino acids. The adaptation of S. thermophilus
LMD-9 to the milk environment is reflected by several
observations from genomic and transcriptome analyses,
including specialized systems for metabolizing lactose,
the general absence of other carbohydrate metabolic systems, the presence of amino acid and peptide scavenging machinery, and numerous stress response and host
defense mechanisms. Functional genome distribution
analysis showed a close functional relationship between
S. thermophilus and S. salivarius. Although the genome
of S. thermophilus reflects a more simplified lifestyle
compared to S. salivarius, both species shared several
unique gene features (e.g. urease biogenesis, lactose
metabolism) that are not universally present in other
streptococci, which were possibly acquired by clonal
populations from their natural ecosystems. Meanwhile,
almost half of S. thermophilus LMD-9 unique genes
have no orthologous counterpart among other streptococci. This indicates that LGT, the majority of which
were likely mediated via transposable elements, served
an important role in shaping the unique gene repertoire
that potentially contribute to the fitness of LMD-9 in its
specialized niches. The degree of sequence similarity of
some of these alien genes, e.g. those involved in EPS
biosynthesis and peptide transporters with microorganisms naturally found in the human intestinal environment suggests multiple transient habitats of LMD-9
beyond the restricted dairy environment. Compared to
LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066, the notable presence of
intact cell surface factors (mucus-binding protein, cyclonucleotide phosphodiesterase) in LMD-9 suggests that
the latter strain has as yet not undergone as extensive
genomic decay with regards to genes that may contribute to the interaction with human intestinal epithelium. This is in addition to unique EPS signature and
functional bacteriocin production machinery that potentially expand the probiotic attributes of LMD-9.
