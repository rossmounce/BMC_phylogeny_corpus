Abstract
Background: Guidelines established for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and genotype interpretation do not apply for HIV-2.
Data about antiretroviral (ARV) drug efficacy and resistance mutations is scarce.
Methods: Clinical data about HIV-2 infected patients in Belgium and Luxembourg were collected and the effect of ARV therapy
on plasma viral load and CD4 counts were analysed. Viral RNA encoding for protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) from
ARV-naïve and treated patients were sequenced.
Results: Sixty-five HIV-2 infected patients were included in this cohort. Twenty patients were treated with 25 different ARV
combinations in a total of 34 regimens and six months after the start of ARV therapy, only one third achieved viral load
suppression. All of these successful regimens bar one contained protease inhibitors (PIs). Mean CD4 gains in the group of viral
load suppressors and the group of patients treated with PI-containing regimens were respectively significantly higher than in the
group of non-suppressors and the group of PI-sparing regimens. The most frequent mutations selected under therapy (compared
to HIV-2 ROD) were V71I, L90M and I89V within PR. Within RT, they were M184V, Q151M, V111I and K65R. All of these
mutations, except K65R and M184V, were also found in variable proportions in ARV-naïve patients.
Conclusion: Despite a high rate of ARV treatment failure, better virological and immunological results were achieved with PIcontaining regimens. The analysis of polymorphic positions and HIV-2 specific mutations selected during therapy showed for the
first time that transmission of drug resistant viruses has occurred in Belgium and Luxembourg. The high heterogeneity in ARV
combinations reflects a lack of guidelines for the treatment of HIV-2 infection.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is a lentivirus that causes AIDS [1]. Compared to HIV-1, the disease progression is slower [2] and the transmission rate
and plasma viral load are also lower [3,4]. Most of the
patients infected with HIV-2 are asymptomatic and do not
need antiretroviral (ARV) therapy if HIV-1 guidelines are
used as a reference [5]. If ARV therapy is started, the choice
of drug regimens is limited due to lower drug susceptibilities in comparison to HIV-1. Firstly, HIV-2 is naturally
resistant to the non-nucleosidic reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NNRTI) [6,7] and to the fusion inhibitors (FI)
that are available on the market [7]. Secondly, reduced
susceptibility to some protease inhibitors (PI) has previously been described. HIV-2 displays resistance to amprenavir (APV) [7-9]. Reduced efficacy of nelfinavir (NFV)
has been observed in primary isolates from patients [10]
and in vivo [11]. In vitro, IC50 to atazanavir (ATV) and
tipranavir (TPV) are higher compared to HIV-1, while IC50
to lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV) are within the
same range [12].
The majority of HIV-2 infected persons live in West African countries [13], where HAART is not yet available or
has only been implemented recently. No large scale clinical studies have been published on the immunological
and virological effects of ARV drugs. Furthermore, there is
no consensus for plasma viral load quantification and no
commercial assay is available. As a consequence, the interpretation of ARV impact on viral replication raises problems. A first evaluation of viral load measurement
techniques [14] as well as the use of an HIV-1 designed kit
for HIV-2 RNA quantification has been documented [15].
Some clinical studies based on variable cohort sizes and
designs have been made. ARV therapy has shown to have
a modest impact on CD4 cell recovery [11,16-18]. Better
outcomes were seen with PI-containing regimens in some
studies [16,19,20], but others found no difference
[17,21].
Although viral evolution occurs slowly in HIV-2 infection
[22], the appearance of mutations in the protease (PR)
and the reverse transcriptase (RT) genes is common under
drug pressure. In HIV-2, these two drug targets harbour
amino acid residues which are also involved in HIV-1
drug resistance: 10V, 32I, 36I, 46I, 71V in the protease
gene [23] and 118I, 215S in the RT gene in addition to the
3 positions linked to the NNRTI resistance (181I, 188L
and 190A) [6,24]. Some mutations appearing under treatment have been clearly linked with therapeutic failure. In
the protease, changes were observed that have already
been described for HIV-1 drug resistance (10I, 47A, 50V,
54M, 71I, 82F/L, 84V, 90M) in addition to HIV-2 specific
positions or substitutions (33L, 45R, 56A, 62A, 99F)
[10,25-28]. The number of mutations needed to confer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/21

high-level resistance to PIs is lower in HIV-2 [9]. In the RT,
the K65R mutation was selected under tenofovir containing regimens [29] or in combination with Q151M and
M184V under stavudine, abacavir or didanosine therapy.
The Q151M mutation, which is frequently found [30], has
been documented under different NRTI-containing regimens while M184V was linked to lamivudine (3TC) use
[16,24,28,31,32]. Transmission of drug resistant strains
may have occurred [33] as well as viruses with a mutational pattern facilitating the acquisition of multi-drug
resistance [9,10]. In this observational study, a small
cohort of HIV-2 infected patients is presented. A positive
effect of ARV therapy on clinical parameters was observed,
but the impact on CD4 recovery was modest and virological failures were frequent. Drug resistance mutations were
detected at failure and some of these mutations were
already present in ARV-naïve patients.

Methods
Data Collection
An anonymous data sheet was sent to the clinicians in
charge of HIV-2 infected patients using the Belgian AIDS
Reference Laboratories network and the Laboratoire de
Rétrovirologie in Luxembourg. Patients were identified by
a code. Patients with an untypeable HIV status in immunoblot or presumably co-infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2
were excluded. In a first round, epidemiological and clinical data were collected as well as the availability of retrospective samples. In a second round, frozen plasma or
serum samples stored in the normal diagnosis and followup settings, were obtained for the sequencing of PR and
RT coding regions at different points during the treatment.
Viral load measurements
Two different methods were used for plasma viral load
assessment.

On the one hand, HIV-2 plasma viral load was measured
by a real-time PCR in-house assay on a Lightcycler platform [34]. The assay was modified to obtain a sensitivity
of 50 RNA copies per millilitre and it used a quantified
synthetic RNA as external standard. Viral RNA was
extracted from 1 millilitre of plasma or serum by Nuclisens Magnetic Isolation kit on a Mini-Mag apparatus
(Biomérieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands). RNA was eluted in
40 µl buffer. 8 µl were used for reverse transcription using
the Transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) with random hexamers
(final concentration 60 µM) in a final volume of 20 µl.
The real-time PCR was performed using the Lightcycler
FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I, 100 µl kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) on a Lightcycler 2.0
platform. Each capillary contained 48 µl PCR grade water,
6 µl of each primer (in a final concentration of 0.6 µM –
see ref 30 for sequences), 20 µl of Master Mix provided in

the kit and 20 µl cDNA. Each run consisted of forty cycles
of amplification (95°C 15 s – 60°C 40 s – 72°C 30 s) followed by a melting curve analysis.
On the other hand, a semi-quantitative assay was used as
described by Van Kerckhoven et al. [35] with HIV-2 specific primers described in [36]. The latter method was the
reference in Belgium before 2004 and is still used for the
follow-up of some patients.
Genotype
RT-PCR and inner PCR were performed as described by
Colson et al. [27] and PCR products were analysed in a 2%
agarose gel with ethidium bromide. This protocol generated a 1507 bp fragment which covers the protease and
the RT coding regions. Viruses of subtype B failed to be
amplified. In this case, two separate inner PCR reactions
were performed using 2 µl of RT-PCR product. One reaction amplified the RT coding region with the forward
primer JR23 5'-TAATGACAGGCGACACC-3' and the
reverse primer JR24 5'-TGTGCTGCCCAATTTAG-3', both
at a final concentration of 0.2 µM. PCR conditions were as
follows: 10 min at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 45 s at 57°C, 1.5 min at 72°C, and finally an incubation of 10 min at 72°C. The second reaction amplified
the protease coding region, with the forward primer JR21
5'-AGACACCATACAGGGAGC-3' and the reverse primer
JR41 5'-TGTATGGATTAGTAGGAGGCG-3' under the
same experimental conditions.

PCR products were then purified using the QIAquick PCR
purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Twenty
nanograms of each PCR product were sequenced with the
BigDye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers used for
sequencing of PCR products obtained by the first protocol
were H2Mp3 [27] and JR 40 5'-AGGATTAGTTGGAGGTGC-3' for the protease coding region, and JR23, JR24,
JR25 5'-GCACCTCCAACTAATCCT-3' and JR 26 5'-GCAGTATATGGTCTAAAGTC-3' for the RT coding region. If the
first PCR protocol was not successful, the protease coding
region was sequenced with primers JR21 and JR41, while
the RT coding region was sequenced with JR23, JR34 5'AGTTGAGCTGCCCAATTTAA-3' and JR35 5'-CGCCTCCTACTAATCCATACA-3'. Products of the sequencing reaction were purified by ethanol-acetate precipitation and
analysed on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyser (Applied
Biosystems).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP software
version 6 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA). The significant
effect of ARV therapy on plasma viral load was assessed
using a Kaplan-Meyer survival curve in order to consider if
virological failure was the outcome at three different time

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/21

reference points after therapy initiation. To interpret the
impact of ARV therapy on CD4 count evolution, data was
first standardised to obtain CD4 values at the same reference points for every therapy, using a linear regression
model to interpolate values between existing measurements. In a first model, delta CD4 values were calculated
from treatment initiation at intervals of three months.
Two different parameters were tested: the therapy (PI-containing or not) and virological failure. Analysis of the variance between groups was done using a Tukey test. In a
second model, the raw CD4 data on a time scale between
the two different therapy groups was considered and
response specification was assessed by constructing linear
combinations with a Manova fit model.
GenBank accession numbers
Earliest samples from 30 patients were submitted to GenBank and received accession numbers from EF611309 to
EF611338: the first 23 were ARV-naïve (from EF611309 to
EF611331) and the last 7 were treated patients.
Ethical approval
This evaluation was approved by the ethical committee of
the Medical Faculty of the Université Catholique de Louvain.

Results
Epidemiological data
Sixty-five patients were included in our cohort and data is
summarised in Table 1. The male/female ratio was about
1, median age was 42 at the end of 2006, and the transmission route was essentially heterosexual. The majority
(i.e. 63%) of cases were of West African origin, although
cases from Europe, central Africa and Asia were recorded.
Twenty out of the 65 patients received ARV therapy and 15
were still on therapy at the end of 2006.
Effect of ARV therapy on plasma viral load
As different methods were used for the viral load determination, and in the absence of a gold standard, we chose
qualitative criteria to evaluate the efficacy of therapy.
Either the regimen successfully suppressed viral replication and plasma viral load became undetectable, or replication was not suppressed and this was defined as
virological failure. The threshold used was the detection
limit of the least sensitive method. All therapies were
started in the presence of a detectable viral load and baseline viral load values are given in Table 2. The presence or
absence of viral replication was investigated at three
points: 6, 12 and 24 months after initiation of therapy.
Overall, 60%, 53% and 50% of virological failures were
observed respectively. Details are available in Table 2.
Twenty out of 34 regimens were first line therapies, and 7
second-line therapies were initiated in the presence of
resistance mutations. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was

The percentages were calculated for patients with available data (collected until 2006-12-31). ARV: antiretroviral therapy

drawn to compare the appearance of virological failure in
PI-containing and PI-sparing regimens (not shown). A significant difference existed between the two (p = 0.02): the
mean times to virological failure were 9.42 months for the
PI-containing group and 1.2 months for the PI-sparing
group.

CD4 at baseline was 263 cells/mm3 (ranging from 10 to
737). In the group of patients who had never been treated,
data from 10 patients with baseline CD4 counts between
the same ranges were considered, with a mean at the first
visit of 402 cells/mm3 (193–660). Over one year, the
mean loss was 16 CD4/mm3.

Effect of ARV therapy on CD4 count
Information on CD4 counts evolution was gathered for
25 therapies. Three suboptimal therapies were excluded
from the statistical analysis (Table 2, lines 23–25). Mean

The CD4 gain after therapy initiation was plotted on a
time scale. The PI-containing and PI-sparing groups, as
well as the viral load suppressor and non-suppressor
groups, were compared (Table 3). A Tukey test was per-

formed, comparing the variance in CD4 gain at intervals
of 3 months after therapy initiation. Viral load suppressors had a distinctively higher CD4 gain than viral load
non-suppressors (p < 0.0001), with respective mean gains
of 137 and 23 CD4/mm3 after 12 months. Differences in
treatment had a significant influence on CD4 gain (p =
0.003). A mean gain of 106 CD4/mm3/year was observed
in the PI-group while a mean loss of 25 CD4/mm3/year
was obtained in the PI-sparing group. A second test was
performed to establish the immunological response based
on raw CD4 data using a Manova test. After 12 months of
treatment, a gain of 96 CD4/mm3 in the PI-group and a
loss of 11 CD4/mm3 in the PI-sparing group had been
recorded. For the PI-group, this gain was already observed
after 3 months of therapy and was maintained afterwards
while the decrease observed for the PI-sparing group did
not significant differ from zero.
Finally, baseline CD4 counts were stratified in three
groups, more than 400, between 400 and 200 and less

than 200 cells/mm3. The same tendencies were observed
for respectively 4, 7 and 11 different treatments but they
had poor statistical relevance, especially for the groups
higher than 200 CD4/mm3.
Mutations selected on therapy, polymorphisms and
resistance at baseline
Table 4 shows the mutations that appeared in the PR and
RT during ARV therapy. The ROD strain (subtype A) was
used as reference for the description of mutations.

In the PR, the most frequent mutation was V71I: it
showed 3 times under NFV therapy. This mutation was
associated once with V62A and L99F, once with T56A and

after the disappearance of K70N and with the concomitant presence of K35R, K64R and K82R.

In the RT, the most frequent mutation selected on therapy
was M184V. It appeared in eight different treatment failures with different regimens all containing 3TC, which
was also the most prescribed ARV drug.

The K65R mutation was selected 3 times on therapy and
the only drug in common for the 3 regimens was ABC.

The Q151M mutation was found in viruses from 4
patients with different regimens. Firstly, in association
with I10V, K35T, K82R, Y115F and M184V in patient A
who had a history of AZT, 3TC, d4T and ABC exposure.
Secondly, Q151M appeared in association with the
M184V mutation under AZT/3TC pressure (patient C).
Thirdly, in patient G, Q151M was observed in association
with M184V and F214L under AZT/3TC/ABC pressure.
The further continuation of this regimen subsequently
resulted in the appearance of K65R, N69S, V83I, I90V and
V111I. Lastly, and again under AZT/3TC/ABC pressure
(patient I), the Q151M appeared on a M184V background

also harbouring the Q151M mutation. The patients
affected were the only 2 homosexual men of this group.
Furthermore, positions 10, 35, 64, 69, 82, 83, 90 and 111
were found in variable proportions in naïve patients (see
Fig 2 for details). The M184I mutation was found in one
ARV-naïve patient but was present in the provirus only.

Africa, the transmission is essentially heterosexual, and
the male/female ratio is about 1 [3,37]. We also recorded
patients originating from countries where the presence of
HIV-2 had not yet been reported, such as R.D. Congo,
South-Africa and Nepal. Although Central and Southern
Africa is confronted with a huge HIV-1 epidemic, HIV-2 is
not completely absent [38].

Discussion
We describe retrospective data on 65 HIV-2 infected
patients, with insights on the effect of ARV therapy on
plasma viral load, CD4 counts and the selection of drug
related mutations.
In regard to the epidemiological picture of this cohort, the
main characteristics do fit with the trends described in literature: the majority of patients originate from West

The impact of ARV therapy on viral replication was studied using a qualitative marker: the presence or absence of
a detectable plasma viral load. Up until now several assays
had been described for HIV-2 quantification [15,34,3942], the majority of them using real-time PCR. But even
among these techniques, the standards used differ, resulting in important discrepancies in absolute quantification
[14].

We observed that viral load suppression was achieved
with PI-containing regimens in 50% of the therapies after
six months of treatment. Only one therapy with 4 NRTI
resulted in an undetectable viral load within the same
period. This study faced three main drawbacks. Firstly, the
number of patients recorded was limited and many different ARV combinations were given. We do know that some
drugs have a reduced activity against HIV-2 and their
impact in the PI- containing or sparing regimens could
have influenced the results. Secondly, we had no data on
adherence but there were no indications for a different
adherence in the PI and non-PI subgroups. Thirdly, long
term efficacy of ARV drugs on viral load suppression was
difficult to evaluate as a failing regimen was stopped as
soon as the plasma viral load results became available to
the clinician. Nevertheless, long term viral suppression
was observed only within PI-containing regimens. The
viral load levels at baseline could not explain this difference as they were higher in the PI-treated group. This
observation is consistent both with the knowledge we
have of HAART in HIV-1, where guidelines recommend
the administration of 2 different classes of drug [5], and
with the CD4 count evolution in our group of patients.
The CD4 gain was significantly greater if PIs were included
in the therapy compared to regimens with RTIs only. We
observed a mean loss of 16 CD4/mm3 per year in a group
of 10 non-treated patients. This loss is similar to what was
found elsewhere for HIV-2 [43]. The CD4 loss in
untreated patients did not differ significantly from the
loss observed in the subgroup of virological failures or
from the subgroup treated without PIs. Our study further
indicates that the best results in terms of immunological
reconstitution were obtained when the plasma viral load
was fully suppressed. Other studies have found a CD4
gain in HIV-2 treated patients between 41 [17] and 163
[11] cells per year. If we consider all the patients treated
with 3 or more ARV studied here, the CD4 gain of 64
CD4/mm3 per year seems modest. Several hypotheses
may explain this moderate efficacy. First, PR and RT catalytic sites differ between HIV-1 and HIV-2 despite a common structural backbone at protein level and therefore,
the sensitivity of HIV-2 to drugs differs from HIV-1
[6,7,44]. Some of the regimens observed include NFV and
APV, to which sensitivity is reduced [7,8,11].
Moreover, we know that the plasma viral load is lower in
HIV-2 infection compared to HIV-1 in spite of an equivalent proviral load [45]. The viral replication cycle may differ from HIV-1, with a lower number of infective cycles.
Drugs now available target the replicative cycle and may
be therefore less active. Finally, there are no criteria or
guidelines to start therapy based on biological parameters
and more clinical studies are needed to determine the
optimal conditions for a successful HIV-2 therapy.

The use of suboptimal regimens will prompt the appearance of resistant viruses. Here, we observed mutations in
the reverse transcriptase that had already been described
before: K65R, Q151M and M184V [28-32]. These were the
mutations most frequently observed under therapy. We
also noted the frequent occurrence of the V111I mutation:
this mutation was present in 7 out of 23 ARV-naïve
patients, but also showed 3 times in association with
K65R under various NRTI-only regimens. A major challenge with genotype interpretation is the discrimination
between natural polymorphisms and changes affecting
sensitivity to ARV drugs. Changes that appeared under
therapy at RT positions 10, 64, 82, 90, 111, 167 and 218
(see Fig. 2) were widely found in ARV-naïve patients [46].
Phenotypic studies are needed to assess their impact on
resistance. For instance, the K35R mutation, already
described elsewhere [24], was selected under AZT/ABC/
3TC therapy but was also present in a naïve patient. The
K70N, also selected on AZT/ABC/3TC therapy was
observed in vitro when ROD and EHO HIV-2 strains were
cultured under ABC pressure [47]. We observed no selection of Y at position 215 [48]. S215T was selected in 3TC/
ABC/TDF therapy, but 215T and 215Y were also observed
in naïve patients.
In the PR, the appearance of mutations was associated
with the 3 regimens that included NFV. The V71I mutation was common to the 3 cases. This same mutation was
also retrieved in 3 others naïve patients. The V47A mutation was observed elsewhere under LPV/r treatment [49].
We confirmed the presence of this mutation by LPV/r in
one case of second line virological failure.
It is known that the L90M mutation occurs in vitro under
SQV [25,47] and NFV pressure [9], and in vivo during
NFV, IDV, SQV/r and LPV/r treatments [26,49]. We found
presence of L90M under FPV/r and ATV/r containing regimens, suggesting that L90M is a multi-resistance mutation.
Although more phenotypic and clinical studies are
needed to assess the impact of mutations in more detail,
our observations suggest a low genetic barrier to resistance. The use of a PI-based regimen, which our results
tend to recommend, could be limited by the selection of
multi-resistant strains.
Besides substitutions that are not clearly linked to resistance such as K35R, I90V and V111I in the RT, we observed
viruses or proviruses from naïve patients harbouring
known resistance mutations like Q151M and M184I. In
the protease, we found mutations at positions 62, 71, 89
and 99 in viruses from ARV naïve patients, positions
which are possibly linked to resistance [9,27]. This indi-

cates for the first time that transmission of resistant strains
does occur in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Conclusion
This observational study showed that treatment of HIV-2
infection is heterogeneous in Belgium and Luxembourg
and has moderate efficacy. Immune recovery was
observed with PI-containing drug combinations when
plasma viral load was suppressed. Selection of resistance
mutations occurred in both PR and RT. Analysis of polymorphisms in ARV naïve patients and mutations appearing during therapy showed for the first time that
transmission of resistant HIV-2 strains has occurred in
Belgium and Luxembourg. This implies a reduced usefulness of ARV for the treatment of HIV-2 infections in the
future. There is therefore an urgent need for genotype
interpretation rules as well as standardisation and implementation of HIV-2 laboratory techniques.
