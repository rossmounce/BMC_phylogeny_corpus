Abstract
Background: The ADAMTS (A Disintegrin-like and Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin
motifs) proteins are a family of metalloproteases with sequence similarity to the ADAM proteases,
that contain the thrombospondin type 1 sequence repeat motifs (TSRs) common to extracellular
matrix proteins. ADAMTS proteins have recently gained attention with the discovery of their role
in a variety of diseases, including tissue and blood disorders, cancer, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's and
the genetic syndromes Weill-Marchesani syndrome (ADAMTS10), thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (ADAMTS13), and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (ADAMTS2) in humans and belted
white-spotting mutation in mice (ADAMTS20).
Results: Phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the exon/intron organization of vertebrate
(Homo, Mus, Fugu), chordate (Ciona) and invertebrate (Drosophila and Caenorhabditis) ADAMTS
homologs has elucidated the evolutionary relationships of this important gene family, which
comprises 19 members in humans.
Conclusions: The evolutionary history of ADAMTS genes in vertebrate genomes has been marked
by rampant gene duplication, including a retrotransposition that gave rise to a distinct ADAMTS
subfamily (ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8, -15) that may have distinct aggrecanase and angiogenesis functions.

Background
ADAMTS (A Disintegrin-like and Metalloprotease with
Thrombospondin motifs) proteins have homology with
the metalloprotease region of the ADAM proteases, but
also have at least one of the Thrombospondin type 1
Sequence Repeat (TSR) motifs that are common in extracellular matrix proteins. Since the discovery of a gene
encoding ADAMTS1 in 1997 [1], a total of 19 similar
genes have been found in the human genome [2], num-

bered ADAMTS1-20; there is no ADAMTS11 because early
reports of an ADAMTS11 [3] were later found to describe
ADAMTS5. Many of these genes have been implicated in
a variety of diseases, including connective tissue disorders
[4], cancer [5-7], osteoarthritis [3,8], and possibly Alzheimer's disease [6,9]. Recently, an autosomal recessive
form of Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) has been
attributed to null mutations of the ADAMTS10 gene [10].
The symptoms characteristic of this syndrome (short

stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and anomalies of
the eye lenses), together with its expression patterns, suggest a role for the gene encoded by this protein in normal
growth and in skin, eye, and heart development.
ADAMTS proteins are characterized by a pro-domain, a
metalloprotease domain, the so-called disintegrin-like
and spacer domains, and a tail of TSR repeats. The prodomain of ADAMTS1 and -4 is cleaved at the RX(K/R)R
furin cleavage site [11] in the Golgi [12,13], releasing an
active protein [14]. There are clearly conserved furin cleavage sites for most human ADAMTS proteins (positions
578–581 of the alignment) [Additional File 2]. While this
site was less well conserved in ADAMTS10 and
ADAMTS12, the pro-domain of ADAMTS12 was also
shown to be removed by a furin-mediated process [7]. On
the basis of this combined evidence, it is commonly
believed that furin cleavage of the pro-domain might
occur for all ADAMTS proteins.
The metalloprotease domain of ADAMTS proteins is
shared with the related ADAM proteins, and the catalytic
Zn2+-binding motif HEXGHXXXXXHD [15] is well conserved, shown at amino acid positions 761–772 [Additional File 2]. While the metalloprotease domain of
ADAM proteins is followed by a disintegrin domain
which binds integrins at a conserved X(D/E)ECD site
[16,17], the corresponding amino acids in the disintegrinlike domain of ADAMTS proteins are not well conserved.
We also note that the so-called spacer domain following
this disintegrin-like domain (amino acids 1060–1400)
[Additional File 2] in fact has many highly conserved residues, despite its comparatively reduced overall conservation of amino acid sequence.
There are four matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage
sites in the spacer domain of ADAMTS1 [14,18], including
the highly conserved IPAGA site at amino acid positions
1229–1233 [Additional File 2] (L. Iruela-Arispe, personal
communication). Further proteolytic processing within this
domain has been demonstrated for ADAMTS1, -2, -5, and
-12 [3,6,7,19]. For ADAMTS1, this second proteolytic step
is mediated by several MMPs, and results in removal of
the C-terminal TSRs that interact with the extracellular
matrix (ECM). This leads to release of the protein from the
endothelial cell membrane, reducing its ability to inhibit
endothelial cell proliferation and probably reducing its
anti-angiogenic potential [14]. Release of ECM-bound
proteins via proteolytic removal of their TSR domains may
be a common theme, as we see similar proteolytic
removal of the C-terminal TSRs of the unrelated neuronal
guidance protein F-spondin by plasmin, releasing it from
ECM binding [20]. While the exact mechanism of the proteolytic processing of ADAMTS proteins remains somewhat controversial, there is an intriguing possibility that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/11

regulation of the ratio of ECM-bound vs. free ADAMTS
protein could be mediated by MMPs. The region containing these sites is conserved to varying degrees in the newly
discovered ADAMTS proteins, suggesting variable (perhaps tissue-specific) MMP processing of these proteins.
ADAMTS4, which lacks a TSR tail, may not have an ECMbound form.
The region between the metalloprotease domain and the
TSR repeat tail was demonstrated to be necessary for gon1, a Caenorhabditis ADAMTS homolog, to mediate cell
migration during gonadogenesis [21]. A variant of this
region that lacks the conserved amino acids upstream of
the classic TSR but maintains the highly conserved spacer
residues is found in papilin, where it has been implicated
in influencing cell rearrangements during organogenesis
[22] and in the Manduca sexta lacunin protein which plays
a role in basal lamina remodeling during morphogenesis
[23]. It will be interesting to investigate whether there is to
be a common theme of organogenesis function among
proteins that contain this configuration of domains.
There is evidence that several mammalian ADAMTS proteins are expressed organogenesis. For example, mutations in the mouse ADAMTS20 gene have been found to
cause the belted white-spotting mutation, resulting from
a defect in melanocyte development or migration during
embryogenesis [29], the ADAMTS1 protein is necessary
for mouse gonadogenesis [30], ADAMTS12 is specifically
expressed in fetal lung [7], and several of the newly
described ADAMTS proteins [28] are expressed solely or
primarily in fetal tissue.
ADAMTS proteins contain a single "classic" TSR motif
(WXXWXXW) in the disintegrin-like domain, and a variable number of variant TSRs within the C-terminal tail of
the protein, which contain 4 amino acids between tryptophan residues (W4XW) rather than two. TSRs can be
divided in several structural groups, based on the presence
and spacing of cysteines [24]. The precise function of each
type of TSR has not yet been determined, although it is
known that the sequence CSVTCG in one of the thrombospondin-1 TSR's mediates endothelial cell apoptosis
through binding to CD36 [25,26]. About 70 proteins in
the human genome contain TSRs [27] and many of them
are matrix binding proteins.
ADAMTS1 and -8 inhibit angiogenesis [31], and gene
expression profiling suggests that ADAMTS4 also has a
role in angiogenesis [32]. Several of these proteins
(ADAMTS1, -4, and -5) have also been shown to cleave
aggrecan, the proteoglycan that makes cartilage elastic and
compressible [19,33,34], and ADAMTS4 was recently
shown to cleave cartilage oligomeric matrix protein
(TSP5) [35]. The ADAMTS2, -3, and -14 proteins appear

functionally related. ADAMTS3 is a procollagen II Npropeptidase, and ADAMTS14 appears also to be an aminoprocollagen peptidase [36]. ADAMTS2 is an aminoprocollagen peptidase of procollagen I and II, and deficiency
of this protein causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC
[4]. ADAMTS13 is a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene result in inappropriate platelet activation, leading to the blood disorder
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [37-40].
Recently, an intriguing link has been discovered between
ADAMTS metalloproteases. The proinflammatory
cytokines IL17 [41], IL1β [42] and TGFβ [43] induce
expression of ADAMTS4. TGFβ also induces ADAMTS2
[44] and TNFα was found to up-regulate ADAMTS1,
ADAMTS6, and ADAMTS9 in ocular cells [45], suggesting
a role for these proteases in inflammatory eye disease.
Similarly, TNFα produced a marked induction of
ADAMTS1 in endothelial cells [46]. As several ADAMTS
proteins, ADAMTS4 in particular, are implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, and TNFα inhibitors have been recently
been used with great success in its treatment [47], we speculate that part of the effect of the TNFα inhibitors is an
indirect downregulation of the ADAMTS proteins that
break down connective tissues. As TNFα inhibitors are not
without inherent risks [48,49], transcriptional inhibition
of specific ADAMTS genes may ultimately provide similar
benefits with fewer risks.
To better understand the multiple functions of the
ADAMTS proteins, we carried out the most detailed and
comprehensive analysis to date of the phylogenetic relatedness and intron/exon organization of all human
ADAMTS genes, including their comparison with invertebrate and chordate ADAMTS homologs. Prior analyses
included fewer species and did not address the sequence
of genomic events that resulted in the current ADAMTS
genomic structure [2,28,50]. Our analysis reveals distinct
sub-families with unique functions and reveals a history
of gene duplications, retrotransposition, and the loss and
gain of introns during animal evolution. For example,
ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8, and -15 genes all derive from a retrotransposition event that occurred prior to the divergence
of vertebrates and the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, and
from subsequent gene duplications that occurred prior to
the divergence of mammals and the pufferfish, Fugu
rubripes. This ADAMTS protein subfamily encompasses
proteins that share aggrecanase and angiogenesis-related
activities.

Results & Discussion
Gene discovery
To perform a phylogenetic analysis of the ADAMTS gene
family we first examined several genome databases to
have a comprehensive survey of all ADAMTS genes in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/11

humans and other species. When we started this analysis
in 2002 only 12 ADAMTS proteins were known. We predicted coding sequences of the human ADAMTS genes
based on several sequence databases (see Material and
Methods) and found them to be identical to those subsequently published by Cal, et al [28] based on cloned
cDNAs. This work confirmed that a total of 19 ADAMTS
genes exist in the human genome, with various isoforms.
Since there were several cases in which alternative splicing
or different exon predictions resulted in ADAMTS proteins of varying lengths, the most complete (longest)
translations were considered in our analyses, and their
Genbank accession numbers are indicated [Additional
File 2]. ADAMTS9 has three known splice variants, of
which the long variant that we used for analysis was
NM_182920. ADAMTS20 has two known splice variants,
of which we used NM_025003. ADAMTS18 has two
known variants, of which we used NM_199355, minus
the final exon. ADAMTS13 has four known variants, of
which we used NM_139025.
ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS6 each have a single known coding sequence, and we found evidence of others. The variant of ADAMTS6 that is published (NM_014273) is a
short form, and contains a non-consensus exon immediately following the metalloprotease catalytic site, while
the variant of ADAMTS10 that is published (NM_030957)
has a consensus exon at this location, and is in the long
form. We predict a long form of ADAMTS6, as well as a
consensus exon for ADAMTS6 and a non-consensus exon
for ADAMTS10. We used the consensus exons of both
genes in our analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
We compared the 19 known human ADAMTS protein
sequences with ADAMTS homologs from invertebrates
(Drosophila and Caenorhabditis) from which entire genome
sequences were recently determined, to elucidate their
evolutionary relationships (Figure 1A and 1B) [Additional
File 1]. This revealed a series of gene duplications among
human ADAMTS genes, of uncertain affinity to these
invertebrate relatives. With the goal to further elucidate
this gene duplication history, the human and invertebrate
ADAMTS orthologs were compared with ADAMTS
orthologs from Mus, Fugu and Ciona, which diverged
between humans and invertebrates, and with an additional invertebrate, the honeybee, Apis mellifera (Figure 2)
[Additional File 2].

To perform this analysis we inferred the coding sequence
of sixteen ADAMTS proteins in the Fugu rubripes genome
[52], and drew from Genbank nine representative mouse
orthologs, three orthologs from the Drosophila genome
and four from Caenorhabditis (see Figures 1A and 2).
Other Mus (and Rattus) ADAMTS orthologs that were

unannotated at the time of our initial work have since
been identified by others [51,53], and some are annotated
in the MEROPS database[82]. However, they were not
included for our final analyses presented here since they
are so similar to the human sequences (69–99% identical,
[53]) that they offered no help in elucidating the gene
duplication history. The invertebrate genomes were surveyed extensively for additional ADAMTS genes, and
those most closely related to the vertebrate ADAMTS
orthologs were retained in the analyses presented herein.
The most divergent Drosophila and Caenorhabditis
ADAMTS homologs represented in Figure 1A were
removed from further analyses in attempt to avoid systematic bias known as "long branch attraction" where
divergent but putatively unrelated sequences group
together because of their divergence rather than due to
shared characters [54]. All ADAMTS proteins introduced
here contain the same basic domain structure as previously described ADAMTS proteins. A complete alignment
of all human and invertebrate ADAMTS protein
sequences, and representative Ciona, Fugu and Mus
orthologs, annotated with intron positions and phases, is
available [Additional File 2].
Intron position and phase
We compared the positions of introns and their phases
between Homo, Fugu, Ciona, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis
homologs of ADAMTS genes, in attempt to corroborate
and further elucidate their evolutionary relationships, as
shown in Figure 3. The term intron phase refers to the
position of the splice site with respect to the codon, where
phase 0 describes a splice site 5' of the codon, phase 1
describes a splice site between the first and second base of
a codon, and phase 2 describes a splice site between the
second and third base of a codon. Introns at the same
position that have the same phase in homologous genes
are considered to be shared characters that were conserved
during evolution. The lack of an intron at a conserved
position may either suggest that the gene lost an intron at
that position during its evolution, or that it never had that
intron, and the intron conserved in the other homologs
was gained after those homologs diverged from the
intron-lacking homolog. In combination with the phylogenetic analysis of the ADAMTS protein sequences, a parsimonious interpretation of the data summarized in
Figure 3 that invokes the fewest changes should help to
distinguish between older and more recent gene duplication events in this gene family. Three of our most striking
observations of the intron distribution are that (i) some
intron positions are shared between worm, fly, chordate
and vertebrates, (ii) recently duplicated genes share similar patterns of introns, and that (iii) the complete absence
of ancient introns and the presence of introns at new positions in ADAMTS1, 4, 5, 8 and 15 of vertebrates and Ciona
reveals that this subgroup of genes evolved by retrotrans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/11

position early during chordate evolution, was repopulated by new introns (in some cases, separately in
vertebrates and Ciona), and subsequently underwent gene
duplication during the evolution of vertebrates.
The phylogenetic analysis of animal ADAMTS homologs
reveals that proteins that are known to have similar biological activities are closely related, and that they have
evolved by a series of gene duplication events (Figure 2).
Since the functions of only some ADAMTS proteins have
been empirically tested, estimates of evolutionary relatedness amongst the entire family may imply closer functional relatedness, and thus guide the future design of
more specific empirical tests of protein functions. An
interesting property of the vertebrate ADAMTS proteins
are the extensive sequence similarity between many pairs
of sequences, as indicated in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 [and Additional file 2]. Although in many cases little is known
about the functions of these proteins, we can speculate
that the two proteins in each pair may share similar biological activities due to their shared primary sequence. It
is also possible that these ADAMTS proteins act as heterodimers, in a manner similar to the ADAM proteins fertilin α and β [55].
As shown in Figures 1 and 2 and summarized in Figure 4,
animal ADAMTS homologs have undergone several gene
duplications. Assuming that the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is
true and arthropods and nematodes are united as a group
[56-62], our results indicate that a single ADAMTS gene
duplication preceded the divergences of Ecdysozoa and
chordates. At least 3–4 ADAMTS gene duplications
occurred in chordates prior to the divergence of Ciona and
vertebrates, followed by additional gene duplications in
vertebrates prior to the divergence of Fugu and mammals
(Figures 2 and 4).
Ciona intestinalis, the urochordate sea squirt, was found to
have at least six ADAMTS genes (Figure 2), which
correspond to six of the seven major groups of vertebrate
ADAMTS homologs. Ciona ADAMTS6 is the sister of the
group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS6 and -10, indicating that ADAMTS6 and -10 evolved by gene duplication
early during vertebrate evolution, preceding the divergence of pufferfish and mammals, but after their divergence from urochordates. Similarly, Ciona ADAMTS16 is a
sister to the group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS16
and -18, Ciona ADAMTS7 is a sister to the group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS7 and -12, Ciona ADAMTS3
is a sister to the group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS2,
-3 and -14, Ciona ADAMTS9 is a sister to the group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS9 and -20 and Ciona
ADAMTS15 is the sister to the group comprised of vertebrate ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8 and -15. This reveals that both
gene duplications early in chordate evolution as well as

systems.

protease cleaving von Willebrand factor, leading to abnormal blood clotting. Although the mouse ADAMTS13 gene
was not included in this analysis, it has been identified
(Genbank accession number NM_001001322).

ADAMTS2, -3, and -14 have been recognized as evolutionarily closely related genes, encoding proteins with a common functionality as procollagen aminopeptidases. They
are as a group most closely related to a single gene in
Ciona, and appear to have evolved by gene duplications
that occurred prior to the divergence of pufferfish and
mammals but after the divergence of urochordates and
vertebrates. They are most closely related to ADAMTS13,
suggesting a gene duplication from a common ancestor
(Figures 1 and 2). ADAMTS13 appears to have originated
early in vertebrate evolution as it has a closely related
homolog in the pufferfish Fugu rubripes but is apparently
absent in Ciona, fly and worm genomes. The pufferfish
ADAMTS13 homolog is not only closely related at the
amino acid sequence level, but also has the same
ADAMTS13-specific intron/exon structure in its tail,
which is unique among the ADAMTS gene family. This is
in agreement with a unique function for ADAMTS13 as a

A second evolutionarily related group is comprised of
ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8 and -15 and their single sister in
Ciona. Vertebrate members of this group share unique
intron positions and lack all of the intron positions held
by other ADAMTS genes and their invertebrate homologs
(Figure 3). Three members of this group (ADAMTS1, -4,
and -8) encode proteins with aggrecanase and angiogenesis-related functions, which suggests the examination of
ADAMTS5 and -15 for similar biological activities. This
putative "angiogenesis/aggrecanase group" appears most
closely related to ADAMTS20 and -9. Further, the unique
intron positions shared by ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8, and -15,
and lack of invertebrate orthologs in this putative "angiogenesis/aggrecanase group" suggest that this group's progenitor arose within chordates via a retrotransposition
event from the common ancestor of the group comprised
by ADAMTS20 and -9 (Figures 2 and 4). The intron/exon
structures of ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8, and -15 are similar to

Proposed scenario for the evolutionary history of ADAMTS proteins
Proposed scenario for the evolutionary history of ADAMTS proteins. During chordate evolution a series of gene
duplications resulted in six ADAMTS proteins present in the Ciona genome, while an early retrotransposition event gave rise to
the "angiogenesis clade" of ADAMTS proteins. This proliferation of ADAMTS proteins did not occur in invertebrates, and
there is evidence of the loss of one ADAMTS ortholog from Caenorhabditis. More recent duplications that occurred early during vertebrate evolution resulted in the paired sets of ADAMTS proteins present in the human genome. The chromosomal
locations of the human ADAMTS genes are indicated in parentheses and the exon structure of each human gene is diagrammed
to the right of its position in the schematic phylogenetic tree, and shown in more detail in the Additional Files.

that of the mouse ADAMTS1 gene [63], and our analysis
shows four ADAMTS genes with this characteristic gene
structure in the genome of F. rubripes. Therefore, retrotransposition of an ancestor of the angiogenesis/aggrecanase subfamily of genes, its acquisition of new introns,
and subsequent gene duplications that produced five
related genes occurred prior to the divergence of human,
mouse and pufferfish lineages. In at least one case (intron
17 in ADAMTS8) we see evidence of acquisition of a new
intron following the process of duplication, but prior to
the divergence of mammals and pufferfish.
ADAMTS20 and -9 are most closely related and, along
with the members of the angiogenesis/aggrecanase clade,
are most closely related to invertebrate gon-1 (Caenorhabditis) and CG6107 (Drosophila). The finding that
ADAMTS9 and -20 together as a group have a single sister
gene in Ciona indicates that they evolved by gene duplication in the vertebrate lineage, after their divergence from
urochordates. However, the results of our phylogenetic
analyses demonstrate that neither ADAMTS9 nor
ADAMTS20 can alone be rightfully dubbed as being
orthologous to gon-1, as has been recently proposed
[64,65]. In fact, our analyses suggest that while gon-1 and
CG6107 are likely orthologs, the chordate ortholog of
these genes was the common ancestor of Ciona ADAMTS9
and -15, i.e. also the common ancestor of the later-duplicated vertebrate ADAMTS genes ADAMTS9, -20, -15, -5, 8, -4, and -1 (Figures 1 and 2).
Only one invertebrate sequence (Drosophila CG4096) was
found that grouped with the remainder of the human
ADAMTS homologs. The placement of this gene with or
within a group of these remaining ADAMTS genes would
suggest the number of gene duplication events in this gene
family that occurred prior to the divergence of vertebrates
and invertebrates from a common ancestor. The KishinoHasegawa test revealed that the likelihood of Drosophila
CG4096 being most closely related to an ancestor of the
group of all remaining mammalian ADAMTS proteins, or
of the various groups nested within it, was not significantly different from the likelihood that Drosophila
CG4096 is most closely related to ADAMTS 7 and -12
(data not shown). The most parsimonious explanation of
this result is that a single gene duplication of an ancient
ADAMTS homolog occurred early during the evolution of
animals, prior to the divergence of chordates from invertebrates, followed by lineage-specific gene loss and gene
duplications (Figure 4). If this scenario is correct, the
Caenorhabditis ortholog of Drosophila CG4096 has been
subsequently lost, but the vertebrate ortholog has been
retained and underwent several gene duplications within
and among chromosomes in the vertebrate lineage
(ADAMTS2, -3, -6, -7, -10, 12–14, 16–19).

The exons comprising the TSR tail each contain a single
variant TSR, with the C(S/T)XCG motif 5' and the W4XW
motif at the 3' end. This exon structure may facilitate the
formation of alternately spliced isoforms, such as we
describe here, but it would also lend itself to duplication
or loss of individual repeats. However, the number of variant TSRs in the tails of these proteins has been conserved
for the gene pairs ADAMTS17 and -19, ADAMTS6 and -10,
and ADAMTS18 and -16 (Figure 4). While this may suggest a series of relatively recent gene duplications, a more
likely explanation is that each TSR has an important and
non-redundant role, or that the presence of a specific
number of TSRs is critical for each protein's function.
The apparent absence of any ortholog of ADAMTS17 or 19 in the pufferfish genome (Figure 2), but their presence
in Mus and Rattus [51] suggests that this gene duplication
either occurred in mammals after they diverged from fish,
or that ADAMTS17 or -19 evolved earlier than the mammal/fish divergence but were lost in Fugu.
Gene duplication is a common way by which new genes
with similar functions may evolve. In fact, duplication of
large segments of chromosomes has been a common
occurrence during animal evolution [66,67]. Both the
phylogenetic trees and the intron/exon structures of
ADAMTS genes show a history of such duplications. In
addition to the similarity in intron positions of ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -8, and -15 in both mouse and pufferfish, human
ADAMTS1 and -5 are located in tandem on chromosome
21, and human ADAMTS8 and -15, on chromosome 11
(Figure 3). The remaining genes have additional introns at
conserved locations, and both proteins in each set of pairs
have the same intron/exon structure.
Thus, by combining the phylogenetic analysis and intron/
exon structure determinations, we are able to propose the
following series of events leading to the ADAMTS protein
family (Figure 4): (i) The ancestral ADAMTS gene duplicated prior to the divergence of the ecdysozoan and chordate lineages, approximately 673 million years ago [68].
(ii) In the following approximately 250 million years
prior to divergence of fish and mammals [69], multiple
gene duplications occurred. (iii) A retrotransposition of
the common ancestor of the ADAMTS9 and -20 gene pair
resulted in an intronless gene that proceeded to gain multiple introns, giving rise to the angiogenesis/aggrecanase
clade. (iv) This gene was involved in a duplicative
chromosomal inversion, and later a duplication of the
chromosomal segment containing both ADAMTS genes.
(v) Another intron was gained, in ADAMTS8, prior to the
divergence of the pufferfish and mammalian lineages. In
the other branch of the ADAMTS family, we see a remarkable frequency of genes located on chromosome 5, suggesting it as the location of the ancestor of these genes. We

can speculate that a similar scenario of within-chromosome duplication followed by duplication of chromosomal segments took place, although none are in as close
physical proximity as the ADAMTS1-subfamily genes.

Conclusions
This comprehensive bioinformatic survey of the human
genome affirms the widely held belief, derived from
experimental work, that the nineteen known human
ADAMTS proteins constitute the complete gene family. By
examining both the amino acid sequences using rigorous
phylogenetic methods and comparing the exon structure
of these proteins, we were able to draw conclusions about
the evolutionary history of this family of proteins which,
in turn, provides a framework for further analysis of the
functions of these clinically-relevant genes.

Methods
Gene discovery
Sequences of ADAMTS homolog sequences presented
here were identified from 2001 to 2004 using genomic
sequences cataloged in the NCBI, JGI (Fugu and Ciona
[52,70]) and Celera genome databases using BLASTp,
BLASTn, BLASTx, tBLASTn and tBLASTx searches [71]. We
searched databases of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) for
all human genes and, with the exception of ADAMTS15,
found ESTs that corresponded to those genes, confirming
their transcription. Splice site predictions were made by
neural network via the Berkeley Drosophila Genome
Project and also by eye using Sequencher 4.2 (Genecodes), with reference to protein multiple sequence alignments. We used the same method to identify
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Fugu
rubripes homologs of ADAMTS genes, and their genomic
structure. Multiple sequence alignments of the inferred
amino acid sequences were prepared using Multalin [72]
and ClustalX1.81 [73] and manually refined and annotated within BioEdit [74] and MacClade4.06 [75].
Phylogenetic analysis
Initial phylogenetic analyses were conducted including all
of the human ADAMTS proteins along with seven invertebrate homologs, three from Drosophila melanogaster and
four from Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 1A), and then
these analyses were repeated with the most divergent
invertebrate sequences removed (Figure 1B). The datasets
for these analyses were comprised of 359 and 543 unambiguously aligned amino acid sites, respectively. The
alignments were analyzed using parsimony and distance
methods. Parsimony analyses used a heuristic search with
random stepwise addition of data and tree-bisectionreconnection in PAUP*4.0b10 for 1000 bootstrap replicates [76]. Distance matrices were inferred using the
Jones, Taylor, Thornton (JTT) substitution model with
PROTDIST in PHYLIP 3.6a3 [77,78]. Neighbor-joining

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/11

trees were constructed with the input order jumbled for
1000 bootstrap replicates using NEIGHBOR, SEQBOOT
and CONSENSE in PHYLIP. Using Tree-Puzzle 5.0 [79]
we generated maximum-likelihood distance matrices in
which among-site substitution rate heterogeneity was corrected using an invariable and eight gamma-distributed
substitution rate categories and the JTT model. 10,000
quartet-puzzling steps were also used (Tree-Puzzle) to
assess branch support.
To better resolve the evolutionary relationships of the vertebrate ADAMTS subfamily members and to provide
information on their presence in other chordate lineages,
sequences from Mus, Fugu and Ciona were identified and
added to the alignment and phylogenetic analysis. An
annotated ADAMTS homolog from the honeybee Apis
mellifera was also included in the analysis as another representative invertebrate. 571 unambiguously aligned
amino acid sites of ADAMTS-homologous sequences
encoded by Homo, Mus, Fugu, Ciona, Apis, Drosophila and
Caenorhabditis were analyzed (Figure 2). MrBayes3.0 [80]
was used to construct a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree from this protein alignment. MrBayes was run
for 1000000 generations, with four incrementally heated
Markov chains, and a sampling frequency of 1000 generations. The temperature setting was increased to 0.5.
Among-site substitution rate heterogeneity was corrected
using an invariable and eight gamma-distributed substitution rate categories and the WAG model for amino acid
substitutions [81], abbreviated herein as WAG+I+8Γ. The
consensus ML tree topology, the arithmetic mean log-likelihood (lnL) for this topology, and branch support were
estimated from the set of sampled trees with the best posterior probabilities. Means and 95% confidence intervals
for the gamma distribution shape parameter α and the
proportion of invariable sites (pI) were also estimated.
