Abstract
Background: Evolutionary genomics requires management and filtering of large numbers of
diverse genomic sequences for accurate analysis and inference on evolutionary processes of
genomic and functional change. We developed Evolutionary Genomics and Biodiversity (EGenBio;
http://egenbio.lsu.edu) to begin to address this.
Description: EGenBio is a system for manipulation and filtering of large numbers of sequences,
integrating curated sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, managing evolutionary analyses,
and visualizing their output. EGenBio is organized into three conceptual divisions, Evolution,
Genomics, and Biodiversity. The Genomics division includes tools for selecting pre-aligned sequences
from different genes and species, and for modifying and filtering these alignments for further
analysis. Species searches are handled through queries that can be modified based on a tree-based
navigation system and saved. The Biodiversity division contains tools for analyzing individual
sequences or sequence alignments, whereas the Evolution division contains tools involving
phylogenetic trees. Alignments are annotated with analytical results and modification history using
our PRAED format. A miscellaneous Tools section and Help framework are also available. EGenBio
was developed around our comparative genomic research and a prototype database of mtDNA
genomes. It utilizes MySQL-relational databases and dynamic page generation, and calls numerous
custom programs.
Conclusion: EGenBio was designed to serve as a platform for tools and resources to ease
combined analysis in evolution, genomics, and biodiversity.

Background
Large-scale genomic technologies have generated an
extraordinary amount of data in the past few decades.
Consequently, a huge effort has been made toward creating biological databases and systems to organize, analyze,
and share information with the world-wide community
[1-4]. The application of genomic technologies to molecular evolution has opened new frontiers in the interdisciplinary field of evolutionary genomics, and this has given
rise to a great potential to elucidate complex questions in
biology [2,5]. Understanding of evolutionary processes is
critical, since they determine the sequence, structure, and
function of macromolecules, and ultimately shape the
higher-level biological complexity of organisms.
Genomic biodiversity has been defined as dense sampling
of molecular data from diverse taxonomic groups for large
genomic regions or complete genomes [6], and inferences
concerning evolutionary processes are greatly improved
by adopting combined molecular and computational
approaches that include a large amount of genomic biodiversity [6-9]. We have found that the study of evolutionary
genomics in the context of a dense sampling of species
gives rise to many unique data processing problems, and
so have developed the Evolutionary Genomics and Biodiversity (EGenBio) project as a web-based system to simplify large-scale evolutionary data management.
The central aim of EGenBio is to provide integrated analysis and visualization of raw sequence data, alignments,
and phylogenetic trees, to rapidly curate and annotate that
data, and to filter that data based on these annotations for
further analysis of specific genomic contexts. It is designed
to be robust to change and easily extensible to other datasets and other analytical programs. To accomplish this,
EGenBio has web-based interfaces designed to: (1) access
computational tools for phylogenetic and evolutionary
analyses; (2) facilitate the construction of large-scale
sequence and alignment datasets across diverse taxa; and
(3) provide a framework for comparative analysis of
diverse genes and genomes. EGenBio may also serve to
promote the utility of increases in the scale of genomic
biodiversity.

Overview
The three conceptual divisions of EGenBio (Evolution,
Genomics, and Biodiversity) serve to organize web-based
access to the primary custom-built tools (Figure 1, Table
1). The Genomics division provides access to pre-aligned
sequence databases, and serves as a means of flexibly
selecting genes and species/genomes of interest and producing a concatenated and annotated alignment for use in
further analysis. The data is stored in a MySQL database
and accessed "on the fly". Our prototype database contains complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes that are

mostly obtained from NCBI RefSeq annotations [10], but
also contains "pre-submission" genomes provided by
other investigators. Private access to "pre-submission"
genomes allows users to pre-integrate their data with publicly available data for analysis in the primary genome
publication, and is available on request. Complex
searches can be stored, and registered users can create a
personal list of searches that are retained in memory.
Alignments for protein-coding genes are based on their
amino acid sequences using ClustalW [11], but either
amino acid or nucleotide alignments can be selected. The
Biodiversity division is a collection of tools for analysis of
alignments or sets of sequences (Table 1). These tools do
not require a phylogenetic tree. Examples include lists of
sequences available, database summaries, graphical representation of gene order information, and summary information on selected or uploaded alignments. This section
also includes tools to aid experimental analysis of evolutionary genomics predictions, such as generating primers
that represent all possible permutations of a set of
sequences, or generating degenerate primers that reflect a
sample from a posterior probability prediction of a particular ancestral sequence. The Evolution division includes
tools (Table 1) that incorporate or extract information
from phylogenetic trees and that translate from accession
numbers to human-readable labels for sequences (e.g.,
genus species designations, or common names of organisms). This division also includes access to programs for
processing and visualization of alignment filters
(described below), coevolutionary analysis [12,13], and
saturation mutagenesis analysis [14].
In addition to the three main sections, EGenBio contains a
Tools section that serves as a repository for small standalone tools that may also exist as components of other
pages, or which serve other simple purposes. The Help link
leads not to a separate section, but rather to what we will
call a separate "framework". The structure of the Help
framework mirrors the main framework exactly, but
instead of linking to actual tools, Help pages link to
detailed descriptions and documentation for each page.
Invisible to most users, a hidden Design framework allows
for rapid editing and movement of page and site structure
information from design to laboratory testing stages, and
finally to public access.

Discussion and Conclusion
EGenBio is a web-based system for analysis in evolutionary genomics and biodiversity. It provides tools and
resources for quickly creating, modifying, and analyzing
large alignment datasets in ways that we have found useful in our own computer-based and experimental evolutionary genomics research. Our prototype database of
complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes represents
the densest complete set of genes currently available from

closely related organisms. It can be accessed flexibly
according to comma-separated queries or a phylogenetic
tree navigation system. EGenBio is designed to be easily
extensible to use with other protein complexes and other
analytical programs. Our goal is to incorporate and utilize
as many existing programs as possible, and to develop

only "added value" programs. In the current public version, all tools are novel to our system except that alignments are created using ClustalW [11]. The PRAED
alignment annotation system based on data filters allows
alignments to be modified easily according to user interest
in annotation features, and allows for the results of anal-

yses to be returned as further annotations on the alignments. Since it is derived from the NEXUS format, it is
easy to add batch commands to direct analyses using
many common phylogenetic analysis programs. The
PRAED format and data filters are a unique feature of the
EGenBio system.
Future modules under development in EGenBio include
the creation of additional data filters, incorporation of
more genes for analysis of functional divergence, development of further visualization tools for statistical analyses
of evolutionary dynamics, and automated procedures for
analysis using existing programs and tools. We also welcome feedback from the scientific community on areas of
general need for integrated evolutionary genomics tools.
EGenBio is publicly available and can be accessed at http:/
/egenbio.lsu.edu/ via anonymous login. User accounts
that allow users to save search parameters and results are
provided upon request. Incorporation and private access
to pre-publication data can also be accommodated upon
request. Replication of the EGenBio system would require
a Linux-based operating system capable of running Perl,
Perl-GD, R, PHP, MySQL, and an Apache web server. It

would also require installation of numerous custom
scripts in addition to ClustalW.
