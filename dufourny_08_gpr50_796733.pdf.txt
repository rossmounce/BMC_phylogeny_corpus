Abstract
Background: The melatonin receptor subfamily contains three members Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c,
found in all vertebrates except for Mel1c which is found only in fish, Xenopus species and the
chicken. Another receptor, the melatonin related receptor known as GPR50, found exclusively in
mammals and later identified as a member of the melatonin receptor subfamily because of its
identity to the three melatonin receptors despite its absence of affinity for melatonin. The aim of
this study was to describe the evolutionary relationships between GPR50 and the three other
members of the melatonin receptor subfamily.
Results: Using an in silico approach, we demonstrated that GPR50 is the ortholog of the high
affinity Mel1c receptor. It was necessary to also study the synteny of this gene to reach this
conclusion because classical mathematical models that estimate orthology and build phylogenetic
trees were not sufficient. The receptor has been deeply remodelled through evolution by the
mutation of numerous amino acids and by the addition of a long C-terminal tail. These alterations
have modified its affinity for melatonin and probably affected its interactions with the other two
known melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 that are encoded by Mel1a and Mel1b genes
respectively. Evolutionary studies provided evidence that the GPR50 group evolved under different
selective pressure as compared to the orthologous groups Me11 a, b, and c.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that there are only three members in the melatonin
receptor subfamily with one of them (Me11c) undergoing rapid evolution from fishes and birds to
mammals. Further studies are necessary to investigate the physiological roles of this receptor.

Background
The melatonin receptor family belongs to the super family
of G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and contains 3
known subtypes, Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c [1-4]. The
genes for these receptors contain two exons separated by a
large intron [2,3]. The Mel1a gene is found on chromosome 4 in the chicken and human, Mel1c is also found on
chromosome 4 in chicken (it is not found in the human),
while Mel1b is encoded on chromosome 1 in the chicken
and on chromosome 11 in the human. These 3 receptors
all bind melatonin with a high affinity (KD = 10 to 200
pM) [5,6]. Among them only Mel1a and Mel1b have been
cloned and characterized in mammals [7,8] and have
been renamed MT1 and MT2 by the International Union
of Pharmacology (IUPHAR). In contrast, Mel1c has been
found only in fish, the chicken and Xenopus [4]. The three
receptors (MT1, MT2 and Mel1c) share about 60%
sequence identity and BRET studies showed that MT1 and
MT2 receptors could form heterodimers [9].
In eutherian mammals, a previously known orphan receptor GPR50 was identified as a melatonin-related receptor
because it has 45% identity with the melatonin receptor
family [10]. However GPR50 is encoded by a gene located
on the X chromosome and does not bind melatonin [11].
A recent study demonstrated that GPR50 can heterodimerize with MT1 and MT2 receptors [12], leading to
a suppression of MT1 but not MT2, affinity for melatonin.
Interestingly GPR50 has only been found in eutherian
mammals and not in fish or birds.
The aim of this study was to understand the phylogenetic
evolution of the melatonin receptor family and more specifically of the Mel1c and GPR50 genes using an in silico
approach. Studying the phylogenetic tree of the melatonin receptor family and tracking the synteny of genes
surrounding Mel1c in several species strongly suggested
that the Mel1c gene found in fish and avian species is the
ortholog of the eutherian GPR50 gene. This interpretation
was further supported by estimation of selection pressure
and by a gene structure analysis of the Mel1c and GPR50
genes.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the melatonin receptors
The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1A–E, built from the NCBI
protein database using chicken Mel1c protein as the query,
showed that there are four groups of orthologous genes
corresponding to GPR50, MT1, MT2 and Mel1c. The
GPR50 gene was only detected in mammalian genomes
(Fig. 1B). In contrast, the Mel1c gene was only detected in
fish species, Xenopus and chicken genomes confirming
previous results [1,4] (Fig. 1E). Noticeably, prototherian
and metatherian species appeared in Mel1c (platypus) or
GPR50 (oppossum) branches (Fig. 1B, E). Note that sev-

eral bootstrap values are low suggesting that the robustness of the tree is questionable.
Branch lengths are correlated with the evolutionary rate of
the sequence [13] and branch length values were clearly
higher for the GPR50 orthology group than for the other
three groups. These results suggest that sequences from
the GPR50 group evolved faster than those from MT1,
MT2 or Mel1c groups.
Analyses of selection pressure were performed to provide
insights into functional constraints applied at sequence
level to the GPR50 group. The branch-site model A was
applied to test evolutionary shift using the Maximum
Likelihood method. The branch leading to the GPR50
group was labelled as the foreground branch and all others as background branches in the phylogenetic tree.
Parameter estimates under model A suggested that 71% of
sites evolved under purifying selection (ω0 = 0) whereas
29% sites were identified under the neutrality assumption. Likelihood Ratio Tests (LTRs) were highly significant
with P < 0.0001 (2∆l = 24.7 and df = 2) when the model
A was compared to the null model M1a (neutral). Thus,
the model did not find evidence for positive selection and
that, on average, numerous sites (~25%) evolved without
functional constraint.
In order to test if positive selection occurred in different
lineages along the phylogeny, others branches (leading to
Mel1a, b, c orthologous groups) were labelled as foreground branches. The calculations are summarized in
Table 1. All the LRTs gave significant results. Compared to
the GPR50 group, the percentage of sites evolving under
purifying selection was higher, particularly for the Mel1c
group (~95%). Remarkably, the percentage of sites evolving under neutrality for GPR50 was ~28%, contrary to the
Mel1a, b, and c groups whose percentages were ~3%. Positive selection was detected in the Mel1a, b, c groups. The
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis identified 1, 4 and 1
sites respectively, under positive selection along branches
leading to Mel1a, b, c, at a probability of >95%. Amino
acids under positive selection are reported in Table 1.
Analysis of Mel1c synteny
In order to test whether Mel1c and GPR 50 genes were lost
in mammals and in non-mammals species respectively,
we carried out a study of the synteny of these genes. At the
Mel1c gene locus on chicken chromosome 4 the following
group of genes encoding bHLHPAS, Mel1c, HMG2A,
CD99 molecule like 2 and myotubularin related protein
were displayed (Fig. 2). For clarity, accession numbers of
these genes and their orthologs in different species are
summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, synteny has been
best conserved in mammals where the chromosomal
locus containing Me11c is found on the X chromosome

(from Ensembl.org website) (Fig. 2). Except for minor
changes among species (for example, the insertion of the
gene for Ribosomal protein 19 between the genes for
GPR50 and HMG in man) this synteny analysis clearly
shows that, despite rapid evolution of the coding region
of interest, Mel1c evolved into GPR50 in eutherian mammals. A BLAST analysis against all the available mammalian genomes did not reveal any "fossilized" pseudogenes
of Mel1c at this locus in any species, strengthening the
notion that the Mel1c ancestral gene was not duplicated in
mammals to allow the emergence of GPR50 and of a lost
Mel1c pseudogene. Interestingly, this rapid evolution was
also observed in neighbouring genes, i.e. 2610030H06
Rik [see Additional file 1] and HMG2A [see Additional file
2] whose phylogenetic trees show either poor bootstrap
values
(HMG2A)
or
an
odd
organization
(2610030H06Rik). This synteny approach represented
therefore a powerful tool to elucidate the orthology relationships between fast evolving genes.
Sequence alignments between paralogs of the melatonin
receptor family, and sequence identity analysis
The percentage of identically aligned amino acids
between MT1, MT2, and Mel1c/GPR50 from five species
(Xenopus laevis (Xl), Gallus gallus (Gg), Monodelphis domestica (Md), Mus musculus (Mm), Homo sapiens (Hs)) are presented in Table 3. The greatest sequence identity among
the orthologous genes was observed for MT1 where more
than 75% of the amino acid alignment has been conserved if we exclude Xenopus laevis.

Mutagenesis studies performed either on the human [1417] or ovine MT1 receptor [18] and studies using human
chimeric GPR50/MT1 receptor constructs [19,20] have
shown several highly conserved residues in transmem-

brane helices that are critical for ligand binding especially
those in transmembrane helix III (TMIII: S110, G258)
(Fig. 3). In addition, mutation of the N124 within the specific NRY signature of the melatonin receptor group,
located just downstream of TMIII dramatically impairs
receptor function (binding affinity, control of cAMP level
and regulation of ion channel activity [21]). In the same
way, key amino-acid residues in the ligand binding pocket
of the MT2 receptor are located in transmembrane helices
IV (N175), V (V204, V208), VI (G271, L272) and VII
(Y298) ([22,23]; Fig. 3). These residues are extremely conserved among species and receptor subtypes. It is worth
noting that some key amino acids for melatonin binding
that are found in helix VI of the MT1 receptor (G258) and
of the MT2 (G271, L272) are substituted by T257 and
V258 respectively in human GPR50 (Fig. 3A)
Structural evolution of Mel1c into GPR50
Sequence alignments of the orthologous genes Mel1c and
GPR50 (Fig. 4) reveal the addition of a long C terminal
domain in the GPR50 receptor. As a consequence, the
largest discrepancies between the sequence alignment of
amino acids was observed for the Mel1c and GPR50
orthologs where the sequence identity ranged from 45%
to 79% (Table 3). This led us to compare the gene structure of the Me11c and GPR50 receptors.

Study of Mel1c structures in several species using BLAT
software revealed a common gene organization in the
zebra fish and the chicken where Mel1c was coded by 2
exons (Fig. 5). The structure of the GPR50 gene was very
similar in mouse and man where it also contained 2
exons, but the first exon is segmented into 4 smaller exons
in the horse. In contrast, the GPR50 gene in the opossum
was made up of 7 smaller exons. The C-terminal fragment

5 in zebra fish and on chromosome 4 in chicken while they are found on chromosome X in other depicted species. Please note
that synteny is mostly conserved for bHLHPAS, 2610030H06 RIK, Mel1c, HMG2A, CD99, and myotubularin related protein in
opossum and mammalian species despite the integration of new genes coding for hypothetical proteins (opossum, chimpanzee,
cow), ribosomal proteins (dog, chimpanzee, man), NGFI-A binding protein (chimpanzee, man), Utbf (mouse) and MAGE (cattle) proteins. It is also of note that several genes surrounding Mel1c in zebra fish (pdcd8, nono, and the two hypothetical proteins) present high identities with genes found on chromosome X in mouse but not in the GPR50 locus (unpublished data).

in 3' position in eutherian mammals replaces the stop
codon found in the chicken and zebra fish; the fragment
starts at the 3' end with a SxL amino acid sequence, S
being amino acid 328 in the mouse, 320 in man and 525
in the horse (Fig. 5). Analysis of this extension to the Cterminus of the receptor using a bidimensionnal Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA; hydrophobic residues
gathered into clusters, typical of regular secondary structures) identified a repeated sequence between amino
acids 398 and 466 (Fig. 6). This repeated sequence is
organized around a degenerated heptapeptide. The first
and last positions of the heptad are generally occupied by

an aromatic amino acid, the sixth position by an aliphatic,
hydrophobic amino acid, and the second and fifth positions are occupied by a basic amino acid (generally K) and
by a hydroxyl amino acid (generally S). One of the ten
repeats has a single amino acid insertion (S) between the
fifth and sixth positions. This repeat heptad is reminiscent
of the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), with which it well aligned (Fig. 6). The
RNAPII CTD also has an unusual extension, outside the
catalytic core of the largest subunit of the enzyme, that
serves as a flexible binding scaffold for numerous factors
that regulate transcription-related events (for reviews, see

[24,25]). The binding of factors to the RNAPII CTD is
determined by the pattern of phosphorylation, which
principally occurs at Ser2 and Ser5 of the repeat. Worth
noting, is that the second and fifth positions in GPR50
repeats include amino acids that are highly conserved. A
serine is also highly conserved in the fifth position, as for
RNAPII CTD, whereas a basic amino acid (K or R) is invariably conserved in the second position instead of a serine.
This conserved pattern in GPR50 together with its similarity to RNAPII CTD, suggests that GPR50 repeats might
also constitute a flexible scaffold for the binding of partner(s) that recognize specific phosphorylation sites. The
GPR50 heptad repeat is followed by a ~100 amino acid
domain. And from HCA analysis the domain is predicted
to be structured. However, this domain is unusually rich
in serine and threonine residues and many other repeated
sequences (e.g. a SH dipeptide is repeated five times at

non regular intervals). These sequences are probably in
specific structures and functions.

Discussion
Using an in silico approach, we have demonstrated in this
study, that Mel1c, the gene for a high affinity melatonin
binding receptor found in the chicken and in Xenopus,
rapidly evolved into GPR50 gene in eutherian mammals.
The GPR50 gene encodes a receptor that does not bind
melatonin but affects the interaction of this hormone
with its cognate MT1 receptor after dimerization.
Analysis of the phylogenetic tree of the melatonin receptor family suggested that Mel1c is not present in mammals. Two evolutionary hypotheses are possible. The first,
is duplication of the Mel1c/GPR50 ancestral gene before
the emergence of vertebrate species. One of these genes
evolved into the Mel1c gene of fish species, Xenopus and

the chicken, the GPR50 gene being lost in these species,
while in mammals, the ancestral gene evolved into GPR50
and the Mel1c gene was lost. This hypothesis implies the
existence of a Mel1c pseudogene in mammals and a
GPR50 pseudogene in fishes, Xenopus and chicken. A
similar pathway exists for the zona pellucida gene family
[26] where the ZPAX and ZPD genes have been lost in
mammals. However, careful analysis of BLAST data
against all the genomes studied failed to find any evidence
for "fossilized" genes for GPR50 or Mel1c for example, a
residual exon with a stop codon or a deletion. Thus it is
unlikely that Mel1c/GPR50 evolved as a consequence of
gene duplication. The second more likely hypothesis is
that the Mel1c gene evolved rapidly into GPR50 gene in
mammals by the mutation of several critical amino acids
and by the addition of a C-terminal sequence. A condition
for this hypothesis to be true is that the Mel1c and GPR50
genes are surrounded by the same genes, in the syntenic
genomic regions of the chicken, opossum and mammalian genomes. This conserved synteny has been clearly
highlighted in our results. In this regard, the Mel1c/
GPR50 gene is located close to a break in the synteny of
the chromosome. Breaks of synteny zones are associated
with regions of chromosomal instability in rodents [27].
Navarro and Barton (2003) have also demonstrated that
the Ka/Ks ratio is higher for genes located on chromosomes that underwent structural rearrangements between
the human and the chimpanzee compared with colinear
chromosomes [28]. It is therefore possible that a link

exists between the rapid evolution of Mel1c into GPR50
gene in mammals and its close vicinity to a site of structural rearrangement in the chromosome.
Considering the rapid evolutionary process of Mel1c into
GPR50, two interesting features are worth highlighting.
The first is the loss of affinity of GPR50 for melatonin. It
is widely assumed that G protein-coupled receptors and
among them, the melatonin receptors, share the same
structure as rhodopsin in which predicted critical residues
for ligand binding to the appropriate binding pocket are
located in the transmembrane regions [29]. Mutagenesis
studies performed either on human MT1 or MT2 receptors
have shown that several transmembrane amino-acid are
critical for the binding of melatonin. Among these, the
critical amino acids for melatonin binding G258 in helix
VI of MT1 and G271 and L272 of MT2 are replaced by
T257 and V258 in human GPR50. Interestingly, these
amino acid substitutions have probably evolved under
conditions of neutrality strengthening the neutral evolution theory of Kimura [30], even if at present, there no
available tools to confirm this theory. Our results show
that five other separate sites (one, four and one amino
acids for MT1, MT2 and Mel1c respectively) also underwent rapid evolution under positive selection. One of
these amino acids (L183), in the second extracellular loop
of the GPR50, has replaced S or T in all melatonin receptor
subtypes of all species except in Esox lucius MT2 (A197).
Whether or not these amino acid substitutions have actu-

ally led to the loss of affinity of the GPR50 for melatonin
may be confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. To
explain the loss of affinity of GPR50 for melatonin, we
observed that the amino substituted under positive selection were surprisingly not the ones identified as being
important for high affinity binding. The 3D structural
model reveals that both types of sites (positively selected
sites and sites important for melatonin binding),
although distinct, are close to each other leading to potential impairment of ligand binding. The GPR50, 3D model
also shows that three of the sites under positive selection
are located at the external membrane surface of the receptor. At this position they might be able to "gate" the receptor ligand pocket and therefore contribute to loss of
affinity of GPR50 for melatonin.
The second intriguing feature of Mel1c/GPR50 evolution
is the addition of the long C-terminal tail. This region may
have also contributed to the functional differences
between GPR50 and Mel1c. This CTD shows no signs of
rapid evolution because it is well conserved among mammals. It is of note that the opossum GPR50 gene con-

tained four more exons coding for the CTD of this
receptor than eutherian mammals. However, PSI-BLAST
did not reveal any significant homology of the last 4 exons
with a known protein suggesting that this CTD appeared
after the divergence of non-eutherian and eutherian mammals. The physiological function of this CTD remains to
be established.
Despite the functional difference between GPR50 and
Mel1c no positive selection was detected suggesting that
functional shifts not always correlated with positive selection or that the model used for detecting positive selection
is unable to discriminate sufficiently. However, the percentage of sites in the GPR50 group (~28%) that on average, evolve under neutrality allows us to hypothesize that
relaxed selection is linked to functional change. This percentage for the branch leading to the Mel1a, b, c groups is
~3% suggesting that the melatonin receptor family has a
divergent evolutionary history. Currently, only a few
examples of relaxed or positive selection have been related
to functional shifts but the role of the environment in
gene evolution must be statistically examined before any

rapid evolution in vertebrates. However the precise significance of this evolution still needs to be clarified.

such claims can be substantiated [31]. Key insights into
understanding the role of the environment on the evolution of GPR50 would be gained by pinpointing the selective advantage conferred in mammals by the change.
Determining the physiological roles of this receptor is
therefore critical to the testing of this hypothesis.
The rapid evolution of Mel1c into GPR50 is associated
with a change in the physiological role of the the pineal
gland, from a directly photosensitive organ with its own
photoreceptors in most non-mammalian vertebrates into
an indirectly photosensitive neuroendocrine gland in
mammals [32]. Moreover, there is a difference between
fishes and mammals in the cellular pathways inducing
genes in the pineal gland. One is the recently described
orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erb α [33]. This gene is regulated by orthodenticle homeobox 5 (Otx5) through a Pineal Expression Related Element (PERE) that is found in
fish species and Xenopus but not in mammals [33].
Nishio and co-workers suggest that Rev-erb α gene expression in the pineal underwent a major functional shift in
mammals. Interestingly, it was previously reported that
Otx5 family of genes undergoes rapid evolution in mammalian lineages where they are known as Crx genes, with
a restricted distribution compared to Otx genes [34].
Taken together with our data, these results suggest that
some components of the photoresponsive network, from
the genes expressed in the pineal gland to melatonin
receptors in the hypothalamus, underwent particularly

The functional significance Mel1c and its evolution into
into GPR50 are unclear partly because of the lack of
knowledge concerning the role of Mel1c receptors in the
intracellular transduction of the melatonin signal. Moreover, the physiological regulation [35,36] and function
[12,36-38] of GPR50 receptors remain largely unknown
despite a recent paper indicating an altered metabolic
phenotype of GPR50 knockout mice [36]. Interestingly,
Mel1c and GPR50 receptors do not share the same distributions in the brain. In the chicken, Mel1c is widely
spread in the brain [4], while in mammals GPR50 has
been observed in hypothalamo-pituitary regions, for
example dorsomedial hypothalamus in the rodent
[36,39] and the pars tuberalis in the human and the sheep
[10,11], a noticeable exception is the ependymal cell layer
of the third ventricle where strong GPR50 expression is
seen in all species examined to date [35,36]. This altered
pattern of expression and the loss of affinity for melatonin
is probably not a neutral physiological event with respect
to melatonin signalling. Melatonin is secreted throughout
the period of darkness and the duration of its secretion
mimics daylength during the year [40]. This signal constitutes a chemical transduction of the time of the year and
is a critical factor for the regulation of seasonal functions
such as moulting, hibernation and reproduction in mammals (for reviews see: [41,42]). It is intriguing that GPR50
is present mainly in the ependymal cell layer of the third
ventricle [11,35,43], where cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of melatonin are up to 20 times higher than in blood
[44]. In addition, levels of GPR50 in ependymal cells of
Siberian hamsters are lower under photoperiodic conditions that mimic short days [35]. A recently published in
vitro study reported decreased function of the MT1 receptor after heterodimerization with GPR50 because of an
interaction of the C-terminal tail of GPR50 with regulatory proteins of MT1 receptors [12]. It is thus tempting to
speculate that the photoperiodic modulation of GPR50
regulates the function of the MT1 receptor by altering its
affinity for melatonin, and hence modulates physiological responses elicited by this receptor. A critical test of
such a hypothesis is to determine if MT1 receptors are in
the ependymal cell layer of the third ventricle. Presently
this is difficult because there is not a suitable MT1 receptor
antibody and because of low levels of MT1 mRNA [42].

Conclusion
In conclusion, this work has shown that the methodology
allowing the building of phylogenetic trees may not be
sufficient to define the orthological relationships among
genes that evolve rapidly, and that studying synteny is
often necessary to decipher the relationships among genes
of a family. When applied to the family of melatonin

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:105

receptor genes, this approach allowed us to demonstrate
that the high affinity melatonin receptor Mel1c found in
non mammalian species is present in the genomes of
mammalian species where it has been named GPR50. This
receptor has been extensively remodelled through evolution by the mutation of numerous critical amino acids
and by the addition of a long C-terminal tail. These alterations have modified the affinity of GPR50 for melatonin
and probably affected its interactions with the two functional melatonin receptors, MT1 and MT2, in mammals.
Further studies are required to determine the physiological roles of the GPR50 receptor.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
We performed the phylogenetic analysis using the phylogenomic analysis pipeline available in FIGENIX platform
[45,46]. The FIGENIX platform retrieved sequences, provided multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic reconstruction and deduced orthology and paralogy
relationships (for a detailed description of pipelines and
models used, see [46]). The chicken Mel1c protein
sequence (346 aa) was extracted from NCBI (accession
no. NP_990692.1) and entered in the phylogenomic
inference task, which was run with the default parameters
and with Ensembl or NCBI protein database. We also
built trees of chicken Mel1c flanking protein sequences:
2610030H06 Rik (Accession number NM_001031127.1)
and HMG2A (Accession number XM_001235453.1). We
chose the NJ topology for the figures. The trees (npl) are
the fusion of three phylogenetic trees built based on
Neighbour joining [47], maximum Parsimony and maximum Likelihood [48]. The Dayhoff PAM matrix [49] provided the distance matrix for the NJ method. The
evolutionary distance separating sequences is defined as
the number of mutational events per site underlying the
evolutionary history separating the sequences. Thus, evolutionary relations among sequences are represented by a
tree structure where branch length represents the evolutionary distance [13]. In Fig 1, and in additional files 1
and 2, for each node, bootstrap values are reported for
each npl method. Bootstrapping was carried out with
1000 replications.
Evolutionary shift analysis
The protein sequences were aligned using Clustal W [50].
Correspondence between protein alignment and each
DNA sequence was established using the Wise2 software
package followed by manual adjustments [51]. The final
alignment contained 783 codons and 52 aligned
sequences: The codeml program of the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood [52]) 3.15 software package was applied to test evolutionary shift, PAML
uses a Maximum Likelihood algorithm to assign likelihood scores to different models for selection. We first

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/105

used the model A that enables ω (= dN/dS) to vary both
between sites and between lineages, and was implemented in the maximum likelihood framework [53].
Branches a, b, c and d were independently labeled as foreground branches, and all remaining branches were
labeled as background branches (see Fig. 1). This model
was then used to construct likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by
comparison with the null model (site model M1a neutral).
Analysis of Mel1c synteny
We examined the synteny of genes flanking Me11c on
chicken chromosome 4: bHLH-PAS (XM_420353.2),
2610030H06
(NM_001031127.1),
HMG2A
(XM_001235453.1),
CD99
molecule
like
2
(XM_420355.2) and myotubularin related protein
(XM_420356.2). These genes are found on chromosome
4 whose synteny in mammals is found on chromosome X
[54]. Using the "TBLASTN" software [55], proteins were
related to sequences of the genome of the opossum (Monodelphis domestica), dog (Canis familiaris), mouse (Mus
musculus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), human (Homo
sapiens) and cattle (Bos taurus) (Fig. 2). For clarity, accession numbers of species examined for different gene
orthologs are summarized in Table 2. For comparison, the
synteny of genes flanking Mel1c found on zebra fish
(Danio rerio) chromosome 5 were also added (Fig. 2).
Using the TBLASTN software, we found several genes surrounding Me11c in that species (pdcd8, nono, and the
two hypothetical proteins) with a high percentage identity
with genes on chromosome X of the mouse but at different loci than GPR50 (data not shown).
Multiple sequence alignments (MT1, MT2, Mel1c and
GPR50)
Multiple alignments of the amino-acid sequences of
Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c/GPR50 were performed using
the Clustal W software available at the EMBL-European
Bioinformatics institutes web site [56] (Figs. 3 and 4).
Sequence identity analysis
Amino acid sequences of Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c/GPR50
for Xenopus laevis, Gallus gallus, Monodelphis domestica, Mus
Musculus and Homo sapiens were aligned by pairs using the
Smith-Watermann local alignment (EMBOSS) software
[57]. The program compares protein sequences and calculates the statistical significance of matches. For each alignment, we focused on the percentage of amino acid
identity (Table 3).
Gene structure analysis of GPR50
Protein sequences coding for Mel1c in chicken and zebra
fish and for GPR50 in opossum, mouse, horse and man
were run through the "BLAT" software [58] to deduce the
gene structure (Fig. 5)

Analysis of the C-terminal extension of GPR50
The sequence of the C-terminal extension of human
GPR50 does not share any obvious similarity with other
proteins available in database search sensitive programs
such as PSI-BLAST [59]. The bi-dimensional method of
sequence analysis, called Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis
[60,61], which efficiently combines analysis of the 1D
and 2D structures, was used to explore further the GRP50
C-terminal extension. This led to the identification of
repeated sequences, which are described in the Results
section (Fig. 6)

GPR50 homology modelling
A model of the three-dimensional structure of the GPR50
transmembrane domain was obtained using the high resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (pdb 1F88)
as a template. The multiple alignment of bovine rhodopsin with MT1, MT2 and GPR50, shown in Fig. 3, was
performed using MAFFT [62] and refined using Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA; [60]). This alignment is
similar to that reported by Rivara et al. for MT1 and MT2
receptor models [63]. The three-dimensional models (Fig.
3) were generated using MODELLER [64] and their stereochemical quality checked using PROCHECK [65].
