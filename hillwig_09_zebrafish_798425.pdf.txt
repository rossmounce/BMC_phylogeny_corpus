Abstract
Background: Members of the Ribonuclease (RNase) T2 family are common models for
enzymological studies, and their evolution has been well characterized in plants. This family of acidic
RNases is widespread, with members in almost all organisms including plants, animals, fungi,
bacteria and even some viruses. While several biological functions have been proposed for these
enzymes in plants, their role in animals is unknown. Interestingly, in vertebrates most of the
biological roles of plant RNase T2 proteins are carried out by members of a different family, RNase
A. Still, RNase T2 proteins are conserved in these animals
Results: As a first step to shed light on the role of animal RNase T2 enzymes, and to understand
the evolution of these proteins while co-existing with the RNase A family, we characterized RNase
Dre1 and RNase Dre2, the two RNase T2 genes present in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome.
These genes are expressed in most tissues examined, including high expression in all stages of
embryonic development, and their expression corresponds well with the presence of acidic RNase
activities in every tissue analyzed. Embryo expression seems to be a conserved characteristic of
members of this family, as other plant and animal RNase T2 genes show similar high expression
during embryo development. While plant RNase T2 proteins and the vertebrate RNase A family
show evidences of radiation and gene sorting, vertebrate RNase T2 proteins form a monophyletic
group, but there is also another monophyletic group defining a fish-specific RNase T2 clade.
Conclusion: Based on gene expression and phylogenetic analyses we propose that RNase T2
enzymes carry out a housekeeping function. This conserved biological role probably kept RNase
T2 enzymes in animal genomes in spite of the presence of RNases A. A hypothetical role during
embryo development is also discussed.

Background
Ribonucleases (RNases) have long been used as biochemical models of enzymology and protein folding, and also

as models for molecular phylogenetic and evolutionary
analyses [1-3]. The RNase A and RNase T2 families are
among those better characterized. The acidic ribonuclease

RNase T2 was first purified from Aspergillus oryzae and
characterized by Sato and Egami [4]. The RNase T2 superfamily is widespread [1], with members in almost all
organisms analyzed to date, including bacteria, fungi,
plants, animals and even viruses. RNase T2 enzymes are
secreted RNases without base specificity, and they can
degrade all types of single-stranded RNA [1]. Phylogenetic
analysis of this family has been carried out extensively in
plants, in particular in models of evolution of gametophytic self-incompatibility [5,6] because a subclass of the
RNase T2 family, the S-RNases, is involved in this process.
The T2 family has expanded and diversified in plants, and
each angiosperm genome sequenced so far contains five
or more genes belonging to this family (A. Meyer and G.C.
MacIntosh, unpublished). These genes are classified as SRNases or as S-like RNases, depending on whether they
are involved in the self-incompatibility process or not [7].
A nutritional role as phosphate scavengers and defense
roles as antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral agents are
among the functions proposed for S-like RNases [1,7].
In animals, the vertebrate-specific RNase A superfamily
has been exhaustively studied [2]. RNase A enzymes are
secreted proteins with pyrimidine base-specificity that can
degrade any kind of single stranded RNA, and in some
cases double stranded RNA [8]. This family has also been
used in a variety of evolutionary studies, from mammalian and vertebrate phylogenetics [3,9] to analyses of evolution of novel gene functions after gene duplications
[10,11]. Among the biological functions assigned to
RNase A family members are nutrition, as a phosphate
and nitrogen scavenger in the gut [12], and defense, due
to antibacterial and antiviral properties [13,14]. These
functions are similar to those assigned to RNase T2 members in plants. In addition, while some enzymatic differences exist between these two families, the main substrate
seems to be similar.
The RNase T2 family has experienced a large expansion
and diversification in plants; [5,6](Meyer A and MacIntosh GC, unpublished), and a parallel can be drawn to the
RNase A family expansion in vertebrates [9,13]. In spite of
these similarities, RNase A members have not been able to
completely replace RNase T2 functions in vertebrates,
since at least one gene belonging to the latter family has
been found in each animal genome completely
sequenced.
To gain insights on the evolution and coexistence of these
RNase families we analyzed RNase T2 members found in
the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome. We chose this organism because its genome has been completely sequenced,
and all developmental stages, from early embryo to adult,
can be easily obtained. In addition, well-detailed analyses
of zebrafish RNase A genes have been recently published

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/170

[15-17]. Here we show that the zebrafish genome contains two RNase T2 genes. Expression of RNase T2 genes
in all adult and embryo tissues suggests that this family of
RNases have a housekeeping function, in contrast to the
roles of RNase A, which are tissue- and stress-specific. In
addition high RNase T2 embryo expression is conserved
in various eukaryotes, both plant and animals, suggesting
that an embryo specific function could also be important
to maintain this family's presence in vertebrates even after
RNase A genes appeared.

Results
RNase T2 enzymes are present in zebrafish
Although early studies detected only faint RNase activity
in fish organ extracts [18], an RNase T2 with acidic pH
preference was recently isolated from salmon liver [19].
To identify RNase activities in zebrafish extracts we used a
standard in gel activity assay that allows size separation of
different proteins with RNase activity, as well as characterization of pH preference. Adult zebrafish of mixed sexes
were separated into "body" (mostly muscle, skin and skeleton), "head" (which included skull, muscle, skin, brain,
eyes among other tissues) and "guts" (which included
most internal organs such as intestine, liver, heart, sexual
organs). Crude extracts were then analyzed for RNase
activities (Figure 1A). At neutral pH we identified only
weak activities in the molecular weight range of RNase A
(12–18 kDa). However, at an acidic pH we also observed
stronger activities in the 20–30 kDa range that could correspond to RNase T2 enzymes. While body and head
extracts clearly showed all activities, gut extracts did not
show any detectable RNase activity in the conditions
assayed. This result is not due to general protein degradation since protein integrity seems evident in a Coomassie
stained SDS-PAGE (Figure 1B).

Identification of several bands in the RNase A range was
consistent with the four RNase A genes found in the
zebrafish genome [15,16]. Thus, several bands in the
RNase T2 range suggested that the zebrafish genome also
contained more than one RNase T2 gene. A BLASTP [20]
search against the protein prediction database of the current zebrafish genome assembly (Zv7) using the RNase
Ok2 sequence from salmon [19] identified two proteins
with homology to RNase T2 enzymes, one located in
chromosome 15 and the other in chromosome 13. Additional searches using these two proteins (using TBLASTN),
or the corresponding nucleotide sequences (using
BLASTN) against the full genome assembly and available
ESTs failed to identify any additional sequences corresponding to RNase T2 homologs.
The two proteins contain conserved amino acid sequences
(CAS I and CAS II, Figure 2A) characteristic of the RNase
T2 family, which include the His residues (* in Figure 2)

(RNase Dre1) identical to RNase T2 from Aspergillus
oryzae, the prototypic RNase of the family[1]. Analysis of
genomic organization (Figure 2B) showed that RNase
Dre1 has 9 exons, while RNase Dre2 has 14, although the
coding regions for both genes are contained in 9 exons.

Characterization of zebrafish RNases
Characterization of zebrafish RNases. A) Ribonuclease
activities present in zebrafish extracts. Adult zebrafish
extracts were analyzed in an in gel RNase assay at two different pHs. Adult zebrafish of mixed sexes were separated into
"body" (B, mostly muscle, skin and skeleton), "head" (H,
which included skull, muscle, skin, brain, eyes among other
tissues) and "gut" (G, which included most internal organs
such as gut, liver, sexual organs, heart). The size range for
RNase T2 and RNase A proteins is indicated. B) Same samples as in A, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with

analyzed in both types of gels.
essential for RNase activity. They also have conserved Cys
residues important for establishment of tertiary structure,
and other residues conserved in most RNase T2 homologs
[1]. We named these enzymes RNase Dre1 (chromosome
15) and RNase Dre2 (chromosome 13). Molecular
weights of the predicted mature peptides are 23.7 kDa and
27.3 kDa for the two forms of RNase Dre1 (see below)
and 25.4 kDa for RNase Dre2. In addition, four N-glycosylation sites are predicted for RNase Dre1 and two for
RNase Dre2. Incomplete glycosylation of the proteins at
these sites could account for all the bands in the 20–30
kDa range observed in the activity gels shown in Figure 1.
Using RT-PCR we cloned cDNAs corresponding to both
genes, and confirmed the sequence of the predicted proteins. Both predicted proteins appear to have signal peptides that may direct them to the secretory pathway. Based
on the sequence of the predicted mature peptides, the
identity between RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 is only
31%; in fact RNase Dre2 is more similar to RNASET2, the
human RNase T2 homolog (44% identity), while RNase
Dre1 is only 26% identical to RNASET2. On the other
hand, both proteins are 22% (RNase Dre2) and 19%

During cloning we observed that RNase Dre1 RT-PCR
showed two different bands, with less than 100 bp difference in size. Cloning and sequencing of individual bands
(See Additional File 1) resulted in the identification of an
alternative splicing variant. The presence of the alternative
exon of 74 nt in the mRNA (black box in Figure 2B) results
in a longer mRNA. The expression of both mRNA species
was confirmed by Northern blots (not shown). This extra
exon also results in a change in the open reading frame,
which in turns changes the start codon position. Thus, the
short mRNA species produces a longer peptide, while the
long mRNA produces a shorter one. This change only
affects the signal peptide (Figure 2A). Subcellular localization prediction programs predict that both isoforms of
RNase Dre1, as well as RNase Dre2, contain a signal peptide that target the proteins to the secretory pathway, as is
the norm for most members of the RNase T2 family. However, the putative signal peptide in the shorter RNase Dre1
protein includes sequences that are highly conserved in all
RNase T2 proteins, suggesting that this putative peptide
might not be cleaved, or that it could result in a non-functional protein.
RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 are expressed in adult and
embryo tissues
To determine when and where the two RNase T2 genes
were expressed, we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Adult
fish tissues were dissected and total RNA was isolated. To
be able to compare RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 expression with that of RNase A genes, we used the same tissues
utilized in the analysis by Cho and Zhang [16]. These
included brain, eye, heart, liver, gut, muscle, ovary, testis
and skin. RNase Dre2 was expressed in all organs, and a
stronger signal was detected in reproductive organs (Figure 3A). RNase Dre1 was not detected in liver and the signal was weak in eye, ovary and skin under the conditions
of our experiment. These expression patterns contrast
with those observed for RNase A homologs, which are
expressed almost exclusively in liver and gut tissues, and
weakly in heart (Dr-RNase 1, Dr-RNase 2 and Dr-RNase 3;
[16]), or brain (Zf-RNase-1; [17]). It is important to note
that while expression of RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 is
clearly detected in several internal organs, RNase activity
is not easily detected in "guts" extracts (Figure 1A). Further
characterization of these extracts indicated that although
RNase activities are present, they are degraded by proteases that seem to have a certain amount of specificity,
since most proteins in gut extracts seem unaltered after
Coomassie blue staining (Figure 1 and data not shown).

with the publish sequence of genomic DNA. Boxes indicate exons, lines indicate introns. Gray shading indicates untranslated
regions, white indicates coding region, and black marks the region that undergoes alternative splicing in RNase Dre1. Gene
accession numbers for the zebrafish proteins are FJ460212 for RNase Dre2 and FJ460210 and FJ460211 for the two different
splicing variants of RNase Dre1.
Analysis of expression in whole embryos during developmental stages was also performed (Figure 3B). Strong
expression of RNase Dre1 was observed during all developmental stages analyzed (2, 5, 12, 24, 72 h after fertilization), with a peak of expression at 72 hours. RNase Dre2
was also detected in all developmental stages and peaked
at 72 h, although the signal was lower at 5 and 12 h. In
contrast, only one of the RNase A homologs, Zf-RNase-1,
is expressed in early embryo tissues [16,17]. Analysis of

RNase activity in embryo extracts showed a pattern consistent with mRNA expression results. Only RNase activities in the 20–30 kDa range were detected, and only in
acidic conditions (Figure 3C).
To further confirm that RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 are
expressed in zebrafish embryos, we performed in situ
hybridization analyses (Figure 4). As expected, both
mRNAs were detected in all the embryo stages studied. At

pole associated with axial streaming of ooplasm [21].

These structures could correspond to RNA being recruited
to the embryo from the extraembryonic yolky cytoplasm

gave a strong signal in blastomeres. Twenty six-hour
embryos (Figure 4, panels E-F) showed strong expression
throughout the embryo, and only RNase Dre2 showed
weak expression in yolk, with both RNases most highly
expressed in eyes.

organisms

expression of genes belonging to this family using available microarray data from public databases. CeRNS, the
only RNase T2 homolog gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans genome is also expressed during embryo
development (Figure 5A). Microarray data also indicated
that CeRNS is not expressed in adult tissues (not shown).
In situ hybridization results obtained from The Nematode
Expression Pattern DataBase (Tadasu Shin-i and Yuji
Kohara, unpublished, http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/)
confirmed the expression pattern of CeRNS obtained from
microarray databases. CeRNS embryo expression seems to
be ubiquitous, as is the case for RNase Dre1 and RNase
Dre2. In addition, analysis of expression data representing
61 mouse tissues [23] showed that the only RNase T2
homolog present in the mouse genome was also detected
in embryonic samples (not shown). Remarkably, embryo
expression is not limited to animals. According to microarray data [24], RNS1, one of five members of the RNase
T2 family present in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, is one
of the most highly expressed genes (98–99 percentile)
during embryo development (Figure 5B).
RNase Dre1 represents a gene duplication present only in
ray-finned and cartilaginous fishes
In order to understand the evolution of RNase T2 genes in
fish and other animals, we searched for sequences belonging to this family in EST and protein databases. We also
analyzed the fully sequenced genomes of the ray-finned
fishes medaka (Oryzias latipes), spotted green pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis), and fugu (Takifugu rubripes). In
these three genomes we identified two genes in each species belonging to the RNase T2 family, as in the zebrafish
genome, although only one in each case was also represented in EST collections. Additional sequences belonging
to this family were found in EST collections for other fish
species, including sharks, lamprey and hagfish (see Figure
6 and Additional File 2 for full list of species).

Among the many RNase T2 sequences available from
other organisms, we selected several sequences from vertebrates (platypus, opossum, mouse, human, chicken,
frog), an Urochordate, a Cephalochordate, an Echinoderm, nematodes, a trematode and an insect to generate a
protein Neighbor-Joining tree of animal RNases (Figure
6). Proteins from plants (RNase LE and RNS1), bacteria
(RNase I and RNase AhyI), protozoa (RNase Ddl) and
fungi (RNase T2 and RNase Rh) were included to identify
the relationship of animal RNases with other proteins in
the RNase T2 superfamily.
The tree allowed us to make several inferences on the evolution of the RNase T2 family in animals. Fish RNases
cluster in two well defined clades, one represented by
RNase Dre1 and the other by RNase Dre2 (red and yellow
boxes in Figure 6). Evidence for genes belonging to the
two clades was found in all fully sequenced fish genomes

by BLAST searches, although only those with EST support
were included in the tree shown in Figure 6, because a
clear gene model for the other genes was not available. All
the fish species for which full genome sequence is available contain only one gene from each clade. Similarly, only
one sequence for each clade was found in several fish EST
collections with the exception of the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), in which a recent duplication gave rise to
two copies of the RNase Dre1 homolog (RNase Sfo1 and
RNase Sfo3 in Figure 6).

The presence of genes from the two clades in Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) and Actinopterygii (ray-finned
fishes) indicates an ancient origin for the gene duplication
that gave rise to these two clades, with the two genes
present at least in the last common ancestor of the two
classes more than 400 MYA [25]. Analysis of sequence
data from earlier Chordata, including sea squirt (Ciona
intestinalis), amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), hagfish
(Eptatretus burgeri), and lamprey (Petromyzon marinus)
identified only one gene belonging to the RNase T2 family
in each species. Since the amphioxus genome has been
completely sequenced [26], the presence of only one gene
would indicate that the gene duplication occurred after
the separation of the Cephalochordata from the main
Chordata stem. Since genome coverage for the other species is limited, the exact timing for the gene duplication
leading to the two RNase clades cannot be precisely determined. Moderate bootstrap support (76%) for the RNase
Dre2 clade suggests that the duplication the predated the
divergence of lampreys and hagfishes from jawed vertebrates. However, this result could also mean that the
genes in the RNase Dre2 clade conserved more ancestral
characteristics than RNase Dre1 after duplication.
Genes belonging to the RNase Dre2 clade were found in
all vertebrates analyzed, from hagfish to human. However, RNase Dre1 clade genes were found only in cartilaginous and bony fishes, but not in other vertebrates.
Exhaustive analysis of the fully sequenced human and
mouse genomes failed to identify RNase Dre1 genes.
Interestingly, an RNase T2 pseudogene was found in each
of these two genomes (not shown), but in both cases the
pseudogene also belonged to the RNase Dre2 clade (the
human pseudogene presented 84% identity with the
human RNASE T2 protein, while the mouse pseudogene
had 63% identity with mouse RNase T2 protein RNase
Mmu2). These results suggest that the RNase Dre1 gene
was present at least in the last common ancestor of Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and Sarcopterygii (lobefinned fishes and tetrapods) but was lost in Tetrapods
after they diverged.
The recent characterization of RNase Ok2 [19] showed
that in this protein, a commonly conserved His residue in
CAS II (His104 in RNase Rh, Tyr102 in RNase Dre2) is
mutated to Tyr. This change most likely affects the catalytic properties of the enzyme and results in lower specific
activity [19]. Our results showed that the same mutation
is found in all Teleostei (modern ray-finned fishes) (Figure 7), but not in sturgeon (RNase Atr2), sea lamprey
(RNase Pma2), and dogfish shark (RNase Sac2), nor in
other vertebrates outside fish, suggesting that the mutation appeared and was fixed at the base of this taxon or
after the separation of Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes)
and Sarcopterygii (Coelacanths and tetrapods). Interestingly, the same mutation was found in RNase Ebu2 from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/170

inshore hagfish, and it is most likely the result of an independent mutation that was fixed in this species (or near
taxa).
Remarkably, all analyzed genes belonging to the RNase
Dre1 clade also showed mutations in the same position
(Figure 7). In this case the canonical His residue characteristic of other RNase T2 enzymes is replaced by a series of
charged or polar amino acids: Glu, Asp, Gln, or Asn. Since
all genes in this subfamily have substitutions in this position, the loss of the His residue seems to have happened
soon after the duplication event that gave rise to the
RNase Dre1 clade. Although no mutagenesis experiments
have been carried out to show the effect of these mutations, some S-RNases have similar substitutions (Figure
7). S-RNases have low specific activity compared with
other RNase T2 enzymes, and such characteristic has been
attributed to the lack of this particular His residue [27];
however, they are still active, and this activity is essential
for their biological function. Since the amino acid substitutions in this position in S-RNases and RNase Dre1
homologs are the same, it is expected that the changes
observed in RNase Dre1 homologs also reduce, but not
eliminate, the specific activity of these enzymes.

Discussion
Ribonucleases from the RNase A and RNase T2 family
have been frequently used as models for the study of evolution of gene function. These two types of RNases have
similar enzymatic activity and substrate preferences, both
being endoribonucleases that mainly hydrolyze bulk single stranded RNA. Both families are also found mainly in
extracellular space or associated with the secretory pathway. While the RNase A family is vertebrate specific [16],
the RNase T2 family is widespread and members of this
family has been found is almost all eukaryotic and many
prokaryotic genomes [1,28]. Thus, in spite of this seemingly redundant activity, both enzyme families coexist in
vertebrates. Evolution and biological function of RNase
T2 proteins have been studied mostly in plants [5-7];
although recent reports of an association of human
RNASE T2 with cancer have spiked interest in this protein
[29,30].
In this work we characterized the two RNase T2 genes
present in the zebrafish genome. A recent analysis of
RNase A genes from this fish suggests that the available
genome sequence may not be complete, as at least one
RNase A gene found in cDNA libraries is not found in the
genome [15,16,31]. However, based on the lack of any
other RNase T2 sequence in zebrafish cDNA collections,
the presence of only two genes in the other fully
sequenced fish genomes, and our phylogenetic analysis,
we feel confident that only two RNase T2 genes are
present in the zebrafish genome.

We were able to detect ribonuclease activities in zebrafish
extracts that show the molecular weight and enzymatic
properties expected for the proteins encoded by RNase
Dre1 and RNase Dre2. In addition, the conservation of the
active site residues, and the high sequence similarity
between the zebrafish RNases and RNase Ok2 (more than
50% identity between RNase Dre2 and RNase Ok2),
which was shown to be an active ribonuclease by purification from salmon liver [19] strongly suggest that RNase
Dre1 and RNase Dre2 are active ribonucleases.
Fish seem unusual among animals because in all species
analyzed there were two genes belonging to the RNase T2
family, unlike all other animals in which only one gene
has been found. Genomic data indicate that a whole
genome duplication event (WGD) occurred in the fish lineage after the separation of teleosts from the main tetrapod stem. This WGD explains the occurrence of many rayfinned fish-specific gene duplications [32,33]. However,
this WGD is proposed to have occurred after the separation of the Acipenseriformes and the Semionotiformes
from the lineage leading to teleost fish, but before the
divergence of Osteoglossiformes [32]. Thus, the gene
duplication event that gave rise to both RNase T2 genes
present in fish genomes cannot correspond to this rayfinned fish-specific WGD, since genes corresponding to
the RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 clades were found in
sturgeons (ray-finned fishes but not Teleostei) and sharks
(Chondrichthyes).

Figure 7
Mutations in CAS II of fish RNase T2 proteins
Mutations in CAS II of fish RNase T2 proteins. The
alignment shows the conserved CAS II region characteristic
of RNase T2 enzymes. The absolutely conserved His (black
box, white font) is part of the catalytic site of the enzyme. A
second His residue (green), possibly involved in substrate
binding or stabilization of an intermediate in the catalytic
reaction, is mutated in most fish RNases. In the RNase Dre2
clade this His is mutated to Tyr (yellow). In the RNase Dre1
clade the His is mutated to a series of polar amino acids
(red). Similar mutations are found in some plant S-RNases
(S2 RNase and S3 RNase).

In contrast, the lack of RNase Dre1 orthologs in all tetrapods indicates that this gene was lost in this lineage soon
after the separation from the Actinopterigii. Moreover,
any duplicated gene produced by the WGD that occurred
in the fish lineage was also lost. Interestingly, according to
Cho and Zhang [16], RNase A genes may have appeared
in the chordate lineage in the last common ancestor of
these two groups. While the success of this new gene family was mixed in ray-finned fish (zebrafish has 4 RNase A
genes, but fugu and Tetraodon seem to have none), it has
been successfully maintained and underwent a large
diversification in tetrapods. In plants, where no RNase A
genes exist, RNase T2 genes have radiated and diversified
to a greater extent, in a way similar to that observed for the
RNase A family in animals (A. Meyer and G. MacIntosh,
unpublished). Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that the
presence of RNase A genes influenced the evolution of the
RNase T2 family in ray-finned fish and tetrapods
(Figure 8).
This hypothesis could be supported by a series of observations. Plant RNase T2 genes and vertebrate RNase A genes
show patterns of gene sorting [9,16](A. Meyer and G.
MacIntosh, unpublished) such as the presence of different

gene numbers in different species and the lack of clear
orthologs among species. In contrast, vertebrate RNase T2
genes form two monophyletic groups, one exclusive to
fish, and the other including all vertebrates (Figure 6).
The functions acquired by duplicated genes after extensive
radiation seem to be similar for the two types of enzymes
in plants and animals; i.e., the biological roles assigned to
many RNase A proteins in animals are similar to those of
RNase T2 proteins in plants. For example, several members of the RNase A family have antimicrobial properties.
Eosinophil associated RNases have antiviral (RNase 2 and
RNase 3 in humans) and antibacterial (RNase 3) function,
and angiogenin and RNase 7 have antibacterial and antifungal activities[14]. Similarly, plant RNase T2 proteins
inhibit hyphal elongation of the pathogenic oomycete
Phytophthora parasitica [34], and are induced by viral and
fungal pathogens [35,36]. In addition, both animal RNase
A and plant RNase T2 enzymes have cytotoxic properties,
for example frog oocyte RNases used as anticancer drugs
[37], and flower S-RNases that reject pollen during selfincompatible pollination [38]. The cytotoxic properties of
these enzymes are probably as a consequence of their role
in defense, as in the case of frog oocyte RNases [39], or
have evolved from a defensive role, as in the case of SRNases [7]. A nutritional role has also been proposed for
plant RNase T2 and animal RNase A enzymes. RNase A is
secreted into the mammalian intestine where it helps
digest RNA from gut bacteria to recover nutrients [12];
while expression of plant RNase T2 enzymes is induced
when phosphate in the soil is limited [40-42]as part of a
phosphate scavenging system [43].
Finally, most plant RNase T2 enzymes and vertebrate
RNase A enzymes show strong tissue specificity and lack
of expression in early embryos, suggesting that they are
involved in immune and stress responses rather than having a housekeeping role [16]. On the other hand, animal
RNase T2 enzymes, and a few plant ones like Arabidopsis
RNS2 [40] (A. Meyer and G. MacIntosh, unpublished),
seem to be constitutively expressed, suggesting that they
could have a housekeeping function. This function, conserved through evolution, could be responsible for the
conservation of the RNase T2 family in animals, in spite
of the presence of RNase A.
We hypothesize that the role of RNase T2 enzymes could
be to recycle bulk RNA (mostly rRNA) throughout the life
of the cell, and not only in times of nutrient deprivation
as has been proposed before. RNA is an important source
of P and N, and turnover of this molecule should be
important for P and N homeostasis. Accordingly, some
RNase T2 enzymes have been found in intracellular compartments, supporting the idea of a role recycling RNA in
normal cells. For example, human RNASET2 has been
found to accumulate in the lysosome [44], while Arabi-

Figure 8
Hypothetical model of RNase T2 evolution in animals
Hypothetical model of RNase T2 evolution in animals. An ancestral RNase T2 gene present in the last common ancestor of lancelet and higher chordate was duplicated
after the separation of these two groups, but before the separation of Chondrichthyes and Teleostomi (black circle).
Sometime after this duplication event RNase A genes
emerged, most likely after the separation of Chondrichthyes
and Teleostomi. The presence of RNase A could have
released some selective pressure on RNase T2 genes, allowing the fixation of mutations in the active site conserved
region (squares, H/Y/E-D position in CAS II), and the disappearance of one of the genes in tetrapods (black circle with
white X).
dopsis RNS2 is present in intracellular fractions, probably
associated to the vacuole or the ER [45]. In the case of
zebrafish RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 the localization is
unknown, but subcellular localization predictions using
different programs (see Material and Methods) indicate
either extracellular or microsomal/lysosomal localization,
almost identical to predictions for the human enzyme. It
is interesting to note that the alternative splicing observed
for RNase Dre1 alters the protein's signal peptide, opening
the possibility that this protein localizes to different subcellular compartments. Alternative processing resulting in
different subcellular localizations has already been
described for tomato ribonucleases [46,47].
The high level of expression of RNase T2 enzymes in
embryonic tissues is also notable. This pattern could also
be a consequence of the proposed housekeeping role for
RNase T2s. The high metabolic activity of embryos could
demand a high level of RNase activity to process cellular
material as it is being renewed. Alternatively, we could
Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:170

look for other explanations for the embryonic role of
RNase T2 enzymes. A highly speculative but attractive idea
is that secreted RNases can control the activity of small
RNAs [48].
Following this rationale, we could speculate that the
embryonic role of RNase T2 enzymes is to shield embryonic tissues from unwanted small RNAs. In plants, RNA
silencing is reset in each generation [49]. This property of
silencing was shown for virus induced gene silencing
(VIGS) and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS).
Arabidopsis RNS1 is one of the most highly expressed
genes during all the stages of embryo development.
Importantly, RNS1 is secreted to the apoplastic space [45].
It has been shown that the outer integument of the developing seed can provide a symplastic route for transport
from maternal tissues to the developing seed, but the
transfer between the outer integument and the inner
integument and between the integument and the embryo
are apoplastic [50,51]. Thus, any RNA signal would have
to travel through the apoplast to reach the embryo would
find a barrier due to accumulation of RNS1. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans it has been shown that phenotypes induced by RNAi can last only for two or three
generations [52], and only a small subset of genes (13/
171) that could be inheritably silenced for longer periods
of time [53]. These results suggest that transmission of
silencing from maternal to embryonic tissues could be
regulated also in animals. In this context, secreted RNases
would form a RNA surveillance field [54], that stops the
spreading of small RNAs.
In summary, it seems possible that the emergence of
RNase A affected the evolution of RNase T2 proteins in
animals. The smaller size of RNase A proteins, which
could be more energetically favorable, could favor the use
of this protein instead of RNase T2 proteins for defense
roles in animals. However, RNase T2 proteins have not
been completely replaced in animals, most likely because
they also have a housekeeping function in an intracellular
compartment that cannot be carried out by RNase A.

Conclusion
The zebrafish genome contains two RNase T2 genes,
RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2. These genes are part of two
phylogenetic clades, one conserved in all chordates (the
RNase Dre2 clade), and another fish-specific (the RNase
Dre1 clade). Expression analyses indicate that RNase Dre2
is present in all tissues and developmental stages in
zebrafish, suggesting a housekeeping role for these
enzymes. This idea is further supported by the conservation of RNase T2 genes in all the genomes analyzed. Analyses of the evolution of the RNase T2 family in animals,
and comparisons with the evolution of RNase T2 in plants
and RNase A in vertebrates suggest that the emergence of

RNase A affected the evolution of RNase T2 proteins in
animals.

Methods
Database searches and sequence identifications
Identification of RNase T2 genes was done by BLAST
searches in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome (version
Zv7, available through the National Center for Biotechnology
Information
(NCBI),
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Analyses of the medaka (Oryzias
latipes), spotted green pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis),
and other full genomes was also performed using NCBI
resources. Analysis of the fugu (Takifugu rubripes) genome
was performed using Assembly Release 4 from the Fugu
BLAST
server
http://fugu.biology.qmul.ac.uk/blast/.
Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and protein
sequences were also obtained by BLAST searches of the
NCBI EST-other and non-redundant databases respectively. Analysis of genome organization for the RNase
Dre1 and RNase Dre2 genes was done using contigs
obtained by combining information from cDNAs cloned
by our laboratory (supplementary dataset) and ESTs
obtained from NCBI EST-other.

Prediction of signal peptides and subcellular localization
was carried out using PSORT [55], WoLF PSORT [56] and
SignalP and TargetP [57].
Arabidopsis microarray data were obtained from the Arabidopsis information Resource (TAIR) database. Mouse
microarray data were obtained from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation SymAtlas http:/
/symatlas.gnf.org/SymAtlas/. Nematode microarray data
were obtained from WormBase http://www.worm
base.org/. In all cases, normalized data were used, and values belonging to the same experiment set were compared.
Zebrafish samples preparation and cDNA cloning and RTPCR
Wild zebrafish and laboratory strain WIC were used in our
experiments. RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 cDNAs were
amplified from 48 hr post-fertilization embryo RNA using
primers designed based on database sequences. Embryos
were broken by forcing the sacs through a syringe fitted
with a sterile needle prior to extraction. Total RNA was
purified using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufactures directions (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized using the iSCRIPT kit (BioRAD). PCR was performed
using
the
following
primers:

A3', RNase Dre2F 5'CGCGATATCACAGACTCTCAGAACA
GACG3' and RNase Dre2R 5'CGCCCATGGGGTTACATG
GCTCATGAGGA3'. During cloning, we amplified two
PCR products corresponding to RNase Dre1. Both bands

from RNase Dre1 and a single band from RNase Dre2
amplification were gel purified using a Gel Purification kit
(Promega). The genes were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy
kit (Promega) and sequenced. Sequencing reactions were
performed at the DNA Facility at Iowa State University
using T7 and SP6 primers.

Phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW2 [62] followed by manual adjustments. PAUP 4.0 software [63]
was used for phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining tree method
[64] with 1,000 bootstrap replications.

Expression analyses were performed using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Adult fish were dissected into the following
organs: brain, eyes, heart, liver, gut (digestive system),
muscle, ovary, testis, and skin. Excluding reproductive
organs, all tissue samples came from fish of both sexes.
RNA was extracted and cDNA was generated as described
previously. PCR amplification was done using GoTAQ
Green Master Mix (Promega). The cDNA corresponding to
the ribosomal protein p70 was used as loading control for
RT-PCR. The primer sequences used for p70 were p70/
6sk-r1 5'AGCTTGCCGCCCGTCTGAAA3', and p70/6sk-f1
5'CATGGCGACGGTGCGTTCAT3'. Primer sequences for
RNase Dre1 and RNase Dre2 are the same as those listed
above. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using the NIH Image program. All experiments
were performed a minimum of 3 times and a representative sample was chosen for each figure.

RNase Activity
Adult fish of both sexes were dissected into the following
sections: head, including all tissues above the heart; body,
including skin, muscle, and bones of the main body; and
gut, including the digestive and reproductive systems. Proteins were extracted from each section following the
method used by MacIntosh et al. [58]. The protein extraction protocol was modified by eliminating β-mercaptoethanol and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone from the
extraction buffer. Protein was quantified according to the
Bradford method. RNase activity was determined by an in
gel assay according to Yen and Green [59], using high
molecular weight RNA purified from commercial torula
(yeast) RNA (SIGMA). One hundred μg of protein were
run for each sample. Gels were incubated in 0.1 M TrisHCl at either pH 6.0 or pH 7.0 as identified in the figure.
In parallel, SDS-PAGE gels were run using 100 μg of protein to verify loading amounts and protein quality. All
experiments were performed a minimum of 3 times and a
representative sample was chosen for each figure.
In situ hybridizations
Whole-mount in situ hybridizations were performed as
described by Essner et al. [60], using 1-cell (~30 min. post
fertilization), 16-cell (~1.5 h post fertilization) and prim
6 (~26 h post fertilization) embryos [61]. RNA probes
were prepared in vitro transcription from linearized templates of RNaseDre1 and RNaseDre2 cDNA in the pGEM TEasy vector.

MSH carried out the gene expression analyses, RNase
activity characterization, and part of the cloning. LR and
AU performed the initial cloning and characterization of
alternative splicing. YW and JJE carried out the in situ
hybridizations. GCM conceived of the study, and performed the phylogenetic analyses. MSH and GCM participated in the design of the study and drafted the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
