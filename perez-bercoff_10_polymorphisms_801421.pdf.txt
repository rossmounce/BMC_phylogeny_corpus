Abstract
Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 2 is naturally resistant to some antiretroviral drugs, restricting
therapeutic options for patients infected with HIV-2. Regimens including integrase inhibitors (INI) seem to be
effective, but little data on HIV-2 integrase (IN) polymorphisms and resistance pathways are available.
Materials and methods: The integrase coding sequence from 45 HIV-2-infected, INI-naïve, patients was sequenced
and aligned against the ROD (group A) or EHO (group B) reference strains and polymorphic or conserved positions
were analyzed.
To select for raltegravir (RAL)-resistant variants in vitro, the ROD strain was cultured under increasing sub-optimal RAL
concentrations for successive rounds. The phenotype of the selected variants was assessed using an MTT assay.
Results: We describe integrase gene polymorphisms in HIV-2 clinical isolates from 45 patients. Sixty-seven percent
of the integrase residues were conserved. The HHCC Zinc coordination motif, the catalytic triad DDE motif, and AA
involved in IN-DNA binding and correct positioning were highly conserved and unchanged with respect to HIV-1
whereas the connecting residues of the N-terminal domain, the dimer interface and C-terminal LEDGF binding
domain were highly conserved but differed from HIV-1. The N155 H INI resistance-associated mutation (RAM) was
detected in the virus population from one ARV-treated, INI-naïve patient, and the 72I and 201I polymorphisms
were detected in samples from 36 and 38 patients respectively. No other known INI RAM was detected.
Under RAL selective pressure in vitro, a ROD variant carrying the Q91R+I175M mutations was selected. The Q91R
and I175M mutations emerged simultaneously and conferred phenotypic resistance (13-fold increase in IC50). The
Q91R+I175M combination was absent from all clinical isolates. Three-dimensional modeling indicated that residue
91 lies on the enzyme surface, at the entry of a pocket containing the DDE catalytic triad and that adding a positive charge (Gln to Arg) might compromise IN-RAL affinity.
Conclusions: HIV-2 polymorphisms from 45 INI-naïve patients are described. Conserved regions as well as
frequencies of HIV-2 IN polymorphisms were comparable to HIV-1. Two new mutations (Q91R and I175M) that
conferred high resistance to RAL were selected in vitro, which might affect therapeutic outcome.

Background
Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus
type 2 [1] generally progress slowly towards immunodeficiency [2], and the majority are not eligible for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. The therapeutic arsenal
developed against HIV-1, however, is reduced for HIV2-infected patients as HIV-2 is naturally resistant to all
available non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

(NNRTI) and to the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide [3-7].
Moreover, HIV-2 has reduced sensitivity to some protease inhibitors (PI) [6-9] and a lower genetic barrier to
resistance to other PIs compared to HIV-1 [10,11], leading to more rapid virologic failure [12]. Recent drug
classes such as integrase inhibitors (INI), and more specifically the strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG), represent promising
treatment options for HIV-2. In vitro, phenotypic susceptibility of clinical HIV-2 strains was comparable to
that of HIV-1 [13,14].

As with other ARV classes, INI escape mutants may
emerge under suboptimal drug concentrations. In HIV1-infected patients failing an INI-containing regimen,
three distinct resistance pathways involving Y143R,
Q148H/R/K or N155 H have been described. The Q148
H mutation in combination with the G140 S secondary
mutation confers the highest level of resistance to RAL
(> 1000-fold) together with the highest replicative capacity in vitro [15,16]. RAL resistance is not well documented for HIV-2, although cases of therapy failure
have been associated with the emergence of variants
carrying the Y143C, Q148K/R, or N155 H mutations,
including Y143Y+T97A or Q148K, or Q148R+G140 S
[1,17-19]. The N155 H substitution in conjunction with
secondary mutations conferred HIV-2 strains a 37-fold
increase in RAL IC50 [18], suggesting that HIV-2 can
embrace the N155 H resistance pathway, although
recent data suggest that this mutational pathway might
be favored in the IN context of group B strains [1].
The IN proteins of both viruses share the same structure. Despite only 40% identity at the nucleotide level,
HIV-1 and HIV-2 share 65% similarity at the amino
acid level.
IN catalyzes integration of the provirus into the host
cellular DNA. IN is derived from the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor, and IN dimers join to form a homotetramer. Each monomer consists of three different domains.
The N-terminal domain (NTD, AA 1-49) consists of 4
a-helices arranged as a three-helix bundle stabilized by
a Zinc atom binding to H12, H16, C40 and C43. The
NTD is involved in IN dimerization: more specifically,
the N-terminal tail and the first half of helix a3 mediate
dimer interface through hydrophobic AA F1, L2, I5,
P29, L31, V32 and hydrophilic Q35 [20-22]. The catalytic core domain (CCD, AA 50-212) contains the conserved catalytic triad D64, D116, E152 (DDE motif).
These three residues form a pocket binding an Mg-bivalent cation. The flexible loop encompassing residues
F139 to G146 and the amphipathic a-helix spanning
residues S147 to V165 of the CCD ensure direct binding
to DNA and correct positioning of viral DNA to the IN
catalytic residues. The C-terminal domain (CTD, AA
213-288) is composed of six a-helices and two anti-parallel b-sheets and is the least conserved in HIV-1. The
CTD contains sequences involved in multimerization, a
non-specific DNA recognition domain as well as a
nuclear localization signal (NLS). The CTD is also
thought to interact with reverse transcriptase (RT) [23].
Despite numerous studies investigating the diversity of
HIV-1 IN, little is still known about the HIV-2 IN, and
most studies involved limited patient numbers. Here we
further investigate the conserved and polymorphic positions of the IN gene in clinical samples from HIV-2infected patients. In addition, we report novel resistance

mutations selected under RAL pressure in vitro. The
genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the HIV-2
IN reported here should contribute to building and finetune HIV-2 specific algorithms for the genotypic interpretation of resistance to INIs.

Results and Discussion
Clinical samples

Fifty-two IN sequences derived from 45 patients were
analyzed: 46 sequences were from patients infected with
HIV-2 group A strains (32 sequences were from treatment-naïve patients and 14 from treatment-experienced
patients), and 6 from patients infected with group B
strains (5 treatment-naïve patients and 1 treatmentexperienced patient). All the ARV-treated patients were
INI-naïve. The main epidemiological, immunological and
clinical data of the 45 patients included in this study are
summarized in Table 1. We report IN polymorphisms for
both groups with respect to the reference sequences
ROD (group A) and EHO (group B) (Figure 1), but
further IN polymorphism analyses are restrained to
group A sequences only, because only 6 group B strains
were available.
IN Variability and polymorphisms

HIV-2 IN length differed from HIV-1 and between
groups A and B: group A IN was 293 AA long, and 4
sequences harbored a second in-frame stop codon at
position 297, whereas group B sequences carried stop
codons at positions 288, 297, 300 or 302. Viral strains
from 4/6 patients carried only one stop codon, one
patient’s viral strains carried 2 stop codons and one
patient’s viruses carried 3 stop codons. It is unclear why
the HIV-2 IN is longer than the HIV-1 IN, and whether
such differences in the length of the IN protein of group
B strains play a direct role in enzyme activity. It is conceivable that, because the C-terminus of IN is involved
in host DNA binding and positioning, its length might
contribute to stabilizing the enzyme onto the substrate.
Clonal and biochemical studies would be needed to clarify this issue.
Overall, 97/293 (33.1%) positions in group A IN supported AA changes with respect to the ROD reference
sequence, and a total of 131 mutations were identified.
This variability is comparable to that reported for the
HIV-1 IN (67% of the residues are conserved) [15].
Because of the limited sample size, true polymorphisms
are difficult to distinguish from isolated variants. We
therefore report positions tolerating a change and positions at which mutations were detected at least twice.
Of the 97 variable positions, 61 were mutated at least
twice (Figure 1 and Table 2), in line with figures previously reported by Roquebert et al. [14]. Fifty-five of
the 131 variations resulted from conservative mutations:
24 V<->I < - > L substitutions at 20 positions, 20 A<->S

mutations and 5 D < - > E (Figure 1).
Overall variability within IN was higher in treatmentnaïve (32.1%) than in treatment-experienced patients
(21.5%), and 58/293 (19.8%) and 42/293 (14.3%) positions featured at least 2 AA changes in treatment-naïve
and in treatment-experienced patients respectively
(Figure 1 and Table 2). When compared to the rest of
pol, IN was as variable as RT (p > 0.05), and less variable than PR (p = 0.03) even when the comparison was
restricted to positions that varied at least twice (p =
0.022) (Table 2). When further sub-divided according to
treatment experience, viruses from treatment-naïve
patients featured similar variability in all 3 genes, while
viruses from treatment-experienced patients featured
similar variability in IN and RT and slightly higher
variability in PR (Table 2), even when only polymorphisms occurring at least twice were considered: 22.7% in
PR against 14.3% in IN and 14.8% in RT (Table 2),
although this difference did not reach statistical significance, probably owing to the small sample size (14
patients). When variability of IN and PR in treated
patients was restricted to the 7 patients infected with
group A strains that had received a PI-based regimen,
polymorphism frequency in PR was similar to IN and
RT: 29/101 (29%) of mutated positions, and 14/101
(14%) positions were mutated at least twice.
Some AA (residues L2, R34, N55, I84, P90, A153,
M154, T206, Q214, K221, Y226, D232, V251, D256,
S279, G285, A286, D289) were found to support variability at least twice in sequences from treatment-naïve
patients, but not in sequences from treatment-experienced patients, probably reflecting the selection of particular IN strains or the counter-selection of certain
polymorphisms under NRTI-selective pressure. Indeed,
IN and RT are thought to interact [23], and NRTI-selective pressure might therefore also constrain IN. This
observation contrasts with one very recent comparative
study reporting increased diversity of HIV-1 RT and IN
under RTI selective pressure, particularly at IN positions
that are thought to interact with RT, such as M154,
G163, V165, T206 [24]. Because the HIV-2 IN naturally
harbors the AA that were mutated in HIV-1 IN under
RTI pressure (V165 in HIV-1 is I165 in HIV-2, M154L
in HIV-1 is I154 in HIV-2), it is possible that the HIV-2
IN sequence is naturally more prone to support the
changes in RT induced by the emergence of RTI resistance mutations.

We further investigated variability within each subdomain of HIV-2 IN. The CCD was the most conserved
and the CTD the most variable, in line with previous
reports [14]. As for the IN gene as a whole, variability

Figure 1 HIV-2 group A and group B IN polymorphisms. Polymorphisms of the HIV-2 group A IN sequences from 32 treatment-naïve and 14
treatment-experienced patients, and HIV-2 group B IN sequences from 5 treatment-naïve and 1 treatment-experienced patients are reported with
respect to the ROD and EHO reference sequences respectively. Stop codons are marked with a star (*). Positions that were always polymorphic
are marked with a hash (#). Positions known to confer resistance to INIs in HIV-1 or HIV-2 are indicated in red in the reference sequence;
polymorphisms detected in patient sequences that are known to be associated with resistance to INIs are indicated in red, whereas
polymorphisms of unknown impact at those positions are in black. For group A sequences, the frequency (percentage) of each of the
polymorphisms is indicated in brackets. For group B sequences, the number of patients in which the polymorphism was detected is indicated in
brackets. Only positions where variations were detected are reported. Positions mutated at least twice are highlighted in bold, except when both
mutations were detected in longitudinal samples from the same patient. When all the polymorphisms in sequences from treatment-experienced
patients were already present in the corresponding baseline samples, they are marked in italics; if polymorphisms in the treatment-experienced
sequences are redundant with the corresponding baseline sample, they are not highlighted and counted as polymorphisms.

Variable and polymorphic position frequencies in IN with respect to RT and to PR were compared in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients.
Variable positions and positions supporting variability at least twice are reported. Polymorphism frequency was compared using a Fisher exact test, and
considered statistically different when p < 0.05.

and polymorphism frequencies decreased with treatment
experience within each subdomain: for treatment-naïve
patients, 15/49 positions were variable within the NTD
(of which 10/49 were mutated at least twice), 41/162 (of
which 20/162 were mutated at least twice) within the
CCD, and 39/81 (of which 28/81 were mutated at least
twice) within the CTD; for treatment-experienced
patients, 10/49 positions supported variability (8/49
mutated at least twice) within the NTD, 24/162 (16/162
mutated at least twice) within the CCD, 25/81 (18/81
mutated at least twice) within the CTD (Figure 1).
The HHCC Zinc coordination motif, the DDE catalytic triad, and the RKK motif were fully conserved and
unchanged with respect to HIV-1 (Figure 1) [14,25-27].
Residues involved in dimer-dimer interaction (NTD
polar residues K/R14, N18 and Q44 and CCD residues
K160, Q168 and K186) or in multimerization of the
enzyme (connecting residues 47-55 and side chains R20
and K34 which interact with CCD side chains T206,
Q209 and E212 through hydrophilic contacts in HIV-1
[28]) were all highly or fully conserved (Figure 1)
[28,29]. Residues ensuring DNA binding and correct
positioning of viral DNA to the IN catalytic residues
were also highly conserved. These include the DNA
binding residues of the CCD flexible loop (AA F139 to
G146) and amphipathic
-helix (AA S147 to V165 in HIV-1, S147 and I165 in
HIV-2) involved in direct binding and correct positioning of viral DNA to the IN catalytic residues, the strip
of positively charged residues extending from the CCD
and the RKK motif (R231, K258, K266), as well as
charged residues Q148, E152, N155 and K159 that contact negatively charged viral DNA molecules (Figure 1).
Finally, residues 150 to 196 of the CCD, containing a
positively charged stretch extending from the CCD
through the CTD and that interact with the HHCC
Zinc coordination motif of the adjacent monomer, and
the C-terminal LEDGF/IN binding domain involving

L102, T125, A129, W132, Q168, E170, H174 and M178,
were also all highly conserved in HIV-2. AA 34, a Lys in
HIV-1, is involved in PIC binding; Arg was found at
position 34 in the majority (42/45) of HIV-2 strains, and
supported variability to the conserved R34K in 3
sequences. In contrast, CTD residues 195-225 within the
-helix, which are involved in binding to the CCD, featured surprisingly high variability (11/30 positions with at
least one AA variation), particularly considering that
their interacting counterpart (the CCD highly conserved
residues 150-196) tolerated low variability (Figure 1). The
main polymorphisms and polymorphism distribution
detected in our cohorts did not differ much from those
previously reported by Roquebert et al. for HIV-2 group
A strains [28]. The low variability tolerated at positions
involved in enzyme multimerization, catalytic activity and
DNA positioning and binding confirm the crucial role of
these AA in IN efficacy and viral replication.
The Q96 H mutation has been described to increase
infectivity in HIV-1 and in HIV-2 by improving specific
interactions with other viral components comprising the
initiation complex and thereby increasing the initiation
of reverse transcription [30]. Q96 H was detected in
sequences from 2 patients for which longitudinal samples were available: one patient maintained the Q96 H
substitution after NRTI+PI-based therapy whereas the
other patient evolved to a Q96C/Y mixture. Further
experiments to assess the replicative capacity of these
viruses would be required to assess the impact of
Q96H/C/Y substitutions in the genetic context of HIV2. Other polymorphisms previously described to favor
the initiation of reverse transcription in HIV-2, such as
the K127E and/or the V204I substitutions within IN, or
to increase viral fitness, such as the RT V197I mutation
[30] were not detected in sequences from these patients,
nor from any other patient.
3 positions were fully polymorphic with respect to the
ROD reference (I180V/T, and D222N/K and L250I/V)

Perez-Bercoff et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:98
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/98

independently of treatment experience, as previously
described [14]; and 3 positions were highly polymorphic:
N30K/Q (100% of treatment-naïve samples and 93% of
the treatment-experienced samples), S39T/A (94% of
the treatment-naïve samples and 100% of the treatmentexperienced samples) and I133V/A/T (84% of the treatment-naïve samples and 100% of the treatment-experienced samples) (Figure 1). The impact of these
polymorphisms remains to be determined.
INI-associated resistance mutations

No mutation described to be associated with INI-resistance in HIV-1 or HIV-2 was detected in our cohort,
except for a N155 H substitution in the viral sequence
from one treatment-experienced, INI-naïve patient
(Figure 1). Other resistance-associated mutations present in that sample included RT mutations M184V and
S215Y, and PR mutations V33I, I50V, I54M and I89V.
At sampling time, in 2007, RAL was not commercially
available, and HIV-2 patients were not included in RAL
phase II-III clinical trials, arguing against the hypothesis
that the N155 H mutation emerged as a resistance
mutation per se or that an INI-resistant strain was transmitted. These facts are rather suggestive that the mutation was present as a polymorphism within the patient’s
variants in which other mutations within RT or PR
emerged, or were selected under NRTI+PI selective
pressure. Polymorphisms M154T and H157R at neighboring positions were detected only in the sample from
this patient, and their impact is unknown. The presence
of major RAL and EVG resistance associated mutations
prior to therapy including INIs has not been reported
for HIV-2 IN to our knowledge. Presumably the
presence of this mutation will compromise INI-based
regimens, as the N155 H substitution has been associated
with RAL-based therapy failure in HIV-2 [1,17-19].
Ile was generally found at positions 72 and 201 in
HIV-2 group A IN. I72 was present in 32 patients
infected with group A strains and 4 patients infected
with group B strains, while I201 was found in all but
one group A strains, but was absent from all group B
viruses. Mutations V72I and V201I have been described
to be selected in HIV-1 IN under EVG selective pressure in vitro [26], but their weight on compromising the
response to EVG of patients infected with HIV-2
remains to be ascertained. Conservative polymorphisms
S138T and A153 S were detected in 12% and 6% of all
sequences respectively, but mutations S138A/K and
A153Y, associated with decreased susceptibility to RAL
and/or to EVG [31], were never detected. Taken
together, these data confirm previously reported polymorphisms in HIV-2 [14] and may provide a molecular
basis to the positive outcome of RAL use in the clinic
[13,15-17], as the polymorphisms detected at positions
72, 138, 153 and 201 do not seem to decrease basal

Page 6 of 11

susceptibility to RAL [14], and may be excluded from
HIV-2 RAL specific genotypic prediction tools. Their
potential impact on susceptibility to EVG and to other
investigational INIs is difficult to predict with certainty
and would warrant further investigation.
Selection of RAL resistance associated mutations in vitro

In order to gain further knowledge on the emergence of
resistance to RAL in the context of HIV-2, the ROD
strain was cultured in vitro in the presence of increasing
sub-optimal RAL concentrations starting from 0.001 nM
(ROD RAL IC 50 was 0.00395 nM). After successive
increases of RAL concentration, a variant carrying the
Q91R and I175M mutations emerged in the population.
This variant outgrew an earlier transient variant harboring the I84I/R + L99L/I substitutions when cultured in
the presence of 0.027 nM RAL, as well as the parental
wild-type ROD strain when RAL concentration was
increased to 0.082 nM.
The phenotypic impact of the Q91R and I175M mutations on susceptibility to RAL was assessed in vitro
using an MTT assay as described previously [32]. As
shown in Figure 2, the Q91R and I175M substitutions
conferred substantial phenotypic resistance to RAL
in vitro with a 13.2-fold increase in mean IC50 (Mean

Figure 2 Phenotypic impact of mutations Q91R and I175M on
susceptibility to RAL (A) and on viral titers in vitro (B). (A) 3 ×
104 MT-4 cells were infected with 3 × 106 TCID50 (M.O.I. of 100) of
ROD or ROD-Q91R + I175M variant in the presence of serial RAL
dilutions ranging from 3.763 × 10-5 nM to 20 nM. Infection was
quantified by measuring MTT in culture supernatants after 3 days.
Infections were performed in quadruplicate wells. 4 independent
experiments were performed. The percentage of protection (PP =
(O.D. measured - O.D. infected cells without RAL)/O.D. uninfected
cells - O.D. infected cells without RAL) × 100). RAL IC50 corresponds
to the RAL concentration that protects 50% of the culture from
virus-induced cytopathic effect, i.e. inhibition of infection. Percent
protection is reported as a function of log10 RAL concentration
(nM). The mean of 4 independent experiments, each performed in
quadruplicate wells, is presented. (B) Two million MT-4 cells were
infected with 2 × 108 TCID50 of HIV-2 ROD for at least two hours,
then washed and cultured in the presence of RAL. New infections
were performed twice a week, and virus titers were determined
once a week by RT-PCR. Suboptimal concentrations were used
during the first passages, then raised gradually by 3-fold. The titers
are only shown for the two last drug increases, when the variant
carrying Q91R and I175M mutations was selected.

Perez-Bercoff et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:98
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/98

IC50 ROD: 0.00395 nM, IC50 range: 0.0036-0.0043 nM;
Mean IC50 ROD-Q91R + I175M: 0.0424 nM, IC50 range:
0.0358-0.054 nM). Although the Q91R substitution has
been described previously as a IN polymorphism [19],
this is the first time, to our knowledge, that these mutations are associated with resistance to RAL. Viral replicative capacity did not seem to be affected by the Q91R
and I175M mutations as the double mutant virus
reached the same viral titer as the wild type virus in the
absence of RAL pressure.
To assess the potential clinical impact of these mutations, we searched whether they emerged naturally
among the IN sequences of our HIV-2 cohort. The
Q91R mutation was detected in one isolate from one
treatment-naïve patient, and AA I175 was wild-type in
that sample. I175V and I175T polymorphisms were
detected in samples from 4 patients and 1 patient
respectively, but the I175M mutation was never detected
(Figure 1).
IN was then modeled three-dimensionally using the
ViewerLite software. 3D-modelling revealed that residue
91 is located on the surface of the enzyme, at the
entrance of a pocket that hosts the DDE catalytic triad,
and that residue 175 lies in a hydrophobic core region
(Figure 3). In such a model, a positive charge at residue
91 could compromise the affinity between RAL and the
enzymatic pocket and the I175M substitution may
emerge to facilitate access of RAL to the enzymatic
pocket [33]. It is possible that the genetic context of the
ROD strain, or its relative replicative capacity in the presence of RAL, might favor the emergence of strains harboring the Q91R+I175M mutations over other resistance

Page 7 of 11

pathways including the Q148 H/R/K and/or N155 H
substitutions. Whether the 91R+175M mutations can be
selected in other HIV-2 strains, as well as the relative
impact of each individual mutation on sensitivity to RAL,
to other INIs, and their respective impact on replicative
capacity, require further investigation. The potential
selective advantage of each pathway within different contexts is currently being investigated.

Conclusions
In this study, we described HIV-2 IN polymorphisms
detected in group A clinical isolates from 39 patients
and in group B isolates from 6 patients. Our data
strengthen a previous report on HIV-2 IN polymorphisms [14] and highlight the importance of those residues
that remain fully conserved across HIV types and subtypes/groups, including the HHCC Zinc-coordination
motif, the DDE catalytic triad and the RKK motif, as
well as most residues that ensure enzyme multimerization and correct binding to DNA and positioning. Moreover, we report for the first time the selection of two
mutations, Q91R and I175M, under RAL selective pressure. Phenotypic assays with the Q91R + I175M ROD
double mutant confirmed the role of these mutations in
resistance to RAL showing that they account for a 13fold decrease in susceptibility to RAL. 3D modeling with
ViewerLite indicated that residue 91 lies at the entrance
of the pocket that hosts the DDE catalytic triad, and
that adding a positive charge at position 91 by switching
a Gln to Arg might compromise IN-RAL affinity. How
and why these mutations are selected in the context of
HIV-2 IN and their relative contribution to resistance to
RAL with respect to the more classical mutations at
residues 143, 148 and 155 will require further investigation. Taken together, data retrieved from this study
should help build more robust HIV-2-specific algorithms for the genotypic interpretation of INI resistance.
Methods
Patients and sequences

Figure 3 Positions selected in vitro under RAL pressure in an
HIV-2 integrase 3D model. A 3D-model of the HIV-2 integrase
(pdb: 3F9K) was modified using the ViewerLite software. The
residues involved in IN enzymatic activity were highlighted, as well
as positions 91 and 175, which were mutated under RAL pressure.
The N-terminal and catalytic domains are represented as: A. Line
ribbons; B. Sticks; C. Molecular surface.

Fourty-six HIV-2-infected, INI-naïve patients from the
Belgian, Luxembourg and Malian cohorts were included
in this study. For 7 patients from Belgium and Luxembourg, longitudinal samples were available, and the earliest treatment-naïve (baseline) and latest treatmentexperienced samples were selected for sequencing (i.e.
53 samples were sequenced). The full pol gene from 53
samples was sequenced from frozen plasma collected
between 1997 and 2008: 36 IN sequences (from 29
patients) were from the Belgium and Luxembourg
cohorts, and 17 were from the Malian cohort. Patients
originated from different countries, as summarized in
Table 1. Thirty-eight IN sequences were retrieved from
treatment-naïve patients (baseline) and 15 from

Perez-Bercoff et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:98
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/98

treatment-experienced patients: 6 patients infected with
HIV-2 group A had been exposed to 2-4 NRTIs, 8
patients (7 infected with HIV-2 group A and one
infected with a group B strain) were treated with 2-4
NRTIs + 1 or 2 PIs, and for one patient infected with
HIV-2 group A, treatment was unknown. PR and RT
were sequenced as well and PR-RT sequences are available for 48 of the 51 samples (36 PR-RT sequences for
treatment-naïve samples and 14 PR-RT for the treatment-experienced samples. Variability and polymorphisms were defined with respect to the ROD (Genbank
X05294) and EHO (U27200) reference sequences, representing HIV-2 group A and group B respectively.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the longitudinal sequences from patients for
which 2 samples (one baseline and one treatmentexposed) were available clustered together, as expected.
However, for one patient, the 2 longitudinal sequences
(GU966548 and GU966572) also clustered with the
sequence (GU966559) from one treatment-naïve
patient with whom no common history was documented (sequences GU966548 and GU966572 differed
from sequence GU966559 by 8 and 4 positions respectively). In order to exclude the risk of biases due to
potential contamination, sequence GU966559 was
excluded from further analyses. Therefore, 52 IN
sequences from 45 patients were maintained for this
analysis.
RNA amplification and sequencing

Whole blood was collected in EDTA-tubes, plasma and
cell pellets were separated by centrifugation and stored
at -80°C until use. 1 ml of plasma was ultracentrifuged
for 1 hour at 25,000 g; RNA was extracted and purified
using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) and eluted in 50 ul of elution buffer. 10 μl
were reverse transcribed to amplify the IN or the PR-RT
coding regions using Super-Script One-Step RT-PCR
with 2.5 U Platinium Taq (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California) in a 50 μl mix containing 50 pmol
of outer primers. The PR-RT region was amplified as
described previously [34]. For IN RNA amplification,
forward primer JR25 (5’-GCACCTCCAACTAATCCT3’, nucleotide 2528 of the ROD sequence) and reverse
primer JR47 (5’-ATTACCCTGCTGCAAGTCCACC-3’,
ROD nt 5041) were used for the RT-PCR step and 2 μl
of cDNA were amplified using 2.5 U Platinium Taq
with forward primer H2Mp9 [34] and reverse primer
JR46 (5’-ATGCCCATCCCACCTTATGGTG-3’, ROD nt
5019). The IN and PR-RT PCR products were purified
on a Microcon column (Millipore, Molsheim, France).
The following primers were used to sequence the PR
and RT coding regions: forward primers H2Mp3,
H2Mp6 and H2Mp9, and reverse primers H2Mp4,

Page 8 of 11

H2Mp5, H2Mp7, H2Mp8 and H2Mp10 [34]. For the IN
regions, forward primers H2Mp9 [34], JR44 (5’GAGACCTTCTACACAGATGG-3’, ROD nt 3689),
JR45 (5’-TATGTTGCATGGGTCCCAGC-3’, ROD nt
3971) and AV33 (5’-GTGAAGATGGTAGCATGGTGG3’, ROD nt 4433), and reverse primers JR46 (5’-ATGCCCATCCCACCTTATGGTG-3’, ROD nt 5019), and JR48
(5’-GTTCTATACCTATCCACC-3’, ROD nt 4466) were
used. Sequencing reactions were performed using the
Big Dye Terminator cycle-sequencing kit 3.1 on an ABI
3130 xl sequencer following the manufacturer recommendations (Applied Biosystems-Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California). The nucleotide sequences were
aligned against the HIV-2 ROD and EHO strains, and
mutations were searched using the IDNS (Integrated
Database Network System) from Smartgene (Zug,
Switzerland).
Genbank accession numbers

The complete IN coding sequences of the 53 sequenced
HIV-2 samples are available in Genbank under the accession numbers GU966535 through GU966581 group A
and HM771234 through HM771239 for group B; the
ROD-Q91R+I175M double mutant Genbank accession
number is HM771240. Forty-seven PR-RT sequences are
available under Genbank accession numbers between
EF611309 to EF611333[12], and from HQ451906 to
HQ451937. Additional file 1: ‘Correspondence between
Genbank IN and PR-RT accession numbers’, summarizes
the correspondences between PR-RT and IN sequences.
Subtyping and phylogenetic analyses

The HIV-2 group was determined for the 3 genes PR,
RT and IN through clustering analyses using RAxML
v. 7.0.4 and the GTRGAMMA model, rapid bootstrapping (100 runs), and maximum likelihood selection of
the optimal tree according to the Rega and Star
algorithms.
Phylogenetic analyses of the IN sequences were performed as follows: the appropriate substitution model
for the phylogenetic tree was selected with TOPALi v.
2.5. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the
bayesian information criterion (BIC) chose the GTR
model with invariant sites and rate variation among
sites. The tree was calculated using RAxML v. 7.0.4 with
100 bootstrap replicates and is included as additional
file 2: ‘Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-2 group A and
group B IN sequences’.
Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using R v.2.8.1. The
number of variable positions between IN and RT and
IN and PR was compared using a Fisher exact test, and
p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Perez-Bercoff et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:98

Shannon’s entropy at each position was calculated using
the Los Alamos Database sequence Entropy website
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/
entropy_one.html for group A and group B strains.
Because of the small sample size, variable positions and
positions tolerating at least 2 AA changes are highlighted.
When polymorphisms were found in sequential samples
(one treatment-naïve and one treatment-experienced)
from the same patient, they were counted only once, in
the treatment-naïve group.
Viral culture under drug-selective pressure

MT-4 cells [35-37] were obtained through the AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of
AIDS, NIAID, NIH: MT-4 from Douglas Richman. RAL
(monopotassium salt) was supplied by Merck & CO,
INC (NJ, US).
Twice a week, 2 × 106 MT-4 cells were infected with 2
× 108 TCID 50 of HIV-2 ROD (obtained from the NIH
AIDS Research Reagent Program) in 2 ml of RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 50 ug/
ml gentamicin, 10% fetal clone 1 bovine serum (all from
Gibco - Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). After at least two hours
of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO 2 (gently mixed every
hour), cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 10
ml of culture medium in the presence of RAL. The initial
RAL concentration (0.001 nM) was lower than the mean
ROD IC50 (0.00395 nM). Virus titers were determined
using a previously described real-time PCR protocol
[38,39]. Drug concentrations were raised gradually by 3fold and at each drug increment, two separate cultures
were maintained, one with the former concentration of
drug (back-up culture) and one with the new, increased
concentration. If the viral titer remained stable during 5
successive passages at the higher concentration, the drug
level was increased further by 3-fold. Sequencing of the
IN coding region was performed as described above,
using 1 ml of culture supernatant.
Phenotypic sensitivity to RAL
MTT assay

RAL inhibitory effect (IC50) on the HIV-induced cytopathic effect was assessed in MT-4 cell cultures using
an MTT assay as previously described [40]. The assay is
based on the reduction of the yellow MTT (3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)
to purple formazan by living cells. The parental HIV-2
ROD was used as a reference. 30 × 104 MT-4 cells/well
of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate were infected in quadruplicate wells with 50 ul of viral culture supernatant, in
the presence of 0.075% sodium bicarbonate and
1% hepes (both from Gibco - Invitrogen, Paisley, UK)

× 10-5 nM to 20 nM. After 3 days of incubation at 37°C
in 5% CO2, 150 l of supernatant were removed carefully
from each well without disturbing the cells. Thirty l of
MTT solution were added to each well (in vitro cytotoxicity assay kit MTT based, Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis,
MO, USA) and the plate was incubated for 4 hours at
37°C in 5% CO 2. Formazan crystals were then solubilized with 100 ul of acidified isopropanol (HCl 0.1 N,
Triton X-100 10% V/V) and by shaking the plate during
10 minutes. Absorbance was measured at 540/ 690 nm
and the percentage of protection (PP = (O.D. measured
- O.D. infected cells without RAL)/O.D. uninfected cells
- O.D. infected cells without RAL) × 100). Mock
infected cells are expected to strongly reduce the MTT
substrate and to produce the highest O.D., reflecting the
highest cell survival level in the absence of virus;
infected cells in the absence of RAL, in contrast, are
unprotected and thus minimally reduce the MTT substrate, as reflected by O.D. measures comparable to
background. With increasing RAL levels, an increasing
number of cells is expected to be protected from HIVinduced cytopathic effects, and the O.D. is expected to
increase. RAL IC50 was computed using the GraphPad
Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).
3-D modeling

A 3D-model of the HIV-2 integrase (pdb: 3F9K) was
modified using the ViewerLite software.
Ethical approval

The present study was conceived according to the Helsinki Convention norms and was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculté de Médecine, de
Pharmacie et d’Odontostomatologie of the University of
Bamako (Mali), and by the biomedical ethical commission of the UCLouvain (Brussels, Belgium) - 2009/
04MAR/084 B40320096021.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Correspondence between Genbank IN and PR-RT
accession numbers. Genbank IN and PR-RT accession numbers, as well
as some clinical data (including treatment experience and eventually
treatment, and country) are reported.
Additional file 2: Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-2 group A and
group B IN sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of the 53 IN sequences
from the 46 HIV-2 infected, INI-naïve patients (Genbank accession
numbers GU966535 through GU966581 for group A and HM771234
through HM771239 for group B) were performed using TOPALi v. 2.5.
The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) chose the GTR model with invariant sites and rate variation
among sites. The tree was calculated using RAxML v. 7.0.4 with 100
bootstrap replicates. The strain SIV MAC.US.x.239.M33262 served as the
outgroup.
