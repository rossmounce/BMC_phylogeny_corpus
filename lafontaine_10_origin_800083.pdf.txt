Origin and fate of pseudogenes in
Hemiascomycetes: a comparative analysis
Research article

Ingrid Lafontaine*1,2 and Bernard Dujon1,2,3

Abstract
Background: Pseudogenes are ubiquitous genetic elements that derive from functional genes after mutational
inactivation. Characterization of pseudogenes is important to understand genome dynamics and evolution, and its
significance increases when several genomes of related organisms can be compared. Among yeasts, only the genome
of the S. cerevisiae reference strain has been analyzed so far for pseudogenes.
Results: We present here the first comparative analysis of pseudogenes within the fully sequenced and annotated
genomes of eight yeast species, spanning the entire phylogenetic range of Hemiascomycetes. A total of 871
pseudogenes were found, out of which mutational degradation patterns and consequences on the genetic repertoire
of each species could be identified. We found that most pseudogenes in yeasts originate from mutational degradation
of gene copies formed after species-specific duplications but duplications of pseudogenes themselves are also
encountered. In all yeasts, except in Y. lipolytica, pseudogenes tend to cluster in subtelomeric regions where they can
outnumber the number of functional genes from 3 to 16 times. Pseudogenes are generally not conserved between the
yeast species studied (except in two cases), consistent with their large evolutionary distances, but tend to be
conserved among S. cerevisiae strains. Reiterated pseudogenization of some genes is often observed in different
lineages and may affect functions essential in S. cerevisiae, which are, therefore, lost in other species. Although a variety
of functions are affected by pseudogenization, there is a bias towards functions involved in the adaptation of the yeasts
to their environment, and towards genes of unknown functions.
Conclusions: Our work illustrates for the first time the formation of pseudogenes in different branches of
hemiascomycetous yeasts, showing their limited conservation and how they testify for the adaptation of the yeasts
functional repertoires.
Background
Since their original discovery [1], pseudogenes have been
found in all studied genomes so far, within the three kingdoms of life [2-4]. Their proportions vary greatly, however, from one organism to another, depending on
lifestyle (free-living or association) and on genome properties (rates of duplication, mutation, deletion, and retrotransposition). Pseudogenes correspond to ca. 3% of the
gene repertoire of Drosophila melanogaster, while there
are approximately as many pseudogenes as functional
genes in the human genome (http://pseudogenes.org).
Pseudogenes are often species-specific and, within small
genomes, tend to accumulate in chromosomal regions

such as subtelomeres or heterochromatin, minimizing
possible deleterious effects [5-7].
The historical definition of a pseudogene is a DNA
sequence that looks like an active gene but has lost its
ability to code for a functional product, due to more or
less extensive mutational disablements. Pseudogene formation is frequently observed in pathogenic organisms
undergoing reductive evolution while benefiting from
host functions [8-11]. Pseudogenes can also correspond
to the non-functionalization of a duplicated gene copy
[12,13] that originated either from DNA duplication or
from retro-transposition [14,15]. Sequence degradation
may range from a single disabling mutation, such as a
frameshift or an in-frame stop codon in a protein-coding
gene, to extensive changes including numerous insertions
and deletions [7,16].

In all genomes, most pseudogenes are likely to disappear with time by the accumulation of successive mutations [9]. Those with limited alterations, however, may be
repaired by reverse mutations, gene conversion or may be
reactivated by translational recoding events [17,18].
Some pseudogenes can also acquire a new functional
role, such as the control of another gene expression, or
the generation of genetic diversity (see [19] for a review),
and give rise to new genes, such as the human XIST noncoding RNA gene, which evolved from a pseudogene of a
protein-coding sequence [20].
In Fungi, only pseudogenes of particular genes or pathways of interest have been described [21-24]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two systematic analyses performed by
different approaches [6,7] both concluded to the paucity
of pseudogenes of anciently protein-coding sequences in
the yeast genome. In order to determine the mechanisms
of pseudogene formation across several related species,
their age and the functions affected by pseudogenization,
we performed the first systematic comparative analysis of
the pseudogene repertoire in a set of eight hemiascomycetous yeasts spanning a large evolutionary range, similar
or larger than the phylum of Chordates [25,26]. We show
that these genomes also contain a limited number of
pseudogenes, independently of their global level of gene
redundancy. Most pseudogenes originate from duplicated gene copies resulting from previous DNA duplication events, but a few could correspond to retroprocessed sequences. Some pseudogenes are formed
from single-copy gene and hence correspond to a functional loss in the yeast species. The relative paucity of
pseudogenes suggests that functionally inactive genes are
rapidly eliminated in hemiascomycetous genomes
because their sequence diverges rapidly or because they
are successively truncated, or entirely deleted.

Methods
Genomes and protein sequences

Sequences and annotations were taken from the Génolevures database (http://www.genolevures.org) for Candida glabrata, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Kluyveromyces
lactis, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Saccharomyces
kluyveri, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica,
and from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://
www.yeastgenome.org/) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All
these sequenced strains are haploids. Note that the annotation files already contained 457 protein-coding pseudogenes. The protein databank used for comparison
contains the translational products of the 44,174 annotated CDS from all eight studied genomes (http://
www.genolevures.org/yeastgenomes.html). We used the
protein family classification constructed by the Génolevures consortium [27].

Whole genome shotgun sequences of S. cerevisiae haploid strains AWRI1631, JAY291, M22, RM11-1a, YJM789,
YPS163 and EC1118 were retrieved at EMBL (EMBL:
ACFL01000000,
ABPC00000000,
ABSV00000000,
AAEG01000000, AAFW00000000 and ABPD00000000,
respectively), as well as the genomic scaffolds of the strain
EC1118 (EMBL: FN393058-FN393060, FN393062FN393087, FN394216, and FN394217).
Identification of the pseudogenes

We developed a set of automatic procedures to obtain an
exhaustive list of the potential pseudogenes of anciently
protein-coding genes in a given genome. Each genome
sequence is given to FASTY [28] and translated into the 6
frames for detection of amino acid similarity against the
translational products of the 44,174 annotated CDS from
the studied genomes (no pseudogenes from full protein
sequences encoded in the nuclear genomes could be
retrieved outside of the hemiascomycetes in the Uniprot
database).
The matches selected have at least 25% identity and are
considered statistically significant if their estimated Zscore [29] is greater or equal to 200 (corresponding to Evalues lower than 10-6). This cut-off was chosen after
examining the distribution of the Z-scores for all
obtained results. When several matches overlap, the similarity region is delimited from the left-most to the rightmost aligned sequences.
Protein domain conservation

All matches similar to a protein of unknown function
were queried against the PFAM database [30] of conserved domains with the HMMER algorithm[31].
Identification of the pseudogenes in S. cerevisiae strains

The regions corresponding to the pseudogenes in the S.
cerevisiae reference strain S288C were retrieved in the
whole genome shotgun sequences of the strains
AWRI1631, EC1118, JAY291, M22, RM11-1a, YJM789
and YPS163 by a FASTA search at the nucleotide level.
These identified regions were then queried against the
protein bestmatches of the corresponding pseudogenes
in S288C with FASTY. We concluded to the presence of a
pseudogene in the considered strain if evidence for coding sequence degradation is proposed in the FASTY
alignment (see criteria 3 in section below). The pseudogenes present in strains M22 and YPS163 but not in
S288C were identified based on the work by [32].
Selection criteria

Pseudogenes are defined from the similarity regions
using the following criteria: 1) no overlap or partial overlap with an already annotated functional genetic element
on the same DNA strand; 2) possible overlap of less than
100 nucleotides with an already annotated functional

genetic element on the opposite DNA strand; 3) evidence
for coding sequence degradation: at least one in-frame
stop codon, one frameshift mutation, or a truncation of at
least 30% relatively to the cognate CDS (truncated
pseudogenes smaller than 120 nucleotides are ignored,
unless their cognate CDS is itself smaller than 120 nucleotides).
Each selected potential pseudogene is aligned to its
bestmatch with GENEWISE [33] to predict the corresponding coding sequence. Fifteen candidates were discarded after this step because GENEWISE predicted an
intact CDS while FASTY introduced a frameshift mutation in the alignment.
The pseudogenes identified in this study are available at
the Génolevures website (http://www.genolevures.org/).
The algorithm for pseudogene detection was written for
our own analysis, considering that annotations of the
genomes studied are of high quality. It is available upon
request to the authors.

Detection of processed pseudogenes

Pseudogene nomenclature

Correlation tests were done with the method of Spearman implemented in R [36]. We accepted a correlation
between data sets when the p-value was lower than 0.05.

Each detected pseudogene is numbered serially from left
to right of the chromosome, based on the nomenclature
proposed in [34]. The name indicates the species (four
letters), the project or strain number (one numeral), the
chromosome (one letter), and the pseudogene nature of
the sequence ("p") followed by the serial number (for
example, CAGL0Ap1).
Sequence divergence analysis

We assumed that substitutions at the third codon position of a protein coding sequence (or an ancient protein
coding sequence) evolve according to a neutral molecular
clock. Estimations of the evolutionary distances by several substitution models (JC69, F84 and HKY85) are saturated for half of our data set and, therefore, were not
retained for analysis. P-distances are then computed for
amino acid and for nucleotide sequences on the third
codon position. To conserve the frame of the coding
sequences, the nucleotide alignment is derived from the
amino acid alignment (in-house script) of the translated
products of the pseudogene and its cognate gene
obtained by GENEWISE. The nucleotide alignments
between functional paralogs are derived from the amino
acid alignments obtained by MUSCLE [35].
Synteny conservation

Pairwise synteny was examined in windows of five CDS
upstream and five CDS downstream of the pseudogene
and any of its homolog in another genome. We confirmed
conservation of synteny if at least two pairs of homologous neighbors are found within the window.

To determine if a pseudogene could arose from a retrotransposition event, we systematically checked for classical retro-transposition hallmarks: lack of intron with
respect to their paralog CDS, retrotransposon-related
sequences within the first flanking annotated elements of
the pseudogene (one upstream and one downstream),
and polyA-tail at the 3'-end of the pseudogene. For this
last check, we analyzed the A content of the 3'-end flanking region (500 nucleotides) of each pseudogene. We considered as a potential poly(A)-tail, a window of 50
nucleotides containing at least 35 adenines, with at least
one stretch of 5 adenines, and less than 10 thymines. To
avoid fortuitous signals due to AT-rich sequences, the
same procedure was performed on 1000 random
sequences (with identical nucleotide composition). Only
sequences for which no signal was detected in the random sequences were considered as potential poly(A)-tail.
Statistical analysis

Results
Strategy

We systematically searched for all potential pseudogenes
of ancient protein-coding genes within 8 completely
sequenced and annotated genomes of Hemiascomycetes:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata (two
Saccharomycetaceae that underwent ancient polyploidization), Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Kluyveromyces
lactis, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Saccharomyces
kluyveri (four protoploid Saccharomycetaceae), and
Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica, members of the «CTG» group and of the Dipodascaceae,
respectively (http://www.genolevures.org). To do this, we
compared each genome sequence to the set of 44,174
protein-coding sequences (CDS) annotated in these
genomes (see Methods). We considered here as pseudogene any sequence that simultaneously -i- does not overlap an already annotated genetic element, -ii- shares
sequence similarity with an annotated CDS (either in the
same genome or in one or several other yeast genomes
considered) and -iii- shows disabling mutations in the
reading frame: in-frame stop codon, frameshift mutation
or truncation of more than 30% relatively to the CDS. We
chose this limit of 30% because, among the functional
members of a given protein coding gene family, the length
variation does not exceed 30% in the majority of cases
(data not shown). Inactive pseudogenes resulting solely
from mutations in promoters, as well as pseudogenes
without detectable similarity among the eight studied
genomes are, therefore, excluded from our analysis. Simi-

larly, we do not question the genome annotations: an
annotated gene that appears truncated compared to other
homologous sequences will not be considered as a
pseudogene because truncation does not necessarily
imply inactivation (experimental work is needed to precise such a point).
Complete set of detected pseudogenes and sequence
degradation patterns

We found a total of 871 pseudogenes among the 8 yeast
genomes (see Additional file 1, Table S1 for complete list
and Methods for nomenclature). They correspond to 418
distinct protein families or singletons. The total number
of pseudogenes varies significantly between species: from
38 in C. glabrata to 230 in Y. lipolytica, corresponding to
only 0.7% and 3.6% of the annotated CDS, respectively
(Table 1).
The pseudogenes identified exhibit a large panel of
sequence degradation, ranging from only a few mutational disablements to extensive truncations. We distinguished here the «full-size» pseudogenes, i.e. those
extending over more than 70% of their closest functional
homolog, from the «truncated» pseudogenes (Table 1).
In S. cerevisiae, S. kluyveri, K. thermotolerans and K.
lactis, the number of «full-size» pseudogenes exceeds
truncated ones. The opposite is true for C. glabrata, Z.
rouxii, D. hansenii and Y. lipolytica. There are as many
pseudogenes truncated from their 3'-end, as those truncated from their 5'-end (Table 1), consistent with the idea
that truncation results from deletion at the DNA level
rather than incomplete cDNA formation, characteristic
of retro-processed pseudogenes. «Full-size» pseudogenes
contain more disabling mutations (in-frame stop codons
and frameshifts) than truncated pseudogenes (except in

D. hansenii and Y. lipolytica) (Additional file 1, Table S1).
We found four pseudogenes (DEHA2Bp3, DEHA2Cp3,
DEHA2Dp5, DEHA2Ep5) inactivated by insertion of a
DNA fragment of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs), as previously described [37].
Sequence divergence between pseudogenes and their best
functional homologs

In the absence of the actual ancestral coding sequences of
the pseudogenes, we estimated the distances between
pseudogenes and their closest functional homologs (bestmatches) to measure their degree of mutational decay
(Additional file 1, Table S1; see Methods for details). Distributions of the p-distances were calculated for each
yeast species (figure 1). They range from 0 to 0.8 globally.
The distributions are different if one considers pseudogenes whose bestmatch is not in the same genome and
pseudogenes whose bestmatch is a paralog in the same
genome. In the first case, distances are high, consistent
with the generally long evolutionary distances between
studied species. In the second case, distances are much
lower than that observed between functional paralogs in
the same genome, suggesting that many pseudogenes
arose after recent gene duplication events. The genomes
of S. kluyveri and K. thermotolerans contain the highest
proportions of highly diverged pseudogenes (half of them
differ by more than 60% from their bestmatches), while
the genomes of S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica contain the
highest proportions of less diverged pseudogenes (half of
them differ by less than 28% from their bestmatches).
Note that functional paralogs (right panel) in all these
genomes are issued from both ancient (prior to the speciation events) and recent (species-specific) duplications
[25].

Pseudogenes across species, conservation or independent
formation

A pseudogene should be free from any functional pressure and, therefore, should not be conserved over long
evolutionary periods, unless it acquires a functional role.
We, therefore, searched for pseudogenes conserved in
several yeast species as a possible functional signature. A

total of 274 pseudogenes are shared between at least two
species but 263 of them are located outside of any conserved synteny block and probably correspond to independent pseudogenization events of homologous genes
in different lineages. The remaining 9 pseudogenes are
found among five conserved synteny blocks, defining five
groups of orthologous pseudogenes (Figure 2). Note that

in this analysis. All these pseudogenes have no paralog in the genome. The topology of the species phylogeny [68] is given on the left of the figure
(branch lengths ignored).

we did not consider the syntenic orthologs of YIL009C-A
(EST3), YPL052W (OAZ1) and YOR239W (ABP140) as
pseudogenes, because they all bear the programmed
translational frameshift present in the functional genes of
S. cerevisiae [38]. According to the species phylogeny and
following parsimony criterion, three of these sets of
orthologous pseudogenes also correspond to independent pseudogenization events of the same gene in distinct
lineages (Set 3, 4 and 5 on Figure 2).
Pseudogenes SAKL0Gp7 and KLTH0Gp3, corresponding to YDR285W (ZIP1) of S. cerevisiae are conserved
between S. kluyveri and K. thermotolerans. ZIP1 is a
transverse filament protein of the synaptonemal complex
that is required for normal levels of meiotic recombination and pairing between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The 2 orthologous pseudogenes are «fullsize» and share a single common frameshift mutation
(data not shown). The most parsimonious hypothesis is
that the frameshift mutation appeared in the common
ancestor of these 2 species.
REC107 is a meiotic gene in S. cerevisiae, which has
been lost several times in hemiascomycetes [39]. This
gene is also pseudogenized in three of the newly
sequenced genomes studied. SAKL0Gp13 and
KLTH0Bp3 are conserved between S. kluyveri and K.
thermotolerans, suggesting a pseudogenization event in
their common ancestor. The orthologous gene is also
pseudogenized in Z. rouxii (ZYRO0Gp9), and probably
corresponds to another independent event. Unlike in the
previous case, the pseudogenes of this block of conserved
synteny are truncated and each copy accumulated several
species-specific disabling mutations.
Conservation of pseudogenes across S. cerevisiae strains

The genome sequences for the S. cerevisiae non-reference
strains are draft assemblies, not suitable for the pseudogene detection procedure developed in this work. How-

ever, to get a first estimation of pseudogene conservation
among strains, we examined the conservation of the
pseudogenes identified in the S. cerevisiae reference
strain S288C (Additional file 1, Table S1) among 7 other
sequenced strains (see Methods). We found that 62 of the
pseudogenes identified in S288C are also pseudogenized
in all other strains, suggesting that the pseudogenization
event occurred in their common ancestor. The 14 other
pseudogenes of S288C sometimes correspond to intact
coding sequences in one or a few other strains, indicating
more recent pseudogenization events (Table 2). 11 of
these 14 pseudogenes contain at least two degrading
mutations (in-frame stop codon or frameshift mutation)
and 8 of them are truncated at their 3' or 5' end. The only
pseudogene specific to S288C (SACE0Ip4) contains only
one internal stop codon.
Distribution of the pseudogenes among protein families
and corresponding functions

Based on sequence similarity, pseudogenes can be attributed to the functional gene families classified according
to their predicted translational products [27]. Such families contain groups of orthologs between species, as well
as groups of paralogs resulting from gene duplications
and losses (see [40] for a review). In each yeast species,
the majority of pseudogenes (from 51 to 88%) belong to
gene families with a functionally characterized S. cerevisiae member, which can be used to infer the probable
function of the gene that was pseudogenized. Interestingly, we observed a bias towards transporters, proteins
acting at the periphery of the cell, and enzymes (Table 3).
When normalized against the ratios of these functional
categories among active genes, the bias is conserved for
transporters and proteins acting at the periphery of the
cell, but not for enzymes. Among pseudogenes with no
ascribed function, there is no over-representation of
domains related to these three categories. Although the

number of pseudogenes is not directly correlated to the
number of its active paralogs in a given family, we
observed frequent formation of pseudogenes in these
functional categories. For example, there are11 pseudogenes in D. hansenii for the sugar transporter family, 12
pseudogenes in C. glabrata for the lectin-like protein
family, and 25 pseudogenes in Z. rouxii for the DUP240
gene family coding for membrane proteins (Additional
file 1, Table S2).
A total of 139 pseudogenes are similar to singleton
genes, and 288 (one third of total) belong to gene families

specific to a given species for which, unless in S. cerevisiae, there is usually no functional indication (Additional
file 1, Table S2).
Clustering of the pseudogenes in subtelomeres

Gene densities are nearly constant along yeast chromosomes, except for subtelomeres where the number of
active genes is reduced [41], and where genes can be transcriptionally silenced [42]. We, therefore, examined the
distribution of the pseudogenes along the chromosomes,
separating the subtelomeres (30 kilobases apart from the
telomeres or from sequenced chromosome ends) from

the central regions (Table 4). In all yeast species, pseudogenes exceed active genes in number (3 to 16 times more)
in the subtelomeres. In S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata and Z.
rouxii, more than half of the pseudogenes are found in
subtelomeres (70, 60 and 54%, respectively). This proportion is lower in K. thermotolerans, D. hansenii, S. kluyveri
and K. lactis (47, 40, 36 and 30% respectively), and drops
to only 5% in Y. lipolytica. The presence of rDNA loci in
the subtelomeres of Y. lipolytica (6 loci) might prevent
some pseudogenes accumulating in these regions, as well
as in D. hansenii (3 loci) and in C. glabrata (2 loci) [25].
Possible origin of the pseudogenes

We tried to define the origin of yeast pseudogenes based
on the presence or absence of a paralog in the same
genome and on the conservation of synteny between species (figure 3). The presence of an active paralog in the
genome reveals the occurrence of a previous duplication
event, followed by mutational inactivation of one of the 2
copies. The absence of any paralogs reveals the degradation of a single copy gene, hence the loss of the corresponding function in the species. The conservation of
synteny is a signature for mutational sequence degradation at the origin of the pseudogene. The non-conservation of synteny is compatible with a species-specific
duplication, either a retro-transposition event or a segmental duplication.
Pseudogenes originating after species-specific gene
duplications

and Z. rouxii, and less than 60% in K. lactis, K. thermotolerans and S. kluyveri. The majority of these pseudogenes
probably arose after segmental duplication, but some may
be processed pseudogenes, as suggested by a poly(A)
tract at their 3'-end or their location next to a retrotransposon-related sequence [43]. This would correspond to
only 3.5% of the pseudogenes in Y. lipolytica, and 20% of
the pseudogenes in K. thermotolerans. Only one pseudogene (DEHA2Ep25) was identified by the lack of intron
compared to its closest functional homolog.
Interestingly, we found duplications of pseudogenes, as
evidenced by their common pattern of degrading mutations. For example, in Y. lipolytica, we found five pseudogenes similar to YALI0A14927g (Figure 4), which, based
on phylogenetic analysis, suggest two original pseudogenization events in the history of this family. Note that
these pseudogenes are not located in subtelomeric
regions and are not part of larger duplicated regions
including other genes. These pseudogenes have thus not
been maintained in the genome by some selective pressure on the duplication of adjacent genes. Similarly, two
such cases of pseudogene multiplication were encountered in K. lactis, as well as 12 cases of pseudogene duplication (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Most pseudogenes located at the chromosome ends
arose after a species-specific gene duplication (Table 6):
from 60% in K. thermotolerans to 100% in Y. lipolytica.
Pseudogenes originating from ancestral gene duplications

More than half of the pseudogenes arose after a gene
duplication event specific to their own genome (Table 5).
This corresponds to the vast majority of pseudogenes in
S. cerevisiae, D. hansenii and Y. lipolytica (96, 87 and 93%,
respectively), ca. 70% of the pseudogenes in C. glabrata

Pseudogenes formed after ancestral gene duplications are
found in all yeast genomes (Table 5). Four pseudogenes,
SACE0Bp1, CAGL0Dp2, CAGLOHp3 and CAGL0Mp5
were formed after the whole-genome duplication event
that occurred in the common ancestor of C. glabrata and
S. cerevisiae [44] (Figure 5). This is a very small number

compared to the extensive loss of duplicated genes that
occurred by deletion [45]. Strikingly, there are more
pseudogenes originated from other ancestral duplications
in protoploid Saccharomycetaceae and in D. hansenii and
Y. lipolytica, suggesting that selective pressure on duplicated genes are different after whole-genome duplication
and other duplication events, such as segmental duplications.
Pseudogenes originating without previous gene duplication
and putative loss of function

Pseudogenes with no functional paralog (Additional file
2, Table S3) are found in all the studied genomes and
could, therefore, correspond to a functional loss. The
genomes of K. lactis, K. thermotolerans, S. kluyveri and C.
glabrata contain the highest proportions of such pseudogenes (23%, 26%, 25% and 20%, respectively). The lowest
proportions are found in D. hansenii and in Y. lipolytica
(5% and 3%, respectively), consistent with the higher gene
redundancy in these genomes [26]. There is no bias
towards any functional category (Additional file 2, Table
S3). Pseudogenes homologous to essential genes in S. cer-

evisiae are found in all species, except in K. lactis.
Repeated pseudogenization of the same gene is also
encountered in this category. For example, pseudogenes
CAGL0Mp1 and ZYRO0Gp11, similar to the essential
chromosomal passenger gene YJR089W (BIR1), have no
homolog in their respective genome.
Finally, we noticed three interesting pseudogenes in S.
cerevisiae that correspond to horizontally acquired genes.
SACE0Fp3 and SACE0Fp2 have no homolog in S. cerevisiae but were identified by similarity to DEHA2D01122g
(similar to a bacterial tryptophan synthase) and
DEHA2E07282g (similar to a bacterial glyoxalase),
respectively. Absence of these genes among hemiascomycetes suggests that four independent horizontal gene
transfer events have occurred, the two genes in S. cerevisiae being secondarily pseudogenized. The third one,
SACE0Np2 is a duplicated and identical copy of
SACE0Fp2, revealing the expansion of horizontally transferred inactivated genes. The transfers must have
occurred in an ancestor of all the studied strains of S. cerevisiae because the homologs of SACE0Fp3, SACE0Fp2

Discussion
We present here the first systematic search for pseudogenes in the genomes of eight distinct yeast species spanning
the
whole
evolutionary
spectrum
of
hemiascomycetes. Because our method of detection
relies on sequence similarity with annotated protein coding genes, the total number of pseudogenes identified
(871) represents a minimal estimate (pseudogenes without any functional homolog or with alteration of their
promoter sequences were not examined). Among the
genomes analyzed here, only S. cerevisiae has been the
subject of previous systematic analysis of the pseudogene
content [6,7]. Our analysis revealed a smaller number of
pseudogenes in this species (77) because we deliberately
ignored partial overlaps with annotated genetic elements.
On the contrary, additional pseudogenes were identified
based on our multi-species sequence comparisons. These
differences illustrate the difficulties in listing all pseudogenes in a given genome. Despite this fact and numerical
variations between yeast species, our results demonstrate
that the proportion of pseudogenes compared to active
genes remains low in all hemiascomycetous genomes
studied (comparable to the proportion of pseudogenes in
D. melanogaster and much smaller than the proportions
in mammalian genomes, see http://pseudogenes.org).
Our comparative analysis of pseudogenes across an
entire yeast phylum provides a unique data set to examine their origin and evolutionary conservation. We found

that pseudogenes in yeasts are formed either by disabling
mutations (in-frame stop codons and frameshift mutations) or by extensive truncations. The general absence of
conservation of pseudogenes between yeast species is
consistent with their large evolutionary distances [25,26]
and indicates that new pseudogenes were formed within
each lineage. However, intra-species conservation of
pseudogenes is high: about 80% of the pseudogenes in the
S. cerevisiae reference strain are old enough to be conserved among 7 other strains of this species. Poor conservation of pseudogenes is also observed between
mammalian species [46,47]. Most of the pseudogenes
correspond to duplicated gene copies, illustrating the
extensive dynamics of gene duplications in the yeast
genomes, most probably segmental duplications, as
observed in S. cerevisiae [48]. Only few pseudogenes correspond to duplicated gene copies formed by the ancestral whole-genome duplication common to C. glabrata
and S. cerevisiae [44]. This is consistent with the idea that
most duplicated copies were lost by complete deletion, as
previously proposed [45,49], or with the possibility that
pseudogenes have been degraded beyond recognition,
given the time elapsed since the whole-genome duplication event. Among the protoploid Saccharomycetaceae,
the presence of species-specific pseudogenes within conserved synteny blocks indicates their relatively recent formation, to the notable exception of two ancestral
pseudogenes conserved in S. kluyveri and K. thermotolerans, the more closely related pairs of species studied. The
general absence of conserved pseudogenes confirms that

most of the observed pseudogenes are on their way to
complete degradation.
According to Doniger et al., [32] 49 pseudogenes containing an internal in-frame stop codon (based on our
own criteria) and 5 pseudogenes containing a frameshift
mutation are present in either M22 or YPS163, while they
correspond to intact coding sequences in S288C. From
the alignment of the three genomes within coding
regions, it appears that the loss of a gene by deletion is

much more frequent (3 deleted genes for 19 large indels
(>100 bp)) than the creation of a pseudogene by a substitution event (49 pseudogenes for 46807 SNP) or by an
indel event (5 pseudogenes for 960 small indels (< 100
bp)). According to Lynch et al. [50], the rate of gene loss,
2.1 × 10-6 per gene per cell division, is much higher than
the base-substitutional rate, 0.33 × 10-9 per site per cell
division. It should then be much more frequent to lose a
gene by deletion than to create a pseudogene.

Figure 5 Pseudogenes in pairs of ohnologs in Saccharomycetaceae. Same legend as Figure 2. Pairs of ohnologs, i.e. paralogs originating from the
whole-genome duplication [70], are linked by brackets.

Unlike their abundance in mammalian genomes
[15,51], only few pseudogenes may have originated from
retro-transposition events in yeasts. But their presence
suggests that, as experimentally demonstrated in S. cerevisiae [43,52,53], retro-transposition occurred in these
genomes, although a very small number of active retrotransposons are usually present [25,54]. The number of
retro-processed pseudogenes in yeasts is, however, probably underestimated because their identification is difficult given the small number of intron-containing genes.
The few detected pseudogenes homologous to introncontaining genes are all truncated and do not span the
intron insertion-site, except in one case (DEHA2Ep25).
Pseudogenes without functional paralog suggest functional loss in the corresponding species, unless a nonhomologous gene encodes a similar function [55]. In S.
cerevisiae, the fact that about half of the pseudogenes correspond to unknown functions is striking given that there
remain only 17% of the genes not yet functionally characterized in this species [56]. This suggests that the divergence of functional repertoire between yeast species
primarily concerns functions not yet identified. The frequent occurrence of pseudogenes corresponding to
transporters or protein acting at the periphery of the cell
may be correlated with the tendency of such genes to
cluster in the subtelomeric regions, which are highly
dynamic in terms of gene duplications and losses
[38,41,57] and often concern functions involved in the
adaptation of the species to its environment [22,58]. The
highly dynamical behavior of such families is supported
by the fact that 3 to 16 times more pseudogenes than
genes are found in the subtelomeric regions. The vast
majority of pseudogenes in the subtelomeres originated
from a species-specific duplication. This bias could be
correlated to the accelerated base-pair substitution
observed in the subtelomeres, which probably also contributes to adaptive evolution [59]. It also suggests that

pseudogenes issued from ancestral duplication and function loss are not preferentially maintained in subtelomeres with respect to central regions of chromosomes.
In S. cerevisiae, pseudogenes of highly connected genes
are significantly under-represented, possibly reflecting
the lower propensity of gene loss among these genes: 6%
of the pseudogenes of genes coding for protein in complexes against 28% of the active genes [60] and 59% of
pseudogenes of genes with a genetic interaction profile
against 75% of the active genes [61].
Whether pseudogenes correspond to intermediate gene
states before complete erasure or steady states conferring
selective advantages remains an open question and may
be case-specific. Our data provide no indication as to
whether pseudogenes may be transcribed or not. However, according to available experimental data in S. cerevisiae (oligonucleotide tiling array experiments [62], 3'-long
SAGE approach [63], and direct RNA sequencing [64]),
12 of the 77 detected pseudogenes appear to be transcribed (Table 7). Evidence of transcription also exists in
C. glabrata and Y. lipolytica (H. Müller, personal communication; C. Neuvéglise, personal communication). The
transcription products of pseudogenes may be directly
targeted to the degradation machinery such as NMD [65],
but they could also play some role in the cell by interfering with the expression of functional genes. Moreover, as
previously suggested [6], pseudogenes with few disabling
mutations could constitute a reservoir of functional protein products if recoding events occur, such as programmed frameshift (See [38] for a comparative analysis
of the programmed frameshifting in Saccharomycetales),
or bypass of the stop-codon [66].

Conclusions
Pseudogenes are found in all yeast genomes, albeit in limited number compared to genomes of multi-cellular
eukaryotes. They mostly result from lineage-specific

mutational degradations that may correlate with species
adaptation to their environment. Yeast pseudogenes
show a wide range of mutational alterations, consistent
with their rapid evolution, hence their absence of conservation between species. Along with complete gene deletion, pseudogene formation contributes to the rapid
genome evolution by gene duplication and loss in yeasts.
The paucity of observed pseudogenes across the entire
phylum of Hemiascomycetes suggests that pseudogene
formation is not the main mechanism of gene loss within
these genomes. This could be explained by the low estimated rate for pseudogene formation across S. cerevisiae
strains, compared to the estimated rate of gene deletion.
However, despite their unlikely occurrence, pseudogenes
do exist in the yeast genomes. They appear mainly by
species-specific duplications and testify for the adaptation of the cell to its environment. Their poor conservation across species suggests that most of them are likely
to disappear.
