Abstract
Background: Evolution of synonymous codon usage is thought to be determined by a balance
between mutation, genetic drift and natural selection on translational efficiency. However, natural
selection on codon usage is considered to be a weak evolutionary force and selection on codon
usage is expected to be strongest in species with large effective population sizes.
Results: I examined the evolution of synonymous codons using EST data from five species of
Populus. Data on relative synonymous codon usage in genes with high and low gene expression
were used to identify 25 codons from 18 different amino acids that were deemed to be preferred
codons across all five species. All five species show significant correlations between codon bias and
gene expression, independent of base composition, thus indicating that translational selection has
shaped synonymous codon usage. Using a set of 158 orthologous genes I detected an excess of
unpreferred to preferred (U → P) mutations in two lineages, P. tremula and P. deltoides. Maximum
likelihood estimates of the strength of selection acting on synonymous codons was also significantly
greater than zero in P. tremula, with the ML estimate of 4Nes = 0.720.
Conclusion: The data is consistent with weak selection on preferred codons in all five species.
There is also evidence suggesting that selection on synonymous codons has increased in P. tremula.
Although the reasons for the increase in selection on codon usage in the P. tremula lineage are not
clear, one possible explanation is an increase in the effective population size in P. tremula.

Background
Codon bias, the preferential use of subset of synonymous
codons, has been documented in a wide variety of organisms, from prokaryotes, to unicellular and multicellular
eukaryotes [1-3]. While codon bias appears to be almost
universal, the magnitude of codon bias largely depends
on the effective population size, with codon bias being
higher in species with larger effective population sizes [4].
Evolution of synonymous codon usage is a process where
natural selection is sufficiently weak (Ns ~ 1) that the outcome is influenced by both selection, mutation and
genetic drift [1,2]. At the same time, synonymous changes
within and between species are sufficiently common that

abundant data is available for testing evolutionary
hypotheses of synonymous codon usage, explaining why
much attention has been directed to understanding the
relative contributions of mutation, genetic drift and natural selection to the patterns of codon bias seen within and
between species.
The most common model of synonymous codon usage,
the "major codon preference model", assumes that one or
a few synonymous codons are preferentially used in genes
with high codon bias [3,5]. Such codons are usually
termed "preferred codons" and often end in either C of G.
In most cases preferred codons correspond to the most

abundant tRNAs from each codon family and codon bias
is therefore thought to have arisen in response to natural
selection favoring transcriptional accuracy or efficiency
[3]. Under the assumption of a balance between weak
selection and genetic drift, the expected proportion of
sites fixed for the preferred codon is

E[Fop ] =

1
1+(μ /ν )e −4 Ns

(1)

where μ and ν are the mutation rates from and to preferred codons, respectively, and 4N s is the scaled selection coefficient acting on preferred codons [6,7]. Equation
(1) suggest that changes in evolutionary parameters, such
as population size or mutation rate, can have large effects
on the evolution of synonymous codon usage even in
closely related species. While major shifts in codon preferences are unlikely between closely related species, changes
in evolutionary parameters, particular in effective population sizes, are relatively common even over short evolutionary time scales [5]. Population size changes are
expected to affect codon usage across all synonymous
codon families and results in enhanced codon bias following a population size increase and an erosion of codon
bias after a population size decline [5]. For instance, several studies have documented reductions in codon bias in
Drosophila melanogaster and an increased fixation rate of
unpreferred codons compared to the closely related species D. simulans and this has been attributed to a reduction
in the effective population size of D. melanogaster and a
relaxation of selection on codon bias [8-10]. Reductions
in codon bias, likely driven by reductions in effective population sizes, have also been documented in D. miranda
[11] and several species from the D. virils group [12]. Mating system is another potential factor affecting effective
population sizes. For instance, self-fertilization is associated with a reduction in the effective population size [13]
and Caenorhabditis species which have experienced a transition from obligately outcrossing to selfing show a concomitant decrease in codon bias [14].
I have recently shown that patterns of synonymous codon
usage in the long-lived tree Populus tremula is consistent
with weak natural selection acting on translational efficiency as evidenced by a strong positive correlation
between gene expression and codon bias [15]. In this
paper I extend my earlier studies of codon bias in P. tremula to five species covering most of the phylogenetic diversity found within the genus Populus. Using a greatly
expanded set of genes and species allows for more thorough studies of the molecular evolution of synonymous
codon usage across lineages with the hope of answering
questions pertaining to the stability of evolutionary
parameters, such as mutation rates, population sizes and
patterns of natural selection.

Results
Identification of optimal codons
Optimal codons were identified for all five species based
on differences in relative synonymous codon usage
(ΔRSCU) between genes with high and low levels of gene
expression (Figure 1). Using this approach I identified 24
codons showing significant ΔRSCU values between low
and high expression genes in four or more species. An
additional four codons showed ΔRSCU values that were
significant in three or few species. Some of the codons that
do not show significant differences between high and low
expression genes in all species nevertheless have positive
ΔRSCU values in all species (e.g. AAC, AAG and GGU).
These are likely optimal codons (as evidenced by their
positive ΔRSCU values) but where power might be too
low to achieve statistical significance in one or a few species. On the other hand, some codons show reversal of
ΔRSCU between high and low expression genes across
species (e.g. CUG or UCU). Whether these codons truly
represent differences in codon preferences between species or simply represent statistical artifacts is not clear.
Based on the results from the ΔRSCU analysis, I identified
25 codons from 18 different amino acids that were used
to calculate the frequency of optimal codon usage in all
genes of the different species (Figure 1). Most, but not all,
of these codons end with either a C or a G, as have been
observed in many other species [2].

In a recent study I estimated optimal codons in P. tremula
based on correspondence analysis of codon usage in 558
different genes using the program codonw [15]. The
results presented here are both based on more species
(five vs. one) and substantially more genes from each species (> 4500 genes per species). Nevertheless there is a
large degree of overlap between optimal codons I identified in P. tremula [15] and those identified in this study. In
fact, the 11 codons identified as optimal in P. tremula [15]
represents a subset of the 25 codons identified in this
study. The greater number of optimal codons identified
here is likely the result of a greater power to identify subtle
differences in codon usage between high and low expression genes due to the substantially larger data set used in
this study.
Factors explaining variation in synonymous codon usage
There is a significant positive correlation between gene
expression, measured as the number of hits from the EST
data, and codon bias, measured as the frequency of optimal codon usage (Table 1). These correlations are independent of base composition and sequence lengths and
are consistent with natural selection on translational accuracy and/or efficiency having shaped codon usage. There
are large differences among species in the amount of variation in codon usage explained by gene expression, rang-

Difference in relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) across codons between genes with high and low gene expression
Difference in relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) across codons between genes with high and low gene
expression. Codons are sorted after average ΔRSCU. The right-most column indicate codons with significantly increased
usage in high-expression genes as determined by a t-test. Each * denotes a species for which the t-test was significant, in the
same order as they are listed in the Figure. Codons above the horizontal dotted lines were used to designed optimal codons
and were used to calculate frequencies of optimal codon usage (Fop) in all species. The colors in the figure indicate the gradient
of ΔRSCU values, from the most positive(orange) to the most negative (green).

ing from 2.6% in P. trichocarpa to 16.9% in P. deltoides
(Figure 2). The base composition of sequences also
explain a sizable fraction of the variation in codon usage,
ranging from 17.2% in P. deltoides to 28.5% in P. euphratica. Interestingly, gene length appears to have little effect
on codon usage and so do interactions between gene
expression, base composition and gene length (Figure 2).
These results differ to some degree from those I obtained
in my earlier study of codon usage in P. tremula [15]. The
main difference is that base composition explain a large
fraction of the variation in codon usage in the current data
set whereas the effect of gene length is weak and non-significant. The main conclusion remains the same, however, namely that codon usage in all species is, to a large
degree, shaped by translational selection. As an overall
index of codon usage bias I calculated the average of all
positive ΔRSCU values ( ΔRSCU + ) [16]. There is a strong
correspondence between

ΔRSCU +

values and the

strength of the association between gene expression and
codon usage across species (Table 1).
Phylogeny of the five species
Putative one-to-one orthologous genes were identified
from the five different species using the program
orthoMCL [17]. This search identified a total of 158
orthologous groups that had all five species represented.
The average length of the aligned regions was 576 bp and
the concatenated data set contained a total of 71361 bps
of coding sequences per species. The concatenated data set
was used to estimate the phylogeny of the five species and
the phylogenetic tree obtained is depicted in Figure 3. The
support for the tree topology in Figure 3 is strong, with
100% bootstrap support for all branches when using the
concatenated data. This tree is also consistent across different substitution models and tree inference methods
(NJ, ML or parsimony), all of which yielded the same tree
(data not shown). The tree in Figure 3 is also consistent
with earlier phylogenetic studies of the genus Populus and
the Salicaceae family using both morphological data [18]
or cpDNA and ITS data [19,20]. However, because of the
low sequence divergence among the species and the sto-

chastic nature of the coalescent, there are possibilities that
trees estimated for individual genes are not congruent. To
test this, I estimated the likelihood for a number of variants on the trees depicted in Figure 3 for each of the 158
genes separately. The tree in Figure 3 was found to be the
most likely tree for approximately 57% of the genes, but
several other trees were recovered for between 10 and 15%
of the genes. Similar results were recently obtained for a
number of species of Drosophila, where trees showing
incongruent phylogenies were found to be clustered
across the genome, leading Pollard et al. [21] to suggest
incomplete lineage sorting as the likely cause for these
observations. It is not known to what degree the genes
having incongruent trees are clustered in the genome, but
the results suggest that incomplete lineage sorting could
be quite common in Populus. This is not surprising, since
the radiation of the genus Populus appear to be relatively
recent, within the last 5 Myr [18]. Since the generation
time in Populus is quite long (> 15 yr), the time since the
radiation of the genus, in generations, is rather low.
Substitution rates at synonymous and non-synonymous
sites
Initially I tested for rate heterogeneity among lineages
using only synonymous sites by contrasting a model
assuming a single molecular clock for the entire phylogeny with a model assuming no clock. These analyses show
overwhelming support for a model without a clock, (2ΔL
= 475.7, df = 4, p < 0.001), suggesting that the molecular
clock hypothesis of a constant substitution rate across the
genus Populus can be rejected. I then used relative rate tests
[22] to compare substitution rates as synonymous sites
between pairs of lineages. These tests show significant rate
heterogeneities between P. deltoides and P. trichocarpa (X2
= 4.40, p = 0.036) and between the P. nigra and the P.
tremula-P. euphratica lineages (X2 = 103.6, p < 0.001). To
test for lineage specific effects on synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates I contrasted a model with
a single dN/dS ratio (one-ratio model) with a model allowing for different dN/dS values across branches of the phylogenetic tree (free-ratio model). In general, the loglikelihood values were greater for the free-ratio model
than for the one-ratio model and in six of the 158 genes
this difference is statistically significant at p < 0.05, suggesting significant heterogeneity in selective constraint at
these genes. However, none of the genes remain significant after multiple test correction is applied. There was,
however, evidence for significant heterogeneity in selective constraint in the concatenated data set (2ΔL = 13.84,
df = 7, p = 0.019). The median dN/dS ratio was lowest in P.
trichocarpa (0.132) and highest in P. nigra (0.232) (see
also Figure 3 for dN/dS ratios estimated from the concatenated data set). The internal branches leading to the P.
tremula-P. euphratica lineages and the P. tremula-P. euphratica-P. nigra lineages have substantially greater dN/dS ratios

(0.316 and 0.349, respectively). However, these branches
are very short and dN/dS ratios are subject to a large degree
of uncertainty. Nevertheless, all dN/dS ratios are substantially lower than one, suggesting strong purifying selection across all genes.
I also used likelihood ratio tests to test for the presence of
heterogeneous selection pressures among sites within
individual genes. The null model (M0 [23]), assumes a

single dN/dS ratio across sites which is calculated from the
data. This model is contrasted with two alternative models; M1a [24], which assumes two classes of sites, one class
which is neutral dN/dS = 1 and one class where 0 <dN/dS <
1, and model M2a that in addition to the two classes
defined for model M1a allows for a third class of sites with
dN/dS > 1 [24]. A total of 14 genes show evidence for heterogeneous selection pressures across codons as evidenced by likelihood ratio tests that were significant at a

nominal p-value of 0.05. Again none of these tests are significant after multiple test correction. However, this test is
known to have low power to detect the action of positive
selection when few, relatively closely related sequences
are compared in each test, so the results should be interpreted with caution [24]. The concatenated data set provides a more robust test of heterogeneous selection
pressures across sites. Here model M1a provides a substantially greater fit to the data, compared to model M0
(2ΔL = 422, p < 0.001). Furthermore, model M2a is significantly better than model M1a (2ΔL = 40.9, p < 0.001),
conclusively demonstrating that there is heterogeneity in
selection pressures among sites. Under model M2a, the
majority of sites (78.3%) are under strong purifying selection (dN/dS ≈ 0) and another large class of sites are evolving neutrally (20.2% of sites with dN/dS = 1). Finally, a
small fraction of sites (1.4%) appear to be evolving under
the action of relatively strong positive selection (dN/dS =
4.2). These sites appear to occur randomly across the
genes, with no apparent clustering.

U → P mutations shows as slight, but significant excess
across the entire phylogeny, suggesting that codon usage
has not reached an equilibrium in Populus. The excess of U
→ P mutations can, however, largely be explained by the
excess of U → P substitutions in the P. tremula and the P.
deltoides lineages (Table 2). Both of these lineages do show
a consistent excess of U → P mutations across loci (p =
0.013 and p < 0.001 for P. deltoides and P. tremula, respectively). The remaining lineages appear to have reached a
stationary distribution of codon usage and show no significant deviation from an equal number of P → U and U
→ P mutations. Taken together, the changes observed in
the P. tremula and P. deltoides lineages suggest that selection on synonymous codon usage codon bias has
increased in these two lineages. The degree of codon bias,
measured using Fop, is higher in P. tremula that in both the

Changes in codon usage
Ancestral and derived codons were identified across a
total of 23787 codons from 158 genes using maximum
likelihood methods. A total of 2037 synonymous and
1461 non-synonymous changes were recorded across all
lineages (Table 2). The low levels of sequence divergence
ensured that ancestral codons could be identified with
high degree of certainty and in all cases did the most likely
ancestral codon have a probability that exceeded 95%.
The estimated number of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in each lineage of the phylogeny are summarized in Table 2. Following Akashi et al. [9],
synonymous substitutions were further classified into
changes that occurred from preferred to unpreferred
codons (P → U) or from unpreferred to preferred codons
(U → P) and deviations from equilibrium codon usage
was scored as dUP-PU = (UP - PU)/(UP + PU) [9]. Preferred

most closely related species (P. euphratica) or in the
inferred ancestor, consistent with the observed increase in
selection on codon usage. Although these differences are
small (mean Δ Fop = 0.0072 and 0.0065 across loci, respectively) they are consistent and highly significant across
loci (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test p < 0.001 in both cases).
Comparisons of Fop for P. deltoides with either P. trichocarpa or their most recent common ancestor are not
significant however.
There is also a significant negative correlation between
dUP-PU and Fop across loci over the entire phylogeny (ρ = 0.234, p = 0.003), as would be expected if selection is
shaping synonymous codon usage [12]. I did not detect
any correlations between dS and codon bias within any of
the lineages. Although codon bias is expected to be nega-

tively correlated to dS when selection on codon bias is
strong, theory shows that weak selection (N s < 1) actually
has little effect on synonymous substitution rates [25].
Estimating selection on synonymous codons
The full model of Nielsen et al. [10] allows for estimation
of independent mutation rates, dN/dS ratios and selection
coefficients at synonymous sites in all lineages (Table 3,
Figure 3). With 5 species there are 5 × 2 - 2 = 8 branches
to estimate these parameters for. The full model outperforms both models assuming strand symmetry, i.e. where
mutation rates from nucleotide i to j is equal the mutation
rates from j to i or models assuming the same mutation
rate matrix in all lineages (Table 3). I calculated the
expected equilibrium GC content (πGC) from the stationary distribution of nucleotide frequencies obtained from
the first normalized eigenvector of the mutation matrix
estimated from the data. In all species, except P. trichocarpa, the predicted πGC is substantially larger than the
observed values (range of predicted πGC: 51.4-62.8%,
range of observed πGC: 46.3-46.6%). For P. trichocarpa the
predicted πGC = 46.7% vs. observed πGC = 46.3%. However, small lineage-specific differences in the estimated
mutation rates can translate in to substantial differences
in the expected πGC for these lineages, so these differences
should be interpreted with caution. When the complete
data set is used to estimate a single mutation matrix the
expected πGC is substantially closer to the observed values
(expected πGC = 43.0%, observed πGC = 46.3%).

The concatenated data, including data from all 158 genes,
show significant evidence for weak, but positive selection
on synonymous sites only in the P. tremula lineage, with
the estimated 4Nes = 0.720 (Table 3, Figure 3). The selection coefficient in P. deltoides is also marginally significant
(p = 0.083, Table 3), but with selection only about half as
strong as in P. tremula (4Nes = 0.330).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/307

The gene-specific analyses identify a total of 21 genes that
show significant evidence for selection on synonymous
codon usage in P. tremula at a false discovery rate [26] of
5%. For genes with evidence for significant selection in P.
tremula, 16 have estimates of S > 0 and 5 have S < 0. This
suggests that although selection on synonymous codon
usage favors preferred codons in the majority of cases,
there are genes for which there is active selection against
preferred codons. This mirror results from Drosophila,
where the majority of genes show evidence for selection
favoring preferred codons but where a few genes show significantly negative estimates of 4Nes [27].
Changes in base composition across lineages
Although the changes in codon usage observed in the P.
tremula lineage are consistent with an increase in the
strength of natural selection acting on codon usage, an
alternative explanation is a change in base composition
driven by changes in mutational biases. One way to test
this assumption is to compare mutational changes from
A/T to G/C and vice versa across the phylogeny and in the
individual lineages. Since preferred synonymous codons
predominantly end with G/C (Figure 1), synonymous
sites cannot be used for such comparisons as it would be
difficult to disentangle mutational biases from natural
selection on codon usage. Ideally, non-coding regions in
the vicinity of each gene could be used for such a comparison, since this would account for chromosome-wide differences in base composition. However, since the
sequences used for the current analyses are derived from
EST projects, non-coding sequences are not available. I
have therefore used non-synonymous mutations to infer
mutational changes in different lineages.

Following Akashi et al. [9], I classified mutations as S →
W (strong [G/C] to weak [A/T], following the standard
DNA ambiguity code) or W → S (weak to strong) across
lineages and deviations from equilibrium base composition were quantified as dWS-SW = (WS - SW)/(WS + SW).

The data show that there are no significant departures
from an equilibrium base composition, either across the
entire phylogeny or within any of the individual lineages
(Table 2). There is also no correlation between dUP-PU and
dWS-SW across loci (ρ = 0.112, p = 0.16) or between dWS-SW
and Fop (ρ = -0.013, p = 0.86).

Discussion
Selection on synonymous codon usage appears to be
common among higher eukaryotes [2,3] but the efficacy
of such selection is usually thought to be lower in species
with lower effective population sizes [4]. Nevertheless,
even long-lived species like Populus show ample evidence
for selection having shaped synonymous codon usage.
Optimal codons appear to be largely the same across the
five species used in this analysis, and most of the differences between species can be explained by codons with
low ΔRSCU values, where the statistical power to detect
changes in codon usage between low and high expression
genes may be low. Also, the ΔRSCU analyses are based on
publicly available EST-collections and the sets of genes
used for the different species are likely very different
thereby contributing to the slightly different sets of optimal codons identified in the different species (Figure 1).
The codons identified as optimal in this study also correspond well with optimal codons identified in an earlier
study of codon bias in P. tremula where optimal codons
were identified using substantially less data and slightly
different methods [15]. The 11 codons identified as optimal in P. tremula [15] actually form a subset of 25 optimal
codons identified in the ΔRSCU analyses. The estimates of

ΔRSCU + for the different species, which provides rough
estimates of the overall strength of selection for preferred
codons in the different species, is similar to what has been
previously observed in Arabidopsis, but is lower than
observations from either Drosophila or Caenorhabditis
[14,28]. I have used EST data as a proxy for gene expression in this study and this is known to be associated with
a lot of problems, like relatively shallow and biased
library coverage [29]. However studies that have estimated codon bias parameters using expression profiles
from either EST data or other methods, such as MPSS or
microarrays, have yielded similar results despite the
uncertainties associated with the EST data [28,30,31].
Codon usage bias can in principle be driven by natural
selection or by mutational pressure and/or gene conversion [2,7]. Although both of these forces are likely operating, there are unequivocal signs of natural selection
having shaped codon usage biases in Populus. There are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/307

strong positive correlations between gene expression and
the degree of codon bias across individual genes in all five
species (Table 1). The gene expression-codon bias correlations are independent of base composition differences
(Figure 2), indicating that natural selection, operating
through translational efficiency or accuracy, has been a
significant force shaping synonymous codon usage in Populus. The lack of association between dS and codon bias
suggest that selection on synonymous codon usage is
strong enough to influence rates of synonymous divergence among species. A significant correlation with dS is
only expected when natural selection on codon usage is
strong. When selection on codon bias is weak, theory
shows that it has only small effects on the rate of synonymous substitutions even if the effects on codon usage can
be significant [25].
Interestingly, gene length appears to have virtually no
effect on codon bias, except in P. trichocarpa (Figure 2).
Earlier studies in P. tremula have suggested a weak, but significantly negative effect of gene length on codon bias
[15] and negative correlations have been found in other
eukaryotes as well [28]. Several reasons can explain the
lack of a correlation between gene length and codon bias
in the present study. First, there might be genuine differences between species in the effect of gene length. Cutter
et al. [14] found that for some species of Caenorhabitis
gene length had a significant effect on codon bias whereas
for other species no such effect were found, suggesting
that the effects of gene length might differ even between
closely related species. Alternatively, different sets of genes
were used for the different species and it is conceivable
that this could explain why an effect of gene length is lacking in some species. However, the number of genes used
is quite large for all species (Table 1), so if gene length has
an effect the sample sizes are likely large enough that it
would be detected. Finally, gene lengths were taken from
the annotated genome of P. trichocarpa but were assumed
to be representative of the corresponding gene from the
remaining species. It is possible, although perhaps
unlikely, that gene lengths differ substantially between
species. Nevertheless, the effects of gene length on codon
bias clearly deserves further attention.
At first impression, codon usage does not appear to have
reached an equilibrium in Populus as there was an excess
of U → P substitutions across the entire phylogeny (Table
2). However, the excess of U → P substitutions could
largely be explained by significant excesses in two different lineages, P. deltoides and P. tremula, with the remaining
lineages showing no deviations from an equal numbers of
P → U and U → P substitutions(Table 2). In addition, the
maximum-likelihood estimates of the selection coeffiPage 9 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:307

cient acting on synonymous codons are positive in both
of these lineages (4Nes = 0.330 in P. deltoides and 4Nes =
0.720 in P. tremula).
The 4Ne estimate for P. tremula is significantly greater than
zero whereas the estimate for P. deltoides is approaching
significance (Table 3). The estimate of selection in P. tremula (S = 0.720) is only slightly lower than estimates of
selection from Drosophila simulans and D. yakuba [10], two
species for which there are abundant evidence for selection on synonymous codon usage [9,10]. In addition, P.
tremula has also significantly higher Fop than both the
most closely related species (P. euphratica) or their common ancestor, supporting an increase in the degree of
codon bias as a result of ongoing selection for preferred
codons in P. tremula.
For the remaining lineages of the phylogeny the maximum-likelihood estimates of 4Nes are either close to zero
or even negative, although none of these estimates are significantly different from zero (Table 3). These results suggest that the strength of selection acting on codon usage
has increased independently in two different lineages in
the genus Populus, with natural selection favoring preferred codons in P. tremula and P. deltoides. Despite lacking evidence for selection on preferred codons, the
remaining species show signs of past selection on codon
usage as evidenced by the positive association between
gene expression and codon bias discussed above. Finally
there is no evidence for changes in base composition
across lineages (Table 3), although these conclusions are
based on changes at non-synonymous sites. There are significant differences in the GC content of coding regions
and surrounding non-coding regions in P. tremula [15]
but also no apparent correlation between GC contents of
coding and non-coding regions, suggesting that non-synonymous sites might provide an accurate picture of the
patterns of mutations in coding regions in Populus.
What accounts for the increase in the strength of selection
acting on synonymous codons in P. tremula (and in P. deltoides)? One thing that distinguish P. tremula from many
other species of Populus is its very wide distribution, ranging throughout Eurasia, from Western Europe to Eastern
Asia. Therefore based only on the distribution range, P.
tremula likely has a substantially greater effective population size than other species of Populus, that in many cases
have both geographically more restricted ranges and more
fragmented distributions where they do occur [18]. It is
interesting to note that P. deltoides also have a relatively
wide distribution range [18], suggesting that the Ne could
be relative large also in P. deltoides. Sequence-based estimates of the effective population size of P. tremula suggest
that Ne is at least 105 [32]. This estimate of Ne is heavily
dependent on the genome-wide mutation rate in Populus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/307

and this has not been characterized in great detail [33].
However, estimates of Ne are lacking for other species of
Populus, and the conclusions regarding the relative population sizes of the different species are clearly tentative.
In other species, population size in known to have a large
effect on the strength of selection acting on preferred
codons. As mentioned above, the effective population size
appears to have been reduced in D. melanogaster and this
have resulted in reduced selection on synonymous
codons at least when compared to the closely related species D. simulans [8-10]. A similar picture is emerging from
data on synonymous codon usage in nematodes where
species that have evolved self-fertilization and/or have a
parasitic life-style have experienced a reduction in Ne
which translates into lower selection on codon bias
[14,16]. These results suggest that changes in effective
population size are perhaps the most important parameter explaining differences in codon bias between closely
related species. Interestingly, selection on codon usage
does not differ dramatically between Arabidopsis thaliana
and A. lyrata, despite the the former bing highly selfing
and the latter obligately out-crossing. This mirrors data on
rates of protein evolution which also does not differ
between the two species and which suggest that the effective population sizes are not dramatically between A. thaliana and A. lyrata [34].

Conclusion
This study conclusively demonstrates that natural selection on synonymous codon usage is occurring also in a
long-lived, perennial plant species like Populus. Data on
synonymous codon usage suggest both ancient selection
on synonymous codon usage in the genus Populus and
current selection in P. tremula. The data also show that
there has been a shift in the strength of selection acting on
preferred codons in the P. tremula lineage and possibly
also in P. deltoides. The analyses of the present data make
shifts in mutations rates among species unlikely, suggesting that increases in the effective population size in these
lineages can explain the observed increase in selection on
synonymous mutations.

Methods
EST analysis
I downloaded all available ESTs for five different species
of Populus, P. deltoides (14661 ESTs), P. euphratica
(13905), P. nigra (51361), P. tremula (37313) and P. trichocarpa (89943) from PlantGDB [35]. I also downloaded
the corresponding PlantGDB-assembled Unique Transcripts (PUT) for P. deltoides, P. euphratica, P. nigra and P.
tremula. These PUTs are unique transcripts assembled
from all mRNA sequences for a given species available in
public databases and have been trimmed to remove bacterial contamination, repetitive sequences and polyA tails.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:307

For the remainder of this paper I will refer to these PUTs
as genes, recognizing that these PUTs do, for the most
part, not correspond to full-length transcripts. I also
downloaded all predicted gene models for P. trichocarpa
from the publicly available genome sequence at http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html.
Reading frames of all genes were checked, and corrected,
for sequencing errors using FrameD [36]. Pairwise comparisons were then performed between all genes within
species using BLASTN and redundant sequences as well as
sequences from gene families with very similar paralogous
copies (> 85% sequence similarity) were removed.
Finally, sequences shorter than 300 bps were also
excluded. The final numbers of unique genes per species
are listed in Table 1.
Expression profiles for all genes were obtained by allagainst-all BLASTN searches of genes and the complete
EST data for each species separately. Gene-EST alignments
were required to show at least a 90% identity across 100
bp to be recorded as a match and the number of BLASTN
hits were used as a proxy for expression levels. I partitioned the gene expression data for each species into two
classes, genes with a single EST hit and genes which had
EST hit numbers that were equal or greater than the species specific 90th percentile [14,28]. I then calculated relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for all genes in
each species and expression category separately using the
codonw (version 1.4.2 http://codonw.sourceforge.net/). I
then identified codons which are over-represented in
highly expressed genes by comparing differences in
ΔRSCU between high and low expression genes (ΔRSCU)
using t-tests using R [37]. Codons showing significantly
higher levels of ΔRSCU in high expression genes were
taken as optimal codons for the species in question.
Finally, following Cutter et al. [14], overall indices of
codon usage for each of the five different species were calculated as the average of all positive ΔRSCU values,

ΔRSCU + (Table 1).
Optimal codons identified from the ΔRSCU analyses were
used to calculate the frequency of optimal codons (Fop)
[38] and the GC content of the coding region using
codonw http://codonw.sourceforge.net. Each gene was
also associated with the most likely orthologous gene
from the P. trichocarpa genome sequence using BLAST. The
lengths of the corresponding full-length sequences from
P. trichocarpa were used in combination with gene expression (EST hit count) and base composition (GC content)
to estimate the amount of variation in Fop that the variables and their first order interactions explain [14]. As
pointed out by Cutter et al. [14], a significant positive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/307

effect of gene expression is consistent with selection having shaped optimal codon usage.
Identification of orthologous genes and calculations of
substitution rates
Putative one-to-one orthologous genes were identified
from the five different species using the program
orthoMCL, using default parameters [17]. Groups of putatively orthologous sequences were aligned using ClustalW
[39]. All identified genes were also concatenated within
species and used to construct the most likely phylogenetic
tree using baseml from the PAML package. The baseml
analyses used the HKY85 substitution model with rate
variation among sites and with the transition:transversion
ratio estimated from the data (HKY85+Γ). The resulting
tree was rooted based on results from phylogenetic analyses of the entire genus Populus [20].

Synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions for each
gene and each lineage of the phylogeny were calculated
using the codeml program from PAML [40] based on the
phylogenetic tree obtained from the concatenated data
set. The model assumed different dN/dS ratios for all
branches in the phylogeny (i.e model = 1) and with codon
frequencies calculated average nucleotide frequencies at
the three codon positions (F3x4).
To test for evidence of heterogeneous selection acting on
codons, codeml from PAML was used to fit a null model
with a single dN/dS ration (model M0 [23]) and two models that allow the dN/dS ratio to vary between codons
(models M1a and M2a [24]). A gene was assumed to be
under positive selection if a likelihood ratio test, comparing models M1a and M2a, was significant at p < 0.05. As
dS did not show any association with codon bias it was not
necessary to correct dS for possible effects of selection at
synonymous sites [41].
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
Ancestral sequences at internal nodes of the phylogeny
were reconstructed using baseml from the PAML package
[40]. baseml use a defined substitution model and a phylogenetic tree to estimate branch lengths and to assign
posterior probabilities to different ancestral nucleotides at
internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. The ancestral
reconstruction also used the HKY85+Γ nucleotide substitution model. Probabilities of ancestral codons were calculated as the product of probabilities of ancestral
nucleotides at the three different nucleotide positions [9].

For codons that differ at more than a single nucleotide
position, there are multiple alternative paths between
ancestral and derived codons. I used the method of Akashi
et al. [9] which weight different paths equally. With low

method give results similar to methods that weight paths
by the number of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions [9]. However this method has a much lower
computational demand. Following Akashi et al. [9] multiple hits were ignored, again motivated by the low levels of
sequence divergence in the data set (dS < 5 – 7%). Once
the ancestral sequences of the internal nodes of the tree
had been obtained, lineage-specific synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions were calculated. In addition, synonymous substitutions were classified according
to the putative fitness effects of the ancestral and derived
codons. Codon preferences for all species were assumed
to follow the preference table established from the ΔRSCU
analyses described above. Mutations between codon preference classes were classified as unpreferred to preferred
(P → U) or preferred to unpreferred (P → U) depending
on the state of the ancestral and derived codons. Mutations within codon classes (U → U and P → P) were also
scored.
If codon usage is at equilibrium, an equal number of U →
P and P → U mutations are expected. To test this assumption I applied a goodness-of-fit test to the number of P →
U and U → P mutation in each lineage of the phylogeny.
Estimating selection at synonymous sites
To estimate the strength of selection acting on alternative
codons in different lineages of the Populus phylogeny I
used the method of Nielsen et al. [10]. Briefly, the method
of Nielsen et al. [10] extends codon-based likelihood
methods [42] with a parameter that allow for selection on
synonymous codon usage. The method estimate the
scaled coefficient of selection (S = 4Nes) acting on mutations from unpreferred to preferred codons, with S > 0
indicating selection favoring the preferred state and S < 0
indicating selection against the preferred state. In addition
to estimating S, the method also provides lineage specific
estimates of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
substitution rates (ω = dN/dS) and parameters of the mutation matrix [10]. The input tree and branch lengths were
taken from the PAML analyses described above.

rately fit two models. The first model has S as a free
parameter and therefore allows for lineage specific estimation of S. The alternative model constrains S to zero on a
specific lineage of interest and therefore assumes that synonymous sites are neutral along that lineage. The two
models are nested and can be compared using a likelihood ratio test, where twice the difference in the likelihood of the two models (ΔlogL = log(L2) - log(L1)) is
assumed to follow a χ2-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in number of parameters
between the two models (np(2) - np(1)).

Mutation rates were initially estimated using a data set
consisting of concatenated sequences from all loci. Technically it is difficult to accurately estimate the mutation
rate parameters on either of the lineages surrounding the
root, because the placement of the root in the tree not
uniquely determined in the data set. Mutation rate estimates for these lineages are therefore only approximate.
Mutation rates estimated from the concatenated sequence
data were then used in gene-specific analyses to reduce
computational time.
