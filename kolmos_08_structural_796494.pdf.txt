Abstract
Background: The plant circadian clock has at its core a feedback loop that includes TIMING OF
CAB2 EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). This protein has an as of yet unknown biochemical activity. It has
been noted that the extreme amino-terminus of this protein is distantly related in sequence to
response regulators (RR), and thus TOC1 is a member of the so-called pseudo response regulator
(PRR) family. As well, the extreme carboxy-terminus has a small sequence stretch related to the
other PRRs and CONSTANS (CO)-like proteins, and this peptide stretch has been termed the
CCT (for CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1) domain.
Methods: To extend further our understanding of the TOC1 protein, we performed a ROSETTA
structural prediction on TOC1 orthologues from four plant species. Phylogenetic interpretations
assisted in model construction.
Results: From our models, we suggest that TOC1 is a three-domain protein: TOC1 has an aminoterminal signaling-domain related to response receivers, a carboxy-terminal domain that could
participate both in metal binding and in transcriptional regulation, and a linker domain that connects
the two.
Conclusion: The models we present should prove useful in future hypothesis-driven biochemical
analyses to test the predictions that TOC1 is a multi-domain signaling component of the plant
circadian clock.

Background
Circadian clocks are prevalent timing mechanisms used to
predict the daily changes present in the 24-h day-night
cycle. In plants, this clock regulates several developmental
and metabolic processes. Dominant outputs include the
oscillation of free-cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) [1], which are
generated from cADPR-derived signals [2], and the rhythmic accumulation of around 10% of all transcripts [2-6].

In particular, transcription factors are over-represented as
cycling gene products [3,7]. In this way, the circadian
timer drives numerous molecular outputs in the establishment of fitness in physiological processes and developmental timing. This fitness benefit has been confirmed
[8]. The current aims on studies of the mechanism of the
plant clock are to define the factors that contribute to
rhythm-generating properties of the oscillator.

Molecular-genetic analyses have lead to a framework
understanding of the core elements that make up the circadian clock. Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that are clock
defective have been used to identify loci critical for normal rhythmicity. TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION 1
(TOC1) was the first such locus identified [9], and TOC1
continues to be placed central within the clock mechanism [10-14]. Extending from these studies, many clock
genes are reciprocally regulated, and thus the transcriptional components that drive the clock are themselves
clock controlled. Using this analytical approach, with a
focus on molecular-expression analyses in clock mutants,
the first model that partially explained mutant behavior
was described [15]. In this model, TOC1 serves as an
evening-expressed positive factor that regulates the morning expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1
(CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) [1518]. The central role of TOC1 has been genetically confirmed [10,11], but although TOC1 is unquestionably
important for the circadian clock, lack of functional biochemical understanding has hampered characterization
of its functional role within the oscillator.
Multiple regions of the TOC1 coding region are susceptible to mutagenesis. Weak mutations, such as the toc1-1
and toc1-3 alleles (both A562V changes within the carboxy-terminal portion) result in clock-specific defects. As
well, missense mutations in the amino terminus of TOC1
have been isolated from direct circadian screens [toc1-5
(P124S); toc1-8 (P96L)] [19,20]. In contrast, null mutants,
such as toc1-2 (splice site mutation that leads to N-terminal 1–59 aa fragment) and toc1-21 (a null allele derived
from a T-DNA insertion), have defects both in circadian
properties and in light signaling [10,21,22]. Thus, TOC1
can have multiple physiological roles that can be genetically separated.
To date, the only defined activity within any region of the
TOC1 polypeptide is a nuclear-trafficking signal established by the CCT motif (for CONSTANS, CONSTANSLIKE, TOC1) in the carboxy-terminus [22,23]. It has been
previously noted that the amino-terminal domain resembles in its primary structure sequence conservation with
bacterial-type response regulators (RR) [23]. This domain
in TOC1 thus places it as a founding member of the
pseudo-response-regulator (PRR) protein family. The
function of the pseudo-receiver domain is unknown,
because results of in vitro experiments confirm that the
PRR domain does not undergo phosphorylation, as suspected, due to a lack of a conserved Asp within the
response-receiver [23]. One collective interpretation proposed here, which incorporates these diverse experiments,
is that TOC1 is a multi-domain protein. TOC1 thus integrates signal inputs that bridge multiple physiological
responses [24]. That weak mutations can be uncovered

which only display a subset of phenotypes [15,22] support our hypothesis of multiple signaling functions of
TOC1.
Diurnal calcium (Ca2+) rhythms are evident in the plant
cell. The daily rise and fall of free-cytosolic calcium has
been proposed to encode a photoperiodic signal [25-27].
The signaling nature of the encoded rhythmic Ca2+ is an
active area of investigation [25,27,28], and the receptor
for this Ca2+-derived signal is as of yet unknown. One
point of note is that the phase of calcium increase is coincident with that seen with TOC1 protein levels, as both
occur around dusk [26,29]. Therefore, it would be of
interest to define whether evening factors such as TOC1
comprise part of a decoding mechanism of the Ca2+ signal.
In this work we used modeling and phylogenetic
approaches to further dissect the TOC1 protein sequence.
Several TOC1 polypeptides were detected in sequence
databases. These TOC1 proteins appear to contain three
distinct modules. Computational approaches using the
ROSETTA suite of programs lead to the development of
structural models of the TOC1 modules. One interpretation of these structures is the implication that TOC1 functions as a signaling protein that in part works to process
calcium information in the induction of transcriptional
responses.

Methods
Defining TOC1 orthologous sequences
To assess putative structures of TOC1, as it relates to differences with the PRR related sequences, we searched public sequence databases for genes that encode full-length
proteins. The following Genbank accessions were used:
AtTOC1 (NM_125531), AtPRR3 (NM_125403), AtPRR5
AtPRR7
(NM_120359),
AtPRR9
(NM_122355),
OsTOC1
(AB189038),
OsPRR37
(NM_201974),
OsPRR73
(AB189040),
OsPRR95
(AB189039),
(AB189041),
OsPRR59
(ABA91559),
CsTOC1
LjTOC1
(AP004931),
McTOC1
(AY611028),
(AY371288), PtTOC1 (NW_001492741), and VvTOC1
(CAO64513)

For phylogenetic confirmation of TOC1 sequence identification, polypeptides where clustered using CLUSTALW
[30], and this was used to generate a tree using UPGMA,
where CLC FREE WORKBENCH (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) facilitated these efforts.
Modeling and model comparisons
The ROSETTA software suite was generously supplied by
the Baker Laboratory (University of Washington, Seattle,
USA) and it was used to model the three modules of four
selected TOC1 polypeptides; each were modeled 500
times. These models were clustered, and up to 10 consen-

length sequences were chosen as they were reported to
exhibit the architecture typical to TOC1, as was defined
previously by the Mizuno group [35]. Out-group
sequences were the paralogues of the PRR family, which
are PRR3/5/7/9 from Arabidopsis, and from rice (Oryza
sativa), OsPRR37 and OsPRR73, OsPRR59 and OsPRR95
(rice PRR5 and PRR9 have not yet been phylogenetically
resolved from each other, nor have rice PRR3 and PRR7)
[23,34].

sus structures for all four given domains were compared
by SARF2 [31]. From this, those structures most related
were taken forward for comparisons. These 12 structures
are available as supplemental files in PDB format (see
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). The
three-dimensional domains were aligned and visually
presented using MACPYMOL 0.99 (DeLano Scientific
LLC, Palo Alto, USA). Related structures were found with
SSM [32]. Calcium was fit using the GG method [33]. The
bacterial response regulators were CheY (PDB code 1E6K)
and SPO0F (PDB code 1SRR). A PDF file of the CCT
domain of CONSTANS was provided by Dr. Coupland.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetics
We sought to detect TOC1-related sequences from various
plants as a phylogenetic starting tool for structural predictions. For this, AtTOC1 [22] and OsTOC1 [34] were used
to search genome-sequence databases. Full-length predicted proteins were found for Castanea sativa, Lotus japonicus, and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, and more
recently, Vitis vinifera and Populus trichocarpa. These full-

We generated a phylogenetic tree using UNWEIGHTED
PAIR GROUP METHOD WITH ARITHMETIC MEAN
(UPGMA) clustering and a bootstrap replicate number of
10,000 to confirm that the encoded proteins isolated from
databases were the orthologues of TOC1 and paralogous
to the other PRRs. As can be seen in Figure 1, the
sequences CsTOC1, LjTOC1, McTOC1, PtTOC1, and
VvTOC1 all clustered with the rice and Arabidopsis TOC1
proteins, as expected. Because it would have been computationally too intense to model all TOC1 polypeptides, a
selection of four was taken forward. These representatives
were AtTOC1, CsTOC1, LjTOC1, and McTOC1; noted in
red in Figure 1. We further reasoned that the use of four
structural models of orthologous sequences would provide a template to assign the relatedness of any one given
structure.
Model predictions of TOC1
We sought to infer tertiary structure of TOC1 using ab initio approaches through the ROSETTA software suite. This
suite provides one strategy towards understanding potential folds of a target protein starting simply with the primary amino-acid sequence [36,37]. The TOC1 sequences
are computationally too large for complete structural
solution by ROSETTA as a single polypeptide chain [36],
thus putative folding modules within the sequences were
required to be defined. Here, a folding module is defined
as a unit within the polypeptide required for a given biochemical activity. To define modules, the full set of above
defined TOC1 proteins were aligned (Figure 2) and the
transition areas in the lineup where sequence conservation moves to non-conservation was noted (color points
to these transitions is indicated in Figure 2). These informatic "cut sites" are estimates of folding modules [38]. By
this approach, TOC1 could be dissected into three
domain modules (Figure 2). With respect to the AtTOC1
protein, these modules were from amino-acid positions
1–189, 190–412, and 413–618, respectively. As four
TOC1 sequences were to be applied to ROSETTA, with
three modules each, we therefore proceeded with predicting structures for twelve separate polypeptide domains.

Each module was edited from the four respective fulllength proteins and modeled separately. A family of 500
models of each module was generated and these were

I and module III, there is far more identity than in module II. Abbreviations refer to: At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cs, Castanea sativa;

clustered based on the free-energy landscape within these,
leading to groups of up to 10 related structural families. In
these clusters, the structure centered within a given cluster
was selected as the representative of said cluster. For this,
ROSETTA determines an all-atom energy axis and plots
this against an axis of the ROOT MEAN SQUARE DEVIA-

TION (RMSD) of the resultant structures [36]. From there,
each of the related four proteins of each module was processed on SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF BACKBONE
FRAGMENTS 2 (SARF2) [31] as an approach to define
those structures within clusters that most resembled likeness to orthologous structural domains. We note that

Models of module I
We first generated protein models for the amino-terminal
third of the TOC1 polypeptides (Table 1, Figure 3). These
models were highly related in structure to each other (Figure 3). Using a query of the generated structures against all
known protein structures at the Protein Data Bank, via the
use of the software SECONDARY STRUCTURE MATCHING (SSM) [32], we found that all models were predicted
to fold similarly to bacterial RR proteins (data not shown;
see below for discussion and Figure 4 for representative
example) [39,40]. Generally, all module I structures have
a core of five alpha helices interdigited with alternating
beta sheets. This resembles the canonical fold of all RR
structures. As well, an alpha-helical tail extends from the
RR-like portion of the structure.

The mutations toc1-5 (P124S) and toc1-8 (P96L) lay
within module I, and the AtTOC1 structure allows examination of where this mutation would perturb function.
Amino acid 96 is in a predicted beta sheet that bridges
helix three and four. This proline mutation might disrupt
folding activity as a structural mutation. Amino-acid position 124 is in a loop between helix four and five. Whilst
this could be a structural mutation, this position does not
lie within an obvious folding pattern. The P124S mutation might affect TOC1 binding to a putative associated
molecule (see "additional files" to retrieve the PDB files to
expand a view on these, and all other, structures).

images at the left, the colors from blue to red represent
sequence length from an amino- to carboxy-terminal direction. For the aligned figures at the right, the Arabidopsis
module I is colored green in contrast to a red color for the
compared alignment.

SARF2 was developed as a clustering approach that detects
ensembles of secondary-structure elements that form similar spatial arrangements, whilst accepting different possible topological connections [31]. With this approach, we
found within the identified structural clusters the subclade with the best statistical fit, as assessed by RMSD, for
a given structural module. Combining the representative
clustering of ROSETTA to the relatedness clusters of SARF2
lead to one choice for each module within a given
sequence. The resultant structures from this method were
thus selected as the most representative of a given structural protein module. What follows is a description of
each model and our discussion of the implications for
that particular module.

The RR class of proteins mediates phospho-relay signaling
in bacteria and plants [41,42]. That the amino terminus of
TOC1 was predicted to fold like an RR is not a surprise, as
the primary sequence of this domain is detected by BASIC
LOCAL ALIGNMENT SEARCH TOOL (BLAST) [43] as
resembling an RR. We found that a superimposition of the
Arabidopsis model on two bona fide RR crystal structures
(Escherichia coli CheY and Bacillus subtilis SPO0F [44-46])
reveals an excellent structural fit (Figure 4). We note that
there is an amino- and carboxy-terminal extension of the
first domain of TOC1 relative to the two bacterial proteins
tested.
A structure resembling an RR implicates an origin of function for the amino-terminal module of TOC1. This further
supports the phylogeny relations of the amino-terminal
module of PRR to genuine RRs [40]. In each of the four
TOC1 modules, an Ala is present at what is the Asp site of
phosphorylation in a bona fide RR. In the illustrated models for module I (Figure 3), this Ala is predicted to be
within the center of the five alpha-helical borders. This is
all consistent with the previous hypothesis that TOC1 is
not a substrate of a histidine kinase [22]. As the structures
generated all resemble an RR (Figures 3 and 4; and data
not shown), we conclude that these models are likely to
resemble the "true" fold of this domain module.

What could be the function of an RR-domain-type fold
within module I of TOC1, particularly as it appears incapable of functioning as a true RR? Several possibilities
exist. For one, this domain could be a protein-binding site
incorporating, via a scaffold function, the activities of
other clock proteins, as for example, transcription factors.
Specifically, TOC1 is known to bind members of the
bHLH transcription factor family (e.g. PIL1, PIF3, PIF4,
PIL6) [47,48]. However, in these studies, the RR domain
was shown not to be required for binding of PIF4 or PIL6
[49]. PRR proteins can also form dimers, and in case of
TOC1 binding to PRR9, PRR9 was found to interact with
TOC1 through the RR domain [49]. Furthermore, an
important role of the RR domain in protein-protein interaction was found for PRR3 when defined as a substrate of

the kinase WNK1 [50,51]. In addition, it is not yet established if the ZEITLUPE (ZTL) or the PRR3 binding sites
associate with the RR domain [13,29]; both ZTL and PRR3
are confirmed protein interactors to TOC1. It is also plausible that the RR-type domain/module could be a redoxresponsive site, as was hypothesized by the work of the
Golden group [52,53]. What appears clear is that identification of interacting molecules to the amino-terminal
module will likely define a biochemical function.
Models of module II
Our next efforts were to model the middle third of the
four TOC1 modules. These predictions were found to be
structurally unrelated to each other (Figure 5, Table 1).
This is of interest as the primary amino-acid composition

Page 6 of 12

Journal of Circadian Rhythms 2008, 6:3

http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/6/1/3

of the middle third is the most distinct (Figure 2). We note
that this is true for the other PRR proteins as well [54]. The
lack of a consensus structure within the middle third of
the polypeptide (Figure 5) prohibits us from making any
structural conclusions. As well, this module lacks relations
to other structural features bioinformatically characterized. One small amino-acid stretch is conserved in the second module; respective to AtTOC1 module II, the
sequence is KKSRLKIGESSAFFTYVKST. Examination of
this stretch within module II of the four predicted structures revealed no fold consensus. It is thus difficult for us
to predict the reliability of the presented models of the
middle module.
What could be the function of this middle module? As
this region is poorly predicted, and no structural elements
were found to resemble the folds of known proteins (data
not shown), we present the hypothesis that this part of the
protein functions as a linker domain. This is supported by
the sequence dissimilarity in this region of the protein
(Figure 2). In addition, the previously defined directrepeat within AtTOC1 (position 275–369) is not present
in orthologous TOC1 proteins. Thus, amino-acid composition of module II appears to be under rapid divergence.
We note that a linker is a known feature in separating protein modules, as for example, this is seen in cullin [55]
and calmodulin [56]. In each case, linker spacing is critical
[57,58]. The sequence degeneration of a putative linker
within TOC1 might imply that the PRR polypeptides have
dissimilar folds in their middle third. It is also plausible
that module II is a native unfolded domain. Perhaps protein length here is more important than a particular structure or amino acid composition.

Models of module III
Our final structural efforts targeted the carboxy-termini of
the four described TOC1 proteins (Figure 6, Table 1).
Unlike module II, each of these was predicted to generate
a fold family. All four structures contain two alpha-helices
towards the extreme terminus of the protein. This serves
to center alignments and represents the CCT sub-domain.
This CCT was always found to consist of a small alphahelical interphase, and in all cases this predicted fold was
similar (Figure 6). The overall folding of these structures
was found to be predominantly alpha-helical with inter
bundle-to-bundle interactions and folded substructures
that lack prolonged secondary structure (Figure 6). We
further note that module III of TOC1 contains a primary
amino-acid composition that does not lend to a detectable primary architecture of known factors. Given the relatedness of the four module III structures, we conclude that
the predicted structures could contain structural elements
that resemble the true fold.

The presented fold of module III implicates the carboxy
terminus of TOC1 in metal binding and also associations
to DNA-binding proteins (see below). One interesting feature of the four carboxy-terminal modules is that in structural searches against the three-dimensional folds we
generated, each of these four TOC1 modules was found to
be in a fold most similar to that present in various metalbinding proteins. Interestingly, the primary amino-acid
composition of these domains is unlike that of other
metal-binding domains, such as an EF-hand [59]. As the
primary and secondary structures of the terminal domain
of TOC1 did not detect such relations, we suspect that a
structural-folding pattern was required to detect structural
elements that relate to biochemical function.
Each TOC1 module III might be related to a metal-binding protein. By SSM searches, we found that the AtTOC1
structure was most related to calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase (a protein known to be regulated by calcium) [60]; CsTOC1 was most related to calmodulin (a
known calcium-binding protein) [61,62]; LtTOC1 was
also most related to calmodulin; and McTOC1 was most
related to the zinc-bound form of cell filamentation protein (Structure 2f6s in The Protein Data Bank). Based on
the obvious implication that module III could participate
in Ca2+ binding, we tried to detect such a binding pocket
by a computational approach. Here, we were successful in
our ability to fit each of these structures with a bound calcium ion using the GG computational approach [33]. In
each case, we could detect that the amino-terminal region
of module III harbors a site that could accept the placement of a calcium ion (Figure 6). Note that this is distant
from the CCT domain in each case (Figure 6). We thus
propose that the third module of TOC1 can be implicated
in aspects of metal signaling. This computational finding
provides a testable hypothesis for the future.

to red represent sequence length from the amino- to carboxy-terminal direction. Note that alpha-helical clusters in
the carboxy terminus center these structures, and that a calcium ion can be fit into all four structures in an amino-terminal position within all structures. The red arrow points to
the fit calcium, which is colored as a gray sphere.

We found that the CCT domain within this third of TOC1
was predicted to fold in a similar manner as the CCT
domain from CONSTANS (CO) (Figure 7) [63]. As CO is
a bona fide interactor to HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN
(HAP) transcription factors [63], it is intriguing that TOC1
could also associate with this class of DNA-binding factors. Two mutant alleles map to the CCT subdomain of
module III, and we can thus view the location of these
changes. The toc1-1 and toc1-3 mutations (A562V) both
map to an alpha-helical fold within the CCT subdomain,
and we note that this Ala residue is conserved in all
sequences. The A562V mutation could affect the ability of
the CCT to fold into a helix. This would impair its ability
to bind target proteins, such as HAP factors. If the hypothesis that the CCT subdomain of TOC1 is a binding interface of HAP factors were true, this would directly implicate
TOC1 as a co-regulator of transcription. As TOC1 genetically functions to promote CCA1 and LHY transcription

[10,15-18,24], it is an exciting hypothesis that TOC1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator in a multi-protein
complex on promoters of clock-regulated genes.
What could be the function of module III in TOC1? It is
intriguing that the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillates with an evening peak close to the time that TOC1 is
most abundant [26,29]. cAMPR drives both the circadian
oscillations of cytosolic calcium and the rhythmic expression of many clock genes, however not TOC1 [2]. It might
be that Ca2+ interacts with TOC1 posttranslationally, an
idea that is consistent with the fact that calcium rhythms
are unaffected in the toc1-1 mutant [27]. This calcium
interaction would drive the ability of TOC1 protein to regulate its targets. One could thus hypothesize TOC1 to be
a component of decoding the Ca2+ signal. If true, TOC1
could generate this function by direct interaction with
Ca2+. A direct test of Ca2+-binding to TOC1 seems a plausible experiment to implicate this protein as a sensor for
the circadian levels of Ca2+. From there, it would be of
interest to test TOC1 binding to HAP factors, and test the
role of Ca2+ (or another metal) in supporting or attenuating this binding.
General considerations of the models and implications of
a unified TOC1
How likely are the TOC1 models we present to be correct?
This is difficult to assess. In fact, the community standard
to answer this question requires the actual structure to be
determined [64]. In the absence of an experimentally
derived TOC1 structure, we believe that modeling could
be useful for predictive biochemistry and to direct further
experimentation. We also note that in various benchmarks, ROSETTA correctly predicted protein structures
approximately half of the time [36]. We thus conclude
that aspects of the model presented here are likely to have

regulators. II Linker domain – a putative bridge between
modules I and III. III Calcium-binding domain – a potential

models, such as side-chain directionality, are unlikely to
be correct.
An over-riding theme generated from our models is the
hypothesis that TOC1 acts as a signal adapter that senses
a small ligand (e.g. Ca2+ or a redox signal) and that this is
part of a transcription complex (Figure 8). This multifaceted hypothesis is intriguing given that the plant clock is
modulated by small-molecule signaling [65]. For example, redox levels change in response to light [53,66]. Thus,
as predicted by Golden and colleagues, the amino-terminus of TOC1 could be involved in metabolite sensing to
mediate entrainment. Also, Ca2+ levels coincide with that
of TOC1 [26,29]. The scaffold principles implicated from
the amino- and carboxy-modules could support a mechanism for TOC1 as a transcriptional mediator that functions in response to signal integration from distinct
signaling pathways. This scaffold hypothesis defines the
middle module as a tether that links modules I and III.
The high degeneration of amino-acid composition in this
middle module would support a spacer function rather
than a scaffold or enzymatic activity. What is clear is that
a biochemical hypothesis now exists to describe how
TOC1 leads to transcriptional induction of CCA1 and
LHY.
