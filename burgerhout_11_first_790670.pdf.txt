Abstract
Background: Studies on artificial hybridization of different Anguilla species were conducted recently, i.e. female
A. australis with male A. dieffenbachii, and female A. japonica with male A. anguilla. The existence of these artificial
hybrids was however not demonstrated by independent genetic methods. Two species - A. anguilla and
A. australis - that are phylogenetically close but have different sexual maturation times (12-25 weeks and 6-8 weeks,
respectively), were expected to produce favourable hybrids for reproduction studies.
Results: A modification of the protocol for the reproduction of Anguilla japonica was used to produce eight-day
Anguilla australis larvae, with a success rate of 71.4%. Thus ten out of 14 females produced eggs that could be
fertilized, and three batches resulted in mass hatching. Hybrid larvae from female A. australis x male A. Anguilla
survived for up to seven days post fertilization (dpf). The early development of the hybrid showed typical
characteristics of A. anguilla tail pigmentation at 50 hours post fertilization (hpf), indicating expression of genes
derived from the father.
Conclusions: In this paper we describe the first production of hybrid larvae from male A. anguilla and female
A. australis and their survival for up to 7 dpf. A species-specific nucleotide difference in the 18 S rDNA gene
confirmed that genes from both A. australis and A. anguilla were present in the hybrids. The developmental stages
of the hybrid eel embryos and larvae are described using high resolution images. Video footage also indicated a
heart beat in 5-dpf larva.

Background
A number of research groups have attempted artificial
reproduction in various species of eel: A. japonica [1-5],
A. anguilla [[6-9], Tomkiewicz, unpublished data],
A. dieffenbachii [10], A. australis [[10], Kurwie, unpublished data], and A. rostrata [10]. Some Japanese scientists have also overcome major problems associated with
developing artificial feeds for larvae and have successfully produced leptocephalus larvae [11] and glass eels
[12,13]. Tanaka and his co-workers used a mix of shark
egg powder, soya peptide, minerals, vitamins and krill
paste [11] to develop a successful feed for A. japonica.
Further research is, however, needed to develop suitable
diets and rearing techniques for the production of larvae
of other Anguilla species and their hybrids.

European eel (A. anguilla) females have a much
slower, and widely-variable, response to hormonal
stimulation [9] when compared to females of other
freshwater eel species (e.g. A. japonica and A. australis).
At the onset of the natural spawning migration, the
gonadosomatic index (GSI) of A. anguilla females is
close to 2% [A Palstra, unpublished data] and they are
still in a previtellogenic state when they migrate to sea.
However, females of A. australis have a higher GSI, of
up to 4% [14], indicating that they are sexually more
advanced than A. anguilla at the same stage The same
holds true for A. japonica, which has a GSI of up to 4%
at the commencement of its spawning migration [15].
Induction of vitellogenesis and final maturation in
A. australis requires approximately six to eight weekly
hormonal injections [[10], Kurwie, unpublished data]
while 9-12 injections [4], or 6-15 weekly injections [11],
are required for A. japonica and up to 12-25 weekly
injections for A. anguilla [7-9].

There are several reasons for testing hybridization
between European and New Zealand short finned eels.
There are large differences in silver eel maturation states
between these species. In contrast to the stage reached
by A. australis, silver eels of A. anguilla have not yet
commenced vitellogenesis. Shortening the artificial trajectory may overcome vitellogenic abnormalities, resulting in higher gamete quality and higher success rates of
fertilization, hatching and larval development.
Anguilla anguilla is listed by the IUCN as critically
endangered [16], which raises some problems in association with the culture of this species. Farming is reliant
on the influx of wild glass eel, thereby pressurizing wild
stocks. Breeding for aquaculture is, nevertheless, supposed to take pressure off wild stocks. Therefore, the
hybridization of A. anguilla with a species such as
A. australis, that has a short artificial trajectory, may be
a suitable option for aquaculture. Since maturation
levels at silvering are very different in the parent species,
it is quite possible that the maturation level of the
hybrid at the silver stage would be far more advanced
than that of the European silver eel. Furthermore, since
A. australis lives in the southern hemisphere, its migration is in January-June [17], in contrast to A. anguilla,
which migrates in October-November. To gain insights
into the combination of the properties of A. australis
and A. anguilla present in hybrids, it is useful to study
eel reproduction and to compare the early ontogeny of
these species including their hybrids.
A number of studies on hybridization of various eel
species have been previously conducted: for example,
female A. australis with male A. dieffenbachii [10], and
female A. japonica with male A. anguilla [18]. The existence of the artificial hybrids has not, however, been
demonstrated by independent genetic methods. In contrast, genetic evidence for natural hybrids between the
Atlantic species A. rostrata and A. anguilla has been
demonstrated [19]. Since A. anguilla and A. australis
are phylogenetically more closely related than some
other hybrids (for example, A. anguilla and A. japonica
[20]), we hypothesized that hybridization between the
former two species would be possible. In this paper we
describe experiments on the hybridization of A. anguilla
and A. australis and post-fertilization survival levels.
Investigations into the18 S rDNA gene – for the purpose of genetic validation – are also described.

Results
Reproduction

After 4 weeks of injections with hCG, the first
A. australis male started to spermiate and all males had
spermiated within 6 weeks. After 9 weeks the injections
were stopped. Three of the 15 A. anguilla males produced sperm after 5 weekly injections and all males of

Page 2 of 9

A. anguilla had produced sperm after 6 weekly injections. Before use, the males received a booster hCG
injection to reactivate spermiation.
In most females, hormone treatment resulted in a
rapid increase in body weight after 9-13 injections with
salmon pituitary extract (SPE). Ten of the 14 females
(71.4%) ovulated once and seven females ovulated twice
during this study. The second ovulation was induced
2 weeks after the first ovulation by a single injection of
20 mg SPE/kg dissolved in 1 mL 0.9% saline, one priming injection of SPE, and an injection with 17, 20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) one day later. Three
females did not respond to the SPE treatment and one
female died after the DHP injection, just before ovulation. In total, three out of the ten batches of eggs produced larvae (33.3%). The larvae of two of the three
batches from A. australis x A. australis stayed alive for
5 dpf, and the larvae from one batch of the hybrid
A. australis x A. anguilla stayed alive for 7 dpf. Some of
the eggs from one batch of A. australis were reared at
25°C, which resulted in larvae that survived until 8 dpf.
Embryogenesis and early larval development of
A. australis

After fertilization (Figure 1a), developing eggs floated to
a level just below the surface of the water, resulting in a
clear separation from undeveloped eggs, which sank.
Cell divisions occurred every 30-60 minutes. The 4-cell
and 8-cell states were observed at the 1.5 hpf stage
(Figure 1b) and the 2 hpf stage (Figure 1c), respectively.
The 16-cell stage and 32-cell stage were observed at
2.5 hpf (Figure 1d) and 4 hpf (Figure 1e), respectively.
The morula stage (Figure 1f) and the blastula stage
(Figure 1g) were observed at 6 hpf and 7 hpf, respectively. An embryonic shield started to form between 9
and 13 hpf (Figure 1h and 1i), and the late gastrula
stage was observed at about 20 hpf (Figure 1j). Somitogenesis started between 20 and 24 hpf (Figure 2). The
Kuppfer’s vesicle (Figure 2c, for description see [21])
was observed at about 26 hpf, and the first heartbeat
occurred at about 43 hpf.
Neutral buoyancy of the eggs was observed just before
hatching. At approximately 43 hpf the embryos started
to hatch and at that time had approximately 40 somites
(Figure 3a; 45 hpf). After hatching (Figure 3b; 2.5 dpf)
the larvae (at first C-shaped) were positioned upright in
the water column, probably due to the position of the
oil droplet. It appeared that the larvae were neutrally
buoyant at 35 ppt. The larvae were immobile, except
when disturbed by light or vibrations, which caused very
fast and short horizontal movements. During sampling
procedures (by pipette) the larvae avoided suction, and
swam in the opposite direction at speeds of up to
several body lengths per second. Sampling caused

mechanical damage to larvae, followed by death within a
short period. Discoloration of the brain and neural tube
was observed within a few seconds, followed by cellular
breakdown of the larvae.
Larvae elongated during development and lateral neuromast cells on the flank were observed at 68 hpf. Head
development showed remarkable changes over time,
especially a decrease in volume of the 4 th ventricle
between 5 and 6.5 dpf (Figure 4a, b), the protrusion of
the mouth and development of teeth between 5 and
8 dpf, and pigmentation of the eyes at 8 dpf (Figure 4c).
The angle of the head also increased in such a way that
the mouth protruded anteriorly. At 8 dpf the larvae
showed well developed teeth and a straightened head,
indicating that they had reached the feeding stage. No
visual differences in development between larvae from
A. australis and the hybrid species were observed,
except for the development of tail pigment cells, which
were already present at about 2 dpf in the hybrid. In
contrast, the pigmented cells appeared much later (5-6
dpf) in A. australis (Figure 5a, b).

Video recordings were made of several larvae, to
observe the heart beat. The heart is bent in an S-shape,
contracting regularly at a frequency of about 54 beats
per minute in a 5 dpf larva (Additional file 1). There
were no significant differences between the heart beat
rates of 2 dpf and 5 dpf larvae, suggesting that the rate
is based on the innate rhythm of heart muscle tissue.
DNA analysis

A species-specific nucleotide difference in the 18 S
rDNA genes of A. australis and A. anguilla (Figure 6)
allowed us to provide genetic evidence that we had produced hybrid offspring from the two species. The PCR
product amplified from the 18 S rDNA gene is 428 bp
long and has a single mismatch between A. anguilla and
A. australis at position 222, resulting in a BssHII restriction site, specific for the A. australis product (Figure 6).
BssHII digestion of the PCR product from A. australis
therefore results in 207 bp and 221 bp fragments,
whereas the 428 bp PCR product from A. anguilla is
not digested by BssHII. As the hybrid species must

contain both the A. anguilla and the A. australis 18 S
rDNA genes, three fragments were expected. Figure 7
clearly shows that the parental species A. anguilla and
A. australis, as well as their hybrid, can be identified
using the 18 S rDNA gene.

Discussion
In this study, we succeeded in breeding Anguilla australis under artificial conditions and produced free swimming larvae of this species. In addition, hybrids of
A. australis x A. anguilla were produced for the first
time and genetic methods were used to confirm the
existence of this hybrid. The hybrid larvae were kept
alive for a maximum of 7 dpf and the larvae of
A. australis for a maximum of 8 dpf.
Larvae of A. japonica reach the feeding stage at
approximately 7 days after hatching [3]. This development is strongly temperature dependent and for
A. japonica the optimal temperature was shown to be
about 25°C [22-24]. It was noted that hatching also
occurred at about 25°C [25] at the spawning site, suggesting that this may be the optimal temperature for
early development. It was, however, noted that within a
few days the larvae were distributed over an extremely
large area at much lower temperatures [25], suggesting
that early larvae are able to develop at a wide range of
temperatures.
In our study, the larvae raised at 25°C (Figure 4c) were
sufficiently developed to start feeding. In contrast, the
7 dpf larvae that were raised at 21°C had not yet reached
the feeding stage and the head was still in a tilted position. The ten dpf larvae of A. australis – collected by
T. Kurwie at (illustrated in [26]) a prevailing temperature
of 21°C – were slightly more developed, although the 4th
ventricle was still large and the eyes were not as fully pigmented, as in the 8 dpf larvae reared at 25°C (Figure 4d).
This clearly indicated that the main differences occur in
the development of the head. Compared to 8 dpf larvae
reared at 25°C, the mouths of 10 dpf larvae reared at 21°
C were not fully developed, the teeth were just starting to
form, and the mouth angle was not fully protruded
anteriorly. This shows that development is highly

temperature dependent and that larval development cannot be indicated by age alone.
Compared to other species, such as zebrafish [27] and
medaka [28], development of the Anguilla head seems
relatively slow. On the other hand, the appearance of
the lateral neuromast cells, which are part of the
mechanosensory system, was already observed on the
flanks at approximately 1 dpf. After hatching, the larvae
were very sensitive to vibrations, indicating that
mechanoreception is well developed at this stage. Similar results were also reported for A. australis [10] and
A. japonica. [29].
There were no visual differences in development and
appearance between the two species other than the difference in timing of tail pigmentation, which occurred a
few days earlier in the hybrid species than in
A. australis. This seems to be a trait of the European
eel, as a similar appearance of tail pigmentation was
observed in A. anguilla [A Palstra, unpublished data]
(Figure 5c). The reason for tail pigmentation occurring
at this early stage remains unknown.
In studies on the natural hybrid of A. anguilla with
A. rostrata [19,30], hybridization was validated by an independent method. This was not the case for recent artificial
Anguilla hybridizations performed by Okamura et al. [18]
and Lokman and Young [10]. Our results (Figure 7), based
on the species-specific nucleotide difference in nuclear 18
S rDNA, show that both A. anguilla and A. australis and
their hybrid A. anguilla × A. australis can been identified
according to the method of Frankowski & Bastrop [30], in
which the following fragments were produced: a single
18 S rDNA fragment for A. anguilla, two fragments for
A. australis, and three fragments for the hybrid species,
indicating that two alleles from both parent species were
present in the hybrid.
There are still problems with artificial reproduction
and larval rearing of Anguilla species, partly due to high
individual variability in response to hormone treatments,
and partly due to selecting the correct feed for larvae.
Tanaka et al. [11] developed a reasonably successful
feed for Japanese eel larvae although almost all larvae
died before, or shortly after, the first feeding stage,

Recent analysis of A. anguilla larval gut contents
indicated that the diet of the smallest larvae consisted of
a variety of plankton organisms, with Hydrozoa and
Polycystinea species occurring most frequently [32]. So it
seems that eel larvae may take a variety of available food
from their immediate environment.

Conclusions
The applied reproduction method resulted in healthy
embryos and larvae of New Zealand short finned eels
(A. australis) as well as hybrids from male European
eels (A. anguilla) crossed with female New Zealand
short finned eels. The developmental stages of eel
embryos and larvae are described by means of high
resolution images. In this paper we described the first
production of hybrid larvae from male A. anguilla and
female A. australis and their survival for up to 7 days
post fertilization (dpf). Evidence for hybridization is
based on a single nucleotide difference in the 18 S
rDNA gene of both species. This is the first time that
an artificial Anguilla hybrid has been validated by
means of a genetic tool. Future work with this hybrid
may provide further understanding of the reproductive
mechanisms that affect breeding of the European eel,
which is now on the CITES list of critically endangered
species.

which may have been due to the unnatural feeding
methods that were employed. Possibly due to negative
phototaxis, the larvae swim downwards towards the
shark egg paste, where they encounter the food [[11];
Yoshimatsu, personal communication].
It is assumed that the natural food sources for leptocephalus larvae of Anguilla spp. are the oikopleura larvacean shelters (or ‘marine snow’), which have been found
in larval digestive tracts of several Anguilloid species [31].

Silver females (n = 14; 80.1 ± 0.4 cm; 978.1 ± 19.5 g)
and males (n = 8; 45.6 ± 1.4 cm; 172.5 ± 14.9 g) of New
Zealand short-finned eels (A. australis) were caught in
Lake Ellesmere in Christchurch, New Zealand, and
transported to The Netherlands in aired plastic bags
with a small amount of water, fitted into polystyrene
boxes. Silver male European eels (A. anguilla) were purchased from the eel farm Royaal BV (Helmond, The
Netherlands).
Anguilla australis females and males were kept together
in a 1000 L tank filled with natural seawater, collected
from Lake Grevelingen (30 ppt), and coupled to a 1500 L
recirculation system (salinity 30 ppt, 21°C). The daily cycle
was set with blue light (Philips special TLD Blue 36W/18)
at 16:8 L:D. To compensate for the 11 h time difference
between The Netherlands and New Zealand, the daily
cycle was changed stepwise (1 h per week) to Central European Time (CET). Anguilla anguilla males (n = 15; 40.4 ±
0.6 cm; 118.8 ± 4.9 g) were kept in a 1500 L tank connected to a 2400 L recirculation system, in natural seawater
(30 ppt, 21°C), under a complete dark regime. PVC pipes
were introduced into both systems to provide refuges for
animals. All animals were starved throughout the experiment, and treated on a weekly basis with Melafix (API

means of inserting a cannula (polyethylene tube, inner
diameter 1.4 mm) through the oviduct. Oocytes were
checked under a microscope to ascertain developmental
stages. When migration of the germinal vesicle – still
with many oil droplets in the oocytes (stage 3/4 in
European eel according to [9]) – was observed, the
female was primed with a single injection of SPE
(20 mg/kg dissolved in 1 mL 0.9% saline). After 24 h, ovulation was induced by means of intraperitoneal injections
of 17, 20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP 2 mg/kg,
Sigma-Aldrich BV, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) dissolved in DMSO, administered at six to eight locations.
Male New-Zealand short-finned eels were treated
according to a modified version of Ohta’s protocol [4,5].
They were subjected to a weekly IM injection procedure
(at a site approximately 0.5-1 cm below the rostral
attachment of the dorsal fin) with 250 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Sigma-Aldrich BV, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) dissolved in 0.1 mL 0.9%
saline. Males were injected every week for up to
9 weeks and checked for spermiation by hand stripping.
After 9 weeks, all males produced milt and injections
were stopped until a female was ready to spawn. (This
reduced handling stress; it was also noted that the
sperm quality did not decline much during the “holding”
period). On the day before the eggs were to be stripped,
two to three males that demonstrated high sperm motility were selected and stimulated with a single booster
dose of 500 IU dissolved in 0.1 mL saline. Sperm motility was determined visually under a microscope, after
mixing a drop of sperm with a drop of seawater. Only
sperm with at least 50% motility (continuous activity of
> 50% of spermatozoa) was used for fertilization.
For the production of a hybrid between A. australis
and A. anguilla, 15 farmed male European eels received
weekly intraperitoneal (IP) hCG injections, according to
the protocol for European eel [9], at a dose of 200 IU/
male, followed by a booster dose of 1,000 IU hCG (in
0.2 ml 0.9% saline) 24 h before a fertilization trial.
Artificial fertilization and larval rearing

Two to three males per species were hand stripped 24 h
after the hCG booster injection. Milt was collected in a
syringe (10 mL) and kept on ice or in the refrigerator
for a maximum of 48 h. Sperm motility was checked
prior to fertilization by means of microscopic examination. Females were expected to ovulate between 11 and
15 h after the final injection with DHP. The artificial
fertilization programme was terminated in cases when
female spawning only commenced after more than 18 h
after the final injection, which is indicative of low fertility and hatchability [5]. After the final injection, females
were checked hourly for egg release, by gently pressing

on the abdomen near the vent. When a female showed
an ovarian plug, the plug was gently removed. Eggs
were collected in plastic, pre-weighed, sterilized bowls.
The first flow of eggs (~50 g) was not used for fertilization. The combined egg weight was determined after all
eggs had been stripped.
The collected sperm was added to dry eggs in bowls and
mixed. Fresh seawater (35 ppt, 20°C) was added, and after
approximately 3-4 min the eggs were transferred into
buckets with fresh (sterile) seawater (~20 L). A net (of
mesh size 600 μm) was used to separate floating eggs
from sinking eggs. The former were transferred, after
30-45 min, to another bucket containing fresh seawater.
Finally, the eggs were transferred to 1 L glass beakers and/
or 200 mL Petri dishes, for observation. At this stage they
were kept in complete darkness at 21°C and a salinity of
35 ppt. Approximately 24 hours after incubation, the
water was refreshed by transferring the still-floating eggs
into new glass beakers or Petri dishes. During the trial, all
white or sunken eggs were removed. A portion of eggs
from one batch were also reared at 25°C.
DNA analysis

As described by Frankowski & Bastrop [30], parental
species and their hybrids can be identified by means of
polymorphism in nuclear 18 S rDNA. For our study we
used a slightly different protocol, as described below.
Total DNA was isolated and purified from ten whole
hybrid larvae and fin-clips of parental specimens, using
a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the FastStart
High Fidelity PCR System protocol (Roche) and an
amplification profile consisting of denaturation for
3 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C
and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C for final
extension. Amplification was carried out according to
the manufacturer’s instructions in 50 μL 1 × FastStart
High Fidelity Reaction Buffer containing 1.8 mM MgCl2,
2.5 U FastStart High Fidelity Enzyme Blend, 1 μg chromosomal DNA, 0.4 μM of the 18 S rDNA forward and
reverse primers, and 0.2 mM dNTPs.
The sense (5’-AGC ATA TGC TTG TCT CAA AGA
TTA AG-3’) and antisense (5’-CTG CTG CCT TCC
TTG GAT GTG G-3”) primers were based on NCBI
accession numbers FM946133 (A. australis) and
FM946070 (A. anguilla) [23]. The PCR product was
purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen)
and 0.5 μg of the purified fragments were digested with
two units of the restricting enzyme BssHII (New England Biolabs Inc) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Restriction enzyme digestion was conducted in 10 μL reaction buffer for 1 h at 37°C. DNA
fragments were made visible using a 2% agarose gel.
