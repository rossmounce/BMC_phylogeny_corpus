Hippobosca longipennis - a potential intermediate
host of a species of Acanthocheilonema in dogs
in northern India
Puteri Azaziah Megat Abd Rani1,3*, Glen T Coleman1, Peter J Irwin2 and Rebecca J Traub1

Abstract
Background: Hippobosca longipennis (the ‘dog louse fly’) is a blood sucking ectoparasite found on wild carnivores
such as cheetahs and lions and domesticated and feral dogs in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, including China.
Known as an intermediate host for Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides and a transport host for Cheyletiella yasguri, it
has also been suggested that H. longipennis may be a vector for other pathogens, including Acanthocheilonema
sp.? nov., which was recently reported to infect up to 48% of dogs in northern India where this species of fly is
known to commonly infest dogs. To test this hypothesis, hippoboscid flies feeding on dogs in Ladakh in northern
India were collected and subjected to microscopic dissection.
Results: A total of 12 infective larvae were found in 10 out of 65 flies dissected; 9 from the head, 2 from the
thorax and 1 from the abdomen. The larvae averaged 2, 900 (± 60) μm in length and 34 (± 5) μm in width and
possessed morphological features characteristic of the family Onchocercidae. Genetic analysis and comparison of
the 18S, ITS-2, 12S and cox-1 genes confirmed the identity of the larvae as the Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov.
reported in dogs in Ladakh.
Conclusion: This study provides evidence for a potential intermediate host-parasite relationship between H.
longipennis and the canine Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. in northern India.

Background
Hippoboscids are highly specialised larviparous ectoparasitic flies, spending all or most of their adult life within
the fur or among feathers of their mammal and avian
hosts [1]. The family Hippoboscidae is divided into
three subfamilies; Lipopteninae, Ornithomyiinae and
Hippoboscinae. This family represents one of the most
important blood-sucking insect groups of birds and
ruminants [2], however comparatively little attention has
been paid to their role as an ectoparasite of dogs and
their potential as an intermediate host for canine
parasites.
Wild and domestic canids represent the preferred/primary hosts for Hippobosca longipennis [3]. The geographical distribution of H. longipennis includes arid and
semi arid regions of southern Europe, Africa, the Middle

East and Asia, including China and India [4-6]. In 1970,
H. longipennis was introduced into the United States
after infested captive cheetahs were imported from east
Africa [7] and the flies were subsequently detected on
cheetahs at safari parks in Texas, Georgia and Oregon.
Eradication efforts were successful and since then there
is no evidence that this species has become established
in the United State or elsewhere in the New World
[6-8]. Hippobosca longipennis has been reported to
alight on humans [5] and occasionally bite [3], but the
extent of their ability to feed on humans is unknown.
The fly has been reported infesting Indian dogs since
1966 and has been reported in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, West
Bengal and the eastern zone of Maharashtra state
[3,5,9,10].
With the exception of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens, other species of canine filarial infections
are generally asymptomatic, but microfilariae have been
associated with skin hypersensitivity reactions [11,12].

Adult filarial nematodes of the genus Acanthocheilonema are usually found in the body cavities and/or subcutaneous tissues of their mammalian host. The public
health significance of the genus Acanthocheilonema
appears to be minimal, with only one case of an adult
female Acanthocheilonema reconditum reported in the
eye of a human, in Australia [13]. Fleas and lice are
intermediate hosts for A. reconditum [14]. Ticks, lice
[15,16] and, in Algeria, H. longipennis, have all been
proposed as intermediate hosts for Acanthocheilonema
dracunculoides [17]. The development of larvae in these
intermediate hosts occurs mostly in the fat-body cells
and infective larvae migrate to the mouthparts to facilitate their transmission [18,19].
Recently we reported the discovery of a canine filarial worm that was referred to erroneously as Acanthocheilonema ladakhii (currently nomen nudum), in 48%
of a dog population sampled in northern India [20].
To date very little is known about the clinical significance of this parasite except that its microfilariae may
be confused with those of D. immitis, especially by
minimally trained personnel [21], and that almost all
the dogs in this region were heavily infested with H.
longipennis [20].
The aim of this study was to report the occurrence of
the newly reported Acanthocheilonema parasite in H.
longipennis in dogs in northern India, using a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic techniques. This species of Acanthocheilonema (currently
nomen nudum) will be referred to as Acanthocheilonema
sp.? nov. throughout this manuscript.

Materials and methods
Study site and sampling

Approximately 200 adult flies belonging to the genus
Hippobosca (Figure 1) were manually removed from
dogs presented to the Street Dog Sterilisation Programme in Ladakh, India, from June to September 2008.
This collaborative program, involving the Ladakh Animal Care Society and Vets Beyond Borders, aims to stabilise the street dog population and helps to control
rabies and other canine zoonoses. The flies were deposited into screw-cap tubes and immediately fixed in 70%
ethanol.
Identification and dissection

Flies were examined using a stereomicroscope and identified morphologically according to criteria specified by
Bequaert [3]. The flies were then individually dissected;
after discarding legs and wings, each specimen was
divided into three body sections (head, thorax and abdomen). Flies were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) using curved-bladed Vannas scissors (ProSciTech,
Australia).

longipennis found infesting dogs in Ladakh, India.

All isolated nematode larvae were examined microscopically at ×200 and ×400 magnification for morphological identification with reference to an atlas for infective
larvae of filarial parasites [22]. The larvae were measured using a BH-2 microscope (Olympus, Japan) with a
calibrated eye micrometer and photographed using a
DP12 digital microscope camera (Olympus, Japan).
DNA Extraction, PCR assays and DNA sequencing

DNA extraction was performed on collected larvae using
a commercial kit (DNeasy Tissue Kit; Qiagen) and subjected to PCR for genus and species identification. A
single DNA sample of canine blood positive for microfilariae of Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. was randomly
selected from the authors’ previous study [20] and was
genetically characterised at two additional mitochondrial
genes for confirmation of species identification.
For genus-based identification of larvae, a forward primer, Mff18SF1 5’ GGA TAA CTG TGG CAA TTC
TAG 3’ was designed by aligning the sequences of the
near complete 18S rDNA of Brugia malayi [GenBank:
AF036588], Wuchereria bancrofti [GenBank: AF227234],
D. immitis [GenBank: AF036638] and Dipetalonema sp.
[GenBank: DQ531723.1] using ClustalW (http://www.
genome.jp/tools/clustalw/) and combined with reverse

primer, PAFilariaR1 [20], to amplify a 700bp PCR
product.
The PCR assay was carried out in a volume of 25 μl
containing 1 × PCR buffer (Qiagen), 2.0 mM MgCl 2 ,
200 μM of each dNTP, 0.5 μM of each of the forward
and reverse primers, 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Qiagen) and 1 μl of extracted DNA (concentration for
each DNA samples ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 ng/μL). The
PCR conditions were as follows: an initial activation step
at 94°C for 2 min was followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94°C for 30s, 60°C for 30s and 72°C for 30s) followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 7 minutes.
The larvae were subjected to PCR to amplify the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region using PCR assays
and conditions previously described by Rishniw [21].
Larvae and microfilariae were also subjected to PCR
amplification of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase - 1 (cox-1) genes. Amplifications and
sequences of 12S rDNA were generated using a primer
pair 12SF and 12SR [23]. PCR was performed in a 25 μl
final volume under the following conditions: 1× buffer
A with 1.5 mM MgCl 2 (KAPA2G™), 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 1 μM of each primer, and 0.75 U of KAPA2G™
Robust HotStart DNA Polymerase (KAPA2G™). The
thermal profile used was: 95°C 30 s followed by 95°C 30
s, 50°C 15 s, and 72°C 30 s for 35 cycles and 72°C for
60 s. The cox-1 sequences were generated using the primer pair COIintF and COIintR using conditions
described by Casiraghi and colleagues [24].
PCR products were purified using Qiagen spin columns (Qiagen) and sequenced using an ABI 3130xl
Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) with Big Dye 3.0
chemistry. The sequences were read, edited and
assembled using Finch TV (Geospiza Inc.) and BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.0.5.3.
Neighbor joining analyses were conducted with
Tamura-Nei parameter distance estimates and trees
constructed using Mega 4.1 software. Bootstrap analyses
were conducted using 1000 replicates.

Results
More than 200 flies were collected from a total of 101
dogs. From these a total of 65 flies were selected randomly and identified morphologically as H. longipennis.
Twelve nematode larvae were found in 10 out of 65 flies
dissected; 9 from the head (Figure 2), 2 from the thorax
and 1 from the abdomen. Two flies were found with
mites attached to the setae of their legs and these mites
were identified as Cheyletiella yasguri (Figure 3) according to Domrow [25].
The larvae were relatively large, with a mean total
body length of 2,900 (± 60) μm and width of 34 (± 5)
μm. Apart from being larger, all extracted larvae closely
resembled other infective larvae of the family

Nine of the 11 larvae were subjected to PCR amplification at the 18S, ITS-2 genes, 12S and cox-1 genes.
DNA sequences of all larvae displayed 100% homology
to the Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. at all four genetic
loci. The un-rooted phenogram using neighbour joining
analyses of the ITS-2, 12S and cox-1 sequences showed
100% bootstrap placement for all nine larvae sequences
with Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. into a distinct group
from A. reconditum as well as A. vitae (Figure 5, 6, 7).

Discussion
This study represents the first report of the dog louse
fly, H. longipennis, acting as a potential intermediate

host of the recently identified species of canine filarial
nematode Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov.. Both conventional parasitological and molecular methods provide
evidence of biological involvement between H. longipennis and this parasite in northern India. Despite careful
examination of different anatomical regions of the flies
during dissection, only infective larvae were observed;
this is similar to the findings of Nelson [17] who also
failed to find other developmental stages of larvae of A.
dracunculoides except for a single second stage larva
found in the abdominal cavity. Nelson suggested that
the absence of other developmental stages may have
been due to the prolonged feeding interval of the fly,

Page 4 of 7

which could allow larvae to become fully infective
before re-feeding on the host a few days later. Hafez
and Hilali [26] however demonstrated that the fly could
only withstand starvation for 12 to 36 hours before
dying and that feeding occurs more regularly than this.
It is reported that the developmental period from L1 to
infective larvae for A. reconditum in fleas and A. dracunculoides in ticks is approximately seven days and
thirteen days, respectively [16,27]. The development of
Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. within its hippoboscid host
therefore requires further investigation. Despite the fact
that we have demonstrated a potential intermediate
host-parasite relationship between H. longipennis and
Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov., determination of the vector competence for any blood-feeding arthropod should
be based on the demonstration of its capability of transmitting the parasite to a receptive host during blood
feeding using experimental trials [15,27], and this
remains to be performed.
The precise identification of this nematode remains
unclear. A proper morphological comparison of the
third-stage larvae, microfilaria and recovery and comparison of adult worms with those of the other filarial
nematodes of dogs in addition to the molecular phylogenetics would be required in order to comply with the
establishment criteria listed in Article 7 to 11 of the
Code of Zoological Nomenclature, which would allow
official classification of this Acanthocheiloma sp. nov.?
found in dogs.
Species of Hippobosca do not normally travel long distances but they are strong fliers and will actively fly
between hosts within a group [28]. When on the host,

H. longipennis moves swiftly between hairs and is very
difficult to catch (authors’ personal observation). It is
known that on average the female leaves the host for
larviposition (on the soil, in crevices or in cracks of tree
barks) about 8 times throughout her lifetime, on each
occasion she returns to the host to feed and start
another larval maturation cycle [26]. Hafez and Hilali
[26] stated that the amount of complete blood meal
ingested by H. longipennis varies from 1.5 to 4.5 mg
with a feeding duration of 3 to 13 minutes and meals
are taken at least every 6 hours. This information highlights the significance of this fly as important blood
sucking ectoparasite, hence increasing the opportunity
for it to be an effective disseminator of blood parasites
among dogs.
The subfamilies Lipopteninae, and Ornithomyiinae are
known biological vectors for Trypanosoma and Haemoproteus of birds, sheep and goat [2]. The subfamily Hippoboscinae has been documented only as a vector for A.
dracunculoides in dogs [17]. More recently, over 70% of
Hippobosca equina were positive for Bartonella DNA
[29], but further investigation is needed to clarify biological or mechanical involvement of the fly as a vector
for this pathogen. To the authors’ knowledge, there are
no other reports exploring the role of the genus Hippobosca as a vector/intermediate host for any other pathogen. Indeed, it is surprising how little information is
known about the capability of the subfamily Hippoboscinae as vectors of pathogens. Further investigations are
crucial to reduce this knowledge gap.
Despite being commonly encountered in semi-arid
regions of Africa and Asia, there is no peer-reviewed
information available on the efficacy of ectoparasitic
drugs against H. longipennis on dogs. Staff at several
zoos in United States applied methoxychlor, malathion
and carbaryl-sulfur dust formulations to the animals and
their surroundings to control and eradicate H. longipennis infestations [7,8]. In addition to its role as an intermediate host for canine filariae, our findings have also
confirmed earlier reports that C. yasguri mites are
phoretic on H. longipennis [30,31] and that the fly may
play an important role in mechanically disseminating
this mite among dogs. The fly’s potential to cause heavy
infections of dogs with accompanying anaemia and/or
skin lesions, signals a need for further studies to determine the efficacy of currently available insecticides
against H. longipennis.
With respect to the public health significance of this
epifaunistic ectoparasite, it is known that humans are
occasionally bitten by flies from the family Hippoboscidae [3], but it is of note that the authors did not receive
any bites from H. longipennis during the collection process. Apart from mechanical irritation and injury, the fly
may also facilitate the zoonotic transmission of C.

Page 6 of 7

yasguri [32]. It has also been hypothesised that H. longipennis may act as a mechanical vector for Leishmania
spp. in areas where the parasite is endemic in dogs [8].
Furthermore, H. equina (forest fly) and Lipoptena cervi
(deer ked), other blood-sucking species belonging to the
family Hippoboscidae, have been reported feeding on
[33] and causing anaphylactic reactions in humans in
Finland [34] and Hungary [35] and this may also be a
possibility with H. longipennis. In summary, to date, this
fly appears to have minimal public health significance,
but further investigation is needed to verify this.

Conclusion
This study confirmed biological involvement of H. longipennis for Acanthocheilonema sp.? nov. in northern
India and its role as an intermediate host is proposed.
Further investigations are essential to prove whether
this fly is a competent vector for Acanthocheilonema
sp.? nov.. Furthermore, future research needs to be conducted to investigate whether H. longipennis is capable
of propagating and transmitting other vector-borne and
zoonotic pathogens.
