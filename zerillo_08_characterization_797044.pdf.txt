Abstract
Background: Leifsonia xyli is a xylem-inhabiting bacterial species comprised of two subspecies: L. xyli
subsp. xyli (Lxx) and L. xyli subsp. cynodontis (Lxc). Lxx is the causal agent of ratoon stunting disease in
sugarcane commercial fields and Lxc colonizes the xylem of several grasses causing either mild or no
symptoms of disease. The completely sequenced genome of Lxx provided insights into its biology and
pathogenicity. Since IS elements are largely reported as an important source of bacterial genome
diversification and nothing is known about their role in chromosome architecture of L. xyli, a comparative
analysis of Lxc and Lxx elements was performed.
Results: Sample sequencing of Lxc genome and comparative analysis with Lxx complete DNA sequence
revealed a variable number of IS transposable elements acting upon genomic diversity. A detailed
characterization of Lxc IS elements and a comparative review with IS elements of Lxx are presented. Each
genome showed a unique set of elements although related to same IS families when considering features
such as similarity among transposases, inverted and direct repeats, and element size. Most of the Lxc and
Lxx IS families assigned were reported to maintain transposition at low levels using translation regulatory
mechanisms, consistent with our in silico analysis. Some of the IS elements were found associated with
rearrangements and specific regions of each genome. Differences were also found in the effect of IS
elements upon insertion, although none of the elements were preferentially associated with gene
disruption. A survey of transposases among genomes of Actinobacteria showed no correlation between
phylogenetic relatedness and distribution of IS families. By using Southern hybridization, we suggested that
diversification of Lxc isolates is also mediated by insertion sequences in probably recent events.
Conclusion: Collectively our data indicate that transposable elements are involved in genome
diversification of Lxc and Lxx. The IS elements were probably acquired after the divergence of the two
subspecies and are associated with genome organization and gene contents. In addition to enhancing
understanding of IS element dynamics in general, these data will contribute to our ongoing comparative
analyses aimed at understanding the biological differences of the Lxc and Lxx.

Background
The Gram-positive, coryneform, fastidious, xylem-inhabiting bacteria Leifsonia xyli comprises two subspecies: L.
xyli subsp. xyli (Lxx) and L. xyli subsp. cynodontis (Lxc). In
its unique natural host, Lxx causes ratoon-stunting disease, a malady that affects sugarcane commercial fields
worldwide, promoting losses of up to 30% in susceptible
varieties [1]. Sequencing of the Lxx genome has provided
important insights into the biology and pathogenicity of
this bacterium [2]. Lxc is an endophyte of Bermuda grass
(Cynodo dactylon) and, when artificially inoculated, can
grow in and colonize the xylem of agriculturally important grasses (including sugarcane, corn and rice), causing
no (or mild) symptoms of disease [3,4]. Some studies suggested that Lxc may be a potential vector for expressing
heterologous proteins in plants [5-10,4]. We have initiated a genome-based approach to compare Lxc and Lxx by
sample sequencing the Lxc genome. Our goal is to comprehensively assess gene content and genomic organization of these two closely related bacteria to enhance
understanding of the differences in their pathogenicity
and host range. Here, we present the in silico characterization of insertion sequence (IS) elements, the most abundant type of mobile genetic element found in L. xyli [2]
and their involvement in Lxc and Lxx genome diversification.
IS elements are small transposable DNA fragments ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 kbp, comprising a transposase-encoding gene and terminal inverted repeats (IR) [11]. Close to
1,500 different IS elements have been reported in the
chromosomes and plasmids of nearly all bacteria studied
[12]. IS elements may inactivate genes upon insertion or
activate and/or enhance the expression of nearby genes.
Some are known to recognize specific sites of the genome
that are duplicated after IS insertion, resulting in direct
repeats (DR). IS elements may provide the structural basis
necessary to enable the rearrangement of genomic fragments and the incorporation of foreign DNA either by
active transposition process or indirectly, mediating
homologous recombination between multiple copies
present in a given genome [13]. They are believed to
undergo frequent horizontal transfer and cycles of expansion and extinction within a given species, most likely as
a consequence of transfer between genomes and plasmids
[14]. Their expansion, genome location and composition
may differ among related bacteria, representing an important source of genomic diversity [15-20,12]. Because its
effects have a direct impact on cell survival, control of
transposition is tightly regulated. Intrinsic regulation is
basically at the transcriptional and translational level
[21]. In addition, several host proteins have been identified as part of the transpososome, the assembly of which
may be controlled by host factors, thus integrating transposition activity and host physiology [22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/127

Previously, 50 copies of five distinct IS elements
(ISLxx1–5) in the Lxx genome were reported, along with
47 other transposase-related genes from uncharacterized
elements [2,23]. In Lxc, three IS elements have previously
been identified: IS1237 [24], ISLxc1 and ISLxc2 [25],
located both on the chromosome and on the cryptic plasmid pCXC100 that is present in some isolates. A detailed
characterization of two new Lxc IS elements (ISLxc3 and
ISLxc4) and one new Lxx element (ISLxx6) is presented, as
well as a comparative review of all elements found in both
genomes, their distribution among families [11], and
their comparative localization. The results support the
hypothesis that IS elements are components involved in
the diversification of Lxx and Lxc, with their influence
most likely occurring after the divergence of the two subspecies from their common ancestor.

Results
The dataset of Lxc genomic DNA
The characterization of the IS elements were realized
within the dataset of Lxc DSMZ46306 genomic DNA. The
dataset is comprised of 9,766 reads, of which 5,854 were
derived from the shotgun library and 3,912 from sequencing BAC ends, sub-cloning of inserts and primer-walking.
All sequences were assembled into 1,064 contigs accounting for 1,368,731 non-redundant bases, representing
approximately 50% of the Lxc chromosome. Comparing
all the sequences of Lxc with the complete genome of Lxx,
we found that nearly 70% share more than 80% nucleotide sequence identity considering a continuous segment
of at least 200 bases. Two other genomes of related subspecies Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and
C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus that were recently
sequenced [26,27] have nearly 80% of nucleotide identity
using the same criteria. These figures were derived from
the Artemis Comparative Tool [28].
Lxc and Lxx each have their own set of IS elements
Among all the contigs, 70 shared sequence similarity to
transposase-encoding genes. Fifty-six of these represented
copies of five distinct IS elements that were characterized
based on the criteria proposed (Table 1). The remaining
14 contigs correspond to uncharacterized IS elements,
since no IR, site of insertion and structural limits were
identified within the available sequences. They were classified only tentatively based on homology searches with
Lxx genome, and were placed within IS families (Table 2):
IS3 family (eleven elements); IS256 family (two elements); and IS481 family (one element). Elements of the
same families were not characterized in Lxx as well [2,23].
These uncharacterized transposases may represent degenerated forms of old insertions, however they may also be
used as site for rearrangements within Lxc genome.

The transposases of characterized IS elements shared less
than 78% amino acid sequence identity with transposases
of Lxx elements (Additional file 1). To be considered as
iso-forms, transposases of a given element must share
more than 95% identical amino acids [11]; therefore, Lxc
and Lxx have different sets of IS elements. Despite of that,
most of the elements found belong to the same families
(Table 2), with the exception of IS110 (ISLxx2), which was
not identified in our Lxc dataset.
Description of Lxc IS elements and comparison with
related elements in Lxx
In addition to the three IS elements previously sequenced
for Lxc: IS1237 (GenBank ID: X75973); ISLxc1 (GenBank
ID: EF437436); and ISLxc2 (GenBank ID: EF176596), we
identified two new elements, named ISLxc3 (GenBank ID:
EF421582) and ISLxc4 (GenBank ID: EF433175) (Table 1,
Fig. 1 and Additional file 2). A detailed characterization of
all these Lxc-IS elements, and a comparison with related
elements in Lxx, is presented below.
IS1237 and ISLxx6, IS5 family members
IS1237 was first identified in the plasmid pCXC100
detected in some Lxc isolates [24]. Recently, 13 upstream
and 10 downstream flanking sequences of IS1237 were
described [25]. We identified 26 copies of IS1237 (Additional files 3 and 4) represented by two variant forms: 24
copies were 899-bp long and almost identical, with a single polymorphism in the 3'-IR; two copies were 798 bp
long (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Four copies were inserted within
other IS elements: one inserted within ISLxc1 and three
inserted within copies of ISLxc2. There was no readthrough ORF encoding an entire transposase within
IS1237 [24]. If functional, the coding sequence, starting
and ending at nucleotide positions 232 and 889, respectively, would have to change frame (-1) and overcome a
premature stop codon (Additional file 2). Since the coding sequence of all 899-bp long copies sequenced so far
were identical, it is reasonable to assume that such trans-

lational features could be involved in the negative control
of transposition [21]. The putative transposase has the
expected catalytic domain containing a DDE motif [25],
but the number of amino acids separating these residues
does not follow the pattern of the IS5 family, and the
glutamic acid is located downstream of the premature
stop codon. Analyzing Lxx genome sequence, we identified ISLxx6, a single copy of which is represented within
the genomic island LxxGI3 [2]. In Lxx, LxxGI3, is a depository of IS elements encompassing seventeen putative
transposase genes [2,23]. ISLxx6 shows the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with an Lxc-IS element, the 899
bp-long IS1237 (Additional file 1). Interestingly, however, contrary to IS1237, the ISLxx6 putative transposase
gene (Lxx22320.1) is read-through (Additional file 5).
Both elements were classified as belonging to group IS427
within IS5 family based on multiple alignment using
Tribe-MCl (Patricia Siguier, personal communication).
However, they share conserved amino acids with elements
of group IS1031 (Additional file 5). In addition, ISLxx6
presents a single ORF and recognize three nucleotides as
site of insertion, also common features of elements of
IS1031 group. This may indicate the existence of another
group within IS5 family.
ISLxc1, an IS21 family member
ISLxc1 [25] encompasses two ORFs similar to the IstA and
IstB transposases found in elements of the IS21 family
[11]. In our Lxc dataset, we identified one copy of ISLxc1,
which was invaded by an IS1237 element. The IS1237
insertion is located 58 bp upstream of the first ORF (istA)
(figure 1) and has duplicated the "TAA" site of insertion
within ISLxc1 (Additional file 2). A second version of
ISLxc1 not carrying a copy of IS1237 was amplified in
DSMZ46306 with inwardly oriented primers complementary to the 5' and 3' IRs. However this element was not
mapped on Lxx genome because we did not have the
flanking sequences. ISLxc1 is 2,631 bp long and 99%
identical to that previously sequenced [25]. Within both

versions istA is truncated and the DDE motif was not identified, therefore istA disruption was prior to the IS1237
insertion. istB may encode a 262-amino-acid protein containing the predicted nucleoside triphosphate-binding
domain. It is preceded by a purine reach site, which in
other elements is an indicative of ribosome frameshifting
and coupled translation of IstA and IstB [11] (Fig. 1 and
additional file 2).
ISLxc2, an IS481 family member
ISLxc2 is a 1,105-bp-long element (Table 1 and Fig. 1)
[25]. The 16 copies identified here all contain at least one
nucleotide polymorphism in different positions, none of
which located in crucial sites such as start and stop codons
or the DDE motif. The putative transposase contains 332
amino acids and is interrupted by an in-frame stop-codon
located 111 nucleotides downstream of the initiation
codon (Additional file 2). Interestingly, the transposases
of ISLxc2 and also ISLxx4 of Lxx genome [2] have stop
codons within the host insertion site. The NCTAGN
sequence is duplicated after element insertion and flanks
both ends indicating that the translational end of the
transposase may impose the structural limits on these elements, as described for other elements of the same family
[29,30].

Three copies of ISLxc2 were invaded by IS1237, in all the
cases the insertion was located 13 bp upstream of the
putative transposase gene, duplicating the TTA site of recognition. Generally, genes invaded by IS elements
become non-functional, but the IS1237 insertions were all
at the same position within ISLxc2, located upstream of
the transposase gene (Fig. 1). IS elements located
upstream of the coding region may create a hybrid promoter between the IS element sequence and the gene and
favor transcription of the later, which in this case is ISLxc2

[11,21]. However, this should be addressed experimentally.
ISLxc3 and ISLxc4, IS30 family members
Two novel elements were identified: ISLxc3 and ISLxc4
(Table 1, Fig. 1 and Additional file 2). Eight copies of
ISLxc3 were found, six of which being 1,511 bp long, and
two copies with 3' end deletions at different positions.
One of these defective variants (occurrence number 8 –
additional file 3) is associated with a reorganization event
in Lxc compared to Lxx because one of the flanking
regions is common to Lxx and the other one is specific to
Lxc. This is an example showing that an IS element may
serve as a subject for homologous recombination, independent of its integrity. An imperfect IR of ISLxc3 was
defined as a twenty-six bp long sequence starting with
three non-complemented nucleotides, "CTT", at the 5'end and "GCC" at the 3'-end, which were also detected for
ISLxx5 [2]. The proposed IRs were based on the experimentally proved structural limits of IS1655, an IS30 family element of Neisseria meningitides [31]. In fact, the first
nine nucleotides of 3'-IR are conserved among IS1655,
ISLxc3 and ISLxx5. We failed in detect a conserved target
site for insertion in multiple alignment considering 20
bases upstream and downstream of the element limits,
but the duplication of NTG sequence was detected flanking two copies of ISLxc3. The putative transposase was the
only one described in Lxc that was not interrupted by a
premature stop codon or by a purine repeat associated
with a frameshift.

ISLxc4 was found in five copies represented by two variant
forms. Two copies represented longer versions (1,311 bp)
and the other three copies (896 bp) showed the same
deletion within the core region, which were considered
shorter versions of the ISLxc4 (ISLxc4d1 – GeneBank ID:
EF494674). The IRs are twenty-eight bp long, and no DR

was identified flanking the occurrences. Regardless of
been unusual for IS30 family elements, the long version
contain a cluster of purines (nucleotide position
431–437), resembling a slippery codon for the frameshift
(Additional file 2). Transposases of the IS30 family
encompass the helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding
domain at the N-terminal part and the well-conserved D(54–61 aa)-D-(33 aa)-E motif at the C-terminal part
[30,32]. In ISLxc4, if the +1 frameshift does occur, the
transposase (OrfAB) is 380 amino acids long and contains
two domains. If the frameshift does not occur, the transposase (OrfA) is 115 amino acids long, carrying only the
DNA-binding domain. Truncated transposases with only
the DNA-binding domain may function as negative regulators of transposition when interacting with IRs, resulting
in either repression of the transposase gene promoter or
competition with full-length transposases [33,21]. Neither the DNA-binding domain nor DDE motif following
the rule above were detected within the ORF of the shorter
variant.
Analysis of IS element loci in the Lxc and Lxx genomes
The average nucleotide sequence identity between homologous fragments of Lxc and Lxx is 93%, as calculated on
80 kbp of 25 continuous Lxc-contigs, which were physically linked based on scaffold orientation. Comparing the
adjacent regions of all 56 Lxc-IS element with the Lxx
sequence, 44 elements could be mapped onto the Lxx
genome (Additional file 3). All the flanking sequences of
IS elements were submitted to GenBank and the accession
number is available in the additional file 3. Four of these
(occurrences 8, 14, 15 and 38, additional file 3), which are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/127

three copies of ISLxc2 and one copy of ISLxc3, have only
one of the adjacent sequences homologous to the Lxx
genome. The other end is specific to Lxc genome, indicating an association with genomic rearrangements.
Although some IS elements of both genomes belong to
the same families and may recognize the same target site
for insertion, none of the Lxc-IS insertion loci were the
same as for elements found in the Lxx genome (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 3). The 12 remaining Lxc-elements were
inserted in specific regions of its chromosome (Additional
file 4).
IS elements were randomly distributed throughout Lxx
genome (Fig. 2), 25% of all insertions were located in
what has been described as genomic islands [2,23], in particular within genomic island LxxGI3. Comparatively the
distribution of the elements in Lxc also seems to be random; however our approach so far does not allow us to
make the same inferences about islands in Lxc genome.
To assess the impact of IS elements in gene disruption,
they were classified into three categories: IS insertions
within predicted genes; insertions in non-coding
sequences; and insertions in non-coding sequences, but
with one or two truncated genes nearby (less than 100
nucleotides distant) (Fig. 3). Truncated genes were
defined as those ORFs that have a disrupted coding
sequence based on BlastX results. Most of the elements
were found inserted within intergenic regions for both
genomes. In the Lxx genome, disrupted genes were associated mainly with degradation of polysaccharides, transport and regulatory functions, while in the Lxc genome

ISLxc2, ISLxc3, IS1237 and ISLxc4, respectively. No DRs
were detected within Lxx orthologous that could be an
indicative of a prior invasion and excision event. Therefore is more likely that these genes were truncated prior to
the IS elements insertion in Lxc.
Distribution of L. xyli-IS-related elements throughout
Actinobacteria
According to the ISfinder database, elements of the IS5
family are common in both Archaea and Eubacteria [12].
Considering all IS families found in Leifsonia xyli, examining ISfinder submission reports and using sequence similarity searches, we found that IS5 elements were the least
represented in the sequenced genomes of Actinobacteria,
despite being the most highly represented IS element in
the Lxc genome. As observed in L. xyli genomes, transposases from the IS30 and IS481 families are abundant in
most Actinobacteria (Fig. 4). Each putative transposase of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/127

characterized IS elements of Leifsonia xyli genomes was
used as query and compared to transposases of Actinobacteria genomes, and the best BlastX hit result was considered. Most of the transposases shared around 70% of
amino acid identity. The exception was IS1237, which
related elements of Actinobacteria genomes did not share
more than 50% identical amino acids. Actinobacteria is
one of the largest taxonomic units in terms of number and
variety of species [34] and members of IS elements of
most characterized families are represented within this
group [12]. As probably expected no correlation was
found between phylogenetic relatedness and IS family distribution in Actinobacteria genomes (Fig. 4). Not even
among subspecies of Leifsonia xyli and Clavibacter michiganensis, which are much related to each other. This observation is in concert with the cycles of expansion and
extinction of IS elements proposed before [14].
Distribution of IS elements in Lxc isolates
To further examine the distribution of IS elements
between genomic DNA of two isolates of Lxc to check the
involvement of these elements in diversification of
strains, hybridization experiments were performed using
fragments of three IS elements of different families as
probes. There are two BamHI sites within IS1237, one
within ISLxc4, and none within ISLxc2. There are no sites
for PstI, EcoRV or EcoRI within these elements. IS1237 is
the only element showing the same hybridization pattern
between the two isolates for all tested enzymes (Fig. 5).
However, variable DNA band patterns were detected for
ISLxc2 and ISLxc4 (Fig. 5). We believe that partial digestions can not justify such differences because the same
stripped membrane was used in each experiment, and we
do not see partials in the assay with IS1237. Also, polymorphism at the enzymes restriction site could not
explain the differences since they were found for all
enzymes used when probed with ISLxc2 and ISLxc4, and
they were not detected for IS1237, mainly considering the
abundance of the later in Lxc genome. Finally, we assume
that these differences were probably not the result of
large-scale rearrangements; otherwise they would also
have been detected in the distribution of IS1237. It is
plausible to assume that the observed variation may result
from homologous recombination between copies of these
elements not interspersed by IS1237 copies, or that it may
be associated with the presence of a variable number of
elements, as a result of transposition of ISLxc2 and ISLxc4
to new locations. To assure any of these two hypotheses
the bands should be isolated and the DNA sequenced. In
any case, the difference exists and is probably originating
diversification in the isolates of Lxc genomes. Consistent
with this are the data generated by Young and collaborators where isolates of Lxc showed different band pattern in
DNA fingerprinting [35].

Discussion
Sequencing of approximately 50% of the Lxc genome
identified 56 copies of five distinct IS elements, establishing that the Lxc chromosome contains a larger number of
IS copies than the Lxx genome [2]. The IS elements of Lxc
were subjected to a careful analysis and compared to the
elements of Lxx and other Actinobacterial genomes, in an

attempt to understand their contribution to the genome
diversification of the two L. xyli subspecies. Also, taking
into account that genome projects usually fail in a
detailed characterization of these elements, we reviewed
all the elements in both Lxc and Lxx genomes.

Figure 5
Southern hybridization of digested DNA of two Lxc isolates
Southern hybridization of digested DNA of two Lxc isolates. The isolates used were (1) DSMZ46306 and (2) SB with
probes (a) IS1237, (b) ISLxc2 and (c) ISLxc4. The DNA molecular marker used was a 1kb ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Apart from sharing the same IS families, there were no isoforms in common between the Lxc and Lxx and the locations of insertions were distinct to each genome. Analysis
of the impact of IS insertions revealed that, in both subspecies, most elements were inserted within intergenic
regions. The higher percentage of this kind of insertion in
Lxx (78%) as compared to the Lxc genome (53%) is probably due to the Lxx-genome decay process, since a higher
percentage of genes were already non-functional, as previously proposed [2]. Insertions within genes or intergenic
regions were independent of IS family assignment for
both subspecies. The Lxc and Lxx genome comparative
arrangement was assessed by mapping the flanking
sequences of each Lxc-IS element in the complete Lxx
sequence; some elements were associated with DNA rearrangements and others were inserted into specific fragments of the Lxc genome.

of nucleotide identity with IS1237, the transposase of
ISLxx6 appears to be intact. One would probably expect a
larger expansion of it within Lxx genome, but somehow
its transposition may be controlled by mechanisms other
than that regulated at translational level. This is probably
an interesting model to be further analyzed. IS elements
are very often plasmid-borne, and transfer events between
genomes and plasmids are common [12], which may be
the case of IS1237, first described in the cryptic plasmid
pCXC100 present in some of the Lxc isolates [24]. The
extended survey of all Lxc and Lxx-IS elements among
Actinobacteria genomes showed no correlation between
phylogenetic relatedness and distribution of IS families,
which is probably in agreement with the hypothesis that
genomes undergo repetitive extinction-reinfection cycles
of different IS elements throughout bacterial evolution
[14].

IS1237 is an unique element, with some similarity to elements of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (NP_624431), S.
avermitilis MA-4680 (NP_821293) and Frankia sp. CcI3
(YP_481128). An expansion of it was detected in the Lxc
chromosome, whereas elements of the IS5 family were the
least represented in Actinobacteria. Particularly intriguing
is the presence of a single copy of an IS1237-related element within Lxx genome, the ISLxx6. Despite sharing 85%

Most of the IS families assigned in L. xyli were characterized by maintaining transposition at low levels using
mechanisms, such as regulation at the translational level
[21], i.e., transposition occurs only when translation overcomes features of the sequences such as sites for ribosomal slippage and premature termination codons. So far,
copies of Lxc and Lxx elements sequenced within each
genome have proved almost identical, therefore, we have

Page 9 of 13

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:127

assumed that these features are part of the mechanism to
regulate transposition, rather than being indicative of
defective IS elements [21].
To assess the involvement of L. xyli IS elements carrying
these types of transposases in promoting genome reorganization, the distribution of three IS elements of different
families was analyzed in two strains of Lxc. The observed
band polymorphism raised the hypothesis that ISLxc2 and
ISLxc4 are involved in diversification, either by being
active in transposition or by promoting homologous
recombination. Variation was not observed for IS1237
hybridization, supporting previous experimental data
where mobilization in vitro was not achieved [25]. Conversely, the elevated number of identical copies within the
Lxc chromosome, the identical positioning in different
isolates, and insertions within other elements suggest
recent expansion of IS1237.
Transposon activity is regarded as an important source of
bacterial diversity not only in promoting gene inactivation and genome reorganization but also in acquisition of
new sequences [12]. Consequently, there must be some
equilibrium between the impact of those events in successful maintenance of the element and host viability.
How the differential expansion happens even among
close related species and strains remains to be fully understood.

Conclusion
The impact of IS elements on genomic organization and
gene content among closely related species has previously
been described [16,17], and our data further support such
analyses. Although the approach used to sequence the
genome of Lxc was limited, an extensive study using the
data gathered was sufficient to show that the genomic
diversification of Lxc and Lxx is also and perhaps primarily
associated with the presence of distinct types of IS elements. In addition to that, we have made a detailed characterization of IS elements present in each genome, which
is often missing in analysis of fully sequenced genomes.
The set of IS elements being unique to each genome, their
specific location in combination with rearrangements and
horizontal gene transfer are probably the major forces of
genome evolution in Leifsonia xyli and consequently
should have an impact on its biology. The same is probably true for isolates of Lxc as determined by our hybridization experiments. Our study also provided information in
concert with the concept that distribution of IS elements
in a given genome happens in evolutionary recent events
due to cycles of expansion and extinction.
These data will probably contribute to our ongoing comparative analyses aimed at understanding the biological
differences of the Lxc and Lxx genomes.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The bacterial strains used were: Lxx CTCB07
(NC_006087) [2] (Brazil); Lxc DSMZ46306 (Taiwan);
and Lxc SB (Australia). The DSMZ46306 strain was grown
in a MSC New modified liquid medium [3,2] at 28°C for
5–10 days, under agitation at 300 rpm. The SB genomic
DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Brumbley
(Bureau of Sugar Experiment Station/Queensland, Australia).
Genomic library construction, DNA sequencing and
assembly
Two DSMZ46306 genomic libraries were prepared.
Genomic DNA extracted as previously described [2] was
mechanically sheared and the resulting fragments cloned
into pUC19 (Q-Biogene, Carlsbad, CA). A BAC clone
library was prepared with 25 kbp-inserts obtained by partial digestion with BamHI [36] cloned into pIndigoBAC-5
(Epicentre®). Both ends of each insert were sequenced
using an automated sequencer (model 3700, ABI Prism,
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Results were analyzed by ABI sequencing analysis software, and assembled
using the phred/Phrap/consed package [37,38]. All consensus sequences were generated with phred quality ≥ 20.
Characterization of IS elements
Inserts containing end-sequences similar to transposases
were subcloned or primer-walked. Homology searches
were performed using BlastN and BlastX [39] at GenBank
[40] and IS finder [41]. Identities were considered significant only when the E-value was less than 10-05. Positive
matches for transposase/integrase were manually verified
to determine the presence of the following determinants
of a given family: element size; presence of terminal
inverted repeats (IR) and conserved terminal based pairs;
target site of insertion and number of bases associated to
direct repeats (DR); number of ORFs; distance among
amino acids of DDE; as well as comparisons with related
elements [11]. We also analyzed the presence of variants,
domains, frameshifts and premature stop codons.

Transposases sharing more than 95% of amino acid identity were grouped. Their nucleotide sequences in addition
to 300 bases up and downstream were aligned using ClustalW [42]. For each cluster of sequences, the first sixty
bases of the 5'-end was aligned with the reverse complement of the first sixty bases of the 3'-end. Best matches
were considered as IR candidates and compared to IRs of
other characterized IS elements. IRs were selected when
the minimum number of non complemented nucleotides
followed the pattern of a given family. In an attempt to
identify the target sites of insertion and the DR, an alignment of up to 20 bases flanking each IS element was done
and the sequence was compared to the already described

target sites of other IS elements. Features such as stop
codon in frame and purine rich sites related to ribosome
frameshift were sought in ORFs whose alignment partially
matches transposases, based on BlastX results. Domains
were identified within the Blast results at the CDD database [40]. DDE motifs were identified following IS finder
pattern [41]. Minimal numbers of occurrences were determined based on flanking sequences.

Southern blot hybridization
Lxc genomic DNA (1 μg; DSMZ46306 and SB) was
digested completely with PstI, EcoRI, BamHI and EcoRV.
Fragments were separated in a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and
transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Probe labeling, hybridization and detection
were performed with an ECL kit (Amersham) according to
the manufacturer's guidelines and under high stringency
conditions. Inserts of shotgun clones containing the entire
fragments of three Lxc-IS elements (IS1237, ISLxc2 and
ISLxc4) were amplified and used as probes. The same
membrane was stripped and re-used according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.
