Abstract
Background: Anopheles gambiae is the primary mosquito vector of human malaria parasites in sub-Saharan Africa.
To date, three innate immune signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent Toll and
immune deficient (IMD) pathways and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-STAT)
pathway, have been extensively characterized in An. gambiae. However, in addition to NF-kappaB-dependent
signaling, three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulated by JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK are critical
mediators of innate immunity in other invertebrates and in mammals. Our understanding of the roles of the MAPK
signaling cascades in anopheline innate immunity is limited, so identification of the encoded complement of these
proteins, their upstream activators, and phosphorylation profiles in response to relevant immune signals was
warranted.
Results: In this study, we present the orthologs and phylogeny of 17 An. gambiae MAPKs, two of which were
previously unknown and two others that were incompletely annotated. We also provide detailed temporal
activation profiles for ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in An. gambiae cells in vitro to immune signals that are relevant to
malaria parasite infection (human insulin, human transforming growth factor-beta1, hydrogen peroxide) and to
bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These activation profiles and possible upstream regulatory pathways are interpreted in
light of known MAPK signaling cascades.
Conclusions: The establishment of a MAPK “road map” based on the most advanced mosquito genome
annotation can accelerate our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and broader physiology of An. gambiae
and other mosquito species. Further, future efforts to develop predictive models of anopheline cell signaling
responses, based on iterative construction and refinement of data-based and literature-based knowledge of the
MAP kinase cascades and other networked pathways will facilitate identification of the “master signaling regulators”
in biomedically important mosquito species.

Background
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serinethreonine protein kinases that regulate a variety of cellular processes, including growth, metabolism, apoptosis,
and innate immune responses [1-3]. MAPKs function in

multi-tiered signaling cascades, in which an activated
MAP4K phosphorylates and activates a MAP3K which,
in turn, activates a downstream MAP2K, which activates
a MAPK that can regulate effector proteins or transcription factors to positively or negatively regulate suites of
genes [4,5]. MAPK signaling modules provide multiple
levels of regulation that confer signal amplification and
specificity toward a desired outcome [4]. A wide assortment of stimuli activate MAPKs, including inflammatory

cytokines [6], osmotic stress [7], oxidative stress and
redox signaling [8], and growth factors [9,10].
MAPKs have been extensively studied and a wealth of
information is available from many model systems,
including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and a variety of mammals [11-13]. From an evolutionary standpoint, MAPKs have diverged very little
over time and several published phylogenies of MAPKs
have revealed a high degree of conservation from invertebrates to vertebrates [14,15]. Further, these analyses
have contributed to our understanding of the evolution
and function of the MAPKs [14,15]. For example, a
MAPK phylogeny was constructed from the encoded
sequences in the genome of the human pathogenic
blood fluke, Schistosoma japonicum, together with
known eukaryotic MAPKs from model organisms to
elucidate putative functions of previously undescribed S.
japonicum MAPKs [16]. The construction of MAPK
phylogenies can, therefore, facilitate predictions of the
roles of MAPKs in non-model organisms, including
those of public health importance.
Malaria is a parasitic disease of great public health
concern, with over 250 million new cases per year,
resulting in nearly one million deaths annually [17]. In
sub-Saharan Africa, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae
transmits the most deadly human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Despite highly efficient transmission, the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts of malaria
parasites can mount sophisticated immune responses to
infection. These responses are regulated in both hosts,
in part, by MAPKs [9,18-20].
Two prominent parasite-derived signals - glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and hemozoin - activate MAPK
signaling in both the mammalian and mosquito hosts.
Mammalian JNK, ERK and p38 MAPKs transduce signals from P. falciparum glycophosphatidylinositols
(PfGPIs) for inflammatory cytokine synthesis in immune
cells in vitro and during parasite infection in vivo
[18,19]. Hemozoin signals principally through ERK to
increase interferon-gamma-dependent production of
anti-parasite nitric oxide (NO) in mammalian cells
[21,22]. In an analogous fashion, PfGPIs function as an
early signal of parasite infection in An. gambiae [23]
and in Anopheles stephensi [24], a vector of malaria in
Asia and close relative of An. gambiae. In An. stephensi,
PfGPIs robustly activate MEK-ERK phosphorylation in
the mosquito midgut epithelium [24], a site that is critical for parasite development in the insect host. As in
mammalian cells, hemozoin can activate MEK-ERK signaling in the An. stephensi midgut [25]. Further, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-dependent MEKERK-dependent signaling can facilitate P. falciparum
development at the midgut epithelium by inhibiting the
expression of NO synthase [9] and synthesis of

inflammatory levels of reactive nitrogen oxides that limit
parasite development [26-28].
In contrast to our understanding of ERK signaling in
An. stephensi and An. gambiae, our knowledge of the
regulatory ligands and signaling pathways as well as the
biological impacts of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling in
these species is more limited. In particular, JNK activation appears to mediate as yet unidentified inhibitory
responses to the murine parasite Plasmodium berghei in
An. gambiae [29], although the extracellular signals and
upstream regulatory proteins for JNK activation are
unknown. In the case of p38 MAPK, this signaling protein appears to regulate antimicrobial responses in
Aedes mosquitoes [30-32] and p38 MAPK is activated
during insulin-dependent immune signaling in An. stephensi [20]. However, the pathway elements that regulate this signaling, the biological effects of signaling, and
the identity of other activating ligands in Anopheles
spp., including those derived from malaria parasites [25],
are unknown.
In this study, we used bioinformatics, existing knowledge of mammalian signaling pathways, and signaling
assays in An. gambiae cells to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the likely roles of the MAPK
cascades in innate immunity of An. gambiae, a critical
malaria vector mosquito for which an annotated genome
sequence is available [33]. The MAPK phylogeny presented here recapitulates the conservation of the
MAPKs and, for the first time, identifies the orthologous
associations and evolutionary origins of the complete
suite of An. gambiae MAPKs. The functional data presented herein demonstrate differing roles for An. gambiae p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK in response to stimuli
that are biologically relevant for malaria parasite infection and, together with existing knowledge from mammalian models, suggest that anopheline mosquitoes
utilize a unique MAPK architecture for signaling.

Methods
MAPK identification

The initial set of 43 human MAPKs used for reference
in this study was identified in the GeneCards database
[34] (Additional File 1). Fifteen An. gambiae MAPK
orthologs were identified in GeneCards and confirmed
using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [35]
against An. gambiae genome sequence data. In addition,
An. gambiae sequence data were analyzed using highly
conserved, orthologous MAPK activation loop
sequences. The activation of MAP kinases occurs by a
dual phosphorylation event by the upstream kinase on a
solvent-exposed activation loop that typically contains a
T-X-Y motif [36,37]. We used the encoded activation
loop sequences from D. melanogaster Slipper
(KTLKITDFGLAREAGTYAWMPPEVISV) and D.

treated with 1.7 μM human insulin and collected at 1 h,
3 h, 6 h and 24 h for qPCR (see below). Controls for
each time point consisted of an identical aliquot of cells
treated with diluent. At least three biological replicates
were performed for each treatment.
Protein extraction and western blotting

Phylogenetic analysis

For phylogenetic analyses, 108 sequences, ranging from
115-354 amino acids, of MAPK catalytic domains from
An. gambiae, C. elegans, Ciona intestinalis, D. melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
used to generate an alignment using the BLOSUM protein weight matrix and ClustalX [38]. Orthologs of C.
elegans, D. melanogaster and C. intestinalis MAPKs
were confirmed using BLASTP of GeneCards, Ensemble
Metazoa, Wormbase and Flybase databases. Phylogenetic
analyses were conducted using Phylogeny Inference
Package (PHYLIP) 3.69 [39]. PROTDIST was used to
generate a distance matrix based on the Jones-TaylorThornton (JTT) model of amino acid substitution. A
distance-based phylogenetic tree was then inferred using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm implemented in
NEIGHBOR. SEQBOOT was used to prepare 1000
pseudoreplicate datasets for bootstrap analysis; these
replicate datasets were then analyzed using PROTDIST
with the JTT model and NEIGHBOR to create a bootstrap NJ tree. The bootstrap majority-rule consensus
tree was generated using CONSENSE, visualized in FigTree v 1.3.1 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ and
edited using Inkscape 0.48 http://inkscape.org/. The
unrooted consensus tree was drawn to scale, with
branch lengths representing the mean number of substitutions per site.
Mosquito cell culture and experimental treatments

The immortalized, embryo-derived An. gambiae 4a3B
cell line (kindly provided by Hans-Michael Müller) [40]
was maintained in Schneider’s medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen) at 28°C. For each condition, 1 × 106
4a3B cells in 2 mL medium were plated in one well of a
12-well tissue culture plate and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were then treated with the following stimuli
at concentrations previously validated for signaling: 250
μM hydrogen peroxide (VWR International, Radnor,
PA) [20], 6000 pg/ml human TGF-beta1 (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) [20], 1.7 μM human insulin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) [20] or 100 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich) [41] and collected at 5
min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after treatment for subsequent western blot analysis. To quantify
and analyze ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK transcript
expression, 4a3B cells prepared as described above were

Protein extracts of 4a3B cells were prepared by collecting cells in lysis buffer as previously described [9,24].
Briefly, cell medium was removed following treatment
and cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in the plate in 120 μl cell lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 20
mM Na4P2O7, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10%
glycerol, 60 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1
mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mg/ml calyculin A). The plate
was agitated for 30 min at 4°C and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at
14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris
and 100 μl of supernatant from each sample was mixed
with 20 μl of 6 × sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl pH
6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.006% bromophenol blue,
130 mM dithiothreitol) and heated at 95°C for 4 min.
Protein samples were electrophoretically separated on
10% polyacrylamide gels via sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Protein loading was visually assessed by
Coomassie blue staining. Membranes were blocked in
5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in 1 × Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room
temperature. For phosphorylated ERK detection, membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with 1:10,000
mouse anti-phospho-ERK monoclonal antibody (SigmaAldrich) in 5% NFDM in TBS-T. For detection of phospho-p38, phospho-JNK and the loading control protein
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with 1:
1,250 rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), 1:1,250 rabbit anti-phosphoJNK1/2 antibody (Biosource, Carlsbad, CA), or with
1:10,000 rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam, San
Francisco, CA) in 5% NFDM in TBS-T. Membranes
were washed 3 times for 5 min in 1 × TBS-T and incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of horse radish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (SigmaAldrich) or with a 1:20,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit (Fab’)2 fragment (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at 4°C overnight. Following incubation with the secondary antibody, membranes were
washed 3 times for 5 min in 1 × TBS-T. To reveal antibody-bound proteins, membranes were incubated with

(Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 2-3 min. Each membrane was
exposed to blue autoradiography film (ISC Bioexpress,
Kaysville, UT). Phospho-MAPK levels and total GAPDH
levels were quantified on scanned film using a GS-800

California). Overall significance values of all data sets,
therefore, were determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test
and Dunn’s post test for pairwise comparisons (a =
0.05). For the q-PCR data, one way ANOVA and Student-Neuman-Keuls (Graphpad Prism 5.02) were used
for analyses of significance (a = 0.05).

MAPK quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Results

Primers for qPCR of An. gambiae ERK, p38, JNKa, and
JNKb were designed using Primer3Plus http://www.
bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi.
The primers included: ERK, 5’ATCCCGAGCACGATCACA3’ (forward) and 5’CGATTTTGTGTAGCCCT
TGGA3’ (reverse); p38 MAPK, 5’CGGACCACATTCACCAGCTA3’ (forward) and 5’CGCTAAAGTTGCGC
TTCTCC3’ (reverse); JNKa, 5’GCACGCAGCGATACATTAGC3’ (forward) and 5’GTCCACCGAAATCC
TTTCCA3’ (reverse); and JNKb, 5’GACCGACTCGAACGAGCAC3’ (forward) and 5’CGAACCACACGTTGATGTAGC3’ (reverse). The housekeeping
gene encoding ribosomal protein S7 was analyzed as a
control with the primers 5’GAAGGCCTT CCAGAAGGTACAGA3’ (forward) and 5’CATCGGTTT
GGGCAGAATG3’ (reverse).
RNA was isolated from 4a3B cells using Trizol regent
(Invitrogen) and contaminating DNA was removed from
the RNA samples using Turbo DNA-free™ (Ambion,
Austin, TX). All RNA samples were diluted to 200 ng/μl
and 6 μl (1.2 μg) RNA from each sample was reversetranscribed using SuperScript® III (Invitrogen). Sample
cDNAs were used to perform qPCR using Maxima
SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas, Glen
Burnie, MD). The qPCR cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15
s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Three biological replicates
with independent batches of 4a3B cells were analyzed
for the diluent controls and treatments. No template
controls were included for each reaction plate and all
reactions were performed in triplicate to confirm amplification consistency (e.g., all reactions within 0.5 Ct of
each other). The triplicate data were used to determine
an average Ct for each reaction and the data analyzed
using the 2-ΔΔCt method as described [9]. Briefly, the
average Ct value for each target was first normalized to
the average Ct for ribosomal protein S7 gene to obtain
ΔCt, and then the ΔCt value for each insulin-treated
sample was normalized to timepoint-matched control to
obtain ΔΔCt. Fold-change of expression relative to the
diluent control was determined using 2-ΔΔCt.

MAPK discovery

Statistical analyses

For western blotting data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
revealed that non-normal distributions were present in
our data sets (Graphpad Prism 5.02, San Diego,

We used a combination of bioinformatic techniques to
identify a total of 17 MAPKs from the An. gambiae genome (Additional File 1). Among these, AGAP002710
and AGAP006461 were newly identified MAPK orthologs. Based on homology, AGAP002710 is most appropriately defined as An. gambiae MAP3K10/11 or mixed
lineage kinase (MLK) 2/3 (Additional File 1). Similarly,
AGAP006461 is most appropriately defined as An. gambiae MAP3K 12/13 (Additional File 1).
AGAP012148 and AGAP009460 are annotated as p38
MAPK and JNK orthologs, respectively, in Vectorbase
[42]. However, inspection of AGAP012148 by alignment
with p38 MAPK orthologs and Reverse Psi (RPS)BLAST for conserved domains revealed that the annotated sequence was missing key N-terminal residues in
the kinase catalytic domain. Specifically, RPS-BLAST of
the annotated sequence predicted only 4 of 26 active
site and 4 of 11 activation loop residues (not shown).
Because the annotation appeared to be incomplete, we
used the first 10 encoded amino acids from the N-terminus of the Ae. aegypti p38 MAPK ortholog (GenBank
XP_001653239.1) to query the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) An. gambiae trace
archives database (translated in all 6 reading frames)
and identified the probable N-terminus of AGAP012148
(Additional File 2). Similarly, the annotation of
AGAP009460 in Vectorbase [42] does not encode a
start methionine. Approximately 150,000 base pairs of
sequence upstream of the 5’-most nucleotides of
AGAP009460 were translated in the three forward reading frames and analyzed by BLASTX using the first 20
amino acids of the corresponding orthologs from Ae.
aegypti (AAEL008622) and from Culex quinquefasciatus
(CPIJ001156, CPIJ001157). A putative start methionine
with Kozak consensus and additional N-terminal amino
acids extended the encoded sequence of AGAP009460
(Additional File 3).
The MAP4Ks, the MAP3Ks, the MAP2Ks are present
in 1:1 orthology with gene products that have been
identified in D. melanogaster (Additional File 1). Among
the MAPKs, only D. melanogaster Rolled and An. gambiae ERK are in 1:1 orthology. In contrast, the D. melanogaster genome encodes two p38 MAPK orthologs
(p38b, MPK2), a single JNK ortholog (Basket), an ERK5
ortholog (p38c), and an ERK7 ortholog, although the

Horton et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:574
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/574

latter two are not associated with prototypical MAP
kinase cascades [43]. The An. gambiae genome, on the
other hand, encodes a single p38 MAPK, two JNK
orthologs (JNKa, JNKb; 57% identical), and no ERK5
and ERK7 orthologs. Based on sequence homology, An.
gambiae JNKb is most closely related to D. melanogaster
Basket (Additional File 1). The lack of strict 1:1 orthology among the MAPKs is perhaps not surprising
because diversification among these proteins to accommodate unique aspects of host biology would have a
greater likelihood of being tolerated relative to upstream
changes in the signaling cascades that could result in
significantly amplified non-adaptive phenotypes.
To determine whether the complement of MAPKs in
the An. gambiae genome was similar to that in other
mosquito genomes, we examined the available ERK,
JNK, and p38 MAPK orthologs for Ae. aegypti and Cx.
quinquefasciatus (Additional File 4). The genome
sequences of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus are
currently assembled into supercontigs in Vectorbase
[42] (AaegL1.2, September 2009; CpipJ1.2, June 2008).
In this context, if identical nucleotide sequences (due
perhaps to sequence assembly) are excluded, ERK, JNKa,
and JNKb orthologs are in 1:1:1 orthology among the
three mosquito species. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus
appears to possess two relatively short MAPKs that are
tentatively identified as p38 MAPKs. The encoded
sequences share significant identity to Ae. aegypti p38
MAPK and the putative full-length An. gambiae p38
MAPK, but are non-overlapping sequences, so it is
impossible to discern whether these are indeed truly distinct gene products encoded in the Cx. quinquefasciatus
genome. Because these relationships cannot be confirmed with the existing genome assemblies, the Ae.
aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus MAPK sequences were
excluded from the phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogeny

Phylogenetic analysis of the MAPK catalytic domains
(Figure 1) showed strong support for the MAP4K and
MAP2K groups (100% bootstrap support). The MAP3K
Raf superfamily formed a group (81% bootstrap support), but the MAP3K MEKK family did not form an
exclusive group. Similarly, the two MAP3K superfamilies
did not group together as an exclusive group and the
sequences representing MAPK were not supported as a
group in this analysis. The lack of a close relationship
between the Raf and MEKK MAP3K groups was not
unexpected based on previous phylogenetic analyses
[44,45]. The MEKK family proteins (MEKK1-4, ASK1-3)
and the Raf superfamily proteins (MLK1-3, DLK, TAK1)
are both associated with p38 and JNK signaling pathways; however, Raf proteins also figure prominently in
MEK/ERK signaling (RAF, MOS) [43]. Although not

reflected in this analysis, the previously noted division of
the ERK subfamily (ERK1, 2, and 5 versus ERK3, 4, 7/8)
may be due to the classification of ERK3, 4 and 7/8 as
MAPK-like cascade independent kinases [43]. Frequently, sequences from the two deuterostomes
(humans and C. intestinalis) and the insects (An. gambiae and D. melanogaster) grouped together. Exceptions
to these groupings occurred when there were no clear
homologs (e.g., HsMEK5 and HsPRKE1), which likely
reflects the sequence diversification that has resulted in
the many MAPKs that are found in humans relative to
other species.
Functional assays

The identification of the complement of MAP4Ks,
MAP3Ks, MAP2Ks and MAPKs provides a framework
for the prediction of patterns of activation of cell signaling cascades in An. gambiae cells. To attempt to determine whether these pathways are phenotypically
represented in this mosquito species, we selected three
stimuli (hydrogen peroxide, human insulin, and human
TGF-beta1) that we had previously implicated in ERKand p38 MAPK-dependent An. gambiae immune signaling [20], as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an activator
of immune signaling pathways in mosquito cells [41,46],
to stimulate An. gambiae 4a3B cells over an extended
timecourse from 5 min to 24 h. A representative western blot is shown in Additional File 5.
Stimulation with 250 μM hydrogen peroxide induced
significant activation of p38 MAPK at 30 min relative to
the control group (Figure 2A, middle panel). Signaling
declined from 30 min to 3 h post-stimulation, with a
return to control levels by 3 h (Figure 2A, middle
panel). Despite trends toward induction within 1 h of
stimulation, ERK and JNK were not significantly activated by 250 μM hydrogen peroxide in 4a3B cells (Figure 2A, left and right panels). In previous studies,
stimulation of 4a3B cells with 500 μM hydrogen peroxide induced activation of p38 MAPK as well as ERK by
15 min post-treatment [20], a faster and more extensive
MAPK induction than observed here for 250 μM hydrogen peroxide (Figure 2A, middle panel).
In accord with previous observations at 15 min posttreatment [20], stimulation with 1.7 μM human insulin
induced significant activation of ERK and p38 MAPK at
15 min relative to the control and 5 min time point
(Figure 2B, left and middle panels). In contrast to the
more temporally limited activation by hydrogen peroxide, insulin-activated ERK and p38 MAPK were detectable to 3 h and 24 h post-stimulation, respectively,
suggesting a greater persistence of these signaling
responses. Phosphorylation of JNK was slightly, although
not significantly, elevated relative to control levels
within 1 h after stimulation (Figure 2B, right panel).

Figure 2 Levels of pERK, p-p38 and pJNK after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (A), human insulin (B), human TGF-beta1 (C) or LPS (D)
stimulation of An. gambiae 4a3B cells. Samples were collected at 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after stimulation (n = 3-9 for each
treatment and each timepoint). Levels of phospho-MAPKs were normalized to GAPDH and control levels and are indicated as fold change
relative to control (indicated as “1”). For the sake of readability, a single control is indicated for each condition for each MAPK. Biological
replicates of samples are shown as individual data points. Overall significance values of all data sets were determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test
and Dunn’s post test for pairwise comparisons (a = 0.05). * Denotes significant (p < 0.05) differences between treatments or between treatment

Stimulation with 6000 pg/ml human TGF-beta1
induced significant activation of ERK only at 15 min
post-treatment relative to the 5 min time point (Figure
2C, left panel), with detectable levels of activated ERK
through 1 h post-stimulation. This induction of ERK
activation at 15 min, together with a lack of p38 MAPK
activation, was noted previously [20]. In contrast to
slight trends toward JNK activation by hydrogen peroxide and insulin (Figures 2A and 2B, right panels), phosphorylated JNK levels never exceeded baseline control
levels at all times after stimulation with human TGFbeta1 (Figure 2C, right panel).
Stimulation with 100 μg/ml LPS presented a unique
pattern of MAPK activation in An. gambiae 4a3B cells.
In contrast to ERK and p38 MAPK activation by hydrogen peroxide, insulin and TGF-beta1 (Figures 2A-C),
LPS stimulation did not induce mean phosphorylated
ERK levels above baseline (Figure 2D, left panel) and
only non-significant trends toward elevated phosphorylated p38 MAPK were noted through 30 min post-stimulation (Figure 2D, middle panel). Levels of
phosphorylated JNK, however, were significantly
increased by LPS stimulation (Figure 2D, right panel) at
5 min and 30 min post-treatment relative to control,
with slightly elevated but not significant levels of phosphorylated JNK through 3 h post-treatment that
declined to baseline control levels by 6 h post-treatment.
Although the majority of signaling protein genes do
not exhibit transcriptional responsiveness to environmental stimuli (reviewed in [47]), we questioned
whether we might detect a signaling response at the
MAPK transcript level in An. gambiae cells. To address
this question, we used qPCR to analyze expression levels
of p38 MAPK, JNKa, JNKb, and ERK expression in
response to human insulin, the only stimulus for which
we detected changes in phosphorylation for more than
one MAPK (Figure 2). In replicated assays, none of the
four genes exhibited a significant change in expression
from 1 h to 24 h after treatment with 1.7 μM human
insulin (Additional File 6). Together with our phosphorylation data, these data suggest that MAPK responsiveness in An. gambiae cells occurs principally at the
protein level.

Discussion
The protein targets of the mammalian MAPKs (e.g.,
STAT, AP1, p300; Figure 3) [13,43,48] predict a strong
association of the MAPKs with immune regulation. This
association is also ancient, with strong representation in
invertebrates. In C. elegans, p38 MAPK- and pERKdependent signaling pathways, as well as insulin and
TGF-beta signaling pathways, are required for host
defense, with the general presumptions that insulin signaling functions in pathogen surveillance, p38 MAPK-

Page 8 of 13

dependent signaling functions in general defense, and
p38 MAPK-independent signaling pathways provide
pathogen-specific responses (reviewed in [49]). This
nematode, however, lacks orthologs of Rel and nuclear
factor (NF)-kappaB, the primary immune signaling transcription factors of D. melanogaster. In the fruit fly,
Toll- or Imd-dependent signaling regulates NF-kappaB
and JNK pathways, while p38 MAPK-dependent signaling mediates host defense against pathogen invasion
[50,51]. The JNK and p38 MAPKs also mediate control
of antimicrobial peptide expression in D. melanogaster
[50,51], but cooperativity with NF-B appears to be
restricted to JNK. In particular, Imd activation results in
the activation of TAK1 upstream of JNK and I-Kappa
Kinase (IKK), the upstream activator of Rel that ultimately feeds back to reduce JNK activation [52].
The complement of MAP kinases encoded in the An.
gambiae genome would provide this organism with the
significant redundancy of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling
observed in model organisms, although some intriguing
differences between the mosquito and other species are
predicted as well. In particular, An. gambiae MAP4K1
may function similarly to its mammalian counterpart
downstream of Toll and RAC1 (AGAP005445) to activate the mosquito MLK2/3 ortholog (MAP3K10/11;
Additional File 1) and p38 MAPK and JNK signaling
(Figure 3). The second An. gambiae MAP4K - MAP4K4
- would be predicted to activate MAP3K1 and MAP3K7.
However, An. gambiae lacks an ortholog for MAP3K1,
an upstream activator for MEK/ERK signaling, so
MAP4K4 activation of MAP3K7 (AgTAK1) would be
predicted to activate NF-kappaB signaling through IKK
(AGAP009166), and p38 MAPK and JNK signaling
through MAP2K3 and MAP2K7 activation, respectively.
Among the other An. gambiae MAP3K orthologs, a
number are predicted to lack well-defined upstream
activators or to function independently of MAP4K activation. In particular, the activators of An. gambiae
ortholog of MAP3K12/13 (Additional File 1) are not
well defined based on data from mammalian models
(Figure 3); nevertheless, the mosquito protein would be
predicted to contribute to the activation of JNK signaling (Figure 3). Among the MAP3K orthologs that can
be activated independently of MAP4Ks, An. gambiae
MAP3K4 would be predicted to lie downstream of
TGF-beta activation of GADD45 (AGAP007651), while
MAP3K5 could be activated by TGF-beta-mediated activation of DAXX (AGAP009432) or TNF/TNFR activation of TRAF2 (Figure 3). Eiger and wengen have been
identified as D. melanogaster orthologs of TNF/TNFR
and, in the context of innate immunity, eiger functions
independently of the Toll and Imd signaling pathways
to regulate pathogen-induced cell death [53], proliferation of extracellular
pathogens

Figure 3 An overview of mammalian MAPK signaling pathways. This signaling diagram was adapted from the KEGG Pathway Database [48]
updated with information from current literature [13,43]. OMNIGRAFFLE (The Omni Group, Seattle, WA) was used for drawing and layout.
Signaling flows from left to right with ligands and receptors, followed by MAP4Ks, MAP3Ks, MAP2Ks and MAPKs. Orthologs identified in the
genome of An. gambiae are shown in red. As shown in the legend on the right, arrows indicate directed interactions, e.g., phosphorylation,
whereas lines indicate binding interactions. Indirect interactions are shown using dashed lines. Boxes are used to indicate sets of targets that
share a common set of inputs or outputs.

prophenoloxidase-mediated defense responses [55].
Although a clear ortholog of TRAF2 is not apparent in
the An. gambiae genome, orthologs of eiger
(AGAP006771) and wengen (AGAP000728) would suggest that signaling by this ligand and receptor could lead
to MAP3K5/MAP2K3 activation of p38 MAPK.
An examination of possible pathways leading to MEK/
ERK signaling based on the encoded MAP kinases
reveals that, in addition to a lack of MAP3K1, An. gambiae also lacks an ortholog for MAP3K8, so the regulation of MEK/ERK signaling is likely dependent on BRAF and MOS activation, which are the downstream
targets for RAP1 (AGAP001874) and for RAS
(AGAP002219, AGAP002812), a major transducer for
multiple signaling inputs from growth factors and cytokines (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, and TGF-beta; Figure 3).
The data from our functional studies (Figure 2) not
only confirm a subset of signaling predictions from
known pathways (Figure 3), but also suggest that other

pathways may be involved in An. gambiae MAPK activation. In particular, human insulin-induced activation of
An. gambiae ERK was predicted (Figure 3) and this was
consistent with previous observations [20]. In contrast,
activation of An. gambiae p38 MAPK by insulin, which
may occur through hydrogen peroxide at a concentration that is insufficient for ERK activation (Figure 2
compare panels A and B), is not predicted to flow
through MAP4K-MAP3K-MAP2K activation (Figure 3).
Interestingly, several studies have reported cross talk
between the insulin receptor kinase and the Janus-activated kinase (JAK) signaling pathways [56-58]. In particular, JAK2 - the major mediator of inflammatory
cytokine signaling in mammalian cells - can be activated
by hydrogen peroxide [59] and contributes to insulindependent activation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK in a
manner that is independent of insulin receptor substrate
activation and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase/Akt-dependent arm of insulin signaling [60].

Horton et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:574
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/574

Jaramillo-Gutierrez et al. [29] proposed, based on the
regulation of antioxidant gene expression by JNK, that
this MAPK may in fact be induced by oxidative stress to
control redox biology in An. gambiae. These observations - together with our data and known models of
MAPK signaling (Figure 3) - predict the existence of a
pathway involving insulin-induced hydrogen peroxide
regulation of a JAK ortholog (AGAP008354) and downstream activation of p38 MAPK and JNK that can be
tested experimentally in An. gambiae.
In contrast to the prediction of ERK-specific signaling by insulin, existing mammalian signaling data (Figure 3) predict that human TGF-beta1 should activate
ERK as well as p38 MAPK in An. gambiae cells. We
have extensively characterized TGF-beta1-dependent
ERK signaling in the regulation of P. falciparum development in An. stephensi [9,20] and we have also
demonstrated that p38 MAPK is activated by TGFbeta1 in An. stephensi cells [20]. Given that p38
MAPK can be activated in An. gambiae cells (Figure
2B, center panel), our understanding of mammalian
MAPK signaling (Figure 3) would suggest that perhaps
a deficiency in the TGFBR-GADD45-MAP3K4 cascade
is responsible for the failure of TGF-beta1 to activate
p38 MAPK in An. gambiae 4a3B cells. A comparative
analysis of An. stephensi and An. gambiae 4a3B cells,
therefore, could be used to identify critical differences
in these signaling pathways.
LPS has been used as an activator of a variety of
immune signaling pathways in mosquito cells [41,46]. A
putative An. gambiae RAC1-MAP4K1-MAP3K11MAP2K7-JNK signaling cascade (Figure 3) could provide
one mechanism for LPS activation of JNK in An. gambiae 4a3B cells (Figure 2D, right panel). However, we
could also predict, given that this mosquito MAP3K is
orthologous with MAP3K10 as well as MAP3K11 that
LPS should also activate p38 MAPK signaling through
MAP2K4. Because LPS does not significantly activate
p38 MAPK in An. gambiae 4a3B cells (Figure 2D, middle panel), we could speculate that this An. gambiae
MAP3K is functionally more analogous to MAP3K11.
An examination of MAP2K4 and MAP2K3 activation
downstream of An. gambiae MAP3K10/11 using inhibitors or knock down strategies could clarify the orthology
and functionality of this mosquito MAP3K.
Although LPS was the only pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) used in these signaling studies,
the restriction of MAPK activation by LPS to An. gambiae JNK is insightful. Akman-Anderson et al. [25]
showed that P. falciparum hemozoin induced activation
of TAK1 and ERK as well as the signaling kinases Akt/
protein kinase B and atypical protein kinase C zeta/
lambda in An. gambiae 4a3B cells. Activation of TAK1

Page 10 of 13

by this important parasite signaling factor, together with
LPS-specific activation of JNK in our studies, suggests
that JNK may function specifically in pathogen detection
in An. gambiae cells. Indeed, following infection with P.
berghei or P. falciparum, the mosquito midgut epithelium undergoes profound cytoskeletal changes similar to
those regulated by the Toll/MAP2K4/JNK signaling
module in D. melanogaster [61,62].
Additional support of the importance, and perhaps
specificity, of JNK signaling for control of natural P. falciparum infection in An. gambiae is provided by two
population genetics studies. We identified a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the An. gambiae
MAP2K4 (MKK4) gene that was in linkage disequilibrium with a SNP in the gene encoding Toll5B that was
significantly associated with P. falciparum infection [63].
This synonymous SNP, MKK43, introduces a reduction
of codon frequency greater than 3-fold, which could
result in changes in downstream protein expression or
function and, hence, JNK signaling [63]. In addition to
our work, Riehle et al. [64] mapped a locus that is
strongly associated with An. gambiae resistance to P.
falciparum infection in east Africa that encompasses the
chromosomal locations of MAP4K4 and MAP3K12,
both of which are predicted to regulate JNK signaling
(Figure 3).

Conclusions
In sum, we have identified the complement of An. gambiae MAP kinases and used a combination of predicted
signaling relationships and bioassays to suggest novel
interactions and functionality that can be tested experimentally in this biomedically important mosquito species. Clearly, the MAPK signaling cascades are the
major regulators of innate immunity in C. elegans, in D.
melanogaster, and in mammals, but we are only beginning to appreciate the importance of these complex cascades in innate immunity of the mosquito genera that
serve as vectors of globally devastating pathogens of
humans. The establishment of this “road map” based on
the most advanced mosquito genome annotation can,
therefore, accelerate our understanding of host-pathogen
interactions and broader physiology in An. gambiae and
in the closely related An. stephensi and provide a reasonable architecture for similar efforts in Ae. aegypti
and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Further, future efforts to
develop predictive models of anopheline cell signaling
responses, based on iterative construction and refinement of data-based and literature-based knowledge of
the MAP kinase cascades and other networked pathways
(reviewed in [65]), will ultimately be necessary to elucidate the “master signaling regulators” in these biomedically important insects.

amino acids of Ae. aegypti (AAEL) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (CPIJ) JNK
orthologs with upstream sequence from AGAP009460 was used to
predict the start methionine and additional N-terminal amino acids (bold,

6 h and 24 h after treatment. MAPK phosphorylation was examined by
western blotting as described in the Methods. GAPDH levels provided an
assessment of protein loading and were used to normalize
corresponding phospho-MAPK levels. This figure is a representative of
immunoblots from 6-9 independent experiments.
Additional file 6: MAPK transcript expression in insulin-stimulated

or an equivalent volume of diluent and collected at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24
h after treatment (n = 3 for control and treatment at each timepoint).
Expression levels of ERK (A), p38 MAPK (B), JNKa (C), and JNKb (D) were
analyzed by qPCR as described in the Methods. Expression of ribosomal
