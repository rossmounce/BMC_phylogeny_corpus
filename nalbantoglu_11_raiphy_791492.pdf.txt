RAIphy: Phylogenetic classification of
metagenomics samples using iterative refinement
of relative abundance index profiles
Ozkan U Nalbantoglu1*, Samuel F Way1, Steven H Hinrichs2, Khalid Sayood1

Abstract
Background: Computational analysis of metagenomes requires the taxonomical assignment of the genome
contigs assembled from DNA reads of environmental samples. Because of the diverse nature of microbiomes, the
length of the assemblies obtained can vary between a few hundred bp to a few hundred Kbp. Current taxonomic
classification algorithms provide accurate classification for long contigs or for short fragments from organisms that
have close relatives with annotated genomes. These are significant limitations for metagenome analysis because of
the complexity of microbiomes and the paucity of existing annotated genomes.
Results: We propose a robust taxonomic classification method, RAIphy, that uses a novel sequence similarity
metric with iterative refinement of taxonomic models and functions effectively without these limitations. We have
tested RAIphy with synthetic metagenomics data ranging between 100 bp to 50 Kbp. Within a sequence read
range of 100 bp-1000 bp, the sensitivity of RAIphy ranges between 38%-81% outperforming the currently popular
composition-based methods for reads in this range. Comparison with computationally more intensive sequence
similarity methods shows that RAIphy performs competitively while being significantly faster. The sensitivityspecificity characteristics for relatively longer contigs were compared with the PhyloPythia and TACOA algorithms.
RAIphy performs better than these algorithms at varying clade-levels. For an acid mine drainage (AMD)
metagenome, RAIphy was able to taxonomically bin the sequence read set more accurately than the currently
available methods, Phymm and MEGAN, and more accurately in two out of three tests than the much more
computationally intensive method, PhymmBL.
Conclusions: With the introduction of the relative abundance index metric and an iterative classification method,
we propose a taxonomic classification algorithm that performs competitively for a large range of DNA contig
lengths assembled from metagenome data. Because of its speed, simplicity, and accuracy RAIphy can be
successfully used in the binning process for a broad range of metagenomic data obtained from environmental
samples.

Background
A principal goal of metagenomics [1] is to sample
microbiomes and recover genetic material without isolating single organisms, thereby mitigating the problem
of limiting genomic analysis to a small percentage of
existing culturable species. Eventually, this will help
extend the tree of life [2], enrich sequence libraries, and
expand analysis from genomic to metagenomic (e.g.,

samples from various habitats could be used to study
interactions within communities, determining the ecological and metabolic roles of microbes in a community,
their lifestyles, and evolution).
Recent advances in genome sequencing technology
have made metagenomics more feasible. Second generation sequencing technology, such as Roche 454, ABI
SOLiD, and ILLUMINA [3,4], provide a greater amount
of sequenced data at lower cost. Sequencing metagenomes sampled from their natural habitat is already physically achievable. However, there are important
computational challenges. Complete assemblies of

genomes in environmental samples are rarely achievable
for several reasons.
The first obstacle is the population characteristics of
the microbiome communities. While dominant species
are represented in the samples by a greater number of
clones, proportional to the abundant number of individuals, less abundant species are sparsely represented or
in some cases, not captured due to incomplete sampling
[5], resulting in their low representation, or absence, in
the metagenome. The assembled contigs from metagenome reads are generally shorter than the contigs
obtained from the sequencing of single genomes. The
average contig length is frequently around a few kilobase
pairs (kbp). For high diversity metagenomes, much of a
metagenome cannot be assembled, leaving the majority
of the reads as singletons. For example, in a diverse
community sample obtained from Minnesota Soil, less
than 1% of the reads could be assembled [6].
The second obstacle arises from the fact that the new
sequencing technologies generate shorter reads. In
currently popular sequencing technologies, a read corresponds to DNA fragments with lengths between
100-800 bp creating greater dificulties in assembling
contigs as well as shorter singletons. All in all, these
technologies yield contigs ranging from a few hundreds
of base pairs to a few tens of kbp at the end of the
metagenome assembly process.
Analyzing the composition of such a large amount of
fragmented data remains a computational challenge. In
order to identify which operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) exist in the mixture, phylotyping methods are
often employed that involve searching for 16 S rRNA
marker genes [7] or a set of marker genes [8] in a metagenome to locate the OTUs in the existing phylogeny
trees. AMPHORA [9] and MLTreeMap [10] use marker
gene analyses to infer the phylogenetic information of a
given environmental sample. While those programs supply information about the biodiversity of a sample, they
only associate those genome fragments that carry a marker gene with possible OTUs. That means the great
majority of sequencing reads remain unassociated with
any taxa. However, along with the composition of the
metagenome, classifying each sequence fragment into
taxonomic units is also a challenge that needs to be met
in metagenomics. This is required to link genes discovered to the members of a taxon or to enable divide-andconquer approaches as a solution to the metagenome
assembly problem.
In this article, we refer to the process of classifying the
metagenome fragments into OTUs as binning. We can
categorize most binning methods as similarity-based
methods and composition-based methods. In similaritybased methods, the DNA fragments to be classified are
compared with existing sequences by performing string

Page 2 of 14

similarity searches against a molecular sequence database
(e.g., BLAST). The MEGAN system [11] is an example of
similarity-based binning. It attempts to predict the source
of the sequences by assigning them to hypothetical common ancestors using multiple high scores gathered from a
similarity search system, such as BLAST [12]. CARMA
[13] is an algorithm that assigns the sequences to taxonomical origins by trying to match them to known protein
families contained in Pfam domains. Although these methods are frequently used for phylotyping, they can be
employed for binning since they utilize comprehensive
protein/nucleotide domains and attempt to classify any
given genome fragment. While computationally expensive,
these algorithms have been shown to be accurate even for
short sequences in the current pyrosequencing read length
range (80-400 bp). However, the accuracy drops dramatically when phylogenetically close sequences are missing
from the search databases. Running CARMA on a comprehensive dataset gathered from a large spectrum of
known genomes resulted in inaccurate classifications [13].
(6% sensitivity when using 100 bp sequences for identification at the genus level). Moreover, in a recent study [14],
only 12% of the data obtained from microbial communities in coral atolls got significant BLAST hits. Thus, even
if similarity-based methods were much more accurate,
they would still be unable to identify sequences from a
large proportion of the microbial population.
Composition-based binning methods approach the
problem using conserved compositional features of genomes, such as short oligonucleotide usage patterns. It
has been observed that relative frequencies of k-mers in
DNA sequences are taxon specific and carry phylogenetic signals. Moreover, they are fairly conserved for
relatively short fragments. Thus to some extent, it is
possible to predict the origin of a random DNA fragment given the relative oligonucleotide frequencies of
the possible sources. A number of unsupervised methods for clustering fragments originating from similar
taxonomic units have been proposed. TETRA [15] uses
relative proportions of tetranucleotides with respect to
the database samples in DNA contigs and calculates the
correlations of pairs as a measure of similarity. Selforganizing maps (SOM [16,17], GSOM [18], S-GSOM
[19]) are used for clustering profiles of tetranucleotide
frequencies.
When the binning task includes assigning taxonomical
labels using available genomic information, supervised
methods are employed; and the available genomic
sequences of known organisms are used for training
source models. A naive-Bayesian Classifier-based
method proposed by Sandberg et al. [20] and a Markov
chain method by Dalevi et al. [21] are early examples of
this approach. The algorithm, PhyloPythia [22], consists
of various support vector machine (SVM) Classifiers and

Nalbantoglu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/41

uses relative frequency profiles of short oligonucleotides
as feature vectors. Satisfactory sensitivity and specificity
results are reported for the sequence lengths >1-3 kbp.
However, a sharp cutoff in the accuracy is observed for
fragments less than 1 kbp in length. Another recent
taxonomic classification method, TACOA [23], proposes
a k-nearest-neighbor-classification-based algorithm. In
this method, genomic sequences are represented by the
abundance profiles of oligonucleotides. TACOA correctly classifies fragments larger than 800 bp with an
average sensitivity between 76% at rank superkingdom
and 39% at rank genus, and its performance is comparable to PhyloPythia in that range.
There are several ways of measuring the distance or
similarity of sequence composition, in particular the distances between relative oligonucleotide frequencies or
oligonucleotide abundance feature vectors. However,
measures such as Euclidean distances (PhyloPythia),
inner products (TACOA), and Pearson Correlations
(TETRA) have some inherent limitations in this context.
Since all 4k oligonucletotide components calculated over
k-mer frequencies are involved in similarity measurements, good estimates of all components are necessary;
and overfitting dramatically drops the detection accuracy. In order to prevent overfitting, more data points
are needed to accurately estimate frequencies of occurrence (i.e., longer fragments); and the number of parameters to be estimated should preferably be kept small
(i.e., shorter oligonucleotides). Not surprisingly, all of
these methods work best with relatively short oligomers
(TETRA, TACOA: 4-mers, and PhyloPythia: 5-mers)
with sequences â¥1-3 kbp. However, longer-range correlations exist in DNA sequences, which we would like to
exploit for fragment identification even with short
sequence reads. It has been observed that methods that
employ probabilistic frameworks, such as the naive
Bayesian Classifier, which estimates the probability of
observing DNA sequences based on relative oligonucleotide frequencies [20], or Markov models [21,24], can
achieve better accuracy for longer oligonucleotides, even
for sequences shorter than 3 kbp.
To date, the only composition-based algorithm
reported to be successful with short reads is Phymm
[24]. It was developed for the classification of short read
lengths of metagenomics data. It is based on a Bayesian
decision machine that detects the taxonomic source of a
read with its maximum a posteriori probability calculated over variable-order Markov models. Phymm provides significantly better accuracy than CARMA and
PhyloPythia. PhymmBL [24], which combines the
Phymm-based approach with a BLAST-based similarity
approach, provides superior performance to Phymm,
albeit at a significant computational cost.

Metagenomic fragment classification remains an
important computational challenge that requires the
taxonomic assignment of genomic sequences of various
lengths, which in turn requires reliable sensitivity and
specificity values for a large spectrum of fragment
lengths. We propose a composition-based semisupervised binning algorithm, RAIphy. This method characterizes, or models, a genome/taxonomic unit with a set
of parameters called the Relative Abundance Index
(RAI). According to this model, an index value is calculated for each k-mer, based on the over- and underabundance statistics gathered from the taxon. Unlike the
work of Brendel et al. [25] used in the work of Qi et al.
[26] and Wan et al [27], the over- and underabundance
statistics are obtained with reference to a sequence of
Markov models. A given random genome fragment is
given a membership score with respect to a taxon by
adding up the index values in the RAI model for the
taxon for each observed k-mer in the fragment.
The fragment is assigned to the taxon that results in the
highest score. An iterative process consisting of classifying the fragments from a mixture using the current RAI
models then updating the RAI models based on the
resulting clusters is used to improve the classification
accuracy. As the initial RAI seeds, RAIphy uses models
estimated from genomes currently available in the
RefSeq database, and thus RAIphy can be categorized as
a semi-supervised method.
RAIphy has been implemented as a simple, compact
standalone desktop application, which is fast compared
to similarity-search-based applications. While achieving
competitive binning accuracies for the DNA sequencing
read length range (100-1000 bp), the method also performs accurately for longer environmental contigs.

Methods
There are three components of the RAIphy algorithm:
the Relative Abundance Index and the corresponding
profile or model for genomic fragments and taxonomic
units; the classification metric; and the iterative algorithm used to refine the models used for classification.
We describe each in turn.
Relative Abundance Index

The Relative Abundance Index is a measure of the relative abundance of oligonucleotides in genomic fragments.
Based on the available genomic sequences for a taxonomic unit, a score is assigned to each possible k-mer.
These scores are higher for overrepresented k-mers and
lower for underrepresented k-mers. The vector of k-mer
scores comprises the RAI profile for a taxonomic unit.
The under and the overrepresentation of each k-mer
is measured using the log-odd ratios between the

observed and expected frequencies of each k-mer.
Therefore, for an overrepresented k-mer, the observed
frequency is higher than the expected frequency; and
the RAI score is positive. It is negative for an underrepresented k-mer. Using relative frequency counts as estimations of k-mer probabilities in a genome sequence,
we use Markov assumptions for the calculation of
expected k-mer probabilities.
Consider a k-mer, x1, x2, . . . , xk, with probability p(x1,
x2, . . . . xk). We can write this probability as:
(1)
We can rewrite the first factor on the right hand side
of Equation (1) under different independence assumptions as follows. Assuming that the bases occur independently of each other, the conditional probability can be
replaced by the marginal probability
(2)
To test this assumption, we can compute a log odds
ratio to form the relative abundance index of order 0 rai0:
(3)

unit, and a negative value if the probability of observing
x1, . . . , xk is lower than expected for a particular taxonomic unit.
The probabilities used for obtaining the RAI values for
k-mers are estimated using the relative frequency of
occurrence of that k-mer in the taxonomic unit. Thus,
for each taxonomic unit for which we have genomic
sequences, we compute a corresponding RAI profile.
This profile serves as a model for that taxonomic unit.
Classification Metric

To assign a genomic fragment, F, from an unknown
source to a taxonomic unit, we first compute the relative frequencies of occurrence for each k-mer from the
fragment. For each candidate taxonomic unit, we then
obtain a membership score by computing the weighted
sum of the components of the RAI profile of the taxonomic unit where the weighting is the corresponding
k-mer frequency of occurrence for the fragment F.
Given a RAI model belonging to the taxon, Gi, and an
unknown genome fragment, F, the membership score,
EF [raiGi ], is given as:
G

E F [rai j ] =

If we assume that the bases follow a first order Markov model,
p( x k | x1 , x 2 , â¦ , x k â1) = p( x k | x k â1)
=

p( x k â1 , x k )
.
p( x k â1)

(5)

The corresponding relative abundance index rai1 is
then given by:
rai1( x1 , x 2 , â¦ , x k ) = log 2

p( x1 , x 2 , â¦ , x k )p( x k â1)
. (6)
p( x k â1 , x k )p( x1 , x 2 , â¦ , x k â1)

Continuing in this fashion, we obtain:
rai i ( x1 , x 2 , â¦ , x k ) = log 2

p( x1 , x 2 , â¦ x k )p( x k â1 â¦ x k âi )
.
p( x k , x k â1 , â¦ x k âi )p( x1 , x 2 , â¦ x k â1)

(7)

We combine the relative abundance indices of all orders
by adding them to give the total superposed profile

Given a particular k-mer, x1, . . . , xk, {rai(x1, x2, . . . ,
xk)} is a positive value if the probability of observing x1, . .

where fF (x1, x2,..., xk) is the frequency of a k-mer in
the fragment, F, and raiGj is calculated using the relative
frequency counts of the k-mers observed in the taxon, j.
Consider what happens when the statistics of the
k-mers of the fragment match the statistics of a taxonomic unit. For a k-mer that occurs often, the frequency
of occurrence will be a high and the RAI value of the
k-mer for the taxonomic unit will be positive. The more
often the k-mer occurs, the larger will be the values of
both the RAI and the frequency of occurrence. For
k-mers that occur less often than expected, the frequency of occurrence will be low; and the RAI value of
the k-mer for the taxonomic unit will be negative. Thus
in the sum, the positive RAI values will be weighted by
the larger frequencies of occurrence; and the negative
values will be weighted with the lower frequencies of
occurrence. The opposite will happen when the statistics
of the fragments are completely mismatched with the
statistics of a taxonomic unit. Therefore, the membership score for the matching taxonomic unit will be
higher than the membership score for the mismatched
taxonomic unit. We have empirically observed that genome fragments attain higher membership scores when
they share the same taxa with an RAI profile (Additional
File 1). This can also be shown mathematically assuming
stationarity (Additional File 2).

We have observed that RAI performs better than the
similarity measures defined by Sandberg et al. [20] and
Dalevi et al. [21] with the same experiment setup used
in those studies (Additional File 3). Therefore, we have
adopted RAI as the compositional detection approach to
be used in our metagenomic phylogeny classification.
Iterative Refinement of Genome Models

Metagenomics binning programs are designed for classifying genome fragments of previously unknown species
using phylogenetically close genomes. Since the conserved compositional features, or genome signatures, of
the unknown species in the mixture are not available,
the presumption is that the classification algorithm will
assign the fragment to the same or a close clade-level
for which a model (in this case an RAI profile) is available. While this can be done with some success, there
remains significant room for improving the classification
accuracy by adaptively updating the models used for
detection. The heuristics presented here rely on the fact
that we actually possess genomic fragments from the
unknown genome in the mixture. Therefore, we use a
multistep process in which the first step uses classification, as described above, using the RAI profiles of
known species. Once this first classification has been
performed, the resulting clusters of fragments can be
used to obtain the RAI profiles of the unknown species.
Obtaining the genome signatures of these clustered fragments (and subsequently training models over them)
results in models that better describe the composition of
the unknown genome leading to more accurate classification. Experiments supporting these claims are presented in the Results section.
The refinement procedure consisted of the repetition
of two phases. In the first phase, RAI profiles were estimated from genomes of known organisms. Each metagenome fragment was classified by assigning it to the
genomes returning the maximum RAI score. In the
second phase, the oligonucleotide frequencies and, subsequently, the RAI profiles for each class were recalculated using the collection of fragments assigned to the
corresponding class. These two phases were iteratively
repeated until a stopping criterion was met. With each
refinement, the metagenome fragments were represented with improved RAI profiles. Thus, the average
membership scores were expected to increase. When
the change in the increase of average membership

scores with a refinement became small, we stopped the
refinement procedure. Here, the stopping criterion was
met if the improvement in the score was less than 1% of
the membership score achieved in the previous iteration.
The algorithm is quite robust to the stopping threshold;
reducing the threshold by several orders of magnitude
has no effect on the binning performance. This procedure can be thought of as an expectation maximization
algorithm with hard decision of classes [28]. From this
point of view, it is similar to a seeded K-means clustering algorithm, with training initial conditions using previously known data [29]. Instead of minimizing the
mean Euclidean distance, our objective was to maximize
the mean average membership score. The algorithm can
be summarized as follows:
Classification with iterative refinement:
N Metagenome fragments: Fjj Ã {1, 2, .., N}
M RAI profiles: raiGi i Ã {1, 2, .., M}
M taxonomic classes: Gii Ã {1, 2, .., M}
1. CLASSIFY allFj using allraiGi
2. UPDATE allraiGi usingFj Ã Gi
AVERAGE _ Membership _ SCORE _ CURRENT
3. BREAK IF | AVERAGE _ Membership _ SCORE _ PREVIOUS â 1 |< 0.01
4. GOTO 1
We tested the performance of this algorithm using the
same data and experimental design as in [24] (i.e.,
the same genomes were used for training RAIs, and the
same fragments were used for testing). The test fragments in this dataset were short fragments in the range
of 100-1000 bp. Observing the performance of iterative
refinement on short fragments was important because
the ratio of false positives is greater for short fragment
lengths, as is the noise introduced by them. Therefore,
the task of improving the models in this band was
harder. We observed improvement in classification
accuracy for all fragment lengths we tested in a small
number of iterations (3-6). The increase in accuracy for
the fragment length of 400 bp is shown in Figure 1.
Test Data

In order to be able to conduct controlled experiments,
we created synthetic metagenome data using the available
genomes in the US National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) RefSeq database [30] as of March
2010. We built our database storing RAI profiles for all
1,146 available genomes. Different chromosomes and
plasmids belonging to the same organism were concatenated and treated as a single sequence. These served as
the initial seeds in a run of RAIphy. For phylogenetic binning and labeling, we collected the taxonomic information from the NCBI taxonomy database. The data
collected was comprised of 609 species, 318 genera, 158

Nalbantoglu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/41

families, 88 orders, 41 classes, and 26 phyla. To test the
performance of our program, leave-one-out, cross-validation tests were performed as follows: for every taxonomic
unit comprised of at least two subtaxa (e.g., a genus having more than one different species), a test genome was
selected; and 3000 test fragments were drawn randomly
from each one of those genomes. The RAI profiles were
trained over the remaining taxa. The test genome was
not used for obtaining the RAI profile. This was done for
every genome that was not a single representative of a
clade. We repeated each experiment 100 times to assess
the first and second order accuracy statistics.
Program Parameters

Since RAIphy was designed as an iterative algorithm,
which retrains its models depending on the change in the
average membership score, the parameters were kept
constant for the whole spectrum of fragment lengths.
The oligonucleotide length was fixed at seven. Although
it has been shown that longer correlations exist in DNA
and that it is possible to exploit longer oligonucleotides
for sufficient sequence lengths [31], we observed that the
classification accuracy saturates after an oligomer length
of seven (Additional File 3). The binning accuracy
increases significantly with the increase in k-mer size to a
size of seven (Figure 2, Additional File 3). However,
increasing the size of the k-mers beyond seven results in
negligible accuracy improvement while significantly
increasing the computational burden. An RAI profile was
updated only if the total length of the fragments assigned
to the corresponding class exceeded 25 kbp.

Results and Discussion
Absolute Metrics vs. Probability Metrics

In order to show the improvement in accuracy obtained
by replacing the distance/similarity metrics from absolute metrics, such as Euclidean norms, or correlation
coefficients to probabilistic measures, such as Bayesian
posterior probabilities, we ran the same experiments
with different metrics using the dataset in [20]. The
example shows the percent of true positive ratios for
short fragments, and the metric defined in Equation
[20] can be observed to be more accurate for 7-mer frequencies. This was the motivation for using a probabilistic method for oligonucleotide usage measurement. The
results are shown in Figure 2. The improvement of
Bayesian detection over the use of Euclidean distance
and the Pearson correlation coefficient is evident for all
fragment lengths.
Experiments in Support of the Refinement Process

There are two observations that support the thesis that a
refinement process will improve the overall detection performance. First, the genome signatures estimated using
the detected portion of a genome should be a good
approximation of the signature of the unknown genome.
That is to say, we should be able to perform sufficient classification with the models trained from incomplete genomes and even with a collection covering a small
percentage of the genome. Although the genome signatures are known to be pervasive, we investigated whether
the pervasiveness was sufficient to allow a reasonable estimate of the signature to be extracted from a small fraction

Figure 2 Classification accuracy for different distance metrics.
The accuracy performance of different distance/similarity metrics for
28 taxa with varying fragment lengths is shown. The frequencies of
7-mers were used. Using the metric defined by Sandberg et al.
appears to be more accurate for all fragment lengths than
employing Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation coefficients.

Nalbantoglu et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:41

of the genome. We repeated the fragment classification
experiments in [20] using models trained over various coverage percentages of genomes starting from the entire genome down to only 10% of the genome. Employing the RAI
in the manner described above, as shown in Figure 3, we
observed that there is only a decrease in accuracy of 2-4%
in the worst case. This result supports the premise that
even with a small collection of fragments in a taxonomic
bin after the classification we could train a practically useful model for the unknown organism.
The first experiment demonstrated that it was possible
to train a model with a small fraction of the genome
that could be obtained through classification of the samples of the microbiome. However, these results assume
that the genomic fragments available truly belong to the
organism being detected. Taxonomic classification algorithms return significant amounts of false positives.
These false positives could conceivably make the algorithm diverge and actually reduce classification accuracy.
We conducted a number of experiments to make sure
that this would not happen with RAIphy for the metagenomic classification experiments. An example of the
results of such an experiment is shown in Figure 1. We
had no experiments in which the algorithm diverged.
Classification Performance for Short Fragments

The first set of experiments included testing the accuracy of RAIphy for short fragments in the range of 1001,000 bp. The experiments were divided into ranges or
bands of fragment length, because existing programs

of training genomes. RAI profiles are built using the entire genome
and fragments of genomes covering 50%, 40%, 20%, and 10% of
the genome. The decrease in the classification performance due to
incomplete training data coverage was not significant, and
classification capability was conserved.

operating in different bands have different accuracy
scores and properties. For example, TACOA and PhyloPythia perform poorly for short fragments as mentioned
above. On the other hand, similarity-based programs,
such as Carma, also perform poorly when the genome
of origin is not available. Currently, the only composition-based method that can accurately classify previously
unobserved metagenome samples in this range is
Phymm. In Figure 4, the accuracy (i.e., the percent true
positive rate) performance with changing fragment
lengths is illustrated. It can be seen that the RAIphy
classification performance compares favorably to
Phymm for all fragment lengths. In Figure 5, RAIphy is
compared with PhymmBL, which combines Phymm and
BLAST. PhymmBL outperforms RAIphy for shorter
fragment lengths at a cost of significantly increased
computation time.
Binning Fragments in the Absence of Close Relatives

Even with our contemporary knowledge of microbiology, a great majority of the tree of life is unknown.
Therefore, it would not be unexpected to have genome
fragments of an unknown clade in a metagenome sample. In this case, a metagenome binning method is
desired to assign the fragments of undiscovered genomes to sister taxa in the same clade-level. To simulate
this situation and observe how RAIphy performs in such
cases, we tested it with incomplete training data. We
repeated the previous experiments with leave-one-out,

>1000 bp fragments. Here, its poor performance for short-read
range can be observed for 1 Kbp accuracy. Also, Carma searching
Pfam domains and protein families for short reads, such as 100 bp
fragments, appeared to be performing poorly in accordance with
the results reported in [13].

cross-validation; however, this time, all representatives
of the taxonomic group that the test samples belong to
were removed from the training data and an assignment
to a sister taxon (e.g., a genus from the same family
with the unknown genus) was accepted as a correct
classification. We performed the tests for the unknown
taxa of different clade-levels from family to class levels.
The correct classification rate decreased substantially
with missing data. RAIphy performed at under 50%
accuracy for all clade-levels for fragment lengths in the
range of 100 bp-1 Kbp. In Figure 6, the binning performance for RAIphy, Phymm, and BLAST searches is illustrated for a read length of 400 bp and 1 Kbp. While
this performance is still superior to other compositionbased methods, similarity searches performed using
BLAST performed better for short read lengths of 100
bp and 200 bp (Additional File 4).
Classification Performance for Longer Metagenome
Fragments

The classification performance for genomic fragments of
800 bp-50 Kbp was also studied. This range is significant because it represents lengths of assembled contigs,
while the shorter fragments correspond to single
sequencing reads. In taxonomic classification, generation
of a smaller number of highly reliable predictions is preferred over predicting the majority of fragments with
less reliable labels [23]. When this is the case, genomic
fragments with reliable scores can be classified and suspicious fragments left as âunknown.â Adopting the

specificity and lower average sensitivity. The sensitivity

where TPi is the number of samples correctly classified to the class i (true positives), FNi is the number of
samples assigned to another class even though they
belong to class i (false negatives), and Ui is the unclassified number of samples belonging to class i. The specificity for the class i is defined as:

RAIphy. However, RAIphy attains higher accuracy for longer
fragments.

where FPi is the number of samples assigned to the

Determining an operating point in the sensitivityspecificity trade-off was achieved by using different
approaches for different methods. In TACOA, the
kernel parameters governed the thresholds for classifying
samples. In Diaz et al. [23], grid searches were employed
to decide the optimal accuracy values and for setting the
parameters. PhyloPythia uses a post-processing one-versus-all SVM Classifier to detect the reliable samples and
leave the rest âunknown.â RAIphy classifies all metagenomic fragments to a taxonomic bin by default. However,
RAIphy also allows setting thresholds and operating at
different points of the sensitivity-specificity curves. We

assigned detection-quality scores to fragments to measure the likelihood of fitting. The quality scores were calculated as the difference between the best average RAI
score and the next best score:
q ( F ) = E F [rai Gi ] â E F [rai G k ]

(13)

where i is the class returning the best RAI score (EF ),
and k is the class returning the second highest RAI
score. If a fragment fits equally well to more than one
model, the quality score turns out to be 0; and if a fragment reflects the characteristics of one class much better than any other class, it receives a high quality score.
Setting percentage thresholds (p) to assign the top p%
scored fragments of each class and drop the labels of
the remaining (100-p) % to âunknownâ increased the
specificity while reducing the sensitivity. Geometrically
speaking, the fragments remaining in an iso-quality
hyperboloid were assigned; and the others outside the
hyperboloid were determined to be unclassified. Therefore, this thresholding is a tightening of the decision
boundary from a hyperplane to a hyperboloid in the feature space.
Figures 7, 8, and 9 show the specificity-sensitivity performance obtained from a cross-validation test on the
dataset for 800 bp, 1 kbp, and 10 Kbp fragments (The
specificity results for each taxon in 800-50 kbp fragment
range are illustrated in Additional File 5). Four thousand
random fragments were sampled from each test species.

The optimized sensitivity and specificity values for
TACOA and PhyloPythia were also shown for the same
datasets. RAIphy significantly outperformed both algorithms for the given range of fragments and clade-levels.
An advantage of RAIphy, as demonstrated by the sensitivity-specificity performance curves, is that even when
samples with low confidence scores are included in the
classification, we retain high specificity; and the number
of unknown samples decreases and sensitivity values
increase, whereas the specificity drop is only around
10-25% for 800 bp and 1 Kbp fragments and around
10-15% for 10 Kbp fragments.
Performance on Real-Life Metagenomic Data

The RAIphy system was also tested using a real-life
dataset. Recognizing the control on real metagenome
data is very limited and that true labels of assembled
contigs and reads are not entirely known or the labeling
is low quality, the experiment was performed on a subset of an Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) metagenome [33].
The AMD sample consisted of a low-diversity community that was dominated by three microbic populations:
Ferroplasma acidarmanus and Leptospirillum sp. groups
II and III. Since these organisms exist abundantly in the
community, it has been possible to assemble draft genomes for these organisms. Therefore, we can accurately
determine which fragment reads belong to these organisms with sequence alignments since fragments originating from the draft genomes align with few mismatches.

with 1 Kbp fragments using the dataset obtained from the RefSeq database. The accuracy values for TACOA and PhyloPythia are also illustrated
for the same test data.

This allowed us to observe the classification accuracy of
our method for a subset of real metagenome data that
could be accurately labeled. The phylum-level taxonomy
assignments for each of the three genomes are shown in
Figure 10. Ferroplasma acidarmanus belongs to Euryarchaeota phylum of Archaea; 49.6% of the fragments
were correctly classified, as shown in Figure 10-a. This
compares with 41.4% for Phymm, 48.6% for MEGAN,
and 61% for PhymmBL, as shown in Table 1. The similarity scores used as MEGAN input were obtained from
nucleotide BLAST with the RefSeq database used as the
similarity search set.
Leptospirillum sp. groups II and III are bacteria
belonging to the Nitrospirae phylum, which does not
exist in the NCBI RefSeq database and, consequently, in
our database. The genus Leptospirillum was assigned as
Deltaprotobacteria [34], which is a class of Protobacteria. Of the fragments putatively determined to be Leptospirillum sp. group II reads, 87.6% were assigned to
the Protobacteria phylum. For Phymm the true positive
percentage was 80.2%, for MEGAN it was 60.4%, while
for PhymmBL it was 79.6%, as shown in Table 2. Finally
for Leptospirillum sp. group III fragments, the true positive rate for RAIphy was 85.3%. This compares to 77.3%
for Phymm, 62% for MEGAN, and 76.9% for PhymmBL,
as shown in Table 3. This is a significant improvement
in classification performance.

Conclusions
We proposed a metagenome binning method that
exploits inherent features of genomic signatures with a
novel measure called RAI and a novel classification
metric. Our simulations used a large genomic fragment
length range from 100 bp to 50 Kbp. This range covers
the length of average metagenome assembly contigs and
the length of sequencing reads with the current sequencing technology. The simulations resulted in classification accuracy ranging between 38-97% at the deepest
clade-level (genus). Using RAI scores, the optimal performance was obtained using relatively longer oligonucleotides (7-mers) than methods using Euclidean
distance and correlation-based scores utilizing shorter
k-mer statistics. We attributed a part of the improvement
in classification accuracy to being able to use longer oligonucleotide statistics, which include additional information on the DNA k-mer distribution. Moreover, with the
availability of RAI profile updates using the predicted
DNA sequences, we have defined an iterative classification method that improves the classification accuracy.
We believe the improvement is due to the fact that genome signatures are pervasive, and genome models can be
approximated without requiring the availability of complete genomes. Therefore, a small set of genome fragments was sufficient to update the initial genome models.
In our case, a set of fragments forming 25 Kbp of

nonoverlapping genomic sequence was sufficient to
increase the classification accuracy in the next iteration.
In addition to the experiments performed on synthetic
metagenomics data, we tested RAIphy with well-studied,
real-life metagenome AMD sample reads. RAIphy outperformed the composition-based Phymm and nucleotide BLAST search-based MEGAN on the binning task.
PhymmBL, which uses a composite method consisting
of Phymm and BLAST, did better than RAIphy in one
of the three tasks and worse in the other two.
PhymmBL took substantially longer to complete the
tasks than Phymm or RAIphy. The running time of
RAIphy scales linearly with the average fragment length
and the number of fragments in the metagenome sample. In our experiments, it took less than 4 hours to bin
the AMD metagenome with the most comprehensive
search models that contained all 1,146 genomic
sequences of the (NCBI) RefSeq database on a standard
desktop computer with a 2.19 GHz CPU. Processing of

the same dataset with similarity-search-based binning
programs, such as CARMA and MEGAN (run with
blastn), and even with phylotyping pipelines AMPHORA
and MLTreeMap, requires >24 hours. PhymmBL took
around 464 hours to process the dataset. Using genus
level RAI profiles, the current version of RAIphy can
bin 1.5 Gbp of genomic sequences with 400 bp average
read length in 24 hours. This amount of data is achievable with next generation, high-throughput sequencing;
and RAIphy appears to satisfy a computational need for
fast and accurate metagenome binning. RAIphy uses a
moderate amount of memory (304 MB with specieslevel training loaded and 47 MB with genus-level training loaded) in its runtime.
We have implemented RAIphy as an open-source
desktop application supported with a simple graphical
user interface. While the default is for all the RAI profiles of the RefSeq database in the species and genus
level to be used as database files, there is also an option

to create custom databases if a set of training sequences
are provided. Since the program performs with a satisfactory accuracy both for read-length and assemblylength DNA fragments, it can be utilized either as a preprocessing stage in a metagenomics pipeline to improve
the assembly procedure or as the binning procedure for
the assembled contigs.
We have observed that the accuracy falls to below 50%
when sister taxa of the unknown fragments are not close
relatives. This appears to be a universal problem that is
also observed with other binning methods. For the
metagenome samples of undiscovered microbes, it
might be a safe strategy to sacrifice prediction resolution
and bin the sequences to higher taxonomic units, such
as phylum or class, or sacrifice specificity by selecting
best hits and leaving suspicious assignments âunknown.â
RAIphy outputs assignments at all taxonomic levels as
well as providing a thresholding option to select the
best hits. Another universal problem, which RAIphy also
suffers from, is the classification of horizontally transferred regions in procaryotes. Since recently transferred
regions differ in composition, predictions of those
regions result in false binning.

Additional material
Additional File 1: Empirical distributions of RAI scores. Histograms of
the Relative Abundance Index scores are shown for different levels of
phylogenetic closeness. A RAI profile is built for a species, and RAI scores
calculated using this profile for a relatively close relative and a distant
relative are considered. A close relative is expected to have higher RAI
scores, and a low score is expected for a distant relative. The empirical
distributions calculated by RAI score histograms support this claim.
Additional File 2: Analytical result showing RAI scores measures
compositional similarity. With the assumption that elements from the
same taxonomic units follow the same K-mer probability distribution, it is
shown that RAI profiles of DNA fragments from the same taxon attain
higher membership scores than fragments from other taxa.
Additional File 3: Classification performance of RAI similarity
measure. Figure 1 shows the comparison of Relative Abundance Index
measure with other similarity measures for 100 bp-1000 bp fragment
lengths. An oligomer length of 7 is used. Figure 2 shows the detection
accuracy for varying oligomer lengths (dinucleotide to octanucleotide)
using an RAI measure in the range of 100 bp-1000 bp fragment length.

Relatives. Comparison of RAIphy, BLAST, and Phymm with incomplete

fragments. Using metagenome fragments ranging from 800 bp to 50
Kbp, the specificity results were illustrated for each taxon. The results are
