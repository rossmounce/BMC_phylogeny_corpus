Abstract
Background: The mitochondria are involved in many basic functions in cells of vertebrates, and
can be considered the power generator of the cell. Though the mitochondria have been extensively
studied there appear to be only few expression studies of mitochondrial genes involving a large
number of tissues and developmental stages. Here, we conduct an analysis using the PigEST
resource [1] which contains expression information from 35 tissues distributed on one normalized
and 97 non-normalized cDNA libraries of which 24 are from developmental stages. The
mitochondrial PigEST resource contains 41,499 mitochondrial sequences.
Results: The mitochondrial EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) sequences were assembled into contigs
which covers more than 94 percent of the porcine mitochondrial genome, with an average of 976
EST sequences per nucleotide. This data was converted into expression values for the individual
genes in each cDNA library revealing differential expression between genes expressed in cDNA
libraries from developmental and adult stages. For the 13 protein coding genes (and several RNA
genes), we find one set of six genes, containing all cytochrome oxidases, that are upregulated in
developmental tissues, whereas the remaining set of seven genes, containing all ATPases, that are
upregulated in adult muscle and brain tissues. Further, the COX I (Cytochrome oxidase subunit
one) expression profile differs from that of the remaining genes, which could be explained by a
tissue specific cleavage event or degradation pattern, and is especially pronounced in
developmental tissues. Finally, as expected cDNA libraries from muscle tissues contain by far the
largest amount (up to 20%) of expressed mitochondrial genes.
Conclusion: Our results present novel insight into differences in mitochondrial gene expression,
emphasizing differences between adult and developmental tissues. Our work indicates that there
are presently unknown mechanisms which work to customize mitochondrial processes to the
specific needs of the cell, illustrated by the different patterns between adult and developmental
tissues. Furthermore, our results also provide novel insight into how in-depth sequencing can
provide significant information about expression patterns.

Background
The mammalian mitochondrion is a system of only few
components. It consist of 13 protein coding genes, 22
tRNA, two rRNAs and possibly a few non-coding RNAs
[2]. In spite of this, the mitochondrion is of great importance to the organism, and higher animals would likely
not exist without functional mitochondria. Thus, the
mitochondria are an essential part of many metabolic
pathways, most notably generation of ATP through the
oxidative phosphorylation system, and is unique among
the cellular organelles, because it contains a genome of its
own [3,4] (and references therein). The circular mitochondrial genome also deviates from the nuclear genome
by being extremely compact in nature with almost no
inter-spaced non-coding DNA between genes, furthermore, it has a special codon usage using only the 22
tRNAs to encode the amino acids. The compact nature of
the mitochondrion is directly reflected in the transcription mechanism, as all genes are transcribed in polycistronic transcripts which are then processed to give the
mature RNAs [3,4] (and references therein).
Since, the genes encoded in the mitochondrial DNA are
used in pathways central to living organism, the patterns
of expression can potentially provide considerable
insights into the metabolic and biochemical mechanisms
in different tissues. The massive amount of research on
mitochondria (eg. a PubMed search with keywords 'mitochondrion' or 'mitochondrial' yields almost 150,000 hits)
have to some extent uncovered the mechanisms responsible for regulation of mitochondrial genes: It has been
found that the D-loop is the origin for transcription of
both strands of the genome, and contains promoter and
binding regions for transcription factors [5], that can serve
to up or down regulate transcription. It has, for example,
been shown that there is a significant regulation of transcription in response to external stimuli [6-8]. However,
due to the nature of the polycistronic transcription, such
genes are expected to be expressed at equal levels and be
jointly up- and down-regulated eg. [7]. Furthermore, degradational mechanisms related to adenylation, stability,
and translation have been linked to post-transcriptional
regulation [9-11], which is expected to lead to uniform
relative expression levels between mitochondrial genes.
This coordinated expression of mitochondrial genes has
been verified experimentally, by eg. [8,12]. Furthermore,
the mitochondrial system is still being investigated for
novel insights into disease mechanics, where a large scale
expression analysis (as presented here) provide useful
insights. To conduct these expression studies, good animal models are desirable, and the pig is an obvious candidate. It is increasingly being used as a model animal [13],
since it is relatively close to humans, both genetically and
physiologically, and thus a better model animal candidate
than, for instance rodents. It has, for example, been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/367

shown that, in sequence space, the pig is closer to human
than mouse [14] and the similar observation can readily
be made for the mitochondrial genomes (data not
shown). Additionally, pig (in contrast to human) provides easy access to tissues from various organs at different
development stages. Also the pig is one of the worlds foremost production animals and any insights gained could
have a large economic impact. Due to the extreme readcoverage of the mitochondrion, this study also provides
predictions of the outcome from the "next"- generation
sequencing methods (ie. 454 sequencing etc.) when
applied to cDNA sequencing (see eg. [15]). These new
methods are characterized by very high throughput and
can therefore generate huge amounts of data, which can,
for example, be used in digital expression studies, in the
manner presented herein.
Here, we use the PigEST resource comprising 41,499 mitochondrial sequences [1,16] to present the first large-scale
mitochondrial expression study comparing different tissues and different developmental stages.

Results
EST assembly
The Sino-Danish pig-genome project generated around
685,000 EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) sequences as
described in [1,16]. The sequences were generated from
one normalized and 97 non-normalized cDNA libraries
covering in total 35 tissues. Details are available online
[1]. The library names and corresponding tissues are listed
in Table 1. The resource contains 41,499 EST sequences
(reads) annotated as mitochondrial sequences. We assembled this set of mitochondrial sequences using the Distiller pipeline [17], and generated 35 contigs (gene
clusters) and 23 single reads. The largest contig contains
11699 reads while the smallest were aggregates of only
two ESTs. This also demonstrate the strength of the Distiller pipeline, as it is able to handle such large (and deep)
clusters. A complete list of contigs along with their gene
match in the mitochondrial genome is provided in Table
2.

To ensure that the ESTs were unique for the porcine mitochondrial genome, the ESTs were matched against the nr
database [18] using BLAST [19]. Except for 232 ESTs
(which are probably still mitochondrial), all 41,499 mitochondrial ESTs matched with smaller E-values to mitochondrial proteins than all other proteins, where the vast
majority (95%) matched the with E-values smaller than
1e - 65 (see Methods for details).
Furthermore, our assembly yield an overall high coverage
of the mitochondrial genome as the contigs covers 15148
positions of 15978 possible, corresponding to 94% of the
mitochondrial genome, and has an average coverage of

observed that there are almost no ESTs originating in
regions outside annotated genes, and we essentially did
not pick up any ESTs originating from a completely

both European (eg. Yorkshire) and Asian (eg. Taihu) pig
breeds were divided into clusters with either European
breed ESTs or Asian breed ESTs based on SNP information. A result of this is that there are five pairs of highly
similar consensus sequences where one sequence match

Table showing which genes the different contigs maps to. Found by comparing the matched (by BLAST) position to the annotations in genbank
entry AF486866. The expression annotation column marks which clusters in the expression clustering the contig has gone into.

Another intricacy is overlapping genes, eg. ATP6 and
ATP8. These were clustered together in the assembly due
to the existence of EST sequences which overlap both
genes, and therefore the clusters essentially represent both
genes.
The phylogenetic decomposed pairs along with the
gene(s) covered are indicated in Table 2.
cDNA library content of mitochondrial genes
An investigation of the proportion of mitochondrial gene
expression in the different cDNA libraries was performed.
We found that cDNA libraries from tissues associated with
high metabolism (eg. muscles) have a larger fraction of
mitochondrial ESTs compared to the total number of
reads from that library as shown in Figure 1. We observed
that the fraction of total reads that originates from the
mitochondrion ranges from roughly 0% up to 22%, with
the majority falling between 2% to 10%. However, the
libraries (8 in total) with the smallest fraction seem to
have unusual low mitochondrial-EST counts, and were

excluded in the following clustering. Furthermore, we
attempted to see if there were any correlations between
the number of counts from a given tissue and diversity of
expression, however we did not find any such patterns.
Differential gene expression
To measure the digital expression of specific genes (contigs) in a given cDNA library, we considered the number
of ESTs relative to the library size (see Methods), which in
general, for high confident annotations (as here), has
been shown to be in agreement with experimental qPCR
results [16]. Using the digital expression values and merging clusters representing the same genes (ie. those that had
been phylogenetically decomposed), we conducted a
hierarchical clustering using the gene-cluster package [20]
(with centroid linkage and correlation as similarity metric). The result is shown in Figure 2. We observed that the
tissues fall in two different main groups: one enriched and
one deprived for cDNA libraries established from tissues
sampled at different developmental stages.

Figure 1
Mitochondrial fraction of Expression
Mitochondrial fraction of Expression. The libraries are ordered according their fraction of EST originating from mitochondria. Selected tissues and their developmental stage are marked by colored bullets.

The confidence of the clustering was assessed using other
clustering schemes and metrics (eg. complete linkage with
euclidean similarity metric). Applying this range of
schemes leads to essentially the same results. However,
the exact relation between the individual libraries were to
some extend shuffled from scheme to scheme, ie. the
order of the libraries change slightly.
Though it is difficult to make any clear distinction
between the genes that are expressed in the tissue clusters,
it appears that 16S RNA and ATPase subunits six and eight
have a higher expression in libraries from muscles and
brain tissues, while there is no systematic pattern in the
remaining libraries.
Furthermore, there is a distinct difference between the
total expression of the different mitochondrial genes. This
is readily apparent from Figure 3(A), where the depth of
the EST coverage is shown. Comparing the depth to the
genes it appears that the depth varies considerable, from
just below ten thousand to zero at gene boundaries. The
differences in expression can be seen in more detail in Figure 3(B), where the normalized depth of coverage is
shown from four representative libraries (see [additional
file 1] for all libraries). We see that the expression pattern

varies greatly for different tissues. Interestingly, we also
find ESTs which map to the D-loop region
(15271–15978), where no genes have been annotated.
This is particularly intriguing considering the recent discovery of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the mouse D-loop
region [2], however we were unable to find good matches
(using BLAST [19] or FOLDALIGN [21] for local structural
RNA alignment) between the putative mouse ncRNAs,
and the porcine D-loop region (from Genbank:
AF486866). Therefore, it has not been possible to conclude whether the porcine D-loop ESTs correspond to any
of the reported mouse D-loop ncRNAs.
Processing of mitochondrial transcripts
The EST data also contains information about post-transcriptional cleavage of the mitochondrial polycistronic
transcript. At any given position on the mitochondrial
genome, the coverage of an EST indicates the existence of
a transcript from that position. Conversely, not finding
any EST reads in a particular region means that the transcript is likely to be rapidly degraded. This is exemplified
by the lack of coverage of the mitochondrial genome
between annotated structures (genes/ncRNAs) as shown
in Figure 3(A).

Coverage of the mitochondrion
Coverage of the mitochondrion. The EST coverage of the mitochondrial genome. (A) The red line show the "depth" of the
consensus sequences, while the green are the "true" coverage of the EST sequences. The lines at the bottom mark the position
of known mitochondrial genes recorded in the genbank entry (Genbank: AF486866). (B) This shows the normalized coverage
(expression) for four representative libraries, for which notable differences are observed. The individual genes are indicated by
the lines at the bottom, and are: (A) 12s rRNA, (B) 16s rRNA, (C) NADH1, (D) NADH2, (E) COX I, (F) COX II, (G) ATP8,
(H) ATP6, (I) COX III, (J) NADH3, (K) NADH4L, (L) NADH4, (M) NADH5, (N) NADH6, (O) CYTB.

The tRNA genes
Due to the EST read coverage patterns of the tRNA genes it
appears that there are two different mechanisms responsible for cleaving of tRNA genes within a polycistronic transcript, each associated either with the 5' or 3' end of the
tRNA transcript. For the 5' end of the tRNAs there is no
read coverage, whereas, there is some read coverage of the
3' end (which continues into the downstream protein
coding region). This is in agreement with previous discovery where it was found that 5' cleavage precedes 3' end
cleavage [22]. The fact that we only observe reads that
overlap with the 3' end suggest that cleaving of the 3' end
takes place at a longer timescale, or with a considerable
weaker enzymatic strength (or smaller enzyme concentration) than the 5' cleavage.
The COX I transcript
Inspecting the position-wise EST coverage for the individual genes, we observe that the cytochrome oxidase I (COX
I), (position 5270–6814 in Figure 3) gene differs from the
remaining genes as its central region (position
5800–6000) has a profound dip in coverage with a low
number of ESTs covering this region, see Figure 3(A). This
is even more obvious when looking at the coverage of
COX I in specific libraries (see [additional file 3]).

Quantifying this we have created expression profiles for
the individual libraries, based on the EST coverage along

the gene. The expression profiles were created by calculating the average coverage for each window of 100 basepairs
(from position 5300–6900), thus, each library has 16
numbers linked to coverage of each part of the COX I
gene. These expression profiles were clustered using genecluster [20] resulting in three groups of libraries (see Figure 4).
For the first group (A), we observe the drop in EST coverage (Figure 5(A)), splitting the expression profile in two,
with elevated coverage of the first part of the region,
whereas for the second group (B) (Figure 5(B)) we
observe EST coverage mainly in the region corresponding
to the second part of the region. For the final group (C) a
more uniform coverage is present, (see in [additional file
2], Figure 1). Furthermore, we observe that group A has an
over-representation of developmental libraries, whereas
groups B and C contains an over-representation of muscle
libraries (see Figure 4). Furthermore, group B contains an
over-representation of brain related libraries. These observations, of developmental and brain/muscle specific patterns, are in accordance with the similar type of
observations made for the mitochondrial genome expression presented above.
We specifically investigated cDNA libraries from brain
and spinal cord for COX I patterns. The sub-clustering of
these libraries (see [additional file 2], Figure 2), shows

Coverage of the COX I gene
Coverage of the COX I gene. The coverage of the COX I gene (position 5270 to 6824). The division into groups, A, B, and
C (not shown) of different libraries were performed by clustering on coverage of the different parts of the gene. (A) A subset
of libraries from group A having the characteristic dip in expression level in the range approximately from position 5800 to
6000. (B) A subset of group B libraries having a general lack of expression within the region ranging from position 5270 to
approximately 5900. The full plots for all groups are shown in [additional file 1], and plots for individual libraries can be found
in [additional file 3].

that libraries established from early developmental stages
(F 50: Ece, Ecc, Ebs) have a distinct group A expression
pattern, while the remaining libraries have groups B and
C pattens. This grouping fits well with the clustering of
expressed non-mitochondrial brain related genes recently
reported [16].
The known mitochondrial processing mechanisms work
on RNA structures. We investigated whether any structural
RNA signals were present in the gene by aligning the gene
from different organisms (worm, fly, human, pig, among
others), and look for compensating mutations. We found
weak signals, but were not able to draw any conclusions
from those.

Discussion
Here, we investigated expression of porcine mitochondrial genes based on in depth EST sequencing. The ESTs
were generated from one normalized and 97 non-normalized cDNA libraries representing in total 35 tissues of
which 24 were from developmental stages [16]. We investigated 41,499 ESTs which yielded an average coverage of
976 EST per mitochondrial nucleotide position. The main
observation was that there was great variability in expression between genes within different tissues and developmental stages. Interestingly, the differences in expression
are particularly profound between (early) developmental
and adult tissues, which in itself might explain why this
previously has been overlooked, since apparently there

are only a limited number of mitochondrial studies
involving many developmental and adult tissues. The
observations of differences in the expression pattern
between genes and between tissues seem also to challenge
the current knowledge of mitochondrial gene expression
[3,4]. Since, mitochondrial genes are transcribed as long
polycistronic transcripts [3,4] and the steady state level of
the mRNAs is governed by degradation [11], the expectation is a fairly regular homogeneous expression pattern
where the relative level of two genes (on the same transcript) would be tissue independent. However, our observations suggest that there exist mechanisms whereby the
individual mRNAs are degraded in a tissue-specific fashion. The mitochondrial genes belonging to respiratory
complex IV are clearly expressed at a higher level in tissues
representing early developmental and new born stages.
Conversely, the genes belonging to complex I are differential expressed in the two groups of tissues (ie. early developmental and adult). This might imply that there is a
mutual dependence between full expression of the mitochondrial genome and adjustment to the adult cardio vascular circulation, ie. the differences are related to
maturation of the energy metabolism. However, as all the
mitochondrial genes are part of the same metabolic pathway, the direct biological interpretation is unclear, though
the differences may suggest that the mitochondria plays a
role in developmental stages beyond simple energy
metabolism.

The differences between gene expression in developmental and adult tissues were also present in COX I. For this
gene we observed (for several cDNA libraries) a sudden
drop of EST coverage within the gene itself, indicating
post-transcriptional processing. Based on the different
expression patterns within the cDNA libraries we conducted a clustering that led to three main patterns of
expression. One main group is dominated by cDNA
libraries from developmental stages, whereas the others
are dominated by brain and muscle libraries. Furthermore, for brain libraries we found COX I expression patterns in agreement with expression patterns from nonmitochondrial genes previously found [10], lending further credibility to our observation.
One could speculate that these patterns represent a cleavage event of the COX I gene. The putative cleavage event
does not appear to be ubiquitous, and seems to be followed by specific degradation of one of the cleave-forms
in some cases. The cleaving might represent a new mode
of regulation of the mitochondrial processes where the
COX I gene is involved. A previous study [23] suggested
regulation of mitochondrial COX genes, emphasizing differences in developmental stages (in agreement with our
study), and suggested a link to the different isoforms of
COX VIa and COX VIIa.
We do not have any biological interpretation of how this
mechanism works. Conventional mitochondrial processing would require the mRNA to be spliced due to secondary RNA structures [22], and though we have found weak
RNA structure signals in the COX I gene (by comparing to
other organisms), we can not conclusively say what mediates this processing. Extensive laboratory work could
hopefully shed some light on the possible biological
mechanism(s), but is beyond the scope of the work presented here.

Conclusion
The discovery of large expression differences between
individual mitochondrial genes is surprising. In particular
the observation that there are large differences between
mitochondrial gene expression in developmental and
adult tissue is of potential great biological interest. Regulation of the mitochondrial genes is expected to some
degree. However, the known mechanisms regulate the
transcription of the full polycistronic transcript, and
degrade the mitochondrial encoded RNA, dependent on
the features of the RNA specie [8,10,24], leading to an
expectation of uniform patterns across tissues. Our work
indicates that there must be some mechanism(s) that
selectively degrades specific gene transcripts in specific tissues. These mechanisms could partly be related to metabolic differences in adult and developmental tissues. Our
study also demonstrates the usefulness of in-depth

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/367

sequencing for expression studies, supporting that expression studies can be carried out by raw sequencing, such as
the recent 454 and solexa parallel sequencing methods
[25,26].

Methods
Data
The source of the EST sequences is described in [16]. The
EST sequences from the sources described therein were
matched against a known pig mitochondrial sequence
extracted from GenBank (acc: AF486866, gi: 33320837)
using blastn [19], and labeled as mitochondrial by using
the build in tool of the Distiller assembler. In total 41,499
ESTs were assigned such label. These ESTs were then
assembled with the Distiller EST assembly pipeline [17],
which uses a backbone Microsoft SQL server. Further,
based on SNP patterns, the contigs were phylogenetically
split into European and Asian strains.

The generated contigs were then matched using blastn
[19]) against a known pig mitochondrial sequence (GenBank: AF486866), thereby locating each sequence at a
specific position on the mitochondrial genome, and
allowing detailed comparison with known mitochondrial
features. Extraction and analysis of the sequence information was performed using a number of SQL and Perl
scripts created for the specific analysis.
The coverage depths were calculated by mapping the EST
sequences to the mitochondrion in a similar fashion to
the contigs, and simply adding the number of ESTs covering that particular position, ie. if two ESTs were mapped to
cover a base on the mitochondrial genome, then the coverage at that positions is two. The counts were normalized
using the total number of library specific reads.
To ensure that the porcine ESTs matched against protein
databases are correct matches to mitochondrial proteins,
we performed some validating checks. We (in lack of a
complete porcine genome) matched human mitochondrial genes to known human genes. We found no matches
with a high similarity, thus indicating that there are no
genes paralogous to mitochondrial genes in mammals.
Furthermore, when matching the porcine ESTs (using
BLAST [19]) against the known nr database [18], all but
232 ESTs hit nr sequences that were clearly identifiable as
mitochondrial with a higher score (lower E-value respectively) than non-mitochondrial sequences. Also 95% of
the ESTs match with E-values smaller than 1e - 65 to the
mitochondrial sequences. For the remaining 232 most
often a mitochondrial sequence matched with comparable E-value as the match with the lowest E-value. Further,
for these ESTs the nr sequence that matched with the lowest E-value had unclear annotations, ie. annotations

which could not conclusively be identified as belonging
to a specific genome. We therefore believe that the 232
sequences represent mitochondrial ESTs, and included
them in the analysis.

Additionally, it is worth noticing that the phylogenetic
decomposition of genes into European and Asian strains,
increase the confidence that all ESTs are mitochondrial, as
others would have been likely to merge into a separate
cluster and be decomposed along with the already decomposed gene-clusters.

. The calcu-

lated expression patterns were then clustered using genecluster [20] (normalizing and centering data, centroid
clustering based on correlations (uncentered)), and visualized with Java Treeview [27,28]. A few libraries were
excluded in the analysis as they seemed to have artificially
low read count, the cut-off was set at an absolute count of
20 ESTs (excluding the libraries: cst, cfe, cmu, cut, sto, cki,
pla, csk). Since 'pla' is the normalized library it was
expected to have a low read count. Furthermore, clusters
that had been phylogenetically split were merged, so that
the expression of one gene represented by two clusters
were taken as the sum of the expression in the clusters.
