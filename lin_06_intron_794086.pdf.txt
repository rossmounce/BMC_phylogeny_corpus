Intron evolution in rice

Abstract

Background

parasite Plasmodium falciparum and other eukaryotes [2].
With respect to intron position within genes, introns within
intron-sparse species as well as single intron genes are preferentially located near the 5' end of the gene [3,4], suggesting
a biased pattern of intron distribution. Indeed, recent studies
on 684 eukaryotic orthologous genes from eight eukaryotic
species of animals, plants, fungi, and protists showed preferential intron loss [5,6] and intron gain [6] in the 3' end of

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R41

information

Introns are under less selection pressure than exons, and consequently, their sequences diverge faster than exons. However, the position of the intron with respect to the protein
sequence is relatively conserved and conservation of intron
position has been observed between distinct eukaryotic lineages throughout about 1.5 billion years of evolution such as
between animal and fungal genes [1] and between the malaria

interactions

Conclusion: We observed that intron evolution within rice following segmental duplication is
largely dominated by intron loss. In two of the five cases of intron gain within segmentally duplicated
genes, the gained sequences were similar to transposable elements.

refereed research

Results: Analysis of segmental duplication in rice revealed that 159 Mb of the 371 Mb genome and
21,570 of the 43,719 non-transposable element-related genes were contained within a duplicated
region. In these duplicated regions, 3,101 collinear paired genes were present. Using this set of
segmentally duplicated genes, we investigated intron evolution from full-length cDNA-supported
non-transposable element-related gene models of rice. Using gene pairs that have an ortholog in
the dicotyledonous model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified more intron loss (49 introns
within 35 gene pairs) than intron gain (5 introns within 5 gene pairs) following segmental
duplication. We were unable to demonstrate preferential intron loss at the 3' end of genes as
previously reported in mammalian genomes. However, we did find that the four nucleotides of
exons that flank lost introns had less frequently used 4-mers.

deposited research

Background: Introns are under less selection pressure than exons, and consequently, intronic
sequences have a higher rate of gain and loss than exons. In a number of plant species, a large
portion of the genome has been segmentally duplicated, giving rise to a large set of duplicated
genes. The recent completion of the rice genome in which segmental duplication has been
documented has allowed us to investigate intron evolution within rice, a diploid monocotyledonous
species.

genes. This is in contrast to an analysis in fungal species in
which no positional bias in intron loss was observed [7].
Introns can be classified into three categories based on location relative to the codon. Introns that do not interrupt the
codons are termed phase 0, while phase 1 introns are located
between the first and second bases of the codon and phase 2
introns are located between the second and third bases of the
codon. It has been reported that eukaryotic genes have more
phase 0 introns than phase 1 or phase 2 introns; on average a
5:3:2 ratio of phase 0: phase 1: phase 2 introns is observed,
although the specific ratio of intron phase appears to be species specific [8-10]. Several explanations have been proposed
for phase bias, including legacy of gene formation in the
intron early theory [11,12], phase bias of intron insertion [13],
and phase bias of intron loss or selection [5,7].
Discovery of both intron loss and intron gain suggests that
these two processes may be ongoing events in evolution. The
rates of intron gain and loss seem to differ greatly among species [2,7,14-16] and the underlying mechanism(s) driving
intron loss and gain are still unknown. With respect to plants,
large-scale computational analyses of intron loss and gain
have been focused on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model dicotyledonous plant [2,4-6,16-20]. With the availability of the
near-complete, high quality rice genome sequence [21] and
uniform, high quality gene annotation for the genome [22],
we have the ability to examine intron loss and gain within a
second plant species that represents the other major clade of
angiosperms, monocotyledonous plants. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that date of divergence of Arabidopsis and rice is
approximately 130 to 200 million years ago (MYA) [23-25].
Interestingly, depending on the completeness and quality of
the genome dataset, as well as the methods and parameters
employed, the rice genome underwent a segmental duplication that involved 15% to 62% of the genome [25-29] and
occurred approximately 70 MYA [25,27], with the exception
of the top arms of chromosomes 11 and 12, which underwent
a more recent duplication estimated at 5 MYA [27].
Segmental duplication in rice provides the opportunity to
study intron gain and loss within a subset of genes that have
recently diverged. In this study, we report on the evolution of
introns within coding sequences (CDS) after segmental duplication in rice. Through our examination of segmentally duplicated genes, we anticipated that we would identify more
intron gain or loss events than for non-duplicated genes due
to the accelerated rate of intron loss or intron gain in duplicated versus orthologous genes, as reported previously in two
malaria parasites [30]. Other advantages of investigating segmentally duplicated genes are that the age of the duplication
is approximately 70 MYA [25,27], which is within the approximately 100 million years divergence limit for investigating
recently gained introns [31,32], and that segmentally duplicated blocks are more reliable than individually duplicated
genes for this type of analysis. Furthermore, we could exploit

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R41

the phylogeny of rice with A. thaliana, a model dicotyledous
plant with a near-complete genome sequence, as the outgroup to readily classify 'intron loss' and 'intron gain' events
between the two duplicated rice genes.

Results
Rice segmentally duplicated blocks
Previous analyses of segmental duplication in rice used
sequence datasets that contained a substantial portion of
unfinished genome sequence and lacked refined structural
and functional annotation of the genes [25-29]. Thus, we
repeated the analysis of segmental duplication using a set of
pseudomolecules (about 371 Mb total) that contain 98% finished sequence and had been annotated for genes both at the
structural and functional level [22]. Depending on the maximum distance permitted between collinear gene pairs, 25.9%
to 53.4% of the rice genome could be identified as segmentally
duplicated (Table 1). Using a maximum distance of 200 kb
between collinear gene pairs, a total of 149 segmentally duplicated blocks were identified (Additional data file 1). The largest block had 287 pairs of duplicated genes between
chromosomes 11 and 12, consistent with the more recent
duplicated reported between the top arms of these two chromosomes [27]. These 149 blocks covered 159 Mb (42.8%) of
the 371 Mb genome and contained 21,570 of the total 43,719
non-transposable element (TE) related genes (49.3%) in the
rice genome. Of these 21,570 genes, 5,567 were retained
within the blocks and corresponded to 3,101 pairs of segmentally duplicated genes distributed across all 12 chromosomes
of rice (Additional data file 2), with chromosomes 1 and 5 having the largest number of duplicated gene pairs (656 pairs).
An increase in genome coverage within the duplicated regions
was observed if the maximum distance permitted between
collinear gene pairs was expanded from 200 kb to 500 kb, 1
Mb, or 5 Mb, whereas a much smaller percentage of the
genome was covered if the maximum distance was limited to
100 kb (Table 1). Previous studies on segmental duplication in
the rice genomes reported that 15% to 62% of the rice genome
had undergone segmental duplication [25-29], consistent
with our analyses of duplication within the rice genome. As
we wished to examine intron evolution within segmentally
duplicated genes and there was little difference in percent of
the genome identified as duplicated using a maximum distance of 500 kb, 1 Mb, and 5 Mb between collinear gene pairs,
we utilized the intermediate estimate of segmental duplication that we obtained using 200 kb as the maximum distance
permitted between collinear gene pairs. Thus, our subsequent
analyses report on duplicated genes with a maximum distance of 200 kb permitted between collinear gene pairs.

Conservation of exon-intron structure
Within the 43,719 non-transposable element-related gene
models in rice, 140,827 introns within the CDS are present,
with an average length of 385 base pairs (bp; standard

aligned intron positions within all 235 duplicate gene pairs. ‡Intron
loss rate was calculated by (intron loss/(intron loss + conserved introns)) × 100.

A single intron loss, termed an independent intron loss, was
observed in 31 gene pairs as determined by alignment with
the putative Arabidopsis ortholog. However, within these 31
gene pairs, 34 introns in total were lost as for 3 gene pairs,
both rice genes underwent separate intron loss events. In
these 31 gene pairs, we observed no bias in intron loss position at the 3' ends of genes (Figure 4). Neither was there a bias
in the position of intron loss in our set of four gene pairs in
which multiple intron losses were observed (data not shown).
Interestingly, in one gene pair (LOC_Os05g02130.1 and
LOC_Os01g74320.1), all seven introns were lost in
LOC_Os01g74320.1, and in LOC_Os07g44140.1, multiple
consecutive introns at the 3' end of the gene were lost (see
Additional data file 3).

information

To determine whether the incongruence was due to intron
gain or loss, we used the putative orthologous gene from Arabidopsis for the gene pair. From our set of 36 gene pairs with
validated alignments, we identified 31 gene pairs with an
intron loss(es) (43 intron losses in total), one gene pair with a
single gained intron, and four gene pairs in which both intron
loss and gain were observed (6 intron losses and 4 intron

gains). An example of intron loss is shown in Figure 2. In this
example, the third intron of LOC_Os07g49150.1 was lost as
shown by the comparison to the duplicated rice gene model
LOC_Os03g18690.1 and the putative ortholog from Arabidopsis At4g29040.1. Alignments of all of the 36 gene pairs
with their orthologs from Arabidopsis are displayed in Additional data file 3. The length of the lost introns (226 bp, std
206) was shorter than the average intron length in the rice
genome (385 bp, std 470). The distribution of the length of
the lost introns and gained introns and the frequency of the
length of the 33,011 fl-cDNA supported (FLS) rice introns (see
Materials and methods for detail) are shown in Figure 3.

deviation (std) 470) and an average GC content of 37.5%. Out
of the 3,101 pairs of segmentally duplicated genes, 281 pairs
had at least one intron that passed the manual review for fulllength (fl)-cDNA support and single isoform. In total, 2,573
introns were present within these 281 gene pairs and had a
similar length distribution (average 315 bp) and GC content
(36.9% GC) to those found throughout the genome. We found
that 197 of the 281 pairs (70%) had completely conserved
exon-intron structure in the coding region (958 intron positions in the alignments), that is, the intron number, position,
and phase were identical among the duplicated genes (Figure
1). The other 84 pairs (30%) had incongruent exon-intron
structure. To eliminate the possibility that the incongruence
was due to an aberrant alignment, these alignments were
manually checked. Only introns surrounded by reliable alignments and only pairs with a putative orthologous gene from
Arabidopsis were further investigated. Thus, 48 alignments
were excluded and a total of 36 pairs of genes (137 intron positions within the alignments) that showed potential intron loss
or intron gain were investigated further.

Intron loss rate at phase 0, 1, 2
Previous reports on intron loss suggested a phase bias [5]. To
investigate phase bias in intron loss, we first examined intron
phase distribution within the rice genome using a set of
introns (33,011 total) derived from the coding regions of
6,046 rice gene models that were supported with fl-cDNA evidence, had no alternative splicing isoform, and had at least
one intron within the CDS. The phases of the coding introns
were distributed as phase 0 (57.3%): phase 1 (21.5%): phase 2

Example of intron loss. Multiple alignment of the two duplicated rice genes
(top; LOC__Os03g18690.1, LOC_Os07g49150.1) and their putative
orthologous Arabidopsis gene (bottom; At4g29040.1) suggests that the
third intron of LOC_ Os07g49150.1 was lost. Yellow inserts indicate
conserved introns across the three genes while red indicates lost intron.

(21.2%), comparable to the distribution reported previously
in plants (62: 17: 21) [1].
To examine whether there was a bias in the phase of intron
loss in segmentally duplicated genes in rice, we examined the
34 independently lost introns and excluded genes with multiple intron losses. The frequency of intron loss at phase 2 was
higher, but not statistically significant, than intron loss at
phase 0 and 1 (Table 2; χ2 test P value = 0.155). Randomization tests showed that intron loss at phase 2 was unexpectedly
high (P value = 0.06) and intron loss at phase 0 was unexpectedly low (P value = 0.08).

Rare 4-mers in the exonic sequence at the donor splice
site of lost introns
Previous studies indicated sequence composition preferences
surrounding splice sites [13,33]. As our sample size was small,
we restricted our analysis of nucleotide composition surrounding the splice site to the nearest four nucleotides (4mers); a total of 31 gene pairs with an independent intron loss

The sum of the ranks (SoR) of the exonic 4-mers flanking the
donor splice site of the lost introns (observed SoR = 6,737)
was very significantly lower than expected (expected SoR =

(34 total introns) were investigated to determine the exonic
nucleotide composition flanking each pair of lost and retained
introns (Figure 5). We observed that the 4-mer usage flanking
all rice introns was dependent on intron phase (Additional
data file 4 and 5). For example, ACAA occurs at the exon
donor splice site 70, 17 and 110 times at phase 0, phase 1 and
phase 2, respectively. To determine if intron loss is independent of the nucleotide composition of the exon sequence flanking introns, we compared the 4-mers flanking lost introns
with those flanking the corresponding retained introns, as
well as with the 4-mers flanking all rice introns. To this end,
the exonic 4-mers flanking the donor and acceptor splice sites
of the lost and retained introns were each attributed a rank,

0.013; Wilcoxon's signed rank test). The rank distributions of
4-mers flanking the acceptor splice site did not differ significantly between lost and retained introns (P approximately
0.069).

Source of gained introns
Two out of the five gained introns showed several matches to
known rice transposon sequences. The intron of
LOC_Os12g02840.1 had a significant hit to a putative Ty1copia subclass retrotransposon protein (82% identity over the
entire intron). A large portion of the other gained intron
(LOC_Os12g37660.1; 430 bp out of 741 bp) was highly similar (92% identity) to Oryza sativa transposon Rim2-M341
(BK000935) [34]. To ascertain if any of the five gained
introns had inserted into other regions of the genome, we
searched the five gained introns against our set of 12
pseudomolecules. Three of the gained introns did not match
any sequence in the rice genome except itself. For the gained
intron in LOC_Os12g02840.1, three high quality matches
were detected: to the entire intron of LOC_Os11g03070 (98%
identity, putative function of sodium/hydrogen exchanger
family protein), which is another segmentally duplicated gene
of LOC_Os12g02840.1 from the 5 MYA duplication event;
82% identity to the entire intron of LOC_Os10g05450 (annotated as a hypothetical protein); and 82% identity to the
entire intron of LOC_Os06g36500 (annotated as retrotransposon protein, putative, Ty1-copia e subclass). For the second
gained intron (LOC_Os12g37660.1), a large portion (approximately 400 bp) matched to numerous regions throughout
the pseudomolecules. Of the 64 top alignments to the gained
intron within LOC_Os12g37660.1 (approximately 95% identity, approximately 400 bp in length), 54 were in intergenic
regions and 10 were within introns of genes, all of which
lacked fl-cDNA support (3 hypothetical proteins, 3 expressed

proteins, 2 transposable-element related proteins, and 2
known proteins).
We examined these five cases of intron gain further by examining homologous genes from other plant species. With the
exception of one case, the gained intron was clearly a straightforward insertion into one of the rice gene pairs (Additional
data file 6). For LOC_Os3g16960.1, the gained intron was
observed in the maize and sorghum homologs, but absent in
the Arabidopsis and poplar homologs. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation for the data is a single insertion into one
of the rice duplicates prior to the divergence of rice, sorghum,
and maize (data not shown).

Discussion

Intron loss and gain are two important processes in evolution.
We observed more genes with intron loss than gain after segmental duplication in rice. We estimated the rates of intron
loss and gain after the segmental genome duplication in rice.
Allowing p to be the proportion of non-conserved introns
between duplicated genes, we have p = 54/(137 + 958) =
0.0493, where 54 is the number of non-conserved introns,
137 is the total number of the aligned intron positions within
the 36 gene pairs that have intron loss and gain, and 958 is the
total number of aligned intron positions within the 197 conserved gene pairs. Given that intron loss and acquisition are
rare events, the expected rate of intron loss and gain can be
estimated under the simple Poisson model and calculated as:
Dint = -ln (1 - p) = 0.0506

If we estimate t = 70 MYA for the rice genome duplication
[25,27], we estimate that the rate of intron gain and loss is:
µ = Dint/2t = 0.0506/(2 × 70 × 106) = 3.61 × 10-10 per intron
per year

µloss = 3.61 × 10-10 × 49/(49 + 5) = 3.28 × 10-10 per intron per
year

A previous study involving 684 groups of orthologous genes
reported an intron loss rate in Arabidopsis of 2 to 3 × 10-10 per
year and an intron gain rate of 2.2 to 2.9 × 10-12 per year [16].
Our study, which involved segmentally duplicated genes
within rice, revealed a similar intron loss rate but a higher
intron gain rate, which may be reflective of the reduced evolutionary pressure on duplicated genes. The detection of
transposon-related sequences in two of the five gained
introns suggests that transposable elements may have a role
in intron evolution and is consistent with the increased frac-

tion of transposable elements in the rice genome compared to
Arabidopsis [21].
It is possible that the rate of intron loss and gain differs within
our set of segmentally duplicated genes as it has been
previously reported that the segmental duplication between
the top arms of chromosomes 11 and 12 is recent (within 5
MYA) in comparison to the bulk of the segmental duplication,
estimated at 70 MYA [25,27]. Thus, we determined the dS for
the 233 gene pairs that had a single isoform, were supported
by a fl-cDNA, and had been manually validated (197 gene
pairs with congruent intron structure and 36 gene pairs with
intron loss and/or intron gain). The dS values ranged from
0.03 to 24.86 with a clear peak between 0.6 to 1.4 (data not
shown). Similar rates of intron loss (1.41 × 10-10 per intron per
year) and intron gain (0.94 × 10-11 per intron per year) were
obtained from the calculations performed using a subset of
the 233 gene pairs in which the dS between duplicates was
between 0.6 and 1.4 (117 pairs total with four gene pairs originating from the top arms of chromosomes 11 and 12).
A reverse transcriptase-mediated model in which a segment
of the genomic copy of a gene can be replaced by a reversetranscribed copy via homologous recombination was previously proposed to explain the pattern of intron loss [3,35,36]
and has been further supported by recent genomic analysis of
several species [5,6,15]. The 3' end bias of intron loss is
important evidence for this model as reverse transcriptase is
error-prone and, as a consequence, a high frequency of 5'truncated cDNA fragments are generated. Although we did
not observe a 3' end preference of intron loss, we did find
examples of multiple consecutive intron loss at the 3' end of
genes and even loss of all the introns, which is consistent with
the reverse-transcriptase-mediated model. Lack of power due
to a small sample size (34 lost introns) might be one explanation for the lack of evidence for a 3' bias of intron loss in rice.
Another explanation may be the unusual intron distribution
pattern, which is similar to that of Arabidopsis (data not
shown) in which there is no 5' bias in intron location within
single-intron genes [4]. The other explanation is that the
reverse-transcriptase-mediated model may not be the only
mechanism for intron loss in rice and that intron loss may

occur via genomic deletion as proposed by Cho et al. [37], who
observed no intron loss bias at the 3' end of genes in
Caenorhabditis. However, according to the genomic deletion
model, we would expect some instances of imprecise deletion
of introns, which is not the case in our sample. Therefore, an
unknown recognition signal may exist that allows the exact
deletion of introns in rice.
We did not observe any statistically significant differences in
the frequency of intron losses in different phases. Nor did
examination of nucleotide compositional patterns in the
exons surrounding the splicing site reveal an apparent
pattern in the bi-nucleotide sequence of the exon at the
boundary other than that shown by canonical splice site consensus sequence (AG|GT) in which '|' represents the intron
position (data not shown). Yet conservation of the exon nucleotides adjacent to the exon-intron boundary has been
reported to play an important role in correct splicing [38-40].
Within the four nucleotides at the donor splice site, we
observed that the exon boundary of lost introns had less frequently used 4-mers than their corresponding retained
introns, as well as relative to the sample of all approximately
33,000 introns. Thus, genes with less common exonic
sequence at the donor site may experience splicing inaccuracy
and inefficiency and, consequently, intron loss at these positions may be strongly favored by selection. Alternatively, it is
possible that the less common 4-mers reflect exonic
sequences more prone to direct intron loss, in the case of the
genomic deletion model. Since we did not have a large sample
for each intron phase, our data were insufficient to draw a
correlation between intron loss rate at each phase and the
nucleotide composition of the flanking exonic sequence.

Conclusion

We were able to document intron loss and gain in segmentally
duplicated rice genes with a rate of loss and gain similar to
that observed within orthologous genes across a range of
eukaryotes. While we did not observe preferential intron loss
at the 3' end of genes, we did observe a nucleotide bias within
the exonic sequence flanking the lost introns.

information

To determine whether lost introns in duplicated rice genes
tend to be flanked by rare nucleotide combinations, we compared the frequency distribution of the four nucleotides (4mers) in the exonic sequence that flanked lost introns with
the exonic 4-mers flanking the corresponding retained
introns, as well as with the frequency distribution of the 4mers flanking all introns in the genome. Comparisons were
done independently for 4-mers flanking the donor and the
acceptor ends of introns. The small number of lost introns,
distributed over three intron phases (34 introns, of which 15,
7 and 12 were from phases 0, 1 and 2, respectively) relative to
the total number of 4-mer classes (44 = 256) precludes effective use of standard tests, such as the chi-square test, to compare the distributions. Instead, tests based on rank
distributions were used as described below.

interactions

Duplicated genes with at least one intron were checked to
ensure that they were supported by a fl-cDNA and that no
alternative isoforms existed. Intron positions and phases
were retrieved from the TIGR Osa1 genome annotation database [22]. ClustalW [43,44] with default parameter settings
was run for each pair to obtain a global alignment. Intron
positions and phases were then inserted into the ClustalW
alignment using perl scripts. Alignments with incongruent
exon-intron structure were manually checked to ensure the
introns were supported by reliable alignments. For the ten
amino acids flanking the splice site (five amino acids on each
side), we required that at a minimum, three amino acids had
to be identical and that approximately 60% similarity was
observed.

A total of 233 pairs of duplicated genes, among which 197
pairs have completely conserved introns and 36 pairs show
putative loss and gain of introns, were used in our randomization test. The total number of conserved intron alignment
positions at each phase was counted (P0, 580; P1, 236; P2,
225). The total number of independently lost introns at each
phase was counted (P0, 15; P1, 7; P2, 12). A total of 10,000
iterations were simulated. A total of 34 phases were randomly
generated in each iteration based on the frequencies of the
conserved aligned intron positions at each phase from the 233
gene pairs. The number of lost introns at each phase was then
compared with those generated by simulation.

A total of 43,719 non-transposable element-related rice protein sequences from release 3 of the TIGR Rice Genome
Annotation [22] were used to identify segmental duplication
in rice using an all versus all BLAST search (WU-BLASTP,
parameters "V = 5 B = 5 E = 1e-10 - filter seg) [41]. As alternative splicing occurs in rice and some genes have multiple
splice forms, the largest peptide sequence was used whenever
alternative isoforms existed. Repetitive matches were filtered
using perl scripts to remove low scoring matches within multiple alignment regions that were defined by a high-scoring
segment pair within 50 kb. Segmentally duplicated blocks
were identified using DAGchainer [42] with parameters '-s -I
-D 200000'. which primarily includes self comparisons,
ignores tandem duplication alignments, and sets the maximum distance allowed between two collinear gene pairs to
200 kb. A minimum of six gene pairs was used to define a

Exon 1

Simple phylogeny analysis was used to determine if the
incongruent exon-intron structure was attributable to loss or
gain of an intron. We identified putative orthologous genes by
searching the predicted Arabidopsis proteome (TIGR release
5, [45]) with the predicted rice proteome using blastp (Evalue < 1e-10) and selecting the reciprocal best hit. In the
event we did not identify an ortholog in Arabidopsis via the
reciprocal top match method, we used the best Arabidopsis
match. Using the Arabidopsis genes as the outgroup, we
aligned the rice duplicated gene models to the orthologous
Arabidopsis gene model. ClustalW with default parameter
settings was run for each triplet (the two rice gene models and
their putative Arabidopsis ortholog) and intron positions and
phases were inserted into the ClustalW alignment (Additional
data file 3). Only loss or gain of introns after segmental duplication was examined further. An intron loss was defined if the
intron was present at the same position in only a single rice
gene and the putative Arabidopsis ortholog (referred to as a
retained intron). An intron gain was defined if the intron was
present in single rice gene but absent in the other rice paralog
and the putative Arabidopsis ortholog.

Comparison of 4-mers flanking lost introns versus all introns
A total of 33,011 introns within the coding regions from 6,046
rice gene models that were supported with fl-cDNA, had no
alternative splicing isoform, and had at least one intron
within the CDS were used to determine the 4-mer distribution
in exonic sequences that flank the introns. The four nucleotides that flank the donor and acceptor splice sites of each
intron were extracted and their frequency calculated. For
each intron phase, each 4-mer was given a rank between 1 and
256, to cover all of the 44 nucleotide combinations, with the
lowest frequency having the smallest rank (rank = 1). In this
way, three rank distributions, one for each intron phase 0, 1
and 2, and their attached frequency distributions, were generated for each the donor and the acceptor flanking regions.
We devised a statistic that we call 'sum of ranks', SoR, to
determine if the 4-mers flanking lost introns are less common
than expected by chance. This statistic SoR corresponds to
the sum of the ranks of all introns in a sample, as determined
by their nucleotide composition and phase. The test was conducted as follows: 10,000 pseudo-replicates were generated
by randomly sampling the three rank distribution obtained
for all introns, according to their frequency distribution (that
is, each rank was selected with probability equal to its
frequency). Each pseudo-replicate consisted of 34 sampled
introns, 15, 7 and 12 of which were sampled from the rank distribution of phase 0, 1, and 2 introns, respectively, to preserve
the characteristics of the observed distribution of lost introns.
A SoR value was obtained for each pseudo-replicate to generate the distribution of expected 'sum of ranks'. The SoR for
the 34 lost introns was compared against this distribution to
determine the probability P of obtaining this value by chance.
P is approximately equal to the fraction of pseudo-replicated
with a smaller or equal SoR value.

Comparison of 4-mers flanking lost introns versus retained introns, in
the corresponding duplicate gene
A rank was attributed to each lost intron, based on the composition of its 4-mer and its intron phase, according to the
rank distributions obtained for all 33,011 introns (see above),
to obtain a distribution of ranks for the set of lost introns. A
distribution of ranks for the set of retained introns was
obtained in a similar way. The two distributions were compared using a Wilcoxon's signed rank test. This procedure was
done for both donor and acceptor flanking sequences.

Identification of the source elements of gained introns
Sequences of the five gained introns were searched against
the NCBI non-redundant database and were further searched
against all the 12 rice pseudomolecules [22]. Significant hits
were manually checked. For each case of a gained intron, we
examined homologous proteins from three plant species with
substantial genome sequence: maize, sorghum, and poplar.
Using the protein sequences of the ten rice genes with gained
introns, we searched the TIGR Assembled Zea Mays (AZMs)
sequences, which are assemblies of gene enrichment

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R41

sequences [46,47], TIGR Assembled Sorghum Bicolor (ASBs)
which are assemblies of gene enrichment reads from sorghum
[48], and contigs from the poplar genome project [49]. All of
the top hits from maize and sorghum had >70% similarity at
the protein level with the rice proteins. Gene models were
predicted by running the ab initio gene finder FGENESH [50]
on the maize, sorghum and poplar genomic sequences. We
used ClustalW with default parameter settings to align the six
proteins (two rice proteins and the homologous proteins from
Arabidopsis, maize, sorghum and poplar) and inserted the
intron positions/phases into the ClustalW alignment.

Determination of substitutions per site
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site (dS) between each of the two rice duplicates was estimated by maximum likelihood, using the codon-based substitution model of Yang et al. [51] as implemented in codeml of
PAML, version 3.15 [51,52]. Codeml was run using in pairwise
mode (runmode = -2), with codon equilibrium frequencies
estimated from average nucleotide frequencies at each codon
position (codonFreq = 2). Given the estimated age of approximately 70 MYA for the polyploidization event in rice [25],
and the estimated substitution rate in synonymous sites of
approximately 6.5 × 10-9/site/year [53], rice paralogs resulting from this polyploidization event are expected to differ on
average by approximately 0.9 synonymous substitution per
site.
