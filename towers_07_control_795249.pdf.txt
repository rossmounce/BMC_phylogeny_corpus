Abstract
The control of retroviral infection by antiviral factors referred to as restriction factors has become
an exciting area in infectious disease research. TRIM5α has emerged as an important restriction
factor impacting on retroviral replication including HIV-1 replication in primates. TRIM5α has a
tripartite motif comprising RING, B-Box and coiled coil domains. The antiviral α splice variant
additionally encodes a B30.2 domain which is recruited to incoming viral cores and determines
antiviral specificity. TRIM5 is ubiquitinylated and rapidly turned over by the proteasome in a RING
dependent way. Protecting restricted virus from degradation, by inhibiting the proteasome, rescues
DNA synthesis, but not infectivity, indicating that restriction of infectivity by TRIM5α does not
depend on the proteasome but the early block to DNA synthesis is likely to be mediated by rapid
degradation of the restricted cores. The peptidyl prolyl isomerase enzyme cyclophilin A isomerises
a peptide bond on the surface of the HIV-1 capsid and impacts on sensitivity to restriction by
TRIM5α from Old World monkeys. This suggests that TRIM5α from Old World monkeys might
have a preference for a particular capsid isomer and suggests a role for cyclophilin A in innate
immunity in general. Whether there are more human antiviral TRIMs remains uncertain although
the evidence for TRIM19's (PML) antiviral properties continues to grow. A TRIM5-like molecule
with broad antiviral activity in cattle suggests that TRIM mediated innate immunity might be
common in mammals. Certainly the continued study of restriction of viral infectivity by antiviral
host factors will remain of interest to a broad audience and impact on a variety of areas including
development of animal models for infection, development of viral vectors for gene therapy and the
search for novel antiviral drug targets.

Background
The control of viral infection by intracellular antiviral proteins referred to as restriction factors has become an
important and challenging focus of infectious disease
research. A clearer understanding of the role of restriction
factors in immunity and the control of retroviral replication promises to reveal details of host virus relationships,
allow improvement of animal models of infection, iden-

tify targets for antiviral therapies, and further facilitate the
use of viral vectors for clinical and investigative gene delivery. The tripartite motif protein TRIM5α has recently
emerged as an important restriction factor in mammals
blocking infection by retroviruses in a species-specific
way. Early evidence for TRIM5α 's antiviral activity
included the species-specific infectivity of retroviral vectors, even when specific envelope/receptor requirements

were obviated by the use of the VSV-G envelope. Notable
examples include the poor infectivity of certain murine
leukemia viruses (MLV) on cells from humans and primates and the poor infectivity of HIV-1 on cells from Old
World monkeys [1-3]. The notion that a dominant antiviral factor was responsible was suggested by the demonstration that the block to infection could be saturated, or
abrogated, by high doses of retroviral cores [4-6]. The
putative human antiviral factor was named Ref1 and the
simian factor Lv1 [1,6]. TRIM5α was identified in 2004 by
screening rhesus cDNAs for those with antiviral activity
against HIV-1 [7]. Shortly after, several groups demonstrated that Ref1 and Lv1 were encoded by species-specific
variants of TRIM5α [8-11]. TRIM5α therefore represents a
hitherto undescribed arm of the innate immune system,
blocking infection by an incompletely characterised
mechanism. Its expression is induced by interferon via an
IRF3 site in the TRIM5 promoter linking it to the classical
innate immune system [12].
The tripartite motif
TRIM5 has a tripartite motif, also known as an RBCC
domain, comprising a RING domain, a B Box 2 domain
and a coiled coil [13,14]. The RING is a zinc-binding
domain, typically involved in specific protein-protein
interactions. Many RING domains have E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity and TRIM5 can mediate RING dependent
auto-ubiquitinylation in vitro [15]. B boxes are of 2 types,
either B-box1 or B-box2 and TRIM5 encodes a B-box2. Bboxes have a zinc-binding motif and are putatively
involved in protein-protein interactions. The two types of
B-box have distinct primary sequence but similar tertiary
structures and are structurally similar to the RING
domain. This suggests that they may have evolved from a
common ancestral fold, and perhaps have a similar function, such as ubiquitin ligation [16,17]. It is also possible
that B-Boxes contributes to ligation specificity, ie have E4
activity [16,17]. The coiled-coil is involved in homo- and
hetero-multimerisation of TRIM proteins [14,18]. TRIM5
exists as a trimer with the coiled coil facilitating homo and
hetero multimerisation with related TRIM proteins [1820].

TRIM5 RNA is multiply spliced, generating a family of isoforms, each shorter from the C terminus. The longest,
TRIM5α, encodes a C terminal B30.2 domain that interacts directly with viral capsid and determines antiviral specificity [18,21,22]. The shorter isoforms, TRIM5γ and
TRIM5δ, do not have B30.2 domains and act as dominant
negatives to TRIM5α and rescue restricted infectivity when
over-expressed [7,23]. It is assumed that the shorter forms
form heteromultimers via the coiled coil and titrate the
viral binding B30.2 domains. It is therefore possible that
TRIM5's antiviral activity is regulated by splicing.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/40

The B30.2 domain comprises a combination of a PRY
motif followed by a SPRY motif [24]. Whilst SPRY
domains are evolutionary ancient, B30.2 domains, found
in butyrophilin and TRIM proteins, appeared more
recently. There is unlikely to be a precise function for
B30.2 domains, rather they are involved in protein-protein interactions such as substrate recognition. A series of
TRIM5 mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the TRIM5
B30.2 domain determines antiviral specificity and defined
the specific regions of the B30.2 responsible
[18,21,22,25,26]. In vitro capsid/TRIM5 binding assays
have been developed and these demonstrate that, at least
in the case of wild type TRIM5α proteins, binding correlates well with the ability to restrict infection [27,28].
The recent solution of the structure of several B30.2
domains allows us to interpret the conservation and variation between TRIM5 B30.2 domains [29-31]. The structures indicate that the B30.2 core is formed from a
distorted 2-layer beta sandwich with the beta strands in an
anti-parallel arrangement. Extending from the core are a
series of loops and it is these surface loop structures that
vary between the TRIM5 sequences from each primate and
between different B30.2 domains of TRIM5 homologues.
The loops form 3 or 4 variable regions, all of which appear
to impact on antiviral specificity [32]. The TRIM21 structure in complex with its ligand, IgG Fc indicates that there
are 2 binding surfaces, one in the PRY (V1) and 1 in the
SPRY (V2-V3) and this is likely to be true for TRIM5α.
TRIM5 and the Red Queen
B30.2 mutagenesis studies, as well as sequence analysis of
TRIM5α from related primates, suggested that the differences defining anti-viral specificity are concentrated in
patches in the B30.2 domain [33]. The patches, which correspond to the surface loops, have been under very strong
positive selection as evidenced by a high dN:dS ratio.
dN:dS ratios have been calculated by comparing TRIM5
sequences from primates and comparing the number of
differences that lead to a change in the protein sequence
(non synonomous, dN) to the number of differences that
do not (synonomous, dS). A high ratio indicates positive
selection and is evidence of the host-pathogen arms race
known as the Red Queen hypothesis [34]. This phenomenon, named after Lewis Carroll's Red Queen who claimed
'It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same
place', refers to the selection driven genetic change that
occurs in both host and pathogen as each alternately gains
the advantage. Whether selection pressure on TRIM5 has
been from pathogenic retroviruses or from endogenous
retroviruses and retrotransposons is unclear. The relative
youth of lentiviruses, as compared to other retroviruses
and endogenous elements, is thought to preclude them
from impacting on TRIM5 selection, although the discovery of an endogenous lentivirus in rabbits [35] has

recently extended their age from less than 1 million years
to greater than 7 million years and it certainly seems possible that this age will extend further as we better understand lentiviral history.
The other side of the Red Queen's arms race is the change
in the retroviral capsids to escape restriction by TRIM5.
TRIM5 molecules can generally restrict widely divergent
retroviruses including gamma retroviruses as well as lentiviruses. For example Agm and bovine TRIMs restrict MLVN, HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVmac [36-38]. It is now clear that
retroviral capsid structures are conserved and capsid hexamers are found in both lentiviruses and gamma retroviruses [39,40] so we imagine that the TRIMs recognise a
conserved shape. Paradoxically, point mutants can often
escape strong restriction. MLV-N CA R110E escapes
human, simian and bovine TRIMs, SIVmac CA QQ8990LPA escapes rhesus and squirrel monkey TRIM5s and
HIV-1 G89V escapes owl monkey TRIMCyp [1,38,41-44].
It therefore remains unclear how TRIM5 can be effective if
a small number of changes in CA can rescue infectivity,
especially given that retroviral capsid sequences appear
quite plastic.
The antiviral mechanism
We are beginning to understand TRIM5α 's antiviral
mechanism. TRIM5α is trimeric [19,45] and interacts with
hexameric capsids [46]. TRIM5α is ubiquitinylated within
cells and is rapidly turned over by the proteasome in a
RING domain dependent way suggesting that autoubiquitinylation might drive this process [15,47]. We imagine
that the rapid turnover of TRIM5α and presumably
TRIM5α-virus complexes leads to an early block to infection, before the virus has had the opportunity to reverse
transcribe (Figure 1A). This notion is supported by the
observation that inhibition of the proteasome during
restricted infection allows the virus to reverse transcribe,
when it is protected from degradation [48,49] (Figure 1B).
However, infection is not rescued by inhibition of the proteasome, indicating that the TRIMα-virus complex
remains uninfectious, even when protected from degradation. How exactly TRIM5α renders the virus uninfectious
remains unclear, but it may be that by simply coating the
core with multivalent complexes TRIM5α trimers are able
to disrupt the rearrangement/uncoating and or trafficking
required to continue to the nucleus and to integrate.
Other possibilities include TRIM5α rapidly uncoating
incoming HIV-1 capsids. In fact, this has been observed
using an assay of capsid density to measure uncoating
[46,50] and it will be interesting perform this assay in the
presence and absence of proteasome inhibitors to address
whether the proteasome has a role this process. Proteasome independent degradation of capsids by TRIM5α has
also been described [51]. Importantly, DNA circles remain
inhibited, even in the absence of proteasome activity, sug-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/40

gesting that the restricted TRIM5α-virus complex cannot
access the nucleus. [48,49] (Fig 1). It is possible that these
observations indicate several independent antiviral activities of TRIM5α but we prefer the interpretation that there
are several possible fates for a restricted virion. It may be
degraded by the proteasome, it may inappropriately
uncoat, or it may remain intact, make DNA but not have
access to the nucleus. The different fates are likely to be
influenced by factors such as the particular virus, the particular TRIM5α as well as virus dose and TRIM5α expression levels and the cellular background. Understanding
the contribution of these activities to restriction by
TRIM5α will require further study but the field continues
to make steady progress.
A Role for Cyclophilin A in restriction
The relationship between Cyclophilin A (CypA) and HIV1 has a long history. CypA is a peptidyl prolyl isomerase
that performs cis/trans isomerisation of proline peptide
bonds in sensitive proteins. CypA interacts with gag in
infected cells leading to its recruitment into nascent HIV1 virions [52,53]. Recent data has shown that CypA also
interacts with incoming HIV-1 cores in newly infected
cells and that this interaction is more important for infectivity than that occurring as cores assemble [42,54-56].
This may be because only about 10% of the capsid molecules in the core recruit a CypA molecule into the virion
[52,53]. CypA performs cis/trans isomerisation at CA
G89-P90 on the outer surface of the capsid [57,58] and
this leads to changes in infectivity. In Old World monkey
(OWM) cells CypA decreases HIV-1 infectivity, but only in
the presence of TRIM5α [59-61]. Blocking CypA activity
using the immunosuppressant competitive inhibitor of
CypA cyclosporine A (CSA), or reducing CypA expression
with small interfering RNA, reduces the susceptibility of
HIV-1 to restriction by OWM TRIM5 and rescues HIV-1
infectivity.

In human cells the interaction between incoming HIV-1
cores and CypA is important for maximal infectivity. Preventing this interaction reduces HIV-1 infectivity independently of TRIM5 expression [59,62]. It is suspected
that in the absence of CypA activity, HIV-1 gets restricted
by a TRIM5 independent antiviral activity. This suspicion
is borne from the fact that the requirement for CypA is
both cell type, and species, specific, suggesting that CypA
is not required simply to uncoat the core. This notion is
further supported by the observation that CA point
mutants close to the CypA binding site such as HIV-1 CA
A92E or G94D appears to lead to restriction of HIV-1 in
human cells [55,56]. A92E or G94D infectivity is reduced
in some human cell lines but not others and strikingly,
infectivity is rescued by inhibition of CypA. It is possible
that these mutants become sensitive to human restriction
factor(s) and that the interaction between the factor and

A putative mechanism for restriction of retroviruses by
A putative mechanism for restriction of retroviruses
by TRIM5α. (Panel A) TRIM5α is autoubiquitinylated in a
RING dependent way and rapidly turned over by the proteasome [47]. If it encounters incoming sensitive retroviral
cores then they too are recruited to the proteasome and
destroyed, before the virus has the opportunity for significant reverse transcription. (Panel B) If the virus/TRIM5α
complex is protected from destruction, by inhibiting the proteasome, then the virus can reverse transcribe [48, 49].
Infectivity is not rescued however, indicating that the virus/
TRIM5α complex is uninfectious. How TRIM5 renders the
virus uninfectious remains unclear.

the virion is sensitive to the activity of CypA on the peptide bond at P90.
How might CypA impact on recognition of CA by
TRIM5α? One possibility is that in some cases, capsid with
CypA attached may make a better target for TRIM5α. This
possibilty has been discounted on the basis that HIV-1
mutated to prevent CypA binding (HIV-1 CA G89V)

remains restricted by TRIM5α from Old World monkeys
[59,61]. Importantly, this mutant is not restricted by
TRIM-Cyp, which relies on the CypA domain to recruit it
to the HIV-1 capsid [43]. A second possibility is that
recruitment of TRIM5α to capsid is improved by the prolyl
isomerisation activity of CypA on HIV-1 capsid. Prolyl
isomerisation has been shown to regulate protein-protein
interaction in diverse biological systems including the
control of cell division by cdc25C and signalling by the Itk
receptor. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyses the cis/trans
isomerisation of a proline peptide bond in cdc25C.
Cdc25C activity is regulated by phosphorylation and since
its phosphatase PP2A only recognises the cdc25C trans
isomer, Pin1 activity leads to dephosphorylation and
cdc25C activation [63]. A similar molecular switch has
been described for Itk signalling and CypA. CypA catalyses
cis/trans isomerisation of proline 287 in the Itk SH2
domain impacting on interaction with phosphorylated
signalling partners and regulating Itk activity [64,65].
NMR measurements have shown that HIV-1 CA contains
around 86% trans and 14% cis at G89-P90 in both the
presence and absence of CypA [57]. However, in the presence of CypA, CA is rapidly isomerised between the two
states [57]. It is therefore possible that OWM TRIM5α
binds preferentially to CA containing G89-P90 in the cis
conformation [59]. In this case, in the presence of
TRIM5α, CypA maintains the percentage of cis at 14%
even as TRIM5α sequesters it from the equilibrium. In this
way the trans form is isomerised to cis and becomes
bound by TRIM5α. Blocking CypA activity would limit
the availability of the cis conformation and therefore
TRIM5α's ability to see the CA, resulting in rescued infectivity. This model is summarised in Fig 2. CypA also
appears to impact on replication of feline immunodeficiency virus in feline and human cells although whether
TRIM5 is required for this remains unclear [66].
Surprisingly in the New World species owl monkey a
CypA pseudogene has been inserted into the TRIM5 coding region, replacing the viral binding B30.2 domain with
CypA, leading to a molecule called TRIMCyp [43,44]. This
restriction factor strongly restricts HIV-1, SIVagm and FIV
by recruitment of the incoming capsid to the RBCC
domain facilitated by interaction between the CypA
domain and the capsid [20,66,67]. Viral infectivity is rescued by inhibition of CypA-CA interactions with CSA
indicating the dependence on CypA binding to capsid for
robust restriction. We assume that at some point in owl
monkey evolution the modification of TRIM5 to TRIMCyp provided a significant selective advantage. We can
only speculate on what might have provided the selection
pressure but a pathogenic virus that recruited CypA is a
possibility. It is worth noting that a TRIMCyp in the
human genome would be a useful antiviral as we face the
current AIDS pandemic.

served the proline rich CypA binding loop and many
encode glycine proline motifs within it. This suggests that
the motifs that recruit CypA are important, conserved and
cannot easily be mutated. The loops and glycine proline
motifs are also conserved in the equine lentivirus EIAV
and the feline FIV [67]. Their purpose however remains
unclear and this loop is not conserved in MLV [40] (Figure

ity in cells mechanism for activity of
A putative from Old World monkeysCypA on HIV-1 infectivA putative mechanism for activity of CypA on HIV-1
infectivity in cells from Old World monkeys. HIV-1
recruits CypA to around 10% of its capsid monomers in
newly assembled cores [52, 53]. When the core enters the
cytoplasm of a target cell it recruits more CypA, which efficiently catalyses cis/trans isomerisation of the peptide bond
at CA G89-P90 [42, 57]. This activity replenishes the cis conformation CA as it is recruited into the restricted complex
with TRIM5α. If CypA activity is reduced in target cells, using
CypA specific siRNA or by inhibiting CypA activity with CSA,
then the OWM TRIM5α cannot interact with the CA, which
is mostly in the trans conformation, and infectivity is rescued
[59-61]. The isomerisation at CA G89-P90 is represented by
squares (trans) changing to circles (cis) on the surface of the
capsid.

The role of CypA in sensitivity to TRIM5, its fusion to
TRIM5 in owl monkeys and its role as a target for immunosuppression implies that CypA might have a general
role in immunity. Viruses are likely to be under considerable pressure to alter their shape and become invisible to
antiviral shape recognition systems such as TRIMs. Molecules, such as CypA, that induce shape changing, may
have an important role in making escape difficult. For
example, HIV-1 appears to be invisible to OWM TRIM5 in
the absence of CypA, but in its presence HIV-1 is strongly
restricted [59-61]. Conversely, HIV-1 is highly infectious
in human cells in the presence of CypA but appears to
become restricted in its absence [42]. It seems that HIV-1
is invisible to human TRIM5 whether CypA is active or not
but becomes restricted by something else in the absence of
CypA activity [59,62]. HIV-1 appears to have adapted to
tolerate CypA activity and this adaptation has made it
dependent on CypA. Why can't HIV-1 simply avoid
recruiting CypA? The answer to that is not clear but a clue
can be found in alignment of the CypA binding region of
lentiviruses (Figure 3). All primate lentiviruses have con-

Polymorphism and TRIM5 in other species
The fact that TRIM5 restricts retroviral infection so
potently, at least in monkeys, has suggested that polymorphism in human TRIM5 might impact on HIV-1 transmission and/or pathogenesis in vivo. Several studies have
addressed this issue and shown at best, only weak association of any particular TRIM5α allele with disease progression [68-71]. Importantly, human TRIM5α is not
polymorphic in the regions of the B30.2 domain known
to impact on viral recognition, and its over expression
does not reduce HIV-1 infectivity by more than a few fold
[7,9,10,72]. Furthermore under in vitro conditions where
rhesus TRIM5 efficiently binds the HIV-1 capsid, the
human protein binds only poorly [46]. It therefore seems
likely that TRIM5 doesn't significantly impact on HIV-1
replication and pathogenesis in humans. Indeed, we
imagine that HIV-1's insensitivity to TRIM5 has been an
important factor in its success as a pathogen in humans.
Conversely the TRIM5 gene in rhesus macaques and sooty
mangabeys is relatively polymorphic with a number of
polymorphisms occurring in the variable loops that dictate antiviral specificity. Indeed, expression of these alleles
in permissive feline cells followed by challenge with retroviral vectors derived from HIV-1, SIVmac MPMV or MLVN demonstrated that the different alleles have slightly different antiviral specificities [72].

The antiviral activity of TRIMs in mammals other than primates remains less well characterised. A bovine TRIM
(BoLv1) with broad anti retroviral activity suggests that
TRIM-mediated restriction of retroviruses is widespread
amongst mammals [37,38]. BoLv1 is closely related to primate TRIM5 genes suggesting that they are orthologs
derived from an ancestral antiviral TRIM. Cattle encode at
least 4 genes closely related to TRIM5, in addition to
homologs of TRIM34 and TRIM6. The fact that one of
these proteins has antiviral activity supports the notion
that these genes are derived from an ancestral sequence
with antiviral activity. It is likely that antiviral TRIMs will
be identified in more mammals soon. Indeed, antiviral
TRIMs are probably responsible for the poor infectivity of
cells from pigs and bats to MLV-N and those of rabbits to
HIV-1 [1,3,5,73].

Are there other TRIMs with antiviral properties?
Protein families arise through the duplication of ancestral
gene sequences and therefore members of a family share
common ancestry. Human TRIM5 lies on chromosome
11 within a group of closely related TRIMs, comprising
TRIMs 5, 6, 34 and 22, which have presumably arisen by
gene duplication. These TRIMs, as well as TRIMs 1, 18, 19

and 21 have no, or relatively weak, antiviral activity
against a panel of distantly related retroviruses including
HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVmac, EIAV and MLV [20]. Whether this
is because they have an alternate function or whether they
are simply not active against this selection of viruses is difficult to say. It is worth noting however that comparison
of the sequences of these TRIMs from primates shows that

reduces permissivity to vesicular stomatitis virus and
influenza A [84,85]. These data, along with the observation that PML expression is stimulated by type 1 interferon, strongly support an antiviral role for TRIM19
(PML). Interestingly, PML does not have a B30.2 domain
suggesting that it interacts with target viruses in a different
way to TRIM5α interacting with retroviruses.

for HIV-1 (1M9C) [94] and MLV (1UK7) [40] were superimposed using pairwise structure comparison [95].

unlike TRIM5, TRIMs 6, 22 and 34 do not have strongly
selected B30.2 domains, suggesting that they have not
been under the same selection pressures as TRIM5 [74].
There is an increasing body of evidence, gathered over
many years suggesting that TRIM19, otherwise known as
PML, may have antiviral activity. PML exists in subnuclear structures called PODs, ND10 or PML bodies and
are of unclear function. It has long been known that a
number of diverse viruses including influenza, SV40 and
papilloma virus form replication complexes in close association with PML bodies, reviewed in [75,76]. Infection by
other viruses, including herpes viruses and adenoviruses,
causes degradation of PML protein and dispersal of the
body components. The molecular details of PML degradation by herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) have been partially
solved. The HSV-1 protein ICP0 is responsible for inducing proteasome dependent degradation of PML, and HSV1 deleted for this protein replicates poorly, leaving PML
bodies intact [77-80]. Importantly, mutant HSV-1 (ICP0) becomes almost fully infectious if PML expression is
reduced using RNA interference, indicating that an important function of ICP0 is to eliminate PML [81]. An antiviral role for PML is also suggested by a real time
microscopy study demonstrating that PML is recruited to
incoming HSV-1 (ICP0-) replication complexes [82]. Such
active recruitment is strongly suggestive of an antiviral
response. Furthermore, reduction of PML expression
increases permissivity of human cells to human cytomegalovirus infection [83], and over-expression of PML

Further data supporting an antiviral role for TRIM proteins comes from expression studies in which TRIMs are
expressed in permissive cells and the modified cells tested
for permissivity to infection by retroviral vectors. Such
studies have demonstrated weak anti-retroviral activity of
TRIM1 from African green monkeys and Owl monkeys
against MLV-N [9]. It is also worth noting that a particular
TRIM protein can impact on viral infectivity by influencing the activity of another antiviral TRIM protein. For
example, expression of TRIM34 can reduce the antiviral
activity of TRIM5 presumably via heteromutimerisation
mediated via the coiled coil [20]. This observation suggests a complex mechanism of regulation and generation
of alternate antiviral specificities through heteromultimerisation. Whether further TRIMs have antiviral activity
remains largely untested. The fact that TRIMs 10, 15, 26,
27, 31, 38, 39, 40 are associated with the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6 [86] and the observation that the expression of most of these genes is upregulated by influenza infection [87] suggests that they
might have a role in immunity.
TRIM20, otherwise known as pyrin, presents as an intriguing antiviral possibility. Polymorphism in the TRIM20
B30.2 domain can cause familial Mediterranean fever, a
disease characterised by recurrent attacks of fever and
inflammation. Sequencing TRIM20 from a variety of primates revealed that many encode the disease causing
mutations as wild type sequence [88]. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggested episodic selection in the B30.2
domain, similar to that seen for TRIM5, suggesting the
intriguing possibility that viral infection underlies this
disease. Rather strikingly in 2001 these authors suggested
that the B30.2 domain of pyrin might interact directly
with pathogens and that the mutations are counter evolutionary changes selected to cope with a changing pathogen [88]. Such a model is remarkably close to what we
believe to be true for TRIM5, retroviruses and the Red
Queen 6 years later.
Concluding Remarks
Just as we considered that the important aspects of TRIM5
biology had been largely described, the Ikeda lab
described tantalising findings that make a complicated
subject significantly more complicated [89]. They show
that rhesus TRIM5 causes degradation of gag in infected
cells. Importantly this activity is independent of the C-ter-

minal B30.2 domain suggesting that it acts via an alternative specificity determinant, perhaps the coiled coil. It is
worth noting that APOBEC3G has also been described as
being able to restrict infection of both incoming as well as
outgoing HIV-1 [90,91]. It may be therefore that such
dually active restriction factors are not uncommon.
Whether the study of host factors influencing viral infection will translate into improvements in antiviral therapy
in the foreseeable future remains uncertain. However, it is
likely to allow the improvement of animal models for
HIV/AIDS as we enhance our understanding of the viral
and cellular determinants for viral replication and disease
[92]. This work is also likely to improve our ability to
transduce cells, therapeutically and experimentally, with
viral gene delivery vectors, particularly poorly permissive
primary cells and stem cells. It certainly promises to
remain an active and exciting field in infectious disease
research.
