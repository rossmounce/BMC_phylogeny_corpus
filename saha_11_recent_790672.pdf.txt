Abstract
Background: Opportunistic Infections (OIs) and co-infections are the major cause of deaths amongst HIV infected
individuals and this mostly depends upon the risk factors, type of exposure and geographic region. The
commonest types of infections reported are tuberculosis, chronic diarrhoea, oral candidiasis, herpes simplex virus-2,
cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Due to the scarcity of OIs data available from this region,
we had designed a study to determine the frequency of different OIs amongst HIV seropositive patients.
Methods: Analysis of the different spectrum of OIs/Co-infections were carried out with 204 HIV sero-positive
patients (142 males and 62 females) who visited the HIV/AIDS Apex Clinic in a tertiary care hospital from March
2006 to March 2009. The CD4+ count was estimated using FACS Calibur, the routine smear test, serology, nested
RT-PCR and DNA sequencing were carried out to determine the different OIs.
Results: In this study, HIV seropositive patients were mostly from middle age group (31-40 yrs) with CD4+ counts
in majority of symptomatic AIDS patients below 200 cells/mm3. The common co-infections/opportunistic infections
were OC (53.43%), CD (47.05%), HSV-2 (36.76%), TB (35.29%), CMV (26.96%), HBV (15.19%) and HCV (7.35%). Dual
infections, like HSV-2 & CMV (15.38%), HSV-2 & TB (14.61%), HSV-2 & oral candidiasis (24.61%) and CMV & oral
candidiasis (14.61%) were significant in follow-up patients. Triple infections were also common e.g., TB, CD, OC
infection occurring frequently in about 14.21% of the study population. Multiple infections like OC, TB, CD amongst
the viral co-infected patients with HSV-2, HCV, CMV and HBV are also reported in this study. The genotyping
analysis of the HCV co-infected HIV individuals shows that two belonged to HCV genotype 1 and 8 belonged to
genotype 3.
Conclusions: A wide spectrum of OIs were observed amongst HIV-infected patients in the HIV/AIDS Apex Clinic.
Oral candidiasis, CD, CMV and HSV-2, were the common OIs in those patients. This study aims to provide a clearer
picture regarding infections occurring amongst HIV seropositive individuals so that the scientific findings could be
translated into sustainable prevention programmes and improved public health policies.

Background
Currently 2.27 million people are infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an estimated adult
prevalence rate of 0.31% in India alone [1]. OIs lead to frequent morbidity and mortality which shortens the life
span of people with HIV infections and requires expensive
treatments which becomes a burden for a developing
country like India. Timely initiation of prophylaxis of OIs,
quick recognition and treatment are the only economically
viable options. It has been reported that decrease in CD4+
count is partially responsible for major immunodeficiency’s that leads to most of the OIs among HIV infected
individuals [2]. The most common OIs/co-infections in
HIV infected individuals are tuberculosis, chronic diarrhoea, candidiasis, HSV-2, CMV, HCV and HBV.
HIV is the most important known risk factor that promotes progression to active TB in people with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. TB can occur at any point
in the course of HIV infection. An individual infected
with HIV has 10 times more risk of developing TB
when compared with a normal person. TB prevalence
have also increased 3-5 times in Sub-Saharan Africa in
the last decade and HIV seroprevalence has been
reported to be about 75% among those patients [3]. It is
also very common in India [2,4] due to the similar conditions prevailing here. Oral candidiasis (OC) is a collective term for a group of oral mucosal infection caused
by a fungal pathogen candida. It is one of the earliest
manifestations of HIV disease and is also a strong predictor of AIDS-related illness or death [5]. Majority of
HIV patients usually suffers from chronic diarrhoea
(CD) during their period of HIV infection [6]. It is
defined as persistence of diarrhoea beyond four weeks.
It may be due to either opportunistic or non opportunistic agents, for opportunistic infections leading to
chronic diarrhoea a severe, chronic and frequent gastrointestinal disease persists whereas a non-opportunistic
agent causes acute but treatable diarrhoeal illness.
Studies related to the occurrence of HSV-2 and CMV
among HIV patients from this part of the world are
rare, paucity of accurate and relevant data also persists
which necessitates the need for better surveillance and
public health monitoring. Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV2) co-infection is associated with increased genital HIV
shedding, which may increase transmissibility of HIV
[7]. Genital infection by herpes simplex virus type-2
(HSV-2) is considered one of the major cofactors
favouring both sexual transmission and acquisition of
the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) [7].
CMV infection is more prevalent in populations at risk
for HIV infection; approximately 75% of injection drug
users and >90% of homosexual men who are infected
with HIV have detectable IgG antibodies to CMV [8].

Majority of the persons infected with HIV also may
occasionally develop severe hepatobiliary problems pertaining to which liver complications like hepatitis B and
hepatitis C are on the rise [9,10]. It is reported that
among the total cases of HIV infections worldwide, 2-4
million are estimated to have chronic hepatitis B Virus
(HBV) co-infection, while 4-5 million are co-infected
with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [11]. Co-infection rates of
HBV and HCV in HIV patients varies worldwide and
largely depends upon the geographic location, risk
groups, the type of exposure involved and the socioeconomic condition of that particular region. In Europe
and United States of America, HIV-HBV co-infection is
around 6-14% [11,12]. It has been shown in recent studies that post highly active anti-retroviral therapy
(HAART), HCV related liver disease mortality has
increased significantly and is the most common cause of
non-AIDS related death amongst HIV patients [13].
There are reports related to HBV and HIV co-infection
from different parts of India [9,10] but no such detailed
study on HCV and HIV co-infection except some serological observations [14,15].
Timely intervention of OIs not only helps HIV positive
persons to live longer but it also helps to prevent transmission of OIs from spreading to others in the community.
Since these opportunistic infections and co-infections have
a vital role in clinical presentation and is one of the most
frequent cause of mortality among HIV patients, the main
objective for this study was to elucidate the current
frequency and type of the major opportunistic infections/
co-infections in HIV seropositive patients in a HIV/AIDS
Apex Clinic of a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata. As there
were no reports of hospital based HIV and HCV co-infections from this region, we also included this in our study
for better management and greater awareness of this
dreadful disease and its complications.

Methods
Collection of Sample

Over a period of three years i.e., from March 2006 to
March 2009, 204 cases of HIV seropositive patients
were included in this study from a HIV/AIDS Apex
Clinic in IPGME & R, Kolkata, India. Informed consent
was obtained before undergoing any kind of test, in case
of child patients, consent from their parents were
obtained. These patients were from different parts of the
Eastern and North Eastern region of India. The HIV
testing was performed according to the guidelines of
National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), India [1].
Only those HIV seropositive patients willing to participate were included in this study. HIV seropositive’s
partner were also included after subsequent HIV diagnosis, if they were willing to participate in this study.

Diagnosis of Opportunistic Infections

DNA Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis

The diagnosis of the diseases was done according to the
guidelines of Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
guidelines (CDC) [2]. The patients who had more than
two weeks of cough, blood in sputum and chest pain
were only considered for the tuberculosis test. The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) was confirmed by microscopic
examination of the sputum using acid fast bacilli (ZiehlNeelsen) staining followed by chest radiogram before
coming to a conclusion.
For the conformation of chronic diarrhoea, solely clinical presentations were considered and no microscopic
or other types of investigations pertaining to the causal
agents were investigated. Oral candidiasis was detected
by the clinical presentations and microscopic examination of the yeast forms from the region of oropharynx
and this was the sole criterion for the identification of
the disease [16].
Viral infections were detected using serological diagnosis like ELISA for HSV-2 (IgM; Equipar, s.r.l, Italy),
HBV (ELISA, HBsAg; Biomerieux, Boxtel, Netherlands),
CMV (IgM, Equipar, s.r.l, Italy) and HCV (Hepnostica
HCV ultra; Biomerieux, Boxtel, Netherlands) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The 256 bp nested PCR amplified products of 5’non
coding region of HCV genome were gel purified using
Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany)
according to manufacturer’s protocols. The purified products were directly used for DNA sequencing in an
automated DNA sequencer (3130XL, ABI, USA) using
Big-Dye terminator 3.1 Kit (ABI, USA). The phylogenetic analysis was done using MEGA 4 software and
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method.
The sequences were aligned with the representative
number of sequences for each major genotype selected
from the Gene Bank database with the help of multiple
sequence alignment software (MEGA 4). 181 bp (nt-240
to -60) of the 256 bp product was used for phylogenetic
analysis. The evolutionary history was inferred using the
Neighbour-Joining method [18]. The optimal tree with the
sum of branch length = 0.30199712 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (2000 replicates) is
shown next to the branches [19]. The tree is drawn to
scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of
the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic
tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the
Maximum Composite Likelihood method [20] and are in
the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All
positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). There
were a total of 133 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [21]. Pairwise
comparisons for evolutionary distance for percent nucleotide homology were made by Jukes-cantor algorithms.

Detection of HCV RNA

The HCV seropositive samples were subjected to RNA
extraction using QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Detection
of HCV viral RNA was done by Nested RT-PCR based on
5’non coding region (NCR) of HCV genome, the primers
used in this study were according to Bukh et al [17]. One
tube RT-PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl
containing 2 μl of Taq 10× buffer II (ABI, USA), 0.8 mM
of dNTPs (ABI, USA), 1.5 mM of magnesium chloride,
5 mM of dithiotheritol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA),
0.25 μM of the forward and reverse primers, 0.4 U of
AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA), 0.5 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (ABI, USA) and 2 μl of RNA. The RTPCR conditions were 42°C for 60 minutes followed by
94°C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 94°C, 55°C
and 72°C for 1 minute each, the final extension step was
carried out at 72°C for 5 minutes in an ABI 9700 thermocycler. Followed by nested PCR in a total volume of 25 μl
containing 2.5 μl Taq 10× buffer II, 0.8 mM of dNTPs,
2.5 mM of magnesium chloride, 0.25 μM of forward and
reverse primers and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (ABI,
USA), and 2 μl of the first round RT-PCR product. PCR
conditions were similar as of the RT-PCR, only the RT
step i.e, 42°C for 60 was omitted, a band at 256 bp in a
1.5% agarose gel stained in ethidium bromide was
observed in gel documentation system (Biorad, USA) in
case of HCV positive samples.

Determination of CD4

The CD4+ counts of the HIV seropositive persons were
estimated using FACS CALIBUR flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, California, USA). Standard dual colour

immunophenotyping method was performed using
whole blood.
Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis was performed using student’s t
test. The Null Hypothesis was also tested and a P value
< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Mean, median and mode were also estimated.

medical practioners or approached on their own, largely
the patients came to the clinic with common complaints
of fever, weight loss and diarrhoea, and subsequent investigation revealed them to be HIV seropositive. Due to the
clinic being a tertiary care centre hence the true proportional representation of the population could not be
accurately ascertained. Only two individuals had HIV
infection from blood transfusion, whereas rest all had
been infected by heterosexual means.

Demographic profile

Epidemiological Findings

In this study, HIV positive patients were mostly from
middle age group (Figure 1),CD4+ counts in majority of
symptomatic AIDS patients were below 200 cells/mm3
(Figure 2A). Most of the patients were from age group
20-40 (79.9%) years. Male gender were predominant with
142 (69.60%) representatives and 62 (30.4%) females, the
age group ranges from 9 yrs to 66 yrs with the age group
31-40 yrs (43.62%) having the largest number of affected
individuals (Figure 1). Migrant labourers were the commonest occupational group followed by truck drivers and
constituted a considerable proportion of the study. These
migrant workers were largely employed as goldsmiths in
Mumbai and Pune (Western region of India). The most
identifiable risk factors were extra-marital heterosexual
contact and had history of exposure to commercial sex
workers. Women were generally the victims of their husbands. None of the patient was reported homosexual
practices. Generally most of the cases were referred by

In this study, all patients were infected with HIV-1, out
of 204 patients examined 109(53.43%, median CD4+
counts 160 cells/mm3) were co-infected with oral candidiasis,96 (47.06%, median CD4+ counts 167 cells/mm3)
had chronic diarrhoea, 75(36.76%, median CD4+ counts
204 cells/mm3 ) were HSV-2 IgM positive, 72(35.29%,
median CD4+ counts 137 cells/mm3) had tuberculosis,
55 (26.96%, median CD4+ counts 147 cells/mm3) were
CMV IgM positive, 31 (15.19%, median CD4+ counts
147 cells/mm 3 ) were HBsAg positive and 15 (7.35%,
median CD4+ counts160 cells/mm3 ) were positive to
HCV antibody (Figure 2B and 3). 74.5% of the coinfected cases were accompanied with fever. Seventeen
(8.33%, median CD4+count 481 cells/mm3) individuals
had no history of co-infection (3 male and 14 female),
among the three affected males, one had been infected
from his wife. All the asymptomatic HIV positive female
patients were infected from their husbands.

Multiple Co- Infections

The important observations of this study were dual, triple
opportunistic infections and co-infections among the HIV
seropositive individuals. The most frequent dual infections
were CD and OC 28.92%, OC and TB 25.49%, CD with TB

Page 5 of 9

21.08%, HSV-2 and OC 19.11%, HSV-2 and CMV 14.21%,
HBV and HSV-2 3.92%, HBV and CMV 2.94%, HCV and
CMV 1.96%, HCV and HSV-2 1.47%, and the least prevalent one was HCV and HBV 0.49% infection which showed
only one case (Figure 4A). The commonest triple infection
were OC, TB, CD at 14.21%, HSV-2, CMV, OC at 10.78%,
HSV-2, CMV, CD at 8.34% and HSV-2, CMV, TB at 6.86%
respectively (Figure 4B). Apart from this, the trend of infection with TB, OC and CD among HCV, HBV, HSV-2 and
CMV co-infected individuals is shown in Figure 4C.
The frequency of occurrence of multiple viral infection
were less when compared to that of the other bacterial
and yeast infection i.e., among the HBV infected population only 29.03% had HSV-2 co-infection, 16.12% had
CMV co-infection and 3.2% had HCV co-infection; among
HCV infected population 6.67% had HBV co-infection,
20% had HSV-2 co-infection and 26% had CMV co-infection respectively (Figure not shown).
There was only one toxoplasmic encephalitis case diagnosed at a later stage of an AIDS patient and subsequently
the patient died. Three patients showed Varicella Zoster

Virus (VZV) clinical presentation but was not confirmed
with serology. There was not a single case of Pneumocystis
sp. related pneumonia in the study population.
HCV Genotyping

Among the 15 HCV seropositive HIV individuals, 10
were HCV RNA positive (4.90%, median CD4 count 74
cells/mm3) (Figure 5A). On the basis of DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, two out of ten samples
were classified as HCV genotype 1 (20%) and eight

Page 6 of 9

belonged to HCV genotype 3 (80%) (Figure 5B). There
was no correlation with CD4 count and HCV genotype.

Discussion
In our study, majority of HIV seropositive patients were
(31-40 yrs) in their active sexual stage and most of them
were detached from their family for long time. Most of
the males were migrant workers or drivers, most female
HIV patients were their life partner. Transfusion related
HIV acquisition was only ~1% in our study.

Oral candidiasis associated with HIV infection occurs
frequently and could be considered as an initial manifestation of the disease. Oropharyngeal candidasis (OPC)
has been reported to occur in 50 to 95% of all HIVpositive persons at some point during their progression
to full-blown AIDS [22]. Oral candidiasis may be considered as a clinical surrogate for severe CD4+ depletion.
However, the absence of OC does not necessarily exclude
severe immunosuppression. Our data indicates that
53.43% of the individuals were affected with OC. A noteworthy observation in the present study is that the
patients who presented HIV associated oral candidiasis
without any type of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) had a
median CD4+ count lower than 200 cells/mm3, an associated inverse relationship between CD4+ count and the
prevalence of OC could be inferred. The debilitating
impact of HIV infection on mucosal Langerhan’s cells
and CD4+ population were most probably central to the
increased pathogenesis of mucosal candidiasis in HIV
patients [23]. These findings could definitely help our
clinicians to use OC as a helpful tool for the diagnosis
and detection of progression of HIV in a resource poor
country like India. Thus the present study depicts OC as
the predominant OIs amongst HIV affected individuals
in this part of India.
Major studies from India [24-27] reports chronic diarrhoea, gastrointestinal infection as the most common
OIs associated with HIV patients but our study revealed
it to be the second major complication following oral
candidiasis whose median CD4+ count was estimated to
be around 167 cells/mm3 . Organisms causing chronic
diarrhoea are usually self-limiting but as the end stage
of AIDS approaches they are known to be life threatening too. Patients with multiple intestinal infections
accompanied with profound and persisting diarrhoea
have low CD4+ T-cell counts. The number of undiagnosed patients with CD in a developing and resource
poor country like ours is on the increase and needs to
be properly addressed for better management of HIV
related mortality. Immunodeficiency increases the risk
of having opportunistic parasites and diarrhoea; therefore it is imperative that health care providers specifically evaluate their HIV infected patients for diarrhoea
to increase their quality of life. Since the study had certain limitations with regard to the detailed examination
of the stool samples hence the exact etiological agents
were not verified as common etiologic agents have
already been reported from various parts from India
including from this region [28].
TB is one of the most common type of OIs associated
with HIV as reported in a study conducted in northIndia [2] and this may be associated with endemic factors such as malnutrition, poor hygiene, poverty,
migrant population and unemployment which are widely

Page 7 of 9

prevalent in this area. In our study, 35.29% of the
patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis which was
not surprising as TB (median CD4+, 137 cells/mm3) is
one of the disease which is increasing in India and our
data is in accordance with the other published data
from this part of India [21,22]. The whole process of
diagnosis of TB was well planned so that the number of
false negatives could be reduced as the detection of TB
among HIV individuals is very difficult. The patients
having more than 2 weeks of cough, chest pain and
blood along with sputum underwent the sputum microscopy test, the negative samples underwent a generalized
antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks so that the other causative agents responsible for the outcome of such type of
disease other than TB could be cured, after the antibiotic treatment they again underwent the sputum microscopy test and if the results came out to be negative,
chest radiograph was used for the final conclusive result.
This process of detection helped us to minimize errors
to a large extent.
Herpes simplex virus-2 (36.76%) infection was the most
common viral co-infection and this was largely due to the
common risk factors. The characteristic features of HSV2 infection are symptomatic reactivation and asymptomatic viral shedding. Infection with HSV-2 is a lifelong
burden as the virus becomes permanently latent in the
nerve node ganglion corresponding to the site of inoculation. HSV-2 induces cell mediated immune response
hence a higher titre of median CD4+ counts of 204 cells/
mm3 was observed in our findings. The arguments pertaining to the co-infection of HSV-2 and HIV includes
sexual accusition, transmission which includes disruption
of mucosal integrity and in vivo association between the
genital RNA load of HIV and DNA load of HSV-2
amongst both asymptomatic and symptomatic shedders
[29]. Patients with AIDS, progressive loss of immune
function, and in particular loss of cell-mediated immunity, permits CMV reactivation and replication to begin;
asymptomatic excretion of CMV in urine could be
detected in approximately 50% of HIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/mm3
[30]. In our study, 26.96% of the patients reported having
cytomegalovirus co-infection with median CD4+ counts
147 cells/mm3. Cytomegalovirus is reported to be largely
dependent upon the type of transmission of HIV and
seen largely to occur among homosexuals and since our
study reports no cases of homosexuality hence this low
frequency of occurrence could be validated [31]. Not a
single patient was found with Kaposi’s sarcoma which is
very frequent with CMV infection.
The available literature suggests a very variable rate for
the co-infections of HCV and HBV among the HIV subjects [9,32,33]. It has been stated that HIV has a direct
effect on the life cycle of HBV and also a very

Saha et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:116
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/116

impounding effect on the host’s ability to clear the infection and if this was to be true then we could expect more
number of cases with severe chronic liver damage and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus the public health
aspect must be looked into as this could become one of
the realities of the future as the very cause and effect of
immunodeficiency on HBV has not been studied yet [10].
Our data shows 15.19% of these populations were
infected with HBV (HBsAg) and this corroborates with
other published data from India [14]. Since HBsAg signifies the active form of the virus hence HBV DNA
detection was not done on HBsAg positive individuals.
The frequency of the HCV infections among our
study group was 7.35% (serology), which is fairly constant with other findings from this part of the world
[10] whereas, active HCV infection i.e., HCV RNA positive was 4.90% (median CD4+ count 74 cells/mm 3 ).
There are variable HIV-HCV co-infection reports from
other parts of India which ranges from 4.8% - 21.4% in
Southern part [34,35], 30% in Western India [36] and
the highest is reported from North-East which is about
92% (serology) [15].
Among the ten HCV RNA positive samples, eight
were belonged to HCV genotype 3 and two belonged to
genotype 1 based on DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis of the 5’non-coding region of the HCV genome.
We could not find correlation with CD4+ count and
HCV genotype. History of HCV infection was not transfusion related, probably it may be from other routes of
transmission. HCV genotyping study was considered
because of its great epidemiological significance and has
not been adequately ascertained in Indian context
among HIV population. HCV genotype 3 is the most
prevalent form in Northern and Eastern part of India
[37,38]. In Western region significant difference in HCV
genotype 3 and genotype 1 is not observed [36,38,39]
but in Southern India, HCV genotype 1 is more predominant than Genotype 3 [34,36,38]. Compared to HCV
monoinfection, HCV associated with HIV shows more
rapid progression to cirrhosis, decompensated liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma and sometimes death.
Cirrhosis may suppress the immunity and may affect the
CD4+ count [13]. In our study, median CD4+ count of
HCV (RNA positive) co-infected HIV patients was lowest and this corroborates with other study [13]. In cases
of advanced HIV, HCV ELISA may result into false
negatives and hence the HCV RNA PCR becomes one
of the sole criterions for confirmation or exclusion of
active disease. Quantitative HCV viral load does not
determine the degree of liver damage and hence the
genotyping was performed [39]. Since there is no
detailed documented report of HCV infection among
HIV patients in tertiary care hospital from this region,
so a study was needed for better HCV management

among HIV infected individuals and this is first such
report. Similar to HBV the immunosuppressive action of
HIV is also not known on HCV and the further implications which could be associated with it needs to be
ascertained.

Conclusions
Opportunistic infections continues to be one of the most
universal complication of HIV infected patients and the
public health efforts to curb HIV infection should be in
the limelight, as the very importance of precluding and
treating HIV related co-infections in India is likely on the
increase. The overall frequency of opportunistic infections
is very high (53.43%) when compared to data from other
parts of India (24, 25, 31, 35). This study depicts a broad
range of co-infections associated with HIV infected persons and could be used very aptly in any such resource
limited country like India where these data could help
improve the public health status of the population. A complete comprehensive population based data comprising
four different regions or a larger region of India must be
initiated to properly verify the actual cause of this very
variable type of occurrence of OIs and make database of
infected individuals with HIV so that a clear picture of the
OIs is obtained.
There were some limitations of the study as we looked
into the clinical presentation of the disease in a hospital
and accordingly the incidence rate; prevalence rate could
not be deducted from these findings as they were solely
from a hospital and not from a general population. We
also did not look into the type of multiple drug resistant
strains present among the tuberculosis patients within
the spectrum of study subjects. The different types of
etiological agents causing diarrhoea were also not looked
into. Development of resistance remains under studied
and hence more works needs to be done in this area.
There is an urgent need to interpret the scientific findings into sustainable prevention programmes and
improve public health policy. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV associated OIs forms an integral component for maintaining and improving the living
standards of those infected. More research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions needs to be done
in resource poor settings like India. Our findings aim to
help our clinicians to use OIs for early diagnosis and
detection of the progression of HIV infection
