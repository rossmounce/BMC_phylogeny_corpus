Abstract
Background: Accurate identification of novel, functional noncoding (nc) RNA features in genome
sequence has proven more difficult than for exons. Current algorithms identify and score potential RNA
secondary structures on the basis of thermodynamic stability, conservation, and/or covariance in sequence
alignments. Neither the algorithms nor the information gained from the individual inputs have been
independently assessed. Furthermore, due to issues in modelling background signal, it has been difficult to
gauge the precision of these algorithms on a genomic scale, in which even a seemingly small false-positive
rate can result in a vast excess of false discoveries.
Results: We developed a shuffling algorithm, shuffle-pair.pl, that simultaneously preserves dinucleotide
frequency, gaps, and local conservation in pairwise sequence alignments. We used shuffle-pair.pl to assess
precision and recall of six ncRNA search tools (MSARI, QRNA, ddbRNA, RNAz, Evofold, and several
variants of simple thermodynamic stability on a test set of 3046 alignments of known ncRNAs. Relative to
mononucleotide shuffling, preservation of dinucleotide content in shuffling the alignments resulted in a
drastic increase in estimated false-positive detection rates for ncRNA elements, precluding evaluation of
higher order alignments, which cannot not be adequately shuffled maintaining both dinucleotides and
alignment structure. On pairwise alignments, none of the covariance-based tools performed markedly
better than thermodynamic scoring alone. Although the high false-positive rates call into question the
veracity of any individual predicted secondary structural element in our analysis, we nevertheless identified
intriguing global trends in human genome alignments. The distribution of ncRNA prediction scores in 75base windows overlapping UTRs, introns, and intergenic regions analyzed using both thermodynamic
stability and EvoFold (which has no thermodynamic component) was significantly higher for real than
shuffled sequence, while the distribution for coding sequences was lower than that of corresponding
shuffles.
Conclusion: Accurate prediction of novel RNA structural elements in genome sequence remains a
difficult problem, and development of an appropriate negative-control strategy for multiple alignments is
an important practical challenge. Nonetheless, the general trends we observed for the distributions of
predicted ncRNAs across genomic features are biologically meaningful, supporting the presence of
secondary structural elements in many 3' UTRs, and providing evidence for evolutionary selection against
secondary structures in coding regions.

Background
One of the major findings of genome sequencing has
been that the primary sequence of roughly 5% of the
human and mouse genomes is under purifying selection,
indicating functionality [1]. However, less than 2% is
accounted for by mRNA exons. The remaining 3% presumably encompasses cis-regulatory sequence, signals for
transcriptional initiation, termination, RNA processing,
chromosomal features such as replication origins, and
genes encoding ncRNAs such as tRNA, snoRNA, miRNA,
and others.
Accurate computational identification of novel ncRNA
genes and mRNA structural elements (as opposed to
known classes) in genome sequence has proven to be
more difficult than identification of exons, due generally
to a limited and highly variable sequence signature [2]. In
bacteria, which have compact genomes, searching for
transcription initiation signals [3], primary sequence conservation [4], and base composition [5] have been fruitful
approaches to de novo ncRNA discovery; however, these
features alone are unlikely to be sufficiently specific in
large eukaryotic genomes.
Most, albeit not all, functional ncRNA features possess
some degree of secondary structure, either as part of the
precursor or the functional RNA itself. Following the
assumption that structural RNA sequences should be
more thermodynamically stable than random permutations of the same base composition, thermodynamic stability (ΔG) is an additional feature than can be
incorporated into genomic searches for new ncRNAs.
Major classes of structural RNAs have lower ΔG than corresponding shuffled sequences. It has been debated
whether ΔG is a sufficiently accurate discriminant when
only a single (i.e. unaligned) sequence is analyzed [6];
however, ΔG has been proposed to be comparable or
superior to more sophisticated algorithms (see below)
when applied independently to segments of a pairwise
alignment [7]. What is clear is that disruption of dinucleotides in the random permutation dramatically affects the
perceived precision of predictions [7,8], presumably
because dinucleotide contributions are a key determinant
of stability of an RNA fold.
Covariance (i.e. scoring for apparent compensatory mutations in secondary structures in sequence alignments) is
also now a widely-accepted approach to ncRNA discovery.
A variety of recently-described ncRNA search algorithms
(QRNA [9], RNAz [10], ddbRNA [11], MSARI [12], and
Evofold [13]) score for covariance to discriminate structural RNA elements (Table 1). Success of covariance
requires that sequences be sufficiently conserved to
achieve a correct alignment, yet contain some nucleotide
changes in order to assess compensatory mutations. An

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/33

advantage of methods that do not utilize covariance is
that they can identify structures common to sequences
without high sequence similarity [14] and apparently
even sequences that fail to align at the primary sequence
level [15]. However, even considering both covariance
and thermodynamic stability, some classes of ncRNAs
appear to be more difficult to detect than others [16].
To our knowledge, most ncRNA search tools have not
been assessed or compared systematically by an independent laboratory. Moreover, previous studies using
these tools for genomic scanning have acknowledged that
the false-positive rate is high and cannot be determined
accurately [13,16]. Here, with the goal of independently
evaluating these tools for de novo discovery of ncRNA elements in a genomic context, we have compiled an extensive sequence and alignment data set, and developed a
new shuffling algorithm for pairwise alignments (shufflepair.pl) that simultaneously preserves key features of the
alignment. We used these sequences, as well as real and
shuffled genomic sequence, as input for a panel of published tools for discovery of novel ncRNAs. We also evaluated whether different schemes utilizing only
thermodynamic stability could discriminate real from
shuffled ncRNAs, and examined the output of a subset of
tools on a genomic scale.

Results
A test set for comparing ncRNA-finding tools
We tested the ncRNA search tools (Table 1) on a test set
derived by extracting 3046 genomic alignments corresponding to known eukaryotic ncRNAs and mRNA structural elements (see Methods for details). The positive test
set is available at [17] and in Additional files 7 and 8, and
consists of 1303 miRNA, 213 tRNA, 225 Box H/ACA
snoRNA, 581 Box C/D snoRNA, 227 snRNA, 182 UTR regulatory element alignments, in addition to 94 other structural ncRNA alignments (such as 7SK, RNAse P, and
RNAse MRP) and 220 non-structural RNA alignments
(such as H19, Hoxa-11 antisense transcript, XIST) for a
total of 282,221 bases. We generated the alignments by
mapping all available ncRNA sequences from human,
mouse, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae, to
available UCSC pairwise genomic alignments (see Methods).

To obtain negative controls, we created 100 sequence
shuffles of each sequence alignment using a new shuffling
algorithm, shuffle-pair.pl (Figure 1, see Methods for
details and Additional file 3 for the program itself), to
simulate the problem of finding bona fide structural elements against a much larger background that resembles
true genomic alignments in as many features as possible.
Briefly, the shuffle-pair.pl algorithm randomizes the columns of the alignment while preserving conservation,

Description

MSARI

Developed for use with 10–15 multiple alignments, looks for compensatory mutations near bases predicted to pair
in secondary structure. Uses RNAfold [33] to predict which bases pair and analyzes neighbouring nucleotide pairs in
a 7 nt window for presence of compensatory mutations.
Uses two variables to assess ncRNA potential in two or more sequence alignments: a z-score and an SCI score. The
z-score is a measure of the thermodynamic stability of the reference sequence relative to shuffled variants of the
same sequence. RNAz samples the z-scores using machine learning from pre-computed z-scores covering a range
of sequence lengths and sequence compositions, rather than re-computing z-scores for each sequence. The SCI
(structure conservation index) is an indirect measure of structural similarity among the individual sequences in the
alignment based on their individual folding energies compared to the folding energy of their consensus structure.
This term also incorporates a covariance factor, rewarding compensatory mutations. RNAz uses machine learning
to classify alignments as ncRNAs on a combination of their z- and SCI scores. Scores reflect how far the alignment is
from the ncRNA line of separation in an SCI-z plane.
ddbRNA scans for compensatory mutations in conserved stem loops found within two or more sequence
alignments. It counts the number of compensatory mutations in all possible hairpins of the alignment and compares
that count to a distribution of counts from shuffled variants of the alignment. The score output is the number of
standard deviations above the mean count of the shuffled variants (negative scores indicate more compensatory
mutations in the shuffled variants).
QRNA is a probabilistic algorithm that predicts pairwise sequence alignments as belonging to one of three classes:
coding (COD), noncoding (RNA), or other (OTH). The RNA model incorporates two components: a stochasticcontext free grammar (SCFG) to estimate a distribution of probabilities over potential structures and a pair-Hidden
Markov Model to predict the probability that the structures were evolutionarily selected on the basis of a
compensatory substitution pattern in the alignment. The logoddspostRNA score reflects these two components
and is used as the primary discriminant score in this study.
Evofold computes the probability that the observed sequence alignment was generated under selection for a
functional RNA (structural) versus evolutionary divergence of non-structural sequence. It uses the traditional SCFG
algorithm CYK without explicitly defining emission probabilities over observed aligned bases, but rather uses an
evolutionary model (Felsenstein) to compute the probability of the column given a phylogenetic tree. The functional
RNA (fRNA) model comprises both a structural and non-structural components. The structural component
computes the probability that two columns pair (i.e. occur in stems) whereas the non-structural component
computes the probability of observing single-nucleotide columns.
This is in an iterative script that utilizes hybrid-ss-min (MFOLD variant with updated handling of partition function
calculations) [34] and shuffle-pair.pl to generate z-scores that are indicative of selection for thermodynamic stability
over the expected stability of a random sequence with an identical dinucleotide composition. The z-score is the
number of standard deviations that the actual stability is below the mean stability of 100 shuffles (using shufflepair.pl). Higher z-scores indicate apparent selection for structural stability. The thermodynamic stability is calculated
only for the reference strand, while the alignment constrains the shuffling.
Same as zMFOLD except RNAfold [35] is used to predict thermodynamic stabilities.
z-scores are computed with zRNAfold for both strands in the alignment and added for a final z-score.
Predicts selection for structure by comparing the minimum free energy of a consensus structure to shuffles of the
alignment. Scores are multiplied by -1 to scale with other algorithms where higher scores indicate structure.

gaps, and dinucleotides in both sequences, all of which
may contribute to scoring obtained from at least a subset
of algorithms tested [6,8,13]. It shuffles by swapping the
middle bases between trinucleotides that are identical at
positions 1 and 3 as described [8] with the additional constraints of swapping in aligned trinucleotides and maintaining conservation and gaps of the alignment. The
algorithm finds all swappable positions that preserve the
criteria above and then randomly selects two bases to
swap. It keeps track of positions that have been swapped
and continues shuffling until it runs out of positions to
shuffle. A detailed description of the algorithm and pseudocode is found in the Methods section. On average,
miRNA alignments shuffled 57% (i.e. 57% of nucleotides
changed identity after shuffling), tRNA alignments – 61%,
snRNA alignments – 62%, snoRNA alignments – 46%,
and regulatory elements – 43%; overall the 3046 alignments shuffled on average 53%. We did not observe a correlation between the degree of shuffling and the scores
output by tools (data not shown).
We observed that the degree of shuffling possible depends
on sequence length and conservation: increasing length
and conservation increased the shufflability of the alignments, presumably due to more shuffling opportunities
resulting from more bases and less constraint imposed by
preserving local conservation patterns. Conversely,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/33

increasing the number of aligned sequences greatly
diminishes shuffling potential due the constraint of preserving dinucleotides in all aligned sequences. Consequently, here we consider only findings pertaining to
pairwise alignments. We acknowledge that we are not taking full advantage of MSARI, ddbRNA, Evofold, and
RNAz, since these tools were designed to handle multiple
sequence alignments. Nonetheless, we reasoned that it
would be of value to examine the outputs of these tools
under a situation that controls for all variables believed to
be relevant.
We ran all of the tools with default settings. All but one of
the tools ran without giving error messages. RNAz produces error messages with sequences shorter than 50 and
longer than 400 nt and for alignments with very low
sequence identity, but still produces scores that we
retained for the analysis since (a) only a small proportion
of the test set (5.2% is <50 nt; 0.005% > 400 nt; 5.5% <
50% identical) falls into this category, and (b) and challenges imposed in scoring these alignments apply to all of
the tools. MSARI output was excluded from subsequent
evaluation due to its extremely poor performance on
alignments of 2 sequences (it was designed for alignments
of 10–15 sequences [12] which cannot be shuffled to any
significant degree using our algorithm).

Overview of results on test set
For each of the tools, we scored precision (TP/(TP+FP))
and recall (TP/(TP+FN)) (identical to sensitivity) across its
range of output scores. In comparison to area under the
ROC curve, and specificity (TN/(TN+FP)), we view precision and recall as most relevant to real-world genomic
screening: precision estimates the false-positive rate one
would face if experimentally verifying predicted ncRNAs,
and recall estimates the proportion of all ncRNAs that
could be found.

because it does not learn any structural or sequence information (Table 1), and therefore results for the full data set
are shown. Nonetheless, on the whole, the tools appear to
detect different ncRNA classes in a roughly similar manner at the 50% recall operating point (Table 2). At lower
overall recall (15%, Table 2) the results become less comparable due to a strong bias towards detection of miRNAs
by the thermodynamics-only tools. At higher recall
(85%), all tools suffer from low precision (discussed in
more detail below).

Table 2 summarizes the results for each tool, with a breakdown of the precision over eight categories of ncRNAs
(snRNA, Box H/ACA snoRNA, Box C/D snoRNA, tRNA,
regulatory element, miRNA, other "structural" and "nonstructural"), at three thresholds corresponding to overall
recall of 15%, 50%, and 85%. For most tools and most
RNA classes, we observed that results appear to correlate
with degree of conservation; this is shown in Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figures 1 through 8 (in Additional file 1)
for individual ncRNA classes. In this analysis we defined
% sequence identity as the average of nucleotide conservation calculated for each column of the alignment; i.e. the
average of a series of ones and zeros where a match contributed one, and mismatches and gaps contributed zero.
In these figures we also show the maximum product of
precision and recall to provide a single summary score for
how well a tool separates the real alignments from their
shuffled variants at different scores and conservation levels. For example, an ideal tool would have a score threshold at which it attains 100% precision and 100% recall at
all conservation levels. We also show the actual score distributions as well as histograms of the conservation levels
of these classes in the test set.

Our results also verify the recent demonstration of Uzilov
et al. [7] that, on pairwise alignments, Z-scores based on
ΔG scores for both strands yield substantially higher precision at roughly equivalent recall for all ncRNA classes
tested, taking either an overall average or a median of class
averages (Table 2). Our "zRNAfold (Dual)" implementation is conceptually similar to "Dynalign" used by Uzilov
[7] (and is related to FoldAlign [14] in that the Z-score is
derived from the sum of the stabilities and the variance
obtained from shuffle-pair.pl). In our hands Dynalign
was too slow (>100 times slower than zMFOLD and
zRNAfold) to be useful for genome-wide scanning (our
test set alone would require ~1 year of CPU time, or
approximately 50–500 times longer than for the other
algorithms we tested) and we thus did not test it.

Our results are consistent with expectation in several
ways. First, taking an operating point at which each tool
yields ~50% overall recall, the recall of different classes is
ranked on average miRNA > tRNA > Regulatory > Box H/
ACA snoRNA > snRNA > Other (Table 2), roughly as has
been described by others (e.g. [16]). Algorithms utilizing
only thermodynamic stability appear to have a relative
advantage in detecting miRNAs, presumably due to the
simple hairpin structure. At the same time, they have relative difficulty identifying tRNAs, perhaps due to the more
complicated fold. Box C/D snoRNAs and non-structural
elements were virtually indistinguishable from shuffles.
We note that some of the tools may have been trained or
their parameters optimized using a portion of our test set,
and this may slightly bias outcome. EvoFold, for example,
was trained on a large set of ncRNAs including many miRNAs [13], and it does perform well on miRNAs, even in
our pairwise alignments; however, we confirmed that
results for EvoFold are virtually identical if its training set
RNAs are omitted [see Additional file 2], presumably

Importance of dinucleotide frequency
A somewhat discouraging outcome of our test was that all
of the tools displayed low apparent precision in our task.
At 50% recall, all of the tools displayed between 1 and
20% precision (median 5.5%). In a genomic scan, in
which the background sequence most likely exceeds the
100× ratio we employed (i.e. it is likely that less than 1%
of the alignable portions of the genome encode functional
RNA structures), this would translate to laboratory confirmations being overwhelmingly negative, in the absence of
further filtering. The results of our analysis must be
viewed in light of being based only on pairwise alignments, which substantially handicaps tools such as
ddbRNA, MSARI, and Evofold that rely solely on covariance and were created solely to scan multiple alignments.
Nonetheless, we were surprised that RNAz, which has
both covariance and thermodynamic components [10],
did not generally outperform zRNAfold (dual), which is
our relatively simple two-strand Z-score implementation
of the RNAz thermodynamic input.

A less expected but intriguing result was that tools utilizing apparently unrelated algorithms often mutually identified and missed the same ncRNAs (Figure 3). For
example, Evofold, one of the covariance tools, displayed a
very significant overlap in true positives with all of the
thermodynamic-only tools (P ≤ 10-111, hypergeometric
distribution vs. zRNAfold (dual)).

Dependency of precision and recall on score threshold and level of conservation
Dependency of precision and recall on score threshold and level of conservation. a) Results from eight ncRNA
search tools run on our test set of pairwise UCSC alignments of ncRNAs compiled from human, mouse, worm, fly, and yeast
ncRNA databases (n = 3046). We calculated recall and precision for 100 output score thresholds distributed linearly over the
range of output scores, and for five ranges of sequence identity (50–100%). (Only 5.5% of the alignments fall below 50%
sequence identity.) Precision and recall were calculated using a shuffled test set with of 100 shuffles for each real ncRNA alignment. The middle column depicts the product of precision and recall (*intensity scaled such that white = 0.3). The two columns on the right show the actual distribution of scores attained for real alignments (third from right) and shuffled alignments
(second from right) normalized to the count of the most recurrent score. The far right column shows the shuffled score distribution normalized to the real score counts (100× brighter) to reveal presence of high-scoring shuffles (i.e. false positives that
limit precision). b) Distribution of the sequence identity of the pairwise alignments. (Similar figures for ncRNAs in eight different classes are shown in Supplementary Figures 1-8 [Additional file 1]).

We reasoned that retention of dinucleotide counts might
account for the high false-positive rate we observed. To
ask whether this is the case, we examined the results
obtained using a negative-control test set generated using
an alternative shuffling procedure, shuffle-aln.pl [18],
which preserves local conservation, gap structure, and
base composition, but not dinucleotide content. Indeed,
with shuffle-aln.pl, the apparent false-positive rate
(number of negative-control sequences exceeding a
threshold) decreased 1.7-fold on average; most drastically
for RNAz and QRNA, which dropped 2.9 and 3.1-fold,
respectively, at 50% recall (Table 2). This indicates that
virtually all tools, including those that do not explicitly
have a thermodynamic component, are nonetheless influenced in some way by dinucleotide counts, which it is
known should be accounted for in estimation of falsepositive rates based on thermodynamic stability [8].
Considerations in genomic scanning: dinucleotides and
other aspects of sequence content
We next explored whether the dinucleotide issue might
influence genomic scans. We ran five of the eight tools on
120-base tiling windows of human-mouse alignments of
chromosome 19 (most of which is believed not to be
under selection [19]), and compared the distributions of
scores with and without preservation of dinucleotide content, again by comparing shuffle-pair.pl with shufflealn.pl). (Due to computational constraints, zRNAfold,
zRNAfold (dual), and Alifoldz were not run on these
sequences). In this analysis, the estimated false-positive
rates drastically increased when using shuffles with conserved dinucleotides: in Figure 4, the scores obtained from
shuffled sequences with dinucleotide frequency preserved
(black line) nearly overlap those obtained from the original sequence (red line), whereas there is a clear separation
of both from the scores with mononucleotide shuffling
(blue line). We reasoned that insufficient shuffling (due
to the dinucleotide preservation constraint) might provide a trivial explanation for this observation; however,
when we subset the analysis to those shuffles which differed in at least 50% of their nucleotide positions from
their original sequences, the trend clearly remained (Figure 4B, centre column). Even among the 535 windows in
which, by chance, the degree of shuffling in the dinucleotide-constrained set exceeded that in the mononucleotide-shuffled set, the trend remained largely intact (these
tend to represent the most highly-conserved sequence
windows and may represent special cases) (Figure 4B,
right column).

Why do dinucleotide counts influence scores from these
tools? For those relying on thermodynamics (zMFOLD
and RNAz), the dependence of ΔG on dinucleotides provides a likely explanation. However, QRNA does not utilize thermodynamic stability. Indeed, all the tools we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/33

examined displayed negligible biases towards specific
nucleotides or dinucleotides when run on randomly-generated alignments (data not shown). Only on ncRNAs and
genomic sequence (real or shuffled), which contain nonrandom distributions of di- and even mononucleotides
(Figure 5A), did high-scoring sequences emerge with
enrichment of specific dinucleotides. For example, in
shuffled versions of the test set, the highest-scoring
sequences from RNAz and QRNA tended to be slightly
enriched for CC and GG, and depleted of AA and AT (Figure 5B). This trend was even more marked for shuffled
versions of Chromosome 19 alignments (Figure 5C). EvoFold appeared to be even more sensitive to dinucleotide
composition of the shuffled genomic alignments, favoring those with AA, TT, AT, and TA (Figure 5C). Manual
examination of the specific shuffled genomic sequences
that scored highly with EvoFold revealed that many of
them contained unusual distributions of homopolymeric
or near-homopolymeric runs and simple repeat-like
sequence (missed by RepeatMasker) that are extremely
rare in randomly-generated sequence, but very common
in the human genome. Because the mono-, di-, and/or trinucleotide contents have reduced complexity, these patterns are occasionally preserved in shuffled controls. In
fact, we observed striking correlations between scores for
all of the Chromosome 19 tiling windows before and after
shuffling (either mono- or di-nucleotides) (Figure 6), suggesting that simple sequence properties can and do influence scores emerging from these tools.
In an effort to gain further insight, we examined the highest-scoring ~1,500 real genomic sequences from Chromosome 19 for each of three tools utilizing covariance
(EvoFold, QRNA, and RNAz). These are posted in the Supplementary data [see Additional file 9]. Manual examination of all three lists revealed the presence of many
homopolymeric or near-homopolymeric runs, repetitive
short motifs that escape repeatmasking, and nonuniform
distribution of nucleotides. The sequences that RNAz and
QRNA scored most highly were clearly enriched for G and
C (G or C content of ~60% for RNAz; ~66% for QRNA)
while those scored most highly by EvoFold appeared
enriched for homopolymeric stretches of A and T (and on
the whole are only ~42% G or C) (Sequences scored
highly by zMFOLD contained ~50% G or C, as did the
input alignments). Anecdotally, these non-repeat-masked
features do appear to contribute to the predicted RNA
structures. While we cannot rule out that a subset of these
are bona fide undiscovered functional ncRNA features, it is
also possible that the non-random distribution of nucleotides and short sequence features in genomes (including
short repeats and palindromes presumably arising from
aberrant DNA replication and repair events) could lead to
a higher degree of apparent secondary structure than

would be expected from a completely random evolutionary process.
We currently have no unifying explanation for why these
tools appear to favour specific types of sequences, and
suggest that this subject might form the basis for further
study. These trends do seem to suggest that caution
should be exercised in drawing conclusions about the
number of ncRNA features in the human genome, on the
basis of results of computational genomic scans. From our
analyses, we conclude that an accurate assessment of state-

of-the-art ncRNA search tools on multiple alignments,
which was our initial objective, is not realistic in the
absence of a shuffling algorithm that retains at least an
approximation of both dinucleotide frequencies and real
alignment structure. Moreover, it may be worth considering the fact that genome sequences contain a non-random
distribution of mononucleotides and other short
sequence features.

Relative 5 and mononucleotide counts in genomic, test, and positively-scoring shuffled sequences
Figure diRelative di- and mononucleotide counts in genomic, test, and positively-scoring shuffled sequences. a) Dinucleotide frequency enrichments over random sequence (where frequency of each dinucleotide is 1/16) for five genomes, human
genomic features, and the ncRNA test set subdivided by species and ncRNA classes. Frequency was computed by counting
each of the 16 dinucleotides across the indicated sequences and dividing by the total count of all dinucleotides. The bottom
panel indicates enrichment of individual nt over random sequence (where frequency is 1/4). b) Dinucleotide enrichments in
high-scoring shuffled ncRNA alignments (i.e. the test set, frequencies derived form top-strand) for five ncRNA search tools.
Frequencies were normalized to the ncRNA test set. Score thresholds were selected to maximize (precision × recall) on our

in intergenic regions, introns, and UTRs, and selection
against structure in coding regions
Our analysis above indicates that with any of the tools we
tested, the vast majority of high-scoring windows in a
genome scan using pairwise alignments would be falsepositives. Nonetheless, we next asked whether use of shuffle-pair.pl, which we believe provides a realistic estimate
of the false-positive rate, could aid in making new observations regarding frequency of structural elements across

genomic features. We used a tiling strategy similar to that
employed previously [10,20,21]. We used a window size
of 75 nt (at 30 nt offsets) because this window size
resulted in the greatest sensitivity at little cost to specificity
relative to other tiling window sizes (data not shown).
This window size is within range of previously computed
genomic scans: 50 [20] and 200 [21] used in bacterial
scans, and 120 [10] used for the human genome. On average, 23% of nucleotides in a 75 base window of human-

mouse pairwise alignments change identity during shuffling; however, 13% of sliding windows have >50% shuffling.
We scanned pairwise genomic alignments [22] of human
chromosome 19 and genomic regions corresponding to
alignable portions of 24,576 Refseq [23] genes with either
zMFOLD or Evofold, as practical representatives of the
thermodynamic-stability-only regime and the covariance
regime. We scanned real and shuffled counterparts (using
shuffle-pair.pl) of each window. We found that the distributions of the real and shuffled scores largely overlap,
with few or no real scores completely exceeding the shuffled distribution (Figure 7a, left). However, the real and
shuffled score distributions were significantly different
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < e-100; data not shown). A histogram of the difference in number of real and shuffled
sequences at different scores is shown at the right in Figure
7a. These results obviously bring into question the significance of any individual element, but also suggest a selection for some level of conserved secondary structure
across the genome.
To ask whether results obtained from genomic scanning
appear to be biologically relevant on the whole, and to
gain evidence that we have not mis-calibrated the negative
controls (thus under- or overestimating the false-positive
rate), we examined the overall distribution of score differences between real and shuffled sequences obtained from
different types of genomic features (UTRs, introns, intergenic sequences, and coding regions), which might be
expected to display differing propensities towards secondary structure. Using either zMFOLD or Evofold, we found
that striking differences exist among results obtained from
these features (Figure 7b; note that EvoFold humanchimp comparisons are substituted for human-mouse, as
these resulted in a larger number of positives, to our surprise). In particular, introns, intergenic sequence and 3'
UTRs tend to have a higher distribution of scores, indicating enrichment for structural features, relative to shuffled
controls. In contrast, we observed marginal enrichment
within 5' UTRs. Strikingly, we found that coding regions
have a lower score distribution than shuffled controls,
indicating an overall depletion of RNA structures in open
reading frames, which is consistent with the possibility
that these elements would inhibit translation [24]. These
results indicate that our analysis is not, on average, biased
towards falsely reporting structures, since some genomic
features appear to be enriched for structures while others
are depleted or neutral. These results also provide evidence for the presence of biologically functional structural
features, although specificity limitations of the individual
tools preclude direct prediction of individual structural
elements.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/33

To further investigate whether the tools are in fact identifying a biologically meaningful selection for structural elements we asked whether zMFOLD and Evofold, which
represent very different approaches, tend to give high
scores to the same UTR segments. We found that in
3'UTRs, where an obvious enrichment for structural elements exists, the top zMFOLD and Evofold scores are correlated (i.e. if a 3'UTR has a high scoring Evofold score, it
is also likely to contain a high-scoring zMFOLD score; Figure 8A; scores were normalized to UTR length). Furthermore, 48% of Evofold and zMFOLD highest scores within
each UTR correspond to the same region of the UTR
(within 100 nt of each other) which is approximately twofold higher than expected by chance (Figure 8B).

Discussion
To our knowledge, the panel of ncRNA search tools examined here have not been examined systematically by an
independent laboratory. With the goal of evaluating how
useful these tools are for de novo discovery of ncRNA elements in a genomic context, in which the anticipated
sparseness of real features makes it particularly important
to control false discovery, we compiled an extensive
sequence and alignment data set comprised of 3046 fragments of genomic alignments [22] corresponding to
ncRNAs from a variety of eukaryotes. We also developed a
shuffling algorithm for pairwise alignments (shufflepair.pl) that maintains dinucleotide frequencies, in addition to other features typically maintained in alignment
shuffling (gap structure, base composition, and local conservation) [10,16].
Due to shuffling constraints, which we show are important, we limited our test to pairwise alignments. In our
test, we found that failure to account for background
sequence properties leads to over-estimation of precision
(i.e. under-estimation of false-positive rate) for most
tools. We were surprised to find that tools with a strong or
exclusive covariance component were sensitive, in at least
some situations, to dinucleotide counts, which should
primarily impact thermodynamic stability. Estimation of
background rates from shuffling procedures that do not
preserve dinucleotides in our study resulted in an underestimate of the false-positive rate of up to 3-fold in our
analysis. We also confirmed that, for pairwise alignments,
z-scores derived from assessing thermodynamic stability
(relative to stabilities calculated from the same sequences
run through shuffle-pair.pl) contained comparable discriminatory potential to the best alignment-based tools
applied to pairwise alignments, on the basis of precision
at comparable recall.
Although our shuffling constraints precluded analysis of
more than pairwise alignments, it is possible that the
false-positive rates of these tools on multiple alignments

are higher than has been previously estimated, as their
false-positive rates are usually estimated by shuffling
mononucleotides [16] or by simulating evolution without
conserving dinucleotides [13]. For RNAz, a possible explanation is that the score incorporates thermodynamic stability which is calculated by sampling from precomputed
stabilities from sequences with similar length and mononucleotide composition (not dinucleotide composition
or any other aspects of the sequence). The SVM sampling
could be extended to include a dinucleotide sampling
which would likely alleviate any dinucleotide bias. We are
less certain of the explanation for the apparent dinucleotide biases evident for QRNA (for both our test set and
our Chromosome 19 scan) and Evofold (for the Chromosome 19 scan). It seems unlikely to be a result of dinucleotide bias per se although QRNA may have learned a GC
bias from tRNAs in its test set. We propose that these algorithms may suffer from not having been exposed to a large
amount of nonselected mammalian genomic sequence as
negative controls, as genomic sequence is known to contain substantial local variation in nucleotide content as
well as a non-random distribution of other simple
sequence features [25].
Our results underscore the importance of background
modelling, which we believe to be one of the major unre-

solved issues in de novo ncRNA searching in practice.
Although our demonstration is based on pairwise alignments, multiple alignments should not be immune from
these same trends. Unfortunately, the difficulty of preserving dinucleotides while shuffling increases substantially
as the number of sequences in the alignment increases,
even in the absence of other shuffling constraints.
We see no clean solution to this dilemma, although general strategies can be envisioned. First, the shuffling problem itself deserves more detailed investigation. Our
algorithm is only a simple heuristic and it might be
improved by finding more efficient ways to explore the
space of permutations. Another possibility might be to
relax the constraint that every dinucleotide count in every
alignment must be preserved. This could be done by
repeatedly shuffling the multiple alignment while keeping
track of dinucleotide content until a shuffled variant sufficiently close to the native alignment is attained. Pollard et
al. [26] generated alignments in silico by simulating evolutionary sequence divergence; this method might be
adapted to produce similar overall dinucleotide counts
and alignment structures to test sequences. An additional
possibility is to use longer shuffling windows to shuffle
multiple alignments. However, most known structural
ncRNAs are relatively short (the median length of ncRNAs

in our test set is 82 nt), and precision and recall decrease
substantially with tiling window sizes exceeding 150 nt
(data not shown). Unfortunately, Altschul-and-Ericksontype shuffling [27], which retains dinucleotide counts in
individual sequences but not the alignment structure, is
inappropriate even for thermodynamic tools that do not
depend on conserved structure for their overall score
(such as zRNAfold-Dual). This is because independently
shuffling the sequences within the alignment eliminates
the dependency of the score contributions from the individual sequences to the overall score, and lowers the range
of background scores (up to 2-fold for perfectly conserved
alignments). Independent shuffling is clearly inappropriate for tools that require conservation of structure.

scale, although previous experimental data has shown
that the introduction of stable secondary structure can
indeed impact on translation efficiency [28]. The most
obvious rationale for such a selection is that inhibition of
translation is, on the whole, detrimental to fitness of the
organism. In contrast, we find evidence that 3'UTRs,
introns, and intergenic regions on the whole contain
slightly higher structural scores than corresponding shuffles. Although the biological significance of all but a small
fraction of the highest-scoring individual sequences is
questionable, our results does nevertheless support the
existence of many additional RNA structural elements in
UTRs and introns, and potentially additional classes of
ncRNAs in intergenic regions.

An additional issue is that covariance-based tools are reliant on correct alignment as it is assumed that the covarying bases are structurally paired. Unlike protein coding
regions, where independent structural evidence often
exists to validate sequence alignments, aligning non-coding regions presents additional challenges. Pollard et al.
[26] reported that local alignment tools such as blastz
(which was used to generate the alignments used in this
study) had higher specificity but lower sensitivity than
global alignment tools (such as ClustalW) again using
simulated evolutionary sequence divergence as a control
for background. This implies that although full genome
alignments represent orthologous sequences, the exact
nucleotide positions may not always be accurate, and thus
may not provide an accurate covariance signature.

Conclusion

Selection pressure to maintain or avoid conserved
secondary structure depends on genomic location
Despite these caveats, comparisons of the aggregate scores
for real and shuffled alignments among different types of
genomic features, including coding and non-coding parts
of the genome, revealed striking differences with consequent biological implications. In general, coding
sequences appear to possess lower propensity for conserved secondary structure than would be expected by
chance. This is not an artefact of the high conservation of
coding sequences; highly conserved sequences in fact tend
to shuffle more completely (because a string of exact
matches eliminates the local conservation shuffling constraint) which would aid in discriminating bona fide
structures. On the basis of this result, it seems unlikely
that we are dramatically overestimating the degree of
selected secondary structure in the genome because at
least one type of genomic feature scores as containing less
than would be expected by chance. Since the random
alignments exactly match the background expectation
(Figure 7b), we conclude that there is likely to be an evolutionary selection against formation of secondary structures in open reading frames. To our knowledge, this
trend has not yet been demonstrated on a genome-wide

Accurate prediction of RNA structural elements in aligned
genome sequence remains a difficult problem. Further
work is required to properly assess background detection
rates. Nonetheless, the general trends we observed in
genomic scans appear to roughly reflect expectations, supporting the presence of secondary structural elements in
UTRs, and providing compelling evidence for evolutionary selection against secondary structures in coding
regions.

Methods
Test set
We downloaded tRNA and miRNA sequences from the
tRNA database [29] and Rfam [30] respectively, and all
other ncRNAs from NONCODE [31] (March 1, 2005). We
downloaded human-mouse pairwise alignments (hg17mm6) and human Refseq and ENSEMBL gene tracks from
UCSC [22] (Feb. 27, 2005). We mapped ncRNAs to the
genome using BLAT [32]. We did not consider sequences
that did not map in their entirety to an aligned block. We
developed Perl scripts to process the data: extract_axt.pl
[see Additional file 5] and extract_maf.pl [see Additional
file 6] for extraction of relevant pairwise and multiple
alignments using genomic coordinates as input (BED format) while taking orientation into account, and
calc_cons.pl to extract average PhastCons scores. We generated the ncRNA alignment test set, consisting of 3,046
ncRNA alignments, using pairwise alignments of the reference genome containing the transcript of interest versus
several available aligned genomes on the UCSC genome
browser. Only unique alignments were retained (i.e.
instances where both strands were identical were
removed). The test set is available as Additional files 7 and
8, and at [17].
Shuffling
We carried out shuffling of pairwise alignments using a
Perl script, shuffle-pair.pl [see Additional file 3]. shufflepair is an extension of the shuffling principle used by

Workman and Krogh [8] where a randomly selected trinucleotide is swapped with another randomly selected trinucleotide with identical bases at positions 1 and 3, and this
is repeated through N iterations. Controlled shuffling of
pairwise alignments requires three additional constraints:
1) simultaneous conservation of dinucleotides in both
sequences, 2) conservation of sequence identity (i.e.
matches and mismatches), and 3) conservation of gaps.
shuffle-pair attempts to swap each position in the alignment with randomly selected positions that satisfy these
criteria. Beginning with the aligned trinucleotide at position 1 of the alignment, it identifies all other aligned trinucleotides where positions 1 and 3 are identical and
where position 2 has identical sequence identity (i.e.
match or mismatch). It then randomly selects one of these
trinucleotide positions and swaps the columns at position
2. shuffle-pair repeats this for all trinucleotides within the
alignment and keeps a record of positions that were
swapped. It repeats the overall process until no more
swappable positions exist. To prevent disruption of gaps,
it treats sequences aligned to gaps as sub-sequences of the
overall alignment and shuffles them separately using the
process described above.

Running ncRNA-finding tools
We ran MSARI, RNAz, ddbRNA, QRNA (v.2), and Evofold
on the real and shuffled test sets using default parameters.
We used MFOLD and other thermodynamics tools to
compute z-scores, where z = -(ΔGreal sequence - mean(ΔG100
shuffled sequences)/StandardDevshuffled score distribution. Briefly, z
is the number of standard deviations that the true stability
(of the single reference strand) is below the mean stability
of the shuffled sequences (higher z-scores indicate higher
stability over shuffles; in our implementation 100 shuffles
generated using shuffle-pair.pl). A script that calculates
thermodynamic stability z-score using MFOLD is given in

Generation of random alignments
We generated random alignments on a per-column basis
using real alignments as input. Each nucleotide was
replaced using a random alphabet map that was regenerated for each column. The random alphabet map consisted of the assignment of A, C, G, and T to a random
order of A, C, G, and T (e.g. ACGT to TGCA, so that all As
would be replaced with Ts, Cs with Gs, etc.). Gaps were
maintained, to produce alignments with the same conservation pattern and gap structure as the input alignments,
but with a different base composition.
