Abstract
Background: In Escherichia coli, approximately 100 regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified
experimentally and many more have been predicted by various methods. To provide a comprehensive overview of
sRNAs, we analysed the low-molecular-weight RNAs (< 200 nt) of E. coli with deep sequencing, because the
regulatory RNAs in bacteria are usually 50-200 nt in length.
Results: We discovered 229 novel candidate sRNAs (≥ 50 nt) with computational or experimental evidence of
transcription initiation. Among them, the expression of seven intergenic sRNAs and three cis-antisense sRNAs was
detected by northern blot analysis. Interestingly, five novel sRNAs are expressed from prophage regions and we
note that these sRNAs have several specific characteristics. Furthermore, we conducted an evolutionary
conservation analysis of the candidate sRNAs and summarised the data among closely related bacterial strains.
Conclusions: This comprehensive screen for E. coli sRNAs using a deep sequencing approach has shown that
many as-yet-undiscovered sRNAs are potentially encoded in the E. coli genome. We constructed the Escherichia coli
Small RNA Browser (ECSBrowser; http://rna.iab.keio.ac.jp/), which integrates the data for previously identified sRNAs
and the novel sRNAs found in this study.

Background
RNA molecules are known to be key genetic regulators in
diverse organisms. In bacteria, these regulatory RNAs are
generally referred to as small RNAs (sRNAs) because
they usually range from 50 to 200 nt in length [1]. Recent
studies have suggested that most sRNAs modulate target
gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by base
pairing to mRNAs [2]. It has been reported that the
majority of bacterial sRNAs are synthesised under very
specific growth conditions and that these RNAs are regulators of gene expression in response to environmental
stresses [2,3] such as low iron [4], oxidative stress [5] and
elevated glucose-phosphate levels [6]. Currently, approximately 400 sRNAs have been detected in 70 microbial
genomes, including of the Escherichia, Shigella and
Salmonella genera [1]. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), the
most exhaustive and diverse searches for sRNAs have
been conducted with several methods: high-throughput

computational searches [7-13], shotgun cloning [14,15]
and tiling array analyses [16,17]. As a result, 80 sRNAs
have been experimentally verified and registered in RegulonDB [18], and many more sRNAs are predicted to exist
[19]. In recent years, deep sequencing has emerged as a
new and powerful experimental method for transcriptome analysis [20]. In eukaryotic organisms, this
approach has been commonly used for transcriptome
analyses, including microRNA detection [21]. In contrast,
in bacteria, this approach has only recently been used for
transcriptome analysis, although it has the potential to
increase our insight into transcriptional and post-transcriptional events in microorganisms dramatically
[20-22]. For instance, several sRNAs have been identified
using a deep sequencing-based approach in Salmonella
[23,24], Vibrio cholerae [25], Helicobacter pylori [26],
Burkholderia cenocepacia [27], Bacillus anthracis [28]
and quite recently, E. coli [29].
In this study, we report novel sRNAs identified in E. coli
with a deep sequencing analysis, focusing on low-molecular-weight RNAs (< 200 nt). Applying this approach, we
successfully detected most of the previously known sRNAs,

and discovered thousands of novel (fragmentary) transcribed regions. We selected 229 novel transcribed regions
as candidate sRNAs with computational or experimental
evidence of transcription initiation. Furthermore, we
detected the expression of seven intergenic sRNAs and
three cis-antisense sRNAs by northern blot analysis. Interestingly, five newly identified sRNAs are expressed from
prophage regions. We conducted an evolutionary conservation analysis of our candidate sRNAs and summarised the
data among closely related bacterial strains. Finally, we
generated a platform (Escherichia coli Small RNA Browser;
ECSBrowser) for sRNA research in bacteria.

Results
Deep sequencing-based identification of cis-antisense and
intergenic sRNAs

To comprehensively identify and summarise the sRNAs in
E. coli, we focused on the low-molecular-weight RNAs
and performed a deep sequencing analysis. First, E. coli
cells were grown to late exponential phase in M63 medium (glucose minimal medium). The cultured cells were
harvested and immediately treated with RNAprotect
Bacteria Reagent to prevent RNA degradation, because (i)
the half life of some sRNAs is very short (< 2 min) [15];
and (ii) we wanted to minimise in vitro degradation. The
low-molecular-weight RNA (< 200 nt) was then isolated
from the cultured cells (Additional File 1A), and a cDNA
library was constructed from the RNA sample after it had
been ligated to both 5’- and 3’-specific RNA adapters to
determine the direction of each transcript. The cDNA
library was deep sequenced using an Illumina 1G Genome
Analyzer system (a total of 12,473,172 reads). After discarding the reads containing unreliable nucleotides (Additional File 1B, steps 1 and 2), we selected 3,065,206 reads
that could be mapped to the E. coli genome with SOAP v1
(Additional File 1B, step 3). Most of the reads (98.6%)
were mapped to annotated regions, whereas the remaining
43,060 reads (1.4%) were mapped to non-annotated
regions (Figure 1A [a]). The majority of reads that mapped
to annotated regions (Figure 1A [b]) corresponded to
rRNAs (73.7%) or tRNAs (12.8%), and the remainder corresponded to coding sequences (CDSs; 4.9%), previously
known sRNAs (3.0%), untranslated regions (UTRs; 5.6%)
or other regions such as pseudogenes or phantom genes
(0.1%). Conversely, the reads that mapped to the nonannotated regions (Figure 1A [c]) corresponded to either
intergenic regions (71.6%) or cis-antisense strands of
known genes (28.3%). We classified the reads that could
be mapped to both intergenic regions and cis-antisense
strands of known genes as “other regions” (0.1%). The
reads located on cis-antisense strands of the ribosomal
binding sites (RBSs) of known genes, in particular, may be
involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs [2].

We noted that 2,326 reads (5.4% of the total) were classified in this category.
To predict novel transcribed regions, the resulting reads
were classified into one of five groups (Groups A-E),
according to the numbers (single or multiple) and types
(annotated or non-annotated) of the mapped regions
(Additional File 1B, step 4). We then eliminated the nonannotated mapped regions in Group E, because the reads
in Group E matched multiple regions and because it was
difficult to determine which one(s) was actually expressed.
Finally, all overlapping mapped regions were assembled,
thus generating 6,079 novel transcribed regions and
16,895 known transcribed regions (Additional File 1B, step
5). We assumed that some of these regions were still fragmentary. It is noted that 67 of 80 known sRNAs registered
in RegulonDB 6.3 were detected with multiple deep
sequencing reads, indicating the reliability of our method.
The remaining 13 known sRNAs have been reported to
be expressed only under specific conditions (Additional
File 2).
Then, we attempted to extract novel sRNAs from the
6,079 novel transcribed regions. For this purpose, we
focused on novel transcription units. Generally, sRNAs
can be generated either as primary transcripts or by processing from longer precursor transcripts [15]. In this
study, we ignored the latter case because we could not discriminate the processed sRNAs from RNA degradation
products in the current experiment. We used both computational and experimental data to reveal the novel transcriptional units. Firstly, we searched for potential
promoter and terminator sequences at the genome level,
as described previously [9], and predicted 47,630 sigma
70 promoter sequences and 5,290 rho-independent terminator sequences. The observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of
the predicted sigma 70 promoters for the 6,079 novel transcribed regions was lower than that for the 741 known
genes with annotated sigma 70 promoters (Additional File
3A), but it is striking that their undulating patterns were
very similar. These results suggest that many of the novel
transcribed regions contain predicted sigma 70 promoters,
as do the known genes. However, in the case of rho-independent terminators, the O/E ratio of the 6,079 novel
transcribed regions was not significant (Additional File
3B), suggesting that most of the novel transcribed regions
may not have a defined transcription termination site or
may lack the 3’ sequence. Based on these results, we
decided to use only the transcription initiation information
to extract the candidate sRNAs. Next, we collected published data on experimentally determined transcription
start sites (TSSs) [30-33] and RNA polymerase-binding
regions (RBRs) [30]. Finally, we selected 229 novel transcribed regions as candidate sRNAs. The criteria for this
selection process were as follows (a flow chart is shown in

regions. (B) Schematic representation of the procedure used to extract and classify novel candidate sRNAs. Novel candidate sRNAs were
extracted from all novel transcribed regions by the following two steps: selection of transcribed regions with evidence of transcription initiation
(Step 1) and length (Step 2). Then, novel candidate sRNAs were classified according to their evidence for transcription initiation and their coding
positions in the E. coli genome; Class A, with both computationally predicted sigma 70 promoters and experimentally determined TSSs [30-33]
and/or RBRs [30]; Class B, with only computationally predicted sigma 70 promoters; Class C, with only experimentally determined TSSs and/or
RBRs.

Figure 1B): (i) computational or experimental evidence of
transcription initiation; and (ii) a length of more than 50
nt. These candidate sRNAs were designated ECS001-229.
Of these candidate sRNAs, 117 were located in intergenic
regions (intergenic candidate sRNAs) and the remaining
112 were located on the opposite strand of annotated
regions (cis-antisense candidate sRNAs). We also classified
these 229 candidate sRNAs into three classes (A-C)
according to the evidence for transcription initiation
(Figure 1B). The details of these candidate sRNAs are
summarised in Additional File 4.
It has been reported that small functional proteins of
less than 50 amino acids [34,35] and several regulatory
sRNAs encode small functional peptides (so called “dualfunction sRNAs”) in bacteria [36,37]. Therefore, we
scanned the sequence of each candidate sRNA for an open
reading frame (ORF) and corresponding RBS using a
computational approach, to determine whether our novel
candidate sRNAs could encode small peptides. We determined that 29 candidate sRNAs had both an ORF and a
corresponding RBS, suggesting that these sRNAs may
encode small peptides (Additional File 5A, Type 1 & Additional File 5B). Seventy-five candidate sRNAs had putative
start codons and corresponding RBSs, although they did
not have stop codons (Additional File 5A, Type 2). Fiftyfive candidate sRNAs had putative ORFs, although they
did not have corresponding RBSs (Additional File 5A,
Type 3). Collectively, our data suggest that additional
small proteins might yet be discovered among these candidate sRNAs. In contrast, the remaining 70 candidate
sRNAs did not have ORFs of an appropriate length or
RBSs, suggesting that these function as non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs). The details of these candidate sRNAs are summarised in Additional File 4.
Expression of novel sRNAs analysed by northern blot
hybridisation

Deep sequencing analysis revealed a large number of novel
transcribed regions, identifying 229 intergenic and cis-antisense candidate sRNAs. We used northern blot analysis to
confirm the expression and determine the sizes of these
sRNAs, with strand-specific probes for the 25 most abundant candidate sRNAs with predicted sigma 70 promoters
(ECS001-025; Additional File 4). Sixteen of these were
intergenic sRNAs and nine were cis-antisense sRNAs. We
used both total RNA and low-molecular-weight RNA
from E. coli cells grown to either exponential or stationary
phase. We defined the expected size of each sRNA as the
length of the continuous genomic region mapped with at
least one read.
Intergenic sRNAs

Expression of 10 of the 16 intergenic candidate sRNAs
was detected by northern blot analysis (Figure 2) and the
results are summarised in Table 1. The lengths of each

Page 4 of 15

main band on the ECS009, ECS010, ECS022 and ECS025
blots were almost the same as the expected sizes (indicated with a black triangle). For the remaining six candidate sRNAs (except ECS020), the observed size was
longer than the expected size. Among them, the observed
sizes of ECS001, ECS002 and ECS023 were almost
equivalent to the distance between the 5’ end of each
candidate sRNA and the 3’ end of the nearest downstream gene. Based on the RegulonDB database and the
results of this study, the longer transcripts may be
expressed from novel TSSs (i.e., each transcript detected
by deep sequencing analysis was part of a 5’-UTR, not an
sRNA). For three candidate sRNAs, ECS005, ECS007 and
ECS020, the reason for the difference between the
observed band size and the expected band size remains
unknown. Although the band for ECS005 was very faint
on northern blots, we obtained a similar expression pattern using two different probes (data not shown), and
thought that the candidate ECS005 was a member of the
novel sRNA category. For ECS020, we detected a smear
in the total RNA lanes on northern blots and eliminated
this candidate from being a novel sRNA because we did
not detect a similar expression pattern using two different probes (data not shown). Intriguingly, the ECS001,
ECS005 and ECS007 sRNAs were differentially expressed
in the four different growth phases (Additional File 6),
suggesting that the expression of these RNAs is regulated
during bacterial growth.
Cis-antisense sRNAs

The expression of four of the nine cis-antisense candidate
sRNAs was detected by northern blot analysis (Figure 3)
and the results are summarised in Table 2. The observed
size of each candidate sRNA differed slightly from the
expected size. However, for the ECS003 candidate sRNA,
the length of the mapped region with many reads (78 nt)
was consistent with the observed size (~70 nt). A faint
band was also observed at ~120 nt, which corresponded
to the expected size. These results suggest that ECS003 is
first transcribed as a precursor of approximately 120 nt
and is then cleaved to ~70 nt. The observed sizes of the
remaining candidate sRNAs were somewhat longer than
expected (Table 2).
It is well known that cis-antisense sRNAs and their
target mRNAs exhibit complete complementarity, and
that their base-pairing causes either translational regulation of the target RNA by changing the ratio of its ribosomal-binding activity or degradation of the target RNA
by certain ribonuclease(s) [2]. Furthermore, it has been
reported that a subset of sRNAs regulates transcription
[38]. For example, the ECS003 sRNA is encoded on the
cis-antisense strand of the ymfM RBS, and might regulate ymfM translation by masking the RBS. The ECS017
sRNA is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of the
sigma 70 promoter (ykgMp) of the ykgM-ykgO operon

and the ECS012 sRNA is encoded on the cis-antisense
strand of the ybhJ mRNA (protein-coding region), suggesting that these cis-antisense sRNAs might regulate
their corresponding sense transcript. In contrast, the
ECS011 sRNA is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of

the IS128 sRNA. It has previously been reported that
the IS128 sRNA overlaps the IS129 sRNA in the same
chromosomal region as a cis-antisense sRNA pair [9].
Both the IS128 and IS129 sRNA transcripts (90-95 nt)
were detected by northern blot analysis with a double-

RegulonDB version 6.3 database. However, in our study,
no IS128 sRNA was detected by northern blotting with
strand-specific probes (data not shown), although IS129

was detected as part of ECS011. Therefore, we suggest
that the IS128 sRNA is an artefact or is only expressed
under specific conditions. We also suggest a re-annotation of IS129 as ECS011, a member of the intergenic
sRNAs.

Novel sRNAs expressed from prophage regions and their
possible roles

The E. coli K12 genome is reported to include 10 prophages [39]. We noted that 27 of 229 candidate sRNAs
were expressed from prophage regions (Additional File 4).
To date, the isrC [9], C0293 [16] and dicF [40] sRNAs are
known to be expressed from prophage regions. The functions of the isrC and C0293 sRNAs are totally unknown,
although the dicF sRNA is known to bind the RBS of the
ftsZ mRNA, thus inhibiting ribosome entry. Because ftsZ
encodes a protein (Z ring) involved in cell division, dicF
sRNA binding causes a defect in E. coli cell division [41].
To investigate our sRNAs expressed from prophage
regions, we focused on five sRNAs detected by northern
blot analysis (Figures 2 and 3).
Because the expression of many sRNAs is reported to
be regulated under specific conditions [2,3], such as
under various stresses, in different kinds of media or in
the presence of certain chemicals, we analysed the
expression of each sRNA expressed from a prophage
region using total RNAs prepared from cells grown
under these conditions (Figure 4). We used total RNAs
from E. coli cells grown to exponential or stationary
phase in LB (or M63) medium or E. coli cells subjected
to heat or cold shock. We also used an hfq knockout
strain (grown to exponential phase in M63 medium)
because the RNA chaperone Hfq is thought to be
required for the stability of many sRNAs and/or their
activity in E. coli [42]. We measured the signal intensity
of each band using the Quantity One software package
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), and calculated the relative
amount of each transcript by comparison with the signal
intensity of that transcript in samples derived from cells

grown to exponential phase in M63 medium, which were
used as the control. The gene expression of the ECS003
sRNA did not change under any of these conditions,
although its transcript level seemed to be relatively

stronger. In contrast, the levels of the ECS007 and
ECS010 transcripts were reduced (approximately 0.2-0.3fold) in LB medium (lane E in Figure 4). The expression
of the ECS007 and ECS009 sRNAs was increased
(approximately 1.5-2-fold) by heat shock, whereas that of
the ECS010 and ECS025 sRNAs was increased (approximately 2-3-fold) by cold shock. The levels of the ECS007
and ECS009 transcripts were reduced (approximately
0.2-0.5-fold) in the hfq knockout strain. The expression
of dicF sRNA, which is known to bind Hfq, was also
reduced and was negligible in the hfq knockout strain.
Moreover, the ECS009 transcript overlapped with previously predicted candidate sRNAs that have been
detected based on co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq [17]
(Table 1). These results suggest that Hfq is required to
produce or maintain the ECS007 and ECS009 sRNAs.
Nucleotide conservation of novel candidate sRNAs in
bacteria

The Blast-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) [43] was used to
compare the nucleotide sequences of the 80 previously
known sRNAs and 229 novel candidate sRNAs in E. coli
with those of 1,378 complete bacterial genomes. Under
our definition of “conservation” (see the Methods section),
we found that only 106 genomes derived from 22 genera
possessed similar sequences, and that most of the conservation was restricted to two genera: Escherichia and Shigella. An example of the nucleotide conservation of the 80
most abundant candidate sRNAs is shown in Figure 5.
The same features of conservation were reported in a previous study using 55 sRNAs [19]. In contrast, some novel
sRNAs, such as ECS016 and ECS173, exhibited conservation with sequence from the Salmonella genus. Moreover,
the ECS021, ECS028 and ECS161 sRNAs were conserved
beyond the Yersinia genus, similar to housekeeping
sRNAs such as ssrS sRNA (6S RNA) and ffs sRNA (4.5S
RNA). sRNAs expressed from prophage regions, such as
ESC009, ECS010 and ECS171, were not well conserved
even within the Escherichia genus. Because the host range
of some bacteriophages is quite limited and, in many
cases, each bacteriophage only attacks a single strain of
bacterium [44], the prophage region itself may not demonstrate high levels of nucleotide conservation in the
genome.
Construction of the ECSBrowser

We constructed the ECSBrowser to provide an up-todate overview of E. coli sRNAs, including those identified in this study (Figure 6). This database enables visualisation of all the data from the current analysis. In
Figure 6, the upper panel shows all the ncRNA genes
encoded in the E. coli genome, including sRNAs, tRNAs
and rRNAs. The middle panel magnifies the entire CPS53 prophage. The lower panel focuses on the ECS009

sRNA. In this figure, we used the example of ECS009,
expressed from the CPS-53 prophage region. Similarly,
using the ECSBrowser, we can obtain information for
each sRNA, from the single-nucleotide level to the
whole-genome level. We also included in this browser
the evolutionary conservation data for the 80 previously
known sRNAs and 229 novel sRNAs. The ECSBrowser
is available through the website http://rna.iab.keio.ac.jp.

Discussion
In this study, our first priority was to detect novel transcribed regions, so we filtered unreliable reads quite
strictly and only selected 3,065,206 high-quality reads
from the original 12,473,172 reads (Additional File 1B,
steps 1-3). We then discovered 6,079 novel (fragmentary)
transcribed regions and selected 229 candidate sRNAs
(Figure 1B). It is likely that these candidate sRNAs are
actually expressed under the conditions used in this
study because the deep sequencing-based approach
directly determines the cDNA sequence. Traditionally,
the expression of previously known sRNAs was ultimately confirmed by northern blot analysis [45]. Therefore, we also conducted northern blot analysis, detected
the expression of 14 of the 25 examined candidate
sRNAs (Tables 1 and 2, Figures 2 and 3) and identified
10 of them as novel sRNAs. We cannot explain why the
remaining 11 candidate sRNAs could not be detected by
northern analysis. It might be necessary to optimise the
hybridisation conditions for each sRNA. In addition, we
could not intrinsically distinguish the novel sRNAs from
stable degradation products in our current study. Therefore, we established criteria for extracting sRNAs (Figure
1B). In this way, we selected 229 candidate sRNAs with
computational or experimental evidence of transcription
initiation and a length of more than 50 nt (Figure 1B).
Because several sRNAs generated by processing from larger precursor RNAs have been reported [14,15] and fairly
small sRNAs (≤ 50 nt) are known in a few cases [14], the
remaining novel transcribed regions might contain additional sRNAs. Collectively, at least 10 previously unreported sRNAs were identified, and the expression of
many other candidate sRNAs was implied by this study,
although the functions of the vast majority of these candidate sRNAs are not yet clear.
In the last decade, several groups have searched extensively for sRNAs in E. coli using computational and experimental approaches [15-23,29]. Therefore, we examined the
overlaps between the candidate sRNAs in this study and
those identified in previous studies. Forty-seven of the 229
novel candidate sRNAs overlapped with previously predicted sRNAs, but the remaining 182 could not be predicted by traditional approaches. The details are
summarised in Additional File 4 and the ECSBrowser.
Moreover, we suggested that 29 of the 229 novel candidate

Figure 5 Nucleotide conservation of novel sRNAs in bacteria. The nucleotide sequence conservation of the 80 most abundant candidate
sRNAs among 106 closely related bacterial strains is shown. Red indicates high nucleotide conservation and black indicates no conservation. The
name of each sRNA is shown on the right. sRNAs expressed from prophage regions (blue letters) and sRNAs identified by northern blot analysis
(red circles) are indicated. The phylogenetic tree for 16S rRNA sequences was constructed based on the neighbour-joining method using
ClustalW version 1.83 [64]. The names of the organisms and their corresponding NCBI IDs for the complete genome sequence are described in
Additional File 10. Evolutionary distance is shown by the branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree. For three strains, the lines have been
shortened (the real evolutionary distances are *, 0.49; **, 0.48; ***, 0.07; and ****, 0.42).

sRNAs might encode small proteins because they have
both an ORF (≥ 4 amino acids [aa]) and corresponding
RBS. Interestingly, 10 out of 29 potential small proteins in
this study overlapped with the dataset of small proteins

that have been computationally predicted based on
sequence conservation and RBS models [46]. We show six
examples of the candidate sRNAs that encode putative
peptides in Additional File 4.

symbols. For example, if one of the candidate sRNAs is clicked, the name of the candidate sRNA and the average number of deep sequencing
reads mapped to that candidate sRNA would appear. The arrows on the right-hand side represent: (a) experimentally determined TSSs (pink
vertical lines) and RBRs (red vertical lines) obtained from the published literature [30-33]; (b) consensus sequences of the predicted promoters
(pink arrowheads), predicted terminators (blue vertical lines) and predicted RBSs (green rhombi); (c) novel sRNAs detected by northern blot
analysis (red boxed arrows), novel transcribed regions (white boxed arrows) and known transcribed regions (black lines); (d) CDSs (blue boxed
arrows) and pseudogenes (grey boxed arrows); (e) deep sequencing data; and (f) sRNAs predicted by computational methods (white boxed
arrows) and sRNAs predicted by experimental procedures (pink boxed arrows) in previous studies.

The primary limitation of most traditional methods of
identifying sRNAs is a bias toward intergenic regions
[45]. Therefore, it is likely that the previous list of cisantisense sRNAs is far from complete. Currently, 24 of
the 80 previously known sRNAs registered in the RegulonDB database are located on the opposite strand from
known genes in E. coli. Among them, 12 are reported to
act as cis-antisense sRNAs [14,15,47-51]. These sRNAs
interact with the 5’-UTR [14,48,49,51], the 3’-UTR [50]

or the whole area [47] of each target mRNA by a basepairing mechanism. Two sRNAs are known to interact
with each other by a cis-antisense mechanism [15]. In
this study, we found 112 novel cis-antisense candidate
sRNAs (Figure 1B). We noted that 74 of these (such as
ECS012; Figure 3) are encoded on the opposite strand
from protein-coding regions, but are not in the 5’- or 3’UTRs of the mRNAs (Additional File 4). The target sites
of a few trans-antisense sRNAs are reported to occur in

Shinhara et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:428
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/428

protein-coding regions and these sRNAs cause endonucleolytic mRNA destabilisation rather than the typical
inhibition of translational initiation [52], although most
trans-antisense sRNAs interact with the 5’-UTR of the
target mRNA by a base-pairing mechanism, blocking
translation initiation [45]. These results suggest that
novel cis-antisense sRNA species, as well as trans-antisense sRNAs, may regulate a coding gene on the opposite
strand.
Three previously identified sRNA genes (isrC, C0293
and dicF) are expressed from prophage regions in
E. coli. Our results show that at least five additional
sRNAs are expressed from prophage regions, and that
the transcript levels of some of these sRNAs are high
(Figure 4). Recently, it was reported that prophage
regions contain several sRNAs and that the expression
levels of some sRNAs are also high in Bacillus subtilis
[46]. This may represent a common feature of prokaryotic sRNAs. Four of five prophage-derived sRNAs were
modestly activated by temperature stress (Figure 4),
although the expression levels of these sRNAs were
unchanged under conditions of SOS induction, such as
mitomycin C treatment and UV irradiation (data not
shown). The SOS response is known to trigger significantly higher induction of prophages [53].
Previously, it was reported that the majority of intergenic sRNAs in E. coli regulate the expression of genes in
response to environmental stresses, and that these integral
elements of the stress response are usually very tightly
regulated [2]. In contrast, the novel sRNAs in the current
study are constantly expressed under our conditions,
although the transcript levels of several novel sRNAs were
also moderately activated in response to temperature
stress, nutrient limitation and growth phase (Figures 2, 3,
4). To obtain more functional information on the novel
sRNAs, we generated single-deletion mutants for 13 novel
intergenic sRNA regions and conducted growth analysis of
these mutants on rich and minimal medium. However, the
growth of these deletion mutants was not significantly different from that of wild-type E. coli. Typical data are
shown in Additional File 7. We concluded that many of
these sRNAs are not necessary for the growth of E. coli,
although they are clearly expressed. We are now generating mutants from all the sRNAs for functional analysis (to
be published separately). Recently, a deep sequencing analysis of novel regulatory RNAs in E. coli has been reported
[29]. The authors identified 10 new sRNAs and 9 new regulatory leader sequences in the intergenic regions of
E. coli. We found that four of our sRNAs (ECS026,
ECS181, ECS183 and ECS224) overlapped with their new
sRNAs, and another four of our sRNAs (ECS028, ECS031,
ECS080 and ECS210) overlapped with their new regulatory leader sequences (summarised in Additional File 4).
These results also support the concept that there are

Page 11 of 15

many as-yet-undiscovered sRNAs or transcribed regions
in E. coli.
Finally, we emphasise that the ECSBrowser is the only
browser that specifically focuses on the transcribed
regions of the E. coli genome (Figure 6). This browser
includes information about transcript elements, such as
promoters, terminators, RBRs and TSSs, which have been
predicted and/or identified at the genome-wide level by
various methods. Furthermore, this browser includes
information about sRNAs that were predicted in eleven
previous papers [7,9-17,29]. Using this browser, it is also
possible to integrate a number of deep sequencing data
that have been obtained under various culture conditions;
we intend to use this to compare the dynamic changes in
the transcriptome under each specific culture condition.
We anticipate that the ECSBrowser will contribute to
future transcriptome analysis, including the detection of
novel sRNAs.

Conclusions
In previous research, many bacterial sRNAs have been
characterised under certain stress conditions such as heat
shock, cold shock or oxidative stress. In this paper, we
comprehensively analysed sRNAs expressed in normal
E. coli growth conditions and discovered 229 novel candidate sRNAs (≥ 50 nt) with computational or experimental
evidence of transcription initiation. We also found several
novel sRNAs that are highly expressed in prophage regions
in the E. coli genome. We conducted an evolutionary conservation analysis of the candidate sRNAs and summarised
the data among closely related bacterial strains. Furthermore, we made 13 sRNA deletion mutants and characterised their growth, although the growth of these deletion
mutants was not significantly different from that of wildtype E. coli. Finally, we generated a platform (Escherichia
coli Small RNA Browser; ECSBrowser) for sRNA research
in bacteria. Previously, other studies have reported hundreds of candidate sRNAs encoded in the E. coli genome.
However, there is no consensus among them and the
wealth of information is confusing. In ECSBrowser, users
can access the results of the 11 primary E. coli sRNA prediction papers plus our new data in a uniform database
format. We believe this will be invaluable to researchers in
this field.

(CDSs, tRNAs, rRNAs, sRNAs, pseudogenes, phantom

obtained from RegulonDB version 6.3 http://regulondb.
ccg.unam.mx/. In this study, we also predicted additional
RBSs with RBSfinder using a window size of 50 bp [54],
and defined them as an annotated region. Data on experimentally determined TSSs and RBRs were obtained from
the literature [30-33].
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

E. coli K12 strain BW25113 (wild type) [55] and the hfq
knockout strain from the Keio collection [56] were used
in this study. E. coli was cultured overnight at 37°C under
microaerobic conditions in LB medium or modified M63
medium (glucose minimal medium: (K 2 HPO 4 53.6 g,
KH2PO4 26.2 g, (NH4)2SO4 10.0 g, FeSO4.7H2O 2.5 mg,
D-glucose 4 g, thiamine·HCl 5.0 g and MgSO4.7H2O 50.0
g per litre). The overnight culture was diluted 20-fold in
fresh medium and grown at 37°C to the indicated optical
densities at 600 nm (OD600 ). For the heat shock treatment, the cells were grown at 30°C to an OD600 of 0.6
and then at 42°C for 15 min. For the cold shock treatment, the cells were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.6
and then at 15°C for 30 min. These cultured cells were
harvested, immediately treated with RNAprotect Bacteria
Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction.

system (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which generates 35base reads. The deep sequencing data have been submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive http://trace.
ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dra/index_e.shtml under accession number
DRA000221.
Analysis of the deep sequencing data and prediction of
the transcribed regions

Two types of RNA samples (total RNA and low-molecular-weight RNA) were prepared from the cultured cells.
The total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Midi Kit
(Qiagen), with a slight modification. Instead of using an
RNeasy Midi column, we used phenol-chloroform
extraction to collect a complete set of RNAs, including
low-molecular-weight RNAs. The low-molecular-weight
RNA was extracted using the enrichment procedure for
small RNAs included in the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

We used a series of filters to remove unreliable deep
sequencing reads. The flow chart for these filtering
approaches is summarised in Additional File 1B. In step 1,
reads containing the character ‘N’ (indeterminable A, T, G
or C) were discarded from the total reads. In step 2, reads
with low-quality base calls were also discarded based on
the GERALD module (Illumina). In step 3, we collected
the reads that could be mapped to the E. coli genome:
(i) the first 32 bases of each read were mapped to the
E. coli genome with SOAP v1 [57], allowing up to two
mismatches; and (ii) the remaining 33rd-35th bases were
mapped to the E. coli genome by forcing perfect alignments, beginning at the 33rd base and retaining the longest region that could be aligned to the genome. In this
study, we defined the “mapped region” as the genomic
region that could be mapped by some read(s). To predict
novel transcribed regions, we classified the filtered reads
into one of five groups (Groups A-E) according to
the numbers (single or multiple) and types (annotated or
non-annotated) of the mapped regions (Step 4). We eliminated the non-annotated mapped regions in Group E
because we could not determine whether these mapped
regions were actually expressed. Finally, we defined
the “transcribed region” as the minimum continuous
mapped region, and all overlapping mapped regions were
assembled into novel and known transcribed regions (Step
5). After assembling the mapped regions in step 5, we
noticed that some non-annotated mapped regions in
Groups B and D were contiguous with the known transcribed regions. Thus, we manually transferred these
regions to the “known transcribed regions” category.

Deep sequencing of low-molecular-weight RNAs

Prediction of novel candidate sRNAs

We used the low-molecular-weight RNAs extracted from
E. coli K12 strain BW25113 cells grown to an OD600 of
0.76 (late exponential phase) for deep sequencing analysis
(Additional File 1A). A cDNA library was prepared and
the deep sequencing analysis was performed at the Post
Genome Institute (Hongo, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, the
RNA samples were treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to convert the 5’ terminus from a triphosphate
to a monophosphate. The resulting RNAs were then
ligated with 5’- and 3’-specific RNA adapters, reverse
transcribed and amplified as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. The nucleotide sequences were determined with the Illumina/Solexa 1G Genome Analyzer

To characterise the transcribed regions and extract novel
candidate sRNAs, we first predicted possible promoter
and terminator sequences at the genome level using
bioinformatics approaches: (i) the consensus sequences
of sigma 70 promoters (-35 and -10 box) were predicted
with pftools2.3 [58] using a profile of E. coli sigma 70 promoters [59]; and (ii) the consensus sequences of rhoindependent terminators were predicted with RNAmotif
[60] based on information from previous studies [13,61].
We calculated the observed number of predicted
sigma 70 promoters and rho-independent terminators
for each transcribed region. We also calculated the
expected number of predicted sigma 70 promoters and

RNA preparation

Shinhara et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:428
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/428

rho-independent terminators for random genomic position sets that were generated 100 times using the BlumBlum-Shub algorithm obtained from CPAN http://
search.cpan.org/. The O/E ratio was obtained by dividing the observed numbers by the average expected numbers. As a positive control, the same analysis was also
performed for each known gene with an annotated
sigma 70 promoter or rho-independent terminator,
obtained from RegulonDB version 6.3.
Candidate sRNAs were extracted from all novel transcribed regions based on the following two criteria (a flow
chart is shown in Figure 1B). First, the novel transcribed
regions with computational or experimental evidence of
transcription initiation were extracted (Step 1). We used
predicted sigma 70 promoters as the computational evidence. The definition of a possible promoter was that the
-10 box consensus sequence of the sigma 70 promoter
occurred within 10 bases upstream of a novel transcribed
region. We also employed published data on TSSs [30-33]
and RBRs [30] as experimental evidence. We used the data
only when the TSS was located within 10 bases upstream
or downstream of a novel transcribed region and the RBR
was found within 50 bases upstream or 10 bases downstream of a novel transcribed region. Second, the novel
transcribed regions that were larger than 50 nt were
extracted as novel candidate sRNAs (Step 2). Finally, novel
candidate sRNAs were classified according to their evidence for transcription initiation (computational or experimental) and their coding positions in the E. coli genome
(intergenic or cis-antisense). Furthermore, we scanned the
sequence of each candidate sRNA for a start codon (AUG,
UUG or GUG), stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG), appropriate reading frame (≥ 4 aa) and RBS.
Northern blot analysis

Both total RNA and low-molecular-weight RNA were prepared from E. coli cells grown to an OD600 of either 0.6
(the middle of the exponential phase) or 1.2 (the early stationary phase) in our growth conditions. These RNAs
(total RNA, 20 μg per lane; low-molecular-weight RNA, 2
μg per lane) were separated on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea and transferred onto
Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ)
by electroblotting. The 3’ ends of specific oligonucleotide
probes (summarised in Additional File 9) were labelled
using a Biotin 3’ End DNA Labeling Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The membranes were hybridised
with these probes in ULTRAhyb-Oligo hybridisation buffer (Ambion) at room temperature. The hybridisation was
conducted at 42°C for ECS020 sRNA or 65°C for 5S
rRNA. The washing temperature was the same as the
respective hybridisation temperature. The non-isotopic
blots were visualised using a BrightStar BioDetect Kit
(Ambion) using the ECF™ Substrate (GE Healthcare).

The images were captured using a Molecular Imager FX
Pro (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Nucleotide conservation analysis of both known and
novel candidate sRNAs in bacteria

For the conservation analysis, BLAT v.34 [43] was used to
compare the nucleotide sequences of the candidate sRNAs
in E. coli with those of 1,378 complete bacterial genomes
downloaded from the NCBI ftp server (http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov; 2011/02/11). An sRNA-encoding gene was considered “conserved” in another organism if the sequence
met the following three criteria: (i) an E-value lower than
0.01; (ii) a coverage higher than 70%; and (iii) an identity
higher than 70%. Then, the nucleotide sequence conservation score was calculated using the following formula:
((nucleotide match-length)*(nucleotide identity/100))/
(nucleotide length of the candidate sRNA). These scores
are summarised in Additional File 10. Next, we performed
hierarchical clustering from the conservation score of candidate sRNAs using Cluster 3.0 software [62] with centroid
linkage, and visualised the results using Java TreeView
1.1.5 [63]. For phylogenetic tree construction, we first
extracted each 16S rRNA sequence from their corresponding genomic sequences by BLAT using the E. coli rrsA
gene (16S rRNA) as the query. Then, a multiple alignment
of the 16S rRNA sequences was constructed using Clustal
W version 1.83 [64] and the phylogenetic tree was
depicted using Interactive Tree Of Life [65].
Construction of the Escherichia coli Small RNA Browser
(ECSBrowser)

The database for E. coli sRNA was constructed using the
Generic Genome Browser version 2.0 of the Generic
Model Organism Database project http://gmod.org/wiki/
Main_Page, and named the Escherichia coli Small RNA
Browser (ECSBrowser). This browser provides all the
information from the current analysis.
