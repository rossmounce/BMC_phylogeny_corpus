Abstract
Background: The recently emerged protein interaction network paradigm can provide novel and
important insights into the innerworkings of a cell. Yet, the heavy burden of both false positive and
false negative protein-protein interaction data casts doubt on the broader usefulness of these
interaction sets. Approaches focusing on one-protein-at-a-time have been powerfully employed to
demonstrate the high degree of conservation of proteins participating in numerous interactions;
here, we expand his 'node' focused paradigm to investigate the relative persistence of 'link' based
evolutionary signals in a protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae and point out the value of this
relatively untapped source of information.
Results: The trend for highly connected proteins to be preferably conserved in evolution is stable,
even in the context of tremendous noise in the underlying protein interactions as well as in the
assignment of orthology among five higher eukaryotes. We find that local clustering around
interactions correlates with preferred evolutionary conservation of the participating proteins;
furthermore the correlation between high local clustering and evolutionary conservation is
accompanied by a stable elevated degree of coexpression of the interacting proteins. We use this
conserved interaction data, combined with P. falciparum /Yeast orthologs, as proof-of-principle that
high-order network topology can be used comparatively to deduce local network structure in nonmodel organisms.
Conclusion: High local clustering is a criterion for the reliability of an interaction and coincides
with preferred evolutionary conservation and significant coexpression. These strong and stable
correlations indicate that evolutionary units go beyond a single protein to include the interactions
among them. In particular, the stability of these signals in the face of extreme noise suggests that
empirical protein interaction data can be integrated with orthologous clustering around these
protein interactions to reliably infer local network structures in non-model organisms.

Background
An ambitious goal of contemporary proteome research is
the elucidation of the structure, interactions and functions
of the proteins that constitute cells and organisms. During

the last few years, large-scale efforts have unraveled the
complex web of protein interactions in simple organisms
such as H. pylori [1], E. coli [2] and S. cerevisiae [3-7]. Most
recently, attention has focused on the first protein interac-

(a) Pooling proteins according to their level of interaction k we determined the excess retention ER of these grouped protein

values of ERk in bins of logarithmic size we observe clear logarithmic trends. (b) Analogously, we pooled interacting protein
pairs v, w of Yeast according to their hypergeometric clustering coefficient Cvw and determined the excess retention ER in these
groups of protein pairs that both have orthologs in the aforementioned higher eukaryotes. Pooling these Cvw dependent values
of ER in bins of logarithmically increasing size we observe clear logarithmic trends again. In both cases, significant Pearson's and
Spearman's rank correlation coefficients [see Additional file 1] support our conclusion that not only highly interacting proteins
(as exemplified by a large k) are predominately preserved but also interacting protein pairs which are embedded in a highly
cohesive neighborhood (as exemplified by a high Cvw). Error bars indicate the standard deviations from the mean excess retention in each bin.

tion maps of complex multicellular organisms such as C.
elegans [8] and D. melanogaster [9]. Although these organisms vary extensively in their complexity, corroborative
evidence points to a series of simple organizing principles
that characterize all complex protein interaction networks
[10]. The most dramatic of these is their scale-free nature
[11,12], highlighting a small number of highly connected
proteins which secure the integrity and connectivity
among modules [13,14] that are discernible, yet topologically overlapping, clusters of densely interconnected protein groups sharing well-defined functions [10,15-18]. A
crucial biological corollary of this ubiquitous network
organization is the observation that hubs exhibit an elevated propensity to be simultaneously conserved in evolution and are essential for survival [13,19,20]. This role of
highly connected proteins is further indicated by a considerable degree of sequence conservation [21-25]. Similarly,
cohesively bound modules have been conserved as a
whole, suggesting the presence of evolutionary relevant
building blocks [26-28]. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that proteins belonging to a certain module tend to be coexpressed [29] and coregulated
[30]. These particular results are utilized for the comparison of protein pathways of various organisms [31], mod-

eling of interactomes [32,33] and prediction of protein
functions [34].
These insights have fundamental implications for our
understanding of biological processes and potential applications; however the severe error-proneness of methods
for the determination of protein interactions casts doubt
on the integrity of such datasets. For example, an estimate
of the accuracy of protein interactions in S. cerevisae
uncovered a startling false negative rate of 90%, and a
50% false positive error rate [35].
Despite incoherences in the determination of protein
interactions and orthologs, we observe that extensive
information remains in the topology of a protein interaction network. In particular, even tremendous experimental noise does not bury the strong evolutionary signal that
highly connected nodes in an interaction web of Yeast
proteins are preferably conserved in higher eukaryotes.
Accounting for interactions between pairs of Yeast proteins, we find that the reliability of an interaction as indicated by a high degree of local clustering around
interactions is accompanied by an elevated propensity for
the corresponding proteins to be evolutionary conserved.

In addition, we observe that such interactions are preferably coexpressed in both the reference and a target organism, suggesting that conservation occurs not only on the
level of individual proteins but also on the level of their
interactions. The observation that such link-based evolutionary signals prevail in the topology of an otherwise
extremely noisy protein interaction network indicates a
novel way to uncover protein interactions in any organism for which orthologs can be identified from sequence
data.

Results
As a basis of our considerations we utilized a protein-protein interaction network of S. cerevisae from the DIP database [36], providing 3, 833 proteins embedded in 11, 942
interactions. We labeled pairs of proteins as orthologous
to each other as of the InParanoid database [37] that
relates proteins of S. cerevisiae to complete protein sets of
various higher eukaryotes, allowing us to utilize 1, 928
Yeast proteins with putative orthologs in H. sapiens, 2,073
in A. thaliana, 1, 885 in C. elegans, 1, 885 in M. musculus
and 1,631 in D. melanogaster.
Evolutionary retention of single proteins
Utilizing these data sets we recently uncovered a correlation between a Yeast proteins level of interaction and its
propensity to be evolutionary conserved [20]. Pooling all
proteins into groups according to their connectivity k we
determine the respective fraction of orthologs in each
group. As a null-hypothesis we assume a random distribution of orthologs that is quantified by the fraction of proteins with an ortholog in a target eukaryote and the total
number of proteins present in the underlying Yeast protein interaction network. The degree dependent orthologous excess retention, ERk, defined as the ratio of ortholog
fractions in k dependent groups of proteins and fractions
of randomly distributed orthologous proteins reflects the
dependence of evolutionary protein conservations as
function of the proteins connectivity. Logarithmically binning the k-dependent values of ERk the averages in each
bin show a clear and systematic trend toward preferred
conservation of proteins that interact on a high level (Fig.
1a). Significant Pearson's and Spearman's rank coefficients support our qualitative observations [see Additional file 1].
Evolutionary retention of interacting pairs of proteins
While we find that the conservation of single proteins is a
function of connectedness we wonder if topology also
contains such evolutionary signals on the level of interactions. Because proteins which are placed in cohesive areas
(i.e. modules) tend to be evolutionary conserved we wonder if their interactions are conserved too. We utilize a
link-based clustering coefficient that reflects the degree of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/8

clustering of an interaction's immediate network neighborhood, a topological measure that allows for correlations between local clustering and the actual reliability of
observed interactions [38]. Similar to the single protein
case, we grouped all interactions according to their hypergeometric clustering coefficient Cvw and determined the
respective fraction of interacting pairs that are fully conserved as putative orthologs in each bin. In the absence of
a correlation between evolutionary conservation and an
interactions placement in the network the ratio of the Cvwdependent and random fractions of orthologous protein
pairs – defined as the interaction based excess retention
ERCvw (see Materials and Methods) – would be unity.
Logarithmically binning all interactions according to their
local degree of clustering Cvw and determining the average
excess retention ERCvw in each bin we identify a significant and systematic trend of proteins engaged in highly
clustered interactions to be preferably evolutionary conserved [Fig. 1b, see Additional file 1]. These link-based
observations are not only consistent with previous nodebased results but also allow to suggest that standard single-node measurements of evolutionary conservation can
be extended to their neighboring links. This evolutionary
corollary indicates that not only single proteins are a target of evolution but also the interactions between conserved proteins.
Perturbation analysis
To demonstrate this gain of evolutionary information, we
simulated the impact of extremely high false negatives
rates of protein interactions by removing up to 70% of
experimentally determined links between randomly
selected protein pairs. Additionally, to address the effects
of false positives, we randomly distributed up to 70%
more interactions than were previously identified in the
original Yeast network.

Because there are no significant differences in the distributions of organism-specific excess retention in Fig. 1, we
examine orthologs of C. elegans as a representative comparative set for these analyzes. After generating 1, 000 different realizations to each case of incomplete false data,
we determine the excess retention ER of proteins and their
interactions that have orthologs in C. elegans according to
their degree k and hypergeometric clustering coefficient
Cvw. Determining the average excess retention in bins of
increasing logarithmic size we find that the relationship
between excess retention, level of interaction and local
clustering is widely unaltered (single proteins: Figs. 2a,b;
protein interactions: Figs. 2c,d). Addressing the statistical
significance of these results we determined correlation

between randomly selected protein pairs, mimicking false negatives. (b) Simulating the effects of false positives, we randomly
added 10–70% more interactions than originally present in the network. In each case, we averaged the degree dependent
excess retention of interacting proteins ERk that have orthologs in C. elegans over 1, 000 different samples. Analogously, we
assessed the consequences of false negative orthologs by eliminating 10–70% of the proteins present in the set of worm
orthologs ((a) inset). Mimicking the presence of false positive orthologs we labeled 10–70% more proteins as orthologs in
worm that were originally present ((b) inset). Analogously, we test the robustness of the trend that highly clustered interactions (as exemplified by the hypergeometric clustering coefficient Cvw) are indeed predominantly conserved (as exemplified by
a link based excess retention ERCvw ) toward the presence of false negative (c) and false positive (d) interactions and
orthologs (insets). In each case, we observe that the initial (empirically derived) ascending trend prevails, results which are further supported by strong and significant Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
scores [see Additional file 1]. Error bars indicate the standard deviations from the mean excess retention in each bin.

(a) Accounting for the expression coefficients of all protein pairs in Yeast, we observe a bell shaped frequency distribution of
the expression correlation coefficient rP, peaking around 0.0 (initial). Focusing on interacting pairs of Yeast proteins that both
have an ortholog in P. falciparum and score above a certain threshold t of the respective hypergeometric clustering coefficient
Cvw we observe shifted frequency distributions of the expression correlation coefficients rP. This observation is further indicated by significant Students t-test scores [see Additional file 1]. (b) Assuming that those interactions constituted by Yeast
proteins with an ortholog are conserved as well in P. falciparum, we determined frequency distributions of expression correlation coefficients rP in this organism. Similarly to (a), we find significant shifts toward enforced coexpression if we focus on conserved interactions in Plasmodium that were embedded in an increasingly cohesive neighborhood in Yeast. Comparing our
results to a background distribution of coexpression correlations of all protein pairs in P. falciparum Students t-test scores indicate the significance of our results [see Additional file 1]. (c) The significant shifts toward elevated levels of coexpression allow
us to assume that there exists a pronounced correlation between the local cohesiveness of an interaction and the tendency
that the involved proteins are coexpressed. Logarithmically binning data points according to their hypergeometric clustering
coefficient Cvw in Yeast, we determined the mean expression correlation rP in each bin, allowing us to observe a positive and significant trend that interacting Yeast proteins having an ortholog in P. falciparum are increasingly coexpressed if they are placed
in a cohesive neighborhood (inset, Pearson's r = 0.38, P = 8.8 × 10-44, Spearman's rank ρ = 0.41, P = 2.8 × 10-47). Similarly, we
observe qualitatively the same trend considering interactions in P. falciparum that have been inferred from Yeast protein interactions which have an ortholog in P. falciparum (Pearson's r = 0.25, P = 1.9 × 10-27, Spearman's rank ρ = 0.27, P = 2.1 × 10-30).
Error bars indicate the standard deviation from the mean coexpression coefficient in each bin. (d) Concluding, we observe a
perturbation persistent coincidence of (i) coexpression of interacting proteins, (ii) an enhanced clustering of their immediate
neighborhood and (iii) their elevated tendency to be evolutionary conserved (yellow circles) in S. cerevisiae. Since high clustering around a certain protein interaction coincide well with an elevated reliability the integration of knowledge about the local
clustering of an interacting pair of conserved proteins and their tendency to be coexpressed can be used to infer evolutionary
core protein interactions in other organisms for which orthologs can be identified.

coefficients (Pearson's r and Spearman's rank ρ) and performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, recovering significant
similarities between the original and perturbed distributions [see Additional file 1].
Moreover, to represent missed orthologs, we randomly
eliminated up to 70% from the set of Yeast proteins that
have an ortholog in C. elegans. In turn, we randomly
labeled up to 70% more proteins as orthologs in C. elegans
than were previously present in the initial set. Sampling 1,
000 different realizations each, we calculated the excess
retention according to the proteins degree k and local clustering around each interaction Cvw. Logarithmically binning the results thus obtained we averaged the excess
retention of orthologous proteins in each bin, allowing us
to find that the introduction of noise on the level of
orthologs determination does not alter our initial observations (single proteins: insets Figs. 2a,b; protein interactions: insets Figs. 2c,d). Significantly similar correlation
coefficients and Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores [see Additional file 1] support our conclusions.
Clustering, coexpression and evolutionary conservation
The observation that highly clustered links between evolutionarily conserved proteins are reliable and stable
toward severe perturbation enhances our expectation that
an elevated degree of coexpression of interacting proteins
will retain this relationship as well. In particular, a strong
coexpression signal of the orthologs of proteins that
embrace the interactions in question would strongly indicate the actual presence of the interaction in a reference
and target organism. As a test case, we extend our investigations to the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a
single celled organism that has 895 putative orthologous
proteins with Yeast. Elucidating those Yeast interactions
between yeast proteins conserved in P. falciparum, we find
a web of 3, 071 interactions among 659 proteins in P. falciparum. To evaluate the quality of these inferred interactions we utilized a comprehensive set of P. falciparum
specific coexpression data [39] to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficients rP for the inferred protein interactions. In the same way, we utilized an extensive set of
Yeast coexpression data [40] to investigate the coexpression tendency of those interacting Yeast proteins that
served as the template for the inferred interactions in Plasmodium. In both cases, we use the Yeast specific Cvw values as an approximate measure of an interaction's
reliability. Focusing on interactions that score above
increasing thresholds of Cvw, we observe a strong shift
toward coexpression of the considered protein pairs (Fig.
3a,b). The difference between the individual coexpression
patterns is further indicated by significant Students t-test
scores when the Cvw dependent distributions are compared to a background distribution of coexpression coefficients of all protein pairs in the considered organism [see

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/8

Additional file 1]. The significant shifts toward elevated
levels of coexpression identify a pronounced correlation
between the local cohesiveness of an interaction and the
tendency that the involved proteins are coexpressed. The
determination of mean coexpression coefficients rP of
interactions that have been logarithmically grouped
according to their Cvw allows us to find a statistically significant trend toward elevated levels of coexpression of
conserved yeast interactions that are placed in highly clustered neighborhood (inset, Fig. 3c). Although we adopt
measurements of the local cohesiveness around links Cvw
from Yeast, we find that the corresponding interactions in
Plasmodium exhibit a similar trend (Fig. 3c). Remarkably,
the latter distribution exhibits better and statistically more
significant correlation coefficients than its template in
Yeast [see Additional file 1].
In the same way we investigated the stability of the interactions propensity to be evolutionary conserved, we
checked for the robustness of the obtained correlation
between local clustering and coexpression. Mimicking the
presence of false positive/negative links we randomly
eliminated/added up to 70 % of interactions in the Yeast
interaction network. Recalculating the hypergeometric
clustering coefficient for each of 1,000 runs, we grouped
all interacting pairs of Yeast proteins with an ortholog in
P. falciparum according to Cvw in bins of logarithmically
increasing size. Averaging over the respective coexpression
correlation coefficient rP of all Yeast interactions in each
bin, we observe that the initial ascending trend prevails
[see Fig. 1ab of Additional file 1]. Assuming that all interactions between proteins that have an ortholog in Plasmodium were conserved we repeated this procedure by
superimposing and averaging over the respective coexpression correlation values of Plasmodium. Similar to the
Yeast specific case, we observe the same qualitative trends
[see Fig. 2ab of Additional file 1]. Significant correlation
coefficients and Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores support our
observations of our findings. In the same way, we simulated the presence of false positive /negative orthologs by
eliminating/adding up to 70% of orthologs in P. falciparum. Averaging over 1,000 runs each, we determined the
average coexpression coefficient in each bin utilizing Plasmodium and Yeast specific coexpression data. In each
case, we find that the original trend of high local clustering around interactions coincides with an increased propensity to be coexpressed strongly prevails [see Figs. 1, 2bc
of Additional file 1], observations that are supported by
significant correlation coefficients and Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores [see Additional file 1].

Discussion & conclusion
Extending a previous study indicating that highly interacting proteins are predominantly conserved in evolution we
generalize the concept that evolutionary signals are car-

ried by the topology of the underlying protein interaction
network. In particular, a protein's propensity to be conserved while interacting with a high number of partners –
a node-based evolutionary signal – has a link based counterpart, as indicated by the propensity of interacting proteins to be evolutionary conserved with increasing local
clustering around the interaction in question. Although
the obtained correlations are significant, the alarmingly
high error rates in the determination of protein interactions cast doubt on the obtained results.
By focusing on perturbation events on node and interaction levels, we observe that extreme error rates of both
protein interactions and orthologs do not ablate the evolutionary signal carried by the network structure. The
introduction of noise at the node, by simulation of inconsistent determination of orthologs, does not override the
preference of highly connected nodes to be evolutionary
conserved; as theoretically predicted, random perturbations will rarely affect a hub in a scale-free network [41].
The low probability that a hub is hit by a random perturbation event also explains that interacting proteins that
are placed in a highly clustered environment retain their
evolutionary signal. Indeed, the definition of the hypergeometric clustering coefficient assures a high score for
interacting proteins that share a lot of their interaction
partners.
On an interaction level, we observe that the massive insertion/deletion of links does not obliterate the local structure of networks as indicated by the stable preference of
highly connected proteins and protein pairs that are
embedded in a well clustered neighborhood to be evolutionary conserved. In particular, we conclude that insertion/deletion of random links on average impact sparsely
connected parts of the networks much more than densely
connected ones; indeed, loss of information in highly
clustered neighborhoods and highly connected hubs
would require massive, targeted deletion/insertion of
links to obliterate their local structure. Therefore, the
observation that links which are placed in a highly clustered neighborhood are highly reliable [38] is nested in
our observation that highly clustered neighborhoods
compensate severe random perturbations much better
than sparsely connected ones.
While our results allow us to conclude that degree alone is
a robust indicator for a proteins propensity to be evolutionary conserved, the inherent topological robustness of
locally clustered links emphasizes the emergent role of
cohesive areas [26] as mediators of evolutionary information. In the simplest case, we confirmed that not only single proteins are a potential target of evolution but
interaction among them can be potentially conserved as
well. As a strong indicator that an interaction indeed has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/8

been conserved, the correlation between high local clustering and evolutionary conservation is accompanied by a
stable elevated degree of coexpression of the interacting
proteins in both a model and target organism. Superimposing the extreme error rates simulating the incoherent
determination of orthologs and interactions as well we see
that trends in both the model and target organism prevail,
strongly indicating that evolution also happens on the
level of interactions and putative bundles of interactions.
Although we utilized very noisy and inconsistent data of
protein interactions and putative orthologs, we see that
high connectivity and high clustering on average harbor
significantly more evolutionary relevant information that
sparsely connected and clustered areas. The coincidence of
(i) high local clustering around highly reliable interactions of proteins, (ii) their propensity to be evolutionary
conserved, (iii) their tendency to be coexpressed even in
the face of tremendous experimental noise sketches a
hypothetical framework to infer an evolutionary core of
single protein-protein interactions by elucidating interacting proteins of a reference organism that have orthologs in
the targeted organism. The quality of an interaction is
assessed by calculating the corresponding hypergeometric
clustering coefficient. Choosing the highest scoring – thus
most reliable – ortholog interaction allows the selection
of a core interaction network in the targeted organism.
Unlike our case, where evolutionary relationships
between proteins were approximated by similarity
searches, the quality of predicted interactions will be
enhanced by utilizing more sophisticated methods (such
as tree-base methods) which allow a more reliable assignment of orthology. Finally, the cross-validation with high
resolution coexpression data can refine specific proteinprotein interaction subnetworks, allowing for checks of
the actual presence of a proposed interaction. Ultimately,
such a framework would allow a first insight into evolutionary conserved parts in interactomes of organism for
which no interaction data currently exists.

Methods
Protein interactions
As a source of protein interactions we chose the DIP database [36] which provides a set of manually curated protein-protein interactions in the organism S. cerevisiae. The
current version contains 3, 833 proteins involved in 11,
942 interactions derived from combined, non-overlapping data which are mostly obtained from the highthroughput application of the two-hybrid method.
Assignment of orthology
Orthologs are genes in different species that originate
from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these
species. Such genes often have retained identical biological roles in present day organisms, indicated by a high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/8

degree of sequence homology. Unfortunately, orthology
analysis between organisms is often difficult and error
prone because of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. As a source of reliable and robust information about orthologous relationships between proteins in
different species we utilized the InParanoid database
[37,42] which provides putative orthologous sequence
information for S. cerevisiae and numerous other organisms. The algorithm for assigning orthologous relationships is based on pairwise similarity scores which are by
default calculated with the BLASTP program. Best pairwise
hits between the proteomes of two species are seeds –
labeled as the main ortholog groups – of orthologous protein sequence clusters. In a further step, other sequences
are added to this group if they are closely homologous to
one of the main orthologs, members of orthologous
groups which are called in-paralogs. In a final quality
checking step, confidence values for each ortholog and inparalog is determined allowing the detection of putative
orthologous relationships that has been only reliably possible by multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees previously [37]. In our study, we considered the main ortholog
pairs of each orthologous group as sequences that are
putatively orthologous to each other allowing us to obtain
1, 928 Yeast proteins with orthologs in H. sapiens, 2,073
in A. thaliana, 1, 885 in C. elegans, 1, 885 in M. musculus,
1,631 in D. melanogaster and 895 in P. falciparum.
Hypergeometric clustering coefficient
Recently, a network topology based approach uncovered
a remarkable correlation between enhanced quality of
protein interactions and the degree of clustering of their
immediate network neighborhood [38]. Considering a
protein-protein interaction network with N nodes, we
define the hypergeometric clustering coefficient as

min

Cvw = − log

(


 N(v)
N( v ) , N( w ) ) 
i


∑

i = N ( v )∩ N ( w )


 N − N ( v )

  N ( w ) −i


 N
 N(w)














(1)

where N(x) represents the neighborhood of a vertex x.
Given fixed neighborhood sizes N(v) and N(w) of proteins v and w, the hypergeometric clustering coefficient
increases with elevated overlap between the protein's
neighborhoods. Provided that the neighborhoods are
independent, the summation can be interpreted as a p
value, reflecting the probability of obtaining a number of
mutual neighbors between proteins v and w at or above
the observed number by chance.
Orthologous excess retention
According to their hypergeometric clustering coefficient
Cvw of the interactions they are involved in, we grouped all

interactions in groups of same Cvw that have been rounded
to integers. For each group of NCvw proteins, the fraction
of interacting pairs of proteins that both have an ortholog
in an other organism is defined as eCvw ,o = nCvw ,o / NCvw .
In the absence of a correlation between evolutionary conservation of interacting protein pairs and their position in
the network, eCvw ,o has the general Cvw-independent value
eo = no/N, where no is the total number of interactions
between Yeast proteins that have an ortholog, and N is the
total number of Yeast protein interactions in the underlying network. Thus, we define the clustering-dependent
excess retention of such proteins as ERCvw ,o = eCvw ,o / eo
which has the Cvw-independent value ERCvw ,o = 1 for a
random distribution of orthologous proteins [20]. Basically, we applied the same framework for single proteins,
by grouping them according to their degree k. For each
group of Nk proteins, the fraction of proteins that also
have an ortholog is defined as ek,o = nk,o/Nk. Analogously,
the node based excess retention ERk is defined as ERk = ek,o/
Ek, where Ek is the ratio of all proteins with an ortholog in
the whole network.
Coexpression data
To evaluate the quality of these inferred interactions we
utilized a comprehensive set of Plasmodium specific [39]
and Yeast specific [40] coexpression data. In each dataset,
we utilized the expression profiles to determine the
respective Pearson's correlation coefficient rP for each
interacting pair of proteins.
Logarithmic binning
To guarantee balanced sampling of our distributions we
generally use logarithmic binning of the respective x-axis,
a procedure for curve estimation that corrects for the
skewed nature of the scale-free distribution.

On a logarithmic scale, we define the bin size

The advantage of logarithmic binning is an elevated
degree of noise reduction which is dependent on the bin
size [41,43]. Although this procedure causes a loss of
accuracy, we still uncover the buried trends to a satisfying
extent applying our statistical methods on the binned
data.
