KBWS: an EMBOSS associated package for
accessing bioinformatics web services
Kazuki Oshita, Kazuharu Arakawa* and Masaru Tomita

Abstract
The availability of bioinformatics web-based services is rapidly proliferating, for their interoperability and ease of
use. The next challenge is in the integration of these services in the form of workflows, and several projects are
already underway, standardizing the syntax, semantics, and user interfaces. In order to deploy the advantages of
web services with locally installed tools, here we describe a collection of proxy client tools for 42 major
bioinformatics web services in the form of European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) UNIX
command-line tools. EMBOSS provides sophisticated means for discoverability and interoperability for hundreds of
tools, and our package, named the Keio Bioinformatics Web Service (KBWS), adds functionalities of local and
multiple alignment of sequences, phylogenetic analyses, and prediction of cellular localization of proteins and RNA
secondary structures. This software implemented in C is available under GPL from http://www.g-language.org/
kbws/ and GitHub repository http://github.com/cory-ko/KBWS. Users can utilize the SOAP services implemented in
Perl directly via WSDL file at http://soap.g-language.org/kbws.wsdl (RPC Encoded) and http://soap.g-language.org/
kbws_dl.wsdl (Document/literal).
Background
With more than 1700 services listed in the BioCatalogue
at the time of this writing [1], a significant number of
biological resources and tools is provided as web-based
services, in light of their advantages in interoperability,
ease of use, and the lack of requirements for the compute
infrastructure as well as the effort in installation and
maintenance [2]. Several efforts have already utilized
hundreds of these resources with the aim to effectively
integrate them into a bioinformatics cyberinfrastructure,
allowing the creation and management of research workflows through syntactic and semantic integration [3]. BioMoby project [4] maintains a repository of service
descriptions with controlled vocabularies so that services
can be discovered from their purpose and from their
input/output data types, and MOWServ project [5]
further classifies and curates the services in order to
allow automatic workflow creation [6]. A number of clients with rich graphical user interface such as Seahawk
[7] and Taverna [8] are also available as front-end
research environment.

While the advent of web-based services is expected
to proliferate further especially in light of the introduction of next-generation sequencers and their huge
masses of data [9], local tools will continue to be
important for numerous purposes, and web-based services need to be integrated with these local tools.
Therefore, here we present the Keio Bioinformatics
Web Service (KBWS), a collection of proxy client tools
for 42 major bioinformatics web-based services in the
form of European Molecular Biology Open Software
Suite (EMBOSS) [10] associated software (EMBASSY)
package of UNIX command-line utilities. EMBOSS is
one of the most widely used collection of more than
200 bioinformatics tools, which takes advantage of the
UNIX environment for “piping” with any other UNIX
commands. With its Ajax Command Definitions
(ACD), EMBOSS is well curated with controlled vocabularies and semantics so that the tools are highly
documented (with tfm command), discoverable (with
wossname command), and interoperable. Advantages of
the EMBOSS platform also includes a unified sequence
data retrieval system with Universal Sequence Address
(USA) as well as the availability of many front-end

Implementation
KBWS is composed of two parts: a proxy web server
providing SOAP service wrapper to bioinformatics web
services, and UNIX command-line clients in the form
of EMBOSS tools that access the proxy web server. By
making the clients access the proxy server instead of
the original service providers, the clients can be lightweight. Therefore, same client tool can be used without update or maintenance even the original service
providers change their formats, and KBWS can utilize
bioinformatics web-based services provided in any protocol (such as SOAP, REST - Representational State
Transfer, or browser-based CGI - Common Gateway
Interface) of any versions [15]. This proxy server is
able to deal immediately with specification change of
original service by regular automatic monitoring to
check whether the proxy server returns correct report.
Even if the original server is down, KBWS is able to
stably provide same services without update to the client tools, by switching the server to analogous webbased services at the proxy server. Moreover, users can
access the proxy server via SOAP, which provides all
42 services under the same programming interface
defined in a single Web Service Description Language
(WSDL). WSDL files that are provided as RPC
Encoded style and Document/literal style allow access
to KBWS from web-based services client software or
programming languages. The proxy server provides
access to 9 SOAP services, 3 REST services, 31 CGI
services and 1 service installed in the web server, and
is implemented using SOAP::Transport::HTTP Perl
module. Three services provided by NCBI, EBI, and
DDBJ, respectively, are used for a single tool kblast,
and therefore there is a total of 42 tools accessing 44
services. List of supported web services in KBWS is
shown in Table 1.
Each of the 42 UNIX command-line clients accesses
a unique bioinformatics web service through KBWS
proxy. These tools are implemented as EMBASSY
package in C programming language with gSOAP
Toolkit [16], and are available under GNU General
Public License from http://www.g-language.org/kbws/
and GitHub repository http://github.com/cory-ko/
KBWS. Detailed documentation for each of the tools
are available through the EMBOSS tfm (The Fine Manual) command, and tools can be searched and discovered with wossname utility. As an EMBOSS package,
KBWS can be utilized with graphical user interfaces
through JEMBOSS and wEMBOSS, and browser-based
access with EMBOSS Explorer is also available at our

Results and Discussion
The following set of commands comprises a workflow
for generating a sequence logo image for a set of
amino acid sequences of FOXP2 [17], using BLAST
web service (kblast), extracting the list of IDs (sed and
uniq), aligning the sequences with MUSCLE (kmuscle),
extracting a certain region from the alignment (extractalign), and generating its sequence logo (kweblogo).
Output from this workflow is shown in Figure 1. The
definition of “swissprot” database used in the following
workflow is available at http://soap.g-language.org/
kbws/embossrc.
# search similar sequence in Swiss-Prot database using
BLAST
% kblast swissprot:FOXP2_HUMAN -d swissprot -format k1 -eval 1e-50 -outfile kblast.out
# extract ID list from BLAST report
% sed ‘s/^\(.*\)\.[1-9]/swissprot:\1/g’ kblast.out | uniq >
match_list.out
# multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE
% kmuscle @match_list.out -outfile kmuscle.fasta
# Extract a region from the alignment
% extractalign -regions ‘420-430’ kmuscle.fasta -outseq
extractalign.fasta
# Generation of sequence logos using WebLogo
% kweblogo extractalign.fasta
Other example workflows are available at myExperiment (http://www.myexperiment.org/) website as
Taverna workflow (http://www.myexperiment.org/users/
1938/workflows).
Sample codes written by Perl, Ruby, Python and Java
are also available at http://www.g-language.org/wiki/
kbws/.
KBWS provides 42 web-based services as an
EMBOSS package. EMBOSS is already widely used
in numerous laboratories, and therefore users can
readily integrate web-based services with their
EMBOSS tools and UNIX commands using KBWS.
Moreover, KBWS adds the advantages of web-based
services to the many functionalities of EMBOSS,
especially for tools like BLAST search that require
large regularly updated databases that are difficult to
be installed and maintained with EMBOSS in traditional manner. KBWS also does not require any
external software or data for installation except for
EMBOSS. As an EMBOSS package, KBWS is welldocumented and can take advantage of the documentations and discovery tools, and can be used
from rich clients such as JEMBOSS, wEMBOSS, and
EMBOSS Explorer.
