Abstract
Background: HIV-1 envelope diversity remains a significant challenge for the development of an efficacious
vaccine. The evolutionary forces that shape the diversity of envelope are incompletely understood. HIV-1 subtype C
envelope in particular shows significant differences and unique characteristics compared to its subtype B
counterpart. Here we applied the single genome sequencing strategy of plasma derived virus from a cohort of
therapy naïve chronically infected individuals in order to study diversity, divergence patterns and envelope
characteristics across the entire HIV-1 subtype C gp160 in 4 slow progressors and 4 progressors over an average of
19.5 months.
Results: Sequence analysis indicated that intra-patient nucleotide diversity within the entire envelope was higher
in slow progressors, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). However, intra-patient nucleotide diversity
was significantly higher in slow progressors compared to progressors in the C2 (p = 0.0006), V3 (p = 0.01) and C3
(p = 0.005) regions. Increased amino acid length and fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) were
observed in the V1-V4 in slow progressors compared to progressors (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02 respectively). Similarly,
gp41 in the progressors was significantly longer and had fewer PNGs compared to slow progressors (p = 0.02 and
p = 0.02 respectively). Positive selection hotspots mapped mainly to V1, C3, V4, C4 and gp41 in slow progressors,
whereas hotspots mapped mainly to gp41 in progressors. Signature consensus sequence differences between the
groups occurred mainly in gp41.
Conclusions: These data suggest that separate regions of envelope are under differential selective forces, and that
envelope evolution differs based on disease course. Differences between slow progressors and progressors may
reflect differences in immunological pressure and immune evasion mechanisms. These data also indicate that the
pattern of envelope evolution is an important correlate of disease progression in chronic HIV-1 subtype C infection.

Background
The rate of disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals is determined by a complex interplay of viral characteristics, host genetic factors, immune responses and
environmental factors. The high viral replication rate,
the lack of proof-reading mechanism by the HIV reverse
transcriptase enzyme, and high recombination rate are
characteristics that ensure that the virus continuously

mutates and evolves, resulting in both HIV diversification and viral escape from host immune responses [1,2].
Viral diversity and the constant generation of new viral
quasispecies that may not be recognized or eliminated
by the host immune mechanisms, particularly contemporaneous virus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells or neutralizing antibodies, are major impediments for the
development of an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine [3,4].
The HIV-1 envelope (Env) subunits gp120 and gp41
are the only viral proteins that are exposed on the virus
surface, and they are under continuous host selective
pressure, as they are key determinants of the target host
cell range and are important targets of neutralizing

antibodies and CD8 T cell responses. Specific Env
sequence characteristics such as the overall amino acid
diversity, the number of putative N-linked glycosylation
sites (PNGs), and the length of variable loops have been
shown to influence or correlate with antibody neutralization sensitivity, cell tropism, co-receptor utilization
and virus transmission [5-7]. Studies of Env diversity
can also provide important clues for selective forces that
may significantly influence the rate of disease progression or alternatively identify specific regions of the Env
protein that comprise important targets of effective
immune pressure which may be important considerations in rational HIV-1 vaccine design.
In HIV-1 subtype B, the relationship between HIV-1
Env diversity and disease progression is complex, as illustrated by a series of studies. In one early study, HIV-1
Env hypervariable region 3 (V3 loop) diversity was
shown to increase with time [8]. A subsequent study
showed that Env hypervariable regions 3 to 5 (V3 to
V5) diversity was directly associated with duration of
patient survival, positive selection for change, and inversely correlated with the rate of disease progression as
measured by the slope of CD4+ T cell loss [9]. Another
study that examined Env C2-V5 sequences in men followed for 6 to 12 years following seroconversion
demonstrated a complex pattern of viral diversity characterized by an early phase of linear increases in divergence and diversity, followed by an intermediate phase
with increase in divergence but stabilization or decline
of diversity, and a final phase showing stabilization or
reduction in divergence and continued stability or
decline in diversity [10]. In another study, analysis of
C2-V5 Env sequences among typical progressors versus
slow progressors showed that the typical progressors
exhibited higher diversity, lower intra- and inter-sample
divergence, evidence of lower host selective pressure
and increases in both synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions over time while only non-synonymous substitutions increased in slow progressors [11].
The aforementioned studies and a comprehensive
body of similar studies on HIV-1 diversity, divergence,
and host selective forces that may impact on disease
progression have been performed on HIV-1 subtype B
[10,12-18]. Furthermore, these studies clearly demonstrate that patterns of Env diversity, divergence, and
associated selective pressures identified can differ
according to the stage of disease, the sampling methodology, the region of Env analyzed, the founder virus,
and the host genetic background.
HIV-1 subtype C is the most rapidly spreading subtype
worldwide [19,20], and an effective global vaccine will
have to show efficacy against this subtype. A number of
studies have explored Env diversity and diversification
within HIV-1 subtype C [21,22] but data on this subtype

remain relatively limited, despite accumulating evidence
that this subtype may differ significantly from HIV-1 subtype B in certain biological properties mediated by the
Env gene [21-25]. In particular, possible differences in
Env diversity, divergence, and selective pressures between
HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals with divergent
rates of disease progression remain understudied.
In this study, we used single genome amplification and
sequencing to explore the evolution of the Env gp160
protein. Specifically, we investigated differences in diversity and divergence in 4 slow progressors and 4 progressors of black African descent infected with HIV-1
subtype C. Further, we investigated differences in Env
features such as the extent of putative N-linked glycosylation, lengths of the variable and constant regions of
gp160, and positive selection in slow-progressors and
progressors in order to assess the correlation of these
variables with rates of disease progression.

Materials and methods
Participants

Participant samples were retrospectively identified from
the Sinikithemba cohort, which is a prospective natural
history study of HIV-1 infected individuals based at
McCord Hospital, Durban, South Africa as previously
reported [26]. Ethics approval was obtained from the
University of KwaZulu-Natal Biomedical Research Ethics
Committee and all participants gave written informed
consent to participate in the study. CD4 counts were
performed at three month intervals whereas viral loads
were done at six month intervals.
For this substudy, CD4 count was chosen as the primary determinant of disease progression for stratification into slow progressor and progressor categories.
Both slow progressors and progressors were selected on
the basis of a CD4 cell counts >500 cells/μl at study
entry time point. However, at study exit, slow progressors maintained a CD4 count above 500 cells/μl or a
viral load less than 10,000 viral RNA copies/ml. In contrast, progressors declined in CD4 counts to below 500
cells/μl and had a viral load above 10,000 copies/ml.
The overall average follow up time was 19.5 months. All
individuals were antiretroviral therapy naive before and
during the window of evaluation. When the virological
and immunological data became available beyond the
study window (follow-up of an average of 39.8 months
for slow progressors and 36.8 months for progressors,
we analyzed these parameters relative to the study entry
criteria and they remain statistically different for the
progressors only (p = 0.03 for both CD4 and viral load).
Sample Collection, CD4 T cell counts and Plasma Viral Load

Blood was drawn from each subject into EDTA tubes
and plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored
at −80°C until use. Viral load was measured using the

Archary et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:92
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/92

Amplicor Version 1.5 assay (Roche, Alameda CA, USA).
CD4+ T-cell counts were enumerated by Trucount technology on a four colour FACS Calibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA).
cDNA synthesis and single genome amplification

HIV-1 RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and single genome amplification were performed as previously
reported with some modifications[27]. Briefly, primers
were designed for the efficient amplification of HIV-1
subtype C envelope through nested PCR. For the first
round PCR, the external primers used were VIF1: 5’GGGTTTATTACAGGGACAGCAGAG-3’ (HXB2 positions 4900-4923) and OFM19: 5’-GCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTA-3’ (HXB2 positions 96049632). Primers for the second round PCR reaction were
ENV A: 5’-GCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAA-3’ (HXB2 positions 5954-5982) and ENV N: 5’CTGCCAATCAGGGAAGTAGCCTTGTGT-3’ (HXB2
positions 9145-9171) [27]. Cycling conditions for first
round PCR were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 35 cycles of
94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 68°C 4 min, and final
extension of 68°C for 20 min followed by hold at 4°C.
Second round PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for
2 min, 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec,
68°C for 4 min; final extension at 68°C for 20 min and
4°C hold. PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose
gel and amplicons were purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
Sequencing analysis of gp160

The full-length envelopes were sequenced in the forward
and reverse directions using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), utilizing primers spanning the
entire envelope and approximately 300 bp apart.
Sequences were then resolved on the ABI 3130 XL
genetic analyzer. Contigs were assembled and edited
using the Sequencher v 4.8 software (Genecodes, Ann
Arbor, MI). The sequences were aligned using Clustal W
[28] and manually edited in the Genetic Data Environment (GDE 2.2). For phylogenetic analysis, subtype reference strains were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV
sequence database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/
sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html). Phylogenetic trees
were generated in PAUP*4.0b10 using the TVM I + G
model of substitution as determined by MODELTEST
3.7 [29]. Trees were rooted with a homologous region of
Group O reference (O.CM.96). Maximum likelihood
(ML) trees of sequences from individual patients were
also drawn using the appropriate evolutionary model (as
determined by MODELTEST 3.7) and rooted with the
“Best-fit root” as determined by Path-O-Gen v1.2 [30].
All trees were bootstrapped with 1,000 sampling

Page 3 of 12

replicates. Trees were viewed with FigTree v1.1.2 [30].
The approximate time of HIV-1 infection was estimated
using BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling
Trees) version 1.4.8 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) in order to
predict approximate time of infection prior to study
enrollment [31]. BEAUTi was used to generate the .xml
file to generate the BEAST file. The GTR substitution
model with estimated base frequencies and a site heterogeneity model of gamma + invariant sites were used. A
relaxed, uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model
was chosen. The MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain)
length of chain was set at 30,000,000 to give an effective
sample size (ESS) > 170. The number and location of
putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) were estimated using N-GlycoSite (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/GLYCOSITE/glycosite.html) from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory database. Sequence diversity
was calculated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood option in Mega 4.0 [32]. Characteristic differences
between progressors and slow progressors including corresponding study entry and exit time-points were identified using VESPA (Viral Epidemiology Signature Pattern
Analysis) [33]. Nucleotide substitution rates were calculated using baseml from the PAML software package
[34]. Sites under positive selection were identified using
the SLAC option in HyPhy [35] and CODEML as implemented in the PAML software package.
Positively selected sites and signature mutations were
mapped onto the X-ray structure of a clade C HIV-1
gp120 (3LQA.pdb) [36] using the BIOPREDICTA module in the VLifeMDS software package (VLife Science
Technologies, 2007). Gp41 was modeled in SWISSMODEL [37] using 1ENV.pdb [38] as a template. Structures were rendered and annotated in PyMol [39].
Statistical analyses

Pairwise comparisons of different parameters including
genetic diversity, PNGs, and length polymorphism
between subjects in the two groups were calculated by
the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test using the
GraphPad Prism 5 software programme unless otherwise
stated. Correlations were regarded as statistically significant with a p value < 0.05. All reported p values are for
two-sided tests.
Genebank accession numbers

Sequences have been assigned the following GenBank
accession numbers: GU216702-GU216737 and
GU216739-GU216847.

Results
Study participant characteristics

There were eight participants in this study, seven female
and one male. The average age of the participants was

Archary et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:92
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/92

34 years old (range: 22-59 years). At study entry, both
progressors and slow progressors did not differ in their
CD4 T cell counts (medians of 621 cells/μl versus 571
cells/μl (p = 0.39) as shown in figure 1. However, at
study exit the median CD4 count of slow progressors
was 506 cells/μl, which is not significantly different from
the CD4 count at study entry (p = 0.7), while the progressors’ median CD4 count had significantly declined
to 283 cells/μl, (p = 0.03). Slow progressors also had no
significant difference for viral load (p = 1.0, data not
shown) between study entry and exit time-points,
whereas progressor participants had significantly lower
viral load (p = 0.03, data not shown) at study entry
compared to exit time-point. In addition, CD4 (figure 1)
and viral load (data not shown) were statistically
different for progressors only at the latest available
time-point compared to study entry (p = 0.03 for both
parameters). Furthermore, we used BEAST to estimate

Figure 1 CD4 of study entry, study exit and latest available
time-point data for slow progressors and progressors. The red
circles depict the data points for the slow-progressors. The blue
squares depict data points for the progressors. Red bars and blue
bars represent the p values for the slow progressors and progressors
respectively. Black bars represent p values for inter-group
comparison for the different time-points. NS = not significant. All
comparisons between the study entry, study exit and latest available
time-point parameters were performed using the Mann-Whitney
unpaired t test, and p values are shown. Differences were regarded
as statistically significant with a p value < 0.05. When slow
progressors were compared to progressors, the analysis yielded
significant differences when the CD4 at study exit and last available
time-points were compared - as shown above (p = 0.04 and p =
0.02 respectively). Likewise viral load was significantly different
between the groups at study exit and the latest available time-point
(p = 0.03 and p = 0.02 respectively, data not shown).

the approximate time of infection in both groups of participants. Slow progressors were estimated to be infected
for a mean period of 8.2 years (range 4.75-15 years)
compared with 2 years (range 0.75-3.75 years) for
progressors.
Phylogenetic relationships

To analyze phylogenetic relationships and changes in
envelope sequences in slow progressors and progressors
over a period 19.5 month follow-up, a mean of 9 single
genome full-length gp160 amplicons per participant per
timepoint(range 4-11 amplicons) for the study entry and
exit time-point were analyzed, for a total of 146
sequences. One of the slow-progressors (SK312) had a
few putative functional Env amplicons which were
included in the final analysis when compared to the
other study participants. This was due to a low number
of SGA-derived clones which was limited by the low
viral load and plasma sample availability. All participants’ consensus sequences bootstrapped confidently
with subtype C reference strains, as determined by a
Maximum Likelihood tree for each patient at each time
point (Figure 2A). As expected, consensus sequences
from the study entry and study exit for each patient
formed monophyletic groups.
Overall, there were no distinguishing phylogenetic patterns noted between sequences from the slow progressors and progressors (Figure 2A). Slow progressors
showed a more diverse pattern characterized by either
separate (sub)clusters at study entry and exit (Figure 2B
- SK035) or intermingling of sequences from early and
exit time points (Figure 2E - SK312). Additionally, phylogenetic clusters at study exit typically showed similar
(Figure 2C - SK036) or longer branch length (Figure 2D,
example subject - SK169), compared with that of the
study entry sequences. However, individual participant
sequence trees for the progressors tended to show segregation between entry and exit time-point sequences
(Figures 2F-I).
Intra-patient diversity analysis

Intra-patient diversity, defined as the mean pair-wise
nucleotide distance, was calculated by measuring distances between all sequences from a single individual at
a single time-point, and is shown alongside the phylogenetic trees (Figures 2B-I). Mean overall intra-patient
diversity was 2.75% for the four slow progressors and
2.21% for the four progressors (p = 0.07). The mean
baseline intra-patient nucleotide diversity for the slow
progressors was 2.63% (range 1.8-3.3%) and 1.42%
(range 1.0-2.0%) for the progressors, but this did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Study exit time
point mean intra-patient diversity was 2.88% (range 1.94.2%) and 3.0% (range 1.0-7.4%) for slow progressors

rooted with Group O as the outgroup. Figures 2B to 2E represent maximum likelihood trees for the slow progressor sequences and Figures 2F
to 2I represent trees for the progressor sequences. All trees were drawn in Paup* using the appropriate substitution model. Bootstrap support

and progressors, respectively, which was not a significant difference (p-value = 0.56). Collectively, these data
show that in this cohort, slow progressors trended to
higher intra-patient sequence diversity compared to progressors although the differences did not reach statistical
significance.
Nucleotide substitution rates in study entry and exit in
slow progressors and progressors

To examine the evolution of the envelope gene over the
study period, we calculated the rate of nucleotide divergence for each patient’s env sequences. On average the
nucleotide substitution rate was higher in the progressors (1.2 ×10-2 nucleotide substitutions/site/year; range

6-17 ×10-3), compared to the slow progressors (3 ×10-3
nucleotide substitutions/site/year; range 0.1-7 ×10-3), but
did not differ significantly (p = 0.12). The nucleotide
substitution rate appeared to follow the viral load pattern, such that there was a positive but non-significant
linear correlation between divergence (nucleotide substitution rate) and the log10 viral load (p = 0.12) - data not
shown.
Heterogeneity of diversity in Env in slow progressors and
progressors for the variable and constant regions

To assess whether there were overall differences in
diversity between regions of env at study entry and exit,
we analyzed distinct regions of the env gene separately

Archary et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:92
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/92

and compared diversity scores between the slow progressors and progressors for the five variable loops,
three constant regions and gp41 over time as seen in
Figure 3A. Significant diversity differences between slow
progressors and progressors were noted for the C2 (p =
0.004), V3 (p = 0.01) and C3 (p = 0.005), with differences remaining significant for C2 and C3 even after
applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
(≤ 0.006). There was no significant difference in overall
inter-patient percentage diversity between slow progressors and progressors for V1 (p = 0.12), V2 (p = 0.09),
V4 (p = 0.29), C4 (p = 0.13), V5 (p = 0.08) and gp41
(p = 0.40).
Next, we assessed the differences in inter-individual
env diversity patterns across env for study entry and exit
time-points. The results of this analysis are summarized
in Figure 3B for slow progressors and Figure 3C for progressors. There were no significant differences between
the early and exit time-point intra-patient diversity for
either of the groups in any of the regions.
Length polymorphisms and glycosylation patterns for the
variable and constant regions

Overall length of certain regions and changes in the
number of N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) in Env
have been shown to influence the sensitivity or resistance of the virus to antibody neutralization and may
also influence efficiency of interactions with receptors
on the cell surface [7,40]. However, these characteristics
have not been comprehensively analyzed for HIV-1 subtype C and most studies have focused on the V3 loop,
which is an important but not exclusive determinant of
viral tropism and cell entry [41]. We sought to determine whether Env sequence characteristics are associated with disease progression in HIV-1 subtype C.
Table 1 depicts Env region length polymorphisms and
numbers of PNGs in slow progressors and progressors
over time. Mean V1-V2 length for progressors and slow
progressors was 66 amino acids and 69 amino acids
respectively (Table 1) but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.32). Similarly, we observed no
differences in C4-V5 amino acid length (p = 0.29) or
PNGs (p = 0.15), and length polymorphism for C2-V3
showed no significant difference between the groups.
However, a significant difference was noted in the overall number of PNGs in C2-V3 between slow progressors
and progressors (p = 0.009), a result that remained significant after Bonferroni test correction (p < 0.01). For
C3-V4, slow progressors had a significantly higher mean
of 85 (range 81-90) compared to 82 (range: 76-88)
amino acids in progressors (p = 0.02), however analysis
of PNGs indicated no difference between the groups
(p = 0.96). Interestingly, there was a significant difference overall between the groups in the numbers of

Page 6 of 12

PNGs for C3 only in the progressors compared to the
slow progressors (p = 0.0006) (data not shown). V1-V4
length overall was significantly different, with slow progressors displaying longer V1-V4 length of 286 amino
acids (range 282-294) compared to progressors’ 281
(range 276-292; p = 0.009). In contrast, we found that
the numbers of PNGs for V1-V4 overall was significantly higher with a mean of 22, (range 20-23) in progressors compared to a mean of 20 (range 19-21) in
slow progressors (p = 0.02). Gp41 length was significantly higher in progressors (range 245-252) compared
to slow progressors (range 239-252; p = 0.02) (Table 1).
However, the number of PNGs in gp41 in slow progressors (range 3-5) was statistically different from those of
progressors (range 2-4 PNGs; p = 0.02).
Positive selection pressure

The dN/dS (ω) ratio reflects non-synonymous (dN) substitutions to synonymous (dS) substitutions per codon
site, with a value of >1 at any site indicating positive
selection pressure [42]. The ω values for the whole of
gp160, as well as the variable and constant regions
within envelope, were calculated using the M1a and
M2a models implemented in CODEML. The settings for
the M1a (neutral) model were: model = 0, NSsites = 1,
and for the M2a (selection) model were: model = 0,
NSsites = 2. A Likelihood Ratio Test (2ΔlnL) was performed between the likelihood scores of the M1a (null)
vs. M2a (alternative) models. A c2 test was performed
using two degrees of freedom [34]. For V1, the M2a
(selection) model was supported only in the slow progressors (p < 0.005). For V2 and V3, the null hypothesis
(M1a) could not be rejected for both slow and typical
progressors (p = 0.25), while the M2a model was supported for all remaining envelope regions (p < 0.005) for
both groups.
Analysis of the entire Env gp160 in the two groups
using CODEML and the SLAC option in HYPHY identified 9 common sites under positive selection in slow
progressors and 5 sites in progressors. In slow progressors (Figures 4A and 4B), these were at codons 87, 138
and 140 (V1), 336 and 340 (C3), 396 and 410 (V4), 460
(V5) and 832 (gp41). Most of the sites under positive
selection in slow progressors were either adjacent to a
putative N-linked glycosylation site (codons 87, 138, 336
and 410) or were located at N-linked glycosylation sites
(codons 140, 340, 396 and 460). Interestingly, positions
336 and 340 are within the a-2-helix (HXB2 position
335-352); it has been previously reported that changes
within this region may confer autologous antibody neutralization resistance [19].
For progressors (Figures 4C and 4D), 4 of 5 positively
selected sites were located in gp41 (codons 607, 612,
641 and 821), while the remaining site, codon 350, was

of V3. Two of the sites under positive selection in
the progressors were either adjacent to, (codon 612)
or located at a putative N-linked glycosylation site
(codon 641).
One additional site identified using CODEML, codon
671, is located at a linear epitope NWFNIT, which is
within the membrane proximal external region (MPER)
of gp41, an epitope that is well recognized by a broadly
neutralizing antibody (4E10) [43].
Signature sequence differences between slow progressors
and progressors

To identify key differences between the groups, consensus sequences of slow progressors and progressors study
entry and exit were generated in VESPA using an 80%

threshold (i.e. sequence differences were in >80% of the
sequences). Signature differences were noted at 6 amino
acid positions between the progressors and slow progressors consensus sequences. Four of six of these differences occurred in gp41 (codons 607, 727, 770 and
837), and the remaining two were at codons 80 and 133.
No signature differences were noted between the entry
and exit time points within each group.
Except for an N to S/D mutation in the progressors at
codon 80, which resulted in the gain of a casein-kinase2 (CK2) phosphorylation site at codons 77-80, most of
the signature changes were not at putative functional
sites. Other changes, although not in the signature, but
resulting in a change in putative functional sites in
the progressors, are: a V to T mutation at codon 455
resulting in the gain of a myristoylation site at codon

mapped onto a model of gp120 based on the X-ray structure of the gp120 core in complex with sCD4 and 21c Fab (3LQA.pdb) for slow
progressors - Figure 4A and for progressors - Figure 4C. V1V2 and V3 loops were drawn onto the core for completeness. In the orientation
shown, the cellular and viral membranes would be located above and below the protein respectively. Figure 4B and 4D represent ribbon

ALDSQWN epitope) resulting in the gain of a tyrosine
kinase phosphorylation (TKP) site at codons 665-667,
and an N to S mutation at codon 671 resulting in the
gain of a CK2 phosphorylation site at codons 671-674
within the NWFDIT epitope. Interestingly, the loss of a
putative N-linked glycosylation site in the progressors in
the V4 region was compensated for by a gain of an Nlinked glycosylation site in the C3 region (codons 362365). When these signature patterns were compared
with the subtype B reference strain, it was noted that an

L to V mutation at codon 800 in the subtype C signature sequences resulted in a loss of a putative leucine
zipper (codons 793-814). Whether the gain or loss of
putative functional sites influence viral pathogenesis
needs to be confirmed with functional assays.

Discussion
In this study we aimed to identify env sequence characteristics that may distinguish progressors from slow progressors in a chronically HIV infected anti-retroviral
naïve subtype C-infected cohort. We used a single

Archary et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:92
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/92

genome amplification approach in order to accurately
and comprehensively represent the diversity of viral
quasi-species. Several indicators of evolutionary forces
were used to elucidate putative differences between the
groups including heterogeneity of envelope sequence
diversity, Env length polymorphisms, numbers of PNGs,
positive selection, and signature sequence characteristics.
Our study suggests that regions of Env are shaped by
different evolutionary forces which may in turn leave
viral sequence footprints that may distinguish slow progressors from progressors in chronic HIV-1 subtype C
infection. It has previously been shown that in subtype
B infection there may be Env region-specific differences
in evolutionary forces between those with high versus
low viral loads [9]. Our study demonstrated a non-significant trend towards increased intra-patient diversity
in slow progressors, a finding consistent with other studies on HIV disease progression [44-46]. In contrast, a
study of primary HIV-1 subtype C infection has found
that increased envelope diversity is inversely correlated
with CD4 T cell counts and is associated with rapid disease progression [47]. Together, these results may imply
that evolutionary forces that drive HIV-1 subtype C
diversification differ according to the phase of infection.
On close examination of the envelope regions we found
that diversity in C2, V3 and C3 was higher in slow progressors compared to progressors suggesting co-evolution of these regions. These findings are consistent with
findings from other studies [48,49]. From a functionality
standpoint it appears that, because the V3 loop is very
important for viral entry, increased diversity in this
region is a correlate of viral attenuation [24].
Length polymorphisms in the constant and variable
envelope regions may also contribute to structural diversity in terms of glycan packing and protein folding of
the virion structure. An unusual finding was that the
longer V1-V4 in slow progressors had fewer PNG’s
whereas the longer gp41 domain contained fewer PNGs
in progressors. Several studies have shown the association between neutralization sensitivity and shorter V1V4 length [50,51]. In contrast, other studies have shown
longer V1-V4 with extensive glycosylation mask neutralizing antibody sensitive epitopes in subtype C [6]; however, in subtype B no such association was found [52].
Our observations may imply that longer length regions
may be masking neutralization sensitive epitopes as suggested by Gray et al. [47]. Additionally in progressors, a
loss of a glycan in V4 was compensated for by a gain in
a PNG within C3, implying a shifting glycan shield as
suggested previously [7].
High dN/dS ratios indicative of strong diversifying
selection due to humoral immune pressure [42],
occurred mainly within gp41 in progressors, while slow
progressors had a number of regions targeted. This

Page 10 of 12

suggests that the nature of antibody targets may differ
between the groups. Interestingly, both groups had positive selection in the a-2-helix within C3. It has been
suggested that, because the V4 loop is shorter in subtype C than in subtype B, the a-2 helix is more exposed
and more antigenic [49,53,54]. Interestingly, position
607 of gp41 was positively selected in progressors and
was also a signature sequence difference between progressors and slow-progressors, indicating that there may
be putative humoral immune pressure driving escape at
that position. Additionally, gp41 in progressors showed
differences at two putative antibody sites. Firstly, ELDKWAS was recognized by neutralizing antibody (nAb)
2F5, where DKW are the sentinel amino acids that
determine sensitivity to 2F5 [43]. This appears in the
majority of the slow progressors’s sequences; however, it
is substituted by DSW in all the progressors indicating a
loss of a putative antibody recognition site. In addition
there is a sequence change from Q at position 665 to K,
making the overall progressor sequence ALDSWKN.
Secondly, an N to S change at codon 671, which is
within a linear epitope- NWFNIT- that is recognized by
nAb 4E10, may result in a loss of this recognition site.
In addition, this codon was positively selected for in the
progressors. The effect of the loss of these putative
recognition sites during chronic disease progression is
unknown. We propose that the high antigenic stimulation in progressors may elicit antibodies whose antiviral
effectiveness may be limited. Together these results may
imply that the virus uses multiple strategies to evade the
immune system, including increased V1-V4 amino acid
length, increased numbers of PNGs, and specific mutations resulting in the virus gaining selective advantages.
Essentially, the cat and mouse game that persists during
chronic infection as a result of the dichotomy between
antigenic stimulation and immunological response,
which impacts and influences viral characteristics, needs
further investigation.
The limitations of the study are that firstly, we do not
know the exact time of infection for these subjects.
Therefore stratification of study subjects as progressors
or slow progressors relied on short-term (19.5 months)
follow-up immunological data, which may be an unrepresentative snap-shot of the entire natural history of
disease progression for these participants. However, this
concern was somewhat allayed by bioinformatic analysis
of the study sequences that showed that consistent with
the stratification, progressors in this cohort were more
likely to have been infected for shorter period of time
than slow progressors. Second, the sample size of the
study cohort was relatively small, which may have limited our statistical power to identify differences. Third,
we had a limited number of SGA-generated amplicons
for one of the study participants in particular, due to

Archary et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:92
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/92

their low viral load and sample volume limitation. In
addition, many more env amplicons were generated
than were included in the final analyses as some of the
amplicons had sequences with stop codons. Fourth,
although the slow progressors and progressors differed
in markers of disease progression at study exit, more
stringent selection criteria could potentially identify
additional significant differences. Overall, therefore, the
findings reported here will require duplication in larger
cohorts with longer periods of follow-up and more significant differences in immunological and virological
outcomes.

Conclusions
The dynamics of HIV-1 env evolution between chronic
slow progressors and progressors are distinct. Single
genome sequence analysis of circulating viruses in slow
progressors and progressors indicate that diversity, Env
length polymorphisms, sites under positive selection
pressure, and PNGs consistently map to specific regions
in slow progressors or progressors. Varied diversity
across the env genome, the relationship between amino
acid length, number of PNGs or sites under positive
selection may provide further insight to the intrinsic differences between the viruses from both groups and the
influence of the host’s selective pressures which may be
used to inform more effective vaccine design.
