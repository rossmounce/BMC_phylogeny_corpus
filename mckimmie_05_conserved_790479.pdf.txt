Abstract
Background: Sox domain containing genes are important metazoan transcriptional regulators
implicated in a wide rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the
Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show
that Drosophila Group B genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in
early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued
with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the Group B
family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, an important step in using Drosophila to
examine conserved aspects of Group B Sox gene function.
Results: We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publiclyavailable genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of Group B Sox domain genes in
Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the
insect genomes contain four genes encoding Group B proteins, two of which are intronless, as is
the case with vertebrate group B genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for Group
B genes, two of the insect group B genes, Sox21a and Sox21b, contain introns within their DNAbinding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox21b gene is
common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the group B Sox genes are organised in a
linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression
of each of the four group B genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura.
Conclusion: The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the group B genes
have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the
Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two Group B1 genes, SoxN and
Dichaete, and two Group B2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two Group
B genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis
suggests a simple model for the evolution of group B Sox genes in insects that differs from the
proposed evolution of vertebrate Group B genes.

Background
The family of Sox-domain containing proteins encompass
a group of metazoan transcriptional regulators first identified by their similarity with the mammalian testis-determining factor SRY. Membership of the Sox family is
conferred by the presence of an HMG1-type DNA-binding
domain sharing greater than 60% amino-acid sequence
identity to that of SRY [1]. Mammalian genome sequencing projects indicate that in humans and mice there are
twenty Sox genes [2], divided into eight subgroups (A-H)
on the basis of sequence identity within and outwith the
HMG-domain. Aside from mammals, Sox genes have been
identified in all metazoans examined to date, including
birds, fish amphibians, basal chordates, insects and nematodes [3].
The B subgroup is of particular interest since members of
this group are most closely related to SRY and appear to
be functionally conserved during evolution. Sequence
analysis and functional studies suggest that, in vertebrates,
the five members of the B subgroup can be subdivided
into two further groups; B1; Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3; [4] and
B2; Sox14 and Sox21; [5]. It has been suggested from studies in the chick that the three group B1 proteins act as gene
activators whereas the B2 proteins act as gene repressors
[6]. In terms of genomic organization, all five of the group
B genes are devoid of introns. Sox3 is located on the mammalian X chromosome and is believed to be the ancestor
of Sry [7,8]. In humans, the remaining four autosomal
group B genes are arranged in two pairs, each comprising
one B1 gene and one B2 gene: Sox2 and Sox14 map
together on chromosome 3 [9,10] and Sox1 and Sox21
map together on chromosome 13 [5,11]. This organization is conserved, at least in part, in other vertebrates with
Sox2-Sox14 mapping together in the chick and the
monotreme, O. anatinus, and Sox1-Sox21 mapping
together in the chick [12,13]. There is, however, no linkage of Group B Sox genes in the mouse genome [14,15]. A
model suggesting the evolution of group B genes and Sry
from a single ancestor has been proposed, which suggests
that pairs of B1 and B2 genes arose by a tandem duplication and then a chromosomal duplication [13].
The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, has proved to be a
tractable system for studying conserved aspects of eukaryotic gene function and, with the production of other
insect genome sequences, a useful baseline for evolutionary studies of gene organisation [16]. Whole-genome
sequence is now available for three insects, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura (which diverged from
melanogaster some 46 million years ago) and Anopheles
gambiae, which diverged from melanogaster approximately
250 million years ago [17,18]. Sequencing and assembly
of a further ten Drosophila species is currently underway
[19] promising an unparalleled data source for evolution-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/26

ary studies. In addition to the diptera, the sequencing of
the Hymenoptera, Apis mellifera (honey bee ~280 million
years from Drosophila), is now well underway, allowing
fragments of a fourth insect genome to be assessed. In
functional terms, Drosophila is a useful model for studying
SOX gene function due to its genetic tractability. For
example, we have previously shown that, in the case of the
Drosophila group B gene Dichaete, there is functional conservation between insect and mammalian genes [20]. In
addition, we, and others, have demonstrated a degree of
in vivo functional redundancy between Dichaete and SoxN
[21,22] as had been proposed for the mammalian group
B genes [23]. Of particular interest is the fact that the
expression patterns and functional studies of group B
genes suggest that they participate in the earliest events of
CNS differentiation in all organisms that have been studied to date including Drosophila, Xenopus, chick, mouse,
ascidians and hemichordates [24].
To further explore the relationship between group B Sox
genes we examined the extent and organization of the
family in insects. Our studies show that group B Sox gene
organisation is similar in four different insects. We find
conservation in the sequence and genome organization of
the group B genes in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, A.
gambiae and A. melifora. In contrast to mammals and in
agreement with a previous report [25], we find that two
group B2 genes contain introns and are organized as a single genomic cluster along with the intronless Dichaete
gene. Our studies indicate a potentially different evolutionary path for members of the group B family in insects
and vertebrates.

Results
To explore the structure of the group B Sox genes in insects
we first accurately determined the extent and structure of
the family in Drosophila melanogaster. The group B genes,
Dichaete and SoxNeuro (SoxN) have already been well
described in the literature [26-28]. Two other group B
gene fragments have been identified [25], Sox21a and
Sox21b, but their structure and genomic organisation have
not been reported. Using a combination of database
searching and DNA sequencing we characterised both of
these genes in detail. We find no evidence for any other
group B genes in Release 3.2 or Release 4 of the Drosophila
genome sequence, indicating that there are a total of four
in the D. melanogaster genome.
Sox21a
Blast searches of the Drosophila genome identified a group
B HMG-domain interrupted by a 1655-bp intron in the
70D region of chromosome arm 3L. Using primers
designed against each of these predicted exons we amplified a fragment of 1238 bp from the LD cDNA library produced by the BDGP [29]. For reasons that are as yet

unclear, we have been unable to recover a clone from this
or any of the several other cDNA libraries that we have
screened. The fragment amplified from the library was
sequenced in its entirety and found to contain a long open
reading frame encoding a 389 amino acid Sox domain
protein. The predicted polypeptide initiates with a
methionine and probably contains the entire coding
sequence for the gene. When aligned with the genome
sequence we predict a gene with two exons spanning 2.8
kb. Blast searches with the predicted protein find over
90% identity with a range of group B Sox proteins in the
HMG DNA-binding domain. The best scores are with the
DNA-binding domains of the vertebrate Sox21 and Sox14
proteins; however, there is little significant similarity outside of the DNA-binding domain. The Sox21a gene has
previously been reported as SoxB2-3 (CG7345) and it has
been suggested that it may represent a pseudogene [25].
As we show below, RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation studies indicate that Sox21a is expressed in both D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura indicating that it is not a
pseudogene.
Sox21b
Along with Sox21a, Blast searches indicated a second
interrupted Sox domain in the same region of the
genome. In this case, database searches found a potential
cDNA clone from the BDGP (GH07353), which was
obtained and sequenced in its entirety. The sequence of
the clone revealed a long open reading frame, initiating
with a methionine, encoding a predicted polypeptide of
571 amino acids. Alignment with the genome sequence
indicates that the gene spans 19 kb of genomic DNA and
is composed of 7 exons, the first of which is non-coding.
The DNA-binding domain contains two introns; the first,
6388 bp in size, is in the middle of the DNA-binding
domain and the second, of 59 bp, is in the same position
and frame as the Sox21a intron described above. Blast
searches with the predicted amino acid sequence find
greater than 90% amino acid identity the DNA-binding
domains of group B Sox proteins, the highest scores being
with Dichaete. The sequence indicates that Sox21b corresponds to the SoxB2-2 gene fragment previously reported
[25] and whole mount in situ hybridisation with probes
derived from genomic DNA and the cDNA clone confirm
the pattern of expression previously reported (Figure 2).
Thus, both Sox21a and Sox21b are expressed group B Sox
genes that have their DNA binding domains interrupted
by introns.

To verify the gene predictions and gain some insight into
their possible biological functions we determined the
developmental expression of each of the four group B
genes by RT-PCR using RNA templates isolated from different stages of the Drosophila lifecycle. In the case of
Sox21a and Sox21b, we used primers to the Sox-domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/26

encoding exons spanning a predicted intron. All RT-PCR
reactions included a reverse transcriptase minus reaction
and the amplified products were verified by sequencing.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 1 and
can be summarised as follows: the expression profiles of
Dichaete and SoxN are very similar, they are expressed during embryonic, larval and pupal stages of development,
the level of expression reducing during the later stages of
pupal development. Both genes are expressed in adult
male as well as female flies, with bodies showing stronger
expression than heads. Sox21a is expressed throughout
development and in adults it is stronger in heads than in
bodies. In contrast to the other group B genes, Sox21b has
a more complex expression pattern during development.
It is strongly expressed in embryos but is below detectable
levels for much of larval and pupal life. After eclosion it is
weakly expressed in male heads but not bodies. Thus, in
common with mammalian group B genes, all four D. melanogaster group B Sox are expressed during embryogenesis
and at other stages throughout development.
Group B genes in other insects
Our findings show that Drosophila melanogaster has four
group B Sox genes compared to the five found in vertebrates and, unlike vertebrates, two of the genes contain
introns. To investigate whether this particular organization is unique to D. melanogaster we searched the available
genome sequence of other insects to find potential Sox
domain genes. Using the Dichaete DNA-binding domain
as a query, we searched the Drosophila pseudoobscura,
Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifera genome and EST
sequence databases using Blast-P and Blast-N (see materials and methods for EST and genome scaffold accessions).
In all three cases we found evidence for four Group B
genes and were able to build gene models, from the
genome sequence alone or with the addition of EST data
where available. The initial characterization of the insect
group B genes, based on the HMG-domain sequence, suggests that there is a single orthologue of each Drosophila
gene in the other three species.
SoxN
The alignment presented in Figure 1a. shows the similarity
between the insect SoxN proteins and mouse Sox1. As previously reported, conservation between vertebrate and
invertebrate Sox proteins is mostly restricted to the DNAbinding domains [26,27]. Between the insect proteins
there are more extensive regions of homology outwith the
DNA-binding domain. The Drosophila SoxN sequences
show over 90% sequence identity over their entire length
and, as expected from the phylogenies based on rDNA
and protein coding sequences, the other insect sequences
are more diverged [18,30]. A. gambiae is overall 64% identical to the melanogaster sequence with particularly well
conserved regions in the N-terminal 50 amino acids and

more patchy conservation C-terminal to the DNA-binding
domain. A. mellifera is further diverged (52% identity with
Drosophila). Conserved regions outside the DNA-binding
domains among all four sequences are restricted to a
stretch of amino acids C-terminal that may represent conserved functional motifs important in transcriptional
regulation.
Dichaete
The situation with Dichaete is similar to that observed
with SoxN, and the figures for amino acid identity are virtually identical (Figure 1b). Outside of the DNA-binding
domain the Dichaete sequences show even less similarity
comparing the Drosophila species and the other two
insects; conservation between all four being restricted to
limited regions C-terminal to the DNA-binding domain.
Interestingly, we have shown that the C-terminal region of
D. melanogaster Dichaete contains sequences required for
activity in a context-specific manner [20] and C-terminal
regions of the mouse and chicken Sox2 protein are
believed to be involved in aspects of correct Sox2 function
[31].
Sox21a
This gene is the least conserved between the four species
and outside of the DNA-binding domain they show little
similarity with vertebrate group B2 proteins (Figure 1c).
There is extensive homology between the two Drosophila
species, however, the Anopheles and Apis sequences are
very diverged outside of the DNA binding domain. As
with D. melanogaster, there are no EST sequences available
that support the structure of Sox21a in the other insects.

Sox21b
The predicted Drosophila Sox21b proteins are again very
similar, over 88% identical over their length. The other
insect sequences are less well conserved, although the
Anopheles sequence has a block of conservation C-terminal to the DNA-binding domain, including a Glutamic
acid-rich domain (Figure 1d). The predicted Apis sequence
is less well conserved, we note, however, that all four proteins are identical at the extreme C-terminus. With both
the Anopheles and Apis proteins we cannot confidently predict the N-terminal exons and are unable to find any
regions with amino acid similarity to the first 2 coding
exons of the Drosophila sequences in the Anopheles or Apis
genomic sequence between the end of Dichaete and the
Sox21b Sox-domain encoding exons. Our current models
are, however, supported by the available EST sequences
for both species although the EST sequences are not fulllength. Therefore, the definitive structure of these two
insect Sox21b genes will require further investigation. Nevertheless, it is clear from the available sequence that
orthologues of Sox21b are present in other insects.

To confirm the identification of four group B genes in
both D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, we performed
whole-mount in situ hybridization to embryos of both
species using exon-specific probes generated by PCR from
genomic DNA. In all four cases we find very similar patterns of expression during embryogenesis. In the case of
Dichaete, we find blastoderm expression including a
broad central domain and a region of expression in the
cephalic neuroectoderm (Figure 2A and 2A'). After gastrulation there is extensive expression in the developing CNS
(Figure 2B and 2B') including the midline (not shown).
With SoxN we find conserved blastoderm expression,
including an identical restriction from the ventral region
of the embryo, followed by extensive expression throughout the developing CNS (Figure 2C to 2D'). With Sox21a,
we identified conserved expression in the anlage of the
foregut and hindgut at stage 12 (Figure 2E and 2E') with
later expression in specific cells of the midline after stage
14 (Figure 2F and 2F'). Sox21b shows conserved expression in abdominal epidermal stripes from stage 13 (Figure
2G to 2H'). These observations indicate that all four group
B genes have conserved expression patterns during
embryogenesis.
Genomic organisation of group B genes in Drosophila: the Dichaete
complex
In some vertebrates the two classes of group B genes, B1
and B2, are linked on the same chromosome. In contrast,
with Drosophila a single gene, SoxN, maps to the second
chromosome and the remaining three all map to chromosome 3. We examined the organisation of the group B
genes in the other insect genomes and found that the situation was very similar to that observed in Drosophila. In
melanogaster, SoxN is intronless and sits alone in the middle of an 80 Kb island with no flanking genes for 35 Kb
proximal and 45 Kb distal, an unusual organisation for a

Drosophila gene. We have previously shown that Dichaete
is controlled by extensive 3' regulatory sequences, suggesting that perhaps the paucity of genes flanking SoxN may
also indicate the presence of extensive regulatory
sequences. In support of this, we find several clusters of
predicted transcription factor binding sites from 35 kb
upstream to 20 kb downstream of SoxN when we use a
stringent search criteria with CisAnalyst analysis software
[32,33] (data not shown). Similar searches with Dichaete
find previously identified regulatory sequences, suggesting that SoxN may indeed be subject to complex regulation. Comparative analysis of the melanogaster and
pseudoobscura genomes with the Vista genome alignment
viewer [34,35] indicates that the genomic organization is
very similar in the two species. The Ensemble annotation
of the Anophelese genome indicates that the region around
SoxN is also sparsely populated, with only 2 short
stretches of EST homology in the 150 kb flanking SoxN.
Therefore, it is possible that SoxN is subject to complex
regulatory control in Anopheles. There is currently insufficient contiguous genomic sequence from Apis to assess the
organization of the SoxN region.
In the 70D region of Drosophila melanogaster chromosome
arm 3L the remaining three group B genes are clustered
within an 77 kb region (Fig 3). As we have previously
reported, Dichaete is an intronless gene controlled by at
least 30 Kb of regulatory sequence 3' to the transcription
unit [36]. 16 kb further distal to these regulatory
sequences we find the start of Sox21b and a further 28 kb
distal to this the start of Sox21a. The region ends with the
Fat Body Protein 1 (Fbp1) gene 6 kb downstream of Sox21a.
The genomic organization of Sox21b is highly unusual for
a group B Sox gene. It is split into seven exons, the first of
which is non-coding and exons 3, 4 and 5 contain the
DNA-binding domain. All of the predicted splice

junctions have consensus GT-AG sequences. Sox21a, comprises 2 exons, each containing a portion of the DNAbinding domain. As we note above, the position of the
intron, which has consensus splice junction sequences, is
in the same position as the second DNA-binding domain
intron of Sox21b (intron 4).
In the case of D. pseudoobscura, the homology extends
from upstream of the Dichaete coding region to at least the
Fat body protein 1 gene downstream of Sox21a. The organization of the three Sox genes is virtually identical comparing the two species and we could construct gene models
including all of the Sox21a and Sox21b exons. There is

absolute conservation of the intron position between
both Drosophila species, furthermore, the sizes of the
introns is also similar, although nucleotide similarity is
lower than in coding sequences ranging from 40 – 75%.
As with melanogaster, we find no evidence for additional
genes in the intergenic region between Dichaete and
Sox21b. We used the OWEN sequence alignment programme to plot the conservation between the Dichaete –
Sox21b intergenic region in both species (Figure 4).
Throughout the entire region we see that there is a high
degree of sequence conservation, since we know that at
least 30 kb of this region contains essential Dichaete regulatory sequences in melanogaster, we predict that

suggestion supported by the in situ hybridization data presented above (Figure 2).

The organization of the Dichaete region in the Anopheles
genome is very similar to that in the Drosophila species
with three genes found in a 190 kb region of chromosome

arm 3L. Dichaete is intronless and Sox21b is located
approximately 110 kb downstream of this. There are no
other predicted genes in the region. The Sox21b has a similar structure to those of the Drosophilids, however, it is not
identical. We have been unable to find a 5' non-coding
exon and, as we note above, the second intron found in
the DNA-binding domains of the Drosophila Sox21b genes
is absent in Anopheles with exons 4 and 5 fused. The other
introns are, however, conserved in position (figure 1d).
With the Anopheles Sox21a gene, the single intron position
is conserved with the Drosophila species, however, the
intron is considerably larger and contains an insertion of
a Q-class retrotransposon in the sequenced strain [37]. We
find no evidence for an Fbp1 orthologue in the vicinity,
the nearest similar sequence being some 5 Mb away on
the same chromosome arm.
The available sequence in the region is more fragmentary
in the case of Apis. Here we find an intronless Dichaete
gene and can define two sets of exons corresponding to
the split DNA binding domains of Sox21a and Sox21b.
Overall, the organization is similar to the other insects;
like Anopheles, the intergenic region between Dichaete and
Sox21b is large (~90 kb), however, unlike the other insects
the distance between Sox21b and Sox21a is also large (~80
kb). In the case of Sox21b we have used EST sequence to
support the gene model we have derived. The EST confirms the first four exons and we predict the terminal exon
on the basis of homology with the other species, particularly the terminal 30 amino acids. As with Anopheles, the
Apis Sox21b gene has a single DNA-binding domain intron
in the same position of the first Drosophila DNA-binding
domain intron. The intron immediately downstream of
the DNA-binding domain is also conserved in all four
insects, however, the remaining two intron positions differ between Apis and the other insects. Although the Apis
assembly is preliminary in this region, with several gaps
still present in the sequence, the fact that the gene models
are very similar to the other insects and that Dichaete and
Sox21b predictions are supported by EST data suggests that
the gene models we propose are likely to be accurate for
the majority of the coding sequence.
We compared the Dichaete to Sox21b intergenic regions of
Anopheles and Apis to the melanogaster sequence with the
OWEN alignment tool and failed to detect any significant
stretches of similarity, even at relatively low stringency.
This suggests that if there is conservation in gene regulatory sequences between these diverged insects it may be
difficult to detect or have undergone extensive
rearrangement.
Evolutionary perspective on insect group B genes
To attempt a classification of the insect group B Sox genes,
we performed a multiple sequence alignment with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/26

DNA-binding domains of the predicted proteins along
with representative group B-like sequences from other
organisms (Figure 5). The aligned ClustalX output suggests that the insect Sox domains may be subdivided into
3 classes. The first clearly groups the SoxN proteins from
each of the insects with the mammalian Sox1, 2 and 3
proteins. Along with these we find representative
sequences from nematodes (C. elegans, S. ratti, and W.
bancrofti), hemichordate Acorn worms (S. kowalevski and
P. flava) and the sea squirt (H. roretzi). Thus, together
these are likely to represent a single class, orthologous to
vertebrate group B1 proteins. The second class, the Sox21a
proteins, have sequences similar to the mammalian group
B2 proteins, Sox14 and 21 and may represent an insect
group B2 protein. The third class, containing Dichaete and
Sox21b, are clearly differentiated from all other group B
proteins by the presence of a Leucine/Isoleucine residue at
position 18, an Isoleucine residue at position 23 and a
divergent set of C-terminal amino acids. These two insect
proteins may represent an insect-specific group B family.
This suggests that a single group B1 protein, represented
by SoxN-Sox3 like sequences, was present in a common
ancestor before the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates. Similarly, the close association of the insect Sox21a
proteins with nematode and vertebrate Sox14 proteins
suggests that these were also present in a common ancestor. The alignments clearly highlight the distinction
between the Dichaete-Sox21b pair and other group B proteins, emphasizing a distinct evolutionary history for
these proteins in the insects.
Taken together, the analysis presented here shows that the
genomic organization and sequence of group B Sox genes
have been conserved during insect evolution. Particularly
striking is the clustering of three genes in a small region of
the genome. The structure of these genes and their relationship with vertebrate Group B genes suggest that SoxN
and Sox21a are homologous to vertebrate group B1 and
B2 genes respectively, whereas Dichaete and Sox21b may
represent insect-specific group B genes.

Discussion
The sequence alignments of the HMG DNA-binding
domains from insect and mammalian group B Sox proteins suggests that the insect proteins may be separated
into three distinct groups. The first, containing SoxN,
aligns with the vertebrate Sox1, 2 and 3 proteins and most
likely represents an orthologue of the vertebrate group B1
class. This conclusion, based on sequence, is supported by
the functional analysis of group B1 proteins in vertebrates
and Drosophila. In both cases, group B1 genes are
expressed from the earliest stages of CNS development
and are implicated in regulating early neural specification
[21,22,38,39]. In addition, we have evidence that mammalian Sox1 genes can rescue SoxN phenotypes in the Dro-

sophila CNS, supporting the view that these proteins are
functionally conserved (P. Overton and S.R. unpublished
observations). The group B sequences isolated from the

basal chordates, acorn worm and sea squirt, have also
been shown to be expressed early in the specification of
the CNS [40,41]. Thus, it appears that all metazoans

studied to date have at least one group B gene with expression marking neural lineages early in development. Further studies of primitive invertebrates will determine
whether group B Sox expression is a universal marker for
CNS development.
In a previously published phylogenetic studies it was suggested that Dichaete be classified as a Group B2 protein
[3]. However, while the analysis clearly differentiates
between the group B proteins and other fly Sox proteins it
could not unambiguously resolve the relationship
between each of the group B proteins. In terms of function
and expression, the Dichaete gene behaves very much like
a group B1 gene, it is expressed early during CNS development and is required for neural differentiation [20,42].
We have previously shown that the mouse Sox2 gene efficiently rescues Dichaete phenotypes, further supporting a
functionally similarity between Dichaete and vertebrate
group B1 genes [20,42]. In contrast to the conclusion
based on functional studies, the sequence analysis suggests that insect Dichaete DNA-binding domain
sequences are markedly different from other group B1
proteins and are more similar to group B2 proteins. The
conservation of the insect sequences indicates that a
Dichaete-like sequence was present at least 300 My years
ago, when Apis and the Diptera last shared a common
ancestor [18]. We believe that the functional evidence is
more convincing than the arguments based on sequence
alignments and therefore suggest that Dichaete represents
a group B1 function that has diverged from the canonical
group B1 sequence, presumably due to selection for
insect-specific functions. For example, Dichaete is
required for early segmentation in the Drosophila embryo,
a highly derived function, and it may be that sequence
changes in the HMG-domain have been selected for such
a function while still allowing a role in CNS-specification.
As with Drosophila, both Anopheles and Apis are long germ
insects that share some aspects of early development such
as the early appearance of striped domains of even skipped
expression [43,44]. Thus it is possible that insect Dichaete
genes have a common role in early patterning events. It
will be of considerable interest to examine the complement of group B Sox genes in Coleoptera, Homoptera or
Orthoptera to see if the HMG domain sequence and gene
organisation is the same as the insects so far sequenced.
To investigate this we used the Dichaete DNA-binding
domain to search the available sequence of the silk moth
Bombyx mori. [45] and found a single Group B gene that
was clearly an orthologue of the Dichaete genes discussed
here, containing the diagnostic Leucine and Isoleucine
residues described here.
As with vertebrate group B1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete are
expressed in broadly overlapping domains and act
partially redundantly in CNS specification [21,22]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/26

close similarity between the expression and function of
SoxN and Dichaete in the CNS raises the possibility that
they arose from a common ancestor by a duplication
event and may thus share some common regulatory
sequences. However, when we compared the sequences 5'
or 3' to SoxN with the Dichaete 3' sequence we could not
detect any sequence similarity indicating that any conservation in regulatory sequences is not visible at a large
scale; this is not entirely surprising since we cannot detect
any sequence similarity between the Dichaete regulatory
sequences from Drosophila and Anopheles, while our analysis indicates the divergence of SoxN and Dichaete predates the Drosophila-Anopheles divergence.
Based on the sequence alignment of insect Sox21a DNAbinding domains with those of vertebrate Sox14 proteins,
it is possible that Sox21a may be an orthologue of the
group B2 class. It has been suggested that in chicken
Sox14 and Sox21 act as antagonists of group B1 function
in a subset of the developing CNS [6]. The function of
Sox21a in Drosophila is not known at present, however,
Sox21a is expressed late in the development of the embryonic CNS midline, a site of SoxN and Dichaete expression,
indicating there is the potential for the type of antagonistic interaction proposed for vertebrates. The Sox21b DNAbinding domain sequence indicates that it is closely
related to Dichaete. Both these proteins have a set of
unique residues in their DNA-binding domains that are
not found in any other group B proteins identified to date.
The Sox21b gene is conserved between the insects and its
close similarity to Dichaete suggests that both genes arose
from a common origin in the ancestor of the arthropods
after their divergence from the nematodes since there is no
close sequence in C. elegans or its relatives. In terms of
expression, Sox21b is expressed in the large hindgut along
with Dichaete, supporting the possibility that it may also
antagonise the activity of Dichaete. In this respect then
Sox21b may represent a group B2 function. It is therefore
possible that insects contain 2 group B1 class activities,
involved in early CNS development, and two B2 class
genes. Again we emphasise that the functional assignment
of the insect genes may contrast with the data derived
from sequence analysis, which predicts a single group B1
gene and three group B2 genes. We suggest that the separation of group B Sox domains into a B1 class and B2 class
based solely on sequence does not reflect meaningful
functional differences in insects. We have initiated a functional analysis of Sox21a and Sox21b in the hope that we
can clarify this issue.
The genome organisation of the Dichaete cluster is unusual, not only are three genes clustered together in the
genome but two of them, Sox21a and Sox21b, have introns
within the HMG-domain. The single Sox21a intron is conserved in all four of the insect genes suggesting that it is

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genetics 2005, 6:26

ancestral to the insects. Sox21b is more complex, there are
six introns in melanogaster and pseudoobscura, four of these
are conserved in Anopheles and two are conserved in Apis.
In the Drosophila species, there are two introns in the
DNA-binding domain, the first of which is present in all
four insects. The second intron, in an identical location to
the Sox21a intron, is only found in the two Drosophila species. A simple model of a single intron loss is therefore
unlikely to account for this since both Apis and Anopheles
do not have the intron. It is possible that Apis and Anophelese lost the intron independently or, alternatively, that
the common ancestor of the Drosophila species gained the
intron, perhaps via a gene conversion event with Sox21a.
Interestingly, the two group B genes from C. elegans also
contain introns in the DNA-binding domain, in identical
positions in both genes, but they are in different positions
to the Sox21a and Sox21b introns. This suggests that the
common ancestor of insects and nematodes did not contain DNA-binding domain introns and that these have
been acquired independently in both lineages.
The conservation of genome structure with the insect
Dichaete cluster suggests that there may be functional constraints on the organisation. We suggest that this is likely
to be a reflection of shared regulatory sequence since the
region between Dichaete and Sox21b in melanogaster contains extensive regulatory sequences essential for correct
Dichaete expression. We note that both Sox21a and Sox21b
have expression domains that overlap with Dichaete, in
the midline for Sox21a and the hindgut with Sox21b.
These expression domains may therefore be controlled by
common regulatory sequences and the need to maintain
coordinated regulation of the three genes has maintained
the integrity of the cluster in the insects. The conservation
in expression between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura is consistent with this view; it will be of interests to
examine the expression of the all of the Sox genes in
Anopheles to further explore this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Taking our observation together, we propose a simple
model for the evolution of group B SOX genes (Figure 6).
We base our model on the proposal of Kirby et. al. [13]
who suggest that a single group B gene underwent a duplication to generate two Sox3- like genes. We propose that
these are represented by SoxN and Dichaete in the insects.
A further tandem duplication of one of these genes generated linked group B1 and group B2 genes. We propose
that this is represented by Dichaete duplicating to generate
Sox21a. Sox21a would then acquire the sequence changes
characteristic of the group B2 class of proteins. We suggest
that these events predate the Protostome-Deuterostome
divergence over 650 My ago [46] and provide the basal
Sox gene complement of the Bilateria of three group B Sox
genes. After the divergence of the lineages leading to ver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/26

tebrates and invertebrates, Dichaete diverged from the
canonical group B DNA-binding domain sequence and
then underwent further duplication event, at least predating the divergence of the holometabolous insects, to generate Sox21b. An analysis of the group B family in other
insects and basal chordates will be required to definitively
describe the ancestral situation.

Methods
Genome sequences
The following sources were used to obtain genome
sequence: D. melanogaster (Release 3.2, [47,48]) from FlyBase [49] and the following scaffolds were used;
AE003535 for the Dichaete region and AE003622 for the
SoxN region. D. pseudoobscura (Freeze_1 assembly) was
obtained from the Human Genome Sequencing Center,
Baylor College of Medicine (HGSC-BCM [50]) and the
following scaffolds used; Contig5946_Contig6670 for the
Dichaete region and Contig1741_Contig5707 for the
SoxN region. Anopheles gambiae genome sequence release
19.2a.1, compiled by the International Anopheles Genome
Project [51], was obtained from the Ensembl server at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [52]. In the Ensemble
annotation the Sox genes have the following accessions:
SoxN
(ENSANGG00000019842),
Dichaete
(ENSANGG00000010137),
Sox21a
(ENSANGG00000010002)
and
Sox21b
(ENSANGG00000009947). Anopheles EST sequences representing Dichaete (TC44994) and Sox21b (TC45155)
were obtained from The Institute for Genome Research
[53]. Apis mellifera Genome assembly Amel_1.1 was
obtained from HGSC-BCM [54] and the following scaffolds used: for the Dichaete region, Group8.12 (Dichaete
and Sox21b) was found to overlap by 4.5 kb with GroupUn.570 containing Sox21a and the sequences were combined into a single contig. SoxN was contained within
Group17.6. In addition a search of the Honey Bee Brain
EST project [55,56] uncovered two EST sequences corresponding to Dichaete (BB170009A10D01) and Sox21b
(BB170011B20A11). These were used to verify the exon
predictions from the genome sequence. Vertebrate group
B sequences were obtained from Uniprot. Nematode
sequences were recovered by Blast searches of the EST collections at Nematode.net (Genome Sequencing Center,
Washington University, St Louis, [57]).
Informatics tools
Homology searching was performed using the Blast algorithm [58] at Sanger, HGSC-BCM and Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project [59] web sites. Genomic
sequences were imported into Artemis v5 [60,61] and
annotated manually using the Blast output as a guide.
Multiple Sequence alignments were performed locally
using ClustalXv1.8 [62] and graphically represented with
