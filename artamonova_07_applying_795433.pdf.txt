Abstract
Background: Unsupervised annotation of proteins by software pipelines suffers from very high
error rates. Spurious functional assignments are usually caused by unwarranted homology-based
transfer of information from existing database entries to the new target sequences. We have
previously demonstrated that data mining in large sequence annotation databanks can help identify
annotation items that are strongly associated with each other, and that exceptions from strong
positive association rules often point to potential annotation errors. Here we investigate the
applicability of negative association rule mining to revealing erroneously assigned annotation items.
Results: Almost all exceptions from strong negative association rules are connected to at least
one wrong attribute in the feature combination making up the rule. The fraction of annotation
features flagged by this approach as suspicious is strongly enriched in errors and constitutes about
0.6% of the whole body of the similarity-transferred annotation in the PEDANT genome database.
Positive rule mining does not identify two thirds of these errors. The approach based on exceptions
from negative rules is much more specific than positive rule mining, but its coverage is significantly
lower.
Conclusion: Mining of both negative and positive association rules is a potent tool for finding
significant trends in protein annotation and flagging doubtful features for further inspection.

Background
There are currently over six million amino acid sequences
known, and only a quarter of a million have been manually annotated [1]. Moreover, as estimated by [2], merely
for 3% of proteins functional annotation is based on
experimental evidence. Due to the advent of super-fast
and ultra-low-cost DNA sequencing technologies [3] the
speed of genome sequencing continues to increase, and
sequencing prices continue to plummet. Given the
quickly widening gap between the amount of molecular
data and the capacity of human experts there is little

doubt that electronic annotation by automated software
pipelines will be the only source of information about the
overwhelming majority of proteins.
In silico annotation generated by bioinformatics methods
has the advantage of being efficient and cheap, but at the
same time suffers from a notoriously high error level [4,5].
Most of these errors are caused by homology-based annotation transfer where available similarity is not sufficient
to warrant the transfer of information from the source to
the target sequence, or because the annotation of the

source sequence is already wrong. Further complications
include the presence of compositionally biased sequence
regions, mosaic domain structure of eukaryotic proteins,
wrong gene models, and difficulties in recognizing pseudogenes.
The most obvious and direct approach towards improving
the reliability and coverage of unsupervised protein annotation entails the development of better bioinformatics
tools. Remarkable algorithmic advances of the past decade include more accurate gene prediction techniques
(reviewed by [6]), highly sensitive sequence similarity
searches based on hidden Markov models [7], protein secondary structure prediction approaching the 80% accuracy barrier (e.g., [8]), novel tools for predicting protein
cellular localization [9], improved strategies for annotation transfer by homology (e.g., [10]), and enhanced protein function prediction by phylogenomics methods [2],
to name just a few. Automatic annotation efforts also significantly profit from highly curated and actively maintained information resources, such as sequence [1],
pathway [11] and interaction [12] databases, functional
and structural classifications of proteins [13-15], as well as
the collections of protein domains and motifs [16,17].
A complementary tactic to improve the quality of protein
sequence databases involves retrospective search for errors
in the total corpus of already available annotation. Under
this approach protein annotation is considered to be a
collection of records, one per each gene, containing a varying number of attributes, ranging from just a few minimal descriptors (length, pI) for hypothetical proteins, to
dozens of annotation items (motifs, EC numbers, localization, structural folds, etc) for better characterized proteins. Modern data mining techniques can be used to
identify statistically significant associations between individual attributes, and then to investigate exceptions from
such associations that can potentially point to erroneous
assignments.
In our earlier work we applied the formalism of association rule mining to extract associations between annotation items in large molecular sequence databases [18].
Considering a database with multiple entries, with each
entry ascribed a finite number of features, association
rules [19] are simple implications that can be formulated
in the form (A1 & ... & An) => Z, where A1 ... An (the lefthand side of the rule, LHS) and Z (right-hand side, RHS)
are different features, and the rule means "database entries
that possess all features A1 ... An are likely to possess feature Z". The rules of this type are thus positive because they
model a positive relation between two item sets. Each rule
is characterized by its coverage, the number of entries in
the database that possess all features A1 ... An, its support,
the number of entries satisfying both the left and the right

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/261

sides of the rule simultaneously, and its strength, which is
essentially the probability that a given database entry will
satisfy the right side of the rule given that it satisfies the
left side of the rule.
Our strategy for finding errors in annotation consisted of
finding rules with a strength very close, but not equal, to
1.0, which means that such rules have a minor number of
exceptions, and then identifying all proteins that constitute exceptions to these rules. Applied to the Swiss-Prot
[1] database, this approach yielded 7396, 4956, and 4046
rules with a strength greater than 0.95 and a coverage of
over 50 which were not fulfilled exactly once, twice, or
three times. In order to test whether exceptions from
strong rules actually correspond to annotation errors subsequent releases of the Swiss-Prot database were compared and additional manual verification was conducted.
It was indeed found that exceptions to strong rules get corrected substantially more often than the rest of the annotation. For unsupervised annotation automatically
generated by the PEDANT genome analysis system [20]
the total fraction of exceptions from strong rules classified
by manual analysis as errors was as high as 68%. It was
also found that most of the errors in the Swiss-Prot database are under-predictions (i.e. absence of features that
would be expected based on association rules), consistent
with the prudent manual annotation process adopted by
Swiss-Prot, while in PEDANT errors are typically caused
by over-predictions.
In this work we continue to explore the application of rule
mining to correcting annotation errors and investigate the
utility of negative association rule mining, which, as the
name implies, represents the identification of negative
relationships between item sets [19]. A negative association rule has the form A1 & ... & An (LHS) => not Z (RHS),
with A1 ... An and Z being different features, and the rule
means 'database entries that possess all features A1 ... An are
unlikely to possess feature Z'. For negative rules support is the
number of database entries satisfying both the LHS and
the RHS, i.e. those entries that possess all features A1 ... An
and do not possess the feature Z. An additional very
important parameter used in this work to characterize
negative rules is leverage which is defined as the difference
of the rule support and the product of supports of its LHS
and RHS. Leverage measures the unexpectedness of a rule
as the difference of the actual rule frequency and the probability of finding it by chance with the given frequencies
of its RHS and LHS.
A negative association rule is thus an implication from the
union of several items to an item negation. An example of
a trivial biologically relevant negative association rule is
"Nuclear localization => not bacterial origin", i.e. every
protein annotated as localized in the nucleus cannot have

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:261

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/261

a bacterial origin. As with positive rules, negative rules are
not necessarily absolutely strict. For instance, the rule
"Operon structure => not eukaryotic origin" has a number
of exceptions because bacterial-like operons were
described in Ceanorhabditis elegans [21]. Since these exceptions comprise only a small fraction of the annotated
genes, this rule may naturally be interpreted as "the
majority of genes constituting an operon structure do not
originate from eukaryotic organisms". In this specific case
exceptions from a strong rule are biologically motivated
and do not represent errors. However, in many other cases
such exceptions do point to erroneously assigned annotation items. For example, the rule "intracellular transport
vesicles => not bacteria" has four exceptions in the PEDANT annotation caused by erroneous homology-based
transfer of the functional category "intracellular transport
vesicles" to four bacterial gene products. We present a
large-scale evaluation of exceptions from strong negative
rules in the PEDANT genome database and assess their
utility for detecting and correcting annotation errors. To
our knowledge this is the first application of negative
association rule mining to molecular biological data.

This line describes the antitoxin of the ChpB-ChpS toxinantitoxin system from Escherichia coli as a protein that has
small length (length:S), acidic isoelectric point (Pi:C, less
than 5.5), gene with high GC-content, bacterial origin
(Bacteria), and low content of disordered regions (do:L),
does not possess any low complexity regions (lc:0), has
structural class of the 'alpha/beta' type and the PFAM [16]
domain PF04014. It belongs to the IPR007159 InterPro
[23] family and the b.129.1 SCOP [13] structural superfamily, and it is a homolog of the UniProt [1] proteins
annotated with the keyword "DNA-binding". According to
the MIPS Functional Catalog [15] (only two upper levels
are considered here) the function of this protein is
described by the labels fc16 (protein with binding function), fc16.03 (nucleic acid binding), fc40 (cell fate),
fc40.01 (cell growth/morphogenesis), fc32 (cell rescue,
defense and virulence) and fc32.05 (disease, virulence and
defense).

Methods

• Type 1. Features that are definitely known. This group
includes either inherent properties of genes and their
products, such as their taxonomic origin, or features that
can be unambiguously calculated from primary
sequences, such as GC content, length, pI value, percentage of low complexity regions, and so on.

Extracting item sets from the PEDANT genome database
PEDANT software suite [20] is an automatic annotation
pipeline that runs various bioinformatics analyses on each
protein sequence and stores the results, appropriately
parsed, in a relational database. The associated PEDANT
genome database [22] currently contains pre-computed
annotation for 468 genomes and a total of more than 1.76
million gene products. Most of these data were calculated
using the version 2 of the PEDANT software, but we are
currently deploying the all-new version 3 with substantially enhanced capabilities including a new graphical
user interface and an extended set of bioinformatics algorithms.

Here we used the following 10 model genomes freshly
processed using PEDANT3 (see http://pedant.gsf.de):
Helicobacter pylori, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Synechocystis sp., Parachlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Aeropyrum pernix,
Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis. The total of 55063
gene products were annotated with more than 1 million
(1265974) annotation features suitable for association
rule mining (see Table 1).
A typical annotation entry extracted from PEDANT for a
given gene product has the following form:
"length:S, Pi:C, GC:H, Bacteria, alpha/beta, do:L, b.129.1,
fc16.03, lc:0, fc16, fc40.01, PF04014, COG2336,
IPR007159, fc40, DNA-binding, fc32, fc32.05"

Annotation attributes extracted from PEDANT can generally be subdivided into three types in terms of their intrinsic susceptibility to errors.

• Type 2. Structural and functional properties of proteins
predicted directly from their amino acid sequences by ab
initio computational algorithms (secondary structure, disordered regions, coiled coils, transmembrane segments,
signal peptides, cellular localization).
• Type 3. Structural and functional properties of proteins
derived by similarity searches against previously characterized gene products. These features include sequence
domains, keywords, functional categories, enzyme
classes, and functional and structural superfamilies.
It is obvious that the features of type 1 are unfaultable and
cannot generally contain errors (except for incorrectly predicted gene models, typographical errors, or errors caused
by software bugs or human error). Features of type 2 are
typically predicted with the accuracy in the order of 70%
[24] by machine learning techniques, such as neural networks or support vector machines. If no experimental data
for a given feature type is available (e.g. known three
dimensional structure, experimentally determined cellular localization), such predictions can only rarely be further improved by human curation. Finally, features of
type 3 are transferred from one or several previously annotated gene products to the query protein based on a suffi-

ciently significant degree of similarity. These features
constitute the main bulk of protein-associated information available in the databases, and it is precisely this part
of protein annotation that is especially prone to errors due
to intrinsic limitations of annotation transfer by homology.
We are interested in applying negative association rule
mining for identifying errors in the annotation attributes
of Type 3 transferred by similarity from other proteins; in
the annotation entry above such features are shown in
italic. In our dataset there were the total of 848511 similarity-derived features (67% of all features analyzed),
more than a half of which were constituted by functional
category assignments.
Extracting rules from PEDANT annotation
The annotation set describing 55063 genes in ten PEDANT genomes served as input data to extract negative
association rules using a modified version of the wellestablished Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.
The basic Apriori algorithm, described in detail in [25], is
designed to find frequent item sets by consecutive expansion of candidate sets at every step. It is based on the simple notion that all subsets of a frequent item set are also
frequent. In this work we used a version of this algorithm
designed for the efficient negative association rule production [26] implemented and kindly provided by Christian
Borgelt (for initial software description see, e.g., [27]).

The application of the Apriori software to PEDANT annotation results in a file containing one negative rule per
line. Each line lists the LHS and the RHS as well as several
numerical characteristics of the rule delimited by commas. A typical rule line in the output file looks like this:
"fc34.11 & fc36, not length:S, 0.028, 1560, 0.895, 49286,
0.028, 1558, 0.999, 1.116, 0.003, 161.669"
This notation means that proteins possessing FunCat
labels 34.11 ("Cellular sensing and response") and 36
("Interaction with the environment (systemic)") are
unlikely to be of small (less than 120 amino acids) length.
The LHS items are joined by the "&" symbol and are followed by the RHS (here – a negation of the annotation
feature), and the list of numerical attributes of the rule:
coverage, coverage count, RHS coverage, RHS coverage
count, support, support count, strength, lift, leverage, and
leverage count. In addition to "Support count", "Coverage
count" and "Strength", important for positive association
rule selection [18] (1560, 1558 and 0.999, respectively, in
our example), the numerical parameter "Leverage" (or
"interest of the rule", as alternative name) is also very
important in the case of negative rules. All existing algorithms allow calculating negative association rules effec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/261

tively only using a certain threshold on the minimal
leverage or leverage count. Here, if not specified otherwise, all rules with the support and the leverage counts of
at least 100 proteins and strength of at least 0.1 were
retained for further analysis.
Analysis of taxon specificity
A considerable and arguably the most valuable part of
PEDANT annotation involves assignments of functional
categories based on the MIPS FunCat [15]. A large fraction
of negative association rules included a taxon-specific
FunCat label (e.g., fc75.03 – "animal tissue") on one side
of the implication and the taxon of protein origin contradicting this specificity (in the given case, Bacteria or
Archaea or Viruses for fc75.03) on the other. Among all
184 different FunCat labels (2 upper levels of the hierarchy) used in this study 71 were taxon-specific. For example, one of the taxon-specific rules found was:

"fc75.03 & fc34.11 & fc10.03 & fc20, not Bacteria, 0.006,
344, 0.647, 35620, 0.006, 342, 0.994, 1.537, 0.002,
119.467".
All rules of this kind are a direct consequence of the taxonspecific nature of the underlying (here fc75.03) FunCat
labels. Some of these rules may have exceptions due to
annotation transfer by homology between proteins from
different taxonomic groups. We classify such cases as
annotation errors according to the general procedure.
Manual verification of the rules
For manual verification of negative association rules we
randomly selected a limited sample of protein entries
from the PEDANT annotation set that constituted exceptions from rules and could not be corrected by the taxon
specific analysis explained in the previous section. Annotation features of these proteins occurring either in the
LHS or in the RHS of the rules were subjected to careful
manual analysis by an experienced protein annotator
according to the established procedures routinely used at
MIPS for genome annotation (see, e.g., [28]). These
include assessment of similarity hits and predicted protein features as well as in-depth examination of biological
literature describing experimental studies. An exception
was classified as an error if one of the features in the LHS
or RHS of the rule was found to be assigned wrongly to the
given protein entry. We then calculated the error rate
among all manually analyzed exceptions according to the
following formula:

(percentage of exceptions classified as annotation errors
among all manually verified exceptions * number of
exceptions in rules not involving 'taxon specificity' +
number of exceptions from 'taxon specific' rules)/overall
number of exceptions.

Results and discussion
Statistics of negative association rules in the PEDANT
annotation
Application of the Apriori algorithm to the annotation set
extracted from PEDANT resulted in 9591 negative rules
(see Additional file 1). For example, one of the most trivial rules found was "Bacteria, not Eukaryota, 0.353,
19443, 0.413, 22765, 0.353, 19443, 1.000, 2.419, 0.207,
11404.573". This rule is satisfied in all possible cases and
thus its strength is 1.0 with no exceptions. In total there
were 2273 such rules calculated. Much more interesting
rules in the context of this study are those of strength very
close, but not equal to 1.0. These rules have a small
number of exceptions that may constitute annotation
errors. There were 7318 such rules with 26969 exceptions
in total. An example of such rules is "Nuclear protein, not
Bacteria, 0.033, 1808, 0.647, 35620, 0.033, 1798, 0.994,
1.537, 0.011, 628.413". This statement which is obvious
from the biological point of view nevertheless does not
make an absolute rule; in fact out of all 1808 protein
entries annotated by the keyword "Nuclear protein" in the
PEDANT database only 1798 actually have eukaryotic origin. The ten proteins constituting exceptions from this
rule (for example, the oligoribonuclease from Mycobacterium tuberculesis, PEDANT code gi_15609648) simply
inherit this keyword from their eukaryotic homologs. In
our example, the homolog is human oligoribonuclease
(PEDANT
code
gi_116242694,
UniProt
code
ORN_HUMAN), one of the alternatively spliced isoforms
of which is localized to the nucleus.

Some aspects of negative rule statistics differ significantly
from positive association rules due to vastly different item
frequencies. Because annotation items themselves are

rare, and most items are in fact extremely rare (e.g., the
PFAM domain PF01029 is only found in 12 (0.02%) of
proteins analyzed), their negations used in negative association rule mining are unavoidably very frequent. This
simple circumstance makes the calculation of negative
rules computationally much more challenging compared
to positive rules and necessitates the application of much
stricter thresholds on the rules of interest. While analyzing
rule strength distribution we considered only the rules
exhibiting strength higher than 0.1. The number of
weaker rules (strength below 0.1) is too high due to the
combinatorial explosion caused by random feature combinations, making their analysis computationally prohibitive. However, even in the strength interval 0.1 – 1.0 the
number of negative rules is several orders of magnitude
higher that the number of positive rules. To make the task
computationally tractable we additionally imposed a
threshold on minimal leverage which effectively helps to
select only the most 'non-random' rules (see Methods)
and eliminates all rules with the strength below 0.97. The
distributions of negative rule strength with different minimal coverage counts are plotted in Figure 1.
The fraction of proteins in the PEDANT database constituting exceptions from strong rules in the strength interval
between 0.97 and 1.0 as well as the fraction of relevant
(homology-transferred) features participating in such
rules is very low. In total, we identified 6875 features
(0.8%) in the annotation of 1031 proteins (1.9%) as
potential annotation errors.

We filtered out wrongly assigned taxon-specific FunCat
labels and selected randomly a limited sample among all
remaining homology-transferred annotation features. The
accuracy of the feature assignment was thoroughly verified by an experienced annotator. All verified annotation
attributes were divided into 3 categories: true assignments, false assignments, or "not known". The latter category was selected if the evidence for a given assignment
was not sufficient to make a judgment, but the feature did
not obviously contradict the nature of the protein (e.g.,
the keyword "Zymogen" in the annotation of the lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase from Arabidopsis thaliana,
code "At5g65760"). Features of this category were
excluded from further analysis and were not taken into
account while estimating the error level. For example, if in
a set of 100 features selected for manual verification 40
features were classified as 'errors', 56 as 'correct assignments', and 4 as 'not known', then the final estimate of the
error level in this sample was 100*40/(100-4) = 42%.

Analysis of potentially erroneous annotation features
Taxon-specific rules
In order to estimate the number of actual annotation
errors among exceptions from strong rules the first test
was designed to exclude the influence of taxon specificity.
It turned out that a very large number of rules combined
FunCat labels on one side of the rule with the taxon of the
protein origin on the other side (we used here only the
highest-level taxons, namely Eukaryota, Bacteria, Archae,
and Viruses). There were 3159 rules (33% of all negative
rules) with such structure. Because many FunCat labels
are taxon-specific (see Methods), these labels should ideally only be present in the annotation of the genes belonging to the corresponding taxa; homology-based transfer of
such annotation attributes is highly prone to error. Where
a taxonomically specific FunCat label is incompatible
with the known gene taxon, it is the FunCat assignment
which is guaranteed to be erroneous, since the protein origin is doubtlessly known. This simple test resulted in
automatic correction of almost 50% of all exceptions in
our set of strong negative rules. Figure 2 shows how the
fraction of corrected exceptions among all exceptions
depends on the rule strength.
Performance of the method
After the filter for taxonomy-specific FunCat labels was
implemented, the set of 6432 rules formed all negative
rules for our annotation sample. These rules involved
4687 transferable features (0.6% of all features) in the
annotation of 822 proteins (1.5% of all proteins).

The specificity of the negative rules is thus much higher
than that in the case of positive rules [18] which was estimated to be around 68% based on careful manual verification. By design, exceptions from negative association
rules can only reveal over-annotation, i.e. erroneous
assignment of attributes to protein entries, while underannotation (missing attributes) cannot be detected. While
manually curated databases are typically under-annotated
and this approach is not efficient for them (the performance of the method was very low when tested on the
Swiss-Prot database, data not shown), over-annotation is
a typical problem of many automatic software pipelines,
including PEDANT, and the ability to correct this type of
errors using negative rule mining is valuable. At the same
time, the approach based on exceptions from strong negative rules yields much smaller coverage than positive rule
mining. As seen in Figure 3, negative rule mining allows
identifying 11 times fewer annotation features (0.6% for
negative rules versus 6.7% for positive rules) that participate in incompatible feature combinations. More than

Fraction of exceptions

To estimate the prevalence of errors among exceptions not
corrected by the taxonomy procedure described above we
selected randomly a sample of 100 rules and analyzed
their exceptions manually. In 96% of examined exceptions at least one of the features constituting the rule was
assigned wrongly to the given protein. The overall specificity of the approach was estimated to be as high as 98%:
practically all feature combinations associated with exceptions included at least one annotation error.

two thirds of these features do not get detected by positive

What fraction of the annotation features flagged by the negative
rules are actual annotation errors?
Our approach is designed to flag incompatible feature
combinations for subsequent manual inspection rather
than to automatically correct annotation errors in an
unsupervised fashion. With the exception of taxon-specific rules where FunCat labels incompatible with the taxonomic origin of a protein are guaranteed to be errors, we
do not know exactly which feature of a flagged feature
combination is wrong. Besides there always exists a
chance that all features constituting an exception from a
strong negative rule are nevertheless correctly assigned
and that the exception is in fact biologically motivated.

It would be desirable to validate our predictions against
high-quality manually curated databases such as SwissProt or BRENDA [29], but this, unfortunately cannot be
done at sufficiently large scale. As discussed above most of
the annotation errors found in PEDANT are over-predictions which can not easily be confirmed by comparison
with Swiss-Prot entries as the latter tend to be underannotated. If a certain feature is present in a Swiss-Prot
entry, it is almost certainly correct, however, if a feature is
absent no statement can generally be made. BRENDA
focuses on one aspect of protein annotation – EC numbers – providing detailed classification of enzymes at four
hierarchical levels. Correspondingly, there are only few
proteins associated with each four digit EC number while
association rule mining relies on frequent annotation
items. In this study rules were required to have coverage
count of at least 100, and only six EC numbers satisfied
this condition.
We therefore attempted to estimate the fraction of actual
annotation errors among those features flagged as suspicious and, for comparison, in non-flagged features by
careful manual inspection as described in Methods. As seen
in Table 2, features flagged as suspicious are almost 1.4
fold enriched in actual annotation errors than the
unmarked ones.

association rule mining include at least one wrongly
assigned annotation term. The fraction of individual features flagged as suspicious is about 0.6% from the total
number of features assigned by PEDANT and it is significantly enriched in annotation errors. Moreover, roughly
two thirds of such erroneous assignments are not identified by positive rule mining. We conclude that applying a
combination of positive rule mining described earlier [18]
and negative rule mining presented creates an opportunity to enhance the fidelity of genome annotation in two
alternative ways. First, insights about the sources of annotation errors gained in this investigation can be used to
adjust the automatic annotation pipeline in order to minimize generation of these errors in the future. Examples of
such possible modifications include taxon-specific homology-based transfer of functional categories and utilization of individualized similarity thresholds for various
features. Second, suspicious features can be visually
marked for subsequent inspection by the user. While this
approach is better suited for manually curated databases
where errors actually get corrected by human experts, it is
also useful for automatic systems such as PEDANT where
users get alerted to specific less trusted annotation items
that should be used with caution.
