Abstract
Background: Evc is essential for Indian Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in the cartilage growth plate. The gene encoding
Evc2 is in close proximity in divergent orientation to Evc and mutations in both human genes lead to the
chondrodysplasia Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.
Results: Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the Evc and Evc2 genes arose through a duplication event early in
metazoan evolution and were subsequently lost in arthropods and nematodes. Here we demonstrate that Evc2 is
essential for Hh pathway activation in response to the Smo agonist purmorphamine. A yeast two-hybrid screen
using Evc as bait identified Evc2 as an Evc binding partner and we confirmed the interaction by
immunoprecipitation. We developed anti-Evc2 antibodies and show that Evc2 and Evc co-localize at the basal
body and also on primary cilia. In transfected cells, basal body and cilia localization is observed when Evc and Evc2
constructs are co-transfected but not when either construct is transfected individually. We show that Evc and Evc2
are cilia transmembrane proteins, the C-terminus for both being intracellular and Evc2, but not Evc, having an
extracellular portion. Furthermore, Evc is absent at the basal body in Evc2 null cells. Using Western blots of
cytoplasmic and nuclear protein, we also demonstrate that full length Evc2 but not Evc, is located in the nucleus.
Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that Evc2 is a positive regulator of the Hh signalling pathway and
that it is located at the basal body of primary cilia. We show that the presence of Evc and Evc2 at the basal body
and cilia membrane is co-dependent. In addition, Evc2, but not Evc, is present in the cell nucleus suggesting
movement of Evc2 between the cilium and nucleus.

Background
EVC was first identified through a positional cloning
approach as the gene defective in patients with the
recessive disorder Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC) [1].
The consistent features of this condition are short ribs,
short limbs, postaxial polydactyly, dental abnormalities
and nail dysplasia. Failure to find EVC mutations in a
number of consanguineous EvC families mapping to the
same region of chromosome 4 led to investigation of
other genes in the EvC critical interval and to the identification of mutations in a second gene, EVC2, which is
in close proximity to EVC [2]. The two genes are in

divergent orientation with their translational start sites
separated by only 2.86 kb in the human genome [3] and
1.75 kb in the mouse [4]. The phenotype associated
with mutations in either of the two genes is indistinguishable indicating that EVC and EVC2 act in a common pathway [5,6].
Mice lacking Evc, like patients with Ellis-van Creveld
syndrome, have short limbs, short ribs and dental
abnormalities. On histological analysis of the growth
plate, they have epiphyseal shortening and defective
periosteal induction compatible with a defect in Indian
Hedgehog (Ihh) signalling. Studying expression of Ihh
and its downstream targets by in situ hybridization
demonstrated normal Ihh expression but diminished
mRNA levels of the Ihh downstream targets, Patched1
(Ptch1), Gli1 and Pthrp. In vitro studies treating mouse

embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and chondrocytes with the
Hedgehog (Hh) agonist purmorphamine confirmed that
Hh signal transduction is defective in cells lacking Evc
[7]. Thus Evc is essential for Ihh signalling in the cartilage growth plate.
We have previously shown that Evc localises to the
base of primary cilia [7]. Seminal studies demonstrated
that primary cilia are required for Sonic hedgehog (Shh)
signalling [8,9] and subsequent studies have confirmed
that this is also the case for Ihh signalling [10,11]. Proteins are transported from the base to the tip of the
cilium by anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) and
back to the base by retrograde IFT, outward transport
being mediated by a kinesin motor and retrograde transport by a dynein motor. Key components of Hh signalling such as Ptch1 and Smoothened (Smo) have been
shown to enter and leave the cilium depending on the
activation status of the pathway [12]. Hh signalling is
ultimately meditated by the Gli transcription factor
family of proteins which are observed in the cilia as well
as in the nucleus [13]. In the absence of Hh signal, Gli3
is processed into a repressor form Gli3R, transcription
of Gli3 targets being dependent on the balance between
activator full-length Gli3 and Gli3R. Gli3 processing is
reduced both when anterograde IFT is disrupted and
when retrograde IFT is disrupted [8-10,14]. In Evc -/mice, in contrast to IFT mutants, Gli3 processing
appears normal on protein extracts from E14.5 limbs
though as with the IFT mutants, the expression of gene
targets of Hh signalling such as Ptch1 and Gli1 are
diminished [7]. In this study we demonstrate that, in
addition to Evc, Evc2 is also required for Hh signal
transduction. We have shown direct interaction between
Evc and Evc2, have investigated Evc and Evc2 subcellular localisation and discuss the significance of these
findings.

Results
Evc2 is a positive regulator of Hh signal transduction

Evc is known to be a positive regulator of Hh signalling
both in the cartilage growth plate and in cultured chondrocytes and MEFs. The observation that EVC and
EVC2 mutations are associated with the same phenotype
indicates that Evc2 is likely to be a positive regulator of
Hh signalling. We have tested this hypothesis using
siRNA to knockdown Evc2 expression in LIGHT2, Hh
reporter cells [15]. These cells are a mouse fibroblast
line that stably express a Gli-dependent firefly luciferase
and a TK Renilla luciferase control to allow quantitation
of Hh pathway activation. LIGHT2 cells transfected with
Evc2 siRNA had reduced Evc2 protein levels and had a
diminished response to the Smo agonist purmorphamine compared to controls transfected with a nontargeting siRNA (Figure 1a). This result was confirmed

in osteoblast-derived MC3T3 cells co-transfected with
the Gli-dependent firefly luciferase and TK Renilla luciferase plasmids (Figure 1b). We also assessed expression
of the Hh target gene, Ptch1 compared to expression of
the Hprt housekeeping gene in Evc2 null MEFs by RTPCR. Ptch1 expression in response to purmorphamine
in Evc2 mutant MEFs was reduced compared to wildtype MEF controls (Figure 1c). Since purmorphamine
activates Smo, these data confirm that, like Evc, Evc2 is
a positive regulator of the Hh signalling pathway.
Evc and Evc2 are homologues resulting from an ancient
gene duplication

We investigated what the protein sequence of EVC and
EVC2 could tell us about their relationship to each
other and to their function.
Evc (a 1005 amino acid protein) has a predicted signal
anchor sequence and Evc2 (a 1220 amino acid protein)
has a predicted signal peptide sequence and a second
predicted transmembrane region (amino acids 209 231), the only feature of the proteins C-terminal to
these transmembrane sequences being coiled-coil
regions. Sequence analysis predicts that they have
resulted from an ancient duplication of a pre-existing
gene whose occurrence predates the radiation of most
metazoan lineages [see additional file 1]. EVC2 was
identified as showing significant sequence similarity to
EVC over approximately 550 amino acids when the latter was used to query the non-redundant protein
sequence database using PSI-BLAST (second iteration,
E = 6 × 10-14). Next, EVC and EVC2 orthologues were
each found as gene predictions in the genome assemblies of amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), sea urchin
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), gastropod snail (Lottia
gigantea) and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis). For
example, a BLAST search of the nonredundant sequence
database with sea anemone EVC2 as query revealed significant similarity (E = 6 × 10 -25 ) with human EVC2
over 840 amino acids. Since these invertebrate species
and mammals last shared a common ancestor about 670
to 820 million years ago [16], this indicates that the
gene duplication giving rise to EVC and EVC2 occurred
in an early metazoan species. In amphioxus, sea urchin
and snail, but not sea anemone, genome assemblies
these two genes, as in vertebrates, lie in close proximity
in a 5’ to 5’ head-to-head arrangement. This arrangement, and the close proximity of their transcription
start sites, suggests that EVC and EVC2 share a bidirectional promoter [17]. This, in turn, suggests that EVC
and EVC2 need to be co-ordinately expressed in order
to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry, or because
they function in the same biological pathway. An EVClike gene is also predicted in the placozoan, Trichoplax
adhaerens, the most basal metazoan known [18] thereby

cells (b) transfected with siRNA and treated with control DMSO (white bars) or Hh agonist purmorphamine (black bars). Purmorphamine

blotting (lower images). Evc2 (approximately 140 kDa) was detected using R1656 and a tubulin (50 kDa) was used as a loading control. Cells
with reduced Evc2 protein levels (approximately 80% less than normal) have a significant reduction in Gli reporter expression in response to
purmorphamine compared to those transfected with the non-targeting siRNA pool. (c). The purmorphamine induced expression of the Hh
responsive gene, Ptch1, is significantly diminished in Evc2 null MEFs (-/-) compared to wild-type controls (+/+) as assessed by RT-PCR.

confirming the presence of EVC-like genes in the earliest metazoans. EVC and EVC2 orthologues are absent
from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes,
indicating that they have been deleted since they last
shared an ancestor with mammals.
Direct protein interaction between Evc and Evc2

To search for Evc-interacting proteins we screened a
cDNA library derived from E11 mouse embryos by the
yeast two-hybrid assay using Evc sequence encoding
amino acids 49 - 1005 as bait. This screen did not identify
any known Hh pathway components but did identify Evc2
as an Evc-interacting partner. In order to map this interaction, deletion constructs for both Evc and Evc2 were generated and used in a directed yeast-two-hybrid assay
(Figure 2a). Significant binding was observed with the following Evc constructs: expressing amino acid 49 - 1005,
463 - 1005, 222 - 873 and 222 - 800 and Evc2. No growth
was observed with an Evc construct expressing amino
acids 49 - 531 and restricted growth with the construct
coding for amino acids 222 - 647. Thus interaction was
observed for the four constructs containing the third and
fourth coiled-coil regions but restricted interaction with
the construct containing only the first three coiled-coil

regions and no interaction detected with the constructs
containing only the first two coiled-coil regions. Whilst
the fifth and sixth coiled-coil regions were contained
within constructs for which interaction was observed they
were not tested independently of the fourth coiled-coil
region. Significant binding was observed with the Evc2
construct expressing amino acids 250 - 671 and Evc
(Figure 2a). This portion of the Evc2 protein contains the
first three predicted coiled-coil regions; interaction was
not assessed for these three coiled-coil regions independently. We attempted to express full-length Evc and Evc2
proteins in mammalian cells to test for their interaction by
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Full-length proteins
could not be expressed at high levels in mammalian cells
and were insoluble in standard Co-IP buffers. Therefore
we co-expressed the shortest constructs for which strong
interaction was observed (Evc amino acids 463 - 1005 and
Evc2 amino acids 250 - 671) in HEK 293 cells with Flag
and Myc-tags, respectively, to test whether Evc and Evc2
interact in a mammalian expression system. HEK 293 cells
are ciliated renal cells [19]. Using antibodies against the
tags, each protein was bound independently to protein G
Sepharose beads. The beads were then extensively washed
prior to elution of the interacting proteins and we detected

Evc and Evc2 colocalize at the basal body and cilia

We have previously observed Evc at the distal end of the
basal body in vivo and in vitro [7]. To study Evc2 localization we raised a new polyclonal anti-Evc2 antibody,
R1656, and we observed Evc2 co-localization with Evc at
the basal body in fibroblast, osteoblast and chondrocyte
cultures and in renal derived IMCD3 cells (Figure 3a and
not shown). In addition, we observed diffuse pericentriolar staining for Evc2 (Figure 3a). Specificity of the Evc2
immunostaining was demonstrated by antigen blocking
and immunostaining in null Evc2 MEFs (data not
shown). On testing additional cell lines to ascertain Evc/
Evc2 localization we observed Evc along the length of the
ciliary axoneme in all cilia of osteoblast-derived MC3T3
cells (Figure 3b). In these cells co-staining detected Evc2
mainly at the base of cilia (Figure 3c). Co-transfection of
Evc and Evc2-GFP constructs into IMCD3 cells detected
both proteins along the length of the cilium (Figure 4ab), supporting the observations in MC3T3 cells. Cotransfection into MC3T3 and NIH3T3 cells also resulted
in both proteins localizing to the cilia (results not
shown). However, we did not observe basal body or cilia

localization when transfecting constructs expressing
either tagged Evc or Evc2 individually (Figure 4a).
Evc and Evc2 topography in the cilia membrane

Evc2 has a predicted signal peptide sequence and a
second predicted transmembrane region (amino acids
209 - 231). To address whether Evc2 spans the cilia
membrane and demonstrate its orientation in the membrane we immunostained co-transfected, non-permeabilized IMCD3 cells with antibodies generated against
peptides N-terminal and C-terminal of the second transmembrane domain (Figure 4b). Y-20 antibody was raised
against a peptide near the N-terminus of Evc2 between
the two predicted transmembrane domains and R1656
against a C-terminal region of Evc2 (amino acids 780 1124) (Figure 4c, Evc2 ab 1 and 2, respectively). Y-20
detected Evc2-GFP along the length of the cilium in
both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells demonstrating that this portion of Evc2 is extracellular (Figure
4b, Evc2 ab1). However, R1656 only detects cilial Evc2GFP in permeabilized cells, indicating that the region
that is C-terminal of the transmembrane domain and
detected by this antibody is intracellular (Figure 4bc
Evc2 ab 2). S43B antibody (raised against Evc amino
acids 459 - 999) detects native Evc in cilia in permeabilized MC3T3 cells, but does not detect Evc in nonpermeabilized MC3T3 cells (result not shown) or in

cilia in Evc2 null MEFs. This confirms that Evc2 is
essential for Evc cilia localization.
Primary cilia of cells lacking Evc appear structurally
normal

Although cilia in mice lacking Evc look normal on standard microscopy [7] the possibility remained that the
Hh signalling defect could be secondary to a structural
abnormality of cilia. We therefore examined cilia structure in chondrocytes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the basal body region, cilia from
mutant chondrocytes showed the normal configuration
of 9 triplet microtubules with transition fibers radiating
from the triplets at the distal end of the basal body (Figure 6, blue arrowheads). The champagne glass structures
that connect the microtubule doublets to the ciliary
membrane seen in the transition zone [20] are present
in the mutant chondrocytes (Figure 6, green arrowheads). Sections through the mid-portion of the cilia
show 9 microtubule doublets with normal orientation
and structure. In the distal region of the cilia there is
some collapse of the microtubule ring in chondrocyte
cilia from both wild-type and Evc-/- mouse (Figure 6,
red arrowheads), a feature that has been reported before
in normal cilia [21,22]. All observed cilia showed complete triplet microtubule structure in the basal body and
doublet microtubules in the ciliary region. No structural
differences were observed between the cilia from wildtype and Evc-/- chondrocytes.
Evc2, but not Evc, is found in the nucleus

Evc2 is required for localization of Evc at the base of
primary cilia

Evc and Evc2 are detected on cilia in several different
cell types by immunostaining. To determine if Evc and
Evc2 are located elsewhere in the cell we performed
subcellular fractionation on MEFs derived from wildtype and null mice. The purity of cytoplasmic and
nuclear protein samples was confirmed using antibodies
to alpha tubulin and c-jun, respectively (Figure 7). Specificity of the antibodies to Evc and Evc2 was confirmed
by the absence of bands on Western blots of MEFs
derived from null mice. We detected full-length Evc2
(approximately 140 kDa protein) both in the cytoplasmic
and in the nuclear fractions but only detected full-length
Evc (approximately 130 kDa protein) in cytoplasmic
fractions.

Since both Evc and Evc2 are co-dependent for cilia localization of expressed proteins, we tested if Evc2 is
required for cilia localization of Evc in Evc2 null cells.
MEFs derived from Evc2 mutant mice do not produce
any Evc2 transcript or protein (Figure 5a and 6a). Evc
and Evc2 are both detected at the base of primary cilia
in wild-type MEFs (Figure 5c and not shown, respectively). Despite the presence of Evc transcript and protein (Figure 5a-b) Evc was not detected at the base of

Discussion
The fact that mutations in EVC and EVC2 cause the
same human phenotype, the chondrodysplasia Ellis-van
Creveld syndrome, suggested that these two proteins act
in the same pathway. We have shown that Evc and Evc2
are both positive regulators of the Hh pathway and that
they interact directly with each other. The Hh pathway
defect described in Evc and Evc2 mutants is downstream

non-permeabilzed co-transfected IMCD3 cells (Figure
4bc, Evc ab). This indicates that the region of Evc Cterminal of the transmembrane domain is also intracellular. Thus, the regions of Evc and Evc2 that we have
shown by Co-IP to interact are intracellular whilst the
N-terminus of Evc2 is extracellular (Figure 4c).

representative cell. (a). Single transfection and co-transfection of Evc and Evc2-GFP constructs (the protein expressed is given on the left of

Evc2 by the GFP tag and cilia by acetylated tubulin staining (tubulin; green or red). Co-expression of both proteins results in their expression on

of the action of purmorphamine. It is known that purmorphamine directly activates Smo and promotes its
entry onto the cilium [23,24]. Thus, both Evc and Evc2
are positive regulators that act on, or downstream of,
Smo in Hh signal transduction.
Analysis of EVC and EVC2 gene sequences predicts
that they have arisen from an ancient duplication. Conservation of their 5’ to 5’ head to head arrangement and
proximity of transcriptional start sites suggests that EVC
and EVC2 need to be co-ordinately expressed in order
to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry, or because
they function in the same biological pathway. It is interesting to note that Evc-like genes are absent from organisms that do not use cilia for Hh signalling (flies) or that
do not have Hh signalling (worms).
We studied Evc and Evc2 subcellular localization and
observed that Evc2 co-localizes with Evc at the base of
primary cilia in fibroblast and chondrocyte cultures and
in renal-derived cell lines. On testing additional cell lines
we observed additional Evc along the length of the ciliary
axoneme in the osteoblast-derived MC3T3 cell line. One
interpretation of the difference between the immunofluorescence analysis in this cell line and other cell lines,
primary cell cultures and on tissue cryosections is that
the amount of native protein normally present in cilia is
below the sensitivity of immunofluorescence in most
cells. Indeed, MC3T3 cells do express higher levels of
Evc than other cells studied (Western blot analysis not

shown). Cilia localization of co-expressed protein from
constructs is in keeping with this interpretation but
another possibility is that localization of Evc and Evc2 to
the cilia is dependent on additional factors, analogous to
the way in which localization of Ptch1, the Hh receptor,
and Smo localization changes on addition of ligand.
Ptch1 localizes to the cilium in the absence of ligand, but
on ligand binding leaves the cilium upon which Smo
enters the cilium and in turn regulates processing and
activation of the three Gli transcription factors. We did
not observe a change in Evc or Evc2 localization in
MC3T3 and IMCD3 cells after treatment with purmorphamine (results not shown) which suggests that cilia
localization of Evc and Evc2 is not dependent on pathway
activation status.
The observation that overexpressed Evc and Evc2 proteins localize to the cilium after co-transfection, but not
when expressed individually, suggests that basal body
and cilia localization is dependent on the interaction
between Evc and Evc2. This was confirmed using MEFs
from Evc2 null mice where Evc is present but does not
localize to the base of primary cilia. Co-dependent localization of Evc and Evc2 could explain why mutations in
either gene result in an indistinguishable patient phenotype. Given that both Evc and Evc2 possess transmembrane domains, observing them on the cilium led us to
question whether they span the cilia membrane and, if
so, their orientation in the membrane. We addressed

section and red lines (left) indicate the approximate position of transverse sections. Transverse sections of cilia are from wild-type (+/+) and Evc
mutant (-/-) chondrocytes cells. In both genotypes, disorganized doublets were found in the distal region (red arrow heads) and the champagne
glass structures were found in the proximal region (green arrow heads). Nine triplet microtubules and spike structures (blue arrow heads) could
be identified in transverse sections of basal body. Scale bar 100 nm.

this by comparison of immunofluorescence on permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells with antibodies generated against peptides N-terminal and C-terminal of
the transmembrane domain of Evc2. These confirmed
that Evc2 spans the cilia membrane and that the
N-terminal portion is extracellular. Evc has a predicted
signal anchor sequence and comparison of immunofluorescence signal on permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells demonstrated that Evc is intracellular.
Furthermore, the regions of Evc and Evc2 that we
have demonstrated to interact are both intracellular
(Figure 4c).
A question that arises when a Hh signalling defect
results from loss of a cilia protein is whether this defect
is due to a cilia abnormality or due to specific modulation

of Hh signal transduction. Ultrastructural analysis of cilia
of Evc mutant cells does not revealed any abnormalities
suggesting that the mutant phenotype does not result
from defective cilia but rather that Evc is a specific modifier of Hh signal transduction.
In addition to the cilia localization, we detected Evc2
in MEF nuclear extracts by Western blotting. We
detected Evc in cytoplasmic but not in nuclear extracts
suggesting that Evc does not enter the nucleus, although
we cannot exclude the possibility that Evc is present at
undetectable levels in the nucleus. Evc and Evc2 were
not observed in the nucleus by immunostaining, but a
diffuse nuclear distribution may be difficult to distinguish from background staining. Also, overexpressed
proteins were not observed in the nucleus when

localize to cilia as well as the nucleus. Further experiments are required to determine whether Ellis-van Creveld proteins move in conjunction with Gli proteins or
via an independent pathway.

Conclusions
We have previously shown that Evc is a positive modulator of Ihh signalling at the growth plate acting at or
downstream of Smo. Here we have shown that Evc2 is
also required for Hh signalling and that there is a direct
physical interaction between the two proteins.
We have shown that they localize to the membrane of
primary cilia in a co-dependent manner and have
deduced their orientation within the cilia membrane,
the C-terminus of each being intracellular and only
Evc2 having an extracellular portion. We have found
that Evc2 is present in the nucleus but cannot detect
Evc in nuclear extracts. We conclude that Evc and Evc2
are interacting proteins that together modulate Hh signal transduction.
Methods
Cell culture

Figure 7 Evc2 is present in both the cytoplasm and the
nucleus of MEF cells. Western blot analysis of total, cytoplasmic
and nuclear proteins from wild-type (+/+) and Evc2 (-/-) (a) and Evc
(-/-) (b) MEFs. The purity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein
samples was confirmed using antibodies to a-tubulin
(approximately 50 kDa) exclusively cytoplasmic and c-Jun
(approximately 43 kDa), exclusively nuclear. Full-length Evc2 (140
kDa) was detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear samples.
Full-length Evc protein (130 kDa) was only detected in the
cytoplasm. Antibodies to both proteins detected several additional
bands that are assumed to be non-specific as they are present in
the null MEFs.

expressed alone or when co-expressed leading us to
conclude that additional factors are required to transport Evc2 into the nucleus, a process that may depend
on activation of the Hh pathway.
The presence of Evc2 both in the ciliary membrane
and in the nucleus is intriguing. There is a precedent
for proteolytic processing and translocation to the
nucleus of the C-terminal region of a cilia membrane
protein in polycystin 1 (PC1) [25]. After cleavage, the
C-terminal peptide of PC1 moves to the nucleus where
it associates with Stat6 and p100 to activate gene transcription. The nuclear localization and the N-terminal
extracellular portion of Evc2 may indicate an analogous
role for Evc2 in the regulation of Hh target gene transcription in response to extracellular signals.
One of the many recent surprises regarding Hh signalling was the finding that the Gli transcription factors

All cells were cultured in medium containing 10% FBS
(Invitrogen Ltd; Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C and 5%
CO 2. Medium was obtained from Invitrogen Ltd.
LIGHT2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g/l glucose; MC3T3 cells in alpha MEM and IMCD3 and HEK
293 cells in DMEM/F12 (1:1) and DMEM respectively
with non-essential amino acids. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were established from E14.5 mutant and
littermate control embryos [26] and cultured in DMEM
without Na pyruvate, with non-essential amino acids
and penicillin/streptomycin. Evc mice and the generation of Evc-/- MEFs was described previously [7]. Evc2-/MEFs were derived from Evc2 null mice that were generated by replacing exon1 of Evc2 with a reporter gene
encoding the green fluorescence protein fused in frame
to the first ATG of Evc2 (unpublished data). Experiments were performed using MEFs cultured for less
than eight passages.
SiRNA knock-down and Hh assays

siRNAs were ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool for Mouse
Evc2 and ON-TARGETplus non-targeting siRNA pool 1
as a control (Dharmacon). Cells were transfected in triplicate on 12 well plates when 50% confluent. LIGHT2
cells were transfected with 100 pmoles siRNA/well
using Dharmafect1 reagent (Dharmacon). MC3T3 cells
were transfected with 80 pmoles siRNA/well using XtremeGENE siRNA reagent (Roche Applied Science,
Penzberg, Germany). One day later MC3T3 cells were
co-transfected with the 8xGli-BS-Luc [27] and TKRenilla plasmid (Promega WI, USA) at a ratio of 4:1

using Fugene HD reagent (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Cells were treated for 48 hours with
purmorphamine (2 μM, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA,
USA) or an equivalent amount of DMSO carrier as a
negative control. LIGHT2 and MC3T3 cells were harvested 72 and 48 hours after transfection, respectively,
and assayed for luciferase reporter expression using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega WI,
USA) and a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo
Scientific, Walthem, MA, USA). The data was normalized by calculating the ratio of Firefly to Renilla luciferase readings (FF Luc/Ren Luc). Each experiment was
repeated at least twice in triplicate. P values were calculated by t-test (Two Sample Assuming Unequal Variances). Evc2 protein knockdown in cell lysates was
assessed by Western blotting and densitometry.
For Ptch1 RT-PCR in MEFs, assays were carried out in
triplicate on 2 Evc2 -/- and 2 Evc2 +/+ wild-type MEF
cultures. Cells were treated with purmorphamine or
DMSO as above for 48 hours. RNA was prepared using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Ltd; Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
first strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III
(Invitrogen Ltd; Carlsbad, CA, USA). Simultaneous PCR
amplification of Ptch1 (nt 1944 - 2303 [GenBank:
NM_008957]) and Hprt (nt 108 - 294 [GenBank:
NM_013556) was performed for 22 cycles in standard
PCR conditions. Ratios of Ptch1 to Hprt band intensity
were determined for each culture before and after
treatment.
Sequence analysis

PSI-BLAST [28] searches employed default parameters,
and mouse sequences as queries (unless otherwise stated) against the non-redundant protein sequence database held at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (Bethesda, MD). BLASTp and TBLASTn
searches of Lottia gigantea and Branchiostoma floridae
gene models and genome assemblies used web-based
searches at the Joint Genome Institute http://www.jgi.
doe.gov/. Signal peptides and anchors were predicted
using SignalP-HMM [29]. Coiled coil sequences were
predicted using Coils [30] and a threshold of p > 0.5.
The phylogenetic tree of EVC and EVC2 sequences was
constructed with the Fitch-Margoliash algorithm using a
Poisson genetic distance and global optimization with
bootstrapping (PMID: 5334057).
Yeast Two-Hybrid analysis

Mouse Evc in pAS2-1 vector was transformed into yeast
strain AH109 and used as a bait to screen approximately 1.25 × 106 clones from a mouse 11-day embryo
cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector and
pre-transformed into yeast strain Y187 (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA). Positive interactions were

identified by growth of mated bait and library cells on
media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine and adenine
at 30°C for 4 - 8 days. Positive colonies were confirmed
by X-alpha-galactosidase activity assay. For the directed
yeast two-hybrid studies, AH109 and Y187 yeast strains
were transformed with Evc and Evc2 constructs and
mated. Matings between yeast containing the pGBKT7p53 and pGADT7-T-antigen vectors were used as a
control for positive interaction.
Constructs

For yeast two-hybrid library screening, mouse Evc
sequence encoding amino acids 49 - 1005 which does
not include the transmembrane domain was cloned into
pAS2-1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).
For directed yeast two-hybrid analysis, mouse Evc fragments were cloned into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA) and mouse Evc2 fragments
were cloned into pGADT7 vector (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA, USA). For co-immunoprecipitation studies,
the Evc fragment (amino acids 463 - 991) was cloned
into pCMV-3xFLAG-10 vector (3 × Flag fusion; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the Evc2 fragment
(amino acids 250 - 671) into pCMV-3 vector (Myc
fusion; Stratagene Corp; La Jolla, CA. USA). For subcellular localization studies, the complete mouse Evc coding region was cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen Ltd;
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The complete mouse Evc2 coding
region was cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA, USA). The stop codon was mutated to allow
translational read-through into the EGFP gene. All constructs were sequenced to confirm correct gene
sequence and reading frame.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)

HEK 293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) were transiently
transfected with the Myc- and 3 × FLAG-tagged constructs using GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene Corp; La
Jolla, CA. USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfections were performed in T75 flasks at
80% confluence, using 60 μl GeneJammer and 10 μg
each plasmid, and were allowed to grow for 48 hours.
Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES
pH7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 20 mM betaglycerophosphate, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science,
Penzberg, Germany) for 30 min, and spun in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C. Lysates were incubated for
1 hour at 4°C with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow
beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) to pre-clear,
and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4°C.
Lysates were incubated 24 hours at 4°C with Protein G
Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) and 1 μg anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotech

Inc; CA, USA) or anti-FLAG antibody (M2; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The beads were then
washed extensively with lysis buffer. The co-immunopreciptates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotech Inc; CA,
USA) or anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA).
Evc2 antibody production

Amino acids 780 - 1124 of the mouse Evc2 protein
(GenBank BAC06589) were expressed with a 6 × His
tag in E. coli, purified by Ni2+ chelation chromatography
(Novagen) and used to immunize rabbit. Total IgGs
were prepared from final serum (Protein G HiTrap, GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Total rabbit IgGs often
bind non-specifically to centrosomes therefore it was
important that mouse Evc2 specific IgGs were isolated.
For this, the antigen region was expressed in Escherichia.coli with a GST tag and purified on Glutathione
sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Specific
anti-Evc2 IgGs, henceforth referred to as R1656, were
purified by affinity to the GST-tagged Evc2 protein.
Immunofluorescent staining

Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
PBS at 4°C for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1%
Triton X100 in PBS for 10 minutes (S43B and permeabilization experiments) or in PBS for 10 minutes (nonpermeablization experiments); ice-cold MeOH/Acetone
(1:1) for 6 minutes (R1656) or ice-cold methanol for 3
minutes (Y20). Primary antibodies were: sheep polyclonal
anti-Evc (S43B [7]); rabbit polyclonal anti-Evc2 (R1656);
goat polyclonal anti-Evc2 (Y-20, Santa Cruz Biotech Inc;
CA, USA); anti-acetylated tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and mouse monoclonal anti-gamma
tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary
antibodies were: donkey anti-sheep AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Ltd; Carlsbad, CA, USA); goat
anti-rabbit FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Inc; PA,
USA); goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA); donkey anti-goat FITC (Jackson Immuno Research
Labs Inc; PA, USA); rabbit anti-goat Cy3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA); donkey anti-mouse AMCA (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs Inc; PA, USA); horse anti-mouse
TexasRed (Vector Labs, UK) and goat anti-mouse FITC
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Samples were
mounted in Vectashield with or without DAPI (Vector
Labs, UK) and images captured on an Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Antibody blocking experiments
were performed by preincubating primary antibody with
approximately 2 μg of GST-Evc2 on beads and GST control (for R1656). At least ten cilia were visualized in each
experiment. MC3T3 cells and MEFs were serum starved
overnight prior to immunofluorescent staining to induce

approximately 60% ciliation of cells. Ciliation of IMCD3
cells approached 100% without serum starvation.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

Chondrocytes were isolated from the proximal tibial epiphyses of E18.5 wild-type and Evc-/- littermates. First tissue was dissected and washed in PBS. Cells were
released from the extracellular matrix by sequential
digestion with hyaluronidase (5 minutes, 1 mg/ml PBS),
trypsin (10 minutes, 2.5 mg/ml PBS) and collagenase
(5 hour, 3 mg/ml DMEM containing 10% FBS) at 37°C
with constant rotation. The chondrocytes were incubated in DMEM for a maximum of seven days. We confirmed by real-time PCR that these cells retained
chondrocyte expression profiles during this time period.
Cells were grown on culture inserts (Nunc, Thermo
Scientific, Walthem, MA, USA) and serum starved overnight prior to fixation to induce cilia production. Cells
were fixed in 2% PFA/PBS at 4°C for 1 hour, dehydrated
and embedded in LR White resin (EMS). Ultra thin sections (approximately 80 nm) were prepared on a RMC
MT-XL ultramicrotome and stained on Pioloform
filmed copper grids with 2% aqueous Uranyl Acetate
and Lead Citrate (Leica UK Ltd). The ultra structure of
2 Evc-/- and 3 wild type cilia was observed with a Philips
CM 100 Compustage (FEI) Transmission Electron
Microscope and digital images collected using an AMT
CCD camera (Deben).
Cytoplasmic/nuclear fractionation and Western blotting

Evc2-/- MEFs were characterized by RT-PCR amplification of Evc2 (nt 533 - 830 [GenBank: AB083066]); Evc
(nt 1445 - 3060 [GenBank: AJ250841]) and Hprt (see
above), and by western blotting. The cellular fractionation protocol was adapted from published methods [31].
Briefly null and control MEFs from T75 flasks were suspended in ice-cold cell swelling buffer containing 10 mM
HEPES pH7.9; 10 mM KCl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM
EGTA; 1 mM DTT; 0.5 mM PMSF and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg,
Germany) for 15 minutes. A sample was taken to provide
total protein. Cytoplasmic proteins were released by vortexing in 4% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
and collected in the supernatant after centrifugation for
30 seconds at 13500 g. The pellet was washed in cell
swelling buffer three times and resuspended in three
times the pellet volume of 20 mM HEPES pH7.9; 0.4 M
NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM
PMSF and protease inhibitors to release nuclear proteins.
Nuclear proteins were collected from the supernatant
after centrifugation for 5 minutes at 13500 g.
Western blotting was performed using the following
primary antibodies; rabbit anti-Evc2 (R1656 described
here); sheep anti-Evc (S43G,[7]), mouse anti-a tubulin

(clone B-5-1-2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA);
mouse anti-b actin (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and rabbit anti-c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated, donkey anti-sheep
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Inc; PA, USA); goat
anti-mouse (Thermo Scientific, Walthem, MA, USA)
and goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs
Inc; PA, USA). Peroxidase was detected using the SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Thermo
Scientific, Walthem, MA, USA).
