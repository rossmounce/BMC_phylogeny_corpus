Abstract
Background: Carboxylesterases (CES) perform diverse metabolic roles in mammalian organisms in the
detoxification of a broad range of drugs and xenobiotics and may also serve in specific roles in lipid,
cholesterol, pheromone and lung surfactant metabolism. Five CES families have been reported in mammals
with human CES1 and CES2 the most extensively studied. Here we describe the genetics, expression and
phylogeny of CES isozymes in the opossum and report on the sequences and locations of CES1, CES2 and
CES6 'like' genes within two gene clusters on chromosome one. We also discuss the likely sequence of
gene duplication events generating multiple CES genes during vertebrate evolution.
Results: We report a cDNA sequence for an opossum CES and present evidence for CES1 and CES2 like
genes expressed in opossum liver and intestine and for distinct gene locations of five opossum CES
genes,CES1, CES2.1, CES2.2, CES2.3 and CES6, on chromosome 1. Phylogenetic and sequence alignment
studies compared the predicted amino acid sequences for opossum CES with those for human, mouse,
chicken, frog, salmon and Drosophila CES gene products. Phylogenetic analyses produced congruent
phylogenetic trees depicting a rapid early diversification into at least five distinct CES gene family clusters:
CES2, CES1, CES7, CES3, and CES6. Molecular divergence estimates based on a Bayesian relaxed clock
approach revealed an origin for the five mammalian CES gene families between 328–378 MYA.
Conclusion: The deduced amino acid sequence for an opossum cDNA was consistent with its identity
as a mammalian CES2 gene product (designated CES2.1). Distinct gene locations for opossum CES1 (1:
446,222,550–446,274,850), three CES2 genes (1: 677,773,395–677,927,030) and a CES6 gene (1:
677,585,520–677,730,419) were observed on chromosome 1. Opossum CES1 and multiple CES2 genes
were expressed in liver and intestine. Amino acid sequences for opossum CES1 and three CES2 gene
products revealed conserved residues previously reported for human CES1 involved in catalysis, ligand
binding, tertiary structure and organelle localization. Phylogenetic studies indicated the gene duplication
events which generated ancestral mammalian CES genes predated the common ancestor for marsupial and
eutherian mammals, and appear to coincide with the early diversification of tetrapods.

Background
Carboxylesterases (CES; E.C.3.1.1.1) catalyse many
hydrolytic and transesterification reactions and use a wide
range of substrates, including xenobiotic carboxyl esters,
thioesters and aromatic amides, anticancer drugs such as
CPT-11 and capecitabine, narcotics such as heroine and
cocaine, clinical drugs such as lovastatin and lidocaine,
organophosphate and carbamate poisons such as sarin,
tabun and soman and insecticides (eg. malathion) [1-3].
The enzyme also catalyses reactions in cholesterol and
fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acyl CoA hydrolase
[4], acyl CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase [5], cholesterol:ester hydrolase [6], acyl carnitine hydrolase [7], fatty
acyl: ethyl ester synthase [8] and triacylglycerol hydrolase
[9], and may serve specific roles in lung surfactant [10]
and pheromone [11] metabolism. CES is predominantly
localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has an
N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide consistent with a
trafficking role through the ER [12].
CES is widely distributed in biological organisms and has
been extensively studied in mammals, particularly in
humans, mouse and rat [7,13-15]. Six human CES genes
have been reported on chromosome 16: CES1, encoding
the major liver enzyme which is also found in lung epithelia, macrophages and other tissues [16,17]; CES2, encoding the major intestinal enzyme and also expressed in
liver, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle [18,19]; CES3,
expressed in liver, colon and small intestine [20,21]; and
CES4 [22,23], CES6 [24] and CES7 [25,26], the products
of which are less well characterized as proteins. The genes
occur in 2 clusters approximately 11 million bps apart on
chromosome 16: CES4.CES1.CES7 and CES2.CES3.CES6
[RS Holmes, J Glenn, JL VandeBerg & LA Cox: Baboon carboxylesterases 1 and 2: sequences, structures and phylogenetic relationships with human and other primate
carboxylesterases, unpublished]. The close proximity and
sequence similarity of these genes (47% identity for
human CES1 and CES2 cDNAs) imply that they arose
from an ancestral gene duplication event [27,28]. Tertiary
and quaternary structures for several human CES1 complexes have been determined at high resolution (2.8Å)
which are consistent with three functional domains: the
catalytic domain containing the active site 'triad' and the
carbohydrate binding site; the αβ domain supporting the
majority of the hydrophobic internal structure and the
subunit-subunit binding sites; and the regulatory domain
which facilitates substrate binding, product release and
the trimer-hexamer equilibrium [3,15,29,30].
Studies on the evolution of CES have demonstrated that
genetic variability for this enzyme contributes significantly to selection, particularly for Drosophila, where multiple genes have been identified, including EST6, which
plays a key role in reproduction, and JHE (juvenile hor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/54

mone esterase), which serves an essential role in insect
development [31,32]. In addition, evolutionary selection
mechanisms for insecticide resistance have been observed
in several arthropod species by the amplification of CES
genes [33]. Previous studies on mammalian CES evolution have focused on the identification and classification
of multiple CES genes, particularly for human, mouse, rat
and other eutherian mammals [1,2,7,18,22,28]. Initial
studies described two major mammalian CES gene families, CES1 and CES2, which apparently evolved from an
ancestral CES gene [16,18,28], whereas more recent
reports have proposed five CES gene families, based on
phylogenetic analyses of 48 sequences of mammalian CES
[7], which are consistent with the five families of human
CES genes described earlier [16-26].
This paper extends current knowledge on CES evolution
to a marsupial species and reports the cDNA and deduced
amino acid sequence for an opossum CES (designated as
CES2.1), RT-PCR expression and in silico studies providing
evidence for CES1 and CES2 'like' genes on chromosome
1 of the opossum and the phylogenetic relationships of
opossum CES2.1 and predicted opossum CES gene products with human CESs. The opossum is a marsupial which
is used as an animal model in studying the genetics of
heart disease and cancer [34,35], and given the roles of
mammalian CES in cholesterol, fatty acid and xenobiotic
metabolism, these studies may contribute significantly to
the identification of candidate genes for these diseases. In
addition, this report on opossum CES provides evidence
for the appearance of five CES gene families prior to
metatherian mammals during vertebrate evolution.

Results and discussion
Opossum CES2 Gene Products
The open reading frame of the full-length cDNA (GenBank: EU019537) comprised 1653 nucleotides; and the 5'
UTR and 3' UTR comprised 28 nucleotides and 99 nucleotides, respectively. This was obtained by using primers
based on a 421 bp opossum cDNA (GenBank:
DR038241) showing sequence similarity to mammalian
CES to amplify a full-length opossum CES cDNA from
liver RNA. The best-scoring alignment in a BLAST analysis
[36,37] for the opossum cDNA sequence was with a
human CES2 sequence, and the opossum cDNA is
referred to as CES2.1 (gene designation: CES2.1). Using
the opossum CES2 cDNA as the query in a BLAT search
[38,39], we found two additional CES gene regions and
cDNAs which are referred to as CES2.2 (gene designation:
CES2.2) and CES2.3 (gene designation: CES2.3) (Table
1). These latter genes were subjected to further analyses
using RT-PCR and sequencing the product CES cDNAs.

Opossum CES1 and CES2 Gene Expression Studies
Expression of the predicted CES genes in the liver and
small intestine was analyzed by RT-PCR (Figure 1). Controls were also conducted to ensure that DNase-treated
liver and intestine RNAs could not serve as templates for
RT- PCR (See Additional File 1).

We also sequenced the CES2.2 cDNA (Accession No.
EU019538), and found that 33 nucleotides in the pre-

An opossum CES1 gene was identified by in silico methods
using the human CES1 amino acid sequence to interrogate the opossum genome [40] in a BLAT analysis [37-39].
Primers based on the predicted opossum CES1 cDNA
sequence amplified a 750 bp PCR product which was similar to the predicted PCR product (741 bp), indicating that
the CES1 gene is expressed in liver and intestine.
Unlike the CES1 gene, the CES2.1 gene was expressed in
the liver, but not in the small intestine. The CES2.2 and
CES2.3 genes were also identified by in silico methods.
Primers for the CES2.2 cDNA amplified an 800 bp PCR
product, which was similar to the predicted PCR product
(803 bp), indicating that the CES2.2 gene is expressed in
liver and intestine. However, primers for CES2.3 cDNA
amplified a PCR product of about 770 bp, which is larger
than the 667 bp PCR product based on the predicted
cDNA sequence. The CES2.3 cDNA was sequenced (GenBank: EU019539) and this showed that 99 nucleotides
were missing from the predicted BLAT derived sequence.
The PCR product for the CES2.3 gene should have been
766 bp. These results indicate that the CES2.3 gene is
expressed in both liver and small intestine and that the
BLAT derived sequence contained a deletion as compared

dicted sequence were absent in the CES2.2 cDNA
sequence. These RT-PCR studies of opossum CES2.2 and
CES2.3 genes show that the BLAT software [38,39] used to
predict sequences for opossum CES gene products did not
fully recognize all of the intron-exon junctions resulting
in some deletions or insertions that are not found in the
in vivo gene product. This emphasizes the importance of
undertaking cDNA sequencing to obtain sequences for
these and other cDNAs.
Opossum CES2.1, CES2.2 and CES2.3 Deduced Amino
Acid Sequences
The deduced amino acid sequence for opossum CES2.1 is
shown in Figure 2 with the previously reported sequence
for human CES2 [18,19], together with the predicted protein sequences for opossum CES2.2 and CES2.3. The latter
sequences were predicted from BLAT studies [38,39] using
the opossum CES2.1 sequence to interrogate the opossum
genome but corrected following alignment with the
CES2.2 (GenBank: EU019538) and CES2.3 (GenBank:
EU019539) sequences. The three opossum CES2 like
sequences were very similar, especially for the CES2.2 and
CES2.3 sequences, which shared 94% sequence identity.
In addition, the deduced amino acid sequences for opossum CES2.1, CES2.2 and CES2.3 showed 56–57%
sequence identity with human CES2 and 44–47% identity
with human CES1 (Figure 2; Table 2).

Several key residues in these enzymes were conserved,
including (sequence numbers refer to opossum CES2)
Cys94/Cys121 and Cys278/Cys289, the sites for disulfide
bond formation in human CES1 [3,15,29,30,41], and
active site residues responsible for the formation of acylester intermediates (Ser226) and the charge relay system
in catalysis (Glu343) and His (452) [3]. The deduced
amino acid sequence for opossum CES2.1 was 9 residues
shorter (550 residues) than for human CES2 (559 residues), and lacked the microsomal targeting sequence at
the C-terminus end of the enzyme. The human CES2 Cterminal tetrapeptide sequence, His-Thr-Glu-Leu (HTEL),
functions in protein retrieval from the Golgi apparatus
and in CES retention in the ER lumen [12], but this is
missing in opossum CES2.1 which may then influence the
subcellular location and metabolic role for this enzyme in
opossum liver. In contrast, opossum CES2.2 and CES2.3
sequences retain a homologous Arg-Met-Glu-Leu (RMEL)
tetrapeptide sequence and these enzymes may then be
localized within the liver endoplasmic reticulum. Opossum CES2.1, CES2.2 and CES2.3 sequences however share
a homologous hydrophobic N-terminus signal peptide
(residues 1–25, 1–24 and 1–24 respectively) with human
CES2 (residues 1–26) [12].
The N-glycosylation site reported in human CES1 [42]
was also found in opossum CES2.1 (86Asn-Ala-Thr) with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/54

four additional potential N-glycosylation sites observed at
274Asn-Leu-Ser, 293Asn-Lys-Thr, 376Asn-Ile-Ser and
425Asn-Ser-Ser. In contrast, opossum CES2.2 and CES2.3
lacked the N-glycosylation site at the corresponding position (85Asp-X-Thr), as did human CES2 (87Asp-X-Thr),
but retained another potential site (273Asn-Leu-Ser) in
common with opossum CES2.1. The two charge clamps
reported for human CES1 [43] which contribute to the
formation of trimers and hexamers for this enzyme are
retained for one site on each of the opossum CES2 like
gene products (85Arg predicted charge clamp188Glu) but
not for the second site (86Asp...191Pro) in each case (Figure 2). The impact on the tertiary and potential quaternary
structures for these opossum CES2 like enzymes remains
to be determined, however it is relevant to note that
human and baboon CES2 are monomers, presumably as
a result of the lack of both charge clamps and the N-glycosylation site for sialic acid attachment, which contribute
to subunit-subunit binding for human CES1 [43].
Other key functional residues for human CES1 and CES2
have been retained by the opossum CES2 like enzymes,
including the 'Z-site' (Gly356 for human CES1), which
functions in cholesterol binding; the 'side door' residues
at 424Val.Met425.Phe426; and the 'gate' residue 551Phe
(for human CES1), both of which have either been
retained or have undergone conservative substitution.
These latter sequences apparently function in facilitating
the release of fatty acyl or aromatic groups, respectively,
following hydrolysis [3,15,29,30]. In addition to the
extensive sequence similarities observed for the human
CES2 and opossum CES2Like products, there are strong
similarities in predicted secondary structures for these
enzymes suggesting that the αβ-hydrolase structure previously reported for human CES1 [3,15,29,30] has been
predominantly retained by these enzymes (see Figure 2).
There were some differences observed however for predicted secondary structures for the opossum CES2 like
enzymes near key residues and these may influence
enzyme function. For example, predicted helical secondary structures near the 'Z-site' and 'side door' were of different lengths for these enzymes which may influence
ligand binding and product release, respectively.
Predicted Opossum CES1 Amino Acid Sequence
The predicted amino acid sequence for opossum CES1 is
shown in Figure 2 together with previously reported
sequences for human CES1 and other opossum and
human CES sequences [16-26]. The predicted opossum
CES1 amino acid sequence (derived from N-Scan ID
1.45.030 following BLAT analysis [38,39] of the opossum
genome using the human CES1 sequence) was longer
(670 residues) than human CES1 (567 residues) with an
additional 111 residues at the N-terminus end which did
not align with the human CES1 sequence. Given the sim-

ilarity of the predicted sequence for opossum CES1 with
human CES1 at the N-terminus and our observations of
incorrectly predicted splice sites, it is likely that opossum
CES1 shares the same N-terminus start point with human
CES1 and it is this sequence that is included in Figure 2.
Sequencing the RT-PCR product using primers derived
from the predicted opossum CES1 sequence enabled confirmation
of
750
bp
of
this
sequence
(GeneBank:EU07430).
The predicted amino acid sequence for opossum CES1
showed 63% identity with human CES1 and 46% identity
with human CES2 supporting its designation within the
CES1 family (Table 2). Opossum CES1 also shared several
key residues with human CES1, including the active site
'triad', Ser221, Glu353 and His468 (residue numbers refer
to the opossum CES1 sequence); the corresponding
cysteine residues forming the disulfide bonds in human
CES1 (Cys87/Cys116 and Cys273/Cys284); the microsomal C-terminus retention sequence His-Ile-Glu-Leu
(HIEL); and the high-mannose N-linked glycosylation site
at Asn190-X-Thr. Two other potential glycosylation sites
(257Asn-Ser-Ser and 528Asn-Ile-Thr) were also observed
for the opossum CES1 sequence (Fig. 3). The N-terminal
microsomal signal peptide for human CES1, which
retains the enzyme within the ER [12] was identical in
sequence with the predicted opossum CES1 sequence,
and both sequences retain 18 homologous residues in
corresponding positions.

Subunit-subunit charge clamps reported for human CES1
[43] are retained for the predicted opossum CES1 protein:
72Glu predicted charge clamp186Arg; and 78Lys predicted
charge clamp183Glu, suggesting that this enzyme may
share the trimer-hexamer quaternary structure. The 'Z-site'
glycine residue, which is a site for binding cholesterol analogues in human CES1, has been substituted in the opossum CES1 sequence (355Ala) which may reflect a change
in the ligand binding properties for this enzyme. The 'side
door' and 'gate' sequences for human CES1
(424Val.425Met.426Phe and 551Phe, respectively),
which function in facilitating the release of fatty acid and
aromatic products respectively following hydrolysis of
substrate [3,15,29,30], have also undergone substitutions
for these key sites, involving two of three 'side door' residues (422Leu.423Ile.424Phe) and the 'gate' residue
(549Met) for opossum CES1. In each case, however, the
hydropathic nature of these sites has been retained, which
may reflect retention of functions for these sites. The predicted secondary structure for opossum CES1 was similar
with that reported for human CES1 [3,15,29,30],
although differences in helical lengths at the 'side door'
and 'gate' sites were apparent (Figure 2).
Comparisons of Opossum CES1, CES2 'Like' and CES6
'Like' Sequences with Human CES Sequences
Figure 2 and Table 2 show the amino acid sequence alignments, the predicted secondary structures and sequence
identities for the predicted opossum CES1, multiple
CES2Like and CES6Like proteins, as well as the six human
CES gene products, previously described [16-26] (RS Hol-

mes, J Glenn, JL VandeBerg & LA Cox: Baboon carboxylesterases 1 and 2: sequences, structures and phylogenetic
relationships with human and other primate carboxylesterases, unpublished). All of the opossum and human
CESs examined showed similarities in sequences and predicted secondary structures, consistent with being members of the CES αβ-hydrolase family [3,15]. Using the 3dimensional structure reported for human CES1 as the
basis for discussing structure-functional relationships
[3,15,29,30], a number of common features were
observed for most enzymes, including the N-terminal 'signal peptide', the cysteine residues involved in forming
disulfide bridges, the active site serine, glutamate and histidine residues; and the hydrophobic regions of the 'side
door' and 'gate'.
A number of differences were observed however between
these family members, which have been previously
reported for the human CES family members [16-24].
Human and opossum CES6 showed longer and distinct
N-terminal sequences which may reflect differences in
processing the signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum [12]. Functional charge clamps that perform key roles
in maintaining the trimeric-hexameric subunit structures
for human CES1 [33] were notably absent from human
CES2 and CES7, while opossum CES2.2, CES2.3 and
CES6, as well as human CES3 and CES6 had only one
charge clamp. These may contribute to differences in the
tertiary and quaternary structures for these enzymes, in
particular the monomeric subunit structure for human
and baboon CES2 [27] [RS Holmes, J Glenn, JL VandeBerg
& LA Cox: Baboon carboxylesterases 1 and 2: sequences,
structures and phylogenetic relationships with human
and other primate carboxylesterases, unpublished]. The
tetrapeptide C-terminal sequence (HIEL for human CES1)
which performs a key role of retaining CES1 within the
lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum [44] was also found
(with conservative substitutions) in human CES2 (HTEL)
and CES3 (QEDL), and in opossum CES1 (HIEL), CES2.2
and CES2.3 (both RMEL) but was notably absent from
opossum CES2.1 and from human CES6 and CES7 C-terminal sequences. It is likely that these enzymes have different subcellular distribution profiles as compared with
other CES gene products. As mentioned previously, the Nglycosylation site reported for human CES1 (79–81: NAT)
is retained for the opossum CES1 (NTT) and CES2.1
(NAT) sequences, but is absent from other opossum and
human CES gene products, whereas opossum CES1 (2),
CES2.1 (4), CES2.2 (1) and CES2.3 (1) have other potential glycosylation sites (Figure 3). Human CES3 (105AsnSer-Ser107), opossum CES6 (356Asn-Ser-Thr and
455Asn-Ile-Thr), human CES6 (37Asn-Pro-Ser, 318AsnVal-Thr, 380Asn-Ser-Thr and 465Asn-Ile-Thr); and human
CES7 (281Asn-Ala-Ser, 363Asn-Lys-Ser, 463Asn-Leu-Thr
and 473Asn-Met-Thr) sequences also exhibit other poten-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/54

tial glycosylation sites which may contribute to carbohydrate binding for these proteins.
Amino acid substitutions were observed for other key
regions reported for human CES1, including the Z-site
Gly354 (involved in cholesterol binding) [3], which was
retained for human and opossum CES2Like gene products and human CES7, but replaced in opossum CES1,
human CES3 and in opossum and human CES6
sequences; the human CES1 'side door' sequence at
423Val-Met-Phe425 (proposed to regulate fatty acid residue release following hydrolysis of fatty acyl ester linkages
[3]) and the 'aromatic-releasing' residue (the 'gate') at
551Phe have each undergone conservative substitutions
for the opossum and human CES sequences analyzed. The
impacts of these changes on the structures and functions
for these enzymes remain to be determined.
Locations for Opossum CES1, CES2 and CES6 'Like' Genes
on Chromosome 1
Opossum CES2.1 cDNA [GenBank:EU019537] was
cloned and sequenced. Using BLAT [38,39] to align the
cDNA sequence to the recently published genome [40]
revealed that the gene is localized on chromosome 1. The
identification of this gene as CES2.1 is based upon the
identity of the corresponding predicted protein with the
deduced amino acid sequence for opossum CES2.1 (Figure 2). The BLAT studies localized this gene on chromosome 1 at nucleotides 677,900,919–677,927,002 on the
negative strand with 99.9% identity (Table 1; Figure 3).
Two further CES2 'like' genes were identified on this chromosome at nucleotides 677,773,395–677,808,416
(CES2.2 gene) and 677,826,454–677,852,862 (CES2.3
gene), also on the negative strand. Consequently, all 3
CES2 like genes are localized within 155 kb of DNA on
chromosome 1 (Figure 3). The predicted proteins from
the genes (designated as CES2.2 and CES2.3) were highly
similar with each other (94% identical) and with opossum CES2.1 (~70% identical) (Table 2).

The human CES1 amino acid sequence was used for BLAT
interrogation of the opossum genome, generating an
opossum CES1 homologue gene and a predicted amino
acid sequence for this enzyme. The responsible gene
(CES1)
was
located
at
nucleotides
446,224,784–446,256,371 on chromosome 1 with a span
of 31588 nucleotides on the negative strand (Table 1; Figure 3). This protein was more similar with human CES1
(63% identity) than with human CES2 (46% identity)
(Table 2). Another study was conducted using human
CES6 for BLAT interrogation of the opossum genome and
evidence obtained for a region of sequence similarity,
located within 44 kb of the CES2.2 gene (Table 1; Figure
3). A predicted protein sequence for opossum CES6 was
obtained and compared with other opossum and human

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:54

CES gene product sequences in Figure 2. These results
strongly suggest that there are three CES2 'like' genes
which are 92 kb apart on opossum chromosome 1; a CES6
'like' gene, which is 44 kb closer to the pter region than the
CES2 gene complex; and a CES1 'like' gene, which is further upstream on chromosome one (Figure 3). The RTPCR studies reported earlier for opossum CES1, CES2,
CES2.2 and CES2.3 genes confirm the existence, expression and sequences for CES coding regions for these opossum genes.
Human CES3 and CES7 amino acid sequences were also
used to interrogate the opossum genome using the BLAT
method [38,39], however the results were inconclusive
and further molecular genetic analyses will be required to
establish the presence or otherwise of these CES genes on
the opossum genome.

Phylogeny and Divergence of Mammalian CES Sequences
A phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) was estimated using a progressive alignment of 6 human CES amino acid sequences
with the following opossum CES sequences: CES2.1
(derived from sequencing a full-length cDNA); CES1,
CES2.2 and CES2.3 (derived from BLAT interrogations of
the opossum genome and from sequencing cDNA clones
of RT-PCR products for these genes); and CES6 (derived
from blat interrogation of the opossum genome using
human CES6) [39,40]. We also included other vertebrate
CES homologues including chicken, frog and salmon, in
addition to two divergent fly sequences as outgroup
sequences.

The amino acid distance tree (Figure 4) shows a cluster of
five main groups consistent with CES1, CES2, CES3,
CES6, and CES7 gene families being products of ancestral
gene duplication events, and indicates that all families

arose prior to the divergence of therian mammals
~173–193 MYA [45-47]. This is consistent with a previous
report for mammalian CES genes [28] and also with other
studies that showed mammalian CES1, CES2 and CES7
are members of distinct but related gene families [2,7] [RS
Holmes, J Glenn, JL VandeBerg & LA Cox: Baboon carboxylesterases 1 and 2: sequences, structures and phylogenetic relationships with human and other primate
carboxylesterases, unpublished]. Phylogenetic trees based
on maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods produce
very similar results, with similarly high bootstrap and posterior probability support for the distinct CES clusters
observed in the distance tree (Fig. 4). No strong support
for early branching patterns emerged from any of the different phylogenetic analyses, suggesting the different gene
families arose during a short period of time.
Opossum CES1 is an member of the gene CES1 family
which has been previously shown to include other mammalian CES1 gene products from human, baboon, rat and
mouse, as well as human CES4 [2,27] [RS Holmes, J
Glenn, JL VandeBerg & LA Cox: Baboon carboxylesterases
1 and 2: sequences, structures and phylogenetic relationships with human and other primate carboxylesterases,
unpublished]. Opossum CES2.1, CES2.2 and CES2.3 gene
product sequences, however, show phylogenetic association within the eutherian CES2 group, which includes
multiple CES2-like genes from mouse and rat (mouse was
included as a representative of this lineage in our analyses) [48-51]. Eutherian CES3, CES6 and CES7 genes form
distinct lineages, each originating during the early, premammalian radiation of the CES gene family. Human
CES3 shares 46% identity with human and opossum
CES2 gene products (Figure 3 and Table 2). Human and
opossum CES6 and human CES7 share an average 40%
and 42% identity respectively, with other human and
opossum CES products (Table 2). Our inclusion and phylogenetic placement of chicken, frog and salmon
sequences (Fig. 4) is consistent with the view that the early
CES divergence events occurred during the early stages of
tetrapod evolution, but following divergence from bony
fishes, which diverged much earlier from the common
ancestor of all tetrapod CES sequences.
Estimates of Evolutionary Dates for CES Gene Duplication
Events
We estimated the times of divergence for the CES gene
family and its members using a relaxed clock approach
[52,53], an amino acid alignment, and three major calibration points: mouse-human, eutherian-marsupial, and
synapsid-diapsid divergence times estimated from the literature. Our results suggest that the earliest branching
events that produced the extant mammalian CES gene
families occurred between 378 and 328 MYA (Fig. 4).
Divergence dates for the earliest splits coincide with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/54

divergence time of tetrapods approximately 350–360
MYA based on both molecular and paloeontological data
[45,54,55] and are consistent with these events predating
the tetrapod divergence and post-dating the tetrapodbony fish split based on two observations: the placement
of chicken and frog CES sequences in different CES gene
families, and the early divergence of salmon CES-like
sequence from the tetrapod sequences (Fig. 4). Based on
these findings, it is proposed that several ancient CES gene
duplication events took place prior to the origin of mammals, generating five ancestral genes for CES1, CES2,
CES3, CES6 and CES7, which have all been retained over
the past 180–230 million years of mammalian evolution.
Subsequent gene duplications apparently took place prior
to (~114 MYA) and during (~8 MYA) the evolutionary
diversification of extant marsupials [55], generating three
CES2-like genes in the opossum genome, in contrast to a
single CES2 gene found in some eutherians.

Conclusion
We have conducted the first study of marsupial CES genes
using BLAT [38,39] interrogation of the recently published opossum genome sequence [40] and studied gene
expression by RT-PCR, and sequenced opossum CES1 and
CES2Like cDNAs. We found that opossum CES genes are
located in two regions on chromosome 1, with a CES1like
gene ~231 million bp upstream of a CES2/CES6 gene cluster, which comprises three CES2like genes (designated as
CES2.1, CES2.2 and CES2.3) and a CES6like gene. An
opossum CES2.1 cDNA was isolated and sequenced and
the predicted protein sequence shown to be more similar
to human CES2 among six human CES sequences previously reported. RT-PCR expression studies demonstrated
that the opossum CES1, CES2.2 and CES2.3 genes are
transcribed in opossum liver and intestine, whereas the
opossum CES2.1 gene was expressed in liver and not
intestine. Amino acid sequence alignments for these opossum gene products with human CES isozymes demonstrated considerable conservation of key residues involved
in catalysis, organelle localization, quaternary structure
and ligand binding, and retention of the α-β secondary
structures previously reported for human CES1
[3,15,29,30,43]. A phylogenetic study was conducted
using the opossum CES sequences and amino acid
sequences for other vertebrate CES isozymes. The pattern
and timing of the CES gene family radiation suggests that
a number of gene duplication events occurred prior to the
appearance of mammals [45,46], between 330–370 MYA
generating ancestral genes for CES1, CES2, CES3, CES6
and CES7 in the common ancestor of marsupial and eutherian mammals. Further gene duplications for CES2
occurred in the lineage leading to modern marsupials,
resulting in three CES2-like genes within a 154 kb region
on opossum chromosome 1.

Methods
Cloning and sequencing CES2 cDNA
A 421 bp opossum cDNA (GenBank: DR038241) which
exhibits similarity to CES of other species is in the public
database. To study opossum CES genes, primers were
designed using this DNA sequence to amplify a full-length
opossum CES cDNA from liver RNA by the RNA ligasemediated rapid amplification of 5' and 3' cDNA ends
(RACE) method [56]. The GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) was used for RACE according to the manufacturer's instructions. For 5' RACE, the GeneRacer 5'
primer from the kit and a gene-specific primer (5'-acccaccgaagggcagccacctgat-3') were used in the first round of
amplification, then the GeneRacer 5' nested primer from
the kit and a gene-specific nested primer (5'-gcctgacgcatactcatccccagtgct-3') were used in the second round of
amplification. For 3' RACE, one round of PCR with the
GeneRacer 3' primer from the kit and a gene-specific
primer (5'-tgtggccatccttcctggcatgctt-3') was sufficient to
obtain a RACE product. RACE PCR products were cloned
into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing was
performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and
nucleotide sequences were analyzed on an ABI Prism
3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
RT-PCR Expression Studies and Sequencing of RT-PCR
Products
Total RNA was isolated from livers and small intestines of
opossums using the TRI Reagent (Molecular Research
Center, Cincinnati, OH), and treated with DNase I from
the Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer's protocol to remove contaminating
DNA from the RNA preparations. DNase I-treated RNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).
Control RT-PCR reactions were conducted with DNasetreated liver and intestine RNA in the absence of reverse
transcriptase. Liver and intestinal cDNAs were used as
templates in RT-PCR to analyze expression of the predicted/cloned CES genes. Primers for the CES genes were
as follows. For the CES1 gene, the forward primer was 5'attcaggggaagcagtcctc-3' and the reverse primer was 5'tgccatgatgctggaattgt-3'. For the CES2.1 gene, the forward
primer was 5'-tgcctcgttgccaatctatctgcttgtg-3', and the
reverse primer was 5'-tcagtagtcatgatctcccaatag-3'. For the
CES2.2 gene, the forward primer was 5'-catttgtggctcagcttctgct-3' and the reverse primer was 5'-gggcaggaataacaaacatccag-3'. For the CES2.3 gene, the forward primer was 5'ttgtctgcatcccagaatgtgata-3' and the reverse primer was 5'gggcaggaatagcaaacatcaaa-3'. The CES2.2 and CES2.3
cDNAs are 97% identical to each other, therefore primers
were selected such that mismatch at the 3' end of primers
would allow only the target gene to be amplified. Primer
sets for the four CES genes span introns, and the size of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/54

PCR products and the absence of PCR products in the control studies demonstrates that they were not amplified
from genomic DNA.
In silico Studies of Opossum CES Genes
BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) in silico studies were
undertaken using the UC Santa Cruz web site with the
default settings (Assembly:2006; Query: BLAT's guess;
Sort Output: query score; Output type: hyperlink) [38,39].
Opossum CES2.2 and CES2.3 genomic alignments were
confirmed using Ensembl (Ensembl release 45,
MonDom5 assembly, June 2007) [57,58]. The following
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Database sequences were used to
interrogate the opossum genome sequence [38]: human
sequences CES1 (P23141), CES2 (O00748), CES3
(Q6UWW8), CES4 (Q8TDZ9); CES6 (Q6UX55) and
CES7 (Q96DN9) (Table 1); as well as the opossum CES2
sequence reported in this paper. Genome locations and
predicted protein sequences were obtained for each CES
sequence used and the results for those regions showing
high (>70%) levels of identity with the human CES gene
products or with opossum CES2.1 (full identity) were
examined and compared with opossum and human CES
sequences using the SIM-Alignment tool for Protein
Sequences [57,58] (see Table 1). Protein sequences were
generated in silico for opossum CES genes using the UC
Santa Cruz Genome Browser [38,39] and human CES1,
CES2 and CES6 sequences in BLAT analyses of the opossum genome. Sequences for opossum CES1, CES2.2 and
CES2.3 were aligned with the translated sequences for the
corresponding RT-PCR products to ensure identity in each
case.
Phylogenetic Studies and Sequence Divergence
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using an amino acid
alignment from a ClustalW-derived alignment of mammalian, chicken, frog, salmon CES protein sequences,
obtained with default settings [59,60]. Two fly (Drosophila
melanogaster) CES sequences were included as outgroups.
Alignment of ambiguous regions, including the amino
and carboxyl termini, were excluded prior to phylogenetic
analysis, yielding an alignment of 367 residues. Amino
acid distance trees were built in PHYLIP (v. 3.57) using
JTT+gamma corrected distances and the neighbor joining
algorithm [61]. Maximum parsimony trees were constructed in PAUP 4.0b [62] using heuristic searches (50
iterations with random addition of taxa). Bootstrap
results for each method were based on 100 iterations
under similar search criteria. A Bayesian analysis was performed in Mr.Bayes (vers. 3.1.2) [63] under the following
search criteria: two independent runs of 1 million generations, with 4 independent chains sampled every 100 generations, under a mixed amino acid model, with a burnin
set at 100,000 generations. The average standard deviation of split-frequencies between the two runs was <0.001.

Divergence dates were obtained with the programs ESTBRANCHES and MULTIDIVTIME [50,51], assuming the
NJ topology (Fig 4). The salmon CES sequence was
included to root the tree. Branch lengths and variancecovariance matrices were estimated assuming the JTT
model of amino acid replacement, and these branch
lengths were used to estimate divergence times in MULTIDIVTIME. We used the following calibration points: (1)
84 and 99 MYA for the minimum and maximum ages,
respectively, for each of the primate/rodent splits in Fig. 4
based on 95% confidence intervals of published molecular divergence estimates [64], (2) 173 and 193 MYA for
the minimum and maximum ages, respectively, of each
eutherian/metatherian split in Fig. 4 based on published
molecular divergence estimates [45-47], and (3) 300 and
320 MYA for the minimum and maximum ages, respectively, for the chicken/mammal CES1 divergence, based
on a conservative 20 MYA window surrounding the wellconstrained synapsid/diapsid split at 310 MYA [46]. The
prior for the root was set at 360 MYA, on the basis of previous paleoontological and molecular estimates for the
age of tetrapods [46,54].
