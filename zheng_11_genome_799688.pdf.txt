Abstract
Background: Species in the ascomycete fungal genus Cordyceps have been proposed to be the teleomorphs of
Metarhizium species. The latter have been widely used as insect biocontrol agents. Cordyceps species are highly
prized for use in traditional Chinese medicines, but the genes responsible for biosynthesis of bioactive
components, insect pathogenicity and the control of sexuality and fruiting have not been determined.
Results: Here, we report the genome sequence of the type species Cordyceps militaris. Phylogenomic analysis
suggests that different species in the Cordyceps/Metarhizium genera have evolved into insect pathogens
independently of each other, and that their similar large secretomes and gene family expansions are due to
convergent evolution. However, relative to other fungi, including Metarhizium spp., many protein families are
reduced in C. militaris, which suggests a more restricted ecology. Consistent with its long track record of safe
usage as a medicine, the Cordyceps genome does not contain genes for known human mycotoxins. We establish
that C. militaris is sexually heterothallic but, very unusually, fruiting can occur without an opposite mating-type
partner. Transcriptional profiling indicates that fruiting involves induction of the Zn2Cys6-type transcription factors
and MAPK pathway; unlike other fungi, however, the PKA pathway is not activated.
Conclusions: The data offer a better understanding of Cordyceps biology and will facilitate the exploitation of
medicinal compounds produced by the fungus.

Background
The Ascomycete genus Cordyceps includes over 500
species that are pathogens of arthropods. Cordyceps
militaris (CCM) is the type species and occurs throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere as a pathogen of
lepidopteran insect pupae [1]. C. militaris is readily
characterized by the sexual fruiting bodies forming on
mycosed pupae, the structures giving the fungus its
common name of ‘pupa grass’ in China. Anamorphic
Cordyceps species, such as Beauveria spp., Metarhizium
spp. and Paecilomyces spp., have been developed as

insect biocontrol agents [2,3]. Although C. militaris and
Cordyceps sinensis (syn. Ophiocordyceps sinensis) are
best known as traditional Chinese medicines, they are
also increasingly being studied and used in the West
[4,5]. An array of pharmacologically active components
has been identified, including cordycepin, cordycepic
acids, polysaccharides and macrolides [6]. Cordycepin
(3’-deoxyadenosine) has so far only been reported in C.
militaris and is a broad spectrum antimicrobial [5] and
polyadenylation inhibitor that is currently undergoing
clinical trials against cancers [7]. The biosynthetic pathway of cordycepin production has not been determined.
In spite of their market values - for example, >
$10,000 per kilo for the fruiting bodies of the un-cultivatable C. sinensis [8] - very little is known about sex
and developmental processes in Cordyceps species, and
remedying this deficiency should help in production/

cultivation of these enigmatic fungi. C. militaris is notable as it readily performs sexual reproduction on artificial media and is thus a good target for studying the
molecular underpinnings of sex and development in
Cordyceps spp. (Figure 1). C. militaris also has the
potential to be a versatile new model for studying the
evolution of sex and reproductive structures. While current fungal models have provided numerous insights
into the evolution of sex [9], there is still much to be
understood about the mechanisms, evolution and ecological impact of sexuality in fungi. This is, in part,
because fungal mating and sexual cycles are often complicated; for example, aspergilli have both self-fertile
(homothallism) and self-sterile (heterothallism) mating
systems [10].
There is also much to be learnt about the nature and
evolution of interactions of Cordyceps spp. with their
hosts and with the wider environment. As entomopathogenicity appears to have evolved independently in
Cordyceps and two Metarhizium species [11], comparative genomics will provide independent assessments of
what is required to be entomopathogenic, identify the
degree to which evolution between these fungi has
been convergent, and identify the genomic basis of
their differing physiologies and host-specificity. Last
but not least, genomic sequencing of C. militaris will
enable a systematic exploration of the biology and

pharmaceuticals underlying the widespread medical
impact of Cordyceps spp., and identify potential safety
hazards, including genes for known human mycotoxins.

Results
Genome sequencing and general features

The C. militaris genome was shotgun sequenced to 147
× coverage and assembled into 33 scaffolds with an N50
of 4.6 Mb and a total genome size of 32.2 Mb. The genome is smaller than either the broad host range Metarhizium anisopliae (MAA) or the locust-specific
pathogen Metarhizium acridum (MAC) that we
sequenced previously (Table 1). The characteristic telomeric repeats (TTAGGG/CCCTAA) n were found at
either 5’ or 3’ terminal of 13 scaffolds, including the
terminal anchoring of two scaffolds, that is, the complete chromosomes. From mapping > 5,000 expressed
sequence tags [12], the C. militaris genome was estimated to be > 99% complete. The genome was predicted
to encode 9,684 protein genes, which is slightly fewer
than M. anisopliae and M. acridum (Table 1). Consequently, many protein functional categories are smaller
in Cordyceps than in Metarhizium spp. (Figure 2a).
However, like M. anisopliae (17.6%) and M. acridum
(15.1%), C. militaris has a higher proportion of its genes
encoding putatively secreted proteins (15.9%) than other
sequenced ascomycetes (5 to 10%) [10,13,14].

Figure 1 Life cycle and phenotypic polymorphism of C. militaris. The round conidia (from a solid culture) or the bar shaped blastospores
(from a liquid culture) were inoculated onto caterpillar pupa or rice medium and incubated for up to 60 days. The resulting fertile fruiting
bodies have protruded perithecia that contain asci. The ejected linear ascospores fragment and germinate to produce secondary pear-shaped
conidia under nutrient poor conditions, that is, micro-cycle conidiation. Both the ascospores and secondary conidia can infect caterpillars. Scale
bar: 5 μl.

An InterproScan analysis identified 2,736 conserved
protein families in C. militaris (containing 6,725 proteins), fewer than those in M. anisopliae (7,556 proteins
in 2,796 families) or M. acridum (6,948 proteins in
2,746 families) [11]. In particular, the number of transposases is much fewer in C. militaris (4) than in Metarhizium spp. (148 in M. anisopliae and 20 in M.
acridum) or other sequenced ascomycetes (15 to 426)
(Table S1 in Additional file 1). The C. militaris genome
lacks retrotransposase (Table S2 in Additional file 1),
and has more than three-fold fewer pseudogenes than
Metarhizium spp. (Table S3 in Additional file 1). About
16% of the predicted C. militaris genes (1,547) are putatively involved in pathogen-host interactions; this proportion is slightly lower than for Metarhizium spp.
(17.3% in MAA and 16.5% in MAC) but is higher than
four plant pathogens (10.8 to 15.5%; P = 0.0476; false
discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0152) (Table S4 in Additional
file 1).
More than 50% of M. anisopliae and M. acridum proteins have > 90% identity [11]. Although the rarely
observed sexual stages of Metarhizium spp. have been
identified as a Cordyceps species [1], the analysis
revealed that < 2% of C. militaris genes were highly conserved in comparison with those from Metarhizium
spp., that is, had Blast score ratio (BSR) values close to
1 (Figure 3a). A similar pattern was observed when
comparing C. militaris, M. anisopliae and the plant
pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Figure 3b). Comparative genomic analysis of the three insect pathogens
found that the percentage of species-specific genes is
much higher in C. militaris (13.7%) compared to M.
anisopliae (4.8%) and M. acridum (3.5%) (Figure 2b).
Based on the identities between orthologous proteins, C.
militaris displays an average of approximately 63%

amino acid identity with either M. anisopliae or M. acridum, slightly higher than with the plant pathogens F.
graminearum (61.6%) and Magnaporthe oryzae (56.0%)
(Table 2). Thus, the three insect pathogenic fungi are
more highly diverged than F. graminearum, Fusarium
oxysporum and Fusarium verticillioides, which share an
average of 85% nucleotide sequence identity [14], and
Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus oryzae, which share an average of 68% amino acid
sequence identity [13], and Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma virens and Trichoderma atroviride, which share
an average of > 70% amino acid sequence identity [15].
The regions containing at least three contiguous open
reading frames that are not present in the reference genome are designated as genomic islands (GIs) [16].
Whole genome reciprocal analysis of three insect pathogens demonstrated that, in comparison to Metarhizium
spp., C. militaris has 52 GIs (2% coverage of its genome,
harboring 21% of its species-specific genes), which is
many more than M. anisopliae (8 GIs, 0.3%) or M. acridum (5 GIs, 0.2%) when referenced to C. militaris. As
in aspergilli [17], many C. militaris species-specific
gene-encoding proteins do not have conserved domains
and the genes are clustered together to form GIs (Table
2). A phylogenomic analysis established that the Cordyceps lineage is more closely related to the wheat pathogen F. graminearum (divergence time of 200 to 260
million years ago (MYA)) than it is to Metarhizium spp.
(26 to 34 MYA) (Figure 3c). Thus, the lineage leading to
C. militaris appears to have diverged from plant pathogens around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (200 MYA),
while M. anisopliae and M. acridum diverged after the
Cretaceous Extinction Event (65 MYA) [18]. Analysis of
paralogous genes found only one pair of C. militaris
genes with > 90% nucleotide sequence similarities (Figure 3d), which is similar to Neurospora crassa (one pair)
[13] and F. graminearum (two pairs) [19]. Analysis of 24
paired C. militaris genes showing > 70% nucleotide
identities found a strong overall C:G to T:A mutation
bias (Figure S1 in Additional file 2), consistent with
repeat-induced point mutations, the DNA methylationlinked processes that cause mutations of repeated fungal
sequences [15,20].
Protein family analysis

We identified gene family expansions for proteases, chitinases, lipases and protein kinases in C. militaris when
compared with phytopathogenic fungi, whereas gene
family contractions occurred for glycoside hydrolases
(GHs; P = 0.0144; FDR = 0.02), cutinases (P = 0.0065;
FDR = 0.0226) and pectin lyases (P = 0.0245; FDR =
0.0284) (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The largest
family expansions were for proteases. The C. militaris
genome contains 61 families of proteases but most of

them were included in families of serine proteases (180/
381) and metallopeptidases (108/381) (Table S5 in Additional file 1). Gene expansions within the subtilisin (P =
0.0109; FDR = 0.0189) and trypsin (P = 0.0077; FDR =
0.0178) families are consistent with their being virulence
factors in insect pathogens [11]. However, different
families of proteases are expanded in Metarhizium spp.
and C. militaris, consistent with each lineage ‘reinventing the wheel’ during the evolution of entomopathogenicity. Thus, relative to Metarhizium spp., the S01 trypsin
and S08 subtilisin subfamilies are smaller and the S53
subfamily is larger (Table S6 in Additional file 1). The
C. militaris genome has 12 trypsin genes compared to 4
or less in plant pathogens. It lacks four subfamilies of
trypsins present in M. anisopliae. Interestingly, the

bacterial-like chymotrypsin identified in M. anisopliae
[21] is absent in M. acridum [11] but present as two
copies in C. militaris. The A01 aspartyl proteases are
virulence factors of both mammalian and plant pathogens because of their ability to cleave an array of host
proteins [22]. Compared to phytopathogenic fungi (average 17), their number is significantly (P = 0.0059; FDR =
0.0057) expanded in the three insect pathogens (average
24) (Table S4 in Additional file 1).
Compared to many plant pathogens, Metarhizium spp.
and C. militaris have fewer cutinases for degrading plant
cell walls (Table S1 in Additional file 1). They also have
fewer (average 137, P < 0.05) GHs than plant pathogens
(average 199), including the lack of 20 GH families used
by most plant pathogens and saprobes to target plant

cell walls - for example, GH6, GH7 and GH61 cellulases, GH10 and GH11 xylanases, GH28 pectinases and
GH78 rhamnosidases (Table S7 in Additional file 1).
There are also significant differences in the spectrum of
enzymes produced by the entomopathogens. For example, compared to M. anisopliae, C. militaris has few
xyloglucosyl transferases (GH16) for xyloglucan catabolism and lacks a-glucuronidases (GH115) active on
xylan oligomers or polymeric xylan [23]. Consistent with
this, C. militaris grows very poorly on xylose when compared with M. anisopliae (Figure S2 in Additional file 2).
A phosphoketolase MPK1 involved in pentose metabolism is required for full virulence of M. anisopliae [24],
but the homolog is absent in C. militaris. However,
GH18 chitinases similar to those used by Metarhizium
to degrade insect cuticles [11] are well represented in
the C. militaris genome (20 in CCM versus 30 in MAA
and 19 in MAC) relative to plant pathogens (average 11)
(Table S7 in Additional file 1).
Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) play essential roles in fungal physiologies, including detoxification, degradation of

xenobiotics and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites [25]. C. militaris has only about half as many CYPs
as Metarhizium spp., and most other fungi (Table S8 in
Additional file 1). Seventy CYP subfamilies present in
M. anisopliae and/or M. acridum are absent in C. militaris. Of particular interest, C. militaris lacks CYP55,
CYP58 and CYP65. CYP55 is a nitric oxide reductase
required for denitrification [25]. Thus, unlike most filamentous fungi, C. militaris may not respond to hypoxia
through the bacterial ammonia fermentation mechanism. The absence of CYP58 (trichodiene oxygenase) and
CYP65 (trichothecene C-15 hydroxylase) suggests that
C. militaris will not produce the mycotoxin trichothecene [26]. M. anisopliae can efficiently metabolize insect
epicuticle alkanes [27]. The CYP52 subfamily for alkane
hydroxylation [25] is well represented in Cordyceps.
The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporters are the two biggest
families of fungal transporters. Members of the former
typically function as nutrient symporters and drug antiporters, whereas the latter are more often implicated in

Zheng et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R116
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/11/R116

defense against toxic metabolites [28]. C. militaris has
approximately half (123) the number of these transporters as Metarhizium (269 in MAA and 236 in MAC)
(Table S9 in Additional file 1). The MFS transporters
that are underrepresented in Cordyceps include the carbohydrate symporters (37 in CCM versus 48 in MAA,
51 in MAC and an average of 58 in plant pathogens),
vitamin B2 (riboflavin) transporters (2 in CCM versus
17 each in Metarhizium species and an average of 4 in
plant pathogens) and multidrug antiporters (23 in CCM
versus 110 in MAA, 77 in MAC and an average of 10 in
plant pathogens). Consistent with their having many
multidrug transporters, Metarhizium spp. are resistant
to diverse antibiotics and fungicides [29]. Cordyceps has
more ABC-type drug and metal resistant proteins than
Metarhizium and plant pathogens (63 in CCM, 56 in
MAA, 51 in MAC and an average of 54 in plant pathogens). The amino acid and dipeptide transporters are
similarly represented in the three insect pathogens and
other fungi (46 in CCM versus 53 in MAA, 49 in MAC
and an average of 45 in plant pathogens).
Fungal G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are
required for pheromone/nutrient sensing and host
recognition [11]. Thus, the Pth11-like GPCR of Magnaporthe mediates cell differentiation in responses to plant
inductive cues [30]. C. militaris has fewer GPCRs than
Metarhizium spp. and is particularly impoverished in
Pth11-like GPCRs (Table S10 in Additional file 1). C.
militaris has a similar number (167) of protein kinases
as M. anisopliae (161) but less than M. acridum (192)
(Table S11 in Additional file 1). Like other fungi, fungal
specific transcription factors (TFs) and zinc finger TFs
represent the two largest classes of TFs in C. militaris
and their numbers are similar to those of other fungi
(Table S1 in Additional file 1).
Mating-type and sexuality analysis

The fruiting bodies of Cordyceps spp. are the most commonly sold traditional Chinese medicine products [5].
However, the sexual cycle and fruiting of C. militaris is
poorly understood. We only identified a MAT1-1 mating-type locus, including MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-2
genes, in the sequenced Cm01 strain, suggesting that C.
militaris is heterothallic (Figure 4a). A single matingtype locus was also found in M. anisopliae (MAT1-1)
and M. acridum (MAT1-2). Like aspergilli [10], the idiomorphic regions of the three insect pathogens are highly
divergent (Figure 4a). The MAT1-1 locus of M. anisopliae contains a MAT1-1-3 gene but lacks the MAT1-12 gene present in C. militaris. Except for the matingtype locus region, most A. nidulans and N. crassa genes
involved in mating, fruiting, karyogamy and meiosis are
also present in insect pathogens (Table S12 in Additional file 1).

Page 7 of 21

Strain Cm01 forms fruiting bodies on caterpillar
pupae that lack perithecia and ascospores (Figure 5a-e).
Thus, it is the first ascomycete species reported to fruit
without an opposite mating-type partner. Other C. militaris isolates could also fruit sterilely with a single mating-type locus (Figure 6a, b). However, a hybrid strain,
Cm06, with both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 loci produced
sexual perithecia and ascospores (Figure 5f, g). In addition, the sexual structures could be similarly re-formed
after inoculation of the caterpillar pupae with different
ratios of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 isolate conidia (Figure
6c-e), confirming that C. militaris is heterothallic. PCR
examination of 18 field-collected strains identified three
containing both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 loci (Figure 5h).
However, 28 out of 30 single spore isolates of the Cm06
strain belonged to the MAT1-1 mating-type (Figure 5i).
A similar unequal prevalence of mating types occurs in
the dermatophyte fungus [31].
Metabolism of medically active components and
mycotoxins

One of the main pharmaceutically active components of
C. militaris is cordycepin [5,6], which is structurally
similar to 2’-deoxyadenosine (Figure 7a). C. militaris
possesses most of the genes required for metabolism of
adenine and adenosine except for lacking a ribonucleotide trisphosphate reductase (RNR; converts ATP to
dATP) and a deoxyadenosine kinase (converts deoxyadenosine to dAMP) (Figure 7b; Table S13 in Additional
file 1). It has been suggested that the biosynthesis of
cordycepin proceeds through a reductive mechanism as
described for the formation of 2’-deoxyadenosine [32].
However, C. militaris resembles Metarhizium and other
cordycepin non-producing fungi in having only two
highly conserved subunits of class I RNRs (Figure S3 in
Additional file 2). The substrates for class I RNRs are
ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP but not TDP or nucleosides,
and as the reductive reaction proceeds via a free radical
mechanism [33], C. militaris RNRs will not be involved
in cordycepin production.
Contamination of food and feed by mycotoxins is a
longstanding threat to the health of humans and animals
[26]. C. militaris has been consumed for hundreds of
years, implying safety, but the genome data allowed us
to make the first comprehensive inventory of Cordyceps
genes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites
for comparison with known mycotoxins. There are
fewer secondary metabolite core genes in C. militaris
relative to Metarhizium spp. or plant pathogens (Table
3). In comparison to Metarhizium spp., Cordyceps has
fewer terpenoid synthases, polyketide synthases (PKSs)
and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Phylogenetic analysis of Cordyceps PKS and PKS-like genes
using the ketoacyl CoA synthase (KS) domain sequences

found that the C. militaris proteins grouped into different clusters compared to PKSs for known mycotoxins
(Figure 8a). In addition, modular analysis indicated that,
except for CCM_00603, which has a similar domain
organization to the Aspergillus clavatus PatK gene for
patulin biosynthesis, C. militaris PKSs are structurally

different from mycotoxin PKSs (Figure 8b). The further
survey showed that the CCM_00603 protein has only
27% identity with PatK and the gene cluster for patulin
biosynthesis is absent in C. militaris (Table S14 in Additional file 1). This suggests that C. militaris PKSs do not
produce patulin or other known human mycotoxins.

Core genes encoding: DMAT, dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase; TC, terpenoid
cyclase; TS, terpenoid synthase; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; GGPS, geranylgeranyl
diphosphate synthase; NRPS, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase; PKS,

MO, M. oryzae; BC, Botrytis cinerea; SS, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; NC, N. crassa;
AN, A. nidulans.

Similarly, phylogenetic and modular analyses indicated
that Cordyceps NRPSs had different protein structures
than any NRPSs involved in production of known mycotoxins like enniatin, HC-toxin and gliotoxin (Figure S4
in Additional file 2).
The mycotoxin ergot alkaloids have a wide range of
biological activities and are important in pharmaceuticals and agriculture [26]. Dimethylallyl tryptophan
synthase (DMAT) catalyzes the alkylation of L-tryptophan, the first committed step in the ergot alkaloid biosynthetic pathway [34]. C. militaris has one putative
DMAT gene (CCM_04410), in contrast to five in M.
anisopliae and three in M. acridum (Table 3). A phylogenetic analysis showed that CCM_04410 is not clustered with the Claviceps DMAT clade involved in ergot
alkaloid production (Figure S5 in Additional file 2). The
trichothecenes T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (type B trichothecene) are natural fungal products that are toxic to
both animals and plants [35]. Consistent with lacking
CYP58 and CYP65, the C. militaris genome also lacks
trichodiene synthase (Table S15 in Additional file 1).
Thus, unlike Fusarium [26], C. militaris is not predicted
to produce trichothecene mycotoxins. The presence of
terpenoid cyclase, terpenoid synthase, fatty-acid synthase
and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase genes in the C.
militaris genome suggests that the fungus is capable of
producing an array of metabolites, but the identity of
these and their biological activities remain to be
determined.
Transcriptional regulation of fruiting body development

To identify genes associated with C. militaris fruiting
body development, we compared the expression profiles

of undifferentiated mycelia from Sabouraud dextrose
broth (SDB) culture with developmental stages on caterpillar pupae defined as nascent (14 days, termed as sample FB1), stalk formation (29 days, FB2) and mature
fruiting bodies (59 days, FB3) (Figure 5a-c). Of the 9,684
genes, more than 63% were expressed during both
undifferentiated hyphal growth and formation of fruiting
bodies (Table S16 in Additional file 1). Relative to the
growth in SDB, more than 900 genes were significantly
(P < 0.05; FDR < 0.001) up-regulated while around
2,000 genes were down-regulated during fungal fruiting
(Figure 9a). A Pearson correlation analysis indicated that
transcriptional profiles at the different stages of fruiting
body formation more closely resembled each other than
they resembled the transcriptomes of undifferentiated
mycelia (Figure S6a in Additional file 2). This is consistent with a Venn diagram analysis of the commonest
co-expressed genes between different samples (Figure
S6b in Additional file 2). Of the 100 most highly
expressed genes in developing C. militaris fruiting
bodies, 26 (FB1), 31 (FB2) and 37 (FB3) are functionally
uncharacterized (Table S17 in Additional file 1). This
suggests that the genes with unknown function are
more likely to be stringently regulated and involved in
developmental processes than orthologs of genes with
known function. These genes are thereby the targets for
future functional studies. In general, the genes involved
in cell wall structure and biogenesis, detoxification, protein degradation and amino acid transportation were
significantly up-regulated during formation of fruiting
structures. In contrast, most of the genes specifically upregulated by undifferentiated SDB cultures were
involved in rapid growth and carbohydrate metabolism.
Concomitant with fruiting structure maturation, the
genes for cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle and secondary metabolism were up-regulated.
Unlike other fungi, C. militaris can fruit sterilely in
the absence of a sexual partner (Figure 5a-c). Perhaps
because of this, 31 of the 42 C. militaris orthologs of
sex-related genes identified in other ascomycetes were
not expressed or transcribed at low levels (< 10 transcripts per million tags (TPM)) in sterile fruiting bodies
(Table S18 in Additional file 1). However, in some
cases, C. militaris expresses paralogous genes to those
employed by other fungi, suggesting they have co-opted
different components of the same signal transduction
pathways to fulfill similar functions. For example,
GATA-type TFs are important for fruiting in both A.
nidulans and N. crassa [36], but C. militaris fruiting
structures expressed orthologs of these genes at very
low levels or not at all (Table S19 in Additional file 1).
In contrast, the Zn2Cys6-type TFs were highly transcribed during fruiting but not in undifferentiated fungal
mycelia - for example, CCM_01809 and CCM_09644

(Figure 9b) - indicating that Zn2Cys6 type TFs are predominately involved in the major developmental switch
of production of fruiting structures.
Pheromone receptors, that is, GPCRs, control fungal
fruiting body formation and sexual cycle but not vegetative growth [36]. The pheromone receptor of C. militaris has not been identified. In comparison to
undifferentiated mycelial growth, a putative pheromone
receptor (CCM_01499) and a Pth11-like GPCR
(CCM_03015) were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05,
FDR < 0.001), respectively, during initiation of fruiting
body formation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) genes are required for fruiting in Aspergillus
(AN1017) and Neurospora (NC02393) [36], but

orthologous genes were not transcribed (CCM_04200
versus AN1017) or transcribed at low levels
(CCM_01235 versus NCU02393) by C. militaris (Table
S19 in Additional file 1). However, Cordyceps sharply
up-regulated (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.001) a MAPK paralog
(CCM_09637) as well as a calcium regulated kinase
(CaMK, CCM_06085) (Figure 9c). These data, taken in
conjunction with the single adenylate cyclase
(CCM_06928) not being transcribed and the low level
expression of both protein kinase A (PKA; CCM_03352)
and Rap GTPase (CCM_01391), indicate that fruiting by
C. militaris in the absence of a partner is more dependent on the MAPK pathway than the cAMP-dependent
PKA pathway (Figure 10).

Discussion
We report here the first genome analysis of a Cordyceps
species, the medicinal lepidopteran pathogen C. militaris, and show that the fungus is capable of fruiting
without an opposite mating-type partner. We also show
that it lacks genes known to be involved in production
of human mycotoxins. Being an insect pathogen, the C.
militaris genome contains thousands of genes putatively

involved in interactions with insect hosts. Cordyceps
resembles Metarhizium spp. in having a very high percentage of secreted proteins relative to plant pathogens
and saprophytes and expanded families of proteases and
chitinases with targets in insect hosts. However, insectkilling strategies may differ between Cordyceps and
Metarhizium due to differences in gene content. Mating-type analysis indicated that sexual reproduction in

C. militaris is heterothallic. Transcriptional profiling
indicated that fruiting of the MAT1-1 C. militaris strain
involves induction of the MAPK pathway, but unlike
other homothallic or heterothallic fungi, the PKA pathway was not up-regulated. It remains to be determined
whether this reflects the very unusual ability of C. militaris to produce fruiting bodies without an opposite
mating-type partner.
Aside from knowing that C. militaris infects lepidopteran pupae [37], the life cycle of C. militaris in nature
is poorly understood [8]. Following disease, survival in
soil may depend on the sexual stage of Cordyceps providing resilient long-lived ascospores as described in
other fungi [38]. Micro-cycle conidiation from germinated ascospores could adapt the fungus to nutrient
poor niches (Figure 1). Metarhizium does not produce
ascospores but flourishes in plant rhizospheres, which
thus provide an alternative habitat in the absence of
insect hosts. C. militaris can grow on germinated soybeans [39], suggesting a potential for an association with
plants. However, relative to Metarhizium and most
other ascomycetes, many protein families are smaller in
the C. militaris genome, especially serine proteases,
GHs, CYPs, MFS transporters and signal transduction
factors. These families would be involved in scavenging
for nutrients, avoidance of host defenses and toxins and
other processes related to pathogenicity and a saprobic
lifestyle. Around two-thirds of these protein families
include pathogen-host interaction genes in plant-associated fungi (Table S4 in Additional file 1). Further studies on the ecology of Cordyceps spp. will shed more
light on the relevance of the C. militaris genome to the
evolution of gene families in relation to acquisition/loss
of capability for dual plant/insect colonization and host
range specialization.
The phylogenomic analysis demonstrated that the
lineage leading to Cordyceps spp. diverged after most
well known plant pathogens, including F. graminearum,
but 130 MYA before Metarhizium diverged from the
grass endophyte Epichloë festucae. The estimate of a
Triassic-Jurassic boundary origin for the Cordyceps lineage and the post-Cretaceous origin of Metarhizium spp.
is consistent with the hypocrealean fungi of Cordycipitaceae (includes Cordyceps spp.), Clavicipitaceae (includes
Metarhizium spp.) and Ophiocordycipitaceae splitting
about the same time as insects and angiosperms were
diversifying [40]. Families of proteases and chitinases are
not expanded or lost in the E. festucae genome as they
are in Cordyceps and Metarhizium, exemplifying convergent evolution to insect pathogenicity. Besides proteases
and chitinases, experimentally verified Metarhizium
virulence-associated genes with homologs in the C. militaris genome include a perilipin-like protein
(CCM_06103 versus MAA_08819) to control cellular

Page 16 of 21

lipid storage and appressorium penetration [41], and an
osmosensor (CCM_04885 versus MAA_01551) to mediate adaptation to the insect hemocoel [42]. Homologs
of these genes are broadly distributed among ascomycetes, indicative of an ancient origin. However, Cordyceps lacks other Metarhizium pathogenicity-related
genes, including a collagen-like protein to evade the
host immune system [43], a phosphoketolase for pentose
metabolism [24] and the adhesins to mediate spore
adhesions to insect and plant surfaces [44]. The absence
of key components of the Metarhizium entomopathogenicity ‘toolkit’ from C. militaris indicates that it has
evolved different determinants to mediate its interactions with insects.
Like N. crassa and F. graminearum, C. miltaris lacks
highly similar paralogs, a hallmark of the repeat-induced
point mutation (RIP) mechanism [20]. C. militaris has
an ortholog (CCM_03609) of the N. crassa RIP defective
gene (NCU02034), a cytosine methyltranserase essential
for RIP [45]. The high C®T and G®A mutation bias in
the C. militaris genome and the readiness of C. miltaris
to undergo the sexual cycle suggests that RIP is commonplace in C. militaris like many ascomycetes
[10,15,19]. Since RIP can function effectively against
selfish DNAs [46], it likely contributes, at least in part,
to C. militaris having few DNA type transposon
encoded genes, that is, transposases [15].
There are many more orphan genes in Cordyceps than
in Metarhizium spp., underscoring that much about the
proteome of Cordyceps spp. remains unknown. It is
speculated that orphan genes arise from gene duplication, shuffling of gene fragments, mobile element
effects, mutation of existing sequences, horizontal gene
transfer and de novo origination from non-coding
DNAs [47]. De novo creation of new genes is probably
rare [48]. A role for mobile element effects is also unlikely given how few putative transposase genes are present in the C. militaris genome. Putative horizontal
gene transfer genes are even fewer in Cordyceps than in
Metarhizium. Thus, the numerous orphans in the C.
militaris genome most likely arose from frequent mutations caused by RIP in existing (duplicated) sequences.
Just as the Metarhizium-specific collagen-like protein is
essentially required to camouflage cells from host
immune recognition [43]. The transcriptome data
showed that 428 of the 1,329 orphan genes were transcribed during fruiting. Of the 100 most highly
expressed genes in developing C. militaris fruiting
bodies, about one-third are orphans (Table S17 in Additional file 1), underscoring the potential of orphans to
have specific functions. Likewise, genes that are apparently unique to the mushroom Schizophyllum commune
are more likely to be expressed during mushroom formation [49].

Zheng et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R116
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/11/R116

Concern has been raised about the possibility of
harmful side effects of traditional Chinese medicines,
including Cordyceps [50]. Consistent with genotoxicity
and cytotoxicity assays that show Cordyceps products to
be safe for consumption [51], there is no evidence in
the C. militaris genome for genes involved in the production of known mycotoxins. However, safety could
only be completely verified by meticulous profiling of
the metabolites produced by the fungus under diverse
growth conditions. The C. militaris genome data will
facilitate these processes as well as help with elucidation
of the biosynthetic pathways of different metabolites.
The analysis of C. militaris genome indicates that it is
sexually heterothallic, but strikingly, both the MAT1-1
single mating-type and MAT1-1/MAT1-2 hybrid strains
can form fruiting bodies, which means that C. militaris
is capable of fruiting without a partner. Single matingtype (haploid) fruiting has also been observed in the
human pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans [52]. Given that perithecia and ascospores
are not produced by MAT1-1 fruiting bodies, C. militaris haploid fruiting is different from the same-sex mating and fruiting of C. neoformans, in which
diploidization and meiosis can occur. In budding yeast,
meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of
double-strand breaks catalyzed by SPO11, a meiosis-specific endonuclease [53]. The meiosis-specific recombinase DMC1 and the DNA repair enzyme RAD51 then
co-localize to double-strand breaks and function
together for meiotic recombination [54]. The C. militaris homologue of yeast SPO11 (CCM_09527) was upregulated more than five-fold during fruiting body
maturation (the TPM ratio of FB2/FB1 = 8.1; FB3/FB2 =
5.7). Intriguingly, the C. militaris genome lacks a yeast
RAD51 ortholog, but its DMC1 ortholog (CCM_06822)
contains a RAD51 domain. CCM_06822 was not
expressed by C. militaris during fruiting, which may
explain why the C. militaris MAT1-1 strain forms fruiting bodies without meiosis. Consistent with this, a putative cyclin dependent kinase 7 (CDK7; CCM_03900) was
up-regulated during fungal fruiting (Table S19 in Additional file 1). Orthologs of CDK7 initiate DNA synthesis
and facilitate mitosis instead of meiosis [55].

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report on the genome sequencing,
comparative genome analysis and transcriptional regulation of fruiting body development in the medicinal fungus C. militaris. The sequence data should markedly
enhance the pace of molecular research on Cordyceps
biology, fungal sex and pathogenicity, and will have
impacts on the commercial production of fruiting structures. The genomic sequence will also be an essential
tool to unravel the mechanisms by which C. militaris

Page 17 of 21

produces medicinal compounds and so further their
exploitation.

Materials and methods
Fungal strains

C. militaris strain Cm01 (CGMCC 3.14242) was selected
for genome sequencing as it is culturally stable and
commercialized in China. The culture was maintained
either on artificial medium or silkworm pupae as previously described [12]. Several different C. militaris
strains were included in this study for PCR genotyping
of mating-type genes (Figure 5h).
Genome sequencing and assembly

The genome of C. militaris strain Cm01 was shotgun
sequenced using a Roche 454 GS FLX system for massively parallel pyrosequencing for 2.25 runs at the Chinese National Human Genome Center (Shanghai,
China). This resulted in 951 Mb of sequence data (29.6
× coverage) with an average read length of 385 bp.
Assembly was performed using the Newbler software
(v2.3) within the Roche 454 suite package [56], which
produced 597 contigs with a total size of 32.2 Mb. For
sequence scaffolding, a DNA library of 2- to 5-kb inserts
was generated and sequenced with an ABI SOLiD system (Carlsbad, California, USA). This resulted in 3.8 Gb
of mate-pair reads (117.4 × coverage) to improve
sequence quality and construct scaffolds. By mapping
the reads to contigs, 578 contigs were assembled into 13
scaffolds and 19 contigs less than 2 kb left outside. The
raw data of 454 and SOLiD reads have been deposited
at NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRA047932 and the whole project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession number
AEVU00000000.
Annotation

To maximize gene prediction accuracy, the gene structures of Cordyceps were predicted with a combination of
different algorithms plus manual inspections [11,57].
The inconsistent open reading frames were individually
subject to Blast searches against the NCBI curated
refseq_protein database. The prediction with the best hit
was selected. Pseudogene identification was conducted
with the pipeline of PseudoPipe with default settings
[58]. The potential secreted proteins of C. militaris and
other fungal species included for comparison were predicted by SignaIP 3.0 analysis using a hidden Markov
model [59]. Genome repetitive elements were analyzed
by Blast against the RepeatMasker library (Open 3.2.9)
[60] and with the Tandem Repeats Finder [61]. The
transposases/retrotransposases were classified by Blastp
analysis against the Repbase [62] plus manual
inspections.

Zheng et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R116
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/11/R116

Blast score ratio test

BSR tests [14] were conducted to compare the differences between C. militaris and the sequenced Metarhizum genomes and the plant pathogen F. graminearum,
respectively. The BSR index for each reference protein is
calculated by dividing the query bit score by the reference score and normalized from 0 to 1. A score of 1
indicates a perfect match while a score of 0 indicates no
Blast match of a query protein in the reference proteome. The normalized pairs of BSR indices were then
plotted using the Matlab (v7.0) program (Natick, Massachusetts, USA). The same analysis was conducted for
the three genomes of C. militaris, M. anisopliae and F.
graminearum.
Orthology and phylogenomic analysis

In total, 2,106 orthologous proteins were acquired by a
reciprocal Blast method with a cutoff E value of 1e-20
and a Blast alignment length greater than 60% of the
query sequence. Corresponding orthologous gene protein sequences were aligned with Clustal X 2.0 and the
concatenated amino acid sequences were used for the
generation of a maximum likelihood phylogenomic tree
with the program TREE-PUZZLE [63] using a Dayhoff
model. The divergence time between species was estimated with the program r8s using a Langley-Fitch
model [64] by calibration with the origin of the Ascomycota at 500 to 650 MYA [65].
Protein family classifications

Whole genome protein families were classified by InterproScan [66] and Pfam [67] analysis. The families of
proteases were identified by Blastp searching against the
MEROPS peptidase database release 9.4 with a cutoff E
value of 1e-20 [68]. The CYPs were named according to
the classifications collected at the P450 database [69].
Transporters were classified based on the Transport
Classification Database [70]. Kinases were classified by
Blastp analysis against the KinBase database with a cutoff E value of 1e-10 [68]. Carbohydrate-active enzymes
were classified by local Blastp searching against a library
of catalytic and carbohydrate-binding module enzymes
[68]. G-protein-coupled receptors were selected from
the best hits to GPCRDB sequences [71] and by confirmation that they contained seven transmembrane
helices with the amino terminus outside and the carboxyl terminus inside the plasma membrane. Homologs
of the Magnaporthe Pth11-like GPCRs [30] were identified by local Blastp analysis with a cutoff E value of 1e10. Putative Cordyceps virulence factors were identified
by searching against the pathogen-host interaction database [72] with a cutoff E value of 1e-5, plus additional
searches of known virulence genes reported in entomopathogenic fungi. Two sample t-tests were conducted to

compare the differences in protein family sizes between
insect and plant pathogens. Estimation of FDR of Pvalues was conducted using the program mafdr (Matlab
7.8.0.347(R2009a)).
Analysis of genes involved in purine synthesis and
secondary metabolism

To model the biosynthesis of cordycepin, the purine
metabolic pathway in C. militaris was constructed based
on the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotations [73]. To identify NRPS, PKS or
NRPS-PKS hybrid genes and gene clusters, the whole
genome data set was subjected to analysis with the program SMURF with default settings [74]. Modulation
analysis and domain extraction of different NRPS or
PKS proteins were conducted by Blast searching against
the SBSPKS database [75]. For phylogenetic analysis, the
domain sequences were aligned with Clustal X 2.0 and
the tree was generated using a Poisson model with
1,000 bootstrap replications and pair-wise deletions for
gaps or missing data. The mycotoxin-encoding PKSs
used in the analysis include Gibberella zeae PKS4
(ABB90283) and PKS13 (ABB90282) for the biosynthesis
of zearalenones [76], Aspergillus ochraceus PKS
(AAT92023) for ochratoxin [77], A. clavatus PatK
(ACLA_093660) for patulin [78], Gibberella moniliformis
Fum1p (AAD43562) for fumonisin [79], Monascus purpureus PKS (BAD44749) for citrinin [80], Aspergillus flavus PksA (AAS90093) for aflatoxin [81] and A. nidulans
StcA (Q12397) for sterigmatocystin [82]. The mycotoxin-encoding NRPSs included in the analysis are A.
fumigatus Glip (AAW03307) for gliotoxin [83], Fusarium equiseti NRPS (CAA79245) for enniatin [84],
Cochliobolus carbonum NRPS (AAA33023) for HCtoxin [85] and Tolypocladium inflatum NRPS
(CAA82227) for cyclosporin [86].
Transcriptome analysis

Conidia of C. militaris from day 14 potato dextrose agar
were inoculated into SDB and the undifferentiated
mycelia harvested after a 72-hour incubation at 25°C,
180 rpm. The transcriptome of the mycelia provided a
control for comparison with the transcriptomes of fruiting bodies. Chinese Tussah silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi)
pupae were injected with 50 μl of a conidial suspension
(5 × 106 conidia/ml) and incubated at 22°C in a 12:12
hour light:dark cycle for up to 14 days to allow emergence of fruiting bodies (a stage designated as FB1), 29
days for half-grown fruiting bodies (FB2) and 59 days,
by which time fruiting bodies were mature (FB3)
[11,12]. RNA was extracted with a Qiagen RNeasy kit
plus on-column treatment with RNase-free DNase I
(Germantown, Maryland, USA). Messenger RNA was
purified and after reverse transcription into cDNA, the

Zheng et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R116
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/11/R116

libraries were constructed for tag preparation according
to the massively parallel signature sequencing protocol
[87]. The tags were sequenced with an Illumina technique. We omitted tags from further analysis if only one
copy was detected or it could be mapped to a different
transcript. Other tags were mapped to the genome or
annotated genes if they possessed no more than one
nucleotide mismatch [11,88]. The abundance of each tag
was converted to the value of transcripts per million
(TPM) for each mapped gene for expressional comparison between samples. The significance of differential
gene expression between samples and the FDR of Pvalues were estimated for each individual gene with a
cutoff of P ≤ 0.05 and FDR ≤0.001 [11,89]. The RNA_seq expression dataset is available at the NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus under the accession code
GSE28001.
