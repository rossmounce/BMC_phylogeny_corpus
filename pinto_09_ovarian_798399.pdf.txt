Abstract
Background: In the mouse uterus, pregnancy is accompanied by changes in tachykinin and
tachykinin receptor gene expression and in the uterotonic effects of endogenous tachykinins. In this
study we have investigated whether changes in tachykinin expression and responses are a result of
changes in ovarian steroid levels.
Methods: We quantified the mRNAs of tachykinins and tachykinin receptors in uteri from
ovariectomized mice and studied their regulation in response to estrogen and progesterone using
real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Early (3 h) and late (24 h) responses to estrogen were evaluated
and the participation of the estrogen receptors (ER), ERalpha and ERbeta, was analyzed by treating
mice with propylpyrazole triol, a selective ERalpha agonist, or diarylpropionitrile, a selective agonist
of ERbeta.
Results: All genes encoding tachykinins (Tac1, Tac2 and Tac4) and tachykinin receptors (Tacr1,
Tacr2 and Tacr3) were expressed in uteri from ovariectomized mice. Estrogen increased Tac1 and
Tacr1 mRNA after 3 h and decreased Tac1 and Tac4 expression after 24 h. Tac2 and Tacr3 mRNA
levels were decreased by estrogen at both 3 and 24 h. Most effects of estrogen were also observed
in animals treated with propylpyrazole triol. Progesterone treatment increased the levels of Tac2.
Conclusion: These results show that the expression of tachykinins and their receptors in the
mouse uterus is tightly and differentially regulated by ovarian steroids. Estrogen effects are mainly
mediated by ERalpha supporting an essential role for this estrogen receptor in the regulation of the
tachykinergic system in the mouse uterus.

Background
Uterine function is tightly controlled by ovarian steroids
[1-5]. The physiological responses to acute estrogen (E2)

occur in two temporally distinct steps. Early responses
appear within the first 2–3 h after E2 administration while
late responses are observed 16–24 h after E2, with each

step involving activation of distinct sets of genes [4,5]. E2
and progesterone (P4) exert their effects by binding to specific transcription factor receptors, the estrogen receptors
α (ERα) and β (ERβ) and the progesterone receptors (PR
A and B), respectively [2-7]. In addition to these classical
genotropic effects, E2 and P4 activate extranuclear, nongenomic signaling cascades [8,9]. It is still unclear
whether non-genomic effects are mediated by membrane
receptors distinct from the nuclear receptors, or additionally involve activation of classical ERs or PRs located outside the nucleus [4-9].
Accumulating evidence suggests that tachykinins (TKs)
play a role in the regulation of uterine function [3,10]. TKs
comprise a family of peptides, which in mammals
includes substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) neurokinin B (NKB) and hemokinin-1 (HK) [11-17]. In mice, SP
and NKA are encoded by the Tac1 gene (accession number
NM_009311), NKB by the Tac2 gene (accession number
ENSMUST00000026466) and HK by the Tac4 gene
(accession number NM_053093) [10-14]. Their biological effects are mediated by receptors belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Three different
tachykinin receptors are currently recognized, namely the
NK1 receptor (NK1R), the NK2 receptor (NK2R) and the
NK3 receptor (NK3R) which, in mice, are encoded by the
Tacr1(accession number NM_009313), Tacr2 (accession
number NM_009314) and Tacr3 (accession number
NM_021382) genes, respectively [10-17]. The endogenous tachykinins bind with differing affinities to each of
the tachykinin receptors. Thus, the NK1R is activated preferentially by SP and HK, the NK2R by NKA and the NK3R
by NKB [16,17].
Tachykinins modulate reproductive function at both central and peripheral levels [18-35]. In the central nervous
system, SP, NKA and NKB are expressed in subpopulations of hypothalamic and pituitary neurons where they
influence, and are influenced by, gonadotropin and
gonadal steroid levels [18-22] and modulate the synthesis
and/or secretion of oxytocin [28]. In the reproductive
tract, these peptides are expressed in sensory nerves and in
non-neuronal cells within the placenta, the ovary, the
uterus [3,10,24-26,29-34], the testes and the prostate
[3,36]. They are also present in other reproductive cells
including corpora lutea, oocytes and spermatozoa
[33,35,37].
We have previously found that all genes encoding TKs and
their receptors are expressed in the mammalian uteri and
that their expression and function vary during the ovarian
cycle,
throughout
pregnancy
and
with
age,
[3,10,29,30,38,39]. In late pregnant and non-pregnant
women, in rats, and in late pregnant mice, TKs induce
myometrial contractions that are mediated mainly by the

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/77

NK2R with minor participation of NK1 and NK3 receptors
[10,29,30,39]. In contrast, in non-pregnant mice, the predominant receptor mediating myometrial contractions is
the NK1R, with NK2R playing a minor role [10,29,39]. The
reasons for this difference between species remain
unclear. Indeed, little is known about the physiological
mechanisms that regulate the expression of TKs and their
receptors in mouse uterus and in particular the influence
of ovarian steroids upon their expression.
In this study, we have analyzed the direct effects of the
ovarian steroids E2 and P4 on the expression of Tac1, Tac2,
Tac4, Tacr1, Tacr2 and Tacr3 in uteri from ovariectomized
mice. In addition, we have investigated the effects of the
selective agonist of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) propylpyrazole triol (PPT) [7,40], and the selective agonist of
the estrogen receptor β (ERβ) diarylpropionitrile (DPN)
[7], in order to define the roles played by ERα and ERβ in
the regulation of TK and TK receptor gene expression. We
have also analyzed the effects of estren, a selective activator of non-genomic E2 signaling pathways [8]. Because E2induced changes in gene expression occur as early or late
responses [4,5], animals were treated with E2, PPT, DPN
or estren for either 3 or 24 h.

Methods
Animals and treatments
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Consejo
Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (Spain). Virgin
female Swiss mice (7–9 weeks, 20–25 g) were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain),
housed at 22°C under controlled lighting (12:12-h light/
dark cycle) and provided with food and water ad libitum.
Animals were bilaterally ovariectomized under avertin
anesthesia (250 mg/Kg, i.p.). Fifteen days later, they were
left untreated (control, untreated mice) or treated s.c. with
a) E2 (17β-estradiol benzoate, Sigma, 1 μg/mouse); b) the
selective ERα agonist propylpyrazole triol (PPT, Tocris,
Ellisville, MO, 75 μg/mouse); c) the selective ERβ agonist
diarylpropionitrile (DPN, Tocris, 100 μg/mouse); d)
estren (Steraloids Newport, RI, 300 μg/mouse) or e) the
same volume of vehicle (olive oil, 100 μl) (control, vehicle-treated mice). In all cases, uteri were collected 3 and 24
h after the injection. In a second set of experiments, mice
were treated with a) P4 (Sigma, 2 mg/mouse per day for 2
days) or its vehicle, and uteri collected 24 h after the last
injection; b) a single injection of E2 (1 μg/mouse) or its
vehicle, followed 24 h later by P4 (2 mg/mouse per day for
2 days) or its vehicle and uteri collected 24 h after the last
injection; c) a single injection of E2 (1 μg/mouse) or its
vehicle and uteri collected 72 h after treatment. The pharmacological doses of steroid receptor ligands used in the
present experiments were based on previously published
studies [2,4-8,39].

Real-time RT-PCR
Uterine samples were rapidly immersed in RNAlater
(Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) and stored at -80°C until
use. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were carried
out as previously described [29]. The cDNA samples were
amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primer
pairs (Table 1) designed with the software Primer 3 and
purchased from Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, UK) [29]. A
specific probe (n° 88, Home probe Library, Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark), chosen with the program Probefinder
assay design (Exiqon), was used to detect the Tac1 transcript (88 bp) since this gene was present in faint amounts
in uteri from pregnant and non-pregnant mice [29]. With
this approach, we found that Tac1 mRNA levels were 4.5and 3.0-fold higher in untreated ovariectomized mice,
than in estrus and diestrus virgin mice, respectively
(unpublished observations). The specific primer pair
shown in Table 1 was employed in subsequent experiments for Tac1 detection. Table 1 also shows the primers
used to amplify β-actin (Actb), protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta-isoform (Ppp1cb), glyceraldehyde-3phosphate-dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and polymerase
(RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A (Polr2a), which
were chosen as housekeeping genes for normalizing the
PCR data on the basis of previous studies in the mouse
and rat uterus [29,36,37].

parameters of PCR amplification were: 10 sec at 94°C, 20
sec at 60°C and 30 seconds at 72°C, for 45 cycles. The
identity of each product was established by DNA
sequence analysis [29] and the specificity of PCR reactions
was confirmed by melting curve analysis of the products
and by size verification of the amplicon in a conventional
agarose gel.

Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad
iCycler iQ real-time detection apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a FastStart SYBR Green Master
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany). The

Real-time PCR data were expressed as the fold change of
the target gene expression relative to the geometric mean
(g.m.) mRNA expression of the housekeeping genes in
each sample, as described by Vandesompele et al. [41].
The fold change in gene expression was calculated by the
formula: 2 −ΔΔC T , where CT is the threshold cycle, calculated by the iCycler software, ΔCT = (CTtarget gene –
CTg.m.reference genes) and ΔΔCT = (ΔCT test sample - ΔCT
control sample). A pool of uterine cDNAs from untreated,
ovariectomized mice, was used as a control sample
throughout the study and the ratio of the target gene
mRNA/geometric mean of the four reference genes mRNA
in this control sample was designated as 1. Each assay was
performed in triplicate and negative controls were run for
every assay.

means of two groups using GRAPHPAD PRISM 4. Statistical significance was accepted when P < 0.05.

Results
The transcripts for Tac1, Tac2, Tac4, Tacr1, Tacr2 and Tacr3
were detected in uteri from ovariectomized mice. In all
experiments and with all target genes, mRNA expression
values were similar in untreated and vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).
Effects on tachykinin gene expression
Tac1 expression was increased 3-fold in uterine cDNA
from mice treated with E2 for 3 h, compared with vehicletreated (3 h) mice (Fig. 1A). PPT, DPN and estren also
increased the Tac1 transcript 3 h after their administration
(Fig. 1A). At 24 h, E2 decreased 7-fold the expression of
Tac1 compared to the respective vehicle controls (Fig. 1A).
Treatment with PPT for 24 h caused a 5-fold decrease in
Tac1 mRNA while DNP and estren had no significant
effects (Fig 1A). Tac1 mRNA levels remained low in mice
after 72 h treatment with E2 (Fig. 2A). P4 was without
effect and did not influence the E2-induced decrease in
Tac1 expression (Fig. 2A).

Treatment with E2 for 3 or 24 h caused large decreases in
Tac2 expression, compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig.
1B). The decrease was still significant at 72 h (P < 0.05, see
Fig. 2B). PPT decreased Tac2 mRNA after 3 and 24 h treatment, while neither DPN nor estren had significant effects
(P > 0.05, Fig. 2B). Tac2 mRNA was increased 3-fold in
mice treated with P4 (Fig. 2B); neither this increase nor the
E2-induced decrease were seen in mice treated with both
E2 and P4 (Fig. 2B).
Tac4 mRNA levels were decreased 3-fold in mice treated
with E2 for 24 h, compared with uteri from corresponding
vehicle-treated mice. As shown in Figs. 1C and 2C, none
of the other treatments modified Tac4 expression.
Effects on tachykinin receptor gene expression
Tacr1 expression was increased in mice treated for 3 h with
E2 or PPT (Fig. 3A). After treatment with E2 or PPT for 24
h, the mRNA levels were similar to those observed in control, vehicle-treated mice. DPN and estren had no effects
either at 3 or 24 h (Fig. 3A). P4, alone or in combination
with E2, was without effect on Tacr1 levels (Fig. 4A).

with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3C). DPN and estren had
no effect (Fig. 3C). Tacr3 mRNA levels remained low in
uteri from mice treated with E2 for 72 h (Fig. 4C). P4 did
not modify Tacr3 expression and did not influence the E2induced decrease in the expression of Tacr3 (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
The present study has shown that ovarian steroids tightly
and differentially regulate the expression of tachykinin
and tachykinin receptor genes in the mouse uteri. Since
the uterus is often considered a model to investigate the
effects of steroid hormones on gene transcription, this
study represents the first analysis of the regulatory effects
of E2 and P4 on the whole tachykinin family.
Tac1 mRNA and the tachykinin peptides encoded by this
gene, predominantly SP and NKA, are widely expressed in
neuronal and non-neuronal cells at both central and
peripheral levels [3,10,20-22,26,29,32]. Several workers
have investigated the effects of ovarian steroids on the
expression of this gene and its protein products in the
CNS, particularly in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
[18,20-22,32], often with conflicting results. Our findings
show that Tac1 was regulated by E2 in a complex and timedependent manner, with both stimulatory and inhibitory
effects. The higher expression of Tac1 in ovariectomized
animals, compared to non-ovariectomized mice [29],
together with the observation that 24–72 h treatment with
E2 causes a strong and long-lasting down-regulation of the
Tac1 transcript clearly points to the importance of Tac1
regulation by estrogen. In contrast to E2, P4 had no effect
on Tac1 expression nor did it influence the E2-induced
decrease.
In the mouse uterus there is a predominance of ERα,
while ERβ modulates some of its effects [4-6]. In our
study, the E2 effect was mimicked by PPT, a highly selective agonist of ERα devoid of activity on ERβ [7,40]. In
contrast DPN, a highly selective agonist of ERβ [7], or
estren, a purported activator of non-genomic E2 signaling
[8], were without effect. It thus seems likely that nuclear
ERα mediates the inhibitory effect of E2 (after 24 h) on
Tac1 expression.

Compared with uteri from control, vehicle-treated mice,
E2 and P4 (alone or in combination), PPT, DPN and estren
did not cause significant alterations in Tacr2 mRNA levels
(P > 0.05, Figs. 3B and 4B).

Early physiological responses of the mouse uterus to acute
E2 appear within the first 2–3 h while late responses are
observed 16–24 h after E2 [4,5]. Consistent with these
findings, 3 h treatment with E2 caused an increase in Tac1
mRNA levels. This early response was also observed in
animals treated with PPT, DPN or estren. These findings
suggest that early stimulation of Tac1 is mediated by both
genomic and non-genomic E2 pathways.

Tacr3 expression was decreased in mice treated with E2 for
3 or 24 h and in mice treated with PPT for 24 h, compared

The NK1R is the preferred receptor for SP, while NKA can
also act as a potent agonist on NK1R [13-17]. Therefore, it

was interesting to observe that treatment with E2 for 3 h
caused a parallel increase in both Tac1 and Tacr1 mRNAs.
Tacr1 gene expression was also increased in mice treated
for 3 h with PPT revealing the participation of ERα. Since
tachykinins are potent inflammatory mediators, the
present findings may suggest that SP(NKA)-NK1R ligandreceptor pair could play a role in mediating rapid effects
of E2 in the uterus, such as hyperemia, water imbibition
and attraction of immune cells.
Treatment of ovariectomized mice with E2, PPT, DPN or
P4 did not decrease NK1R gene expression. This finding
was unexpected, as we previously found that the transcript
for Tacr1 decreases by about 11-fold on day 17 of pregnancy, compared with its expression in uteri from nonpregnant mice [29]. The NK1R is regulated by many different mechanisms and it may be that near term, in addition
to ovarian steroids, other hormonal, humoral, placental
or neural influences may influence its expression.
The NK2R is the key tachykinin receptor mediating contractile responses to TKs in the near term uteri from all
mammalian species studied [10,29,30]. Furthermore, the
participation of the NK2R in mouse myometrial contractions is higher under conditions of estrogen dominance
[29,39]. The expression of Tacr2 in uteri from ovariectomized mice was, however, unaffected by treatment with
E2 or P4. This result is consistent with our previous observation that Tacr2 mRNA levels are similar in uteri from
pregnant or non-pregnant mice and remain essentially
constant during different hormonal stages [29]. Taken
together, these findings suggest that, at least in the mouse
uterus, the Tacr2 gene is not a direct target for ovarian steroids. The increased response in late pregnancy to agonists
that act at the NK2R [29] may therefore reflect regulation
at a posttranscriptional level.
NKB, together with SP, kisspeptin and dinorphin, is
present in a group of hypothalamic neurons that also
express
estrogen
and
progesterone
receptors
[19,21,42,43]. NKB is also expressed at all main levels in
the female genital tract [10,24-26,29-33] and its excessive
secretion from the placenta may cause, in part, some of
the symptoms of pre-eclampsia [24,25,31]. Recently, the
genome sequence of a non-placental mammal, namely
the platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus, has become available [44] and by phylogenetic analysis, we found that the
NKB encoding gene is present (Ensemble entry
ENSOANG00000022075). This finding clearly shows that
NKB plays additional roles in reproduction, apart from its
participation in placental pathophysiology.
NKB is elevated in the human female hypothalamus after
menopause [21]. Additionally, its expression in the
rodent brain and in the rat uterus is increased by age and

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/77

ovariectomy and decreased by E2 treatment [3,19,38,42].
These findings and our current observations showing that
Tac2 mRNA is strongly repressed in uteri from young ovariectomized mice treated with E2 at all times of treatment
indicate that at both central and peripheral levels, NKB
over-expression is secondary to ovarian failure [19,38].
Tac2 inhibition was mediated by ERα because it was
observed in mice treated for 3 or 24 h with PPT, but not
with DPN or estren. In addition, our data show, to our
knowledge for the first time, that P4 treatment up-regulated Tac2 gene expression in uteri from ovariectomized
mice. The mechanism that mediates this P4 effect remains
unclear, as in ovariectomized mice, the expression of PRs
fall as a consequence of the lack of E2 [7]. Although the
presence of a basal population of nuclear PRs cannot be
excluded, the effects on Tac2 expression may more probably be mediated by activation of membrane-bound P4
receptors distinct from PRs. Several P4 membrane receptor
candidates are present in uteri from ovariectomized mice
and the expression of some of them is increased by P4 [9].
Up-regulation by P4 would permit a local increase in Tac2
expression following ovulation or in the case of copulation and successful fertilization. These data are in agreement with our previous observations showing that the
highest Tac2 levels were found in the mouse uterus
around the time of implantation and that these were
strongly decreased at late pregnancy [29].
At the peripheral level the role of NK3R, like that of its preferred ligand NKB, remains poorly understood
[10,31,32,36,45]. The present data show that E2 strongly
reduces Tacr3 expression in uteri from ovariectomized
mice. The E2-induced responses were mimicked by PPT
but not by DPN or estren, providing the first evidence, to
our knowledge, that the effects of E2 on this receptor are
mediated by ERα. The observation that E2 caused a rapid
and concomitant down-regulation of Tac2 and Tacr3
expression supports the existence of an important link
between E2 and the NK3R/NKB activation pathway [38].
Moreover, the tight regulation of both genes strongly
argues for a role of NKB, acting through the NK3R, in
mediating some of the effects of E2 and P4 on uterine function [34,38]. In this context, a recent report has established a correlation between familial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism and mutations in the human genes TAC3
and TACR3·[23] providing clear evidence for the importance of NKB and the NK3R in reproduction.
The Tac4 gene is expressed in the placenta, the ovary, the
uterus, and also in oocytes and blastocyst-stage embryos
[12,29,32,37]. In the mouse uteri, HK caused myometrial
contractions that are mediated by the NK1R and are
decreased at late pregnancy [39]. Apart from its effects on
myometrial contractility, the physiological role of HK at

the reproductive level remains poorly understood and its
direct regulation by ovarian steroids has not been studied.
The present data show that the Tac4 gene is also a target of
E2 and suggest that Tac4 expression is down-regulated by
E2 surges, as those observed in mammals before ovulation
or near labor.

Conclusion
This study suggests that uterine tachykinins and tachykinin receptors are important targets of ovarian steroids and
particularly of E2, acting at ERα. The whole tachykinergic
system appears involved in the regulation of reproductive
functions.
