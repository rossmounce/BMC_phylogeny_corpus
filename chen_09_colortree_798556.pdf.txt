Abstract
Background: Genome sequencing projects and comparative genomics studies typically aim to
trace the evolutionary history of large gene sets, often requiring human inspection of hundreds of
phylogenetic trees. If trees are checked for compatibility with an explicit null hypothesis (e.g., the
monophyly of certain groups), this daunting task is greatly facilitated by an appropriate coloring
scheme.
Findings: In this note, we introduce ColorTree, a simple yet powerful batch customization tool
for phylogenic trees. Based on pattern matching rules, ColorTree applies a set of customizations
to an input tree file, e.g., coloring labels or branches. The customized trees are saved to an output
file, which can then be viewed and further edited by Dendroscope (a freely available tree viewer).
ColorTree runs on any Perl installation as a stand-alone command line tool, and its application can
thus be easily automated. This way, hundreds of phylogenic trees can be customized for easy visual
inspection in a matter of minutes.
Conclusion: ColorTree allows efficient and flexible visual customization of large tree sets through
the application of a user-supplied configuration file to multiple tree files.

Findings
Background
Studies in comparative genomics, e.g., analyzing protein
family evolution [1-3] or lateral gene transfers [4-7], typically generate large sets of phylogenic trees. Visual inspection of these trees is often necessary, as automated
algorithms are not yet sufficiently flexible and reliable
[8,9]. The aim of such analyses is often to check for consistency with given null hypotheses (e.g., the clustering of
gene copies from known monophyletic groups). This task
is often simplified by manual customization of the trees
prior to inspection. Customizations usually involve
changes of foreground and background colors of specific
labels, line-width and color of associated branches, and

other aspects of a phylogenic tree. The majority of existing
tree viewing programs allow the customization of one or
a few opened trees within reasonable time; few also allow
to save and re-open customized results [10,11]. However,
such manual customization becomes time-consuming
and error prone for large trees (the tree of life or the phylogenic tree of NCBI taxonomy, for example) or large tree
numbers. In some modern tree-editors published
recently, TreeDyn [12] and Dendroscope [13] for example, scripting and command-line consoles are introduced
to tackle the problem; in both program, users can manipulate leaves and nodes through a command-line window
(the console). By using TreeDyn, user can even save their
commands into script files and re-apply them to other tree

files afterwards. The advantage of such implementation is
that the manual customization jobs are greatly facilitated
in a semi-automatic way; however, the disadvantages are
also obvious: users have to learn yet some other languages
(although both are as simple as plain English and easy to
learn for those who had programming experiences) and
it's still difficult to apply the same set of commands to
multiple tree-files.
Here we introduce a new program, ColorTree, which
quickly and automatically customizes phylogenic trees
based on a user-supplied customization file. Results are
saved in a format that can be read by Dendroscope [13], a
powerful tree viewer and editor freely available from its

authors http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/soft
ware/dendroscope. The advantages of ColorTree over
existing customization methods are: (1) It is a standalone
program that can be run from the command-line, making
it ideally suited for batch use; (2) customized results are
saved for further viewing and editing; and (3) the usersupplied configuration files, based on pattern matching
logic, guarantee the stability and flexibility of customization results.
Program overview
ColorTree takes two input text files, a tree file in any of the
"Newick" and "NEXUS" formats, and a user-defined configuration file detailing the desired customizations. Input

tree files may contain multiple phylogenic trees, delimited
by ';'. Bootstrap scores on input tree branches are preserved.
Each line of the configuration file specifies one individual
customization command. Each consists of five tab-delimited columns, specifying:
• how the keyword will be searched in branch labels
• the keyword to be searched in branch labels
• foreground color to be applied to branches and node
labels

standard desktop computer. All customized trees were
then visually inspected in Dendroscope.
Several examples of customized trees are shown in Figure
1. Figure 1a shows a phylogenetic tree for the sorbitol
transporter protein. This represents a typical scenario of
lineage-specific gene duplications. An ancestral sorbitol
transporter gene is found in the common ancestor of
green plants (highlighted in green) and brown algae
(highlighted in brown). After the separation of green and
brown algae, the ancestral gene remained single copy in
brown algae, duplicating only in the terminal branches.
While there are also duplications specific to rice and poplar, one duplication is evident before the separation of
these two species.

• background color to be applied node labels
• line width to be applied to branches
The first two columns are obligatory, while the other three
columns can be left blank. Detailed descriptions of the
configuration file, as well as instructions for its generation, are available in the software package.
To customize trees in the input file, terminal node labels
of each tree are searched using the user-supplied keywords. Four ways of searching are supported: "prefix",
"suffix", "complete", and "contain". The user-defined
"background color" will be applied to all matching labels,
"branch width" will be applied to the branches that
directly connect to the corresponding terminal nodes, and
"foreground color" to both labels and directly connecting
branches. When all descendant terminal nodes of any
internal node have the same color, all intervening
branches will also receive that color. This is particularly
useful to find the common ancestor of a group of genes,
or to pinpoint the separation of two clades during evolution (see examples in Figure 1).

Figure 1b shows a phylogenic tree for the glutamine synthetase protein, which was adopted from [5]. Species of
archaea (red) and bacteria (black) are intermingled. The
tree is thus incompatible with the accepted monophyly of
the two kingdoms. If the tree faithfully reflects the evolutionary history of the gene, this would indicate possible
lateral gene transfers (LGT) between bacteria and archea.
Thus, visual inspection using ColorTree and Dentroscope
is a simple and intuitive way to identify certain types of
inconsistencies in genetic data. However, users may also
wish to look at alternative, sophisticated methods to
detect such inconsistencies, e.g., Neighbour-Net [14] or
the 'tree-of-tree' approach [15].

Availability and requirements
The program described in this note is freely downloadable
from http://code.google.com/p/colortree. ColorTree is
written in PERL and should run on any platform running
PERL and BioPerl. To facilitate users who don't have programming experience or have no PERL pre-installed, we
also provide pre-packed executables that can run on computers without PERL and BioPerl modules.

Customized tree(s) are saved in ".dendro" format, which
can be viewed and further edited by Dendroscope [13]. It
should be pointed out that Dendroscope provides a range
of tree customization methods, but these have to be
applied to individually opened tree files and tends to be
time-consuming.

Requirements: 5.8 or latter version of PERL program http:/
/www.perl.org and 1.4 or latter version of BioPerl module
http://www.bioperl.org.

Examples of customized trees
In a genome sequencing project, evolutionary paths of
selected protein families in multiple organisms were
investigated. This required visual inspection of several
hundred gene families, each containing orthologous
genes from different organisms as well as paralogous copies within organisms. Using ColorTree, hundreds of phylogenic trees can be customized within a few hours on a
