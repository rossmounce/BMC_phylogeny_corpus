Abstract
Background: Since Darwin's pioneering work, evolutionary changes in isolated island populations
of vertebrates have continued to provide the strongest evidence for the theory of natural selection.
Besides macro-evolutionary changes, micro-evolutionary changes and the relative importance of
natural selection vs. genetic drift are under intense investigation. Our study focuses on the genetic
differentiation in morphological and life-history traits in insular populations of a small mammal the
bank vole Myodes glareolus.
Results: Our results do not support the earlier findings for larger adult size or lower reproductive
effort in insular populations of small mammals. However, the individuals living on islands produced
larger offspring than individuals living on the mainland. Genetic differentiation in offspring size was
further confirmed by the analyses of quantitative genetics in lab. In insular populations, genetic
differentiation in offspring size simultaneously decreases the additive genetic variation (VA) for that
trait. Furthermore, our analyses of differentiation in neutral marker loci (Fst) indicate that VA is less
than expected on the basis of genetic drift alone, and thus, a lower VA in insular populations could
be caused by natural selection.
Conclusion: We believe that different selection pressures (e.g. higher intraspecific competition)
in an insular environment might favour larger offspring size in small mammals. Island selection for
larger offspring could be the preliminary mechanism in a process which could eventually lead to a
smaller litter size and lower reproductive effort frequently found in insular vertebrates.

Background
Population genetics models [1] emphasise the importance of different stochastic processes related to geographical isolation, such as the founder effect and genetic drift,
on the differentiation of small populations. Severe reduc-

tions of genetic variability and population size are suggested to favour drift and constrain natural selection [2].
However, recent studies [3,4] have shown that natural
selection could be the dominant diversifying agent in the
evolution of quantitative traits. Irrespective of whether we

consider natural selection or random drift as the major
causative agent in evolution, together they may allow
populations on isolated islands to evolve a collection of
traits that distinguish them from their mainland relatives.
Differences between mainland and island populations of
mammals have often been referred to as the Island rule or
Island Syndrome [5-11]. The most familiar pattern on
islands is the evolution of larger-bodied species towards a
smaller size and smaller-bodied species towards a larger
size [12]. In small mammals, the pattern also includes
reduced reproductive output, higher survival rate, and differences in behaviour (see reviews in [9,13]). Recently the
generality of the island rule has been criticized by Meiri
and colleagues [14,15]. According to their phylogenetic
analyses, the increase in body size might only hold true in
some mammalian groups (e.g. murid rodents). They
argued that earlier reviews were biased by a few extreme
examples in some mammalian groups (e.g. elephants),
and these reviews might have ignored many examples
where body size has not changed. Furthermore, it has
been suggested [15,16] that future studies should be
focused more clearly on the possible differences in natural
selection caused by island characters (size and isolation)
[17], ecological mechanisms (e.g. predation rate and
inter/intraspecific competition) [18] and species specific
mechanisms (e.g. evolutionary constraints caused by
additive genetic variation).
Here we focused on the possible genetic differentiation in
morphological and life-history traits between insular and
mainland populations of a small mammal, the bank vole
Myodes glareolus. Our previous studies have indicated a
large additive genetic variation in reproductive traits (e.g
size and number of offspring) in the mainland population of our study species [19]. Furthermore, we have
shown that the rapid selection caused by intraspecific
competition can significantly regulate the proportion of
genetic reproductive tactics (high or low reproductive
effort) in mainland populations [20]. In the present study,
we tested the hypothesis that the selection for reproductive tactics might differ in an insular environment, causing
genetic differentiation of insular populations from mainland ones. We also tested the relative importance of natural selection and random drift on genetic differentiation.
In these analyses fitness-related additive genetic variation
was compared to neutral genetic variation (neutral genetic
markers) [21].

Results
We observed neither morphological differentiation in the
breeding females, nor a significant difference in their
reproductive effort between insular and mainland populations of the bank vole. By contrast, females that originated from the islands produced significantly larger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/296

offspring than those from the mainland (Fig 1, Table 1),
indicating either environmental or genetic responses of
mothers to the insular environment. The size of island or
distance to mainland did not affect the breeding characters of insular females (see Additional file 1).
As the phenotypic differences in neonate size do not necessarily imply micro-evolutionary differentiation, the
genetic basis of offspring size was further analysed in the
laboratory using paternal half sib analyses. Males originating from island populations fathered significantly heavier
offspring at birth than mainland fathers (Fig 1, Table 2),
when both were mated to a common stock of females.
Moreover, the analyses indicated significant additive
genetic variance only among the mainland fathers (VA ±
S.E. = 0.047 ± 0.020 and h2 ± S.E = 0.96 ± 0.41), whereas
genetic variance was zero or very low among island fathers
(Table 3). Heritability estimates differed significantly
between the mainland and island fathers (t = 3.67, df =
26, P < 0.002) (Table 3).
The relative importance of natural selection and random
drift on offspring size divergence can be tested by comparing among-island differences based on additive genetic
variation and measures based on neutral marker genes
(Fst) [21]. Here the island populations were different
according to neutral markers (Fst ± S.E. = 0.177 ± 0.021; P
< 0.001) but not according to the additive genetic variance
(VA ≈ 0) (Table 3). This means that the VA was less than

expected on the basis of genetic drift alone. Mainland
populations (localities) did not differ according to neutral
markers (Fst ± S.E. = 0.008 ± 0.006; n.s.). Fst values differed
significantly between mainland and island populations (P
= 0.001).

Discussions and conclusion
The present results are in agreement with earlier suggestions that offspring size might be the first life-history characteristic to evolve in insular populations of vertebrates
[22,23]. Large neonate size can be a local adaptation to an
insular environment, where many ecological selection
pressures, e.g. intra- and inter-specific competition and
predation, differ from larger mainland populations [9].
Here we could not directly test the biological significance
of larger offspring size (0.11 g difference between the
island and mainland populations), but according to our
previous research, the increase in female offspring size
from 1.74 g to 1.85 g may have an important impact on
the future fitness of bank vole offspring [19]. For example,
the age of first breeding would decreased by 5 days, calculated by a linear regression model (y = -46.11x + 181; Fig
1b in [19]), and the probability of breeding was increased
from 0.68 to 0.78, calculated by a logistic regression
model (ln(y/1-y) = 4.87x - 7.70; Fig. 2a in [19]).
The breeding density of territorial bank vole females
seems to be lower in open populations (approx. 10

females/ha maximum) [24] compared to the artificially
enclosed populations (e.g. over 20 females/ha) [25]. If
intra-specific competition between breeding females is
similarly increased on (enclosed) islands, it could be an
important selective force for the larger offspring size at
birth. In general, the precise mechanisms of selection and
when intra-specific competition may favour the fitness of
larger offspring or adult size have not yet been tested in
insular populations [18]. There exists only indirect evidence that competition is lower on larger islands, decreasing selection for body size in mammals [17]. Here we did
not find any effect of island area or isolation on the measured morphological or life-history traits. We suggest that
compared to the earlier studies, the present islands were
relatively small and variation in size might be too low to
find the significant effects of island characters. However,
our findings are in agreement with most of the earlier
studies, which do not support the importance of island
characters for the differentiation of insular individuals
from their mainland descendants [26-30].
The phenomenon to produce large offspring can also be
linked to the genetic dispersal tactics of individuals
[22,31]. The individuals which are more prone to take
risks, e.g. by dispersing over large open ice to islands,
might also genetically differ according to many other
traits besides offspring size. The change in offspring size
could then be a by-product of selection on other traits.
This possibility cannot be ruled out before knowing more
about population genetics and the behaviour of individuals (e.g. extinctions, dispersal and mutation rates) in our
island system. Even the loss of additive genetic variation
in offspring body mass that we have shown here can be
explained by non-adaptive genetic processes, e.g. random
drift. However, our analyses of differentiation in neutral
marker loci (Fst) indicate that VA is less than expected on
the basis of genetic drift alone [21]. Here, we were not able
to analyse additive genetic variance or variance in neutral
markers within single islands, as our estimates of additive
genetic variance were based on a few individuals per loca-

Phenotypic variances (VP), additive genetic variances (VA) and heritabilities (h2) of body mass were estimated by half-sib analyses from the variance
components among sires separately for the different environments. Standard errors of VA and h2 were estimated using the formula in [59]. The

tion. Therefore, comprehensive comparisons of differentiation in neutral marker loci and additive genetic variation
in quantitative traits are still lacking [21].
In contrast to the island populations, additive genetic variation in offspring body mass has been observed in mainland populations [[19] and here]. Additive genetic
variation was also higher than expected by the variation in
neutral markers. Similarly, a large additive genetic variation has also been show in several other life-history traits
in different systems [32-34]. In agreement with our findings, the additive genetic variation is also usually higher
than the variation in neutral markers [21]. Additive
genetic variation in life-history traits can be maintained
by a trade-off (negative genetic correlation) between two
traits [35], in this case between the size and number of offspring [19], especially when natural selection favours one
trait under current conditions and another at a later date
[36]. Strong annual and multi-annual density fluctuations
(cyclicity) are suggested to maintain additive genetic variation and even genetic polymorphism in life-history
traits, particularly in rodent populations [37]. In fact, our
recent findings with the bank vole indicate that densityand negative frequency-dependent selection favour the
genetically different allocation tactics between the size
and number of offspring [20].
We supposed that if density fluctuations and other ecological parameters related to them are more stable in insular
environments, selection for large offspring size could also
be stable long term. Theoretically, strong selection might
decrease additive genetic variation found in our islands
[34,38,39]. Moreover, selection for large offspring size
might simultaneously decrease litter size [19]. A future
goal would be to show whether large neonate size is an
adaptation to insular environments, and also how genetic
differentiation in this particular trait is related to other
life-history and behavioral traits (e.g. litter size, reproductive effort, adult size, longevity, disperal) as well as their
evolution.

Methods
Study species
The bank vole is a common mammal in coniferous forests
of northern Europe [40]. The breeding period in central
Finland lasts from May to September [25]. Pregnancy lasts
for 19–20 days and pups are weaned until the age of three
weeks [41]. In addition to remarkably large phenotypic
[25] and additive genetic variation [19] in litter size (2–
10) and offspring size (1.3–2.5 g), a trade-off (i.e. both
negative phenotypic and genetic correlations) also exists
between these traits [19]. Furthermore, a larger size at
birth [19,24] and at weaning [41] increases the probability of maturation (i.e. breeding in summer they are born)
in juvenile females. Reproducing bank vole females are
territorial, while home ranges of males and non-breeding
individuals overlap [42-44]. The density of breeding
females is limited due to their territoriality [45].
Field sample
The study was carried out in central Finland (62° 37'N,
26° 20'E). The data are based on 898 individuals caught
from 37 islands (0.12–70 ha) in lake Konnevesi and from
20 mainland localities within 5 km of the lake during the
summer 1999. Pregnant females were caught from 20
islands and all mainland areas, and thus only these populations were included in the present study. The shortest
distance between neighbouring study islands varied
between 50 to 500 m and the mean distance from islands
to the mainland was 631 m (S.E. = 75 m). Dispersal
between islands during summer is very low, indicated by
a separate study during the autumn where we recaptured
106 island individuals (three to five months from the first
capture); none of these individuals left their home
islands. The mainland trapping areas were sufficiently far
apart (mean ± S.E = 832 ± 129 m, range 300 – 2 000 m)
to decrease dispersal between different mainland localities. We were not able to estimate dispersal rate between
mainland localities, but according to earlier studies [25],
it should be very low especially among territorial breeding
females. The individuals were caught using Ugglan multi-

ple-capture live-traps. On the smaller islands (< 3.5 ha),
trap lines were set at c. 20 m intervals (25 traps/ha). On
the larger islands (> 3.5 ha) and in the mainland localities, individuals were trapped using the small quadrat
sampling method (modified from [46]: each quadrat area
(side = 15 m) contained four trap sites (4 traps/area). Prebaited traps were left open for two nights, after which they
were set and checked over three consecutive days. Trappings were carried out from early May to the end of the
breeding season in September.
All trapped voles were taken into the laboratory where
each individual was sexed, weighed to the nearest 0.1 g,
and measured for maximum head width to the nearest 0.1
mm with a digital calliper [47]. Males and non-pregnant
females were then released back to the field. 51 pregnant
females from 20 islands and 33 pregnant females from 20
mainland localities were kept in the laboratory prior to
producing a litter [41]. Immediately after birth, pups were
weighed with an electronic balance to the nearest 0.01 g,
and width of head was measured using a stereomicroscope. The mothers were released with their pups at their
point of capture [41]. The proportion of breeding females
did not differ between the islands (21.2%, n = 241) and
mainland (26.8%, n = 123)(G = 1.45, df = 1, P = 0.229).
The reproductive effort of females was estimated using
two formulas. First, we used the formula:RE(1) = L ×
Mo0.75/Mm0.75, where L is litter size; Mo is pup mass at birth,
and Mm is weight of the female after delivery [22,48]. In
this formula, energy requirements to produce offspring is
calculated relative to the allometric requirement of the
mother (assuming standard metabolism increases to the
0.75 power of mass for mammals) [48-51]. The mothers
were released with their pups at their point of capture
[41]. Since the theoretical and empirical basis of 0.75 scaling is still under debate in the literature of animal metabolism (see e.g. [52,53]), we also used a more simple
formula: RE(2) = L × Mo/Mm, where litter mass was
divided by mother body mass.
Analyses of quantitative genetics and neutral markers
The genetic basis of offspring characteristics was analyzed
in the laboratory. In the analyses, we compared the effect
of male origin (island/mainland) on the characteristic of
their offspring. Bank vole males do not rear their offspring
and male quality does not affect the amount of maternal
care [54], hence we can assume that the genetic analyses
are not biased by covariances between non-genetic maternal effects and genetic paternal effects.

We mated a random sample of males from the mainland
and island populations with two to three randomly chosen females that originated from a separate lab colony
(Fig. 1, Table 2). The females mated with the island males

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/296

did not differ from the females mated with mainland
males (head width: (t = 0.255, df = 73, P = 0.800; body
mass: t = 1.651, df = 73, P = 0.103). Body mass and head
width of the males that originated from islands did not
differ from the males that originated from the mainland
(Mixed model analyses (SPSS);origin fixed and population random factor; head width: F1,15.7 = 1.21, P = 0.287;
body mass: F1,10.9 = 1.13, P = 0.311). To obtain an estimate of heritability (h2) and additive genetic variance
(VA) for the body mass of offspring in the mainland and
island populations, we performed standard half-sib analyses (Table 3). The analyses included 16 sires, 44 dams
and 216 progeny from mainland populations and 12
sires, 31 dams and 140 progeny from island populations.
We were only able to include one to three males per island
or mainland location to the analyses, so our estimates of
genetic variance indicate the variance among the whole
island system, not variance within single islands.
Individuals were genotyped with six microsatellite loci,
which are highly variable in the bank vole [55]. To obtain
comparable analyses, we used mature males from the
same islands (62 males from 9 islands) and mainland
localities (75 males from 10 areas) as we used in the analyses of quantitative genetics. An estimate of population
structure was obtained using Fst [56], calculated using
FSTAT ver 2.9.3 [57]. Standard error was obtained with
Jacknifing over loci. The significance of population differentiation was tested by log-likelihood G-statistics and the
test was based on 1000 randomization of genotypes
within samples [58].
