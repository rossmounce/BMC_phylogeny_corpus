Abstract
Background: Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a secreted immunoregulatory cytokine critically involved in host protection from
parasitic helminths [1]. Reasoning that helminths may have evolved mechanisms to antagonize IL4 to maximize
their dispersal, we explored mammalian IL4 evolution.
Results: This analysis revealed evidence of diversifying selection at 15 residues, clustered in epitopes responsible
for IL4 binding to its Type I and Type II receptors. Such a striking signature of selective pressure suggested either
recurrent episodes of pathogen antagonism or ligand/receptor co-evolution. To test the latter possibility, we
performed detailed functional analysis of IL4 allotypes expressed by Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus
castaneus, which happen to differ at 5 residues (including three at positively selected sites) in and adjacent to the
site 1 epitope that binds the IL4Ra subunit shared by the Type I and Type II IL4 receptors. We show that this intraspecies variation affects the ability of IL4 neither to bind IL4 receptor alpha (IL4Ra) nor to signal biological
responses through its Type I receptor.
Conclusions: Our results – reminiscent of clustered positively selected sites revealing functionally important
residues at host-virus interaction interfaces – are consistent with IL4 having evolved to avoid recurrent pathogen
antagonism, while maintaining the capacity to bind and signal through its cognate receptor. This work exposes
what may be a general feature of evolutionary conflicts fought by pathogen antagonists at host protein-protein
interaction interfaces involved in immune signaling: the emergence of receptor-binding ligand epitopes capable of
buffering amino acid variation.

Background
Viruses and bacteria have evolved survival strategies
based on antagonism of host immunoregulatory molecules [2]. Cytokine signaling pathways are prime targets,
often subverted by horizontal acquisition of genes
encoding cytokines or their receptors that are then
selectively modified and marshaled [3,4]. With genomes
orders of magnitude larger than viruses and bacteria,
helminths have the capacity to maintain multiple and
complex immune antagonizing strategies to facilitate
their intricate life cycles within obligate mammalian

hosts. Indeed, recent work has shown that filarial nematodes express a homolog of transforming growth factor
beta (TGFb) that can bind to host receptors [5]. Nevertheless, compared to bacteria and viruses, our knowledge of immune modulatory mechanisms employed by
parasitic helminths is in its infancy.
Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a 17 kDa monomeric glycoprotein of the Type I hematopoietin superfamily secreted
by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, NK T cells, mast cells and
basophils [6-9]. Its pleiotropic functions are still being
enumerated and include acting as a Th2 cell developmental determinant, a T/B cell growth factor, an IgE/
IgG1 class-switch inducer and a muscle cell contraction
inducer. Each of these functions of IL4 plays a role in
mobilizing and coordinating anti-helminth immune
responses [10]. In vivo administration of antibodies or

recombinant cytokines that raise IL4 levels diminish helminth infection; conversely, lowering IL4 levels increases
helminth infection [11,12]. Mice genetically deficient in
IL4 or the IL4 receptor display impaired capacity to
control experimental worm infection [1]. IL4 transduces
signals to the cell interior via two distinct heterodimeric
receptors that share a 140-kDa membrane-spanning
IL4Ra subunit [6,13]. IL4Ra is paired in the Type I
receptor with the 42-kDa common gamma subunit (gc)
and in the Type II receptor with the 65-kDa interleukin13 receptor alpha 1 subunit (IL13Ra1). The Type II
receptor binds not only IL4 but also the paralogous
cytokine IL13. Through alternative splicing, both IL4Ra
and IL13Ra1 can be secreted as soluble molecules that
can modulate immune responses by altering local concentrations of free IL4 and IL13 [14]. This complex
receptor system mediates the pleiotropic functions of
IL4 through regulated and non-uniform expression on a
wide variety of hematopoietic and other cell types.
As a key host molecule triggered by and required for
the control of parasitic worms [10], IL4 may constitute
a battleground upon which helminths are locked in evolutionary conflict with their mammalian hosts. Testifying to the crucial adaptive nexus occupied by IL4,
evolutionary diversifying selection has been detected
acting on the human IL4 promoter, leading to the fixation of promoter sequence variants that differentially
bind the transcription factor NFAT and consequently
have distinct thresholds for transcriptional triggering
[15]. High levels of IL4 expressed by individuals inheriting the sensitive form of the promoter might provide a
mechanism to overwhelm a parasite-derived IL4-antagonist molecule.
Previous studies have remarked on the rapid evolution
of IL4 and IL4Ra [16-18]. To explore whether pathogen
antagonism could provide an explanation, we analyzed
IL4 sequences from multiple mammalian lineages and
found a strong signature of diversifying selection, clustered at interfaces that interact not only with IL4Ra but
also with IL13a1. This striking evolutionary signature is
consistent with pathogen antagonism of IL4 but formally is also consistent with rapid co-evolution between
IL4 and its receptor. We tested the latter possibility by
exploiting the fact that in mice, natural intra-specific
IL4 variation clusters at the site 1 epitope for IL4Ra
binding. In sensitive cellular and biochemical studies of
two murine IL4 allotypes, we found that site 1 epitope
variation is functionally neutral with respect to IL4Ra
binding affinity and kinetics as well as signalling IL4dependent cellular responses. Given the functional neutrality of intra-specific variation at 3 residues evolving
under diversifying selection, we speculate that the capacity to buffer amino acid variation at the IL4Ra site 1
epitope is an adaptation to recurrent pathogen

antagonism, seen previously in other host-host interaction surfaces subject to pathogen mimicry [4,19].

Results
Evolution of IL4 in mammals

Diversifying or positive selection is typically seen in
molecular arms races, especially at direct interfaces
between host and pathogen proteins [4,20]. We investigated whether sequence variation of IL4 could have
arisen by recurrent diversifying selection (perhaps
shaped by pathogen antagonism) during mammalian
evolution. We used data from whole genome sequencing
projects to compare the IL4 coding sequence from 28
eutherian mammalian lineages. The ‘Model Selection
tool’ at the online HyphY server (see methods) identified
the HKY85 model as the most appropriate using the
AIC criterion (p <0.07). A maximum-likelihood phylogeny (Figure 1) was constructed using the PhyML
method using the IL4 coding nucleotide alignment; this
phylogeny was largely congruent with accepted mammalian phylogeny [21,22]. An almost identical topology was
obtained using distance based neighbor-joining methods,
except for minor variation in the Rodentia. Figure 2
shows the amino acid alignment of representative IL4
proteins from 25 mammals, including 7 primates. Using
the free-ratio model in the PAML suite of programs
[23], which allows an independent assignment of dN/dS
ratios to each evolutionary branch, we found that most
branches of the phylogeny show dN/dS <1 with the
overall dN/dS ratio for the entire tree equaling 0.66
(2.33/3.68). The accelerated evolution of the rodent lineage [24] is evident in the long branch leading to the
four rodents but this is not due to an overall increase in
dN/dS in rodents. Indeed, the free-ratio model (in
which all branches can have different dN/dS ratios) was
not a statistically superior fit to the one-ratio model
(2lnl = 60.73, degrees of freedom = 53, p > 0.2)
When we compared the likelihood of IL4 evolution
under codon models that prohibit (NSsites model M7)
or permit diversifying selection (M8), we found that
models permitting diversifying selection fit IL4 evolution
significantly better than those that disallow it (Table 1).
In the M7-M8 comparison, we found that 15% of residues have evolved with an average dN/dS ratio of 1.8
indicating that IL4 has evolved under recurrent diversifying selection in mammals (Table1, p < 10-4) consistent
with previous reports [16-18,25]. We found robust evidence of positive selection in an analysis limited to rabbits and rodents alone, limited to Laurasiatheria alone,
and to all eutherian mammals excluding either rodents
and rabbits, or excluding primates. However, we do not
find robust evidence for diversifying selection when the
analysis is limited to 16 primates including 2 prosimians
(2lnl = 0.73, p > 0.5, Table 1). This suggests that the

selective pressure that recurrently drove positive selection of eutherian IL4 may be relaxed in the primate
lineage. A recent primate evolution study of genes
involved in HIV pathogenesis also found evidence for
IL4 having experienced diversifying selection [16]. The
discrepancy with our IL4 analysis [that failed to detect
significant evidence of diversifying selection when
restricted to primates alone (Table 1)] may be due to
different species analyzed in each study. It must also be
noted that the signature for selection in the previous
study was modest [16] with only 1 site identified as having evolved under positive selection.
Our analysis identifies 15 codon positions in which
there is significant evidence of diversifying selection
(posterior probability >0.5 under a Naïve Empirical
Bayes model) (open circles in Figure 2) of which three
sites meet the more stringent criteria of posterior probability >0.95 (closed circles in Figure 2). These sites are
also identified with high confidence under a Bayes

Empirical Bayes model [26]. Despite the long history of
IL4 evolution sampled here, several positions are either
invariant or very similar in eutherian mammals (highlighted with asterisks and dots, respectively).
IL4 folds into a 4-helix bundle structure similar to
that of GMCSF, IL2 and IL5 [6]. The structural epitope
for IL4Ra binding (called site 1) is large (1560 Å), comprising a mosaic of 18 residues contributed by alpha
helices A, B and C and mediates high affinity binding
(Kd ~ 1 nM) [6,13]. Directly adjacent to site 1 is a 1070
Å site 2 epitope for gc binding comprising 10 residues
contributed by alpha helices A and D [6,13]. The
IL13Ra1 subunit found in the Type II IL4 receptor
expressed on non-hematopoietic cells binds to a distinct
740 Å site 3 epitope comprising 8 residues contributed
by loops connecting helices A-B and C-D on the IL4
face opposite site 1 [13]. Both the gc and IL13Ra1 subunits exhibit low affinity for the binary IL4/IL4Ra complex (Kd ~ 500 nM) and even lower (mM) affinity for

soluble IL4. Accordingly, a two-step model has been
proposed for IL4 binding to its Type I and II receptors
[6,13]. In an initial 3D reaction, IL4Ra binds with high
affinity to soluble IL4 via the site 1 epitope. In a second
2D reaction restricted to the plane of the cell membrane, the binary IL4/IL4Ra complex binds gc in the
Type I receptor or IL13Ra1 in the Type II receptor via
site 2 or site 3, respectively [6,13].
Strikingly, positively selected residues cluster in two
groups (Figures 2 and 3) that overlap site 1 (highlighted
in red) and site 3 (highlighted in magenta) epitopes.
That clustering occurs at the IL4 ligand:receptor interface could suggest that sequence variation was driven by
selective pressure to modulate signaling intensity. Alternatively, sequence variation may be driven by pathogen
antagonism to directly interfere with IL4: IL4Ra interactions; in the latter case, sequence variation would be

expected to be functionally neutral for ligand:receptor
interactions so as to avoid disadvantageous perturbations to normal IL4 signaling. To distinguish between
these possibilities, we decided to test the functional consequences of sequence variation for IL4: IL4Ra interactions, focusing on recently diverged murine homologs of
IL4 that had alterations specifically at their receptor
interacting residues.
Clustered intra-specific variation at the IL4 site 1 epitope
is functionally neutral for IL4Ra binding and signalling

We compared the murine sub-species M. musculus
(strain BALB/c) and M. castaneus (strain CAST/Ei) and
discovered 5 amino acid sequence changes between
them (Additional File 1). To infer the spatial distribution
of the 5 polymorphic residues we aligned human and
mouse IL4 sequences and mapped orthologous residues

onto the human IL4 protein structure (PDB ID: 1HIK)
(Figure 3). Strikingly, the 5 polymorphic residues (Figure
4: Mouse D2, K3, R8, F90, R91 and human K2, C3, Q8,
N89, L90; Table 2, numbering from NP_067258)
mapped either in or adjacent to the IL4Ra-binding site
1 epitope.
To test whether naturally arising variation in site 1 residues is functionally relevant with respect to IL4Ra interactions, we expressed and purified recombinant BALB/c
and CAST/Ei IL4 for biophysical and functional studies.
To determine the affinity of IL4Ra for BALB/c and
CAST/Ei IL4, we measured surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) using a Biacore apparatus. Purified M. musculus
IL4Ra extracellular domain [27] was immobilized on an
SPR chip and graded doses of recombinant IL4 were
passed in the mobile phase over the chip. Surprisingly,
BALB/c and CAST/Ei IL4 bound IL4Ra with similar
affinity (Kd ~200 pM,) and kinetic on and off rates
(Table 2 and Additional File 2), in good agreement with
previously published measurements [6,13].
Next, we sought to determine whether, despite sharing
similar binding affinity for IL4Ra, BALB/c and CAST/Ei
IL4 might differ in their ability to signal IL4-dependent
biological responses. Mouse B and T cells fail to express
IL13a1 and therefore express only the Type I IL4 receptor [28], ensuring their readouts will be sensitive to
IL4Ra interactions. First, we compared the capacity of
BALB/c and CAST/Ei IL4 to signal B cells to upregulate
cell surface expression of CD23, a well-established IL4dependent response [29-31]. Over a 1000 fold dynamic
range we detected no difference in the ability of BALB/c
and CAST/Ei IL4 to signal CD23 upregulation, regardless whether the responding cells were of BALB/c or
CAST/Ei origin (Figure 5). As IL4 is also a B and T cell
growth factor [32], we tested its relative capacity to
induce cellular proliferation. As with upregulation of
cell surface molecules, BALB/c and CAST/Ei IL4 elicited
identical proliferative responses from both B and T cells
(Figure 5A and 5B), again regardless whether the
responding cells were of BALB/c or CAST/Ei origin.
Taken together, these results indicate that naturally arising genetic variation in IL4 residues mapping to the site

1 epitope is functionally neutral with regard to IL4Ra
binding and biological signalling.
Our finding that intra-specific changes in IL4 were
functionally neutral for IL4 receptor binding suggests a
high degree of redundancy and therefore relaxed constraint at the ligand:receptor interface. This is at
apparent odds with our evidence for diversifying selection acting at 3 of 5 site 1 epitope residues polymorphic between M. musculus and M. castaneus
(Figures 2 and 6). Similar failures to detect functional
ramifications of variation at sites identified as subject
to recurrent diversifying selection were reported
recently in studies of environmental adaptation –
detection of light wavelengths by rhodopsin [33] and
odors by an odorant receptor [34]. However, selective
episodes driving environmental adaptation are
expected to be of low frequency and intensity, leaving
variants associated with very subtle functional ramifications. By contrast, selective episodes driven by classical
Red-Queen host:pathogen conflicts are expected to be
of high frequency and intensity, leaving variants associated with robust functional ramifications [35]. Importantly, this rapid evolution would be expected at host:
pathogen not host:host interfaces, entirely consistent
with our functional data. Given that PAML methods
[23] and especially clustering of residues subject to
diversifying selection have proven diagnostic not only
of antagonism but also of host specificity determinants
[19,20,36,37], and given the important role played by
IL4 in host protection from helminths, it is likely that
the evolutionary signatures we have discovered point
to a previously hidden mode of pathogen antagonism,
although the identity of this antagonist(s) currently
remains unknown.

Discussion
Our analyses are consistent with previous studies that
used human population genetics and SNP association to
suggest that IL4 and IL4Ra have experienced recent episodes of diversifying selection [15,17]. Additional support comes from a recent phylogenetic sequence
analysis comparing human, primate and mouse that
detected signatures of diversifying selection (high R/S
values) for IL4 and other gc-dependent cytokines (IL2,
IL7, IL9, IL15 and IL21). Based upon the failure to
detect a similar signature of diversifying selection in gc
itself, the authors proposed that cytokine selection was
driven by mutual competition for gc, a common receptor subunit for each cytokine [25]. Consistent with
O’Connell et al [25], we did not detect positively
selected codon positions in the IL4 gc-binding site 2 epitope. However, the prediction that flows from the
O’Connell hypothesis – that IL4 variants differing in
positively selected residues would bind with differential

affinity to IL4Ra – is not borne out by our functional
data.
The earliest support for IL4 having evolved under
diversifying selection comes from pair-wise analyses of
mouse and rat IL4 and IL4Ra that detected elevated R/
S ratios in the receptor-binding region of IL4 and the
extracellular (but not cytoplasmic) domain of IL4Ra
[18,38]. The authors of those studies concluded diversifying selection of IL4 was driven by co-evolution of the

receptor/ligand pair [18,38]. But, co-evolutionary forces
tend to impede rather than facilitate evolutionary
changes at protein-protein interaction surfaces.
We propose instead that genetic conflict (for example,
recurrent adaptation to escape pathogen antagonism) is
most consistent with such evolutionary signatures. We
have found that IL4 has evolved under strong and recurrent diversifying selection focused at 15 positions (with a
NEB criteria). Twelve of these fall in or near the site 1

epitope comprising the IL4Ra binding interface. Two
more positively selected residues form a second cluster
falling in or near the site 3 IL13Ra1-binding epitope
used by the Type II IL4 receptor. From an evolutionary
perspective the interaction interface of IL4 with its
receptor is an ideal antagonist target as it is likely to be
functionally constrained, necessitating escape from
antagonism to require coordinated changes in both IL4
and its receptor. It is tempting to speculate that pathogen antagonism has specifically targeted IL4 complexed
with the non-hematopoietic Type II IL4 receptor (that
lacks gc), as would be the case for gut and lung resident
helminths confronting Type II IL4 receptor-dependent
expulsatory effector mechanisms triggered by IL4 activation of intestinal and lung epithelia [39,40].
A functional comparison of two intra-specific murine
IL4 proteins allowed a direct evaluation of the functional consequences of variation at positively selected
codon positions without the confounding changes that
may occur due to epistasis over long evolutionary divergences (wherein functional consequences of changes at
one position might have been buffered or masked by
evolutionary changes in another). Our discovery that
genetic variation at three such positively selected residues in murine IL4 is functionally neutral with respect
to both IL4Ra binding and signaling suggests that the
IL4 site 1 epitope displays a remarkable degree of evolutionary flexibility to accommodate changes in sequence
to escape (inferred) antagonism by parasite-encoded
proteins while maintaining interaction with its receptor.
Approximately 80% of the IL4Ra binding energy for
IL4 comes from interactions with a core of 2 residues
(Figure 3 and 6; E9 and R88) [41]. Interestingly, these
two residues are not invariant in mammalian evolution,
which is what might have been expected if this interface
were not subject to antagonism [42] (Figures 1 and 6).
Consistent with our hypothesis, alanine scanning mutational analysis has shown that the remaining 16 residues
comprising the site 1 epitope and collectively accounting
for the remaining binding energy can accommodate significant amino acid changes without destroying IL4Ra
binding [6,41,43]. This arrangement may serve to buffer
ligand/receptor allelic polymorphism, thereby creating a
reservoir of subtly modified interfaces upon which diversifying selection can act to efficiently identify IL4 variants that have lost the ability to interact with parasitederived IL4-binding molecules. Indeed, we can argue
that constant antagonism of this interaction interface
may have itself selected for this highly diffuse interaction surface; the more diffuse or flexible the IL4-IL4Ra
interaction, the easier it would be to emerge victorious
from an evolutionary episode of Darwinian selection
against an antagonist. It will be interesting to determine
whether, like the site 1 epitope used by the IL4Ra

Page 10 of 13

subunit, the site 3 epitope will be able to tolerate amino
acid variation without perturbing IL13Ra1 binding.

Conclusions
We posit that the striking signature of diversifying selection coupled with the absence of a functional consequence on the IL4:IL4Ra interaction provides strong
evidence for the existence of a pathogen antagonist that
shapes IL4 evolution. A precedent for our hypothesis
comes from a case study of Protein Kinase R (PKR) and
its highly conserved substrate eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a). Pathogen mimics of
eIF2a can antagonize the eIF2a:PKR interaction. A key
to escape this antagonism may be the evolution of a
highly flexible PKR epitope responsible for recognition
of eIF2a [19,37]. Similarly, we propose that frequent
and intense pathogen antagonism may have fixed an
interaction strategy based upon the buffered epitope
that characterizes the interaction of IL4 with IL4Ra
(and, perhaps, also of IL4:IL4Ra with IL13Ra1) [4].
Numerous other immune protein:protein interactions
bear striking resemblance to the diffuse flexible IL4 site
1 epitope that binds IL4Ra. It is interesting to speculate
that these interfaces also have been borne out of evolutionary conflicts to escape pathogen subversion. Validation of this scenario awaits discovery of a pathogen
(helminth)-derived immune antagonist molecule capable
of binding and neutralizing IL4. Based on the location
of positively selected residues, it would not be surprising
if this antagonist were a mimic of either IL4 or IL4Ra
[4,19].
Methods
Evolutionary comparison of IL4 across mammals and
primates

We used TBLASTN and BLASTN searches [44] using
either the mouse or human IL4 protein to identify all
full-length eutherian mammal IL4 sequences in either
nr (non-redundant), wgs (whole genome shotgun), est
(expressed sequence tags) or htgs (high throughput genome sequencing) databases. These sequences were
translated and the amino acid sequences aligned using
CLUSTAL_X [45]. The amino acid alignments were
then converted to nucleotide alignments using the
PAL2NAL program [46]. Neighbor-joining phylogenies
based on the nucleotide alignment were constructed and
bootstrapped using the CLUSTAL_X program. Using
the ‘Model Selection’ tool on the online HyPhy server
(http://www.datamonkey.org), we first identified the
appropriate nucleotide substitution model, in this
instance HKY85. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed and bootstrap analyses performed using the
PhyML program [47,48] and either HKY85 or GTR
models of nucleotide substitution [49]. Both models of

Koyanagi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:223
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/223

nucleotide substitutions gave identical results with
PhyML. Trees were visualized using the Dendroscope
Program [50]. This nucleotide alignment (that honors
codon definitions) was used as an input for tests of
diversifying selection. We used both an alignment of 28
mammalian representatives and 16 simian primates
alone for our analysis. Both these alignments are presented in Additional Files 3 and 4.
We tested the dataset for evidence of recombination
using two programs in the HyPhy suite [51] (http://
www.datamonkey.org[52]): GARD and SBP [53]. Neither
program found evidence for any recombination in the
IL4 dataset (cAIC criterion for SBP). Predictions of individual codons that evolved under diversifying selection
were performed by maximum likelihood using NSsites
model comparisons in PAML [23]. To identify diversifying selection, we required a significant difference in log
likelihoods, by chi-squared testing, between nested
PAML models M7 and M8. Model M7 allows codons to
have dN/dS values according to a beta distribution (two
parameters). Model M8 is the same as M7 except that it
adds a discrete category of dN/dS with dN/dS >1. Significance of diversifying selection was tested by comparing twice the difference in log likelihoods (2lnl)
between M7 and M8 with two degrees of freedom.
Codons predicted to be under diversifying selection
were identified by Naïve-Empirical-Bayes (NEB) and
Bayes-Empirical-Bayes (BEB) analysis. Lineage-specific
evidence for diversifying selection was performed using
free-ratio analysis in PAML. In this instance, although
some branches did exhibit dN/dS >1, the free-ratio
model was not a better fit to the data than a single dN/
dS ratio for the entire IL4 phylogeny.
BALB/c and CAST/Ei Il4 cDNA

BALB/c and CAST/Ei IL4 cDNAs were prepared from
Th2 cells from spleen and lymph nodes of BALB/c and
CAST/Ei mice as described [54]. Total RNA was
recovered using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) on day 6 of culture, following 4 hour restimulation with PMA (5 ng/ml) and ionomycin (250 ng/
ml). Random hexamer-primed cDNA was generated
using the Superscript II RNase H-reverse Transcriptase
kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on resulting
cDNA in 50 ul with 0.3 uM of primer (forward primer:
5’-cacagagctagtgatgggtct-3’; reverse primer: 5’ggtggctcagtactacgagtaa-3’), 320 uM dNTP, 1.25 U
AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 1×
reaction buffer in a PTC-225 thermocycler (MJ
Research) using the following profile: 35 cycles of 2
min 94°C, 15 sec 94°C, 30 sec 60°C, 2 min 68°C, followed by 5 min 68°C. 3’ terminal adenosines were
added to amplicons by incubating at 72°C for 10 min

Page 11 of 13

in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase (1 U) and 2
nmol dNTP. Amplicons were cloned into pCRII-TOPO
cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced.
IL4 structural modelling

Polymorphic and positively selected residues were
mapped onto the crystal structures of human free IL4
(1HIK), type I (3BPL) and type II IL4 receptor complexes (3BPN) using PyMol (DeLano, W.L. The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System (2002) on World Wide Web
http://www.pymol.org).
Surface plasmon resonance analysis of IL4/IL4Ra binding

Binding affinity of recombinant BALB/c and CAST/Ei
IL4 (Additional Files 5, 6, 7 for purification details) to
C57BL/6 IL4Ra (R&D Systems Inc) was determined by
surface plasmon resonance detection using a BIAcore
2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Approximately 1400 RUs of IL4Ra was immobilized on a CM5
biosensor chip using amine linkage based on the manufacture’s recommendation (GE Biosciences). Degassed
HEPES balanced salt running buffer [HBS: 10 mM
HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005%
P-20 surfactant, (HBS-EP)] was used for immobilization,
analyte dilutions and binding assays. The system was set
to run at 25°C at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. To accommodate for the solvent bulk shift associated with IL4 dilution (coming from PBS) into HBS-EP, PBS and HBS-EP
were mixed in the same dilutions and run on the
machine. Graphs generated from the “blank” run were
subtracted from graphs generated from IL4-containing
runs. These adjustments and kinetic analyses were performed using the BIAevaluation Software ver. 3. Rate
constants were calculated by applying the graphs to a
1:1 Langmuir binding algorithm. A two-minute pulse
with 10 mM glycine pH 2.75 was used to regenerate the
ligand/analyte.
Cell purification

B cells were T cell-depleted splenocytes prepared by
complement-mediated lysis using anti-Thy1 (J1j; American Type Culture Collection) and a combination of rabbit and guinea pig complement. As determined by FACS
analysis, B cell purity from BALB/c and CAST/Ei
spleens was typically 85% and 66%, respectively. CD4 T
cell-enriched splenocytes were prepared by complement-mediated lysis using anti-CD8 (3.155; American
Type Culture Collection), anti-HSA (J11d; American
Type Culture Collection), anti-MHC class II (BP107;
American Type Culture Collection) and a combination
of rabbit and guinea pig complement. As determined by
FACS analysis, T cell purity from BALB/c and CAST/Ei
spleens was typically >91%.

B cell CD23 upregulation assay

B cells were distributed to 24 well plates containing
graded concentrations of recombinant BALB/c or
CAST/Ei IL4 and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours prior
to staining with PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD23 Ab
(B3B4, eBioscience) and flow cytometric analysis.
B and T cell proliferation assay

Serially diluted recombinant BALB/c or CAST/Ei IL4
was added to 96 well plates containing either 1 × 105 B
cell-enriched splenocytes and 50 ng/ml of LPS (B cells)
or 1 × 105 CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes (T cells) in
200 ul RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FCS, 50 μM b-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine,
and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. AlamarBlue
(20 ul, BioSource International) was added at 24 hr and
at 48 hr the extent of its reduction was determined by
comparing absorption of control and test culture media
at 570 nm and 600 nm. AlamarBlue reduction (AR570)
was calculated as: AR570 = A570 - A600 where A570
and A600 are sample absorbances minus a media blank.
