Abstract
Background: DNA repair genes provide an important contribution towards the surveillance and repair
of DNA damage. These genes produce a large network of interacting proteins whose mRNA expression is
likely to be regulated by similar regulatory factors. Full characterization of promoters of DNA repair genes
and the similarities among them will more fully elucidate the regulatory networks that activate or inhibit
their expression. To address this goal, the authors introduce a technique to find regulatory genomic
signatures, which represents a specific application of the genomic signature methodology to classify DNA
sequences as putative functional elements within a single organism.
Results: The effectiveness of the regulatory genomic signatures is demonstrated via analysis of promoter
sequences for genes in DNA repair pathways of humans. The promoters are divided into two classes, the
bidirectional promoters and the unidirectional promoters, and distinct genomic signatures are calculated
for each class. The genomic signatures include statistically overrepresented words, word clusters, and cooccurring words. The robustness of this method is confirmed by the ability to identify sequences that exist
as motifs in TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, and in overlap with verified binding sites in this set of
promoter regions.
Conclusion: The word-based signatures are shown to be effective by finding occurrences of known
regulatory sites. Moreover, the signatures of the bidirectional and unidirectional promoters of human DNA
repair pathways are clearly distinct, exhibiting virtually no overlap. In addition to providing an effective
characterization method for related DNA sequences, the signatures elucidate putative regulatory aspects
of DNA repair pathways, which are notably under-characterized.

Background
Genomic signature techniques were originally developed
for identifying organism-specific characterizations [1,2].
Genomic signature methods carry the limitation that they
were not designed for sub-categorization of sequences
from within a single organism. To address this shortcoming, the authors present genomic signature techniques
that can be used to identify regulatory signatures, i.e. to
classify DNA sequences regarding related biological units
within an organism, such as particular functions, pathways
and tissues.
The term genomic signature was introduced by Karlin and
Burge to refer to a function characterizing genomes based
on compositional variation [2]. Karlin and others showed
that a di-nucleotide odds-ratio was an effective genomic
signature. In addition to the odds ratio, oligonucleotide
frequencies (as n-mers) and machine learning methods
have been employed to classify sequences based on their
organism of origin [1,3-20], and to identify unique features of genomic data sets. Such approaches were effectively employed in a more refined focus examining tissuespecific categorization of regulatory sequences in liver or
muscle [21-24].
Here, the authors employ a word-based genomic signature method. That is, given a group of related sequences, a
set of characteristic subsequences is discovered. Each subsequence is called a genomic word. The set of characteristic
subsequences and their attributes constitute a word-based
genomic signature. It is hypothesized that each functionally
related group of sequences has a detectable word-based
signature, consisting of multiple genomic words. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the genomic words that constitute a word-based genomic signature are functional
genomic elements. Unlike most existing types of genomic
signatures, a word-based genomic signature provides
insights that are directly applicable to the problem of
identifying functional DNA elements, because the words
identify putative transcription factor binding sites.
The authors have identified two primary components of
word-based genomic signatures that are useful for characterizing a set of related genomic sequences, RGS. The set
of statistically overrepresented words that can be derived
from RGS can be regarded as a word-based signature
(SIG1) since it provides information about the complete
set of potential control elements regulating the set of RGS.
A second signature (SIG2) provides a set of words related
to the elements of SIG1. The similarity between the sets
can be measured based on evolutionary distance metrics,
e.g. hamming and edit distance (also called Levenshtein
distance, see Methods). In addition to SIG1 and SIG2 several post-processing steps built upon the two word-based
signatures are undertaken to create the final regulatory

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S18

genomic signature. These post-processing steps include
sequence clustering, co-occurrence analysis, biological significance analysis, and a conservation analysis.
DNA repair genes represent a large network of genes that
respond to DNA damage within a cell. Discrete pathways
for DNA repair responses have been identified in the Reactome database [25]. A discernable feature among genes in
these pathways is the promoter architecture. A large percentage of genes with DNA repair functions are regulated
by bidirectional promoters [26,27], whereas the rest are
regulated by unidirectional promoters. Bidirectional promoters fall between the DNA repair gene and a partner
gene that is transcribed in the opposite direction. The
close proximity of the 5' ends of this pair of genes facilitates the initiation of transcription of both genes, creating
two transcription forks that advance in opposite directions. DNA repair genes rarely share bidirectional promoters with other DNA repair genes. Rather, they are paired
with genes of diverse functions [26].
The formal definition of a bidirectional promoter requires
that the initiation sites of the genes are spaced no more
than 1000 bp from one another. Using these criteria the
authors have comprehensively annotated the human and
mouse genomes for the presence of bidirectional promoters, using in silico approaches [26,28]. Bidirectional promoters utilized repeatedly in the genome are known to
regulate genes of a specific function [26] and serve as prototypes for complete promoter sequences for computational studies- i.e., one can deduce the full intergenic
region because exons flank each side. These promoters
represent a class of regulatory elements with a common
architecture, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism
could be employed among them. Recent molecular studies confirm that RNA PolII can dock at promoters while
simultaneously facing both directions [29], rather than
being restricted to a single direction.
DNA repair genes are likely to play a universal role in
damage repair, therefore mutations that affect their regulation will become important diagnostic indicators in disease discovery. The authors have previously shown that
bidirectional promoters regulate genes with characterized
roles in both DNA repair and ovarian cancer [28]. A more
detailed analysis of the regulatory motifs within this subset of promoters will address regulatory mechanisms controlling transcription of this important set of genes. This
paper presents word-based genomic regulatory signatures
based on statistically overrepresented oligonucleotides (68 mers) found in unidirectional and bidirectional promoters of genes in DNA repair pathways. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using signatures for

classifying biologically related DNA sequences. The oligonucleotides that comprise the signatures match known
binding motifs from TRANSFAC [30] or JASPAR [31] databases. Furthermore, some examples overlap and agree
with experimentally validated regulatory functions.

Results
The effectiveness of genomic regulatory signatures that are
based on SIG1 and SIG2 was addressed by analyzing promoter sequences for genes in DNA repair pathways of
humans. The promoters were divided into two classes, the
bidirectional promoters and the unidirectional promoters, and distinct genomic signatures were calculated for
each class. The human DNA repair pathways included 32
bidirectional promoters and 42 unidirectional promoters.
Bidirectional promoters had a GC content ranging
between 47.55% and 77.09% with an average of 59.87%
while unidirectional promoters varied from 38.00% to
68.09%, averaging 50.84%.
Statistically overrepresented words
For each set of promoters, the statistically overrepresented
words were identified. The top 25 overrepresented 8-mer
words for each dataset are presented in Tables 1a and 1b,
respectively (See Additional file 1 and Additional file 2 for
the complete lists of words discovered in the bidirectional
and unidirectional promoter set respectively). Each word
is presented as an observed number or a statistical expectation, respectively, including the number of sequences
the word is contained in (S or ES), the number of overall

occurrences of the word (0 or ES), and a score measuring

overrepresentation for the word ⎛ S * ln S ⎞ . Addi⎜

⎠
tional information such as reverse complement words,
their relative positions in the list of top words, palindromic words, and p-values assessing the statistical relevance
of the appearance of the word are also presented. A comparison of Tables 1a and 1b reveals that the characteristic
words for the two sets are distinct, with no overlaps. The
significance of the selected 25 words can be seen by comparing their scores and p-values to the scores and p-values
for all words, which are plotted in Figures 1 and 2).
Missing words
The dataset of bidirectional promoters and unidirectional
promoters contained 21,076 and 22,101 unique words of
length 8, respectively, out of 65,536 unique possibilities.
Thus, in each set, more than 43,000 possible words did
not occur (See Additional file 3 and Additional file 4 for
the complete lists of non-occurring words). The missing
words in each set were enumerated, and ranked in

descending order by their ES values. The top 25 missing
words are shown in Tables 2a and 2b.
The scatterplot of the ES values for all missing words is
shown in Figure 3; note the outlier values, which correspond with the words in Tables 2a and 2b. The utility of
using missing words as regulatory signatures, as reported
in the literature [32,33], was consistent with the observation of no overlapping words between bidirectional and
unidirectional promoter sets.
Word-based clusters
For the top 2 overrepresented words, clusters were created
using two different distance metrics, hamming distance
and edit distance (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, See Additional File 5,
6, 7, 8 for the complete lists of hamming distance and edit
distance based clusters for bidirectional and unidirectional promoters). Each table contains the set of words
that clustered around a given 'seed' word. A comparison of
the sequence logos for the hamming-distance-based clusters, presented in (Figures 4, 5), shows no overlap
between the two promoter sets. Similarly, no overlap
existed for clusters based on edit-distance (Figures 6, 7).
Sequence-based clusters
Sequences can be clustered and categorized into different
families (and subfamilies). The sequence-based clusters
presented here are restricted to two promoters per cluster.
Sequence clustering is a measure of the co-existence of statistically overrepresented words shared between pairs of
promoters as shown in Tables 7a,b. Each cluster contains
IDs for the sequences that make up the cluster and the
number of overrepresented words not shared within the
cluster (distance). Sequences in each set were grouped
into clusters based on the set of statistically overrepresented words. The shared words for the top-scoring
sequence cluster of each data set were illustrated using the
GBrowse environment [34] (Figures 8, 9). The visualization shows a strong positional correlation between the
sequences of the top sequence cluster for the bidirectional
promoters (Word: GCCCAGCC) and minor correlation
between the sequences for the unidirectional promoters
(Words: AGCAGGGC, GCAGGGCG).
Word co-occurrence
The promoter sets were characterized further by word cooccurrence analysis, in which word-pairs that appeared
together more frequently than expected were identified.
Interesting pairs of words were selected from the overrepresented words of Table 1 (Table 8a,b). Each word pair
was characterized as the number of observed or expected
occurrences for the word combination (S or ES) and a sta-

regulatory signatures can be used to describe promoter
sets based on their uniqueness.
Regulatory Database Lookup
We developed a method [35] to determine if these signatures matched any known motifs from TRANSFAC or JASPAR (Table 11). The words from bidirectional promoters
matched known motifs in 8/10 cases, with the words from
unidirectional promoters matching known motifs in 8/10
cases as well. Compared to the consensus sequences of the
known motifs, the matches were off by no more than one
letter. Some of the matches corresponded to nucleotide
profiles determined from collections of phylogenetically
conserved, cis-acting regulatory elements [36]. Imperfect
matches resulted from bases that flanked the core motifs
(Table 11a, b) (see also [37]). Such events decreased the
detection score to slightly above the threshold of 85%
similarity. Overall, the findings in Table 11 validate that
the signatures have biological relevance and suggest that
the remaining signatures, which do not match known
motifs could represent novel binding sites.
Conservation analysis
To address selective constraint in the word sets, sequence
conservation was examined for pairs of co-occurring
words. The top ten word-pairs from the unidirectional
and bidirectional datasets were examined in 28-way
sequence alignments using the PhastCons [38] dataset in
the UCSC Human Genome Browser [39]. The results are

presented in Table 12. The bidirectional promoters
revealed 9/10 word sets had a record of sequence conservation in one or both words (Table 12a). The analysis of
the unidirectional promoters, presented in Table 12b,
showed partial conservation in only one of the wordpairs.
Biological implications
The words in the list of bidirectional promoters were
examined for known biological evidence. For instance,
the gene POLH has a known binding motif, TCCCGGGA,
annotated as a PAX-6 binding site in the cis-RED database
http://www.cisred.org/. This is the same sequence as the
second most common word in the bidirectional promoters. Along with sequences that cluster with this word, we
found that 19/32 genes in the bidirectional promoter set
had a match to this word cluster (cluster 2) within 1 kb of
their TSS, while 15/32 bidirectional promoters had a
match to the words of cluster 1. Furthermore, this word
also represents a Stat5A recognition site (Table 11). The
RAD51 gene, which is known to be regulated by STAT5A,
showed two examples from this word cluster (TGCCGGGA and TCCCGGGC).
Limitations of the approach
The presented approach does not attempt to automate the
process of finding a small set of regulatory elements for a
limited set of related genomic signatures like MEME [40]
or AlignACE [41]. The different approach presented here
produces more detailed information outside of the lim

ited list by showing a larger (complete) set of words that
are ranked based on their statistical significance. Additionally, word- and sequence-based clusters, word cooccurrences and functional significance of the words have
been computed as a means of adding more detail to the
retrieval of putative elements allowing a more informed
interpretation of the actual regulatory function of a word.

Conclusion
This paper presents a word-based genomic signature that
characterizes a set of sequences with (1) statistically overrepresented words, (2) missing words, (3) word-based
clusters, (4) sequence-based clusters and (5) co-occurring
words. The word-based signatures of bidirectional and
unidirectional promoters of human DNA repair pathways
showed virtually no overlap, thereby demonstrating the
signature's utility.
In addition to providing an effective characterization
method for related DNA sequences, the signatures elucidate putative regulatory aspects of DNA repair pathways.

Genes in DNA repair pathways contribute to diverse functions such as sensing DNA damage and transducing the
signal, participating in DNA repair pathways, cell cycle
signalling, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The
synchronization of these functions implies co-regulatory
relationships of the promoters of these genes to ensure the
adequate production of all the necessary components in
the pathway. We present a subtle, yet detectable signature
for bidirectional promoters of DNA repair genes. The consensus patterns, detected as words and related clusters of
words, provide a DNA pattern that is strongly represented
in these promoters. Although the proteins that bind these
sequences must be examined experimentally, the data
show that a protein such as STAT5A could be involved in
regulating many of these promoters. STAT5A has biological relevance in DNA repair pathways, playing a known
role in the regulation of the RAD51 gene. We propose that
this initial study of a network of DNA repair genes serve as
a model for studies that examine regulatory networks. As
the relationships among genes involved in DNA repair
pathways are elucidated more thoroughly, the analyses of

their regulatory relationships will gain more power to
detect a larger number of DNA words that are shared in
common among the network of genes. The results of this
analysis are supported by evidence of sequence conservation and overlap between predicted sites and known functional elements.

Methods
Two fundamental elements of word-based genomic signatures are created with the approach presented in [42,43].
SIG1 identifies the set of statistically overrepresented
words, while SIG2 represents a set of words from SIG1
that is in itself similar to the elements of SIG1, based on a
specific distance measure.
The set SIG1 is computed as described in [42,43], which
is summarized as follows:
1. Identify maximally repeated words of length [m, n].
2. Remove low complexity words, redundant words,
and words that are contained in repeat elements.

3. For each word compute a 'score' that characterizes
the statistical overrepresentation of the word.
4. Select the words with the highest scores.
The set SIG2 is found by taking each of the elements of
SIG1 and performing 'word clustering'. For each word w ∈
SIG1, this involves a two-step process:
1. Construct a set (cluster) of words from RGS that
have a 'distance' of no more than h from word w.
Hamming distance and edit distance are used for this
step.
2. Construct a motif that characterizes the set of words
found in step 1.
Word-based signature (SIG1)
As the foundation of the signature generation it is necessary to compute the set of distinct words Wwc in a set of
input sequences S. In order to determine the statistical significance of w ∈ Wwc it is necessary to count the total

number of occurrences of a given word wj, oj, as well as the
number of sequences containing the word, sj. The occurrence information is modelled as a set of tuples . Assuming a binomial model for the distribution of words across
the input sequences, it is possible to model the total
occurrence of a word w by introducing the random variable , where l is the complete sequence length, v the length
of w, and Yi a binary random variable indicating if a word
occurs at position i, or not, leading to the series of yes/no
Bernoulli experiments. An expected value for the specific

number of occurrences for a word w can then be computed as where pw is the probability of word w. Following
a similar modelling approach, the expected number of
sequences a word occurs in is given by . The actual probabilities are determined by a homogenous Markov chain
model of a specific order m. Based on the expected values
we compute multiple scores for each word:

• S(w) * ln

(

S( w)
E S ( w)

) : This scoring function, called

SlnSES, enables the inclusion of sequence coverage
into the score. A highly scored word occurs in a large
percentage of sequences in the data set. It does not
necessarily have to be highly significant if the overall
number of occurrences is taken into account, but it is
of particular use for the discovery of shared regulatory
elements across multiple sequences.
• p-Value: The p-value is defined as the probability of
obtaining at least as many words as the actual
observed number of words:

∑

⎛ lj − v +1⎞ i
l j − v +1−i
⎜
⎟ p w (1 − p w )
i
⎝
⎠

, where |S| represents the number of sequences in S
and lj is the length of sequence j.
Word-based clusters (SIG2)
Two methods are employed for the detection of similarities between the words that make up SIG1: hamming distance and Levenshtein distance (also called edit distance).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S1/S18

While hamming distance is defined as the number of
positions for which the corresponding characters of two
words of the same length differ, edit distance allows the
comparison of different length words and accounts for
three edit operations (insert, delete and substitute), rather
than the plain mismatch (corresponds to substitute)
employed by the hamming distance.
The biological reasoning for employing distance metrics
in order to group similar words together can be found in
the evolution of sequences. A biological structure is constantly exposed to mutation pressure. These mutations
can occur as insertions, deletions or substitutions, however insertions and deletions are deleterious in most cases,
leading to the issue that edit distance provides a very
detailed model of the mutations but hamming distance is
a reasonable abstraction and will work well for this case.
The motif logos for the hamming distance clusters were
constructed using the TFBS Perl module by Lenhard and
Wasserman [44]. ClustalW2 [45] was used to align the
words of the edit distance clusters.
Sequence clustering
The sequence clustering conducted in this research is
focussed on the words shared between element of a set of
sequences. A set of words is taken as the input for the clustering. A binary vector si = (si,1, si,2,..., si, k) for each
sequence si is created, marking an element si, k where k is
the number of words used to distinguish the sequences
with k ≤ |Wwc|. The element si, k of the vector is populated
with a '1' if the word k is found in sequence i, and '0' if it
is not. The similarity between sequences is determined by
the dot product between the binary sequence vectors, and
is deducted from the complete number of words in the
vector space. In order to determine the distance between k
sequences (with k ≥ 2), the dot product is extended to
accommodate multiple sequences.

The cluster with the smallest distance is visualized using

sequences contained in the cluster, the words pertaining
to SIG1 are displayed.

Edit distance cluster for unidirectional promoters.
Sequence logos corresponding to the word-based clusters of
the top 2 overrepresented words of the unidirectional promoters. Rank 1 (a) is corresponding to the word
ACCCGCCT, while Rank 2 (b) refers to CTTCTTTC.

Biological significance (lookup)
Once genomic signatures are identified, the next step is to
discern their biological role. One important aspect of this
role, crucial to understanding gene regulation [46], is the
location of the preferred binding sites for certain proteins
(transcription factor binding sites or TFBSs). To locate

Table 7: Sequence clusters (pairs of sequences). Sequence clusters containing pairs of sequences for the bidirectional (a) and
unidirectional (b) promoter sets. Each sequence occurs in only one cluster. The sequences are clustered based on the number of
words (within the top 60 overrepresented words) that are shared between them with the distance denoting the number of words not
shared between them.

these sites, the signatures are compared to a set of known
binding sites, which are usually represented as weighted
matrices [47]. However, a simple scoring scheme can misclassify results when applied to the typically short
sequences produced by signature finders. In this simple
approach, short signatures are aligned to each matrix by
ignoring the parts of the matrices that are longer than the
signature. This results in erroneous scores since a signature could match just the very end of large matrix, which
is often of little significance (the core of the matrix generally represents the sites of strongest binding).

TFBSs meeting the desired threshold in every sequence,
and subsequently uses this information to quickly score
the signatures. As a benefit, the list of TFBS can be reused
to quickly score new signatures or to redo the analysis
with interesting subsets of sequences, such as all
sequences which in liver cells are highly expressed.

To give a more significant measure of similarity, we developed a tool that uses a window around the original
sequences (those which the signature is based upon) to
improve the comparison. The naive implementation of
this approach is to use a window of base pairs around
each signature and find the optimal alignment to each
TFBS matrix by scoring every possible sub-sequence containing the signature. For instance, if a signature is located
10 times within the set of sequences, each matrix is
aligned to each of the 10 loci containing the signatures.
Our tool uses a faster approach; it finds all occurrences of

Co-occurrence analysis
The co-occurrence analysis aims to determine the
expected number of sequences containing a given pair of
not necessarily distinct words at least once. If n denotes

number of sequences containing a given pair of words can
be calculated as:

in the co-occurrence analysis.

Conservation analysis
Sequence conservation was mapped using PhastCons
conservation scores [38] calculated on 28 species, which
are based on a two-state (conserved state vs. Non-conserved region) phylo-HMM. PhastCons scores were
obtained from the UCSC Human Genome Browser [39].
The scores reported by the UCSC Human Genome
Browser contain transformed log-odds scores, ranging
from 0–1000. Conserved regions were required to cover
the majority of the word length.
Comparison
Words can have significantly different scores for each of
the data sets in which they occur. In order to analyze the
words based on their impact on the data sets it is useful to
assign a distance metric that determines which data set is
described best by a given word.

Based on a graphical analysis, three points of interest can
be determined: the point where the perpendicular of a
given point on the x-axis crosses the main diagonal, the
point where the perpendicular of a given point on the
main diagonal crosses the main diagonal and finally the
point where the perpendicular from a given point on the
y-axis crosses the main diagonal. Based on the conventional techniques of fold-change detection in microarray
analysis, we consider the perpendicular on the main diagonal. The resulting distance formula is: d =

1
2( y 0 − x 0 )

,

with y0 being the score for the word within the unidirec-

the respective data. MQY and LE generated and categorized the promoter data set. FD contributed in the development of models and algorithms, and in the
implementation of the methods. KE contributed the idea
of hamming-distance-based clustering. SSL contributed to
the statistical foundations of the scoring model. LE provided the text describing the biological background and
significance, conducted the conservation analysis, and
participated in the drafting of the paper. In addition to
architecting the software pipeline employed in this
research, LRW contributed to the design, implementation
and validation of models and algorithms (especially in
the areas of word searching, word scoring, and sequence
clustering) and to the writing of this manuscript.
