Abstract
Background: The Campanulaceae (the "hare bell" or "bellflower" family) is a derived angiosperm
family comprised of about 600 species treated in 35 to 55 genera. Taxonomic treatments vary
widely and little phylogenetic work has been done in the family. Gene order in the chloroplast
genome usually varies little among vascular plants. However, chloroplast genomes of
Campanulaceae represent an exception and phylogenetic analyses solely based on chloroplast
rearrangement characters support a reasonably well-resolved tree.
Results: Chloroplast DNA physical maps were constructed for eighteen representatives of the
family. So many gene order changes have occurred among the genomes that characterizing
individual mutational events was not always possible. Therefore, we examined different, novel
scoring methods to prepare data matrices for cladistic analysis. These approaches yielded largely
congruent results but varied in amounts of resolution and homoplasy. The strongly supported
nodes were common to all gene order analyses as well as to parallel analyses based on ITS and rbcL
sequence data. The results suggest some interesting and unexpected intrafamilial relationships. For
example fifteen of the taxa form a derived clade; whereas the remaining three taxa – Platycodon,
Codonopsis, and Cyananthus – form the basal clade. This major subdivision of the family corresponds
to the distribution of pollen morphology characteristics but is not compatible with previous
taxonomic treatments.
Conclusions: Our use of gene order data in the Campanulaceae provides the most highly resolved
phylogeny as yet developed for a plant family using only cpDNA rearrangements. The gene order
data showed markedly less homoplasy than sequence data for the same taxa but did not resolve
quite as many nodes. The rearrangement characters, though relatively few in number, support
robust and meaningful phylogenetic hypotheses and provide new insights into evolutionary
relationships within the Campanulaceae.

Background
The Campanulaceae sensu stricto are a nearly cosmopolitan angiosperm family consisting of latex-bearing, prima-

rily perennial herbs or occasional subshrubs that typically
have alternate leaves, sympetalous corollas, inferior ovaries, and capsular fruits. Allied to the Campanulaceae are

the Lobeliaceae, Cyphiaceae, Cyphocarpaceae, Nemacladaceae, Pentaphragmataceae, and Sphenocleaceae; at
times, all of these taxa have been included in the Campanulaceae at varying taxonomic rank by different authors
(Table 1). Taxonomic treatments lack consensus (Table 1)
and phylogenetic work has only recently been attempted.
Campanulaceae in the strict sense are recognized as 600
[1] to 950 [2] species distributed among 35 [1] to 55 [2]
genera. Generic circumscription and intrafamilial classification vary widely according to author. Within the family
as few as two [3] and as many as 18 [4] tribes have been
recognized (Table 1). Fedorov's more recent work [5] recognized eight tribes (Table 1), but only included taxa
present in the former Soviet Union. Although Kolakovsky's treatment of Old World Campanulaceae [4] is the
most recently published attempt to produce a more complete intrafamilial classification of the Campanulaceae
(Table 1), the scope of the work is limited compared to
that of either A. de Candolle [3] or Fedorov [5]. In all
treatments, the Campanuleae and Wahlenbergieae (at
whatever rank) are typically the largest, most inclusive
taxa, with segregate tribes consisting of only one to a few
genera.
The most comprehensive treatment of the Campanulaceae remains the monograph of A. de Candolle [3], who
recognized two groups corresponding to the Wahlenbergieae and Campanuleae (Table 1). Simple basal leaves
and simple, alternate or occasional whorled, cauline
leaves that are often different in shape than the basal
leaves, characterize the Campanuleae in de Candolle's
sense. Flowers are solitary or borne in cymes or racemes,
and have five corolla lobes that are mostly fused proximally. The inferior ovary usually has 3–5 carpels and
develops into a capsule that mostly dehisces by lateral
pores (rarely a berry). The Wahlenbergieae are mostly perennials characterized by simple, alternate, cauline leaves.
Flowers are solitary or borne in cymes or heads, and petals
may be free, proximally fused, or distally fused. The ovary
is inferior, semi-inferior, or superior, and consists of two,
three, or five carpels. The fruit is generally a capsule
dehiscing by apical pores or valves (rarely a berry). Both
groups have five stamens with filaments that are often
proximally dilated and anthers with introrse dehiscence;
nectaries are generally present, and many ovules are
attached to axile placentae. The entire family is characterized by secondary pollen presentation in which protandry
is combined with a close association of anthers around
the style and introrse pollen discharge onto the style for
presentation to pollinators. This syndrome is similar to
that found in Lobeliaceae and Asteraceae, but invaginating stylar hairs are unique to the Campanulaceae.
Capsule characters vary considerably and provide the
basis for most intrafamilial classification schemes. Cam-

panuleae typically include taxa with capsules dehiscing by
lateral pores, whereas Wahlenbergieae usually include
taxa with capsules dehiscing by apical valves. Ovary characters, such as carpel number and position, have also been
important in traditional classifications. For example, the
monotypic tribe Platycodoneae [6] or subtribe Platycodinae (Table 1) is sometimes segregated. It is defined by carpels that are equal in number to and alternate with the
calyx lobes, whereas in Campanuleae and Wahlenbergieae the carpels are often fewer than the calyx lobes, or if
the same in number then opposite them [1,7,8]. Little correlation appears to exist among diagnostic features; therefore there is considerable taxonomic disagreement among
classifications. In certain instances it is difficult to discern
the rationale behind tribal placement of individual
genera.
The high level of disagreement among both inter- and
intrafamilial classifications of the Campanulaceae indicates that phylogenetic assessment of the family is needed.
Cosner, in her thesis [9], included an early version of a
portion of the work described here, and Eddie, in his thesis [10] developed phylogenetic hypotheses based on ITS
sequence data and morphology. An expanded version of
the ITS work has been published [11] but leaves some
major lineages unsampled and the relationships among
some major groups are unresolved or poorly supported.
Further phylogenetic work is clearly warranted. The chloroplast genome has proven to be a useful tool for phylogenetic reconstruction. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) of
land plants is highly conserved in nucleotide sequence as
well as gene content and order; its relatively slow rate of
evolution makes it an excellent molecule for phylogenetic
and evolutionary studies [12]. Chloroplast genomes of
photosynthetic angiosperms average about 160 kilobase
pairs (kb) in size; the circular chromosome is divided by
two copies of a large (in angiosperms usually about 25 kb)
inverted repeat (IR) into large and small single copy
regions (LSC and SSC, respectively) [13,14]. Restriction
site mapping, gene sequencing, and analysis of gene order
rearrangements have been used to study cpDNA variation
for phylogenetic investigations [12]. Here we use the distribution of gene order changes in the chloroplast
genomes of the Campanulaceae to estimate phylogenetic
relationships in the family.
Generally, major gene order changes are rare. Therefore,
when they occur, such mutations are extremely useful as
phylogenetic markers because they are readily polarized
and typically lack homoplasy [15-17]. Four categories of
cpDNA gene order rearrangements have been proposed:
1) inversions, 2) insertions or deletions, 3) IR expansion
or contraction or loss, and 4) transpositions; all of which
may have occurred during chloroplast genome evolution
in the Campanulaceae [18]. When rearrangements have

been discovered elsewhere, they are generally few and easily characterized. The distributions of such characters
make effective markers of monophyletic groups. For
example, both the loss of one copy of the IR and inversions are extremely useful characters in legume phylogeny
[19,20], defining large clades within the family. Other
examples of phylogenetically informative inversions are
found within Asteraceae [21], Ranunculaceae [22,23],
ferns [24,25], and vascular plants [26]. Many other examples could be cited.
The earlier work of Cosner [9,18] and Knox [27,28] characterized some chloroplast genomes of the Campanulales
and identified a number of rearrangements relative to the
consensus gene order of angiosperms found in tobacco.

Members of the Lobeliaceae exhibit multiple rearrangements but are less rearranged than the Campanulaceae.
Three rearrangements may be shared between the two
families – a loss of the accD gene, the expansion of the
inverted repeat into the small single copy region, and, perhaps, an inversion of the region corresponding to tobacco
probes 40–44. Then, within the Campanulaceae, more
than 40 inversions, more than eight putative transpositions, two additional gene losses, additional IR expansion
or contraction events and 18 large insertions greater than
5 kb in size may have contributed to observed differences
among the chloroplast genomes sampled [9]. Due to this
unprecedented number of gene order mutations, it is not
possible to unambiguously determine the evolutionary
order of most events or in some cases to even define the

events themselves. This complex situation poses special
problems for using these rearrangements to estimate phylogenetic relationships. In this paper we develop alternative character codings for the data and compare the results
of parsimony analyses of the different data sets. In addition, we compare the ability of the gene order data to support robust phylogenetic hypotheses to that of sequence
data from rbcL and ITS. Finally, the phylogenetic implications of the cpDNA rearrangement data for the Campanulaceae are discussed.

Results
Our data indicate that the eighteen mapped Campanulaceae chloroplast genomes (Table 2) are drastically rearranged relative to those of other land plants (Fig. 1). The
tobacco cpDNA gene order represents the consensus gene
order for angiosperms [13,15]. Therefore rearrangements
in Campanulaceae chloroplast genomes were identified
relative to tobacco. Because characterizing specific mutational events was not always possible three different coding methods (Matrix 1, 2 and 3) were developed. Matrix 1
coded all gene order changes as endpoints (derived adjacencies, relative to tobacco, were identified and scored for
presence/absence). Matrix 2 and 3 involved recoding
some endpoint characters to recognize 31 specific mutations. Matrix 2 and 3 were analyzed with and without
weighting. See Methods for additional details on character
encoding and analyses.
Seventy-nine variable characters were included in the endpoints only matrix (Matrix 1). Forty-two of the derived
character states were unique to a single taxon and 37 were
phylogenetically-informative. Six trees of 97 steps were
obtained with consistency indices of 0.81 with autapomorphies included and 0.67 with autapomorphies
excluded (CI = 0.81/0.67). Ten nodes were common to
the six shortest trees (Fig. 2). Eight of those ten nodes have
bootstrap values (BS) greater than 50, but BS exceeded 90
for only three nodes.
To construct Matrix 2 and Matrix 3, we interpreted endpoints as events where possible. Under our interpretation,
several types of rearrangements contributed to cpDNA
evolution in the family, including multiple inversions
(scored primarily as endpoints), five IR expansion or contraction events, eight transpositions, two deletions, and
14 large insertions greater than 5 kb in size (Table 3).
Although transposition probably does occur, at least occasionally, in the chloroplast genome [29], it is not a common mechanism of rearrangement. Still, in some
instances transposition could explain rearranged gene
orders with fewer steps than multiple inversions and so
we hypothesized transposition events in some cases.
Matrix 2 and 3 each were composed of 84 variable charac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/27

ters of which thirty-one and thirty-four, respectively, were
parsimony informative.
The unweighted analysis of Matrix 2 produced 241
equally parsimonious trees of 93 steps (CI = 0.90/0.79).
The strict consensus of the 241 trees includes six resolved
nodes (Fig. 3a) all six of which were supported by BS values of at least 50 and five nodes were supported at 90% or
above. The weighted analysis of Matrix 2 (Fig. 3b) resulted
in 12 equally parsimonious trees of 125 steps (CI = 0.93/
0.82). The strict consensus of the twelve trees retains ten
resolved nodes. Seven of the ten nodes have BS values
over 50 and for five nodes BS ≥ 90. Both analyses of Matrix
3 generated the same two equally parsimonious trees (Fig.
4). The lengths of the two trees were 87 steps (CI = 0.97/
0.92) or 118 steps (CI = 0.97/0.93) depending on whether
unweighted (Fig. 4a) or weighted (Fig. 4b) analyses were
conducted. Only three endpoint characters are homoplasious in the Matrix 3 analyses (Fig. 5). The strict consensus
of these two trees retains nine resolved nodes, all nine of
which are supported with BS ≥ 50. Six (or five in the
weighted analysis) nodes received strong support (BS ≥
90).
All results (Figs. 2,3,4,5) indicate that Codonopsis, Platycodon, and Cyananthus are basal within the family. Analyses
on Matrix 2 and 3 support a Codonopsis + Cyananthus sister
group relationship and a monophyletic basal clade
whereas the Matrix 1 analysis supports a Codonopsis +
Platycodon sister group and a paraphyletic basal grade.
Neither outcome is very well supported; the alternative
scenarios each require only a single additional step in the
other data set. Within the fifteen derived taxa some of the
relationships are not resolved or resolved but weakly supported. However, some groupings are well supported in
all analyses. The South African taxa, Merciera, Prismatocarpus and Roella, form a clade (BS = bootstrap value = 98 100). Wahlenbergia is the sister to these three taxa in all
analyses with varying levels of support (BS = 82, 60, 69,
99, 99, in the five analyses based on gene order changes).
Other groupings include a Symphyandra + Edraianthus
clade (BS = 86-91) and Legousia + Asyneuma + Petromarula
+ Triodanis (BS = 94-100).
The five analyses had somewhat different characteristics
(Table 4). For example, Matrix 1 and Matrix 3 analyses
generated fewer equally-parsimonious trees than Matrix 2.
The Matrix 1 analyses resolved the most nodes. Matrix 3
analyses exhibited the lowest amounts of homoplasy and
supported the highest number of nodes BS ≥ 90.
Comparing all results, no nodes with high bootstrap
values (BS ≥ 90) were conflicted by other nodes of equally
high value. However, there were three instances of
incongruence involving nodes of lesser support – Matrix 1
and 3 analyses supported Campanula + Adenophora,

whereas Matrix 2 supported Adenophora + Jasione; Matrix 1
supported Codonopsis + Platycodon (BS = 50), whereas
Matrix 2 and 3 supported Codonopsis + Cyananthus (BS =
94-99); and Matrix 1 supported (weakly, BS = 57) the
placement of Cyananthus at the base of the derived clade,
whereas Matrix 2 and 3 analyses supported the monophyly of the basal group (BS = 56-68). One clade, Legousia
+ Asyneuma (BS = 87), was recovered only by the Matrix 1
analysis within a clade not further resolved by the other
gene order analyses.
We included sequence data here mainly to allow for a
comparison with gene order data in terms of phylogenetic
utility. The rbcL data from the same eighteen taxa (Table
5) provided 116 parsimony-informative characters that,
when analyzed, yielded nine shortest equally-parsimonious trees of 338 steps (C = 0.77/0.66). The strict
consensus of the nine trees retained fourteen nodes (fig.
6a), thirteen of which had BS ≥ 50 and four of which were
supported BS ≥ 90. The ITS data of Eddie et al [11] from
taxa equivalent to fifteen of the eighteen mapped taxa
(Table 5) provided 196 parsimony-informative characters
from which a single most parsimonious tree of 716 steps
(fig. 6b) was generated (CI = 0.69/0.60). The tree contains
thirteen resolved nodes of which ten had BS ≥ 50 and four
had BS ≥ 90. The two sequence data sets had lower CI values than any of the gene order analyses and a higher percentage of homoplastic characters (Table 4). The ITS data
had especially high levels of homoplasy; the ITS data had
a higher percentage of characters that change three or
more times in excess than the Matrix 3 analyses had for
total homoplastic characters (Table 4). In the Matrix 3
analysis only three characters (endpoints) are required to
change more than once over the most parsimonious tree;
each has one excess change. With the inclusion of the
sequence-based analyses, there were additional instances
of incongruence between weakly supported nodes: 1) The
placement of Musschia and Jasione varies between the rbcL
and ITS results (the placement of these taxa is largely unresolved by the gene order data); 2) In both sequence-based
trees, Campanula and Adenophora are separate lineages
(rather than sister taxa) basal to the Legousia-AsyneumaTriodanis-Petromarula clade, whereas in the gene order
analyses they are allied to Symphyandra-Edraianthus, and
Trachelium; 3) Matrix 1 supports a Legousia-Asyneuma
clade, whereas a Legousia-Triodanis clade occurs in the
sequence-based trees; and 4) Matrix 1 and ITS support a
Codonopsis-Platycodon grouping within the basal clade,
whereas rbcL and Matrix 2 and 3 analyses support Codonopsis-Cyananathus. Among these instances of disagreement between weakly supported nodes, there is no
general pattern of disagreement between the sequence
data and the gene order analyses. And among strongly
supported nodes, again, there is complete agreement,
among all analyses-sequence and gene order.

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of cpDNA rearrangements
The relatively large number of gene order mutations that
have occurred in the Campanulaceae chloroplast
genomes causes difficulties when interpreting their phylogenetic significance. The phylogenetic analysis of such a
complex set of cpDNA rearrangements within a group of
plants is without precedent. The first problem was simply
defining individual mutational events. Although the ideal
way to analyze rearrangement data is to determine presence or absence of specific events, in the Campanulaceae,
this was not possible in many cases given our present
knowledge. Where multiple overlapping rearrangements
have occurred between genomes, the two specific endpoints that define a particular inversion may not be determinable. Because of the inherent complexity of the data,
we felt a new method of character analysis of the rearrangement data was warranted. Our approach involved
coding endpoints, along with more easily defined rearrangements, as characters for different cladistic analyses.
Endpoints were defined as two non-contiguous tobacco

regions that are now adjacent in the genomes of one or
more species.
Using endpoints as characters is advantageous. It allows
for the incorporation into the analysis of data that could

not be used if only unambiguously interpreted events
were included. However, using endpoints as characters
has several drawbacks, including the inadvertent weighting of certain events over others. Inversions necessarily
produce two endpoints, and transpositions three, whereas
gene losses and IR boundary changes produce a single
endpoint. Therefore inversions would be included twice
and transpositions three times if scored as "independent"
endpoints rather than events. Plus, if both endpoints of an
inversion are still intact in a genome, the inversion is
scored twice, if only a single endpoint remains the inversion is counted only once, and if both endpoints have
been lost (through further mutation) the inversion will
not be included at all. This may represent a problem in the
Campanulaceae analyses because there appears to be a
mixture of event types and at least some endpoint reuse
[18].
Our inclusion of transposition as a possible mechanism
for gene order mutation in the Campanulaceae chloroplast genomes is problematic. Definitive evidence supporting the occurrence of transposition in the plastid
genome is lacking. Transposition has been invoked to
explain chloroplast DNA rearrangements, for example in
"subclover" [30] and wheat [31,32]. In these cases, transposition has been supported using parsimony arguments
(one transposition explaining a change with fewer steps
than three inversions) or using the existence of invertedand direct-repeat sequence motifs near the boundaries of
rearrangements [33]. In Campanulaceae, some lines of
evidence in addition to parsimony suggest the possibility
of transposition as a mechanism. First, the abundance of
rearrangement events within the family suggests some
mechanism that facilitates gene order mutation;
transposition is one such process. Second, the segment of
the genome defined by tobacco probes 53–56 is now
located, in most of the derived taxa, within the inverted
repeat. The region from which it has been removed
appears otherwise undisturbed. In Asyneuma, the 53–56
region has been secondarily removed from the IR and
returned to near its original location leaving behind small
portions of 53 and 56 in the IR, detectable using southern
hybridization. In Wahlenbergia, Merciera, Prismatocarpus
and Roella, the 53, 54 portion of the 53–56 block has
moved from the IR back to the LSC. One explanation for
the high level of rearrangement apparently associated
with this segment is that the region contains a transposable element. Third, a possible duplicative transposition is
suggested (Fig. 1) in Trachelium [18] and five other taxa
[9]. In addition to a full-length (presumably functional)
copy of the 23S rRNA gene, a partial copy is located within
ycf1. Transposition is one manner in which segments of
DNA can be both copied and moved within a genome.
None of our data are definitive. The observed rearrangements could have taken place as the result of multiple

inversions. Therefore, it is important to note that if transposition is not active in the Campanulaceae genome, our
phylogenetic results will not be greatly affected. Events
coded in Matrix 2 and 3 as single transpositions would be
underweighted inversions if incorrectly interpreted. The
fact that the analysis of Matrix 1 yields results compatible
with those of the matrices that include transpositions suggests that, if our interpretation is erroneous, it does not
affect the phylogenetic conclusions.

Our three methods of character scoring did yield largely
compatible results in our analyses. Relationships that
were strongly supported in one analysis were found in all
analyses. Events make more desirable characters but they
will only improve analyses if the postulated events are the
correct ones. Comparing analyses that include event interpretations with endpoint only analyses is one way to
determine the phylogenetic effects of the hypotheses of
events used. Endpoint only analyses also allow studies
that minimize a priori assumptions about the evolutionPage 10 of 17

ary events. It is possible that more complex evolutionary
scenarios occurred, in which some inversions evolved in
parallel, or in which similar gene orders resulted from a
different set of inversions. The parsimony analyses may
underestimate the number of inversions shared between
primitive and advanced genera, because evidence of
shared inversions may have been lost. Although we have
attempted to produce the simplest evolutionary schemes,
it is very possible that longer, more complicated scenarios
actually occurred, especially given that the Campanulaceae seem predisposed to cpDNA rearrangements. However, given the congruence of the results among our
various analyses, we feel our phylogeny is a reasonable
estimate of relationships within the family. Elsewhere, we
have analyzed a reduced subset of characters and taxa for
the Campanulaceae cpDNA data set using endpoint scoring and constructing trees using breakpoint distances
among other methods (e.g., [34]). Other computational

biologists have also used this reduced data matrix to test
different methods of phylogeny reconstruction based on
gene order data (e.g., [35,36]). These various studies produced trees that are largely congruent with those generated in this paper suggesting that the Campanulaceae
cpDNA gene order data are providing a consistent estimate of phylogenetic relationships given any logical
method of scoring and analysis. Although the
rearrangements in Campanulaceae are complex, the phylogenetic utility of the gene order data is evident. In most
previous examples of phylogenetic use of rearrangements
the small number of events allowed for the circumscription of only very broad groups [15]. Because there are so
many rearrangements in the Campanulaceae, smaller
groups can be identified. This has resulted in the most
highly resolved phylogeny as yet developed based entirely
on cpDNA rearrangements.

Not only do these data support a well-resolved phylogeny
but they provide robust support of several nodes. Matrix 3
supports as many nodes at BS ≥ 90 as ITS and more than
rbcL. In matrix 3, only three endpoint characters (8.8% of
parsimony-informative characters) are homoplastic, each
changing one extra time over the tree. In contrast, within
ITS, 18 characters (9.2% of parsimony-informative characters) change three or more extra times over the tree, and
71.9% of characters are homoplastic. Presumably because
of this high level of homoplasy, only two nodes are
retained in the consensus of all ITS trees from the shortest
to 1% longer, whereas seven nodes are retained in matrix
3 trees "to 1% longer" – the highest number of any of the
analyses. Matrix 3, the matrix in which characters are most
interpreted as mutational events, is especially strong in its
performance, exceeding both sequence data sets in average bootstrap value per resolved node and CI (in addition
to those characteristics just discussed). This suggests that
the closer we can get to scoring the actual mutations the
stronger gene order data will perform. Although the endpoint only matrix provides useful insights on relationships, we would argue that the extent to which these gene
order characters cannot recover the phylogeny is directly
related to our ability to define individual mutational
events.

stitute a key part of any modern reassessment of relationships in the Campanulaceae. He suggested that all taxa
with elongated apertures should be removed from
Campanuleae and Wahlenbergieae, and those with porate
grains removed from Schönland's Platycodinae. Following the removal of colpate and colporate taxa, Campanuleae sensu Schönland are comprised of Northern
Hemisphere genera, whereas Wahlenbergieae contain
Southern Hemisphere taxa, with the exceptions of Edraianthus and Jasione (although Jasione occurs in North
Africa as well as Europe). The gene order data indicate that
the affinities of Jasione and Edraianthus lie with Northern
Hemisphere species rather than with Wahlenbergieae. The
gene order data also are compatible with other available
nucleotide data in addition to those reported here
[[10,11,42], L. Raubeson, A. Oestriech and R. Jansen,
unpublished data], a morphology-based cladistic study
[10] and are also largely congruent with a serological
study of the Campanulaceae [43]. Although the gene
order and serological studies differed somewhat in the
taxa sampled, both included a group containing Trachelium and Campanula. They also agreed in the grouping of
Asyneuma and Petromarula. The only discrepancy was in
the placement of Legousia; the serological study placed this
genus basal to all others surveyed [43].

Phylogenetic implications of the rearrangement data
Most traditional classifications of the Campanulaceae are
based mainly on capsule dehiscence and ovary position
and arrangement. As Kovanda [1] and Thulin [8] recognized, classification of the Campanulaceae based on capsule characters alone brings together otherwise radically
different taxa. Neither the Campanuleae nor Wahlenbergieae (at whatever taxonomic rank) are monophyletic
based on cpDNA rearrangements (Fig. 5). Likewise, no
traditional classification (Table 1) suggests that Codonopsis, Platycodon, and Cyananthus are basal in the family as
supported by both gene order and sequence data. Takhtajan's system [2] is something of an exception among traditional classifications; however, he suggested only
Cyananthus (in its own tribe Cyanantheae) as the most
primitive member of the family, placing Platycodon and
Codonopsis in other tribes (Table 1).

The groups delimited by cpDNA rearrangements also
exhibit geographical integrity. Wahlenbergia is primarily a
Southern Hemisphere Old World genus [44]; W. gloriosa,
mapped for this study, is Australian [44]. Roella, Merciera,
and Prismatocarpus are all endemic to South Africa [4547]. The nine genera in the Trachelium and Legousia clades
are primarily European to Eurasian, although Triodanis is
endemic to North America and Campanula has a few
North American representatives [5,48-50]. Musschia is
endemic to the island of Madeira [51].

In contrast, studies of pollen ultrastructure have indicated
that Platycodon, Codonopsis, and Cyananthus are basal
members of Campanulaceae [37,38]. These taxa have colpate to colporate apertures, whereas the remaining family
members (as surveyed here) have porate grains [37-41].
The evolutionary scheme based on pollen morphology
presented by Dunbar [38] suggests that Cyananthus (colpate) and Codonopsis (colpate) are more closely related to
each other than either is to Platycodon (colporate), which
is also supported by the gene order tree (Clade B, Fig. 5).
Thulin [8] believed that pollen morphology should con-

There has been considerable debate regarding the relationships among the four centers of taxonomic diversity
of the Campanulaceae: Asia, Europe (especially the Mediterranean), South Africa, and western North America.
Bentham [52] hypothesized a northern origin for Campanulaceae but he did not specify a particular region.
Takhtajan [2] suggested a basal position of the Asian
genus Cyananthus. Studies of pollen ultrastructure indicated that the Asian genera Codonopsis, Cyananthus, and
Platycodon are basal members of the Campanulaceae
[37,38]. Recent studies of the Campanulales [42,53,54]
indicate that the order consists of several families, including the Campanulaceae, Cyphiaceae, Cyphocarpaceae,
Lobeliaceae, Nemacladaceae, and Stylidaceae. Several of
these families are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere
(all but Nemacladaceae from North America and Campanulaceae which is cosmopolitan), implying that the
Southern Hemisphere may be the ancestral area for the

Campanulaceae [54]. Phylogenies based on rbcL sequence
data position the Campanulaceae sister to the North
American family Nemacladaceae [42,54]. Our cpDNA
phylogeny based on genome rearrangements (Fig. 5) provides strong support for the basal position of the three
examined Asian platycodonoid genera, suggesting that the
early radiation of the family may have occurred in Asia
rather than Africa. The genera from the Southern Hemisphere (Merciera, Prismatocarpus, Roella, and Wahlenbergia)
are in a much more derived position in the cpDNA tree.
In addition, the gene order data suggest affinities of several controversial genera (Fig. 5). Schönland [48] united
Musschia and Platycodon as Platycodinae, clearly incompatible with both our results and pollen evidence. Musschia is placed in the derived clade (A), although its exact
placement varies among all the analyses, including rbcL
and ITS. De Candolle [3] was unsure of Merciera's taxonomic position because its four basal ovules and singleseeded (by abortion) unilocular capsule [43] are unique
in the Campanulaceae [55]. This genus was later recognized as a separate tribe, Merciereae [56], but is allied with
other southern African genera in the cpDNA analysis (Fig.
5). Takhtajan [2] placed Merciera with Wahlenbergia, Roella and Prismatocarpus in his Wahlenbergieae but also
included other genera forming a polyphyletic group
according to our results.
Adenophora and Symphyandra have been segregated from
Campanula based on the presence of a conspicuous tubular nectariferous disc and connate anthers, respectively.
Adenophora and Campanula are sister taxa in the gene order
analyses (except those based on Matrix 2) and Adenophora's chloroplast genome is derived relative to Campanula's (Fig. 5). Further sampling within Adenophora and the
large genus Campanula will be necessary to determine if
this is a general result. Symphyandra is more closely related
to Edraianthus than Campanula but all are within the A3
Clade (Fig. 5). Edraianthus has traditionally been considered close to Wahlenbergia [3] but this is not supported by
any of the results reported here or by morphological studies of Hilliard and Burtt [57].
Much controversy surrounds the taxonomy of the genera
Triodanis and Legousia. In some treatments, both genera
were included under the illegitimate name Specularia (e.g.
[3,48]). McVaugh [58,59] and Fernald [60] disagreed
regarding the circumscription of the genera; Fernald felt
that Triodanis as a genus is very weak and should be
merged with Legousia. McVaugh [58] argued that the two
genera should either remain separate or both be subsumed into Campanula. In his system, both species
studied here (T. perfoliata and L. falcata) belong to Triodanis. As expected, Triodanis and Legousia belong to the
same cpDNA clade (A2), united by an unusual mutation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/27

that transferred a large segment of the large single copy
(LSC) region to the SSC region [9]. However, Legousia has
a putative transposition not found in Triodanis, whereas
Triodanis has a unique large insertion [9].

Conclusions
Despite the difficulties in interpreting such a complex set
of rearrangements, the systematic utility of chloroplast
DNA in the Campanulaceae is evident. Our results support the division of the family into two groups previously
unrecognized in any taxonomic treatment. In addition,
numerous groupings within the larger, derived clade are
strongly supported. The data indicate that traditional classifications based on fruit and ovary characters are unnatural, and suggest affinities of several difficult genera.
Additional sampling within large genera, such as Campanula and Wahlenbergia, will be necessary to fully elucidate
relationships among chloroplast genomes. It is likely that
intrafamilial relationships can be further resolved by
including other genera in rearrangement analyses.
Although homoplasy is not absent in our data, it is low
and considerably lower than some sequence data such as
ITS. Although any reasonable scoring method for the gene
order data generates results that are largely compatible
among the different analyses, the more that the gene order
data can be interpreted as actual mutational events (and
the presence or absence of those events used as characters)
the stronger will be the results. Even in cases such as this,
with high levels of gene order complexity, cpDNA gene
order mutations make excellent phylogenetic markers.

Methods
Total DNA was isolated from one species in each of 18
genera in the Campanulaceae (Table 2) according to the
CTAB method of Doyle and Doyle [61]. DNAs were
digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI, BglII,
EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, and SstI, and double digests were
carried out using HindIII and the remaining five enzymes.
Hybridization probes consisted of 106 small tobacco
cpDNA probes (average size 1.2 kb) provided by J. Palmer
[62]. Twenty-one cloned HindIII cpDNA fragments from
Trachelium caeruleum of the Campanulaceae were also
used as hybridization probes [18]. Complete single and
double digest restriction site maps were constructed for 16
of the 18 taxa, and nearly complete maps were constructed for the remaining two taxa, Jasione and Roella [9].
It was not possible to map the small single copy (SSC)
region of Roella because hybridization signals became
increasingly weak in later rounds of hybridization. In Jasione, rearrangements involving the IR/SSC junction and
SSC region prohibited the complete resolution of the
map. The restriction site maps were then interpreted as
linear "number" maps representing the hybridization patterns of 106 consecutively numbered tobacco cpDNA
probes for the 18 taxa (Fig. 1).

Rearrangements were recognized as any change in the
order of gene segments relative to the order observed in
tobacco. The recognition of such disruptions is straightforward; the interpretation of the disruptions as actual
mutational events can be quite complicated. As a hypothetical example, the ancestral order in a region may be 12-3-4-5-6; while the order 1-2-5-3-4-6 may be observed in
a rearranged genome. In the rearranged genome 2-5, 5-3,
and 4-6 are adjacencies that are derived relative to the
ancestral order. But what set of events is responsible for
the change? A simple transposition of 5 to the position
between 2 and 3 can account for the difference in a single
event. Alternatively, two inversions with one shared endpoint may be responsible or two inversions with unique
endpoints followed by a transposition can explain the differences. Additional explanations would also be compatible with these data. On what basis do we choose among
multiple scenarios? As an actual example, the chloroplast
genome of Platycodon could have evolved from a tobaccolike ancestor by two different models each involving seven
inversions (Fig. 7); not one inversion is common to the
two scenarios. Thus in our initial approach to data analysis (generating Matrix 1) we did not define events, but utilized endpoints only. In the hypothetical example 2-5, 53, and 4-6 are "endpoints" -derived adjacencies absent in
the ancestral gene order. Taxa with genomes that exhibit
the derived adjacencies are coded as 1 for those characters
and those with the ancestral condition as 0.
We constructed two additional matrices that did include
events since some endpoints (or combination of endpoints) seemed readily interpretable. For example, if a
region of the genome was simply reversed in order (i.e., 14-3-2-5 relative to 1-2-3-4-5) we assumed that an inversion had taken place to result in the different arrangements of gene segments. Likewise if genomes differed in
content of the IR, we assumed that single duplication or
loss events were responsible. Making such inferences, we
constructed Matrix 2 that is composed of 31 events and 53
endpoints. We then went further and constructed hypotheses of rearrangement events to account for the differences
among the genomes of the three major clades delimited
among the fifteen derived taxa [9]. If these scenarios indicated that an inversion likely was shared between two or
more genera, the taxa were coded as having an endpoint
even if the endpoint has been lost due to disruption by
subsequent events. We were conservative in our application of this approach and only six endpoint scorings were
modified in Matrix 3 compared to Matrix 2. To summarize, we produced three data matrices that represented
increasing levels of interpretation of endpoints as actual
events.
Cladistic analyses were performed on each of the three
data sets using equal weighting of all included characters.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/27

The second and third matrices were also analyzed giving
weights of two to all non-endpoint characters. This
weighting represents an attempt to compensate for the
unintentional weight given to inversions in which both
endpoints are present. This, of course, results in downweighting inversions in which only one endpoint remains
and fails to include inversions whose endpoints are both
absent.
Finally, to allow for a direct comparison of performance
between gene order data and sequence data over the same
taxa, we conducted maximum parsimony analyses of ITS
and rbcL data. The ITS sequences were generated and
aligned by Eddie et al [11]. We determined taxa equal or
equivalent to our taxa and performed analyses on just
those taxa from the Eddie matrix (Table 5); only fifteen of
our eighteen taxa were represented. We generated rbcL
data to add to the two taxa already available [42] so that
we had rbcL sequence data from all of the eighteen
mapped taxa. Exactly the same DNAs were used.
In generating the rbcL sequences, we PCR-amplified about
1370 bp of the gene in 50 µl reactions containing: 1 µl
unquantified total genomic DNA, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 2.5
mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.4
µM each primer, and 1 unit Taq polymerase. Cycling conditions were as follows: 1 95°C denaturation step for 3
minutes 30 seconds, 30 cycles of 1 minute at 95°C, 1
minute at 55°C, and 1 minute 30 seconds at 72°C, and
finally a 7 minute 72°C step. The PCR primers plus two
internal primers were used for sequencing; the forward
amplification primer and two internal primers were
designed by G. Zurawski (his Z-1, Z-427 and Z-895). The
Zurawski primer commonly used as the reverse amplification primer did not work in many Campanulaceae; we
designed an alternative: 5'-GTATCCATTGCGCAAACTC3'. For sequencing, two successful PCR reactions were
combined and then cleaned (and concentrated) using the
Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (catalog number
28104). Depending on the concentration of the recovered
product, 0.5–2 µl of this template was cycle sequenced
and resolved on an ABI Prism 377 Automatic DNA
Sequencer. Electropherograms were inspected, and then
sequences were edited and assembled using Sequencher,
vers 3.1 (Gene Codes Corp.) The sequences have been
deposited in GenBank (accession numbers in Table 5).
Alignment was performed by Sequencher and adjusted
manually. Alignment of the rbcL sequences was very
straightforward.
For all parsimony analyses, searches were conducted using
the branch and bound algorithm in PAUP* 4.0b10 (PPC)
[63]. Tobacco was used as the outgroup for the gene order
data since it has the ancestral chloroplast genome gene
order for the angiosperms [15,26] and Lobelia was used as

data set, for monophyletic groups was evaluated by calculating bootstrap values [65] using 10,000 heuristic (TBR,
multrees option) replicates. In addition, for each matrix,
analyses were performed to generate all trees from the
shortest to one percent longer. We used a percentage
rather than an equal number of steps in an attempt to
make an equivalent comparison among the different sized
data sets. A consensus of these trees was determined and
the number of nodes retained "to 1% longer" was
