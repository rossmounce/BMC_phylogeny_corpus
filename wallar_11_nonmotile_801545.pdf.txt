The non-motile phenotype of Salmonella hha
ydgT mutants is mediated through PefI-SrgD
Lauren E Wallar1, Andrew M Bysice1 and Brian K Coombes1,2*

Abstract
Background: Two ancestral nucleoid-associated proteins called Hha and YdgT contribute to the negative
regulation of several virulence-associated genes in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our previous work
showed that Hha and YdgT proteins are required for negative regulation of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-2 and
that hha ydgT double mutants are attenuated for murine infection. Interestingly, hha ydgT mutant bacteria
exhibited a non-motile phenotype suggesting that Hha and YdgT have a role in flagellar regulation.
Results: In this study we show that the non-motile phenotype of hha ydgT mutants is due to decreased levels of
the master transcriptional regulator FlhD4C2 resulting in down-regulation of class II/III and class III flagellar
promoters and lack of surface flagella on these cells. The horizontally acquired pefI-srgD region was found to be
partially responsible for this phenotype since deletion of pefI-srgD in a hha ydgT deletion background resulted in
transient restoration of class II/III and III transcription, expression of surface flagella, and motility in the quadruple
mutant.
Conclusion: These data extend our current understanding of the mechanisms through which Hha and YdgT
regulate flagellar biosynthesis and further describe how S. Typhimurium has integrated horizontal gene acquisitions
into ancestral regulatory networks.

Background
The pathogenic nature of Salmonella enterica has been
shaped by the horizontal acquisition of virulence determinants [1,2]. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), many virulence genes are
organized in mobile elements such as pathogenicity
islands, prophages, and the Salmonella virulence plasmid [3,4]. The increased pathogenic capacity conferred
by such genes is dependent on their integration into
ancestral regulatory networks of the cell, which can be
accomplished by regulatory evolution following horizontal gene transfer [5].
The Hha/YmoA family of small nucleoid-associated
proteins in Enterobacteriaceae [6] can participate in
fine-tuning virulence gene expression in response to
environmental cues [6,7]. For example, YmoA regulates
expression of Yop proteins, YadA adhesin, Yst enterotoxin and invasin in Yersinia enterocolitica [7-9]. Hha

negatively regulates the a-hemolysin genes hlyCABD in
Escherichia coli [10], hilA encoded within Salmonella
pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) in S. Typhimurium [11]
and the locus of enterocyte effacement in enterohemorrhagic E. coli [12]. A third member, YdgT, similarly
represses hlyCABD in E. coli [13]. We and others have
shown that Hha and YdgT are repressors of the type III
secretion system (T3SS) encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2), where they provide an important negative regulatory input required for virulence
[14-16]. Within their role as modulators of gene expression, Hha and YdgT repress other genes in horizontally
acquired regions in Salmonella including the pathogenicity islands SPI-1 through SPI-5 and genes on the Salmonella virulence plasmid [16].
We and others have shown that hha ydgT mutants are
non-motile [15,16], although the genetic basis linking
the loss of Hha and YdgT to a non-motile phenotype
was not known. Flagellar biosynthesis is an important
virulence trait in enteric pathogens which can facilitate
invasion of host intestinal epithelial cells [17]. Flagellar
gene expression is governed by a three-tiered

transcriptional hierarchy of early, middle, and late genes
(Figure 1) [18]. The early genes flhDC encoding the
master transcriptional regulator FlhD4C2, are at the top
of the transcriptional hierarchy and are transcribed from
the class I promoter [18]. FlhD 4 C 2 in turn activates
transcription of the middle genes encoding flagellar proteins comprising the hook-basal body, the alternative
sigma factor FliA (s28) and its anti-sigma factor FlgM
[19]. Upon assembly of the hook-basal body, FlgM is
secreted, releasing FliA to activate transcription of the
late genes from the class III promoter [20,21]. The late
genes encode flagellin, and motor and chemotaxis proteins [18]. Within the flagellar transcriptional hierarchy,
multiple regulators acting at either class I or class II
have been identified [21]. Recently, new regulatory
genes (pefI-srgD) in the pef fimbrial operon on the Salmonella virulence plasmid were found to encode synergistic negative regulators of flagellar gene expression
[22]. Interestingly, the pefI-srgD locus was upregulated
~7-fold in hha ydgT mutants [16] suggesting that Hha
and YdgT might impinge on pefI-srgD for control of flagellar gene expression. We show here that deletion of
pefI-srgD in a non-motile hha ydgT deletion mutant
leads to a transient restoration of class II/III and class
III gene expression that is sufficient for assembly of surface flagella and motility.

Results
Flagellar-based motility and surface flagellar expression is
abolished in hha ydgT mutants

During our characterization of Hha and YdgT-mediated
repression of SPI-2 genes, we noted that hha ydgT
mutant bacteria settled to the bottom of standing culture tubes whereas wild type cultures remained turbid.
Previous work indicated that hha ydgT mutants failed to

Hha

swim on motility plates but the contribution of the individual genes to this phenotype was not known and the
ability of these strains to make surface flagella was not
tested [16]. To test the contribution of individual genes
to this non-motile phenotype, we used a standard soft
agar motility assay and confirmed that hha ydgT
mutants were non-motile in accordance with previous
data (Figure 2A). This phenotype required deletion of
both hha and ydgT as single Δhha or ΔydgT mutants
remained motile (Figure 2B). To determine if the motility defect observed in Δhha ΔydgT was due to a defect
in flagellar rotation or a lack of flagellar production we
stained bacteria and examined them using transmission
electron microscopy to visualize surface flagella. We
found that while wild type bacteria were highly flagellated, Δhha ΔydgT bacteria did not assemble flagella on
their surface (Figure 2C).
Transcriptional activity of class II/III and III promoters is
decreased in a hha ydgT mutant

Flagellar biosynthesis is organized into a transcriptional
hierarchy of three distinct classes. To understand the
non-flagellated phenotype in greater detail, we measured
the activity of transcriptional reporters corresponding to
each of the three promoter classes driving the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). While the transcriptional activity in single hha or ydgT mutants was
not significantly different when compared to wild type,
transcriptional reporters for the hybrid class II/III promoter (fliA) [23,24] and class III promoter (fliC) were
significantly reduced in the hha ydgT double mutant
compared to wild type cells (Figure 3A). Since flhDC
promoter activity did not differ between wild type and
the hha ydgT mutant, we tested whether the inhibition

promoter and encode the master transcriptional regulator FlhD4C2 which is able to bind within the class II promoter to activate transcription of
the middle assembly genes in a s70-dependent manner. The middle assembly genes encode the hook-basal body structure which spans the
inner and outer membrane, the sigma factor FliA (s28) and the anti-sigma factor FlgM. Once the hook-basal body is fully assembled, FlgM is
exported through the hook-basal body allowing FliA to activate transcription of the late assembly genes from the class 3 promoter. Late
assembly genes encode flagellin and proteins required for flagellar rotation and chemotaxis.

Figure 2 Repression of flagellar biosynthesis and motility is dependent on the loss of Hha and YdgT. (A) Wild type, Δhha, ΔydgT and
Δhha ΔydgT were assessed for flagellar-based motility using a 0.25% soft agar motility assay in which 2 μL of overnight culture was inoculated
into semi-solid agar and incubated at 37°C for 6 h. (B) The radius of the motility halo region was quantified after 6 h and is shown as means
with standard errors. (C) Bacteria and surface flagella were negatively stained using a 0.1% uranyl acetate solution and visualized using scanning
transmission electron microscopy. Data represents three independent experiments.

ΔydgT involved an effect downstream of FlhD-FlhC protein production, since the FlhD4C2 complex is known to
activate class II transcription. Using Western blot analysis with FlhC and FlhD-specific antisera, we observed a
decrease in the levels of FlhC and FlhD in hha ydgT
mutants compared to wild type (Figure 3B), which was
consistent with the observed decrease in activity for
FlhD4C2 target promoters. As a control we used a clpXP
deletion mutant lacking the ClpXP protease that
degrades the FlhD4C2 complex. As shown in Figure 3B,
the levels of FlhC and FlhD were increased in ΔclpXP
cells compared to wild type.
Loss of the fimbrial regulators PefI-SrgD restores motility
in a hha ydgT background

We next wanted to identify potential negative regulators
in Δhha ΔydgT that were acting to inhibit transcriptional

regulation downstream of class I. Previous transcriptional
profiling experiments showed that the pefI-srgD locus on
the Salmonella virulence plasmid was upregulated ~7fold following deletion of hha ydgT [16]. Subsequently,
pefI-srgD genes were identified in a transposon mutagenesis screen as negative regulators of flagellar biosynthesis
that worked in concert to inhibit motility [22]. Based on
these data we hypothesized that the non-motile phenotype of hha ydgT mutants was mediated through its effect
on pefI-srgD. If so, we reasoned that deletion of pefI-srgD
in the hha ydgT mutant background would restore motility to this strain. We observed similar levels of motility
(Figure 4A and Figure 4B) and surface flagella (Figure 4C
and 4D) between wild type and ΔpefI-srgD bacteria, consistent with data from other groups [22]. However, as
shown in Figure 4A, Figure 4B, and Figure 4C, deletion
of pefI-srgD in the non-motile hha ydgT mutant restored

Figure 3 Loss of Hha and YdgT disrupts flagellar biosynthesis at the level of Class II/III activation. (A) Wild type and Δhha ΔydgT whole
cell lysates were collected at OD600 ~ 0.4-0.6 and levels of FlhC and FlhD were determined by Western blot analysis. DnaK was used as a
loading control. (B) Promoter activity at Class I (flhD), II/III (fliA) and III (fliC) was determined in wild type, Δhha, ΔydgT and Δhha ΔydgT using GFP

surface flagella and motility to this strain. We noted that
flagella distribution on the surface of Δhha ΔydgT ΔpefIsrgD quadruple mutants was less peritrichous and less
abundant (Figure 4C and Figure 4D) than either wild
type or ΔpefI-srgD suggesting that other regulators in
addition to PefI-SrgD might be involved in regulating
motility through the Hha and YdgT nucleoid-like
proteins.
Class II/III and class III promoters are transiently activated
upon loss of PefI-SrgD in Δhha ΔydgT bacteria

In transcriptional reporter experiments we were not able
to detect class II/III or class III flagellar promoter activity in hha ydgT mutant bacteria despite similar class I
gene expression levels relative to wild type. To determine if the restoration of motility in the Δhha ΔydgT
ΔpefI-srgD mutant correlated with an increase in class
II/III and class III promoter activity, we introduced the
gfp transcriptional reporters into the pefI-srgD double
mutant and the hha ydgT pefI-srgD quadruple mutant
and measured promoter activity over time. Consistent
with its role as a negative regulator of class I gene
expression [22], PflhD-gfp activity was elevated in strains
deleted for pefI-srgD compared to wild type, including
the hha ydgT pefI-srgD mutant which showed the highest level of flhD promoter activity at ~3 h. In line with
this, the quadruple mutant had a gain of transcriptional
activity at class II/III and class III promoters that was
apparent between 4-6 h (Figure 5). Although the level of

reporter activity for the hybrid class II/III and class III
reporters did not reach that of wild type cells, it was
sufficient to restore the expression of surface flagella as
shown by transmission electron microscopy, and to
restore motility levels to ~80% of wild type.

Discussion
We have shown that Hha and YdgT positively regulate
flagellar biosynthesis through their influence on the horizontally acquired flagellar regulators PefI-SrgD. The
ability of Hha and YdgT to act as positive regulators is
manifested only in the presence of both proteins, as single deletions of hha and ydgT had no apparent effect on
flagellar biosynthesis. A similar phenomenon has been
observed in the regulation of a-haemolysin production
in E. coli. Loss of both Hha and YdgT was required to
dramatically de-repress a-haemolysin production which
correlated with the ability of YdgT to attenuate the hha
mutant phenotype [13]. Similarly, Hha and YdgT may
be able to compensate for any effect on flagellar biosynthesis in the single deletion mutants making it difficult to discern their individual roles in flagellar
biosynthesis regulation.
PefI-SrgD were recently identified as negative regulators of flagellar gene expression as they inhibit class I
activation at the top of the flagellar biosynthesis transcriptional hierarchy [22]. PefI-SrgD is located within
the pef fimbrial operon on the Salmonella virulence
plasmid and PefI acts to regulate pef fimbriae expression

Figure 4 Loss of PefI-SrgD restores flagellar biosynthesis and flagellar-based motility in Δhha ΔydgT. (A). Flagellar-based motility was
determined in wild type, Δhha ΔydgT, ΔpefI-srgD and Δhha ΔydgT ΔpefI-srgD using a 0.25% soft agar motility assay. (B). The radius of the motility
region was quantified after 6 h. (C). Bacteria and surface flagella were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid and imaged using a transmission
electron microscope. (D). Surface flagella were quantified for at least 100 bacteria cells for each strain. Motility assays are representative of three
independent experiments and quantified as means and standard errors. TEM images are representative of two independent experiments.

[25,26]. Pef fimbriae are involved in bacterial adherence
and fluid accumulation in the murine small intestine
[27]. Phylogenetic data indicates that S. Typhimurium
acquired pef as part of the serovar-specific virulence
plasmid [28] which carries variable genetic elements
required for virulence, fimbriae synthesis, plasmid transmission, innate immune resistance and antibiotic resistance [29,30].
The dual regulatory action of PefI-SrgD on both pef
and flagellar promoters is similar to that seen for the
regulation of fimbriae and flagella in other pathogens.
PapX in uropathogenic E. coli acts to reciprocally regulate the expression of type 1 fimbriae and flagella during
urinary tract infection [31]. MrpJ in Proteus mirabilis,
an opportunistic urinary tract pathogen, activates MR/P
fimbrial production while simultaneously repressing flagellar expression [32]. FimZ in S. Typhimurium coordinates reciprocal expression of type 1 fimbriae and
flagella [33]. The existence of regulatory proteins able to

dually control fimbriae and flagella production thus
appears as an important evolutionary mechanism allowing tight modulation of adherence or motility
phenotypes.
Although deletion of pefI-srgD in hha ydgT mutants
de-represses the motility defect by re-establishing
expression of surface flagella, it does not fully reconstitute class II/III and class III promoter activity to wild
type levels suggesting the existence of other negative flagellar regulators. The protease ClpXP has been shown
to degrade FlhD4C2 in S. Typhimurium [34], which may
represent another negative regulatory mechanism in hha
ydgT mutants.
The role of PefI-SrgD in the negative regulation of flagellar biosynthesis exemplifies the evolutionary significance of integrating horizontally acquired regulators
into ancestral networks. For example, in S. Typhimurium, the horizontally acquired two-component regulatory system SsrA-SsrB regulates ancestral genes

Figure 5 Loss of PefI-SrgD induces transient but sufficient Class II/III and III activation to restore flagellar biosynthesis in Δhha ΔydgT.
Promoter activity at each transcriptional class in wild type, Δhha ΔydgT, ΔpefI-srgD and Δhha ΔydgT ΔpefI-srgD was measured as fluorescence
intensity using plasmid-based GFP reporters. A promoterless GFP reporter construct was used as a negative control (first panel). Fluorescence
intensity (485/525 nm) and OD600 was measured at 15 min intervals over 19 h. Data represents fluorescence intensity normalized to OD600 (RLU/
OD600). GFP transcriptional reporter assay data is representative of three independent experiments and quantified as means and standard errors
(at the 3 h time point for PflhD, P < 0.05 for wt vs. Δ pefI-srgD and wt vs. Δhha ΔydgT ΔpefI-srgD; ANOVA, Newman-Keuls multiple comparison
test). After 3-5 hours, PflhD-gfp activity in the quadruple mutant reached the maximum detection limit of the fluorescence reader. Data is shown
for 12 hours rather than for 19 hours for the remaining flagellar reporters as there was no change in the fluorescence levels from 12-19 hours.

throughout the Salmonella genome [5,35]. In extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, the horizontally acquired regulator Hfp interacts with the nucleoid-associated protein
H-NS to regulate ancestral genes [36]. In Shigella flexneri, Sfh is located on a horizontally acquired virulence
plasmid and regulates the expression of the ancestral
proteins H-NS and StpA [37]. Thus, horizontal acquisition of regulatory proteins can have a significant impact
on ancestral gene expression often by interacting with
other regulatory pathways.

Conclusions
We have shown that the non-motile phenotype of Δhha
ΔydgT requires the loss of both Hha and YdgT and that
this phenotype is partially mediated through PefI-SrgD.

These data contribute to our understanding of Hha-and
YdgT-dependent flagellar biosynthesis regulation and
demonstrate the integration of the horizontally acquired
regulators PefI-SrgD into the flagellar biosynthesis
network.

Methods
Bacterial Strains and Mutant Construction

Bacteria were propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at
37°C with aeration unless otherwise indicated. Marked,
in-frame deletions of clpXP and pefI-srgD were made in
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 using
the l Red Recombinase method [38]. Generation of
Δhha ΔydgT was described previously [15] and this
strain was used to generate mutants incorporating the

Soft Agar Motility Assay

Two μl of overnight culture was inoculated into 0.25%
LB Agar motility plates with antibiotic and incubated at
37°C for 6 h.
Immunoblotting

Wild type and mutant strains were cultured until the
optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached ~ 0.4-0.6.
Whole cell lysates were collected and probed using antiFlhC (1:5000), anti-FlhD (1:2500) and anti-DnaK
(1:5000, Stressgen) antibodies. DnaK served as a loading
control.
Transmission Electron Microscopy

Flagella were negatively stained using two different
methods. In the first method, cells were cultured for
3-6 h. A carbon-stabilized Formvar support on 200mesh copper TEM grid was floated for 30 seconds on
a drop of culture, washed three times with water and
stained for 10 seconds using 0.1% uranyl acetate. The
second method involved staining copper grid-immobilized cells for 60 seconds with 2% phosphotungstic
acid. Images were obtained using a JEOL-1200EX
transmission electron microscope at the McMaster
University Electron Microscopy Facility. For quantification, overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 or 1:100
in LB media with antibiotic and grown for at least 3
hours under static conditions. Flagella were stained
as described above and quantified for at least 100
cells.
Transcriptional Reporter Assays

Wild type cells and the various mutants under study
were transformed with the plasmid-based green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs pP flhD -GFP,
pP fliA -GFP, pPfliC -GFP and pPless -GFP published previously [39]. For reporter experiments, strains were
either sub-cultured into culture tubes and propagated
for 6 h at which point fluorescence intensity and OD600
were measured or strains were sub-cultured into 96-well
plates in M9 media containing 0.1% casamino acids and
antibiotic and grown with shaking at 37°C at 1080 cycles
per minute. Fluorescence intensity and OD 600 were
measured at 15 minute intervals for 19 h using a
Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Fisher Scientific Co).
