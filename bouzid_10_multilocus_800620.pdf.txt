Multi-locus analysis of human infective
Cryptosporidium species and subtypes using
ten novel genetic loci

Abstract
Background: Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrheal illness in a wide range of hosts
including humans. Two species, C. parvum and C. hominis are of primary public health relevance. Genome
sequences of these two species are available and show only 3-5% sequence divergence. We investigated this
sequence variability, which could correspond either to sequence gaps in the published genome sequences or to
the presence of species-specific genes. Comparative genomic tools were used to identify putative species-specific
genes and a subset of these genes was tested by PCR in a collection of Cryptosporidium clinical isolates and
reference strains.
Results: The majority of the putative species-specific genes examined were in fact common to C. parvum and C.
hominis. PCR product sequence analysis revealed interesting SNPs, the majority of which were species-specific.
These genetic loci allowed us to construct a robust and multi-locus analysis. The Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic
tree constructed clearly discriminated the previously described lineages of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes.
Conclusions: Most of the genes identified as being species specific during bioinformatics in Cryptosporidium sp.
are in fact present in multiple species and only appear species specific because of gaps in published genome
sequences. Nevertheless SNPs may offer a promising approach to studying the taxonomy of closely related species
of Cryptosporidia.

Background
At least eight Cryptosporidium species infect humans
[1]; however, only two species are of major significance
to public health by causing the majority of human cases
both sporadic and outbreak related cases, C. hominis
and C. parvum [2-5]. Cryptosporidium parvum is zoonotic and infects a wide range of animal hosts including
humans, whereas C. hominis is generally restricted to
humans [6]. Therefore, the main phenotypic difference
between C. hominis and C. parvum is the host range
[1-3]. In addition, these two Cryptosporidium species
differ in geographical and temporal distribution and
pathogenicity [7,8]. Differential risk factors and transmission routes have also been identified [3,7,9]. However human infections are not solely linked to these two

species and other species and genotypes have been associated with illness [10]. These additional species and
genotypes are therefore considered emergent. This was
the case of the rabbit genotype, the aetiological agent in
an outbreak of waterborne human cryptosporidiosis in
Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England [11,12]. Subsequent characterization studies revealed that the rabbit
genotype, which caused this outbreak, corresponds to
Cryptosporidium cuniculus (Inman and Takeuchi, 1979)
[13].
The public health relevance of C. parvum and
C. hominis has driven a bias in Cryptosporidium
research towards these two species. Indeed, the genomes
of C. parvum and C. hominis (IOWA and TU502 reference strains, respectively) have been sequenced [14,15].
The genome sequencing of C. muris, a less relevant
Cryptosporidium species from a public health perspective, is underway [16]. The genomic data for all 3 genome representatives is available online http://CryptoDB.

org. The genome sizes for C. parvum and C. hominis are
9.11 and 9.16 Mb, respectively. The GC content is ~
30% and the coding region is of about 6 Mb [15]. The
number of published genes is slightly higher in C. hominis than in C. parvum: 3,994 genes versus 3,952 genes.
The significance of these 42 missing genes is not clear.
The average gene length is comparable between the 2
species: 1.57 kb and 1.72 kb, for C. hominis and C. parvum, respectively. Genome comparison showed that
C. hominis and C. parvum are very similar. This high
level of sequence similarity limited the ability of comparative genomics to improve annotation, identify conserved non-coding sequence elements and study gene
and protein evolution [16]. More importantly, this high
sequence similarity hindered better understanding of
host specificity and virulence mechanisms as was anticipated from the genome projects [17]. In fact, C. hominis
and C. parvum genomes exhibit only 3-5% sequence
divergence, with no large insertions, deletions or rearrangements [15]. The authors stated that the gene complements of the two species are essentially identical
because the few C. parvum genes not found in C. hominis are proximal to known sequence gaps. However,
uncertainty about the amount of sequence variation
between C. parvum and C. hominis persists due to the
incomplete status of the C. hominis genome. Nevertheless, it has been concluded that the phenotypic differences between C. hominis and C. parvum are caused by
polymorphisms in coding regions and differences in
gene regulation [15,18]. The role of this minimal genetic
variability between C. hominis and C. parvum in the
phenotypic differences is now much more accessible for
investigation. In fact, these genes may include hitherto
valuable epidemiological markers and previously unnoticed genetic determinants of host specificity and virulence. In addition, such markers would also serve as
typing targets.
The aim of this study was to survey the published C.
parvum and C. hominis genomes for incomplete regions
and missing genes in order to identify novel genotyping
markers. These genes are likely to contribute to the phenotypic differences between C. parvum and C. hominis
and therefore might be potential genetic determinants
of host tropism.

Results
Initial screening by Reciprocal Blast and retention of
coding sequences showing a level of similarity below
10% (and supported by significant p values) identified
117 and 272 putative species-specific genes for C. hominis and C. parvum, respectively. The majority of C. parvum putative specific genes were annotated, while C.
hominis putative specific genes corresponded mainly to
hypothetical proteins. Subsequently, the secondary

screen decreased the number of the predicted genes
to 93 and 211 genes for C. hominis and C. parvum,
respectively.
Initially, a subset of ten genes was selected semi-randomly with preference to annotated genes (Table 1).
This subset of genes was tested experimentally by PCR
in a collection of Cryptosporidium clinical isolates and
reference strains (Table 2). Surprisingly, 90% (9/10) of
the genes tested were present in both C. hominis and
C. parvum. PCR results for Cgd2_80 and Chro.50330
genes are shown in Figure 1. There was no discernable
difference between PCR results of C. parvum and
C. hominis clinical isolates and reference strains by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA from isolate Cp4 did not
amplify using Chro.30149 primers. Further testing of
other putative species-specific genes confirmed the general trend. The majority of the predicted genes were
therefore common to both Cryptosporidium species.
Consequently, we considered whether the observed ubiquity of the predicted specific genes represented the closeness between C. hominis and C. parvum or whether
these primers would also amplify orthologous genes
from other Cryptosporidium species. C. meleagridis
DNA was amplified by PCR for 8/10 genes (80%), only,
Cgd2_2430 and Chro.20156 PCR reactions were negative
(Table 3).
Interestingly, for Cgd2_2430 gene, only C. andersoni
DNA was amplified by PCR. For Cgd6_5020, only
C. felis DNA was PCR positive and for Chro.30149 primers, cervine genotype DNA was amplified. C. andersoni, cervine genotype and C. felis DNA was amplified
by 10% (1/10) of primers tested. C. baileyi DNA was
not amplified by any of the primers tested (Table 3).
All positive PCR products were sequenced. PCR product sequences are available online [GenBank:
GU904212-GU904405]. The alignments of PCR product
sequences for each gene are shown [additional file 1].
One PCR product of C. meleagridis DNA using
Chro.50330 primers did not generate good sequence and
was therefore excluded from the analysis. In addition,
PCR products for C. andersoni, C. felis and cervine genotype did not generate good quality sequences and they
were not included in the analysis.
Sequence analysis of these novel genetic loci showed
interesting genetic polymorphisms and 78 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were detected. These SNPs
were detected from a total number of 4150 nucleotides,
corresponding to an average of 1 SNP every 53 bp. The
number of SNPs was variable for each gene, ranging
from 1 SNP every 30 bp for Cgd2_2430 to less than one
SNP per 330 bp for Chro.30149. The SNP results for
each gene are summarized in Table 4. Of the 78 SNPs,
61 (78.3%) were species-specific, thus defining an interesting feature of this subset of genes identified by

comparative genomics. The proportion of species-specific SNPs ranged from 66.7% for Cgd8_2370 and
Chro.50317 genes to 100% for Chro.50330 and
Chro.50457 (Table 4). In addition, 64.2% (50/78) of the
SNPs detected were synonymous, thus maintaining the
protein sequence. The 28 non-synonymous SNPs were
not evenly distributed between the loci. In fact, the proportion of non synonymous SNPs was low for the
majority of the genes ranging from 0% to 25% for
Chro.50330 and Cgd6_200, respectively (Table 4). On
the contrary, for Chro.50317 and Chro.20156 genes,
66.7% and 83.4% of the SNPs were non-synonymous.
The annotations of these genes are RNA polymerase
and hypothetical proteins, respectively. The significance
and effect of these mutations would need to be investigated experimentally. In addition to the 61 species-specific SNPs allowing discrimination between C. hominis
and C. parvum, the sequence analysis showed 5 SNPs
specific for C. cuniculus isolates and 3 SNPs specific for
the anthroponotic C. parvum subtype. The newly identified SNPs were confirmed experimentally by PCR-RFLP,
as sequence alignments were used to identify differential
restriction endonuclease recognition sites between the
main species tested (Data not shown).

SNP analysis was performed in a pair-wise manner
between isolate groups and subtypes using the logical
function “IF” of the Microsoft Excel software to discriminate between variables. When the SNPs were identical between the 2 groups, the value “0” was attributed,
while if the 2 SNPs were different, the value “1” was
assigned and the values summed for each group. The
number of base pair differences between the groups is
shown in Table 5. These scores represent the genetic
variability between the main isolate groups. The newly
identified SNPs showed clear genetic difference patterns
between species and subtypes of Cryptosporidium. It is
noticeable that the genetic differences of C. hominis and
C. parvum to C. meleagridis were comparable (5.50 and
5.05%, respectively). This analysis showed a minimal
genetic variability between C. hominis and C. parvum
(1.72%) (Table 5). Interestingly, the genetic difference
between C. parvum and C. parvum anthroponotic subtype was 0.13%, while a slightly higher genetic difference
was observed between C. hominis and C. cuniculus
isolates (0.27%).
Sequences of the ten genetic loci and of the COWP
(Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein) gene were used
for Multi-locus Analysis (MLA). All the retrieved

sequences allowed comparison of a total 4469 bp. A
Neighbour-Joining Tree was generated based on these
sequences using MEGA software. The tree showed clear
discrimination between C. parvum and C. hominis isolates (Figure 2A). Within each group, there were two
clusters corresponding to isolate subtypes: C. parvum
and C. parvum anthroponotic subtype and C. hominis
and C. cuniculus. All groups and clusters were supported by high bootstrap values. Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) phylogenetic
method was also tested to construct phylogenetic trees
and gave the same topology with similar bootstrap
values (data not shown). There was no discrimination
between the different isolates belonging to the main species groups, despite distinct gp60 subtypes. However,
TU502 strain showed some sequence divergence and
was grouped separately within the C. hominis cluster.
This is due to the presence of a unique SNP at position
132 on Cgd8_2370 gene, which was confirmed by 3
independent rounds of sequencing. Cryptosporidium
meleagridis sequences were included in the MLA and
used as an out group. Cryptosporidium meleagridis
DNA did amplify 8/10 loci tested, however, for 2 loci
(Cgd8_2370 and Chro.50330 genes) the generated
sequences were not of high quality and were not used

for analysis. Therefore, the differences between this
strain and the other isolates were based only on 2853
bp comparisons for 7 genetic loci. The phylogenetic tree
with C. meleagridis as the out group also allowed discrimination of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in a
similar manner than the tree presented in Figure 2A.
The two phylogenetic trees showed similar bootstrap
values (Figure 2A and 2B).

Discussion
In this study, comparative genomic tools were used to
identify putative species-specific genes for C. hominis
and C. parvum based on published genome sequences.
The initial bioinformatics primary and secondary screening allowed the identification of 93 and 211 genes for C.
hominis and C. parvum, respectively. This finding is
somewhat lower than the number of orthologous gene
clusters for C. parvum and C. hominis reported previously in a study of the Apicomplexa [19]. Initially, 10
of these genes were tested by PCR in a collection of
Cryptosporidium clinical isolates and reference strains.
PCR screening of the predicted putative species-specific
genes showed that the majority of the genes were not as
predicted. In fact, 90% of the genes tested were present
in both C. hominis and C. parvum isolates. This would

suggest caution when using lineage-specific genes for
taxonomic analysis at least until published genomes are
known to be complete [19].
The discrepancy between bioinformatics and PCR is
likely to be caused, at least in part, by the fact that the C.
hominis TU502 genome is neither completed nor fully
assembled, which is consistent with the smaller number
of putative C. hominis specific genes as compared to
those specific to C. parvum. However, this seems to be in
disagreement with the finding that the C. hominis genome has 42 genes more than the C. parvum genome.
Nevertheless, it is plausible that the status of the C. hominis genome had hindered the accuracy of the initial comparative genomic analysis because the selected genes may
correspond to sequence gaps reported by the authors
[15]. Further testing of an additional ten predicted putative specific genes for each species confirmed the general
trend of similar amplification from both species. Therefore, the majority of the genes seem to be common to
both species. However, an improved comparative genomic analysis has been made possible by the fast progress

made towards the completion of C. muris genome. At
the time of writing, 8.9 Mb from the C. muris genome
have been made available for download from CryptoDB,
of which 7.2 Mb corresponding to coding sequences.
Based on these newly added genomic sequences, 7/10
(70%) of the selected putative species-specific genes
appear to have orthologs in C. muris. This information, if
known previously, would have decreased dramatically the
number of putative species-specific genes predicted by
comparative genomics. Despite this limitation, only one
C. parvum and one C. hominis gene were shown experimentally by PCR to be putatively specific, the characterisation of these genes is ongoing.
We considered whether the observed ubiquity of the
predicted specific genes represented the closeness
between C. hominis and C. parvum or whether these
primers would also amplify orthologous genes from
other Cryptosporidium species by testing DNA from C.
andersoni, C. felis, cervine genotype, C. meleagridis and
C. baileyi. Cryptosporidium meleagridis DNA amplified
using 80% of the primers tested, while, C. andersoni,

not amplify with primers of Cgd2_2430 and Chro.20156.
This could be explained by either nucleotide mismatch
in the primer region or that the genes were missing.
PCR screening and sequencing of genes found experimentally to be common to both species provided de
novo sequence information at incomplete regions of the
Cryptosporidium genomes and was used to examine
polymorphism in these regions. PCR product sequence
analysis revealed interesting genetic variation as SNPs.
In this study, 78 SNPs were detected, 78.3% (61) of
which were species-specific. The presence of speciesspecific SNPs was reported previously from several
genetic markers and has been exploited for Cryptosporidium genotyping and subtyping [21]. PCR-RFLP of the
SSU rRNA [22], COWP [23], dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) gene [24], thrombospondin related adhesive protein of Cryptosporidium-1 (TRAP-C1) [25] and TRAP-C2
[26], polythreonine (Poly-T) repeats [27]and heat shock
protein 70 (HSP70) [28] genes allow discrimination
between Cryptosporidium species from various sources.
In a similar manner, the newly identified SNPs could be
also used for Cryptosporidium genotyping, especially by
PCR-RFLP and/or sequencing. The majority of the SNPs
detected (64.2%) were synonymous. It has long been
assumed that synonymous SNPs are inconsequential as
the primary sequence of the protein is preserved. However, it has been demonstrated that synonymous mutations can alter the structure, function and expression
level of the protein by affecting messenger RNA splicing,
stability, protein folding and structure [29]. In addition,
Ge and colleagues [30] used a genome wide analysis and
described a high number of nucleotide substitution patterns in C. parvum and C. hominis orthologous protein
coding genes. The authors also reported a high number
of non-synonymous SNPs in genes involved in hostparasite interactions, mainly genes with transmembrane
domains or signal peptides [30].

The sequence analysis of C. meleagridis PCR products
allowed data enrichment as this species is distant from C.
hominis and C. parvum. In fact, among the genes assessed
here, C. meleagridis species had 108 additional SNPs, 20 of
which are in the Chro.30149 gene. For Chro.30149 gene, C.
meleagridis has in average 1 SNP every 15 nucleotide. Surprisingly, all C. meleagridis SNPs are synonymous. Interestingly, no SNP was detected in this gene from C. hominis
and C. parvum DNA. Chro.30149 has a predicted function
as Ubiquitin ligase. This gene is a housekeeping gene and
shows a low level of sequence divergence between species
and isolates when compared to contingency genes consistently under environmental pressure and characterized by
higher spontaneous mutation rates [31].
The newly identified SNPs were used to determine
genetic differences between the main Cryptosporidium
species and subtypes tested. This analysis showed that
the genetic difference between C. hominis and C. parvum was only 1.72%. Within C. parvum group, the
anthroponotic subtype isolates showed only 0.12% from
the main zoonotic C. parvum isolates. The C. cuniculus
isolates exhibited 0.27% genetic differences to
C. hominis isolates. In addition, extremely low sequence
variability between C. hominis and C. cuniculus was
observed using the common genotyping loci [13]. Based
on these data and supported by morphological analysis
and experimental infection, rabbit genotype was considered synonymous with C. cuniculus [13].
In addition, sequence analysis allowed us to perform a
robust and novel MLA. The Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree clearly grouped and discriminated with high
bootstrap values the previously described lineages of
Cryptosporidium subtypes. Therefore, these genetic loci
represent potential powerful targets for Cryptosporidium
genotyping and subtyping purposes. Especially since
these genes are stable and slow mutating, unlike the
currently used Cryptosporidium typing targets (gp60,
mini- and microsatellites).
Mini and Microsatellites are repetitive versatile DNA
repeats known to influence the structure and expression
of protein-coding genes and to be responsive to environmental signals [32,33]. The microsatellites abundance
and high variability made them the genetic markers of
choice for several applications (individual identity,

forensics, parentage, genetic structure, epidemiology and
phylogenetics [34]. However, because of the instability
of microsatellite markers, extra care should be taken
when interpreting microsatellite-based typing data [35].
Similarly, gp60 is hypervariable and under selective pressure as it mediates parasite attachment to host cells
[36]. In fact, discrepancies and limitations of these markers for Cryptosporidium typing have been reported.
Hunter and colleagues [37] described the difficulty in
interpreting the presence of different subtypes in outbreak setting and Widmer [38] reported that gp60 might
not be a reliable marker of C. parvum and C. hominis
population structure. The ten novel loci, described in
this study, showed excellent discriminatory power and
consistency to assess phylogenetic relationships at the
species and infra-species levels. These findings suggest
that these loci could be alternative valuable genotyping
and subtyping targets for Cryptosporidium. However,
their stability should be assessed in an extensive collection of isolates from different subtype families and geographical locations to validate their discriminatory
power.

Conclusions
In this study, comparative genomics were used to identify putative C. parvum and C. hominis species-specific
genes. Despite the fact that the majority of the predicted
genes were common to both species and some to C.
meleagridis, experimental evidence was found for one
specific gene for each species. The ten novel genetic loci
studied showed an interesting polymorphism. In fact,
sequence analysis of PCR products revealed multiple
SNPs, the majority of which were species-specific. These
SNPs were stable and consistent across Cryptosporidium
species and subtypes. These results showed that the ten
novel genetic loci can potentially be used to assess the
phylogenetic distance and relationships at the species
and infra-species level of human infective Cryptosporidium isolates. In addition, the paired SNP analysis was
found to be a good strategy to assess the genetic divergence of the isolates tested.
Methods
Reciprocal Blast was used to identify genes with high
sequence variability between C. parvum and C. hominis.
This is a variant of Blast (Basic local alignment search
tool), originally described by Altschul and colleagues
[39] and is a common computational tool for predicting
putative orthologs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
blast_overview.shtml. Subsequently, each of the ~ 3900
genes of C. parvum and C. hominis was assigned a similarity score. Only sequences which returned genes with
less than 10% sequence similarity from the other genome were considered. These coding sequences are

Page 9 of 11

putatively species-specific genes. A secondary screen
was performed as follows: each gene was individually
tested using Blastn algorithm http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi to confirm specificity and reveal any
sequence similarity to genes from other Cryptosporidium species. Furthermore, orthology queries were performed using CryptoDB database. Whenever a gene
showed sequence similarity, it was eliminated from the
selection. This secondary screen increased the prediction
stringency.
Amongst the putative species-specific genes, initially 10
genes were selected with preference to annotated genes
and tested experimentally by PCR. For each gene, a pair of
primers was designed using OligoPerfect™ Designer software http://www.invitrogen.com and supplied by Operon/
Eurofins MWG (Cologne, Germany). Table 1 details the
genes selected, the primer sequences and the PCR product
sizes for each gene tested. In addition, reference primers
Cry15 and Cry9 amplifying a 555 bp of the COWP gene
[23] were used as a positive control. PCR conditions were
carried out as described previously [40]. PCR screening of
putative species genes was performed by testing a panel of
DNA clinical samples isolated as described previously [41]
and archived in the national collection at the UK Cryptosporidium Reference Unit (CRU) [42]. Each isolate was
characterised initially by PCR-RFLP of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene [23] and by realtime PCR using simplex Lib 13 primers for C. parvum and
C. hominis [43] prior to sequencing part of the SSU rRNA
and gp60 genes [44,45]. A total number of 14 Cryptosporidium clinical isolates was tested (Table 2). This includes
DNA from three C. hominis isolates (Ch2, Ch3 and Ch4),
3 C. parvum isolates (Cp2, Cp3, and Cp4) and 4 C. parvum anthroponotic subtype isolates (W7265, W7266,
W7267 and W7270). The anthroponotic C. parvum group
isolates were previously identified as gp60 subtype family
IIc (CRU unpublished data). This subtype family was
reported to infect only humans, and was never reported in
an animal species [1]. The anthroponotic nature of the IIc
subtype family was supported by extensive subtyping
investigations of human and bovine cryptosporidiosis in
Portugal, USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands and Australia [1,46-48]. In addition, the DNA of one
rabbit genotype (C. cuniculus) isolate from the Northamptonshire outbreak [12] and three sporadic cases (Chalmers
et al., manuscript in preparation) were also analysed.
These DNA samples originated from patients with cryptosporidial diarrhoea from different geographical locations
in UK and were chosen as a representative collection of
the different strains circulating in the country. Furthermore, the genomic DNA of 3 reference strains C. parvum
Iowa (ATCC/LGC Promochem, Teddington, UK), C. parvum Moredun (Moredun Research Institute, Midlothian,
UK) and C. hominis TU502 (BEI Resources, Manassas,

Bouzid et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:213

USA) were tested. Table 5 details the origin and the genotyping data of the tested isolates. In addition, we considered whether the designed primers would amplify
orthologous genes from other Cryptosporidium species,
therefore, DNA from other Cryptosporidium species and
genotypes was kindly donated by CRU and tested; this
includes C. andersoni (W13086), C. felis (W14508), cervine genotype (W15916), C. meleagridis (W10509) and C.
baileyi (W14184).
Positive PCR products were purified using QIAquick®
PCR purification Kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK). Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions
using PCR primers. We used 2 independent sequencing
facilities: the genome lab, John Innes Centre http://
www.jicgenomelab.co.uk and the sequencing service at
the University of Dundee http://www.dnaseq.co.uk, both
using Dye-terminator chemistry technology and Applied
Biosystems automated capillary DNA sequencer (3770
and 3730 model, respectively). Sequences were
assembled using CAP3 software http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/
cap3.php[49] and aligned using AlignX® application of
Vector NTI Advance™ 10 software http://www.Invitrogen.com. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using
MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis) software http://www.megasoftware.net[50].
