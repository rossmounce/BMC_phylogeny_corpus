Abstract
Background: The production of Citrus, the largest fruit crop of international economic value, has recently been imperiled due
to the introduction of the bacterial disease Citrus canker. No significant improvements have been made to combat this disease
by plant breeding and nuclear transgenic approaches. Chloroplast genetic engineering has a number of advantages over nuclear
transformation; it not only increases transgene expression but also facilitates transgene containment, which is one of the major
impediments for development of transgenic trees. We have sequenced the Citrus chloroplast genome to facilitate genetic
improvement of this crop and to assess phylogenetic relationships among major lineages of angiosperms.
Results: The complete chloroplast genome sequence of Citrus sinensis is 160,129 bp in length, and contains 133 genes (89
protein-coding, 4 rRNAs and 30 distinct tRNAs). Genome organization is very similar to the inferred ancestral angiosperm
chloroplast genome. However, in Citrus the infA gene is absent. The inverted repeat region has expanded to duplicate rps19 and
the first 84 amino acids of rpl22. The rpl22 gene in the IRb region has a nonsense mutation resulting in 9 stop codons. This was
confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the IR/LSC boundaries. Repeat analysis identified 29
direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity ≥ 90%. Comparison of protein-coding sequences with
expressed sequence tags revealed six putative RNA edits, five of which resulted in non-synonymous modifications in petL, psbH,
ycf2 and ndhA. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods of a dataset
composed of 61 protein-coding genes for 30 taxa provide strong support for the monophyly of several major clades of
angiosperms, including monocots, eudicots, rosids and asterids. The MP and ML trees are incongruent in three areas: the
position of Amborella and Nymphaeales, relationship of the magnoliid genus Calycanthus, and the monophyly of the eurosid I clade.
Both MP and ML trees provide strong support for the monophyly of eurosids II and for the placement of Citrus (Sapindales) sister
to a clade including the Malvales/Brassicales.
Conclusion: This is the first complete chloroplast genome sequence for a member of the Rutaceae and Sapindales. Expansion
of the inverted repeat region to include rps19 and part of rpl22 and presence of two truncated copies of rpl22 is unusual among
sequenced chloroplast genomes. Availability of a complete Citrus chloroplast genome sequence provides valuable information
on intergenic spacer regions and endogenous regulatory sequences for chloroplast genetic engineering. Phylogenetic analyses
resolve relationships among several major clades of angiosperms and provide strong support for the monophyly of the eurosid
II clade and the position of the Sapindales sister to the Brassicales/Malvales.

Background
Chloroplasts are dynamic organelles of prokaryotic origin
within the plant cell that house the photosynthetic apparatus. In addition to photosynthesis, other important metabolic activities take place within chloroplasts including
the production of starch, certain amino acids and lipids,
some of the colorful pigments in flowers, vitamins and
several key aspects of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism.
Chloroplasts possess their own genome and a full complement of transcriptional and translation machinery to
express their genetic information. In particular, chloroplast gene expression machinery is a distinctive assembly
of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and phage-like components–
likely the result of acquisition of a great number of regulatory proteins during evolution. The presence of nucleic
acids within chloroplasts was established in 1963 [1]. This
subsequently led to the selection of cpDNA as one of the
first candidates for complete genome sequencing [2].
Studies of the organization and evolution of chloroplast
genomes have been rapidly expanding due to the availability of the number of completely sequenced genomes
published in the past decade. Fifty-four completed
genomes are available from various land plant lineages,
with the best representation (36 species) from flowering
plants. Comparative studies indicate that chloroplast
genomes of land plants are highly conserved in both gene
order and gene content [3]. Moreover, the substitution
rate in cpDNA is much lower than in nuclear DNA and
significantly reduced in the inverted repeat regions as
compared to the single copy regions [4].
Chloroplast bioengineering offers a number of advantages over nuclear transformation including high levels of
transgene expression and gene containment [5]. In addition, chloroplast genetic engineering has also become a
powerful tool for basic research in biogenesis and function of this organelle. This approach has helped unveil a
wealth of information about cpDNA replication origins,
introns, maturases, translation elements, proteolysis,
import of proteins and several other processes [5]. However, this technology is readily feasible only in tobacco.
Lack of complete chloroplast genome sequence is still one
of the major limitations preventing the expansion of chloroplast bioengineering to other useful crops. Transgene
integration into the chloroplast genome occurs exclusively by homologous recombination of chloroplast DNA
flanking sequences. Therefore, chloroplast genome
sequence analysis is crucial for identification of spacer
regions to integrate transgenes at optimal positions as
well as the identification of endogenous regulatory
sequences that support optimal expression of transgenes
[5]. Prior to 2004 only seven published crop chloroplast
genomes were available and this number has increased to
23 during the past two years [6]. Furthermore, the availability of genome sequence information has also made it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/21

possible to study evolutionary relationships among chloroplast and nuclear genomes [7].
Citrus is the largest fruit crop of international economic
value because of its many uses including its value as a
nutritive food source and for its valuable essential oils utilized by the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. The valuable Citrus industry in Florida (USA) has
recently been put in peril because of the accidental introduction of the exotic disease Citrus canker. This bacterial
disease, which can infect all cultivars of Citrus, is the result
of infection by Xanthomonas pv citri [8]. Elimination of this
disease by eradication has resulted in a cost of $1.2 billion
(US) and the destruction of 7 million commercial and 5
million nursery and residential trees (pers. comm. T.R.
Gottwald). Attempts at resistance breeding in Citrus are
impeded by many biological characteristics, such as juvenility, incompatibility, heterozygosity, a narrow genetic
basis, and nucellar embryony. In this context, genetic
engineering of the chloroplast genome with non-host
resistance traits would be an effective alternative for transferring desirable traits because of its many advantages
over nuclear transformation [5]. However, for Citrus,
genetic improvement through chloroplast transformation
has been limited due to the lack of available chloroplast
genome sequence, not only in the genus Citrus but also in
the entire family Rutaceae.
In this article, we report on the complete sequence of the
chloroplast genome of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck var.
'Ridge Pineapple', which is the first published whole
genome sequence of a member of the family Rutaceae and
order Sapindales. We describe the organization of this
genome and we present a phylogenetic analysis of Citrus
and 27 other angiosperm chloroplast genomes based on
61 shared protein-coding genes. The phylogenetic comparisons enable an examination of relationships among
several major clades of angiosperms.

Results
Size, gene content, order and organization of the Citrus
chloroplast genome
The complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast
genome of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck var 'Ridge Pineapple'
has been determined (Fig. 1). This genome is 160,129 bp
in length and includes a pair of inverted repeats (IR) of
26,996 bp separated by small and large single copy (SSC,
LSC) regions of 18,393 bp and 87,744 bp, respectively. A
total of 133 genes was detected, 113 are single copy, while
20 are duplicated in inverted repeat regions. Eighty-nine
genes code for proteins, including nine genes duplicated
in the inverted repeat. There are four rRNA genes and 30
distinct tRNAs, 7 of which are duplicated in the inverted
repeat. Seventeen genes have introns, 14 of which contain
a single intron while three (clpP, rps12, ycf3) have two

Circular gene map of Citrus sinensis chloroplast genome
Circular gene map of Citrus sinensis chloroplast genome. The
thick lines indicate the extent of the inverted repeats (IRa
and IRb, 26,996 bp), which separate the genome into small
(SSC, 18,393 bp) and large (LSC, 87,744) single copy regions.
Genes on the outside of the map are transcribed in the

introns. The genome consists of 49.94% protein-coding,
42.65% non-coding, 1.74% tRNA and 5.65% rRNA genes.
The GC and AT content in the Citrus chloroplast genome
is 38.48% and 61.52%, respectively. The overall AT content is similar to tobacco (62.2%), rice (61.1%) and maize
(61.5%). The AT content of the LSC and SSC regions are
63.19% and 66.66% respectively, whereas that of the IRregions is 57.05% due to the presence of an rRNA gene
cluster. infA, a gene coding for a translation initiation factor in other plant species, is absent in the Citrus genome.
The inverted repeat region has expanded to duplicate
rps19 and the first 84 amino acids of rpl22. The rpl22 gene
in the IRb region has a nonsense mutation resulting in 9
stop codons. Both the IR expansion and the presence of
internal stop codons in rpl22 were confirmed by PCR
amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the
IR/LSC boundaries.

Variation between coding sequences and cDNAs
DNA and EST sequences were compared by aligning the
~92,000 publicly available Citrus sinensis expressed
sequence tag (EST) sequences with the genes extracted
from completed Citrus chloroplast genome sequence. Five
non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions were identified in the protein-coding transcripts of petL, psbH, ycf2
and ndhA (Table 2). In ycf2 two amino acid substitutions
were found, which resulted in a change from hydrophobic
non-polar to hydrophilic acidic and hydrophilic polar
amino acids, respectively. The substitution in the ndhA
protein resulted in a change from a hydrophilic polar to a
hydrophobic non-polar. In contrast, only one synonymous substitution was detected in transcripts coding for
rps18. In non-protein-coding regions, seven additional
differences were detected, including one in the intron of
ycf3 and five in the ribosomal RNA gene rrn23 (Table 2).
The differences could be due to mRNA editing, sequencing error, or polymorphisms between the tissues used for
genome versus EST sequencing.
Phylogenetic analysis
The data matrix for phylogenetic analyses included 61
protein-coding genes for 30 taxa, including 28
angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups (Pinus and
Ginkgo). The data set comprised 45,573 aligned nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there
were 39,618 characters. Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length
of 53,085, a consistency index of 0.45 (excluding uninformative characters) and a retention index of 0.60 (Fig.
2). Bootstrap analyses indicated that 25 of the 27 nodes
were supported by values ≥ 95%. Maximum Likelihood
(ML) analysis resulted in a single tree with a ML value of
– lnL = 305916.24523 (Fig. 3). The ML and MP trees differed in the relationships among three groups (compare
Figs. 2, 3). First, the MP tree placed Amborella alone as the
earliest diverging angiosperm lineage and this position
was strongly supported with a 100% bootstrap value. In
contrast, the ML tree provided weak support (57% bootstrap value) for a sister relationship between Amborella
and the Nymphaeales at the base of angiosperms. Second,
in the MP tree Calycanthus, the only representative of magnoliids, was positioned sister to eudicots with moderate
bootstrap support of 73%. In the ML tree, Calycanthus was
weakly supported (52% bootstrap value) as sister to a
clade that includes both monocots and eudicots. Third,

cytoplasmic male sterility [12], lack of gene silencing
[9,13], position effect due to site specific transgene integration [14], and lack of pleiotropic effects due to sub-cellular compartmentalization of transgene products [1517]. Apart from expressing therapeutic agents [18],
biopolymers [19] or transgenes to confer valuable agronomic traits, including herbicide resistance [20], disease
resistance [21], insect resistance [22], drought tolerance
[16], salt tolerance [23], and phytoremediation [24], chloroplast genetic engineering has been used to study chloroplast biogenesis and function, revealing the mechanisms
of DNA replication origins, intron maturases, translation

elements and proteolysis, import of proteins, and several
other processes [25]. Despite the potential of chloroplast
genetic engineering, this technology has only recently
been extended to the major crops, including soybean [26],
carrot [23], lettuce [27], and cotton [28].
The availability of complete sequences of chloroplast
genomes enhances their use for genetic engineering. In
chloroplast transformation, finding appropriate intergenic spacer regions is very important for efficient integration of transgenes. In tomato and potato, researchers have
used trnfM-trnG, rbcL-accD, trnV-3'-rps12, and 16S rRNA-

orf 70B intergenic spacer regions of tobacco to integrate
transgenes [29-31]. Unfortunately, none of these regions
have 100% sequence identity [6]. For example, the intergenic spacer region between rbcL and accD of potato and
tobacco shows only 94% sequence identity. Subsequently, potato chloroplast transformants are generated at
10–30 times lower frequencies than tobacco [31]. Similarly, the trnfM and trnG intergenic spacer region used for
tomato chloroplast transformation has only 82%
sequence identity with tobacco, resulting in inefficient
transgene integration. There are major deletions in the
tomato chloroplast genome in this intergenic spacer
region when compared to tobacco, which was used for
transformation [6]. Therefore, the development of species-specific vectors for transgene integration would enable the use of any of the intergenic spacer regions within
the respective chloroplast genomes [6]. Moreover,
genome organization is different among some species. For
instance the rbcL and accD genes are adjacent in tobacco
and most other angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including Citrus. However, they are not adjacent in the soybean
chloroplast genome because an inversion has altered gene
order [32]. These examples emphasize the importance of
choosing appropriate intergenic spacer regions for chloroplast transformation.

nuclear encoded protein has been demonstrated [32,35].
Our group recently reported that rpl22 was also missing in
the cotton chloroplast genome [36] but it turns out that
this was an annotation error. The lack of a functional copy
of rpl22 in Citrus should be investigated further, including
an expanded sampling of members of the Rutaceae and
Sapindales.

Genome organization
Gene order of the Citrus genome is identical to the published genome sequences of the Solanaceae [6], which
have the inferred ancestral angiosperm genome organization [3]. The rps19 gene and the first 84 amino acids of
rpl22, which generally are single copy in the LSC on the
IRb side, have been duplicated in Citrus. Thus, there is a
complete, second copy of rps19 and a truncated copy of
rpl22 adjacent to trnH. This duplication is likely due to an
expansion of IRb at the LSC junction, a common process
in chloroplast genomes [33]. The gene content of Citrus is
also very similar to most other angiosperm chloroplast
genomes. However, infA, a gene coding for a translation
initiation factor in other plant species, is absent in the Citrus genome, and rpl22 is apparently not functional due to
a frame shift mutation. Millen et al. [34] demonstrated at
least 24 independent losses of infA in angiosperms, and in
four lineages this gene has been shown to be transferred
to the nucleus. Three of these losses are evident in our
phylogeny based on cpDNA sequences (indicated by bars
in Figs. 2, 3). Among the rosid genomes sequenced the
infA loss has occurred only once and this change supports
the basal split between Vitis and the rest of the rosids (Figs.
2, 3). The rpl22 gene in the IRb region has a nonsense
mutation resulting in 9 stop codons indicating that this
gene is not functional. This was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the IR/
LSC boundaries. The rpl22 gene has been reported to be
missing in legume chloroplast genomes and the import of

Our chloroplast genome trees (Figs. 2, 3) indicate that the
earliest diverging angiosperm lineage is either Amborella
or Amborella + Nymphaeales. This incongruence between
MP and ML trees was noted previously [37,39]. This same
incongruence was observed in a multigene phylogeny that
includes nine genes from the chloroplast, mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes [40]. In this case, phylogenies for
chloroplast genes supported the Amborella basal hypothesis, whereas mitochondrial genes supported Amborella +
Nymphaeales as the earliest angiosperm lineage.

Repeat analysis identified 29 direct and inverted repeats
30 bp or longer with a sequence identity ≥ 90% in the Citrus chloroplast genome with the longest repeat, other than
the IR, 53 bp in length (Table 1). The presence of dispersed repeats in chloroplast genomes, especially in intergenic spacer regions, has been reported in a number of
angiosperm lineages, including other rosids [37].
Phylogenetic implications
Phylogenies based on 61 protein-coding genes (Figs. 2, 3)
generally agree with several recent studies based on multiple genes or complete chloroplast genomes [37-39]. Areas
of congruence that are strongly supported include the
monophyly of monocots and their sister relationship to
eudicots, monophyly of rosids and asterids, and the sister
relationship between Caryophyllales (represented by
Spinacia) and asterids.

A second incongruence between MP and ML trees concerns the position of the magnoliid Calycanthus, although
bootstrap support for the different relationships is weak
(Figs. 2, 3). The MP tree places Calycanthus sister to eudicots, whereas the ML tree positions this taxon sister to a
clade that includes both monocots and eudicots. This
same incongruence was observed in previous phylogenetic analyses based on the 61 protein-coding chloroplast
genes [37,39]. The position of magnoliids continues to be
controversial. Several molecular phylogenies have suggested different sets of relationships among magnoliids,
monocots, and eudicots. Phylogenies based on phytochrome [41] and 17 chloroplast [42] genes placed magnoliids sister to monocots + eudicots but bootstrap support
was weak. Several studies supported monocots as the sister group of magnoliids + eudicots [43-45] but bootstrap
support was again weak. Both matK [46] and three gene
[38] phylogenies suggested that eudicots are sister to mag-

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:21

noliids + monocots. Finally, the nine-gene phylogeny of
Qiu et al. [40] recovered all three of these sets of relationships depending on the phylogenetic methods (MP or
ML) and the genes used but support was very weak in each
case. The different resolutions of relationships of magnoliids are greatly affected by taxon sampling and phylogenetic methodology. The affects of both of these
phenomena have been discussed in several recent papers
on the utility of whole chloroplast genomes for phylogenetic reconstruction of angiosperms [37,39,47-52].
Clearly, additional complete chloroplast genome
sequences are needed to resolve the relationships among
magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots.
A third incongruence between the MP and ML trees concerns the monophyly of the eurosid I clade (Figs. 2, 3).
The MP tree (Fig. 2) strongly supports the monophyly of
eurosid I (100% bootstrap), whereas in the ML tree the
eurosid I clade in not monophyletic because Cucumis is
strongly sister to the Myrtales instead of the Fabales. This
same incongruence was detected in Jansen et al. [37] and
was attributed to limited taxon sampling and model misspecification in ML analyses, two phenomena that are
known to have adverse effects on phylogenetic reconstruction [53-57]. Expanded taxon sampling of rosids is
needed to critically evaluate the monophyly of the eurosid
I clade, especially since there is only moderate support for
monophyly of eurosid I in previous phylogenies based on
a single or few genes [reviewed in 58].
Both MP and ML trees are congruent with regard to the
phylogenetic placement of Citrus. The genus is positioned
as a member of the eurosid II clade, which has very strong
bootstrap support in both MP (98%) and ML (100%)
trees (Fig. 2). The eurosid II clade, which currently
includes the four groups Brassicales, Malvales, Sapindales,
and Tapisciaceae, has received strong support in previous
DNA sequence phylogenies based on one to three genes
[38], although relationships among these groups remain
unresolved. Previous phylogenies based on whole chloroplast genomes [36,37,39,59] have included only one or
two groups (Arabidopsis, Brassicales and/or Gossypium,
Malvales). The addition of Citrus from the Sapindales
expands the sampling to three of four currently recognized groups of eurosids II. Both MP and ML trees (Figs.
2, 3) provide strong support (98 – 100% bootstrap) for a
sister relationship between the Brassicales and Malvales.
This same relationship was weakly supported based on
phylogenies using one or two chloroplast genes [46,60].
In contrast, the three gene phylogeny of Soltis et al. [38]
weakly supported a sister relationship between the Malvales and Sapindales. Although taxon sampling is still somewhat limited, our 61-gene phylogeny provides very strong
support for a close relationship between the Brassicales

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/21

and Malvales. Expanded taxon sampling of the eurosid II
clade is needed to confirm these results.

Conclusion
Complete chloroplast genome sequences provide valuable information on spacer regions for integration of transgenes at optimal sites via homologous recombination, as
well as endogenous regulatory sequences for optimal
expression of transgenes and should help in extending
this technology to other useful crops. Availability of complete chloroplast genome sequence should pave the way
for genetic manipulation of Citrus and other members of
the Rutaceae. Furthermore, the addition of the Citrus
genome sequence to phylogenetic analyses provides
strong support for the monophyly of the eurosid II clade,
and the sister group relationship between the Sapindales
and the Brassicales/Malvales clade.

Methods
Source of DNA
Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck var 'Ridge Pineapple' leaf tissue
was chosen as the source plant material because it is being
used in the US and international effort to sequence the
Citrus genome. The lamellar tissue used was obtained
from field-grown mature trees. Chloroplast DNA was isolated as described Jansen et al. [61]. Chloroplast DNA was
subjected to rolling circle amplification (RCA) using the
Repli-g kit following the manufacturers instructions
(Molecular Staging Inc, New Haven, CT.).
DNA sequencing and genome assembly
Purified RCA products were subjected to nebulization, followed by end repair and size-fractionated by agarose gel
electrophoresis to obtain fragment lengths ranging from
2.0–3.5 kb. Repaired products were blunt-end cloned into
pCR®-4Blunt-TOPO and then transformed into ElectroMax™ DH5alpha cells by electroporation (TOPO® shotgun
cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformed cells
were selected on LB agar containing 100 μg/μL ampicillin
and arrayed into 30 × 96-well microtitre plates. Sequencing reactions were carried out in both the forward and
reverse direction using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
sequencing kit and separated by a 3730xL DNA sequence
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence
data were assembled using Sequencher v4.5 (GeneCodes
Ann Arbor, MI) following quality and vector trimming.
Gap regions were filled by sequencing PCR fragments generated from primers designed to flank the gaps. The
assembly was considered complete when sequence with
confidence scores of ≥ 20 as judged by KB Basecaller software (Applied Biosystems) was accumulated at every base
position with at least 4X coverage.

Confirmation of IR expansion
To confirm the IR expansion that results in duplication of
the genes rps19 and rpl22, PCR amplicons were generated
that overlapped the junction of IRa and IRb with the LSC
region. Primer sequences were as follows: rpl22F 5'CAAAGCCCGCCAGGTAATTG-3' and psbAR 5'-CATTTCTTCCTGGCTGCTTG-3' for the amplicon overlapping IRa
and LSC region and rpl22R 5'-GGAGAATTTGCGCCCACTAT-3' and rpsF 5'-CTATCCGTGCAATTCCCTCA-3' for the
amplicon overlapping IRb and LSC region. Following
PCR, the amplicons were cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO
vector following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), then sequenced using methods described above.
Gene annotation
The Citrus sinensis genome was annotated using DOGMA
[Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator, 62]. Further,
searches against a custom database of the previously published chloroplast genomic sequences using BLASTX were
used to identify additional putative protein-coding genes.
Both tRNAs and rRNAs were identified by searches against
the same database using BLASTN.
Repeat analysis
To determine the repeat structure of the Citrus chloroplast
genome, REPuter [63] was used to identify the number
and location of direct and inverted (palindromic) repeats
using a minimum repeat size of 30 bp and a Hamming
distance of 3 (i.e., repfind -f -p -l 30 -h 3 -best 10000).
Variation between coding sequences and cDNAs
Positional determination of potential RNA edits was
accomplished using 1505 cp sequences from GenBank
without chromatographic traces in addition to in-house
Citrus sinensis ESTs that contained chromatograms [64].
Only regions having a redundancy of at least four ESTs at
each position were considered in the analysis. Differences
were counted only when a base change was observed in
the consensus sequence based on plurality. All assembly
comparisons were made with the help of Sequencher
v4.5.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using PAUP* version 4.10 b10 [65]. Phylogenetic analyses excluded gap
regions to avoid ambiguity in regions where alignment
was problematic. All MP searches included 100 random
addition replicates and TBR branch swapping with the
Multrees option. Modeltest 3.7 [66] was used to determine the most appropriate model of DNA sequence evolution for the combined 61-gene dataset. Hierarchical
likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion
were used to assess which of the 56 models best fit the
data, which was determined to be GTR + G + I by both criteria. For ML analyses we performed an initial parsimony

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/21

search with 100 random addition sequence replicates and
TBR branch swapping, which resulted in a single tree.
Model parameters were optimized onto the parsimony
tree. We fixed these parameters and performed a ML analysis with three random addition sequence replicates and
TBR branch swapping. The resulting ML tree was used to
re-optimize model parameters, which then were fixed for
another ML search with three random addition sequence
replicates and TBR branch swapping. This successive
approximation procedure [67] was repeated until the
same tree topology and model parameters were recovered
in multiple, consecutive iterations. Successive approximation has been shown to perform as well as full-optimization for both empirical and simulated datasets [67]. Nonparametric bootstrap analyses [68] were performed for
MP analyses with 1000 replicates with TBR branch swapping, 1 random addition replicate, and the Multrees
option and for ML analyses with 100 replicates with NNI
branch swapping, 1 random addition replicate, and the
Multrees option.
