Feather barbs as a good source of mtDNA for
bird species identification in forensic wildlife
investigations
Camilla F Speller1,2, George P Nicholas3 and Dongya Y Yang1*

Abstract
Background: The ability to accurately identify bird species is crucial for wildlife law enforcement and bird-strike
investigations. However, such identifications may be challenging when only partial or damaged feathers are
available for analysis.
Results: By applying vigorous contamination controls and sensitive PCR amplification protocols, we found that it
was feasible to obtain accurate mitochondrial (mt)DNA-based species identification with as few as two feather
barbs. This minimally destructive DNA approach was successfully used and tested on a variety of bird species,
including North American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), blue heron (Ardea
herodias) and pygmy owl (Glaucidium californicum). The mtDNA was successfully obtained from ‘fresh’ feathers,
historic museum specimens and archaeological samples, demonstrating the sensitivity and versatility of this
technique.
Conclusions: By applying appropriate contamination controls, sufficient quantities of mtDNA can be reliably
recovered and analyzed from feather barbs. This previously overlooked substrate provides new opportunities for
accurate DNA species identification when minimal feather samples are available for forensic analysis.

Background
Accurate identification of bird species is crucial for wildlife law enforcement and other aspects of wildlife forensics. Currently, many birds and bird products (such as
feathers) are protected under the US Migratory Bird
Treaty (MBTA), the US Endangered Species Act (ESA)
and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Identification of these protected
species by law enforcement personnel may be challenging when only partial or damaged feathers are available
for examination. Additionally, other criminal investigations, such as bird larceny, may also be contingent upon
accurate species identification of bird feathers [1].
Although morphologically-based identifications are possible when feathers are complete and intact, they may
be unfeasible when feathers have been modified, dyed or

damaged. In such cases, DNA-based species identification techniques can be far more accurate.
Feathers are made up of a calamus (or basal quill),
which extends into the rachis (or main shaft), which
then supports the barbs [2]. Most current DNA-extraction techniques for feathers are focused on the calamus.
DNA is typically isolated from calamus cells, requiring
the destruction of 5 to 10 mm of the feather-shaft terminus [3-9]. Other studies have also successfully
obtained DNA from the blood clot located in the superior umbilicus of the feather shaft [10]. Rawlence et al.
[11] recently investigated the potential for DNA extraction from the feather barbs and rachis, and reported
that the distal portion of the feather (that is, the rachis
and barbs) retained mitochondrial (mt)DNA. However,
their DNA-extraction methods required the destruction
of the entire feather.
Consequently, most existing DNA-extraction protocols
are not suitable for dealing with damaged, modified or
antique/archaeological feathers that may be missing the
terminal portion of feather shaft. Additionally, extraction

methods that require the destruction of the entire
feather are not desirable when testing crafted items and
artifacts such as headdresses and fans, particularly those
that may be culturally valued or historically prized.
Both animal and human hairs, which are similar to
feather barbs in that they are composed of keratin [2],
have proven to be extremely good sources of mtDNA,
especially in ancient or forensic contexts [12-14]. Ancient
and forensic DNA techniques are designed to target low
quantities of degraded DNA in order to retrieve DNA
from degraded or minute evidentiary samples. Previous
forensic studies applied to human hairs have been successful at retrieving DNA from extremely small sample
sizes (that is, single hairs) [15,16]. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) determine the feasibility of
extracting and amplifying suitable quantities of mtDNA
from just a few feather barbs, rather than the whole
feather; and 2) to test the reliability and sensitivity of the
minimally destructive analytical technique.
DNA was initially extracted from four freshly collected
feathers from North American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and Canada goose (Branta canadensis), using two different DNA-extraction techniques to test the feasibility of
extracting and amplifying mtDNA. After a rigorous decontamination technique, mtDNA samples were first extracted
from two and five barbs per feather using a modified silicaspin extraction protocol designed for degraded DNA samples (modified silica-spin column (MSSC) protocol) [17].
Subsequently, the mtDNA was extracted using a commonly
available commercial DNA-extraction kit (see Methods).
The DNA extracts were amplified by PCR, targeting fragments 200 to 300 bp in length of the mitochondrial DNA
cytochrome b gene of various bird species (Table 1).
Once the initial protocol had been tested on fresh
feathers, the technique’s reliability and sensitivity was
tested using feathers of blue heron (Ardea herodias) and
pygmy owl (Glaucidium californicum) (Figure 1a) five to
10 years old a museum-curated specimen of ruffed
grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and an archaeological specimen of magpie (Pica pica) feather (Figure 1b).

Based on visual analysis of the electrophoresis gels, no
differences were seen in the amplification strengths of
the two-barb samples versus the five-barb samples for
the fresh, stored and museum samples using either the
MSSC extraction protocol (Figure 3) or the QDIK
extraction protocol (data not shown). Only for the
archaeological magpie feather did extracts from fivebarb samples yield stronger amplification and longer
fragments than extracts from two-barb samples.

In all cases in which clear sequences were recovered,
DNA sequences were either identical to or very similar
to the published GenBank reference sequences for all

PCR amplification

PCR was performed for all feather samples, comprising
two-barb and five-barb samples from the fresh, stored,
museum and archaeological specimens (Figure 2; Table 2).
Four feathers from wild turkey and Canada goose were
extracted using two different protocols, MSSC and the
Qiagen DNA Investigator Kit (QDIK) (see Methods).
There was no difference in the success rates PCR amplification for the two DNA-extraction methods; both the
MSSC protocol and the QDIK protocol yielded successful
amplifications for both the two-barb and five-barb wild
turkey and Canada goose feather samples.

the species identifications was supported by the match
between the known species identity and the obtained
sequences in 23 of the 24 samples (Table 2). Furthermore, all PCR reactions from the same feather yielded
identical sequences, supporting the authenticity of the
obtained sequences.

Figure 4 Multiple alignment of cytochrome b sequences from feathers of wild turkey, Canada goose and ruffed grouse. Dots indicate
base pairs that are identical to the reference sequence (Meleagris gallopavo EF153719). In all but one case, the obtained sequences were either
identical to or one base-pair different from the published reference sequences of the known species obtained from GenBank (accession
numbers listed). Sample FE18, the two-barb grouse sequence, displayed ambiguous bases, probably caused by low template and potential
contamination from chicken DNA.

differences in sequencing quality between the MSSC and
the QDIK extraction protocols.
Only one sample exhibited poor sequencing quality;
sample FE18, the two-barb sample of the museumcurated ruffed grouse, displayed mixed peaks in the
electropherogram, although good sequence quality was
seen in the five-barb sample from the same feather.
Upon further analysis, the mixed peaks visible in the
electropherogram of the FE18 suggested that template
problems (low quality and/or low quantity) and exogenous DNA from the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus)
might have resulted in the poor sequence quality (Figure
4). The small amount (only two feather barbs) and antiquity of the samples (over 50 years old) probably
resulted in a low quantity of authentic DNA template,
which may have been overwhelmed by exogenous DNA
during the amplification process.

Discussion
Reliability and sensitivity of feather-barb analysis

The amplification of mtDNA from all 24 feather samples, including fresh, stored, museum and archaeological
samples, clearly demonstrates the feasibility of recovering mtDNA from just a few feather barbs, rather than
the whole feather. The mtDNA amplification and
sequencing yielded confident species identification from

as little as two barbs, indicating that feathers represent
an excellent substrate for minimally destructive DNA
techniques. Moreover, the recovery of mtDNA using
two different extraction protocols indicates that feather
barbs are a reliable DNA substrate.
The generally clear sequencing results and reliable
species identifications obtained using both the two-barb
and five-barb samples indicate that even a few feather
barbs are suitable for mtDNA-based species identification analyses. However, the poor sequencing quality and
the presence of mixed peaks visible in the electropherogram of the museum-curated ruffed-grouse specimen
highlights the high potential for contamination of lowtemplate DNA samples by exogenous sources.
No chicken DNA had been processed in the Forensic
DNA Laboratory at Simon Fraser University (SFU), suggesting that sample cross-contamination was not the
source of any exogenous DNA in the two-barb grouse
sample. However, the sporadic presence of animal DNA
in laboratory reagents has been noted for several years,
especially for common domestic animals such as
chicken, cattle and pig [18]. Forensic DNA extraction
and amplification techniques are designed to target minute amounts of evidentiary DNA, and thus even very
low concentrations of contaminant animal DNA can
produce false-positive results [19]. Although the low

Speller et al. Investigative Genetics 2011, 2:16
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/2/1/16

quantities of animal DNA in laboratory reagents may
not be an issue for human DNA studies, they may pose
a challenge to wildlife forensic investigations. Therefore,
the results from this study highlight the need for both
carefully designed primers and for dedicated laboratory
workspaces when analyzing of low-template DNA.
Primers can be designed specifically to minimize the
potential for contamination from modern sources.
When working with trace wildlife forensic samples or
low-template extracts, taxon-specific primers are recommended to exclude contamination both from modern
human sources and from common exogenous animal
species.
The results of this study also highlight the need for a
thorough sample-decontamination process and the use
of a clean DNA-extraction laboratory when applying
these minimally destructive analytical techniques, particularly when working with feather samples several decades old. Moreover, when working with degraded or
ancient feathers, a larger sample may need to be
extracted (for example, five to six feather barbs) to
ensure adequate quantities of DNA template for
amplification.
Interestingly, no evidence of contamination (for example, mixed electropherogram peaks, amplification of
blank extracts, or negative controls) were seen in the
archaeological magpie feather samples processed in the
Ancient DNA Laboratory at SFU. This laboratory is
dedicated to the DNA analysis of archaeological samples
that are often several thousands of years old, and thus
practices extremely rigorous contamination prevention
controls, which seem to have been effective in eliminating any systematic laboratory contamination.
Applications and contributions

Minimally destructive DNA-extraction techniques are
extremely beneficial in forensic contexts, as evidentiary
feather samples may be left virtually intact for subsequent morphological studies. Additionally, the results of
this analysis indicate that DNA can be successfully
retrieved from feather barbs using a commonly available
commercial DNA-analysis kit, making this technique
easily implementable in most forensic laboratories.
Minimally destructive DNA techniques for feather
barbs have applications in a variety of national and
international forensic contexts. Such analyses will benefit wildlife law enforcement, which is responsible for
identifying the illegal possession of feathers (and other
bird products) from species protected under the MBTA,
ESA and CITES. This minimally destructive technique
will be valuable for identifying crafted trade products or
artifacts incorporating the feathers of protected birds.
Furthermore, this highly sensitive technique can be used
on small, damaged or degraded feathers in other

Page 5 of 7

forensic contexts, including the identification of species
involved in bird strikes (collision between birds and
transport vehicles, usually aircraft) or hazardous environmental incidents (for example, oil spills).
In addition to forensic contexts, minimally destructive
DNA techniques for bird feathers may benefit several
other fields, including conservation biology and archaeology. Such DNA-extraction techniques may be applied
to non-invasively collected bird feathers and/or museum
samples of threatened, extinct or extirpated bird populations, thus benefiting ornithologists and conservation
biologists. Likewise, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using a few feather barbs for identifying bird species used in archaeological contexts.

Conclusions
In this study, we have shown that bird feather barbs are
a good source of mtDNA. Furthermore, we found that,
using appropriate contamination controls, mtDNA can
be recovered and reliably analyzed from as few as two
feather barbs from both fresh and degraded feathers,
leaving the remainder of the feather intact. This study
highlights the suitability of feather barbs as a minimally
destructive source of DNA for forensic wildlife cases,
and for DNA analysis of rare museum and/or archaeological feather samples.
Methods
Feather samples

DNA was extracted from eight feather specimens of
known species with various degrees of degradation to
test the feasibility and sensitivity of the developed protocol. DNA extraction was first tested on four freshly
collected feathers from North American wild turkey
(M. gallopavo) and Canada goose (B. canadensis)
(Table 2). The fresh feather specimens used in this
study were shed feathers from morphologically identified wild birds, rather than from voucher specimens
[20]. Once the initial protocol had been tested, the
technique’s reliability and sensitivity was tested using
feathers of blue heron (A. herodias) and pygmy owl (G.
californicum) (both 5 to 10 years old), obtained from
the zooarchaeological reference collection of the
Department of Archaeology at SFU (Figure 1, left
image). Finally, DNA analysis was also applied to
much older feather samples in order to test the sensitivity of the technique and its suitability for degraded
feathers. The degraded samples were a museumcurated specimen, about 50 years old, of ruffed grouse
(B. umbellus), obtained from the Prince of Wales Heritage Centre in Yellowknife, NWT, and a magpie (P.
pica) feather, about 200 years old, recovered from
archaeological site EeRb-144, located near Kamloops,
BC (Figure 1, right image).

Sample preparation and DNA extraction of the fresh
and museum-curated feather samples were conducted in
the Forensic DNA Laboratory in the Centre for Forensic
Research at SFU. This laboratory follows comprehensive
controls recommended for the analysis of human and
non-human animal forensic remains [21,22], including:
positive pressure air flow, use of dedicated equipment
including clothing, equipment and reagents, and inclusion of multiple blank extracts and negative controls
through every stage of analysis. DNA extraction of the
archaeological feather followed the same protocols as
the fresh samples, but was conducted in the Ancient
DNA Laboratory at SFU, which is dedicated to the analysis of samples more than 100 years old. Similarly, this
laboratory follows strict contamination-control protocols
for the analysis of ancient remains [23,24].
For all eight feathers, two and five feather barbs were
removed from the feather shaft using sterile scissors or
a sterile scalpel blade (Figure 2), resulting in a total of
24 tested samples (Table 2). For all 24 samples, barbs
were first rinsed in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 30 seconds to remove possible surface contamination, then
rinsed twice in DNase/RNase-free distilled water (UltraPure™, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After decontamination, two different DNA-extraction techniques were
applied.

forensic and phylogenetic contexts when robust species
identification is required [20,26,27]. When designing the
primers, special consideration was given to the specificity of the targeted PCR products. Using BLAST
searches and multiple alignments of numerous reference
sequences downloaded from GenBank, the primers sets
were carefully designed to separate the bird species used
in this study.
PCR was conducted in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf,
Westbury, NY, USA) in 30 μl PCR reactions containing
50 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 2.5 mmol/l MgCl2,
0.2 mmol/l dNTP, 0.3 μmol/l primer, 1.5 mg/ml BSA, 3
μl of DNA sample and 0.75 U AmpliTaq Gold™
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was conducted with an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 12
minutes, followed by 35 to 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds and 55°C for 30 seconds, and a final extension step
at 72°C for 40 seconds. DNA samples (5 μl) were separated by electrophoresis and visualized through a dark
reader (Clare Chemical Research Co., USA). Successfully
amplified products were purified using a commercial kit
(MinElute™PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) or ExoSAPIT ® (USB Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA)). PCR
products were sequenced using both forward and
reverse primers either at the Macrogen Inc. sequencing
facility in (Seoul, Korea) or the Eurofins MWG Operon
sequencing facility (Huntsville, AL, USA).

DNA extraction

DNA sequencing and species identification

The samples first underwent an MSSC extraction protocol designed for degraded DNA samples [17]. As keratin
is the major structural component of feather barbs, we
modified the lysis buffer to include dithiothreitol (DTT).
Barbs were incubated in 1.5 to 3 ml of lysis buffer (0.05
mol/l EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K
and 10 mg/ml DTT) at 55°C for 1 to 2 hours. The
remainder of the DNA extraction followed our previously described protocol [23], producing a final elution
of 100 μl of DNA solution for each sample.
Subsequently, the feather-barb samples of wild turkey
and Canada goose were also extracted using a commercial kit (Qiagen’s DNA Investigator Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) (QDIK protocol), following the
manufacturer’s protocol designed for hair, producing a
final elution of 100 μl of DNA solution for each sample.

DNA sequences were visually edited, and base-pair
ambiguities were examined using ChromasPro software
http://www.technelysium.com.au and compared with
modern published references through the GenBank
BLAST application http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
. Multiple alignments of the obtained sequences and
published bird reference sequences were conducted
using ClustalW [28], through BioEdit http://www.mbio.
ncsu.edu/BioEdit. Species identifications were assigned
to a sample only if it was identical to or very similar to
the published reference sequences [29-32], and if no
other evidence, including reproducibility tests or additional sequencing of the same sample, indicated a different species.

Sample preparation

PCR amplification

Primers were designed to target fragments 200 to 300
bp in size of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene
of various bird species (Table 1). The cytochrome b
gene was specifically targeted because this locus displays
sufficient sequence diversity to distinguish species, yet
relatively low levels of intraspecies variation [25]. The
cytochrome b gene is commonly used in both wildlife
