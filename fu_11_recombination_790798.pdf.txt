Abstract
Bocavirus include bovine parvovirus, minute virus of canine, porcine bocavirus, gorilla bocavirus, and Human
bocaviruses 1-4 (HBoVs). Although recent reports showed that recombination happened in bocavirus, no
systematical study investigated the recombination of bocavirus. The present study performed the phylogenetic and
recombination analysis of bocavirus over the complete genomes available in GenBank. Results confirmed that
recombination existed among bocavirus, including the likely inter-genotype recombination between HBoV1 and
HBoV4, and intra-genotype recombination among HBoV2 variants. Moreover, it is the first report revealing the
recombination that occurred between minute viruses of canine.
Introduction
Members of the genus Bocavirus are non-enveloped single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) virus, which belong to the
Parvoviridae family. The bocavirus genome is not segmented and contains a single molecule of linear, positive- or negative-sense DNA of 4,000-6,000 nucleotides
in length [1]. Known members of bocavirus include
bovine parvovirus (BPV), minute virus of canine (MVC),
porcine bocavirus (PBoV), gorilla bocavirus (GBoV), and
Human bocaviruses 1-4 (HBoV1-4).
The MVC genome shares about 43% identity with
BPV over the genome level [2,3]. BPV was first identified in 1961 in samples from calves with diarrhea [4],
while MVC was first isolated from canine fecal samples
in 1970 [5]. HBoV was first described in pooled nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory
infections in 2005, and was provisionally categorized
into the genus bocavirus [1]. Subsequently, HBoV2,
HBoV3, and HBoV4 were discovered, sharing a mean
similarity of 80% with HBoV1, and all have been categorized into the genus bocavirus [6,7]. Recently, new
bocavirus species were isolated from gorilla and swine,
and most closely related to HBoV [8,9].

Although recently reports showed that recombination
happened in bocavirus [8], no study has systematically
investigated the recombination among bocavirus strains.
In the present study, therefore, we analyzed the available
complete bocavirus genome sequences in GenBank to
elucidate the recombination among bocavirus strains.

Methods
Sequences

The study sequences comprised all the 121 available
complete genome sequences of bocavirus from GenBank
dated September 2010. Sequences were firstly screened
to exclude patented and artificial mutants, and then
aligned in the ClustalW program [10]. The alignment
was manually adjusted for the correct reading frame.
Sequences showing less than 1% divergence from each
other were considered as the same. The remaining 54
BoV genomes included one GBoV, one BPV, two
PBoVs, three MVCs, and 47 HBoVs.
Phylogenetic analysis

Before phylogenetic analysis, multiple-alignment was
performed in the ClustalW program. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the neighbor-joining method
and evaluated using the interior branch test method
with Mega 4 software [11]. Percent bootstrap support
was indicated at each node. GenBank accession no. was
indicated at each branch.

Recombination Detection

The remaining 54 bocavirus genomes were re-aligned in
the ClustalW program. Detection of potential recombinant sequences, identification of potential parental
sequences, and localization of possible recombination
break points were determined using the Recombination
Detection Program (RDP)[12], GENECONV [13],
BOOTSCAN [14], MaxChi [15], CHIMAERA [16], and
SISCAN [17] methods embedded in RDP3 [18]. A Multiple-comparison-corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05 was
used throughout.

Results and Discussion
Based on the 54 complete genomes, a phylogenetic tree
was constructed (Figure 1). The genotypes of these
bocavirus showed in the phylogenetic tree were consistent with the genotype information from the original
sources. From the phylogenetic tree, we can see that
HBoV2 and HBoV4 closely related and formed into one
cluster; HBoV1 and HBoV3 clustered separately, and
GBoV showed more related to HBoV1 than to the other
HBoVs. Six potentially significant recombination events
were found with a high degree of confidence (p value ≤
4.4 × 10-3) judged by the above-mentioned six recombination detection methods.
Figure 2 indicated the inter-genotype recombination
events that occurred between HBoV1 and HBoV4,
which lead to the recombinant cluster HBoV2. The
BOOTSCAN plot of this recombination event was
showed in Figure 2A, which used the lineages represented by NC_012729 and EU984244 as the parental
strains, leading to the daughter lineage represented by
GU048665. To confirm this recombination event, the
relevant strains were analyzed by neighbor joining trees
using MEGA4. Figure 2B and 2C were two trees constructed on the non-recombinant region (position: 1-166
+ 2967-end) and the recombinant region (position:1672966), respectively. In Figure 2B, all HBoV2 strains clustered closely with HBoV3 and HBoV4, while Figure 2C
showed discordant phylogenetic relationships compared
with Figure 2B, where HBoV2 strains clustered with
HBoV1. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the recombination event that occurred between HBoV1 and
HBoV4, leading to the recombinant HBoV2.
Figure 3A-E indicated the other 5 recombinants identified in the present study. The BOOTSCAN plot of
each recombination event was showed on the left side,
while phylogenetic tree based on recombination regions
and non-recombination regions of parental strains in
each recombination event were indicated on the right
side. Figure 3A showed the recombinant occurred
between two MVC strains, FJ899734[19] and AB158475
[20], leading to the recombinant NC_004442[3]. These
recombination events provide the first evidence that

recombination could happened among MVC strains.
Figure 3B showed a recombination event happened
intra-genotypely between two HBoV2 strains, FJ948860
and GU048662, leading to the recombinant FJ973558,

isolated from Australia in 2001 [7] and Thailand in 2007
according to the isolate information in GenBank, respectively, while FJ973558 was isolated from Tunisia in 2006
[8]. Figure 3C and 3D revealed two Bangpoo recombinants, GU048662 and GU048663, respectively. However,
according to the isolate information in GenBank,
GU048662, GU048663, and one of their parental isolates
were isolated in the same lab in Thailand, therefore, it
should be cared whether these recombination events
non-naturally occurred by sequencing error and/or contamination in the lab. Figure 3E revealed recombination
between the lineage represented by Nigeria HBoV2 isolate FJ973560 and Pakistan HBoV2 isolate lineage
NC_012042, which led to a recombinant Pakistan isolate
FJ170279. However, these three isolates were determined in the same lab [6,8], therefore, whether this
recombination event non-naturally occurred by sequencing error and/or contamination should be confirmed
by further study.
For RNA viruses, recombination has been shown to
be an important feature of their evolution [21-23], and
single-stranded DNA parvoviruses have been shown to
have a mutation rate approaching that of RNA viruses
[24]. The HBoV sequences were previously considered
to show very low protein and nucleotide sequence
diversity [25]. Recently, however, other 3 different
genotypes (HBoV2-4) were discovered, which reveals
that the HBoVs own the property of high sequence
diversity. The present study provide the evidence that
recombination was observed through complete bocavirus genome analyses, including the likely inter-genotype recombination between HBoV1 and HBoV4, and
intra-genotype recombination between HBoV2 variants. As a matter of fact, a recent study indicated
HBoVs coinfection was detected [8], which will
increase the chance of recombination between baocavirus strains.

Conclusion
Taken together, this study confirmed that recombination
existed among bocavirus, including the likely inter-genotype recombination between HBoV1 and HBoV4, and
intra-genotype recombination among HBoV2 variants. It
is the first report revealing the recombination that
occurred between minute virus strains of canine.
