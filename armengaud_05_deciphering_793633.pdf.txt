Abstract
Background: The cluster of orthologous group COG2042 has members in all sequenced
Eukaryota as well as in many Archaea. The cellular function of these proteins of ancient origin
remains unknown. PSI-BLAST analysis does not indicate a possible link with even remotely-related
proteins that have been functionally or structurally characterized. As a prototype among COG2042
orthologs, SSO0551 protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was
purified to homogeneity for biophysical characterization.
Results: The untagged protein is thermostable and behaves as a monomeric protein in gel filtration
experiment. Several mass spectrometry-based strategies were combined to obtain a set of low
resolution structural information. Kinetic data from limited proteolysis with various endoproteases
are concordant in pointing out that region Glu73-Arg78 is hyper-sensitive, and thus accessible and
flexible. Lysine labeling with NHS-biotin and cross-linking with DTSSP revealed that the 35 amino
acid RLI motif at the N terminus is solvent exposed. Cross-links between Lys10-Lys14 and Lys23Lys25 indicate that these residues are spatially close and in adequate conformation to be crosslinked. These experimental data have been used to rank multiple three-dimensional models
generated by a de novo procedure.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that COG2042 proteins may share a novel fold. Combining
biophysical, mass-spectrometry data and molecular model is a useful strategy to obtain structural
information and to help in prioritizing targets in structural genomics programs.

Background
Genomic comparative studies on entirely sequenced
genomes from the three domains of life, i.e. Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukaryota [1], evidenced that proteins
involved in the organization or processing of genetic
information (structures of ribosome and chromatin,
translation, transcription, replication and DNA repair)

display a closer relationship between Archaea and Eukaryota than between Bacteria and Eukaryota [2-4]. To identify
new proteins involved in such important cellular mechanisms, an exhaustive inventory of proteins of unknown
function common to only Eukaryota and Archaea but not
in Bacteria has been devised [5-7]. Among such proteins,
the Cluster of Orthologous Group COG2042 comprises

proteins ubiquitously present in Eukaryota and present in
many, but not all, Archaea; a hallmark of their ancient origin. The corresponding ancestral protein should have
been present in the common ancestor of these two
domains of life. Some partial experimental data are
known from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae COG2042
homolog. Deletion of the Yor006c gene was shown to
result in a viable phenotype but some apparent moderate
growth defects were noticed on a fermentable carbon
source [8,9]. Two putative protein partners for Yor006c
were identified through a high-throughput two-hybrid
study [10]: Ydl017w, a serine/threonine kinase also
known as the cell division control protein 7 (Cdc7), and
Yil025c, a hypothetical ORF. However, the cellular function of COG2042 proteins remains unknown.
A polar region, named RLI, is conserved at the N terminus
of COG2042 proteins as well as at the N terminus of
another cluster of orthologous proteins, namely
COG1245. The latter, exemplified by SSO0287 in Sulfolobus solfataricus [11], are large proteins (about 600 residues) that encompass four different domains: a RLI
domain, a [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin domain, and two ATPase
domains, usually found in ABC transporter. Their putative
function is currently subjected to discussion [12,13] but
could be related to rRNA metabolism. Indeed, four of the
eleven proteins shown to interact with the yeast
COG1245 homolog (Ydr091c) were identified as
involved in rRNA metabolism (Ymr047c, Ydl213c,
Ylr340w, Ylr192c). Experimental data on the human
homolog of Ydr091c indicated that this protein reversibly
associates with RnaseL, and thus COG1245 proteins were
named RNase L inhibitor [14].

threading models in spite of a relatively low sequence similarity (13 % of identical residues). Interestingly, the constant development of novel cross-linking reagents suitable
for mass spectrometry [22] enables enrichment of crosslinked peptides facilitating such strategy. A chemical modification approach [23-26], in combination with limited
proteolysis procedures [27,28], can also provide useful
structural constraints [29] for model refinement.
A step further is to attempt such approaches with proteins
having no detectable homologs. In order to get insight
into the topology of COG2042 members and if possible
to use these experimental data to discriminate among
structural protein templates, we combined limited proteolysis, lysine labeling and cross-linking strategies. The
protein SSO0551 from the hyperthermophilic archaea
Sulfolobus solfataricus was chosen as a prototype because of
its thermostability and the probable absence of posttranslational modifications when produced as a recombinant form in Escherichia coli. The SSO0551 protein is
monomeric with a low molecular mass (19 kDa). This size
is easily amenable to characterization by mass spectrometry. Our results reveal that the polar RLI motif at the N terminus is probably structured and solvent exposed,
pointing at a common trait between COG2042 and
COG1245 proteins, this latter group being also conserved
in Eukaryota and Archaea but absent in Bacteria. The
accessible and flexible regions defined by limited proteolysis combined with lysine accessibility assessed by NHSbiotin labeling and DTSSP cross-linking allowed us to discriminate among ten top ranking de novo three-dimensional (3D) models.

Results
Because knowledge of protein structure is of high importance to understand protein function, huge efforts have
been recently invested in high-throughput protein structure determination programs [15]. Recent reports indicate
that only a relatively small percentage of expressed and
purified proteins are amenable to full 3D structure by
NMR or crystallography and X-ray diffraction [16,17]. In
silico modeling (homology modeling, fold recognition, ab
initio and de novo modeling) is the alternative to quickly
gain the fold of a protein. However, such approach sometimes remains ambiguous in reliably identifying correct
structures for protein sequences remotely-related to those
found in PDB database. A promising strategy is the use of
experimental data (if possible easily obtained) for model
discrimination or refinement [18-20]. For example, the
tertiary structure of the bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 was probed with a lysine-specific cross-linking
agent and subjected to tryptic peptide mapping by mass
spectrometry to identify the sites of cross-linking [21]. The
low resolution interatomic distance information obtained
experimentally allowed the authors to distinguish among

COG2042 comprises members exclusively from Eukaryota
and Archaea
The sequence of SSO0551 from S. solfataricus was used as
query in a PSI-BLAST database search to identify homologous proteins. A constant cutoff expectation value of 10-15
resulted after three iterations in selection of 40 sequences
(15 from Archaea and 25 from Eukaryota) that were all
aligned over their full length. No close homologs (E-value
below 10-10 in the third iteration) with full-length
sequence matching to SSO0551 were found among Bacteria. Remarkably, all completely sequenced Eukaryal
organisms were found to have one SSO0551 homolog.
Fig. 1 shows an unrooted phylogram of the updated
COG2042 family (Fig. 1A) and an alignment of a selection of six representative sequences (Fig. 1B), selected on
the basis of their phylogenetic distribution. When experimental evidences concerning the protein are unfortunately lacking for ORF description genome annotators
usually take into consideration the most upstream initiation codon. For this reason, the most probable start
codons of several open reading frames should be

aThe two products were isolated from SDS-PAGE and treated with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry in
reflectron mode. The expected length for the two products are: 180 amino acids for SSO0551 with the 6His-tag at the N terminus (pSBTN-AB31
construct) and 222 amino acids for SSO0551 extended version (42 additional amino acids at the N terminus and a 6His-tag; pSBTN-AB30
construct).

reconsidered after exhaustive alignment (Fig. 1). For
example, atg codon starting at nucleotide 484790 on the
Crick strand for SSO0551 from S. solfataricus
(NC_002754) should be a more appropriate start codon
than atg starting at nucleotide 484916 and mentioned
erroneously in current database. From the unrooted phylogram (Fig. 1A), two main lineages (archaeal and eukaryal) can be defined based on organism origin. This
suggests that occurrence of these proteins is at least as
ancient as divergence of these two phyla. No paralogs,
sign of a possible evolution of a new derived function,
have been evidenced in entirely sequenced organisms currently available. Although these proteins are of ancient
origin, the core sequence appears well conserved as
observed in Fig. 1B. Thirty-three residues (38%) are found
identical in the core central segment (out of 88 amino
acids) between the most distant COG2042 orthologs,
namely gi48852409 from Ferroplasma acidarmanus and
gi6324579 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1B). From
the alignment, several conserved motifs that may be functionally crucial (cofactor or substrate binding, catalysis, or
partner interactions) were detected. A conserved hexapeptide
sequence,
Val-Val/Ile/Leu-Asp/Glu-Cys-Ser-Trp
(motif I in Fig. 1B), is found distant of 14–17 amino acids
from another conserved motif of 25 amino acids containing 4 polar, 18 hydrophobic and 3 aromatic residues
(motif II). Database searches with these motifs as queries
did not allow identification of remotely-related proteins.

All sequences from COG2042 encompass a stretch of 35
conserved amino acids upstream of the core common
sequence. This motif, called RLI, is extremely polar (11
basic and 4 acidic residues) and is also found at the N terminus of another group of orthologous sequences,
namely COG1245.
Expression in E. coli of two engineered SSO0551 constructs
From multiple sequence alignments, SSO0551 should
encode a 166 amino acid polypeptide. An N-terminal
6His tagged recombinant construct (pSBTN-AB31) was
engineered. As we could not exclude that the 42 amino
acids extension at the N terminus was not an annotation
artifact, we intended to check experimentally whether this
putative extension could have some influence on
SSO0551. A second construct (pSBTN-AB30) was simultaneously engineered supposedly allowing production of a
26 kDa N-terminal 6His variant. Unexpectedly, no major
difference in expression was detected between the two cellular extracts when they were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Two
overexpressed products with both an apparent molecular
weight of approximately 20 kDa were obtained upon
addition of IPTG (data not shown). Fingerprint identification of these two products was carried out by trypsin proteolysis and mass spectrometry. Table 1 shows the
MALDI-TOF mass measurements recorded for the two
samples. The tryptic peptides that were detected revealed
that both products correspond to native SSO0551

COG2042 sequences comparison
COG2042 sequences comparison. A – Phylogenetic analysis of archaeal and eukaryal COG2042 sequences. Archaeal and
eukaryal homologs were obtained from public databases [54] by PSI-BLAST searches. To get the most conserved alignment
between COG2042 polypeptide sequences, most probable start codons should be considered as atg at nucleotide 500978 on
Crick strand for MTH554 from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus str. DeltaH (NC_000916), gtg at nucleotide 1526308
on Watson strand for Vng2075c from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NC_002607), atg at nucleotide 8398 on Watson strand for
Mbur141901 from Methanococcoides burtonii DSM6242 (NZ_AADH01000008) and atg at nucleotide 484790 on Crick strand
for SSO0551 from S. solfataricus (NC_002754). Asterisks indicate modified protein sequences according to this new proposed
annotation. Multiple alignments were performed by ClustalW. Following removal of a few ambiguously aligned regions, a data
set was assembled comprising 40 sequences over 162 amino acid positions. An unrooted evolutionary distance tree was constructed based on Kimura distances and neighbor joining tree reconstruction algorithm. Bootstrap confidence levels at nodes
were computed by the Phylips package with 400 replicates. Scale bar represents unit of amino acid substitutions per position.

sequence. From the 6His-SSO0551 product (pSBTN-AB31
construct), thirteen peptides map with the theoretical
sequence (57 % sequence coverage). Noteworthy, a peptide (1590.64 amu) was attributed to part of the 6Hismodified N terminus (Table 1). The twelve peptides
recorded from the 6His-SSO0551 extended version
(pSBTN-AB30 construct) fit only to the C terminus of the
theoretical construct (43 % sequence coverage). These
results along with low molecular weight observation on
SDS-PAGE indicate that probably a truncated protein was
obtained during expression of the ORF comprising the
126 nt 5'-extension (42 additional amino acids at the Nterminus). This product, corresponding in fact to
untagged SSO0551 as confirmed hereafter with purified
product, showed no binding on Ni-NTA chromatography.
This observation is in agreement with absence of 6His tag
at the N terminus.
Recombinant SSO0551 is structured, thermostable and
monomeric
Crude extract containing native untagged SSO0551
polypeptide from E. coli Rosetta(DE3)(pLysS)(pSBTNAB30) cells was heated at different temperatures. Proteins
that remained soluble were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Most
of E. coli contaminants were removed by such treatment.
SSO0551 polypeptide remained soluble even when cell
extract was heated to 80°C and therefore this protein was
considered as thermostable. This protein was purified to
homogeneity by a three-step purification protocol. A 20
min heat treatment at 70°C (Fig. 2A, lane 3), followed by
a Resource-S ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2A, lane
4) and a Superdex75 gel filtration (Fig. 2A, lane 5),
yielded approximately 1.6 mg of pure protein per L of culture. Purified protein was subjected to MALDI-TOF mass
analysis. Fig. 2B shows the spectrum recorded. The experimental m/z of 19,198 measured for the monocharged
polypeptide matches perfectly with theoretical average
mass of native untagged SSO0551 protein (average mass
of 19,197 Da). This measurement unequivocally confirmed that a truncated protein is produced using E. coli
Rosetta(DE3)pLysS transformed with pSBTN-AB30. Both
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 5) and MALDI-TOF spectrum
(Fig. 2B) testify for homogeneity of the sample.

Content of secondary structure elements in SSO0551 was
estimated by far-UV circular dichroïsm. Fig. 3 shows the
spectrum recorded at 20°C. Purified protein presents negative ellipticity in the near-UV with minima at 208 (-14.7
103 deg cm2 dmol-1) and 222 nm (-12.7 103 deg cm2 dmol1). Deconvolution of the CD spectrum leads to an estimation of secondary structural element content of about 28–
29 % of α-helices and 14–16 % of β-sheets using K2D
neural-software. Predictions of SSO0551 secondary structures by PSIPRED and Jpred web servers gave values of
10–11 % of β-sheets in relative agreement with the circu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/3

lar dichroïsm data, but overestimated the α-helix average
content (54 %). PSIPRED and Jpred predictions are based
on neural networks trained on known folds. The overestimation of the α-helix content may be due to the novel
fold of these COG2042 proteins as discussed here below.
Native molecular mass of SSO0551 was determined by
size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR10/
30 calibrated column. Pure protein eluted as a peak centered at 39.1 mL in the assay conditions corresponding to
an apparent molecular mass lower than 20 kDa. This elution profile indicates that this structured protein behaves
as a compact monomer.
Limited proteolysis defines Glu73-Arg78 as a hyper-sensitive
region
Purified SSO0551 protein was subjected to limited proteolysis with various endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, ArgC and GluC). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
was used to determine cleavage sites by following the time
course generation of peptides. Several protease/substrate
ratios were assessed to confirm which preferential sites on
entire protein were first attacked (earliest cleavage), thus
corresponding to a native state of the protein. The two
fragments generated by such cleavage may be more vulnerable to subsequent attacks than native protein and
therefore late proteolytic sites are considered less informative. Both small and large peptides generated during proteolysis were evaluated. Partial proteolyzed products
obtained with trypsin were first resolved by reverse-phase
chromatography and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. Results recorded from direct analysis of the
digestions without prior separation were almost similar to
those obtained with separation. Therefore, the latter costeffective strategy was used for analyzing the numerous
conditions tested. Figure 4 shows the MALDI mass spectrum of the main large products obtained from a tryptic
digest of SSO0551 (enzyme/protein ratio of 1:20) after 60
sec of reaction. In these conditions, the signal of intact
protein was still visible at m/z 19198.4, but mixed with
signals corresponding to 8 different large fragments.
Among these, 7 peptides arose from an N-terminal proteolysis: [32–166], [35–166], [56–166], [57–166], [76–
166], [79–166], [101–166] (Fig. 4). Such peptidic profile
indicates that SSO0551 N terminus is rather solvent
exposed in comparison to C terminus.

During the earliest events of the trypsin proteolysis analyzed in various conditions for detection of large products
but also smaller peptides, monocharged cations with following m/z: 8614.6 amu, 10603.4 amu, 6489.8 amu, and
12724.1 amu, were attributed to fragments [1–75]
(∆mass: -178 ppm), [76–166] (+89 ppm), [1–56] (+145
ppm), [57–166] (+200 ppm), respectively (data not

are two sites of early cleavage by trypsin. Identification of
peptides Val32-Lys166 (15478.7 amu, -53 ppm) and Gly35Lys166 (15191.2 amu, +153 ppm) also indicates that Arg31
and Lys34 could be two other initial nick-sites.
Similar experiments with endoproteinase Arg-C resulted
in observation of two pairs of complementary peptides
with m/z of 1920.9 amu ([1-15] +70 ppm) and 17296.8
amu ([16–166], -95 ppm) on one hand, 8998.1 amu ([1–
78], -176 ppm) and 10217.5 amu ([79–166], +332 ppm)
on the other hand. These data indicated that Arg78 and
Arg15 are the main proteolyzed sites when ArgC enzyme
was used. Chymotrypsin attacks SSO0551 native protein
mainly at Phe74 because two complementary peptides

with m/z of 8487.0 amu ([1–74], -249 ppm) and 10734.2
amu ([75–166], -157 ppm) were clearly evidenced. Glu73
is the main proteolyzed site when GluC protease was
used, as peptides with m/z of 8338.7 amu ([1–73], -118
ppm) and 10880.0 amu ([74–166], +28 ppm) were
detected. For all these analysis, smaller peptidic fragments
that accumulated over time could be attributed from further proteolysis of the products arising from initial attacks
(data not shown). All these results are concordant in
pointing out that Glu73-Arg78 and Glu28-Arg31 are two
accessible solvent-exposed regions of the protein as they
can be proteolyzed by several endopeptidases, the first
cited being definitively hyper-sensitive. Local unfolding
not just surface exposure is necessary for efficient in vitro

proteolysis because the polypeptide segment being
cleaved must form a specific structure with the associated
protease [30]. For this reason, Glu73-Arg78 region should
also correspond to a flexible region, i.e. a protruding loop.
Lysine labeling with NHS-biotin and DTSSP cross-linking
confirm that the N terminus is rather solvent-exposed
The SSO0551 protein contains 21 lysine residues (12 %)
distributed along the whole polypeptide sequence. Under
mild conditions that should keep the native conformation
of the protein, specific labeling of these residues with
NHS-biotin may give further details about their respective
surface accessibility and/or their interactions with other
residues [31]. After reaction with various amount of
chemical reagent (molar ratio NHS-Biotin/total lysines of
1:40, 1:20, 1:10, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1), protein labeling was monitored by determining the mass of undigested samples.
Figure 5 shows the signals measured by MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry for four of these ratios. The fact that some
unmodified protein is still present at ratio below 1:20 testifies for mild conditions that should allow modification
of protein still in a native state. As expected with NHSbiotin, each peak exhibits the predictable mass increment

(average mass of 226.3 amu per label). Figure 5 shows
that at molar ratio of 1:40 a simple modification is
obtained, while a more heterogeneous population was
detected for higher ratio. For examples, 1 to 3
modifications are detected at ratio 1:20, 2 to 5 modifications at ratio 1:2. However, a limited number of modifications (8–10) are recorded for higher ratio, indicating that
among the 21 lysine residues only a fraction is accessible
to the chemical.
To localize all labeled residues, NHS-biotin treated samples were subsequently subjected to proteolysis with various endoproteases (trypsin, Arg-C, or Glu-C) and
compared to untreated samples. SSO0551 sequence coverage was estimated to be 92 % with all 21 lysine residues
included in this coverage. Peptides (∆mass below 120
ppm) detected with NHS-biotin treated samples but not
detected with untreated samples are listed in Table 2.
Using limiting amount of NHS-biotin (molar ratios of
1:10, 1:20 or 1:40), nine reactive residues are unequivocally identified: Lys10, Lys14, Lys20, Lys23, Lys25, Lys51,
Lys75, Lys128, and Lys154, assuming that proteases do not
cleave after a modified residue. Other residues, such as

MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of large peptide fragments produced by SSO0551 partial trypsin proteolysis
MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of large peptide fragments produced by SSO0551 partial trypsin proteolysis. A
partial enzymatic proteolysis was carried out during 60 sec at 20°C with a trypsin/SSO0551 protein ratio of 1/20 (w/w). The
products were then resolved onto a C8 reverse phase chromatographic column and the different UV absorbing fractions were
analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The m/z spectrum obtained with the fraction eluting at 40–50 % acetonitrile is shown. The asterisk
labels a peak arising from trypsin autolysis. Peaks that could be assigned are identified with numbers (experimental m/z, residues, ∆mass in ppm compared to theoretical [M+H]+ average mass): M1 (19198.4, [1–166], -1), M2 (15478.7, [32–166], -53),
M3 (15191.2, [35–166], +153), M4 (12883.4, [52–162] or [56–166], -46 or -43), M5 (12724.2, [57–166], +193), M6 (10603.8,

C2, complementary of M5 and M6, were not observed in this spectrum but in another fraction from the C8 reverse-phase
chromatography corresponding to smaller peptides.

Figure 5
MALDI-TOF mass spectra of proteins labeled with NHS-biotin
MALDI-TOF mass spectra of proteins labeled with NHS-biotin. Protein samples were mixed with various amount of
NHS-biotin for 15 min at room temperature. Unlabeled protein mass spectrum is shown in grey solid line. Reagent/total lysine
ratios were in Fig. 5A: 1:40 (black dotted line) and 1:20 (black dashed line), and in Fig. 5B: 1:2 (black solid line) and 2:1 (grey
dotted line). The number of labeled lysines is indicated above each peak.

Lys34 and Lys49 might be also labeled (Table 2). The
number of labeled lysines is in agreement with the limited
number of modifications recorded at higher ratio.
Remarkably, spectra of whole peptide mixture were
informative enough to give assignment of all modified
peptides without the need of a purification step.
Therefore, other amine reactive reagent that creates a mass
shift could have been used.
Using a lysine cross-linking reagent, DTSSP, it is possible
to assess intra- or inter-molecular protein contacts
[21,32]. DTSSP enables cross-linking of amino groups up
to 12 Å apart. As SSO0551 was shown to be monomeric
and its concentration used in the assays was low (2.5 pM),
intramolecular cross-links should be favored over intermolecular cross-links. In addition, the low reagent concentration used should avoid unwanted conformational
changes that may be induced by multiple intramolecular
cross-linking. After reaction with DTSSP, products were
subjected to trypsin proteolysis and peptides were identified by MALDI-TOF. As the protein is relatively small,
mass signals could be attributed with a good confidence
(tolerance < 120 ppm). In addition, peak attribution was
always confirmed upon reduction of products and sometimes through redundancy due to miss-cleavage.

SSO0551 sequence coverage was 89%. The monoisotopic
cations at m/z 1169.55, 2077.04, 2715.11 and 2871.14,
detected for SSO0551 treated by DTSSP (ratio DTSSP/
total polypeptide of 20:1) correspond in mass to addition
of a DTSSP moiety on peptides [24-31] (∆mass tolerance:
+16 ppm), [123–138] (-7 ppm), [57–78] (+61 ppm) and
[56–78] (+82 ppm). Since trypsin does not cleave after a
modified lysine, we conclude that Lys25, Lys75 and Lys128
were modified. After DTT treatment, peaks corresponding
to the expected products (-103.993 amu theoretically)
were detected at m/z 1065.46 (-109 ppm), 1973.03 (0
ppm), 2611.21 (-28 ppm) and 2767.26 (-45 ppm),
respectively. Fig. 6 shows two monoisotopic [MH]+ ions at
m/z 1491.76 and 1835.84 corresponding to intrapeptide
cross-linked peptides: [21-31] (+31 ppm) and [3-15] (+3
ppm), respectively. These peptides contain two proximal
lysine residues (Lys23-Lys25 and Lys10-Lys14). As shown in
Fig. 6, these two peaks were absent in mass spectrum following DTT reduction but new peaks at m/z 1493.69 and
1837.81 appears at the expected increment (+2.016 amu
theoretically). An additional peak at m/z 2502.22 could be
attributed to peptide [35–55] (+37 ppm) with an
intrapeptide cross-link between Lys49 and Lys51. However,
the corresponding reduced peak was not detected. Strikingly, every lysines that were reactive with DTSSP were

also detected by NHS-biotin labeling. Most modifications
are located at the N terminus of the protein where five
modified residues belong to the RLI motif.

Discussion
Although COG2042 proteins are distributed among a
large number of organisms, no experimental evidences
have yet been reported concerning their biochemical characterization and function. As they are not related, even
remotely, to any other family of proteins, COG2042
members can be phylogenetically considered as orphans.
Figure 7 (Panel A) summarizes the structural information
obtained with chemical modification approach, in combination with limited proteolysis procedures. Using
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify protease-accessible sites, we have shown that the most exposed regions

are located at the first half of the protein, the Glu73-Arg78
region being revealed hyper-sensitive to various proteases
(Fig. 7A). It probably indicates a protruding loop out of
the globular protein. This charged region is relatively conserved among COG2042 orthologs and lies between two
highly conserved segments of COG2042 (motif I and II as
shown on Fig. 7). Chemical modification agrees with limited proteolysis in that the RLI motif is solvent exposed
while the C terminus appeared rather inaccessible (Fig.
7A). The length of the RLI motif, first defined by conserved domain search [33], matches perfectly with two
sensitive proteolytic sites (Arg31 and Lys34). The RLI
domain is also present at the N terminus of another group
of orthologous proteins, namely COG1245. Remarkably,
COG1245 proteins only occur in two domains of life
(Archaea and Eukarya) similarly to COG2042 proteins.

Molecular structure of DTSSP

Figure 6
DTSSP cross-linked peptides identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
DTSSP cross-linked peptides identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Protein samples were mixed with
DTSSP for 30 min at room temperature at a molar ratio 1:20 (protein:DTSSP). They were then subjected to trypsin proteolysis. Masses of peptides treated with DTT (grey spectrum) or untreated (black spectrum) were measured by MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. Peptide sequences are indicated and DTSSP cross-links or DTSSP moieties arising from DTT treatment are
depicted schematically. Monoisotopic masses of protonated peptides [MH+] are theoretically: 1491.807 amu and 1493.822 amu
for LVKLKIAEFTR [21-31] cross-linked with one DTSSP molecule (untreated (C68H115N16O17S2) and DTT-reduced
(C68H117N16O17S2), respectively), 1835.846 amu and 1837.862 amu for VYIIDYHKDDPKR [3-15] cross-linked with one DTSSP
molecule (untreated (C82H123N20O24S2) and DTT-reduced (C82H125N20O24S2), respectively).

Although co-occurrence of protein members is not strictly
identical (for example, pyrococci encompass the information for COG1245 but not for COG2042 polypeptides),
such occurrence pattern may reflect a functional link
between the two protein families.
Our initial objective was to obtain about SSO0551 as
much low-resolution structural information as possible in
order to discriminate among putative three-dimensional
models representing COG2042 protein structure. However, currently available threading tools applied on
SSO0551 failed to detect any structurally related-proteins.
Alternatively, we obtained ten different ab initio models of
SSO0551 using the fully-automated ROBETTA server
based on ROSETTA procedures [34]. On these ten models,
we applied all the low-resolution structural information

gathered in this work. We predicted for every model
location of preferential proteolytic sites using the NickPred software [35]. Models M1, M2 and M6 on one hand,
and M9 and M10 on the other, show hypersensitive
regions in the RLI motif or C terminus, respectively. These
features do not correspond to our experimental data. Only
models M4, M7 and M8 predict that the loop Glu73-Arg78
is solvent exposed (data not shown). Among these three
models, M4 and M8 respect the ranking of preferential
nick-sites for trypsin, chymotrypsin, ArgC and GluC proteases. Solvent accessibility for lysine side chain was evaluated for models M4, M7 and M8 and compared with
experimental data (data not shown). All the lysine residues labeled with NHS-biotin are found solvent-exposed
in model M8. Manual inspection of cross-linked lysines
(Lys10-Lys14 and Lys23-Lys25) revealed that model M4 is

Experimental topology information obtained on SSO0551 and theoretical 3D model M8 shown to be compatible. A – Schematic representation of experimental low-resolution structural information. SSO0551 sequence is displayed with
its predicted secondary structural elements (α-helices and β-strands are represented by helices and arrows, respectively). The
two conserved COG2042 motifs described in this study (I and II) and the 35 amino acids RLI motif are specified. Vertical
arrows indicate sites of limited proteolysis that have been experimentally determined. Lysines labeled with NHS-biotin are
indicated with asterisks and lysines involved in DTSSP cross-links are schematically bridged. Sequence numbering refers to the
native version (untagged) of SSO0551 experimentally characterized. B – Schematic drawing of ab initio model M8. Secondary
structure elements are shown as coil for α-helices, arrows for β-strands, and lines for loops. The color code follows a rainbow
style where N terminus is in blue and C terminus in red. C – Molecular surface of ab initio model M8. The localization of solvent-exposed lysines, as determined by NHS-biotin labeling experiments, is colored in red whereas other lysines are colored in

not valid because of the opposite orientation of Lys10 and
Lys14. Figure 7 (Panels B & C) shows cartoon views of the
M8 model that fulfills all our experimental constraints.
For this model, the distance between the two reactive
amine groups of Lys10-Lys14 and Lys23-Lys25 pairs are 12.7
Å and 13.3 Å, respectively. Search with DALI for structural
homologs using model M8 did not result in significant

scores with any known PDB structures. This is consistent
with the PSI-BLAST results and may indicate that
COG2042 proteins share a novel fold. COG2042 proteins
are thus a target of choice for genomic structural studies.
In conclusion, we have presented a strategy consisting in
obtaining low-resolution structural information (deter-

mination of nick-sites, solvent exposed residues, and residue-residue distances) that can be used to distinguish
among a large set of theoretical molecular models. Lack of
remotely-related structural templates or lack of adequacy
between experimental data and most theoretical models
indicates that such family of proteins should become a
priority in structural genomic projects.

Methods
Chemical and biological reagents
Most chemicals used in this study were obtained from
Sigma and were of analytical grade. Oligonucleotide
primers were purchased from Genset. N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (NHS-biotin) and 3,3'-dithio-bis [sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate] (DTSSP) were obtained from
Pierce. Matrices for Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
and calibration standards were purchased from Bruker
Daltonics. Sequencing grade proteolytic enzymes were
from Roche Applied Science.
Cloning and overexpression of SSO0551
Two constructs were designed in order to get overexpression of the SSO0551 ORF (starting with an ATG codon at
nucleotide 484790 on the Crick strand of S. solfataricus P2
genome (NC_002754)) and an N-terminal extended
version of SSO0551 (starting with an ATG codon at nucleotide 484916). For both proteins, an N-terminal 6His tag
was added to render the purification of the recombinant
products easier. For this purpose, synthetic oligonucleotide
primers
were
oAB22
(5'-gctagcATGAAGCCCAAACCC-3')
and
oAB49
(5'gctagcATGAAGGTATATATTATAGAC-3') that both contain an engineered NheI site, oAC34 (5'-cggatcctacTCATTTTTCAAGTATTTTC-3')
and
oAE62
(5'ggatcctcaTCATTTTTCA AGTATTTTCTC-3') that both contain an engineered BamHI site (restriction sites underlined
in the primer sequences and nucleotides not present in
the original sequence shown by lower case). Oligonucleotide pairs oAB22/oAC34 and oAB49/oAC34 were used
for two distinct PCR amplifications of SSO0551 with S.
sulfolobus total DNA as template. A 643-bp fragment (Nter 6His-tag extended version of SSO0551) and a 517-bp
fragment (N-ter 6His-tag SSO0551) were obtained,
respectively. They were cloned into pCRScript-cam (Stratagene), resulting in plasmids pSBTN-AB36 and pSBTNAB37, respectively. The two inserts were removed by
digestion with NheI and BamHI and ligated with T4 DNA
ligase into plasmid pSBTN-AB23 (Armengaud J. & Chaumont V., unpublished data), a derivative of pCR T7/NTtopo (Invitrogen) containing a T7 promoter and 6 His-tag,
previously digested with the same endonucleases. The
resulting plasmids pSBTN-AB30 and pSBTN-AB31,
respectively, were verified by DNA sequencing in order to
ascertain the integrity of the nucleotide sequence. Hyper-

expression of the recombinant SSO0551 constructs was
achieved with E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen), freshly transformed with the plasmids described
above. Cultures were carried out at 30°C as described earlier [6].
Purification of recombinant SSO0551 protein
The purification of recombinant SSO0551 was performed
from 44 g (wet material) packed cells. Buffer A consisted
of 50 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2) containing
400 mM K-glutamate. The pellet was thawed on ice and
resuspended in 120 mL of buffer A. The cells were disrupted by sonication with a total energy delivered of 71 kJ.
The cell-extract was then centrifuged at 30,000 g for 20
min at 4°C to remove cellular debris and aggregated proteins. The supernatant was subjected to a 20 min heat
treatment using a water bath maintained at 70°C, and
immediately centrifuged a second time at 30,000 g for 20
min at 4°C. Chromatographic steps were performed at
room temperature using an Äkta Purifier FPLC system
(Amersham Biosciences). The 135 mL supernatant was
applied at a flow rate of 2.8 mL/min onto a XK 26 × 20
column (Amersham Biosciences) containing 50 mL of
Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences)
and previously loaded with 200 mM NiSO4, washed with
milliQ water and equilibrated with Buffer A containing 50
mM imidazole. The fraction collected during the IMAC
loading was shown to contain the SSO0551 protein. This
222 mL fraction was concentrated to a volume of 56 mL
by means of Centricon Plus-20 filtration units (Millipore)
and then dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 20 mM
K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20 mM
NaCl (buffer B). The 78 mL supernatant obtained after
centrifugation at 30,000 g for 10 min at 4°C was divided
and applied in two separate runs onto a 6 mLResource-S
ion-exchange column (30 mm × 16 mm, 15 µm) from
Amersham Biosciences, previously equilibrated with
buffer B and operated at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. After a
10 column volume wash with buffer B, proteins were
resolved with a 25 column volume linear gradient from
20 to 500 mM NaCl in buffer B. Recombinant SSO0551
was eluted at approximately 250 mM NaCl and desalted
by overnight dialysis against Buffer B. The resulting 20 mL
protein solution was concentrated to a volume of 8 mL by
means of Centricon Plus-20 filtration units (Millipore).
The sample was again divided and applied in two separate
runs onto a superdex75 gel filtration packed into a HR 16/
50 column at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min in 20 mM
K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mM
NaCl. The fractions obtained with the two runs were
pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 10 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.2). After dialysis, the fraction was
centrifuged at 26,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the protein
concentration was measured by spectrophotometry using
a molar absorption coefficient of 19060 M-1 cm-1 at 280

nm. The purified protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C at a concentration of 0.48 mg/
mL.
Circular dichroïsm
Far- and near-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded
at 20°C between 200 and 300 nm on a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-424S Jasco Peltier,
using a quartz cuvette of 1 mm path length, with a 20 nm/
min scanning speed and a band-width of 1 nm. Three
spectra of purified SSO0551 at 1.92 µM in 10 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.2) were averaged and corrected from the
baseline for buffer solvent contribution. Experimental
data were analyzed using the program K2D [36] described
by Andrade et al. [37].
Determination of native molecular mass by gel filtration
The native molecular mass of SSO0551 was estimated by
gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel
packed into a HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences)
with a final bed volume of 24 mL. The column was
equilibrated at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/
min with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 50
mM NaCl and eluted with the same buffer. Protein
standards used to calibrate the column were ribonuclease
A (15.8 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (21.2 kDa),
ovalbumin (49.4 kDa), albumin (69.8 kDa), aldolase
(191 kDa) and catalase (215 kDa), all from Amersham
Biosciences. Exclusion limit was evaluated with dextran
blue 2000 (Amersham Biosciences). A sample consisting
of 90 µL of SSO0551 at 25.2 µM was injected and specific
absorptions at 280 and 266 nm were followed.
Mass spectrometry
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-OfFlight (MALDI-TOF) mass measurements were performed
using a Biflex IV instrument (Bruker Daltonics) in positive
ionization mode. Protein samples and large peptidic fragments (>3500 Da) were applied to the target using
sinapinic acid prepared as saturated solution in 30 % acetonitrile, 70 % milli-Q water and 0.1 % TFA as matrix.
Samples were prepared using the dried droplet method
and measured in linear mode. Small peptide samples were
measured in reflectron mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as matrix. Mass spectra were obtained by
summation of 100–210 laser shots. The instrument was
calibrated for determination of entire protein masses
using either a mixture of chymotrypsin and bovine serum
albumine, or apomyoglobin and aldolase. For peptides,
the instrument was calibrated using a pepmix calibration
kit (Bruker Daltonics). When necessary, the mass spectrometer was also internally calibrated using some of the
theoretical peptide masses.

Limited protease digestion
For in-solution partial digestion, 0.2 nmol of pure
SSO0551 were diluted into buffer D1 (20 mM TRIS/HCl,
pH 7.8), buffer D2 (20 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8) or buffer
D3 (20 mM TRIS/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 mM CaCl2
and 5 mM DTT). Trypsin or chymotrypsin was added to
SSO0551 diluted into buffer D1, whereas Glu-C or Arg-C
was added to the protein diluted into buffer D2 or D3,
respectively. Several enzyme/protein ratios (1:50 (w/w),
1:20 (w/w) and 1:2 (w/w)) were tested for each endoprotease. The digestions were performed at room temperature
and aliquots were analyzed from 30 sec to 10–240 min.
Digested samples were desalted using ZipTipC18 or
ZipTipC4 pipette tips (Millipore) according to the protocol
specified by the manufacturer and their mass directly evaluated by MALDI-TOF. Eventually, partially proteolyzed
mixtures of larger quantities (10 nmol of SSO0551) were
fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC using an Aquapore
RP-300 column (PerkinElmer; 100 × 1.0 mm, 7 µm, 300
Å pore size) developed at 200 µL/min with a linear gradient from 5 to 90 % of acetonitrile in TFA 0.1 % over 45
min. The elution was monitored at 220 nm with an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a G1315
diode array detector. Individual fractions were
concentrated by evaporation in a SpeedVac (Savant) and
directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF.
Lysine labeling by NHS-biotin
N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (NHS-biotin) was used to
label ε-amino groups of SSO0551 lysines. After reaction
the biotin labels resulted coupled to the lysines through a
stable amide bond. The increase in mass for each label
(C10H14N2O2S1) should be 226.293 amu if average mass
is considered or 226.078 amu in monoisotopic mode.
Modification of lysine residues was carried out by incubating 1.25 nmol of SSO0551 in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, with
various amount of freshly prepared NHS-biotin reagent
dissolved in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide. After 30 min
of incubation at room temperature, the reagent in excess
was removed by a 30 min micro-dialysis against 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.2. Samples were directly desalted by using
ZipTipC4 (Millipore) prior MALDI-TOF analysis. They
were eventually digested overnight with an endoprotease
(trypsin, GluC or ArgC) and desalted by using ZipTipC18
pipette tips (Millipore) prior mass analysis.
Lysine cross-linking with DTSSP
3,3'-Dithio-bis [sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate] (DTSSP)
was used to cross-link two ε-amino groups of SSO0551
lysines, essentially as described in [32]. The mass increase
(in monoisotopic mode) for each label should be
191.991 amu (C6H8O3S2) or 87.998 amu (C3H4O1S1)
when DTT treated. The increase in mass for an intramolecular cross-link between two lysines should be 173.981
amu (C6H6O2S2) or 175.997 amu (2 × C3H4O1S1) when

DTT treated. Therefore after reduction of the disulfide
bridge by DTT, an additional increase of 2.016 amu
should be measured. Reaction was carried out by incubating 0.25 nmol of SSO0551 in 20 mM NaH2PO4/
Na2HPO4, pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, with various
amount of DTSSP reagent (molar ratio of 20, 35, and 50
mol of DTSSP per mol of polypeptide). After 30 min of
incubation at room temperature, the reagent in excess was
removed by a 30 min micro-dialysis against 20 mM
NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl.
Prior overnight trypsin proteolysis, urea (330 mM final
concentration) was added to each sample. Before being
desalted by using ZipTipC18 pipette tips (Millipore), the
digested peptide mixture was eventually reduced with 50
mM DTT for 30 minutes at 37°C to reduce the thiol
linker.
In silico analysis
Sequence searching was performed using PSI-BLAST with
default parameters. Multiple sequence alignments were
performed using VectorNTI software package (Informax
Inc). Secondary structure predictions were obtained
through the PSIPRED v2.4 web-interfaced facilities [38]
described by McGuffin et al. [39]. The molar absorption
coefficient at 280 nm for SSO0551 was obtained from calculation of the amino acid composition of the recombinant protein [40,41]. Isotopic and average mass of both
DTSSP cross-linker and NHS-biotin were calculated using
a web-interfaced molecular weight calculator [42]. The
peptide assignment and the first attempt for identifying
the labeled products and cross-linking products were performed using the FindMod package at ExPaSy [43]. If no
match was found, a more detailed search for multiple
labels or combinatorial cross-linkable peptide pairs was
carried out. Partially proteolyzed products were assigned
using the FindPept tool [44]. Tertiary structure predictions
were carried out using publicly available online services,
including 3D-PSSM [45], FUGUE [46] and PSIPRED [39].
Ab initio modeling was performed using the ROBETTA
server [34,47]. Each model was analyzed in terms of proteolytic sensitivity using the NICKPRED software
[35,48,49]. Residues accessibility have been calculated
using a modified version of Connolly's MS program ([50];
Pellequer JL, unpublished results). Structural homologs
were searched using DALI web server from the European
Bioinformatics Institute [51]. Model views were obtained
with the MOLSCRIPT program [52] and rendered using
RASTER3D [53].
