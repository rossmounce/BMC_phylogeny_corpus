Abstract
Mycoplasma haemofelis is a pathogenic feline hemoplasma. Despite its importance, little is known about its
metabolic pathways or mechanism of pathogenicity due to it being uncultivatable. The recently sequenced
M. haemofelis str. Langford 1 genome was analysed and compared to those of other available hemoplasma
genomes.
Analysis showed that in hemoplasmas genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism are limited to enzymes of the
glycolytic pathway, with glucose appearing to be the sole energy source. The majority of the pentose phosphate
pathway enzymes that catalyze the de novo synthesis of ribonucleotides were absent, as were cell division protein
FtsZ and chaperonins GroEL/ES. Uncharacterized protein paralogs containing putative surface expression motifs,
comprised 62% of M. haemofelis and 19% of Mycoplasma suis genome coverage respectively, the majority of which
were present in a small number of unstructured islands. Limited mass spectrometry and immunoblot data
matched a number of characterized proteins and uncharacterized paralogs, confirming their expression and
immunogenicity in vivo.
These data have allowed further characterization of these important pathogens, including their limited metabolic
capabilities, which may contribute to their uncultivatable status. A number of immunogenic proteins, and a
potential mechanism for host immune system evasion, have been identified.
Introduction
The hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) are a group
of bacteria that can induce hemolytic anemia in a wide
variety of mammals [1]. The feline hemoplasma, Mycoplasma haemofelis, and the porcine hemoplasma, Mycoplasma suis were reclassified as members of the genus
Mycoplasma within the Mollicutes class following 16S
ribosomal RNA gene phylogenetic analysis [1]. Recently
the whole genome sequence of M. haemofelis str. Langford
1 was published [2]. This low-passage strain has been
shown to induce hemolytic anemia in immunocompetent
specific pathogen free (SPF)-derived cats [3,4]. Subsequently the annotated genome sequences of two strains of
M. suis and a further strain of M. haemofelis have also
been published [5,6].
To date the hemoplasmas have been uncultivatable in
vitro, meaning that sourcing large quantities of purified

hemoplasma DNA has been difficult. When hemoplasma
shotgun libraries have been screened and compared
against mass spectrometry data the lack of whole genome
sequence data available for hemoplasmas, and the extensive host protein contamination present in preparations,
have limited identification of hemoplasma proteins [7,8].
The aim of this study was to fully describe the genome of M. haemofelis str. Langford 1, and to compare it
with available hemoplasma genomes.

Materials and methods
Sources of M. haemofelis DNA and protein

Preparations of M. haemofelis str. Langford 1 had been
previously purified from blood taken from an experimentally infected SPF-derived cat at a time of high parasitemia [9]. DNA and proteins were purified as previously
described [7].

Whole shotgun pyrosequencing, genome closure and
annotation was performed as described elsewhere [2].

The genome was submitted to the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL) nucleotide sequence database (accession number FR773153).
Genome sequence data for comparisons

The genome sequences of M. suis str. KI_3806
(FQ790233), M. suis str. Illinois (CP002525), and M. haemofelis Ohio2 (CP002828) were obtained from GenBank.
Artemis v12 was used to organize data and facilitate
annotation [10]. Orthologs and paralogs were defined
using OrthoMCL [11]. Repeat identification was made
using MUMmer [12]. Homology was defined as E ≤ 10-5.
Identification of M. haemofelis str. Langford 1 proteins

Mycoplasma haemofelis str. Langford 1 proteins were prepared for two-dimensional (2D) sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using the
2D-clean up kit (GE Healthcare, Amersham Place, Little
Chalfont, UK). Proteins were separated according to their
isoelectric points on Immobiline™ DryStrip pH 3-11 NL
(GE Healthcare) and then according to mass (Criterion
XT 4-12% Bis-Tris Precast Gels; Bio-Rad Laboratories Pty.
Ltd., Gladesville, NSW Australia) alongside a molecular
weight marker (Unstained Precision Plus Protein™ Standards, Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK).
Gels were stained using Sypro® Ruby Protein Gel Stain
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Selected protein spots were
picked for trypsin-digestion and the resulting peptides
analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS; QSTAR Elite Q-TOF; AB Sciex
Australia Pty. Ltd., Mt Waverley, Victoria, Australia). In
addition, data derived from an earlier study using matrix
assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MSMS) of immunoreactive protein spots
were available [7]. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) to
search a database of in silico predicted M. haemofelis proteins, using the following parameters: error tolerance of
0.2 Da for precursor and product ion masses; 1 missed
tryptic cleavage; allowing oxidation of methionine and
propionamide modification of cysteine as optional modifications. Confident matches were defined by the Mascot
score and statistical significance (p < 0.05).

Results
The general features of the M. haemofelis str. Langford 1
genome are shown in Figure 1, and these features are
compared to other available hemoplasma genomes (M.
haemofelis str. Ohio2, M. suis str. Illinois &M. suis str.
KI_3806) in Table 1. Both hemoplasmas contained single
copies of the 16S, 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
genes, which were located in a single rRNA operon in M.
haemofelis but not M. suis. A single copy of the ribonuclease P b-subunit ribosomal gene was located in each

Page 2 of 8

hemoplasma upstream of, and on the complementary
strand to, the ATP dependent protease La gene (lon).
Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes corresponding to each of the
amino acids were present in both species, including
one assigned to the UGA (opal) codon, consistent with a
tryptophan insertion at this position (M. haemofelis str.
Langford 1 codon usage data: Additional file 1 Table S1).
Both M. suis strains contained a lysine tRNA complementary to the AAG codon which was absent in M. haemofelis,
whilst lysine tRNA complementary to the AAA codon was
present in both species. From transitions in GC skew, and
gene distribution we inferred that the M. haemofelis origin
of replication is upstream of dnaA (HF1_00010) as was
also seen for M. suis. Using the mycoplasma genetic code
Table 1 545 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were
identified in the M. haemofelis str. Langford 1 with a
mean length of 743 nucleotides, of which 328 (21.2% total
ORFs) were homologs of proteins from non-hemoplasma
bacterial species.
Of the pentose phosphate pathway enzymes required for
de novo ribonucleotide synthesis, only the gene encoding
ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase (prs) was present in
the hemoplasmas; genes encoding transketolase, ribose-5phosphate isomerase and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase
were not identified. Alternative purine synthesis pathway
homologs inosine-5 monophosphate dehydrogenase
(GuaB) and guanosine 3, 5 monophosphate synthetase
(GuaA) were however found in both M. haemofelis and
M. suis, whilst homologs for pyrimidine synthesis enzymes
cytidylate kinase (cmk) and adenosine kinase (HF1_14770)
were only found in M. haemofelis.
The phosphotransferase system of Mollicutes appears to
be present in hemoplasmas, including genes encoding glucose-specific components (ptsG &crr) and the regulatory
protein kinase (hprK). Phosphocarrier protein HPr (ptsH)
of both species contain the His-15 site of enzyme I phosphorylation and the Ser-46 site for HprK phosphorylation.
Genes encoding enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
glycolytic pathway catalyzing the conversion of glucose
into pyruvate/lactate (Additional file 2 Figure S1) were
present in both species whilst genes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were absent, as were genes encoding
enzymes of the citric acid cycle. Genes encoding the highly
conserved FOF1-ATP synthase complex (atpABCDEFGH)
were present to complete the energy pathway, and maintain the transmembrane proton gradient in both species.
Transporters and pathways for the utilization of other
energy sources appear to be partial or absent: the glycerol
kinase gene (glpK) is present whilst the glycerol facilitator
gene (glpF) is not. Genes required for fructose and mannitol
uptake and metabolism (e.g. 1-phosphofructokinase; mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase) were not identified.
Minimal lipid transport and metabolism enzymes were
identified. Those that were identified in all three

genomes included cardiolipin synthase (cls) and choline
kinase (licA), whilst phosphatidylglycerophosphate
synthase (pgsA) was truncated in M. suis str. KI_3806.
Genome data also suggests that hemoplasmas have
minimal amino acid synthesis capabilities, and that they
are unable to de novo synthesize folate. In contrast, the
highly conserved genes encoding the polyamine (spermidine/putrescine) ABC transporter complex (potABCDE)
were identified in both species, as were coding sequences

necessary for the synthesis of all aminoacyl-tRNAs,
except glutaminyl-tRNA. In the absence of glutaminyltRNA synthetase, genes encoding the aspartyl-tRNA/glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase (gatAB) to convert glutamyl-tRNA into glutaminyl-tRNA were identified in both
species.
The ABC phosphate transport system permease genes
(pstAC &B) and other ABC transporter components
were also identified including a ferrichrome ABC

transporter complex. Predicted proteins with homology
to cation transporter proteins including those for cobalt
(cbiO1O2Q), magnesium (mgtE), potassium (trkAB) and
sodium/calcium were also found.
A gene encoding a DHH family phosphoesterase homologous to mgpA was present in both hemoplasma species;
however no genes encoding other terminal organelle proteins of the pneumoniae group of mycoplasmas were identified. Homologs to M. suis proteins HspA1, MSG1 and
enolase were predicted in M. haemofelis as chaperone protein DnaK, NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase and enolase respectively. Genes encoding
the components of the chaperonin complex GroEL/ES
were not identified in either hemoplasma species, nor was
cell-division protein FtsZ.
No predicted M. haemofelis ORFs had significant
matches to proteins known to specifically mediate colonisation, motility, chemotaxis, natural competence, antibiotic
resistance or toxicity in other bacteria, including the P97like protein of M. suis which has a region homologous to
Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae adhesin P97. In addition to
cytidylate kinase and adenosine kinase, the M. haemofelis
genome also contained genes encoding Mn/Fe- superoxide
dismutase (sodA), and tRNA modification GTPase
(mnmEg), which were absent from both M. suis strains.
Of the 1 228 (79.5% of total ORFs) uncharacterized
hypothetical proteins, 1115 (72.2% of total ORFs), covering 61.9% of the M. haemofelis str. Langford 1 genome,
were highly repeated protein paralogs (Additional file 3
Table S2) mostly contained within three large islands

(Figure 1: pink/purple bars). These protein paralogs
could be seen as clusters of spots in the in silico
predicted proteome of M. haemofelis str. Langford 1
(Figure 2a) and M. haemofelis str. Ohio2 (data not
shown). Similar protein paralogs were detected in both
M. suis str. KI_3806 (Figure 2b) and M. suis str. Illinois
(data not shown) and in silico predicted proteomes,
which contained 550 and 523 uncharacterized hypothetical proteins (including 240 and 229 paralogs; representing 18.9% and 18.5% genome coverage) respectively.
Sequence comparisons suggested that they may have
arisen by gene duplication events. The predicted motifs
of the majority of these putative proteins were consistent with them being expressed on the cell surface; an
N-terminal signal peptide or transmembrane region followed by a non-cytoplasmic tail of approximately 200
amino acids. These paralogs were arranged islands
flanked by homologs of prolipoproteins, ATP-dependent
DNA helicase UvrD/PcrA, C-5 cytosine-specific DNA
methylase or genes of the type I restriction-modification
system (see Additional file 4 Figure S2 for example of
protein paralog “island”). Differences in gene number
and genome size between the different strains of hemoplasma species were almost entirely accounted for by
differences in the number of genes encoding uncharacterized proteins, mostly those belonging to paralog
groups. All characterized genes present in M. haemofelis
str. Langford 1 were present in M. haemofelis str. Ohio
2, and visa versa. Only one characterized gene, type II
restriction enzyme DpnII, was present in M. suis str.

forward matches are colored red and reverse matches colored blue. Dots present on either side of the diagonal line represent repeated proteins.

Illinois but not M. suis str. KI_3806. Whole genome
comparison between strains of M. haemofelis identified
a 17.4 kb inversion event in a region of the genome
containing genes encoding uncharacterized paralogs and
other uncharacterized proteins. No large inversion
events were detected between strains of M. suis.
Nineteen proteins were identified by comparing MS
data of selected proteins to in silico predicted ORFs
(Additional file 5 Table S3). Of these, seven were
matched to characterized proteins, two to conserved
hypothetical proteins and the remainder to uncharacterized hypothetical proteins. Of the hypothetical protein
matches the strongest (Mascot score of 249; where > 14
was significant) was to hypothetical protein CBY92783,
itself located within a string of repeated proteins, contiguous with its sole paralog (CBY92784). Six of the
remaining hypothetical protein matches were to members of different protein paralog groups, one of which
was known to correspond to an immunogenic protein
spot.

Discussion
The recent publication of the first whole hemoplasma genome sequences [2,5,6] represents a significant step forward
in the study of these pathogens. Noticeable differences
between the two hemoplasma species include the genome
size, 1.15 Mbp for M. haemofelis c.f. 0.71-0.74 Mbp for
M. suis, and G+C content, 38.8-38.9% for M. haemofelis c.
f. 31.1% for M. suis. The differences in genome length can

mostly be accounted for by variation in the numbers of
the hypothetical proteins, 1 228-1 251 in M. haemofelis c.f.
523-550 in M. suis, whilst variation at the third codon
position of almost 16%, accounts for the majority of the
G +C% difference.
Mycoplasma haemofelis was also found to have a very
low percentage of intergenic regions with ORFs covering
94.9-94.3% of the genome, and ribosomal genes a further
0.9%. In contrast, the mean coding density of M. suis
strains were 87.3-89.1%, whilst pneumoniae group mycoplasmas, to which the hemoplasmas are most closely
related based on ribosomal gene phylogeny [13], have
mean genome coding densities ranging from 88.3% for
Mycoplasma gallisepticum (AE015450) to 91.0% for Mycoplasma genitalium (L43967).
Mollicutes have previously been reported as bacteria
having genomes comprising some of the highest proportions of protein paralogs [14]; for example 22.7% of the
genome of plant pathogen “Candidatus Phytoplasma
asteris” strain OY-M [15] and 15.3% of the genome of porcine respiratory pathogen M. hyopneumoniae [16] encode
protein paralogs. In comparison, M. haemofelis has a dramatically high number of hypothetical protein paralogs
representing 61.9-62.7% genome coverage, whilst M. suis
had only 18.5-18.9% genome coverage by hypothetical
protein paralogs. Like in M. suis [6] the paralogs of M.
haemofelis were present mostly within a small number of
islands or regions within the genome which did not contain housekeeping genes.

Hemoplasmas experience different environments during the infection cycle: surviving in host tissues and during presumed arthropod vector transmission [17,18]. The
small number of sigma factors and transcription regulators identified would suggest a minimal ability to cope
with survival outside of the mammalian host, which
could be consistent with arthropods only providing a
mechanical vector of transmission. The apparent reliance
on glucose as the sole carbohydrate energy source would
also be consistent with the hemoplasmas being highly
adapted to the fairly constant epierythrocytic environment. All cultivatable mycoplasmas for which genome
sequence data is available have an intact pentose phosphate pathway for the de novo synthesis of ribonucletoides, whilst the uncultivatable phytoplasmas do not and
rely on host cells as a source of ribonucleotides. The
absence of an intact pentose phosphate pathway could
contribute to the uncultivatable status of the hemoplasmas. However, the presence of genes in M. haemofelis,
and to a lesser extent in M. suis, encoding enzymes that
could form alternative synthesis pathways indicate that
ribonucleotide metabolism in hemoplasmas requires
further investigation, and may not be the same for both
species.
The transporter proteins identified indicate that, in addition to glucose, hemoplasmas have the potential to source
amino acids, glucose, phosphates and cations from their
environment. Mechanisms for the uptake of bases or
nucleotides were not identified; however these could be
present in the ABC transporters for which substrates were
not indentified or in the hypothetical proteins. This finding is similar to other Mollicutes, which are also presumed
to source nucleotides from their environment.
Homologs of sodA, rnr and mgpA genes had previously
been identified during preliminary screening of the M.
haemofelis genome as potential virulence factors [19].
Superoxide dismutase activity could represent an important antioxidant defense of M. haemofelis to the high oxygen tension in the epierythrocytic environment through
catalysis of dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and
hydrogen peroxide [20], although its absence from M. suis
makes this less likely. Genes encoding putative SodA have
been reported in phytoplasmas but not other mycoplasmas, in which it is assumed that thioredoxin reductase,
which is also present in both hemoplasmas, fulfils the role
of superoxide scavenger. Alternatively M. haemofelis SodA
could act as a virulence factor generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which damages erythrocytes. Production of
reactive-oxygen species, such as H2O2 by virulent strains
of Mycoides mycoides subsp. mycoides has been suggested
as a mechanism for direct toxic effect on host cells [21].
Ribonuclease R has been identified as a pathogenic determinant of both Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli, and
is required for the expression of a virulent phenotype [22].

Page 6 of 8

However, it has not been reported as a virulence factor
in other mycoplasmas and may simply be present in
M. haemofelis and M. suis for its role in messenger RNA
degradation, or it may be inactive due to the N-terminal
truncation. In the absence of genes encoding the terminal
organelle machinery, it is unlikely that mgpA will play a
role in virulence of hemoplasmas. The absence of these
genes also fits with the electron-microscopy studies of M.
haemofelis and M. suis that have not shown evidence of
the presence of this “tip"-like structure [23-25]. Also conspicuous in their absence are the highly conserved genes
encoding GroEL/ES, FtsZ and the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, which are also absent in some ureaplasmas and
are variably present in other Mollicutes. The significance
of their absence is uncertain. The genome of M. haemofelis was however shown to contain homologs of all three
of the porcine hemoplasma M. suis immunodominant
proteins: enolase, MSG1 (GapA) and HspA1 (DnaK)
[8,26,27], of which MSG1 is thought to play a role in erythrocyte adhesion.
Cyclical parasitemia has been reported as a feature of
M. haemofelis infection [4], whilst chronic infection is a
common feature of hemoplasma infections in general [17].
We suspect that the extensive use of genome space in the
metabolically restricted genomes of both hemoplasma species to encode putatively surface expressed paralogs plays
a significant role in host immune system evasion, in a
similar mechanism to that used by the blood-borne Rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma marginale following gene
recombination between major super protein genes and
their paralogs, which results in antigenic variation [28].
Previous work on the immunoproteome of M. haemofelis has indicated that a number of proteins of a variety of
molecular weights can stimulate an immune response in
the cat [7,9]. Of particular interest is the 25-29 kDa region,
which contains a number of immunogenic proteins identified as distinct spots on a 2D immunoblot [7], and as a
variable band on one dimensional - polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis [9]. Unfortunately the majority of immunogenic spots in this region did not correspond to visible
spots on gels. Further work using the more sensitive LCMSMS on defined “mass and pI regions” of the gel may be
useful in indentifying these proteins, with recombinant
expression of selected proteins required to further characterize their role in the immune response. Other options
include using narrow range gels with increased loading, a
depletion procedure to remove abundant proteins [29], or
an immunoaffinity enrichment step [30]. Despite these
limitations, in addition to the previously reported phosphoglycerate kinase, chaperone protein DnaK and elongation factor-Ts [7], five novel immunogenic proteins of
M. haemofelis were identified including one of the uncharacterized protein paralogs. This, and LC-MSMS data
matches to other uncharacterized protein paralogs,

Barker et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:83
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/83

indicate that not only are hypothetical proteins from these
gene duplication events expressed, but that they may also
play a role in the host immune response, along with
M. haemofelis proteins of predicted metabolic function.
In common with other Mollicutes, the genomes of
M. haemofelis and M. suis lack many genes related to
amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and the citric acid
cycle. In the absence of genes encoding pathways for the
uptake and utilization of glycerol and fructose, glucose
appears to be the sole carbohydrate energy source. It is
likely that this has resulted from colonization of the
epierythrocytic environment that is rich in glucose, leading to such alternative energy source pathways being rendered redundant. A number of immunogenic proteins
have been identified; including metabolic enzymes suspected of having multiple activities within the bacterium,
and members of highly repeated families of uncharacterized hypothetical proteins suspected of playing a role in
host immune system evasion. Focused MS analysis of
purified hemoplasma proteins may allow further characterization of these pathogens.
