Abstract
Background: The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in human and animal
development as well as in carcinogenesis. Hh molecules have been found in both protostomes and
deuterostomes, but curiously the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lacks a bona-fide Hh. Instead a
series of Hh-related proteins are found, which share the Hint/Hog domain with Hh, but have
distinct N-termini.
Results: We performed extensive genome searches such as the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis
and several nematodes to gain further insights into Hh evolution. We found six genes in N. vectensis
with a relationship to Hh: two Hh genes, one gene with a Hh N-terminal domain fused to a
Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA), and three genes containing Hint/Hog domains with
distinct novel N-termini. In the nematode Brugia malayi we find the same types of hh-related genes
as in C. elegans. In the more distantly related Enoplea nematodes Xiphinema and Trichinella spiralis
we find a bona-fide Hh. In addition, T. spiralis also has a quahog gene like C. elegans, and there are
several additional hh-related genes, some of which have secreted N-terminal domains of only 15 to
25 residues. Examination of other Hh pathway components revealed that T. spiralis - like C. elegans
- lacks some of these components. Extending our search to all eukaryotes, we recovered genes
containing a Hog domain similar to Hh from many different groups of protists. In addition, we
identified a novel Hint gene family present in many eukaryote groups that encodes a VWA domain
fused to a distinct Hint domain we call Vint. Further members of a poorly characterized Hint family
were also retrieved from bacteria.
Conclusion: In Cnidaria and nematodes the evolution of hh genes occurred in parallel to the
evolution of other genes that contain a Hog domain but have different N-termini. The fact that Hog
genes comprising a secreted N-terminus and a Hog domain are found in many protists indicates
that this gene family must have arisen in very early eukaryotic evolution, and gave rise eventually
to hh and hh-related genes in animals. The results indicate a hitherto unsuspected ability of Hog
domain encoding genes to evolve new N-termini. In one instance in Cnidaria, the Hh N-terminal
signaling domain is associated with a VWA domain and lacks a Hog domain, suggesting a modular
mode of evolution also for the N-terminal domain. The Hog domain proteins, the inteins and
VWA-Vint proteins are three families of Hint domain proteins that evolved in parallel in
eukaryotes.

Background
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been shown to
be of fundamental importance for patterning and cell proliferation in animal development (for review see [1-4]).
Mutations in this pathway cause congenital defects and
several types of cancer such as basal cell carcinoma and
medulloblastoma [5-8]. A key molecule of the pathway is
Hh, a secreted ligand that can act as morphogen. Drosophila melanogaster has a single hedgehog (hh) gene, while
mammalian genomes contain three paralogous genes,
Sonic Hh (Shh), Desert Hh (Dhh), and Indian Hh (Ihh)
[9]. In zebrafish, five hh genes are present due to an extra
round of genome duplication during evolution of rayfinned fish [10,11]. The Hh protein is synthesized as a precursor composed of two domains, the N-terminal signaling domain and the C-terminal autoprocessing domain. A
substantial part of the autoprocessing domain shares
sequence similarity with self-splicing inteins and therefore this domain has been named Hint [12]. C-terminal to
the Hint domain is a sterol recognition region (SRR). A
crucial function of the autoprocessing domain is to add a
cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal signaling domain,
which is required for the proper function of the N-terminal ligand [13-16]. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
no bona-fide hh is present, i.e. there is no gene that
encodes both the N-terminal signalling domain as well as
the C-terminal Hint domain. Instead ten genes encoding
the C-terminal autoprocessing domain are found that,
however, have N-terminal regions very distinct from Hh.
Furthermore, a large number of additional genes are
found that encode only these new N-terminal domains
and lack the C-terminal autoprocessing domain. Overall,
these genes can be grouped into four families that have
been named quahog (qua), warthog (wrt), groundhog (grd)
and ground-like (grl) and are collectively referred to as hhrelated genes [17-19]. At present it is not clear, whether
the C-terminal domains of the C. elegans Hh-related proteins can add a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminus analogous to Hh, since there are sequence differences in the
SRR equivalent region. Therefore, this region of the Hhrelated proteins was named ARR (adduct recognition
region) [20]; here we refer to the combined Hint/SRR or
Hint/ARR region as Hog domain for simplicity, as others
have done as well [21].
The N-terminal domains of the C. elegans hh-related genes
were not found in vertebrates and flies using blast
searches, giving rise to the notion that these genes were
perhaps derived from hh in early nematode evolution
[17,18]. Recently, a Hog domain containing protein,
Hoglet, was discovered in the choanoflagellate Monosiga
ovata, but its N-terminal region is distinct from Hh and
other Hh-related proteins, instead sharing sequence similarity with cellulose-binding domains (CBD) [22]. Choanoflagellates are unicellular protists most closely related

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/127

to multicellular animals [23,24] and therefore Hoglet
might represent an ancestral precursor form of Hh. A Hh
protein was also described from the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis [25,26], indicating that Hh already existed
before the rise of bilaterian animals. An EST with
sequence similarity to Hh was also recovered from the
sponge Oscarella carmela [27], indicating that the
"Hedge" domain originated before the advent of Eumetazoa. In order to understand the origin and evolution of
the C. elegans hh-related genes, we had already performed
cursory searches of the genome of the parasitic nematode
Brugia malayi and found that it also contains several hhrelated genes [18,17]. Here we performed comprehensive
searches of the genomes of the cnidarian N. vectensis [28],
the nematodes B. malayi and Trichinella spiralis as well as
the NCBI protein, DNA and EST databases to find additional hh and hh-related genes that may shed light on the
evolution of these genes. In these searches we found a previously described gene from the fungus Glomus mosseae
that shares sequence similarity with Hh through the Hog
domain [29], but has not been considered in recent evolutionary analyses [22]. Furthermore, we found a number
of additional genes with similarity to the Hog domain in
Alveolata, moss, red algae, and other protists, indicating
that the origin of the Hog domain occurred already in
lower eukaryotes. As stated above, the Hog domain shares
sequence similarity to self-splicing inteins, which have
been found in Archaea, Bacteria, as well as fungi, algae
and a few protists [30-32]. Recently, two other types of
Hint related domains have been described, primarily from
bacteria, that have been named bacterial intein-like proteins (BIL) type A and B [21,33]. Several conserved
sequence motifs within the Hint domain have been
described for inteins that have been named motif A, B, E
and F [34-37]. Our searches revealed also ORFs in Tetrahymena, fungi and several other protist branches that have
similarity to the Hint domain via motifs A and B, but cannot be classified as inteins, Hog, or BIL domains.

Results
Retrieval and analysis of sequences
We have previously characterized one qua, one hog-only,
ten wrt, 17 grd, and 32 grl ORFs from C. elegans, three of
which are pseudogenes [19,38]. Furthermore, we have
identified 49 hh-related genes in the related nematode
Caenorhabditis briggsae [38]. We correct this number to 48
hh-related genes here, because C. briggsae wrt-8 is the same
locus as wrt-4. To retrieve sequences from other species we
used selected Hh, WRT, QUA, GRD and GRL protein
sequences as queries for tblastn and blastp searches at
Stellabase, the DOE Joint Genome Institute, The Genome
Sequencing Center at the Washington University School
of Medicine, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR),
and NCBI (see Methods). The recovered sequences were
aligned to sequences that we had assembled previously

[18,19,38]. When obvious discrepancies in conserved
regions were found in the newly retrieved ORFs, genomic
sequences were inspected for additional or extraneous
exons or alternative splice sites, and ESTs were examined
for frameshifts. ORFs were corrected to optimize matches
to existing motifs, and extraneous N-terminal residues
were truncated when methionine residues followed by
good N-terminal signal peptides for secretion were found.
One caveat is that our ORF predictions from genomic
sequences are still limited due to partial nature of the various contig assemblies. In some instances an ORF runs
into an unsequenced region (e.g., B. malayi wrt-4). In the
case of ESTs it was often possible to assemble several ESTs
into contigs, but in most instances ORFs derived from

ESTs lack either N-terminus and/or C-terminus. Considering also that the various genome projects are are in different states of completion, the nomenclature given here to
the ORFs should be considered preliminary. After correction of the ORFs multiple sequence alignments of the different protein domains were made and used for
phylogenetic analyses using Neighbor Joining and Maximum Likelihood. We also prepared protein sequence
logos of the Hog domains of Hh and nematode Hhrelated genes to aid with the analysis of more divergent
Hog domains (Figure 1, Additional files 1, 2, 3). We
extended the motif nomenclature of inteins by introducing motifs J, K, and L (Figure 1, Additional file 2). Motif J
corresponds to motif G in inteins [34-37], however,

Motif B

Figure sequence alignment of Hog domains, part 1
Multiple2
Multiple sequence alignment of Hog domains, part 1. Multiple sequence alignment in this and other figures was carried
out using first MUSCLE and then imported into Clustal_X. Manual adjustments to the alignment were carried out using SeaView. Color coding was modified from default Clustal_X color coding by marking all cysteine residues in yellow, small hydrophobic residues in light blue and large hydrophobic residues in cyan blue. The Hint domain, as well as the C-terminal SRR or ARR
regions are indicated above the alignment. Motifs A, B, F, J, K, and L are indicated with red rectangles underneath the alignment. Species abbreviations are shown in Table 3. Note that not all sequences in this alignment are complete.

because this motif is so distinct in Hog domains, we have
ventured to give it its own name here. Motifs K and L are
located in the SRR and are primarily found in Hog
domains of Hh proteins (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additional file 1).
In the Hog domains of nematode Hh-related proteins,
these two regions show a number of differences compared
to the Hh proteins (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additional files 1, 2, 3),

hh-related genes in B. malayi and other Chromadorea
The nematode B. malayi is a parasitic nematode that is one
of the more distantly related members to C. elegans within
the order of Rhabditiada [39]. We have previously

Multiple sequence alignment of Hog domains, part 3. Continuation of the multiple sequence alignment of Figure 3.

described a quahog gene, qua-1, in B. malayi [19], and
obtained partial sequences from ESTs for two wrt, one grd
and two grl genes [17]. Here we retrieved a total of four wrt
genes, one with a Hog domain (Bm wrt-6), two without a
Hog domain (Bm wrt-10, Bm wrt-5/3) and one whose Cterminus is presently unknown (Bm wrt-4) (Table 1, Fig.
2, 3, 4, Additional file 4). Based on phylogenetic analyses

of both the Hog domain and the Wart domain (Figure 5,
6, 7, Additional files 5, 6, 7), Bm wrt-10 is a clear orthologue of Ce wrt-10, wrt-5/3 is a co-orthologue of Ce wrt-5
and wrt-3, and – based primarily on the Hog domain – Bm
wrt-6 is an orthologue of Ce wrt-6. The wrt-6 ORF encodes
a full Wart domain, however the previously identified wrt6 EST [17] lacks the C-terminal half of the Wart domain.

The left column indicates the gene structure, with Hog referring to
the combined Hint/SRR or Hint/ARR domain. Known pseudogenes
are indicated in brackets.

Comparison with the genomic sequence revealed that this
EST spans exons 1, 2, the first 10 nucleotides of exon 3
and continues then into exon 10, 11, and 12, which contain the Hog domain (data not shown). The point of discrepancy in exon 3 is not at a splice site, therefore this
unusual EST might represent a cloning artifact. Bm wrt-4
cannot be assigned unequivocally as orthologue of Cb
wrt-2 or Cb wrt-4, but it appears to group with them. Ce
wrt-10 lies next to Ce wrt-1 on the chromosome [17], however the Bm wrt-10 contig is too small to determine,
whether another wrt gene resides next to it.
One Ground domain gene was recovered from B. malayi,
Bm grd-5, that is co-orthologous to Ce grd-5 and grd-10
(Figure 8, Additional file 8). We have previously identified
a few grl genes from B. malayi in searches of ESTs [17].
Here, thirteen grl genes were recovered from B. malayi,
however, only a few could be identified as orthologues of
C. elegans genes, i.e. grl-4, grl-16, and perhaps grl-7 and
grl-17 (Figure 8, Additional file 8). Other grl genes have
clearly duplicated within the B. malayi branch, e.g. Bm
grl-x1, gr l-x2 and grl-3, which are more similar to each
other than to other genes.
A few ESTs were retrieved from other Chromadorea nematodes: In Meloidogyne incognita we found a gene with similarity to wrt-6 (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and one grl gene,
Msp3, which is expressed in the esophagal gland cells [40]
(Additional file 8). In Parastrongyloides trichosuri a gene
with similarity to wrt genes was found (Additional file 7).

hh and hh-related genes in Enoplea nematodes:
Xiphinema sp. and Trichinella spiralis
C. elegans and B. malayi belong to the class of Chromadorea. Our database searches revealed now also Hog-containing genes from the distantly related class of Enoplea
nematodes, i.e. Xiphinema index CSEQDL01, and T. spiralis, both members of the Dorylaimia [39]. From Xiphinema
we retrieved ESTs for nine distinct genes, and from T. spiralis five (Table 1), one of which (Ts Xhog1) is also supported by ESTs. All five T. spirals ORFs have a signal
peptide sequence for secretion, and although many of the
Xiphinema ESTs are incomplete, in several instances
methionine residues followed by good signal peptides
could be found at the 5' of the ESTs (XC Thog, Shog1,
Shog2) (Additional file 9). One gene from Xiphinema
(XC hh) and one gene from T. spiralis (Ts hh) are clearly
hh genes (Figure 2, 3, 4, 9, Additional file 10), since they
both have a Hedge domain and a Hog domain. One gene
from T. spiralis has a QUA domain upstream of the Hog
domain (Ts qua-1). While its Qua domain is rather divergent, the cysteine residues are all conserved (Additional
file 11). Ts Xhog3 has a rather short region upstream of
the Hog domain, which cannot be extended, because it is
delimited by an upstream cyclin gene, for which ESTs are
available (data not shown). After cleavage of the signal
peptide and subsequent autoprocessing through the Hog
domain the predicted N-terminal peptide of Ts Xhog3
would only be 34 residues long. In Xiphinema the three
ORFs with a signal peptide (XC Shog1, Shog2, and Thog)
have rather short predicted N-terminal sequences as well.
In the case of XC Shog1 it is only 15 residues long, in the
case of XC Shog2 it is 25 residues, and in the case of XC
Thog it is 79 residues long with an unusual stretch of
about 70 residues almost entirely composed of threonine
and serine residues. Two T. spiralis genes reside next to
each other on the chromosome (Ts Xhog1 and Xhog2).
They share sequence similarity upstream of the Hog
domain with six conserved cysteine residues. In addition,
XC Xhog5 also has sequence similarity to the upstream
regions of Ts Xhog1 and Xhog 2 (Figure 10).

Apart from the similarities in the regions N-terminal to
the Hog domain indicated above, the remaining N-terminal sequences show no obvious similarities between each
other or to any other proteins. Only the threonine-rich
stretch is reminiscent of the 200 residue long threonine
stretch in the N-terminal region of the choanoflagellate
Hoglet protein [22]. However, this may be a case of convergent evolution. No Wart, Ground, or Ground-like
domains could be detected in the genome of T. spiralis or
in EST database searches restricted to Enoplea.
Based on phylogenetic analyses of the Hog domains, XC
Xhog1, Xhog2, Xhog3, and Ts Qua-1 form a clade with the
Quahog proteins (Figure 5, 6, Additional files 5, 6, 7).

Figure 5
Phylogenetic tree of Hog domains
Phylogenetic tree of Hog domains. Phylogenetic trees were built from aligned Hog domains (Figure 2 – 4). The Neighbor
joining tree was created using the default settings of Clustal_X. Bootstrap values of 1000 trials are indicated in the figure. In this
and subsequent phylogenetic tree figures Enoplea sequences are highlighted in light green, Cnidarian sequences in yellow, Choanoflagellate sequences in light red and fungal sequences in blue. The Hh sequences are marked with Hh and the nematode Hhrelated sequences are marked with NemaHog. The root was placed between the red algae/plant sequences and the remaining
sequences. Some incomplete sequences were omitted in this tree. Additional phylogenetic analyses were also carried out, for
example by omitting the protist sequences and using the fungal sequence GmGIN1 as outgroup (Additional files 5, 6, 7). Overall, the results were very similar.

Figure sequence alignment of Enoplea Hog proteins with a new upstream motif
Multiple10
Multiple sequence alignment of Enoplea Hog proteins with a new upstream motif. Multiple sequence alignment of
Enoplea Ts Xhog1, Ts Xhog2, and XC Xhog5 reveals new conserved regions upstream of the Hog domain.

While N-terminal sequences for XC Xhog1, 2 and 3 are
lacking they could be bona-fide Quahog proteins. A second, distinct clade is formed by Ts Xhog1, Xhog2, and XC
Shog1, Xhog4, Xhog5 and Thog, indicating that they are
derived from a common ancestor (Figure 5, 6, Additional
files 5, 6, 7). In three cases, Ts Xhog1, Xhog2 and XC
Xhog5), a common upstream sequence (Enop) has been
identified (Figure 10), which seems to be specific to Enoplea nematodes, suggesting that at least in the cases of XC
Shog1 and Thog the N-terminal regions have diverged relatively recently.
Almost all nematode Hh-related proteins form a distinct
clade, the only exception being the Hh proteins, and Ts
Xhog3 and XC S2hog, which are both very divergent and
do not fall into the Hh clade of genes either (Figure 5, 6,
Additional files 5, 6, 7). Two features distinguish the Hog
domains of the nematode Hh-related proteins from those
of the Hh proteins (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, Additional files 1, 2,
3). 1) The regions corresponding to motifs K and L have
characteristic differences in their conserved residues in
nematode Hh-related proteins. 2) Two conserved cysteine
residues are found in the central region of the Hog
domain. When these two residues are mapped onto the Xray structure of the C-terminal autoprocessing domain of
Drosophila Hh [12], it emerges that they lie adjacent to
each other and therefore could form a disulfide bond.
This feature might stabilize this type of Hog domain in an
extracellular environment, and this extra stability might
possibly provide some new functionality. It is however
not unique to nematode Hog domains. Zebrafish ihha
and ihhb and fugu dhh (fhh) also have this extra cysteine
pair, which must represent convergent evolution. It is
worth pointing out that Ts Hh lacks the two cysteine residues and has motifs K and L as expected from a bona-fide
Hh molecule. However, the quite divergent Ts Xhog3 protein, which lacks a Hedge domain, also lacks the cysteine
residues and has motifs K and L.

hh and hh-related genes in Cnidaria
tlastn searches of the N. vectensis predicted ORFs returned
10 hits. Several turned out to be differently predicted ORF
variants most likely derived from the same locus, since
corresponding genomic sequences for some of these loci
displayed >99% identity. In the end six distinct ORFs were
retrieved that all had good signal sequence for secretion.
For four of the ORFs ESTs were found that at least partially
support the predictions (Table 1, Additional file 9). In the
case of Nv 239508 the corresponding genomic region
seems to have undergone a recent duplication as two virtually identical Hog domains are present there (Additional file 12). In addition to the N. vectensis sequences,
ESTs for two genes from Acropora millepora and one gene
from Hydra magnipapillata were identified (Additional file
9). The EST from H. magnipapillata could be extended
using the blastn of the NCBI trace archives, which also
revealed a second, closely related paralogous gene (Additional file 9). Two genes from N. vectensis and one from A.
millepora are bona-fide hh genes, because they both
encode a Hedge domain and a Hog domain (Figure 2, 3,
4, Additional file 10). Two other ORFs, Nv 120428 and
Acm DY579185, share conserved sequences upstream of
the Hog domain with at least 3 conserved cysteine residues (Figure 11). The N-termini of Nv 140260 and
239508 do not show any similarity with known motifs,
and the processed N-terminal peptide of Nv 140260 is
only 86 residues long. Similarly, the upstream region of
Hm CO905822 and its close paralog do not shown any
similarity to the upstream regions of other cnidarian Hog
proteins.

Last but not least, Nv 200640 is predicted to be 3592
amino acids long and is highly unusual. It is similar to the
Hh proteins through the N-terminal Hedge domain (blast
expected probability: 1e-18 to Ciona Hh), but no Hog
domain follows (Additional files 10, 13). The Hedge
domain is encoded by two exons, and after an intron of

Figure sequence alignment of two cnidarian Hog proteins with a new upstream motif
Multiple11
Multiple sequence alignment of two cnidarian Hog proteins with a new upstream motif. Pairwise sequence alignment of cnidarian Nv 120428 and Acm DY579185.
600 bp many additional exons continue the ORF of the
JGI prediction, but nowhere in this genomic region
resides a Hog domain. Analysis of the ORF using the
SMART server revealed that these extra exons encode multiple motifs with significant sequence similarity to other
proteins (Additional file 13). The first motif, encoded by
exons 3 and 4, contains a von Willebrand factor (vWF)
type A domain (VWA). For example, the VWA domain of
chicken collagen, type XIV, alpha 1 (undulin) is retrieved
with a blastp probability of 8e-28. After the VWA domain,
21 CA (Cadherin repeat) domains follow, they occur as
repeats in extracellular regions and are thought to mediate
cell-cell contact when bound to calcium. Further follow
two Immunoglobulin C-2 Type domains, two EGF
repeats, a transmembrane region, and finally an SH2
domain.
The phylogenetic analysis of the cnidarian Hog domains
reveals that they cluster primarily with the Hh Hog
domains (Figure 5, 6, Additional files 5, 6, 7), albeit
mostly with insignificant bootstrap values. The Hog
domain of Nv 241466 Hh has the best similarity to the Hh
Hog domains, and clusters with the deuterostome Hh
proteins. Nv 140260 and Nv 239508 are most similar to
each other, suggesting a likely duplication event within
the cnidarian lineage. Nv 120428 and Acm DY579185
may also be related to these two proteins via their Hog
domain (Figure 5, 6, Additional files 5, 6, 7), but the bootstrap values are not significant. The Nv 95413 Hh protein
is rather divergent, and the Hydra sequence Hm
CO905822 is also very divergent and does not from a
clade with any of the N. vectensis sequences. Therefore, it

is not possible to determine, whether all the cnidarian
Hog genes originated all from a single ancestral gene in
the cnidarian lineage, or whether hh and other Hog genes
were already present before the split of Cnidaria and Bilateria. The Hedge domains of the three N. vectensis ORFs
are more divergent than the bilaterian Hedge domains
(Figure 9, Additional file 10). The Hedge domain of Nv
241466 Hh is most similar to bilaterian Hh proteins, with
a best blast probability of 2e-52 to a fish Hedge domain.
Nv 95413 Hh is more divergent, with a best blast probability of 5e-36, and Nv 200640 is the most divergent
Hedge domain, with a probability of 1e-18 to a Ciona Hh.
Hog genes in lower eukaryotes
In order to detect Hh sequences from lower eukaryotes,
tblastn searches were performed using the organism
restriction "eukaryotes NOT bilateria". This recovered a
number of genomic and EST matches from lower animals,
fungi, plants and protists (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additonal files 9,
14). One EST was recovered from the sponge Oscarella carmela, which was previously described [27]. Analysis of this
sequence shows that, while it does have a Hedge domain,
the downstream sequence does not contain the start of a
Hog domain in any frame (Additional file 10). No
sequence similarity to a VWA domain is detected in that
fragment either. Nevertheless, it indicates that as in the
case of Nv 200640, this gene may not contain a Hog
domain.

A match was detected to the gene GmGIN1 from the fungus Glomus mosseae, which belongs to the Glomeromycota, a sister group of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes

and had already been described as having similarity to Hh
[29]. The Hog domain has a blast probability of 7e-18 to
the best matching Hh Hog domain, which is much better
than the blast probability of choanoflagellate Hoglet to
the best matching Hh Hog domains (4e-10). Furthermore, good matches to motifs J and K, as well as a region
with similarity to motif L. Therefore, GmGIN1 contains a
bona-fide Hog domain (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additional file 14).
The upstream domain of GmGIN1 shares similarity with
Ras-like GTPases, e.g. the Arabidopsis protein AIG1
(avrRpt2-induced gene 1) and the animal The IAN/IMAP
subfamily [29]. However, this ORF lacks a signal peptide
and may therefore not be secreted.
A number of matches were found in Alveolata, i.e. in the
dinoflagellates Alexandrium tamarense, Amphidinium carterae, and Karlodinium micrum (blast expected probability
of aKm Hog: 9e-17 to the best matching Hh Hog domain;
note: blast probabilities below also refer to Hh Hog
domains) and the apicomplexans Cryptosporidium muris
and Cryptosporidium parvum (blast prob. of aCp Hog: 4e08). Their Hog domains contain motifs J and K, although
in a few cases the cysteine has been replaced with a serine
in motif J (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additional file 14). The aCm and
aCp sequences are most likely full length, they have signal
peptide sequences for secretion and share a conserved
upstream region of about 100 residues in length that contains two conserved cysteine residues (Figure 12), but no
sequence similarity of this motif to other known domains
was found.
Further Hog sequences were found in red algae and
mosses (Figure 2, 3, 4, Additional file 14): In the mosses
Selaginella moellendorffii (blast prob.: 1e-09) and Physcomitrella patens one sequence each with a Hog domain; in
the red algae Chondrus crispus two sequences (blast prob.
of rCc Hog: 1e-10); in Griffithsia japonica one sequence
(blast prob.: 3e-08); in Porphyra haitanensis (blast prob. of
rPh Hog: 4e-07) and Porphyra yezoensis two Hog domain
ORFs each; and in Gracilaria changii six ORF fragments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/127

(blast prob. of rGc Hog1: 3e-12). Those moss and red
algae Hog domains that are not truncated have motifs J
and K, although the cysteine residue in motif J has been
changed to serine, threonine, or aspartate. Alignment of
rPy and rPh Hog2 revealed conserved sequences upstream
of the Hog domain, however, these two sequences are relatively closely related so this conservation is not surprising (Figure 13). Blast searches with this upstream region
did not reveal matches in any other organisms. Similarity,
alignment of the moss sequences revealed also a conserved upstream region that was not found in other organisms (Figure 14). The P. patens sequence is presumably full
length, since it was predicated from genomic sequence,
and it has a good signal peptide. One EST sequence supposedly stems from rice (XX 104K18), however, it has a
much better match to Hh Hog domains (blast prob.: 3e24) than other non-metazoan Hog domains, and we
could not find any match to rice genomic sequences.
Therefore, this sequence may come from a contaminating
organism and is designated as species XX here.
Additional Hog-like sequences were recovered from the
cercozoan Bigelowiella natans (blast prob.: 9e-10), from
the cryptophyte Guillardia theta (blast prob. of crGt Hog1:
6e-11 to Hog of Mo hoglet), and from the jakobid Jakoba
libera (blast prob. jJl Hog1: 2e-05) (Additional file 14).
These sequences have motif J, although the cysteine has
been replaced, and in those cases, where the C-terminal
region is complete, it is clear that motif K is not conserved.
Sequence alignment of the J. libera Hog sequences
revealed conserved upstream sequences with some conserved cysteine residues (Figure 15). Numerous ESTs cover
jJl Hog1 and therefore its ORF could be complete. If this
is the case, the putative start methionine has a good signal
sequence for secretion, and therefore jJl Hog1 has the
same global structural features as the animal Hh and Hhrelated proteins, i.e. a secreted N-terminal domain followed by a Hog domain. Finally, three sequences were
recovered from the haptophyte Pleurochrysis haptonemofera. Sequence alignment revealed sequence conservation

upstream of the Hog domain with conserved cysteine residues. However, it is noteworthy that the Hog domain is
much better conserved than the upstream region, indicating that the upstream region can evolve more rapidly (Figure 16).
Overall, these results show that Hog domains occur in
many different branches of the major groups of eukaryotes. However, multiple losses seem to have occurred, since
in many branches we did not detect Hog domains, for
example, in Arabidopsis thaliana and other higher plants,
or in the currently sequenced ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, or in other sequenced organisms such as Dictyostelium.
Other genes of the Hh pathway in Enoplea and N.
vectensis
C. elegans not only lacks a bona-fide Hh molecule, but several other components of the Hh signaling pathway have
been lost as well. In particular orthologs of the Hh signaling pathway in recipient cells, i.e. smoothened, fused, suppressor of fused (sufu), and costa are missing [18]. On the
other hand, a homolog of the transcription factor Cubitus
interruptus (Ci/Gli) is present, albeit it has been adapted
for sex determination. And multiple homologs for the
receptor of Hh, i.e. Patched, have been found in C. elegans

[18], as well as the related molecule Dispatched, required
for secretion of Hh. Patched, Dispatched, Smoothened,
Ci/Gli and Hip have already been found in N. vectensis
[25,26]. We were particularly interested to find components lacking in C. elegans in the relatively well sequence
genomes of N. vectensis and T. spiralis. Using reciprocal
blast searches, we have attempted to identify these components of the pathway in Nematostella and Enoplea
(Table 2). In Xiphinema we only detected an EST for
patched, but this is not surprising giving the limitations of
the current dataset. In T. spiralis we detected patched, dispatched, dally-like and Ci/Gli, but found no evidence for
Ihog, smoothed, costa, fused, and sufu. This is actually identical to the situation in C. elegans. Presently about 56.8 Mb
of an estimated genome size of about 65 Mb has been
sequenced for T. spiralis [41]. If we assume that only about
80% has been sequenced, the probability of finding only
the genes listed in Table 2, but missing the others is
0.013%. If the sequence coverage is higher, this probability would even be lower. Therefore, we have to assume
that in T. spiralis, even though it has a bona-fide hh gene,
the Hh signaling pathway is compromised in a similar
way as in C. elegans.
In N. vectensis we found good orthologues for dispatched,
dally-like, patched, smoothened, fused, sufu and Ci (Table 2).

Figure sequence alignment of jakobid jJl Hog1, Hog2, and Hog3
Multiple15
Multiple sequence alignment of jakobid jJl Hog1, Hog2, and Hog3.

No obvious homolog was found for Ihog. In the case of
Drosophila costa, good matches to its human homologs
were found, and Drosophila costa is rather divergent.
Recently it has been shown that the mammalian homologues of fused and costa do not play the same key role in
the pathway as in flies, instead sufu plays a major role
[42,43]. Overall, it looks like most of the key players of the
Hh pathway are present in N. vectensis so that it is clear
that the pathway was already well established before the
split of Cnidaria and Bilateria.

proteins in Tetrahymena, several fungal species, the Heterolobosea Naegleria gruberi, the parabasilid Tritrichomonas foetus, dinoflagellates, the slime mold Physarum
polycephalum, rice and the chanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. Additional matches in other species, for example,
pine tree, were found in the EST database, but not
included here, because the fragmentary nature of the
sequence information made it impossible to determine,
whether the VWA domain resides in the same transcript as
the Hint domain (data not shown). No match could be
found for the cDNA sequence from rice (pOs AK110392)
in the genomic sequence, but ESTs recovered from other
plants support the notion that VWA-Hint proteins exist in
plants.

Genes with novel Hint-like (Vint) domains
During the tblastn searches ESTs and ORFs from non-Hog
genes such as inteins were discovered, usually in the nonsignificant zone at the bottom of the results lists. One
group of genes attracted our attention, because upon
closer inspection it became apparent that these genes had
an amino-terminal domain comprised of a VWA domain
followed by a region that has good similarity to the first
part of the Hint domain, i.e. in particular motifs A and B
(Figure 17, 18, 19, Additional file 15). This observation
was intriguing given that in Nematostella Nv 200640 a
Hedge domain is followed by a VWA domain. Further
blast searches revealed the presence of these VWA-Hint

The VWA-Hint proteins do not seem to have a signal peptide for secretion. The VWA domain is located at the N-terminus of the proteins, although in four cases a Ubox
precedes the VWA domain (Figure 17, 18, 19). A region of
around 300 residues separates the VWA domain from the
Hint domain. This region has several small patches of
conservation and one large region, that we propose to call
Vwaint domain. At the C-terminus a Hint-like domain follows, which is of similar size as a Hog domain. However,

the best conserved features are only motifs A and B, i.e. the
N-terminal region of the Hint-like domain. One region
shares a little similarity with motif F of inteins and BIL-Bs,
but motifs J, K and L are lacking (Figure 17, 18, 19). The
Hint-like domain is also rather different from inteins or
Hog domains, the best blast matches of aTt 00471620 are
to honeybee Hh with a probability 0.013. Therefore, these
sequences cannot be classified as intein, Hog or Bil
domains, and we refer to these genes as Vint genes. Vint
genes are apparently so wide spread in eukaryotes that we
have to assume that a common ancestor was present in
early eukaryotes. However, Vint genes seem to be lacking
in Arabidopsis, many fungi (for example, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae), and in Metazoa. Multiple independent losses
in different lineages seem the most likely explanation for
this absence.
Our searches also revealed a group of proteins from bacteria that had a Hint-like domain at their C-terminus and
shared some weak sequence similarity in their N-terminal
region (Additional files 16, 17). At least some of these
proteins are predicated to have signal peptides for secretion, and the upstream region has two cysteine residues
conserved between all sequences. The Hint-like domains
of these bacterial proteins are also quite divergent from
inteins, Hog and BIL domains, and represent yet another
subgroup. This subgroup has previously also been
detected by Dassa and Pietrokovski [21]. The new members we retrieved here support the notion that this is yet
another new type of Hint protein.

Discussion
Hh and hh-related proteins in nematodes
Hh genes are present in deuterostomes as well as in several
different protostome phyla such as molluscs, annelids,
and arthropods (Figure 20). However, in nematodes the
situation is more complex. In C. elegans, C. briggsae and B.
malayi we find no hh gene but instead many hh-related
genes. We recovered 19 hh-related genes from the nematode B. malayi. Based on empirical evidence from other
gene families we estimate that the genome of B. malayi is
around 80% complete (K. Mukherjee and T. B., unpublished). Therefore, some additional hh-related genes
might still be forthcoming. But the present survey shows
that members of the qua, wrt, grd and grl gene families are
all present in B. malayi. Only a representative of a grd gene
with a Ground domain has so far not been found. The
phylogenetic analyses show that while there are some
instances of direct orthology between B. malayi and
Caenorhabditis genes, in many instances, in particular for
the grl genes, the relationship is not clear and in fact suggests that independent diversification occurred in these
two Chromadorea branches. This shows that these gene
families have been actively evolving in nematodes.

In the more distantly related Enoplea nematodes Xiphinema sp. and T. spiralis a strikingly different pictures
emerges. In both species we find both a hh gene as well as
several hh-related genes. In T. spiralis we also find a quahog
gene, and – based on the phylogenetic analyses – some of
the Xiphinema genes could also be quahog genes. Two T.
spiralis and one Xiphinema protein share a new motif
(Enop motif) upstream of the Hog domain that appears to
be specific to Enoplea nematodes. However, there are also
a number of instances of N-terminal sequences that are

vWA domain

Figure sequence alignment of VWA domain – Hint-like domain proteins, part 1
Multiple17
Multiple sequence alignment of VWA domain – Hint-like domain proteins, part 1. Proteins containing a VWA
merged to a Hint-like domain were discovered in Tetrahymena, several fungal species, as well as several other eukaryote
branches, including choanoflagellates. The VWA domain and the Hint-like domain (Vint) with motifs A and B of the Hint
domain are marked in the alignment. A new domain between the VWA and Vint domain is marked with Vwaint. Four proteins
also have an Ubox upstream of the VWA domain. An alignment of selected Vint domains to Hh Hog domains is presented in
additional file 15. A. thaliana At5g60710 is not a Vint protein, but one of the best matching VWA domain containing proteins.
While it lacks the Vint domain, it does have some weak similarity to the Vwaint domain, and upstream of the VWA domain is
a Ring finger, which shares similarity with the Ubox motif. It would be worthwhile to investigate this similarity with a detailed
evolutionary analysis in the future.

very short. Several of these proteins cluster with the
"Enop" proteins in the phylogenetic analyses, suggesting
that they diverged from a common ancestor. However,
two proteins with short N-terminal regions (Ts Xhog3 and
XC Shog2) are rather divergent and do not reliably fall
within the clade of nematode-specific Hog proteins
("Nema-Hog" proteins) in phylogenetic analyses. In particular Ts Xhog3 lacks the conserved cysteine pair usually
found in Nema-Hog domains, and it shares motifs K and
L with Hh Hog domains, indicating it could be derived
from a Hh protein. Therefore, while these genes could
have diverged from hh or Nema-Hog genes, it may also be
possible that the represent ancestral genes that were lost in
Chromadorea. In conclusion, we think that there were

probably at least three different types of Hog genes in the
common ancestor of Enoplea and Chromadorea, one hh
gene, one quahog gene and one gene which give rise to the
wrt/grd branch in Chromadorea and the Ts Xhog1/2
branch in Enoplea. But possibly up to five Hog genes
could have existed in the common ancestor. The proliferation into further distinct groups such as wrt, ground and
ground-like appears to have happened later in a branch
specific manner.
Many different N-termini now exist in Nema-Hog proteins. Two possible mechanisms can explain this diversity:
Either acquisition of new N-terminal domains, or divergent evolution of existing N-terminal domains. A rela-

Multiple18
Multiple sequence alignment of VWA domain – Hint-like domain proteins, part 2. Continuation of the multiple
sequence alignment of Figure 17.

tively good case can be made that all Wart, Ground and
Ground-like domains arose from a single common ancestor based on weak sequence similarities between the
motifs [17]. This relationship is also supported by the
phylogenetic analyses of the Hog domains. Therefore,
multiple loss of the Hog domain must have occurred secondarily within the wrt and ground families. The presence
of the rather short N-termini in Enoplea suggests that
these regions have evolved and diverged through mutations, rather than by acquisition of a new domain. The
threonine-rich stretch in XC Thog is very likely the result
of polymerase slippage, though it is striking that this feature has evolved separately also in the choanoflagellate
Hoglet protein [22]. It is also worth mentioning that some
of the Caenorhabditis N-terminal domains have repetitive
regions outside of the conserved Ground and Ground-like
domains, mainly proline, glycine and serine. For example,
Ce grl-23 has a 176 residue long stretch upstream of the
Ground-like domain containing 125 glycine residues. In
conclusion, most of the observed variability in the N-terminal domains of nematode Hh-related proteins is prob-

ably the result of sequence divergence from a progenitor,
rather than acquisition of new domains. Loss of N-terminal domains in the case of C. elegans Hog-1, as well as loss
of Hog domains did occur however.
A surprising observation is the fact that T. spiralis has a hh
gene, but apparently lacks several components of the Hh
pathway, such as Smoothened. Particularly noteworthy is
that the components that appear to be missing are the
same as in C. elegans. This would suggest that the signaling
pathway was modified by loss already before the split of
Enoplea and Chromadorea, even though hh was maintained in Enoplea. While one could imagine that Hh
could be maintained in an animal parasite such as T. spiralis to affect host cells, this is very unlikely in the case of
the plant nematode Xiphinema. It implies that Hh has an
important function even in the absence of Smoothened,
and it refutes the hypothesis that the Nema-Hog genes
evolved directly from hh concomitantly with the other
changes in the Hh pathway.

Hog proteins in Cnidaria
In Cnidaria we also encounter a complex situation with
both Hh and Hh-related proteins. Both in N. vectensis and
A. millepora we find bona-fide hh genes that have a Hedge
and a Hog domain. Another gene is well conserved
between N. vectensis and A. millepora and has a distinct,
novel secreted N-terminal domain. Two further Hhrelated proteins in N. vectensis have yet other, distinct Ntermini. The upstream region of the two closely related
genes retrieved from Hydra do not share any similarity
with those in Nematostella, indicating divergent evolution. No sequence similarity of these new N-terminal
motifs has been found outside Cnidaria.

The hh-related genes from Cnidaria are however distinct
from those in nematodes, since the phylogenetic analyses
of the Hog domains does not show them to be closely
related. Therefore, we would like to suggest that – as in the
case of the nematode hh-related genes – the Cnidarian Nterminal domains have evolved from common ancestors
by divergent evolution rather than by domain acquisition.
The case of Nv 200640 is perhaps a special exception. In
this protein we find an N-terminal Hedge domain fused to
a large extracellular protein that contains a VWA domain
as well as CA and EGF repeats, but it clearly lacks a Hog
domain. The VWA domain is a 200 residue long domain
first identified in von Willebrand Factor [44,45]. VWA
domains are found both in extracellular and intracellular
proteins, such as non-fibrillar collagens, plasma proteins

such as complement factors and integrins, and they mediate adhesion via metal ion-dependent adhesion sites.
Likewise, the CA repeats also mediate adhesion in a Ca2+
dependent fashion. Therefore, the Nv 200640 protein is
probably involved in cell adhesion. This shows that the
Hedge domain can also evolve in a modular fashion and
separate from the Hog domain. The EST recovered from
sponges also has a Hedge domain that lacks the immediately following Hog domain, and may perhaps represent
also a protein lacking a Hog domain.
Hog proteins in lower eukaryotes
We have recovered a substantial number of Hog domain
proteins from many diverse groups of eukaryotes, mostly
protists, such as red algae, moss, alveolates (ciliates, dinoflagellates, apicomplexans), cryptophytes, jakobids, haptophytes, cercozoa and Glomeromycota fungi. While
some of these Hog sequences are quite divergent, they are
invariably most closely related to Hog domain proteins
from animals, and not to inteins, such as those found in
fungi, or to BIL or Vint domains. Given the widespread
occurrence in many of the major groups of eukaryotes
([46], we must conclude that Hog proteins were present
already in the earliest eukaryotes. We find diverse N-termini associated with the Hog domain that are only conserved to limited extends within groups (case in point are
the various conserved N-termini in nematodes). Many of
these limited conserved N-termini have conserved
cysteine residues, and in cases, where one can be quite
confident of the start methionine, they start with a good

Figure 20 the evolution of hh and hh-related genes
Summary of
Summary of the evolution of hh and hh-related genes. For detailed discussion of the evolution of the Hog proteins see
text. The right side shows the different types of ORFs found in different organisms. The sizes are not to scale. The "Hedge"
domain is marked in green, the Qua domain in orange, and the Hog domain in black, with yellow bars representing the conserved cysteine residues. T stands for poly-threonine repeats. Red 'X's mark branches where a gene loss occurred.

signal peptide for secretion. Only in the case of the fungal
protein GmGIN1 and the choanoflagellate Hoglet are distinct other N-terminal domains fused to the Hog domain.
Therefore, we postulate that an ancestral Ur-Hog gene
existed, with a secreted N-terminal domain and an autoprocessing Hog domain, that may have added a sterol or
similar moiety to its secreted N-terminus. This gene
evolved in concert with eukaryote evolution and was lost
in several branches. In animals, the question arises about
the origin of the Hedge domain. Both in sponge and in
Nematostella we find a Hedge gene that lacks a Hog
domain. Perhaps such a gene merged with a Hog domain
in early metazoans. However, the reverse process is also
possible: the Hedge domain evolved as an N-terminal variant of a Hog protein in early metazoans, and in the two
Hedge genes in sponge and Nematostella the Hog domain

was lost later. Both in Cnidaria and nematodes we find
both hh and hh-related genes. Did the hh-related genes
evolve twice independently from a hh precursor in each
lineage? This is certainly the most parsimonious hypothesis. Nonetheless, in an alternative scenario, a hh and a hhrelated gene could have been present in the common
ancestor of eumetazoa, and the hh-related gene would
have given rise to the cnidarian and nematode hh-related
genes. For this hypothesis to be true, we would have to
postulate three separate losses of hh-related genes: in deuterostomes, in lophotrochozoa, and in arthropods. While
this seems rather unlikely, we do observe many losses of
Hog genes in various branches of eukaryotes, as well as
loss of the Hog domain only in a number of nematode
genes so that such a series of losses may not be totally
impossible.

Novel Hint genes
Our searches revealed new genes with Hint motifs merged
to VWA domains. Given that a Hedge domain was found
fused to a VWA domain in Nematostella we investigated
this further and recovered a novel gene family. The wellconserved gene structure consists of a VWA followed by a
new domain, termed Vwaint, followed by the "Vint"-type
Hint domain. Unlike the Hog proteins, these proteins are
most likely not secreted and instead are processed inside
the cell. The Vint genes are present in many eukaryotic
groups, but must have been lost multiple times, in particular in multicellular eukaryotes. Multiple loss seems to be
a common theme also in Hog proteins and especially
inteins [21,32]. Inteins may be subject to special selective
pressure for loss [21,32], and this pressure may also
extend to Hog and Vint proteins. However, gene loss is
not uncommon. The N. vectensis genome contains a
remarkable complexity of highly conserved gene families
[25], and several instances of later gene loss in the protostome or deuterostome lineage, for example in the homeobox gene family, have been found [47,48], indicating
gene loss later in evolution is feasible.

Conclusion
We find that the evolution of Hh is more complex than
anticipated, and that this gene family is not simply
derived from an intein in early metazoan evolution. Both
in Cnidaria and nematodes parallel evolution between hh
and hh-related genes occurred. Given that the nematodespecific Hog domain (Nema-Hog) with its distinct features was already present in the progenitor of two very different nematode branches it may be possible that both Hh
and some other Hog domain protein was already present
in protostomes before the emergence of nematodes and
was lost in other lineages such as arthropods. The finding
of multiple Hog domain proteins in Cnidaria raises the
possibility that multiple distinct types of Hog domain
proteins also existed in ancestral Eumetazoa. Snell et al.
(2006) suggested that a precursor of a Hedge domain
fused to a Hog domain in early Metazoan evolution.
However, our discovery that an Ur-Hog gene probably
existed in the progenitor of eukaryotes makes if feasible
that Hh evolved from an ancestral Hog gene without
domain shuffling. In eukaryotes, we now know that at
least three different types of Hint domains evolved in parallel: Hog, Vint, and inteins. At present we do not know
the origin of the Hog and Vint domains, but perhaps new
Hint domains from bacteria, such as described here and
by Dassa and Pietrokovski [21] will shed light on that
issue in the future.

the Washington University School of Medicine [53]. N.
vectensis sequences were searched at Stellabase [54,28],
and at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [55]. Additional genome sequences such as for Naegleria gruberi,
Physcomitrella patens and Monosiga brevicollis were searched
at the JGI [55]. Zebrafish sequences were retrieved from
ZFIN [56,57]. The intein database was checked at New
England Biolabs InBase [30,58]. Manual sequence corrections were performed with the help of FGENESH and
FGENESH+ at Softberry [59] and PPCMatrix [60]. ESTs
representing the same locus were assembled using the
CAP3 server at Iowa State University [61].
Sequences were added to an existing database of Hh and
Hh-related proteins [38], and are shown in Additional file
9. Protist sequences were arbitrarily named Hog, Hog2,
etc. (Additional file 9). For identification and tagging of
sequences in the figures the species names were reduced to
two and three letter codes and prefixed to sequence names
(Table 3). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic
analyses using Neighbor joining were carried using
Clustal_X [62] and MUSCLE [63,64]. Manual correction
of alignments was carried out using SeaView [65]. For
Maximum likelihood analysis PHYML was employed
[66]. Signal peptide predication was carried out at the SignalP 3.0 server [67,68]. Protein sequence logos were generated using LogoBar [69,70]. Some protein motifs were
also identified using the SMART server [71].

Multiple sequence alignment of Hog domains used for the protein
sequence logos. Multiple sequence alignment in this and subsequent figures was carried out using first MUSCLE and imported subsequently into
Clustal_X. Color coding was modified from default Clustal_X color coding
by marking all cysteine residues in yellow, small hydrophobic residues in
light blue and large hydrophobic residues in cyan blue. The conserved
motifs, as well as the C-terminal SRR or ARR region are indicated in the
alignment. The two conserved cysteine residues found in the Hog domain
of nematode Hh-related proteins are indicated with red arrows.

Neighbor joining tree of Hog sequences which were truncated at the Nterminus. Hog sequences were truncated at the N-terminus to have the
same size as the Pt wrt sequence fragment. This analysis shows that Pt wrt
clusters with the wrt genes (arrow). GmGIN1 was used as outgroup.
Note: Apart from Figure 5 and 6, and Additional files 5-7 further phylogenetic analysis were carried out that are not shown here. For example,
the intein from vacuolar ATPase from C. tropicalis was used as outgroup
[22] and gave comparable results to the tree analyses shown here.

Structure of the Nematostella vectensis genomic assembly around Nv
239508. Current assembly of the genomic region around Nv 239508.
Color arrows indicate duplicated regions. N gap indicateds two regions
with unknown sequence. The green area shows the ESTs found mapping
to this region. The CAGN20453 correpsonds to Nv 239508. The yellow
area shows regions of sequence similarity, i.e. hydrolase domain, Hog
domain, and Reverse transcriptase. CAGN20453 is not sequenced fully,
but the 3' read has been mapped to the right side, since the 3' untranslated
region matches better to the 2. repeat of the duplication due to some indel
differences. However, as will be noted, the final resulting transcript
(shown at bottom) would be rather unusual, as it would splice over
another gene, i.e. the hydrolase, which is also supported by an EST.
Hence, the genomic organization and gene structure in this region could
be subject to change, especially given the unsequenced areas.
