Abstract
Background: Fragmentary conservation of synteny has been reported between map-anchored
Prunus sequences and Arabidopsis. With the availability of genome sequence for fellow rosid I
members Populus and Medicago, we analyzed the synteny between Prunus and the three model
genomes. Eight Prunus BAC sequences and map-anchored Prunus sequences were used in the
comparison.
Results: We found a well conserved synteny across the Prunus species – peach, plum, and apricot
– and Populus using a set of homologous Prunus BACs. Conversely, we could not detect any synteny
with Arabidopsis in this region. Other peach BACs also showed extensive synteny with Populus. The
syntenic regions detected were up to 477 kb in Populus. Two syntenic regions between Arabidopsis
and these BACs were much shorter, around 10 kb. We also found syntenic regions that are
conserved between the Prunus BACs and Medicago. The array of synteny corresponded with the
proposed whole genome duplication events in Populus and Medicago. Using map-anchored Prunus
sequences, we detected many syntenic blocks with several gene pairs between Prunus and Populus
or Arabidopsis. We observed a more complex network of synteny between Prunus-Arabidopsis,
indicative of multiple genome duplication and subsequence gene loss in Arabidopsis.
Conclusion: Our result shows the striking microsynteny between the Prunus BACs and the
genome of Populus and Medicago. In macrosynteny analysis, more distinct Prunus regions were
syntenic to Populus than to Arabidopsis.

Background
Prunus belongs to Rosaceae, the third most economically
important plant family in the United States and other
temperate regions of the world [1,2]. Within Rosaceae,
Prunus contains the most diverse array of crops: fruits such
as peach, apricot, plum, sweet cherry, and sour cherry,

nuts like almond, and lumber trees like black cherry.
Other important fruit producing crops in Rosaceae
include apple (Malus), pear (Pyrus), raspberry/blackberry
(Rubus) and strawberry (Fragaria). In addition, Rosaceae
contains a wide variety of ornamental plants including
roses, flowering cherry, crabapple and quince.

Significant conservation of the genomes among the Prunus member species has been shown by comparative mapping studies [3]. For example, comparisons of the anchor
marker positions on the Prunus reference map with those
on 13 other maps showed that the genomes of the diploid
Prunus species are essentially collinear [3]. Large collinear
blocks among different genera in Rosaceae, such as Prunus
and Malus, were also detected [3]. Similar conserved collinearity of shared markers has also been observed among
other closely related species within the grasses [4], legumes [5,6] and between potato and tomato in the
Solanaceae [7].
With the increase in available genomic sequence data,
more laboratories have looked at collinearity at the
genome sequence level. The synteny between rice and
other cereals are shown to be high [8], and substantial
micro-collinearity among legumes was reported [9-11].
These comparisons have revealed that the conserved syntenic regions, detected by marker collinearity, were often
interrupted by small genome rearrangements such as
insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations [1214]. Large scale sequence data has also enabled the detection of micro-collinear regions in less closely related species without apparent macrosynteny [15]. Small scale
microsynteny was observed when a 276 kb region of the
model legume Medicago (rosid I) was compared with the
genomic sequence of Arabidopsis (rosid II) [16]. Conversely, no macrosynteny was found when the two
genomes were compared using 172 mapped markers of
Medicago [16]. Significant levels of local synteny were also
detected covering segments of 1 Mb of Arabidopsis and
regions of <5 cM in lettuce and sunflower, members of the
asterids, even though the macrosyntenic patterns covering
larger segments were not evident [17]. A recent study
detected microsynteny between coffee, another asterid
species, and the Arabidopsis genome using putative orthologous sequences and BAC ends [18]. We have previously
detected conserved syntenic regions between Prunus and
Arabidopsis using 475 peach ESTs anchored to Prunus
genetic maps and 1097 peach ESTs anchored to BAC contigs [17]. The conserved syntenic regions were short and
fragmentary, and often the Prunus regions matched to
more than one Arabidopsis block. This complex network of
microsynteny, often including non-collinear regions,
between Arabidopsis and the distantly related species suggests multiple genome duplications followed by differential gene loss [15-21]. Large segmental or whole genome
duplication followed by gene loss seems to be prevalent in
the evolution of all flowering plant genomes, and the
degree of genome instability seems to be higher in some
species of Brassicaceae, such as Arabidopsis, and in some
species of Poaceae as well [22-24].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/76

Synteny analysis across species provides insight on the
evolutionary relationships between different lineages and
also the opportunity to study the relationship between
genome structure and function of organisms. The microcollinear regions conserved between model organisms
like Arabidopsis and lesser-studied organisms can also
facilitate marker saturation and candidate gene searches.
For example, micro-collinearity data between Arabidopsis
and rice has been utilized in the improvement of phylogenetic resolution of the expansin gene family [25]. Multiple
rounds of polyploidization or large segmental duplication
followed by gene loss, however, can greatly obscure the
synteny, impeding the transfer of genomic knowledge
from model species genomes to those of less well characterized species.
The recent availability of the whole genome sequence of
Populus trichocarpa provides another resource in the detection of conserved synteny among plant genomes [26].
Also available are the partially sequenced Medicago
genome [11]. Populus and Medicago belong to rosid I
which also includes Prunus; hence Prunus is evolutionarily
closer to them than Arabidopsis which belongs to rosid II.
Populus is of particular interest to compare with Prunus
since Populus is completely sequenced, is a fellow tree species and it appears to be more stable compared to the Arabidopsis genome; nucleotide substitution, tandem gene
duplication and gross chromosomal rearrangement proceed more slowly in Populus then in Arabidopsis [26]. The
detection of melon BAC regions that are more conserved
in Populus than in Medicago or Arabidopsis [27] and the
report of papaya BACs that are more collinear in Populus
than in Arabidopsis [28] also suggest that the Populus
genome may be useful in the exploration of distantly
related species genomes.
With near completion of the peach physical map [29] and
the development of EST-derived genetic markers, the
numbers of sequences that are anchored to Prunus genetic
maps or the peach physical map have doubled since our
previous synteny analysis between Prunus and Arabidopsis.
Also available to us are four homologous Prunus BAC
sequences and four additional peach BAC sequences.
Using these data, we analyzed the degree and the pattern
of the conserved syntenic region between Prunus and Populus or Arabidopsis. We also compared the Prunus BAC
sequences with the partially sequenced Medicago genome
to gain further insight on the genome evolution of the
related plant species.

Results
Prunus BAC sequences show extensive conserved synteny
with the Populus and Medicago genome, but not with the
Arabidopsis genome
Sequences from four Prunus BACs, and four additional
peach BACs, 028F08, 082I18, pPn31C7, and
PpN089G02, were used to assess the degree of conserved
synteny with the Populus, Medicago, and Arabidopsis
genomes. The four Prunus BACs were selected using the
same probe to study disease-resistant genes in Prunus species, so they potentially represent homologous genomic
regions. These include one peach BAC with two contigs
(058P54-C23 and 058P54-C24), one apricot BAC
(AprC27), and two plum BACs (Plum045O02 and
Plum080O24). Gene prediction was conducted with
FGENESH [30]. The two peach BACs, 028F08 and 082I18,
overlap by 2 kb and two genes, predicted by FGENESH
program (see Methods). The combined sequences of the
two BACs are 77.7 kb long and contain a total of 38 predicted genes (028F08-082I18_1 to 028F08-082I18_38).
The peach BACs pPn31C7 and PpN089G02 were 48.8 kb
and 132.2 kb long and had nine (pPn31C7_1 to
pPn31C7_9) and 42 (PpN089G02_1 to PpN089G02_42)
predicted genes, respectively. The two contigs of a peach
BAC and the three Prunus BACs that contain putative disease-resistant genes, 058P54-C23, 058P54-C24, AprC27,
Plum045O02 and Plum080O24, had 19 (058P54-C23_1
to058P54-C23_19), 9 (058P54-C24_1 to 058P54C24_9), 11 (AprC27_1 to AprC27_11), 13 (045O02_1 to
045O02_13) and 4 (080O24_1 to 080O24_4) predicted
genes, respectively. The sizes of the peach, apricot and
plum BAC sequences were 90 kb, 41 kb and 70.1 kb,
respectively. Cumulatively, the total length of peach BACs
used in our analysis was 350 kb.

The predicted gene sequences in these Prunus BACs and
their Populus, Medicago and Arabidopsis homologs were
used to find conserved syntenic regions. Syntenic groups
were identified when the distance between the two adjacent matches was less than 200 kb and when the syntenic
regions contain at least four gene pairs. We first detected
collinear syntenic regions using the DAGchainer program
[31] and then merged the overlapping syntenic regions.
This method gave us a more comprehensive view of the
syntenic regions which include sections where gene contents are conserved but not the gene order due to smallscale genome rearrangements.
The Prunus BACs had syntenic regions in the Populus and
Medicago genome, but no detectable syntenic regions in
Arabidopsis (Figure 1, 2). Interestingly, two distinct Populus
genomic regions were detected for each of the Prunus BAC
regions, and the two corresponded to the duplicated Populus genomic regions that were generated by the most
recent whole-genome duplication event, which occurred

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/76

60–65 million years ago [26]. Figure 1 shows these syntenic regions in LG_V and LG_VII of the Populus genome
that are conserved with BACs from across the Prunus species: peach, plum, and apricot. The syntenic regions span
50 kb in the plum BAC, 44.3 kb in the peach BAC, 37.5 kb
in the apricot BAC, and 60.4 kb and 117.2 kb in LG_V and
LG_VII of the Populus genome, respectively. These three
Prunus BACs also showed conserved synteny with Medicago, in three different chromosomal regions (Figure 2).
Detection of more than one syntenic region in Medicago
correlates with the whole genome duplication event in
Medicago, which was proposed to have occurred after the
split between the legumes and Salicaceae (poplar) and
before the separation of Medicago and Lotus [11]. Cannon
et al. [11] shows extensive synteny between chr5 and chr8
of Medicago, and we detected two regions in chr5 and chr8
of Medicago that are syntenic to the Prunus BACs (Figure
2). The gene order was well conserved in all these syntenic
regions without any signs of translocation, but there was
a 142 kb gap in the syntenic region in chr08 of the Medicago genome (Figure 2). No syntenic regions in Arabidopsis
were detected for these four Prunus BACs.
The two overlapping peach BACs, 028F08 and 082I18,
with a total of 38 predicted genes had remarkably wellconserved syntenic regions in LG_VI and LG_XVI of the
Populus genome (Figure 3). Of the 38 predicted genes in
the combined peach BACs, 26 and 19 showed conserved
synteny with the regions in LG_VI and LG_XVI, respectively. In combination, 30 out of 38 predicted peach genes
belong to the syntenic groups that are conserved in LG_VI
or LG_XVI of the Populus genome. The gene order, as well
as the gene content, was conserved between Populus and
peach. The syntenic regions span 133 kb in the peach
BACs, and 395 kb in LG_VI and 477 kb in LG_XVI of the
Populus genome. The actual sizes of the syntenic regions
can be larger since the synteny extends to the end(s) of the
BAC clone (Figure 3). There were signs of tandem gene
duplication in both the Populus region and the Prunus
region (Figure 3). In comparison, two small syntenic
regions with only four or five genes spanning 49 kb or 27
kb of the peach BACs and 13 kb or 7.3 kb of the Arabidopsis genome were detected in Arabidopsis (Figure 3). The
overlapping peach BACs also detected a syntenic region in
the Medicago genome (Figure 4). Two parts in the combined peach BAC detected different regions in the chr02
of Medicago, separated by 7.3 Mb, suggesting a translocation event or potential miss-assembly due to the incompleteness of the Medicago genome assembly (Figure 4).
The peach BAC PpN089G02 detected three conserved syntenic regions in Populus LG_II and LG_VII (Figure 5A). The
block in LG_II and a block in LG_VII shared four gene
matches to the BAC PpN089G02, and the other region in
LG_VII were syntenic to an overlapping region (Figure

Figure 3 syntenic regions between the two overlapping peach BACs and the Poplulus or Arabidopsis genomes
Conserved
Conserved syntenic regions between the two overlapping peach BACs and the Poplulus or Arabidopsis
genomes. When peach sequences match more than one genes in Populus, the matches with lower E value (lower PID when
the E value is the same) are depicted with dotted lines. The matches between the peach sequences and the Arabidopsis genes
are depicted with dotted lines. Only the predicted genes showing homology with genes in other genomes, not the intervening
genes, are depicted. The numbers on the left side of the bar stand for base pair positions in the Prunus BACs, the Populus linkage groups, or the Arabidopsis genome. The lengths of the syntenic regions and the total numbers of predicted genes in the
regions are given below the bar.

5A), suggesting all these three blocks represent a duplicated region that went through selective gene loss. The
syntenic regions span 112 kb in the peach BAC
PpN089G02, and around 60 kb in all three Populus
regions. The peach BAC pPn31C7 showed conserved syntenic regions in LG_II and LG_V of the Populus genome,
which share five gene pairs (Figure 5B). The syntenic
regions span 35 kb in the peach BAC pPn31C7, and 48 kb

and 53 kb of LG_II and LG_V of the Populus genome. In
the analysis with the partially sequenced Medicago
genome, we found one syntenic region that shares four
genes with the peach BAC PpN089G02 (Figure 5A). No
syntenic regions for the two peach BACs, PpN089G02 and
pPn31C7, were detected in the Arabidopsis genome.

Figure 5 syntenic regions between peach BACs and the Populus or Medicago genome
Conserved
Conserved syntenic regions between peach BACs and the Populus or Medicago genome. These BACs did not have

numbers on the left side of the bar stand for base pair positions in the Prunus BACs, Populus or Medicago linkage groups. The

The fact that we detected microsynteny between all the
Prunus BACs and Populus genome is noteworthy. Also the
level of conserved synteny within the individual blocks
(synteny quality) between the Prunus BACs and Populus
was strikingly high considering the divergence between
these two genomes 99 million years ago [32]. Cannon et
al [11] has reported that the quality of all predicted

orthologous blocks between the legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus that diverged 40 million years ago,
is 54% ± 14%. They calculated "synteny quality" as twice
the number of matches divided by the total number of
genes in both segments after excluding transposable elements and collapsing tandem duplications. The syntenic
quality between Prunus BACs and the Populus genome

Only the blocks that the synteny does not extend to the border of the BAC were used.
* Twice the number of matches divided by the total number of genes in both segments

ranged from 20 to 44%, without considering the orthology of the blocks or collapsing tandem duplications
(Table 1). We only used the syntenic regions where the
synteny did not extend to the border of the BAC to calculate the syntenic quality. The syntenic quality between the
Prunus BACs and Medicago genome ranged from 11 to
40% (Table 1).
The E values of most of gene matches in the syntenic
regions were considerably lower than our cut-off value,
1E-6 (see Methods). 96.3% and 97.1% of the gene
matches in Prunus-Populus and Prunus-Medicago, respectively, had an E value of less than 1E-10. The median E values were 1E-93 and 1E-109 in Prunus-Populus and PrunusMedicago, respectively.
Synteny Analysis between map anchored peach sequences
and the Populus or the Arabidopsis genome
To assess the degree of macrosynteny conservation, we
used two sets of map-anchored Prunus sequences in the
analysis. One set comprised of 1093 sequences that are
anchored to the TxE Prunus reference map [33]. The
majority of these sequences are peach fruit ESTs but also
include sequences from markers that were directly used in
mapping. Some ESTs are anchored to multiple positions
and the number of anchored sequences in each linkage
group is as follows: 281 in G1, 364 in G2, 268 in G3, 424
in G4, 221 in G5, 209 in G6, 65 in G7 and 310 in G8.
Another set comprised of peach EST sequences that are
anchored to the peach physical map. This data comprised
of 2140 EST sequences that are anchored to 1500 BAC
contigs and their Populus and Arabidopsis homologs.

These map-anchored sequences and their Populus and Arabidopsis homologs were used to find conserved syntenic
regions. The syntenic groups were selected when the distance between the two adjacent matches were less than the
maximum distance and when the syntenic regions contain at least four gene pairs (See Methods).

There were 8 and 17 syntenic regions containing four or
more gene pairs between Prunus TxE map and Populus or
Arabidopsis. Between the peach physical map and Populus
or Arabidopsis, 10 and 17 syntenic regions were detected,
respectively. Some syntenic groups between Prunus and
Arabidopsis were not collinear, but all the groups between
the Prunus and Populus were collinear (Table 2). In the synteny analysis with the TxE genetic map anchored
sequences, the number of gene pairs were similar: four to
five in Populus and four to seven in Arabidopsis genome
(Table 2). The syntenic groups span 5 to 15.7 cM in both
cases, but span longer in Populus (424 kb – 3.26 Mb) than
in Arabidopsis (197 kb – 1 Mb), reflecting the larger intergenic space in Populus than in Arabidopsis (see Methods).
Similarly, the peach physical map anchored sequences
detected longer syntenic regions in Populus (158 kb – 1.1
Mb) than in Arabidopsis (42 – 812 kb), even though the
length of the syntenic regions in the physical map was
similar in both cases (Table 2). All ten syntenic groups
between the peach and Populus had four gene pairs, but
eight out of 17 syntenic groups between the peach and
Arabidopsis had more than four gene pairs (Table 2). As
seen in the analysis with the Prunus BACs, the E values of
most of the gene matches in the syntenic regions were
considerably lower than our cut-off value, 1E-6 (see Methods). The median E values were between 2E-39 and 3E-51
(Table 2), and 90% to 100%, depending on the data sets,
of the gene matches had the E value of less than 1E-10.
Interestingly, despite the smaller number of syntenic
groups in Populus than in Arabidopsis, the syntenic groups
in Populus actually detected the similar or more distinct
regions in the Prunus TxE map and physical map, respectively (Table 3). Table 3A shows that the 17 syntenic
groups in Arabidopsis and the eight syntenic groups in Populus were matched to similar regions in three linkage
groups of the TxE genetic map, G3, G5 and G8. In other
words, the same regions in the TxE map detected more
than twice the number of syntenic regions in Arabidopsis
than in Populus, suggestive of multiple genome duplica-

Syntenic groups covering the three trait loci anchored to G3 of the Prunus TxE. Map. The three trait loci shown
are Ag (anther color), PcP (polycarpel), and Fc (flower color). There are multiple Prunus sequences that are anchored to the
same position of the TxE Prunus map. The two Populus or Arabidopsis genes are linked by straight lines when the two genes are
matched to the same Prunus sequences and by dotted lines when the two genes are matched to different Prunus sequences that
are anchored to the same position. The approximate length in peach genome is calculated from the TxE map size 524 cM [39]

tion events in Arabidopsis. An example is shown in Figure
6; a region in G3 of the TxE map that displays synteny
with four distinct regions in the Populus genome and seven
distinct regions in the Arabidopsis genome. In the analysis
with peach physical map anchored sequences, ten groups
in Populus matched to five different BAC contigs, but 17
groups in Arabidopsis matched to only three different BAC
contigs (Table 3B). Five and 14 of the syntenic groups
were matched to one BAC contig, ctg259 (Table 3B). Even
though the BAC contig ctg259 had almost three times
more syntenic regions in Arabidopsis than in Populus, the
ctg259 regions that are syntenic to Arabidopsis were only
18% larger than those in Populus (Table 3B).

We also analyzed for Prunus blocks that match to more
than one site in the Populus or Arabidopsis genome. These
were detected by selecting syntenic regions that share
more than three Prunus sequences. We found one Prunus
block in G5 of the TxE map matching to regions in two
different Populus linkage groups, LG_II and LG_XIV (Figure 7A). We also found that a Prunus block in ctg468 of
the physical map matches to regions in LG_II and LG_V
(Figure 7B). Tuskan et al [26] have reported that major
part of the LG_II is homologous to either LG_V or
LG_XIV, generated by the most recent shared wholegenome duplication event. The blocks that we detected in
Prunus map G5 and peach BAC contig ctg468 showed syn-

Prunus blocks that match to more than one site in the Populus genome
Prunus blocks that match to more than one site in the Populus genome. The two conserved syntenic groups are
selected when more than three Prunus sequences had matches with two different regions in Populus or Arabidopsis. (A) A region
in G5 of the Prunus TxE map matches to regions in LG_II and LG_XIV. (B) A region in peach BAC contig ctg468 matches to
regions in LG_II and LG_V. Also shown is a block in peach BAC pPn31C7 that is syntenic to regions in LG_II and LG_V, each
region is 1.7 Mb apart from the corresponding region that is syntenic to ctg468. The approximate base pair length in peach
genome of the syntenic region in genetic and physical map is calculated from the TxE map size 524 cM [39] and the peach
genome size 290 Mb [43], and the total physical length of the peach physical map, 303 Mb, [29] and the total unit length of the
BAC contigs, 242772.
teny to the corresponding parts of LG_II that is reported to
be homologus to either to LG_V or LG_XIV. Interestingly,
the block in the BAC contig ctg468 was syntenic to regions
in Populus LG_II and LG_V that are each 1.7 Mb distant

from the regions that were syntenic to peach BAC
pPn31C7 (Figure 5B, Fig 7B). This suggests that BAC contig ctg468 and the peach BAC pPn31C7 may be linked.
We did not detect any Prunus blocks sharing more than

three sequences and matching to two different regions
even though we observed many cases of multiple Arabidopsis regions matching to similar Prunus regions. All the
multiple Arabidopsis regions that match to similar regions
in Prunus share none or less than three sequences, suggesting Arabidopsis genome underwent severe gene loss after
multiple genome duplication.
Syntenic regions around agronomically important trait loci
in the Prunus TxE map
The position of 28 major trait loci affecting agronomic
characters found in various Prunus species have been previously established in the TxE map using the data from
different linkage maps anchored with the TxE reference
map [3]. We were interested in finding any syntenic
regions conserved between the TxE Prunus map and the
Arabidopsis or Populus genomes covering these trait loci.
Several syntenic regions matched to trait-loci containing
regions in G3 of the Prunus TxE map (Figure 6). The trait
loci contained in these syntenic regions are Ag for anther
color of peach and almond (yellow/anthocyanic), PcP for
the polycarpel trait of peach [34], and Fc for flower color
(pink/pale pink) in peach [35]. All these syntenic regions
span 8.3 cM to 15 cM in the TxE map and contained either
two or three trait loci (Figure 6). Among the four Populus
blocks that matched to these regions, two blocks in
LG_XII and LG_XIV seem to represent duplicated blocks,
since two genes matched to the same peach sequences and
two genes matched to the sequences that are anchored to
the same position in the TxE map. The other two Populus
blocks in LG_I and LG_XII may also represent duplicated
regions since one of the genes matched to the same peach
sequence and the rest matched to the sequences that are
anchored to the same position in the TxE map. There were
seven Arabidopsis blocks that matched to these regions.
Some blocks share one to two genes that match to the
same peach sequences and other blocks share two to three
genes that match to the sequences that are anchored to the
same position in the TxE map. The complex network of
synteny in Arabidopsis in this region is also indicative of
multiple independent genome duplications and rearrangements in the Arabidopsis genome.

Simulation study
To determine whether the syntenic groups we report were
detected by chance, we tested the statistical significance
for each group. Both Populus and Arabidopsis genomes
were randomized by leaving the locations the same but
permuting the gene names. We analyzed 1000 simulated
Populus and Arabidopsis genomes for the occurrence of
each conserved syntenic group and calculated the probability of the match occurring by chance. The probability of
the association by chance was less than 0.1% for all the
syntenic groups between Arabidopsis or Populus and the
Prunus physical map, less than 1% for groups between
Populus and the Prunus genetic map, and less than 5% for
the groups between Arabidopsis and the Prunus genetic
map. The numbers of syntenic groups at various significance thresholds are shown in Table 4.

Discussion
We compared the level of conserved synteny between the
Prunus genome and the whole genome sequences of two
model organisms, Arabidopsis and Populus, and the partially sequenced Medicago genome. Since the whole
genome sequence of peach or other Prunus sequences is
not currently available, we employed available Prunus
BAC sequences to assess the level of conserved microsynteny and map-anchored Prunus sequences to assess the
pattern of synteny throughout the genome. In the Populus
genome, we found well-conserved syntenic regions in all
the BACs studied, and the syntenic regions cover almost
the entire length of the BACs in some cases. All the BACs
showed conserved synteny with two regions in two different Populus chromosomes, supporting the proposed event
of the whole genome duplication in Populus [26]. The conserved gene content in the two different Populus genomes
showed that different sets of genes were lost in the duplicated Populus regions. The order of genes in these BACs
and both of the Populus regions were very well conserved,
without signs of genome translocations. The synteny quality within each block was also considerable. On the contrary, we did not detect that level of microsynteny between
Prunus BACs and the Arabidopsis genome. The two
microsyntenic regions between these contained only four
and five gene matches. We also found well-conserved syntenic regions between Prunus BACs and the partially

sequenced Medicago genome. Interestingly, the homologous BACs of plum, peach, and apricot detected three syntenic regions in three different chromosomes of Medicago.
These three regions may be indicative of large-scale or segmental duplication events in the evolutionary history of
Medicago, in addition to the whole genome duplication
event proposed to have occurred within the rosid I clade.
The other two peach BACs detected only one syntenic
region in Medicago. This may be explained by the fact that
the Medicago Genome Release 1.0 constitutes only 38–
47% of the entire genome. Another possibility is that
these peach BACs do have only one conserved syntenic
region in Medicago genome. It has shown that the level of
internal synteny within both Medicago and Lotus is much
lower than the intergenomic synteny between the two,
presumably through significant gene loss and rearrangement after the whole genome duplication event [11].
Our study analyzed a fine-level microsynteny between
Prunus and the three model dicot organisms. Our results
substantiate our previous findings that the level of geneorder conservation between peach and Arabidopsis is very
fragmentary [17,36]. The microsynteny between the Prunus and Populus genome, however, is much better conserved, promising the utility of the Populus genome in the
study of the Prunus genome and vice versa when the peach
genome is sequenced (underway by the Joint Genome
Institute). Our results also suggest that the Prunus genome
may be closer to Populus than to Medicago, which is evolutionarily closer to Prunus than Populus. Similar results have
been reported; two melon BACs showed more conserved
synteny to Populus than to the evolutionarily closer Medicago [27]. Lai et al. [28] reported that ordered papaya BAC
end sequences showed a higher level of synteny with poplar than with the more closely related Arabidopsis which
both belong to the Brassicales.
We also employed Prunus sequences that are anchored to
the Prunus genetic map or the peach physical map to study
the level of conserved synteny at the whole genome level.
Only the completely sequenced genomes of Populus and
Arabidopsis were used in this analysis. A number of syntenic regions that contain several gene pairs were detected
between Prunus map anchored sequences and both Populus and Arabidopsis genomes. The number of the syntenic
regions was actually higher in Arabidopsis than in Populus.
However, in most cases, multiple Arabidopsis regions were
syntenic to the overlapping regions in the Prunus TxE map
or peach BAC contigs, resulting in a complex network of
synteny. In contrast, the syntenic regions in Populus
detected more distinct regions in Prunus. We found blocks
in both the Prunus genetic map and peach physical map
that were syntenic to two different homologous regions in
Populus genome. However, we did not find any Prunus
regions that detected homologous regions in the Arabidop-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/76

sis genome despite the fact that multiple Arabidopsis
genomic regions were syntenic to overlapping Prunus
regions. Our findings are consistent with previous reports
that the Arabidopsis genome went through multiple large
genome duplication events followed by frequent gene loss
[37,38]. The multiple Arabidopsis genome regions with
synteny to overlapping Prunus regions, which we
observed, may represent the duplicated regions that subsequently went through gene loss. Simillion et al. [37]
have reported that high frequency of gene loss after duplication in Arabidopsis reduces collinearity and that, at
extreme, the duplicated regions no longer share homologous genes. They have shown that they could detect these
highly degenerated duplicated blocks by indirect comparison with other segments. The synteny obscured by severe
subsequent gene loss can impede the transfer of genomic
knowledge from one species to another, suggesting the
potential problem of using Arabidopsis in the study of
other species such as those in Prunus. In contrast, the Populus genome is reported to be a more stable and homologous genome; blocks that have arisen from the most
recent genome-wide duplication event can be clearly
detected [26]. Our results corroborate these previous findings and suggest that Populus is better model to study synteny with Prunus genomes.

Conclusion
We report the evidence of well-conserved microsynteny
between Prunus BACs and two plant model species, Populus and Medicago. The observed network of synteny supported the whole genome duplication events, proposed to
have occurred in Populus and Medicago. Interestingly, the
level of synteny conservation seemed higher between Prunus-Populus than in Prunus-Medicago, even though Medicago, rather than Populus, is evolutionarily closer to Prunus.
In comparison, the level of conserved synteny between
the Prunus BAC and Arabidopsis was insignificant. We also
analyzed the extent of conserved synteny between Prunus
map-anchored sequences and the completely sequenced
genomes of Populus and Arabidopsis. We detected a
number of syntenic regions that contain several gene pairs
between Prunus map anchored sequences and both Populus and Arabidopsis genomes. In comparison to the synteny
between Populus and Prunus, we observed a more complex
network of synteny between Arabidopsis and Prunus in
which multiple Arabidopsis regions shows synteny to overlapping regions in Prunus.

Methods
Data Acquisition and Annotation
Three sets of Prunus sequences were used in the analysis of
conserved synteny between Prunus and the whole genome
sequences of Arabidopsis and Populus: Prunus BAC
sequences, Prunus sequences anchored to the Prunus reference map [1,39], and the peach EST sequences anchored

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:76

to the peach physical map [29]. Prunus BAC sequences
were also compared with the partially sequenced Medicago
genome [11].
The sequences of four peach BACs, 028F08 (AC154900),
082I18 (AC154901), pPn31C7 (AF467900), and
PpN089G02 (DQ863257), were downloaded from Genbank. The sizes of the sequences were 66.2 kb, 73.3 kb,
48.8 kb, and 132.3 kb, respectively. We also downloaded
the sequences of four Prunus BACs that contain a putative
disease resistant gene from the Genome Database for
Rosaceae (GDR) [40]. These include one peach BAC with
two contigs (058P54-C23 and 058P54-C24), one apricot
BAC (AprC27), and two plum BACs (Plum045O02 and
Plum080O24). The two peach BACs, 028F08
(AC154900), 082I18 (AC154901) are a contiguous
genomic segment. Gene prediction was done using the
FGENESH program [30].
Prunus sequences that are anchored to the TxE Prunus reference map were downloaded from GDR. The majority of
the 1093 anchored sequences were derived from peach
fruit ESTs [32]. Some ESTs were directly anchored to the
map by co-hybridization to BACs with genetic markers,
and others were indirectly anchored through hybridization to BACs that belong to the same BAC contig that contain anchored genetic markers. The positions (cM) of the
genetic markers were used as the positions for the genetically anchored ESTs on the map. The set also included
sequences of markers that are directly used in mapping.
The third set, also downloaded from GDR, comprised of
2140 EST sequences that were anchored to 1500 BAC contigs of the peach physical map. The position of the individual BACs in the BAC contigs were used as the positions
ESTs in the peach physical map. For the ESTs that are
anchored to multiple overlapping BACs in a BAC contig,
the innermost left and right positions were assigned.
The sequence data (TAIR6_pep_20060907) and the chromosome coordinate data (sv_gene.data) of the Arabidopsis translated proteins were downloaded from the Arabidopsis
Information Resources (TAIR) database [41]. The sequence
data (Poptr1_FilteredModels_proteins.fa) and the chromosome coordinate data(Poptr1_FilteredModels.gff) of the Populus translated proteins were downloaded from the JGI web
site
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.down
load.ftp.html. Medicago genome release version 1.0 data was
downloaded from http://medicago.org. International Medicago Genome Annotation Group (IMGAG) annotated protein sequences (MTpep1.txt) were used for our analysis.
Detection of conserved syntenic regions
The predicted protein sequences of the Prunus BACs were
compared with the Arabidopsis, Populus, and Medicago proteins by pairwise comparison using the BLASTP program.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/76

The top ten matches with an E value less than 10-6 were
used for further analysis. Syntenic groups were selected
when the distance between the two adjacent matches were
less than 200 kb and when the syntenic regions contain at
least four gene pairs.
Mapped Prunus sequences that are homologous to the
Arabidopsis or Populus proteins were determined by pairwise comparison using the BLASTX program. The top ten
matches with E value less than 10-6 were used for further
analysis. The syntenic groups were selected when the distance between the two adjacent matches were less than the
maximum distance and when the syntenic regions contain at least four gene pairs. For the synteny analysis
between the TxE genetic map and Populus or Arabidopsis,
the maximum distance was set as the approximate
genomic distance that covers about 100 genes – 1 Mb for
Populus and 0.5 Mb for Arabidopsis. This was approximated
by the genome size, 550 Mb for Populus [26] and 157 Mb
for Arabidopsis [42], and the predicted number of genes,
45,555 for Populus (annotation v1.1) and 32,041 (TAIR7
Genome release) for Arabidopsis. For sequences anchored
in the TxE Prunus genetic map, we selected a less strict
parameter, 5 cM, as the maximum distance since most of
the sequences are not directly mapped, but are indirectly
anchored to the position by the association with other
mapped markers (see above). 5 cM is 0.95% of the TxE
map (524 cM) [39] and 0.5 Mb that we used for Arabidopsis is about 0.35% of the genome (157 Mb). We used a
smaller maximum distance – 0.5 Mb for Populus and 0.25
Mb for Arabidopsis – for the synteny analysis between the
peach physical map and Populus or Arabidopsis, since the
sequences are positioned to BAC contigs, which are much
smaller than chromosomes or linkage groups. The maximum distance in peach BAC contig was set to 200 unit
lengths (unit given in the FPC output), which corresponds
to 0.25 Mb. One unit length corresponds approximately
to 1.25 kb, estimated from the total physical length of the
peach physical map, 303 Mb, [29] and the total unit
length of the BAC contigs, 242772.
We employed DAGchainer [31] to detect collinear segments conserved in Prunus and other genomes of Arabidopsis, Medicago and Populus. When we used mapanchored Prunus sequences, we found many cases in
which multiple collinear segments, detected by the software, reside in the same or overlapping genome regions.
This occurs when the two genomes in comparison contain
syntenic regions in which gene contents are conserved but
the gene order is not well conserved, which is caused by
differential small genome rearrangements such as conversions, translocations and duplications in the evolutionary
history of two genomes. In these regions, DAGchainer can
detect more than one collinear syntenic region in the
same genomic block by selecting the gene pairs with the

conserved order. To solve this problem, we merged the
overlapping syntenic regions that are generated by
DAGchainer. The syntenic groups were merged when they
overlap or when they are separated by less than the maximum distance between the two adjacent matches in both
genomes. The merged syntenic groups represent syntenic
regions in which the gene contents are conserved but not
the gene order. This procedure provides us with a more
accurate assessment of the degree of conserved synteny
between the two genomes. The Prunus blocks that match
to more than one site in the Populus or Arabidopsis genome
were detected by selecting syntenic regions that share
more than three Prunus sequences. All the in-house developed scripts are available to the public when requested.
Evaluation of the conserved syntenic regions
To determine whether the syntenic groups we report were
detected by chance, we tested the statistical significance
for each group. Both of the Populus and Arabidopsis
genomes were randomized by leaving the locations the
same but permuting the gene names. We analyzed 1000
simulated Populus and Arabidopsis genomes for the occurrence of each conserved syntenic group and calculated the
probability of the match occurring by chance.
