Abstract
Background: The continued depletion of tropical rainforests and fragmentation of natural habitats
has led to significant ecological changes which place most top carnivores under heavy pressure.
Various methods have been used to determine the status of top carnivore populations in rainforest
habitats, most of which are costly in terms of equipment and time. In this study we utilized, for the
first time, a rigorous track classification method to estimate population size and density of clouded
leopards (Neofelis nebulosa) in Tabin Wildlife Reserve in north-eastern Borneo (Sabah).
Additionally, we extrapolated our local-scale results to the regional landscape level to estimate
clouded leopard population size and density in all of Sabah's reserves, taking into account the
reserves' conservation status (totally protected or commercial forest reserves), their size and
presence or absence of clouded leopards.
Results: The population size in the 56 km2 research area was estimated to be five individuals, based
on a capture-recapture analysis of four confirmed animals differentiated by their tracks.
Extrapolation of these results led to density estimates of nine per 100 km2 in Tabin Wildlife
Reserve. The true density most likely lies between our approximately 95 % confidence interval of
eight to 17 individuals per 100 km2.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that previous density estimates of 25 animals/100 km2 most likely
overestimated the true density. Applying the 95% confidence interval we calculated in total a very
rough number of 1500–3200 clouded leopards to be present in Sabah. However, only 275–585 of
these animals inhabit the four totally protected reserves that are large enough to hold a long-term
viable population of > 50 individuals.

Background
Many large carnivores are under severe threat from permanent loss of suitable habitat as well as direct persecution,
making their protection a top conservation priority. Due
to their spatial requirements, these species are among the
first to suffer when human populations expand and alter
pristine habitats [1]. The conservation of large predators is
vital, due to the critical role they play in the long term persistence of biodiversity and stabilization of ecosystems [27]. Detailed management plans are a prerequisite for the
effective conservation of such keystone species. These
plans need to be based on sound, reliable and accurate
information regarding the ecology of the species as well as
the status and health of the population. Hence, reliable
methods providing accurate data on abundance, population trends, and threats are of extreme importance. However, for many carnivores, basic information on life
history parameters and population ecology is lacking.
This shortcoming is a significant challenge for wildlife
managers [8]. In the recent past, most studies on large carnivores applied radio telemetry and camera trapping to
estimate home range sizes and densities. [9,10] These
methods, however, are very costly, time consuming,
labour intensive and require experienced investigators.
The value of simpler methods such as track counts is often
underestimated, even though recent studies have shown
the power of such techniques [11,12]. This study applied
a technique described by Smallwood and Fitzhugh [11] to
identify individual mountain lions (Puma concolor) by
their tracks, allowing for inventorying and monitoring
carnivores at low costs with relatively little effort [13].
The clouded leopard is the largest cat of Borneo, weighing
between 11–25 kg. The name "clouded leopard" refers to
the distinctive cloud-like fur pattern [14]. Several adaptations such as the proportionately short legs, the large,
broad paws with sharp claws and the exceptionally long
tail give clouded leopards amazing arboreal skills, including the ability to climb down trees head-first [15].
The clouded leopard currently shows a rather patchy distribution throughout its range [16]. Many of the remaining forest areas are too small to ensure the long-term
persistence of clouded leopard populations making effective monitoring and management measures necessary.
Their partly nocturnal and far-ranging behaviour [9], their
low densities [17], and the fact they inhabit densely vegetated habitats and remote areas makes the censusing and
monitoring of clouded leopards extremely difficult. Consequently, little is known about their behaviour and status. A total of only seven clouded leopards have ever been
radio collared [9,17,18] and the study of Grassman et al.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/6/16

[9] is the only one which systematically surveyed a
clouded leopard population in situ. Most other available
information on clouded leopard ecology is anecdotal
[19,20], based on local interviews [21,22] and a few sighting reports [23,24], or stems from captive animals
[15,25]. According to Davies and Payne [26] and Rabinowitz et al. [21], clouded leopards can regularly be seen
walking along jungle trails and roads in Borneo, making
previous assumptions of them being strictly arboreal by
Pocock [20] and Wood [27] questionable.
At present, the clouded leopard is listed by IUCN as vulnerable [28] and included in CITES Appendix I. Based on
interviews in Malaysian Borneo in 1986, Rabinowitz [21]
concluded that clouded leopards seemed not to be in
imminent danger of extinction there. However, because of
ongoing deforestation and logging this may have
changed.
The goal of this study was to determine the local population density of clouded leopards in Tabin Wildlife
Reserve. A specific objective was to develop a reliable and
cost-effective monitoring technique that could be widely
transferred to other protected areas. In this paper we
present the first study that combines a rigorous track classification method with a capture-recapture model for
research on an elusive carnivore. Furthermore we extrapolated the calculated density of clouded leopards to a landscape level to draw inferences on their distribution regionwide.
The ultimate goals of the study were to contribute to the
knowledge of the ecology of clouded leopards and to give
the first status assessment for Sabah of one of the most
threatened cat species in Asia.

Results
Tracking
During the field work six track sets consisting of 1, 4, 8,
10, 13 and 14 pugmarks were recorded. All tracks were in
good condition and were measured several times. Track
set (TS) 3 consisted of only one mark but was found after
a sighting of an adult male and could therefore be
assigned to this individual. TS 1 and TS 4 were smaller in
size. The last three TSs (TS 2, 5, 6) were larger and similar
to the one track found after the above-mentioned sighting. The left front pugmarks of these TSs were always
smaller in size than the right front tracks of the same TSs.
Two of those three TSs, TS 5 and TS 6, were recorded on a
mud-volcano (Fig. 1). This mud-volcano is visited on a
regular basis by many animals as a natural salt lick. TS 3
and TS 4 were recorded along the southbound road,
whereas TS 1 and TS 2 were found along the old logging

road running east to west. Although two transects followed existing jungle trails, which were supposed to be
used by clouded leopards frequently, no tracks were spotted there. This might have been as a result of leaves covering most of the ground. In addition to tracks observed on
the roads, eight TSs were detected along stream transects.
These tracks were of poor quality and could neither be
allocated without doubt to clouded leopards nor could be
measured accurately. Thus these tracks had to be excluded
from the analysis.
Individual identification by tracks
A paired t-test indicated that the means of the total width
from each TS from front left and right tracks differed significantly (n = 5, t = -3.3, p = 0.03). Although all other
track characteristics appeared to be similar for respective
left and right measures (all p < 0.05), we analyzed front
left and right marks independently to account for the differences in track sizes. In contrast, means from rear left
and rear right tracks of the same clouded leopard were not
statistically different (n = 4, t = -0.5, p = 0.65). Thus we
could combine left and right rear tracks for the analysis to
increase the level of statistical power. Due to the small
sample size, tracks found on slightly different substrates
were combined for analysis, but substrates differed more
within one track set than between the track sets.

In our analysis in each of the three cases (independent
analysis for rear, front left and front right tracks) the first
two principal components (PC) explained over 97 %
(eigenvalues for rear tracks × 1 = 13.4, × 2 = 0.3; for front
left tracks × 1 = 13.5, × 2 = 0.3; for front right tracks × 1 =
13.8, × 2 = 0.1) of the total information within all 14 variables with PC 1 explaining always over 96 %. This finding
suggested that the first PC would already be sufficient to
differentiate the tracks, but a two-dimensional graph with
the first two PC would be preferable for a better illustration.
Figure 2 shows the scatter plot for the rear tracks. All tracks
from both TS 1 and TS 4 form clusters, but are spatially
separated in the scatter plots, suggesting that these track
sets were left by two different clouded leopards. The tracks
of TS 2, TS 5 and TS 6 intersected with each other and
grouped together in space suggesting that those tracks sets,
found at different locations and dates, were of the same
individual. Since TS 3 consists of just one pugmark it is
only found on figure 3, which shows the principal component analysis (PCA) of left front marks. The track from TS
3 is spatially separated in the scatter plot suggesting that
this track was produced by a different clouded leopard. In
summary, the track sets were probably formed by four different clouded leopards.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/6/16

Population size and density
The track classification technique resulted in a calculated
minimum number of four clouded leopards present in the
surveyed area between March and August 2005. The
results of the closure test (tracks: z = -0.118, p = 0.453)
provided no evidence of violation of the closure assumption (Table 1). The model selection algorithm of capture
identified M0 as the most appropriate model for both
analyses. We adhered to this suggestion and present population estimates under the M0 model (see discussion).
The analysis determined average capture probabilities to
be 0.06 and the estimated probability that a clouded leopard was captured at least once was 0.80 (Table 1). We estimated five (± 2.26 SE) clouded leopards to be present in
the research area on the basis of a capture-recapture analysis of the tracks. To estimate the true density we calculated an approximately 95% confidence interval. We used
a range of 2 SE on the upper side of the point estimates,
but we did not use 2 SE on the lower side of the point estimate, because a calculated number below the threshold of
identified individuals would not be reasonable. Thus we
set the number of differentiated individuals as the lower
limit. We did not use the confidence interval calculated by
CAPTURE, because the guidelines of CAPTURE noted that
low capture probabilities will lead to extremely wide confidence intervals that hold little information on the true
population size [29].

In order to calculate the population density within the
reserves, the effective surveyed area also had to be estimated. Applying equation 1 and data from Grassman [9],
a buffer width (W) of 1.58 km was generated. Buffering all
transects resulted in the research area (A), which comprised about 56 km2 (Fig. 1).
We estimated a rough density of nine individuals per 100
km2 in Tabin Wildlife Reserve. The true density lies most
likely between our approximately 95 % confidence interval of eight to 17 individuals per 100 km2.
Management implications
Based on the very rough density of nine individuals per
100 km2, we assume that at least all areas smaller than 350
km2 might be too small to contain a stable population of
clouded leopards (> 50 individuals). Thus, only protected
reserves larger than 350 km2 as well as reserves connected
to others can be considered as potential clouded leopard
refuges. Table 2 shows the list and status of all these protected areas in Sabah. In total they comprise an area of
about 30 000 km2, about 41 % of Sabah's land surface.
The presence of clouded leopards is confirmed in approximately 25 % of Sabah based on the last faunal survey and
direct observations (Fig. 4). About 12 % of Sabah's forest
reserves were not included in the last faunal survey, thus
no information about the clouded leopard's status in

these areas is available. Taking this into account, the
potential distribution of clouded leopards is about 37 %
of Sabah. Only six reserves are totally protected (Table 2),
covering an area of only 7 % of Sabah. One of these
reserves, Crocker Range NP, is divided by a mountain
range with elevations higher than 1500 m. Based on information of previous faunal surveys, clouded leopards in
Borneo only populate areas below 1300 m [26]. We
believe that the areas in Crocker Range NP below 1300 m
are too small and too fragmented to sustain a viable
clouded leopard population. We completely excluded
Kinabalu Park as a potential refuge for the same reasons.
The Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary consists of small
forest fragments too small and isolated to sustain a viable
clouded leopard population. Therefore Kinabatangan
Wildlife Sanctuary and Crocker Range NP were only clas-

sified as totally protected reserve (TPR) b in figure 4. The
last remaining four refuges (TPR a in figure 4), covering
only 5 % of Sabah, are isolated from each other with only
one connection via commercial forest reserves between
Maliau Basin and Danum Valley. Therefore, most of the
potential distribution range of clouded leopards is located
in commercial forest reserves, where selective logging and
licensed hunting is permitted.

In total, we estimated a very rough number of 1500–3200
clouded leopards inhabiting reserves in Sabah, based on
the density of eight to 17 individuals per 100 km2 (see discussion). Areas where no data about the presence of
clouded leopards were available or reserves which are
smaller than 350 km2 and not connected to other reserves
were excluded. According to our analysis, the four remaining reserves of total protection in Sabah harbour less than
20% of the entire clouded leopard population.

Discussion
Davies and Payne [26] provided the only previous, but
very rough, density estimate of clouded leopards in Sabah.
They assumed that 12 one-square kilometre study areas
were surveyed accurately enough to detect clouded leopards. On the basis of three observations (tracks or sightings), they concluded a density of one individual/4 km2 or
25 animals/100 km2. This estimation was intended as a
base for further research, but became a "quoted fact" in literature [30].
Our results lead to the assumption that Davies' and
Payne's [26] approach most likely overestimated the true
density even though we can not prove that Tabin's

clouded leopard population is representative for other
areas in Sabah. The expected relatively large and overlapping homeranges of clouded leopards might be just one of
the reasons why Davies' and Payne's method is not accurate. Our density estimate incorporates a few inaccuracies
as well, mainly due to the limited number of good track
sets which could be obtained in the relatively short study
period. We chose the null model M0 with constant capture
frequencies following Trolle and Kéry [31] in their study
on ocelots, although we are aware that due to the small
sample sizes, selection criteria were defaulted to the null
model M0 with minimum parameters involved. We are
also conscious that the M0 is sensitive to violations of the
underlying model assumption of homogeneous capture
probabilities [29,32], leading to underestimates of the
true density and of the standard error. In contrast to the
M0 model, the Jackknife population estimator Mh incorporates variable capture probabilities of individuals
[29,32]. Karanth and Nichols [10,33,34] pointed out that
this model tends to be the most robust to deviations from
model assumptions. However the Jackknife estimator

does not provide an adequate estimation of population
sizes if only a few animals are recaptured [29]. Based on
our experience in the research area, the Jackknife estimator tends to overestimate the true density. We are more
concerned about overestimating the true density, since
this will automatically lead to an underestimation of the
risk the population faces [35]. Even though the Chao Mh
estimator is more robust against low capture probabilities
compared to Jackknife it could not be applied, because the
capture frequencies did not satisfy the conditions asked
for. In addition, we believe that due to the social structure
of clouded leopards and the non-invasive nature of track
sampling, the encounter probabilities are almost homogenous, in contrast to the use of camera-trapping where the
animals' behaviour might lead to unequal access to the
camera-traps [10,33,34,36]. We would like to emphasize
that our estimates of nine individuals per 100 km2 should
be considered as rather rough estimates despite the fact
that they are based on more precise data and might come
closer to the true density than achieved in previous studies.

Protected areas in Sabah, ranked according to their protection status and importance for clouded leopard conservation
Protected areas in Sabah, ranked according to their protection status and importance for clouded leopard
conservation. Names of reserves are shown in Table 1. TPR a = Totally protected reserve with a stable clouded leopard population, TPR b = Fragmented TPR, CFR 1 = Commercial forest reserve with clouded leopards present, CFR 2 = CFR with
unknown clouded leopard status, CFR 3 = CFR with clouded leopards absent.

We also demonstrate that the rigorous technique used to
identify individuals via a thorough quantitative track survey is a feasible method to study even secretive cats in
tropical rainforests. This is the first study that applied this
method combined with a capture-recapture model in a
study on elusive cats. Earlier studies pointed out some disadvantages of identifying individuals by their tracks [3739]. Karanth et al. [40] reviewed that 30 years of "pugmark census method [41,42]" to estimate abundances of
tigers in India failed because the statistical assumptions
for abundance estimates were not considered. In our
study, however, we improved the data recording with digital images of the tracks, we enhanced the statistical analysis to separate the individuals and we incorporated the
capture probabilities to estimate the abundances. Thus

our results show that the method is practicable, as long as
research areas are small and inhabited by only a few individuals. This is a major limitation of the track classification method because only a small fraction of the entire
population can be distinguished by their tracks. As a
rough guideline we would suggest that the study area has
to be small enough that less than 10 individuals have to
be separated. It also has to be considered that even in
small populations (< 10 individuals) two animals may
have very similar track measurements and cannot be separated by a PCA. For that reason, the abundance estimates
using this method will always result in a minimum abundance. In our study only three track sets clustered with
each set having different measurements of right and left
front paws. Because this is very unusual, these tracks can

BMC Ecology 2006, 6:16

almost certainly be assigned to the same individual. We
found all good tracks along gravel or former logging roads
and on a mud-volcano. For further research this needs to
be considered as another limitation of the track classification method because it might be impossible to find
enough track sets in densely vegetated habitats. Because
clouded leopards like to travel along water courses (pers.
obs.), river beds and sand banks along small streams provide a particularly good opportunity to find tracks in forests. Unfortunately, all tracks detected along streams in
our study were of poor quality. This might not be the case
in other study areas. Although substrate is known to effect
the size of tracks profoundly and thus might complicate
future studies applying this method, we found greater variation within track sets than between track sets. Therefore,
we conclude that substrate did not substantially bias our
results.
In our analysis we extrapolated our results to other protected areas, although detailed information on these
reserves was lacking. We are aware that this might lead to
wrong conclusions in some cases. For example, the consequences of the forest structure (primary or secondary forest) could not be considered in our extrapolation.
The latest faunal survey proved the presence of the species
by tracks at one locality only and did not provide any
information on population sizes or on the spatial distribution of clouded leopards within the reserves. Therefore
our calculations most likely lead to an overestimation.
The exclusion of the small reserves and of those reserves
from which no data are available, on the other hand,
might have led to an underestimate of actual clouded
leopard numbers. We want to emphasise that the calculated numbers of clouded leopards in the reserves are very
rough estimates and that these numbers can only be a first
working hypothesis for future research. Nevertheless, we
believe that our calculations are of great value for further
management plans because they are the first, however
rough, population estimates ever published for clouded
leopards and they are based on empirical, although limited, evidence.
Our results show that only four totally protected reserves
covering only 5 % of Sabah possess the potential to hold
a stable clouded leopard population. However, two of
these refuges, Maliau Basin and Danum Valley, cover
areas of only 630 km2 and 459 km2, hence they might be
populated by only 50 to 107 and 37 to 78 individuals,
respectively. These numbers lie only slightly above our
assumed minimum viable population size.
Since only a small number of animals inhabit totally protected reserves we recommend that higher priority be
placed on sustainable management of commercial forest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/6/16

reserves. To ensure the long term persistence of viable
clouded leopard populations, the harvest of natural
resources from these areas should be limited and controlled. It has to be assumed that clouded leopard densities
declined in the recent past as a result of disturbance by
logging activities. In contrast to other carnivores such as
leopards (Panthera pardus) or mountain lions, clouded
leopards seem to be less able to adapt to human encroachment. They only rarely prey on domestic animals and
avoid habitats around human settlements (unpubl. data).
Those behavioural traits lead to the assumption that commercial forest reserves harbour a significant lower density
of clouded leopards and that our calculations most probably overestimated their actual numbers. Consequently,
those areas have to be larger in order to host viable populations. Illegal hunting of prey animals in some of those
areas might also have a negative effect on clouded leopard
densities. Direct persecution does not seem to have a substantial negative effect on clouded leopards in Sabah [21].
Further research activities in these harvested areas are
needed to reveal to what extent our calculations overestimated the abundances in such commercial forest reserves
and what impact logging activities, forest structure and
hunting have on the clouded leopard population and its
prey.
Compared to other areas where clouded leopards are distributed, Sabah has the potential to protect this species. If
the vast commercial forest reserves are protected and sustainably managed, they will serve as refuges for clouded
leopards, playing an important role in preventing
inbreeding depression by allowing genetic exchange
through dispersing animals.
Recent phylogenetic findings suggest that the clouded
leopard on Borneo might be a different species (Neofelis
diardi) [43]. If this proves to be true, research and conservation efforts on behalf of the species are of even greater
importance.

Conclusion
In this paper we present the first population estimates ever
published for clouded leopards based on empirical evidence. We demonstrate that the method used by Davies
and Payne [26] most likely resulted in an overestimate of
the true clouded leopard density. We also show that the
technique to identify individuals using a thorough quantitative track survey is a feasible method to study even
secretive cats in tropical rainforests. The combination of
this kind of track survey with a capture-recapture analysis
holds a high potential for further studies if the limitations
are well considered. Since our results indicate that only a
small number of animals inhabit totally protected
reserves we suggest that a higher priority be placed on sustainable management of commercial forest reserves.

Further research will be of great importance in understanding the ecology of clouded leopards in Borneo and
their role as top predator within the ecosystem. More surveys are needed throughout Sabah to clarify the status and
threats to this elusive species.

by the animals, the calculations might overestimate the
true densities. In contrast, other studies used functions of
home range size, density and trap spacing to calculate the
buffer width [51]. To overcome the uncertainties we considered both approaches and designed the following
equation to determine the buffer width W in our study:

Methods
Study area
The fieldwork was carried out in Tabin Wildlife Reserve
(Tabin or TWR) (5°15'–5°10'N, 118°30'–118°45'E), a
1,205 km2 protected area (gazetted as a Wildlife Reserve in
1984) in the eastern part of the Malaysian State of Sabah
in north-eastern Borneo (Fig. 5). Sabah lies close to the
equator, possessing a relatively constant tropical climate
with an annual rainfall in the study area of about 3000
mm. Tabin is Sabah's largest and oldest wildlife reserve
[44,45], currently managed by the Sabah Wildlife Department and the Sabah Forestry Department.

Excluding the so-called core area and seven smaller Virgin
Jungle Reserves, all other areas of Tabin (more than 80%
of the reserve) have been selectively logged between
1969–1989 [45,46]. No legal logging has taken place after
1989 [47]. Thus, TWR is a mosaic of forest types in different succession stages. A gravel road running north to
south along the western boundary separates the forest
reserve from the adjacent palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) plantations.
The reserve plays an important role as a dedicated ground
for the conservation of protected mammals in Sabah.
Tabin is home to some endangered flagship mammals,
such as the Borneo pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneoensis), the Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni), the banteng (Bos javanicus lowi) and the
orang utan (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus).
The study site was located adjacent to the Tabin field station on the western boundary of the reserve comprising 6
km along the North-South road, and another 6 km east
and west along an old logging road.
Determining the size of the area surveyed
An existing road, trail and stream system was used for all
tracking operations. This method promised to be more
successful than a square-based area approach with a
straight transect grid, because large cats are likely to travel
on existing paths [21,48-50]. A buffer was created around
each transect to estimate the size of the surveyed area as
accurately as possible. To calculate the buffer width, ecological factors of the target species were required [51].
Recent studies used the distance moved by tigers between
two photo-recaptures to calculate this parameter [33,39].
However, Soisalo and Cavalcanti [35] recently pointed
out that, due to an underestimating of the distance moved

where C is the core area of home range sizes an x (M) is
the average daily movement. Values for C (C = 6 km2) and
M (M = 1.932 km) were obtained from Grassman et al. [9]
in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctury, Thailand, since there were
no data available on these parameters from Borneo. We
preferred to use the core area instead of the total home
ranges to calculate the size of the area surveyed because
long distances travelled by large cats may increase the total
home range size significantly.
The North-South road forms the boundary separating
Tabin Wildlife Reserve from the adjacent palm oil plantations. A buffer calculated by equation 1 would have overestimated the surveyed area, because it would have
included the nearby plantations which do not constitute
suitable habitat for clouded leopards. Although clouded
leopards were observed entering plantations in Borneo
(Sabah Wildlife Department pers. comm.; pers. obs.), presumably following their prey, they were never seen deeper
than 300 m inside the palm oil plantation (Sabah Wildlife
Department pers. comm.; pers. obs.). Thus it was assumed
that a smaller buffer width of 300 m to the west of this
road transect would be adequate to describe the survey
area.
Data collection
During March and August 2005, eight transects crossing
different habitats were established and each transect was
surveyed 20 times. In addition to two transects along the
gravel road and one along the old logging road towards
the reserve's centre, two transects followed existing jungle
trails and three transects followed streams. The total
length of all transects was approximately 35 km. Every
250 m a GPS coordinate was taken and a digital map
showing all transects was produced using the program
ArcGIS 9.1 (ESRI Inc.)

Our sampling unit was a track set (TS), defined as one or
more contiguous pugmarks from any paw made by the
same clouded leopard. Tracks were photographed with a
digital camera (4 mega pixel) fixed on a monopod perpendicular to the track. An umbrella was used to adjust to
the light conditions. A scale was placed on two sides of the

track to standardize measurements. Only those tracks in
good condition with clear edges and in flat terrain were
included in the analysis to ensure accurate measuring.
GPS coordinates were taken of each track set and later digitized in ArcGIS 9.1 (ESRI Inc.).
Track measurement
To discriminate individual animals, 14 linear and five
area measurements were taken from each track (Fig. 6).
Measurement technique were adopted from a variety previous studies [11-13,52] with the intent to increase the
level of discrimination. The units of linear and area measurements were millimetres with a 1 mm and 1 mm2 level
of precision respectively. Angle measurements, which

proved to have a high level of discrimination in previous
studies [12,52], varied greatly among tracks of a given
individual thus making this tool inadequate for discriminating individuals in our study. All digital track photographs were measured using Adobe Acrobat 7.0
Professional™ (Adobe Systems, Inc.).
Statistical and analytical analysis
For the analysis, it was presumed that we could differentiate between pugmarks made by front and rear feet as well
as by left or right feet. Confusion with pugmarks from
other cat species could be excluded as a possibility,
because no other large cats are present in Borneo. Confusion with tracks of bay cats (Catopuma badia), which might

have tracks sizes similar to small clouded leopards, can be
ruled out because no confirmed observations of bay cats
have been made in Tabin. In order to determine if left and
right tracks could be combined for the analysis to enlarge
the data set, we used a paired t-test to compare the means
of the total width from left and right tracks of each TS. This
was done independently for front and rear tracks. We
tested the other linear and area measurements as well to
determine any differences between the variables. The t-test
could be applied because it could be assumed that the
means have a normal distribution.
To achieve an optimal separation of each TS, a standardized principal component analysis (PCA) was applied.
Principal component (PC) 1 against PC 2 separated individuals better in a scatter plot than two of the original variables did [12]. We excluded the width of the heel pad and
of each toe in our analysis, because the information in
these variables is correlated highly with the length and
area of the heel pads and toes, respectively. The remaining
14 variables were treated as being equally important, having the advantage of coping with linear and area measurements. We favoured the PCA over a discriminant analysis,
which has been applied in similar studies [11,13,52],
because this method does not require that the number of
clouded leopards is known prior to the analysis. The PCA
does not classify data into fixed groups of clouded leop-

ards, because the number of groups was unknown. Rather
it associates each track with another, even if they derive
from the same TS. Tracks from the same TS should cluster
together in space, as will tracks from different TSs made by
the same individual. All data were analyzed using STATISTICA 6 (StatSoft, Inc. 2001).
After matching the tracks to individual clouded leopards
the capture histories for each animal were developed, in a
manner utilized by camera-trapping studies [33,36,5355]. The capture history data were analyzed using the software CAPTURE [29,32,56] developed to implement
closed population capture-recapture models. This program uses a number of different models to generate abundance estimates for a sampled area, based on the number
of individual animals captured and the frequency of
recaptures. The models differ in assumed sources of variation in capture probability, including individual heterogeneity, behavioural response, variation over time and
various combinations of these. CAPTURE uses a discriminant function model selection algorithm to provide an
objective criterion for selecting the best approximating
model. In addition, CAPTURE statistically tests the closure
assumption.
The abundance estimates were then used to estimate the
clouded leopard densities, defined as D = N/A, where N is

animal abundance and A is the effective surveyed area
sampled.
Application of the results on the landscape level
Digital maps of all protected areas within Sabah and the
results of their last faunal survey (2000–2001) provided
by the Sabah Wildlife Department were used for the large
scale analysis. To estimate future prospects of clouded
leopards in various protected areas different variables
were taken into account. Most important for the evaluation were the presence of clouded leopards, the reserve
size, connectivity and classification of the protected areas.
We classified the reserves as a) totally protected reserves
and b) commercial forest reserves, where the commercial
forest reserves are consistent with class 2 of the classification by Sabah Forestry Department. We pooled the classifications of class 5 (mangrove forests) and class 7 (wildlife
reserves) within the designation of class 1 (totally protected areas), because in all of these classes hunting and
selective logging are prohibited, making them subject to
protective conditions. Only areas which were big enough
to hold a minimum population of 50 individuals [57,58]
were included in the analysis since smaller populations of
large cats, such as the Florida panther (Puma concolor
coryi), experienced reduced viability and fecundity caused
by inbreeding [59]. Furthermore, smaller populations are
more susceptible to environmental and demographic stochasticity. Therefore a minimum reserve size was calculated based on our density estimation in TWR. Due to a
lack of detailed data, we assumed densities to be similar
in all protected areas and calculated a rough number of
clouded leopards within each reserve, based on the reserve
sizes and the density obtained from our results in the
TWR.
