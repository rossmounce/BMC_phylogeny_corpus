Abstract
Background: Genetic alterations in human topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) are linked to cancer susceptibility.
TOP2A decatenates chromosomes and thus is necessary for multiple aspects of cell division including DNA
replication, chromosome condensation and segregation. Topoisomerase II alpha is also required for embryonic
development in mammals, as mouse Top2a knockouts result in embryonic lethality as early as the 4-8 cell stage.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the extended developmental capability of zebrafish top2a
mutants arises from maternal expression of top2a or compensation from its top2b paralogue.
Results: Here, we describe bloody minded (blm), a novel mutant of zebrafish top2a. In contrast to mouse Top2a
nulls, zebrafish top2a mutants survive to larval stages (4-5 day post fertilization). Developmental analyses
demonstrate abundant expression of maternal top2a but not top2b. Inhibition or poisoning of maternal
topoisomerase II delays embryonic development by extending the cell cycle M-phase. Zygotic top2a and top2b are
co-expressed in the zebrafish CNS, but endogenous or ectopic top2b RNA appear unable to prevent the blm
phenotype.
Conclusions: We conclude that maternal top2a enables zebrafish development before the mid-zygotic transition
(MZT) and that zebrafish top2a and top2b are not functionally redundant during development after activation of
the zygotic genome.

Background
Topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha (TOP2A) is a nuclear
protein which regulates DNA architecture during the
mitotic phase of the cell cycle [1]. Studies in Xenopus
have shown that its function in chromatin condensation
is tightly coupled to prior DNA replication [2-4]. The
expression of TOP2A is cell cycle regulated, reaching a
peak in the G2/M phase [5]. Thus, up-regulated levels
of TOP2A protein are found in proliferating cancer
cells, and TOP2A is essential for the viability of these
dividing cells. Consistent with its role in cell proliferation, genetic aberrations in TOP2A are linked to numerous human cancers [6]. To facilitate proper separation
of chromatids and DNA replication, TOP2A generates

transient double-stranded breaks in DNA [7-10]. Pharmacological targeting of TOP2A, which is extensively
applied in cancer treatment, exploits this mechanism
[11].
Vertebrate genomes contain two topoisomerases II
paralogues. Human TOP2A and TOP2B have similar
molecular masses (180 and 170 kDa, respectively) and
share ~70% amino acid similarity, with the greatest
divergence occurring in the C-terminal domain [12].
Despite structural similarities, these topoisomerases II
isoforms have different expression patterns and functions [13]. In contrast to the expression of mammalian
Top2a which peaks at G2/M, mammalian Top2b is
expressed in differentiated tissues and its expression is
not cell cycle regulated [14-17]. Several in vitro models
have been utilised to study the loss-of-function effects
associated with topoisomerase II genes. However, the
critical role of Top2a genes for cell proliferation and

survival necessitates conditional knockout models
[18,19]. In vivo, genetic elimination of Top2a is dramatic, with mouse knockouts not developing beyond the
4-8 cell stage [20]. Underlying a distinct role, Top2b
knockouts are not embryonic lethal. Instead Top2b is
required during neuronal differentiation, for survival of
some neural cells and neurite outgrowth [9,21,22].
Top2b null mice have defects in cerebral stratification
and motor axons fail to contact skeletal muscles resulting in death soon after birth due to breathing impairment [23,24]. The topoisomerases II paralogues are also
important as targets of anti-cancer drugs. ICRF-193, a
catalytic inhibitor, blocks topoisomerase II-mediated
ATP hydrolysis which is required to regenerate its active
enzymatic form [25]. Etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison, inhibits the ability of topoisomerase II to re-ligate
DNA molecules and therefore stabilises cleavable complexes of the enzyme leading to extensive fragmentation
of DNA and cell death [26]. Topoisomerase II poisons
are reported to mediate their cytotoxic effects through
TOP2A, while double strand breaks and DNA rearrangements associated with secondary malignancies are due
to TOP2B [27].
Two top2a mutant alleles have previously been documented in zebrafish: hi3635 generated by viral insertion
[28] and can4 by ENU mutagenesis [29]. These mutants
present with similar phenotypes including brain necrosis, abnormal tail curvature and death at 4-5 dpf. The
can4 mutants have been studied more thoroughly and
display reduced cell proliferation, mitotic spindle defects
and increased DNA content. Recently, a zebrafish top2b
mutant was reported with a phenotype distinct to top2a
mutants, including defects in neurite targeting within
the retinal inner plexiform layer and tectal neuropil
[30]. These distinct phenotypes indicate separate functions of the zebrafish Top2a and Top2b isoforms.
Previous studies, however, do not explain the viability
of zebrafish top2a mutants up to larval stages, in contrast to the early embryonic lethality of mouse Top2a
knockouts. One explanation could relate to differential
requirements of teleost and mammalian embryos for the
timing of initiation of zygotic transcription, i.e. transcription from the embryo’s own genome. The mid-blastula transition (MBT) refers to the moment during the
blastula stage of embryonic development when expression of the zygotic genome starts, cell cycles lengthen,
and cells acquire the ability to migrate [31]. The original
term MBT (still used in relation to Xenopus) was
expanded to include a phase of elimination of maternal
transcripts and proteins starting before the activation of
zygotic transcription [32]. This developmental event is
referred as maternal-to-zygotic-transition (MZT) in
recent studies [33]. In zebrafish, zygotic transcription

increases gradually from the 10 th (~2.75 hpf) to 13 th
cycle (~4.75 hpf) [34,35].
Here, we describe a novel zebrafish top2a mutant
named “bloody minded” (blm) which was identified in
an ENU mutagenesis screen. Mutant larvae can survive
to ~5 dpf, although abnormal embryo morphology is
discernable at ~27 hpf. We tested the hypotheses that
the advanced development of zebrafish top2a mutants is
due to either the presence of maternal Top2a or redundancy with the Top2b isoform. Our results are consistent with early embryonic development depending on
maternal transcripts of zebrafish top2a. The absence of
zygotic top2a is not fully compensated for by maternal,
zygotic or ectopic top2b mRNA suggesting distinct functions of Top2a and Top2b in embryonic development.

Results
blm is a lethal recessive zebrafish mutant

During F3 mutagenesis screens we recovered a recessive-lethal mutant named bloody-minded (blm). The blm
phenotype is first visible at ~27 hpf when forebrain and
midbrain atrophy is apparent and occasionally accompanied with CNS haemorrhage (Figure 1A). Increased cell
death is prominent in the blm head, retina and lens at
~27 hpf (Figure 1B). The eyes fail to develop further so
that at 2-3 dpf, blm eyes are significantly smaller than
wildtype siblings and blm lenses protrude from the eye.
At this stage, blm retinae fail to properly laminate and
dying cells are visible. The body axes of blm mutants
curves dorsally, cardiac oedema develops and blm
mutants die at 4-5 dpf.
blm arises from a nonsense mutation in the top2a gene

To determine the genetic locus of the blm mutation we
performed bulk segregant analysis. Linkage to the blm
phenotype was found on chromosome 12 with flanking
Z-markers Z99217 and Z10806 (Figure 2A). Several new
simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were designed to
narrow the critical interval of which zC13B10-SSR1 was
most closely linked (6/96 recombinants). Analyses of the
genetic maps in this interval revealed that a viral insertion mutant hi3635, with gross morphology similar to
blm, co-segregated with the blm interval [28]. As hi3635
arises from an insertion in exon 1 of the gene encoding
topoisomerase IIa (top2a), we chose top2a as a candidate gene for blm. Sequencing of whole larval cDNA
from blm mutants reveals a point mutation (A®T)
which introduces a premature stop codon at Lys residue
335 (K335X) (Figure 2B). The resulting truncated protein lacks the enzymatic domain (Figure 2C).
To confirm that the blm phenotype arises from a
mutation in the top2a gene we performed complementation assays (Figure 2D). Matings of blm carriers and

hi3635 carriers fail to complement. Matings of blm +/with hi3635+/- generated ~30% embryos with the blm
phenotype, whereas outcrosses to wildtype fish did not.
Thus, genomic and genetic data confirm that the blm
mutant results from a nonsense mutation in the zebrafish top2a gene.
top2a mutants exhibit defects in cell cycle progression

Topoisomerase II alpha genes are known to be critical
for cell cycle progression. Therefore, we quantified, by
flow cytometry, the distribution of blm cells within the
major phases of the cell cycle. At 27 hpf, the proportion
of dissociated blm cells in the G2/M phase (~31%) is
approximately double that of wildtype siblings (~16%)
consistent with defects in mitosis (Figure 3A). By immunohistochemistry, the total number of cells in the blm
eye that express the G2/M marker phospho-histone H3
is lower than wildtype siblings (Figure 3B). However,
consistent with the flow cytometry analyses (Figure 3A),
the proportion of cells expressing the G2/M marker,
normalized to the total number of nuclei, is significantly
higher in blm mutants (8.7%) than in wildtype siblings
(5.8%) (Figure 3C). At the transcript level, no significant
difference is observed at 27 hpf for p21-like or ccnb1,
G1 and G2 phase markers respectively, in blm mutants
compared to siblings (Figure 3D). Equivalent levels of
the post-mitotic retinal marker atoh7 were observed in
blm and siblings indicating that retinogenesis had
initiated in blm mutants (Figure 3D). With regards to
cell death, a higher degree of apoptosis was observed in
blm mutants at 24 hpf (Figure 3E). In summary, blm
mutants exhibit an increased proportion of cells in G2/
M phase, consistent with delayed cell cycle progression.
Maternal top2a but not top2b is expressed pre-MZT

The fact that cell cycle progression is occurring in blm
larvae contrasts dramatically with the essential requirement of Top2a for mammalian embryo development
beyond the 4-8 cell stage. Therefore, we hypothesised
that top2a -/- cells can proliferate in zebrafish blm
mutants due to the presence of maternal top2a or functional redundancy with its top2b paralogue. The amino
acid sequences of the zebrafish paralogues are 65% identical with the greatest divergence at the C-terminal end
(Additional file 1). RT-PCR of RNA extracted from pre(8 and 16 cell stages) and post-MZT (4 and 27 hpf)
wildtype embryos demonstrates that maternal top2a
transcript is abundant pre-MZT, whereas top2b transcript is not significantly expressed until after the onset
of zygotic transcription (Figure 4A-B). Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR confirms these results (Figure
4C-D).
Real-time PCR also demonstrates a reduced level of
top2a transcript in blm embryos compared to wildtype

siblings at 1-3 dpf (Figure 4C). Zebrafish top2b transcript is negligible before 4 hpf, but is abundantly
expressed at 10 hpf, a stage after MZT and before blm
phenotypes are detected (Figure 4D). At 27 hpf, top2b
levels are similar in blm mutants and widtype siblings.
In siblings, top2b levels remain high at 2 dpf. In contrast, top2b levels decrease by ~50% in blm mutants by
2 dpf, consistent with the morphological defects
observed at this developmental stage. In summary,
maternal top2a could account for the extended preand/or post-MZT development of blm mutants whereas
zygotic top2b could only account for the extended postMZT development.
No evidence of functional redundancy between top2a
and top2b in vivo

RT-PCR analyses confirm that top2a and top2b are coexpressed in the eye at 2-5 dpf (Figure 5A). Wholemount in-situ hybridisation in 22 hpf wildtype larvae
reveals predominant zygotic expression of top2b in the
forebrain and eyes, organs that display severe morphological abnormalities from 27 hpf in blm mutants (Figure
5B-D). At 3 dpf, top2b is expressed in the forebrain,
midbrain, branchial arches and eyes (Figure 5F-G). TPCR confirms that top2b is expressed in the blm eyes
and body at 3 dpf (Figure 5H). Although the size of the
eyes and head is reduced, the spatial expression of top2b
in blm mutants at 3 dpf is not affected (Figure 5I-L).
Overall, this suggests that top2b has biological potential
to rescue affected tissues in blm mutants but cannot do
so due to functional divergences between the top2a and
top2b paralogues. In agreement, ectopic expression of
top2b mRNA in blm mutants shows no evidence of rescuing the blm phenotype (Figure 5M-N and Additional
file 2). Larvae overexpressing top2b by ~3.8 fold still
exhibit the blm phenotype (Figure 5M). Morphologically, the average eye diameter of blm larvae overexpressing top2b is not significantly different from uninjected
blm larvae (Additional file 2C). Thus, overexpression of
top2b in blm larvae at non-toxic levels shows no evidence of rescuing the blm phenotype. In summary, our
data suggests that top2a and top2b are not functionally
redundant during embryo development.
Chemical inhibition of Top2a delays development of preMZT embryos

To evaluate if maternal topoisomerase II proteins present in zebrafish embryos are required for early development, we chemically inhibited their function. ICRF-193
is a chemical inhibitor of TOP2A and TOP2B. With the
goal of targeting the drug to maternal Top2a, and avoiding effects on zygotic Top2b, 1-2 cell stage embryos
from matings of blm carriers were treated with ICRF193 for ~3.5 hours, the drug removed before MZT and

and wildtype siblings. Presented data are average of 3 replicate experiments, each comprising pools of 16-35 larvae. Error bars represent the

Figure 4 top2a, but not top2b, is expressed pre-MZT. RT-PCR of wt embryos (A-B) and real time PCR of offspring from blm carriers (C-D)
shows that maternal top2a (A, C), but not top2b (B, D), is present pre-MZT at 8- and 16-cell stages. top2a transcript levels decrease in blm
siblings from 27 hpf to 3 dpf, and the expression in blm mutants is always significantly lower (C). The levels of top2b transcript also decrease in
wildtype siblings from 27 hpf to 3 dpf, and although top2b levels in blm mutants and siblings is similar at 27 hpf, top2b is dramatically reduced
in the mutants by 2 dpf (D). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. At 8-cell, 16-cell, 4 hpf and 10 hpf stages mutant and wild type

the embryos allowed to develop to 27 hpf. No discernible morphological defects were observed in ICRF-193
treated embryos compared to controls (Additional file
3). In replicate experiments, the cell cycle profile of treated embryos was analysed at 27 hpf (Figure 6A). Compared to their DMSO-treated controls, transient
inhibition does not dramatically affect the percentage of
sibling- or blm-treated cells in G 0 /G 1 , S, G 2 /M or

polyploid categories (Figure 6B-D). A slight increase in
the subG 0 population of treated embryos is observed.
Thus, transient treatment of pre-MZT embryos with a
topoisomerase inhibitor causes no obvious morphological or cell cycle defects at a later developmental stage.
In an alternative approach (Figure 7A), focusing specifically on earlier cell divisions, zebrafish embryos at the
1-2 cell stage were treated for ~1.5 hours with a

controls (Figure 7B-C). 1 mM ICRF-193 demonstrates a
~26% increase in the numbers of embryos ≤ 16 cell
stage, and up to a ~35% reduction in the number of
embryos > 16 cell stage (Figure 7D). The reduced number of cell divisions in over one quarter of the population is significant, considering the short treatment
duration, the necessity for the drugs to penetrate the
chorion, and the very high concentration of Top2a in
zebrafish embryos (Figure 4), [29]. In summary, we conclude that maternal Top2a is required for the normal
rate of embryonic cell division in developing zebrafish.
Inhibition of Xenopus Top2a results in an extended Mphase in cycling extracts

To further analyze the effect of Top2a inhibition on preMZT cell cycle progression we utilized cycling extracts
prepared from activated Xenopus laevis eggs. These
extracts recapitulate, in vitro, the cell cycle of the intact
fertilized egg, with extracts oscillating between S phase
and mitosis as in pre-MBT embryos [36]. In control
extracts the first mitotic peak of phosphohistone H3
expression was observed after 60 minutes, with a subsequent mitotic peak observed at 90 minutes, thus recapitulating the 30 minute cycling interval observed in
whole embryos (Figure 8A). Addition of ICRF-193 to
extracts at time 0 resulted in a much longer M phase
compared to control extracts (Figure 8A-B). Results
from two different cycling extracts indicate a ~40%
lengthened M phase following topoisomerase II inhibition (Figure 8C). Additionally, there was no evidence of
a subsequent mitotic cycle in the following 50 minutes.
In summary, we conclude that inhibiting maternal
Top2a with ICRF-193 delays early embryonic cell cycle
progression in M phase and may interfere with subsequent S phase entry.

Discussion
Top2a mutagenic susceptibility

Vertebrate topoisomerase II alpha genes appear particularly susceptible to somatic and germline mutations.
Amplifications of the human TOP2A locus is associated
with somatic mutations in subsets of breast, bladder and
gastric cancers [6]. Notably, three genetically-distinct
zebrafish top2a mutant alleles have now been uncovered
(hi3635, can4, blm) in independent mutagenesis screens,
suggesting that the top2a locus is also particularly susceptible to germline DNA perturbations [28,29]. All zebrafish top2a mutants display equivalent gross
morphological phenotypes: small eye and brain, CNS
necrosis, abnormal tail curvature and death at 4-5 dpf.
Although, no further characterisation of the hi3635
insertion mutant has been reported, can4 and blm
top2a -/- alleles display similar cell cycle defects,

Page 11 of 18

including accumulation of mutant cells in G2/M and
altered phosphohistone H3 expression (Figure 3), [29].
The blm phenotype

Our interpretation of the blm mutant phenotype is as
follows (Figure 9). A nonsense mutation in the zebrafish
top2a gene results in the expression of non-functional
Top2a protein post MZT in blm mutants. The lower
RNA expression levels may be due to lower transcription or increased decay of mutant top2a mRNA. The
extensive embryonic and larval development of blm
mutants arises from maternal expression of top2a, and
not top2b which is negligible pre-MZT. Depletion of the
maternal top2a transcript and Top2a protein results in
the morphological phenotype of blm mutants at 27 hpf.
Intracellular levels of top2a/Top2a diminish as daughter
cells divide and as mRNA/protein degrades. For example, after only 10 divisions the level of top2a per daughter cell is expected to deplete by > 1000 fold relative to
DNA content. Thus, tissues that are actively proliferating in later stages of development (e.g. eye) are preferentially affected. In those cells, Top2a depletion would
likely perturb DNA decatenation during replication
resulting in genomic instability and cell cycle checkpoint
activation. The augmented levels of G2/M and apoptotic
cells observed in blm mutants at ~27 hpf are consistent
with activation of the known G2/M decatenation checkpoint present in adult cells leading to apoptosis.
Overall our data lead us to conclusion that zebrafish
Top2a and Top2b are not functionally redundant in
vivo. The zebrafish paralogs are ~65% identical at the
protein level; both containing N-terminal ATP-binding
sites and a central domain tyrosine required for DNA
cleavage and ligation (Additional file 1). Only the Cterminal domains, containing nuclear localization
sequences and phosphorylation sites, are highly divergent [8]. Previous studies in human cell lines suggested
that TOP2B can compensate for depleted TOP2A
[37,38]. In contrast, abundant zebrafish top2b transcript
at stages post-MZT is not sufficient to prevent the blm
phenotype, despite extensive temporal expression in tissues that develop morphological abnormalities in blm
mutants. The onset of the blm phenotype correlates
with depletion of maternal top2a, at a stage when zygotic top2b is abundant, and we identify embryos overexpressing ectopic top2b that retain the blm phenotype.
Furthermore, in contrast to top2a mutants, the recently
described top2b mutant displays a distinct phenotype in
post-mitotic cells and not in proliferating cells [30].
There is a potential compensatory role for maternal
Top2b in pre-MZT stages that we cannot directly
exclude. However, pre-MZT top2b expression is negligible [33] and we have not found evidence of maternal

deposition of Top2b in the literature. Notably, the functional divergence we observe in vivo between zebrafish
Top2a and Top2b is in agreement with other in vitro
studies reporting that the unique cell cycle functions of
the Top2a isoform are dependent on specific C-terminal
sequences [5,12,38]. Overall, our in vivo studies support
that top2a and top2b do not exhibit complete functional
redundancy during zebrafish embryo development.
Role of maternal Top2a pre-MZT

Previous genetic approaches to analyse maternal top2a
function using morpholino knockdowns have proven
unsuccessful, probably because of the abundance of
top2a/Top2a [29]. Therefore, to confirm that maternal
top2a enables pre-MZT development, we pharmacologically targeted maternal Top2a protein using ICRF-193, a
topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor and etoposide, a
topoisomerase II poison [11].
Our data supports the conclusion that maternal top2a
is needed for the normal progression of pre-MZT
embryos through developmental divisions. Both ICRF193 and etoposide delay the progression of embryos
through hierarchical developmental stages. This delay is
reversible as washing out the drug results in the vast
majority of zebrafish embryos proceeding beyond the 24
hpf, segmentation stage. It is likely that we are only

partially inhibiting Top2a protein as complete inhibition
is expected to arrest development earlier.
To explore the mechanism underlying the impaired
developmental cell divisions in ICRF-193 treated
embryos we utilised Xenopus cycling extracts which
recapitulate in vitro the cell cycle of pre-MBT embryos
[36]. Only topoisomerase II a is expressed in Xenopus
eggs and embryos as demonstrated by the fact that
depletion of Top2a from egg extracts abolishes topoisomerase II activity [39]. Our molecular analysis of
Xenopus extracts treated with ICRF-193 indicates a
lengthening of M phase. This is consistent with the previous morphological studies that observed anaphase stalling of pre-MZT zebrafish treated with etoposide [40].
We propose that the mechanism underlying delayed
pre-MZT development and M phase lengthening following Top2 inhibition reflects activation of a cell cycle
decatenation checkpoint. In the pre-MZT embryos lacking gap phases, Top2a inhibition results in a stoichiometric decrease in DNA decatenation during cell
division activating a DNA decatenation checkpoint
[40,41]. The M phase lengthening observed in ICRF-193
treated cycling extracts are consistent with defects in
chromosome condensation and segregation most likely
slowing the cycle and possibly activating a checkpoint in
mitosis.

Sapetto-Rebow et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/71

Inhibition of Top2a could be impacting on one or
more phases of the cell division cycle and its effects in
the simple early embryonic cell cycle and later somatic
cycles where gap phases are present may be the result
of different cell cycle processes being impeded. ICRF193 is known to activate a G2 decatenation checkpoint
in adult cells [42,43]. Interestingly, Top2a, but not
Top2b, is required for activation of the decatenation
checkpoint [43]. Catalytically inhibited Top2a exposes a
C-terminal phospho-serine that recruits MDC1 to chromatin and activates the decatenation checkpoint [42].
As shown by our data, etoposide, which induces DNA
damage in adult cells, phenocopies ICRF-193 in preMZT embryos. The likely explanation is the absence of
Top2b and the absence of a DNA damage checkpoint in
pre-MZT embryos [44]. This also suggests that etoposide alters Top2a topology to activate the decatenation
checkpoint. In summary, we propose that inhibition of
maternal Top2a activates a DNA decatenation checkpoint that delays mitosis and results in delayed embryonic development.

cycle defects in early embryonic cell cycles of both zebrafish and Xenopus, as well as in later somatic cell cycles
where blm mutants show evidence of G2/M decatenation checkpoint activation.

Methods
All animal experiments were conducted under licences
from the Department of Health and Children (B100/
3641; B100/3003) and according to protocols approved
by the University College Dublin Animal Research
Ethics Committee (AREC-P-08-54; AREC-P-10-68).
Mutagenesis

Zebrafish males of AB strain were mutagenised with
ENU and mated to wildtype females to generate F 1
founder fish [47]. F1 founders were mated to wildtype
fish to establish 370 F2 families. F3 offspring of random
incrosses within 200 F2 families were screened for recessive mutations at 5 dpf. 25% of the offspring from family
Y-008 carriers presented with blm phenotypes.

Phenotypic differences between mouse and zebrafish
Top2a mutants

Why does maternal Top2a enable zebrafish top2a -/mutants to progress to stages comprising of hundreds of
thousands of cells, whilst mouse Top2a-/- knockouts fail
to divide beyond the 4-8 cell stage? One possibility is
that maternal Top2a is not expressed in mammalian
embryos. This is not the case, as studies show that catalytically active Top2a is functional at the 1-cell stage in
mouse embryos [45]. Alternatively, maternal topoisomerase II alpha may have differential stability in mice and
zebrafish due to the timing of MZT which occurs
between embryonic day 0.5 and 1.5 (2-cell stage) in
mouse but between 2.75 and 4.75 hours after fertilization (from 1,024 cells stage) in zebrafish [34,35,46].
Although some maternal transcripts are still present in
embryonic day 2.5 murine morulas [46], previous
reports demonstrate that newly synthesised mouse
Top2a at the 2-cell stage is essential for cell cycle progression [45].

Conclusions
The ability of zebrafish top2a -/- mutants to proceed
through thousands of developmental cell divisions
starkly contrasts with mammalian Top2a-/- knockouts
which fail to divide beyond the 4-8 cell stage [20]. Our
analyses reveal that pre-MZT, maternal top2a is sufficient to enable zebrafish top2a-/- mutants to progress
through early development. Post-MZT, zebrafish top2b
expression is insufficient to fully compensate for the
absence of top2a in vivo and blm mutants die at ~5 dpf
(Figure 9). Top2a inhibition or loss results in clear cell

Larvae at 27 hpf, 2 dpf and 3 dpf were euthanized with
benzocaine and fixed in Sorensen phosphate buffer (pH
7.3) containing 4% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Larvae
were embedded in Epon resin and semi-thin (900 nm)
sections stained with toluidine blue were photographed
using a Leica DMLB microscope and a Leica DFC 480
camera.
Mapping

Carriers of blm (AB strain) mutants were map-crossed
to wildtype Tubingen fish to generate hybrid carriers
AB*/Tub. 96 blm and 96 normal siblings from map
crosses were used for bulk segregation analysis. Linkage
was found to chromosome 12 with the blm mutation
flanked by Z-markers Z99217 and Z10806. Several new
simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were designed to
further narrow the critical interval of which zC13B10SSR1 was the closest (6/96 recombinants). Primers
zC13B10-SSR1-F: CTCCAATCGAGAGTCCTCGT,
zC13B10-SSR1-R: AGCTGAAGGCCTGCTGTAAA.
The top2a gene was localised in the critical interval.
Sequencing

RNA from 3 dpf blm larvae was extracted using the
Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and cDNA was synthesised
using the Invitrogen Superscript III First Strand Synthesis for RT-PCR system. Six sets of primers were
designed to amplify the whole reading frame of zebrafish
top2a. The causative point mutation was sequenced
using
the
following
primers:
forward
5’TGTTGCGCTACTGACTCGAC, reverse 5’TGGCC
AGTTATGATGGATGA.

Complementation assay

Hi3635 carriers were obtained from ZIRC. Complementation matings of blm+/- ♀ × hi3635+/- ♂ and blm+/- ♂
× hi3635 +/- ♀ were performed. Phenotypes were
recorded at 2 and 3 dpf.
Flow cytometry

blm and wildtype sibling larvae were collected at 27 hpf.
Embryos were dechorionated, rinsed in PBS and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C in trypsin (1 mg/ml) with
DNase I (1 U/200 μl) followed by mechanical disruption
with a 25 G needle. Trypsin inhibitor was added to a
final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After centrifugation, the
cell pellet was fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were rinsed
with PBS, treated with RNase (10 μg/ml) and DNA
stained with propidium iodide (40 μg/ml). DNA content
was analysed using a Coulter EPICS XL-MCL or Accuri
C6 flow cytometer.
Quantification of mitotic cells in the eye

Embryos at 27 hpf were fixed at 4°C overnight in 4%
PFA, then dechorionated, dehydrated in methanol and
stored at -20°C. Prior to immunostaining embryos were
rehydrated in PBS, permeabilised for 5 min in proteinase
K (20 μg/ml) and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min. Larvae were treated with blocking solution (2% normal goat
serum, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween-20 in PBS) for 60
min followed by incubation in the primary antibody:
anti-phospho-histone H3 at 1:200 dilution (Upstate Biotech) for 20 hours. Primary antibody binding was
detected with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (dilution 1:200). Nuclei were counter stained
with DAPI. Z-stack images of whole larval eyes (optical
sections at 2 μm interval) were taken with Zeiss LMS
510 Meta laser confocal microscope (with 63 × objective). Images were analysed with Imaris v7.2.3 software.
To quantify the proportion of mitotic cells, embryos at
27 hpf were fixed in PFA, cryoprotected and sectioned
(12 μm thickness). Mitotic nuclei were labelled with
anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotech)
and counter stained with DAPI. Images of sections
through the eyes, head and spinal cord (at least 3 per
animal) were taken with Zeiss AxioImager M1 microscope (objective 100×) and all PH3 positive and DAPI
labelled nuclei from the field (89.5 μm × 67.1 μm) were
counted. The percentage of mitotic cells in 5 mutant
and 5 wild type larvae was compared.
Acridine orange staining

To visualise apoptotic cells at 24 hpf, dechorinated wildtype and blm larvae were incubated with 5 μg/ml acridine orange (Sigma) for 30 minutes and washed in
embryo medium. Larvae were anaesthetised with tricaine

Page 15 of 18

and imaged with an Olympus SZX2-ILLT microscope
using fluorescence lamp and GFP filter.
RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit
from pools (15 to 70 individuals) of 8-cell, 16-cell, 4 hpf,
10 hpf, 27 hpf, 2 dpf and 3 dpf embryos or dissected
eyes and rest of the body of 2, 3, 4 and 5 dpf larvae
obtained from wildtype incrosses or blm carrier
incrosses. cDNA was synthesised by reverse transcription after priming with random hexamers using the
Invitrogen Superscript III system. Primers’ sequences for
cell cycle markers [41]: p21-likeF-CCGTAGACCATGAGGAGC; p21-likeR-GTCTCGTCCACTTCTTTCT
TTC; ccnb1F-GAGTCACAGCAATAAACCAC; ccnb1RAGGAAGGCTCAGACACAAC. Primers’ sequences for
top2a, top2b and bactin: top2aF-AACGAGACCATGCCTCACC; top2aR-CAAACCAGCCTCTTTCTT
CG; top2bF-GCAGTTGGAGGAAACTCTGC; top2bRAGCTTCACAGCCGCATCTAT;
bactF-GAGAAGATCTGGCATCACAC; bactR-ATCAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTC. Primers’ sequences for atoh7 (ath5): atoh7FCCGGAGAAGTTTGAGAGTGC and atoh7R- GCTCAGAGCCATCTGTAGGG. Real-Time PCR was performed with SYBR-Green chemistry. 18s rRNA
amplification with TaqMan probe served as an internal
reference. For the time course experiment an arbitrary
value of 1 was assigned to the average expression at 8
cell stage and expression level at other time points was
normalised to this denominator. Plots of quantitative
RT-PCR are average from 2 or 3 replicas and error bars
represent standard error of the mean.
Wholemount in situ hybridization

Full length top2b cDNA was amplified with AccuPrime
Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using forward and reverse
primers binding to 5’UTR and 3’UTR (5UTRzfTop2bTCTGGCCACACACAATAGAAA, 3UTRzfTop2b- CCA
ATCAGTTTTCTGGACCAA) and cDNA (made with
random hexamers from total RNA of 1 dpf old larvae)
as template. It was cloned into pGEM vector and used
for synthesis of antisense and sense digoxigenin labelled
probes with DIG in vitro transcription kit (Roche).
Larvae were fixed in 4% PFA (overnight at 4°C). 3 dpf
specimens were treated for 20 mins with a bleach solution (30% H 2 O 2 , 50% formamide, 20% 20× SSC) to
remove pigmentation and permeabilised with proteinase
K (10 μg/ml, 22 minutes). Probe hybridisation was carried out at 62.5°C (overnight), followed by a series of
formamide/SSC washes at the same temperature. Detection of hybridised probe was performed by incubation
(overnight at 4°C) with AP-conjugated anti-digoxigenin
Fab fragments (1:5,000; Roche) followed by colorimetric

detection (NBT/BCIP, Roche). Whole larvae were
imaged under 100% glycerol using an Olympus SZX2ILLT stereo zoom microscope. 30 μm sections of
stained larvae embedded in Tissue Tek (Sakura) were
imaged using Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope equipped
with AxioCam HRc camera.
Overexpression of top2b

The top2b coding region was amplified from cDNA of 1
dpf larvae using AccuPrime Taq polymerase (Invitrogen)
and cloned into pGEM vector. This plasmid was used to
synthesise full length top2b mRNA with the mMessage
mMachine SP6 system (Albion Inc.). Offspring of blm
carriers were microinjected at 1-2 cell stages with zebrafish top2b mRNA at 250 ng/μl (approximately 75 pg per
embryo). Phenotypes were recorded at 33 hpf and eye
diameter was measured with Cell F software (Olympus
Soft Imaging Solutions) after imaging with an Olympus
SZX2-ILLT stereo zoom microscope. To verify overexpression of top2b, pools of embryos presenting with
wildtype, blm or malformed phenotypes were collected
at 33 hpf for RNA extraction. Q-RT-PCR was performed
as described above (using primers top2bF-GCAGTTGGAGGAAACTCTGC
and
top2bR-AGCTTCACAGCCGCATCTAT). Expression of top2b mRNA in all
samples was normalised to the expression level in uninjected wildtype controls.
Drug treatment

For transient treatment freshly laid eggs from blm carrier incrosses were incubated in embryo medium containing 100 μM ICRF-193 (Sigma) or 1% DMSO for 3.5
hours at 28°C and then the drug was replaced by fresh
embryo medium. At 27 hpf larvae with mutant and
wildtype phenotypes were separated and used for cell
cycle analysis by flow cytometry.
For pre-MZT treatment, freshly laid wildtype AB eggs
were placed in multi-well plates. Excess embryo medium
was removed and replaced by a drug solution. Drugs
were diluted in 1% DMSO in embryo medium at final
concentrations of: 1 μM, 100 μM and 1 mM of ICRF193 (Sigma) and 10 μM, 100 μM and 200 μM of etoposide (Ebewe). Embryos were incubated with drug for
~1.5 hours and then fixed with 4% PFA. Control
embryos were incubated in 1% DMSO. The percentage
of embryos reaching each development stage was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chisquared test in GraphPad Prism.
Cell cycle extracts

Cycling extracts were prepared from unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs activated using calcium ionophore
A23187 (Sigma; C7522), as described in [36]. Extracts
were treated with 20 μM ICRF-193 diluted in 1%

Page 16 of 18

DMSO or 1% DMSO alone at time zero. Samples were
collected at 10 minute intervals and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen.
Western blotting

Protein samples were separated according to their
apparent molecular mass under denaturing conditions
on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, 1.0 mm × 17 well gels
(Invitrogen), and transferred to PVDF membrane. After
blocking in 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated with either
anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) antibody from Millipore to detect mitosis (Cat. # 06-570) or GAPDH antibody from Cell Signaling (#3900), followed by
incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using
Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce; #32106). Densitometry was performed
using the ImageJ program http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/.
