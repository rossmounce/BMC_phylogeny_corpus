Abstract
Background: Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is responsible of systemic diseases in kids and
genital diseases leading to abortions in goats. CpHV-1 is widespread and especially in
Mediterranean countries as Greece, Italy and Spain. CpHV-1 is antigenically and genetically closely
related to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). Taking into account the biological properties shared by
these two viruses, we decided in the current study to assess the protection of a live attenuated
glycoprotein E (gE) negative BoHV-1 vaccine against a genital CpHV-1 infection in goats.
Results: The vaccine was inoculated intranasally twice three weeks apart followed by a subsequent
CpHV-1 intravaginal challenge which is the natural route of infection in three goats. To analyse the
safety and the efficacy of this marker vaccine, two groups of three goats served as controls: one
immunised with a virulent CpHV-1 and one uninoculated until the challenge. Goats were clinically
monitored and all sampling procedures were carried out in a blind manner. The vaccine did not
induce any undesirable local or systemic reaction and goats did not excrete gE-negative BoHV-1.
After challenge, a significant reduction in disease severity was observed in immunised goats.
Moreover, goats immunised with either gE-negative BoHV-1 or CpHV-1 exhibited a significant
reduction in the length and the peak of viral excretion. Antibodies neutralising both BoHV-1 and
CpHV-1 were raised in immunised goats.
Conclusion: Intranasal application of a live attenuated gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine is able to afford
a clinical protection and a reduction of virus excretion in goats challenged by a CpHV-1 genital
infection.

Background
The subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae includes a cluster of
closely related ruminant viruses with bovine herpesvirus 1
(BoHV-1) as prototype [1]. BoHV-1, a major cattle pathogen, is typically responsible of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) causing severe economic losses in livestock
[2]. Since its isolation, several conventional vaccines have
been developed. These vaccines usually prevented clinical
signs and reduced the amount of excreted viruses. However, there was still a need for improvements in order to
use them in control and/or eradication programmes [3].
Therefore, BoHV-1 marker vaccines comprising attenuated or killed mutants with a deletion in one of the nonessential genes (gE) were developed and eradication campaigns were initiated in many European countries. They
have proven their safety and efficacy in the target bovine
species since they are efficacious at reducing disease severity, virus shedding, and circulation in a population [4,5].
Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is associated with two
different syndromes in goats, a lethal systemic disease in
kids [6,7] and a genital disease leading to balanoposthitis
[8], vulvovaginitis [9] and abortion [10] in adults. These
clinical signs and the virus presence in nasal, ocular, rectal
and vaginal samples suggest both the venereal transmission as the principal virus entry route and infection persistence within herds [11,12]. The genital tropism of
CpHV-1 was confirmed by the detection of viral DNA in
sacral ganglia of latently infected goats [13]. According to
serological investigations, the infection occurs worldwide
with highest prevalences observed in Mediterranean
countries [14-20]. However, the economical losses due to
CpHV-1 infection are probably underestimated. To date, a
classical inactivated vaccine has been developed [21,22],
however, it can not be licensed since the market of veterinary medicinal products for minor species, like goats, is
not economically profitable. Consequently, the control of
this infection still relies on hygienic prophylactic measures [1].
BoHV-1 and CpHV-1 are antigenically and genetically
closely related [1]. This relationship was originally demonstrated by serological assays [15,23-25] and lately by
phylogenetic analysis [26-28]. These viruses are able to
some extent to cross the species barrier and establish
infection in heterologous animal species [29,30]. Experimental reactivation of latent infection of BoHV-1 in goats
was successfully performed [31]. Moreover, a recent experiment showed that intranasal administration of a live
attenuated gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine in goats reduced
the peak viral titre after a nasal CpHV-1 challenge and
therefore afforded a partial cross-protection [32].
In the following study, it is hypothesised that an intranasal administration (of a bovine vaccine) could afford a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/33

protection against the clinical genital infection. Indeed,
for many years, the upper respiratory mucosa has been
proven to be suitable for vaccine delivery. The recent
advances in the study of the mucosal immune system
strengthen this mode of administration as being a very
effective route for vaccination for both peripheral and
mucosal immunity [33]. In human, nasal mucosa can
serve as an efficient site for the induction of specific IgA
and IgG responses in vaginal secretions [34,35]. The goat
genital tract might employ similar homing mechanisms as
those of the upper respiratory tract and therefore could
receive primed immune cells from the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) [36]. Therefore, it was
decided to investigate gE-negative BoHV-1 intranasal
route of vaccination in goats with the aim to protect this
species against CpHV-1 genital infection.

Results
Clinical and viral responses after intranasal immunisation
Goats immunised by intranasal inoculation with virulent
CpHV-1 or gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine remained in good
general state of health. No signs of severe disease as anorexia, depression, oedema or lesions were observed. The
gE-negative BoHV-1 immunisation did not induce any
undesirable local or systemic reaction and goats did not
show any clinical sign of disease. On the opposite, goats
inoculated with CpHV-1 expressed mild clinical signs as
hyperemia and nasal discharge. Based on the mean rectal
temperature, the statistical analysis revealed significant
differences between groups (p < 0.005). From day 3 after
immunisation, the mean temperatures of CpHV-1 inoculated goats were higher than the temperature of gE-negative BoHV-1 immunised goats (p < 0.001) (data not
shown).

Following the first immunisation (day 0), only CpHV-1
was excreted by goats (Fig. 1). CpHV-1 was isolated in cell
culture and was detected by PCR in nasal swabs but was
not recovered from vaginal swabs and buffy coats. The
peak viral titre was 106.6 TCID50 per 50 μl of nasal secretions. After the second immunisation (day 21), both samples from gE-negative BoHV-1 and from CpHV-1 infected
goats were consistently negative by isolation in cell culture and detection by PCR.
Viral excretion after CpHV-1 intravaginal challenge
Three weeks after the second immunisation, control and
immunised goats were intravaginally challenged with the
virulent CpHV-1 Ba-1 strain (Fig. 2). The mean CpHV-1
titres in vaginal swabs were significantly different (p <
0.0001) between groups immunised with either gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine or virulent CpHV-1 and the nonimmunised group. The lowest excretion titres were
obtained in the CpHV-1 immunised group compared to
gE-negative BoHV-1 immunised or non-immunised

groups (p < 0.0001). The immunisation with gE-negative
BoHV-1 vaccine decreased the mean challenge virus excretion titres: 1.42 log on day 2, 1.75 log on day 3, 1.5 log on
day 6, 1.66 log on day 7, 2.75 on day 8, except on days 4,
5 and 9 after challenge where the mean excretion titres,
although not significantly different, were lower than the
mean excretion titres obtained on the same day in nonimmunised goats. Furthermore, the gE-negative BoHV-1
vaccine shortened the challenge strain shedding. While no
viral shedding was detected on day 12 in non-immunised
group, goats from the gE-negative BoHV-1 immunised
group excreted the challenge CpHV-1 during a significantly shorter time period. The shortest virus shedding, up
to day 1 after challenge, was detected in the CpHV-1
immunised group (Fig. 2).
On days 1 and 4 after challenge, viruses from one goat in
each group were further propagated individually and
characterised using restriction enzyme analysis. The BstEII
profiles confirmed that viruses excreted after challenge by
goats immunised with gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine were

Clinical protection against CpHV-1 intravaginal challenge
Groups intranasally immunised with either virulent
CpHV-1 or gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccines were protected
against the clinical form of the genital CpHV-1 infection

(Fig. 3). Consequently, the clinical score of each group
was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than in the nonimmunised group. The statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the gE-negative BoHV-1
immunised and the CpHV-1 immunised groups (p =
0.06) except at days 5 and 6 after challenge. At these days,
goats immunised with gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine
showed mild oedema or vulva hyperemia.
The mean rectal temperature of immunised groups was
significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than those of the nonimmunised group except at the challenge peak (days 3
and 5 after challenge). Additionally, the group immunised by inoculation with virulent CpHV-1 exhibited a
significant lower temperature (p < 0.0001) than the gEnegative BoHV-1 vaccine immunised group. Overall,
goats did not show any sign of hyperthermia (data not
shown).
Immune responses after immunisation and challenge
In goats immunised with either virulent CpHV-1 or gEnegative BoHV-1 vaccine, CpHV-1 neutralising antibodies
were observed from day 14 after the first immunisation
(Fig. 4). No significant difference between groups was
noticed. After the second immunisation, a sharp increase
in CpHV-1 neutralising antibody titres was observed in
the CpHV-1 immunised group. In contrast, goats immu-

nised with gE-negative BoHV-1 did not show any boost of
the primary immune response (Fig. 4). Following the
CpHV-1 intravaginal challenge, the mean CpHV-1 neutralising antibody titres were significantly different (p <
0.0001) between groups immunised with gE-negative
BoHV-1 or CpHV-1 and the non-immunised group. Interestingly, goats immunised with gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine showed an increase in CpHV-1 neutralising
antibodies, but their neutralising titres were much lower
than that of CpHV-1 immunised goats (Fig. 4). Neutralising antibody titres were lower against BoHV-1 than
CpHV-1 in all groups (data not shown). Moreover, all animals remained negative with the BoHV-1 gE blocking
ELISA.

Discussion

cells (ASCs) in the genital tract have been demonstrated
after nasal vaccination in mice [37,38]. In another study,
it has been shown that T lymphocyte homing to the genital mucosa requires the interaction of integrins αLβ2 and
α4β1 with endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1
and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), respectively [39,40]. Since both nasal and genital mucosa
express VCAM-1, this adressin could be involved in the
homing of specific ASCs to the genital tract. Moreover,
chemokine like CC chemokine ligand 28, which is
expressed in both tissues, could interact with the chemokine receptor 10 expressed on nasal ASCs and be involved
too in the homing of specific ASCs to the genital area
[41,42]. Although the underlying mechanism was not
investigated in this study, it can be speculated that such
pathways could be involved in the current protection.

Taking advantage of the susceptibility of goats to BoHV-1
[32], the efficacy of a live attenuated gE-negative BoHV-1
vaccine was assessed in goats after two intranasal administrations followed by a subsequent CpHV-1 intravaginal
challenge. The intranasal use of a gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine enabled a cross-protection against CpHV-1 genital
infection which is the natural route of infection in goats.
As observed in human, nasal mucosa can serve as an efficient site for the induction of a specific protective
response in the genital tract. It could be a consequence of
the induction of specific IgA and IgG responses in vaginal
secretions. The presence of specific antibody secreting

Following the first immunisation, the safety of the gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine in goats was evidenced by the
absence of side effects and local or systemic reactions.
Interestingly, goats did not excrete gE-negative BoHV-1
although a low level of BoHV-1 excretion was observed
previously [32]. A weaker replication of gE-negative
BoHV-1 could account for this result. Nevertheless, the
presence of neutralising antibodies against BoHV-1 after
the first and second immunisations suggests the replication of gE-negative BoHV-1 in goats. It can be hypothesised that the first immunisation induced a strong

mucosal immunity leading to the neutralisation of newly
replicated viruses after the second immunisation. The
absence of detection of anti-gE antibodies in BoHV-1 gE
blocking ELISA is consistent with the deletion of the gene
encoding gE in the BoHV-1 vaccine. Moreover, such negative results in goats inoculated with CpHV-1 suggest a difference in the antigenicity of gE between BoHV-1 and
CpHV-1.
Another issue to consider is the possible establishment of
gE-negative BoHV-1 in a latent state in vaccinated goats.
Indeed, BoHV-1 is able to establish latency in goats but
with a poor reactivation success rate [30,31]. However, gEnegative BoHV-1 is less effective in reactivation and reexcretion than wild type viruses in calves [4,43]. Therefore,
the risk of reactivation and reexcretion of a gE-negative
BoHV-1 in goats is low. On the other hand, the vaccination could also lead to the emergence of new recombinant
viruses. Indeed, despite the fact that in the subfamily
Alphaherpesvirinae, viruses of different species show very
few sequence similarities to allow homologous recombination, several interspecific recombinants were isolated in
vitro [44]. Natural recombinants between equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 were, for example, recently identified [45].
Therefore, the question of recombinants rising from crossinfection of CpHV-1 infected goats with BoHV-1 needs to
be considered. Among the cluster of ruminant alphaherpesviruses related to BoHV-1, only two recombinant
viruses between BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 were isolated, and
no recombinant between BoHV-1 and less closely related
CpHV-1 and CvHV-2 was detected in vitro [46]. Consequently, in regards of these data and especially the low
level of excretion, the vaccination described here is likely
to be completely safe.
The reduction of the clinical score was considered as the
most relevant parameter showing the efficacy of nasal
immunisation against CpHV-1. Goats immunised intranasally with gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine were clinically
protected. Moreover, the difference between goats immunised with either gE-negative BoHV-1 or CpHV-1 was not
statistically significant. The gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine
was not only effective in preventing development of genital disease upon challenge, but also in significantly reducing the magnitude and the duration of challenge CpHV-1
excretion. A high protection against clinical signs was also
observed after immunisation by intranasal infection with
CpHV-1. However, in natural conditions, the same kind
of protection is not likely to be reached because the main
route of transmission is venereal instead of respiratory
[11,12]. The current CpHV-1 vaginal challenge used in
this assay was even more severe than in previous experiments [47,48] and this result brings a reliable validation
of the current study. The significant differences observed
between immunised and non-immunised groups have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/33

been obtained with a relatively low number of animals,
therefore despite a lower power of the statistical test.
These data allowed the identification of a significant effect
of vaccination with the live attenuated gE-negative BoHV1 vaccine [49]. Moreover, nasal vaccination is an interesting alternative for inducing specific antibody responses in
female genital tract, both for convenience and because the
outcome of vaginal vaccination might be dependent on
the time point in the oestral cycle for vaccine administration [35].
Concerning infection control, such vaccination could
bring several advantages. Indeed, the existence of antigenic cross-reactions between ruminant alphaherpesviruses related to BoHV-1 and their ability to cross the
species barrier raise theoretical problems for the differential diagnosis and the detection of any other virus reservoir, both in regions and countries where BoHV-1
infection has been eradicated and in those where the control of IBR is currently or will be undertaken [2]. The use
of such vaccination could reduce the circulation of CpHV1 in goats which would be therefore less involved in
BoHV-1 misdiagnosis due to infection with a closely
related alphaherpesvirus. Moreover, the development of
new vaccines in order to protect minor species against
infection causing economical and management problems
meets a poor interest from the pharmaceutical industry. In
this context, a classical inactivated vaccine inducing a
good protection against CpHV-1 infection in goats was
developed but was not licensed [21,22]. Consequently, it
was required to investigate the capacity of an already
licensed bovine vaccine to induce a cross-protection
against a related virus infection in goats according to the
principle of the cascade. The European Union has recently
pointed out the requirements of medicinal veterinary
products for minor uses and minor species, as goats for
example [50]. The results obtained in this study clearly
show that a bovine vaccine can be safely and efficiently
used in goats.

Conclusion
Regarding the issue of ruminant alphaherpesvirus diagnosis, the economical constraints of the veterinary pharmaceutical industry and the well-being of animals, this study
brings an expected tool for the CpHV-1 induced disease
prevention. Indeed, the intranasal administration of a live
attenuated gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine protects goats
clinically and virologically against CpHV-1 genital infection which is the natural route of infection in goats. In
addition, the current study emphasises the interest of
studying intranasal vaccination approaches against genitally transmitted infections through the mucosal immune
system.

Methods
Cells and viruses
The Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line (ATCC
CCL22) was maintained in Dulbecco-Minimal Essential
Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 10% of foetal
bovine serum (FBS). The challenge CpHV-1 Ba-1 strain
[51] was produced by infection of MDBK cells in D-MEM
supplemented with 10% of FBS. At 72 h after infection,
culture medium was removed and clarified by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were divided
into aliquots, frozen at -80°C and titrated by tissue culture
infectious dose 50 (TCID50) method on MDBK cells. The
gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine virus strain used for immunisation is the commercial vaccine Rispoval® IBR-marker
vivum (Pfizer Animal Health). The BoHV-1 Iowa [52] and
the CpHV-1 Ba-1 strains were used for serum neutralisation assays.
Experimental design
Nine dairy Alpine, Ionica, Maltese and Saanen crossbred
goats, approximately 4–5 years of age, were used. All goats
were originated from a CpHV-1 seronegative flock in Italy.
Prior to inoculation, absence of antibodies against BoHV1 and CpHV-1 was confirmed by serum neutralisation
assay. The goats were randomly divided in three groups of
three goats. Each group was separated in different airspaces. Two groups were immunised intranasally by aerosolization twice three weeks apart as follows: group 1
received 2 ml per nostril of virulent CpHV-1 Ba-1 at a dose
of 105.25 TCID50/50 μl, and group 2 received 2 ml per nostril of gE-negative BoHV-1 vaccine at a dose of 104.25
TCID50/50 μl. Group 3 served as negative control and was
kept uninoculated before challenge. On day 42, all goats
were challenged by the intravaginal route with 4 ml of virulent CpHV-1 Ba-1 (106.25 TCID50/50 μl). All precautions
were taken to avoid viral spread. Clothes and boots were
changed before entering any stable. For handling, new
gloves were used between groups. Clinical monitoring
and all sampling procedures were carried out in a blind
manner. Goats were clinically examined daily from day -1
(before infection) up to day 21 following the challenge
and rectal temperatures were also measured up to day 16
post-challenge. Clinical observations were carried out at
approximately the same time everyday and by the same
scientist throughout the study. Clinical monitoring
included the following clinical signs: depression, anorexia, vaginal haemorrhage, vaginal discharge, pain,
hyperemia of vulva and vagina, oedema of vulva and
vagina, number of lesions in vulva and vagina. A clinical
score from 0 to 2 was given for each clinical parameter
except temperature. Scores quantifying the oedema of
vulva and vagina were multiplied by 2. Scores quantifying
the number of lesions in vulva and vagina were multiplied
by 3. Blood samples for serology were collected from the
jugular vein of animals weekly during the whole experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/33

ment at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63 after
the primary immunisation. Serums obtained after centrifugation were stored at -20°C until analysis. Heparinised
blood samples for buffy coat extraction, nasal and vaginal
swabs were collected daily up to day 14 after first immunisation, up to day 14 after second immunisation, and
during 14 days post-challenge, using one swab per animal, swabbing deeply into each nostril or vagina. The
experiment was carried out following national and international guide for the care and use of experimental animals.
Viral characterisation
Samples were immersed in 1 ml of D-MEM and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then
treated with a 10% antibiotics mixture (5,000 UI/ml penicillin, 2,500 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml amphotericin) for 30 min at room temperature and titrated by the
TCID50 method on MDBK cells cultured in 96-well microtitre plates. The excess of samples was stored frozen at 80°C. Cells were examined daily for cytopathic effect
(CPE). The virus titre was expressed as TCID50 per 50 μl of
secretion. Buffy coats were separated from blood by centrifugation in presence of lympholyte (Cedarlane, Canada). Sample preparation and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) were performed as previously described with minor
modifications [13,53]. Viral DNA were prepared from
supernatants of MDBK cell cultures infected with viruses
isolated on days 1 and 4 after challenge [16]. Two μg of
DNA were submitted to BstEII restriction analysis (New
England Biolabs) and DNA fragments were separated in a
0.7% Tris Acetate EDTA gel for 22 h at 30 V/cm and 500
mA.
Serological analysis
Serial twofold dilutions of each serum were mixed with
either 100 TICD50 of BoHV-1 Iowa strain or 100 TICD50 of
CpHV-1 Ba-1 strain in 96-well microtitre plates. The plates
were held for 90 min at room temperature and 20,000
MDBK cells were then added to each well. Analysis was
done after three days of incubation at 37°C in presence of
5% CO2. The titre of each serum was expressed as the
highest serum dilution which neutralised the virus in 50%
of the wells [43]. The BoHV-1 gE blocking ELISA (Herdchek Anti-IBR gE, Idexx, Germany) was used following the
manufacturer instructions. Serums were analysed in
duplicate.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons in the clinical, virological and
serological data were performed in the form of mixed
models for repeated measurements by SAS procedure
(procedure MIXED) [54].
