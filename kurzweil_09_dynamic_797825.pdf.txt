Abstract
Background: The mammalian vomeronasal organ (VNO) expresses two G-protein coupled
receptor gene families that mediate pheromone responses, the V1R and V2R receptor genes. In
rodents, there are ~150 V1R genes comprising 12 subfamilies organized in gene clusters at multiple
chromosomal locations. Previously, we showed that several of these subfamilies had been
extensively modulated by gene duplications, deletions, and gene conversions around the time of
the evolutionary split of the mouse and rat lineages, consistent with the hypothesis that V1R
repertoires might be involved in reinforcing speciation events. Here, we generated genome
sequence for one large cluster containing two V1R subfamilies in Mus spretus, a closely related and
sympatric species to Mus musculus, and investigated evolutionary change in these repertoires along
the two mouse lineages.
Results: We describe a comparison of spretus and musculus with respect to genome organization
and synteny, as well as V1R gene content and phylogeny, with reference to previous observations
made between mouse and rat. Unlike the mouse-rat comparisons, synteny seems to be largely
conserved between the two mouse species. Disruption of local synteny is generally associated with
differences in repeat content, although these differences appear to arise more from deletion than
new integrations. Even though unambiguous V1R orthology is evident, we observe dynamic
modulation of the functional repertoires, with two of seven V1Rb and one of eleven V1Ra genes
lost in spretus, two V1Ra genes becoming pseudogenes in musculus, two additional orthologous
pairs apparently subject to strong adaptive selection, and another divergent orthologous pair that
apparently was subjected to gene conversion.
Conclusion: Therefore, eight of the 18 (~44%) presumptive V1Ra/V1Rb genes in the musculusspretus ancestor appear to have undergone functional modulation since these two species
diverged. As compared to the rat-mouse split, where modulation is evident by independent
expansions of these two V1R subfamilies, divergence between musculus and spretus has arisen
more by mutations within coding sequences. These results support the hypothesis that adaptive
changes in functional V1R repertoires contribute to the delineation of very closely related species.

Background
Pheromones are secreted chemicals recognized by members of the same species (conspecifics) that convey information about individual members. The vomeronasal
organ (VNO) of terrestrial vertebrates is responsible for
pheromonal responses that evoke social and reproductive
behaviors, including male territorial aggression, sexual
preference, and sexual maturity (reviewed in [1]). These
responses are thought to be mediated by at least two unrelated gene families, referred to as V1Rs [2] and V2Rs [3-5],
encoding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are
expressed on surfaces of sensory neurons in the VNO.
In addition to being the principle chemoreceptors in the
olfactory and gustatory sensory systems, the large GPCR
superfamily has prominent roles in transducing signals
for diverse ligands, including ions, hormones, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and photons [6]. The GPCR repertoire has a common seven transmembrane structure, and
mammalian GPCR proteins are classified into six major
families: the peptide-binding secretin types, the adhesion
types that contain N-terminal domains with motifs implicated in cell adhesion functions (e.g., EGF-like repeats),
the glutamate types (including TAS1 taste receptors and
the V2Rs expressed in the VNO), the frizzled types, the
Taste2 types (TAS2 taste receptors), and the large set of
rhodopsin types (including the olfactory receptors) [6].
V1Rs share a distant relationship with the Taste2- and rhodopsin-types of GPCRs that bind ligands within transmembrane cavities (and that lack the large N-terminal
binding domains characteristic of other GPCRs).
V1R gene repertoires vary significantly among species. In
mouse and rat, there are a total of approximately 150 V1R
genes from 12 phylogenetically distinct subfamilies [7,8];
members of each subfamily tend to be clustered at one or
two chromosomal locations, reflective of a recent history
of expansion by tandem duplications. In human and
chimpanzee, the V1R repertoire consists almost entirely of
non-functional pseudogenes, consistent with the loss of
VNO function possibly concurrent with the advent of trichromatic color vision during primate evolution [8]. Surprisingly, the dog genome encodes only five intact V1R
genes [8], the cow and opossum genomes encode less
than a third the number of V1Rs as mouse [9], and several
other mammalian species (such as pig [10], sheep [11],
and ferret [12]) seem to similarly exhibit reduced VNO
function as compared to rodents. Therefore, rodents
appear to be exceptional with respect to their reliance on
the VNO and V1R gene repertoires for mediating pheromone responses.
The mouse and rat V1R repertoires have modulated significantly since these two species diverged. In general, orthologous relationships between genes and syntenic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/74

relationships between clusters are difficult to map as a
result of lineage-specific duplications and deletions. Two
striking examples of delineation between the two species
are the complete deletion of two subfamilies (V1Rh and
V1Ri) in rat that represent the largest gene cluster in
mouse, and the independent generation of two subfamilies (V1Ra and V1Rb) in both mouse and rat from a
small number of ancestral genes in the presumptive ancestor [7,8,13]. Moreover, the V1Ra/V1Rb duplications in
both species appear to have occurred over a very short
period of evolution just following mouse-rat speciation,
probably driven in part by a wave of LINE repeat integration within the locus [13]. These observations suggest that
adaptive modulation of V1R repertoires were important in
the reinforcement of interspecies communication barriers
in the period immediately following speciation.
Unlike the odorant receptors of the main olfactory system,
which exhibit ligand promiscuity as part of a combinatorial system of odor recognition (reviewed in [14]), the
V1Rs of the VNO might respond to a very narrow range of
ligands, if not exclusively to one ligand [15]. Moreover,
while odorant receptor sensory neurons of the main olfactory system exhibit responsiveness in a concentrationdependent manner, the subset of vomeronasal sensory
neurons responding to a particular stimulus do not
change with the concentration of that stimulus. These
observations suggest that different members of a V1R subfamily detect highly specific ligands, implying that modulation of subfamily repertoires could modulate
physiologically distinct functions.
Little is currently known about V1R function. A recent
knockout of the entire V1Ra-V1Rb cluster in mouse perturbed normal patterns of female aggression and caused
male mice to show reduced sexual behavior towards
females [16]. Similarly broad effects in sexual and social
behaviors are evident in mice genetically deficient in Trp2,
a protein required for vomeronasal neuronal signalling
[17]. The low resolution of these phenotypes and the
apparent phenotypic overlap between mice deficient in a
subset of V1Rs and those fully deficient in V1R response
suggest that individual V1Rs make combinatorial or additive contributions to broad behavioural patterns, as
opposed to each V1R directing a distinct behaviour. To
our knowledge, the hypothesis that V1Rs contribute to the
establishment of mating barriers between species has not
yet been investigated.
It is presumed that one function of pheromones is the
establishment of prezygotic mating barriers so that unproductive mating is not attempted (reviewed in [18]). Prezygotic mating barriers can quickly arise to prevent nonproductive interbreeding attempts between subpopulations otherwise capable of mating [19], and therefore,

modulation of pheromones and their receptors might be
especially important for selective breeding within sympatric populations. For example, the Mediterranean shorttailed mouse, Mus spretus, is sympatric with certain subspecies of Mus musculus in parts of southern Europe and
North Africa. No hybrids of these two species have been
observed in nature, suggesting that they will not interbreed (presumably due to a selective disadvantage in
hybrid offspring), even though they can produce viable
offspring in the laboratory [20]. These two species
diverged approximately 1.1 million years ago [21,22];
with an estimated neutral substitution rate of ~1% per
million years [23-25], we expect that typical orthologs will
be ~98% identical between the two species.
In this study, we compare V1Ra and V1Rb gene repertoires
in Mus spretus and Mus musculus in order to investigate
whether, even over these very short evolutionary periods
and in a background of very high sequence identity, these
V1R repertoires exhibit the dynamic functional modulation observed between mouse and rat. Our results indicate
that functional modulation of rodent V1R repertoires has
occurred, albeit by diverse evolutionary paths, supporting
the hypothesis that adaptive changes in these V1R repertoires have contributed to the delineation of even very
closely related species.

Results and Discussion
We produced a mixture of Mus musculus V1R probes
composed of 200â300 bp PCR products from three members of the V1Ra and four members of the V1Rb subfamily
(Table 1). We confirmed probe specificity by conducting
a Southern blotting of musculus BAC clones known to
contain V1R sequences from the V1Ra, V1Rb, V1Rc, V1Rh,
and V1Ri subfamilies; only clones containing V1Ra/V1Rb
sequences hybridized to our probes (not shown). We then
used these V1Ra/V1Rb probes to screen the CHORI-35

Probes of the indicated size were generated by PCR using genespecific primers. A list of musculus V1R gene sequences with at least

expected to identify approximately 12 positive clones
given the redundancy of the library (three-fold) and the
anticipated size of the V1Ra/V1Rb cluster (~700 kb, or
approximately four BAC-sized inserts in length). We
sequenced the ends of all 17 BACs and confirmed that all
non-repeat BAC-end sequences were unambiguously
orthologous to the V1Ra/V1Rb locus in the most recent
musculus genome assembly (UCSC Genome Browser,
July 2007). These BAC-end sequences, along with an independent Southern blot restriction fragment analysis of the
isolated clones, were used to select a minimal tiling path
of four BAC clones that we thought would span the entire
Spretus V1Ra/V1Rb cluster, with the two flanking BACs
extending out to at least one non-V1R gene at either end
of the cluster. These four BACs were then subjected to
shotgun sequencing, yielding near 'comparative-grade'
finished sequence as described in Blakesley et al. [26]
(Genbank accession numbers: AC225052, AC225271,
AC225873, AC229624).
Production of a Mus spretus sequence assembly reveals a
conserved synteny map
We mapped contigs from spretus BAC sequences onto the
most recent musculus assembly using PipMaker http://
pipmaker.bx.psu.edu/pipmaker. We generated a presumptive locus assembly of ordered/oriented spretus contigs that maximizes contiguous alignment between the
two species (Fig. 1). Chained alignments between musculus and spretus sequences encompass ~485 kb, or approximately 68% of the spretus assembly and 67% of the
musculus assembly. The remaining portion of the two
mouse sequences that cannot be unambiguously aligned
consists predominantly of repeats that have integrated or
deleted in one but not the other lineage (see following
section). It is possible that this presumptive assembly is
incorrect if there have been additional evolutionary events
that have disrupted local synteny. However, we note that
the resulting spretus sequence produces an array of putative orthologous V1R genes that exactly matches the order
and orientation observed in musculus.

The synteny map shown in Figure 1 reveals three ambiguities. First, the spretus sequences at one end of the cluster
have subregions that exhibit lower than expected levels of
orthology. As noted, neutral sequences are expected to
diverge ~2% between the musculus-spretus split, and yet,
orthologous sequences in the vicinity of the musculus
V1rb7 gene, as well as other subregions (e.g., in the vicinity of the spretus YUA.6pg/musculus MUSpg.89648
orthologs), exhibit unexpectedly high divergence (Fig. 2).
The V1rb7-YUA.5 are closest mutual homologs in the
same relative position and orientation in their respective
clusters, and therefore are putative orthologs, yet exhibit a
synonymous substitution rate (dS) of ~17%, which is
much greater than should be the case in the roughly one

million years since the two Mus species diverged. It seems
likely that these subregions have been subject to gene conversion events in one or both species that have obscured
what is otherwise a much closer relationship. Nevertheless, this high level of sequence divergence might underlie
divergent functions between these orthologs.
Second, the spretus locus appears to have deleted a segment in the vicinity of the musculus V1ra8-V1rb3 genes,
although it is possible the segment is missing at this phase
of sequence completion (Fig. 1). In musculus, the similar
V1ra7 and V1ra8 paralogs exhibit a dS = ~6.5%, consistent
with a duplication event that occurred prior to the musculus-spretus split. Therefore, the absence of V1ra8 in the
spretus assembly is more consistent with loss in spretus
than gain in musculus. The fact that V1rb3, the next gene
in the musculus cluster, is also missing in spretus reinforces the hypothesis that a segmental deletion that
includes both V1ra8 and V1rb3 occurred in the spretus lineage.
Third, the spretus locus is unresolved in the vicinity of the
musculus V1ra3-V1ra4 paralogs (Fig. 1). This region is
near the junction of the two middle BACs (CH35-373N1
and CH35-336J18). There is no apparent overlap in these
two BACs (i.e., with 100% sequence identity), although
both BACs have highly similar subsequences as a consequence of each having possible orthologs to V1ra3/V1ra4
(YUB.3 and YUC.6, respectively). dS values predict that
paralagous duplications in this region occurred prior to
the musculus-spretus split (dS for V1ra3-V1ra4 = ~6%; dS
for YUB.3-YUC.6 = ~5%), and yet the dS values of crossspecies comparisons are greater than expected for orthology (dS range = ~4â7%). Therefore, the evolutionary history relating these four homologs might again be
obscured by lineage-specific gene conversions. We also
note that no putative ortholog to the YUC.7pg V1R pseudogene (most similar to musculus V1rb4), located just
downstream of YUC.6 on CH35-336J18, is present in the

musculus assembly, possibly indicating that lineage-specific rearrangements might have disrupted synteny in this
region. Further resolution of this phylogeny would
require higher-quality and more complete sequence
across this region, so that the full V1R content/positioning
and surrounding non-coding gene blocks through this
region could be more rigorously analyzed.
There is a low level of lineage-specific LINE integration
We previously observed that the V1Ra and V1Rb subfamilies underwent a burst of duplications independently
in both the mouse and rat lineage shortly after these two
species diverged [13]. The timing of these gene duplications was correlated with the timing of LINE repeat integrations at this locus, possibly suggesting a cause-effect
relationship. As in musculus and rat, LINE repeats are
abundant within the spretus V1Ra/V1Rb locus, comprising ~39% of the sequence and clearly demarking this V1R
gene cluster from surrounding LINE-poor non-V1R territory (Fig. 1; Table 2). As noted above, a significant fraction
of the broken synteny between musculus and spretus is
LINE content present in one but not the other lineage.
However, unlike with mouse versus rat, where lineagespecific LINE integration accounted for the vast majority
of broken synteny, we find very little evidence for lineagespecific LINE integration since the spretus-musculus split
(Fig. 3; Table 2). Therefore, the LINE (and other repeat)
blocks present in one but not the other Mus species are
more likely due to lineage-specific deletion, recombination, and/or gene conversion of pre-existing LINE content.
Species-specific modulation of functional orthologs
V1R orthologs are easily identified based on two criteria:
first, orthologous pairs occupy the same relative position
and orientation in the syntenic map (Fig. 1); and second,
orthologous pairs exhibit synonymous substitution (dS)
rates approximating the expected ~2% in codon-aligned
sequences (Table 3). Noted exceptions with conserved
synteny but with higher than expected dS levels (the

tor at one end of the cluster has been deleted in rat, and
the V1ra16-like ancestor at the other end of the cluster
became a pseudogene in mouse. The three other ancestral
genes (the V1Rb-like, V1Ra1-like, and the V1ra7-like ancestors) duplicated independently in the mouse and rat lineages (Fig. 4). Therefore, the functional repertoire is
significantly different between mouse and rat, driven by
lineage-specific mutations, deletions and duplications.

Comparison of LINE ages at the three rodent V1Ra/

is compared between Mus spretus (sp.V1R, light gray), Mus
musculus (mm.V1R, dark gray), and rat (rn.V1R, black), as
well as to the Mus musculus genome at large (wider, open
rectangles). The assumption that LINE repeats integrating
since the mouse-rat split would exhibit <10% substitution is
based on an estimate of neutral substitution levels of <20%
among orthologous sequences (20% substitution between
orthologs = 10% substitution along both lineages since the
ancestral node). These data indicate that the majority of
dense populations of LINE repeats at these rodent V1R loci
integrated around the time of the mouse-rat split (but not
since the musculus-spretus split) and that rodent V1R loci
have younger LINE repeat content as compared to the
genome at large.

orthologous pairs) and where orthologous relationships
are ambiguous (the YUB.3-YUC.6-MUS.A3-MUS.A4
orthologous groups) are discussed separately below. A
phylogenetic tree of spretus V1R genes and pseudogenes
that includes members of the V1Ra and V1Rb subfamilies
from musculus and rat illustrates these orthologous relationships (Fig. 4).
This tree suggests that the rodent ancestral cluster probably had at least five V1R genes, four from the V1Ra subfamily (V1ra1-like, V1ra7-like, V1ra9-like, and V1ra16-like)
and one from the V1Rb subfamily. The V1ra9-like ances-

We do not identify any lineage-specific V1R duplications
since the musculus-spretus split. The YUD.3-MUS.A7MUS.A8 clade in Figure 4 shows an apparent musculusspecific duplication, however as noted previously, the synonymous substitution rate (dS) between the A7-A8 pair is
~6.5%, or much greater than ~2% expected for the spretus-musculus split, and thus, the paralogous duplication
probably occurred before the two mouse species diverged.
Therefore, this clade is better explained by spretus-specific
gene deletion of the A8 homolog (assuming it is not missing within gaps of the unfinished spretus sequence). In
addition, the YUB.3-YUC.6-MUS.A4-MUS.A3 clade (Figure 4) also shows apparent species-specific duplications,
however as noted previously, neither the spretus pair
(YUB.3-YUC.6, dS = 5%) nor the musculus pair (MUS.A4MUS.A3, dS = 6%) exhibit a low enough synonymous
substitution rate to be consistent with post-speciation
duplication. Instead, it seems more likely that a paralogous duplication occurred prior to the musculus-spretus
split, and that the unexpected topology of this clade is due
to noise in the analysis or to gene conversion events that
might have obscured relationships. Therefore, in contrast
to mouse and rat, the musculus-spretus V1Ra/V1Rb repertoires have not significantly diverged by lineage-specific
gene duplications, a result that seems consistent with the
observed low incidence of lineage-specific repeat activity.
Instead, divergence of V1Ra/V1Rb repertoires between
spretus and musculus is evident by selective loss of function (Table 3). Of the eight orthologs in the V1ra1-like
clade, two have apparently become pseudogenes in musculus. Of the three orthologs in the V1ra7-like-V1ra9-like
clade, one has apparently deleted in spretus. And of the
seven orthologs in the V1Rb clade, one has deleted and
another has become a pseudogene in spretus. Therefore,
of the 18 V1Ra/V1Rb genes presumed to be functional in
the common Mus ancestor, five (~28%) have lost function in one but not the other Mus lineage.
We emphasize however, that additional V1R sequences
could reside within the remaining gaps in the current spretus sequence assembly. We compared in silico digests of
the BAC sequences by three separate restriction endonucleases (BamH1, EcoR1, and HindIII) to the same generated in the laboratory and imaged on a high resolution gel
electropherogram. This comparison of sequence to physi-

cal data allows a validation of sequence assembly (order
and orientation) for each BAC. From this analysis, we estimate that all gaps internal to each BAC assembly are <2 kb
(not shown), too small to be expected to contain additional V1R gene blocks (~5â10 kb in size). It is also
unlikely that a V1R gene resides between the leftmost two
BACs (CH35-319B4 and CH35-373N1) in the spretus
assembly, since based on mapping to the musculus
assembly, the missing inter-BAC region is only ~3.5 kb
and this region does not contain a V1R gene in musculus.
In contrast, the unresolved region between the two middle BACs (CH35-373N1 and CH35-336J18) might be >40
kb and is likely to contain several V1Rs. In particular,
identification of the complete set of the "A3-like" and
"A4-like" homologs in spretus, and their evolutionary
relationship with V1ra3 and V1ra4 in musculus, will
require the identification and analysis of a genomic DNA
clone that spans this gap in our assembly. Thus, it remains
possible that additional functional divergence between
spretus and musculus will be revealed by future sequence
from this region.
Evidence for positive selection among orthologous pairs
It has been previously noted that rodent V1R homologs
exhibit unusually low dS/dN ratios as compared to typical
gene pairs in these species [27], suggestive of a tendency
for adaptive selection, presumably to meet changing
niche- and species-specific requirements. Previous studies
have focused on mouse paralogs, rat paralogs, and mouserat homologs, but not mouse-rat orthology, because
orthologs cannot be unambiguously assigned due to
excessive lineage-specific duplications that obscure
orthologous relationships. In the current study, we specifically investigated selective pressures acting on putative
functional orthologs, an investigation made possible by
the unambiguous assignment of orthologous gene pairs.

We observe that two orthologous pairs, YUB.2-MUS.A5
(dS/dN = 0.99) and YUC.1-MUS.B2 (dS/dN = 0.25),
exhibit greater non-synonymous than synonymous substitution rates (Table 3). This observation is consistent
with adaptive selection acting on these pairs since the
musculus-spretus split. Selection for new amino acids in
these V1R proteins could indicate divergence from ancestral functions, and therefore, these V1Rs might contribute
to additional functional delineation between the two species. It is important to note that with so few nucleotide
substitutions accumulated between these orthologs (9
and 15 mutations, respectively), dS/dN ratios can be misleading due to small sample sizes. For example, we cannot
assert that the dS/dN ratio for the YUB.2-MUS.A5 pair is
significantly different than neutrality (dS/dN = 1), a possibility if one or both genes have become cryptic pseudogenes (i.e., non-functional as opposed to diverged
function). The argument for adaptive selection between
YUC.1-MUS.B2 is much more compelling, where 14 of 15
observed mutations have caused amino acid changes.
In order to assess the possible biological significance of
amino acid substitutions observed in these two V1R gene
pairs, we mapped mutations onto predicted protein structures. We compared these locations to other gene pairs
presumed to be under purifying selection (six orthologous
pairs with dS/dN > 2) (Table 4). Non-synonymous mutations in the six V1R pairs presumed to be under purifying
selection have accumulated more frequently within transmembrane domain-4 (TM4), TM6, and the intracellular
loop between TM5 and TM6. Non-synonymous mutations in YUB.2-MUS.A5 and YUC.1-MUS.B2, the two V1R
pairs postulated to be under positive selection, also
exhibit a bias for accumulation within the intracellular
loop between TM5 and TM6, but exhibit a greater incidence of amino acid change in TM3 and TM1. Three nonsynonymous mutations (3/44 opportunities = ~7% incidence) have accumulated within TM3 (two for YUB2MUSA5 and one for YUC1-MUSB2), whereas no amino
acid substitutions are observed in this transmembrane
domain among the other intact genes (0/132 opportunities = 0% incidence). Five non-synonymous mutations (5/
24 opportunities = ~21% incidence) have accumulated
within TM1 (one for YUB2-MUSA5 and four for YUC1MUSB2), whereas only one amino acid substitution is
observed in this transmembrane domain among the other
intact genes (1/72 opportunities = ~1% incidence). Interestingly, previous analysis of mouse-rat gene pairs indicated a paucity of non-synonymous mutations within
TM1 and TM3 [28], raising the possibility that different
regions of the V1R structure adapted during the mouse-rat
split than during the musculus-spretus split.
At higher resolution, we observe an interesting mutational
trend for YUB.2-MUS.A5 and YUC.1-MUS.B2: a tendency

cases did the well-conserved amino acid itself change,
therefore this bias would appear to have more to do with
modulating rather than eliminating the function of these
conserved residues. Analysis of a larger sample size when
additional Mus spretus V1R sequences become available
are required to further evaluate the significance of these
observations, and elucidation of the physiological significance of these amino acid changes awaits structure-function and ligand-binding studies.

Conclusion

Figure 4
V1R gene tree
V1R gene tree. Distance tree produced using 56 codonaligned V1R sequences (906 nucleotides length) from mouse
(musculus V1Rs denoted with "MUS" prefix; spretus V1Rs
denoted with "YU" prefix) and rat ("RAT" prefix; dotted
boxed clades). Pseudogenes are denoted by "pg" in their
names. Musculus-spretus orthologous pairs in which one species encodes an intact V1R and the other species encodes an
apparent pseudogene are shaded. Deleted V1Rs in one species but not the other are also shaded. Brackets with asterisks denote the two orthologous gene pairs apparently
subject to adaptive selection (dS/dN < 1; see text), and the
bracket without asterisk denotes the one orthologous gene
pair apparently subject to gene conversion (Fig. 2). From this
phylogeny, we infer that the rodent ancestor had five V1R
genes: a homolog to rat A16, a homolog to mouse A1, a
homolog to mouse A9, a homolog to mouse A7, and a B-like
homolog. Bootstrap values (1000 replicas) for nodes <95%
are indicated. Dashed lines with arrows show different locations of the MUS.A7, RAT.A2, and RAT.B9 branches in a parsimony bootstrap tree (1000 replicas) (not shown).

to accumulate non-synonymous substitutions immediately adjacent to the most universally conserved amino
acid residues (Table 4). Assuming a random distribution,
we would expect a 21% incidence of amino acid changes
immediately adjacent (+/- 1 amino acid position) to the
21 most well-conserved residues (see Methods). This
expectation is slightly greater than what we observe for six
gene pairs presumed to be evolving under purifying selection (6/36 amino acid changes = 17%). In contrast, 35%
(8/23) of the amino acid changes in YUB.2-MUS.A5 and
YUC.1-MUS.B2 occur immediately adjacent to these wellconserved residues. Note that only in one of these eight

We have generated ~700 kb of genome sequence encompassing a V1R putative pheromone receptor locus (V1Ra
and V1Rb subfamilies) in Mus spretus. The genome features of this locus resemble the syntenic locus in Mus
musculus, including a comparable number of V1R genes
with little evidence for gene duplication/deletion, organized in a comparably sized region flanked by the same
non-V1R genes on either side. These two mouse V1R loci
also exhibit a similar high density of LINE repeat content
that appears to have predominantly integrated just before
and since the mouse-rat split. Although disruptions in
synteny are largely accounted for by the presence/absence
of LINE repeat content in one or the other lineage, these
LINEs appear to be too old to have integrated by retrotransposition since the musculus-spretus split, and thus,
seem to have either arrived by other mechanisms or been
lost in one of the lineages. Therefore, LINE integrations
and V1R gene birth/death processes are not characteristics
of the divergence between musculus and spretus, in contrast to the previous observations made for mouse and rat.
Instead, functional V1R repertoires in musculus and spretus appear to have diverged by adaptive evolution in
which complementary V1R subsets have deleted along the
two lineages and specific orthologs appear to be subject to
diversifying selection and gene conversion. While the evolutionary paths differ, the outcome is similar among
mouse and rat species: nearly half of the mouse V1R repertoire (8/18) have been subject to dynamic modulation,
consistent with the hypothesis that even very closely
related species, such as Mus musculus and Mus spretus
that are separated by roughly ~ one million years, have
evolved species-specific chemosensory functions.

Methods
Probe Production and Library Screening
A panel of mouse V1R probes was selected that would
together hybridize to all V1R genes in the Mus musculus
V1Ra/V1Rb cluster on chromosome 6, assuming hybridization required >90% nucleotide identity (Table 1). Genespecific PCR primers were used to amplify 200â300 bp
from each gene; PCR was conducted using digoxigenin(Dig-) labeled dUTP (Roche). Probes were mixed for subsequent medium-high stringency hybridization to
genomic filters of an arrayed Mus spretus BAC library

Putative orthologs for Mus musculus and Mus spretus are shown in
the order they appear in their respective clusters. Italics indicate likely
pseudogenes. Synonymous substitution rates (dS) for orthologous
pairs are typically in the 2â4% range (exceptional pairs are bolded). A
range of ratios for synonymous to non-synonymous substitution rates
(dS/dN) are evident; two pairs possibly subject to adaptive selection
with dS/dN < 1 are bolded.

(CHORI-35 SPRET/Ei BAC library, Children's Hospital
Oakland Research Institute). Glycerol stocks were prepared for positive clones, and BAC DNA was isolated
using the Qiagen Midi Prep kit (Qiagen).
BAC Mapping
BAC ends were sequenced using proprietary protocols by
Agencourt Bioscience QuickLane Sequencing service
using the SP6 and T7 priming sites on the pTARBAC2.1
vector DNA. Resulting BAC-end sequences were BLATmatched onto the Mus musculus sequence assembly
(UCSC Genome Browser, July 2007) in order to provide
initial mapping information, assuming that synteny was
conserved between the two closely related Mus species. In
addition, EcoR1-digested BAC DNA was Southern blotted
and hybridized with the above V1R probe mixture to estimate the number of V1R genes per BAC and to provide
additional mapping resolution. From these analyses, four
BAC clones (CH35-319B4, CH35-373N1, CH35-336J18,
CH35-362A11) that appeared to be an efficient tiling path
spanning the entire V1R cluster were selected for sequencing.

BAC Sequencing
The selected BACs were subjected to shotgun sequencing
using standard methods, resulting in 7, 6, 8, and 18 contigs in the four BAC assemblies, respectively. These assemblies were subjected to near 'comparative-grade' sequence
finishing as described in Blakesley et al. [26]. A majority of
contigs were ordered and oriented by read pairs of gap
spanning subclones. Other contigs were established by
alignment to the reference (M. musculus) sequence (see
below). Contig maps were verified by comparing restriction digest patterns from laboratory produced gels to
those generated in silico from the consensus sequences.
The four BAC sequences are available in Genbank with the
following accession numbers (gi numbers indicate draft
versions
used
in
this
analysis):
AC225052
(gi:189095727), AC225271 (gi:183227749), AC225873
(gi:187960227), AC229624 (gi:192807370).
Synteny Map
The CH35-319B4 BAC sequence was assembled into seven
contigs that include the ortholog to the Txnrd3 gene that
flanks the "left" end of the V1Ra/V1Rb locus in the Mus
musculus assembly, as well as putative orthologs to V1rb7,
V1rb9, and V1Ra6, the three "left"-most V1Rs in this
assembly. The CH35-373N1 BAC sequence was assembled
into six contigs that include putative orthologs to V1ra5,
V1rb4, V1ra2, V1rb8, and V1ra4, consistent with synteny

The size (number of amino acid residues, brackets) of predicted
domains structures (E = extracellular, I = intracellular, TM =
transmembrane) and the locations of the 21 most conserved aminoacid residues in rodent V1R proteins are shown. The incidence of
non-synonymous mutations in six orthologous gene pairs (MUS.A6YUA.3, MUS.B9-YUA.4, MUS.B4-YUB.4, MUS.A2-YUB.6, MUS.B1-YUC.3,
and MUS.A1-YUC.5) with dS/dN > 2 (presumed purifying selection)
were compared to two orthologous gene pairs (MUS.A5-YUB.2 and
MUS.B2-YUC.1) with dS/dN < 1 (presumed adaptive selection).
Numbers shown are the incidence of occurrence (observed percent

to the next segment (moving "right") in the musculus
assembly. The CH35-336J18 BAC sequence was assembled into eight contigs that include putative orthologs to
V1Ra3, V1rb2, V1rb1, and V1ra1, consistent with sytneny
to the next segment (moving "right") in the musculus
assembly. The CH35-362A11 BAC sequence was assembled into 18 contigs that include putative orthologs to
V1ra7 and V1ra9, two "rightmost" V1Rs in the musculus
cluster, as well as the ortholog to the Uroc1 gene that
flanks the "right" end of the musculus locus. We confirmed a ~9.5 kb overlap of the CH35-336J18 and CH35362A11 BACs (the two "rightmost" BACs), but cannot
confirm overlap for the other two junctions. Based on synteny mapping, we estimate that the gap between CH35319B4 and CH35-373N1 (the two "leftmost" BACs) is
approximately 3.5 kb, a region not predicted to contain
V1R-like sequence. The junction between the two middle
BACs, CH35-373N1 and CH35-336J18, is less resolved. As
indicated, the former BAC contains a putative ortholog to
V1rb8, and the latter BAC contains a putative ortholog to
V1rb2 (located ~95 kb to the "right" of V1rb8), and both
BACs contain putative orthologs to the similar V1ra3 and
V1ra4 gene pair located between V1rb8 and V1rb2 in the
musculus assembly (Fig. 1). However, our phylogenetic
and neutral substitution analysis (see text) indicates that
there might have been lineage-specific gene conversions
or recombinations involving the V1ra3-V1ra4 region, and
therefore, it is not possible to unambiguously map synteny where these two middle BACs intersect. Contigs were
assembled and oriented for each spretus BAC in order to
maximize contiguous alignment with the musculus
assembly; short contigs without unambiguous alignment
to musculus were omitted from this "locus assembly". The
resulting spretus sequence assembly was analyzed for
repeat content using the RepeatMasker algorithm (http://
www.repeatmasker.org; Institute for Systems Biology,
Seattle).

position on chromosome 6. We note that the spretus
YUC.4 V1R was present in the overlapping sequence of
both the CH35-362A11 and CH35-336J18 BAC assemblies. We produced nucleotide alignments derived from
amino acid alignments of the 20 V1R sequences ("codonaligned"; see Additional file 1), as well as homologous
sequences from musculus and rat. We used the SNAP online tool http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/
SNAP/SNAP.html to analyze synonymous and non-synonymous substitution histories, and the Paup program
(Sinauer Associates) for phylogenetic reconstructions.

Authors' contributions
VCK designed and produced V1R probes, screened and
isolated clones from the spretus BAC library, and conducted Southern blots used to select BAC clones for subsequent sequencing. MG prepared BAC clones for
sequencing and conducted sequence analyses. The NISC
Comparative Sequencing Program performed shotgun
sequencing of the BAC clones to produce high-quality
sequence data; this included detailed sequencing finishing and confirmatory bioinformatics analyses to validate
the accuracy of the generated sequence. EDG supervised
the BAC sequencing process and contributed to the intellectual content of the manuscript. RPL conducted evolutionary analyses and wrote the manuscript.

V1R gene analysis
All spretus contigs (including short contigs excluded from
the "locus assembly") were surveyed for V1R gene content
using a virtual V1R probe designed from a composite of
all known musculus V1R sequences. A total of 22 V1R-like
sequences were identified, including 15 intact V1Rs that
encode open reading frames. The 15 intact V1Rs, along
with five of the pseudogenes, could be confidently aligned
over a 906-bp stretch. One of the excluded pseudogenes,
YUA.1pg (located between orthologs to V1rb9 and V1ra6
on CH35-319B4), is located at a syntenic position to a
pseudogene in musculus located at the 89739 kb position
on chromosome 6 (UCSC Genome Browser, July 2007
assembly). The other pseudogene excluded from the
alignment, YUD.1 pg (located between orthologs to V1ra7
and V1ra9 on CH35-362A11), is located at a syntenic position to a pseudogene in musculus located at the 90192 kb
