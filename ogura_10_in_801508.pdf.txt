Abstract
Background: With the increase in genomic and transcriptomic data produced by the recent advancements in next
generation sequencers and microarrays, it is now easier than ever to conduct large-scale comparative genomic
studies for familiar species. However, there are more than ten million species on earth, and the study of all
remaining species is not realistic in terms of cost and time. There have been a number of attempts at using
microarrays for cross-species hybridization; however, those approaches only utilized the same probes for each
species or different probes designed from orthologous genes. To establish easier and cheaper methods for the
large-scale comparative genomic study of non-sequenced species, we developed an in vitro homology search array
with the aid of a bioinformatic approach to probe design.
Results: To perform large-scale genomic comparisons of non-sequenced species, we chose squid, one of the most
intelligent species among Protostomes, for comparison with human genes. We designed a microarray using
human single copy genes and conducted microarray experiments with mRNAs extracted from the squid. Multicopy genes could not be detected using the microarray in this study because their sequence similarity caused
cross-hybridization. A search for squid homologous genes among human genes revealed that 68% of the human
probes tested showed the expression of squid homolog genes and 95 genes were confirmed to be expressed
highly in squid. Functional classification analysis showed that these highly expressed genes comprise DNA binding
proteins, which are under pressure of DNA level mutation and, consequently, show high similarity at the
nucleotide level.
Conclusions: Our array could detect homologous genes in squids and humans in spite of the distant phylogenic
relationships between the species. This experimental method will be useful for identifying homologs in nonsequenced species, for the development of genetic resources and for the collection of information on biodiversity,
particularly when using the genome of sibling or closely related species.

Background
The recent development of next-generation sequencers
has allowed us to sequence the complete genome of various species easily and rapidly [1,2]. Even though deep
sequencing is the fastest and cheapest method to date,
the species examined by deep sequencing are still limited
to model organisms and species that are medically or
commercially important. For example, 36 complete genomes are available among mammals, which occupy only
0.3% of species on the earth, whereas only 16 genomes
including 10 fruit-fly genomes are available for insect
genome, which comprise more than 50% of all species
[3-6]. From the viewpoint of biodiversity, we need to
know the genomes of as wide a range of species as possible to allow for environmental protection, to provide
material for diversified genetic resources and to promote
the basic sciences such as ecology, genetics and evolution
[7-9]. For species not currently included in genome projects, it is still possible to determine genes and their
sequences by constructing cDNA libraries and cloning
with RACE methods. Large-scale genomic studies to better understand biological diversity, and evolutionary systems and mechanisms, however, are not possible via
these strategies because they are limited to the use of
only a few samples. On the other hand, with the spread
of next-generation sequencers across the globe, there has
been a rapid increase in the accumulation of DNA
sequence data [10], which makes it difficult to undertake
traditional bioinformatic analyses such as homology
searches. Thus, there is a need to develop new methods
for large-scale genomic studies of non-sequenced species.
Our aim is not to find all homologous genes between
sequences, which is not possible in case where RNA is
absent or weak. Indeed, detection of all homologous
genes is not possible using microarray methods as such
experimental methods tend to result in false positive and
true negative estimations. There have been several
attempts to examine gene expression profiles using
microarray [11-20], but the challenge to search homologs
themselves by microarray is unique and novel.
Toward this end, we have developed a novel strategy
to pursue large-scale genomic studies using a microarray. As a first step, we tried to identify homologous
sequences between species diverged hundreds of millions of years ago. In this study, we selected humans
and squids, for a comparison of mammals and cephalopods. We choose these species because though they
diverged in the pre-Cambrian period and evolved independently, both acquired elaborate eyes and brains that
are remarkable among the two major classes of Bilateral
animals; i.e., Deuterostomes and Protostomes [21].
Accordingly, a comparison of genes and gene sets
between these species is of particular interest for the

Page 2 of 8

understanding of animal evolution. There is no need to
conduct in vitro homology searches if both genomes are
sequenced, so we have chosen squid as a non-sequenced
species. There are, of course, many candidates for such
a study; for example, humans vs mice or flies vs mosquitoes, but we sought to test our study in non-sequenced
species from scratch, and assess the sensitivity for
homology detection between relatively distant species.
We will continue work on other pairs once we have
obtained reliable results for humans and squids.

Results
Can an in vitro homology search array detect homologs
in remotely related species?

To search for homologies between human and pygmy
squid genes, we developed a novel in vitro homology
search array consisting of probes for human and squid
genes. The total number of probes on the array was
11,559 including 7,987 probes designed from human
genes and 3,572 probes designed from pygmy squid
genes (Figure 1). To avoid cross hybridization against
very similar probes on the same array, we have selected
appropriate region in the coding genes in both species
(see Method).
Next, we performed microarray experiments using
pygmy squid mRNA. The mRNAs were obtained from
the whole embryonic head (head), including the brain
and eye, and the remaining portion of the embryo
(body) for two purposes; to conduct two independent
microarray experiments to test for reliability and to
observe the changes in gene expression between different tissues. We found the significant expression of 5,435
and 5,431 probes out of 7,987 human probes in the
head and the body of pygmy squids, respectively, using
Agilent microarray scanner protocols (Figure 2). This
indicates that about 68 % of the human probes tested
were homologous genes (Figure 2).
Are these genes really homologs in pygmy squids?

It is possible that the number of expressed genes is
over-estimated due to hybridization to non-target genes
on the microarray even though we used standard scanner protocols and our probes were carefully designed to
avoid hybridization to non-target genes. Note that such
cross-hybridizations will dramatically reduce expression
intensities. We first checked the number of probes for
which the intensities were high among human probes
and found that the expression levels (probe intensities)
of most of these genes were less than 1,000 (1E+03 ≒
10bit) expression intensities on a 20bit dynamic range
as measured by an Agilent microarray scanner. This
result implies that most probes detected non-target
genes.

Figure 1 Procedure of probe design for in vitro homology search array. For every genes stored in the public database for human and
squid genes, we extracted 60 bp candidate probes at intervals of 50bp. Edit distances were calculated and the appropriate probes were
selected according to the following criteria; single genes, more than 11 edit distance, most 3’ probe. A total of 11,559 probes were designed on
the array, including 7,987 human probes and 3,572 squid probes.

To dismiss this possibility, we carefully checked
probes with high intensities. We set the threshold as
1,000 expression intensities and extracted the highly
expressed genes having intensities meeting this criterion
as potential homologous genes. We then determined 94
and 76 homologs in samples of head and body respectively. Out of the 94 and 76 genes, 27 and 25 genes are
already known in the public databases; thus, we can
conclude that highly expressed genes in our array are
homologous genes. Furthermore, 67 and 51 genes are
newly identified homologs (Figure 3, Additional Files 1
and 2, based on probe sequence data in Additional
file 3).
We then validated whether or not our in vitro homology search array can identify genes already known to be
highly conserved between humans and squids. We have
checked the expressed genes in squid samples using
3,572 squid probes on the array, and found 1,382 and
1,685 out of 3,572 genes are expressed at intensities
higher than the threshold, in head and body respectively.
A comparison of squid ESTs from the GenBank against
human genes designed on our array showed that 118
genes have a less than 1e-04 e-value in blastn search
against human genes, and these were then used for the
validation of homologies (Figure 3). Out of 118

Page 4 of 8

homologous genes, 27 and 25 genes were detected on
our array in head and body, which is equivalent to the
average detection coverage of all probes and indicates
that our strategy is a useful method for the detection of
homologous genes in a query sample (Figure 3) and
could successfully detect homologous genes on our
array.
What kinds of genes have been identified in this in vitro
homology search?

Not only does our array estimate homologous, but we
can also detect expression discrepancies between two
different samples; i.e., the squid head and body. It is
possible that sequence identity of squid genes against
human probes might affect signal intensity in the microarray. However, the same probe with a different signal
intensity provides reliable information on changes in
gene expression. We identified 15 genes in which
expression varied significantly between samples for the
squid head and body (Table 1). All 15 genes were newly
identified by our method.
The list of homologous genes indicates that 84% of
the genes are function-known in human genome annotation, and GO classification analysis [22,23] suggests
that the majorities of the genes are DNA-binding

Figure 3 Highly expressed genes tend to be conserved rather than other genes. Venn diagrams show the relationships among highly
expressed genes detected by human probes and squid probes, and highly conserved genes calculated by blastn search.

proteins (GO: Molecular Function) or are involved in
cellular process and regulation (GO: Biological Process)
(Figure 4). This seems to be a reasonable result because,
even more than 500 million years after the divergence
between humans and squids, DNA binding proteins are
usually included among highly conserved genes due to
selection pressure [24-27]. GO functional composition
between head and body was not so different, mainly
because these genes are highly conserved between distant species and showed essential gene set conserved at
nucleotide level.

Discussion
Novel approaches to the estimation of homologous
genes in non-sequenced species

Our in vitro homology search array was able to estimate
more than five thousand homologous genes in squid
and human, which represents 68% of the human genes
tested in this study. This indicates that a large-scale
genomic comparative homology search is suitable for
non-sequenced species. We were able to obtain this
result from a single experiment, and by doing further
experiments, we expect the number homologous genes
identified to increase. As only 85 nucleotides and 9,079
ESTs for pygmy squid have been submitted to GenBank
as of May 2010, our approach is a very efficient technique by which to identify homologous genes. Our
method will be useful particularly for sibling genomesequenced species.

Several cross-species microarrays have been designed
for various purposes, and a number of papers have provided thoughtful insights into the design and analysis of
microarray experiments [11-13]. Other approaches have
focused on the genomic and transcriptomic diversity
within mammals or primates [14,15]. Specific targets,
such as nitrogen availability and toxicogenomics, could
be pursued through the use of cross-species arrays
[16,17]. Heterologous or duplicated regions are hard target to detect with microarrays because of cross hybridization; however, careful assessment and analysis of
those data have been reported recently [18,19]. Unlike
these previous studies, our approach has a specialized
target, the identification of homologous genes between
distant species.
There is a vogue strategy for the large-scale genomics based on next-generation sequencers [20], but the
advantage of our method lies in the low experimental
costs. Microarray-based experiments are 10 to 20
times cheaper than current next-generation sequencing
methods, and this reason alone is sufficient to encourage the application of this method to millions of species to promote the the study of biodiversity. In silico
homology search methods, including normal homology
searches such as blast, are, on the contrary, powerful
tools with which to detect both close and distant
homologies, but they require query sequences that are
usually only partially available in non-sequenced
species.

Component, Molecular Function, and Biological Process.

Limitations and solutions

There are some difficulties in detecting homologous
sequences by experimental methods. First, in comparing
amino acid sequences, DNA sequences are easily
mutated over long periods. We often use homology
searches (nucleotide-nucleotide searches) for closely
related species, and translated searches of amino acid
databases for distantly related species. As it is not possible to perform translated searches in experiments, we
can only detect homologous regions if their sequences
are well conserved and protected from mutations by
slow molecular clocks. We are now assessing the efficiency of hybridization by conducting artificial crosshybridization microarray experiments (in preparation).
Second, we need to focus on gene coding regions for
homology detection because it is likely that intergenic
regions are too highly mutated for experimental detection. We, therefore, used mRNAs to search for homologous genes between two different species. In the case of

mRNAs, problems still arise in the distribution of gene
expression intensities.
Third, probe design in the microarray is also problematic. If probes with similar sequences are used in the
same microarray, it is possible to detect expressed genes
with two different probes as cross hybridization. To
avoid this problem, we have calculated probe sequences
in which edit distances are at least 70% different from the
most similar probes. We are currently investigating the
effect of cross hybridization by designing two different
microarrays with a few artificial mutation sites (in preparation). The potential for cross hybridization should be
considered carefully when designing microarrays.
Fourth, there is a problem with duplicated genes and
gene families. These genes have hundreds of homologous siblings that prevent experimental homology
searches due to cross hybridization. To prevent estimating false positive homologs, we have removed duplicated
genes from the array. Our method was aimed at

Ogura et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 4):S9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S4/S9

detecting homologous genes. The search for homology
between species proceeds more efficiently if we focus on
single copy genes. Detection of homologs of multi-copy
genes would require a different probe design strategy.
Possible applications to other species such as more
closely related species

We have tested this methods on humans and squid,
which are distant from each other in terms of nucleotide
sequence conservations. We could still identified 95
homologous genes, and estimated more than 5,400 candidate genes in squid that could have homologs in
humans. This indicates that if we apply this method
with more probes from humans, we may identify an
increased number of homologous genes in squid. This
method may also be applied to other species groups
such Primates, Rodents, or Diptera (flies), thus allowing
larger scale and cheaper genomic comparisons.

Conclusions
We have developed an in vitro homology search array
for the estimation of distantly related homologs. It
allows the estimation of homologous genes between
humans and squids, which diverged more than 500 million years ago. Some genes are, of course, false positive
estimations, but the highly expressed genes are thought
to be homologous genes. This experimental strategy will
be particularly valuable when the explosion of DNA
sequences data expected to be produced by next-generation sequencers leads to computational limits on the
performance of homology searches.
Methods
Collection of the pygmy squid

Japanese pygmy squid, Idiosepius paradoxus (Ortmann,
1881) were captured in the shallow waters along the
southern coast of Chita Peninsula in central Honshu,
Japan and maintained in a tank at the Ochanomizu University. Spawned egg masses were transferred to a Petri
dish and kept at 20°C. To determine the developmental
stages of the embryo, the criteria established by Yamamoto (1988) were used [24].
mRNA extraction

Total RNA extractions were performed by using E.Z.N.
A.® Mollusc RNAKit (Omega Bio-Tek Inc., Norcross,
GA, USA.) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA samples were extracted from the embryonic
head part and the remaining portion of the body of
pygmy squid at stage-25. The embryonic head (including
eyes and optic lobe) was cut using forceps and collected
separately from the remaining body and used for total
RNA extraction.

in vitro homology search array

We generated microarray probes for squids, I. paradoxus,
using the following procedure. First, we extracted 60 bp
candidate probes at intervals of 50bp from each squid
genes because the probe length for the Agilent microarray is 60bp. Second, for each candidate probe, we calculated the minimum edit distance between the probe and
the all squid genes except the gene containing the candidate probe. With this edit distance, we can avoid cross
hybridization between probe and non-target genes.
A small distance between the probe and the genes indicates a high possibility of hybridization between them. If
the distance was more than eleven and the probe located
more than 20bp away from the 3’-end of the gene to
which the probe belonged, we regarded the probe as
appropriate. We designed the microarray using these
probes that meet these criteria. When multiple appropriate probes could be selected from a single gene, we
selected the probe closest to the 3’-end of the gene.
Human and squid probe design

As probe sequences for human genes, we utilized original sequences provided by Agilent Technologies. However, the sequences are designed using UCSC Human
Genome build Hg 18, which is a slightly out of date
human genome assembly. Hence we chose probes
whose sequences exist in a single gene on UCSC
Human Genome build Hg 19. For squid genes, we collected available EST sequences from Genbank and also
designed their probes in the same procedure. To remove
the similar probes among the human and squids probes,
we furthermore selected probes whose minimum edit
distances for I. paradoxus genes were more than eleven.
Duplicated genes or multi-copy genes were removed
during this protocol. By this procedure, we finally
selected 7,937 and 3,572 probes from human and squid
respectively.
Microarray experiments and analysis

To perform the comparative analysis between humans
and squid, we applied total RNA samples from humans
and the pygmy squid onto the custom Agilent microarray 8x15K format. The microarray comprises 11,559 target sequences selected by the process mentioned above.
Total RNA from the embryonic head of the pygmy
squid and the remaining body portion were labeled and
applied separately to the array analysis. Briefly, 0.5 µg of
total RNA from each samples was used to synthesize
fluorescent-labelled cRNA using Cyanine 3-CTP (CY3c)
as described in the manual (Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color). Labeled DNA was hybridized for
16hr at 65°C on the custom array. After hybridization
the microarray slides were washed using the standard

protocol (Agilent Technologies, USA) and scanned on
an Agilent microarray scanner. Data were analyzed
using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v10.7).
The software normalize for any differences in dye signal
intensity, then, calculates a reliable log ratio, p-value,
and log ratio error for each feature to give a confidence
measure in the measured log ratio. Microarray data was
submitted to CIBEX.
