Abstract
Background: The availability of the complete chicken (Gallus gallus) genome sequence as well as
a large number of chicken probes for fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and microarray
resources facilitate comparative genomic studies between chicken and other bird species. In a
previous study, we provided a comprehensive cytogenetic map for the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
and the first analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in birds. Here, we extend this approach to
the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos), an obvious target for comparative genomic studies due to its
agricultural importance and resistance to avian flu.
Results: We provide a detailed molecular cytogenetic map of the duck genome through FISH
assignment of 155 chicken clones. We identified one inter- and six intrachromosomal
rearrangements between chicken and duck macrochromosomes and demonstrated conserved
synteny among all microchromosomes analysed. Array comparative genomic hybridisation revealed
32 CNVs, of which 5 overlap previously designated "hotspot" regions between chicken and turkey.
Conclusion: Our results suggest extensive conservation of avian genomes across 90 million years
of evolution in both macro- and microchromosomes. The data on CNVs between chicken and duck
extends previous analyses in chicken and turkey and supports the hypotheses that avian genomes
contain fewer CNVs than mammalian genomes and that genomes of evolutionarily distant species
share regions of copy number variation ("CNV hotspots"). Our results will expedite duck
genomics, assist marker development and highlight areas of interest for future evolutionary and
functional studies.

Background
Comparative genomics allows the transfer of genomic
information from a well-characterized species to another
that is less well described. It can be applied at all levels
from that of the chromosome to the genome sequence.
However, despite the recent advances in sequencing technologies, the considerable effort involved in producing a
genome sequence assembly is reflected by the small
number of vertebrate genomes that have been sequenced
to date. In birds, there is only one published genome
sequence, that of the chicken [1], with the zebra finch
genome due to be published soon.
Combining cross-species fluorescent in-situ hybridization
(FISH) and microarray analysis using resources developed
in the chicken provides a powerful tool for the identification of gross genomic rearrangements, gene gains/losses,
copy number variants (CNVs) and gene order in other
bird species. These techniques do not require sequence
data for any species other than the reference (i.e. chicken).
We have previously successfully used this approach for a
genome wide comparison of chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs between chicken and turkey[2]. This
revealed a strong conservation of genome structure over
about 30 million years of evolution between chicken and
turkey[3]. In particular, our results suggested that, when
compared to mammalian genomes, bird genomes contain
a low number of CNVs (i.e. polymorphisms in the
number of copies of a DNA fragment 1 kb or larger[4],
with the exception of insertions or deletions of transposable elements[5]). The latter finding indicates that patterns
of CNVs in bird genomes mirror the low number of chromosomal rearrangements in this phylogenetic group[2,6].
Following on from the turkey, the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos, APL) is the next obvious target among domestic
birds for detailed genomic studies due to its agricultural
importance, with worldwide duck consumption being
between 4 and 5% of the total poultry market[7]. Duck is
also an important target for immunological studies
because of its resistance to avian influenza[8]. Despite
this, genomic information about the duck is limited to a
few linkage and physical mapping studies. Huang et al. [9]
produced a preliminary genetic map based on 240 microsatellite loci and assigned 11 out of 19 linkage groups to
ten duck (APL) chromosomes by FISH mapping of 28
BACs. Cross-species chromosome painting and G-banding studies [10-12] have suggested one interchromosomal
difference between the chicken and duck karyotypes – the
ancestral chromosomes 4 and 10, fused in the chicken lineage to give GGA4q and GGA4p respectively, remain separate in duck[6]. This interchromosomal rearrangement
presumably explains the difference in diploid chromosome number between the two species, which is 2n = 78
in chicken and 2n = 80 in duck. FISH mapping of 57

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/357

chicken BACs revealed small intrachromosomal rearrangements in APL2, 7, 8 and Z and confirmed synteny for
GGA9, 11, 13–15, 18 and 28 in the duck genome[13].
However, no molecular markers are available for the
remaining microchromosomes, which are indistinguishable by conventional cytogenetics. It is also unclear which
duck chromosome corresponds to GGA4p (ancestral
chromosome 10). Thus, from a molecular cytogenetic
standpoint, the duck genome is at present only partially
defined, and given the low number of physical markers
mapped by FISH, it is possible that hitherto undetected
intrachromosomal rearrangements exist.
No data are currently available concerning CNVs in duck
or indeed any other bird species than chicken and turkey.
CNVs have been found to contribute significantly to normal and disease-related genetic and phenotypic variation
in humans and other primates[5,14]. Studies of the evolutionary significance of CNVs have largely focused on primates and revealed numerous lineage-specific gene gains
and losses and CNVs (e.g. [15-20]).
Our previous study of CNVs in chicken and turkey
revealed a total of 16 CNVs[2]. Five of these CNVs appear
to be shared in layer and broiler chickens, and in turkey,
at regions dubbed "CNV hotspots" (i.e. genomic regions
in which CNVs of approximately equal size were found in
both chicken breeds and in turkey). Given that the contribution of CNVs to phenotypic variation is becoming
increasingly clear, analyses of this kind of structural variation in organismic groups other than mammals are clearly
needed.
Here, we present a detailed molecular cytogenetic map for
the duck based on comparative FISH mapping of 155
chicken BACs, which revealed several hitherto undescribed intrachromosomal rearrangements. We also provide an analysis of CNVs in the duck genome by array
comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) of duck
DNA to a commercially available chicken whole-genome
oligonucleotide tiling path microarray. The analysis of
CNVs supports the hypotheses that bird genomes contain
fewer CNVs than mammalian genomes and that some
CNVs appear to be consistently shared across species,
forming CNV hotspots.

Results
Comparative FISH mapping between chicken and duck
Of 400 BACs that successfully hybridized to chicken metaphases, 155 (39%) could be visualized with confidence
on duck chromosomes. These covered the majority of the
karyotype i.e. APL1–29 and Z (except 26). Figure 1 shows
the G-banded ideograms for GGA1–8 and Z and APL1–8
and Z[13,21], with the positions of the BACs mapped to
these chromosomes; the full data are presented in Addi-

tional file 1. Figure 2 shows example FISH results. Only
one interchromosomal difference was detected among the
macrochromosomes, the retention of the ancestral chromosomes 4 and 10 in duck (which are fused in chicken).
FISH mapping suggested intrachromosomal rearrangements on GGA1, 2, 4, 7, 8, Z and APL1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and Z.
BACs WAG24H22, WAG30B21 and WAG36C14 clearly
showed a rearrangement on GGA1p and APL1p. The order
of BACs was not completely inverted, suggesting that the
underlying rearrangement may be a translocation rather
than a paracentric inversion. BACs WAG7C9 and
WAG13K4 (Figure 2A, B) mapped to GGA1p and APL1q,
indicating a small pericentric inversion. Besides, some
BACs mapping to GGA1q and APL1q suggested possible
rearrangements on these chromosome arms; however, the
high standard deviations in the FLpter measurements
determined for these BACs in duck made it difficult to distinguish artefacts from real changes in marker order.
BACs WAG42G5 and WAG9L1 mapped to GGA2q and
APL2p, providing clear evidence of a pericentric inversion.
However, BAC WAG18G1, which mapped close to the
centromere on GGA2p, also hybridized close to the centromere in APL2p. This demonstrated that the inversion
involves only a small fraction of 2p.
BACs WAG13I5, WAG23K3, WAG21J21 AND WAG22J17
clearly demonstrated a paracentric inversion on GGA4q
and APL4 (example image of WAG13I5 in Figure 2C, D).
The morphological differences between GGA7 and APL7
were reflected in a change in marker order involving BACs
WAG69P21, WAG59H11 and WAG21P13. However, like
in the rearrangement on GGA1p and APL1p, marker order
was not completely inverted, indicating that this rearrangement may be more complex than a simple pericentric inversion. Similarly, our FISH mapping results did not
provide clear evidence for a pericentric inversion causing
the morphological differences between GGA8 and APL8.
Marker order on GGAZ and APLZ chromosome was
largely conserved, with the possible exception of a small
inversion involving BACs WAG22P4 and WAG20L10.
Thus, it seems that the morphological differences between
the metacentric GGAZ and the subtelocentric APLZ are
due to neocentromere formation rather than a pericentric
inversion.
Dual-color FISH experiments with BACs mapping to
either end of a microchromosome were used to check for
conserved synteny among the microchromosomes. This
demonstrated conserved synteny for APL9, 11, 14–16, 19,
21, 27–29. The BACs successfully hybridized to the microchromosomes are listed in Additional file 2; example
results are shown in Figure 2E, F.

FISH mapping of BACs WAG112C24 and WAG23I06
facilitated the identification of the duck orthologue of
GGA4p. Chromosome area measurements suggested that
this chromosome should be numbered as APL10. There
were no major differences in size order between the
remaining microchromosomes and their chicken orthologues.
Copy number variation between chicken and duck
Hybridisation of genomic DNA from two female ducks to
the Nimblegen chicken whole genome tiling path microarray revealed 32 CNVs, of which ten were seen in both
individuals (CNVs marked with a in Table 1). Both gains
and losses relative to chicken were seen (8 gains and 24
losses). The mean and median lengths of the detected
CNVs were 281 kb and 50 kb respectively, ranging from
2.8 kb to 4.4 Mb. The CNV locations were compared with
those previously found in turkey and chicken broilers and
layers[2]. Six CNVs overlapped with CNVs identified in
turkey, and of these five CNVs matched the five potential
CNV 'hotspots' described by Griffin et al. [2] (bolded in
Table 1). Three of the 'hotspot' CNVs were seen in both
ducks. Known or predicted genes were found to be associated with 22 of the 32 CNVs (68.75%). In the ten cases
where no genes were associated, all were losses, and all
except one were found either near to the beginning or end
of the chromosome (between 2 bp and 4 Mb of the
sequence start or end according to Ensembl, http://
www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus).
The
exception,
CNV#14, covered a sequence gap, which likely contains
centromeric repeats. Two of the CNVs, #7 and #9, were in
regions that are potentially involved in rearrangements on
GGA7 and 8 respectively.

Discussion
Comparative cytogenetic map of the duck genome
Previous studies of avian genome evolution using crossspecies FISH have suggested that gross genome structure is
remarkably conserved among birds. Duck is no exception
from this pattern; in fact it appears that the duck karyotype corresponds very closely to the putative ancestral
avian karyotype [6]. The conservation of ancestral chromosomes 4 and 10, as APL4 and APL10 are consistent
with both the previous studies on duck and with broader
patterns of avian genome evolution[6]. These chromosomes appear intact in almost all birds, and ancestral
chromosome 4 is seen intact in human chromosome 4 as
well[6,13]. Our finding that only 39% of the BACs provided identifiable signals is attributable to the evolutionary distance between chicken and duck (90 million years);
we achieved a 70% success rate mapping chicken BACs in
turkey [2] (which diverged from chicken 30 million years
ago), and our experience suggests that success rates of
cross-species FISH with BACs rapidly decrease with
increased evolutionary distance. This is also reflected by
increased levels of non-specific background hybridisation

number of BACs hybridized in this study compared to
previous studies. Likewise, higher density mapping demonstrated that the morphological differences between
GGAZ and APLZ are probably due to the formation of a
neocentromere rather than a pericentric inversion. This
type of chromosomal rearrangement was previously
reported in birds only for the red-legged partridge [23]
and the Japanese quail[24]. However, despite the good
coverage of the duck cytogenetic map presented here, it
was not possible to determine unequivocally the nature of
all chromosomal rearrangements observed between
chicken and duck. It seems likely however that, in addition to peri- and paracentric inversions and neocentromere formation, translocations contributed to avian
genome evolution. This conclusion is based on the order
of BACs associated with rearrangements on GGA1, 7 and
8 and APL1, 7 and 8, which is not entirely consistent with
the order expected if the rearrangements were inversions.
Thus, it appears that while the available data from comparative FISH mapping suggest a relatively low frequency
of intrachromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of
bird genomes, the underlying processes may be more
diverse than previously appreciated. Undoubtedly, the
higher resolution afforded by genome sequencing
projects such as that of the zebra finch will help to resolve
this question.

from repetitive content, especially on the macrochromosomes, accounting for our wider error bars when assigning
positions to BACs on these chromosomes.
In agreement with previous studies, no other interchromosomal rearrangements were detected between chicken
and duck. However, our BAC mapping data are consistent
with intrachromosomal rearrangements distinguishing
chromosomes GGA1, 2, 4, 7, 8, Z and APL1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and
Z, which confirms and expands on previous findings[13].
The detection of additional rearrangements on GGA1 and
APL1 and GGA4q and APL4 was due to the much higher

The evolutionary direction of intrachromosomal changes
could be determined for GGA8 and APL8 only. Comparison with the turkey map [2] suggested that APL8 likely
represents the ancestral state; the order of BACs on turkey
chromosome 10 (ancestral chromosome 8) and the morphology of this chromosome is the same as in duck, indicating that the rearrangement has occurred in the chicken
lineage. Due to a lack of comparative data, it was not possible to determine the polarity of the remaining intrachromosomal rearrangements. If BAC positions are compared
between this map and the turkey map (Additional file 1,
[2]), the differences fit the patterns expected from the previously described inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements.
Among the rearrangements that we detected, the inversion
observed in GGA4q and APL4 is of particular interest.
Morphological differences in GGA4 have been described
between different chicken breeds[25], and the ancestral
bird chromosome 4 (corresponding to GGA4q and APL4,
respectively) is also one of the chromosomes most prone
to convergent independent fusions in birds (with ancestral chromosome 10) [6]. This contrasts with the conserved synteny of the ancestral bird chromosome 4
(corresponding to GGA4q and APL4, respectively) in
humans. Together, the data suggest that rearrangements in
chromosome 4 may be more common than has been suspected from previous comparative genomic studies, and

analyzing them will prove valuable for understanding
avian and other vertebrate genome evolution.
The present study extended the data previously available
for conserved synteny among the microchromosomes. Fillon et al. [13]demonstrated conserved synteny for seven
microchromosome pairs (APL9, 12, 14–16, 19, 29); here
we demonstrate conserved synteny for ten microchromosome pairs (APL9, 11, 14–16, 19, 21, 27–29). The lack of
detected rearrangements makes it reasonable to suggest
that there are very few, if any, rearrangements among the
remaining microchromosomes – including the as-yet
unexamined smallest microchromosomes for which no
markers exist. Indeed, no sequence data from the chicken
genome has yet been assigned to these smallest chromosomes, and it is still unclear why, although there is a suggestion that there may be a cloning or sequencing bias
against microchromosomal sequences[26]. Data on conserved microchromosomal synteny in other bird species
are restricted to the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica[27])
and the turkey[2]. Despite the paucity of data, the emerging picture is one of remarkable conservation among most
avian species, with the exception of a few groups where
large-scale interchromosomal rearrangements are common (such as the Falconiformes or Psittaciformes[28,29]).

The detailed cytogenetic map allowed for an improved
definition of the duck karyotype. Chromosome banding
and macrochromosome painting studies had previously
shown orthology of APL1–9 and Z to GGA1–3, 4q, 5–9
and Z [10-12]. However, it was not known which duck
chromosome corresponded to chicken chromosome 4p;
Fillon et al. [13]suggested that this was approximately
APL10–13. In this study we have used a combination of
BAC mapping and chromosome area measurements
which suggest that this chromosome should be numbered
as APL10. Moreover we found no evidence for rearrangements among the microchromosomes. Accordingly, we
propose that duck chromosomes be numbered as per
chicken for 1–9; that APL10 corresponds to GGA4p; then
GGA10 onwards correspond to APL11 onwards. The successful hybridization of at least one BAC from GGA1–28
(except 25) means markers are now available for APL1–29
(except 26) and Z. Taken together, these results enabled us
to define unequivocally chromosomes APL1–29.
Copy number variation between chicken and duck
The purpose of our array CGH experiments was to test two
of our earlier hypotheses: (i) that birds show a reduced
number of CNVs compared to mammals, (ii) that
genomic CNV hotspots described previously in chicken
and turkey [2] are found in the duck as well (indicating

conservation over a large evolutionary distance). The successful hybridizations that we observed, despite approximately 90 million years of divergence between chicken
and duck[31], extend avian cross-species microarray
experiments from the sole previous study in turkey[2].
The present study revealed a total of 32 CNVs in the duck
when compared to the chicken, which is substantially
fewer than the 58 CNVs discovered in a comparison of
human and chimpanzee[31], which diverged only 6–7
million years ago[32]. While this result supports the
hypothesis that bird genomes show fewer CNVs than
mammalian ones, it should also be noted that we found
twice as many CNVs in duck as were found in the comparison of turkey and chicken (32 versus 16) [2]. Only ten of
these CNVs were found in both duck specimens examined, indicating substantial intraspecific variation. These
findings highlight the need for further studies with larger
sample sizes and call for some caution when comparing
the frequency of CNVs in birds and mammals.
The comparison of CNVs between chicken breeds and turkey revealed five tentative CNV hotspots by virtue of the
fact that they contained CNVs of similar size in different
chicken lines and in turkey[2]. Of these five hotspot
regions, three contained CNVs in both ducks and two contained CNVs in one duck. The hotspot regions contain a
number of novel genes including most of the available
sequence for GGA16, covering the MHC loci. Moreover
these findings lend support to our avian "CNV hotspot
hypothesis" but, of course, need to be confirmed by analysing a wider number of species.
All copy number gains (in duck compared to chicken)
were located in coding regions. Genes in regions of copy
number gain relative to chicken included transcription
factors, neural proliferation control and neurotransmitter
activity, and a predicted MHC class I gene. This is consistent with previously described duplication of the MHC
class I locus in the mallard duck, followed by subsequent
inactivation of some of the extra gene copies[33].
Where copy number losses relative to chicken were
detected, two possible explanations exist: a true copy
number loss, or sequence divergence leading to lack of
hybridization on the microarray. If such sequence divergence had occurred, however, the loss might be expected
in both individuals. This was only seen for 9 CNVs; the
remainder are more likely to be true polymorphic copy
number differences. However, it is important to note that
about two thirds of all apparent copy number losses were
observed in coding regions; hence, the observed loss in
hybridization efficiency is likely associated with functional consequences, regardless of whether it is due to
copy number change or sequence divergence. Thus these
results highlight genomic regions that are of particular
interest for further functional and evolutionary studies.

It has been suggested that segmental duplications are correlated with CNVs, and facilitate chromosomal rearrangements, the lack of segmental duplications in birds
therefore explaining the relative paucity of CNVs[1]. Due
to the vastly different levels of resolution afforded by
cytogenetic mapping and microarray analysis, it is difficult to directly correlate the results of these two methods.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that two of the CNVs
revealed in this paper appear to coincide with rearrangements detected from the cytogenetic mapping. These are
CNVs #7 and #9, on chromosomes GGA7 and 8 respectively. Further studies are necessary to examine this link
between chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs in
more detail.

Conclusion
The comparative cytogenetic map of the duck presented
here highlights the extraordinary conservation seen
among the genomes of many bird species, and how little
structural genetic variation is readily apparent. The cytogenetic map will allow the transfer of genetic information
directly from chicken to duck, expediting mapping studies
in the duck and help to target marker development in
duck through the prediction of new loci. The combination
of area measurements and FISH mapping of chicken BACs
allowed the identification of markers for chromosomes
APL1–24 and 26–29 which will facilitate further mapping
studies in the duck. Moreover, we have extended the analysis of CNVs in birds, providing further evidence that
birds have low numbers of CNVs when compared to
mammals and that bird genomes contain CNV hotspots.
While overall we confirm the evolutionary conservation
of bird genomes, the intrachromosomal differences and
CNVs found highlight areas of future interest for evolutionary and functional studies.

Methods
Cell culture and chromosome preparation
All chromosome preparations were made from cultured
cells derived from fertilized eggs. Chicken eggs were supplied by Hill Top Farm, Cambridgeshire, UK and Friday's
Farm, Kent, UK. Duck eggs were provided by Cherry Valley Ltd, Market Rasen, UK. Fibroblast cultures were established from 5- to 7-day-old embryos. Chromosome
preparation followed standard protocols[34,35]: mitostatic treatment with colcemid at a final concentration of
0.1 μg/ml for 1 h at 37°C, hypotonic treatment with 75
mM KCl for 15 min at 37°C and fixation with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid.
Selection and preparation of BAC clones
400 BAC clones were selected from the Wageningen
chicken BAC library [36] based on the position of markers
on the chicken consensus linkage map[37]. The BACs
were labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP or
digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche) following standard protoPage 8 of 11

cols. At least one BAC was available for GGA1–28 (except
25) and Z. The 155 BACs successfully hybridized to both
chicken and duck are detailed in Additional files 1 and 2.
Fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH)
Slides with metaphase preparations were aged for one
hour at 70°C on a hotplate then treated with 4 mg/ml
RNase A for one hour at 37°C. The chromosomes were
denatured for 1 minute 30 seconds in 70% formamide in
2×SSC at 70°C. BACs were applied to slides and sealed
under coverslips with rubber cement. Hybridization was
carried out in a humidified chamber for 72 hours at 37°C.
Following post-hybridization washes (40% or 30% formamide in 2×SSC for 20 minutes; 1 minute in 2×SSC/
0.1% Igepal at RT; 15 minutes in 4×SSC/0.05% Tween 20
at RT; 25 minutes in 4×SSC/0.05% Tween 20/2% BSA at
RT), probes were detected with 1:200 streptavidin-Cy3
(Amersham), plus 1:200 FITC-anti-digoxigenin (Amersham) for dual-color experiments, in 4×SSC, 0.05% Igepal, 1.25% BSA for 35 minutes. Slides were washed in
4×SSC, 0.05% Igepal for 3 × 5 minutes then counterstained using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs).

Dual-color FISH was used to determine whether there was
conserved synteny among the microchromosomes, selecting BACs that were as close as possible to the ends of the
chromosomes. For GGA11, only one hybridizing BAC in
duck was available.
Image capturing and analysis
Slides were analyzed on an Olympus BX-61 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera
and appropriate filters. Images were captured using SmartCapture 3 (Digital Scientific UK). The signal positions
were measured as the fractional length from the p-terminus (FLpter[38]). FLpter and area measurements were carried out in ImageJ[39]. The area of duck chromosomes
was determined as a ratio of the easily recognized chromosome 5, as per[40]. For area measurements, 10 metaphases were measured per chromosome; the numbers of
metaphases used for FLpter measurements are given in
Additional file 1.
Array CGH
The NimbleGen chicken whole-genome tiling array (Catalogue Number/Design Name B3791001-00-01, galGal3
WG CGH – Roche NimbleGen, Milton Keynes, UK) was
used for the array CGH experiments. It contains 385,000
50-mer oligonucleotides with an average spacing of 2,586
base pairs (source – UCSC, build – galGal3) and was
interrogated with duck whole genomic DNA extracted
from blood from two female ducks using a DNeasy Animal Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, #69504); the reference
(Red Jungle Fowl) DNA, from the same animal used in the
chicken genome sequencing project, was kindly provided

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/357

by Dr Hans Cheng (Michigan State University). Labeling
of genomic DNA and hybridization to the Roche NimbleGen array were performed by the company (Roche NimbleGen) and used random priming to incorporate
modified nucleotides by either amino-allyl or direct linkage to either of the two dyes used (Cy3 and Cy5). All of
the hybridizations in this experiment used two dyes per
slide (Cy3 and Cy5). Red Jungle Fowl reference DNA
(Cy5) was co-hybridized with duck test DNA (Cy3).
CGH analysis proceeded in three stages, normalization,
window averaging and segmentation. After combining the
signal intensity and genomic coordinate information, the
Cy3 and Cy5 signal intensities were normalized to one
another using Qspline normalization[41]. Qspline is a
robust non-linear method for normalization using array
signal distribution analysis and cubic splines. Once normalized, the data was prepared for DNA segmentation
analysis. This included a window averaging step, where
the probes that fall into a defined base pair window size
(25 kb) are averaged, using the Tukey's biweight
mean[42]. The Tukey's biweight method yields a robust
weighted mean that is relatively insensitive to outliers,
even when extreme. A new position was assigned to this
average, which is the midpoint of the window. Segmentation was also performed on unaveraged data to permit
smaller segments than the window size to be detected.
The circular binary segmentation algorithm [43] was used
to segment the averaged log2 ratio data. DNA segments
were called by attempting to break the segments into subsegments by looking at the t-statistic of the means. Permutations (n = 1000) were used to provide the reference distribution. If the resulting p-value was below the threshold
(default of p = 0.01), then a breakpoint was called. A
pruning step was used to remove spurious segments,
rejecting segments where the standard deviation of the
means was not sufficiently different. By default, a cut off
of 1.5 standard deviations was used. CNVs were called for
segments in which the log2 ratio was greater than | ± 0.5|.
Where overlapping CNVs were detected in window averaged and unaveraged data, the data were considered to
represent a single CNV.
