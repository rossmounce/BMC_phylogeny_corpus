Abstract
Background: The ELR+CXC chemokines are multifunctional mediators that are mainly
responsible for the recruitment of leucocytes to sites of inflammation and infection. Because of
their high sequence identity with mammalian IL-8, fish IL-8-like CXCs have been named as piscine
'IL-8' and included in the ELR+ subgroup, even though there is no reliable functional or evolutionary
evidence to support this classification.
Results: In this investigation, a homologue of piscine 'IL-8' from black seabream (Acanthopagrus
schlegeli), called BS CXC, has been cloned and analyzed. The results revealed that BS CXC has a
high gene similarity and tertiary structure similarity with piscine and mammalian CXC chemokines,
both ELR-CXC and ELR+CXC, although it has a lower identity with ELR-CXC, compared with
ELR+CXC chemokines. Like other piscine IL-8, BS CXC has only an incomplete ELR motif, which
is essential for the mammalian ELR+CXC ability to attract granulocytes. Bioactivity assay
demonstrated that the BS rCXC produced in E. coli significantly stimulated migration of fish
neutrophils and macrophages, but had no effect on rat neutrophils and macrophages, whereas hrIL8 induced strong chemotaxis of fish neutrophils but did not affect fish macrophages. BS CXC seems
show some structural and functional properties of the intermediate between ELR-CXC and
ELR+CXC.
Conclusion: As an incomplete ELR+CXC chemokine from a modern fish, BS CXC provides some
clues on the evolution from ancient ELR-CXC to ELR+CXC by retaining some properties of the
intermediate stage in evolution, and it may be more appropriate to call this molecule 'piscine CXC
with an incomplete ELR', instead of terming it fish 'IL-8'.

Background
Chemokines are a group of small peptide chemotactic
cytokines, which are multifunctional mediators that can

trigger inflammatory cell chemotaxis toward a site of
infection and injury by binding to a G-protein-coupled
cell surface receptor [1,2]. Chemokines have pleiotropic

effects in regulating immunity and angiogenesis, and stem
cell trafficking appears to play a central role in linking
innate and acquired immune regulation [3,4]. Functionally, chemokines fall into two main categories; one is
homeostatic and generally involved in lymphocyte trafficking, immune surveillance and localization of lymphocytes; the other category is only produced by cells
during inflammation to prompt the migration of leukocytes to an injured or infected site and also activates cells
to raise an immune response and commence the wound
healing process. [5]. Based on structural properties and
primary amino acid sequence, chemokines are divided
into four groups, including the CXC, CC, C and CXXXC
subfamily, according to the position of the first two
cysteines [6,7]. Nearly 50 different CXC and CC chemokines have been identified and well studied in human and
mammalian cells by biochemical purification or cDNAdeduced amino acid sequencing [5,8].
CXC chemokines can be further subdivided into those
that contain a short sequence of Glu-Leu-Arg (the ELR
motif) and those that do not, the ELR+ subgroup and the
ELR- subgroup [9,10]. The ELR+CXC specifically recruits
polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) into inflamed tissues and promotes angiogenesis by specifically binding to
CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 [10], whilst ELR-CXC specifically
attracts lymphocytes and monocytes, with poor chemotactic ability for neutrophils, and inhibits angiogenesis
[3,5,9].
In recent years, the progress of nonmammalian chemokine research has been rapid since the first 'IL-8' homologue was cloned in lamprey [11]. Although many gene
products are identified by the molecular cloning approach
[12-19], little information is available on their biological
effects. Because of their high sequence identity with mammalian IL-8, fish IL-8-like CXCs have been named as piscine 'IL-8' and included in the ELR+ subgroup, even
though there is no reliable functional or evolutionary evidence to support this classification. In this paper, we
cloned a homologue of piscine 'IL-8' from black seabream
(Acanthopagrus schlegeli), called BS CXC, and analyzed its
sequence and bioactivities. Finally, we used the BS CXC as
a model to evaluate the position of piscine 'IL-8' in the
evolutionary development of chemokines. This investigation thus provided some insights into the evolution of
chemokines.

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of the BS IL-8-like gene
A 175 bp sequence was cloned by PCR using a pair of
degenerated primers designed from the conserved region
of the mammalian and piscine CXC sequence and the
sequence showing relatively higher identity and similarity
with the known mammalian and piscine CXC ligands (E

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/66

< e-10). Subsequently, two specific primers of IL-8F85 and
IL-8R94 were designed to get the 3' and 5' ends of BS CXC
cDNA, respectively. The products of 360 bp and 492 bp
were amplified by RACE. Compiling the three overlapped
sequences gave a consensus sequence of 851 bp, which
represents the full coding sequence of BS CXC cDNA (Fig.
1), then, we designed the other pair of primers, gF and gR
which covers the full ORF coding sequence region of the
candidate BS CXC to get the full length transcript of BS
CXC with RT-PCR. The product of RT-PCR was sequenced
and the full length transcript of BS CXC was confirmed.
The BS CXC sequence contains an 83 bp 5' untranslated
region (UTR) and a 285 bp open reading frame (ORF)
encoding a propeptide of 95 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The deduced peptide has a
putative molecular weight (MW) of 10.5 kDa, a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.86, and a 380 bp 3' UTR, which
contains three RNA unstable motifs (ATTTA) and a typical
polyadenylation signal 18 bp upstream of the poly A tails.
The sequence was deposited in Genbank with the accession No. of DQ000611.
The putative peptide of BS CXC contains a typical structure of the chemokine CXC ligand, which is formed by
two cysteines separated by Arg. The four cysteines that
should be involved in forming a disulphide bridge are
highly conserved, and the CXC chemokine family signature of C-x-C- [LIVM]-x(5,6)- [LIVMFY]-x(1,2)- [RKSEQ] x- [LIVM]-x(2)- [LIVM]-x(5)- [STAG]-x(2)-C-x(3)- [EQ][LIVM](2)-x(9,10)-C-L- [DN] [20] was identified in BS
CXC (Fig. 2A). The multiple alignments of fish and other
animal CXC peptides also indicate that most of the conserved amino acids are found in the mature peptide
region, especially in the signature, forming secondary
structure regions. The tertiary structure predicted by the
SWISS-MODEL shows that the BS CXC had a similar structure to piscine and mammalian CXC chemokines, both
ELR+CXC and ELR-CXC, which contains three β strands in
the N terminal and a α helix in the C terminal, and this is
in common with the results of human CXC X-rays [21-24]
(Fig. 2B).
Structural analysis uncovered significant differences in
receptor binding regions; like other piscine 'IL-8', the BS
CXC putative peptide lacks a complete ELR motif, which
is important for its chemotaxis of the neutrophils, because
the motif is the essential domain in the ELR+CXC ligand
binding to the receptor [25]. BS CXC and all the other fish
'IL-8' only have an incomplete ELR motif; for example, the
Arg was substituted by His to be the ELH in BS CXC. For
the DLR motif in rainbow trout, the Glu was replaced by
Asp [12], for the SLH motif in flounder [17], the Glu and
Arg were substituted by Ser and His, respectively. The

other piscine CXCs also have an incomplete ELR motif
(Fig. 2A).
Alignment of amino acid sequences of the BS CXC with
the other CXC chemokines indicates that the BS CXC has
a higher similarity with all the CXC chemokines (36–
72%), both ELR+CXC(72-42%) and ELR-CXC(49-36%),
and has higher identity with ELR+CXC (60.5-25.9) but a
lower identity with ELR-CXC(28.1-16.1%) (Fig. 2A). The
BS CXC has the highest identity with bony fish IL-8 (60.5-

51%), then the cartilaginous banded dogfish Triakis scyllia
(43.1%) and mammalian ELR+CXC (25.9–40%). But the
Agnatha (jawless fishes) lamprey only has a lower identity
(33.6-18.6%) with all the CXC chemokines [17].
Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the mature
peptide of BS CXC and part of the known CXC ligands by
using the neighbour-joining algorithm (Fig. 3). The

of piscine CXC, which are orthologous genes that represent independent lineages and have diverged from ELRCXC, share sister-taxon relationships on the evolutionary
tree. All the piscine incomplete ELR+CXC chemokines
formed one clade. In this clade, lamprey CXC of the
Agnatha (jawless fishes) is in an independent branch that
evolved first from ancestral CXC and later from cartilaginous fish CXC and other bony fish CXC. In the mammalian ELR+CXC clade, the orthologous genes of IL-8 and
chicken K60 ligands share parallel evolutionary relation-

ships, with the orthologous genes of CXC 5-7 and CXC 1–
3 forming sister branches. Piscine incomplete ELR+CXC
chemokines originated almost contemporaneously
through a series of gene duplication events. There is no
solid evidence to confirm that fish incomplete CXC were
clearly orthologous with mammalian IL-8. The results
indicate that the ELR+CXC chemokine ligands may have
evolved from ancestral ELR-CXC and diverged further during evolution to perform a special function. Fish incomplete ELR+CXC retain some properties of the intermediate

stage during the evolutionary development of highly specific CXC chemokines.
Expression of natural and recombinant BS CXC
Fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR was employed to
measure the expression of the BS CXC transcript in the tissues of normal and challenged black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli). The results showed basal expression of BS
CXC in various organs, including the heart, gill, spleen,
kidney and HK, and the basal expression was higher in the
blood than in other tissues (Fig. 4A). Figure 4A also demonstrated that poly(I:C) and LPS can significantly up-regulate BS CXC transcript expression in various organs.
Twenty-four hours after stimulation with poly(I:C) and
LPS, more than 4-fold up-regulation of BS CXC transcript
expression was detected in the HK and spleen tissue and
more than 2-fold transcript expression was detected in the
kidney, gill and other tissues. LPS seems to have a stronger
effect than poly(I:C) in the up-regulation of BS CXC
expression. The results demonstrate that BS CXC expression can be induced by poly(I:C) or LPS, as in the case of
other chemokines and cytokines [14].

A

Chemotactic response of leucocytes towards the BS CXC
gene
According to the sequence analysis, BS CXC is a putative
CXC chemokine with an incomplete ELR, so the chemokine might have the functional characters of both ELR+CXC
and ELR-CXC. A migratory assay of leukocytes was performed to test our hypothesis. The neutrophils were collected from peripheral blood and macrophages were

The relative expression of BS CXC

To get purified recombinant protein for the functional
assay of BS CXC, we generated a BS CXC expression construct through inserting a BS CXC mature peptide coding
sequence into vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The construct was
transformed into E. coli M15 cells and the cells were
induced to produce the recombinant BS CXC containing
a 6 His tag at the N-terminus for purification. Figure 4B
shows that the recombinant protein significantly
increased before (lane 2) and after induction (lane 1). The
molecular size of the recombinant protein is about 9.2
kD, matching well with the predicted molecular mass
weight. Lanes 3 and 4 show the purified protein. The BS
rCXC protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis
using an mAb against the histidine tag, in which a single
band was detected (Fig. 4C).

isolated from the lungs of rats and the head kidneys of
black seabream and common carp. Dose-dependent
chemotactic responses induced by BS CXC were observed
in the migratory assays of BS neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 5A and 5B). The chemotactic activity
appeared at low doses of BS rCXC (10 ng/ml), then
became stronger with increasing doses of BS rCXC, and
peaked at doses of 100 ng/ml for induction of neutrophils
and 200 ng/ml for macrophages. The BS rCXC showed
stronger chemotactic activity to BS neutrophils than to BS
macrophages. This chemokine can also induce migration
of carp neutrophils and macrophages, though its chemotactic activity to carp leucocytes was significantly lower
than that to those of black seabream. However, neutrophils from higher vertebrates, such as the rat, did not
show any chemotactic responses to BS rCXC. Our results
suggest that BS rCXC can induce chemotactic responses in

Discussion
The first reported fish chemokine gene from a jawless fish
lamprey belonged to the CXC family; the gene encodes an
IL-8-like peptide and was called lamprey 'IL-8'. Following
these discoveries, similar molecules were identified in different fishes, including shark, trout, flounder and carp
[26]. Because their sequences have a high identity with

Piscine CXC could not induce mammalian cells, but we
did not know whether mammalian CXC could affect fish
cells or not. Human recombinant IL-8 (hrIL-8) was used
to do a migratory assay of fish neutrophils. As shown in
Fig. 5C and 5D, hrIL-8 induced remarkable chemotaxis of
fish neutrophils but did not affect fish macrophages both
in Black Seabream and Common Carp.

lamprey IL-8, these piscine CXCs were called fish 'IL-8 ';
however, the name does not seem suitable, at least in the
case of BS CXC.
CXC chemokine ligands are grouped into two subgroups,
ELR+CXC and ELR-CXC in different species. Mammalian
IL-8 belongs to the ELR+CXC subgroup of CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif (ELR+). This group includes
CXCL1 to 8, except CXCL4, and these chemokines have
implications in the specificity for granulocytes. In contrast, the ELR- subgroup includes CXCL4 and CXCL9 to
14, and these chemokines attract lymphocytes and monocytes, with poor chemotactic ability for granulocytes
[5,14,27,28]. Fish 'IL-8' are grouped into the ELR+ subgroup but the classification seems unsuitable [14,29], not
only because of their incomplete ELR motif, but also
because of their functional differences compared with
mammalian IL-8.
In this study, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using the
neighbour-joining algorithm (Fig. 3) and a similar topology by the maximum-parsimony algorithm (data not
shown). Based on our results from phylogenetic analysis
and those obtained by others, CXCL12 and CXCL13 are,
in phylogenetic terms, modern representatives of the
ancestral ELR-CXC chemokine [7,14], and mammalian
ELR+CXC and piscine incomplete ELR+CXC are derived
from ancestral ELR-CXC. Piscine incomplete ELR+CXC
represents an early evolutionary stage of ELR+CXC.
Among the fishes, lamprey 'IL-8' (jawless fishes), which
occupies an independent branch, may be the first that
evolved from the ELR-CXC ancestor, followed by shark 'IL8' (cartilaginous fish), and finally leading to common
carp 'IL-8', rainbow trout 'IL-8', flounder 'IL-8' and BS
CXC, etc (bony fishes). Similar to the CXC protein molecules, there is also an evolutionary trend for the fish ELRlike motif, from GGR (jawless fishes) to SLR/SLQ (cartilaginous fish), then to SLH/DLR/ELH (bony fishes), and
finally to ELR (birds and mammals). The entire process
has probably occurred through multi-time mutations of
amino acids that have led to the formation of an ELR
motif–a special binding site for the CXC receptor in mammals.
In mammalian species, all CXC chemokines have a similar tertiary structure which contains three β strands in the
N terminal and an α helix in the C terminal, and all the
functional CXC chemokines act by binding to G-proteincoupled cell surface receptors via a seven-transmembranedomain, and signaling through a heterotrimeric GTPbinding protein [9,30]. Therefore, it is possible that all the
CXC chemokines evolved from an ancestral gene through
multiple duplication (7). The low identity among CXC
genes maybe result in conservative substitutions of amino

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/66

acids to suitable function-specific diversification in the
early evolutionary stages (14).
The differences in molecular structures hint at differences
in functions between mammalian IL-8 and fish 'IL-8'.
Before this investigation, almost no functional investigations about fish 'IL-8' had been performed, so it was
unclear whether fish 'IL-8' and mammalian IL-8 have the
same function or not. In this study, we used BS CXC as a
model of fish 'IL-8' to investigate the chemotactic functions of fish 'IL-8' and found that BS CXC developed a
chemotactic ability for granulocytes, but still kept the
chemotactic property of inducing macrophages and neutrophils, compared with its ancestors of the ELR-CXC
chemokine. Unlike fish 'IL-8', the mammalian IL-8
evolved a more specialized chemotactic function, inducing only granulocytes, but lost its attraction for macrophages. It is generally acknowledged that the ELR motif is
an essential structure for the chemotaxis of granulocytes
[25], however, our investigation showed that the incomplete ELR motif of fish 'IL-8', like the ELH of BS CXC,
already has chemotactic ability for fish granulocytes, but
mammalian IL-8 has a stronger chemotactic ability for
granulocytes, not only inducing mammalian granulocytes, but also affecting fish granulocytes. Our results are
supported by an experiment on an ELR mutation of
human IL-8. When the ELR motif of human IL-8 molecule
was mutated to an incomplete ELR motif, such as ALR,
EAR or ELA, the mutated human IL-8 retained its neutrophil attracting ability, but also showed a 100 to 1000
fold reduced affinity to bind with neutrophil receptors
[25]. These data suggests that the ELR motif is essential for
mammalian cells, but in fish incomplete ELR CXC is also
functional for the chemotaxis of granulocytes.
Taken together, although fish 'IL-8' with an incomplete
ELR motif already has granulocyte-attracting ability similar to mammalian IL-8, it still retains a strong chemotactic
ability for monocytes, similar to its ancestor, the ELR-CXC
chemokine. It seems that fish incomplete ELR+CXC still
retain some properties of the intermediate stage during
the evolution from ancient ELR-CXC to ELR+CXC chemokines. Therefore, several papers have noted that fish IL-8
is an inappropriate name for piscine chemokines (14, 28),
and it may be more appropriate to call this molecule 'piscine CXC with an incomplete ELR', instead of terming it
fish 'IL-8'.

Conclusion
A homologue of piscine 'IL-8' from black seabream, called
BS CXC, has been cloned and analyzed. The results
revealed that BS CXC has a high gene similarity and tertiary structure similarity with piscine and mammalian CXC
chemokines, both ELR+CXC and ELR-CXC, although it has
a lower identity with ELR-CXC, compared with ELR+CXC

chemokines. Like other piscine IL-8, BS CXC has only an
incomplete ELR motif, which is essential for the mammalian ELR+CXC ability to attract granulocytes. Bioactivity
assay demonstrated that the BS rCXC significantly stimulated migration of fish neutrophils and macrophages. As
an incomplete ELR+CXC chemokine from a modern fish,
BS CXC provides some clues on the evolution from
ancient ELR-CXC to ELR+CXC by retaining some properties of the intermediate stage in evolution.

Methods
Fish
Black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli), weighing about
100 g, were collected from a local fish farm in Shenzhen,
Guangdong province, and acclimated for 10 days in a 200
L fiberglass tank containing clean seawater at 25 ± 3°C.
Each day 25% of the water was replaced by fresh seawater.
Fish were fed commercial food at a daily rate of 1.5% of
their estimated body weight. All the fishes were handled
according to the regulations of "U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals
Used in Testing, Research, and Training".
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Healthy black seabream were challenged with an attenuated marine fish bacterial pathogen of Vibrio anguillarum
(about 2 × 108 cells per fish). Then 24 hours after stimulation, the head kidney HK was isolated and homogenized
for RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Japan) following the user's manual. The
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by MMLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, USA) with oligo dT or adapter dT
primer.
Cloning and sequencing of the CXC homologue
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was performed using
the cDNA template prepared above and a pair of degenerated primers dCXC-F/dCXC-R (Additional file 1), which
were designed based on the conserved regions of the
known CXC sequences, to amplify the black seabream
CXC (BS CXC) chemokine homologue. The PCR products
were ligated into pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian) and
transformed into XL1-blue E. coli competent cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a GenElute plasmid miniprep Kit (Sigma). The insert in the plasmid DNA was
sequenced using the ABI377a Automated Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems).

Based on the partial sequence of BS CXC, the 5' ends and
3' ends were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) approaches [31], using gene specific primers
and adapter primers (F85/adapter primer; oligo dG/R94)
(Additional file 1). The PCR products were cloned to
pMD-18T vector and sequenced.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/66

Based on the candidate BS CXC sequence, a pair of primer
gF(5' -ATG ATG AGC AGC AGA GTC- 3')/gR (5'-CAG ATT
GTC AGA GCC AGA-3'), which was located in 5'UTR and
3'UTR of the BS CXC sequence, respectively, was designed.
RT-PCR was carried out with these primers to get the full
length transcript of BS CXC.
Sequence analysis
The nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the BLAST
[32] program to determine gene identities, and multiple
sequence alignment was generated using the CLUSTAL W
[33] program. The signal peptide prediction was performed by the SignalP program [34] and the protein family signature was identified by the InterPro program [35].
The tertiary structure was predicted by the SWISS-MODEL
software [36] and visualized by the Swiss-PdbView software [37]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on
the full-length amino acid sequences of part of the known
mammalian and piscine CXC ligands, using a neighborjoining algorithm within MEGA version 3.1 [38].
Expression studies
Expression of the BS CXC transcript was studied by fluorescence real-time RT-PCR. Healthy black seabream were
challenged with LPS (Sigma) or poly(I:C) (Sigma) at a
dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, and the PBS-challenged fish
were used as the negative control. Twenty-four hours after
stimulation, total RNA was extracted from different
organs, including the gill, heart, head kidney (HK), kidney, spleen and blood. Single-strand cDNA was synthesized with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the
oligo dT primer (Promega) using DNase I (Promega)treated total RNA as the template. The gene-specific
primer F85 and GR primers (Additional file 1) were used
to amplify the targets, and the fragment of the β-actin gene
that was amplified by β-actin-F/β-actin-R was used as the
internal control to verify quantitative real-time PCR and
successful transcription. The fluorescent real-time PCR
assay was carried out in an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The amplifications were performed in triplicates in 20-μL reaction volume that contained 10 μL 2× SYBR Green Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), 1 μL (each) forward and reverse
primers (10 μmol L-1), 3 μL cDNA and 5 μL DEPC-treated
water. The thermal program for real-time PCR was 95°C
for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 s and 61°C
for 1 min. Dissociation curve analysis of amplification
products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction
to confirm that only one PCR product was amplified and
detected. After the PCR program, fluorescent real-time
PCR data from three replicate samples were analyzed with
7300 System SDS Software v.1.4.0 (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The comparative CT method was used to analyze
the BS CXC expression level. All analyses were based on
the CT values of the PCR products. The CT was defined as

Page 9 of 12

BMC Immunology 2008, 9:66

the PCR cycle at which the fluorescence signal crossed a
threshold line that was placed in the exponential phase of
the amplification curve. The CT for target amplification of
BS CXC and that for the internal control β-actin were
determined for each sample. The difference between the
CT values of the target and internal control, termed dCT,
was calculated to normalize the differences in the amount
of total nucleic acid added to each reaction and the efficiency of the RT-PCR. One of the samples was chosen as
the reference sample and was called the calibrator. The
dCT for each sample was subtracted from the dCT of the
calibrator, and the difference gave the ddCT value. The BS
CXC expression level could be calculated by 2-ddCT; the
value represented an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator. The data obtained from real-time PCR were subjected to the Student's t-test to determine differences in
the mean values between the control and treated groups.
P values less than 0.01 were regarded as significant.
Construction and expression of recombinant BS CXC
The cDNA encoding sequences of the deduced mature
peptide were amplified by PCR using the gene specific
primers rCXC F/rCXC R, which contained restriction
enzyme sites for BamHI or Hind III, respectively (Additional file 1). The digested PCR products by Bam HI and
Hind III were ligated into expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) containing a 6 His tag at the N-terminus for purification purposes and cloned into E. coli competent cells M15.
The positive clones were screened by PCR with primers
pQE30 F/rCXC R and the plasmids of positive clones were
purified and sequenced using pQE30-R primer (Additional file 1). The resultant proteins were named BS rCXC.

The positive colony was cultured and induced by IPTG,
and then the purified recombinant protein was generated
using a Ni-NTA agarose kit (Qiagen) under denaturing
conditions, following the user manual. The protein was
dialyzed in refolding buffer (50 mM PBS containing 1 mM
GSH, 0.1 mM GSSH, 1 mg/ml leupeptin and 1 mg/ml
pepstatin). Expression and purified protein were checked
by 4–18% SDS PAGE gel. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm the identity of the BS rCXC; the monoclonal antibody of 6His (Upstate, USA) was used as the
primary antibody for the detection of the Western blot.
Preparation of primary cultured leukocytes
Head kidney (HK) macrophages and blood neutrophils
were isolated according to the method of Solem J (1995)
[39] and refined. Briefly, the head kidney of black seabream or common carp was surgically removed, then
passed through a 100 um nylon mesh with ice cold L-15
containing 10 U/mL heparin, 100 ug/ml penicillin and
streptomycin (P/S). After washing several times, the cells
were resuspended in ice cold L-15. The macrophages and
blood neutrophils were purified by a discontinuous Per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/66

coll density gradient, collecting more than 80% of the
neutrophils and over 90% of the macrophages in the purified cells.
Rat blood neutrophils were isolated like fish blood neutrophils isolation, and Rat macrophages were isolated
from rat lungs by the perfusion method. Briefly, the lungs
and trachea were picked out carefully, HBSS was added
from the trachea to wash and perfuse the lung macrophages. The perfusion liquid containing macrophages was
sedimented at 400 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was
washed and resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium (containing 15 mmol/L HEPES, 0.05 U/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml
P/S) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The viable
cells were determined by 0.5% trypan blue exclusion. All
the rats were handled according to the principles of "Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals".
Migration assays
The migration of the macrophages and the blood neutrophil cells induced by different concentrations of BS
rCXC or hrIl8 was investigated using Transwell[40] permeable supports (Corning, USA), following the user manual. Briefly, after equilibrium the polycarbonate
membrane with a 0.5 um diameter pore was used in the
Transwell inserts with a culture medium overnight at
25°C or 37°C, respectively, the BS rCXC or hrIL8 dissolved in fresh L15 culture medium containing 5% fetal
calf serum, 10 U/mL heparin and 100 ug/ml P/S was
added to the plates, then 0.5 ml 1 × 106 cell/ml of the neutrophils or macrophages in fresh medium were added to
the Transwell inserts; each dose had three replicates. After
2 h incubation at 25°C or 37°C in a humid chamber, the
polycarbonate membranes were removed from the insert,
and the upper layer cells of the membrane were rinsed
with HBSS to remove the cell residues. Then the membranes were fixed in methanol and stained by Giemsa
stain and the migration cells passing through the polycarbonate membranes were counted in twenty randomly
selected fields under the microscope.
Statistical analysis
The means and standard errors were calculated from the
replicates. The mean values were compared using the Origin 6.0 program (Origin Lab Corporation, USA). A oneway ANOVA test was performed when significant differences occurred at the 5% level. Differences were considered significant at p-values of < 0.05.
