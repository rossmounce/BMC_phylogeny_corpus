information

Conclusion: Our data suggest that critical structural features of kinetochores have been well
conserved from yeast to man. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis reveals that human kinetochore
proteins are as similar in sequence to their yeast counterparts as to presumptive Drosophila
melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs. This finding is consistent with evidence that
kinetochore proteins have evolved very rapidly relative to components of other complex cellular
structures.

interactions

Results: Using computational approaches, ranging from sequence similarity searches to hidden
Markov model-based modeling, we show that organisms with CENs resembling those in S. cerevisiae
(point CENs) are very closely related and that all contain a set of 11 kinetochore proteins not found
in organisms with complex CENs. Conversely, organisms with complex CENs (regional CENs)
contain proteins seemingly absent from point-CEN organisms. However, at least three quarters of
known kinetochore proteins are present in all fungi regardless of CEN organization. At least six of
these proteins have previously unidentified human orthologs. When fungi and metazoa are
compared, almost all have kinetochores constructed around Spc105 and three conserved multiprotein linker complexes (MIND, COMA, and the NDC80 complex).

refereed research

Background: Kinetochores are large multi-protein structures that assemble on centromeric
DNA (CEN DNA) and mediate the binding of chromosomes to microtubules. Comprising 125
base-pairs of CEN DNA and 70 or more protein components, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
kinetochores are among the best understood. In contrast, most fungal, plant and animal cells
assemble kinetochores on CENs that are longer and more complex, raising the question of whether
kinetochore architecture has been conserved through evolution, despite considerable divergence
in CEN sequence.

Background

Kinetochores are eukaryote-specific structures that assemble
on centromeric (CEN) DNA and perform three crucial functions: they bind paired sister chromatids to spindle microtubules (MTs) in a bipolar fashion compatible with chromatid
disjunction; they couple MT (+)-end polymer dynamics to
chromosome movement during metaphase and anaphase [1];
and they generate the spindle checkpoint signals linking anaphase onset to the completion of kinetochore-MT attachment
[2]. Despite the conservation of these functions, and of MT
structure and dynamics, CENs in closely related organisms
are highly diverged in sequence, as are CENs on different
chromosomes in a single organism [2,3]. The simplest known
CENs, those in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
consist of 125 base-pairs (bp) of DNA and three protein-binding motifs (CDEI, CDEII and CDEIII) that are present on all
16 chromosomes [4]. These short CEN sequences, often called
'point' CENs, are structurally similar to enhancers and transcriptional regulators in that their assembly is initiated by
highly sequence-selective DNA-protein interactions [5]. In
contrast, CEN DNA in fungi such as the budding yeast Candida albicans and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, and metazoans such as
Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, are longer and
more complex and exhibit poor sequence conservation [610]. These regional CENs range in size from 1 kb in C. albicans [6], to several megabases in H. sapiens [8] and typically
contain long stretches of repetitive AT-rich DNA. CEN organization is particularly divergent in nematodes such as
Caenorhabditis elegans, which contain holocentric CENs
with MT-attachment sites distributed along the length of
chromosomes [11]. Sequence-selective DNA-protein interactions have not been identified in regional CENs and it is
thought that kinetochore position is determined by a specialized chromatin domain whose formation at one site on each
chromosome is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms [2,12].
A combination of genetics and mass spectrometry in S. cerevisiae has yielded a fairly detailed view of the composition
and architecture of its simple kinetochores. S. cerevisiae
kinetochores contain upwards of 70 protein subunits organized into 14 or more multi-protein complexes that together
have a molecular mass in excess of 5 to 10 MDa [5]. S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins can be assigned to DNA-binding,
linker, MT-binding and regulatory functions. While 'linker

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/3/r23

protein' is used rather loosely, all linkers exhibit a clear hierarchical relationship with respect to DNA and MT-binding
proteins: linker proteins require DNA binding proteins, and
possibly also other linker proteins, for CEN DNA binding but
not MTs or MT-associated proteins (MAPs).
Kinetochore assembly in S. cerevisiae is initiated by association of the essential four-protein CBF3 complex with the
CDEIII region of CEN DNA. CBF3-CDEIII association then
recruits several additional DNA binding proteins, including
scCse4, a specialized histone H3 found only at CENs
(CenH3). CenH3-containing nucleosomes are thought to be
core components of all kinetochores [13]. When CEN associated, the DNA binding subunits of S. cerevisiae kinetochores
recruit four essential multi-protein linker complexes, the
NDC80 complex (four proteins), COMA (four proteins),
MIND (four proteins) and the SPC105 complex (two proteins). These complexes, in turn, recruit a multiplicity of
motor proteins and MAPs to form a fully functional MTattachment site (P De Wulf and PK Sorger, unpublished
observation) [14-16].
A key question in the study of kinetochores is whether architectural features currently being elucidated in S. cerevisiae
are conserved in higher cells. Some S. cerevisiae proteins
have been shown to have orthologs in one or more metazoa.
These metazoan orthologs include CenH3, CENP-CMif2,
Mis6Ctf3/CENP-I, Spc105KNL-1/Kia1570, members of the NDC80
and MIND complexes as well as MT-associated proteins such
as EB1Bim1 and CLIP170Bik1, Mad-Bub spindle checkpoint proteins and some regulatory kinases [2,17-26]. To date, however, only CenH3 and CENP-C have been carefully compared
at a sequence level in a wide range of organisms [27]. Here we
report a systematic analysis of sequence relationships among
a set of approximately 50 fungal, plant and metazoan kinetochore proteins with the overall aim of exploring their structural and evolutionary relationships. Our analysis supports
the conclusion that the four linkers at the core of S. cerevisiae
kinetochores, the NDC80 complex, MIND, COMA, and the
SPC105 complex, have been conserved through eukaryotic
evolution. A subset of kinetochore proteins, perhaps 20% of
the total in S. cerevisiae, seems to be specific to point CENs,
all of which are very closely related. A second set of kinetochore proteins is found only on regional CENs. It appears,
therefore, that all kinetochores have a single ancestor, proba-

bly based on a regional CEN, from which contemporary kinetochores diverged rapidly while conserving key structural
features.

Results
Point centromeres have a common origin
As a first step in determining relationships among kinetochores in different organisms, we searched fungal genomes
for point CENs similar in structure to those in S. cerevisiae.
Three such examples are already known, C. glabrata, E. gossypii and K. lactis [28], but a significant number of newly
sequenced genomes have not yet been analyzed. Finding new
CENs with a CDEI-CDEII-CDEIII structure is not trivial
because the number of identical bases in CDEI and CDEIII is
relatively small, even among chromosomes in S. cerevisiae.
Moreover, CDEII is not conserved in sequence but, rather, is
characterized by high AT content and alternating runs of
poly-A and poly-T. To capture this information we constructed a tri-partite computational model based on profiles

for CDEI and CDEIII, a hidden Markov model (HMM) for
CDEII (Figure 1a), and S. cerevisiae CENs as a training set.
When the model was tested on C. glabrata, E. gossypii and K.
lactis, organisms whose genomes are fully annotated, 6/13
centromeres in C. glabrata, 6/7 centromeres in E. gossypii
and 6/6 in K. lactis were identified correctly (Figure 1b). Conversely, no point-CEN sequences were found in S. pombe, C.
albicans or A. nidulans, organisms known to have regional
CENs (Figure 1b). With a success rate of >70% and a false positive rate of <5%, we conclude that our computer model is
effective at finding point CENs.
When unannotated genomes were analyzed using the tri-partite computational model, 15 CDEI-II-III sequences were
found in S. bayanus,14 in S. mikatae and 15 in S. paradoxus
(Figure 1b) [29]. S. bayanus, S. mikatae and S. paradoxus
contigs have not yet been fully assembled, but sequence similarity and synteny suggest that all 3 have 16 chromosomes,
close to the number of putative CEN sequences identified
computationally in each organism. When these newly identi-

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R23

fied point CENs were combined with those in the literature,
85 CDEI-II-III sequences from 7 organisms became available. These yielded a clear consensus for CDEI and CDEIII and
revealed that, within a single organism, CDEII can vary in
sequence from one chromosome to the next but that length
distributions are very narrow (± 3%; Figure 1c, d). Most fungi
have 84 bp CDEII sequences but E. gossypii and K. lactis
have 164 bp CDEIIs, suggesting the presence of two copies of
an underlying approximately 84 bp CDEII module (Figure
1d). To a first approximation, the extent of conservation
among CDEI and CDEIII sequences on different chromosomes within a single organism was not much greater than
the extent of conservation among syntenic CENs in different
organisms (Figure 1c). Together, these data strongly imply
that all organisms with CDEI-II-III point CENs arose from a
relatively recent common ancestor.

and CBF3 subunits are mapped on a phylogenetic tree (constructed using the highly conserved reference proteins αtubulin, the signal recognition particle subunit SRP54 and
PCNA) they were found to cluster closely together (Figure 1f).
While recognizing the possibility for false-negative findings
in cross-species sequence searching, we conclude that CDEIII-III CENs and CBF3 CEN-binding proteins are probably
found only in a subset of closely related budding yeasts and,
thus, may have co-evolved. Intriguingly, the apparent common ancestor of point-CEN and regional-CEN organisms
appears to be a fungus containing regional CENs, implying
that simple point CENs arose from complex regional CENs
and not the other way round.

deposited research

To delineate further which kinetochore proteins are specific
to point CENs, and which are more widely distributed, we
analyzed all known S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins for
sequence conservation. As a starting point we examined
scMis12Mtw1 and scNdc80Hec1, kinetochore proteins first identified in yeast and subsequently shown to have human
orthologs (hsMis12 and hsNdc80Hec1) that localize to kinetochores and play a role in chromosome segregation [20,25].
Experimental and sequence data establish that yeast and
higher cell Ndc80Hec1 and Mis12Mtw1 proteins represent true
orthologs [20,32-34]. Nonetheless, the overall degree of similarity among Ndc80Hec1 and Mis12Mtw1 proteins across
eukaryotes was found to be relatively modest (approximately
15% to 30%) as compared to proteins involved in DNA replication (PCNA, approximately 75%) or protein translocation
(SRP54, approximately 60%). Multiple protein sequence
alignments of fungal, plant, and metazoan Ndc80Hec1 and
Mis12Mtw1 showed that sequence similarity is confined to 30
to 100 residue blocks interspersed by stretches of non-homology, many of which correspond to coiled coils (Figure 2a, b).
This pattern of block-by-block similarity was also observed
with five other kinetochore proteins for which orthology has
been established experimentally, and is consistent with previous proposals that kinetochore proteins have evolved rapidly
[35] (Figure 2c). Importantly, for our purposes, data obtained
from known kinetochore orthologs suggests that it is necessary to use conserved blocks, rather than complete sequences,
when searching kinetochore proteins for patterns of sequence
conservation.

reports

Does the existence of CENs with similar CDEI-II-III structures imply the existence of similar DNA-binding kinetochore
proteins? In addressing this question, the CDEI-binding Cbf1
protein is not very useful because it functions not only as a
kinetochore subunit but also as a transcription factor for a set
of highly conserved biosynthetic genes [30], implying conservation of non-kinetochore function. We therefore concentrated on components of the CBF3 complex, three of whose
subunits are thought to function only in CDEIII-binding (the
fourth subunit, scSkp1, is also a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex [31] and, like Cbf1, has conserved nonkinetochore functions). When PSI-BLAST was used to search
predicated open reading frames in 17 fungal genomes for
orthologs of scCtf13, scCep3 and scNdc10, all 3 CBF3 subunits
were found in the organisms with point CENs (7 in total), but
not in organisms with regional CENs (Figure 1e). As a positive
control for the PSI-BLAST search, orthologs of scMis6Ctf3 and
scSpc105 could be found in all fungi examined (Figure 1e).
Importantly, Mis6Ctf3 and Spc105 have approximately the
same degree of sequence divergence in point-CEN containing
fungi (51% and 48% similarity, respectively) as Ndc10 (48%
similarity; Table 1). We provisionally conclude that CBF3 proteins are present only in fungi with CDEI-II-III CEN DNA
whereas other kinetochore proteins (such as Spc105 and Ctf3)
are ubiquitous. Moreover, when organisms with point CENs

Fungal kinetochores contain a set of point centromere specific components. Schematic model of kinetochore subunitorganization based on the
architecture of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore. Kinetochore proteins can be roughly divided into DNA-binding (pink), linker (blue), MT-binding (green) and
regulatory layers (yellow). Within each layer many proteins are organized into multi-protein complexes, for example, the linker layer is composed of at
least four complexes (gray boxes (a) to (d)): COMA, NDC80, MIND and SPC105. Protein names are given for S. cervisiae first and S. pombe second, while
essential genes (italic letters) and non-essential (normal letters) is indicated. Protein names followed by an asterisk indicate that this specific ortholog is
known not to localize to kinetochores. The kinesins present at kinetochores in S. cerevisiae are Kip3 (Kinesin-8), Cin8 (Kinesin-5), Kip1 (Kinesin-5) and
Kar3 (Kinesin-14), while in S. pombe they are Klp5 (Kinesin-8), Klp6 (Kinesin-8) and Klp2 (Kinesin-14) (for nomenclature see [38].

refereed research

Based on success in identifying fungal orthologs of S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins, we expanded our set of target

The four human proteins representing hitherto unrecognized
orthologs of S. cerevisiae kinetochore subunits were provisionally named hsNnf1-Related (hsNnf1R; also known as
PMF1 [41]; Figures 4 and 5), hsNsl1R (also known as DC8 or
DC31), hsMcm21R and hsChl4-R. hsNnf1R shares with its
fungal counterpart 2 conserved blocks of 30 to 35 residues
with 47% and 67% similarity, hsNsl1R shares 1 conserved
block of 35 residues with 43% similarity, hsMcm21R shares 3
conserved blocks of 15 to 30 residues with 46%, 87% and 33%
similarity and hsChl4R shares 2 conserved blocks of 20 and
50 amino acids with 45% and 40% similarity (Figure 5). The
potential human orthologs of S. pombe Fta1 and Sim4 were
provisionally named hsFta1R and hsSim4R (also known as
Solt [42]). hsFta1R shares with its fungal counterpart three
conserved sequence blocks of 40, 25 and 30 residues with
48%, 49% and 58% similarity and hsSim4R one block of 27
residues with 65% similarity (Figure 6). Elsewhere we will
describe experimental data showing that hsChl4R, hsNsl1R,

organisms to higher eukaryotes (see Figure 4 for a schematic
of the approach). Alignments were created for 41 ubiquitous
fungal proteins and conserved blocks determined. The nonredundant NCBI protein database was then searched for
these conserved blocks using PSI- BLAST or Prosite pattern
searching algorithms (see Materials and methods for details).
Potential orthologs differing greatly in size from the fungal
proteins and candidates with well-established non-kinetochore functions were eliminated from further consideration.
The remaining proteins were then aligned to confirm the
presence of conserved blocks. This search led to the identification, in a wide variety of organisms, of previously unreported orthologs of many S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins
(Additional data file 1), among which were four new human
kinetochore proteins (Figure 4). Recent analysis of S. pombe
kinetochore complexes by mass spectrometry revealed the
presence of a set of proteins for which orthologs could not be
found in S. cerevisiae [39,40]. When conserved sequence
blocks from these S. pombe proteins were used to search the
genomes of higher eukaryotes, two additional human proteins were flagged as likely kinetochore subunits (Figure 4).
Regardless of which fungi contributed to the sequence blocks,
the most highly conserved kinetochore subunits were invariably regulatory proteins such as the Mad and Bub checkpoint
proteins and the Aurora B kinase. Structural proteins such as
Ndc80Hec1, Nuf2, CENP-CMif2 and Mis12Mtw1 were considerably more diverged.

Identification of novel human kinetochore proteins

reports

When 55 S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins (including the
CBF3 subunits discussed above) were used in PSI-BLAST
queries to search 14 fully annotated fungal genomes (Additional data file 1), 41 were found to have orthologs in organisms with both point and regional CENs (Figure 3). These
proteins included kinetochore regulators such as the Mad1-3,
Bub1, BubR1/Mad3 and Mps1 checkpoint proteins and the
Ipl1-AuroraB kinase, as well as many structural components.
In addition to the 41 proteins mentioned above, conservation
was observed for proteins such as Skp1 [31], Cbf1 [30,36] and
some MAPs [37] that function at kinetochores as well as at
other locations in the cell. As noted above, these proteins are
likely to have been conserved for reasons other than their
presence at kinetochores, and they cannot be used to infer
overall similarity in kinetochore structure. In this respect,
kinesin motor proteins are also difficult to analyze. Eukaryotic cells contain multiple kinesins, which are known to fall
into 14 highly conserved protein families based on sequence,
structure and function [38]. Typically, each kinesin has more
than one cellular function and kinetochores in different
organisms recruit different kinesin family members, making
it difficult to determine (in the absence of experimentation)
which kinesins should be considered kinetochore associated.
Leaving these complications aside, among 55 fungal kinetochore components analyzed, 11 were found in the 7 organisms
with point CENs and nowhere else, implying that they are
specific to a CDEI-II-III CEN architecture (Figure 3). These 11
proteins include the CBF3 subunits scCtf13, scCep3 and
scNdc10 described above, the non-essential CNN1 gene product, 1 subunit of the SPC105 complex (Ydr532c), two subunits
of the COMA linker complex (scAme1 and scOkp1) and 4 proteins that require COMA for CEN-association (scMcm22,
scMcm16, scNkp1 and scNkp2). Among organisms in which
they are found, the 11 point CEN-specific proteins are as well
or better conserved than ubiquitous kinetochore proteins,
implying that failure to identify orthologs in more distant
fungi is a consequence of their actual absence. We therefore
propose that approximately 20% of the overall kinetochore in
fungi containing CDEI-II-III CENs is specialized to their simple CENs. As expected, these specialized kinetochore subunits
include proteins in direct contact with CEN DNA (Figure 3).

hsMcm21R, hsNnf1R, hsFta1R and hSim4R localize to kinetochores in human cells and are required for accurate chromosome segregation (AD McAinsh et al., submitted).
Importantly, for the purposes of the current analysis, the
identification of new human kinetochore proteins means that
one or more subunits are present in metazoans for each of the
four multi-protein linker complexes forming the core of the S.
cerevisiae kinetochore. Thus, it appears that simple point
CENs in budding yeast and complex regional CENs in human
cells probably share fundamental architectural similarities.

information

In contrast to CenH3CENP-A, CENP-C and CENP-H, potential
orthologs of the human CENP-E, Rod, Zwint and Zwilch proteins were not found in any of the fungi examined. The apparent absence of a fungal Rod or Zwilch is particularly
interesting, since their binding partner at human kinetochores, Zw10, has a potential ortholog in S. cerevisiae, Dsl1

interactions

Several kinetochore proteins first identified in human cells
have previously been shown to have fungal orthologs, including CENP-C (orthologous to scMif2p [47]) and CenH3CENP-A
(orthologous to scCse4 [48]). We therefore wondered
whether additional orthologs might be found in fungi for
kinetochore proteins hitherto characterized only in higher
eukaryotes, such as CENP-E, CENP-H, Rod, Zwint and
Zwilch [49-53]. We found that, among fungal proteins,
hsCENP-H is most similar to S. pombe spFta3 (Figure 7a),
which was shown recently to be a fission yeast kinetochore
protein [39]. It has been suggested previously that S. cerevisiae scNnf1 is the budding yeast CENP-H ortholog [54] (Figure 7b) but we find that scNnf1 is actually much more similar
to hsNnf1RPmf1 and spNnf1 than to CENP-H (Figure 7c). We
therefore propose that CENP-H is orthologous to the fungal
Fta3 family of proteins. Searches using PSI-BLAST revealed
that the Fta3 protein, like the Sim4 and Fta1 proteins with
which it interacts in S. pombe [39], has apparent orthologs
only in organisms with regional CENs (Additional data file 1).
The presence of Sim4 and Fta1 in the budding yeast Yarrowia
lipolytica, which has regional CENs, but not in yeasts with
point CENs, is striking, since Y. lipolytica is significantly
closer in overall sequence to S. cerevisiae than to S. pombe.
We therefore conclude that Fta3, Sim4 and Fta1 are members
of a class of kinetochore proteins found specifically in fungi
and metazoa with regional CENs and not in fungi with point
CENs.

comment

S. cerevisiae DASH is a 10-protein MT-binding complex that
has attracted considerable recent interest because it forms
rings encircling MTs [43,44]. DASH subunits are conserved
among fungi but we have found few if any potential orthologs
in higher eukaryotes. The closest match to a DASH protein in
humans, NYD-SP28 [45], has an amino-terminal domain of
about 30 amino acids 40% similar to S. cerevisiae Spc34
(Additional data file 2). The Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii
ortholog of NYD-SP28 localizes to the flagellum [46], implying that NYD-SP28 might be involved in interactions with
MTs. Our preliminary conclusion is that higher eukaryotes do
not contain a protein complex closely related to fungal DASH,
although further investigation of NYD-SP28 is warranted.

Discussion

Extensive genetic and biochemical experimentation has made
S. cerevisiae kinetochores the best characterized structures
involved in chromosome-MT attachment [5]. S. cerevisiae
kinetochores contain upwards of 70 protein subunits assembled into 14 or more multi-protein complexes. In this study
we used similarity-based sequence searching to ascertain

information

Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a microsporidium and intracellular parasite that has been subjected to considerable evolutionary pressure to reduce its genome to the smallest possible
size. As a consequence, E. cuniculi and related microsporidia
have the smallest known eukaryotic proteome (1,997
potential open reading frames) and many cellular structures

Organization of the simplest kinetochore

deposited research

Thus far, we have distinguished only between point and
regional CENs but a more nuanced view can be obtained from
phylogenetic analysis of kinetochore structural proteins. As a
reference for these comparisons, a tree was constructed by
combining data on three well-conserved eukaryotic proteins:
α-tubulin, PCNA and SRP54 (Figure 8a; this reference tree
closely matches reference trees constructed by others
[58,59]). The reference tree exhibited prototypical clustering
of fungi in one branch and metazoa in another so that Drosophila and C. elegans were much closer to humans than S.
pombe or S. cerevisiae. However, the phylogenetic trees for
Ndc80Hec1 and Nuf2 were remarkably different: overall
sequence divergence was much greater and Drosophila and
C. elegans Ndc80Hec1 (or Nuf2) proteins were not significantly more similar to their human than their fungal counterparts (Figure 8b, c). Drosophila Ndc80 and Nuf2 were
particularly striking in occupying a branch of the phylogenetic tree distant from all other animals. This great divergence in Drosophila kinetochore protein sequence is also
illustrated by the fact that, apart from regulatory components, such as the Mad-Bub proteins and a few MAPs, only a
limited number of structural kinetochore proteins have been
identified in flies (for example, CENP-C [60], CenH3CID [61],
the RZZ complex [62], Ndc80Hec1, Nuf2, and Mis12Mtw1 ;Figure 9).

reports

Evolutionary relationships among kinetochores

in E. cuniculi lack redundant and non-essential genes [63].
Using our HMM for CDEI-II-III, no sequences similar to
point CENs were found on any of the 11 E. cuniculi chromosomes, nor were CBF3 proteins found by PSI-BLAST (Figure
10a). We therefore speculate that E. cuniculi contains a
regional CEN of some sort. Orthologs of CenH3 and CENPCMif2 are present in E. cuniculi, as are all four components of
the NDC80 linker complex, three components of MIND and
SPC105 (Figure 10b, Additional data file 3). No subunits of
COMA, the fourth S. cerevisiae linker, were found. Among
regulatory proteins, E. cuniculi Ipl1/Aurora B and SurvivinBir1
orthologs were present as were Mps1 and Bub3, but not other
proteins required for the spindle assembly checkpoint in
yeast or human cells (Figure 10b). When Cdc20, an essential
activator of the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) was
examined for sequence motifs, further evidence was obtained
that E. cuniculi lacks a spindle checkpoint. APC/C is an E3
ligase required for the ubiquitination of proteins whose
destruction is necessary at the metaphase-anaphase transition [64]. In all eukaryotes examined to date, an activated
form of the Mad2 checkpoint protein binds to Cdc20 via a
short conserved peptide so as to block Cdc20 from activating
APC/C, thereby arresting cells at the metaphase-to-anaphase
transition [65,66] (Figure 10c). E. cuniculi Cdc20 contains
the WD-domain implicated in APC/C interaction but lacks
any sequence similar to a Mad2 binding domain (Figure 10c),
implying that it is not subject to checkpoint control. From
these data we conclude that E. cuniculi probably contains a
very simple kinetochore, based on a regional CEN that contains about one-half the proteins found in S. cerevisiae. In
contrast, other large multi-protein structures in E. cuniculi
are only slightly less complex than their higher eukaryotic
counterparts. For example, E. cuniculi ribosomes are composed of 77 subunits as compared to 84 subunits in S. cerevisiae. Symptomatic of the simplicity of the E. cuniculi
kinetochore is the absence of the vast majority of potential
MAPs. Nonetheless, it is significant that the E. cuniculi kinetochore contains three of the four linker complexes that
appear to form the core of budding yeast and human
kinetochores.

reviews

[55]. Both hsZw10 and scDsl1 play a role in membrane trafficking during interphase [56], but scDsl1 is not known to
localize to kinetochores. Thus, whereas human hsZw10 functions in vesicle-MT and chromosome-MT interaction, scDsl1
appears to have only the former function, presumably
because Rod and Zwilch are not present. The absence of Zw10
from fungal kinetochores is also sufficient to explain the
absence of Dynein: the Rod/Zw10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex is
needed for the association of Dynein with human and Drosophila kinetochores [57]. Considering these data together,
we conclude that animal cell kinetochores contain proteins,
currently comprising perhaps 25% of the total (and likely to
increase), that are absent in fungi with either regional or
point CENs.

which S. cerevisiae kinetochore proteins have orthologs in 15
fungi, 11 metazoa and 2 plants (Additional data file 1) with the
overall aim of determining which structural features of S. cerevisiae kinetochores have been conserved throughout evolution. The analysis is not as straightforward as might be
assumed, because kinetochore proteins are among the most
rapidly evolving proteins in the genome [67]. In addition, the
structure and sequence of CEN DNA has diverged widely
from organism to organism. Whereas fungi closely related to
S. cerevisiae contain 125 to 225 bp CENs with a CDEI-CDEIICDEIII structure, most other organisms contain much longer
regional CENs with few if any conserved sequence elements.
Guided by experimental data on established orthologies in
yeast, humans and other organisms, we base most of the conclusions in this paper on the characterization of proteins that
share blocks of homologous sequence. In several cases, we
also draw inferences from a failure to identify homologous
proteins. We recognize that this failure represents a negative

result with many potential causes. However, in cases in which
a kinetochore protein is conserved among organisms A, B and
C whereas a second kinetochore protein is well-conserved
only in species A and B and undetectable in C (and multiple
related species), a tentative conclusion can be drawn that the
second protein is actually absent from C. For example, we find
that CBF3, an essential CEN-binding protein in S. cerevisiae,
has orthologs in seven budding yeasts containing CEN DNA
conforming to a CDEI-CDEII-CDEIII organization but not in
organisms with regional CENs. In contrast, other kinetochore
proteins similar in their degree of sequence conservation to
CBF3 subunits among point CEN-containing yeast (approximately 45% to 50% similarity) are found throughout fungi.
Thus, we provisionally conclude that CBF3 is present in only
fungi with CDEI-CDEII-CDEIII centromeres. Despite the
potential for occasional error, our use of both positive and
negative findings makes it possible to draw broad conclusions
about the organization and possible origins of simple and

evolved. Several findings in the current work suggest, however, that CDEI-II-III CENs arose in combination with a set
of 11 proteins as a specialization of a regional CEN. First, all
annotated organisms containing point CENs (S. cerevisiae, C.
glabrata, K. lactis, and E. gossypii) have a common origin in
one relatively shallow branch of the fungal phylogenetic tree.
Were CDEI-II-III sequences an ancestral CEN, the current
distribution of regional CENs would require loss of point
CENs from multiple independent evolutionary branches. Second, we could obtain no evidence for CDEI-II-III CEN DNA
or CBF3 proteins in the microsporidium E. cuniculi, which is
thought to have arisen through an ancient divergence in the
fungal kingdom [68].
If the speculation that CDEI-II-III point-CENs evolved from
regional CENs is correct, we must consider the possible existence of other short CENs that are also based on sequence-specific DNA binding interactions just not CBF3. By way of
precedent, the emergence of CDEI-II-III CENs is coincident
with large-scale chromosomal changes that gave rise to the
HMR, HML and MAT loci, thereby changing the sexual
potential of S. cerevisiae and related yeasts [29]. S. pombe
and its close relatives undergo mating type switching analogous to that in S. cerevisiae, but the molecular mechanisms of
switching are completely different [69]. Functional analysis
of fungi with short uncharacterized CENs will be needed to
test the speculation that just as different forms of mating-type
switching have developed based on distinct biochemistry,
point CENs with structures other than CDEI-II-III might
exist.

more conservative approach.

Origins of point centromeres
Based on the simple structure of their CENs, it is widely
assumed that S. cerevisiae kinetochores represent an ancestral structure from which complex regional kinetochores

Sequence comparison reveals that conservation among
orthologous kinetochore proteins is invariably restricted to
relatively short sequence blocks embedded in longer regions
of low sequence similarity. The restriction of sequence similarity to small blocks explains the relative difficulty in finding
orthologs and the widespread assumption that yeast and
human kinetochores are very different. Henikoff and
colleagues [67] have studied the evolutionary divergence of
CenH3 and CENP-CMif2 in some detail and propose that kinetochore proteins are under positive selection in plants and
animals as a consequence of meiotic drive by CEN DNA
during female meiosis. Rapid evolution in protein sequence is
most apparent in worms and flies, and in this study we have
added only dmNdc80, dmNuf2 and dmMis12 to the list of
likely structural Drosophila kinetochore proteins. Why the
rate of kinetochore protein evolution is so much greater in
flies and worms as compared to mammals, plants and fungi
remains a mystery but it is reminiscent of data on other key
regulators of chromosome segregation. Securin and its protease separase are also highly diverged in D. melanogaster:
Drosophila securin, unlike the human and yeast proteins,
consists of two separate gene products, called three rows and
pimples, that interact with an unusually short separase [70].
Moreover, unlike the majority of eukaryotes that utilize an

refereed research

A key conclusion in this paper is that four multi-protein linkers that form the core of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore, MIND,
the SPC105 complex, the NDC80 complex and COMA are also
likely to be present in a wide variety of species (Figure 11).
Along with CenH3 and CENP-C, SPC105, MIND and NDC80
complexes are ubiquitous. In budding yeast, linker complexes
are thought to form a bridge between proteins in direct contact with DNA and those that bind MTs [5,14,15], and it will
be important to show that this is also true in other organisms.
Prior to the current work, biochemical experiments had led to
the identification of SPC105, MIND and NDC80 complexes in
S. pombe, C. elegans and human cells [18,19] but our
systematic sequence analysis extends these observations to a
greater variety of organisms, including E. cuniculi, a microsporidium with a remarkably small proteome. The presence
of the structural kinetochore proteins listed above appears to
be more fundamental for chromosome segregation than a
Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint, which does
not seem to exist in E. cuniculi. Thus, ascertaining the precise
molecular functions of the MIND complex, NDC80 complex,

reviews

For the majority of kinetochore proteins we have little knowledge of their biochemical functions or their structure. It is
tempting to speculate that conserved sequence blocks represent protein-protein interaction domains or interaction surfaces under tight evolutionary pressure. However, with very
few exceptions (for example, the kinase domains of checkpoint and regulatory proteins and motor domains of kinesins), blocks of conserved sequence do not correspond to
recognizable functional domains. This stands in contrast to
the situation in nuclear pore complexes, in which highly conserved and recognizable domains correspond to key functional units [72]. The most abundant structural elements in
kinetochore proteins are coiled coils, which are known to
function in protein-protein association [73] and act as springs
and levers [74]. Coiled coils in the budding yeast spindle pole
body protein scSpc42 also create a crystalline core involved in
spindle pole body duplication [75]. Biochemical and electron
microscopy experiments have shown that the heptad repeat
domains in all four subunits of the S. cerevisiae NDC80
complex associate to form an extended stalk that is linked to
two globular heads [32,33]. Whether the stalk is simply a
spacer or some sort of mechanical element remains unexplored. Only detailed structural and biochemical experiments, backed up by analysis in vivo, will reveal the logic of
sequence conservation among kinetochore subunits.

comment

RNA-templated reverse transcriptase to replicate telomeres,
D. melanogaster uses an alternative mechanism based on
transposition of the HeT-A and TART retrotransposable elements [71]. It seems very likely that several distinct classes of
kinetochore arose early in evolution. Perhaps surprisingly,
fungal kinetochores appear to be as good a model for their
human counterparts as kinetochores in organisms such as
worms and flies.

Meraldi et al.

Spc105, CenH3 and CENP-C and of the macromolecular
assemblies in which they participate is a key task in the study
of kinetochore biology.

Diverged kinetochore components
Budding yeast with CDEI-II-III point CENs contain a set of 11
proteins that are not present in fungi such as S. pombe or C.
albicans (Figure 11). Three of the eleven point-CEN specific
proteins are involved in sequence-specific binding to CDEIII
while six are part of the COMA complex or of a COMAdependent assembly pathway. Only three of the eleven components of the COMA pathway in S. cerevisiae (Mcm21Mal2,
Chl4Mis15 and Ctf3Mis6/CENP-I) are conserved among fungi and
mammalian kinetochores (Figure 11). In S. pombe, an alternative set of eight proteins, including spSim4 and spFta1-7,
are bound to the COMA components spMcm21Mal2,
spChl4Mis15 and spMis6Ctf3. At least three of these proteins
(CENP-HFta3, Fta1 and Sim4) are members of a class of proteins found in fungal and metazoan organisms with regional
CENs whereas the other four proteins have no obvious
orthologs (Figure 11a). Overall, these data point to COMA and
COMA-associated proteins as kinetochore components with a
particularly high degree of sequence divergence through evolution. It seems reasonable to speculate that COMA helps to
accommodate kinetochore subunits that are highly conserved
among regional and point CENs, such as the NDC80 complex,
to diverged components, such as CBF3. By analogy, it seems
likely that specialized proteins have evolved to meet the
special structural demands of holocentric CENs; ceKNL-3, a
kinetochore protein bound to the C. elegans MIND and
NDC80 complexes [18] but absent from other kinetochores,
may be an early example of a holocentric adaptor.

The logic of kinetochore assembly
The MT binding components of kinetochores are unlike kinetochore structural components in that almost all are involved
in multiple MT-based processes (Figure 11). In humans for
example, EB1Bim1 and APCKar9 are found not only at kinetochores, but also at sites of MT association with the cell cortex;
CLIP-170Bik1 and Dynein play important roles in vesicle trafficking and ch-Tog1Stu2 is required for spindle assembly. From
yeast to humans, only one or two of the six to ten kinetochore
MAPs and motors are specific to kinetochores. CENP-A functions in most organisms to determine CEN location without
recognizing CEN-specific sequences; similarly, the NDC80MIND-SPC105-COMA complexes must determine the
specialized biochemistry of MT-kinetochore linkages without
resort to many kinetochore-specific MAPs.

Conclusion

We conclude that critical structural features of kinetochores
are conserved from yeast to man, despite highly divergent
CEN sequences. It appears that both short S. cerevisiae point
centromeres and complex metazoan regional centromeres
arose from a common ancestor that probably had regional

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/3/r23

centromeres. Both simple and complex kinetochores contain
conserved SPC105, MIND and NDC80 complexes along with
more variable COMA complexes. This core assembly is supplemented by adaptor proteins specific to organisms with
point, regional or holocentric CENs. The key to understanding kinetochore biology is now to determine how specialized
adaptors and conserved core complexes interact with inner
centromere components such as CenH3 and CENP-C to
assemble structures capable of binding to and regulating
microtubules through the recruitment of MAPs and motors.

Materials and methods
Sequence-similarity searches
Database searches were performed on NCBI non-redundant
and EST databases using PSI-BLAST and BLAST (proteinprotein BLAST (blastp) and genomic BLAST (tblastn)) [76].
Pattern searches were performed using ScanProsite [77].
Multiple sequence alignments were built with ClustalW,
MUSCLE and T-Coffee and edited by hand [78-80]. Coiled
coil predictions were based on the COILS program using a
window size of 28 [81]. Human Nnf1R and Fta1R were identified in PSI-BLAST searches using the full-length S. pombe
Fta1 or S. cerevisiae Nnf1 protein sequences as the queries. To
identify human Mcm21R, the S. cerevisiae Mcm21 protein
sequence was first used as a query in PSI-BLAST searches
that yielded fungal Mcm21 related proteins. These proteins
were assembled in a multiple sequence alignment from which
the motif [HYF]- [KRHDENQ]- [VLI]-x- [HYF]- [ST]- [IVL][P]-x-x- [IL]-x- [ILV] was derived, and then used in a pattern
search to identify metazoan orthologs. To identify orthologs
of S. cerevisiae Nsl1 and Chl4, S. pombe Sim4 or H. sapiens
CENP-H conserved blocks were first identified. PSI-BLAST
searches were carried out using S. pombe Sim4, S. cerevisiae
Nsl1, S. cerevisiae Chl4 or H. sapiens CENP-H as query
sequences. This approach identified a set of fungal Sim4, Nsl1
or Chl4 related proteins and a set of metazoan CENP-H
related proteins. Each set of proteins was then assembled into
multiple sequence alignments and conserved blocks identified (amino acids 1 to 143 for U. maydis Nsl1, 1 to 114 for S.
cerevisiae Chl4, 341 to 373 for S. pombe Sim4 and 224 to 269
for H. sapiens CENP-H). The sequences present in these conserved blocks were then used in PSI-BLAST searches to identify new fungal (for CENP-H) or metazoan (for Sim4, Chl4 or
Nsl1) proteins.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic alignments were generated with MUSCLE using
GBlocks to identify conserved blocks [82]. Conserved blocks
were selected only if single positions were conserved in at
least 50% of the sequences, with higher stringency at flanking
positions (80%). A maximum of eight contiguous non-conserved positions were allowed. The minimum block length
was five amino acids. Positions with gaps were allowed only if
their number did not exceed 50%. Conserved blocks and the
number of positions used for each protein family are

described in Additional data file 5. To calculate the distances
between sequences we took a maximum likelihood approach
using TREE-PUZZLE [83] with the 'Pairwise distance calculation only' option, the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution
matrix [84] and gamma-distributed rates (eight categories) to
account for rate heterogeneity (parameters were estimated
from the dataset). A neighbor-joining tree was constructed
from the distance matrix with the NEIGHBOR program from
the PHYLIP package [85]. Reliability of the dataset was
assessed by bootstrap. We generated 100 permutation datasets using the SEQBOOT program from the PHYLIP package.
From these 100 datasets we calculated distance matrices and
constructed neighbor-joining trees using the parameters
described above. TREE-PUZZLE was then used with the
'Consensus of user defined trees' option to generate a consensus tree from all neighbor-joining trees (nodes with support
less than 50% were collapsed) [86]. Trees were visualized
using the SPLITS TREE tool [87]. Amino acid similarity
percentages used in multiple sequence alignments are given

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 contains accession
numbers of all proteins that are used in this study. Additional
data file 2 shows the multiple sequence alignment of S. cerevisiae Spc34, a subunit of the multi-protein DASH complex,
with a set of fungal orthologs and a set of related metazoan
proteins (NYD-Sp28 family). Additional data file 3 contains
multiple sequence alignments of the E. cuniculi kinetochore

interactions

Given the identification of CDEI and CDEII sequence elements, a third sub-model searched for an adjacent CDEIII
motif using an expression based on the highly conserved
CCGGAA motif. Positive hits were evaluated with the bit score
calculated from the CDEII HMM, length distribution, AT
length, AT runs and synteny.

The point CEN model was constructed from three different
sub-models based on the known structure of point CENs. The
first sub-model searched for CDEI-like regions in the query
sequence using the [T|G]CA[C|G|T][A|C|G]TG motif. The
second sub-model then searched for adjacent CDEII-like AT
rich regions. The CDEII region was modeled with a HMM
using CDEII from S. cerevisiae [88]. For the negative model,
S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was used (the effect of including
CENs in the genomic DNA was disregarded). For both datasets, base transition frequencies were determined and the
transition matrix for the HMM was calculated. The quality of
the HMM was evaluated by screening annotated budding
yeast genomes and assessment with a bit score:
