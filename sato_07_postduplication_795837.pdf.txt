Abstract
Background: The partitioning of ancestral functions among duplicated genes by neutral evolution,
or subfunctionalization, has been considered the primary process for the evolution of novel
proteins (neofunctionalization). Nonetheless, how a subfunctionalized protein can evolve into a
more adaptive protein is poorly understood, mainly due to the limitations of current analytical
methods, which can detect only strong selection for amino acid substitutions involved in adaptive
molecular evolution. In this study, we employed a comparative evolutionary approach to this
question, focusing on differences in the structural properties of a protein, specifically the electric
charge, encoded by fish-specific duplicated phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) genes.
Results: Full-length cDNA cloning, RT-PCR based gene expression analyses, and comparative
sequence analyses showed that after subfunctionalization with respect to the expression organ of
duplicate Pgi genes, the net electric charge of the PGI-1 protein expressed mainly in internal tissues
became more negative, and that of PGI-2 expressed mainly in muscular tissues became more
positive. The difference in net protein charge was attributable not to specific amino acid sites but
to the sum of various amino acid sites located on the surface of the PGI molecule.
Conclusion: This finding suggests that the surface charge evolution of PGI proteins was not driven
by strong selection on individual amino acid sites leading to permanent fixation of a particular
residue, but rather was driven by weak selection on a large number of amino acid sites and
consequently by steady directional and/or purifying selection on the overall structural properties
of the protein, which is derived from many modifiable sites. The mode of molecular evolution
presented here may be relevant to various cases of adaptive modification in proteins, such as
hydrophobic properties, molecular size, and electric charge.

Background
Proteins that arise through gene duplication can become
novel proteins through fixation of beneficial mutations
[1], but because beneficial mutations are generally rare,
the partitioning of ancestral functions among duplicated

genes by neutral evolution, or subfunctionalization, has
been considered the primary process for the evolution of
novel proteins [2-5]. To date, many duplicate genes have
been demonstrated to evolve following this model of subfunctionalization, and this model thus has become widely

evolution of novel protein properties after subfunctionalization.

Nonetheless, how a more adaptive or specialized protein
property evolves after subfunctionalization is poorly
understood, mainly due to the limited resolution power
of current analytical methods, which seek to detect positive selection on individual amino acid substitutions
involved in adaptive molecular evolution. Such methods
can recognize substitutions expected to be driven by
strong selection, many of which are usually function-altering substitutions at important amino acid sites, such as
enzyme active sites or viral epitopes [e.g., [11]]. However,
adaptive substitutions by relatively moderate or weak
selection may not be recognized by these methods. Therefore, to detect adaptive protein evolution under a much
wider range of selection pressure, a novel approach is
required. In this study, we utilized a comparative evolutionary approach to this problem, focusing on differences
in the high-dimensional properties of a protein, specifically the electric charge, encoded by a pair of duplicated
genes.

In this study, we examined first whether the spatial expression patterns of duplicated Pgi genes in ray-finned fishes
are compatible with predictions based on the subfunctionalization model of duplicate gene evolution. Next, by
focusing on the electric charges of the PGI proteins, we
analyzed the underlying evolutionary process producing
novel protein properties after gene duplication through
ancestral sequence inference using the maximum likelihood (ML) method based on a reliable phylogenetic
framework of ray-finned fishes, and also using threedimensional (3-D) structural information on the protein.

As a model protein system for this study, we chose an
important enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9). The
gene encoding this enzyme (Pgi) is present as a single copy
in tetrapods, whereas two copies exist in most groups of
ray-finned fishes [12-14]. The fact that these duplicated
Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 genes in fishes are expressed in different
organs [12,15] implies that these fish-specific duplicate
Pgi genes are subfunctionalized with respect to their
expression, and are thus good candidates for the model of
subfunctionalized genes. For ray-finned fishes, a reliable
phylogenetic framework, which is essential for comparative evolutionary analyses, is available due to recent
progress in molecular phylogenetic studies [16-21]. In
addition, the basal lineages of ray-finned fishes, including
Semionotiformes (gar fish) and Amiiformes (amia), have
only one Pgi locus [12]. This single-copy gene may be the
direct descendant of the ancestral unduplicated Pgi in rayfinned fishes, and thus can be considered an appropriate
outgroup gene for comparison between the duplicated Pgi
genes.
The Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 genes, which were expected to be subfunctionalized in their expression, also differ in the net
electric charge of their encoded proteins [12,13,15]. The
electric charge of soluble proteins such as PGIs is a structural property brought by a large number of multiple
amino acid residues and is involved in the adaptive evolution of several soluble proteins [e.g., [22-24]], such as an
acquisition of protein thermostability [25-27]. Therefore,
the evolution of electric charge in the duplicated PGI proteins is an interesting subject to investigate regarding the

Results
Duplication and subfunctionalization of the Pgi genes in
teleost fishes
Our molecular phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate Pgi
genes showed that the Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 genes in teleost
fishes resulted from a gene duplication event that
occurred before the radiation of teleosts but after the separation of basal non-teleost ray-finned fishes (Figure 1A,
arrow). The Pgi duplication appears to have derived from
the ancient teleost genome duplication [28-30] because
the phylogenetic position of the Pgi duplication confirmed here is the same as that of the estimated teleostspecific genome duplication event [31,32], and gene content around the Pgi locus in the human genome is partly
conserved in the corresponding regions of both zebrafish
Pgi loci (on chromosomes 13 and 25) [see Additional file
1: Fig. S1], which rules out the possibility of a tandem or
single-gene duplication of the Pgi in teleosts. This condition allows us to study the duplicated Pgi genes without
considering interlocus concerted evolution, which complicates the analysis of functional divergence in duplicated genes.

A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)-based expression analysis showed that the Pgi gene
in non-teleost ray-finned fishes was expressed in all tissues examined (Figure 1B), confirming that this gene is
the direct descendant of the ancestral unduplicated Pgi
with no tissue specificity, as in tetrapods [12,13,15]. In
contrast, the teleost Pgi-1 gene was expressed mainly in
internal organs, including the liver, heart, gill, brain, and
kidney, and weakly in the muscle, whereas Pgi-2 was
expressed mainly in the heart and muscle. The differential
expression patterns of Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 support the concept
of subfunctionalization [2,3], which is the complementary loss of subsets in the expression organs of the ancestral gene. Thus, the Pgi gene family in ray-finned fishes is
an appropriate model for studying molecular evolution
after subfunctionalization.

Evolution of the electric charges of duplicated PGI
proteins in teleost fishes
The Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 genes in teleosts, which are subfunctionalized with respect to their expression, differed significantly in the predicted electric charge of their encoded
proteins (P = 0.0040, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 12; see
Table 1). The estimated isoelectric points (pI) of PGI-1
were 6.21â6.36 (average, 6.31), and those of PGI-2 were
6.75â7.36 (average, 7.17), with no overlap. In contrast to
this clear difference, the PGI enzyme active sites in both
isoforms (Ile156, Gly158, Ser159, Ala208, Ser209, Loop
210â214, Thr217, Arg272, Gln353, Glu357, His388,

Gln511, Helix 512â520, and Lys518; [33]) were totally
conserved among all fishes and tetrapods examined [see
Additional file 1: Fig. S2]. Moreover, no significant difference was observed in peptide length or predicted overall
hydrophobicity between the two isoforms [see Table 1].
The estimated pI values for the ancestral PGI in non-teleosts were intermediate (6.62â6.84; average, 6.78).
Between PGI-1 and PGI-2, 76 amino acid sites differed by
the presence or absence of hydrophilic charged residues
[Lys (K), Arg (R), Asp (D), and Glu (E)], which mainly
contribute to net protein charge (Figure 2B). These sites
were not fixed for a unique charge state in the examined
PGI-1 or PGI-2 proteins, except at position 294 (Gln in
PGI-1 and Lys in PGI-2). Furthermore, only a few unique
charged sites were shared among two or more genealogically related isoforms: five in PGI-1 (positions 27, 61, 78,
199, and 454) and two in PGI-2 (positions 17 and 226).
These observations imply that very few specific amino
acid residues were acquired in the early ancestral proteins
and involved in the differences in electric charges between
current PGI-1 and PGI-2.
The underlying process of the electric charge evolution of
the PGI proteins can be inferred by ML sequence reconstructions [34] based on the recent ray-finned fish phylogeny [18]. We applied this approach and show the results
in Figure 2A. Our results suggest that after gene duplication, pI values in the PGI-1 clade gradually decreased,
whereas those in the PGI-2 clade increased. Next, we
assigned charge-changing substitutions (between Lys/Arg
or Asp/Glu and other residues) to the tree branches based
on pairwise sequence comparisons among the inferred
ancestral sequences or between the extant and ancestral
sequences along the tree topology. This result of assignment (Figure 2C) showed that the charge-changing substitutions were inferred to have occurred in excess (5â28) of
that expected (3â5) for parsimonious evolution in electric
charge differences between PGI-1 and PGI-2 (Figure 2C;
see also Table 1). Figure 2C also shows that the chargechanging substitutions have occurred in both directions
(either upward or downward) on most branches at various amino acid sites (76 sites shown in Figure 2B) [see
Additional file 1: Table S1]. An analysis using parsimony
yielded similar results [see Additional file 1: Fig. S3].
Statistical analyses of the spatial clustering of inferred
amino acid substitutions
Based on 3-D structural information on the PGI protein
molecule, we further examined whether the inferred
charge-changing substitutions were actually involved in
the evolution of electric charge. The results of this analysis
on the inferred substitution sites and number of substitutions are shown in Figure 3A and 3B, respectively. Figure
3A shows that the inferred charge-changing substitution

amino acid sequences translated from the cDNA sequences of Pgi genes using the ProtParam tool [49]
2Differences in number of positively and negatively charged residues in each PGI protein

sites after the Pgi gene duplication (colored in magenta)
were concentrated at the surface of the PGI molecule, in
contrast to the inferred charge-neutral substitution sites
(colored in dark gray) that contribute little or nothing to
net protein charge. The inferred number of charge-changing and charge-neutral substitutions that can potentially
occur at identical sites also followed the same trend (Figure 3B).
However, because water-soluble proteins such as PGI are
generally surrounded by a hydrophilic shell containing a
high density of polar residues, it is natural to expect the
charge-changing substitutions to occur more frequently

on the surface without any selection. Considering this
expected mutation bias, further analysis was performed
(Table 2; for details, see Methods). This comparison of
theoretically expected and ML-inferred numbers of
charge-changing and charge-neutral substitutions imply
that charge-neutral substitutions have occurred more frequently than expected at the molecular surface [MLinferred value, 63.1% = 277/(162 + 277); expected value,
55.5% = 230.17/(184.46 + 230.17)], consistent with the
general observation that molecular evolutionary rates are
faster at the surface than in the interior portions of watersoluble proteins [35,36]. However, what is most important in this table is that the proportion of charge-changing

substitutions concentrated at the surface of the PGI molecule is much greater than that expected by chance [MLinferred value, 97.2% = 141/(4 + 141); expected value,
78.8% = 133.45/(35.92 + 133.45)]. These charge-changing substitutions do not appear to be derived from differential neutral evolution of base composition or codon
usage between Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 genes, as demonstrated by
the fact that GC content and codon usage frequencies are
not significantly different between Pgi-1 and Pgi-2 (GC
content: P = 0.0782, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 12; rank
order of codon usage: rs = 0.9509, n = 64).

Discussion
The results of phylogenetic analysis, RT-PCR-based
expression analysis, and sequence comparison of Pgi
genes in teleost fishes suggest that after subfunctionalization of the duplicated Pgi genes in the ancestor of teleost
fishes, the electric charges of the PGI-1 and PGI-2 proteins
diverged. This evolution can be interpreted according to
the sub-neofunctionalization model of gene evolution [25], which proposes that the partitioning of function

between the duplicated genes alters the selective environment at each locus, resulting in structural fine-tuning or
adaptation of the encoded proteins by positive selection.
That is, the divergent evolution of the electric charges in
the duplicated PGI isoforms is the consequence of specialization for the specific function (glycolysis or gluconeogenesis) or distinct cellular environment of tissues where
each isoform is predominantly expressed (see Figure 1B),
as suggested for other water-soluble proteins [22-24].
The present comparative evolutionary analysis implies
that since the gene duplication event, the electric charges
of the two PGI isoforms changed steadily through many
charge-changing substitutions in both directions of charge
change; only a few charged amino acid sites were specific
to PGI-1 or PGI-2 (Figure 2). Such charge-changing substitutions concentrated at the surface of PGI molecule (Figure 3) were inferred to have occurred much more
frequently than expected in the parsimonious evolution
of electric charge difference between the two isoforms (see
Figure 2C and Table 1). From these observations, two pos-

site classes based on solvent accessibility (horizontal axis): this proportion significantly increases with solvent-accessible surface
area (P = 0.0000, Cochran â Armitage trend test, n = 584).

sible scenarios are proposed for the evolution of protein
charge in duplicated PGI isoforms: protein charges in PGI1 decreased gradually, while those in PGI-2 increased;
alternatively, charge divergence between PGI-1 and PGI-2
was completed soon after the duplication and before the
radiation of teleosts, followed by maintenance of the protein charges under purifying selection, while stochastic
charge-changing substitutions by drift occurred among
lineages. In either scenario, we can conclude that the surface charge evolution of PGI proteins was not driven by
strong selection on individual amino acid sites leading to
permanent fixation of a particular residue, but rather was

driven by weak selection on a large number of amino acid
sites and consequently by steady directional or purifying
selection on the overall structural properties of the protein, which is derived from many modifiable sites. This
mode of molecular evolution agrees with the understanding that most proteins are substantially tolerant of a broad
spectrum of substitutions and thus may harbor many
amino acid sites available for evolutionary modification
[37]. Our study provides the first plausible evidence of
adaptive protein evolution through such selection.

The mode of molecular evolution proposed in this study
would be difficult to find using existing methods that
detect strong selection for particular substitutions. We
applied such an analysis to identify positively selected
sites after Pgi gene duplication using DIVERGE version
1.04 [38]; however, the results were not clear (data not
shown). Further analysis using the program CODEML
[34] did not detect the acceleration of the rate of nonsynonymous substitution, not showing selection for amino
acid changes (estimated Ï was 0.01 to 0.23). Even if, in
general, a significant excess of amino acid change is
detected, such methodology itself cannot rule out possible confounding effects, or alternative interpretations,
particularly the relax of purifying selection [39]. In a previous study, an analysis using the program HonNew [40]
also failed to detect selection for charge-changing substitutions in teleost PGIs, leading to the conclusion that the
charge change in the duplicate PGIs of teleosts may be
selectively neutral [13]. The mode of molecular evolution
presented here, in which diverse evolutionary resolutions
exist at the level of a primary sequence that corresponds to
a certain selective pressure on a protein property, may be
relevant to various cases of adaptive modification in proteins, such as hydrophobic properties, molecular size, and
electric charge. This may be an important pathway underlying physiological adaptation, along with protein evolution by simple amino-acid changes, gene deletion or
silencing, and possibly cis-regulatory changes [39,41].

Conclusion
In this paper, we provide the evidence that relatively weak
selection on a large number of amino acid sites drives the
evolution of novel charge-state of duplicated phosphoglucose isomerases, which are subfunctionalized in teleost
fishes. Such mode of adaptive molecular evolution, which
was hardly recognizable by existing analytical methods
aiming to detect strong selection on individual amino
acid changes, may play a substantial role in the evolution
of novel proteins.

was amplified using PCR with vertebrate universal degenerate primers [13]. The well amplified DNA fragments
were purified using a MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen),
ligated into the pGEM-T Easy Vector system (Promega),
transmitted into competent E. coli (Competent High
DH5a, Toyobo), and sequenced with an ABI PRISM 3100
(Applied Biosystems) using T7 or SP6 primers. The partial
Pgi sequences were used to design gene-specific primers
(GSPs) for RACE PCR [see Additional file 1: Table S2]; 3'
RACE PCR was conducted with the sense GSP and M13
primer M4 (TaKaRa) and the first-strand cDNA as the template. For 5' RACE, double-stranded cDNA PCR libraries
were synthesized from 1 Âµg of total RNA using the cDNA
synthesis kit (M-MLV version; TaKaRa) combined with
the cDNA PCR library kit (TaKaRa). Then, 5' RACE PCR
was conducted with the antisense GSP and CA primer
(TaKaRa). Subcloning and sequencing were performed as
above.
Phylogenetic analysis
The Pgi genes from 20 vertebrates were phylogenetically
analyzed with the Bayesian and ML methods using the
programs MrBayes 3.0B4 [42] and PAUP 4.0b10 [43],
respectively. The species used [GenBank accession numbers or Ensembl Transcript IDs of the Pgi gene(s)] were as
follows: bichir (AB282684*), sturgeon (AB282688*),
amia (AB282681*), gar (AB282687*), arowana (Pgi-1:
AB282682* and Pgi-2: AB282683*), eel (Pgi-1:
AB282685* and Pgi-2: AB282686*), smelt (Pgi-1:
AB282690* and Pgi-2: AB282691*), zebrafish (Pgi-1:
AJ306395 and Pgi-2: AJ306396), mullet (Pgi-1: AJ306392
and
Pgi-2:
AJ306393),
fugu
(Pgi-1:
NEWSINFRUT00000145974 and AB282689*, and Pgi-2:
NEWSINFRUT00000159975), Homo sapiens (human;
K03515), Sus scrofa (pig; X07382), Oryctolagus cuniculus
(rabbit; AF199601), Cricetulus griseus (hamster; Z37977),
Mus musculus (mouse; M1422), Rattus norvegicus (rat;
ENSRNOT00000032613), Gallus
gallus
(chicken;
ENSGALT00000007948), Boiga
kraepelini
(snake;
AJ306394), Bufo melanostictus (toad; AJ306397), and Paramyxine yangi (hagfish; AJ306391). Newly cloned
sequences in this study (marked with asterisks) were
named under the denomination of PGI isozymes [12].
Bayesian and ML trees were constructed under the GTR +
I + Î model [44], which was selected as the best-fitting
model of nucleotide substitution by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) [45,46] with 1100 base pairs (bp)
of the Pgi coding region (excluding the third codon position) [see Additional file 1: Fig. S4]. The Bayesian posterior probabilities of the phylogeny and its branches were

determined from 9901 trees. Support for heuristic ML
analysis was assessed using 100 bootstrap replications.
Synteny analysis
The genomic regions around the Pgi locus (or loci) in the
human, chicken, and zebrafish genomes were investigated
and compared. Genomic data from the pufferfishes Fugu
rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis were not useful in this
analysis because the locations of their Pgi loci were not
determined. Data on the neighborhood of the Pgi locus in
the human and chicken genomes were obtained from the
NCBI Mapviewer Web site [47]. Twenty-seven proteincoding genes were identified around the human PGI
locus, within a 1.8-Mb-long region on chromosome 19.
The nucleotide sequences of these human genes were subjected to BLASTN searches against the zebrafish genome
sequences using the Ensembl BLASTN search service [48].
The matches detected with an E-value threshold of <10-3
were checked visually. Then, we selected identifiable
genes described as putative orthologs of the queries. Their
genomic location data were used to rebuild the synteny
maps around the zebrafish Pgi loci.
Gene expression analysis
RT-PCR was performed for expression analysis of the Pgi
genes. The primers used are described in [see Additional
file 1: Table S3]. They were designed as follows: to distinguish the duplicate Pgi loci in teleosts, the 3' region of one
primer from each primer pair was made to locate the differential nucleotide site between the two loci of the species concerned, and to avoid false amplification from
genomic DNA contaminants, each primer pair was
designed to span a Pgi exon/intron boundary considered
conservative among vertebrates. Total RNA was extracted
from liver, skeletal muscle, heart, gill filament, brain, and
kidney (or gonad) tissues of fresh fish samples. RNA
extraction, reverse-transcription into first-strand cDNA
and PCR were performed in the same manner as mentioned in the Cloning and sequencing section. The thermalcycle profile was as follows: 1 cycle at 94Â°C for 2 min; 30
cycles at 94Â°C for 30 sec, 60Â°C for 30 sec, and 72Â°C for
30 sec; followed by 1 cycle at 72Â°C for 7 min. As a positive
control for gene expression, Î²-actin cDNA was amplified
using the primers 5'-GACATGGAGAAGATCTGGCA-3'
and 5'-TGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGT-3' (predicted
product size = 834 bp), which were designed by Dr. Kaoru
Kuriiwa of the National Museum of Nature and Science,
Tokyo. These primer sequences were based on a highly
conserved region of the Î²-actin gene in mangrove killifish,
Rivulus marmoratus (GenBank accession number
AF168615). The amplified DNA fragments were separated
on a 2.0% L03 agarose gel (TaKaRa), stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. GeneRulerâ¢
100 bp DNA Ladder Plus (MBI Fermentas) was used as a
size marker for electrophoresis.

Charge evolution analysis
The ML inference of the ancestral sequences of Pgi genes
was performed by BASEML [34] based on the phylogeny
of ray-finned fishes using whole mitochondrial genome
data [18]. Tetrapods were excluded from this analysis
because of their absence in this tree. Nucleotide sequence
alignments of the coding region of Pgi cDNAs (1650 bp,
without ambiguous regions) from 10 ray-finned fishes
plus hagfish were used. The GTR + Î [44] model was
selected as the best fitting model by the hLRTs [see Additional file 1: Table S4]. The average overall accuracy of the
reconstructed sequences (#1â#15) [see Additional file 1:
Appendix] was 0.948 Â± 0.003 SE. The pI values were estimated from the deduced amino acid sequences using the
ProtParam tool [49]. The solvent-accessible surface area
(SASA) of each amino acid residue was estimated with
GETAREA 1.1 [50] for the dimeric PGI protein structure
using a solvent radius of 1.4 Ã (approximately the size of
a water molecule). Rabbit PGI [PDB: 1XTB] [33] was used
as a reference structure. The structural portion of the PGI
composed of amino acid residues with more than 20 Ã 2
SASA was considered "molecular surface." This boundary
mostly agrees with other criteria based on the ratio of sidechain surface area to random coil value per residue [50].
A three-dimensional graphical model of the PGI molecule
was constructed using RasMol [51].
Calculation of the expected spatial distribution of amino
acid substitutions
To determine which model of amino acid substitution
provided the best fit to the data (550-amino-acid
sequence of PGIs from 11 fishes and the known phylogenetic framework of ray-finned fishes [18]), likelihood
ratio tests were conducted among pairs of five models
mounted in PAML 3.13d [34]. Parameters F and Î were
incorporated in this analysis. As a result, the amino acid
substitution matrix JTT [52] gave the highest likelihood
score (lnL = -5851.41); the second-best matrix was Dayhoff [53] (lnL = -5865.41). Using the JTT matrix (mij),
transition rates between pairs of amino acids (Pij) were
calculated by the equation

Pij =

mij fi Âµi

â j= Ala mij
Val

, (i â  j)

where fi is the normalized frequency and Âµi is the relative
mutability of each amino acid. The parameter fi was estimated separately for the surface and interior portions of
the inferred common ancestral protein of PGI-1 and PGI2 (node #5 in Figure 2C) to consider differential amino
acid composition in different parts of the protein [see
Additional file 1: Table S5]. Based on the resultant Pij, we
estimated the theoretical ratio of the charge-changing substitutions to charge-neutral substitutions (Î£Pcharge-changing:

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:204

Î£Pcharge-neutral) of the surface (r1:r2) and interior (r3:r4) portions of the PGI protein molecule under the assumption
of random mutation.
According to the null hypothesis that all pairs of amino
acid substitutions occur regardless of their spatial locations, the amino acid substitution events would be spatially distributed into the surface and interior portions of
the PGI protein along the ratio of the numbers of amino
acid substitution sites at the surface (132 sites) to the interior (80 sites) of the PGI protein since their gene duplication. Accounting for the spatial-differential amino acid
composition as described above, the expected spatial distribution of amino acid substitutions shown in Table 2
was estimated based on the ratio of charge-changing substitutions in the molecular surface:charge-neutral substitutions in the molecular surface:charge-changing
substitutions in the molecular interior:charge-neutral substitutions
