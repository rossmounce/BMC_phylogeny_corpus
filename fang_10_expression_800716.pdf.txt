Abstract
Background: The relationships between parasitoids and their insect hosts have attracted attention at two levels.
First, the basic biology of host-parasitoid interactions is of fundamental interest. Second, parasitoids are widely used
as biological control agents in sustainable agricultural programs. Females of the gregarious endoparasitoid
Pteromalus puparum (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) inject venom along with eggs into their hosts. P. puparum does
not inject polydnaviruses during oviposition. For this reason, P. puparum and its pupal host, the small white
butterfly Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), comprise an excellent model system for studying the influence of an
endoparasitoid venom on the biology of the pupal host. P. puparum venom suppresses the immunity of its host,
although the suppressive mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that P.
puparum venom influences host gene expression in the two main immunity-conferring tissues, hemocytes and fat
body.
Results: At 1 h post-venom injection, we recorded significant decreases in transcript levels of 217 EST clones
(revealing 113 genes identified in silico, including 62 unknown contigs) derived from forward subtractive libraries of
host hemocytes and in transcript levels of 288 EST clones (221 genes identified in silico, including 123 unknown
contigs) from libraries of host fat body. These genes are related to insect immune response, cytoskeleton, cell cycle
and apoptosis, metabolism, transport, stress response and transcriptional and translational regulation. We verified
the reliability of the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) data with semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of a set
of randomly selected genes. This analysis showed that most of the selected genes were down-regulated after
venom injection.
Conclusions: Our findings support our hypothesis that P. puparum venom influences gene expression in host
hemocytes and fat body. Specifically, the venom treatments led to reductions in expression of a large number of
genes. Many of the down-regulated genes act in immunity, although others act in non-immune areas of host
biology. We conclude that the actions of venom on host gene expression influence immunity as well as other
aspects of host biology in ways that benefit the development and emergence of the next generation of
parasitoids.

Background
In all developmental stages, insects are challenged by a
broad range of natural enemies, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa as well as various metazoan parasites [1-3]. Insects have effective innate immune
responses to contend with foreign invaders. Invasions by
foreign organisms trigger several immune response signaling pathways, including Toll and IMD pathways [4].
These and other pathways lead to expression of
immune-related genes [5]. Insect immune systems
include physical barriers to invasion as well as cellular
and humoral immune responses [4,6,7]. Cellular immunity involves direct interactions between hemocytes and
invaders. These interactions begin immediately after an
invasion is detected and they include phagocytosis,
nodule formation and, in the case of large invaders such
as parasitoid eggs, encapsulation [6]. Humoral responses
include synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
mainly by fat body cells and hemocytes. These peptides
appear in the hemolymph of infected insects, 6-12 h
post-infection and it has been suggested that these proteins serve a “mop-up” phase of responding to infections
[8]. Humoral immunity also involves prophenoloxidase
(pro-PO) activating cascades, which mediate blood coagulation and melanization [9]. The distinction between
cellular and humoral immune reactions is a matter of
convenience and somewhat artificial as there are substantial interactions between cellular and humoral
immune responses [10].
Oviposition into a host haemocoel stimulates host
immune responses. Non-permissive hosts effectively
encapsulate and kill the parasitoid’s eggs. However,
hymenopteran parasitoids and their hosts have coevolved sophisticated relationships. Parasitoids express
virulence factors that act to impair or circumvent host
immunity and thereby facilitate pre-imaginal development within the host [11-14]. These factors include
polydnaviruses (PDVs), venoms, virus-like particles
(VLPs), ovarian fluids and teratocytes [15,16]. Parasitoid/host interactions are not completely understood at
the molecular level, although the roles of PDVs in
impairing host defenses have received considerable
attention [11,17]. As an example, the Hyposoter didymator ichnovirus (HdIV) influences several aspects of host
immune functions, including gene regulation [18],
impairing host encapsulation reaction [19], and reducing
pro-PO activity [20,21]. The venom associated with
injecting parasitoid eggs into their hosts is another virulence factor. Unlike the venom from spiders, scorpions
or social hymenoptera, which cause neural paralysis and
other pathological events [22], the venom from parasitoids disables host immunity and/or manipulates host
physiology to create an environment favorable for the

Page 2 of 17

development of the parasitoid [15,20,23]. For instance,
Leptopilina boulardi venom inhibits the host immune
responses [12], due to immune suppressing factors in
the venom, Rho-GAP protein [13] and serpin [24],
which suppress host hemocyte changes and pro-PO cascade, respectively. Nasonia vitripennis venom contains a
phenoloxidase (PO) activity that may be toxic to the
host hemocytes [25]. Generally, there is less knowledge,
particularly at the level of gene expression, on parasitoid
venom relative to literature on PDVs.
The gregarious parasitoid, Pteromalus puparum is a
pupal parasitoid of Pieris rapae, a vegetable pest worldwide. This parasitoid injects venom, but not PDVs, into
its hosts during oviposition. P. puparum and its pupal
host P. rapae comprise a model system for research into
the influence of venom on host biology in non-PDV system [26,27]. P. puparum venom causes significant
alteration in total number and morphology of host
hemocytes, and inhibits host cellular immune responses
[28]. Although these visible effects of the venom have
been recorded, information on the molecular mechanisms of venom actions is lacking. To begin investigating
this lack, we posed the hypothesis that P. puparum
venom influences gene expression in the main immunity-conferring tissues of its host, the hemocytes and fat
body. In this paper, we report on the outcomes of
experiments designed to test our hypothesis.

Results and Discussion
Host encapsulation reaction inhibited by parasitoid
venom

To statistically analyze the suppression effect of
P. puparum venom on encapsulation by P. rapae hemcoytes, we created an index of encapsulation, using

Figure 1 Encapsulation analysis. Encapsulation of Sephadex A-50
beads by P. rapae hemocytes. Each histogram represents the mean
encapsulation index, and the error bar represents the standard
deviation of each mean value (mean ± SD, n = 3). All raw data
were transformed by arcsine square root before two-way ANOVA
analysis. Histograms annotated with the same letter are not
significantly different.

abiotic Sephadex A-50 beads as model parasitoid eggs
[29]. The index of encapsulation is a proportion of Sephadex beads encapsulated to measured extents, from 1 to 5,
described below in M&Ms. As shown in Figure 1, the
index of encapsulation was significantly affected by treatments (F = 30.56; df = 3; P = 0.0001), sampling time post
treatments (F = 338.33; df = 1; P = 0.0001) and treatmentsampling time interaction (F = 19.64; df = 3; P = 0.0001).
Sephadex A-50 beads were encapsulated after they were
injected into the host pupae, and the encapsulation
increased from 0.5 hour to 4 hours after injection. The
encapsulation indices after 2 and 4 h incubations were significantly higher than recorded after 0.5 and 1 h incubations. Following venom plus bead injection, the index of
the host encapsulation was significantly decreased compared to bead-only injection. These results indicate that
the influence of venom on encapsulation reactions
occurred very quickly. Venoms from parasitic wasps,
either alone or co-effective with other virulence factors,
have diverse functions, especially in the interference of
host immune response [11,15,20,23]. For some parasitoid
species such as Pimpla hypochondriaca [30] and Nasonia
vitripenns [31] (devoid of PDVs or other symbiotic viruses)
venoms are likely the key active factor in immune suppression. Similarly, venom from P. puparum is an inhibitor of
host immunity [29]. Based on these encapsulation-inhibiting results, we selected 1 h post injection (PI) for beadsonly and beads plus venom for the “tester” and “driver”
cDNA preparations, respectively.
General overview of forward subtractive libraries
prepared from hemocytes and fat body

A subtracted cDNA library was constructed using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). The transcript
levels of these genes were higher in a pool of “tester”
cDNAs (beads-only injection into the host) than those
in a pool of “driver” cDNAs (beads plus venom injection). A total of 384 hemocyte clones and 480 fat body
clones were randomly selected from forward SSH
libraries and subjected to colony PCR and dot-blot
hybridization (Additional File 1). For dot blot hybridization, mRNA samples from hemocytes and fat body (following beads-only and beads plus venom injections)
were labeled by digoxigenin as two sets of probes in
reverse transcriptional reactions. Hybridization was performed using two probes against the purified colony
PCR product blots from two SSH libraries, respectively.
If signals of the blots hybridized with the beads-only
injection probe were stronger than signals with the
venom plus beads injection probe, these clones were
considered positive. A total of 225 hemocyte clones and
296 fat body clones were verified as positive clones,
which were isolated and sequenced. Subsequently, 217
and 288 of available ESTs sequences were obtained

from hemocytes and fat body libraries. The high quality
and non-redundant sequences have been deposited in
the EST database (dbEST) with GenBank accession
numbers from GW316222 to GW316411 and
GW316614 to GW316709. The obtained sequences
were used to BLASTX interrogate the GenBank, EMBL
and DDBJ databases via the National Center for Biotechnology Information. One hundred and thirteen and
221 genes identified in silico were down-regulated in
P. rapae hemocytes and fat body, respectively, 1 h PI of
parasitoid venom (Tables 1 &2). We assorted the genes
into nine groups, including immune response, cytoskeleton, cell cycle and apoptosis, respiration and energy
metabolism, material metabolism, transport, stress
response, and transcriptional and translational regulation as well as unknown contigs (Figures. 2A & 3A). In
hemocyte and fat body SSH libraries, 54% and 56% of
the in silico identified genes, respectively, have either no
significant similarity with database sequences or similarity with hypothetical proteins of unknown function. We
used InterProScan to do an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, and PRINTS databases at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute to seek functional
domains of these unknown genes, finding no domains.
The identified genes similar to known genes in database
in high frequency belong to material metabolism and
immune response groups in hemocyte library (Figure
2B). For the fat body library, the high frequency genes
were assigned to material metabolism and cell cycle and
apoptosis groups (Figure 3B). Genes and their frequency
response after venom injection in hemocytes differed
from those influenced in fat body (Tables 1 &2). In the
venom treated hemocytes we found 17 immune-related
transcripts (15% of the overall genes identified in silico
from the hemocytes SSH library) that were negatively
modulated (Figure 2A). For the venom treated fat body,
13 immune-related transcripts (only 6% from the overall
in silico identified genes) were down regulated (Figure
3A). It appears that host hemocytes are the primary
immunosuppressive targets for the venom. This is reasonable because encapsulation is the principle defense
reaction to endoparasitoid invasions [6]. We identified
in silico only four genes (attacin, lysozyme, pro-PO activating factor III and serpin; Figure 4) down-regulated by
venom for both hemocytes and fat body. Whereas
immune challenges promote gene up-regulation, particularly in humoral pathways, our SSH results show that
many genes are down-regulated by venom. We recognize that down-regulation of a broad spectrum of genes
may reflect a non-specific toxicity rather than mechanistic regulation of specific genes, a subject of future
hypotheses. Nonetheless, SSH is not a genome-wide
analysis, and it is possible that an even richer assembly
of venom target genes were not detected.

Genes related to immune defense
Genes encoding proteins involved in the insect humoral
immune response

Antimicrobial peptides Ten potential antimicrobial
molecules have lower transcript levels in hemocytes or
fat body of the venom injected hosts, including cecropin,
lysozyme, attacin, lebocin, proline-rich AMP, cysteinerich peptide, gallerimycin and immune inducible peptide
(Tables 1 &2). For screening the two SSH libraries, the
full cDNA length sequences of cecropin and lysozyme
of P. rapae were obtained (Additional files 2 & 3), and
we found three isoforms of the cecropins and one of
lysozyme in two subtractive cDNA libraries. Cecropins
have also been identified from dipterans [32], tunicates
[33] and nematodes [34], which have residues in the
consensus region of lepidopteran cecropins. Our multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 2) shows that the P. rapae cecropins are
virtually unrelated to worm cecropins, more closely
related to other lepidopteran cecropins and distant from
dipteran cecropin. Lysozyme is a ubiquitous enzyme
involved in self-defense from bacterial infection [35].
Our results indicate that the lysozyme mRNA is present
in P. rapae hemocytes and fat body. Again, our multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 3) shows that the P. rapae lysozme is related
to other lepidopteran lysozymes. The activity of host
lysozyme is down-regulated by parasitization [21]. For
example, parasitization by Campoletis sonorensis, downregulated plasma lysozyme activity in Heliothis virescens
[36]. Ours is the first report of a transcriptional downregulation of these antimicrobial genes due to endoparasitoid venom. Down-regulation of the immune response
genes expression in the host may be a protective
mechanism for parasitoid eggs.
The prophenoloxidase cascade Our results indicate
that venom down-regulated the pro-PO cascade system
by directly interfering with transcript levels of genes
encoding proteins involved in activating pro-PO. We
found four P. rapae sequences named Pr-PPAEs, similar
to the pro-PO activating enzymes/factors (PPAEs/
PPAFs) in other lepidopterans, three sequences named

Pr-HPs similar to hemolymph proteinases (HPs) of
Manduca sexta, as well as one named Pr-serpin similar
to serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) of Hyphantria
cunea, are down-regulated in the hemocytes or fat body
1 h PI (Tables 1 &2). Insect PO is produced from an
inactive zymogen (pro-PO) by proteolytic cleavage. This
process is mediated by a proteinase cascade plus additional factors, including immulectins [17]. The PPAEs
are serine proteinases (SPs) which directly cleave or
indirectly activate the pro-PO precursor. In M. sexta,
transcription of the pro-PO activating proteinase-1
(PAP-1) gene is up-regulated in both hemocytes and fat
body in response to bacterial induction and down-regulated by treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone. This PAP1 gene may be under control of immune and hormonal
signals [37]. Pr-HPs identified in our study belong to
the SP superfamily and would likely take part in the
pro-PO activating system. Recently, a set of HPs have
been identified and characterized in M. sexta, of which
HP9 and HP6 could be induced by immune-challenge
both in hemocytes and fat body [38]. In our study, the
transcript levels of Pr-PPAEs and Pr-HPs were downregulated by venom. We identified one serpin from P.
rapae hemocytes and fat body, which may be a regulator
of SPs, including some PPAEs [39]. When some PPAEs
are activated by immune-challenge, the serpins coexpress to reduce the expression and activity of PPAEs.
This protects the host, because high PO activity is
harmful to it. Taken with results of enzyme assays (last
section, below), we suggest that venom may curtail melanization by down-regulating the transcript levels of
genes encoding PPAEs, HPs, and serpin, but not the
pro-PO gene directly.
Genes encoding proteins involved in the insect cellular
immune response and/or non-self recognition

Lectins and gram negative binding protein Venom
treatment down-regulated a set of host genes with a
high similarity to the lepidopteran lectins and the gram
negative binding protein (GNBP), including Bombyx
mori lipopolysaccharide binding protein [40], immulectin and the GNBP of H. cunea [41] (Tables 1 &2). Lepidopteran lectins are typical C-type lectins, with

Fang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:484
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/484

carbohydrate recognition domains. They function as
pathogen recognition receptors, and the promoters of
pro-PO activation in hemolymph [42], hemocyte nodule
formation [40] and encapsulation [43]. As described for
Spodoptera frugiperda [17], this P. rapae C-type lectin
gene was identified in the host hemocyte SSH library,
unlike other immulectins which are synthesized in the
fat body and secreted into the hemolymph [44]. Downregulation of the P. rapae lectins and GNBP homologue
by parasitoid venom may be one mechanism of inhibiting egg encapsulation, observed in parasitized host
pupae.
Calreticulin In hemocytes, the transcript level of the
calreticulin (CRT) gene was down-regulated by venom
injection (Table 1). CRT is a conserved multifunctional
Ca 2+ binding protein, present in a variety of cellular
compartments [45]. Intra-cellular CRT functions as a
molecular chaperone and regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis.
CRT is also found on the surface of cells, where it
might participate in the processes of cellular adhesion
and migration [46], inter-cellular signal transduction
[45], or elimination of apoptotic cells [47]. CRT of Galleria mellonella was isolated from the soluble fraction of
hemocyte lysates and could surround DEAE beads. CRT
in hemocyte membranes participates in the non-self
recognition in early-stage of the encapsulation. CRT
may enhance the early-stage of the encapsulation [48].
CRT is on the surface of P. rapae hemocytes during the
phagocytosis of yeast cells [49]. The transcript level of
the host CRT gene is reduced by P. puparum venom
and we speculate it suppresses encapsulation or non-self
recognition.
Scavenger receptor One host gene down-regulated in
response to the venom injection encodes a protein possessing a significant similarity with scavenger receptor
(SR)-C like protein of S. frugiperda (Table 1). The P.
rapae SR-C is predicted to be a trans-membrane protein, which possess a MAM domain and two tandem
complement control protein (CCP) domains. In Drosophila, based on the functional characterization of SRs,
MAM and CCP domains are sufficient for bacterial
binding in phagocytosis [50], from which it appears that
lepidopteran SRs act in phagocytosis [17]. Phagocytosis
of Spodoptera littoralis granular hemocytes was suppressed by polyinosinic acid, a specific ligand of SRs
[51]. SR-C may attach bacterial cells to lepidopteran
hemocytes [17]. We found the transcript level of this
gene was up-regulated by bead challenge at 1 h PI of
Sephadex-A 50 beads (Figure 5). We suggest that SR-C
influences phagocytosis and hemocyte encapsulation of
parasitoid eggs.
Other molecules Some of the down-regulated genes are
potentially involved in other physiological processes. For
example, venom treatment can alter the transcript levels

Page 8 of 17

of the annexin B gene in P. rapae (Table 2). Annexin B
is a calcium binding protein that acts in functions such
as membrane fusion, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as cell apoptosis [52]. Particularly in Drosophila, annexin IX is an immune-inducible gene upregulated in response to bacterial challenge [53]. The
parasitoid venom could lead to disruption of the cell
cytoskeleton in the host [11]. Besides down-regulation
of the beta-tubulin subunit in the host immune system,
our results show that venom injection influences transcript levels of several genes related to the actin-based
motility actions. These include actin-depolymerizing factor 1, transgelin, troponin, microtubule-associated protein, F-actin capping protein, and profilin (Tables 1 &2).
It may be inferred from these results that venom inhibition of the transcript levels of these genes may be
related to cell migration, differentiation, or proliferation.
In silico identified genes involved in transcription and
protein biosynthesis

The expression of genes related to transcription and
translation mechanisms are inhibited by venom. These
include transcription initiation factor, eukaryotic translation initiation factors, RNA helicase and translation
elongation factor (Tables 1 &2). The expression of genes
involved in transcription and translation mechanisms
are usually up-regulated by immune challenge in insect
hemocytes or human monocytes [54]. The venomrelated down-regulation of transcription and translation
may be related to the suppression of host immune
responses. Expression of genes similar to large and small
subunits of ribosomal proteins, disulfide-isomerase-like
protein and several proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway (Tables 1 &2) were inhibited by the venom
treatment. These genes are related to synthesis, modification, or degradation of proteins. This may be related
to host immunity because members of the ubiquitinproteasome pathway act in cellular processes including
regulation of cell cycle, division, development, differentiation, apoptosis, cell trafficking, and modulation of
immune responses [55].
Genes related to detoxification and stress response

Venom injection led to down-regulation of several
transcripts encoding proteins potentially involved in
detoxification and stress responses. These include
genes similar to peroxiredoxin of B. mori, heat-shock
protein 19.5 of Plutella xylostella, DnaJ-like protein of
B. mori, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) of Choristoneura. fumiferana (Tables 1 &2). Peroxiredoxin is
from hemocytes and fat body and the others come
from fat body. We speculate that fat body is more
active in detoxification and stress responses than
hemocytes. Growth and development of endoparasites

certainly stress their hosts, and it may be expected that
P. puparum venom inhibits expression of these stress
response genes.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme assays results

We confirmed the transcript levels of the screened
genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 5). The
RNA templates were isolated from hemocytes and fat
body of negative control, immune-induced, and
immune-suppressed pupae, relative to a fragment of 18
S rRNA gene (Additional file 4). Transcript levels of
most selected genes were induced by the Sephadex A-50
injection but not by phosphate buffer. We noted high
expression of a few of the genes in negative controls.
This is probably because wounding during injection
induces expression of some genes. Most of the transcript levels of the selected immune-response genes
were down-regulated following injection of the venom
plus beads, except for the C-rich peptide transcript.
Host genes encoding hemocyte PPAE precursor and SRC were strongly down-regulated following venom
injection.

We tested whether reduced mRNA levels of PPAEs,
Lysozyme and GST resulted in similarly reduced protein
levels by measuring activity of these enzymes (Figure 6).
Bead challenges led to significant increases in lysozyme
and PO activities in hemocytes (For PO, F = 957.71; df
= 2, 6; P = 0.0001; for lysozyme, F = 571.15; df = 2, 6; P

and fat body (For PO, F = 76.86; df = 2, 6; P = 0.0001;
for lysozyme, F = 82.48; df = 2, 6; P = 0.0001), but not
in gut (For PO, F = 2.51; df = 2, 6; P = 0.1618; for lysozyme, F = 1.76; df = 2, 6; P = 0.2497) and cuticle (For
PO, F = 0.10; df = 2, 6; P = 0.9080; for lysozyme, F =
0.11; df = 2, 6; P = 0.8968). Bead challenge also led to
significant increases in GST activity in plasma (F =
39.87; df = 2, 6; P = 0.0003) and fat body (F = 115.02; df
= 2, 6; P = 0.0001), but not the other tissues (For hemocytes, F = 1.35; df = 2, 6; P = 0.3272; for gut, F = 1.79;
df = 2, 6; P = 0.2452; for cuticle, F = 2.03; df = 2, 6; P =
0.2121). All three enzyme activities were not increased
significantly following injection of beads plus parasitoid
venom, comparing to negative controls. The results of

of components. One direction of our research is to investigate the number and nature venom components.

Methods
Conclusions
The data reported in this paper support our hypothesis
that P. puparum venom influences gene expression in its
pupal host, P. rapae. The following points apply. First, at
the level of observable immune reactions, venom treatment rapidly leads to significant reductions in hemocytic
encapsulation reactions to beads. Second, venom treatment led to down-regulation of induced gene transcript
levels in the hemocytes and fat body of host pupae.
Third, the observed gene down-regulation was confirmed
by RT-PCR and enzyme assays. Taken together, these
points bolster our hypothesis and they provide some
insight into the molecular mechanism of the P.
puparum/P. rapae parasitoid system. While there is very
little literature on the chemical makeup of parasitoid
venoms, we infer from the wide range of effects P.
puparum venom exerts on its host that the venom is a
complex substance with a large, albeit unknown, number

Insect rearing

P. rapae were collected primarily from cabbage fields in
the experimental farmland of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. The laboratory host colony and the P.
puparum colony were maintained as described previously and used in all experiments [56]. Briefly, the
host larvae were fed on fresh cabbage leaves within a
stainless steel-mesh cage (55 cm × 55 cm × 55 cm, 1.0
mm × 1.0 mm mesh at 25 ± 1°C, L: D = 10: 14 h) until
they pupated. Freshly pupated hosts were exposed to
mated female wasps in a glass tube (50 × 230 mm) for
48 h. The parasitized pupae were individually held in
glass vials (18 × 82 mm) under the same conditions just
described for the hosts. After emerging, the female
wasps were collected and held in glass containers (also
under the conditions just described), fed ad lib on 20%
(v/v) honey solution to lengthen life span for 3-4 days
until dissection of the venom reservoir and gland.

in Tables 1 & 2.

Crude venom preparation

Adult wasps aged 3-4 days were used for venom collection as described by Wu et al [29]. Briefly, the venom
reservoir and gland were dissected from the female
reproductive system on an ice-cold convex slide, containing a drop of phosphate buffer [10 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 15% (w/v)
sucrose, 1 mM ethylene diamine teraacetic acid, and 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] [57]. Five hundred
glands and reservoirs were then transferred to a sterilized 1.5 milliliter Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at
12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected as the crude venom and then filtered through a
0.22 micrometer cellulose acetate filter. The filtered
crude venom was stored at -70°C until use. The crude
venom solution was diluted with Pringle’s phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) to the final concentration of 2
venom reservoir equivalents (VREs)/μl immediately
before use.
In vivo encapsulation assay

To assay the in vivo encapsulation in P. rapae pupa,
Sephadex A-50 beads (GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ)
were used as P. puparum mimic eggs. We sterilized 0.5
mg beads by UV radiation in 1.0 ml PBS and transferred
the solution into a sterilized 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube to
prepare a stock solution. The stock solution was diluted

to a concentration of approximately 100 beads/μl PBS
containing 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) before injection. A half microliter of
the diluted bead suspensions (approximately 50 beads in
0.5 μl PBS) was injected into newly pupated and immunologically naive host pupae, using a sterilized 801 RN
micro-syringe (Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland). The beads were recovered from the treated
pupae at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h PI and analyzed for encapsulation. The beads were recovered by puncturing the
pupal cuticle at the elytrum with a sterilized dissecting
pin, and then collecting the hemolymph into a sterilized
1.5 ml Eppendorf tube charged with a few crystals of 1phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany)
by micropipette. 0.1 ml aliquots of the collected hemolymph with the encapsulated beads were immediately
transferred into wells of polyvinyl 24-well microplates
(NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark), which contained 10 μl of
PTU (25%) and 10 μl anticoagulant solution (0.9% NaCl,
0.942% KCl, 0.082% CaCl 2 , 2% EDTA), then analyzed
for encapsulation.
For experiments on suppression of encapsulation by
parasitoid venom, 0.5 μl of crude venom solution (equal
to 1 VRE) was co-injected with 0.5 μl of the diluted
bead suspensions into a host recipient. After the same
incubation periods PI, the beads were recovered and
analyzed for encapsulation.

beads were classified as 5 grades and the

encapsulation index (%) = {∑ (the number of
beads with a defined encapsulated grade × its corresponding grade number)/total number of beads
observed × 5)} × 100. The observations were
repeated three times, each one used separate
venom preparations and 5 host pupae.

Isolation of RNA from immune challenged and vemon
down-regulated P. rapae pupae

One group of pupae (n = 50) were challenged with
approximately 50 Sephadex A-50 beads to stimulate
immune gene expression, and another group (n = 50)
were challenged with co-injection of approximately 50
Sephadex A-50 beads plus venom (1 VRE), as described.
At 1 h PI, hemolymph was collected from bead-challenged pupae into the same 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube (sterilized, RNase-free and containing a few crystals of PTU).
Hemolymph was similarly collected from bead plus
venom-challenged pupae into another tube. To prepare
hemocytes, the hemolymph was centrifuged at 200 g for
10 min at 8°C, a procedure proven safe for hemocyte
collection [29]. In a parallel procedure, fat body was
directly isolated from each group of pupae (n = 10). The
collected fat body and hemocyte tissues were then
homogenized in liquid N2 and total RNA was extracted
using the TRizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. RNA integrity was confirmed
by ethidium bromide gel staining and RNA quantity was
determined spectrophotometrically at A 260/280.
Subtracted cDNA libraries construction and sequencing

Two micrograms of total RNA from the immune-challenged and venom-treated hemocytes and fat body were
used as the original template, respectively. The SMART
PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA, USA) was used to synthesize double-stranded
cDNA, according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Two
kinds of SSH was performed for the synthesized cDNAs,
using a PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech),
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
In brief, we designated the fat body and hemolymph
cDNA samples from the bead-challenged pupae as the
two “testers” and the cDNA from the samples of the
venom treated pupae as the two “drivers”. cDNAs from
the testers and drivers were first digested into fragments
by Rsa I (a four-base-cutting restriction enzyme (Clontech), leaving blunt-ended fragments). Each tester cDNA
was then divided into two aliquots, each of which was
subsequently ligated with one of two different adaptors,
adaptor 1 or adaptor 2R. Two different adaptor-ligated
tester cDNAs were separately denatured at 98 °C for 90
s and then hybridized at 68 °C for 8 h with an excess of
relative driver cDNA in a ratio of tester: driver = 1: 30.
These two primary hybridization samples were mixed
together without denaturing, and then fresh denatured
driver cDNA was added for the second enrichment,
hybridizing at 68 °C for 16 h. After that, two rounds of
suppression PCR were performed to selectively amplify
the differential transcripts. The first PCR was carried
out with primer 1 and the program parameter supplied
by the manufacturer. The second PCR with nested

Page 13 of 17

primers 1 and 2R was performed using diluted primary
PCR products (1/10 dilution) as a template. The following two forward subtractive cDNA products were
acquired, which could be used to identify early immuneinducible genes, whose transcription levels were specifically down-regulated by the venom from its parasitoid.
The resulting secondary PCR products were cloned into
pGEM® T-Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, United
States) and transformed into High Efficiency JM109
Competent Cells (Promega). The library was plated on
LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.5 mM IPTG
and 80 μg/ml X-gal and incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Colony PCR was performed randomly using the
Nested primer 1 and primer 2R supplied by the Kit.
Three microliters of the resulting PCR products were
identically spotted onto two sheets of positively charged
nylon membranes (Roche, Lewes, UK). The membranes
were dried and UV cross-linked using a Bio-Rad UV
cross-linker (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Digoxigenin-labeled probes
for hybridization were generated using enough non-subtracted cDNAs by the Dig-High Prime Labeling Kit
(Roche). The whole process of the dot-blotting was performed using Dig Easy Hyb Granules, Dig-Wash and
Block Buffer Set, Anti-Digoxigenin-AP and NBT/BCIP
ready-to-use tablets (Roche) following the manufacturers’ instructions.
Depending on the result of dolt-blot hybridization, the
positively subtractive clones were randomly subjected to
sequencing. The deduced amino acid sequences were
matched by searching the GenBank database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, using BLASTX algorithm. InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/ was used
for an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, and
PRINTS databases at EMBL-European Bioinformatics
Institute to check whether the functional domains
included in unknown genes, which were first analyzed
by BLASTX program.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis

The deduced amino acid sequences of P. rapae cecropin
and lysozyme were translated from their cDNA sequences,
and other reported cecropin and lysozyme sequences were
retrieved from the GenBank database. Multiple sequence
alignments were computed using Clustal W2 http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html. The phylogenetic
trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method
with a Kimura collection of distances.
Expression profiling by semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Some candidate genes, especially related to insect innate
immunity were selected for comparing their apparent
expression profiles between hemocytes and fat body
from immune-challenged and immune-challenged-

venom-treated hosts. The host pupae injected with PBS
were negative controls. After extraction from the hemocytes and fat body, the total RNA samples were treated
with TURBO™ DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove
any genomic DNA contaminants. Two and a half micrograms of the DNA-free total RNA was used to

synthesize the first strand cDNA by SuperScript® III
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was used as a template for RT-PCR. The
sequences of pairs of the PCR primers, expected size of
PCR product for each candidate gene, and the program
parameters of each RT-PCR are in Additional file 4.

Enzyme assays

Three enzymes related to host immune responses or
detoxification, were chosen for analysis. Fifty pupae
from each treatment (immune stimulated, immune stimulated-venom-treated treatments and negative control
setting like above) were dissected to obtain hemocytes,
plasma, fat body, gut and cuticle. Samples were first
homogenized in PBS at 0°C (except plasma), and then
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected as crude enzyme preparations. Protein quantification was determined by the Bradford
method [58] using BSA to create a standard curve.
For determination of PO activity a 1 ml mixture containing 2 mM dopamine (Sigma), 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 10 mg of crude enzyme
protein was incubated at 28 °C and the increase in
absorbance at 490 nm was continuously monitored. One
unit of enzyme activity was defined as an increase of
0.001 in absorbance/minute/mg protein.
Lysozyme activity was measured with a continuous
spectrophotometric assay, using lyophilized Micrococcus
luteus cells (Sigma) as the substrate, as described previously [59]. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as
an increase of 0.001 in absorbance at 450 nm/minute/
mg protein.
GST activity was measured with the method described
by Kao et al [60] with little modification. Briefly, the
mixture containing 50 ml (10 mg) crude of enzyme
solution, 1.83 ml Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.0) and
100 μl reduced glutathione (GSH, 50 mM, Sigma). After
pre-incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, 20 μl of 1-chloro-2,
4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (10 mM, Fluka, Buchs, Italy)
was added. The change in optical density was recorded
at 340 nm and one unit of enzyme activity was defined
as μmol/minute/mg protein.
Statistic analysis

The data on encapsulation was analyzed for two different treatments (venom-treated and non-treated) and
sampling time post treatments by two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), and all percentages were first transformed to a quasi-normal distribution by arcsine-square
root values prior to the statistic analysis. Data on the
activity of each enzyme among different treatments
(immune-inducible, suppressed, and non-treated) were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA, in each tissue tested.
Means were compared using LSD tests in all analysis
mentioned above. All statistical calculations were performed by DPS software (version 8.01) [61] and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
