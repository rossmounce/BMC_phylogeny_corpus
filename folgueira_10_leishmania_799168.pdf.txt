Open Access

The Leishmania infantum PUF proteins are targets
of the humoral response during visceral
leishmaniasis

Abstract
Background: RNA-binding proteins of the PUF family share a conserved domain consisting of tandemly repeated
36-40 amino acid motifs (typically eight) known as Puf repeats. Proteins containing tandem repeats are often
dominant targets of humoral responses during infectious diseases. Thus, we considered of interest to analyze
whether Leishmania PUF proteins result antigenic during visceral leishmaniasis (VL).
Findings: Here, employing whole-genome databases, we report the composition, and structural features, of the
PUF family in Leishmania infantum. Additionally, the 10 genes of the L. infantum PUF family were cloned and used
to express the Leishmania PUFs in bacteria as recombinant proteins. Finally, the antigenicity of these PUF proteins
was evaluated by determining levels of specific antibodies in sera from experimentally infected hamsters. The
Leishmania PUFs were all recognized by the sera, even though with different degree of reactivity and/or frequency
of recognition. The reactivity of hamster sera against recombinant LiPUF1 and LiPUF2 was particularly prominent,
and these proteins were subsequently assayed against sera from human patients. High antibody responses against
rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 were found in sera from VL patients, but these proteins resulted also recognized by sera from
Chagas’ disease patients.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that Leishmania PUFs are targets of the humoral response during L. infantum
infection and may represent candidates for serodiagnosis and/or vaccine reagents; however, it should be kept in
mind the cross-reactivity of LiPUFs with antibodies induced against other trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma
cruzi.

Findings
Leishmaniases constitute a vast variety of diseases ranging from cutaneous manifestations to visceral dissemination that are caused by different species of the genus
Leishmania. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most severe
form of leishmaniases (usually fatal if untreated), is typically caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania
infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi) [1]. Leishmaniases
constitute a worldwide public-health problem and 1.5 to
2 million new cases occur every year: 1 to 1.5 million
cases of cutaneous forms and 500,000 cases of VL [2].
These vector-borne diseases are endemic in large areas
of the tropics, subtropics and the Mediterranean basin.
Early and accurate diagnosis of leishmaniasis remains

unresolved. Diagnostic tests should be highly sensitive
and specific; furthermore, the tests should be able to
make the distinction between acute disease and asymptomatic infection. Also, accurate diagnosis is relevant for
monitoring success in the chemotherapeutic treatment
of leishmaniases.
Parasite detection in tissue biopsies either by microscopic visualization of amastigotes or in vitro culturing
of the parasite remains the gold standard in leishmaniasis diagnosis because of its high specificity [1,3]. However, for VL diagnosis, aspirates of lymph nodes, bone
marrow or spleen need to be obtained, being both risky
and painful for patients. In addition, the sensitivity of
microscopy and culture techniques tends to be low and
variable, depending of many factors, among them the
technical skills of the personnel. Given that leishmanial
infections are accompanied by a dramatic humoral

response, mainly in the visceral forms of leishmaniasis,
serodiagnosis appears as an interesting alternative. In
fact, a battery of immunological procedures have been
developed and adapted for diagnosis and epidemiological surveys [4]. Several Leishmania antigenic proteins
have been expressed as recombinant proteins and their
potential for serodiagnosis assayed [5-8]. However, so
far, only a Leishmania recombinant protein (rK39) is
being used for serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis in the field
[1]. rK39 is a subfragment within a 230-kDa kinesinrelated protein (LcKin); it spans the LcKin C-terminal
region, which contains seven 39-amino acid repeats [9].
Many antigens of different protozoan parasites contains
tandem repeats in their structure [10,11], suggesting
that repeated domains might be better inducers of Bcell activation and, therefore, resulting preferred targets
of the humoral responses. Experimental support for this
hypothesis has been obtained by Goto and co-workers
[12]. By screening an L. infantum expression library
with sera from human VL patients or infected hamsters,
they identified 43 genes encoding B-cell antigens, and,
remarkably, 44% of those antigens contained tandem
repeats in their structure. In a subsequent work, these
authors, using a bioinformatic approach, directly
searched in the L. infantum database for genes encoding
proteins with tandem repeats. Among the 64 identified
genes, the antigenicity for 6 of the encoded proteins was
experimentally assayed using sera from VL patients,
showing that 4 of them had significant and specific reactivity against VL sera [13].
The RNA-binding proteins of the PUF family constitute an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins present in all eukaryotic phyla [14]. PUF proteins bind to
sequence motifs in the 3’-UTR of specific mRNAs and
control their localization, stability and translation [15].
The distinctive feature of PUF proteins is the RNAbinding domain known as the Pumilio homology
domain (PUM-HD), which is composed of several consecutive imperfect repeats (typically eight) of around 3640 amino acids (Puf repeats). Recently, Caro and coworkers [16] identified up to 10 different PUF proteins
in the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, and an equivalent
complement of PUF proteins has been also described
for two other trypanosomatids, Trypanosoma brucei and
Leishmania major [17]. Because of the existence of
many repeated motifs in this class of proteins, we questioned whether the PUF proteins would be antigenic
during Leishmania infection. For this purpose, we have
identified the putative PUF genes existing in the L.
infantum genome and expressed them as recombinant
proteins. Afterwards, the antigenicity of the different L.
infantum PUFs was assayed using the sera from experimentally infected hamsters. Interestingly, all the PUFs

were specifically recognized by immune sera, even
though individual differences were observed.

Methods
Parasites and sera

L. infantum promastigotes were cultured at 26°C in
RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated, fetal bovine
serum. Hamsters were infected intracardially with stationary-phase promastigotes (strain M/CAN/ES/96/
BNC150) and the animals were monitored for 1-year
follow-up period. At the onset of clear symptoms of
visceral leishmaniasis (emaciation and asthenia) hamsters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 were sacrificed; high parasite
loads were found in both liver and spleen of these animals. At the end of the study, even though hamsters 9
and 10 did not show external signs of disease, significant
parasite loads were found in their livers and spleens.
Hamster 6 was a particular case, no parasites were
observed after microscopic examination of liver or
spleen preparations at the moment of sacrifice; thus, it
was assumed that this animal had resolved the infection.
Before infection (preimmune serum) and at the time of
sacrifice (immune serum), sera were collected. See reference [18] for further details of this infection experiment
(code correspondence: 1 = A2, 2 = A3, 3 = A4, 4 = B1,
5 = B3, 6 = B4, 7 = C3, 8 = C4, 9 = A5, 10 = A7). All
experimental animals were housed, fed and used in
accordance with the Federation of European Laboratory
Animal Science Association (FELASA) Guidelines. The
animal study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
Human sera were provided by Dr. Carmen Cañavate
(WHO Collaborating Centre for Leishmaniasis, Servicio
de Parasitología, Centro Nacional de Microbiología,
Madrid). VL sera were collected from Spanish patients
with active disease that was diagnosed by serological
and parasitological methods. Chagasic sera were
obtained from Latin American immigrants showing
signs of cardiomyopathy and proven serologically positive by IFI and commercial ELISA kits. Normal sera
were obtained from healthy individuals in Spain.
Identification and bioinformatic analyses of the L.
infantum PUF proteins

T. brucei, T. cruzi, L. braziliensis, L. infantum and L.
major PUF sequences were obtained from GeneDB [19].
Searches for structural motifs in Leishmania PUF
sequences were performed using the PROSITE database
and resources [20]. Potential N-terminal signal peptides
were predicted by Signal P program [21].

LinJ20_V3.1420, LinJ21_V3.2050, LinJ25_V3.2470,
LinJ32_V3.1830 and LinJ33_V3.1210 genes were amplified by PCR. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in the Additional file
1. As template, genomic DNA from L. infantum JPC
strain (MCAN/ES/98/LLM-724) was used.
The PCR products were digested with restriction
enzymes (specific restriction sites were added to the 5’end of the primers) and cloned directionally in the
appropriate expression vector (pQE30, pQE31 or
pQE32; Qiagen). The sequences of the inserts were
determined by automatic sequencing (Servicio de Genómica, Parque Tecnológico de Madrid-UAM). The
expression clones were used to transform Escherichia
coli M15-pREP4 strain bacteria. The optimum conditions for expression were determined by varying the
IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranose) concentration, length of induction and growth temperature. The
recombinant proteins were then purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose chromatography, using denaturing
conditions according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen). The purity of the proteins was assayed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining of the gels. The concentration of proteins was determined by the Bradford
dye assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA)
as standard.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

The recombinant PUF proteins were analyzed for seroreactivity using sera from 10 hamsters with VL symptoms that were experimentally infected with L. infantum
promastigotes (see above). Preimmune sera from the
same animals were used as negative controls. In addition, L. infantum soluble lysate antigen (SLA) was used
as a positive control. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Proteins were diluted in coating buffer (15 mM
Na2CO3, 28 mM NaHCO3, pH = 9.6), and plates were
coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ng of SLA or 200 ng of
recombinant protein. After removing the coating solution, free binding sites were blocked with 200 μl of 5%
milk in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 (T-PBS) for 1 h
at room temperature. The plates were then washed two
times in T-PBS. Sera diluted 1:200 in T-PBS and 0.5%
nonfat milk were added (100 μl/well), and plates were
incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three
washes, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antihamster IgG (Nordic Immunological Lab.), diluted
1:1500 in T-PBS and 0.5% nonfat milk were added (100
μl/well). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h,
plates were washed three times. Finally, the antibody
binding was revealed with ortho-phenylenediamine
(OPD) and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was left to
proceed for 15 min and then stopped by addition of 100
μl of H2SO4 1 M. The absorbance of the reaction was

measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad). The
lower limit of positivity (cutoff) was determined by the
mean of the negative controls (pre-immune sera) plus
three standard deviations. Human sera were also assayed
in ELISA at 1:200 dilution, using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Nordic Immunological Lab.) as secondary antibody (1:1500 dilution).

Results and Discussion
L. infantum has an equivalent complement of PUF
proteins to those predicted in other trypanosomes

In previous studies, it was uncovered the existence of 10
different PUF proteins (PUF1 to PUF10) in the genomes
of T. cruzi [16] and T. brucei [17]. Homologue proteins
were also identified in the L. major genome [17], indicating a high degree of conservation of the PUF family
in trypanosomatids. Recently, the genome sequences for
two additional Leishmania species (i.e., L. infantum and
L. braziliensis) have been completed [22]. With this
wealth of information, we undertook a comparative analysis of this protein family looking for conserved and
divergent features among the different trypanosomatids.
As depicted in Table 1, all species have an equivalent
complement of PUF proteins, with the intriguing exception of PUF9. This protein is not predicted in the current L. braziliensis genome database. However, a BLAST
search in the unassembled shotgun reads of L. braziliensis Genome project [19] identified sequences with significant homology to PUF9 genes (data not shown),
suggesting that this gene does exist in L. braziliensis but
that it has not been annotated yet due to problems in
genome coverage.
On the other hand, it is remarkable the existence of
two isoforms for PUF9 in L. major and L. infantum. We
named these isoforms as PUF9a (LmjF20.1365 and
LinJ20_V3.1410; see Table 1) and PUF9b (LmjF20.1370
and LinJ20_V3.1420). Phylogenetic analysis (not shown)
suggests that PUF9a/b isoforms are derived from a
recent duplication of the ancestral PUF9 gene that
occurred in the L. infantum/L. major evolutionary line.
In fact, both genes are contiguous in the L. infantum/L.
major chromosome 20. However, multiple alignment of
the sequences for the Leishmania PUF9 isoforms evidenced a conspicuous structural difference between L.
infantum and L. major PUF9 proteins: L. infantum
LiPUF9 isoforms have an N-terminal extension that is
absent from the L. major counterparts. However, since
the sequences upstream of the assigned start codons for
LmjPUF9a and LmjPUF9b are extremely conserved with
the sequences coding for the N-terminal regions of the
LiPUF9a and LiPUF9b (data not shown), the differences
in the predicted sequences may be due to annotation
errors in the L. major database. In fact, even though
with low sequence conservation, the T. brucei and T.

Structural features of the L. infantum PUF proteins

A common feature of PUF proteins is the presence of an
RNA-binding domain, known as the Pumilio homology
domain (PUM-HD), which is composed of several consecutive imperfect repeats (Puf repeats; typically eight),
each of approximately 40 amino acids [15]. A search for
functional domains and structural motifs was performed
in the different PUF proteins by scanning the sequences
against PROSITE patterns [20]. As shown in figure 1,
the PUM-HD domain [Swiss-Prot: PS50303] was predicted for 10 out of the 11 L. infantum PUF proteins.
The sole exception was LiPUF7 protein, for which the
program failed to predict a PUM-HD domain. However,
in the T. brucei orthologue, TbPUF7, this domain is
readily predicted at the N-terminal end of the sequence
(data not shown). Additionally, the LiPUF7 possesses a
cluster of five PUF repeats at the C-terminal end, suggesting that two RNA-binding domains might be present in this protein (figure 1). In summary, from these
bioinformatics analyses, it became evident that PUF proteins of Leishmania are rich in repeated motifs, i.e, Puf
repeats.
Recognition of the L. infantum PUF proteins by sera from
experimentally infected hamsters

The repeated nature of PUF proteins prompted us to
analyze whether, as hypothesized by other authors [13],
they can be targeted by the immune system during
Leishmania infection. In order to determine the antigenicity of the L. infantum PUF proteins, we cloned the
complete coding regions of 10 out of the 11 PUF genes
existing in this Leishmania species (Table 1). Since
LiPUF9a and LiPUF9b are essentially identical in

sequence and, presumably, antigenically cross-reactive,
we selected one gene (i.e. LiPUF9b) for cloning and
expression. The different PUF genes were successfully
expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins in E. coli
(see Methods for details). After affinity chromatography
purification, the recombinant PUF (rPUF) proteins were
assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
showing apparent molecular masses similar to those
deduced from the amino acid sequence [see Additional
file 1].
We then examined the presence of antibodies against
the different rPUFs in sera from 10 hamsters with visceral leishmaniasis [18]. The reactivity of pre-infection
sera was also analyzed against each one of the recombinant proteins and used to determine the corresponding
cut-off values (figure 2). For comparison, we analyzed
the reactivity of hamster sera against L. infantum soluble
proteins (SLA) and rLiHSP70 (a prominent antigen during VL [23]). The individual reactivity of the immune
sera against each one of the recombinant PUFs is
depicted in figure 2. Remarkably, even though with different degree of reactivity, all ten rLiPUFs were specifically recognized by the different VL sera, suggesting that
they are immunogenic for the hamster immune system.
Two, rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2, showed strong reactivity to
the VL sera with higher reactivity values than that of
SLA. rLiPUF4, rLiPUF5 and rLiPUF8 showed intermediate reactivity, with values similar to that of rLiHSP70.
The other PUF proteins (rLiPUF3, rLiPUF6, rLiPUF7,
rLiPUF9b and rLiPUF10) showed a lower recognition,
but they were specifically recognized by some of the VL
sera. An idea arose from these results was the possible
combination of several LiPUFs to increase the serodiagnosis usefulness of these proteins. Thus, coating of

the PUM-HD domain are indicated.

ELISA plates with a mixture of rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2
resulted in an overall increase of the reactivity values of
sera relative to the values obtained against the proteins
assayed separately (figure 3A).
Another remarkable finding of this study is that the
PUF antigens are differentially recognized by each one
of the hamster sera. Thus, for example, rLiPUF1 was
highly recognized by serum from animals 2, 7 and 9,
whereas rLiPUF2 was recognized better by sera 4 and 5.
Additional variations can be easily deduced from a
visual inspection of figure 2. Individual differences in
the antigens targeted by the immune system are not
unexpected findings, at least, for non inbred animals
[24]. Furthermore, this variability of recognition indicates that different LiPUFs are priming specific humoral
responses in hamsters, and that the cross-reactivity of
the elicited anti-PUF antibodies seems to be low.
Antigenicity and specificity of rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 in
human patients

Given the prominent recognition of rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 by sera from L. infantum-infected hamsters, we
assayed the reactivity of 10 sera from VL patients
against each one of these recombinant proteins (figure
3B). Remarkably, 8/10 and 5/10 of the VL sera reacted
with rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2, respectively, with absorbance values higher than the cut-off value of the healthy
controls (0.49). Some of the human VL sera yielded
absorbance values higher than 1, indicating that these
proteins are strong immunogens for the immune system
of some individuals. Since the LiPUF proteins have wellconserved homologues in other trypanosomatids (Table

1), we further analyzed whether specific antibodies are
present in the sera from Chagas’ disease patients. Not
surprisingly, positive reactivity against rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 was observed in 3/5 and 2/5, respectively, of the
sera from chagasic patients. This cross-reactivity may be
a hurdle for the use of these two proteins as diagnostic
antigens, at least in regions where leishmaniasis and
Chagas’s disease are endemic. Nevertheless, they should
not be absolutely discarded before determining the location of B-cell epitopes recognized by antibodies elicited
in VL and chagasic patients. For example, acidic ribosomal proteins are prominent and cross-reactive antigens
during both leishmaniasis and Chagas’ disease, but the
recognized epitopes are different for each group of
patients, allowing that a truncated form of the Leishmania P2 protein could be used for differential serodiagnosis of these diseases [25].
In order to evaluate the diagnosis usefulness of these
proteins, it remains to determine the recognition of the
Leishmania PUFs by sera from patients with different
forms of leishmaniasis and/or VL dogs. Currently, we
are planning those studies with the hope that some of
these proteins can be used together with other well
characterized Leishmania antigens for designing new
serodiagnosis devices. Diagnostic arrays based on antigens that most often are targeted by human immune
system are expected to be far more sensitive and informative than simple monospecific diagnostics such as the
currently widely applied rK39 dipstick, as single antigens
that are recognized by all individuals infected by any
pathogen appear to be rare.

Conclusions
L. infantum shares with other Leishmania species and
related trypanosomatids (e.g. T. brucei and T. cruzi) a
PUF family consisting of ten members. All ten L.infantum PUF are B-cell antigens during parasite infection in
hamster model of VL, even though with variable
strength. Thus, rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 showed strong
reactivity, rLiPUF4, rLiPUF5 and rLiPUF8 showed intermediate reactivity, whereas rLiPUF3, rLiPUF6, rLiPUF7,
rLiPUF9b and rLiPUF10 showed low reactivity. We also
showed that rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 are recognized by
sera from VL patients, but also by sera from Chagas’
disease patients. In conclusion, this study has shown
that PUFs are targets of the immune system during L.
infantum infection and, therefore, might have usefulness
in diagnosis and/or vaccine developments.
