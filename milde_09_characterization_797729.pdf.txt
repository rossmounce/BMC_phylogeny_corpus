Abstract
Background: Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
evolution of morphological diversity remain poorly understood. While current models assume that
species-specific morphologies are governed by differential use of conserved genetic regulatory
circuits, it is debated whether non-conserved taxonomically restricted genes are also involved in
making taxonomically relevant structures. The genomic resources available in Hydra, a member of
the early branching animal phylum Cnidaria, provide a unique opportunity to study the molecular
evolution of morphological novelties such as the nematocyte, a cell type characteristic of, and
unique to, Cnidaria.
Results: We have identified nematocyte-specific genes by suppression subtractive hybridization
and find that a considerable portion has no homologues to any sequences in animals outside Hydra.
By analyzing the transcripts of these taxonomically restricted genes and mining of the Hydra
magnipapillata genome, we find unexpected complexity in gene structure and transcript processing.
Transgenic Hydra expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter under control of one of the
taxonomically restricted gene promoters recapitulate faithfully the described expression pattern,
indicating that promoters of taxonomically restricted genes contain all elements essential for spatial
and temporal control mechanisms. Surprisingly, phylogenetic footprinting of this promoter did not
reveal any conserved cis-regulatory elements.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that taxonomically restricted genes are involved in the
evolution of morphological novelties such as the cnidarian nematocyte. The transcriptional
regulatory network controlling taxonomically restricted gene expression may contain not yet
characterized transcription factors or cis-regulatory elements.

Background

Cnidaria represent the simplest animals at the tissue grade of
organization. In order to catch prey, cnidarians have evolved
a unique "high-tech cellular weaponry" [1] - the stinging cells
(cnidocytes, nematocytes) - single cells able to shoot structures at their target and inject toxic substances into it. Nematocytes are unique to and present in all species of the phylum
Cnidaria. Different phylogenetic lines have different nematocyte types [2,3]. Evolution of cnidarian families appears to be
accompanied by expansion of the nematocyte repertoire [4].
In Hydra, four types of nematocytes can be distinguished
based on the distinct morphology of the nematocyte capsule:
stenotele, desmoneme, holotrichous isorhiza and atrichous
isorhiza. Previous work [5,6] has identified unusually short
proteins with a collagen-related domain (minicollagens) as
major constituents of the nematocyst capsule wall. Intermolecular disulfide bonds between the cysteine-rich domains of
these minicollagens and an additional capsule protein,
NOWA, are thought to stabilize the capsule wall [7]. The
spines inside the capsules contain spinalin, another protein
unrelated to any protein in other animals [8].
How novel morphological structures evolve is an open and
important question. One currently popular view is that since
many genes are shared throughout the animal kingdom, animal diversity is largely based on differential use of conserved
genes and regulatory circuits [9-11]. However, all genome and
expressed sequence tag (EST) projects to date in every taxonomic group studied so far have uncovered a substantial
amount of genes that are without known homologues [12,13].
A previous study [13] has discovered that a family of such taxonomically restricted 'orphan' genes plays a significant role in
controlling phenotypic features referred to as species-specific
traits in the genus Hydra. Thus, morphological diversity in
closely related species may be generated through changes in
the spatial and temporal deployment of genes that are not
highly conserved across long evolutionary distances [13].
We here have chosen an unbiased comparative approach
based on suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to
identify additional nematocyte-specific genes in Hydra.
Among those detected, a considerable portion has no homologues in animals outside Hydra. Since they are exclusively
restricted to the phylum Cnidaria, they are considered as
'orphans' or 'taxonomically restricted genes' (TRGs) [13-16].
Analysis of these TRGs indicates striking complexity in their
genomic organization and transcript processing. In order to
understand how such TRGs are regulated, we generated
transgenic polyps that express green fluorescent protein
(GFP) under control of one of the TRG promoters. Transgenic
Hydra recapitulate faithfully the previously described
expression pattern, indicating that the promoter contains all
elements essential for spatial and temporal control mechanisms. Surprisingly, phylogenetic footprinting of this promoter did not reveal any conserved cis-regulatory elements.

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R8

This may indicate that the transcriptional regulatory network
controlling TRG expression may contain not yet characterized transcription factors or cis-regulatory elements.
Our data provide a detailed genomic description of several
taxonomically restricted genes in a basal metazoan, and functional evidence that TRGs are integrated in transcriptional
regulatory networks to form functional signaling cascades.

Results
Identification of taxonomically restricted genes
expressed in nematocytes
In order to isolate not yet identified genes potentially
involved in nematocyte differentiation, we made use of the sf1 mutant strain of H. magnipapillata, which has temperature-sensitive interstitial stem cells [17]. Interstitial cells are
located between the ectodermal epithelial cells and contain
both germline and somatic components, giving rise to all
nerve cells, gland cells and nematocytes [18]. Treatment for a
few hours at the restrictive temperature (28°C) induces quantitative loss of the entire interstitial cell lineage, including
nematocytes from the ectodermal epithelium [19].
To identify genes that are transcriptionally active in differentiating nematocytes, we compared transcriptomes of control
and nematocyte-free H. magnipapillata by SSH of cDNAs. As
shown schematically in Figure 1, subtractive hybridization
resulted in a cDNA library enriched for interstitial stem cell
lineage-specific transcripts. Sequencing of 2,500 clones
revealed 105 consensus contig sequences that could be
grouped by BLASTx analysis into three different categories of
homology (Figure 1). One set (45 sequences; 43%) had strong
similarities (e-value < 1e-20) to known metazoan proteins.
The second set (44 sequences; 42%) had low e-values (>1e -7)
and represents genes related but not identical to previously
identified metazoan genes. The third set (16 sequences; 15%)
had no homologues in the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) protein database (Figure 1), representing, therefore, genes putatively restricted to Hydra or Hydrozoa. Further sequence analysis of these 16 contigs revealed
that some of them (contigs 049 and 129 as well as 035 and
109) represent fragments of the same primary transcript.
Thus, the approach resulted in identification of a total of 14
genes without significant homology.
Next, we analyzed the expression of these putative TRGs by
whole mount in situ hybridization. Out of the 14 genes, 9 represent transcripts expressed exclusively in differentiating
nematocytes. While five of them (Figure 2a-h; nb001, nb035,
nb039, nb042, nb082) show expression in all types of differentiating nematocytes, three genes (Figure 2i-k; nb012,
nb054, nb092) are expressed only in isorhiza and desmonemes. One gene (nb031; Figure 2l) is exclusively expressed in
stenoteles, predominantly at the base of tentacles.

To investigate whether the identified genes were restricted to
the species H. magnipapillata or are also present in other
Hydra species (Figure 3a), we analyzed their expression in
the related Hydra oligactis [20]. Figure 3b indicates that
genes nb012, nb035, nb039, nb042 and nb054 give a strong
in situ hybridization signal in differentiating nematocytes in
both H. magnipapillata and H. oligactis, representing, therefore, genes putatively restricted to the genus Hydra. TRGs
found to be expressed in nematocytes in both species share
high sequence similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Figure 3b also indicates that transcripts for nb031,
nb082, and nb092 cannot be detected in H. oligactis, representing, therefore, genes putatively restricted to the species
H. magnipapillata. Interestingly, screening the genome of
the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis provided
evidence for the presence of at least two of the abovedescribed nematocyte-specific TRGs in this distantly related
cnidarian (Figure 3b). Thus, these genes seem to be present in
many classes of the phylum Cnidaria but absent in other
metazoan taxa. Therefore, such genes might be considered
'cnidaria-specific'.

(strain sf-1) cDNA was used as tester and cDNA of interstitial cell free H.
magnipapillata (sf1) as driver to generate a library enriched for transcripts
of the interstitial cell lineage. BLASTx analysis could group 105 EST-contig
sequences into three categories of homology: 45 sequences (43%) had
strong similarities (e-value < 1e-20) to known metazoan proteins; 44
sequences (42%) had low e-values (>1e -7); 16 sequences (15%) had no
homologues in the NCBI protein database, representing genes putatively
restricted to the genus Hydra.

Detailed analysis of the gene nb001 revealed that it encodes a
novel member of the minicollagen family of proteins containing the previously reported [5,21,22] structural features such
as a signal peptide, propetide, cystein rich domain, and a proline-repeat flanked collagen-like domain (Figure 4a). In a
recent review [4] the protein encoded by nb001 was referred
to as 'minicollagen 6'. At the nucleotide level, nb001 shares no
similarity to previously published [5,22] minicollagens.
Analysis of nb001 transcripts in the EST data bank and the
corresponding genomic locus uncovered five different splice
variants (Figure 4a, nb001-sv1 to nb001-sv5: CL1Contig4,
CL1Contig3, CL1Contig2, CL1Contig1 and CL1Contig5,
respectively). In addition, by PCR amplification we could
identify four more splice variants (nb001-sv6 to nb001-sv9;
Figure 4a). Interestingly, while the first two introns are
spliced by conventional splicing sites (GT/AG), additional
variants of the transcripts are generated by processing of exon
3. As a result of this process, which may use unconventional
'splicing' sites, various regions of exon 3 are removed.
The resulting nb001 predicted proteins (Figure 4b) indicate
domain length variations of the collagen-like domain as well
as the proline and cysteine repeats. In contrast to previously
reported minicollagens [5,22], all nb001 variants described
here have 19-27 Gly-X-Y repeats instead of 12-16, resulting in
an expanded collagen-like domain (Figure 4b). Other nb001
variants are characterized by a shortened praline repeat following the collagen-like domain. Three variants (nb001-sv7
to nb001-sv9) lack both the collagen-like domain and the pro-

domain with an altered cysteine pattern - (CXXX)7-CC,
(CXXX)5-CC or (CXXX)2-CC - instead of the conserved
(CXXX)4-CC. Northern blot analysis (Figure 4c) shows a
strong signal at around 700 bp, indicating the presence of
nb001 transcripts corresponding to most of the predicted variants.

that spinalin and nb054 are, in fact, encoded by a single gene
and, therefore, must be considered as splice variants. While
the first six exons encode the previously identified spinalin,
splicing within the 6th exon leads to much longer transcript
variants containing the first 6 exons plus an additional 2-16
exons, resulting in a large number of differentially spliced
transcripts of about 3,000 bp (Figure 5a). The short 983 bp
transcript encoding spinalin is produced by alternative splicing and usage of the resulting stop codon within exon 6. Since
this genomic region is rich in AT repeats (Figure 5a), some
sequence areas encoding the TRG nb054 remain unresolved
and, therefore, the final number of nb054-specific exons
remains to be determined. Northern blot analysis with spinalin- and nb054-specific probes (Figure 5b) revealed three distinct signals of about 1, 1.7 and 3 kb corresponding to the
predicted spinalin and nb054 transcripts.

Gene duplication contributes to the complexity of nematocytespecific gene families
The TRG nb039 has blast hits to two distinct but similar
genomic contigs (NW_002158707, NW_002162805), which
we named nb039-A and nb039-B (Figure 6a,b). Corresponding ESTs could be grouped into two independent sets of EST

contigs, which are identical to the respective genomic locus
and represent several different splice variants. Additionally,
we were able to amplify 11 more partial splice variants for
nb039-A and three more partial splice variants for nb039-B.
From the locus nb039-A, two splice variants use alternative 3'
untranslated regions (UTRs; nb039a-sv4/CL1Contig423,
nb039a-sv10) due to early stop codons, which most likely
were inserted by alternative splicing. Comparison of the
exon/intron distribution pattern in the 5' adjacent region of
nb039-A and nb039-B (Figure 6a,b) indicates striking structural similarity. A comparative sequence analysis of both loci
(Figure 6c) provided evidence that they are the result of a
gene duplication event since the gene-encoding part of
nb039-A and nb039-B is highly conserved but flanked by
stretches of non-conserved genomic sequences.
A second example of a putative gene duplication event in a
TRG gene expressed in nematocytes was discovered when
analyzing the genomic locus of nb012. As shown in Figure 7a,
this gene consists of seven exons corresponding to one EST
contig (nb012a/CL243Contig1). The full-length transcript of
this EST-contig contains a laminin-G-like domain located on
exons 4 and 5. Screening the available Hydra EST collections

revealed a second partial transcript with a laminin G-like
domain with a sequence related but not identical to nb012a.
We termed this transcript nb012b (Figure 7b). The available
genome assembly suggests that this second partial transcript
is encoded within the gene encoding nb012a. PCR based analysis, however, did not provide evidence for a transcript containing sequences of both nb012a and nb012b. Since a more
informative re-assembly of the nb012 locus is currently not
possible because of limited sequence data, we assume but

cannot prove that nb012a and nb012b represent gene duplication events. In situ hybridization using nb012a- and
nb012b-specific probes indicated (Figure 7c-e) that nb012b
indeed represents a gene co-expressed with nb012a. The low
level of sequence similarity in the probes used for the in situ
hybridization analysis excluded the possibility of crosshybridization. Double in situ hybridization confirmed that
both genes are spatially and temporarily co-expressed in the
same set of nematocytes (Figure 7e). Furthermore, Northern

blot analysis (Figure 7f) using the nb012a- and nb012b-specific probes indicated the presence of two independent transcripts of about 1,700 and 2,200 bp, respectively. This
supports the view that both genes are located on different
genomic loci.

Sharing 3' UTRs in some nematocyte specific genes indicates
common regulation of different splice variants
Analyzing the genomic locus encoding TRG nb035 revealed a
gene consisting of two exons (Figure 8a). While the first exon
encodes a large open reading frame of 2,347 bp, the second
exon is short and represents mainly 3' UTR. Three partial
contigs (CL1Contig431, CL1Contig609, CL1Contig10) could
be identified in the EST project and map to this locus. Rapid

amplification of cDNA ends (3' and 5' RACE; Figure 8a)
revealed that nb035 encodes three distinct splice variants
(nb035-sv1 to nb035-sv3) that share a common 3' UTR.
While the stop codon of nb035-sv1 is located at the end of the
first exon, the stop codons for nb035-sv2 and nb035-sv3 are
located in exon 2 (Figure 8a,b). As a result, corresponding
proteins differ in their carboxy-terminal parts. Exon 1
encodes an extensin-related domain, which is altered in
nb035-sv3. Northern blot analysis using probes specific for
the three splice variants (Figure 8c) shows three distinct signals of 1,400, 2,400 and 3,100 bp, respectively.

How are taxonomically restricted genes regulated?
The 1 kb upstream region of nb001 lacks any conserved
transcription factor binding sites
How are genes that lack sequence similarity to known genes
regulated? In an attempt to unravel the transcriptional regulatory network controlling expression of a TRG, we analyzed
the nb001 5' flanking sequence. To identify the 5' regulatory
sequence, we used the H. magnipapillata genome data
deposited at NCBI. Since nb001 is expressed in a seemingly
identical manner across species borders (Figure 3b), we reasoned that sequences important for control of nb001 expression were strongly conserved at the nucleotide level, since
their potential for mutation is constrained by their function.
As described previously [23], such evolutionarily conserved
cis-regulatory elements can be identified by phylogenetic
footprinting.
Approximately 1 kb of 5' flanking sequence of the nb001 gene
was analyzed from H. magnipapillata (strain 105) and closely
related H. vulgaris (strain AEP) using the previously
described ConSite platform [23]. As shown in Figure 9a, the
5' flanking regions are of unexpected high overall identity,
with three regions, named regions I, II and III (Figure 9a),
nearly identical between the two different species. These
regions were subjected to conserved transcription factor
binding site prediction (Figure 9b). As Hydra has an AT-rich
genome composition, several cycles of analysis were performed with increasing transcription factor score thresholds,
thus modulating the stringency of the sequence analysis.
However, apart from AT-rich stretches, no conserved and
informative binding motif remained detectable (Figure 9b).

The 1 kb upstream region of nb001 is essential and sufficient for
correct expression in vivo
To functionally characterize the putative regulatory sequence
of nb001 in vivo, we have generated transgenic polyps that
express enhanced GFP (eGFP) under the control of the isolated nb001 5' flanking sequence. The transgenic construct
was made by placing the 1,035 bp nb001 promoter (-305 to 1274 relative to the transcription initiation site and including
the signal peptide of nb001) in front of the GFP reporter gene
(Figure 10a). The plasmid was injected into Hydra embryos
as described [24]. Embryos hatched within 2-3 weeks after
injection. Figure 10 shows examples of such transgenic polyps
and demonstrates that the 1035 bp 5' flanking region of the
nb001 gene is able to direct the expression of eGFP in differentiating nematocytes in a pattern that recapitulates precisely
the endogenous expression pattern of the nb001 gene (see
Figure 2 for comparison). Stereo- and confocal microscopy
(Figure 10b-f) shows nests of nematocytes with eGFP in
groups of 4, 8 and 16 along the body column. This provides in
vivo proof for the view [25-28] that differentiating nematocytes undergo several rounds of synchronous cell division and
remain connected to each other by cytoplasmic bridges prior
to terminal differentiation. The nb001 gene has a signal peptide, which was included in the construct (Figure 10a). Figure

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R8

10c-f shows that the signal peptide drives the eGFP reporter
protein into the lumen of the secretory vesicle within differentiating nematocytes. In control transgenic Hydra expressing
eGFP in nematocytes driven by the Hydra actin promoter
without a signal peptide, the reporter protein is localized in
the cytoplasm (Figure 10g). These results identify the 1035 bp
as essential and sufficient for nb001 expression in vivo.

Discussion

One of the main challenges in evolutionary biology is to identify the molecular changes that underlie phenotypic differences that are of evolutionary significance [29]. Our results
suggest that taxonomically restricted genes are involved in
the evolution of morphological novelties such as the cnidarian nematocyst.

The nematocyte, a cnidarian invention, expresses
cnidarian-specific genes
The nematocyte is a cell type exclusively restricted to cnidarians and - from an evolutionary perspective - is considered a
neuronal sensory cell [30-32]. During evolution, these neuron-like cells obviously became highly diverged and acquired
new cytological features such as the nematocysts (capsules).
Each nematocyst consists of an inner and outer capsule wall,
an inverted tubule armed with long arrays of spines, and an
operculum (for a recent review, see [4]). Development of this
cnidarian-specific structure requires complex genetic
machinery, consisting of at least two sets of proteins, regulatory transcription factors and structural proteins. One of the
few transcription factors identified up to now as being
involved in nematocyte differentiation, Hyzic, is a homolog of
the Zn-finger transcription factor gene zic/odd-paired. Hyzic
is expressed in the early nematocyte differentiation pathway
[32] and may act before, and possibly directly upstream of,
Cnash, a homolog of the proneural basic helix-loop helix transcription factor gene achaete-scute.
In contrast to these conserved transcription factors, the
downstream structural proteins responsible for putting the
nematocysts into shape appear to belong to the group of taxonomically restricted genes. Some of them, such as some
minicollagens, spinalin and NOWA, have been reported previously [5,8,33]. Interestingly, in addition to nematocysts,
novel proteins appear also to be essential components of
other structures of the nematocyte, such as the cnidocil, a cnidarian-specific mechanosensory ciliary structure acting as a
'trigger' for discharge of the nematocyst capsule. The central
core of the cnidocil contains a protein, nematocilin, that lacks
homologues outside Hydra [34]. Two paralogous sequences
of nematocilin are present in the Hydra genome and appear
to be the result of recent gene duplication. Nematocilin is
absent in the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis; it seems,
therefore, to be a gene restricted to the class Hydrozoa.

Nematocysts arguably are one of the most complex secretory
products produced by an animal cell [35]. How the different
nematocyst morphologies evolved is unknown. David and coworkers [4] have proposed that a diverse set of minicollagen
proteins together with a disulfide-linked network of not yet
identified fiber-like structures could have been instrumental
in the evolution of the different nematocyst morphologies.
Our discovery of striking complexity of nematocyte-specific
genes at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels may
indicate that bundles of protein variants produced by alternative splicing (Figures 4 and 5) and transcription at multiple
loci (Figures 6 and 7) contribute to the conformational and
structural flexibility of the nematocyst.
Alternative splicing has been proposed as the primary driver
of the evolution of phenotypic complexity in mammals [3638]. While alternative splicing is known to affect more than
half of all human genes [38], it has been unclear whether and
to what extent a similar mechanism operates in early branching metazoans. Our finding of numerous splice variants in
Hydra, therefore, was surprising and points to a strong conservation of splicing regulation throughout animal evolution.
Taken together, as described here and consistent with previous studies [5,8,33], the majority of genes encoding nematocyst components have no homologues in higher metazoans
and are unique to the cnidarian lineage.

question experimentally, we took advantage of the recent
development of transgenic techniques by embryo-microinjection [24], which offers a rich opportunity to expand research
activities in Hydra [13,39-41]. As expected, transgenic Hydra
appear to yield usable insight into the regulatory network
controlling expression of genes that lack sequence similarity
to known genes. According to the functional analysis of the
nb001 promoter (Figure 10), the transcriptional machinery
regulating TRG expression may involve not yet identified
transcription factors. Alternatively, regulatory elements for
conserved transcription factors may be highly diverged in
promoters of TRGs and, therefore, not detectable in the
present approach. Current efforts are directed towards identification of transcription factors causally involved in control
of TRG expression.

Conclusions

Taken together, although certainly much remains to be discovered about the role of TRGs in Hydra, the observations
presented here reaffirm the view [12,13] that taxon-specific
genes account for a substantial part of the Hydra genome and
may be of profound evolutionary significance both in animals
that reach back to the beginnings of metazoan life as well as
in more complex organisms.

Materials and methods
Transgenic Hydra contribute to understanding
regulatory evolution and transcriptional control of
TRGs
The finding that the differentiation of a taxon-specific cell
type, the nematocyte, involves the expression of taxon-specific genes promises to unveil novel aspects of the evolution of
this complex cell type in particular and of species-specific
traits in general. The work also raises an important question:
how do these novel genes interact with upstream transcriptional regulators? Do they contain binding sites for conserved
transcription factors? Or do they require novel transcription
factors? We have previously hypothesized [12] that taxonspecific genes in combination with the rewiring of the genetic
networks of conserved regulatory genes accomplish specification of cnidarian morphologies. Here, in order to address this

Generation of transgenic H. vulgaris AEP expressing
nb001:eGFP
Transgenic founder polyps expressing eGFP under control of
the nb001 promoter were produced at the University of Kiel
Transgenic Hydra Facility [44]. The transgenic construct was
made by placing the 1,035 bp nb001 promoter (-1,075 to +65
relative to the transcription initiation site and including the
signal peptide of nb001) in front of the reporter gene for eGFP
(Figure 10a). The resulting plasmid ligAB was injected into
Hydra embryos as described [24]. Out of 64 injected
embryos, 21 (32%) hatched, from which two lines contained
eGFP-positive nematocytes and no eGFP expression in any
other cell type. Initial founder transgenic animals were
expanded into a mass culture by clonal propagation by budding.
