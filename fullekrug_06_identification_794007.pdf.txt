Abstract
Background: MDCK cells derived from canine kidney are an important experimental model
system for investigating epithelial polarity in mammalian cells. Monoclonal antibodies against apical
gp114 and basolateral p58 have served as important tools in these studies. However, the molecular
identity of these membrane glycoproteins has not been known.
Results: We have identified the sialoglycoprotein gp114 as a dog homologue of the
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family. Gp114 was enriched
from tissue culture cells by subcellular fractionation and immunoaffinity chromatography. The
identification was based on tandem mass spectrometry and homology based proteomics. In
addition, the p58 basolateral marker glycoprotein was found to be the β subunit of Na+K+-ATPase.
Conclusion: Gp114 has been characterized previously regarding glycosylation dependent
trafficking and lipid raft association. The identification as a member of the canine CEACAM family
will enable synergy between the fields of epithelial cell biology and other research areas. Our
approach exemplifies how membrane proteins can be identified from species with unsequenced
genomes by homology based proteomics. This approach is applicable to any model system.

Background
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are the best
established mammalian model for studying epithelial cell
biology. MDCK cells differentiate into polarized cells
within a few days when grown on semi-permeable filter
supports. The cells form an epithelial monolayer, with
tight junctions separating an apical surface from a basolateral membrane facing the filter support and neighbouring cells. Both surfaces have a unique composition of
proteins and lipids [1,2]. Newly synthesized secretory pro-

teins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network and from there
transported to the apical and basolateral surfaces. Sorting
of proteins to the basolateral surface often relies on proteinaceous signals in cytoplasmically exposed domains of
the protein. Association with lipid rafts and glycosylation
have been proposed to be involved in apical targeting [3].
As marker proteins of the apical and basolateral plasma
membrane of MDCK cells we have previously raised monoclonal antibodies recognizing two membrane glycopro-

teins. The apical marker protein gp114 is a highly
glycosylated integral membrane protein with an apparent
molecular weight of 114 kDa [4,5]. The basolateral
marker protein has been termed p58 according to apparent molecular weight. In subconfluent monolayers of
MDCK cells, p58 localizes to both the basolateral and the
apical surface, but later disappears from the apical surface,
concomitantly with the development of a tight monolayer
[4].
The proteomic identification of membrane proteins of
MDCK cells, especially when highly glycosylated, still
presents a considerable challenge. First, it is rather difficult to isolate these proteins in sufficient amounts. Second, the canine genome is only partially available and EST
sequences do not adequately cover its proteome. Conventional methods of database searching rely heavily on
matching masses of intact peptides (peptide mass mapping) or their fragments (tandem mass spectrometry) to
the corresponding masses obtained by in silico processing
of protein sequences from database entries [6]. Stringent
matching of computed and measured masses increases
the specificity and the speed of database searching considerably, yet restricts the reach of proteomics methodologies
down to a handful of favourably covered model species
[7]. Recently developed methods of mass spectrometry
driven sequence similarity searches [8,9] utilize redundant, degenerate and partially inaccurate peptide
sequences, produced by de novo interpretation of tandem
mass spectra and are capable of identifying distant homologues of known proteins from phylogenetically distant
organisms [10].
In this work we applied immunoaffinity chromatography
to enrich the heavily glycosylated membrane proteins
gp114 and p58 and identify them by tandem mass spectrometry and homology driven proteomics.

Results and discussion
Enrichment of gp114 by immunoaffinity chromatography
Our first approach was based on the glycoprotein properties of gp114 [5]. A membrane fraction of MDCK cells was
enriched for glycoproteins by lectin affinity chromatography using wheat germ agglutinin. The 114 kDa region of
the gel electrophoresis pattern (Figure 1a) was analyzed
by mass spectrometry. Six peptides matched canine intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Other proteins
identified were not apical proteins (α2-, β1-integrins,
CD44, LAMP-2). A few peptides from low abundant spectra could not be assigned to any protein. Antibodies
against dog ICAM-1 immunoprecipitated a 114 kDa protein, but this protein was not recognized by antibodies
against gp114 (not shown). Therefore we concluded that
gp114 is a protein different from ICAM-1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/8

Immunoaffinity columns established with mouse anti
gp114 IgG were used for a more efficient enrichment of
gp114. Detergent soluble membrane protein fractions
were applied to immunoaffinity columns, and the eluted
fractions concentrated by methanol-chloroform extraction-precipitation. Surprisingly, gp114 did not partition
with other proteins, but remained in the aqueous phase,
probably due to its high glycosylation (see the flow chart
of the purification of gp114, Figure 1b). Gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining revealed a single
faint band corresponding to gp114 (Figure 1c). In parallel, gp114 was first immunoprecipitated and then enzymatically deglycosylated since we anticipated that the
high amount of glycosylation might affect the efficiency of
tryptic digestion prior to the analysis by mass spectrometry (Figure 1c).
Identification of gp114 by mass spectrometry
The MALDI TOF spectrum of a tryptic digest of the gp114
band contained only two peptide signals, which is a surprisingly low number for a protein of this size (Figure 2,
inset). Since MALDI and electrospray spectra acquired
from the same digest usually demonstrate different peptide profiles [11], the digest was further investigated by
nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Figure 2).
The Mascot database search with uninterpreted tandem
mass spectra gave only three matches to immunoglobulin
peptides, although 40 precursor ions were fragmented.
The major peptide peaks in the spectrum remained unassigned. Therefore the unmatched tandem mass spectra
were manually interpreted de novo by considering mass
differences between adjacent peaks of fragment ions (Figure 3). This approach only rendered low confidence
amino acid sequences since it is not known if the considered ions indeed belong to the same fragment series [12].
Furthermore, spectra from multiply charged precursor
ions contained non-overlapping fragment series with different charge states, which did not cover the complete
peptide sequence. Therefore the interpretation of each
spectrum produced several inaccurate, partially redundant
and incomplete peptide sequence proposals (Table 1). We
then merged peptide sequence candidates obtained by the
interpretation of all good quality tandem mass spectra
into a single search string and employed the mass spectrometry-driven BLAST (MS BLAST) protocol for the identification of proteins by sequence similarity searching
[9,10]. The database search confidently hit proteins of the
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein family (Table
1). The table shows only the first protein homologue of
the database search, carcinoembryonic antigen-related
cell adhesion molecule 8 (CEACAM8), but other CEA
family proteins gave the same alignment with an identical
score. Remarkably, not a single alignment covered the corresponding sequence completely. The conservation of
gp114 across species is apparently not sufficient for an

identification by cross-species matching of acquired tandem mass spectra matching using Mascot software [13].
In silico analysis of gp114
The CEA protein family consists of two separate branches,
the membrane associated CEACAM proteins and the soluble pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG). The
CEACAM proteins are extensively spliced yielding numerous isoforms. In addition, some CEACAM proteins are
modified to include a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchor instead of a transmembrane domain (reviewed in
[14,15]). Gp114 is an integral membrane protein ([16]
and references therein) and belongs therefore to the
CEACAM subgroup.

MS BLAST searches could only be performed against a
protein database. Once gp114 had been identified as a
canine CEACAM protein, we used the human CEACAM1
nucleotide sequence to search for homologous genes. One
genomic sequence (FE8, see Methods for details) contained an exon sequence homologous to human
CEACAM1. Five of the sequenced peptides could be
matched exactly to this translated exon sequence (Table
1). Other canine genomic sequences homologous to
human CEACAM1 were either identical to FE8 or did not
match the sequenced peptides. Thus identical peptides
identified in the dog genome validated the sequence similarity identification by MS BLAST. One of the peptides
(#6) had also been detected in our first analysis of lectin

bound 114 kDa proteins, but could not be assigned at that
time. This confirmed that gp114 was indeed present in the
lectin bound 114 kDa fraction, but could not be identified
on the basis of a single peptide sequence.
While this manuscript was under evaluation, the canine
genome became publicly available [17]. A tentative amino
acid sequence was obtained (see Methods for details)
which was significantly similar to human CEACAM family
proteins 1, 5, 8 and 6. CEACAM 5, 8 and 6 are GPI
anchored proteins which have been reported to be
expressed in humans only [14]. Furthermore, the predicted molecular weights of the mature proteins (without
N-glycans) are 54 kDa for human CEACAM1, 71 kDa for
CEACAM 5 and 32 kDa for CEACAM 8 and 6. Only the
molecular weight of human CEACAM1 corresponds reasonably to the size of deglycosylated gp114 [18]. Deglycosylated gp114 (Figure 1c) gave the same two
characteristic fragments as the untreated protein by
MALDI TOF analysis (not shown). Other names for
CEACAM1 are biliary glycoprotein, BGP1, TM-CEA and
CD66a [19]. In summary, gp114 is a dog CEACAM protein, most likely CEACAM1.
Properties of canine CEACAM/gp114
Apical sorting of gp114/canine CEACAM occurs directly
to the surface with a half time of 45 minutes [16]. The glycans are of the N-glycosylated complex type containing
sialic acid, contributing about half of the apparent molecular weight of gp114 [5,18]. However, in MDCK-RCA
cells deficient in terminal glycosylation due to an inactivated UDP-galactose transporter [20,21], gp114 was missorted to the basolateral surface, whereas targeting of
other apical proteins was not affected. Furthermore, endocytosis of gp114 is also highly increased in these cells
compared to a very slow internalization in MDCK wild
type cells [18]. Independently, gp114 was identified as a
major protein undergoing bidirectional transcytosis in
MDCK-RCA cells [22]. Antibody crosslinking shows that
gp114 coclusters with lipid raft associated proteins in the
apical membrane of MDCK cells [23].

Lipid raft microdomain association and glycosylation
dependent trafficking (basolateral missorting, endocytosis, transcytosis) have not been reported for CEACAM proteins so far. Reversible association with lipid
microdomains has been put forward as a core mechanism
in the regulation of signal transduction at the plasma
membrane [24]. Our identification enables the integration of the data obtained for gp114 with the characterization of CEACAM proteins from other approaches.
Identification of p58
The p58 protein was enriched by immunoaffinity chromatography, similarly to gp114. The trypsin digested

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/7/8

band of p58 was identified as the β-chain of canine
Na+K+-ATPase by peptide mass fingerprinting. 15 peptides
were matched to the masses of corresponding tryptic peptides with better than 100 ppm mass tolerance. The
MOWSE score of 143 exceeded the significance threshold
of 72 and thus the identification was considered confident.
The β-subunit of Na+K+-ATPase contains three N-linked
glycans, which is consistent with the apparent molecular
weight of the expressed protein. The association of the βsubunit with the α-subunit is required for the enzyme
complex to reach the plasma membrane (for a review, see
[25]). The polarized expression of Na+K+-ATPase in epithelia depends on the association of β-subunits from
neighbouring cells [26]. The molecular weight of the αsubunit corresponds to the protein coprecipitating with
p58 antibodies under non-denaturing conditions (not
shown). Na+K+-ATPase has also been used in other cell
systems as a basolateral marker protein.
MS identification of proteins from organisms with
unsequenced genomes
Mass spectrometry driven sequence similarity searches
now make it possible to characterize proteins from model
organisms with unsequenced genomes by their similarity
to already available sequences. Computational simulations suggested that almost all proteins within mammalian phylogenetic lineage could be identified by MS BLAST
sequence similarity searches using 10 sequenced tryptic
peptides, which is a rather frequent outcome of tandem
mass spectrometric experiments [10]. Importantly, the
method imposes rather loose requirements on the quality
of peptide sequences and thus paves the way to complete
automation of the analytical routine. Mass spectrometric
characterization of unknown proteins can be performed
in a layered approach [7,27] i.e. conventional proteomics
methods could be applied first to identify highly conserved proteins that share identical peptide sequences
with their known homologues, and sequence similarity
searches would only be applied to a selection of non-conserved proteins once the conventional methods failed.
Thus we might anticipate that the scope of proteomics
methods will be able to support biochemical research in
any vertebrate model.

Conclusion
The apical marker glycoprotein gp114 has been enriched
from tissue culture cells and identified by tandem mass
spectrometry as canine carcinoembryonic antigen-related
cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM). We exemplify the difficulties associated with identifying glycoproteins from
model systems without sequenced genomes, and how to
overcome them. The general strategy provides a frame-

Doubly charged fragment series rendered the sequence PGDTASLTWF which was further extended toward the N-terminus using very low abundant ions in the m/z range > 1100 (not
shown), but the sequence of the two N-terminal amino acid residues remained ambiguous (VL or LV). It was possible to determine the C-terminal amino acid (K) and a short sequence stretch (TVLP) spaced from the C-terminal lysine by two or three
unknown amino acid residues (X). Bridging between the sequence stretches PGDTASLTWF and TVLP could have been
achieved by one of the three isobaric combination of amino acid residues, and the order of amino acid residues remained
unknown. Hence the peptide might contain the sequence WF-QGET-VL, or WF-QEGT-VL, or WF-QADT-VL, or WF-QDATVL..., etc.

work which should be useful for many related
approaches.
Known properties of gp114 such as glycosylation dependent transcytosis and association with lipid microdomains
involved in signal transduction can now be integrated
with the knowledge about CEACAM proteins obtained by
different approaches.

adjusted to 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and filter sterilized.
Supernatant containing 1 mg of IgG was crosslinked with
dimethylpimelimidate to immobilized protein G according to supplier's recommendations (Pierce, Rockford IL).
Membrane preparation
MDCK cells were grown on plastic dishes corresponding
to a surface area of 0.9 m2 equivalent to 3.6 × 109 cells. A
postmitochondrial supernatant was obtained by homogenizing cells in 0.25 M sucrose, 3 mM imidazol pH 7.4
(13× pushing through a 22-gauge needle) and centrifugation at 4,000 × g. Membranes were pelleted for 30 minutes
at 100,000 × g, and treated on ice for 30 minutes with
TNE1 (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA)
containing 1% w/v Triton x-100. Under these conditions,
p58 and gp114 are efficiently solubilized. Not solubilized
membranes were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×
g for 30 minutes, and the supernatant (19 mg total protein) used for immunoaffinity chromatography.

WGA lectin affinity chromatography
Solubilized membranes were adjusted to WGA buffer (10
mM HEPES 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Tx-100) and circulated o/n over a 5 ml WGAagarose (AmershamPharmacia) column at 0.2 ml/min.
Washing was with 10× column volume of WGA buffer,
and elution in 1 ml steps with WGA buffer containing 0.3
M N-acetylglucosamine.
Immunoaffinity chromatography
The solubilized membrane preparations were passed
three times over the IgG-protein G sepharose columns.
Columns were washed with 50 ml of TNE2 (10 mM Tris
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1% w/
v Tx-100. Elution with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.6, 0.1% w/v Tx100 was in 1 ml steps. Eluted fractions were neutralized,
concentrated by spin columns (Centrikon YM-30), and
then desalted and precipitated by methanol/chloroform
extraction [28]. Aqueous supernatants were lyophilized
and found to contain high amounts of gp114, but no p58.
Highly glycosylated proteins have been reported to partition into the aqueous phase under these conditions [29].

Immunoprecipitation followed by enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGaseF (Roche) was according to standard
procedures.
Mass spectrometry
Proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
were visualized by Coomassie staining, and bands were
excised and digested by trypsin (Promega) as described
[30]. 1 µl aliquots of digests were analyzed by MALDI peptide mapping on a Reflex IV MALDI TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) using AnchorChip™
targets as described [31]. Tryptic peptides were extracted
from the gel matrix by 5% formic acid and acetonitrile,
pooled and lyophilized. Peptides were sequenced by
nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a QSTAR
Pulsar i quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(MDS Sciex, Canada). 40 tandem mass spectra were
acquired from the digest of the gp114 band. Uninterpreted tandem mass spectra were first used to search a protein sequence database MSDB using Mascot software
(Matrix Science Ltd, UK) v.1.8 installed on a local server.
No restrictions on species of origin or protein molecular
weight were imposed. All Mascot hits were further verified
by manual inspection of matched tandem mass spectra.
Spectra, which were not matched by Mascot, were manually interpreted de novo. The interpretation of each spectra rendered a few degenerate, redundant and incomplete
peptide sequence candidates, which were assembled into
a single MS BLAST [9] query string as described previously
[32]. MS BLAST searches against the non-redundant protein database nrdb95 were performed on a web server
[33].
In silico analysis
The human CD66a sequence was blasted against a dog
genomic database [34]. The best match was obtained with
sequence G630P617675FE8.T0, which was then translated into the amino acid sequence. After the dog genome
became available, we repeated our homology searches.
Since the FE8 data showed that four of the sequenced peptides (#2-#4-#5-#3) form an almost continuous stretch,
we could probe the new (nucleotide) databases now with
a 65 amino acid sequence. Eight significant alignments
were found, all on chromosome I. The top three alignments were investigated more closely (exclusion limit:
better than 90% over 60 amino acids, taking into account
that MS cannot distinguish between Ile and Leu or isobaric amino acid combinations). Only one translated
nucleotide sequence contained peptides #1 and #6. Using
human CEACAM family proteins for guidance, a tentative
amino acid surfaced out of merging putative exons. This
sequence was 58–61% identical and 67–71% similar to
human CEACAM family proteins 1, 5, 8 and 6.
