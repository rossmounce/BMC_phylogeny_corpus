Abstract
Introduction Breast tumors lacking the estrogen receptor-α
(ER-α) have increased incidence of resistance to therapy and
poorer clinical prognosis.
Methods Whole tissue sections from 16 cryopreserved breast
cancer tumors that were either positive or negative for the ER
(eight ER positive and eight ER negative) were differentially
analyzed by multiplex imaging of two-dimensional PAGE gels
using 54 cm isoelectric focusing. Differentially detected spots of
Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1)
were shown to differ in phosphorylation status by differential two
dimensional
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
of
phosphatase-treated tumor proteins. Site directed mutagenesis
was used to create putative phosphorylation site point mutants
in PGRMC1. Stable transfectants of these mutants in MCF7
cells were assayed for their survival after oxidative stress, and for
AKT kinase phosphorylation. Immune fluorescence using antiPGRMC1 monoclonal antibody 5G7 was performed on breast
cancer tissue microarrays.
Results Proteins significantly differentially abundant between
estrogen receptor negative and estrogen receptor positive
tumors at the 0.1% level were consistent with published profiles,
suggesting an altered keratin pool, and increased inflammation

and wound responses in estrogen receptor negative tumors.
Two of three spots of PGRMC1 were more abundant in
estrogen receptor negative tumors. Phosphatase treatment of
breast tumor proteins indicated that the PGRMC1 isoforms
differed in their phosphorylation status. Simultaneous mutation
of PGRMC1 serine-56 and serine-181 fully abrogated the
sensitivity of stably transfected MCF7 breast cancer cells to
peroxide-induced cell death. Immune fluorescence revealed that
PGRMC1 was primarily expressed in ER-negative basal
epithelial cells of mammary ductules. Even in advanced tumors,
high levels of ER or PGRMC1 were almost mutually exclusive in
individual cells. In five out of five examined ductal in situ breast
cancers of comedo type, PGRMC1 was expressed in glucose
transporter 1 negative or positive poorly oxygenated cells
surrounding the necrotic core, surrounded by a more distal halo
of ER-positive cells.

Conclusions PGRMC1 phosphorylation may be involved in the
clinical differences that underpin breast tumors of differing ER
status.

Introduction
Breast cancer is among the most common forms of cancer
observed in women, with approximately 185,000 new cases
and 40,000 deaths estimated in the USA in 2008 [1]. Endogenous estrogens, which have effects on many organs, are
thought to play a major role in the development of the breast,
suggesting that increased sensitivity or longer exposures to
estrogens is involved in greater risk for tumorigenesis [2-4].
The classical estrogen receptor (ER)-α is found in 50% to
80% of breast tumors and ER-α status is essential in making
clinical decisions about endocrine therapy with anti-estrogens,
which inhibit the mitogenic activity of estrogens in breast cancer. There are three classes of anti-estrogens currently in clinical use: selective estrogen receptor modulators (for example,
tamoxifen); aromatase inhibitors; and 'pure' estrogen antagonists such as fulvestrant, which – like tamoxifen – binds to ERs
competitively. However, in contrast to tamoxifen, fulvestrant's
binding leads to rapid degradation and loss of the ER-α protein [5,6].
Clinically, a positive ER-α status correlates with favorable
prognostic features, including a lower rate of cell proliferation
and histologic evidence of tumor differentiation. ER-α status is
also prognostic for the site of gross metastatic spread. For
reasons unknown, ER-α-positive tumors are more likely to initially manifest clinically apparent metastases in bone, soft tissue, or the reproductive and genital tracts, whereas ER-αnegative tumors more commonly metastasize to brain and liver.
Several studies have correlated ER-α expression with lower
Matrigel invasiveness and reduced metastatic potential of
breast cancer cell lines [7,8]. Moreover, when ER-α-positive
cells are implanted in nude mice, tumors appear only in the
presence of estrogens and are poorly metastatic as compared
with those developed from ER-α-negative breast cancer cell
lines [9,10]. This paradox suggests that ER-α expression
could be associated with or involved in pathways that hinder
cancer progression.

used to stratify breast cancers into different fundamental
groups [13,14]. One set of biomarkers comprises the family of
cytokeratins (CKs). They can be grouped into the 'luminal CKs'
(CK-7/8, CK-18, and CK-19) and into the 'basal CKs' (CK-5/
6 and CK-14) [13].
In addition to these molecular portraits, it has been shown that
expression patterns present in primary breast cancers are also
observed in their respective metastases [15]. Other gene
expression profiles have distinguished breast cancers according to the differential expression of a wound response signature. More than 20 years ago, based on histologic similarities
between tumors and wound healing, Dvorak [16] proposed
that the tumor stroma is 'normal wound healing gone awry'.
Since then it has been discovered that genes induced in a
fibroblast serum-response program are expressed in tumors
by the tumor cells themselves, by tumor-associated fibroblasts, or both [17]. The molecular features that define this
wound-like phenotype are evident at an early clinical stage,
persist during treatment, and predict increased risk for metastasis and death in breast, lung, and gastric carcinomas.
We previously published a system for proteomic analysis
involving differential radioactive labeling of samples and separation using 54 cm immobilized pH gradient (IPG)-isoelectric
focusing (IEF) [18,19]. In the present study we used this system to identify protein species with pronounced and consistent differential abundance between sample categories. We
employed large homogenous invasive ductal breast carcinomas, which are well suited for conventional proteomics analysis, but are becoming increasingly rare because of improved
screening programs. Differential proteomic analysis of pooled
tumors that were selected on the basis of being either ER-αpositive or ER-α-negative unexpectedly revealed differentially
abundant phosphorylated isoforms of the cytochrome b5domain protein progesterone receptor membrane component
(PGRMC)1 (reviewed in [20]) between these tumors.

Materials and methods
At the transcriptome level, gene expression analysis has
revealed that different molecular subtypes exist within ER-αpositive and ER-α-negative breast cancers, and these are
associated with different clinical outcomes. ER-α-positive
tumors exist in at least two subtypes, luminal A and luminal B,
which vary markedly in terms of gene expression and prognosis [11]. Conversely, hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer comprises two distinct subtypes, the Her2 (human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2) subtype and the basal-like
subtype [11,12], which differ in biology and behavior, and are
both associated with a poor outcome.
Importantly, a very similar subdivision of breast cancers has
been produced based upon immunohistochemistry, conducted to analyze patterns of protein expression in tumor sections, which suggests that a few protein biomarkers can be

Quantitative population multiplex proteomics
The tumors used in the present study were from a tissue
archive previously described [19]. Tumors with large homogenous lesion regions were selected, assayed for RNA integrity,
and classified as being either positive or negative for ER-α, as
described previously [19]. Frozen tumor sections of 10 μm
were lysed directly into SDS buffer, separately iodinated in
inverse replicates with each of 125I and 131I, and separated
by 54 cm daisy chain IPG-IEF after sample pooling, as
described previously [18]. Radioimaging, image processing
with the Pic/GREG software (Fraunhofer Institute for Applied
Information Technology, 53754 Sankt Augustin, Germany),
statistical analysis of the gels, and identification of proteins by
mass spectrometry were performed as described previously
[19]. There were no identifications of multiple proteins from
single spots. The peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) MASCOT

scores [21] of all identifications are provided, indicating the
reliability of individual probability-based protein identification
assignments.
Shrimp alkaline phosphatase analysis
Cryogenic slices from six patients (30 slices T433, 40 slices
T443, 40 slices T469, 40 slices T470, 35 slices T623, and 30
slices T640) were each extracted with 200 μl aliquots of
shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP)-dephosphorylation buffer
(50 mmol/l Tris [pH 8.5], 5 mmol/l MgCl2, 0.25% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, supplemented with 1× EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor
cocktail [F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland]). This
precooled buffer was added directly on ice to the frozen slices
in Eppendorf tubes and the tissue was mechanically homogenized using a plastic pellet pestle. Tubes were vortexed and
incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C, followed by centrifugation for
15 minutes at 14,000 g at 4°C. Supernatants were collected
and pooled together, and the protein concentration was
assayed using the BCA method, as described previously [19].
The yield was approximately 4 mg protein. Thirty units of SAP
in 30 μl were added into 800 μg of protein in 400 μl in SAPdephosphorylation buffer, followed by mixing and incubation
for 16 hours at 37°C. In parallel, a mock incubation control
was performed on 800 μg protein in the same buffer without
addition of SAP and containing the following phosphatase
inhibitors: activated vanadate, sodium fluoride, and sodium
glycerophosphate at final concentrations of 1 mmol/l, 5 mmol/
l, and 5 mmol/l, respectively. The incubation was performed in
parallel at 37°C for 16 hours. After incubation the proteins
were frozen at -80°C. A nonincubated raw lysate control containing 800 μg protein in 400 μl SAP buffer was frozen at 80°C without additions or incubation. Frozen protein mixtures
were thawed, precipitated, and resuspended at 1 μg/μl in boiling 0.1 M Tris, 2% SDS (pH8.5). Sixty micrograms of protein
were then used for iodination with each of 125I or 131I. Differential inverse replicate ProteoTope analysis was as described
above for 54 cm daisy chain IPG-IEF after rehydration loading
overnight to pH 5 to 6 IPG (ProteoSys AG, Mainz, Germany).
Cell culture
MCF-7 cells stably transfected with PGRMC1 and mutants,
respectively, were established. Five micrograms of expression
plasmid pcDNA3.1 containing hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged mPR
(PGRMC1) wild-type or HA-tagged mutants S56A, S180A,
S56A/S180A, S56A/C128S/S180A, Y138F, Y179F, or
Y179F/S180A were transfected into MCF-7 breast cancer
cells. For transfections, a transfection device and kits from
AMAXA Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were used, in
accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. A total
of 2 × 106 cells were transfected with circular plasmids and
plated with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-medium
for 24 hours. Then medium was changed to RPMI medium
complete medium containing 60 μg/ml hygromycin B and cells
were cultured for 2 weeks for selection of stable integration

events. After 2 weeks single colonies had formed and limiting
dilution assays were performed to select for colonies grown
from a single cell. Colonies were trypsinized, counted, and
diluted in twofold dilutions to obtain clones.
For functional assays MCF-7 cells and derivatives were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin.
PGRMC1 expression in all cell lines was confirmed by Western blot using an HA-specific monoclonal antibody [22]. Charcoal/dextran-treated FCS was obtained from Hyclone (Acros
Organics N.V., Geel, 2440 Belgium; Catalogue Nr SH30068).
Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured using an assay that utilized the
fluorometric determination of ATP levels as an indicator of cell
viability, namely the ATP-TCA kit (TCA-100; DCS Innovative
Diagnostik Systeme, Hamburg, Germany), as follows. Cells
were incubated with 50 μl tumor cell extraction reagent and
50 μl RPMI medium for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then,
50 μl supernatant was transferred into a 96-well plate and 50
μl chemoluminescence reagent was added. Chemoluminescence was quantified using a luminescence reader (Berthold,
Bad Wildbad, Germany). The fluorometric readout is presented in relative light units (higher relative light unit values are
associated with higher ATP levels and therefore higher levels
of cell viability).
Phosphorylation of Akt
A total of 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and cultured overnight at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide in RPMI
medium and 10% FCS. Cells were treated with 1 mmol/l H2O2
in RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide. Subsequently, cell culture dishes were transferred immediately to
ice and lysed in M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent
containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was
determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (both from
Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Twenty micrograms of protein was
loaded per lane onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and separated
by electrophoresis.

The gel was blotted on Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane
(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and blocked overnight at
4°C using 5% milk in TBST buffer. Western blot for P-Akt was
performed using rabbit anti-P-Akt 1/2/3 (1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature. The following antibodies were incubated with a single membrane: mouse anti-Akt-1 to detect total Akt (1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-HA-probe to detect
HA-tagged exogenous PGRMC1 (Y-11; 1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-actin (I-19; 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). As secondary antibodies, either goat anti-rabbit IgG-horse raddish peroxidase (1:2,500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (H+L; 1:2,000;
Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) followed by

streptavidin/HRP (1:1,000; DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) were applied. Chemoluminescence was generated
using ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham).
The signals were measured with a Lumi-Imager (Boehringer,
Mannheim, Germany).
Immune fluorescence analysis
Monoclonal anti-PGRMC1 antibody 5G7 was generated in
mice inoculated with the cytoplasmic domain (Δ43hpr6) of
bacterially expressed PGRMC1, representing a 25 kDa protein of which the amino-terminal 43 amino acids of hpr6 were
deleted. For immune fluorescence analysis, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue was used. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) of a tissue microarray were prepared and labeled
with antibodies, in accordance with standard protocols. Sections were deparaffinized and boiled in 10 mmol/l citrate buffer
for 4 minutes in a pressure cooker to expose the antigen.
Blocking of unspecific antibody binding sites was performed
with goat normal serum (10% dilution in antibody diluent
[DakoCytomation; Dako Denmark A/S, 2600 Glostrup, Denmark]). Slides were incubated for 60 minutes with the first antibody and rinsed in three changes of phosphate-buffered
saline for 1 minute each. The secondary antibody was then
applied to the slide for 60 minutes. Sections were washed
again to remove the unbound antibody. For counter staining,
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) was used to embed labeled
tissue. Labeling reactions were performed in a humified chamber. The following primary antibodies were used: 5G7 monoclonal antibody (1:10), ER-α (1: 200; DCS, Hamburg,
Germany) and glucose transporter (GLUT)1 (1:100; Dianova,
Hamburg, Germany). Goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 and
goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 (both 1:1,000; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were used as secondary antibodies. Preincubation of the 5G7 with recombinant PGRMC1 protein was
performed overnight at 4°C at a protein concentration of 0.5
μg/ml. Control was treated in the same way but without
recombinant protein.

Results
Quantitative multiplex proteomic analysis of pooled
tumor samples
We applied a sample pooling strategy to the analysis of clinical
protein samples, which permitted generation of effective
results from limited amounts of sample [19]. Eight ER-α-positive tumors and eight ER-α-negative tumors were randomly
assigned to the subpools summarized in Table 1, each subpool containing normalized equal amounts of protein from two
tumors. Pooled samples were differentially quantified according to the regimen summarized in Table 1 (subpool ER+1
[containing T378 and T392] was differentially compared with
subpool ER-1 [containing T433 and T443], ER+2 was compared with ER-2, ER+3 was compared with ER-3, and ER+4
was compared with ER-4). Thus, there were four differential
comparisons, each performed in inverse replicate 54 cm serial
IEF-IPG to generate eight IEF samples and 24× two-dimen-

sional PAGE gels, which were differentially quantified by ProteoTope imaging. Additionally, proteins from all eight tumors
from each category were pooled into two master pools, which
were also compared by ProteoTope (as presented in Figure
1). Similar gel sets were performed for the paired tumor pools
in Table 1 and quantified. Spots were matched across gels,
and their intensities were analyzed relative to ER-α status.
Synthetic average gel images of the comparisons of pools
from Table 1 were constructed by computer, as shown in Figure 2. The two-dimensional PAGE positions of the statistically
most significant differential protein spots identified by mass
spectrometry are indicated in Figure 2, and their identities are
shown in Figure 3. In total, proteins from 325 spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of
flight (MALDI-TOF) PMF with MASCOT scores greater than
70, of which 72 spots represented 16 proteins that were identified in more than one protein spot (Additional file 1 [Table
S1]).
The differential results observed for this study (Figure 3) provided a protein profile that was consistent with published studies on this clinical system [23-25]. The profile of differentially
abundant proteins detected between ER-α-positive and ER-αnegative tumors (Figure 3) shares similarity with the recently
reported gene expression profile identified as being specific
for the wound response reported for ER-α-negative tumors
[17,26]. In the wound response, a genetic program is activated when cells within a tissue are exposed to serum proteins, indicative of permeabilization of the vascular
endothelium and local injury. This expression profile provides
an index for the extent of wound healing activity in cancers,
and this correlates negatively with overall survival and positively with the incidence of metastasis [27,28]. Our results are
consistent with the previously reported activated wound
response in ER-α-negative tumors. In particular, CK-8, cathepsin B, heat shock protein 27, and ferritin light chain were less
abundant in ER-α-negative tumors than in ER-α-positive
tumors, whereas vimentin, apolipoprotein A1, cyclophin A,
transferrin, carbonic anhydrase, and PGRMC1 were more
abundant. This is reminiscent of the wound response signature reported by Velardo and coworkers [26], in which
PGRMC1 was upregulated late in the response (presented in
Supplementary Table 1 of the report by Velardo and coworkers; AI010357 EST [VEMA] ventral midline antigen =
PGRMC1). The serum proteins apolipoprotein A-I and albumin
were recently found to be more abundant in a proteomic analysis of injured spinal cord tissue, whereas heat shock protein
27 was found to be downregulated in this wound response relevant system [29]. Taken together, these data indicate that the
number of patients analyzed suitably identified differences in
protein abundances that were strongly correlated with the
presence of the ER-α, indicating that our experimental system
yielded results that reflected the biology underlying the ER-αpositive versus ER-α-negative test design.

compared with proteins from pooled ER-negative labeled tumors with I-131. The upper panels show the individual signal detected for each isotope,
depicted in false spectral color. The signals for each isotope were normalized against each other for total relative intensity in the lower dual channel
images, where the signal for I-125 is blue, the signal for I-131 is orange, and equal amounts of both signals produces gray or black signal. Two pure
sources each of I-131 and I-125, as well as a 50% mixture of both isotopes, are measured on 2 mm sources pipetted next to each dried gel as imaging controls. The pH ranges of the 18 cm IPGs used for serial IEF are indicated above the panels, and the radioactive iodine isotope signals
depicted in each panel are indicated on the right. In this experiment all iodination reactions were performed on 60 μg protein. In the examples shown,
the I-125 signal is systematically stronger in all gels (compare lower panels for individual isotopes). Arrows in the enlarged lower panel show three
spots identified as PGRMC1. (b) The top panels show the inverse replicate experiment of panel a, where sample ER+1 is labeled with I-131, and

Synthetic average composite gels showing spots matched across all eight IEF gels (24 SDS-PAGE gels). Images were generated using the GREG
IEF gels (24 SDS-PAGE gels)
software and labels were added manually. The average ER-positive signal is indicated as blue, the average ER-negative signal is indicated as orange,
and equal intensities of both signals give gray or black pixels. Spot numbers correspond to Figure 3, whereby spots from pH4-5 gel are designated
with spot numbers 1-nn, spots from pH5-6 gel are designated with spot numbers 2-nn, and spots from pH6-9 gel are designated with spot numbers
3-nn. For example, PGRMC1 spot 1–24 from Figure 3 is the left-most spot labeled in the pH4-5 gel. Colored signals without spot labels were either
unidentifiable or were not consistently differential, with average intensities being markedly influenced by one or few samples and thereby failing to
achieve statistical differential significance across the dataset. ER, estrogen receptor; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PGMRC, progesterone receptor

PGRMC1 is more abundant in ER-α-negative tumors
PGRMC1, which had not previously been directly associated
with ER-α status in breast cancer, was detected in three separate spots. Two of these were significantly more abundant in
ER-α-negative tumors (Figure 3), and these were the more
basic two spots (Figure 2).

protein spots, this provides evidence that PGRMC1 is more
highly phosphorylated in ER-α-positive than in ER-α-negative
tumors. Because phosphatase treatment did not totally eliminate any PGRMC1 spots, it is possible that protein species
within these two-dimensional PAGE spots may also differ by
modifications other than phosphorylation.

Two-dimensional PAGE isoforms of PGRMC1 differ in
phosphorylation status
To assess whether differences in distinct two-dimensional
PAGE spot isoforms were due to distinctly phosphorylated
species of PGRMC1, we treated proteins from primary breast
tumors with SAP and quantified differences in protein isoform
abundances using inverse-replicate ProteoTope (Figure 4).
Importantly, SAP-dependent differences in relative signal
intensity were reproducibly detected in inverse replicate
labeled experiments, in which the intensity of spot 1–24 was
reduced upon SAP treatment, and the intensity of spot 1–22
increased after SAP treatment. The middle spot 1–23 exhibited variable abundance changes, perhaps because of experimental variation. By contrast, when the mock treatment was
compared with the raw extract, the ratios between both samples approximated 1:1. Qualitatively similar overall results
were observed in an independent replicate (data not shown).
Thus, the differences in intensity of respective spots between
samples were not due to the incubation, but rather were due
to the presence of phosphatase activity in the incubation mixture. This result demonstrates that the most acidic PGRMC1
spots can be dephosphorylated, whereupon they migrate to
one of the more basic spots in two-dimensional PAGE. Taken
together with the results presented in Figure 3 for these three

Phosphorylation site mutants of PGRMC1 can affect cell
survival
Based upon some of the predicted and observed phosphorylation sites for PGRMC1 [20,30,31], we constructed a panel
of HA-tagged PGRMC1 expression plasmids based upon
pcDNA3_MPR_3HA [32], with amino acid substitutions at the
positions of serine-56, serine-180, tyrosine-138, and tyrosine179 (Figure 5). Because of the proposed role of disulfide
bridging to form a 56 kDa dimeric form of PGRMC1, one of
the mutants also involved substitution of the conserved
cysteine-128 to serine. This residue is the only cysteine in the
human PGRMC1 cytochrome b5 domain and is the only phylogenetically conserved cysteine in the protein. On the surface
of the protein at the carboxyl-terminal end of helix 3, this
cysteine is ideally situated on the protein to physically interact
with other proteins (Figure 5) [20].

Stable expression of PGRMC1 (Hpr6.6) enhances the susceptibility of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to lethality caused by
H2O2 exposure [22]. We transfected MCF-7 cells with each of
the PGRMC1 expression plasmids from Figure 5 and established stable transfectant cell lines. Expression of exogenous
PGRMC1 was confirmed in all cell lines using an anti-HA tag
antibody. The different cell lines exhibited grossly similar cell

treatment with 50 μmol/l H2O2, the viability of untransfected
control cells was reduced, and the expression of wild-type
PGRMC1 greatly sensitized cells to H2O2 stress, resulting in
lower cell viability (Figure 6b), as expected. Expression of
many of the mutant PGRMC1 proteins produced viability comparable with that of nontransfected MCF-7 control cells. However, two of the cell lines (S56A/S180A and Y179F/S180A)
exhibited higher viability levels than native MCF-7 cells. The
S56A/S180A-expressing cells appeared impervious to the
effects of H2O2, whereas the response of Y179F/S180Aexpressing cells varied from marginal survival rates (Figure 6b)

to no enhanced survival in other experiments (Figure 7; data
not shown).
The above experiment was performed with replicate design
but using charcoal/dextran-treated 10% FCS. Charcoal-stripping removes steroid hormones and other hydrophobic components such as cholesterol from the FCS. All cell lines were
able to grow in this medium (Figure 6c); however, the degree
of viability was greatly impaired in the presence of H2O2 for all
cell lines except the S56A/S180A double mutant (Figure 6d).
Therefore, charcoal pretreatment of FCS possibly removes
some component that is necessary for the marginal survival of
PGRMC1 mutant Y179F/S180A but not for S56A/S180A.

Individual tumors are designated by their tumor bank T registration numbers. Experimental, clinical, and histopathological parameters are listed.
Eight ER-positive and eight ER-negative tumors are grouped into four pools of two tumors each, as indicated. Clinical data comprise the following:
tumor status ranging from pT1 (tumor 2 cm or smaller in greatest dimension) to pT3 (tumor >5 cm); lymph node status from pN0 (no regional
lymph node metastasis) to pN3 (metastasis to ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes [s]) and pNx (regional lymph node cannot be assessed);
tumor grade from 2 (moderately differentiated) to 3 (poorly differentiated); histopathologic data for ER and PR (0 = undetectable; 1 to 3 = weakly
positive; 4 to 7 = moderately positive; 8–12 = highly positive); and Her2/neu-status (0 = negative, positive +1 to +3). Ages for each patient are
given in years. aNo gene amplification detected. x, pNx regional lymphnodes cannot be assessed. ER, estrogen receptor; HER, human epidermal
growth factor receptor; PR, progesterone receptor.

Hand and Craven [22] also observed phosphorylation of the
kinase Akt upon H2O2-induced death of MCF-7 cells; we
therefore assayed the degree of Akt phosphorylation in these
cells by Western blot. As expected, based on the work
reported by Hand and Craven [22], control MCF-7 cells or
cells stably expressing exogenous wild-type PGRMC1 exhibited an increase in Akt phosphorylation that correlated with
reduced viability after H2O2 exposure. However, the S56A/
S180A mutant that was able to survive peroxide treatment
Page 8 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

also did not exhibit marked phosphorylation of Akt (Figure 7).
In some experiments the Y179F/S180A mutant also exhibited
partially reduced levels of Akt phosphorylation (data not
shown). Taken together, these data are consistent with differences in the phosphorylation status of PGRMC1 observed in
breast cancers, potentially being able to influence the clinically
relevant survival phenotype of those cancers. However, further
experiments will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis and
to elucidate the mechanisms involved.

PGRMC1 location in tumors
We generated a new specific monoclonal antibody (5G7)
against the cytoplasmic domain of PGRMC1 lacking the
amino-terminal first 46 amino acids. This antibody recognized
endogenous PGRMC1 in breast cancer tissues (Figure 8).
The PGRMC1 signal (red in Figure 8) could effectively be
abrogated by competitive pre-incubation of the antibody with
recombinant PGRMC1 protein (Figure 8a). Co-incubation of
anti-ER-α antibody (green signal) and anti-PGRMC1 antibody
(red) revealed that these proteins were predominantly
expressed in different cells, even in ER-α-positive tumors.
Remarkably, very few individual cells were observed that
exhibited abundant levels of both ER-α and PGRMC1 (yellow
in Figure 8b). In ductal in situ breast cancers of comedo-type,
PGRMC1 was present in cells surrounding the necrotic centre
of the tumor, whereas ER-α was expressed in cells more distal
to the necrotic centre (Figure 8c, i to 8c, v). The green fluorescence in the comedo necrotic zone was due to autofluorescence of necrotic cellular material (Figure 8c, iv). The cells
expressing PGRMC1 were presumably in the hypoxic zone,
and so we performed co-immunofluorescence labeling with
5G7 anti-PGRMC1 and anti-GLUT-1, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 inducible marker for hypoxic cells [33]. Although
not all PGRMC1-expressing cells expressed GLUT-1, the vast
majority of GLUT-1-positive cells co-expressed PGRMC1.
Where PGRMC1 and GLUT-1 proteins were expressed in the
same cells, PGRMC1 exhibited a perinuclear location that
contrasted markedly with the cytoplasmic membrane localization of GLUT-1 (Figure 8c, vi to 8c, vii). This result provides
confirmation of the cellular location of PGRMC1 that was
observed for over-expressed HA-tagged PGRMC1/Hpr6 [22].

reaction, after which the entire open reading frame of product plasmids was confirmed correct by DNA sequencing. Individual codon mutations were
encoded by the following sequences: serine-56 to alanine (S56A) AGC → GCC; cysteine-128 to serine (C128S) TGC → AGC; tyrosine-138 to
phenylalanine (Y138F) TAC → TTC; tyrosine-179 to phenylalanine (Y179F) TAC → TTC; and serine-180 to alanine (S180A) TCA → GCA. Amino

the same sequence with initiator methionine included, in which mutated human PGRMC1 amino acids would be numbered as S57, C129, Y139,
Y180, and S181. The position of three tandem influenza virus hemaglutinin epitope sequences (HA) is indicated at the carboxyl-terminus of the open

Discussion
Validation of the differential abundance profile
Despite the small number of well characterized tumors
employed in this analysis, the sample size is sufficient to detect
marked and consistent differences between the test classes
with reliable significance. A discussion of the protein abundance profile obtained is provided in Additional file 1. Taken
together, these results suggest that our comparison of just
eight patients from each group of ER-α-positive or ER-α-negative tumors (Table 1 and Figure 3) has provided useful results
that grossly reflect the known differences in biology between
these cell types. Therefore, previously unreported protein differences were of extreme interest.
PGRMC1 and cancer implications
We demonstrate a higher abundance of hypophosphorylated
PGRMC1 isoforms in the specific subpopulation of clinically
relevant ER-α-negative cancers. Further studies in a larger
patient collective will be necessary to correlate specific
PGRMC1 isoforms with other tumor markers in addition to ERα.

Page 10 of 16

We identified three two-dimensional spots corresponding to
PGRMC1 (Additional data file 1 [Table S1] and Figure 3), two
of which were significantly more abundant in ER-α-negative
tumors (spots 1–22 and 1–23 in Figure 3). Phosphatase treatment of primary breast cancer proteins demonstrated that
these different isoforms of PGRMC1 differed at least partly in
their phosphorylation status (Figure 4).
PGRMC1 was previously reported to be more abundant in a
variety of cancers, including breast cancer (although differential ER-α status was not reported), and a perinuclear localization was suggested to implicate it in a role involving
cytochrome P450 activation and steroid metabolism [34]. The
differential abundance of PGRMC1 protein between breast
cancers of different ER-α status is notable because we previously identified the distantly related cytochrome b5-domain
feudesin/SPUF protein and cytochrome b5 itself to have been
slightly yet significantly differentially abundant between breast
tumors that were all positive for the ER-α but which differed in
the expression level of the cytoplasmic progesterone receptor
[19]. Indeed, cytochrome b5 was also marginally yet signifi-

cell extracts of the indicated cells. Antibodies employed were specific for phosphorylated Akt (top panel); for the polypeptide backbone of Akt, actin;
or for the HA-tag on the respective exogenously expressed PGRMC1 constructs, as indicated. Incubation with the respective antibodies was perfomed simultaneously for the lower panel. Previous experiments indicated no overlap of signal (data not shown). Akt is phosphorylated upon H2O2
exposure in susceptible MCF-7 cells stably transfected with wild-type PGRMC1 and the mutants indicated. In peroxide-resistant cells expressing the
S56A/S180A mutant, Akt phosphorylation is always abrogated. In some experiments in which the Y179F/S180A mutant exhibited limited survival to
peroxide (for example, Figure 6b this was also accompanied by lack of Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). These trends were also observed at a
concentration of 100 μmol/l H2O2 with lower overall viability levels (data not shown). PGMRC, progesterone receptor membrane component; HA,

cantly more abundant in the ER-α-positive tumors in our
present study (1.2-fold [P = 0.03]; spot 1–32 in Figure 3).
Hughes and colleagues [35] recently reported that PGRMC1
and a fungal homolog are present in evolutionarily conserved
protein complexes with respective members of the cytochrome P450 class of enzymes, including the Cyp51A1 protein, which is involved in the production of cholesterol from
lanosterol. Furthermore, they demonstrated that reduction in
the level of PGRMC1 mRNA and protein produced an elevation in lanosterol levels. A variety of experiments suggest a role
of cholesterol in the biology of PGRMC1, as reviewed by
Cahill [20]. The rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway leading to cholesterol synthesis is hydroxymethylglutarate-coenzyme A reductase, and this enzyme is both regulated
by cholesterol levels [36,37] and is diagnostic of a recently
identified class of poor prognosis apocrine breast cancers that
were both ER-α and progesterone receptor negative [38].
The results presented in Figure 8 indicate that PGRMC1 is
abundantly expressed in a population of ER-α-negative and
GLUT-1-positive cells in the hypoxic zone surrounding
necrotic tumor tissue. GLUT-1 is a membrane glucose transporter that is important in the enhanced rates of anaerobic
metabolism of tumors, known as the Warburg effect [33].
Intriguingly, because not all PGRMC1-positive cells
expressed GLUT-1 (Figure 8, vi), the population of PGRMC1expressing cells may have given rise to those expressing
GLUT-1, suggesting avenues for future experimentation.

The GLUT-1 and HIF-1 positive cells occupying the hypoxic
tumor microenvironment adjacent to necrotic zones are resilient to chemotherapy and frequently give rise to metastases.
Although a literature search revealed no directly reported
association between the mevalonate pathway and hypoxia, the
Wilm's tumor suppressor protein WT1 is thought to suppress
growth by downregulating the mevalonate pathway [39], and
the hypoxic expression of WT1 is regulated by HIF-1 [40].
Hypoxic conditions have been shown to promote phenotypic
de-differentiation in ductal breast carcinoma in situ. In mammary ductal in situ breast cancer of comedo-type, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells surrounding the central necrosis
exhibited high HIF-1α protein levels, down-regulated ER-α,
and increased expression of the epithelial breast stem cell
marker CK-19 [41]. These cells lost their polarization and
acquired an increased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, which are hallmarks of poor architectural and cellular differentiation. CK-19
is one marker for a cell population that contains mammary
multipotent progenitor cells [42]. Therefore, hypoxia might
induce dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, thereby promoting
an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. The hypoxiainduced downregulation of ER-α expression in DCIS has
potential clinical relevance and suggests a reason that some
ER-α-positive tumors become resistant to anti-estrogen treatment. Because PGRMC1 is upregulated in the cells close to
the necrotic area, it conceivably plays a role in this
phenomenon.

Additional data file 1.

HIF-1 also induces the angiogenic growth factor vascular
endothelial growth factor [33]. Swiatek-De Lange and colleagues [43] implicated PGRMC1 in the activation of vascular
endothelial growth factor gene expression in retinal glial cells.
Interestingly, PGRMC1 (AI010357 EST [VEMA] ventral midline antigen) was observed to be one of a number of genes
upregulated in the late phase of a wound healing model involving injured spinal cord [26], at a time when vascular morphogenesis occurs in the healing tissue.

endogenous levels increased susceptibility to peroxideinduced death [22] (Figure 7). It is possible that the failure of
the S56A/S180A mutant to be phosphorylated on those residues leads to accumulation of some biologically active species that is/are perhaps inappropriately cleared. For instance,
sterol levels regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of
both Insig-1 and hydroxymethylglutarate-coenzyme A reductase to downregulate the mevalonate pathway [44,45], and
PGRMC1 interacts directly with Insig-1 [32].

PGRMC1 protein affects the response to oxidative damage in
the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, influencing their susceptibility to oxidative cell death [22]. It is unclear whether this reflects
a normal function of PGRMC1 or is a function of the conditions of over-expression. However, under these conditions,
some of our phosphorylation site PGRMC1 mutants exhibited
enhanced survival (Figure 6). Both survival and failure to
induce Akt phosphorylation were associated with somewhat
higher levels of the exogenous S56A/S180A mutant
PGRMC1 protein detected by Western blot (Figure 7), but our
data do not demonstrate that this higher level is reproducible,
and similar levels of the other mutants did not protect against
cell death, suggesting that elevated exogenous PGRMC1 protein abundance levels per se were not responsible for
enhanced survival of MCF-7 cells expressing the S56A/
S180A mutant. Indeed, over-expression of PGRMC1 above

The possible mechanism of survival of the S56A/S180 mutant
deserves some consideration. Phosphorylation of S56 presumably blocks the interaction of PGRMC1 with another protein(s) through the predicted proline-rich SH3 target domain
centered on P62, whereas phosphorylation of S181 presumably blocks phosphorylation of the adjacent Y179, which
would be necessary for interaction with one or more presumed
SH2-domain proteins [20]. Phosphorylation of Y179 probably
requires the prior regulatory dephosphorylation of S180.
C128 was essential for the vital function of the S56A/S180
mutant, and it is quite possible that dimerization via a cystinemediated disulfide bond [20] is required for the rescuing function. Mutation of cysteine to serine is unlikely to have greatly
affected protein structure. Furthermore, the inability of phosphorylated Y179 to interact with one or more unidentified SH2
domain-containing proteins may be responsible for the sus-

Candidate PGRMC1-interacting proteins
It is reasonable to speculate that differences in the phosphorylation status of PGRMC1 can affect the proteins with which
it interacts, and thereby affect cellular biology. The possible
breast cancer relevance of known or suspected interactions of
PGRMC1 with PAIRBP1/CGI-55, neogenin and DCC
(deleted in colon cancer) are considered in the supplementary
discussion included in Additional file 1. Future research should
address what role, if any, these proposed interactions of
PGRMC1 with those candidate interaction partners may play
in breast cancer.

Conclusions
Taken together, this emerging picture strongly suggests that
PGRMC1 is potentially able to impinge upon the regulation of
cell biology that is centrally important for the clinical consequences of tumors, potentially maintaining not only cell migration and tissue morphogenesis but also tissue homeostasis.
There are therefore a variety of theoretically possible mechanisms whereby differential PGRMC1 abundance and phosphorylation could affect tumor biology, perhaps with a central
nexus functionality (Figure 9). This work suggests directions
for further experiments that will be necessary to address the
explicit role(s) of PGRMC1 in cancer.
We detected an expected wound response signature in ER-αneg tumors that was associated for the first time with differential abundance, and phosphorylation of PGRMC1 between different tumor types. Furthermore, our data suggest that the
phosphorylation status of PGRMC1 can affect cell survival in
response to life-threatening conditions. Determination of the
thus far poorly defined role of PGRMC1 in cancer biology
could prove to be of great relevance to clinical cancer therapists. Indeed, relevance to a broad range of tissues and
pathologies is quite probable.
