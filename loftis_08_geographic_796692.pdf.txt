Abstract
Background: A novel Ehrlichia, closely related to Ehrlichia ruminantium, was recently discovered
from Panola Mountain State Park, GA, USA. We conducted a study to determine if this agent was
recently introduced into the United States.
Methods: We developed a sensitive PCR assay based on the conserved gltA (citrate synthase)
gene and tested DNA samples extracted from 1964 field-collected and 1835 human-biting
Amblyomma americanum from 23 eastern states of the USA.
Results: The novel agent was detected in 36 ticks collected from 10 states between 1998 and
2006. Infected ticks were collected both from vegetation (n = 14, 0.7%) and from humans (n = 22,
1.2%). Fragments of the conserved gltA gene and the variable map1 gene were sequenced from
positive samples. Two distinct clades, with 10.5% nucleic acid divergence over the 730 bp map1
sequence, were identified.
Conclusion: These data suggest that the Panola Mountain Ehrlichia was not recently introduced
to the United States; this agent has an extensive distribution throughout the range of its tick vector,
has been present in some locations for several years, and displays genetic variability. Furthermore,
people in several states were exposed to this agent through the bite of infected ticks, underscoring
the potential public health risk of this emerging ehrlichiosis.

Background
A novel Ehrlichia transmitted by Amblyomma americanum
(lone star ticks) was recently discovered in Panola Mountain State Park, Georgia, USA. The "Panola Mountain Ehrlichia" (PME), which is closely related to E. ruminantium,
caused transient febrile illness, followed by chronic latent
infection, in a goat [1]. This agent was also associated,
using PCR and sequencing, with a case of human illness
following a bite from a nymphal Amblyomma acquired at
Panola Mountain State Park [2]. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus) are a probable vertebrate reservoir for
PME in the United States; deer are susceptible to infection,
are naturally exposed to the agent, and are competent reservoirs for tick transmission of this agent [3].
Ehrlichia ruminantium is endemic in southern Africa and
the Caribbean, and its pathogenicity in cattle, sheep, and
goats varies from mild febrile illness to fatal heartwater [47]. Several species of Amblyomma vector E. ruminantium in
Africa and A. variegatum is the vector in the Caribbean [4].
This exotic disease has not been detected in the United
States, but it could be introduced into the country by the
importation of animals and tick vectors from endemic
areas [8,9]. White-tailed deer are also susceptible to infection with E. ruminantium [10], and could provide a sylvatic reservoir for E. ruminantium in the United States.
Thus, the Ehrlichia discovered at Panola Mountain State
Park could be a divergent strain of E. ruminantium that was
recently introduced to this country. This park is located
within the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area and is less
than twenty miles from the Hartsfield International Airport, a port of entry for imported animals and animal
products.
To evaluate the geographic distribution and public health
risk posed by this emerging agent, we developed a sensitive nested PCR assay based on the gltA (citrate synthase)
gene, which is conserved within species of Ehrlichia [11],
and screened DNA extracts from A. americanum collected
from vegetation and submitted through four different
human-biting tick surveillance programs. All PCR amplicons were confirmed by sequencing the gltA fragment, and
the genetic diversity of this novel agent was evaluated by
amplification and sequencing of the variable Major Antigenic Protein 1 gene (map1) [12].

Methods
Collection of ticks
Ticks were collected in the years 1998–2006. Questing
ticks were collected by flagging vegetation or by using carbon dioxide baited traps, as described by Fleetwood et al.
[13]. Ticks removed from humans were collected through
surveillance programs established by the Georgia Division
of Public Health, Ohio Department of Health, University
of North Texas Health Science Center, and U.S. Army

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/54

Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine.
Ticks were voluntarily submitted by individuals who
reported the location in which they believed the tick was
acquired. All ticks were identified to species and life stage,
and gender of adult ticks was recorded. DNA was extracted
from individual questing adult ticks as previously
described [1,14]. For human-biting tick collections, DNA
was extracted from individual nymphal and adult ticks, or
from pools of ticks collected from a single person, using
previously described methods [15].
PCR detection of PME
A nested PCR assay for the Panola Mountain Ehrlichia was
designed based on the published gltA sequence (GenBank:DQ363995). Nested PCR primers were designed
using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and GCG Seqlab (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), and evaluated for specificity using a panel of DNA from A. americanum known to be PCR-positive for the agent and
negative DNA samples extracted from colony-reared ticks.
Sensitivity was determined using a cloned plasmid containing the gltA gene from the Ehrlichia sp. Reaction conditions were optimized to ensure a sensitivity of at least 10
gene copies. The outer PCR reaction included 5.0 μL of
Taq Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 500 nM each of
primers Ehr3CS-185F (5'-GCC ACC GCA GAT AGT TAG
GGA) and Ehr3CS-777R (5'-TTC GTG CTC GTG GAT CAT
AGT TTT), and 1.0–2.0 μL of DNA in a 10 μL final reaction
volume. The volume of DNA used in each reaction was
based upon the elution volume of DNA; 1.0 μL was used
for DNA samples in a final volume of 50–100 μL, and 2.0
μL were used for samples extracted in a volume of 200 μL.
The thermocycler program was as follows: 95°C for 3
min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 60 sec, with a final extension at 72°C
for 5 min. The inner PCR reaction included 10.0 μL of Taq
Master Mix, 500 nM each of primers Ehr3CS-214F (5'-TGT
CAT TTC CAC AGC ATT CTC ATC) and Ehr3CS-619R (5'TGA GCT GGT CCC CAC AAA GTT), and 1.5 μL of the primary reaction product in a 20 μL final reaction volume.
The thermocycler program was similar to the primary
reaction, but with a 60°C annealing temperature rather
than 55°C.

All PCR reactions were prepared in a dedicated hood
equipped with an ultraviolet light source. Positive (10
copy) and negative controls were included on every plate;
positive control material was handled only after all
unknown samples were loaded. Ticks that were identified
as positive using the gltA primer set were confirmed by
repeating the assay and by sequencing. Positive ticks were
tested using a PCR assay for map1, as previously described
[1,16], using the outer primer pair map1-forward/map1reverse and, if needed, paired heminested reactions with

Sequence analysis
All PCR amplicons obtained using the gltA assay and map1
assay were sequenced, with 2- to 4- fold coverage, using
PCR primers. When mixed sequences were obtained, PCR
amplicons were cloned using TOPO TA Cloning kits with
the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
sequencing was repeated using several clones. Fragments
were assembled using GCG Seqmerge (Accelrys), translated into the respective predicted amino acid sequences,
and aligned. All sequences were submitted to GenBank:
gltA, EU272374–EU272410 and map1, EU272339–
EU272373. Related sequences were identified using
BLAST (NCBI, Bethesda, MD). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the amino acid sequences of the map1
amplicons were performed using PAUP 4.0 Beta 10 (Sinauer Asosciates, Inc., Sunderland, MA). The most parsimonious trees were constructed using heuristic bootstrap
analysis (1000 replicates); starting trees were obtained by
stepwise addition with tree-bisection-reconnection as the
branch-swapping algorithm.

Results and Discussion
Amblyomma americanum were collected from 203 counties in 23 states, representing much of the geographic
range of this tick (Figure 1).
Questing ticks were collected from vegetation at 32 sites in
8 states. Of 1964 questing adult ticks, including 867 adult
males and 1097 adult females, 14 ticks (10 males, 1.15%,
and 4 females, 0.36%) were positive for PME (Table 1).
The overall prevalence of infection in questing ticks was
0.71%, and the prevalence of infection in sites with
infected ticks ranged from 1.32–2.88%.
Human-biting ticks were obtained, via surveillance programs, from 21 states. Of 1835 A. americanum obtained
from surveys of human-biting ticks, 22 DNA samples
from 5 states were positive (Table 2). Six of these positive
samples were pools of 2–9 ticks, with the remainder representing individual ticks. Given the low prevalence of
infection, we assumed that only one tick in a positive pool
was likely to be positive; the infection rate among humanbiting ticks was therefore 22/1835, or 1.20%. Eleven of
the positive samples were from nymphal ticks (1.12%),
three from males (0.71%), five from females (1.17%),
and five from pools containing more than one life stage.
Overall, 35 positive ticks were obtained from 18 counties
in ten states: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia (Figure 1). Four of these ticks were co-infected with
E. chaffeensis and/or E. ewingii (Table 3). None of the
positive ticks were co-infected with "Borrelia lonestari".
All of the positive ticks were collected between the
months of April and September. Positive ticks were identified from collections made in 1998 through 2006; on
Fire Island, in Suffolk Co., New York, individual positive
ticks were collected from vegetation in both 1998 and

a: When a pool of ticks (2–9 ticks each) was positive, the minimum infection rate (1 tick) is reported. The life stage of the infected tick could not be
determined for 3 pools that included more than one life stage.
b: Kentucky and Tennessee ticks were combined, since most of the ticks in this collection centered on the border between these two states.

2003, suggesting that the agent was maintained in this
area over several years. Similarly, positive human-biting
ticks in Burlington Co., New Jersey were collected in 2001
and 2006, and ticks collected from Scioto Co., Ohio in
2000 and 2001 were positive.
The nested gltA amplicon was sequenced from all positive
ticks. All positive amplicons had sequences consistent
with PME; E. chaffeensis or E. ewingii were not amplified.
The gltA sequence was highly conserved and was identical
to the reported PME sequence (GenBank: DQ363995) in
35/36 ticks; one sequence included a single nucleotide
polymorphism (EU272407).
A portion of map1 was successfully amplified and
sequenced from 31 of the 36 positive tick DNA samples;
the outer PCR amplicon, when available, produced 730
bp of sequence, and the inner amplicon produced 384 bp.
Two map1 genogroups were identified and were seen both
in questing ticks and in human-biting ticks (Table 3): one
group was 100% homologous to the sequence reported
from PME (GenBank:DQ324368), and the other group
was 89.5% similar to PME, with two polymorphic loci

identified within this group of sequences. There were five
base pair mismatches between the sequences in the latter
genogroup and the outer pair of PCR primers previously
developed for the detection of the map1 gene from this
agent (Pmap-38F/Pmap-581R, [1]). The two different
PME clades were not geographically isolated; both clades
were detected in ticks from Jones County, Georgia and
Monmouth County, New Jersey. Additionally, one pool of
ticks from Ocean County, New Jersey, contained both
genotypes. The amplicons produced from this mixed template pool were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis
indicated representatives of both genotypes were present,
as well as several sequences that appear to be combinations of these two genotypes and may indicate a crossover
event in map1 (GenBank: EU272356–EU272360).
Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the map1 amino
acid sequences were attempted (Figure 2) using all of the
DNA sequences that were 730 bp in length. The sequences
from the ticks formed two distinct clades, with 100%
bootstrap support for each clade (1000 psuedoreplicates),
and they formed a cluster within the larger taxonomic
group of E. ruminantium strains in 82% of the replicates.

a: Percent homology to the reference sequence for PME, GenBank: DQ324368
b: Only the internal, nested fragment was available for sequencing.
c: Age and gender not recorded.
d: The map1 PCR amplicon was a mixture of more than one sequence, and the product was cloned prior to sequencing.

The PME/E. ruminantium clade was a sister taxa to E. chaffeensis and E. canis in 100% of the replicates. Bootstrap
support for separation of PME and E. ruminantium into
separate taxa was weak (< 500/1000).

Conclusion
We detected the novel Panola Mountain Ehrlichia sp.
(PME), recently discovered in A. americanum from north
central Georgia, USA, in 36 ticks from 18 counties in ten
states. DNA from PME was detected in ticks from the tra-

ditional southeastern range of A. americanum as well as
from recently established populations in the northeastern
USA. The overall prevalence of infection with PME,
approximately 1–3%, was similar to that previously
reported from Panola Mountain [1]. Similar prevalences
of E. ewingii and E. ruminantium are seen in populations
of Amblyomma infected with these agents [14,17-19].
Earlier assays for PME were based on the gene encoding
the Major Antigenic Protein 1 (map1) [1]; this gene can be

The extensive geographic distribution of PME and the
presence of genetic variability within the species suggest
that this agent was not recently introduced to the United
States. A recent point source introduction should have
resulted in a limited geographic distribution of a single
genotype or possibly of closely related genotypes with
minimal divergence. Although two distinct genotypes of
PME were detected, less genetic diversity was seen than is
reported to occur between African strains of E. ruminantium, suggesting that the map1 gene of PME might evolve
more slowly than that of its African counterparts, that the
diversity of susceptible Amblyomma and vertebrate species
in Africa might have contributed to the diversity of E.
ruminantium on that continent, or that the introduction of
E. ruminantium-like bacteria to North America might have
been more recent than the introduction into Africa.

highly variable [12], and polymorphisms in the primer
annealing sites could prevent the detection of some genotypes of PME. We therefore developed a sensitive and specific nested PCR assay based on the conserved gltA gene.
As expected, gltA amplicons obtained from PME-infected
ticks were 99.5–100% identical to each other and to the
sequence previously reported from this agent. Significant
mismatches were seen between the previously reported
map1 primers and the map1 sequences from PME-infected
ticks. Additionally, map1 could not be amplified from all
of the gltA-positive ticks, presumably due to primer site
mismatches, confirming that detection of PME using
map1 assays is limited by the variability of this gene.
This gene is, however, a valuable tool to assess genetic variability in PME across the geographic range of A. americanum. Using phylogenetic reconstruction of map1
sequences, we identified two clades, one of which
includes the genotype previously reported from Panola
Mountain. Both PME clades were closely associated with
each other and were more closely related to E. ruminantium than to any other species of Ehrlichia, similar to previous reports. Sequences that suggest the possibility of
crossover between these two genotypes were also

Finally, the lack of reports of heartwater, or heartwaterlike disease, in ruminants, wild or domestic, from areas in
which PME was detected provides indirect support that
this agent has low pathogenicity for these animals. However, this emerging ehrlichiosis has been associated with a
human case of illness following the bite of a nymphal A.
americanum from Panola Mountain State Park. Amblyomma americanum is an abundant and aggressive humanbiting tick throughout its geographic range [20]. Our
detection of PME in 22 human-biting ticks underscores
the potential public health risk of this emerging tick-transmitted disease. The broad geographic range and patchy
distribution of ticks harboring PME suggests that human
cases could occur throughout the eastern United States
but be sporadic in nature and therefore difficult to diagnose. Sensitive and specific PCR assays, performed on
whole blood samples collected during the acute febrile
period, might assist in the rapid clinical diagnosis of
undifferentiated ehrlichial infections in people with a history of tick bite by A. americanum.
