Abstract
Background: Chlamydia pneumoniae causes human respiratory diseases and has recently been
associated with atherosclerosis. Analysis of the three recently published C. pneumoniae genomes
has led to the identification of a new gene family (the Cpn 1054 family) that consists of 11 predicted
genes and gene fragments. Each member encodes a polypeptide with a hydrophobic domain
characteristic of proteins localized to the inclusion membrane.
Results: Comparative analysis of this gene family within the published genome sequences provided
evidence that multiple levels of genetic variation are evident within this single collection of
paralogous genes. Frameshift mutations are found that result in both truncated gene products and
pseudogenes that vary among isolates. Several genes in this family contain polycytosine (polyC)
tracts either upstream or within the terminal 5' end of the predicted coding sequence. The length
of the polyC stretch varies between paralogous genes and within single genes in the three genomes.
Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from a collection of 12 C. pneumoniae clinical isolates was used
to determine the extent of the variation in the Cpn 1054 gene family.
Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that sequence variability is present both among strains
and within strains at several of the loci. In particular, changes in the length of the polyC tract
associated with the different Cpn 1054 gene family members are common within each tested C.
pneumoniae isolate. The variability identified within this newly described gene family may modulate
either phase or antigenic variation and subsequent physiologic diversity within a C. pneumoniae
population.

Background
Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects and causes disease in the respiratory tract
[1,2] and has recently been associated with heart disease
[3]. Approximately 10% of pneumoniae cases and 5% of
bronchitis and sinusitis cases in the U.S. are attributed to

C. pneumoniae infection. Pathogenic mechanisms utilized
by C. pneumoniae to replicate and disseminate within
hosts remain unclear.
Little is known about strain-specific determinants of C.
pneumoniae. Isolates of C. pneumoniae are virtually indisPage 1 of 11

tinguishable using 16s rRNA [4], restriction fragment
length polymorphism [5], and amplification fragment
length polymorphism analysis [6]. Unlike C. trachomatis,
only a single serotype or genotype of C. pneumoniae has
been identified by any of the above methods.
Recently, three genomes of C. pneumoniae have been completed and published. These include CWL029 http://
chlamydia-www.berkeley.edu:4231/[7], AR39 http://
www.tigr.org/[8], and J138 http://w3.grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp/
J138/[9]. Comparative analysis suggests that overall genomic organization and gene order in each C. pneumoniae
genome is highly conserved [8,9]. Given this conservation, the study of individual regions of sequence variation
will provide insight into strain-specific virulence, genetic
diversity, and adaptive responses within and among C.
pneumoniae populations.
Genomic analyses have recently revealed a large gene family of 21 polymorphic outer membrane proteins (Pmps)
with predicted outer membrane localization in C. pneumoniae [7,10,11]. The function of this gene family in chlamydial growth and development remains unknown. Several
studies have examined genetic variation and strain differentiation of Pmp proteins, which may be important for
genetic flexibility and adaptive response. Recently, it has
been reported that interstrain and intrastrain variation of
gene expression and protein productions of pmpG6 and
pmpG10 are modulated by deletion of tandem repeats in
pmpG6 [9,11] and variation in the length of polyguanosine tract in pmpG10 [12,13]. This evidence suggests that
variation may be an important requisite for the function
of this gene family in the biology of Chlamydiae.
Examination of the C. pneumoniae genome sequences by
Daugaard et al. [14] demonstrated that a unique and related family of genes is found within the C. pneumoniae genome, and that variation among strains leads to
differences within several members of the gene family.
Gene products of these paralogous genes contained a
unique bi-lobed hydrophobic domain, which is a predictive marker for localization to the inclusion membrane
[15]. In this study, we further characterize this family by
examining variation in sequence of the family members
both within and among different C. pneumoniae isolates.

Results
Bioinformatic analysis of the Cpn 1054 gene family
The Cpn 1054 gene family consists of 11 C. pneumoniaespecific genes or gene pairs: Cpn 07, 08/09, 010/010.1,
011/012, 041/042, 043/044, 045/046, 0124/0125,
0126,1054 and 1055/1056. Family members indicated
with slashes have deletions or internal shifts in reading
frame that interrupt otherwise related coding sequences
(Figure 1). The size of the paralogous repeat unit ranges

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/2/38

from approximately 1,500 bp (1055/1056) to approximately 2,800 bp (Cpn 007). Family members are located
in four separate regions on the chromosome including
contig 1.0–1.1 (Cpn 007–Cpn 011–012), contig 1.5–1.6
(Cpn 041–Cpn 046), contig 2.5 (Cpn 0124–126) and
contig 13.0–13.1 (Cpn 1054–Cpn 1056). The nucleotide
sequence identity of the Cpn 1054 gene family members
ranged between 20–99% (Figure 1, Table 1). Although in
some cases the overall sequence similarity among family
members is low, many share extensive regions of identity
at the predicted 5' end (Figure 2). This region of identity
includes a polyC tract within each paralogous locus. The
CWL029 genome sequence has predicted GTG codons as
a translational initiation site for several family members
(Cpn 08, 010, 041, 045 and 1055; Figure 2).
The conserved hydrophobic domain of the Cpn 1054 gene
family
In a previous study, we demonstrated that a bi-lobed (50–
60 amino acid) hydrophobic domain is a predictive marker for protein localization to the inclusion membrane (Inc
proteins; [15]). Consequently, 68 C. pneumoniae proteins,
including several members of the Cpn 1054 family (Figure 3), were identified as putative inclusion membraneassociated proteins. The nucleotide sequence found at the
5' end of each paralogous repeat unit represents the region
of highest identity among most family members (Figure
2). This includes the sequences that encode the major hydrophobic domain of each repeat unit (Figure 4A). In
some cases (Cpn 007, 124, 126) the hydrophobic domain
represents the primary reason the gene is included in the
Cpn1054 gene family (Figure 4A,4B; Figure 5). Three
nearly identical copies of this domain are found within
Cpn 007 (Figure 3), a protein that is otherwise not similar
to other family members.
Homopolymeric cytosine (poly C) tract and the variations
of the length of poly C tracts in the Cpn 1054 gene family
Genomic analysis of the Cpn 1054 gene family revealed a
repeat sequence of 6 to 15 homopolymeric cytosine residues, positioned either upstream or immediately within
the predicted 5' end of Cpn 008, 010, 041, 043, 045,
1054, and 1055 (Figure 2). Analysis of each sequenced genomes indicated that three Cpn 1054 gene family members had identical polyC tracts in each of the respective
genomes: Cpn 041 (CCCCCCTCCCC), Cpn 043 (12C),
and Cpn 045 (CCCCCC). In each of the other family
members however, the length of the polyC tract varies in
the published genomes. These analyses were expanded to
examine the polyC tracts in several clinical isolates. Sequence data collected directly from amplification products of several Cpn 1054 family members showed that
polymorphisms within the polyC tract were present in all
tested family members except Cpn 041 and Cpn 045 (not
shown). Therefore, the polyC tract in Cpn 041 and Cpn

Figure 1
A comparison of the paralogous genes of the Cpn 1054 gene family in Chlamydia pneumoniae CWL029. The 5' end of Cpn 1054
is similar to Cpn 008, 010, 011, 043,045, and 1055 while the 3' end was similar to the Cpn 009, 010.1, 012, 042, 044, 046, and
1056. The range of predicted amino acid similarity is 20–99%, as indicated by shading. Vertical bars indicate termination codons
that interrupt the reading frame. The position of the beginning of each family member in the CWL029 genome is indicated
above the sequence. All numbering is based on the CWL029 genome sequence [7].

045 appear to be conserved among isolates, a result consistent with the data in the genome sequences. In order to
examine the clonal variation within other Cpn 1054 family members, sequences surrounding the polyC tracts were
amplified from selected genes and the products cloned
into plasmids. The polyC tract was then examined
through nucleotide sequence analysis of a selection of independent plasmid constructs. Sequence variation within
the polyC tract was first examined for Cpn 043, Cpn 1054,
and Cpn 1055 of C. pneumoniae AR39. Sequence analysis
of independent recombinant plasmids showed variability
in the length of the polyC tract of each tested gene (Figure
6A). We next examined variation within a single gene,
Cpn 1055, using genomic DNAs from strains AR39, AR
458 and PS 32 as template. Variation in the length of

polyC was observed in this gene from each tested isolate
(Figure 6B).
Two approaches were used to demonstrate that the observed variation in length of the polyC tract was not a
function of PCR errors during the analysis. First, two different thermostable polymerases (Taq and Pwo polymerase) were used to generate the primary amplification
products for cloning and subsequent sequence analysis.
Amplifications with each enzyme resulted in clones with
variation in the length of the polyC tract (Figure 6C). A
second approach for examination of the possibility of
PCR errors was to reamplify the polyC tract from a single
plasmid template, and examine the sequence of the polyC
tract directly in these amplification products. No variation

Multiple sequence alignments of the 5' end and upstream regions of selected Cpn 1054 family members. Three genes have been
left out of this figure (Cpn 007, 124, 126) because they lack significant sequence identity at the 5' end. All data were obtained
from the CWL029 genome sequence [7]. The designation for each sequence includes the gene number of the 1054 family
member and the gene directly upstream. The position in the genomic contig is also indicated for each sequence. Where appropriate, the predicted stop codon of upstream genes (Cpn 009, 042, 044, 1054; red boxes) is indicated. Two regions encompassing candidate start codons for each gene are indicated with green boxes. In some cases this includes the codon GTG as a
candidate translational start site, as predicted through the Chlamydia Genome Website. PolyC tracts, boxed in blue, are
upstream of the predicted start site or are within the gene near the 5' end of coding region.

of the length of the polyC tract of Cpn 043, 1054, and
1055 was identified in these PCR products (not shown).
These results support the conclusion that the variability in
the length of the polyC tracts is not an artifact of the amplification process, and thus the observed variability reflects differences at these loci within individual isolates.
Allelic differences within Cpn 010–010.1
Analysis of published genomic sequence of several 1054
family members identified polymorphisms within several
genes. Two examples of these polymorphisms can be
found in Cpn 010/10.1 and Cpn 1054, family members
that are over 98% identical at the nucleotide level [14].
Analysis of the published genome sequences indicates

that these two genes likely duplicated through nonreciprocal exchanges or by gene conversion [16]. Comparative
analysis of the three genomes showed that the short sequence polymorphisms are present in Cpn 010/10.1, Cpn
043, and Cpn 1054 [14]. Cpn 10/10.1 and Cpn 1054 are
especially interesting, as the two genes differ by only a few
nucleotides over a 2,400 base pair coding sequence. The
primary differences between these genes are 1) a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that alters the reading
frame in 10/10.1 [14], and, 2) a region of diversity at the
3' end of each gene (Figure 7). Daugaard et al. [14] identified an RFLP marker that exploits the SNP, and other
candidate RFLPs can be identified in the 3' region of diversity (Figure 7). Short sequence polymorphisms were ex-

amined in Cpn 010/10.1 by PCR amplification and
nucleotide sequencing in 12 C. pneumoniae isolates. Variability at both polymorphisms was observed between
strains. The frameshift mutation leading to the truncated
sequence of Cpn 010 was identified in CWL029 and 4
other isolates: AR388, AR231, KA5C and KA66 (not
shown). The 3' polymorphism that distinguishes Cpn 10/
10.1 from Cpn 1054 was found within Cpn 10.1 in two
isolates: AR39 and AC43 (Figure 7). There was no apparent linkage between the central frameshift mutation and
the 3' polymorphism, as the two regions varied independent of one another. There was also no evidence that these
sequences vary within individual C. pneumoniae isolates.

Discussion
Relatively little is known about molecular pathogenesis,
genetic diversity and adaptive strategy of C. pneumoniae.
Although the genomic organization of these independent
strains is very similar (over 99.9% identical), there are regions of variation within each isolate [8]. In the present
study, we have identified a paralogous gene family within
C. pneumoniae, designated as the Cpn 1054 gene family.
This family consists of eleven paralogous loci, with single
repeat elements consisting of single ORFs or ORF pairs.
The identity of the predicted polypeptide sequences
shared among family members ranges from 20–99%. It is
likely that the diversity of these genes arose through gene

pneumoniae CWL029. Hydrophobic domains of Cpn186, 284, 285, 829, and 830 are included in this figure as outliers. The outliers represent candidate Inc proteins that contain a bilobed hydrophobic domain similar to that encoded by Cpn 1054 gene
family members, but that share no obvious amino acid similarity with family members. Multiple sequence alignments were performed and analyzed using CLUSTALW and PAUP* programs. Distance matrices were inferred by neighbor-joining to estimate
evolutionary distances. Bootstrap values (based on 1000 replicates) are represented at each node. Scale bar indicates 0.1

duplication and subsequent diversification. It appears
that certain duplications were relatively recent, as at least
two of the repeated loci- Cpn 010/10.1 and Cpn 1054- are
nearly identical. Analysis of the three genomes also demonstrates that apparent gene conversion has occurred between 10/10.1 and 1054 in strain AR39 [16], and that an
intact 1054 ORF is found within each sequenced genome
[14]. However, its location varies between the two loci.
The redundant nature of the Cpn 1054 family members is
somewhat unusual against the generally reductive evolutionary strategy of the chlamydiae [17]. There is no evidence that the Cpn 1054 gene family is found outside of

C. pneumoniae, and thus the members of the family may
be important in the unique biological traits of this species.
Gene duplication and subsequent genetic drift are the
likely means by which variation is manifested between
members of the Cpn 1054 gene family. Variation is also
observed within individual family members, both between strains [14] and, as shown in this report, within individual isolates. Several gene family members, including
Cpn 008, 010, 043, 1054, and 1055, contain homopolymeric cytosine repeats either upstream or at the predicted
5' end of the coding region. In C. pneumoniae, variation of
the short repeat of homopolymeric nucleotides was first

identified in the pmp family. Comparative genomic analysis and cloning expression showed that the length of the
polyG tract of pmpG 10 varies between strains and within
an isolate [12,13]. Furthermore, variation of the length of
polyG has been demonstrated that it plays a role in the
differential expression of PmpG 10 [12]. Variability in
short nucleotide repeats generated via slipped strand mispairing are key elements in the generation of phenotypic
diversity within many pathogenic microorganisms [18].
Further investigation will be required to determine if the
expression of members of the Cpn 1054 gene family is affected by the observed variability in length of the polyC
tract.
Although the proteins in the Cpn 1054 gene family are
classified as candidate inclusion membrane proteins [15],
their subcellular locations and role in infection and disease remain to be identified. It is also not yet known
whether the Cpn 1054 gene family is expressed individually or coordinately, or to what extent each gene is expressed during the course of an infection. However, the
variation, both within and between strains, is a potential
requisite for this gene family that may contribute to the
unique biology of C. pneumoniae.

Conclusions
The C. pneumoniae genome contains a gene family (the
Cpn 1054 gene family) consisting of 18 different genes in
11 paralogous loci. Variation is observed both within and
among isolates. This variation may be useful for the biotyping of C. pneumoniae clinical isolates, and may be important in phenotypic diversity within the species.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and C. pneumoniae genomes
All experiments were conducted using a collection of independent clinical isolates from a strain library (Table 1).
Genomic DNA of C. pneumoniae was isolated from purified EBs using the methods of Campbell et al. [19]. Extracted DNA was stored at -20C. Genomics analyses were
conducted using sequences from the genome websites
listed in the introduction. Open reading frames, nucleotide positions and contig numbering were annotated
based upon the C. pneumoniae CWL029 genome [7].
Bioinformatics analysis of the Cpn 1054 gene family of C.
pneumoniae genomes
DNA and polypeptide sequences were aligned using
CLUSTALW analysis (Mac Vector™ 6.0; Oxford Molecular,
Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Madison, WI). Each gene

sequence ends at the termination codon for the indicated gene. For reference purposes, the A at the start of each sequence
represents position 1254 of Cpn10.1 and position 2310 of Cpn 1054 within the CWLO29 sequence accessible through the
Chlamydia Genome Website [7]. Candidate restriction enzyme sites that may be used for RFLP analysis are indicated.

and each predicted gene product was also subjected to gap
BLASTX and BLASTN respectively http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/[20]. The similarity between two
different DNA sequences was determined using the BLAST
2 sequence program from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast/bl2seq/bl2.html[21]. Hydrophilicity profiles of the
gene product of each Cpn 1054 family member was determined using hydropathy plot analysis ([22] MacVector™).
Phylogenic analyses of both DNA and amino acid sequences were performed using PAUP* [23]. In this study
Cpn 0186 (IncA), and four additional candidate inclusion
membrane proteins, Cpn 0284, Cpn 0285, Cpn 0829 and
Cpn 0830, were selected as members of an outgroup for
analysis. Phylogenic trees were inferred by neighbor-joining to estimate evolutionary distances. Bootstrap values
were obtained from a consensus of 100 neighbor-joining
trees.

DNA amplification, and sequence analysis of the CP1054
gene family
Purified genomic DNA of selected isolates (Table 1) were
amplified using specific oligonucleotide primers flanking
the DNA region of interest (Table 2). The amplification
products were purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification
spin column kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). Purified PCR
products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) through the Oregon State University Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology.
Examination of variation within isolates through cloning of
PCR products
The variation of the length of the polyC tract within Cpn
043, 1054 and 1055 was determined through sequence
analysis of purified amplification products and through
sequencing of amplification products following cloning
into plasmids. Both Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison,
WI) and Pwo polymerase (Roche Diagnostic Corporation,
Indianapolis, IN) were used in these studies. Amplifica-

using the Zeroblunt system, while products generated
with Taq were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Both cloning systems were used according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA of 8–10 different positive recombinant clones was isolated and sequenced. Variations of the length of the polyC tract of
