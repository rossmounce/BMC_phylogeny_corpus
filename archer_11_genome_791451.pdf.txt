Abstract
Background: Escherichia coli is a model prokaryote, an important pathogen, and a key organism for industrial
biotechnology. E. coli W (ATCC 9637), one of four strains designated as safe for laboratory purposes, has not been
sequenced. E. coli W is a fast-growing strain and is the only safe strain that can utilize sucrose as a carbon source.
Lifecycle analysis has demonstrated that sucrose from sugarcane is a preferred carbon source for industrial bioprocesses.
Results: We have sequenced and annotated the genome of E. coli W. The chromosome is 4,900,968 bp and
encodes 4,764 ORFs. Two plasmids, pRK1 (102,536 bp) and pRK2 (5,360 bp), are also present. W has unique features
relative to other sequenced laboratory strains (K-12, B and Crooks): it has a larger genome and belongs to
phylogroup B1 rather than A. W also grows on a much broader range of carbon sources than does K-12. A
genome-scale reconstruction was developed and validated in order to interrogate metabolic properties.
Conclusions: The genome of W is more similar to commensal and pathogenic B1 strains than phylogroup A
strains, and therefore has greater utility for comparative analyses with these strains. W should therefore be the
strain of choice, or ‘type strain’ for group B1 comparative analyses. The genome annotation and tools created here
are expected to allow further utilization and development of E. coli W as an industrial organism for sucrose-based
bioprocesses. Refinements in our E. coli metabolic reconstruction allow it to more accurately define E. coli
metabolism relative to previous models.

Background
Escherichia coli is a model prokaryotic organism, an
important pathogen and commensal, and a popular host
for biotechnological applications. Among thousands of
isolates, only four strains (the common laboratory strains
K-12, B, C, and W) and their derivatives are designated
as Risk Group 1 organisms in biological safety guidelines
[1,2]. A fifth strain, E. coli Crooks (ATCC 8739), has also
been used extensively in laboratories for over 70 years
[3-5]; more recently, it has been used as a host for industrial biochemical production [6-8]. There have been no
reported cases of the strain being pathogenic, suggesting
that it is generally safe. When it was sequenced in 2007,
ATCC 8739 was designated as a C strain [6], however, it

is in fact a Crooks strain [4] and recent publications have
reflected this correction [9,10]. Of these five safe strains,
K-12 [11], B [12] and Crooks [GenBank:CP000946] have
been sequenced, but C and W have not.
E. coli W (ATCC 9637) was originally isolated from
the soil of a cemetery near Rutgers University around
1943 by Selman A. Waksman, around the same time he
and Alan Schatz discovered streptomycin (Eliora Ron,
personal communication). Waksman coined the term
‘antibiotic’, and his discovery of streptomycin (and many
other antibiotics) led to him being awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1952. The strain was
termed “Waksman’s strain” or “W strain” because it
showed the highest sensitivity to streptomycin compared
to other isolated E. coli strains in Waksman’s collection
(Eliora Ron, personal communication).
The first reported use of W was as the standard E. coli
strain in the assay for sensitivity to streptomycin and other
antibiotics [13]. Bernard Davis, a prominent microbiologist

from Harvard Medical School, developed a large auxotrophic mutant library from the strain [14] using his penicillin-based selection technique [15]. One of these
mutants, vitamin B-12 auxotroph 113-3 (ATCC 11105), is
well known as a production strain for penicillin G acyclase
(PGA) [16] and for studies of aromatic compound degradation in bacteria [17]. It has also recently been discovered
that the popular ethanol-producing strain KO11 [18] is a
W strain rather than a B strain as previously thought [19].
Both W and KO11 have been engineered for the production of several chemicals, including ethanol [18,20,21],
poly-3-hydroxybutyrate[22], lactic acid [23] and alanine
[19]. The W strain has several properties that make it a
preferred strain for industrial applications. It produces low
amounts of acetate even without tight sugar control, and
can be grown to high cell density during fed-batch culture
with relative ease [22]. It also has good tolerance for environmental stresses such as high ethanol concentrations,
acidic conditions, high temperatures and osmotic stress
[24,25]. It is a very fast growing strain; its superior growth
rate on LB medium compared to classical K-12-derived
strains has led to it being developed as a lab cl!oning strain
[27]. These combined characteristics make W extremely
attractive as a production strain. Significantly, W is the
only safe E. coli strain which can utilize sucrose as a carbon source, and it grows as fast on sucrose as it does on
glucose [22,27,28]. Sucrose is emerging as a preferred carbon source for industrial fermentation: life cycle analysis
demonstrates that sucrose from sugarcane has a superior
performance when compared to glucose from starch [29].
Modern development of good production strains entails
application of metabolic engineering principles. Increasingly, metabolic engineering relies on a systems biology
approach [30]; a key aspect of this approach is the integration of a metabolic model (genome-scale model, GEM).
The first step in developing a GEM is to build an in silico
genome-scale reconstruction (GSR) derived from the
organism’s genome sequence. In this paper, we present
the complete genome sequence, detailed annotation of E.
coli W. Comparative genome analyses were performed
among safe E. coli strains and group B1 commensal/pathogenic E. coli strains. In addition, a comprehensive, Wspecific GSR was developed to underpin construction of a
GEM for engineering industrial production strains.

Results and Discussion
Annotation and comparative analysis with other safe
laboratory strains

A combination of Roche/454 pyrosequencing, fosmid
end sequencing and Sanger sequencing was used to
obtain the complete genome sequence of E. coli W
(ATCC 9637). The W genome consists of a circular
chromosome [Genbank: CP002185] (Figure 1) and two
plasmids, pRK1 [Genbank: CP002186] and pRK2

Page 2 of 20

[Genbank: CP002187]. Detailed results of genome analysis can be found in Table 1. At 4,901 Kbp, the chromosome of E. coli W is the largest of all the sequenced safe
laboratory strains. Comparison with available E. coli
genome sequences in GenBank demonstrated that it is
similar in size to the commensal E. coli strain SE11
(4,888 Kbp) [31], but smaller than most sequenced
pathogenic strains. A total of 4,764 chromosomal genes
(including 82 non-coding RNA genes) were predicted
using Prodigal [32] and Glimmer[33]; these genes cover
89% of the chromosome.
A wide variety of algorithms were used to predict and
annotate coding and non-coding genes (see Methods).
Like the three other sequenced laboratory strains, W has
22 rRNA genes expressed from 7 rRNA operons; these
operons are present at similar locations in all four genomes. The four strains share 85 tRNAs and there are four
unshared tRNAs located in large mobile elements. W has
thrX and tyrX, which occur within a variable region of the
Rac*W prophage and are homologous to thrU and tyrU of
E. coli K-12; due to separate IS-mediated deletions, W and
B are both missing a tRNA which occurs upstream of ypjC
in K-12; in K-12, ileY is present. In Crooks the sequence of
a tRNA in the same location is identical to ileY of K-12
but has been mis-annotated as a tRNA-Met2 variant.
All-against-all BLASTP comparison of chromosomal
protein-coding orthologs among the four safe laboratory
strains (Figure 2, Additional File 1) showed that of 4,482
predicted CDSs in W, 3,490 are shared among these four
strains. Another 413 are found in at least one other
strain, leaving 523 CDSs that are unique to W. Consistent with the larger genome size, this is ~320-360 more
CDSs than were found to be unique in any other safe
strain. It should be noted that the number of shared
orthologs between strains is not an indicator of overall
relatedness, since increases in shared genes tends to arise
from large insertion elements (for example, K-12 and B
share a large genomic island encoding a restriction modification system while Crooks and W share two large gene
clusters encoding excretion systems). Furthermore, differences in genome sizes bias this kind of relationship
comparison.
E. coli strains can be divided into five different ECOR
phylogroups (A, B1, B2, D and E) based on the sequences
of housekeeping genes [34]. Commensal strains are
found primarily in group A or group B1, which are sister
groups, while pathogenic strains are generally found in
Group B2, D and E [31,34,35]. A phylogenetic tree was
constructed by sequence concatenation of seven housekeeping genes [36] (Figure 3). Using this approach,
W was assigned to group B1. Group B1 contains a large
number of commensal strains [37]. The other three
sequenced safe strains (K-12, B and Crooks), are all
members of phylogroup A [31,35]. Interestingly, these

groupings are consistent with genome sizes of sequenced
strains: group B1 strains have larger genomes than group
A strains. W is arguably a more appropriate strain than
K-12, B or Crooks for comparison with commensal and
pathogenic strains of phylogroup B1.
Plasmids

An early report suggested that E. coli W contains three
plasmids [38]. However, it was later suggested that W
contains only two plasmids [26]. Our sequence data confirmed the latter report: W contains two plasmids, pRK1

and pRK2. pRK1 is a circular plasmid of 102,536 bp.
It encodes 118 genes: 114 protein coding genes, one
pseudogene and three ncRNAs (Table 1). BLAST analysis
demonstrated that it belongs to Incompatibility Group I1
(IncI1) and has high structural similarity with the IncI
plasmids pR64 (a reference IncI1 plasmid), pSE11-1
(a plasmid of roughly 100 Kbp isolated from E. coli
SE11), and pColIb-P9. Analysis of inc, a marker for IncI
designations [39], showed that inc in pRK1 differed by
only one base pair from the reference inc of Inc I1 subgroup Ig [40]. IncI1 plasmids are characterized by the

ssrS is annotated as an rRNA in Crooks but in K-12 and W it is annotated as an ncRNA. It is included in this table as an ncRNA.
The total number of genes, tRNA, other ncRNAs and IS elements in each strain includes pseudogenes/pseudo-tRNAs etc.; the number of pseudo-elements in each case
is in noted in brackets. A ‘+’ means the element is present; a ‘-’ means the element is absent. ND = not determined in annotation. Safe laboratory strains: W (ATCC 9637)
and its plasmids pRK1 and pRK2; K-12 (MG1655); B (REL606); and Crooks (ATCC 8739). W is in phylogroup B1; K-12, B and Crooks are in phylogroup A.

presence of genes encoding a thick pilus, a thin type IVB
pilus, the pilus-associated protein gene pilV, and the
DNA primase gene sog [41].
Genes for antibiotic resistance are found on most
sequenced IncI plasmids, including IncI1 plasmids [42]
and IncIg-type R621a [43]; however, pRK1 does not
encode any antibiotic resistance genes. This is desirable
in industrial strains as genetic manipulation for strain
improvement often involves the use of antibiotic selection. In addition, an IS91 insertion has interrupted two
genes involved in colicin production (cib and imm).
This insertion also resulted in the introduction of genes
involved in -type fimbriae (see further comments
below).
The trbA-exc region in IncI1 plasmids is a diverse
region and includes genes that are involved in plasmid
maintenance and transfer. pRK1 contains a complete trb
regulon, which is required for plasmid transfer. Two
other genes are of interest: excAB, which controls surface exclusion and thus determines which plasmid types
can conjugate into the host cell, and pndCA, which controls plasmid stability [44]. In pRK1, pndCA has been
lost, suggesting that plasmid stability might be affected
even though there is no direct evidence that pRK1 is
unstable in W. In addition, the 3’ region of exc differs
greatly from other exc genes on IncI1 plasmids, suggesting that this gene encodes a protein which determines
different mating specificity than other IncI plasmids.

Plasmid pRK2 has been sequenced previously [45] and
our analysis is in agreement with the reported information. Briefly, pRK2 is a cryptic ColE1-type plasmid; it is
5,360 bp and encodes 16 predicted genes including 15
protein-coding genes and one non-coding RNA. It is
stably inherited and contains four putative mobilisation
genes and a gene encoding a Rom protein. It shares 99%
identity with pSE11-4, a plasmid isolated from the group
B1 commensal E. coli SE11 [31].
Finally, there is some evidence that E. coli W once harbored a third plasmid. An IS91 insertion in pRK1 (see
below for further details) is homologous to a region in
pSE11-3, an IncF plasmid from E. coli SE11 [31]. The
insertion has deleted a region of pRK1 which is normally
found in IncI plasmids. Additionally, the partial fimbrial
gene cluster which was transferred with the insertion is
known to be plasmid-encoded [46]. W and SE11 belong to
the same phylogroup and therefore might share a common ancestry; furthermore, two of the SE11 plasmids are
highly similar to pRK1 and pRK2 (pSE11-1 and pSE11-4,
respectively). Thus, it seems likely that an ancestral W
strain might have harbored a plasmid similar to pSE11-3.
Mobility elements and defence systems

E. coli genomes consist of a conserved core interspersed
with variable regions encoding accessory functions [47].
The conserved core is shared with closely related genera
such as Citrobacter [48], Shigella [49] and Salmonella

Figure 2 Comparison of orthologous CDSs between W, K-12, B and Crooks strains. The number of shared genes, as well and the number
of unique genes and genes shared between one, two, and three strains are shown. All-against-All BLASTP for amino acids (E-value ≤ 1E-5,
identity ≥ 90%, coverage ≥ 80%) was used to assign orthologs. Total CDS counts for K-12, B & Crooks differ by 8, 14 & 5 respectively as some
CDSs had more than one ortholog in another genome (Additional File 1).

[50]. The accessory genome encodes lifestyle-specific
functions which are often found in large clusters or
related genes (so called ‘genomic islands’) [51-53]. These
clusters contain a different G+C content compared to
the rest of the genome (see Figure 1) and are acquired
through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via natural
transformation, bacteriophage-mediated transduction or
conjugation.
Mobility elements

Large genomic islands which are flanked by mobility elements are known as large mobile elements (LMEs), and
include prophages or phage-like elements (pLEs) [54].
Differentiation between prophages and pLEs can be difficult; in general, a prophage will contain specific metabolic and structural genes associated with a prophage,
while a pLE will contain an integrase and very few
regions which are homologous to known prophages.
LMEs carry large complements of genes which might
confer a variety of metabolic attributes. E. coli W has six

prophages and three pLEs, the latter of which we have
designated ‘E. coli W phage Like Elements’ (WpLEs).
A detailed list of LMEs in E. coli W and other safe strains
can be found in Table 2.
A total of twenty-eight LMEs are annotated amongst
the safe E. coli strains. They are spread out over nineteen
different sites in the chromosome and all but one can be
classified as either a pLE or one of three different prophages (P2-like, P4-like or l-like). The exception is the
Mu prophage, a transpositional phage that inserts into
almost random chromosomal locations [55]; among the
four strains, Mu prophage is only found in W. None of
the LMEs in W encode any genes of particular note. In
the other strains, a few genes of interest are encoded on
prophages. Rybb*B carries retron Ec86 [6], which
encodes a reverse transcriptase that is missing from
Rybb*C and Rybb*W. The P4 prophage CP4-44 is absent
in W and Crooks but present in K-12; the flu gene is
encoded on this prophage in K-12 and is encoded on

Phev*B in B. The l prophage is the most promiscuous
prophage element among the four strains.
Ten pLEs are found among safe strains. Only KpLE2
is shared (being found in both K-12 and B). E. coli
Crooks might have harboured KpLE2: it contains a 259
bp pseudogene, the first 137 bp of which shares 72%
identity with the P4-integrases of KpLE2 in K-12 and B.
KpLE2 contains the fec regulon (discussed below) and
the sgc operon, which is involved in pentose and pentitol sugar breakdown [56]. K-12 contains KpLE1, which
includes the gtrAB regulon encoding a bactoprenol glucosyl-transferase involved in O-antigen modification.
The Crooks strain harbours CpLE1, which contains an
endonuclease, and CpLE3 which also contains a fec regulon. The WpLE3 of W appears to comprise two separate pLEs, as a second P4-integrase is found with
distinct regions of DNA following each integrase. The
first region contains a toxin-antitoxin system while the
second region contains a putative 5-methylcytosine
restriction system.
Insertion sequences (ISs) play an important role in the
cell’s ability to evolve and adapt to new environments
[57]. A complete description of the IS elements in safe
strains can be found in Table 3. Only two ISs are conserved among all four strains; as previously reported
[58], no copies of IS1 were found within the W genome.
The W genome contains 24 IS elements, which is significantly fewer than K-12, B or Crooks; as a consequence,
W has no IS-related gene inactivation occurring in the
chromosome, whereas K-12 and B both have a number
of genes inactivated. These include genes involved in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and capsular polysaccharide
(CPS) synthesis, as well as large deletions such as the
41 Kbp region between uvrY and hchA in B which
removes the Flag-1 flagella-encoding gene cluster (see
below for further details).

35469) was used as an out-group. The tree shows bootstrap values
(percentage per 1000 replicates). The scale bar represents
divergence time.

Restriction modification and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems play
an important role in antiviral defence against invasive
foreign genetic material (e.g., bacteriophages and integrative elements) and hence control the extent of HGT
[59]. Restriction capabilities are conferred by the immigration control region [60]. Both W and Crooks are
restriction minus as they lack hsdMRS, mcrBC and mrr,
which encode the restriction modification complexes. In
W, this cluster has been replaced by the pac gene
encoding a penicillin G acyclase (PGA), which catalyses
the breakdown of penicillin G into phenylacetic acid
and 6-aminopenicillanic acid [17]. This capability has
been exploited for the industrial production of PGA
using E. coli W [16]. In Crooks, the immigration control
region has undergone multiple changes due to IS element insertions. The lack of restriction modification

systems in W and Crooks suggests that these strains are
less able to inactivate foreign DNA.
CRISPR systems inhibit horizontal gene transfer. The
detailed mechanisms have just begun to be exposed
[61]. Recently, two CRISPR systems have been described
in E. coli: CRISPR2 and CRISPR4 [62]. These systems
differ by the presence or absence of CRISPR associated
sequence (CAS) proteins (the function of which is
unknown), and by the location, number and sequence of
repeats. E. coli W contains three CRISPR2 arrays,
CRISPR2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (Table 4). Genes encoding E.
coli Cas proteins are present next to CRISPR2.1. W also
contains the CRISPR4.1-2 array but not the associated
Yersinia pestis Cas proteins, which are found in many E.
coli strains [62]. Each safe strain has the same number
of arrays, but the sequences and number of repeat
regions varies (Table 4). There are two cas gene clusters
found in E. coli which vary in the cas3-cse3 region; it is
unclear if they have the same function [63]. One is
found in K-12 and Crooks and the other is found in W
and O157. Multiple insertions and deletions have
destroyed the cas gene cluster in E. coli B.
Virulence/Fitness Factors

Virulence factors are classically considered to be associated with host interactions and pathogenicity. However, it should be noted that many of these so-called

virulence factors can also be considered fitness factors
in a non-virulence context [64]. For example, adhesins
are important for colonizing all manner of niches; colonisation does not necessarily lead to infection and
disease.
Serotypic antigens

E. coli serotypes are defined according to the polysaccharide component of LPS molecules [65-67]. These
include CPSs, which can be either K-antigen or colonic
acid (M-antigen) and O-polysaccharides (O-antigen).
The H-antigen is used for serotyping, and its type is
usually determined by FliC, a flagellar structural protein
[68]. HGT of the gene regions responsible for production of O-antigen, K-antigen, H-antigen, and the LPS
core has lead to a high degree of variability [69]. There
are 167 different O-antigen types and 80 K-antigen
types currently recorded amongst E. coli. Whereas other
safe E. coli strains have accumulated IS-mediated deletions in antigenic clusters (Table 1), W has intact
clusters. It has an R1 type LPS core and an O6 type
O-antigen. Type O6 is widely distributed and found
both in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains and in
commensal strains [70]. W does not produce a K-antigen, but it has the gene cluster involved in colonic acid
synthesis; colonic acid resembles K-antigen group IA
capsular polysaccharides [66]. It also has the phosphorelay regulon (encoded by rcsA and rcsDBC) which

activates production of colonic acid. FliC homology suggests that E. coli W produces an H49 type H-antigen
[71]. W can thus be antigenically characterised as E. coli
W (O6:K-:H49) CA+.
Adhesins

Fimbriae and other adhesins determine whether E. coli
can bind to and colonise specific environments, including different types of cells. They are associated with
virulence in pathogenic strains of E. coli such as enteroaggregative E. coli 55989 (EAEC) [72] but are also key
to the fitness of probiotic E. coli strains such as strain

Nissle 1917, as they allow it to colonize the human
intestine [73]. In W, there are thirteen chromosomal
gene clusters involved in fimbrial biosynthesis, and most
of these are conserved among the safe strains of E. coli
(Table 5). Differences arise in genes encoding the fimbrial usher protein and the tip adhesins. Tip adhesins
are important determinants of host cell specificity during pathogenesis; the usher protein is a membrane protein which is involved in the assembly of a fimbria and
determines which group the fimbria belongs to [74].
There are 2 a-type fimbrial gene clusters in W:
ecpABC-yagW-ecpE, and a novel fimbrial gene cluster
found between exuT and exuR. We have designated this
novel cluster E. coli a-type fimbria, eafABCD. However,
neither of the clusters in W contains a gene encoding for
the tip adhesin protein, which is found in other a-type
fimbrial clusters and is responsible for cell binding [75].
Thus, it is unlikely that the W a-type fimbriae can function in pathogenesis or colonisation of cells in general.
W contains five g1-type fimbrial gene clusters. One of
these is E. coli YcbQ laminin-binding fimbria (ELF, formerly ycbQRST) [76] which is shared between group B1
strains. In W, the major subunit protein ElfA is relatively
different (84% identity) from that found in K-12 and
O157:H7 EDL933. Deletion of this gene in O157:H7
EDL933 has been shown to lead to a significant reduction
in ability to adhere to HEK293 cells [76]. A g1-type cluster found in E. coli O157:H7 and annotated as ECs2113ECs2107, is also present in W. This cluster is also present
in E. coli K-12 (annotated as ydeQRST), but a deletion
removes ECs2113-ECs2112 and truncates ECs2111
(which normally encodes the usher protein). We have
designated this gene cluster E. coli g-type 1, with the
operon consequently designated egoABCDEF. Information on the other three g1-type fimbrial gene clusters is
limited but all are found in K-12 and are cryptic or
poorly expressed under classic laboratory conditions [77].
Two groups of fimbriae closely related to g1-type fimbriae and known as long polar fimbriae [78] are also
found in E. coli W. They are commonly found in both
pathogenic and commensal strains of E. coli and consist
of 3-6 genes. The first cluster, lpfA1-E1, is found in
other E. coli group B1 strains (Table 5) and shows
44-77% amino acid identity to the lpf gene cluster of
Salmonella enterica. The adherence of lpfA1-E1 homologs in other E. coli strains is known to vary depending
on both the sequence of the gene cluster and on its regulation [78-80]. The second cluster, lpfA2-D2, is identical to the lpf operon found in E. coli 789. This lpf
operon has been shown to produce the fimbria responsible for adherence to human HEK293 cells [81].
There are also three π-type fimbrial gene clusters in
W and the other safe strains. One of these, located
between sixA-yfcN and consisting of seven genes, shows

Crooks contains a related g4 fimbrial found in E. coli O157:H7 at this location.

Cluster location in E. coli K-12 MG1655.
d
Cluster located on W pRK1.
A ‘+’means the element is present; a ‘-’ means the element is absent. Where some genes from the cluster are deleted, this is noted as e.g. egoABC. If a different
gene fimbria gene cluster is present in the insertion site, the alternative gene cluster is noted. Safe laboratory strains are W (ATCC 9637), K-12 (MG1655),
B (REL606), and Crooks (ATCC 8739). W is in phylogroup B1; K-12, B, and Crooks are in phylogroup A.

>95% sequence identity with a fimbrial gene cluster
located in the same chromosomal position in O157:H7.
In O157:H7, this cluster is annotated as ECs3222ECs3216; we have designated it E. coli π-type one, with
the operon consequently designated epoA-H.
Due to an insertion event on pRK1, W has five of the
eight genes from the -type csh fimbrial gene cluster.
However, the lack of the terminal three genes most
likely renders this cluster non-functional.
Antigen-43 is a protein which works synergistically
with fimbriae to promote adhesion [82]. It is encoded
by the flu gene on the prophage CP4-44 [77], which is
present in E. coli K-12 and B, but is absent in W; consequently, antigen-43 is also absent in W.
Pili are involved in gene transfer and thus in obtaining
pathogenicity factors and other elements. They also
affect biofilm formation, which is an important consideration for industrial fermentation. Plasmid pRK1 contains the 14-gene pil cluster which encodes a type IVB
thin pilus involved in liquid mating [83]. In contrast to
R64 and ColIb-P9, pRK1 does not contain the recombinase gene rci or repeat-flanked shufflon regions that
increase the host adhesion variability of the thin pilus
[84]. In addition, there are mutations in pilS and pilU,
which encode essential functions for pilus activity. The

resulting PilS protein has three amino acid mutations at
positions where mutations have been shown to limit or
inactivate pilus function [85]. PilU has three amino acid
mutations at positions which severely affect transfer frequency [86]. Furthermore, the PilS and PilU proteins
have an additional 33 and 12 amino acid changes,
respectively, at positions which have not been previously
characterised. Additionally, E. coli C producing the
PilVA-type thin pilus forms cell aggregates in liquid culture due to the pilus activity [87], whereas E. coli W
does not (data not shown). All of these considerations
suggest that E. coli W does not form thin pili.
Plasmid pRK1 also contains a set of transfer genes,
comprising 29 genes over 3 operons, which encode a
thick pilus involved in both surface and liquid mating
[88]. The pRK1 complement includes all but one of the
tra genes: the traABCD operon is incomplete as it is
missing traD, a non-essential thick pilus protein of
unknown function [89].
Secretion Systems

Secretion systems are required for the transport of proteins across the cell membrane and play a role in virulence [90] and fitness [91]. The conservation of core
genes between flagellar systems and Type III secretion
systems has led some authors to recognise the flagellar

Archer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/9

export mechanism as a type of secretion system [92].
Consequently, there are seven secretion systems in
E. coli [90].
Flagella are required for cellular propulsion. There are
two flagella systems in E. coli [93]. In addition to the
well known Flag-1 flagellar cluster common in E. coli,
W has a Flag-2 gene cluster. The Flag-2 locus has been
found in many genera of gammaproteobacteria, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus [94], Escherichia coli [93],
Yersinia enterolitica [95], Citrobacter rodentium [48]
and Aeromonas hydrophila [96]. The V. parahaemolyticus and A. hydrophilia Flag-2 systems have been shown
to be active experimentally [94,96]. In E. coli, it is found
in some strains but not others; it was originally assigned
in E. coli 042 by homology [93] but has never been
shown experimentally to be functional. In E. coli 042,
lfgC (flgC in other genera), which encodes a rod protein
required for protein export through the outer membrane, has a frameshift mutation, suggesting that the
Flag-2 system is not functional. In support of this, a
swarming motility assay was negative [97]. E. coli W and
Crooks both contain a Flag-2 locus. The lfgC genes are
not mutated, but a two-gene toxin/anti-toxin system
found in 042 between lafW and lafZ is absent. Both
strains are missing motY, which encodes a motor protein essential for swarming in V. parahaemolyticus; in
addition, they do not contain maf-5, a modification
accessory factor essential for a functional lateral flagellar
in A. hydrophilia [96]. W (but no!t Crooks) contains a
Mu prophage located in a non-coding region of the
Flag-2 locus (between EcolC_3376 and EcolC_3377).
Together, these observations suggest that the Flag-2
locus is not functional in E. coli W or in Crooks. In
K-12 and B, all that is left of the Flag-2 system are the
two terminal remnants, fhiA (lfhA pseudogene) and
mbhA (lafU pseudogene) [93].
A swarming motility assay was performed to examine
functionality of the Flag-2 locus (Figure 4). Consistent
with loss of the Flag-2 locus, E. coli B does not swarm.
However, despite the loss of what appear to be essential
Flag-2 genes, W and Cooks strains both swarm. Although
the swarming assay has been used to assess Flag-2 activity
[93,96], it should be stressed that the test is not specific to
Flag-2. E. coli K-12, which has clearly lost the Flag-2 locus,
shows very limited swarming; however a K-12 mutant
(RP437) exhibits a swarming phenotype even though it
does not contain a Flag-2 locus [98]. Further analysis by
specific deletion will be required to determine whether or
not the Flag-2 locus is active in W.
There are two Type II secretion systems (T2SSs) in
E. coli. T2SSs are required for toxin export from cells
[99] as well as a variety of other proteins which affect
fitness for specific environments [64]. E. coli K-12, B,
and Crooks all carry a repressed 14-gene T2SS gene

Figure 4 Swarming motility assay. A swarming motility assay was
performed using E. coli strains W, Crooks, K-12 (MG1655), K-12
(RP437), and B. B was negative; K-12 (MG1655) showed very minimal
swarming, while K-12 (RP437), Crooks and W were positive. Assays

cluster (gspA-O, located between rpsJ and bfr) [100].
This T2SS has been lost in W due to a gspO-rpsJ deletion. Both W and B (but not K-12 or Crooks) carry the
second T2SS gene cluster (yghJ-pppA-yghG-gspC-M).
Unlike E. coli B, in which gspL is truncated, all genes in
W appear functional. However, it should be noted that
unlike K-12, which can export chitinase through an
expressed T2SS [100], the W genome does not contain
any known genes encoding enzymes or toxins that can
be exported through T2SSs.
Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) inject effector proteins into recipient cells leading to pathogenic or prosurvival responses [101]. There are two T3SSs in E. coli:
the E. coli Type III secretion systems 1 and 2 (ETT1
and 2) [102]. ETT1 is absent in all four sequenced
laboratory strains. Remnants of the ETT2 locus can be
found in all of them, but they do not have a functional
ETT2. Mutational attrition of ETT2 is common in
E. coli strains [103].
Type VI secretion system (T6SS) gene clusters consist
of 15 to 25 genes and have been identified in numerous
Gram-negative Proteobacteria [104]. In some T6SSs, the
genes encoding the secreted proteins, Vgr and Hcp, are
found in different locations of the genome [105], but
commonly next to rhs genes [106]. This is the case in W,
which contains two T6SSs. The structure of the first gene
cluster is homologous to the system previously described

Archer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/9

in E. coli O157:H7 Sakai [107]. It consists of 17 genes and
is termed the ‘enterohaemorrhagic E. coli type six secretion system cluster’ (EHS) [48]. However, this system is
found in numerous other non-pathogenic strains, including SE11 and HS (data not shown). A second T6SS is
located downstream of metV and is homologous to the
T6SS found in E. coli CFT073 [108], also located downstream of metV. We have designated this cluster Escherichia coli type six secretion system cluster 2 (ETSS2) as
the EHS is cluster 1. In W, it is most likely deactivated
due to an IS621-mediated insertion. W is the only safe
strain which contains a T6SS, although none of the effector molecules which are transported into host cells [104]
are present. Therefore, this system is unlikely to function
in pathogenicity.
Rearrangement hot spot (Rhs) elements

Rhs elements are large highly repetitive regions; they
constitute roughly 1% of the E. coli genome [109]. They
are composed of four elements: a clade-specific N-terminal domain, a core domain, a hyperconserved domain,
and a variable C-terminal domain [106]. Often, partial
core domain and variable C-termini regions (called
C-terminal tips) are observed downstream of intact rhs
genes. These are proposed to play a role in intra-rhs
variability [106]. C-terminal tips have occasionally been
annotated as insertion sequences in the ISFinder database due to the presence of an H-repeat (H-rpt),
although transposition activity has not been observed
[110]. E. coli W contains seven rhs genes (rhs1-rhs7;
Table 6), two of which are deactivated due to frameshift mutations. Of the remaining five, four have downstream C-terminal tips of varying number. Both Crooks
and W also possess type IV Rhs elements; these are
missing in K-12 and B.

Comparison with other group B1 strains

We performed a comparison between W and other
sequenced group B1 strains, including the commensal
strains SE11 and IAI1, and a variety of pathogenic
strains: EAEC strain 55989, ETEC strain E24377A, and
EHEC strains O26, O103, and O111 (Table 7). The
chromosome size is relatively variable, ranging from
4.7 Mbp (IAI1) to 5.7 Mbp (O26). A backbone genome
can be defined for each strain by subtracting the LMEs
(including plasmids and integrative elements) from the
total genome size (Table 7). Interestingly, the size of
this backbone genome is very similar (ca. 4.5 Mbp +/83 Kbp) for all strains. The backbone sequences are not
identical; differences are found primarily in the presence
or absence of large structural elements encoding secretion systems (including flagella) and adhesins. For example, the Flag-2 is found W and the two EHEC strains
O26 and O111 (but not in the EHEC strain O103 or in
other pathogenic strains, or in the commensal strains)
(Table 8). W has the largest backbone genome (4.588
Mbp) as it has the largest number of large structural
elements (T2SS, T3SS, T6SS and flagella). No group B1
strain contained the T2SS gspA-gspO which is present in
group A. E. coli. W contains the smallest number of
insertion sequences of all B1 strains; these sequences
also play a role in attrition, since recombination between
them may result in loss of large regions of DNA [111].
Additionally, each of the group B1 strains examined
contains the csc regulon for permease-mediated sucrose
utilisation.
A key observation arising from the Group B1 comparison is that most virulence factors are found in LMEs
outside the backbone genome (Additional File 2, Additional File 3, Additional File 4). For example, in the
EHEC strains, the LEE is encoded on an LME, while
shiga toxins are encoded on lambdoid phages; and in
E24377A, the enterotoxin and CS3 fimbriae are encoded
on plasmid pE24377A_79; and in 55989, the aggregative
adhesion fimbrial operon is also plasmid-borne. While
each strain had a number of lambdoid prophages present in its genome, only EHEC strains contained lambdoid prophages which encode the T3SS effectors which
enhance virulence in these strains (Additional File 4).
The presence of essential virulence factors on LMEs is
consistent with previous findings, which have shown
that non-pathogenic strains can be made pathogenic by
introduction of elements found on LMEs [72,112]. Fitness factors related to colonisation of ecological niches
not related to pathogenicity can also be found encoded
on LMEs.

redox balance requirements of cells under various genotypic and environmental conditions. These considerations allow prediction of growth rates and other
characteristics such as organic acid production under
specific conditions of interest. GSMs allow one to examine the effect of network alterations by performing
in silico gene knock-out and gain-of-function experiments prior to labour-intensive and expensive wet-lab

reconstruct the metabolic network using the annotated
genome (genome-scale reconstruction, GSR).
Numerous metabolic differences were observed
between E. coli W and the other safe E. coli strains. In
order to capture these differences, a GSR was constructed
for E. coli W. Protein-coding genes from W were compared with those annotated in the E. coli K-12 MG1655
model, iAF1260 [115] using AUTOGRAPH [116]. Additional reactions were added or removed based on analyses of growth phenotypes, in silico simulations, and
bibliomics (in-depth literature search). The resulting W
model, iCA1273, includes 1,273 genes represented by
1,111 metabolites and 2,477 reactions (Additional File 5,
Additional File 6). Relative to the K-12 model, iCA1273
is missing 41 genes that were not present in the W genome (Additional File 7). Conversely, iCA1273 contains 61
new genes, including 28 found in K-12 which had not
previously been annotated (Additional File 8). Forty-eight
genes found in the K-12 model, representing 155 reactions, were not included in iCA1273 as no functional
orthologs were present in the W genome. In terms of
modelling biomass formation, the most important difference between the two models was found in the production of membrane components. Fourteen genes involved
in LPS synthesis in K-12 were not found in W and twelve
LPS genes found in W were not found in K-12. Several
genes common to both strains but not previously represented in the K-12 model were found. These included
seven genes involved in the modification of LPS, specifically the inner core consisting of Kdo2-lipid A; two genes
involved in the transport of peptidoglycan from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space; and twelve genes
involved the phenylacetic acid degradation pathway.
Seven genes in the K-12 model were located on phage

Archer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/9

regions, whereas no genes encoding metabolic reactions
relevant to the mod!el werefound in phage regions in the
W genome. The localisation of gene-protein-reaction
information was also refined relative to the K-12 model.
Carbon and nitrogen source utilization were investigated
using Biolog™ phenotype arrays (Additional File 9) in
order to characterise the metabolism of the strain and
further refine the GSR. All of these refinements allow
improved resolution of pathways involved in metabolism
in our model. Comparative analyses between K-12 and
W were made both at genome and phenome levels
[115,117] (Additional File 10). In addition, comparative
studies were done between all four safe strains where
appropriate. Key differences are detailed below.
Carbon and nitrogen source utilization

Sugars are ubiquitous throughout the environment and
their breakdown supplies a key source of carbon and
energy for bacteria. Sucrose is the main carbohydrate
transport molecule in plants, and is therefore the most
abundant disaccharide encountered in most environments. A key metabolic difference between E. coli W
and the other three safe strains is the ability of E. coli
W to grow on sucrose. This is due to the presence of
the csc regulon, which was originally described in E. coli
EC3132 and encodes a regulator (cscR), a sucrose transporter (cscB), an invertase (cscA) and a fructokinase
(cscK) [118]. The csc regulon has been inserted between
the highly variable argW gene region and the dsdX gene
of the D-serine regulon [119,120]. Due to the insertion
in dsdX, a D-serine transporter, E. coli W has lost the
ability to utilize D-serine.
Several operons have been identified in E. coli strains
for uptake and metabolism of cellobiose, a glucose disaccharide formed by hydrolysis of cellulose. The four
safe strains contain only the six gene bgl regulon for cellobiose metabolism. This operon has been reported to
be silenced in wild-type E. coli strains [121] and K-12 is
unable to grow on cellobiose [122]. In contrast, W displays weak growth on cellobiose, indicating that the bgl
genes are not silenced. Uptake of the b-glycosides salicin
and arbutin is generally seen in conjunction with cellobiose uptake [122], though E. coli W exhibited growth
only on salicin. The absence of the arbutin transporter
gene arbT [122] is the most likely explanation for lack
of growth on arbutin.
The pentose monosaccharide D-ribose is a key component of DNA and RNA; D-allose is a ribose analog.
Ribose can be transported into the cell [123] and enter
amino acid and pentose phosphate pathways after it is
phosphorylated; allose can be converted to fructose-6phosphate [124] for entry into central carbon metabolism. The D-allose transporter can also transport
D-ribose [125]. In contrast to the other safe strains, W
is unable to catabolise ribose or allose; this is explained

Page 13 of 20

by the absence of the rbsDACBKR [123,124] and alsBACEK [125] regulons in W.
Many environmental applications require industrial
strains to break down aromatic compounds, which are
typically found in soil and water. This capability varies
between safe strains. W is able to break down the widest
range of aromatic compounds among four strains [17].
Unlike the other strains, K-12 is unable to break down
3- and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids as it does not contain the eleven-gene hpa gene cluster [17].
Both K-12 and W can break down phenylacetic acid
due to the presence of paa gene cluster. E. coli B has
lost this cluster due to an IS3-mediated insertion while
Crooks has an intact paa gene cluster and can presumably also break down phenylacetic acid. E. coli W was
isolated from soil, which may help explain its capability
to break down diverse aromatic compounds. In addition,
loss of extraneous carbon source genes can be observed
in strains maintained for long periods on laboratory carbon sources [127]. Since W was archived shortly after
isolation, it is less likely to have undergone this selective
pressure.
D-Galactosamine is a constituent of animal glycoprotein hormones while N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (NAG) is
a core component of peptidoglycan. Both are important
nitrogen sources. W shares with B and Crooks the agaVI gene cluster, which is involved in D-galactosamine and
NAG catabolism [128,129]. This cluster has been partially lost in K-12 due to deletion of agaEF.
In K-12, two separate base pair insertions in ilvG
result in valine sensitivity [130]. When K-12 is grown
with valine as a nitrogen source, valine accumulation
results in positive inhibition of the branched chain
amino acid synthesis pathway and a subsequent deficit
of isoleucine and leucine. IlvG is intact in W, B and
Crooks; consequently, these strains are likely to have
high L-valine tolerance.
There are a number of discrepancies between model
predictions and phenotype array data (Additional File 10).
In some cases, C and N sources which can be used by W
and K-12 according to the phenotype array data are not
supported by model predictions. This can be explained by
insufficient annotation of metabolic pathways for many of
these C and N sources. In other cases, the models predict
utilization of C and N sources which do not support
growth (or support only poor growth) in phenotype arrays;
in these cases, it is likely that specific conditions (e.g. anaerobic growth, requirement for cofactors) are not met in
the phenotype assay.
Other metabolic considerations

Inorganic ions such as iron and cobalt play important
roles in many biological processes, and there are many
uptake systems available for different ionic forms.
W differs from other safe strains in two ion transport

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/9

systems. Firstly, it does not contain the seven-gene
tonB-dependant diferric dicitrate uptake system, fecIRABCDE. In K-12 and B, this gene cluster is located
within the phage-like element KpLE2. Secondly, it has a
cobalt transport system, cbiQ-O2, located in the region
epd-yggC; this transport system is not present in the
other three strains.

Conclusions
E. coli W has been used in research laboratories and for
industrial applications for almost seventy years. Because
of this long history, the strain is considered a ‘safe’
laboratory strain. The safety of a strain is an important
consideration both for laboratory research and for
industrial applications. Containment and handling in
both environments is less complex for safe strains, and
safety requirements can significantly impact on the economics of production. Like other safe strains, W harbors
genes which encode pathogenicity determinants. W has
more such genes than other safe strains; however, many
have been mutationally inactivated or are missing key
components required for pathogenicity. These observations confirm the historical attribution of W as a safe
strain.
Amongst the four safe laboratory strains, W has several unique features: it belongs to phylogroup B1 rather
than A; it has a larger genome size; and the period of
time between isolation and strain archiving was relatively short. The two latter features are probably related:
strains that are maintained under laboratory conditions
for extended time periods are subject to specific selection pressures, and tend to lose genes which are not
required for survival under laboratory conditions [127].
In line with this, and consistent with its larger genome
size, the W genome encodes more genes than other safe
strains. Additionally, it has fewer ISs, which tend to
multiply in genomes of organisms maintained under
laboratory conditions [131]. Overall, W is more similar
to other pathogenic and commensal strains than it is to
the other safe laboratory strains. Furthermore, it has the
largest backbone sequence of the Group B1 strains, suggesting that it has the most complete complement of
ancestral genes. These considerations place W as the
preferred laboratory strain for use in genomic comparisons aimed at investigating genes involved in pathogenicity and commensalism.
Like other wild-type isolates [132], W encodes a large
number of carbon source utilization genes, and it grows
on a much broader range of carbon substrates than
K-12 strains (Additional File 9). Of particular interest is
the ability of W to utilize sucrose as a carbon source.
For industrial production applications, in particular for
large-scale production of commodity biochemicals (e.g.,
biofuels, industrial polymers, and other industrial

Page 14 of 20

feedstocks), sucrose from sugarcane is the preferred
carbon source [29]. It is abundant, it is cheaper than
glucose [133] and it is also ‘greener’ than glucose; for
example, greenhouse gas emissions for ethanol production are reduced by 85% relative to petrochemicals
when using sugarcane sucrose as a carbon source,
whereas use of glucose from corn reduces emissions by
only 30% [133]. The growth of W on sucrose, in combination with its many other desirable industrial traits
(fast growth rate, growth to high cell densities, lack of
adhesins which result in clumping, lack of antibiotic
markers, and relative resistance to environmental stresses) also place E. coli W as a preferred strain for industrial biotechnology applications. Some of these
characteristics (e.g. sucrose utilisation and lack of adhesins/antibiotic markers) are easily explained by genome
analysis. However, the raw sequence data does not shed
any light on why W exhibits the other characteristics.
Further experimental analysis using a systems biology
approach might shed light on this.
An annotated genome sequence is an important step
in characterisation of an organism, and allows construction of genome scale models which can be used to (a)
interrogate the metabolic attributes of organisms and
(b) facilitate strain development for industrial applications. Our W GSR includes a number of genes which
were not annotated in the original K-12 GEM; this
includes both genes that are unique to W and genes
that were omitted from the K-12 model. Our improved
model more accurately reflects the metabolism of an
E. coli cell. There is good agreement between genome
data, phenome data, and model data; the combination of
these allows us to define the metabolic capabilities of
E. coli W both in vitro and in silico. The W strain exhibits many industrially desirable traits, including fast
growth, stress tolerance, growth to high cell densities,
and the ability to utilise sucrose efficiently [22,24-28].
With the availability of an annotated genome and GSR,
the W strain can now be used as a platform organism
for developing sucrose-based bioprocesses to replace
current unsustainably-produced industrial chemicals.

Methods
Sequencing and assembly

E. coli W (ATCC 9637) was obtained from NCIMB Ltd
(Aberdeen, Scotland; Accession Number 8666. The
NCIMB stock was supplied by ATCC). Roche/454 pyrosequencing and fosmid end sequencing followed by manual
gap-filling were used to construct the E. coli W genome.
The shotgun reads in SFF files that were produced from
GS 20 (707,210 reads, 81.8 Mb; MWG Biotech, Germany)
and GS FLX (236,190 reads, 56.5 Mb; National Instrument
Center for Environmental Management, Korea), totalling
ca. 27.7× genome coverage, were assembled into 209

Archer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/9

contigs by Roche’s gsAssembler. CONSED [134] was used
for sequence manipulation that included read/contig editing, primer design, and finish read processing. Specifically,
127 large contigs with accompanying quality scores produced by the gsAssembler were imported into CONSED
as single-read contigs. 2,479 paired-end reads of pCC1FOS
(EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, United States) off from ABI
3700 (1.98 Mb, ca. 9.9× clone coverage; GenoTech Co.,
Korea) were then aligned on the contigs and the resulting
scaffolds were validated using the mate information
derived from the fosmid end reads.
The remaining sequence gaps were filled by Sanger
sequencing of the gap-spanning PCR products or fosmid
clones. Repeat-induced over-collapsed short contigs
were resolved by reproducing contigs according to the
copy number deduced from the read depth of contigs
and by ordering them using ‘from/to’ information given
by the gsAssembler. The most difficult assembly was
with two highly similar copies of P2-like prophages
(31,005 bp and 32,732 bp); each was reconstructed into
the relevant sequences after disentangling the overcollapsed contigs. Ambiguous sequences resulting from
the differences of the two prophages were refined by
primer walks on fosmid clones containing each prophage segment. The overall error rate of the assembled
genome sequence was calculated as 0.09 bp/10 kb, and
verification of the assembly came from the consistency
of fosmid end reads on the final contig.
The sequence was validated by comparison against
independent sequence data generated using a GAII platform. The 65-bp reads were assembled by scaffolding
against the original sequence using Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner (BWA) [135]. SNPs and INDELS relative to original sequence were identified using SAMtools [136].
Corrections were made based on confidence (related to
depth of local sequencing) for each reported discrepancy.
Annotation

ORF prediction was performed using Prodigal [32] and
Glimmer [33]. AutoFACT [137], an automatic annotation pipeline, was employed to score predicted ORFs
against existing databases, including non-redundant protein sequences (nr) in GenBank [138], KEGG [139] and
COG [140], using homology search. Where the AutoFACT annotation differed from the K-12 annotation for
shared orthologs, the difference was resolved through
manual curation. In particular, if AutoFACT proposed a
less ambiguous annotation, experimental evidence for
the AutoFACT annotation was sought in the literature.
tRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [141],
rRNA genes were predicted using rnammer [142], and
ncRNA genes were predicted using INFERNAL [143].
These predictions were integrated into the annotation
using Artemis [144]. ORFs which resided within rRNA

Page 15 of 20

genes and ncRNAs covering rRNA or tRNA genes were
removed. Transcriptional start sites were further curated
using Artemis and modified based on matches to homologous genes from E. coli K-12, B and Crooks. CRISPR
regions were predicted using a combination of CRT
[145] and PILER [146].
Comparative Genome Analysis

Comparative genome analysis was based on proteincoding sequences predicted from the E. coli W (ATCC
9637) annotation and three other safe E. coli strains: K12 MG1655 [GenBank:U00096], B REL606 [GenBank:
CP000819], and Crooks ATCC 8739 [GenBank:
CP000946]. Comparative analysis of the E. coli W plasmids pRK1 and pRK2 was based on protein-coding
sequences and was performed against five representative
plasmids: pSE11-1 [GenBank: AP009241], pSE11-3
[GenBank: AP009243], ColIb-P9 [GenBank:AB021078],
R64 [GenBank:AP005147, and pSE11-5 [GenBank:
AP009245]. All-against-All BLASTP for amino acids was
used to assign orthologs; these were further curated
using gene context data, analysis of orthologs provided
by the E. coli B REL606 genome annotation, and literature data.
Protein-coding genes and pseudogenes were mapped
to orthologs in each of the three other sequenced
laboratory strains by BLAST to attain the bi-directional
best hit (BBH) relationships. Genes with high sequence
similarities to a gene in another strain but differing significantly in length were inspected manually to establish
the cause of variation.
Insertion Sequences (ISs) for E. coli W, Crooks and
SE11 were annotated using BLASTN against the ISFinder database [147,148]. Large mobile elements and rearrangement hot spot (Rhs) elements were identified
during the annotation using BLASTP against the nr
database in GenBank. Labels for rhs genes were assigned
using nomenclature described by Jackson et. al. (2009).
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the gene
concatenation method [36]. Concatenated sequences of
seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh,
purA, recA) and sequence types (STs) of E. coli reference (ECOR) collection strains and related organisms
were downloaded from the E. coli MLST Database
[149]. W gene sequences were aligned using ClustalW
[150] then concatenated. A phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbour joining method with 1000 bootstrap iterations using MEGA4 [151].
Motility Assay

Motility assays was performed as described previously
[95] with the following alterations: assays were performed at 25°C and 37°C only, and antibiotics were not
included in the medium.

GSR Construction

The GSR was created using AUTOGRAPH [116] to
generate a database of predicted ORFs against the
E. coli K-12 GSR, iAF1260 [115]. Additional reactions
were added or removed based on an in-depth literature
search, high-throughput carbon/nitrogen/phosphorous/
sulphur source growth assays (PM Kit, Biolog, Hayward,
CA) and in silico validation using the COBRA toolbox
[152] to ensure all biomass components could be
synthesized. In silico simulations used the biomass composition of iAF1260 [115].
Gene-protein-reaction associations were curated and
assigned a confidence score based on experimental data
and information from the E. coli K-12 iAF1260 GEM.
Boolean logic was employed to denote the relationships
between proteins and whether they formed complexes; isozymes were described as an ‘OR’ relationship and protein
complexes were represented as ‘AND’ relationships linked
to other peptides required for a functional protein. In cases
where different combinations of proteins can form a complex which catalyses the same reaction, each complex was
represented by an ‘AND’ relationship and ‘OR’ relationships were made between complexes. Gaps in the metabolic network, resulting from missing genes which are
essential for the synthesis of biomass components and production of waste products, were filled by incorporating
reactions from the iAF1260 and KEGG database.

Additional file 1: List of CDSs which occur once in the genome of
one safe strain but more than once in genomes of other safe
strains. A list of CDSs which have only one copy in one safe strain, but
have more than one ortholog in one or more other safe strains. For
example, hokE occurs once in the K-12 genome but multiple times in
the W genome. The CDS count of each strain does not reconcile unless
these one-to-many and many-to-many relationships are considered.
Detailed CDS counts are provided within the file. The counts explain the
CDS skew which occurs when counting the number of CDSs in Figure 2
for K-12, B, or ATCC 8739. For example, in ATCC 8739 one copy of
EcolC_3064 is present, while two are present in W as ECW_m0635 and
ECW_m0636. When shared orthologs are counted the number in the
ATCC 8739-W region can be one or two, depending on whether the
number of orthologs is taken from W or ATCC 8739s context. We have
thus detailed all orthologous CDSs which are found in different copy
numbers in the other safe strains genomes.
