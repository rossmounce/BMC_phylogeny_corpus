Abstract

information

Conclusion: We show that a gene-desert region at 13q21 of approximately 3.9 Mb in size
possesses an inherent potential to form evolutionarily new centromeres over, at least,
approximately 95 million years of mammalian evolution. The striking absence of genes may
represent an important property, making the region tolerant to the extensive pericentromeric
reshuffling during subsequent evolution. Comparison of the pericentromeric organization of
chromosome 13 in four Old World monkey species revealed many differences in sequence
organization. The region contains clusters of duplicons showing peculiar features.

interactions

Results: Chromosome 13 evolution was studied, using FISH experiments, across several diverse
superordinal phylogenetic clades spanning >100 million years of evolution. The analysis revealed
exceptional conservation among primates (hominoids, Old World monkeys, and New World
monkeys), Carnivora (cat), Perissodactyla (horse), and Cetartiodactyla (pig). In contrast, the
centromeres in both Old World monkeys and pig have apparently repositioned independently to
a central location (13q21). We compared these results to the positions of two human 13q21
neocentromeres using chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic microarrays.

refereed research

Background: Evolutionary centromere repositioning and human analphoid neocentromeres
occurring in clinical cases are, very likely, two stages of the same phenomenon whose properties
still remain substantially obscure. Chromosome 13 is the chromosome with the highest number of
neocentromeres. We reconstructed the mammalian evolutionary history of this chromosome and
characterized two human neocentromeres at 13q21, in search of information that could improve
our understanding of the relationship between evolutionarily new centromeres, inactivated
centromeres, and clinical neocentromeres.

Background

Human neocentromeres are functional, analphoid centromeres that emerge epigenetically in ectopic chromosomal
regions [1-4]. In the majority of cases, neocentromeres
appear to rescue the mitotic stability of acentric chromosomal
fragments, often giving rise to aneuploidy [5]. Studies on the
evolutionary history of human chromosomes have shown that
the centromere can reposition along the chromosome without
marker order variation or leading to aneuploidy. This phenomenon is known as 'centromere repositioning' (CR) and
has been reported in primates [6-11], in non-primate placental mammals [12,13], marsupials [14], birds [15], and plants
[16].
Recently, two cases of 'repositioned' centromeres in otherwise normal individuals were fortuitously discovered [11,17].
These two cases can be considered as evolutionary centromere repositioning 'in progress' [17].
Two human neocentromeres were cytogenetically mapped to
duplicons that flanked an ancestral centromere in band
15q24-26 that inactivated before hominoid divergence [10].
Additionally, a neocentromere at 3q26.1 was found located in
the same chromosomal domain where an evolutionarily new
centromere appeared in the Old World monkey (OWM)
ancestor [11]. These studies, which used relatively low resolution cytogenetic techniques, suggested an intriguing relationship between human neocentromeres, ancestral centromeres
and evolutionarily new centromeres (repositioned centromeres), which could represent the same phenomenon at different stages of fixation.
Sequences underlining some human neocentromeres have
been identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation and
genomic microarray (ChIP CHIP) analysis [18-20]. However,
despite these recent advances, hypotheses to comprehensively explain the neocentromere phenomenon remain elusive. Phylogenomic studies could eventually provide
information about the features, mechanisms and processes of
evolutionarily new centromere seeding and development. We
report here the evolutionary history of chromosome 13, which
exhibits the most extensive clustering of neocentromeres of
any human chromosome [3-5]. We found that this chromosome has been exceptionally conserved in evolution and we
identified a locus, corresponding to human chromosome
band 13q21, where CR events independently occurred in the
OWM and pig lineages, whose ancestors diverged at least 95
million years ago (Mya). To further delineate the relationship
between human neocentromeres and evolutionarily new centromeres, we used high resolution ChIP CHIP technology to
determine the position of two human neocentromeres located
in band 13q21. This analysis showed that the neocentromeres
do not colocalize with each other or with the OWM and pig
evolutionarily new centromeres at the sequence level, but
instead map within a few Mb of them.

Results
Chromosome 13 evolution
Chromosome 13 evolution was studied by co-hybridizing a
panel of 12 single-copy human BAC clones distributed along
chromosome 13 (Table 1, clones in bold). The probes were
hybridized on metaphase spreads of 11 primate species (see
Materials and methods), including great apes and representatives of OWMs and New World monkeys (NWMs). Examples
of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments are
reported in Figure 1a-f. Mapping comparison, not considering the centromere, clearly showed that humans and ancestors of OWMs and NWMs share an identical marker order
arrangement (Figure 2a).
This analysis was also performed in selected mammals for
which BAC libraries were available. The sequence encompassed by each human BAC of the basic panel (in bold in
Table 1) was searched for conservation against mouse and rat
genomes. 'Overgo' probes were designed on the most conserved region of each BAC. The only exception was marker G,
for which a highly conserved region was identified 2 Mb apart
from the corresponding human marker. The overgo probes
were then used to screen BAC libraries from cattle (CHORI240 library), horse (CHORI-241), pig (CHORI-242), and cat
(RPCI-86). This approach facilitated comparative mapping
by assembling a panel of mammalian probes (Additional data
file 1) orthologous to the loci encompassed by the human
BACs. The identification of additional cattle probes took
advantage of the collection of BAC clones positioned on the
human sequence by BAC ends, as reported in Larkin et al.
[21]. Results in non-primate mammals are also reported in
Figure 2a, which shows the most parsimonious chromosomal
changes necessary to reconstruct chromosome 13 evolution.
In a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of 64 species, Murphy et al. [22] defined four large superordinal clades of placental mammals, where Carnivora (cat (FCA)),
Perissodactyla (horse (ECA)), and Cetartiodactyla (cattle
(BTA), and pig (SUS)) belonged to clade IV and primates
belonged to clade III. Remarkably, only a small inversion
(markers E-F-G, Table 1, Figure 2a) distinguished the marker
order of cat, horse, and pig (clade IV) with respect to primates
(clade III).

Centromere repositioning
The position of the centromere, operatively defined as the primary constriction of metaphase chromosomes, was found
radically displaced, with respect to surrounding markers, in
both OWM and pig (Figure 2a,b). We further refined the centromere position in OWMs using several human BACs spanning the interval H to I (BACs H1 to H9) that define a domain
in band 13q21 of approximately 3.9 Mb (61,111,769 to
65,282,688 bp) (Table 1). FISH results (Figure 1a-f) showed
that the centromeres in each of the four OWMs analyzed
(Macaca mulatta (MMU), Papio hamadryas (PHA), Trachypithecus cristatus (TCR), and Cercopithecus aethiops
(CAE)) were located in rather distinct chromosomal loca-

Chromosome 13 rearrangements in New World
monkeys

In the wooly monkey (LLA), marker order was substantially
conserved with respect to the NWM ancestor, except for the
location of marker A between markers D and E, where an evolutionarily new centromere can be hypothesized (Figure 2a).

information

Reiterative FISH experiments using additional human BAC
clones were performed to more finely map the chromosome
13 fission and inversion breakpoints in NWMs (Table 1, Figure 2a). Human BAC probes that spanned breakpoints were
identified by hybridization to both sides of the break on separate locations or chromosomes. In the dusky titi (CMO), the
fission breakpoint was localized to probe C1 (BAC RP11136G6, Table 1), which hybridized to the pericentromeric
region of both CMO21 and CMO18 (Figure 2a). In the common marmoset (CJA, Callitrichinae), the fission breakpoint
between markers F and G was localized to probe G2 (BAC
RP11-939G7, Table 1), which hybridized to both the telomere
of CJA5 and the centromere of CJA chromosome 1. The
breakpoint of a subtelomeric inversion in CJA1 encompassing
markers N-M-L was also mapped to probe K2 (RP11-351H1,
Table 1), which hybridized to both the breakpoint and the telomere (Figure 2a).

interactions

Cat chromosome A1 is the result of a fusion of two chromosomes corresponding to human chromosomes 13 and 5 (Figure 2a). Marker order of the portion corresponding to human
chromosome 13 was substantially conserved with respect to
the mammalian ancestor (Figure 2a). In cat, markers N (distal telomeric in most species) and H8 (pericentromeric in
OWM and pig) yielded duplicated signals at the FCA-A1 centromere and at the H8 locus (Figure 1f). In cattle (BTA),
chromosome BTA12 contained a large paracentric inversion

relative to the ancestral chromosome. The breakpoints of this
inversion were mapped at the ancestral centromere (marker
A) and between markers H and I, where the OWM and pig
evolutionarily new centromeres are located.

tions. In both MMU and PHA, several of these BACs were
seen as duplicated signals on either side of the centromere. To
better analyze the H1 to H9 region in pig (SUS), overgo probes
were designed on the sequence of all H1 to H9 BACs. Only
overgo probes from H1, H6, and H8 sequences provided positive results in library screening. Examples of co-hybridization FISH experiments using H6 and H8 probes on pig are
reported in Figure 1e. These data showed that the pig centromere was also found in the region between probes H1 and H9
(Figure 2b). We can conclude that these CR events to the
same chromosomal region were independent, because pig
and OWMs diverged more than 90 Mya and belong to different mammalian clades. We extended our analysis to the elephant (Loxodonta africana, Afroteria, clade I), which is an
outgroup with respect to clades III and IV [22]. We found that
the elephant homolog to chromosome 13 was highly rearranged and provided no information on the original position
of the centromere of the ancestral chromosome 13 or on the
E-F-G inversion (data not shown).

Further analysis showed that a region of approximately 1.5
Mb delimited by markers B1 and A1 (Table 1) was found
transposed from the pericentromeric region of the assumed
primate ancestral chromosome to the new centromeric region
of LLA8 (Figure 2a). Co-hybridization experiments suggested
that the orientation of the segment toward the centromere is
conserved with respect to humans. Marker B1 appeared to
span the transposition breakpoint, while marker A1 was
located adjacent to the heterochromatin/pericentromere
boundary on the short-arm side. In this context it is worth
noting that Cebidae (SSC and CJA) and Atelidae (LLA)
diverged after the split of their common ancestor from
Pitheciidae (CMO) [23].

13q21 neocentromeres
At least four independent cases of human neocentromeres
have been observed in band 13q21, and thus we explored
whether the position of these neocentromeres corresponds to
the evolutionarily new OWM and pig centromeres. Three
13q21 neocentromeres have been observed on inverted duplication (invdup) chromosomes [5,24] and one on a small neocentric ring13q21 chromosome derived from a paracentric
deletion of 13q21 (Figure 3a) [4,25]. The size of the ring13q21
neocentric chromosome (and thus the region that contains
the neocentromere) was determined by FISH mapping to be
approximately 11 Mb, bounded by the absence of BACs RP11468L10 (chr13: 64.0 Mb) and BAC RP11-332E3 (chr13: 75.3
Mb) [25]. The neocentromere on an invdup13q14-qter chromosome (cell line 13a) [5] was confirmed to be located to this
same approximately 11 Mb region by simultaneous FISH with
BAC probes and immunofluorescence with antibodies to
CENP-C (data not shown). This cytogenetic mapping showed
that the 11 Mbp region containing the human 13q21 neocentromeres was overlapping with the locations of the CAE and
SUS centromeres, between probes H7 and H9 (Table 1).

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R91

for BAC RP11-23B16 (log2 = 3.87 ± 0.17), which localized the
CENP-C binding domain for this neocentromere (Figure 3c).
The primary data for the ChIP on CHIP analysis is provided
in the Additional data files 7 to 17. Previous studies have
shown that CENP-A and CENP-C co-immunoprecipitated
onto the same chromatin at endogenous centromeres [26].
ChIP on CHIP analysis at a 13q32 neocentromere showed that
the CENP-A and CENP-C chromatin domains colocalized at
the resolution of a BAC array (Additional data files 2, 3, 16,
and 17). Therefore, the use of either CENP-A or CENP-C will
accurately identify the 13q21 neocentromere DNA using the
BAC array.
Thus, these two human 13q21 neocentromeres occupied distinct genomic regions in 13q21.33 separated by approximately 3 Mb (Table 1). Furthermore, this analysis
demonstrated that these 13q21 neocentromeres were separated from the OWM centromeric region by approximately 4
to 7 Mb (the position of the centromere in OWMs was
assumed to be located in the middle of the H1 to H8 region, at
approximately 63 Mb). The size of the CENP binding domains
at these neocentromeres was estimated by removing overlapping regions of neighboring BACs that were negative; for
example, the overlap of BAC RP11-520F4 and -321F21 was
removed from BAC RP11-23B16 (Figure 3d). This may either
over- or underestimate the CENP binding domain, depending
on the size and resolution of the BAC clones and/or the sensitivity of the ChIP on CHIP. Like other neocentromeres [1820], the CENP binding regions of these 13q21 neocentromeres, as estimated from the BAC array, were somewhat
enriched in percent AT and LINE elements, and reduced in
SINE elements relative to the genome averages (invdup13q,
182 kb, 65.0% AT, 30.61% LINE, 9.69% SINE; Ring, 52 kb,
66.1% AT, 22.41% LINE, 6.15% SINE).

13q21 gene content
A genomic microarray (CHIP) was constructed containing
107 contiguous BACs (Figure 3d) spanning the entire
ring13q21 chromosome, from BAC RP11-468L10 to RP11332E3, inclusive. Neocentromere DNA from the invdup13q14
chromosome was obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from the cell line using antibodies to CENP-A.
CENP-A ChIP DNA labeled with Cy-5 and input chromatin
DNA labeled with Cy-3 were simultaneously hybridized to the
genomic microarray, and positive BACs identified by the Cy5/Cy-3 intensity ratios [19].
All BACs showed background ratios (log2 ≤ 1.19) except for
three contiguous BACs (RP11-209P2 (log2 = 3.74 ± 1.16), 543G6 (4.23 ± 0.91), and -512J14 (3.07 ± 0.61)), which localized the CENP-A binding domain for this neocentromere
(Figure 3b). The CENP-A ChIP protocol was technically not
possible on the ring 13q21 cell line due to premature nuclear
lysis and, therefore, an alternative ChIP protocol using antibodies to CENP-C was performed (see Materials and methods). All BACs showed background ratios (log2 ≤ 0.97) except

Chromosome 13 has one of the lowest gene densities for any
human chromosome [27]. We investigated the gene content
of the approximately 3.9 Mb interval defined by the H1 to H9
clones (chr13: 61,178,154 to 65,079,597) harboring the OWM
and pig evolutionarily new neocentromeres, by querying the
specific tracks of the UCSC genome browser (UCSC, March
2006 release). RefSeq annotation does not report any gene in
this region. AK127969 and AK098560, reported on the
'known genes' track appear as processed pseudogenes. Moreover, the region containing these RNAs is a portion of a duplicated sequence, with two palindromic copies in the region
and a third copy at ch13:45,879,285-45,932,723. A copy of
SATR2 satellite is localized in each of the three duplicated
regions (chr13: 45,933,879 to 45,936,187, chr13: 63,306,505
to 63,309,036, chr13: 63,215,026 to 63,217,655). The genes
PCDH20 (protocadherin 20, chr13: 60,881,821 to
60,887,282) and PCDH9 (protocadherin 9 isoform 1 precursor, chr13: 65,774,967 to 66,702,464) delimit this approximately 3.9 Mb gene desert.

alignments: the number of older duplications is five times
that of more recent duplications, while the ratio when compared to the whole chromosome 13 for older duplications is
two-fold (Additional data file 4). Sequence similarity searches
of these divergent, short duplications show that more than
64% (51/79) of these regions correspond to exonic portions of
other genes (ovostatin, olfactory receptors, and so on) or
spliced ESTs, although the genes are not annotated as such
within 13q21. We identified the remnants of intron-exon
structure for 25 of these regions (19.2 kb) consistent with
unprocessed pseudogenes, which were duplicated early during primate evolution (Additional data file 4). Several of the
alignments show sequence homology to extant pericentromeric regions on human chromosomes 1p, 2p, 6p and 9q

interactions

Because of the association between ancestral centromeres
and pericentromeric duplications [10,28], we examined the
duplication content of the region corresponding to the evolutionarily new centromeres of 13q21 of humans in more detail
(61 to 72 Mb). No enrichment of segmental duplications (>1
kb in length, >90% sequence identity) was observed within
this particular region of 13q21 (0.5%) when compared to the
chromosome 13 average (2.83%). To identify more ancient
segmental duplications, we implemented an alternative
approach based on whole genome assembly comparisons
using BLASTZ (see Materials and methods), which facilitates
the detection of shorter and less homologous duplications
(>250 bp, >80% sequence identity). Based on this analysis,
we identified an excess of short, more divergent pairwise

(Additional data files 5 and 6). When the interval is refined
further to 127 kb (chr13: 63,188,927 to 63,316,389), the
number of pairwise alignments increases several orders of
magnitude when compared to the chromosome 13 average
(18,354 alignments/Mb versus 161 alignments/Mb). However, the actual number of non-redundant duplicated basepairs increases only moderately, suggesting that there is a
limited amount of sequence that has been the target of several
independent duplications. Although not definitive, these
sequence properties are potentially consistent with an
ancient pericentromeric region.

Discussion

We have investigated the evolutionary history of chromosome
13 in 11 primate species and in selected non-primate mammals by analysis of marker order arrangement and centromere position, using FISH co-hybridization experiments of
appropriate panels of BAC clones (Table 1, Figure 2a). If the
centromere position is not taken into account, the marker
order of the human chromosome 13 is perfectly conserved in
squirrel monkey (SSC, NWM), in OWMs, and in hominoids.
This form, therefore, is considered ancestral to primates. Cat
(Carnivora), horse (Perissodactyla), and pig (Cetartiodactyla), belonging to mammalian clade IV, share substantially
the same marker order arrangement as the primate ancestor
except for the inversion of the region encompassed by markers E-F-G (Figure 2a). A limited number of additional inversions and translocations accounted for the chromosome 13
arrangements from the other analyzed mammalian species
(Figure 2a).
Analysis of the elephant from mammalian clade 1 (Afrotheria), which branched from placental mammals about 105 Mya
[29], was not informative in resolving the origin of chromosome 13. In this respect, however, it is worth noting that
Svartman et al. [30] have reported that the human chromosome 13 painting library yielded a single signal on the chromosome 2 short arm of the Afrotherian short-eared elephant
shrew (Macroscelides proboscideus), indicating that the
chromosome was a unique entity in the Afrotheria ancestor.
The radiation hybrid data reported by Murphy et al. [12] did
not detect the E-F-G inversion that we detected in cat, perhaps due to the limits of the radiation hybrid data set they
used. The detailed physical map of the cow genome [31] is
completely consistent with our data. The analysis of the
chicken genome revealed that the entire euchromatic portion
of human chromosome 13 is a continuous segment constituting approximately one-third of the chicken chromosome 1
long arm, in inverted orientation (chr1: 132,956,175 to
171,200,311) [32]; UCSC, February 2004 assembly). Within
this segment there is an inversion whose breakpoint limits
are, in the human sequence, within the intervals 40,284,579
to 40,380,292 bp (first breakpoint) and 51,628,385 to
51,849,306 bp (second breakpoint), which corresponds to the

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R91

E-F-G inversion detected in non-primate mammals. Amazingly, these findings strongly suggest that the chromosome 13
marker order is shared by birds and mammals, although they
diverged more than 250 Mya [32].

Centromere repositioning
Hominoids and squirrel monkeys (SSC, NWM; clade III) and
horse (clade IV) all have centromeres adjacent to marker A,
which may represent a centromere position shared by the
ancestor of primates (clade III) and Cetartiodactyla (clade
IV). However, in all the studied OWMs (CAE, MMU, TCR,
PHA; clade III) and in the pig (Cetartiodactyla, clade IV), the
centromere was found to have repositioned to a region corresponding to the human 13q21 chromosomal region. The CR
events were investigated in detail using additional probes
spanning the region encompassed by markers H and I. The
results show an extensive reshuffling of sequences around the
centromere among the four studied OWM species (Figure
2b). The locations of the centromeres appear dispersed in an
area of approximately 3.9 Mb with respect to the human
sequence representing the ancestral form of the region. These
centromeres are, very likely, the result of a single CR event in
the OWM ancestor. Cercopithecinae/Colobinae diverged
approximately 14.4 to 17.9 Mya [33], while the genera Papio
and Macaca branched about 8.6 to 10.9 Mya [33]. The pericentromeric differences, therefore, provide evidence of an
unprecedented degree of local centromeric/pericentromeric
plasticity accompanied by extensive sequence remodeling.
The position of the evolutionarily new centromere in pig falls
within this region (Figure 2b). Mammalian clades III and IV
diverged around 95 Mya [22], OWM and hominoids diverged
approximately 25 Mya, and Cetartiodactyla (pig) and
Perissodactyla (horse) diverged approximately 83 Mya [34].
We conclude that the pig centromere represents an independent centromere repositioning event in the same chromosomal
region. This suggests that there are some features, conserved
in the mammalian lineages for at least 70 million years, predisposing this region to centromere formation.
The observation that the region where the OWM and pig evolutionarily new centromeres were seeded is completely
devoid of genes is a key finding. Studies of human neocentromere cases have shown that the neocentromere does not
influence gene expression per se [35-37]. However, the subsequent heterochromatization of the region that invariably follows the evolutionarily new centromere seeding could, in
theory, negatively affect gene expression. The finding that the
relatively large H1 to H9 interval is completely devoid of
genes may permit extensive sequence reshuffling, an inherent
property of eukaryotic centromeres. We have recently
reported that the centromere of OWM chromosome 3 is an
evolutionarily new centromere that was generated after
OWM divergence from Hominoidea [11]. Similarly to the
present findings, the centromere seeding occurred within an
approximately 430 kb region completely devoid of genes. It
can be hypothesized, therefore, that the probability that an

Human neocentromeres

Human chromosome 13 contains the highest number of
reported neocentromeres of any human chromosome, which
group into two major clusters at 13q21 and at 13q32 [4,5].
Thus, we examined the correspondence of human 13q21 neocentromeres with the OWM and pig chromosome 13 evolutionarily new centromeres. This analysis showed that two
independent 13q21 neocentromeres were located approximately 4 Mb and 7 Mb distal to the OWM/pig centromeres.
The present study, which used high resolution 'ChIP on a
CHIP' technology (Figure 3) [19], did not demonstrate a precise co-localization between the neo- and evolutionarily new
centromeres on 13q21. The relatively long distance between
human neocentromeres and newly emerged evolutionary
centromeres could be taken as evidence against a relationship
between them. The two neocentromeres at 15q24-26 reported
by Ventura et al. [10] were found to map about 10 Mb apart.
This entire area, however, was shown to represent the wide
chromosomal region where pericentromeric duplications of
an inactivated centromere were dispersed following the chromosomal fission that generated chromosomes 14 and 15 [10].
As far as chromosome 13, the evolutionary history did not
suggest any ancestral inactivated centromeres at 13q21. On
the other hand, a significant enrichment of older (80% to
90%) segmental duplications corresponding to the exonic
portions of genes was observed for a 127 kb portion of the
region of 13q21. Although segmental duplications were seen
throughout, the enrichment was most significant for this 127
kb segment.

reports

Additional potential CR events were observed on mammalian
chromosomes in this study. On chromosome LLA8, the best
explanation for the emergence of the centromere between
markers D and E is the transposition of a 1.5 Mb region that
contained the original centromere, which remained active
(Figure 2a). This event would not represent true CR as previously defined [7]. However, it is possible that the transposition occurred after the CR event as a result of sequence
movement from the inactivated, ancestral centromere to the
newly formed centromere, as part of an accruing/degrading
process. In this light, it is noteworthy that the transposed
region is almost entirely composed of human pericentromeric
segmental duplications.

region must be found that contains both, as seen on human
chromosome 3q26 [11]. Endogenous centromeres are relatively easy to localize in mammalian chromosomes using
cytogenetic techniques due to the primary constriction and,
more importantly, the large region of repetitive satellite DNA
that inevitably forms there over evolutionary time [28]. However, human neocentromeres are more difficult to localize
since they have not accumulated any repetitive DNA. Therefore, we used ChIP CHIP technology to precisely localize
human neocentromeres and compared them to evolutionarily
new centromeres.

reviews

The centromere of cat chromosome FCA-A1 was found
located, with respect to the location of the ancestral
mammalian centromere, at the opposite telomeric region,
adjacent to marker N, where this chromosome fused with the
homolog of human chromosome 5 (Figure 2a). This CR may
represent a case of jumping centromeres, which is not a rare
event in acrocentric chromosomes of primates [11]. Murphy
et al. [12] have noted that telomere-to-centromere conversions are not rare in non-primate mammals. The crosshybridization signals of H8 and N markers in cat, and the fact
that the two breakpoints of the paracentric inversion in the
cattle chromosome BTA12 fall in the centromeric region and
in the region corresponding to the 13q21 in humans, suggest
a special connection in mammals between the chromosome
13 ancestral centromere and the 13q21 region.

comment

evolutionarily new centromere will become fixed during evolution is dependent upon the absence of nearby genes whose
alteration due to the reshuffling could be selectively disadvantageous. Preliminary results of the characterization of the
evolutionarily new centromere of macaque chromosome 6
are consistent with this model (our unpublished data).

The present study has tracked the extremely conserved evolution of human chromosome 13. The results defined important
aspects of the complex scenario of centromere repositioning
and human neocentromere emergence. The centromere of
this chromosome repositioned in the same 13q21 region in
OWMs and pigs, two species that diverged about 95 Mya.
Fine-scale mapping of two clinical neocentromeres suggest
that this propensity to form neocentromeres persists within
the human population. The absence of genes in the region
may be a critical component to progression/fixation of the
novel centromere. Cross-species comparisons of chromosome 13 pericentromeric regions in OWM unveiled a striking
reshuffling activity.

comment

This study adds two additional neocentromeres to the five
that have been precisely mapped using chromatin immunoprecipitation [20]. However, comparative sequence analysis
of these seven neocentromere sequences revealed no specific
features in common to which neocentromerization competence could be ascribed. The centromere forming potential of
specific genomic regions may reflect some relatively longrange property of the chromosomal domain, as opposed to
the presence of specific sequence elements.

We used a BLAST-based detection scheme [46] to identify all
pairwise similarities representing duplicated regions (≥1 kb
and ≥90% identity) within the finished sequence of chromosome 13 and compared to all other chromosomes in the NCBI
genome assembly (May 2004, build 35). Divergence of duplication, and the number of substitutions per site between the
two sequences, were calculated using Kimura's two-parameter method, which corrects for multiple events and transversion/transition mutational biases [47]. In order to detect
more divergent duplications, a second all-by-all genome

13q32 [19] and hybridized to the 13q21 BAC array. For antiCENP-A, all BACs showed background ratios of log2 ≤ 0.88,
indicating no CENP-A binding in the 13q21 region, while the
alpha satellite DNA showed a ratio of log2 = 6.67. For antiCENP-C, all BACs showed background ratios of log2 < 1.48,
indicating no CENP-C binding in the 13q21 region, while the
alpha satellite DNA showed a ratio of log2 = 5. All the primary
data for the ChIP on CHIP analysis are provided in Additional
