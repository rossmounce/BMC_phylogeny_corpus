Abstract
Background: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are frequently isolated from domestic and wild
birds throughout the world. All APMVs, except avian metapneumovirus, are classified in the genus
Avulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. At present, the APMVs of genus Avulavirus are divided into
nine serological types (APMV 1–9). Newcastle disease virus represents APMV-1 and is the most
characterized among all APMV types. Very little is known about the molecular characteristics and
pathogenicity of APMV 2–9.
Results: As a first step towards understanding the molecular genetics and pathogenicity of APMV4, we have sequenced the complete genome of APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 and
determined its pathogenicity in embryonated chicken eggs. The genome of APMV-4 is 15,054
nucleotides (nt) in length, which is consistent with the "rule of six". The genome contains six nonoverlapping genes in the order 3'-N-P/V-M-F-HN-L-5'. The genes are flanked on either side by
highly conserved transcription start and stop signals and have intergenic sequences varying in length
from 9 to 42 nt. The genome contains a 55 nt leader region at 3' end. The 5' trailer region is 17 nt,
which is the shortest in the family Paramyxoviridae. Analysis of mRNAs transcribed from the P gene
showed that 35% of the transcripts were edited by insertion of one non-templated G residue at an
editing site leading to production of V mRNAs. No message was detected that contained insertion
of two non-templated G residues, indicating that the W mRNAs are inefficiently produced in
APMV-4 infected cells. The cleavage site of the F protein (DIPQR↓F) does not conform to the
preferred cleavage site of the ubiquitous intracellular protease furin. However, exogenous
proteases were not required for the growth of APMV-4 in cell culture, indicating that the cleavage
does not depend on a furin site.
Conclusion: Phylogenic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of viruses of all five genera of the
family Paramyxoviridae showed that APMV-4 is more closely related to the APMVs than to other
paramyxoviruses, reinforcing the classification of all APMVs in the genus Avulavirus of the family
Paramyxoviridae.

Background
The family Paramyxoviridae contains a large number of
viruses of humans and animals [1]. These viruses have
been isolated from many species of avian, terrestrial and
aquatic animals worldwide. The members of this family
includes many human pathogens such as measles (MeV),
mumps (MuV) and human respiratory syncytial virus
(hRSV) and many important animal pathogens such as
Newcastle disease virus (NDV), canine distemper (CDV)
and rinderpest (RPV) [2]. Some of the members of the
family Paramyxoviridae are well characterized, while characteristics for other members of this family remain
unknown. Members of this family are enveloped viruses
possessing a non-segmented negative-strand genome [1]
and are divided into two subfamilies; Paramyxovirinae and
Pneumovirinae. Subfamily Paramyxovirinae is divided into
five genera: Rubulavirus [MuV, human parainfluenza
viruses (hPIV) -2 and -4, simian virus type 5 (SV5) and
Tioman virus (TiV)], Respirovirus [Sendai virus (SeV) and
hPIV-1 and -3], Henipavirus [Hendra virus (HeV) and
Nipah virus (NiV)], Morbillivirus [MeV, CDV and RPV],
and Avulavirus [avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes
1–9]. Subfamily Pneumovirinae is divided into two genera:
Pneumovirus (hRSV and its animal counterparts including
bovine respiratory syncytial virus [bRSV]), and Metapneumovirus [comprising human metapneumovirus (HMPV)
and avian metapneumovirus (AMPV)] [1,3,4].
The genomes of the paramyxoviruses vary in length from
13–19 kb and contain 6–10 genes encoding up to 12 different proteins. Transcription begins at single promoter at
the 3' leader end and the genes are copied into individual
mRNAs by a start-stop-restart mechanism guided by conserved gene-start and gene-end transcription signals that
flank the individual genes [1]. Genome replication
involves the synthesis of a complete positive-sense copy of
the genome that is called the antigenome and serves as a
template for producing progeny genomes. All members of
family Paramyxoviridae encode a nucleoprotein (N), a
phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F), an attachment protein called the hemagglutinin
(H) or haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or glycoprotein (G), and a large polymerase protein (L) [1,2].
All APMVs have been classified into nine different serotypes based on HI test and all NDV strains belong to
APMV serotype 1 [5]. Since NDV can cause severe disease
in chickens, APMV-1 is the most extensively characterized
serotype of the APMVs. Very little is known about the
molecular and biological characteristics and pathogenicity of APMV serotypes 2–9. APMV types 2, 3, 6 and 7 have
been associated with disease in domestic poultry [6-10].
The APMV-5 (Kunitachi virus) isolated from budgerigar is
known to cause disease in wild birds [11]. Other serotypes, including APMV-4, -8, and -9, have been isolated

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/124

from ducks, waterfowls, and other wild birds with no clinical signs of disease [5,12-15]. The strain duck/Hong
Kong/D3/75, isolated from a duck in Hong Kong in 1975,
was found to be representative of a distinct serotype of
APMVs [16], later designated as APMV serotype 4 on the
basis of HI and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) tests [17].
Experimental infection of chickens with APMV-4 and
APMV-6 showed mild interstitial pneumonia, catarrhal
tracheitis, and BALT or GALT hyperplasia, suggestive of
viral disease [18].
An understanding of the molecular and biological characteristics of APMV -2 to-9 is of general interest and is
important for developing vaccines and diagnostic tests
against these viruses. To date, the complete genome
sequence for representatives of APMV-1 [19], APMV-2
[20], APMV-3 [21] and APMV-6 [22] are available. As a
first step towards understanding the molecular biology
and pathogenicity of APMV-4, we have determined the
growth characteristics and complete genome sequence of
the APMV-4 prototype strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75
(GenBank accession no. FJ177514). Previously, sequence
was available only for the APMV-4 HN gene (GenBank
accession no. D14031). The sequence of the strain duck/
Hong Kong/D3/75 was compared with those of other
APMV serotypes and other paramyxoviruses in order to
determine phylogenetic relationships.

Methods
Virus and cells
The APMV-4 prototype strain, duck/Hong Kong/D3/75
was obtained from National Veterinary Services Laboratory, (Ames, IA). The chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1),
Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2), Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK
21), Bovine Turbinate (BTu), Pig Kidney (PK15), Quail
fibrosarcoma (QT35), Rabbit Kidney cells (RK13), African
green monkey kidney (Vero), Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK), and duck embryo (CCL-141) cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA), and turkey embryo fibroblast
(TEF) primary cells were made in our laboratory. The DF1
and QT35 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum
essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, while
the other cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential
medium containing 10% FCS, at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Virus propagation and requirement of exogenous protease
The APMV-4 prototype strain, duck/Hong Kong/D3/75
was propagated in 9 day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
embryonated chicken eggs by inoculation through the
allantoic cavity route. The titer of virus was determined by
hemagglutination (HA) test using 0.5% chicken RBC at
room temperature. Virus propagation was carried out in
different cell lines either in the absence or presence of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/124

exogenous protease in order to determine a suitable cell
line for virus growth. The cell culture medium was supplemented with 5% allantoic fluid, or 1–5 μg/ml of acetyl
trypsin/ml (Gibco), or 1–5 μg/ml of α-chymotrypsin/ml
(Sigma), each of which provided a source of protease for
cleavage of the F protein, if necessary. The cell lines supporting viral growth were observed by corroborating cytopathic effects (CPE) in cells and HA titer in cell culture
supernatant both before and after freeze-thawing cycles.
The ability of the virus to produce plaques was tested in
the different cell lines using 1% methylcellulose with and
without exogenous protease in the overlay.
Isolation of viral RNA and determination of genome
sequence
Viral genomic RNA was isolated from purified virus,
obtained from infected allantoic fluid by discontinuous
sucrose gradient centrifugation, using RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, USA). The genome sequencing was carried out
by using HN gene specific primer designed from the published HN gene sequence (GenBank accession no.
D14031). A set of consensus primers were designed for
gene start (GS), N and L gene by aligning genomes of published APMV-1, APMV-2, APMV-3 and APMV-6 sequences
and working consensus primers were mentioned in Table
1. Reverse transcription of viral genome was carried out by
GS consensus primer and primer HN4-1758F (Table 1). A
portion of the N gene (256 nt) was amplified by using
positive sense GS consensus primer and antisense N consensus primer. The F gene end and HN gene start region
was also amplified using primer GS consensus and HN481 antisense. The HN gene end and L gene start regions
were amplified by sense HN4-1758F primer and L consensus A (L-revA) antisense primer. By comparing these two

regions APMV-4 specific gene start and gene end (GE)
sequences were identified and APMV-4 specific sense
primer APMV-4 GS-F and antisense APMV-4 GE-R primers
were designed.
For subsequent amplification, reverse transcription was
carried out by APMV-4 GS-F primer. The PCR product
amplified by APMV-4 GS-F and APMV-4 GE-R primer was
cloned in pCR TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing
of these clones indicated PCR amplification by single
APMV-4 GS-F primer covering the P gene (1616 nt- 2671
nt) and L gene (8204 nt-9394 nt) due to presence of a
complimentary sequence in cDNA of APMV-4 at this locations. The sequence of remaining N gene was obtained by
amplification and sequencing using sense primer NP4-2F
and P gene antisense APMV4-P-65R primer. The sequence
of M and F genes was obtained by PCR amplification
using APMV-4 specific P gene sense (APMV4-P-550F) and
HN gene antisense (APMV4 HN59-81R AS) primer. The
complete sequence of the L gene was obtained by primer
walking using L gene specific forward primer and nonspecific reverse primers (NSP1-5) used in APMV-6 genome
sequencing [22] or L gene specific consensus antisense (LrevA, L-revB, L-revC and L-revD) primers designed by
APMVs genome sequence alignment (Table 1). For L gene
sequencing, 25 L gene specific sense primers were used
along with non specific reverse primers. The sequences of
the genome termini were determined by 3' and 5' terminus RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)
[20,21,23,24]. For 3' RACE, viral genomic RNA was
ligated to adapter1 (5'-GGTTTTGCGGTAAAGGTGGAAGAGAAG-3'), using T4 RNA ligase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The ligated RNA was
purified and reverse-transcribed, using a complimentary

primer. PCR amplification was carried out by sense primer
adapter 2 and antisense N gene-specific reverse primer
(NP4-192aaR -5'-GGCCTCCCCAGAGC CGTCAATGTTG3') and (NP4-210aaR – 5'-CCAATTGCAAACTGACGATTAAGC-3'). The 5' RACE was carried out by reverse transcription of genomic RNA using L gene specific sense
primer (4-PM14464F- 5'-GCGAACCTGGCAGATACATACAAAC-3'). The tailing of purified cDNAs with dCTP was
carried out by using terminal deoxynucleotide tranferase
(Invitrogen). The cDNAs were then amplified in separate
reactions, using an L gene-specific forward primer (4PM14574F- 5'-AGTAGTCCCCGCTTTCAAC -3') and an
anchored G antisense primer.
Sequencing of cloned DNAs or PCR-amplified products
were carried out in 3130xl genetic analyzer by using
BigDye terminator v 3.1 matrix standard kit and 3130xl
genetic analyzer data collection software v3.0 (Applied
Biosystem). The entire genome was sequenced at least
three times, and at least once from uncloned PCR product,
to ensure a consensus sequence.
P gene mRNA editing
DF1 cells were infected with APMV-4 virus (AF titer- 27
HAU) at dilution 10-3 per 25 cm2 flask and cells were harvested at 48 hr post infection for RNA isolation. The
mRNAs were isolated using mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The viral mRNAs were reverse transcribed using
oligo dT primer. The region flanking the putative P gene
RNA editing site was amplified by P gene specific primers
(APMV4-P50-74F5'-CGGCAATCATAGACTCCATACAGC-3' and APMV4-P536-558R- 5'-CAATGTCTCCG
GTTGCTTTGTCG-3'). The PCR products were cloned in
pCR TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The comparison for
the presence of P, V or W mRNAs were carried out by analyzing the sequences from positive clones.

Results

Sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis
Sequence similarity searches were conducted using the
basic length alignment search tool (BLAST) from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
DNA pair-wise alignment was done using MagAlign (clustalW) in a Lasergene6 software package. Evolutionary relationships were predicted from the multiple nucleotide
sequence alignment of whole genomes of the members of
the family Paramyxoviridae. The phylogenetic tree was generated by ClustalW program of MegAlign. The amino acid
sequence homology and divergence between the genera of
the subfamily Paramyxovirinae were also obtained by clustalW multiple alignment algorithms.

Growth characteristics of APMV-4
APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 produced a titer
of 27 – 29 HA units in 9 day-old embryonated SPF chicken
eggs at 4 days post-inoculation (p.i). The APMV-4 strain
duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 was able to grow in the MDBK,
BHK21, duck embryo, Vero, DF-1 and QT35 cell lines to a
titer of 24 HA units without the addition of exogenous
proteases, which is a requirement for efficient F protein
cleavage in many paramyxoviruses. The addition of exogenous protease did not give any difference in titer. The
typical cytopathic effect (CPE) observed was rounding
and detachment of cells. Multicycle growth curves documented virus release at 20, 28 and 36 hr after infections in
MDBK, Vero and DF-1 cells, respectively. The virus
reached to a maximum titer in cell culture supernatant at
36 hr p.i in MDBK and Vero cells, while 72 hr p.i in DF-1
cells. The virus did not form any visible plaques in all cell
lines tested with or without addition of proteases. Mean
death time of the APMV-4 strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75
in embryonated chicken eggs was zero, indicating its avirulent nature for chickens. Electron microscopy of partially
purified virus showed that the virus particles were enveloped, pleomorphic but mostly spherical in shape, with a
size ranging from 150–250 nm (data not shown).

of subfamily Paramyxovirinae [25,26]. The genomic organization of APMV-4 is similar to the other members of
genus Avulavirus in the order of 3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5' (Figure 1A). The genes were flanked by leader sequences at the
3' end and trailer sequences at the 5' end. The intergenic
sequences (IGS) between genes, which are not copied into
mRNAs, varied in length from 9 nt to 42 nt (Table 2). The
IGS between N/P, P/M, M/F, F/HN and HN/L are 9, 34,
14, 37 and 42 nt, respectively (Figure 1C). All the genes of
APMV-4 were positioned at hexamer phase 2 except F
gene that was at hexamer phase 6 (Table 2). The APMV-4
phasing pattern is unique among paramyxoviruses. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences from open reading
frames (ORFs) of all the genes revealed 91.09% coding
percentage, which is similar to the coding percentage of
other paramyxoviruses [27].
The 3' leader region of APMV-4 is 55 nt, a length that is
generally conserved among members of subfamily Paramyxovirinae [19]. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence
of the APMV-4 leader region with the leader sequences of
other paramyxoviruses showed 30–47% percent identity.
Surprisingly, the length of the APMV-4 5' trailer region is
17 nt, which is the shortest among the members of the
family Paramyxoviridae sequenced to date. The sequences
of the 3' leader and 5' trailer termini showed a high degree
of complimentarity (70.5% complimentarity) for the terminal 17 nt, suggesting the presence of conserved elements in the 3' promoter regions of the genome and
antigenome (Figure 1D). The gene-start signal of APMV-4
is 3'-UCCCACCCCUUCC-5' and is exactly conserved
among all genes except the N and F genes, in which there

are difference of 3 and 1 nt, respectively (Figure 1C). The
consensus gene end signal of APMV-4 is 3'-AAAUUAA (U)
5 -5', with difference of 3, 2 and 1 nt in the P, M and L
gene, respectively (Figure 1C).
The Nucleoprotein (N) gene
The APMV-4 N gene is 1551 nt and encodes a N protein of
457 amino acids. It contains a highly conserved sequence
motif, 322-FAPGNFPHMYSYAMG-336 (F-X4-Y-X3-α-S-αAMG, where X is any amino acid and α is any aromatic
amino acid), that corresponds to a motif previously identified in the central region of the N protein of other members of Paramyxovirinae and which has been implicated in
the self-assembly of N with RNA or with other N monomers [1]. Within the conserved motif of APMV-4 N protein, conserved amino acid Y327 is replaced by F327. The
N protein of APMV-4 has the highest amino acid identity
(51.2%) with that of APMV-3, whereas with other members of Avulavirus it shared 34–38% identity. It shared an
amino acid identity of 30–35% with Rubulavirus, 20–22%
with Respirovirus, 26–27% with Henipavirus, 21–22% with
Morbillivirus, and 22–25% with unclassified paramyxoviruses (Table 3).
The Phosphoprotein (P) gene and P/V/W editing
The P gene is 1364 nt long and encodes a predicted P protein of 393 amino acids. The predicted P protein contains
many potential phosphorylation sites with one tyrosine,
11 threonine, and 16 serine residues identified as possible
sites using Net Phos 2.0 software. The APMV-4 P protein
amino acid identity varies from 19–20% with members of
Avulavirus, 15–18% with Rubulavirus, 5–9% with Respirovirus, 12% with Henipavirus, 10–11% with Morbillivirus and
7–14% with other paramyxoviruses (Table 3).

The P gene contains a putative editing site 5'-AAAGGGGGG-3' (mRNA sense) at positions 442–450 nt of P
gene (positions 2057–2065 nt in the complete genome
sequence). The insertion of one non-templated G residue
would encode a 224 amino acid V protein of molecular
weight ~23.98 kDa. This V protein shares its N-terminal
135 amino acids with the P protein. The V-specific C-terminal domain contains seven invariantly spaced cysteine
residues and a histidine residue that are highly conserved
within paramyxoviruses (Figure 2A). Alternatively, insertion of two non-templated G residues would encode a
putative W protein (137 amino acids) comprising the Nterminal 135 amino acids of the P protein and C-terminal
two amino acids unique to the W protein.
In order to confirm P gene editing, total mRNA was isolated from APMV-4 infected DF-1 cells. RT- PCR amplification of sequences encompassing the P gene editing site
was performed. Sequencing of 28 cDNA clones showed
that 18 were unedited, 10 had single G insertion at the

indicated that 35% of the P gene mRNAs from infected
cells are edited to encode the V protein and that mRNA
encoding the predicted W protein was not detected.

The M gene of APMV-4 is 1293 nt long and encodes a protein of 369 amino acids. The protein is basic in nature
with a net charge +12.76 at pH 7.0 and contains 124
hydrophobic amino acid residues. The M protein had an
amino acid identity of 28–32% with Avulavirus, 23–24%
with Rubula virus, 20–22% with Respirovirus, 15% with
Henipavirus, 14–16% with Morbillivirus, and 14–22% with
other paramyxoviruses (Table 3).
The Fusion (F) gene
The F gene of APMV-4 is 1891 nt in length and encodes a
566 amino acid long F protein. Like other paramyxoviruses, the APMV-4 F protein is a type I integral membrane
protein with a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) anchor
domain that is predicted to span the host cell membrane.
The N-terminus of the F protein contains a signal
sequence that mediates translocation of the nascent protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is
predicted by the SignalP 3.0 server, to be cleaved between
residues 24 and 25 (VHS↓TD). The C terminal TM
domain (residues 510–530) anchors the protein in the
host cell membrane leaving a short cytoplasmic tail of 32
amino acid residues. In paramyxoviruses, the inactive F
protein (F0) becomes biologically active by getting
cleaved to F1 and F2 polypeptides by host cell proteases.
The F1 and F2 units are joined by disulfide bonding
between two cysteines predicted at position C80 of F2 and
C346 of F1 unit, according to the cysteine disulfide bonding state and connectivity predictor, DISULFIND [28].
However Iwata et al. [29] provided biochemical data
showing that the intra-subunit disulfide bond in Sendai
virus was between residue 70, the only residue in the F2
subunit, and 199, the most upstream cysteine in the F1

subunit. The corresponding residues in the F protein of
APMV-4 are C80 and C203. The putative F protein cleavage site is DIPQR↓F, corresponding to amino acid positions 116–121 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the APMV-4 F
protein putative cleavage site has a single basic amino acid
residue. This resembles the cleavage site of avirulent NDV
strains but in contrast to these avirulent strains, APMV-4
was not dependent on exogenous protease for virus
growth in cell culture. The N terminus of newly formed F1
subunit of APMV-4 has motif "ALAVAT" (residues 10–15)
relative to the F1 N terminus consensus motif "ALGVAT"
of most paramyxoviruses. The F protein is a glycoprotein
and prediction of potential glycosylation sites by NetNGlyc 1.0 server indicated the presence of one glycosylation
site at position 89 in F2 and two at positions 200 and 455
in the F1 protein. In paramyxoviruses, two hydrophobic
heptad repeats of the 4-3 pattern are present and are designated HRA and HRB in F1 peptide. Using a prediction
server LearnCoil-VMF, similar heptad repeats were
detected at position 142–193 as HRA and at position
469–500 as HRB. The deduced amino acid sequence of
the APMV-4 F protein has an amino acid identity of 32–
33% within Avulavirus, 25–27% within Rubulavirus, 20–
22% with Respirovirus, 22% with Henipavirus, 21–23%
with Morbillivirus and 20–25% with other paramyxoviruses (Table 3).
The Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) gene
The HN gene is 1914 nt long and encodes a HN protein of
569 amino acids. Like other paramyxovirus HN proteins,
the HN protein of APMV-4 is a type II integral membrane
protein that spans the membrane once at its N -terminus
and has a predicted hydrophobic signal anchor domain
spanning residues 28–46. The HN protein is a glycoprotein and five potential glycosylation sites were predicted at
positions 11, 58, 141, 317 and 448 by NetNGlyc 1.0
server. The position 11 is within the predicted signal
anchor region and unlikely to be utilized. A putative sialic
acid binding motif NRKSCS was found at position 229–

234. This protein is acidic in nature with a net charge of 5.696 at pH 7.0. The six conserved neuraminidase active
residues were identified at positions 169 (R), 398 (E), 413
(R), 501(R), 529 (Y), 550 (E) along with 11 conserved
cysteine residues (167, 181, 193, 233, 246, 339, 460, 466,
470, 534 and 545) corresponding to the globular head of
HN protein [30]. Comparison of amino acid homology
showed 30–32% identity within Avulavirus, 30–31% with
Rubulavirus, 21–22% with Respirovirus, 15% with Henipa-

The Large polymerase (L) gene
The L gene is 6834 nt long and encodes a L protein of
2211 amino acids. This protein has the highest amino
acid identity with APMV-3 (40.8%) as compared to other
members of genus Avulavirus (32–34%). Deduced amino
acid identity varies from 31–32% with Rubulavirus, 23–
24% with Respirovirus, 24% with Henipavirus, 24–25%
with Morbillivirus and 23–31% with other paramyxoviruses (Table 3). The L protein of paramyxoviruses contain
six (I-VI) highly conserved linear domains [31], of which
subdomain C of domain III is thought to be responsible
for transcriptional activity. Domain III is located at positions 644 to 835 and the conserved GDNQ motif of subdomain C is located at position 757–760. The four
subdomains (A-D) of domain III are aligned for conserved motifs in Figure 2C. Domain VI contains a highly
conserved putative ATP-binding motif K-X18-21-G-X-GX-G in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae [31,32]. A similar
conserved motif was found in APMV-4 at position 1767–
1793 as motif R-X21-GEGYG with replacement of lysine
(K) residue by another basic amino acid arginine (R).
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic relationship of APMV-4 with other
members of family Paramyxoviridae was obtained by comparing nucleotide sequences of entire genomes. The
resulting phylogenetic tree is depicted in Figure 3. The
phylogenetic trees were also obtained from percent divergence of deduced amino acid sequences of the N, P, M, F,

HN and L proteins (data not shown). In all representative
phylogenetic trees, the genera Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus,
Respirovirus, Henipavirus, Avulavirus, and unassigned paramyxoviruses were separated into distinct clusters. The
APMV-4 virus proteins were also clustered within genus
Avulavirus (data not shown). Within genus Avulavirus,
APMV-4 showed close evolutionary relationship with
APMV-3 and branched together in all the trees drawn
from both nucleotide and amino acid distance matrices.

Discussion
The APMVs are commonly isolated from a wide variety of
avian species and are represented by nine serological
types. The molecular characterization and pathogenicity
of these viruses are mostly unknown except for APMV-1.
It is important to determine the molecular characteristics
of these viruses. Here, we have characterized APMV-4

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/124

strain duck/Hong Kong/D3/75 and determined its complete genome sequence. APMV-4 strains have been isolated from ducks and geese during surveillance studies
[17]. We have determined the pathogenicity of APMV-4
strain using MDT test in embryonated chicken eggs. Our
result indicated its avirulent nature in chickens. Pathogenicity of APMV-4 in its natural host and in other avian
species is yet to be characterized by experimental infections. Experimental infection of chickens by APMV-4 had
shown to cause mild interstitial pneumonia and catarrhal
tracheitis indicating its disease potential [18]. The growth
curve studies in cell culture showed that APMV-4 was able
to grow in cells of different species of origin, indicating a
broad host range for the virus. The addition of exogenous
protease had no effect on the kinetics of virus growth,
yield, lack of ability to plaque, or formation of CPE.

The genome of APMV-4 is 15,054 nt long, which is larger
than APMV-2 (14,904 nt) [20] and smaller than APMV-3
(16,272 nt) [21]. The typical genome size of members of
family Paramyxoviridae is approximately 15,500 nt, but
can be considerably larger, as exemplified by HeV (18,234
nt) and BeV (19,212 nt) [1]. The length of the APMV-4
genome follows the "rule of six" that is a characteristic of
subfamily Paramyxovirinae [26] but not of the subfamily
Pneumovirinae [25]. The leader region of APMV-4 is 55 nt
in length, which is exactly conserved in length with most
other members of subfamily Paramyxovirinae [1]. In most
members of family Paramyxoviridae, the 5' trailer region is
25–60 nt long [33]. Interestingly, the trailer region of
APMV-4 is 17 nt in length, which is the shortest among
members of subfamily Paramyxovirinae whereas APMV-3
has the longest trailer sequence (707 nt) within the family
reported to date [21]. The terminal sequences of the 3'
leader and 5' trailer regions showed a high degree of complimentarity (70.5%), suggesting conserved elements in
the 3' promoter region of genome and antigenome. Identification of conserve gene start (3'-UCCCACCCCUUCC5') and gene end (3'-AAAUUAAUUUUU-5') sequences
revealed six genes in the order of 3'-N-P/V-M-F-HN-L-5'
within the genome with variable IGS. Six genes are also
found in all members of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae
with the exception of presence of the SH gene in APMV-6
of Avulavirus, SV5, MuV of Rubulavirus, J virus, BeV, and U
gene in FDLV [1,34]. The variable IGS of APMV-4 is similar to that of Rubula, Avula, Morbilli and Henipa viruses,
whereas, conserved trinucleotide GUU is typical of
Respirovirus [33]. The subunit hexamer phasing positions
for the start sites of the six genes and the P-gene editing
site, shown to be genus-specific within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae [32,35]. The hexamer phasing (2, 2, 2, 6, 2,
2) of APMV-4 showed differences with those of the other
APMVs [APMV-1(2,4,4,4,3,6), APMV-2 (2,2,2,3,3,3),
APMV-3 (2,5,5,2,2,1) and APMV-6 (2,2,2,2,2,4,4)]; suggesting its uniqueness within the members of genus Avulavirus.
The N protein core conserved motif of APMV-4 is F-X4-FX4-SYAMG and a similar motif has also been reported for
APMV-2 [20]. This is different from earlier motif F-X4-YX4-SYAMG that was reported for other members of Paramyxovirinae and is thought to be required for NP-NP interaction. The first amino acid residue F322, needed for
correct self-assembly is conserved in APMV-4 as reported
for other members of the family [36]. APMV-4 edits the P
gene from P to V in a manner similar to that employed by
Avulavirus, Respirovirus and Morbillivirus, but differs from
that of Rubulavirus, which edit their mRNA from V to P
[37]. Insertion of one non-templated G residue at the editing site produces the V protein with conserved histidine
and seven cysteine residues. The W protein produced by
mRNA editing with a double G residue insertion is either

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/124

absent or rare, as W mRNAs were not detected in cells
infected with APMV-4. The M protein is the most abundant structural protein in the virion, and it associates with
membranes and with the hydrophobic tails of viral F and
HN proteins [1]. The M protein of APMV-4 is rich in
hydrophobic amino acids sufficient for hydrophobic
interaction but lacks the membrane spanning domain.
The paramyxovirus F protein becomes biologically active
when the inactive precursor (F0) is cleaved into disulfidebonded F1–F2 subunits by host protease [1]. The F protein cleavage site is a well-characterized determinant of
NDV pathogenicity in chickens. Virulent NDV strains typically contain a polybasic cleavage site (R-X-K/R-R↓F) that
is recognized by furin-like intracellular proteases that are
ubiquitous in most cells. This provides for efficient cleavage in a wide range of tissues, making it possible for virulent strains to spread systemically. In contrast, avirulent
NDV strains typically have one or a few basic residues relative to the cleavage site and depend on secretory proteases (or, in cell culture, added protease) for cleavage.
This limits the replication of avirulent strains to the respiratory and enteric tracts where the secretory proteases are
found. However, the cleavage site of wild type SeV F protein (VPQSR↓F) has a monobasic residue (underlined)
that limits replication to the respiratory tract, but variants
with mutation from serine to proline (PR↓F) showed pantropism [38], in addition they do not require exogenous
protease for growth of virus. The APMV-4 cleavage site
(DIQPR↓F) is similar to efficiently cleaved PR↓F variant
of SeV in having a proline immediately upstream of the
single arginine residue and also does not require exogenous protease for growth in cell culture. However, the
APMV-2 F protein cleavage site (KPASR↓F) contains a
SR↓F site similar to that of wild type SeV but does not
require exogenous protease for cleavage activation [20]. At
the F protein cleavage site, (R↓F) is common in APMV-4,
APMV-2 and virulent APMV-1 (RRQKR↓F) irrespective of
basic amino acid numbers and does not need exogenous
protease for virus growth. In contrast, the F protein cleavage site (R↓L) is common in avirulent APMV-1 (GRQGR↓L), and APMV-3 (RPRGR↓L) irrespective of basic
amino acids and require secretory/exogenous proteases
for virus growth.
Like other paramyxoviruses, the HN protein of APMV-4 is
a type II integral protein with a conserved sialic acid binding motif (NRKSCS) and conserved neuraminidase active
site residues and cysteine residues corresponding to the
globular head of HN protein [30]. Alignment of the
APMV-4 L protein subdomain C of domain III (Figure 2C)
with other APMVs showed the conserved catalytic motif
GDNQ. Interestingly, in APMV-6, this conserved motif
contains a single amino acid difference (GENQ, difference
underlined). In the rabies virus L protein, mutation of

Page 9 of 11

Virology Journal 2008, 5:124

GDNQ to GENQ abolished polymerase activity in vitro
[39]. The APMV-4 L protein had a conserved ATP-binding
motif (R-X21-GEGYG) at domain VI, which is similar to
that of APMV-3 (R-X21-GEGSG), but for other members
of Paramyxovirinae this motif is K-X18-21-G-X-G-X-G
[31,32].
The phylogenetic analysis of APMV-4 with members of
the family Paramyxoviridae showed that APMV-4 was more
closely related to other APMV types than with other paramyxoviruses, supporting classification of APMVs in the
genus Avulavirus. APMV-4 showed close evolutionary relationship with APMV-3 both in nucleotide and amino acid
analysis. It will be interesting to study further the pathogenicity of APMV-4 in different avian species. The analysis
of additional strains of APMV-4 and the development of a
reverse genetic system will be helpful to study the molecular biology and pathogenesis of the virus.
