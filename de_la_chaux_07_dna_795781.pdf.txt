Abstract
Background: Insertions and deletions of DNA segments (indels) are together with substitutions
the major mutational processes that generate genetic variation. Here we focus on recent DNA
insertions and deletions in protein coding regions of the human genome to investigate selective
constraints on indels in protein evolution.
Results: Frequencies of inserted and deleted amino acids differ from background amino acid
frequencies in the human proteome. Small amino acids are overrepresented, while hydrophobic,
aliphatic and aromatic amino acids are strongly suppressed. Indels are found to be preferentially
located in protein regions that do not form important structural domains. Amino acid insertion and
deletion rates in genes associated with elementary biochemical reactions (e. g. catalytic activity,
ligase activity, electron transport, or catabolic process) are lower compared to those in other
genes and are therefore subject to stronger purifying selection.
Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that indels in human protein coding regions are subject to
distinct levels of selective pressure with regard to their structural impact on the amino acid
sequence, as well as to general properties of the genes they are located in. These findings confirm
that many commonly accepted characteristics of selective constraints for substitutions are also
valid for amino acid insertions and deletions.

Background
Molecular evolution is governed by the interplay of mutational processes which constantly give rise to the emergence of mutant alleles, and selective forces that influence
the dynamics of mutants within the population, either
leading to their fixation or loss. The decisive factor determining the probability of fixation of a new allele is its relative fitness compared to the wild type. If fitness
differences are weak, the dynamics of a mutant within the
population is essentially determined by genetic drift,

reflecting stochastic fluctuations that result from a finite
population size. In this regime of so called neutral evolution, the rate of fixation of new mutants in the population
resembles the rate at which mutants are generated in individuals. On the other hand, if fitness differences between
mutant and wild type are sufficiently large, stochastic fluctuations are overruled by deterministic selective forces
which can lead to accelerated fixation of a beneficial
mutant (positive selection), or its rapid removal as a consequence of strong selective constraints (purifying selecPage 1 of 12

tion). These considerations have been put on a
quantitative basis in the famous Kimura-Ohta theory of
population genetics for finite populations evolving by stochastic fluctuations and selection [2].
As an immediate consequence of this theory, reduction of
mutational rates in particular genomic regions compared
to presumably neutrally evolving regions are indicative for
selective constraints associated with the particular mutational processes. In our analysis, we use this approach to
investigate selective forces on a specific class of mutational processes, insertions and deletions of short DNA
segments in protein coding regions of the human
genome.
Together with nucleotide substitutions and genome rearrangements, DNA insertions and deletions (indels) are
the major mutational mechanisms to cause genetic variation. Comparative studies between human and chimp
revealed that indels between both species cover approximately 3–5% of the two genomes, and therefore clearly
outnumber the ~1.23% divergence resulting from single
nucleotide substitutions [3-6]. Indels in human protein
coding regions that occurred since the human-chimp split
were measured to be highly suppressed compared to intergenic and intronic indels [7,8]. This finding reflects strong
purifying selection in protein coding regions throughout
recent human evolution. Coding indels in the human lineage should therefore provide a promising class of mutational processes to study the characteristics of selective
constraints on protein coding regions in more detail.
We identified recent coding indels in the human lineage
from whole-genome multiple alignments of human,
chimp and rhesus. Insertions were explicitly distinguished
from deletions using rhesus as an out-group species. All
identified events were subjected to thorough quality filtering. The resulting set of reliable insertion and deletion
events was analyzed under several aspects that reflect
commonly regarded manifestations of selective constraints on protein evolution. Among them are variations
in insertion or deletion rates between different amino
acids, preferential occurrence of indels in specific secondary structure regions of proteins, and higher or lower rates
of indels in genes associated with particular molecular
functions, biological processes, or cellular components.
Our analysis indicates that indels in human protein coding regions are indeed subject to distinct levels of selective
pressure with regard to their structural impact on the
amino acid sequence, as well as to general properties of
the genes they are located in. The results extend several
known characteristics of selective constraints for amino
acid substitutions [9,10] and indels in other species [11]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/191

to coding indels in the human lineage, and substantiate
these findings by quantitative data.

Results and discussion
Insertion and deletion events
We investigated multiple alignments of the human, chimpanzee, and rhesus genomes to identify indels in the
human branch since its split from the common ancestor
with chimp. Using rhesus as an outgroup, indels were separated into insertions and deletions in the human branch
by means of maximum parsimony [12]. To reduce the
number of false-positive indels due to alignment or
sequencing errors we applied rigid quality filtering on
indels and their flanking regions (see methods). This way
we identified a set of 188,379 insertions and 329,433
deletions in a total of 2747,5 Mbp (85%) of the human
genome, which are covered by the multiple alignments.

In this set, 724 indels were detected to be located within
protein coding sequence segments according to the
Ensembl (version 41) annotation of the human genome
[13]. Coding indels hence account for only 0.14% of all
indels in our set. Comparison of this fraction with the
density of protein coding segments, which is about 1.2%
for the human genome [14], indicates that indels in coding regions are highly suppressed relative to those in the
genomic background. This can be expected since coding
indels will always change the amino acid sequence of the
translated protein (in contrast to nucleotide substitutions,
which can be synonymous). The effects of indels on the
protein sequence can range from insertions or deletions of
amino acids if indel lengths are multiples of 3 bp (nonframeshifting indels), up to complete non-functionalisation of the protein in case of frameshifting indels. Mutants
carrying frameshifting indels are consequently more likely
to be removed from the population by purifying selection
than those with frameshifting indels [11]. Indeed, it has
been found that the rates of frameshifting indels in protein coding regions are only about 5% of those in the
genomic background, while non-frameshifting indels still
occur at about 50% of their background rates [8].
Despite the approximately 10 times higher suppression of
frameshifting indels compared to non-frameshifting
indels, we still find 324 events (44.7%) in our set to be
frameshifting. This is due to the fact that length distributions of insertions and deletions rapidly decay with
increasing indel lengths [8]. For instance, on a genomewide average 1 bp indels occur approximately 10 times
more often than 3 bp indels. The number of 324 identified frameshifting indels is still unexpectedly high concerning their presumably profound impact on the
translated protein sequence. One possible scenario could
be that there is only a small number of wrongly predicted
Ensemble genes that give rise to many frameshifting

indels. Yet, this is not supported by our data; there is no
gene containing more than two indels of our set, and only
9 (13) genes have two non-frameshifting (frameshifting)
indels. Another likely origin of frameshifting indels could
be falsely annotated coding regions. To further investigate
this possibility, we checked the fraction of indels that are
located in experimentally validated RefSeq peptides [15].
While 259 of the 400 non-frameshifting indels (65%)
occured in exons of Ensembl transcripts that could be
mapped to RefSeq peptides with at least 99% target and
query identity, it was possible for only 108 of the 324
frameshifting indels (33%). This disproportionality is
indeed indicative for a significant fraction of frameshifting indels being located in erroneously predicted Ensembl
exons, but still a substantial number of events cannot be
explained this way. So far, we are not able to rate what
fraction of the remaining frameshifting events is biologically meaningful, and what are the contributions of alignment, sequencing, and other sources of error. In principle,
it is also possible that a frameshift caused by one indel can
be compensated by a second frameshifting indel. If both
events occur within a close distance, changes in the amino
acid sequence can be minimized.
In contrast to frameshifting indels, which are generally
"global" events causing changes on a protein scale, our
analysis focuses on the contribution of indels to protein
evolution on a "local" scale, and we therefore restricted
our set to the 151 insertions and 249 deletions which are
non-frameshifting. Their length distribution is shown in
Figure 1; it is strongly peaked at 3 bp and rapidly decays
for larger indel lengths. A table containing chromosomal
position, length, and inserted/deleted sequence of all
identified non-frameshifting indels in coding regions is
provided online [1].
Conservative and non-conservative indel events
Insertions and deletions can occur between two codons
(in phase 0), or after the first or second nucleotide of a
codon (in phase 1 and 2, respectively). Often, the exact
phase of an indel cannot be reconstructed unambiguously
on the sole basis of a multiple alignment. For instance, if
an indel has occurred in a local repeat structure, the alignment algorithm has multiple possibilities to place the gap
without changing the overall score of the alignment (see
Figure 2a).

On the level of the translated amino acid sequence the different phases are not entirely equivalent: Non-frameshifting indels in phase 0 always introduce or delete complete
codons of the protein coding sequence without affecting
adjacent amino acids (conservative events). Indels in
phase 1 or 2 can in addition to the inserted/deleted amino
acids also change an adjacent amino acid (non-conservative events). Notice that phase 1 and 2 indels can also be

conservative depending on the nature of the inserted or
deleted sequence. In contrast to its exact phase, the conservative or non-conservative nature of an indel can
unambiguously be determined from the multiple alignment. The classification into non-conservative and conservative events partitions indels into events causing an
additional amino acid substitutions and those without. It
is therefore a reasonable classification of indels whenever
one is interested in their actual effect on the protein
sequence.
In our set, we find non-conservative insertions and deletions to be strongly suppressed; they make up only 3% (5
events) of all insertions and 4% (10 events) of all deletions (Figure 2b). Indels in protein coding regions are
hence predominantly of conservative nature, i. e. they
occur in a way that minimizes the number of changed
amino acids.
There are two hypothesis capable of explaining the strong
bias towards conservative indel events: The first is a mechanistic explanation based on the observation that the
majority of DNA insertions on short length scales are actually tandem duplications of adjacent sequence segments
and that deletions also occur frequently in preexisting tandem duplicates [8,16]. These signatures are also found
among the insertions and deletions in our set: 134 of 151
insertions (89%) are tandem duplications, 149 of 249
deletions (60%) removed one copy of a preexisting tandemly repeated motif. Non-frameshifting tandem duplication insertions and deletions of a repeated motif are
always conservative events, irrespective of the phase they
occur in. The measured overrepresentation of conservative

Figure 2
Conservative and non-conservative indel events
Conservative and non-conservative indel events. a) Examples of 3 bp insertions in a protein coding region. An insertion
can either occur between two codons (phase 0), between the first and second nucleotide of a codon (phase 1), or between the
second and third nucleotide (phase 2). Phase 1 and 2 insertions can thereby be divided into conservative events, which only
insert a new amino acid without changing the translated amino acid of the ancestral codon (phase 1- and 2-), or non-conservative events that additionally change it (phase 1+, 2+). Insertions in phase 0 are always conservative. In a similar manner deletions can be partitioned into the 5 different categories (reversing time arrows in the figure yields the corresponding examples).
Notice that the indel in phase 1-could have also been assigned as a phase 0 or phase 2 indel depending on where the alignment
algorithm prefers to place the gap (all three gap placements have equal numbers of matches and gaps and therefore equal alignment scores). b) Measured frequencies of non-conservative insertion and deletion events in observed data and simulations.

indel events could hence be solely caused by the characteristics of the underlying molecular processes that generate
indels.
The second hypothesis presumes that in addition to the
previous "selectively neutral" explanation at least part of
the observed strong bias may reflect a higher amount of
purifying selection associated with non-conservative
indels due to their larger number of effective changes in
the protein sequence compared with conservative events.
To test whether the duplication mechanism can fully suffice to explain the observed underrepresentation of nonconservative indels we conducted a simulation study.
Indels were thereby randomly placed in a test set of protein coding regions of the human genome. For each event
the length of the simulated indel was drawn from the
observed distribution of indel lengths in coding regions
(Figure 1). As the crucial feature of our simulation we further assured that indels were generated with realistic
duplication characteristics as observed on the genomewide scale (see methods).
The measured frequencies of non-conservative events in
our simulation are shown in Figure 2b. In comparison to
the original set we obtained substantially higher frequencies of non-conservative events in the simulation set

(insertions: 6%, deletions: 18%). For deletions, we can
clearly reject the hypothesis that the small frequency of
non-conservative events in our observed set is simply a
result of the preferential deletion of copies within preexisting duplicates (p < 10-9, Fishers Exact Test). The corresponding statement is less significant for insertions (p <
0.3) due to the small number of predicted non-conservative events in our set (6%, amounting to 9 events in our
set of 151 insertions). We actually observed 5 events. We
conclude from this analysis that non-conservative indels
are highly suppressed in protein coding regions. This can
for a large part be explained by inherent duplication features of indels. However, non-conservative deletions are
in addition subject to a significantly larger amount of
purifying selection compared to non-conservative events,
and a similar statement is likely to be true also for insertions.
Inserted and deleted amino acids
To investigate whether indels in protein coding regions
preferentially induce insertions or deletions of specific
amino acids, we counted the distributions of inserted and
deleted amino acids in our set (see methods). These distributions were compared to the overall abundance of
amino acids in proteins of the human genome. As shown
in Figure 3a, both distributions are significantly different

from the background abundance (p < 10-14 for insertions,
p < 10-10 for deletions, Chi Square Test).
In particular, we found that glycine (p < 0.06, all p-values
are corrected for multiple testing) and alanine (p < 0.02)
were inserted more often than expected under the
assumption that insertion frequencies of different amino
acids follow the average distribution of amino acid frequencies in all coding regions of the human genome. Glycine is the smallest among all proteinogenic amino acids,
it can therefore be located in parts of the protein that are
structurally forbidden to all other amino acids (e. g. tight
turns). Alanine is the second smallest amino acid, it is very
non-reactive and thus rarely involved directly in protein
function [17]. Among deletions, glutamic acid is significantly overrepresented (p < 0.06). It is negatively charged
and polar, and prefers to be located on the surface of proteins.
On the other hand, for insertions and deletions phenylalanine and tyrosine (both p < 0.003), for insertions isoleucine (p < 10-4), lysine (p < 0.03) and valine (p < 0.0006),

and for deletions asparginine, leucine and tryptophan (all
p < 0.03) are significantly underrepresented among indels.
Most of these amino acids prefer to be buried within protein hydrophobic cores (phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, leucine and tryptophan). Leucine is
preferentially located in alpha helices, isoleucine and
valine are often found in beta sheets. Asparginine and
lysine predominantly reside on the surfaces of proteins
[17]. Generally, all significantly underrepresented amino
acids are restricted to particular positions in the protein
structure. Insertions and deletions of these amino acids
are likely to cause major changes in protein structure, stability and function, and are therefore strongly suppressed
by purifying selection.
In order to obtain a more general survey of the underlying
characteristics that dispose amino acids to be over- or
underrepresented in our set, we grouped them with
respect to their physio-chemical properties. Results are
shown in Figure 3b. This analysis revealed that indeed
small and tiny amino acids are preferentially inserted (p <
10-4) and tiny amino acids deleted (p < 0.05), whereas

aliphatic and aromatic amino acids occur less often in
inserted (p < 10-6) and hydrophobic (p < 0.002), aliphatic
and aromatic (p < 10-5) amino acids in deleted sequence
segments compared to their average abundance in protein
coding regions.
Insertions and deletions in protein coding regions primarily involve amino acids that have a minor impact on the
structure and function of the protein. In contrast, amino
acids which are preferentially located in structurally
important regions of the protein are highly suppressed.
These results agree with the observed dependence of
amino acid substitution rates on their local environment
within the protein derived from protein alignments
[10,18,19]. For example, amino acids buried in protein
cores have been found to be far more conserved than
those at surface positions [9].
Structural preferences of indels
Insertion and deletion rates of amino acids depend on the
structural region of the protein they are preferentially
located in, as pointed out by the previous analysis. To
investigate whether this effect can also directly be measured on the structural level, we retrieved secondary structure information for protein sequences affected by indels
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [20].

Secondary structure information could be obtained for
343 indels in our set (see methods). In Figure 4 we show
the distribution of structural features (alpha helix, beta
sheet, turn, no structure) among inserted and deleted coding sequence segments in comparison to the background
abundance of these features in the analyzed proteins. The
analysis corroborates our presumption that coding indels
in human preferentially occur in protein regions lacking
important secondary structure features, as has already
been reported for indels derived from alignments of protein families [18] and coding indels in rodents [11]. In
contrast, indels in alpha helices are significantly suppressed (p < 0.05). This is consistent with the fact that
alpha-helices are the most robust secondary structures.
For instance, they often form the skeleton of the protein.
Amino acid insertions or deletions in protein regions that
are supposed to form a alpha helix can have a great impact
on the helical structure, since they are likely to destroy the
internal periodicity of the helix. The observed suppression
of indels in these regions is therefore likely to reflect the
influence of purifying selection.
Strength of selection in indel containing genes
The strong suppression of frameshifting indels, the low
ratio of non-conservative indel events in our indel phase
analysis, or the underrepresentation of events which presumably affect protein structure, all these findings indicate that indels in protein coding regions are exposed to a

substantial amount of selective pressure. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that indels preferably occur in genes
where overall selection strength is lower compared to
other genes.
To verify this presumption we analyzed the distribution of
dN/dS ratios for indel containing genes in comparison to
the background distribution of dN/dS values in all human
genes. The ratio of non-synonymous substitution rate
(dN) to synonymous substitution rate (dS) is a widelyused method to investigate the general strength of selection in protein coding regions. A low ratio dN/dS << 1
indicates strong purifying selection, while genes with dN/
dS ≈ 1 are usually considered to evolve under approximate
selective neutrality [21]. In order to obtain meaningful
estimates of dN and dS on the scale of individual genes by
cross-species comparison, the divergence between the
analyzed species should not be too low. dN/dS values
were therefore calculated on the basis of human-mouse
alignments, which could be obtained for a total of 15550
orthologous genes (see methods).
In Figure 5 we show the measured distributions of dN/dS
values for all genes, compared to the subsets of genes that
contain at least one coding insertion/deletion event. As
expected, coding indels indeed occur preferentially in
genes evolving under lower levels of selective pressure,
indicated by higher dN/dS values.

Distribution of dN/dS values among indel containing genes
Distribution of dN/dS values among indel containing
genes. The histograms show the measured distributions of
gene frequencies with dN/dS values in binned intervals of
length 0.1, starting from 0. Gene frequencies are generally
peaked in the interval 0 ≤ dN/dS ≤ 0.1 and decay for larger
dN/dS values, indicating strong purifying selection on protein
coding regions throughout evolution. However, the distributions of the subsets of genes that contain at least one insertion/deletion decay slower compared to the background
distribution of all analyzed genes.

We are aware of the fact that this approach determines the
strength of selection on a considerably larger time-scale
compared to the period where indels in our set were generated. However, the regime of strong purifying selection
we are interested in, typically denotes genes associated
with important biological functions. Such genes are often
conserved over long evolutionary periods, and selective
constraints on them are unlikely to have changed rapidly
throughout recent evolution.
Gene ontology analysis
To identify possible correlations between rates of coding
indels and categories of proteins that are associated with
particular molecular functions, biological processes, or
cellular components, a Gene Ontology (GO) [22] analysis
was performed among a broad set of 63 GO slim categories.

The standard method to investigate whether a certain GO
category is over- or underrepresented in a particular subset
of genes (e. g. overexpressed genes in a microarray analysis) is to compare the fraction of genes annotated by that
GO category in the subset with the fraction of annotated
genes in the analyzed background set. However, when
analyzing indels, such an approach can be misleading if
certain GO categories are systematically biased towards
shorter or longer genes, since the probability of long genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/191

to contain an indel is higher than for short genes. In order
to eliminate such possible cross-correlation we directly
measured the rates of coding indels in events per coding
sequence length for all genes that could be mapped to our
63 GO slim categories (see methods). These rates were
then compared to the average rate of coding indels in all
16,257 genes of the human genome with available GO
annotation. 328 of these genes contain at least one indel
of our set. The average rate of coding indels in all annotated genes was calculated to be 1 event per 75 kbp of coding sequence. All measured rates are shown in Figure 6.
The most interesting result is that we found 6 categories in
the ontologies molecular function and biological process
which are significantly underrepresented (after applying a
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing): catalytic activity (p < 0.04), ligase activity (p < 0.0003), electron transport (p < 0.003), amino acid and derivative metabolic
process (p < 10-5), transport (p < 0.007), catabolic process
(p < 0.0002). All of them are related to biochemical reactions. Suppression of indels in genes associated with these
categories may be explained by the fact that biochemical
reactions are very specific and are therefore highly conserved throughout evolution.
Chen et al. reported an overrepresentation of indels in
genes associated with transcription regulatory activity [7].
We also measure 1.7 fold higher indel rates in this set of
genes. However, we find that this overrepresentation is
statistically not significant (p < 0.5) after correcting for
multiple testing. The slight overrepresentation may actually result from the known enrichment of tandem repetitive sequences in transcription factors [23], which are
therefore more prone to frequent insertions and deletions.
The category transcription regulatory activity characterizes
genes that are related to the regulation of other genes. The
measured higher indel rates in this class – although not
significant after a conservative Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing – conforms well with the hypothesis that
many changes between human and chimp took not only
place on the amino acid level, but also on the regulatory
level [24-26]. Alongside amino acid substitutions, DNA
indels in protein coding regions of regulatory genes could
thereby also play an important role among the mutational
processes on sequence level that drive such evolutionary
changes.
In the ontology cellular component all categories besides
nucleus are suppressed. Especially genes in categories
related to extracellular components have lower indel
rates. However, this suppression is only marginally significant (p < 0.06).

average indel rate in all protein coding regions with available GO annotation. We assumed that errors of indel rates are given
by Δri = Ni / Li , where Ni is the overall number of indels in GO slim category i, and Li is the total length of all protein coding
regions assigned to that category. For GO slim categories with Ni = 0 errors were obtained by setting Ni = 1. The category
nucleic acid metabolic process combines nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic processes.

Conclusion
In this study, we investigated recent DNA insertions and
deletions in protein coding regions of the human
genome. Mutational processes of this type were found to
occur at substantially lower rates compared to indel
events on a genome-wide average, indicating strong purifying selection. To enlighten particular selective constraints on coding indels in more detail, their
characteristics were examined from miscellaneous angles.
DNA indels in coding sequence lead to insertions or deletions of amino acids in the translated proteins. Yet, frequencies of inserted and deleted amino acids do not
resemble background amino acid frequencies in the

human proteome. In particular, we found small amino
acids to be preferentially inserted and deleted, while
indels involving hydrophobic, aliphatic and aromatic
amino acids are underrepresented. Indel rate variations
could also be measured between different secondary
structure regions of proteins. Amino acid insertions and
deletions tend to occur in protein regions that do not
form important structural domains, and are significantly
underrepresented in alpha helices. We further found that
indel rates in genes related to elementary biochemical
reactions are subject to substantially stronger purifying
selection.

Identifying selection in evolution of human proteins has
drawn a considerable amount of attention since the
advent of molecular sequence data. Most studies have
thereby focused on the effects of amino acid substitutions
[27]. With the increasing availability of single nucleotide
polymorphism data, the scope has nowadays been
extended to the search for events ascribed to positive selection [21,25,28]. However, one has to keep in mind that
the emergence of beneficial mutants is certainly rare compared to deleterious ones. The vast majority of newly arising alleles in protein coding regions is subject to strong
selective constraints. Our findings corroborate that many
commonly accepted characteristics of these constraints for
substitutions do also apply to amino acid insertions and
deletions.

Methods
Identifying insertions and deletions
Our multiple human-chimp-rhesus alignments were
obtained from the Ensembl database (version 41, October
2006) [13]. They are based on the releases
homo_sapiens_core_41_36c, pan_troglodytes_core_41_
21 and macaca_mulatta_core_41_10a, and were generated by MLAGAN [29]. Gaps in these alignments correspond to insertion or deletion events along branches of
the phylogenetic tree ((human, chimp), rhesus). We
define a situation as an insertion in the human lineage
since speciation from the common ancestor with chimp if
the alignment has a segment of gaps in the chimp and rhesus sequences, while no gaps are present in the corresponding segment of the human sequence. Additionally,
we require the gap segments in the chimp and rhesus
sequences to start and end at the same position (case I in
Figure 7). This is necessary since alignment regions with
not exactly overlapping gap segments in chimp and rhesus
cannot be explained by only one insertion event. They
require at least two indel events and it is not possible to
assign the events to particular branches of the phylogenetic tree in an unambiguous manner (see e. g. case I* in
Figure 7). Accordingly, we define an event as a deletion in
the human lineage since speciation from the common
ancestor with chimp if the multiple alignment has a segment of gaps in the human sequence where no gaps are
present in the chimp and rhesus sequences (case D in Figure 7). The ancestral deleted sequence is approximated by
the present chimp sequence.

We applied successive filtering steps to further increase the
quality of our set. The 10 bp upstream and downstream
flanking regions of an identified insertion or deletion in
the three species alignment were not allowed to contain
more than one mismatch or gap. We also added quality
constraints on the indel sequence itself. For an insertion,
the number of not known nucleotides (N's) and for deletions the number of mismatches in the corresponding

Figure 7
Identifying insertion and deletion events
Identifying insertion and deletion events. The figure
shows an exemplary multiple alignment of orthologous
sequence segments in human, chimp and rhesus. The gap
containing regions I and D can unambiguously be explained
by a single insertion (I) or deletion (D) event in the human
lineage since its speciation from the common ancestor with
chimp. In contrast, region I* has non-overlapping gaps in
chimp and rhesus and therefore requires at least two indel
events. These scenarios are always ambiguous. For instance,
I* can be explained by an insertion in human and a deletion in
chimp, but also by a deletion in chimp and a deletion in rhesus.

pairwise alignments of chimp and rhesus had to be less
than 10% of the indel length.
We classified an indel to be coding if it is located within a
protein coding region of an exon according to Ensembl
version 41. Long insertions and deletions that are not
entirely located within a preexisting exon (or insertions,
which additionally insert intronic segments) were
excluded from our analysis. As starting position of an
indel we took the position of the first inserted nucleotide
for an insertions and the position of the first changed
nucleotide for a deletion.
P-value calculations and corrections for multiple testing
P-values for significance tests were calculated using p =

erfc(z/ 2 ). The z-scores z measure the differences
between observed values and background values in standard deviations. To correct p-values for multiple testing a
Bonferroni correction was applied whenever more than
one test was performed: All p-values were multiplied by
the number of tests in this category.
Simulation of indel events in coding regions
Two test sequences were generated, one by concatenating
the protein coding nucleotide sequences of all genes containing an insertion from our set, the other by concatenating the corresponding sequences for all deletions from
our set. Insertion events were simulated on the first test
sequence, deletions on the second test sequence, according to the following procedure:

1. The length l of the insertion (deletion) was drawn from
the length distribution of insertions (deletions) in our set
(Figure 1). For simplicity, indel length was restricted to 21
bps.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:191

2. According to the genome-wide frequency of tandem
duplication insertions (deletions from tandem duplicates) among all insertions (deletions) for the particular
indel length l (numbers taken from [8]), it was chosen
whether the insertion (deletion) should be a tandem
duplication (deletion from a preexisting tandem duplicate), or not.
3. A random position p in the test sequence was selected.
4. In case of a tandem duplication insertion, the sequence
segment of length l starting at position p in the test
sequence was duplicated and inserted again at position p.
In case of an insertion that was not chosen to generate a
tandem duplication, a sequence segment of length l was
generated by independently drawing each nucleotide
from the distribution of base frequencies in the test
sequence. The randomly generated segment was then
inserted at position p. In case of a deletion it was checked
whether deleting the l nucleotide long sequence segment
starting at position p would effectively constitute a deletion of one copy of a preexisting tandem duplicate, or not.
If the result coincided with the scenario chosen for the
particular deletion, the segment was deleted. Otherwise
the procedure was reiterated from 3 until a suitable position p was found.
5. It was checked whether the resulting insertion (deletion) event was conservative or not.
Succeeding simulation runs were always performed on the
original test sequences meaning that the generated indel
of a previous run was not incorporated in the test
sequence for the next run. The frequency of non-conservative events were calculated on the basis of 106 simulation
runs for insertions and the same number of runs for deletions.
Inserted and deleted amino acids
Amino acid sequences of insertions were derived by translating all codons that overlap with the inserted DNA segments. In case of deletions, the deleted segments were reinserted in the human sequence and all overlapping
codons were translated. Notice that by this procedure we
also take into account only partially affected amino acids
at the boundaries of phase 1 and 2 indels. Frequencies of
the different amino acids were obtained by counting their
occurrences in the inserted/deleted amino acid sequences,
divided by the overall number of all amino acids in
inserted/deleted sequences.

We assigned amino acids to 10 overlapping groups
according to their physio-chemical properties: hydrophobic, aliphatic, aromatic, small, tiny, proline, polar,
charged, positive and negative [30]. The frequency of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/191

inserted/deleted amino acids in each group was calculated
by summing up the number of all inserted/deleted amino
acids assigned to that group, divided by the overall
number of all inserted/deleted amino acids.
For the background model, we measured the frequencies
of amino acids in all protein coding regions of the human
genome which are annotated by Ensembl. P-values for
amino acid distributions were multiplied by a factor 20
and for the group distribution by a factor 10 to correct for
multiple testing.
Retrieving protein secondary structure
For each indel in our set the sequence of its encompassing
protein was blasted against the PDB using blastp from the
NCBI QBlast system with default parameters to obtain
information on the secondary structure of the protein. In
case of a deletion, we blasted the reconstructed ancestral
sequence. If more than one hit was reported from the
PDB, we chose the first found PDB id which overlaps with
the whole indel. The PDB assigns the structural features
helix, sheet, turn, or no structure to every amino acid position of the protein. For each of the four structural features
we counted the number of indels in our set that reside in
a protein region annotated by the structure. If an indel
covers more than one structural feature, we weighted each
feature by the relative fraction of the length it covers of the
indel. For example, a 9 bp long indel where the first 3 bp
reside in a protein region annotated as turn, while the last
6 bp are annotated as no structure, adds 1/3 to feature
"turn" and 2/3 to feature "no structure". The obtained
counts for each structural feature were then divided by the
number of all inserted/deleted amino acids with available
structural annotation.

For the background model, we added for each structural
feature the number of amino acids annotated with the feature in all analyzed PDB sequence segments that overlap
with the blasted protein sequence, and divided it by the
overall length of these segments. As 4 structural categories
were investigated all p-values were multiplied by a factor
4 to correct for multiple testing.
Estimating dN/dS values from human-mouse alignments
Amino acid sequences and the corresponding nucleotide
alignments for orthologous genes in human and mouse
were retrieved from Ensembl. Values for dS and dN in
these alignments were computed with codeml (from
PAML, v3.15 [31]) assuming the F3×4 codon frequency
model.
Measuring indel rates in GO slim categories
All human genes in Ensembl with available GO annotation were mapped to their corresponding GO slim categories using goaslim.map [32]. Notice that a gene might be

attributed to several GO slim categories. For all genes in a
particular GO slim category we then counted all coding
indels in our set which are located within these genes, and
divided this number by the total length of all protein coding regions in the category. This way we retrieved categoryspecific indel rates in events per bp. For the average rate we
counted the number of coding indels in all genes that are
annotated with GO terms and divided this number by the
total length of coding regions in all annotated genes.
The main Gene ontologies cellular component, molecular
function, and biological process are independent from
each other. Within one group p-values were multiplied by
factors 12, 29, and 22, in order, to correct for multiple
testing.
