Abstract
Background: Giardia intestinalis is a parasitic protozoan and major cause of diarrhoeal disease. Disease transmission is
dependent on the ability of the parasite to differentiate back and forth between an intestine-colonising trophozoite and
an environmentally-resistant infective cyst. Our current understanding of the intracellular signalling mechanisms that
regulate parasite replication and differentiation is limited, yet such information could suggest new methods of disease
control. Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signalling pathways have a central involvement in many vital eukaryotic
processes, such as regulation of cell growth, intracellular membrane trafficking and cell motility. Here we present
evidence for the existence of functional PI3K intracellular signalling pathways in G. intestinalis.
Results: We have identified and characterised two genes, Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2, which encode putative PI3Ks. Both genes
are expressed in trophozoites and encysting cells, suggesting a possible role of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 in regulating giardial
growth and differentiation. Extensive nucleotide and amino acid sequence characterisation predicts that both encoded
PI3Ks are functional as indicated by the presence of highly conserved structural domains and essential catalytic residues.
The inhibitory effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on trophozoite proliferation also supports their functionality.
Phylogenetic analysis supports the identity of GiPI3K1 as a Class I isoform and GiPI3K2 as a Class III isoform. In addition,
giardial genes encoding putative homologues of phosphoinositide-metabolising enzymes such as PTEN, MTM, PIPkin and
PI 5-phosphatase as well as downstream effectors with phosphoinositide-binding domains have been identified, placing
GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 in a broader signalling context. Compared with twenty-six PI3Ks from other organisms, GiPI3K1
and GiPI3K2 are unique in that they contain large insertions within their highly conserved kinase domains. The function
of these insertions is unknown; however we show here that they are not intron-derived and would probably not hinder
substrate binding. These insertions may represent a plausible drug target.
Conclusion: G. intestinalis encodes and expresses two putative PI3Ks, at least one of which appears to be required during
normal parasite proliferation. The identification of Class I and Class III but not Class II isoforms suggests that both
extracellularly-initiated signalling (Class I-regulated) and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Class III-regulated) might be
controlled by PI3Ks in G. intestinalis. The presence of genes encoding putative homologues of phosphoinositidemetabolising enzymes and downstream effectors in the G. intestinalis genome further suggests that the overall
architecture of PI3K signalling may be comparable with pathways present in other better-studied organisms.

Background
The parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis (syn. lamblia,
duodenalis) is a common cause of water-borne diarrhoeal
disease, particularly in the developing world. G. intestinalis's infective ingenuity stems from its ability to switch
between two morphologically distinct states: an externally
protected, inert cyst and a flagellated colonizing trophozoite that can attach to host cells in the small intestine.
This attachment leads to the unpleasant symptoms associated with giardiasis [1]. Differentiation of G. intestinalis
has been studied extensively in terms of analysing the
morphological events associated with encystation (trophozoite-to-cyst) and excystation (cyst-to-trophozoite)
[1], yet little is known about the molecular circuitry that
regulates differentiation. Although limited in their
number, a few studies have given some crucial insights
into the intracellular signalling pathways that may allow
the organism to respond to environmental cues. For
instance, protein kinase A and cyclic-AMP, in addition to
calcium and calmodulin have been shown to play an
important role in trophozoite motility and initiation of
excystation [2-4] while catalytically active homologs of
the intracellular signalling mitogen-activated protein
kinase family in G. intestinalis appear to be important for
growth and encystation [5]. The potential diversity of
intracellular signalling mechanisms in G. intestinalis is
illustrated by the recent characterisation of a giardial protein kinase B-like molecule [6] and by the demonstration
that cholesterol starvation in vitro induces Giardia encystation [7]. The latter suggests a role for lipids and lipid signalling in parasite differentiation.
Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is a basic building block for
intracellular inositol lipids in eukaryotic cells and is
present in trace amounts in G. intestinalis trophozoites
and encysting cells cultured in vitro [8]. It has been shown
that G. intestinalis uses inositol headgroup exchange
enzymes to convert free inositol to PtdIns [9]. In Dictyostelium discoideum, yeast and mammalian cells, PtdIns can
be reversibly phosphorylated at the D-3 position of its
inositol ring by phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and
at other positions by distinct kinases, to form phosphorylated PtdIns; PtdIns and its phosphorylated derivatives
are collectively referred to as phosphoinositides (PIs)
[10]. Although PIs constitute a minor fraction of total cellular lipids in eukaryotic cells, they are biologically important as second messengers and their levels must be
accurately regulated [11].
Although PtdIns has been detected in Giardia [8] it is
unclear whether this parasite utilises PI3K-mediated intracellular signalling mechanisms to regulate its growth and
differentiation. PI3K signalling is associated with many
eukaryotic events such as regulation of cell growth, intracellular membrane trafficking and cell motility [12], each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/45

of which is important in the lifecycle of G. intestinalis.
PI3K signalling has been extensively characterised in
mammals, yeast and most notably in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, where several PI3Ks are known to be
important for normal cell growth, multicellular development, aggregation and chemotaxis [13,14].
PI3Ks become activated in response to numerous agonists
and the resulting PIs initiate the recruitment of signalling
proteins to membranes – specifically by way of PI-binding
domains present on the proteins. In this way, membrane
signals can be spatially restricted and highly controlled. A
well-characterised example of a PI-binding signalling protein is protein kinase B (PKB), which, when membranerecruited by PI, is only then able to phosphorylate specific
substrates in order to regulate apoptosis, protein synthesis, cell growth and cell cycling [12]. To date, eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified and they comprise
three classes of isozymes on the basis of sequence similarity and substrate preference in vivo [11]. Class I PI3Ks
phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2,
Class II PI3Ks phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P but
not PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Class III PI3Ks (sometimes referred
to as Vps34, after the isoform detected in yeast [15]) exclusively phosphorylate PtdIns. All PI3Ks characterised to
date have a multi-domain structure, comprising a highly
conserved two-lobed catalytic kinase domain at their Cterminus, a PIK domain which acts as a scaffold around
which the enzyme is folded and a C2 or C2-like domain
that in other proteins binds phospholipids and so may be
involved in substrate targeting. The PI3Ks also have
domains that mediate enzyme activation and promote
enzyme interaction with the plasma membrane, namely
the Ras Binding Domains (RBDs) common to Class I and
II isoforms, and adaptor protein binding domains [11].
Using mammalian and yeast PI3K protein sequences as
queries, we searched the G. intestinalis genome [16] to
identify putative molecular homologues. Here, we report
on the characterisation of two giardial genes, which we
term Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2, encoding putative PI3Ks. The
presence of well conserved structural PI3K domains in
these sequences and the detection of specific transcripts
for both genes in trophozoites and encysting cells suggest
that GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 are functional enzymes. Functionality of at least one of the putative PI3Ks is experimentally demonstrated by the specific and significant
inhibitory effect of a PI3K inhibitor on trophozoite proliferation. We further substantiate the existence of PI3K signalling in G. intestinalis by identifying additional
homologs which may be important for the metabolism
and downstream effects of the giardial PI3K enzymatic
products.

Results
Identification and sequence characterisation of two
putative G. intestinalis PI3K genes
Using catalytic domain sequences of Class I, II and III
PI3Ks as query sequences, we carried out sequence similarity searches to identify Giardia genes encoding putative
PI3Ks. Our searches returned several open reading frames,
two of which demonstrated similarity to PI3K genes
(Table 1) and were therefore called Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2.
The predicted open reading frames of Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2
are 6,468 bp and 4,917 bp in length respectively. Gipi3k1
is predicted to encode a 2,155 amino acid protein [GenPept: EAA41385] with a molecular mass of 242 kDa,
whilst Gipi3k2 is predicted to encode a 1,638 amino acid
protein [GenPept: EAA40923] with a molecular mass of
183 kDa. We independently confirmed the entire Gipi3k1
sequence given by the G. intestinalis genome project, (see
Methods section) and no differences in sequence were
observed.

PI3K – characteristic domains were predicted to be present
and in the typical conformation for both GiPI3K1 and
GiPI3K2 (Figure 1). Ubiquitin/RBD-like, C2, PIK and
kinase domains were predicted for GiPI3K1 with significant expectant (E) values (i.e. the E-values were below the
default threshold set for significance). C2, PIK and kinase
domains were predicted for GiPI3K2, again with significant E-values. Interestingly, both putative kinase domains
appeared to be interrupted by long insertions as compared with other well-studied PI3Ks (see Figure 1, dotted
lines). We carried out sequence-similarity searches with
the predicted Ubiquitin/RBD-like domain of GiPI3K1
which returned matches against the Ras Binding Domains
of several mammalian Class I PI3Ks (see Table 1 for similarity scores). This finding is interesting, since G. intestinalis apparently contains no Ras protein-encoding
sequences [17]. A recent (May 2006, unpublished) G.
intestinalis genome survey by us supports this claim: we
could only identify putative Rab, Ran and Rac GTPases
encoded in the G. intestinalis genome [16], but no Rasencoding sequences. One could speculate that the putative RBD of GiPI3K1 may be recruited to membranes by
another Ras-like small GTPase such as Rab.

Full-length and domain-only sequence similarity analysis
of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 demonstrated clear similarity
with PI3Ks from other organisms, in particular GiPI3K1 is
predicted to be similar to Class I PI3Ks and GiPI3K2 to
Class III PI3Ks (Table 1, see also next section). Due to low
conservation of sequence similarity amongst C2 domains
from various PI3Ks, similar analysis carried out for the
predicted C2 domains of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 did not
return significant matches to the C2 domains of other
PI3Ks. However, C2 pairwise sequence alignments (Figure
2) demonstrated reasonable C2 domain similarity.
To further substantiate the identity of the giardial PI3K
domains, pairwise alignments of the RBD of GiPI3K1 and
the C2 and PIK domains of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 were
carried out with PI3Ks which shared the greatest similarity
with the giardial PI3Ks (see Table 1). Figure 2 shows how
the domains of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 align well with
domains of PI3Ks from D. discoideum and Glycine max
respectively.
A similar, detailed multiple alignment analysis was carried out for the kinase domains of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2
against the structurally characterised kinase domain of
PI3Kγ (a Class IB PI3K) from the domestic pig, Sus scrofa
[18] (Figure 3). All residues required for ATP binding and
kinase activity in the S. scrofa PI3Kγ are conserved in both
GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2. However, GiPI3K2 lacks one of the
lysines thought to interact with the I-phosphate of PI substrate (Lys-807 in the S. scrofa sequence) and a lysine
thought to act as a ligand for the 5-phosphate of PI(4,5)P2
(Lys-973 in the S. scrofa sequence) [18]. In addition,
GiPI3K2's activation loop appears to be shorter. All of
these features are common to other functional Class III
PI3K isoforms such as D. discoideum DdPIK5 [13], which
are thought to be specific for PtdIns only since their short
activation loops cannot accommodate the 4-phosphate of
PtdIns(4)P substrate [18]. GiPI3K1's activation loop is
similar in length to that of the S. scrofa PI3Kγ. Taken
together, this analysis strongly suggests that GiPI3K1 and
GiPI3K2 are functional PI3Ks belonging to the Class I and
Class III isoforms respectively.

insertions in the giardial kinase domains are indicated by a dotted line.

Both the kinase domains of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 have
long insertions (96 and 235 amino acids in length respectively) that do not align with sequences in the kinase
domain of S. scrofa PI3Kγ, and neither do they align with
each other. The positions of these insertions are intriguing
since they are close to the highly conserved catalytic loop
residues, and appear to sit between the N- and C-terminal
lobes of the predicted kinase domains (Figure 3). Secondary structure predictions of the insertions indicate that
they may fold into additional structures associated with
the respective kinase domains. In silico three-dimensional
structural sequence alignments using the structurally characterised S. scrofa PI3Kγ as a template suggest that the
insertions are probably surface-exposed with respect to
the two lobes of the kinase domains, aligning to a coil

between two alpha helices (data not shown). Thus, these
putative domains could be accommodated without preventing the correct folding of the kinase domains and may
not hinder substrate access. Sequence similarity searches
of the insertions did not yield any evidence in terms of
predicting their biological role. Multiple alignments with
twenty-six Class I and Class III PI3Ks from different organisms indicated that the apparent insertions are a unique
feature of the giardial sequences. These observations
prompted speculation as to the nature of the insertions.
Because trophozoites undergo substantial morphological
changes and alterations in gene expression [19] the insertions could be subjected to differential splicing – perhaps
as a way of controlling enzyme activity [20]. However, RTPCR experiments using 36 hr encysting cell RNA provided

longest in the analyses indicative of an accelerated evolution of these sequences. Phylogenetic reconstruction artefacts such as Long Branch Attraction [21] are therefore
expected to affect these analyses. This would most likely
only affect the placement within the isoform clade but not
across isoforms. Therefore, our analyses cannot say much
about the evolution of the G. intestinalis PI3Ks but can be
used to identify which isoform each sequence belongs to.

Phylogenetic analyses of the two putative giardial PI3Ks
clearly show their distinctive nature (Figure 5). GiPI3K1
clusters with the well characterised D. discoideum PIK1.
Together, they are part of a clade exclusively containing
PI3K1 homologs further strengthening our prediction that
GiPI3K1 is a Class I isoform. The GiPI3K2 sequence
belongs to a well-supported clade containing only Class
III homologs, in agreement with our prediction based on
domain composition (see Figure 1 and previous section).
Although crown taxa fall in well-supported clades for the
Class III homologs, support for the placement of the other
sequences is lacking. The G. intestinalis Class III homolog
is either basal to all other Class III homologs (Fig. 5A) or
within the alveolates (Fig. 5B). The lengths of the
branches leading to the G. intestinalis homologs are the

Characterisation of Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2 gene products
RT-PCR analysis (Figure 4) demonstrated that Gipi3k1 and
Gipi3k2 are both expressed in trophozoites and 36 hr
encysting cells, suggesting they play an important role
during growth and possibly during encystation. The predicted open reading frames of Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2 encode
longer amino acid sequences as compared with other
well-studied Class I and III PI3Ks (Figure 1). To test the
coding capacity of these genes, we probed northern blots
of RNA derived from trophozoites and 36 hr encysting
cells with sequences specific to the highly conserved
kinase domain-encoding region of Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2.
We were unable to detect Gipi3k2 mRNA despite using
control probes against well-characterised giardial transcripts to confirm RNA integrity (data not shown). This
may indicate that the Gipi3k2 message is relatively
unabundant, detectable only by sensitive techniques such
as RT-PCR. The apparent Gipi3k1 mRNA transcript
detected by northern blotting (Figure 6) was smaller than
expected based on the predicted size of the Gipi3k1 open
reading frame: 3.5 – 4 kb as opposed to ~6.5 kb. Subsequent 5'RACE experiments (Figure 7) indicated that three
transcriptional initiation sites of the Gipi3k1 gene may
exist, capable of producing transcripts of ~6.5 kb, ~5kb,
and ~3.8 kb in length, assuming they shared a common 3'
polyadenylation site. A typical giardial polyadenylation
site conforming to the consensus AGTPurAAPyr [22] for
the Gipi3k1 gene was found (AGTATAAT), however putative polyadenylation sites for Gipi3k2 could not be identified. The shortest Gipi3k1 5'RACE product could represent
the Gipi3k1 transcript detected by northern blotting. This
suggests that the major transcript of the Gipi3k1 gene
would encode a product more akin to the molecular
weights observed for other well-studied PI3Ks [11],
although it would lack the potential RBD. This may imply
the existence of protein products which not only differ in
size but also in the way in which they are regulated. The
RBD of a Class I PI3K has been shown to stimulate the
PI3K's kinase activity in addition to stabilising its association with the plasma membrane [23]. Thus Gipi3k1 protein products with an RBD may display differences in
activity and/or localisation compared to those without an
RBD.

from each of the three alternative Gipi3k1 transcripts are

also indicated in Figure 7. Promoter elements in G. intestinalis tend to have a relatively loose consensus, however
it is generally thought that an AT-rich initiator of 8–10 bp
exists near the transcription/translation start site in addition to a longer AT-rich element further upstream from
the transcriptional start site which may contain CAAT
boxes [24]. It is interesting that the apparent promoters of
all three Gipi3k1 transcripts have some or all of these features. In addition, the shortest transcript is the only one to
have upstream CAAT boxes. Possibly the 'loose' molecular
machinery controlling giardial transcription [25] could be
responsible for the presence of three Gipi3k1 transcripts,
whereby transcription is initiated at several AT-rich
regions. The use of specific antibodies against GiPI3K1

will be required to clarify whether the transcripts encode
multiple proteins with distinct functions.
Effect of PI3K inhibition on trophozoite proliferation
To determine the functional role of putative PI3Ks in G.
intestinalis growth, we applied a commonly used PI3K
inhibitor, LY294002, on G. intestinalis trophozoites. We
tested a range of concentrations around those shown to
selectively inhibit mammalian PI3Ks [26]. Figure 8a
shows a dose-response of exponentially growing cells to
the inhibitor, with concentrations of LY294002 as low as
25 µM causing a significant inhibitory effect on cell
number as compared with the untreated control. Approximately 50% inhibition of cell proliferation occurred at

ribofuranosylbenzimidazole), on trophozoite proliferation. Putative giardial CKII may exist under the accession
numbers XP_766966 (for the alpha subunit) and
EAA39338 (for the beta subunit), although there is no
experimental evidence for this inference. The use of DRB
at concentrations known to be inhibitory in mammalian
cell types [27] did not cause the same effect on cell proliferation as LY294002 (Figure 8b). This, coupled with the
fact that relatively low concentrations of LY294002 cause
a significant decrease in cell number, strongly supports a
specific effect on putative PI3Ks. Furthermore, this data
suggests that trophozoite proliferation is dependent on
the functionality of PI3K signalling.

concentrations between 25 and 75 µM. This effect is likely
to be PI3K-mediated, since LY294002 concentrations
within the 50 – 100 µM range have been employed for
selective PI3K inhibition in mammalian cells. To understand the time course over which LY294002 exhibited its
effects, we counted 50 µM LY294002 – treated cells at regular intervals over a 48 hour period. Figure 8b demonstrates that LY294002 begins to significantly effect cell
number 8 hours into treatment. For the duration of the
time-course, cell number remains approximately constant, whilst the untreated control continues to grow
exponentially. This suggests that LY294002 may affect cell
proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest. In addition, trophozoites treated with LY294002 do not undergo any dramatic changes in their morphology or motility, thus
further demonstrating the selective effect of LY294002 on
Giardia's cell cycle.
To ensure that the effects of LY294002 were due to inhibition of one or more of the putative PI3Ks and not another
target, such as the Casein Kinase II (CKII) protein which
can also be inhibited by LY294002 [26], we tested the
effect of the CKII-inhibitor, DRB (5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-

and distinctive giardial PI3K-encoding genes and gene
products. GiPI3K1 is predicted to be a Class I PI3K and
GiPI3K2 a Class III PI3K; both are predicted to be functional as PI3Ks and both are expressed during normal
growth and possibly during encystation. In addition, we
have demonstrated that inhibition of putative giardial
PI3Ks by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 causes a specific
and significant inhibition of trophozoite proliferation.
Interestingly, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin did not
effect trophozoite growth as LY294002 did. This was
despite our attempts to account for wortmannin instability [28,29] by both testing the activity of our stock solutions on mammalian cell cultures to detect reduced
phosphorylated PKB levels and by making repeated additions of the agent to trophozoite cultures (data not
shown). Wortmannin-insensitive PI3Ks have been
described in yeast, where yeast Vps34 is known to be
1200× less susceptible to wortmannin inhibition than its
human homologue [30]. Differences in sensitivity can be
explained by differences in key ATP/wortmannin-binding
regions of the respective Class III isoforms [30]. Analyses
of the giardial PI3Ks demonstrate that they too have residues that differ at the same positions described for yeast
Vps34. For example, human Vps34 and yeast Vps34 differ
at positions equivalent to positions Ile-831 and Gly-868
in the S. scrofa sequence in Figure 3. At these positions, the
isoleucine is replaced by a leucine and the glycine
replaced with a serine in both GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2.
These residue differences might explain Giardia's apparent
insensitivity to wortmannin. An alternative explanation is
that the insertions located near to the active sites of
GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 somehow interfere with wortmannin binding, but not LY294002 binding, since the inhibitory mechanisms of both inhibitors are quite distinct.
Wortmannin is an irreversible inhibitor that causes conformational changes to the PI3K active site, whereas
LY294002 is a reversible inhibitor that binds less deeply
into the active site than wortmannin [30]. Further analysis

will be required to test the wortmannin sensitivity of purified giardial PI3Ks.
The giardial PI3Ks contain long insertions which effectively appear to separate the two lobes of their putative
kinase domains. These insertions are unique to the giardial sequences and are likely to form part of the protein
sequence, as they are not intron-derived. The reason for
their existence is unknown, but could simply represent a
peculiar feature of the evolutionarily distant/parasiticallydivergent G. intestinalis. The presence of the giardial PI3K
insertions further adds to the observation of relatively
large insertions of unknown function found in protein
kinases from other organisms such as Plasmodium, Leishmania and trypanosomes [31] in addition to other giardial
sequences [32]. Insertions in giardial sequences have been
suggested to serve as useful drug targets [32]. This is particularly relevant in the case of the giardial PI3Ks identified here since PI3K activity in G. intestinalis is important
for parasite proliferation. Hence drugs that could selectively target giardial PI3Ks on the basis of their insertion
sequences would be highly desirable in terms of being
parasite-specific and effective. Current progress in designing PI3K-directed pharmacological agents [33] suggests
that this could be attainable in the future.
The identity of Class I and Class III isoforms suggests that
G. intestinalis is capable of PI-based signal transduction for
a range of processes covering typical Class I PI3K sites (the
plasma membrane and cytosol for receiving and process-

ing extracellular signals) and Class III PI3K sites (intracellular membranes for regulation of vesicle trafficking). To
understand the potential role of PI3K signalling in G.
intestinalis in a broader context, we used sequence-similarity tools to identify additional giardial signalling homologues. Figure 9 shows giardial proteins which could
metabolise the putative products of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2
in addition to other PI intermediates, starting with phosphatidylinositol which has already been found in G. intestinalis [8]. The PI-metabolising phosphatases identified
include: a PI 5-phosphatase and a PTEN-like PI 3-phosphatase which may both act to dephosphorylate the likely
products of GiPI3K1 in addition to an MTM-like PI 3phosphatase that could dephosphorylate the likely product of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2. The PI-metabolising kinases
identified include: a PIPkin, or phosphatidylinositolphosphate kinase of as yet unknown type which could
phosphorylate several PI-intermediates, such as
PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4)P in addition to a
putative PI-4 kinase to phosphorylate PtdIns for the purpose of eventual PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generation. Thus
sequence analysis does support mechanisms for metabolising the products of the giardial PI3Ks.
To predict how these products, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2
and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, may act as effective second messengers for downstream effectors, we searched the G. intestinalis genome [16] for proteins which have the relevant PIbinding domains such as phox-homology (PX), FYVE
(Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1) and pleckstrin-

Figure 9
Proposed model for PI metabolism and PI3K signalling in G. intestinalis
Proposed model for PI metabolism and PI3K signalling in G. intestinalis. A model of PI3K signalling in G. intestinalis
based on known mechanisms in mammalian cells and yeast. GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 are suggested to localise at the plasma membrane and GiPI3K2 at some undefined intracellular compartment. Proteins that may participate in G. intestinalis PI metabolism
have been identified and are shown (as indicated by numbering): (1) MTM (Myotubularin, GenPept: EAA37232 or EAA38552),
(2) PIPkin (Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, GenPept: EAA42556), (3) PI 5-phosphatase (GenPept: EAA40147), (4) PTEN
(Phosphatase and tensin homolog, GenPept: EAA42276), (5) PI4K (Phosphoinositide 4-kinase, GenPept: EAA38121). The question mark indicates a possible 4-phosphatase of unknown identity. PtdIns(3)P possibly recruits PX and FYVE -domain-containing proteins, of which there are several encoded in the G. intestinalis genome (PX-domain proteins: EAA39579, EAA42255,
EAA42811, EAA42799 are possible sorting nexins; FYVE-domain protein: EAA42608, a possible endofin). A putative giardial
PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, GenPept: EAA38977) may be recruited to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Other previously characterised giardial signalling components which may be invoked could include: GiPKB [6], gPKA [2], g14-3-3 [46],
gTOR [47] and gERK1 and gERK2 [5]. Not shown in this figure is the possible generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 from PtdIns(4)P by
GiPI3K1.

homology (PH). PH-domain containing proteins such as
protein kinase B (PKB) use their PH domain to facilitate
recruitment to the plasma membrane where
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is located. Although Kim et al. (2005)
failed to identify a PH domain in the giardial PKB, GiPKB,
with significant similarity to the PH domain of other
PKBs, the percentage identity and similarity scores following our own sequence alignment of GiPKB's putative PH
domain with that of human PKB were 12 and 36 %
respectively (data not shown). Thus it may be that GiPKB
is capable of binding PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via a putative divergent PH domain. Another protein that binds
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via its PH domain is 3-phosphoinositidedependent kinase-1 (PDK1) which phosphorylates PKB.
We were able to identify a putative giardial PDK1 homologue which did not have an easily identifiable PH
domain when employing domain-prediction tools. However upon pairwise-alignment of its sequence with that of
human PDK1, a PH domain-like sequence was identified
with 23 % identity and 51 % similarity (data not shown).
Figure 9 proposes that from GiPKB, several other regulatory pathways involving protein components previously
characterised in G. intestinalis could be initiated. We were
able to identify PX- and FYVE-domain containing proteins
encoded by the G. intestinalis genome [16]. In mammalian
cells these domains facilitate binding and recruitment to
PtdIns(3)P. The giardial PX-domain proteins tend to be
similar to sorting nexins, and the FYVE-domain protein is
similar to endofin. Both of these proteins are implicated
in regulating membrane traffic. Thus via these giardial
homologs it may be possible to connect the product of
GiPI3K2 with vesicle trafficking mechanisms. Overall, the
presence of putatively functional PI3Ks, PI-metabolising
enzymes and downstream effectors further substantiates
the existence of bona-fide PI3K signalling pathways in G.
intestinalis, as supported by our functional data employing
a widely-used and characterised PI3K inhibitor.

Conclusion
We conclude that the human intestinal parasite G. intestinalis encodes and expresses two putative PI3Ks, GiPI3K1
and GiPI3K2, both of which are likely to be functional
based on sequence analysis. Functionality of PI3Kdependent processes has been demonstrated by observing
the specific inhibitory effect of a PI3K-inhibitor on trophozoite proliferation. Phylogenetic analysis supports the
assignment of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 to the Class I and
Class III PI3K subdomains respectively, and in-depth
sequence analysis further substantiates their proposed
substrate specificities. Genome sequence analysis can link
the products of GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 with putative giardial PI-metabolising phosphatases and kinases, in addition to downstream effectors with PI-binding domains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/45

This provides additional evidence for bona-fide PI3K signalling pathways in G. intestinalis.
A feature unique to both giardial PI3Ks is the presence of
a large insertion in a highly conserved region of their
kinase domains. Both insertions are not subject to splicing
and are not predicted to interfere with substrate binding.
Thus, considering the important role of PI3Ks for parasite
proliferation, it is possible that the insertion sequences
could be exploited for drug-targeting purposes.

Methods
Sequence similarity searches and alignments
The translation BLAST [34] tool at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used with default
settings to search for putative PI3Ks in the Giardia intestinalis genome [16] using the kinase domain sequences of
the following protein sequences as queries: Homo sapiens
p110α [GenPept: NP_006209], H. sapiens PI3K-C2α
[GenPept: NP_002636] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Vps34 [GenPept: NP_013341]. The searches returned several matches to putative open reading frames (ORFs).
Gene sequences in a non-redundant database at NCBI
were searched for similar sequences to the putative ORFs
via NCBI's translation-BLAST and nucleotide-BLAST tools
(used with default settings) in order to identify two putative PI3K-encoding ORFs (subsequently called Gipi3k1
and Gipi3k2). SMART [35], and SCOP [36] were used with
default settings to predict PI3K-characteristic domains in
GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2 and other PI3Ks. Several sequences
were multiple-aligned using ClustalW [37] with default
settings. Secondary structure predictions were carried out
using the PSIPRED server [38] used with default settings.
Phylogenetic analysis
The conceptually translated G. intestinalis PI3K sequences,
GiPI3K1 and GiPI3K2, were aligned to reference
sequences from Genbank using ClustalW [37]. In order to
obtain a taxonomically sound sample, homologues
sequences were sought amongst the Metazoa, Viridiplantae, Fungi, Stramenopiles, Alveolates, and species generally considered to be 'deep-branching'. The alignments
were manually refined and only unambiguously aligned
regions without gaps were used for phylogenetic analysis,
leaving a dataset of 26 taxa with 473 amino acid positions. Likelihood searches were performed in a Bayesian
framework using mixed amino acid models accommodating site rate variation (fraction of invariable sites plus
eight variable gamma rates) using the program MrBayes
[39]. All analyses started with randomly generated trees
and ran for 100,000 generations, with sampling at intervals of 100 generations that produced 1,000 trees. The
log-likelihood values of the 1,000 trees were plotted
against the generation time (not shown). All the trees produced prior to reaching stationarity were discarded, mak-

ing sure that burn-in samples were not retained. Although
the likelihood model stabilized very rapidly (data not
shown), only the last 900 trees were used to estimate separate 50% majority rule consensus trees for these. The frequency of any particular clade, among the individual trees
contributing to the consensus tree, represents the posterior probability of that clade [39]. In addition, maximum
likelihood (ML) analyses were obtained using PHYML
[40]. The protein data set was re-sampled 100 times and
analysed with alpha and invariant sites parameters optimised on the initial BIONJ tree produced by PHYML.
Analyses were done with a mixed eight-category discrete
gamma plus invariable sites model of rate heterogeneity.
The JTT substitution model was used in the protein analyses. Majority rule consensus trees were obtained from the
resulting 100 trees.
G. intestinalis cell culture
G. intestinalis strain WB (ATCC 30957, clone C6) was routinely subcultured every 3 to 4 days at 37°C in axenic
modified YI-S medium [41]. Encystation was carried out
according to published procedures [42].
PI3K inhibition
Routinely subcultured G. intestinalis trophozoites were
grown for 48 hours prior to treatment with the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride) and CKII inhibitor
DRB (5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole).
Cells were treated with LY294002 to achieve final concentrations of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 µM from a 100× stock
solution in DMSO. Cells were treated with DRB to achieve
a final concentration of 100 µM from a 100× stock solution. Control cells were treated with equal volumes of
DMSO. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and counted
with a haemocytometer. Count data was tested for normal
distribution and significance using the Student t-test
within the SigmaPlot package (Systat Software Inc.).
Nucleic acid methods
DNA and RNA isolation
Genomic DNA was extracted from harvested trophozoites
according to the TriPure Isolation method (Roche). Total
RNA was extracted from both harvested trophozoites and
encysting cells using the RNAeasy Mini Kit for animal cells
(Qiagen). RNA was purified from contaminating DNA
using DNase I (Invitrogen) and the RNAeasy Mini Protocol for RNA Cleanup (Qiagen) was used to remove components of the DNase I digestion reaction from RNA.
Generation of cDNA
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 20 µl
reaction mix containing 6 µg total RNA, 5 µM random
hexamer primers, 2.5 mM DTT, 250 µM dNTPs, 40 U

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/45

RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (all from
GibcoBRL) and 25 U MLV RT (GeneSys Ltd). RNA was
denatured by heating at 70°C 10 min, followed by cooling on ice to anneal random hexamer primers. MLV RT
was added, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Negative
controls replaced RT with RNAse-free water.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
PCR was performed on G. intestinalis cDNA, genomic
DNA and plasmid DNA using the following gene specific
primers: Gipi3k1 ins_5465S: (5' GCC ATT CGA GGG TTT
GAT AG 3'); Gipi3k1 ins_6216AS: (5' GAT TGC TAG TAG
GGC ATC TG 3'); Gipi3k2 4871AS: (5' TGT GGA AGG
CGT CGA TGA AC 3'); Gipi3k2 ins_3424S: (5' ACG ATG
TGC GAC TAG ACA TG 3'); Gipi3k1(1)NotI S: (5' GAG
AGC GGC CGC ACC ATG GGA ATG CAG GTT TCC ATT
ATA AG 3'); Gipi3k1(1)BamHI AS: (5' CTC TGT AGG TGG
CTT ATA TG 3'); Gipi3k1(2)BamHI S: (5'CTA TGC GCA
TAA GCT TTG AG 3'); Gipi3k1(2) BamHI AS (5' GGA AGC
GCC TCC TCC AAC TCT AAG GAT CCG AGA 3'). Primer
sequences designed to demonstrate the presence of the
intron in some G. intestinalis ferredoxin-encoding mRNAs
were taken from Nixon et al. (2002) [43] and included as
a positive control to confirm the presence of spliced and
unspliced mRNA. Gipi3k1 and Gipi3k2 PCR products (generated from primers Gipi3k1 5945S/6374AS and Gipi3k2
4441S/4871AS respectively) were cloned into pGEM-T
Easy (Promega) and sequenced using the dideoxy-nucleotide termination method at the DNA Analysis Facility,
Dundee University. Sequence output was analysed and
verified using BioEdit [44].
Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)
The 5' RACE system from Invitrogen was used to determine the start of Gipi3k1 transcription. Oligonucleotides
GSP1_393 (5' GCT GAC AAG AGC CTC TGC TA 3') or
GSP1_2947 (5' GGC TTT AGA AGA AAC AAG GA 3')
primed the first strand cDNA synthesis, and oligonucleotides GSP2_313 (5' GCC AGC TTT CTA GCA GGT CA 3')
or GSP2_2914 (5' GTC CAC TTG AGA AGT ATC CT 3')
served as nested primers. PCR products were cloned and
sequenced as above.
Northern blotting
Northern blotting was carried out using a nonradioactive
method (Roche). DNA probes incorporating digoxigenin
(DIG) were generated against the kinase-domain encoding region of Gipi3k1/2 via PCR amplification of pGEM-T
Easy plasmids (Promega) carrying sequences of Gipi3k1/2
genes. 5 µg G. intestinalis total RNA was prepared as
described above and separated on a 1.2 % agarose/0.5 %
formaldehyde/1% 1× MOPS (3-M-Morpholino propanesulphonic acid) gel and transferred to positively
charged nylon membrane (BrightStar-Plus, Ambion) by
capillary transfer. RNA was fixed to the membrane by bak-

ing at 80°C for 2 hr. DIG-labelled DNA probes were
hybridised to blots for 16 hours at 50°C. Membranes were
washed at high stringency using techniques described by
Roche. Antibody solution (1:10,000 Anti-DigoxigeninAP) (Roche, 75 mU/ml) was added to the membrane for
30 min at room temperature. Chemiluminescent substrate CSPD (Roche) was added to the membrane and
exposed to film.

coordination and helped to draft the manuscript. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Cloning and sequencing of Gipi3k1
The entire Gipi3k1 nucleotide sequence was cloned into
the pcDNA 3.1/myc-His(-) B vector (Invitrogen) as follows: the 6,468 bp Gipi3k1 gene sequence was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase from G. intestinalis genomic
DNA as two approximately-equal sized inserts using
primer pairs as described above which would incorporate
NotI and BamHI restriction sites, specifically 5' NotI - 3'
BamHI for the first insert and 5' BamHI - 3'BamHI for the
second. Inserts were ligated into NotI/BamHI (Promega)
linearised vector using T4 DNA ligase (Promega), transformed and cloned in SURE Escherichia coli (Stratagene)
cells and plasmid DNA extracted using a Qiagen miniprep
kit. pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) B - Gipi3k1 plasmid was
sequenced across the entire length of the Gipi3k1
sequence as described above.
