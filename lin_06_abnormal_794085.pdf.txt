Abstract
Background: Insulin resistance and glucose dysmetabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are related
with the polymorphisms in the genes encoding the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, especially Gly972Arg/
Ala513Pro polymorphism being reported to be associated with type-2 diabetes and PCOS. We intended to assess
the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) and insulin resistance in Taiwanese PCOS women. We also
tried to assess whether the particular identity of Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphic alleles of the IRS-1 gene
mutation can be used as an appropriate diagnostic indicator for PCOS.
Methods: We designed a prospective clinical study. Forty-seven Taiwanese Hoklo and Hakka women, diagnosed
with PCOS were enrolled in this study as were forty-five healthy Hoklo and Hakka women as the control group.
Insulin resistance was evaluated with fasting insulin, fasting glucose/insulin ratio, and homeostasis model
assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMAIR). The genomic DNA of the subjects was amplified by PCR and
digested by restriction fragmented length polymorphism (RFLP) with Bst N1 used for codon 972 and Dra III for
codon 513.
Results: AGT was found in 46.8% of these PCOS patients and was significantly related to high insulin resistance
rather than the low insulin resistance. Those patients with either insulin resistance or AGT comprised the
majority of PCOS affected patients (AGT + fasting insulin 17: 83%, AGT + glucose/insulin ratio 6.5: 85.1%, AGT
+ HOMAIR  2: 87.2%, and AGT + HOMAIR  3.8: 72.3%). None of the tested samples revealed any polymorphism
due to the absence of any Dra III recognition site or any Bst N1 recognition site in the amplified PCR fragment
digested by restriction fragmented length polymorphism.
Conclusion: There is significantly high prevalence of AGT and insulin resistance in PCOS women, but Gly972Arg
and Ala513Pro polymorphic alleles of IRS-1 are rare and are not associated with the elevated risk of PCOS
amongst Taiwanese subjects. This is quite different from the similar study in phylogenetically diverged Caucasian
subjects.

Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the mostcommon endocrine disorders for premenopausal women
with a prevalence rate of 4–12% internationally [1]. PCOS
is characterized by irregular menses, chronic anovulation,
infertility, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance [2].
In 1991, Poretsky and Nestler found insulin to be an effector of ovarian and adrenal steroid metabolism, and postulated the paradox of insulin-induced hyperandrogenism
within insulin-resistant states [3]. In addition to being
involved as a predisposing factor for type-2 diabetes, insulin resistance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCOS
[4].
Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are critical to signal transduction in insulin target tissues [5]. The binding
of insulin to its receptor induces the phosphorylation of
the cytosolic substrates IRS-1 and IRS-2 [6]. Nevertheless,
the biokinetic response of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to tyrosine protein kinases depends upon the binding specificity and
affinity of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the
IRS, which can be altered by mutated aminoacid polymorphisms within the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
domain [7]. Among these identified tyrosine phosphorylation sites. [6,7], mutations of Gly972Arg, Pro170Arg
and Met209Thr have revealed different level of reduction
in Phosphatidylinostiol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity [8].
The impaired insulin-signaling pathway for PI 3-kinase
activity plays a role in the development of insulin resistance [7-9]. Therefore, the Ser892Gly and Thr608Arg polymorphisms for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM) patients were reported, such a mutation revealing a consequent decrease in insulin-induced phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activity [10,11].
Beside influencing an individual's susceptibility to
NIDDM, these polymorphisms have been shown to be
associated with phenotypic features of PCOS [12,13]. We
chose the Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro variants of the IRS-1
gene for investigation, because these specific allelic variants are located near the Tyr-Met-X-Met (YMXM) motifs
around Tyr987 and Tyr612 and because these variants
have been reported to influence insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and fatty-acid composition of muscles with a
non-sporadic prevalence [7,10,14]. Our purpose was to
identify, within the Taiwanese population of PCOS, the
prevalence of the IRS-1 gene mutation with impaired tyrosine kinase activity, in order toassess whether the identity
of the IRS-1 gene mutation of codon 513 (GCC->CCC)
and codon 972 (GGG->AGG) can act as an appropriate
diagnostic indicator for Taiwanese PCOS characterized by
hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism.
There were apparently racial differences in the phenotypic
expression of insulin resistance as well as the genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/7/36

mutations in different races with PCOS [15,16]. Because
of the racial differences in the phenotypic and genotypic
expression of PCOS-affected subjects, we purposely
focused our study on the genotypic polymorphism in socalled" Taiwanese"habitants in Taiwan [17]. The population of Taiwan area were composed of Taiwnanese Hoklo
(or Minnan), Taiwanese Hakka (or Haka), immigrant
Chinese mainlanders, and aborigines [17,18]. In traditional term, so-called" Taiwanese" are Taiwanese Hoklo
and Hakka. We focus our study on the Taiwanese Hoklo
and Hakka subjects, because that the genotypes of the
immigrated Chinese mainlanders were greatly diversed
and the aborigines as Malayo-Polynesians were even more
different from Han Chinese people [17,18].

Methods
Subjects
The presence of PCOS was defined according to criteria
arising from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990
and its later modification. A diagnosis of PCOS was made
according to the criteria defined by: (i) hyperandrogenism, (ii) oligo-ovulation, and (iii) the exclusion of related
disorders (see below). Another diagnosis of PCOS was
also made, when the hyperandrogenism can not be definitely proved, with the criteria defined by: (i) oligo-ovulation (ii) increased LH/FSH (luteinizing hormone/follicle
stimulating hormone) ratio >2 (iii) specific criteria for
PCOS in an ultrasound scan (see below) [19]. These criteria are also adapted and included in newly proposed criteria by 2003 ASRM/ESHRE Rotterdam definition.

In the criteria of hyperandrogenism, biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined as a serum total testosterone
level > 0.8 ng/ml or testosterone > 0.7 ng/ml with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) < 30 nmol/L [16]. The
ultrasound definition of polycystic ovary was defined as
follows: "increased ovarian area (>5.5 cm2/ovary) or volume (>11 m3/ovary) and/or presence of 12 follicles
measuring 2–9 mm in diameter (mean of both ovaries)"[20,21]. The following diseases were excluded from
our study: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (abnormal 17-hydroxyprogesterone
level), pituitary insufficiency, pituitary tumor, and prediagnosed known diabetes mellitus. Additional to NIH
1990 criteria of PCOS, Rotterdam 2003 definition of
PCOS expended two additional phenotypes, some of
them were excluded because that these criteria increase
the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder and their use
will likely decrease the ability of genetic and other molecular studies [19].
From November 2002 to July 2005 inclusively, fortyseven subjects, of which thirty-seven were Taiwanese
Hoklo people (78.7%), ten subjects were Taiwanese
Hakka (21.3%), and no aboriginal or mainlanders, were

recruited for this study from the infertility/endocrine/
obesity clinics of the Kuo General Hospital, according to
the above criteria. Another fifty patients were enrolled
from the normal population without clinical PCOS to
constitute the primary control group. In the further biochemical and sonographic evaluation, five subjects were
excluded due to abnormal biochemical androgen level,
LH/FSH ratio  2, or abnornal ovarian sonographic finding. The residual forty-five patients, thirty-eight Taiwanese
Hoklo individuals (84.4%) and seven Taiwanese Hakka
(15.6%), constituted the final control group. This study
has been approved by the Kuo General Hospital Ethics
Committee.
Laboratory tests
Fasting insulin, fasting glucose, testosterone, SHBG, FSH,
LH, and prolactin levels were all determined. Plasma levels of FSH, LH, prolactin, and SHBG were determined
using immunofluorometric assays, and the testosterone
and insulin levels were determined using radioimmunoassay study.

The abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) was defined as
either impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus in
the 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) by American Diabetes Association criteria. The level of insulin
resistance was evaluated with respect to fasting insulin
level, the glucose:insulin ratio [glucose (mg/dl)/insulin
(uU/ml)], and the HOMAIRindex (homeostasis model
assessment index for insulin resistance) [fasting insulin
(uU/ml) × fasting glucose (mg/dl)/405].
Extraction of genomic DNA
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells by using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The purity, size
and concentration of the isolated DNA was measured by
A260/A280 and agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR was used
to amplify two regions of the franking codon 972 and
codon 513 of IRS-1.
PCR and Restriction fragmented length polymorphism
(RFLP)
According to the DNA sequences proposed in 1995 by
Hitman et al. [22], the sequences of the primers for PCR
are listed as: (1) The primers for Codon 513: Forward
primer, 1953 5'GCG GTG AGG AGG AGC TAA GC 3'
1972, and Reverse primer 2200 3' GGG CAG GGT CAG
GAG TCA CCG 5' 2220; (2) The primers for Codon 972:
Forward primer, 3339 5' CTT CTG TCA GGT GTC CAT CC
3' 3358, and Reverse primer 3582 3' CGA TGC ACC TGT
GGA GCG GT 5' 3601.

PCR was performed using 50 ul primers with 0.3 ug of
genomic DNA. The assay conditions were: 10 mmol/L

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/7/36

Tris-HCl (pH = 9.0), 50 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mmol/L of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA). The selected samples were subjected to 35 cycles of
amplification: denaturation at 94°C for one minute,
annealing at 60°C for one minute, and extension at 72°C
for two minutes. The resulting products were 268 bp and
263 bp for codon 513 and 972, respectively.
The PCR products were digested with restriction
enzyme(s) followed by agarose gel electrophoresis: 1) For
the PCR products of codon 972 digested with Bst N1, the
resulting wild-type samples contained three bands sized
23, 81 and 159 bp and the mutant samples contained four
bands sized 23, 81, 108 and 51 bp. We noted five bands
sized 23, 81, 159, 108 and 51 bp for Gly972/Arg972 heterozygotes and four bands sized 23, 81, 108 and 51 bp for
Arg972 homozygotes. 2) For the PCR products of codon
513 digested with Dra III, the resulting wild-type samples
contained one band sized 268 bp, and the mutant samples contained two bands sized 168 bp and 100 bp; three
bands sized 268 bp, 168 bp and 100 bp were noted for
Ala513/Pro513 heterozygotes and two bands sized 168
bp and 100 bp for Pro513 homozygotes.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed by using the Statistical Program Social
Sciences (SPSS 10.0.7C for Windows). Results were presented as mean values ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between PCOS patients and normal control
group were performed using Student's t-test. It was also
used to compare the variables in abnormal and normal
glucose tolerance patients. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Characteristics of the 47 patients with PCOS
Forty-seven women were finally included in the diagnosis
of PCOS. Their average age was 26.3 ± 5.4 years ranging
from 17 to 36 years old. They also had higher body weight
and body mass index (BMI) (average weight: 72.4 ± 14.5
kg; range, average BMI: 28.5 ± 6.0) than the normal population (average age 24.6 ± 3.9 years, average weight: 56.4
± 9.8 kg, average BMI: 21.7 ± 3.2). The clinical feature distributions of our patients are shown in Table 1. Thirty-one
(65.9%) of the 47 women were obese (BMI ± 25) and fifteen (31.9%) had acanthosis nigrans.

In biochemical assays, 45 (95.7%) of the 47 women with
PCOS were found to have a testosterone level ± 0.8 ng/ml,
and 2 (4.3%) < 0.8 ng/ml, with an average testosterone
level of 1.3 ± 0.5 ng/ml. An insulin level (average 24.4 ±
17.2 uU/ml) ± 17 was found in 32 (68.1%) of the 47
patients. The average fasting blood sugar (91.3 ± 18.1 mg/
dl) was normal. A ratio (average: 5.27 ± 3.34) of glucose

to insulin ± 6.5 was found in 35 (74.5%) of the 47
patients. Decreased sex hormone binding globulin
(SHBG) was also noted with an average of 21.1 ± 8.3
nmol/L. The averages of LH/FSH ratio (2.1 ± 1.0) and prolactin level (18.6 ± 8.0 ng/ml) were significantly increased
(Table 1).
Co-expression of abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin
resistance
With normal fasting glucose levels, these PCOS patients
had decreased SHBG levels than the control (21.1 ± 8.3 vs.
48.1 ± 7.8 nmol/L, p < 0.05), the insulin levels higher
(24.4 ± 17.2 vs. 7.9 ± 6.7 uU/ml, p < 0.05) and the homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance
(HOMAIR) higher (5.21 ± 3.73 vs. 1.59 ± 0.65 units, p <
0.05) (Table 1).

Twenty-two (46.8%) of these PCOS patients had abnormal results in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) by
American Diabetes Association criteria. None had prediagnosed diabetes mellitus. In these twenty-two (46.8%)
AGT patients, five met the criteria of diabetes mellitus in
our OGTT and seventeen (36.2%) met the criteria of glucose intolerance (IGT). Fasting insulin level, glucose/insulin ratio, and HOMAIR are all significantly related to the
presence of abnormal OGTT test (p < 0.05). A high insulin
group with insulin level 17 uU/ml constituted 68.1%
(32/47) of the PCOS patients. Co-existence of abnormal
OGTT and high insulin was found in 68.2% (15/22) of
AGT group and 46.9% (15/32) of high insulin group. A
low glucose/insulin ratio group with glucose/insulin ratio
6.5 constituted 74.5% (35/47) of the PCOS affected

patients. In this low glucose/insulin ratio group, co-existence of abnormal OGTT and low glucose/insulin ratio
was found in 77.3% (17/22) of AGT group and 48.6%
(17/35) of low glucose/insulin group.
Regarding HOMAIR as the criteria of insulin resistance, a
moderate-high HOMAIR group with HOMAIR 2 constituted 76.6 % (36/47) of the PCOS affected patients. Coexistence of abnormal OGTT and moderate-high HOMAIR
was found in 77.3% (17/22) of AGT group and 47.2%
(17/36) of this moderate-high HOMAIR group. In the
higher standard for diagnosis of insulin resistance, high
HOMAIR group with HOMAIR 3.8 constituted 53.2 %
(25/47) of the PCOS affected patients. Co-existence of
abnormal OGTT and high HOMAIR was found in 59.1%
(13/22) of AGT group and 52% (13/25) of this high
HOMAIR group. Regarding these markers for insulin resistance, those patients with either insulin resistance or AGT
comprise the majority of PCOSaffected patients (AGT +
fasting insulin 17: 83%, AGT + glucose/insulin ratio
6.5: 85.1%, AGT + HOMAIR 2: 87.2%, and AGT +
HOMAIR 3.8: 72.3%).
Neither Ala513Pro nor Gly972Arg polymorphism found
In the PCR-RFLP analysis of the Ala513Pro polymorphism, all the tested samples from both PCOS and control
groups revealed no polymorphisms because no Dra III
recognition site was apparent for the amplified PCR fragment as represented in Figure 1A, all samples revealing a
band of 268 bp.

In the PCR-RFLP analysis of the Gly972Arg polymorphism, none of the tested samples revealed any polymorphism as indicated in Figure 1B, all samples revealing a
band of 159 bp rather than one of 108 bp plus one of 51
bp.

Discussion
The incidence of the presence of a Gly972Arg variant has
been reported to be greater for premature pubarche teenagers and hyperandrogenic adolescent girls featuring
PCOS than for control women (respectively, 27.5%: 17%
: 6.6%) [23]. Further, evidence has also supported the
reporting of a gene-dosage effect by a Gly972Arg IRS-1
variant upon fasting insulin and HOMA values amongst
PCOS-afflicted women [12]. The Gly972Arg IRS-1 variant
has been reported tobe more prevalent amongst insulinresistant PCOS patients compared with non-insulinresistant PCOS patients or control subjects (respectively,
39.3 vs. 4.0 and 16.6%, p < 0.0031) [12]. Further,
Ala513Pro variants have been previously detected for 3%–
6.9% of NIDDM patients [24,25] and were found to be
more prevalent for NIDDM patients who featured a high
fasting insulin level than was the case for Gly972Arg variants [25]. Meanwhile, a high fasting insulin level is

thought to be the initial state of hyperinsulinemia which
is found frequently amongst PCOS-affected patients
[1,16,26]. In our study, we evaluated the status of insulin
resistance with fasting insulin, fasting glucose:insulin (G/
I) ratio, and HOMAIR, all of which are parameters widely
used
to
assess
insulin
resistance
previously
[1,12,15,27,28]. It was clearly apparent that there was a
significantly greater incidence (72.3–87.2%) of either
insulin resistance or AGT amongst our PCOS patients
than was the case for the normal population, and the
prevalence of either insulin resistance or AGT amongst
our PCOS patients was certainly not less than that
reported cases for PCOS subjects in other studies
[12,15,26,29]. Nevertheless, as shown by our data, the
higher prevalence of insulin resistance amongst our PCOS
patients as compared to the controls is associated with a
significantly greater rate of glucose intolerance, which correlates with the later development of NIDDM for PCOS
subjects. The incidence (46.8%) of AGT in our study is
similar to the incidence (45%) in the report of Ermann et
al [29]. It seems higher than clinical expectation because
that our subjects, enrolled from infertility/endocrine/
obesity clinics, have higher body weigh and lower SHBG
which are correlated with incidence of insulin resistance
and AGT [16,30]. The population of PCOS is greatly different due to the collection source and criteria of PCOS.
The patients enrolled from the infertility clinic seem to
have lower body weight and higher SHBG than the
patients enrolled from the endocrine/obesity. Meanwhile,
another reason is that I do not include those multifollicularovaries (MFO), mimicing PCOS, due to other etiology,
e.g. low BMI or adolescence. They may be included in

2003 ASRM/ESHRE Rotterdam definition of PCOS, but
they could be excluded in our including criteria or NIH
1990 definition of PCOS.
According to the 2001 report of El Mkadem et al., the variants Gly972Arg of IRS-1 and Gly1057Asp of IRS-2
occurred more frequently for the PCOS population than
was the case for the normal population [12]. Reportedly,
the allelic frequency of the 972Arg variant of IRS-1 was
0.11, and the allelic frequency of the 1057Asp variant of
IRS-2 was 0.36 for PCOS individuals, and the Gly972Arg
IRS-1 variant for PCOS individuals featuring a high fasting
insulin was ten-fold greater than it was for PCOS patients
exhibiting a low fasting insulin and 2.3-fold greater than
for control women. From the 2002 study of Ehrmann et
al., however, no association of the IRS-1 Gly972Arg genotype with any clinical or hormonal measure was reported
for nondiabetic PCOS subjects [26]. From our study, independently of whether patients featured NIDDM or not,
the results also revealed no evidence of any polymorphism in the regions encoding codon 972 of the IRS-1 for
the Taiwanese population, although 36.2% of our PCOS
subjects revealed AGT and 72.3–87.2% revealed either
insulin resistance or AGT with respect to different criteria
of insulin resistance. It would appear that there may be a
racial difference in the mutated sites of IRS-1 polymorphisms featuring the similar insulin resistance. Indeed,
such a result also enhances the suspicion that the screening value of insulin resistance as a possible marker for
PCOS would likely be population-specific. For instance, a
G/I ratio of  7.2 has been suggested for insulin resistance
amongst white women suffering PCOS [15], whereas a

BMC Medical Genetics 2006, 7:36

corresponding figure of  4.0 has been proffered elsewhere for Mexican American featuring PCOS [15], as also
a figure of  6.5 for Taiwanese women with PCOS [16].
In a study of Japanese women suffering NIDDM, codon
972/513 polymorphisms were observed for 3.6%/0% of
study subjects (respectively, codon 972/codon 513), compared to a corresponding control value of 4.5%/0%
(respectively, codon 972/codon 513) there being no significant difference between NIDDM patients and controls
in this regard [31]. In the present study, our results have
not revealed any evidence suggesting polymorphism in
the regions encoding codons 972 and 513 of IRS-1
amongst the Taiwanese population. From the study of
white Caucasian NIDDM-afflicted women, however,
Zhang et al. (1996) reported that the prevalence of the
IRS-1 972 mutation was significantly higher for NIDDMsubject groups featuring insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia than was the case for normal subjects (18 and 26%
compared with 11% for the control subjects) [32]. We
acknowledge that the subjects participating in our study
were different to those participating in the study reported
by Zhang et al, in that our study subjects included 47
patients featuring PCOS, of which there were 36.2% who
revealed AGT, in addition to 45 normal women. Interestingly, we arrived at the same result as regards the absence
of any codon 513 polymorphism as was the case for this
abovementioned Japanese study, suggesting that this type
of polymorphism is quite rare amongst the general Japanese and Taiwanese population. Nevertheless, it does
appear that this study's Taiwanese test population
reflected a lower incidence of polymorphism for codon
972 than was the case for the Japanese study, the polymorphism frequency figure being 3.6%/4.5% for the Japanese
NIDDM/control groups and 0%/0% for our ninety-two
subjects [31]. Further, comparison of the incidence of the
IRS-1 972 mutation between white Caucasian, Japanese
and Taiwanese subjects, revealed that the incidence was
greatest amongst Caucasians (diseased/control: 26%/
11%) [32], lower for Japanese subjects (3.6%/4.5%) [31],
and quite rare for Taiwanese Hoklo and Hakka study subjects (0%/0%). In the phylogenetic tree, it would appear
likely that the mainland Japanese revealed the closest
affinity with continental Chinese and Korean people,
these being principally Han Chinese [33,34]. Nevertheless, Taiwanese Hoklo and Hakka individuals, which
comprised the majority of Taiwanese before the immigration of mainlanders, are closely related to southern Han
Chinese people who appear to inherit haplotypes from
both Han Chinese and Yueh individuals, making them
genetically somewhat different from the northern Han
Chinese and original Han Chinese people [17]. As for
Caucasians, the Caucasoid is, in the genetic tree, more distant from the mainland Japanese, Hoklo, and Hakka [35].
Further evidence of genetic difference between different

ethnic populations pertaining to the screening for PCOS
or insulin resistance reveals the absence of any codon
972/513 polymorphism amongst Pima Indians of Arizona (USA), this rather well-defined sub-population featuring a high prevalence of NIDDM [36].

Conclusion
Considering the statistical analysis on this scale of PCOSaffected subjects, being high risk of these polymorphisms,
we cannot resoundingly declare a universal absence of
codon 972/513 polymorphisms for Taiwanese PCOS
women according to our study of 92 Taiwanese subjects.
For this present study, however, we can conclude that no
such polymorphism was found for all study subjects and
that these polymorphisms were rare and less than other
ethnic population. Since we have depicted the highly
prevalence of AGT and insulin resistance in these PCOS
affected patients, it suggests that these two IRS-1 polymorphisms are unrelated to the emergence of glucose dysmetabolism and insulin resistance in PCOS for the Taiwanese
Hoko and Hakka population. We conclude that because
the Taiwanese PCOS population does not include a sufficiently large number of cases of codon 972/513 mutation,
these polymorphic alleles of IRS-1 are not a reliable or
appropriate method of genetic diagnosis of PCOS featuring either AGT or insulin resistance, and that these polymorphic alleles of IRS-1 are quite rare amongst Taiwanese
women.
