Evolution of lactation

Abstract
Background: The newly assembled Bos taurus genome sequence enables the linkage of bovine milk
and lactation data with other mammalian genomes.
Results: Using publicly available milk proteome data and mammary expressed sequence tags, 197
milk protein genes and over 6,000 mammary genes were identified in the bovine genome.
Intersection of these genes with 238 milk production quantitative trait loci curated from the
literature decreased the search space for milk trait effectors by more than an order of magnitude.
Genome location analysis revealed a tendency for milk protein genes to be clustered with other
mammary genes. Using the genomes of a monotreme (platypus), a marsupial (opossum), and five
placental mammals (bovine, human, dog, mice, rat), gene loss and duplication, phylogeny, sequence
conservation, and evolution were examined. Compared with other genes in the bovine genome,
milk and mammary genes are: more likely to be present in all mammals; more likely to be duplicated
in therians; more highly conserved across Mammalia; and evolving more slowly along the bovine

lineage. The most divergent proteins in milk were associated with nutritional and immunological
components of milk, whereas highly conserved proteins were associated with secretory processes.
Conclusions: Although both copy number and sequence variation contribute to the diversity of
milk protein composition across species, our results suggest that this diversity is primarily due to
other mechanisms. Our findings support the essentiality of milk to the survival of mammalian
neonates and the establishment of milk secretory mechanisms more than 160 million years ago.

Background

With the arrival of the Bos taurus genome assembly, bovine
milk and lactation data can be linked to other mammalian
genomes for the first time, allowing us to gain additional
insight into the molecular evolution of milk and lactation.
Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrate animals that nourish
their young with milk produced by mammary glands. They
first appeared approximately 166 million years ago, but their
evolution can be traced back 310 million years when synap-

sids first branched from amniotes [1]. Two subclasses of
mammals evolved, the prototherians and therians. Prototheria are monotremes, mammals that lay eggs; extant species
include the platypus and enchidnas. Theria are mammals that
bear live young; they are divided into the infraclasses Metatheria or marsupials - which include kangaroos and opossums and the more common Eutheria or placental mammals which include, for example, humans, dogs, mice, rats, and
bovine species. Figure 1 shows the mammalian phylogenetic

arose within 2.4 million years of each other.

tree with approximate divergence times [2,3]. Of the mammalian species listed, high coverage genomic data are available for the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), a
prototherian, the opossum (Monodelphis domestica), a
metatherian, and a number of placental mammals, including
human (Homo sapiens), rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse
(Mus musculus), dog (Canis familiaris), and now bovine (Bos
taurus).

Bos taurus than in other species, resulting in extensive milk
proteome data, milk production quantitative trait loci (QTL),
and over 100,000 mammary-related bovine expressed
sequence tags (ESTs).

The reproductive strategy, developmental requirements of
the young, and environment of the maternal-infant pair are
thought to drive variation in milk composition among species. Platypus and opossum neonates are embryonic in
appearance and dependent on milk for growth and immunological protection during the equivalent of the fetal period in
placental mammals [4,5]. In contrast, placental mammals
have relatively longer gestation and shorter lactation periods.
These reproductive strategies directly impact milk composition as the immature monotreme and marsupial young have
different needs with regard to growth, development, and
adaptive immunity. Other aspects of the reproductive strategy, such as the length of the lactation period and the maternal nutritional strategy, can also impact milk composition.
For example, mammals that fast or feed little during lactation
produce milks low in sugar but high in fat to minimize energy
and water demands while sustaining nutrient transfer to the
young [6]. The data in Table 1 illustrate that even the gross
macronutrient composition of milk can be highly variable
among species.
Because bovine milk is a major human food and agro-economical product, comparison of bovine milk with the milk of
other species in the context of the bovine genome sequence is
important not only to improve our understanding of mammary evolution but also of bovine milk production and
human nutrition. The importance of bovine milk consumption to humans is underscored by the domestication of cattle
and the convergent evolution of lactase persistency in diverse
human populations [7]. The availability of the bovine genome
sequence provides unique opportunities to investigate milk
and lactation. Lactation has been studied more extensively in

Volume 10, Issue 4, Article R43

In the present study, we identified the bovine lactation
genome in silico and examined its content and organization.
Utilizing the genomes of the seven mammals listed above and
in Table 1, we investigated gene loss and duplication, phylogeny, sequence conservation, and evolution of milk and mammary genes. Given the conspicuous absence of some known
abundant proteins, such as beta-lactoglobulin and whey
acidic protein, in the milk of some species [8], we hypothesized that variation in milk composition resides in part in variation in the milk protein genome. We show that gene
duplication and genomic rearrangement contribute to
changes in the milk protein gene complement of Bos taurus
and other species. Although the casein proteins are highly
divergent across mammalian milks [9,10], we report that milk
and mammary genes are more highly conserved, on average,
than other genes in the bovine genome. Our findings illustrate the importance of lactation for the survival of mammalian species and suggest that we must look more deeply,
perhaps into the non-coding regions of the genome that regulate milk protein gene expression, to understand the species-specificity of milk composition. Among mammals, we
find milk proteins that are most divergent have nutritional
and immunological functions, whereas the least divergent
milk protein genes have functions that are important for the
formation and secretion of mammalian milk. High conservation of milk fat globule membrane protein genes among the
mammalian genomes suggests that the secretory process for
milk production was firmly established more than 160 million
years ago.

Results and discussion
Milk and mammary gene sets
Two proteome studies of bovine milk [11,12] were used to
derive a milk protein gene set of 197 unique genes (see 'Collection of the milk protein set' in Materials and methods).

Using 94,136 bovine mammary ESTs, mammary gene sets
were created to represent the following developmental stages
or conditions: virgin, 3,889 genes; pregnancy, 1,383 genes;
lactation, 3,111 genes; involution, 867 genes; and mastitis,
840 genes (see 'Collection of the mammary gene sets' in
Materials and methods). In total, 6,469 genes are constituents of one or more of these mammary gene sets, suggesting
that one-quarter of all predicted genes are expressed in the
mammary gland at some point during the lactation cycle.
Genes from the milk protein and mammary gene sets are
present on all 29 bovine autosomes and on the X chromosome
(Figure 2).

modulate local inflammation following bacterial colonization
in the neonate gut [13,14]. Enrichment of the GO term 'calcium ion binding' was expected as many milk proteins are
known to bind calcium, a mineral required in abundance by
the growing neonate.

The milk protein gene set is the most extensive curation to
date of genes that give rise to milk proteins, the functions of
which have not yet been comprehensively studied. To gain
insight into the possible molecular functions of milk proteins,
the milk protein gene set was analyzed for enriched molecular
function Gene Ontology (GO) terms (see Materials and methods). Four significant, minimally redundant molecular function GO terms were identified: 'GTPase activity,' 'GTP
binding,' 'pattern recognition receptor activity,' and 'calcium
ion binding.' More than 30 milk proteins that were previously
isolated in the milk fat globule membrane [11,12] were associated with 'GTPase activity' or 'GTP binding'. GTPases are
known to be involved in numerous secretory processes, and
for this reason, it seems likely that these proteins have a role
in assembly and secretion of the milk fat globule and possibly
other milk components. The 'pattern recognition receptor
activity' GO term was enriched due to the presence in milk of
the cell surface and immune recognition components CD14
[GenBank:NM_174008], TLR2 [GenBank:NM_174197],
TLR4 [GenBank:NM_174198], and DMBT1 [GenBank:S78981]. These proteins are involved in the activation
of the innate immune system when they associate with cells.
Further, the soluble forms of CD14 and TLR2, which can act
as decoy receptors for microbial pathogens, could potentially

Milk is traditionally thought of as a food that provides the
neonate with nutrients and some immune protection, such as
that provided by immunoglobulins. Prior research also suggests that various milk proteins are resistant to digestion by
gastric proteases at physiological pH [15] and that intact or
partially intact milk proteins may either express their functions in the neonatal intestinal tract or may be absorbed and
act on other organs [16]. To understand what signaling might
be possible if milk proteins remain partially or wholly undigested, the milk protein gene set was interrogated for
enriched pathway annotations (see 'Pathway analysis' in
Materials and methods). The milk protein gene set contains
elements of two marginally significant pathways that lead to
activation of PPARalpha and LXR, two nuclear receptors
involved in sensing nutrients and modifying metabolic
responses at the level of gene transcription. Milk proteins that
are associated with the LXR/RXR activation pathway include
the cell surface or secreted molecules CD14 [GenBank:
NM_174008], CD36 [GenBank:NM_174010], TLR4 [GenBank:NM_174198], and MSR1 [GenBank:NM_001113240],

APOE [GenBank:NM_173991] and the lipid synthesis
enzymes ACACA [GenBank:NM_174224] and FASN [GenBank:NM_001012669]. Those associated with the PPARalpha/RXRalpha activation pathway include the cell surface
molecule CD36 [GenBank:NM_174010], the endoplasmic
reticulum protein disulphide isomerase PDIA3 [GenBank:NM_174333], the apolipoprotein APOA1 [GenBank:NM_174242], the transcription factor STAT5B

involved in lipid synthesis, GPD2 [GenBank:NM_00110029
6] and FASN [GenBank:NM_001012669]. It is likely that the
products of these genes, which are well known to be active at
metabolic control points in many organs, are active in the
mammary gland and then enter the milk via cytoplasmic crescents in the milk fat globules. Keenan and Patton [17] noted
that cytoplasmic sampling, as part of milk fat globule formation, is present in all species examined to date, including
humans, and that such evolutionary persistence suggests possible benefits for mother or offspring. Further research will be
needed to determine whether these proteins are present in
milk at sufficient quantities to have a physiological effect in
the neonate.

fat yield QTL with 15.4%, protein yield QTL with 21.1%, fat
percentage QTL with 12.3%, and protein percentage QTL with
33.6% of the genome assembly. The densities of genes within
these QTL are very similar for each milk trait, with between
9.1 and 10.1 genes per million base pairs. Meanwhile, there
are 8.4 genes per million base pairs in regions that do not
overlap with any milk trait QTL. Given the gene density and
number of QTL associated with each trait, each individual
QTL is expected to contain between 105 and 127 genes.

All mammary gene sets were interrogated for enrichment of
GO terms or pathway annotations, but the results did not further our knowledge of mammary biology. Consistent with our
previous study [18], current GO term annotations were
incomplete or generally out of context when applied to the
mammary gland. Although bovine EST data indicate that
more than 3,000 genes are expressed in the lactating mammary gland, a mere 22 genes are currently annotated with the
GO term 'lactation.'

Volume 10, Issue 4, Article R43

Lemay et al. R43.5

To identify candidate genes within milk trait QTL, the lactation mammary gene set was intersected with the milk trait
QTL. Between 12.5% and 13.7% of the genes within milk trait
QTL are expressed during lactation. In other words, within a
single milk trait QTL, between 13.9 and 17.1 genes are
expected to be expressed during lactation. Thus, although the
set of milk trait QTL reduces the search space for milk trait
effectors by less than one order of magnitude, the use of
expression data can contribute considerably towards the
identification of candidate genes. Genes within milk trait QTL
that are expressed in the mammary gland during lactation are
listed in Additional data files 11-16. Milk trait effectors are
likely to be near these candidate genes.

Genome organization of milk and mammary genes
Bovine milk production QTL
Milk trait QTL delineate gene regions that harbor genes or
cis-acting elements that are responsible for the milk trait phenotype. The dairy industry has invested enormous resources
into the identification of these QTL for milk production traits
in bovine, particularly milk yield, protein yield, fat yields, protein percentage, and fat percentage. Reviewing the literature,
238 milk trait QTL were identified for these five traits in 59
references (Additional data files 8-9). Of the 238 QTL, 63
were reported with flanking markers having a median interval size of approximately 17 million base pairs. Following a
previously established method [19], the 175 remaining QTL
that were reported with only a single peak marker were
assigned this median interval size. Some QTL were reported
for more than one milk trait; thus, these QTL span only 168
unique genome locations. These milk trait QTL span all 29
autosomes (Figure 2), with the highest densities of QTL
occurring on chromosomes 27, 6, 20, and 14 (Additional data
file 10). Possible differences in genetic architecture are most
obvious between fat and protein percentage traits, where fat
percentage QTL are present on fewer chromosomes with
lower QTL density and protein percentage QTL are present on
all but two chromosomes, most with higher QTL density
(Additional data file 10). Fat percentage may be controlled by
relatively fewer genes each with larger effects, whereas protein percentage may be controlled by far more genes each
with smaller effects.
The milk trait QTL provide a very coarse map of genomic
areas of interest that cover nearly half of the bovine assembly.
Milk yield QTL overlap with 19.5% of the genomic assembly,

Studies of eukaryotic genomes have demonstrated that genes
with coordinated expression or shared ancestry appear in
clusters across the genome [20]. Given that the clustering of
the casein milk protein genes is essential to their coordinated
transcription in the lactating mammary gland [9,10], the
arrival of the bovine genome sequence provides the opportunity to discover other gene clusters relevant to milk, lactation,
or mammary biology. A genome-wide search was conducted
for genomic intervals of 500 kb and greater that are statistically enriched with genes from the milk protein and mammary gene sets (see 'Genomic localization analysis' in
Materials and methods). Among these gene sets, 190 nonoverlapping statistically significant clusters were identified:
four unique clusters in the milk protein gene set and 54, 60,
30, and 19 unique clusters in the pregnancy, lactation, involution, and mastitis mammary gene sets, respectively. Spreadsheets of all significant gene clusters are available in
Additional data files 17 and 18.
The four significant milk protein gene clusters comprised the
immunoglobulin genes, casein genes, fibrinogen genes, and
genes that encode milk fat globule proteins. Because it is
known that immunoglobulins, casein genes, and fibrinogen
genes are each clustered in mammalian genomes
[9,10,21,22], this is a good verification of methodology. The
cluster of genes that encode milk fat globule proteins contains
FASN [GenBank:NM_001012669], ARHGDIA [GenBank:NM_176650], and P4HB [GenBank:NM_174135].
However, P4HB has only been isolated in mastitic milk [11].
By manual inspection, we found that these genes also cluster
in the human, mouse, and other mammalian genomes. Based

on EST data, other genes in this genomic region are expressed
at various times in the mammary gland. Aside from these four
clusters, there does not appear to be a preponderance of putative regulatory modules among genes in the milk protein gene
set. Whereas only 6.6% of the milk protein genes were within
a milk protein-specific cluster, 27.9% were within one of the
mammary gene set clusters. Therefore, it is likely that milk
protein genes are regulated along with other mammary genes
independent of the function or cellular localization of the proteins they encode.

one or more of the placental mammals were manually curated
(see 'Curation of milk protein orthologs' in Materials and
methods). K-means clustering of these curated milk protein
gene orthologs followed by seriation within each cluster
yielded the heatmap shown in Figure 3. Three major trends
were identified: single copy of the gene across Mammalia;
gene not found in platypus; and duplication after platypus.

Next, we examined whether genes were clustered according
to developmental stage, but found there were no gross differences in gene clustering using this parameter. Between 24%
and 30% of the genes from each mammary gene set - virgin,
pregnancy, lactation, and involution - were within one of the
other mammary set clusters. Likewise, 28% of the genes from
the mastitis mammary gene set fell within a mammary cluster. Thus, mammary genes are not differentially clustered by
developmental stage or condition.
Genes may be clustered due to shared evolution, as duplicated genes are often co-localized in the genome. In our
study, a significant cluster required a minimum of three genes
that were not paralogs. When the paralog requirement was
removed, only seven additional unique clusters of triplets or
greater were identified. Significant clusters with more than
one paralog appear to be confined to the major histocompatibility complex region on bovine chromosome 23. These data
suggest that recent duplication is not a common driver of
clustered mammary genes in the bovine genome.
In summary, the milk protein genes generally do not form
clusters with each other but do appear to form clusters with
other mammary genes. Milk protein genes may be regulated
along with other lactation genes without regards to the final
destination of the gene product. As mammary genes are generally clustered neither by developmental stage nor due to
recent duplication, it appears that the need for co-expression
in the mammary gland is the denominator for co-localization
rather than co-functionality or shared ancestry. This organization in clusters of co-expressed mammary genes might be
constrained by unidentified distal cis-acting elements [20],
chromatin conformation [23], or coordinately expressed
micro-RNAs [24].

Milk and mammary gene copy number trends in
mammals
Gene copy number contributes to genetic diversity both
between and within species. Here, copy numbers of bovine
milk protein genes were determined in the bovine, human,
mouse, rat, dog, opossum, and platypus genomes using
orthologs generated for all bovine consensus gene models
(see 'Orthology delineation' in Materials and methods).
Genes from the milk protein gene set that were uniquely
duplicated in B. taurus and those that were missing copies in

The absence of a milk or mammary gene in platypus or duplication after platypus (Figure 3) may be due to the expansion
of gene families in the common therian ancestor. However,
some of these genes may not be truly missing in the platypus
genome, but may be undetectable by our methods due to
incomplete or incorrect assembly of the platypus genome,
lower sequence identity, or the inherent bias created by defin-

Most milk protein genes are either present as a single copy in each
mammalian genome or as a single copy in all therian genomes. Duplicated
genes are expanded after platypus in either a general or a species- or
clade-specific manner. Black squares indicate that the gene was not found
in a particular species, yellow-green squares indicate a single copy of the
gene, and red squares indicate two or more copies of the gene. Brighter
red squares indicate higher copy numbers.

ing milk and mammary genes in the bovine genome. The
identification of platypus orthologs of other genes in the
bovine genome would also be affected by these biases; therefore, we next compared milk and mammary gene copy
number trends to those genome-wide.

thelial cells of human breast tissue [37], neither its presence
nor that of an apparent LGB-like pseudogene [GenBank:AH011480] that flanks the PAEP gene [GenBank:NM_001018049] has been verified in human milk. We
found that the LGB-like and PAEP genes are flanked by
GLT6D1 [GenBank:NM_182974] and OBP2A [GenBank:NM_014582] in both the human and bovine genomes.
This observation, combined with the fact that the baboon has
both a PAEP gene [38] and a LGB gene [33], suggests that the
primate genes arose by duplication of an ancestral gene
before the Laurasiatheria and Eurochontoglires diverged. We
were unable to find this region in the rodent or rabbit
genomes, and an evolutionary break point is present in mouse
and rat in this region [39], suggesting that these genes may
have been lost after the split between primates and glires.
Although the presence of LGB in laurasiathian milk and its
absence in rodent milks has an obvious genetic basis, we cannot yet explain the absence of LGB in human milk.

For each major trend shown in Figure 3, rates of occurrence
among the uncurated orthologs of the milk protein and lactation mammary gene sets were compared with the orthologs of
all bovine consensus gene models using a hypergeometric distribution to determine statistical significance. More bovine
milk protein orthologs were found in all six studied mammalian genomes than would be expected given the rate at which
other bovine orthologs were found in these genomes (P <
0.0001). Genes expressed during bovine lactation were also
more likely than other genes to have orthologs in all of the
mammalian genomes (P < 0.0001). In other words, milk and
mammary genes are more likely than other genes to be found
in all mammals. This result might be explained in part by an
increased power to detect more conserved genes (see 'Conservation of milk and mammary genes in mammals' below).
There were also statistically fewer lactation genes missing in
the platypus (P < 0.005) and opossum genomes (P < 2.2 × 1020); however, the number of milk protein genes missing in
these genomes did not differ from the genome-wide rate.
Finally, more milk protein and lactation genes were duplicated after platypus compared with the whole genome (P <
0.001 and P < 0.03, respectively). Together, these data support the essentiality of milk and mammary genes in Mammalia as well as suggest the possibility for expanded functionality
in marsupials and placental mammals.
Milk protein gene copy number variation may potentially
contribute to the diversity of milk composition. Ortholog
analysis indicated that the gene for beta-lactoglobulin (LGB),
one of the most abundant proteins in milk, is duplicated in the
dog and bovine genomes (Figure 3). In the bovine genome,
this gene is located at the position of a previously predicted
pseudogene [25]. It has similarity to LGB-II genes in the
horse and cat [26-29]. The similarity of this second gene to
LGB-II in the horse, cat, and dog suggests that the LGB duplication existed in the common ancestor of the laurasiathians
(Figure 1). Using two different primer pairs, we were unable
to identify the LGB-II transcript in bovine mammary tissue
samples using RT-PCR (see Additional data file 22 for
details). It is likely that the duplicated LGB gene is not
expressed in the bovine mammary gland and that the presence of this duplication does not influence the concentration
of LGB in bovine milk.
LGB is apparently not present in human or mouse milk [30],
although LGB-like proteins have been isolated from the milk
of other primates [31-33]. A human protein, progestagenassociated endometrial protein (PAEP), has significant
homology to the bovine and equine LGB-II-like genes [29,3436]. Although PAEP expression has been detected in the epi-

Some immune components of milk are uniquely duplicated in
certain species or clades. For example, SAA3 [GenBank:NM_181016], which is duplicated in the bovine and dog
genomes (Figure 3), is thought to be involved in mucin induction in the gut [40,41] and a human analog, SAA1, functions
as an opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria [42]. The Cathelicidin gene family is greatly expanded in the bovine, opossum,
and platypus genomes, with 10, 8, and 12 copies, respectively
[43-45], but some of the opossum and platypus orthologs
were not found in our automated analysis due to their high
heterogeneity. Expansions in this gene family may reflect
increased exposure to bacteria at epithelial surfaces in these
species. Our results show that the CD36 gene [GenBank:NM_174010], which encodes a scavenger receptor, has
duplications in the B. taurus and rat genomes. Beta-2microglobulin [GenBank:NM_173893] has a second copy in
the bovine genome and may also have a duplicate in the platypus genome. This gene encodes one of two chains in the IgG
transporter FcRn, which transfers IgG molecules across epithelial cells [46]. Other variations in milk protein gene copy
number (Figure 3) potentially give rise to diversity in milk
protein composition.
Milk protein gene loss does not appear to be a common occurrence. Of the bovine milk protein genes with an ortholog identified in the platypus genome (Figure 3), all but ten genes
were found in all of the other studied mammalian genomes.
However, because the bovine milk proteome is used as the
reference, the loss of some milk protein genes in placental
mammals relative to the monotreme and marsupial mammals may have been missed in our analysis. For example,
whey acidic protein has been identified in the milk of many
mammals such as mouse, rat, opossum, and platypus, but it is
absent in bovine milk due to a frameshift mutation in the
whey acidic protein gene [47]. A full proteomic analysis of the
milk samples from extant monotremes and marsupials will be
needed to identify gene loss in placental mammals.

Our analysis of milk protein gene copy numbers has several
other limitations. First, the mammalian orthologs of bovine
consensus gene models derived on a genome-wide basis (see
'Orthology delineation' in Materials and methods) may be
inaccurate for genes in which the bovine gene model is incorrect or may be incomplete when orthologs are too divergent to
be detected by this method. Although we attempted to overcome these limitations by manually curating milk protein
gene orthologs, the analysis is only as good as the available
genome sequences, and some duplications and deletions may
have been missed due to errors and gaps in the genome
assemblies. Directed sequencing will be needed to confirm
specific results. However, we can generally conclude that
there is considerable copy number variation of milk protein
genes that may contribute to the taxonomic diversity of milk
composition.

ogeny (Figure 1). Rodent milk proteins are more divergent
from human milk proteins than are dog and bovine milk proteins despite the fact that the rodent and human common
ancestor is more recent. To further test the relationships of
human milk proteins with those of other taxa, pairwise percent identity (PID) was calculated between the human protein and its putative ortholog for the set of single copy
orthologs present in all seven taxa. Average pairwise PIDs for
the milk protein gene set confirm that human milk proteins
are closest to dog, followed by bovine, then the rodents, then
opossum and platypus (Figure 5). This observation is not
unique to milk proteins as it is also true on a genome-wide
basis [43]. It has been proposed that rodent proteins are more
divergent from human than are bovine proteins because
rodents have a faster reproductive rate and are, therefore,
evolving more quickly [43]. Although rodent milk proteins
may appear more distant from human milk proteins than are
bovine milk proteins, whether these differences have functional importance is a matter for future scientific inquiry.

Taxonomic relationships of the milk protein genes
To understand the relationships of the milk proteins between
mammalian taxa, a consensus tree of those milk proteins with
single copy orthologs in the human, mouse, rat, dog, bovine,
opossum, and platypus genomes was constructed using a
super-alignment of the concatenated sequences (see 'Consensus tree construction' in Materials and methods). An
unrooted radial tree depicting the relationships of the milk
protein sequences (Figure 4) differs from the accepted phyl-

strictly conserved structure.

distributions' in Materials and methods). However, when the
sample size was increased by individually assessing pairwise
PIDs between human and each of the seven taxa, requiring in
each case that orthologs be single copies only in bovine and
the two taxa being compared, milk protein sequences were
statistically more conserved between human and other mammals than the products of other genes in the genome (see
Additional data file 20 for details). The human-bovine distribution is most dramatically different from the whole genome
as a full quarter of the set of the 137 milk protein genes with
single copies in these two genomes are very highly conserved
with a pairwise PID of 97.5% or greater.
Of the average pairwise PID distributions of the mammary
gene sets in Figure 6, all are significantly different from the
genome-wide distribution. The means of their distributions
also differ from the genome-wide mean. As a group, mammary genes of every developmental stage and condition
appear to be more conserved across Mammalia, on average,
than other genes in the genome.
To discover which milk proteins are most conserved in mammals, the average pairwise PIDs among the seven mammalian
taxa were computed for all genes from the milk protein gene
set with single copy orthologs in the manually curated set (see
'Curation of milk protein orthologs' in Materials and methods). The top 25 most conserved milk proteins across all
seven mammals are listed in Table 2. These proteins have

Nearly all of the highly conserved milk proteins (Table 2) are
found in the milk fat globule membrane proteome. GO analysis of these proteins yields four enriched terms: 'GTPase
activity,' 'GTP binding,' 'small GTPase mediated signal transduction,' and 'intracellular protein transport.' Twelve of the
proteins listed in Table 2 are annotated with one or more of
these GO terms. GTPases are known to be involved in the exocytotic pathway by which proteins are trafficked from the
Golgi compartment to the plasma membrane. Further, GBB1

and RAB3C [GenBank:NM_001046606], are annotated with
the GO term 'secretory pathway.' The finding that so many of
these secretion-related proteins are associated with the milk
fat globule membrane suggests they may also be involved in
the highly specialized process by which the milk fat globule is
secreted or that the exocytotic and lipid secretion pathways
intersect at some point during the secretion process. Because
the conserved proteins listed in Table 2 are related to the
generic molecular function of secretion, it seems highly likely
that they facilitate the secretion of milk lipid.
Conservation of mammary genes relative to other genes in the
genome suggests hypotheses about the evolution of milk production. First, conservation of mammary genes involved in all
developmental stages supports the hypothesis that, at the
genetic level, the basic biological transformation of the virgin
gland through pregnancy, lactation, and involution is conserved among all mammals, and occurred by co-opting existing structures and developmental pathways. Second, many of
the most highly conserved proteins found in milk are constituents of the milk fat globule membrane and are known to be
part of the secretory process. High conservation of these
genes between platypus, opossum, and the placental mammals indicates that molecular mechanisms of secretion were
already in place 160 million years ago.

Divergent milk protein genes in mammals
Because the technique for ortholog detection relies on a minimum threshold of conservation, orthologs of many of the
more divergent proteins could not be found in the platypus or
opossum genomes. Therefore, to determine which proteins in
milk are most divergent in mammals, average PIDs were

computed across only the five placental mammals. The 25
most divergent milk proteins across placental mammals are
presented in Table 3. These milk proteins are primarily
secreted or cell-surface proteins with structures that are
apparently not constrained by function relative to other proteins in milk. Four GO terms associated with these proteins
are enriched: 'pattern binding,' 'response to other organism,'
'inflammatory response,' and 'extracellular space.'
The greatest inter-species divergence among milk protein
sequences occurs with those proteins that are most abundant
in milk (caseins, alpha-lactalbumin (LALBA)), those most
abundant in plasma (fetuin, albumin), and with those contributing to immunity. The casein proteins are the most divergent of the milk proteins, with an average pairwise PID of only
44-55% across placental mammals. Nutritionally, the caseins
provide the suckling neonate with a source of amino acids and
with highly bioavailable calcium. Additionally, peptides
derived from partially digested caseins have potential antimicrobial, immune-modulating, and other bioactive properties. The fact that the caseins are the most divergent of the

milk proteins suggests that the nutritional and immunological functions of these proteins do not particularly constrain
their amino acid sequence and structure.
The sequence divergence of LALBA is surprising given its
essentiality to the synthesis of lactose, the primary source of
digestible carbohydrate. LALBA encodes a protein that forms
the regulatory subunit of the lactose synthase heterodimer.
However, additional functions of LALBA have emerged.
When human LALBA is partially unfolded and bound to oleic
acid, it functions as an apoptotic factor that kills tumor cells
and immature cells, but not healthy differentiated cells [49].
Thus, it is possible that this variant of LALBA protects the gut
of the human neonate. Furthermore, the apoptotic capabilities of LALBA appear to be utilized in the regulation of involution of the mammary gland. A recent study suggests that
Cape fur seals escape apoptosis and involution of the mammary gland during long foraging trips because they lack the
LALBA protein [50]. While lactose synthesis may be a common essential function, it appears that it does not overly constrain the sequence divergence of LALBA. The sequence

divergence of LALBA may rather be related to the potential of
this protein to modulate species-specific strategies related to

milk, CD14 and TLR2 are present in soluble forms and may
neutralize pathogens by binding to them as decoy receptors
[13,14]. MUC1 prevents the binding of pathogenic bacteria to
epithelial cells in vitro (R.L. Tellam, personal communication). Our finding that the most divergent milk protein genes

are those that confer immunity presumably reflects a flexibility to confront a wide variety of pathogen challenges.

Evolution of milk and mammary genes along the
bovine lineage
To investigate the selective constraints on the evolution of
bovine milk and mammary genes, the rate of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) was estimated
for proteins in each gene set using bovine genes and their
putative orthologs in the human and mouse genomes (see
'Evolutionary analysis along the bovine lineage' in Materials
and methods for details). The average dN/dS ratio of the genes
from the milk protein and mammary gene sets (Table 4) was
significantly below the genome average (Mann-Whitney U
test, P < 0.05), indicating that milk and mammary genes are
subject to more stringent selective constraint than other
genes in the bovine genome.
Given the taxonomic diversity of milk composition, we
expected that the processes of lactation would be under

stronger selective pressure than the genes that give rise to
proteins in milk. However, the average dN/dS of the milk protein gene set was similar to that of the lactation mammary
gene set (Table 4). This result suggests that species-specific
variation in milk composition is primarily due to mechanisms
other than milk and mammary protein sequence variation.
Next, milk and mammary genes were evaluated for positive
selection. A gene is inferred to be subject to positive selection
when dN/dS is significantly greater than 1. Of the 6,530 genes
from the milk protein and mammary gene sets, only two
bovine genes with dN/dS >1 were significant under the likelihood ratio test (see 'Evolution analysis under the bovine lineage' in Materials and methods): ADP-ribosyltransferase 4
(ART4) [GenBank:AJ291442] and prenylcysteine oxidase 1
(PCYOX1) [GenBank:NM_001105474]. The ART4 gene product, which has previously been reported to be subject to positive selection in cattle [51], is an erythrocyte protein that
carries antigens to the Dombrock blood group. PCYOX1 produces a protein that degrades a variety of prenylcysteines.
Using RT-PCR to determine PCYOX1 and ART4 mRNA levels
in alveolar mammary tissue from virgin, prepartum, lactating, involuting and dried-off cows (Additional data file 22),
we found that PCYOX1 and ART4 are not differentially
expressed in these tissues. The accelerated evolution of these
genes may be unrelated to mammary biology.
Two abundant milk protein genes, beta-casein (CSN2) [GenBank:NM_181008] and kappa-casein (CSN3) [GenBank:NM_174294], were among those with dN/dS >1, but
they were not statistically significant under the likelihood
ratio test (see 'Evolution analysis along the bovine lineage' in
Materials and methods). The requirement that the entire
gene shows statistical evidence of positive selection may be
too stringent. Evidence of positive selection within the family
Bovidae has been previously detected in a 34-codon region of
CSN3 [52]. Further site-specific evolutionary analysis of the
casein genes may be warranted.
Despite the domestication of cattle for milk production,
breeding regimes have not caused the apparent accelerated
evolution of even a single milk protein or member of the lac-

tation mammary gene set. Furthermore, milk and mammary
genes are undergoing stronger purifying selection than other
genes in the bovine genome. It has previously been theorized
that the evolution of the mammary gland has been subject to
forces that maximize the survival of the mother-child pair
[53]. Because all components in the milk are produced at the
expense of the mother, it can be argued that few superfluous
components would survive evolution. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis. Genes encoding milk components and other genes expressed in the mammary gland were
found to be under significant negative selection compared to
the whole genome, highlighting the essentiality of milk in
mammalian evolution.

Conclusions

The availability of the B. taurus genome sequence assembly
marks the beginning of a new era for the study of milk and
mammary biology. Using this assembly, we identified 197
unique milk protein genes and over 6,000 mammary-related
genes distributed across all bovine chromosomes. Intersecting these genes with 238 curated milk-trait QTL, we reduced
the search space for milk trait effectors by more than an order
of magnitude.
Comparing genes of seven mammalian species, we found that
more milk and mammary genes are present in all mammals
and more were duplicated after the common ancestor with
platypus than other genes in the bovine genome. We also
found that, on average, milk and mammary genes are more
conserved than other genes among mammals and are evolving more slowly than other genes in the bovine genome. The
higher conservation of these genes, as well as the strong negative selection and absence of positive selection, supports the
hypothesis that the evolution of milk has been constrained to
maximize the survival of both mother and offspring.
Our findings also suggest that the species-specific variation in
milk composition is primarily due to mechanisms other than
protein sequence variation. Variation in copy number of the
milk protein genes may contribute to the taxonomic diversity
of milk composition, as exemplified by duplications of some

immune-related milk proteins. Additional mechanisms, such
as transcriptional and translational regulation of genes
expressed in the mammary gland as well as other organs
involved in energy partitioning may be larger contributors to
milk composition variation. In future studies, non-coding
regions of the genome, particularly those with putative regulatory function, will need to be explored as potential sources
of species-specific variation in milk composition.

secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin). In total, the milk
protein gene set consists of 197 unique genes that encode proteins known to be in bovine milk (Additional data files 1 and
2).

We found that mammary genes are co-localized in the bovine
genome, implying co-regulation of expression in mammary
epithelial cells. Our study of the most complete milk proteome to date demonstrates that milk proteins do not generally cluster with each other, but do cluster with mammary
genes, and therefore are likely co-regulated. The casein proteins are therefore unique among the milk protein genes in
both their divergence between species and in their genomic
organization.
Across the seven mammalian genomes, we found that the
most divergent milk proteins are known to have nutritional
and immunological properties, whereas the most conserved
are within the milk fat globule proteome. The high conservation of genes apparently involved in milk fat globule secretion
suggests that the cellular anatomy of secretion may be conserved across species and likely shared among secretory
organs. Likewise, the higher conservation of mammary genes,
compared with other genes, suggests that the ontogeny of the
mammary gland occurred by co-opting existing structures
and developmental pathways. Lactation may be less than 200
million years old, but its biological roots are far more ancient.

Materials and methods
Collection of the milk protein gene set
Amino acid sequences corresponding to the protein identifiers reported in two proteomic studies [11,12] were collected
from SwissProt, UniRef, TREMBL, and NCBI databases. A
custom track of the bovine consensus gene models [43], or
'GLEAN' models, was created and uploaded to the University
of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser [54]. The
milk protein amino acid sequences were aligned against the
bovine genome draft 3.1, also known as 'Aug. 2006,' using
BLAT [55]. The best scoring hits were manually reviewed
against the custom GLEAN track in the UCSC Genome
Browser. From the protein sequence identifiers in the Smolenski and Reinhardt studies [11,12], 189 unique milk proteins were mapped to GLEAN IDs. The GLEAN IDs
corresponding to the six most abundant milk proteins, alphaS1-casein, alpha-S2-casein, beta-casein, kappa-casein, LGB,
and LALBA, were also added to this gene set. Additionally, a
script was written to identify genes in the bovine annotation
database annotated by the lactation group that did not
already exist in our milk protein gene set. Those genes were
then manually screened for proteins known to be in milk. Two
additional proteins were identified: lactotransferrin and

Collection of the mammary gene sets
Bovine mammary gland EST libraries available through the
NCBI EST database [56] were surveyed to define conditionor developmental stage-specific mammary gene sets.
Descriptions of the EST libraries used as well as reasons for
exclusion of other EST libraries are given in Additional data
file 21. The EST libraries used include the BMGA, BMLB,
BMPA, BMUA, and BMVB libraries developed by AgResearch
Ltd and Genesis Ltd in New Zealand as well as the FNM and
FLM libraries developed by ViaLactia Biosciences Ltd in New
Zealand. Custom tracks for the UCSC Genome and Table
Browsers [54,57] were created for all GLEAN models from the
bovine genome project [43] and for all of these EST libraries.
The intersection filter of the UCSC Table Browser was used to
identify the GLEAN models that overlapped with ESTs in
these libraries. Mammary gene sets were defined as follows:
virgin = (BMVB or FNM); pregnancy = BMPA; lactation =
(BMGA or FLM); involution = BMLB; and mastitis = BMUA.
In total, these mammary gene sets contain 6,469 unique
genes derived from over 94,000 ESTs. Gene identifiers for the
genes that comprise each mammary gene set are given in the
spreadsheets of Additional data file 1. UCSC custom tracks of
these genes sets are provided in Additional data files 3-7.

Gene Ontology analysis
Bovine genes from the milk protein and mammary gene sets
were mapped to human orthologs using a three-way reciprocal best BLAST hit approach between human, mouse, and
bovine as implemented in the 'Ortholuge' program [58].
Using GO-Elite version 1.17 beta [59], the human orthologs of
milk and mammary genes were analyzed for over-represented GO terms compared with the full set of human
orthologs. GO-Elite calculates a Fisher's exact test z-score for
unique genes corresponding to a GO term from the user's
input list compared with the reference list. To calculate a Pvalue for each GO term, GO-Elite randomly selects the same
number of input genes or probe sets in the user's input gene
list from the reference list 2,000 times to determine the likelihood of obtaining a z-score greater than or equal to the
empirically derived z-score. To adjust for multiple hypothesis
testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg correction is used to calculate an adjusted P-value. GO-Elite determines the set of minimally redundant significant GO terms by examining the
scores and relative positions of all high-scoring terms within
the hierarchy to select those terms that maximally describe
the biology without removing valuable information. GO terms
with an adjusted P-value ≤ 0.05 were taken to be significant.

Pathway analysis
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis [60] was used to identify metabolic and signaling pathways that are over-represented by the

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R43

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/4/R43

Genome Biology 2009,

human orthologs of milk and lactation-related bovine genes
compared with the human orthologs of all of the genes from
the bovine consensus gene model (GLEAN) set. The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis library of canonical pathways includes
80 metabolic and 72 signaling pathways that have been incorporated from various resources and hand-curated. A Fischer's
exact test was used to calculate a P-value to determine the
probability that the enrichment of the canonical pathway with
the gene set of interest is explained by chance alone. In this
paper, this P-value is referred to as the unadjusted P-value.
Enriched pathways with an unadjusted P-value ≤ 0.05 and
associated with at least three genes of interest are referred to
as marginally significant. To improve the stringency of the
test, a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction
was applied to the unadjusted P-values with a custom R script
using the multtest library [61,62]. Pathways reported to be
statistically significant were those with a Benjamini and
Hochberg adjusted P-value ≤ 0.05.

orthologous groups were expanded by genes that are more
similar to each other within a proteome than to any gene in
any of the other species, and by very similar copies that share
over 97% sequence identity. The procedure was applied to the
initial bovine set of consensus gene models [43] and to the
longest transcript per gene of the Ensembl v.45 [65] gene sets
of human, mouse, rat, dog, opossum, and platypus.

Genomic localization analysis
The bovine genome was explored for clusters of milk and lactation-related genes that are more proximal to each other in
the genome than would be expected by chance. Using the
method developed by Salomonis et al. [63], 500 kb windows
on the genome that start in the same position as a gene were
tested as candidate co-location clusters. For each such candidate cluster, a list of genes that overlap the window was
assembled. Strand information was ignored, so that a gene
was considered to start at its lowest coordinate. Genomic
sequence not assembled to chromosomes was excluded.
For each of the milk protein and mammary gene sets, the statistically expected number of genes from the cluster in the
gene set was calculated, given the number of genes on chromosomes both inside and outside of the gene set and using a
hypergeometric distribution. Genes were considered to comprise a co-location cluster if there were at least three non-paralogous genes of interest in the region and the number of
candidate cluster genes from the gene sets was significantly
higher than chance (P ≤ 0.05). A multiple test correction
against all the clusters was performed with a Benjamini and
Hochberg false discovery rate [61,62]. When multiple clusters
contained the same genes or subsets of genes, the cluster with
the lowest P-value was reported.

Orthology delineation
Orthologs of the milk and mammary genes were filtered from
the whole genome ortholog set [43]. Briefly, groups of orthologous genes were automatically identified using a previously
employed strategy [64] that is based on all-against-all protein
sequence comparisons using the Smith-Waterman algorithm,
followed by clustering of best reciprocal hits from highest
scoring ones to 10-3 e-value cutoff for triangulating best reciprocal hits or 10-6 cutoff for unsupported best reciprocal hits,
and requiring a sequence alignment overlap of at least 30
amino acids across all members of a group. Furthermore, the

Curation of milk protein orthologs
Orthologs of milk protein genes (see 'Orthology delineation'
above) were curated manually if they were uniquely duplicated in B. taurus or missing copies in one or more of the placental mammals. Fifteen genes uniquely duplicated in B.
taurus were removed from the curated ortholog set for the
following reasons: four were pseudogenes - gene duplicates
without introns; four were not assembled on a chromosome
and, therefore, likely to represent reading of the same
sequence; and seven were a result of an assembly error or
poor GLEAN prediction. The pseudogenes identified were
those of PFN1 (GLEAN_02143), RAB18 (GLEAN_21462),
RAP1B (GLEAN_10112), and YWHAZ (GLEAN_11922). A
perfect duplicate of GAPDH (GLEAN_13969) that exists in
both Btau 3.1 and 4.0 assemblies was retained, but further
research is needed to determine if it is a true expansion. To
find missing orthologs of milk protein genes in placental
mammals, the Ensembl databases of those species with
orthologs not found by automated detection were searched
using BLAST and the bovine consensus gene and protein
sequences. Additional known orthologs were collected from
UniProt. In total, 15 erroneous duplicate genes and 37 missing orthologs were identified through manual curation. This
curated ortholog set is available in Additional data file 19.
For conservation analyses, amino acid sequences of bovine
genes annotated as erroneous in the bovine genome annotation database [66] were replaced with manually curated fulllength sequences from UniProt [67]. Replaced sequences are
indicated by the following accession format in Tables 2 and 3:
GLEAN_ID_ACCESSION where ACCESSION is the UniProt
accession for the replacement amino acid sequence and
GLEAN_ID is the bovine gene model identifier for the original sequence.

Milk protein gene copy clustering and visualization
Perl and shell scripts were written to create input files for the
clustering tool, Cluster version 2.20 [68]. A K-means clustering algorithm was applied in Cluster, and the resulting clusters were seriated using a multiple-fragment heuristic in
PermutMatrix [69]. Whether or not clustering was applied,
all heatmaps were seriated and visualized in PermutMatrix.

Consensus tree construction
Single copy ortholog identifiers of milk protein genes were
extracted from the whole genome set of orthologous clusters
(see 'Orthology delineation' in Materials and methods).
Amino acid sequences for these identifiers were downloaded

from the Ensembl database release 45 [70]. Multiple alignments of the milk proteins were constructed using MUSCLE
[71]. The multiple alignments were then concatenated into a
super-alignment that was used to create a maximum likelihood consensus tree with PhyML [72,73]. The tree was constructed based on the JTT model of amino acid sequence
evolution [74] with rates assumed to vary among sites according to a gamma distribution. Support for the tree's nodes is
given by 100 bootstraps.

Authors' contributions

Statistical analysis of PID distributions
A Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction (MannWhitney U) from the R programming language was used to
determine if the mean of the average PIDs across the seven
taxa of each milk and lactation gene set is statistically different from the whole genome. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine if the average PIDs of milk and
mammary genes are drawn from the same distribution as the
genome. Significance was determined by a P-value ≤ 0.05.

Evolution analysis along the bovine lineage
For this analysis only, putative orthology was assigned using
a three-way reciprocal best BLAST hit approach as implemented in the 'Ortholuge' program [58]. Ortholog sequences
for the caseins and alpha-lactalbumin were manually curated.
For each gene, dN/dS ratios were estimated from coding
sequence alignments of the human-mouse-bovine orthologs
by maximum likelihood using the codeml program from
PAMLv4 [75]. Two models were implemented to test the statistical significance of variable selective pressures on each lineage. Under the one-ratio model, which acts as the null model
(NSsites = 0, model = 0), each lineage was modeled to have
the same dN/dS ratio. The ratio is constrained between 0 and
1, and does not allow for the presence of positive selection.
The second model is a model of bovine-specific evolution,
where the bovine lineage was selected as the 'foreground' lineage and dN/dS was specifically allowed to vary unconstrained
on this lineage (model = 2). The two models were compared
by likelihood ratio test, calculated from the log likelihood
(lnL) values of both models. Twice the difference between
lnLmodel 2 and lnLone-ratio was compared with a chi-square distribution to obtain the P-values.
