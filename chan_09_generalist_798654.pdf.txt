Abstract
Background: Mesophotic corals (light-dependent corals in the deepest half of the photic zone at
depths of 30 - 150 m) provide a unique opportunity to study the limits of the interactions between
corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. We sampled Leptoseris spp. in
Hawaii via manned submersibles across a depth range of 67 - 100 m. Both the host and
Symbiodinium communities were genotyped, using a non-coding region of the mitochondrial ND5
intron (NAD5) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2), respectively.
Results: Coral colonies harbored endosymbiotic communities dominated by previously identified
shallow water Symbiodinium ITS2 types (C1_ AF333515, C1c_ AY239364, C27_ AY239379, and
C1b_ AY239363) and exhibited genetic variability at mitochondrial NAD5.
Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to examine genetic diversity in corals and their
endosymbiotic dinoflagellates sampled at the limits of the depth and light gradients for hermatypic
corals. The results reveal that these corals associate with generalist endosymbiont types commonly
found in shallow water corals and implies that the composition of the Symbiodinium community
(based on ITS2) alone is not responsible for the dominance and broad depth distribution of
Leptoseris spp. The level of genetic diversity detected in the coral NAD5 suggests that there is
undescribed taxonomic diversity in the genus Leptoseris from Hawaii.

Background
Images of colonial corals illuminated by sunlight are
dominant in the literature, in part because the majority of
hermatypic coral species are found in the top 30 m of the
photic zone [1]. This distribution reflects their reliance on

sunlight to support their photosynthetic symbiotic dinoflagellates, partners that reside within the gastrodermal
cells of all hermatypic corals. These dinoflagellates (genus
Symbiodinium) enhance calcification [2] and translocate
fixed carbon to the host where it is respired, and provides

the majority of the metabolic needs of the host [3]. This
intimate symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates
underpins the ecological success of corals in the nutrient
poor environments of tropical and subtropical marine
ecosystems [2].
Despite the general public perception that zooxanthellate
scleractinian corals are confined to shallow well-lit waters,
they exist throughout the entire euphotic zone, from full
sunlight to virtual darkness [4]. Zooxanthellate corals
have been recorded as deep as 165 m in the Pacific (Leptoseris hawaiiensis, Johnson Atoll [5]). In Hawaii, the hermatypic coral genus Leptoseris (Family Agariciidae) is
present at shallower depths, but deep water surveys found
Leptoseris dominates the mesophotic zone [6], where it is
apparently able to photosynthesize at light levels as low as
1% of the surface light intensity [6,7]. Previous deep water
surveys reported three dominant Leptoseris species from
Hawaii, L. hawaiiensis, L. yabei (previously unknown to
Hawaii), and an undescribed congeneric species, and
highlighted the need for more research on these mesophotic corals, particularly their systematics [6,7].
What underlies this extraordinary physiological range and
depth distribution of Leptoseris corals is unknown, but it is
likely that attributes and adaptations in both the endosymbiotic community and coral host are involved [8].
Examining this symbiotic association at the limits of the
photic zone may help us understand the interactions by
which reef corals cope with and adjust to extremes in the
environment. To begin to unravel the traits that allow Leptoseris spp. to exploit deep habitats, this study uses molecular genetic techniques to examine the interaction
between endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium and mesophotic corals in the genus Leptoseris.
Because of the difficulties inherent in collecting samples
below traditional SCUBA depths, this study represents
one of the first to examine the genetics of coral-algal associations at depths below 67 m in Hawaii.
Under different light regimes, coral hosts and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates maintain high rates of photosynthetic carbon translocation by photoacclimation. This
is achieved in some corals and their endosymbionts by
changes in the cellular concentrations of photosynthetic
pigment [9]. However, some symbiotic organisms (e.g.
Anemonia viridis [10]) show minimal changes in the photosynthetic pigments of their endosymbionts with
changes in light. These differences in physiological flexibility may reflect taxonomic differences in the composition or identity of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate
communities in the different coral species [11]. Although
it was initially believed that all corals hosted a single species of dinoflagellate (Symbiodinium microadriaticum. Freudenthal, 1962), molecular genetics have demonstrated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/21

that the genus Symbiodinium is extremely diverse and a single coral can host multiple, co-occurring endosymbiotic
strains [12,13]. Phylogenetic analyses of the genus Symbiodinium, based primarily on nuclear ribosomal genes,
have led to the current recognition of eight major lineages
or clades (A through H) [12,14] that are each partitioned
further into sub-cladal types, most frequently using the
quickly evolving internal transcribed spacer regions of the
ribosomal DNA operon [15].
To date, several patterns have been detected in the distribution of Symbiodinium taxa with depth (all studies ≤ 40
m), suggesting that light tolerance in Symbiodinium may
drive the distributions of host coral colonies [16-18]. Irradiance could therefore be an important determinant in
the distribution of Symbiodinium, with different Symbiodinium genotypes dominating the light environments for
which their photosynthetic characteristics are best
adapted [11,19].
Characterizing the Symbiodinium communities found in
mesophotic corals such as Leptoseris spp. is an obvious first
step in exploring how these corals are able to survive and
thrive at such depths. Given the unique environmental
characteristics and extremely low light levels in the mesophotic zone, we hypothesized that Leptoseris spp. from the
deep mesophotic (67-100 m) would host highly specialized and unique Symbiodinium types found only at these
depths.

Results
Six Symbiodinium genotypes were recovered and analyzed
from 15 deep (67-100 m) Leptoseris spp. samples. All were
phylogenetically identified as belonging to clade C. Four
of the sequences have been previously published (C1_
AF333515, C1c_ AY239364, C27_ AY239379, and C1b_
AY239363) and two were novel and differed from known
sequences by one or two base pairs (bp). These sequences
were named C1_v1a and C1_v1b, because they differed
from type C1 by one and two bp, respectively. C27
includes a seven bp indel, one bp indel, and three polymorphic sites (Figure 1A).
The 15 Leptoseris samples grouped as six mitochondrial
NAD5 haplotypes, identified by seven polymorphic sites
and named N1-N6 (Figure 1B).
The association between Symbiodinium type and host
mitochondrial haplotype was not random (Fisher's exact
test, 10,000 random permutations, p < 0.01). Leptoseris
corals with haplotypes N2, N4, N5, and N6 (n = 10 colonies in total) hosted endosymbiont communities dominated by Symbiodinium types C1 and C1c (Table 1).
Leptoseris corals with haplotype N1 (n = 4 colonies) had
more diverse Symbiodinium communities, harboring C1,

C1c, C1_v1a and C1_v1b. N1 was the only coral haplotype to associate with Symbiodinium types C1_v1a and
C1_v1b, which always co-occurred in a sample. Leptoseris
haplotype N3 (n = 1) was the only sampled coral that
hosted Symbiodinium type C27 (Table 1). It is important to
note here that Symbiodinium type C1 always co-occurred
with either one or a combination of the types C1c, C1b,
C1_v1a and C1_v1b. Because intragenomic variation at
the ITS-2 locus is high in Symbiodinium [20], one explanation would be that these co-occurring types represent
intragenomic variants within the same symbiont genome
rather than distinct genomes.

Pacific [21]. Although endosymbiont diversity will vary by
host species, this finding contradicts studies examining
endosymbiont diversity in corals sampled across shallower depth gradients (≤ 40 m) that observed partitioning
of Symbiodinium communities at the level of clade [16]
and ITS2 types [17,22] by depth, and therefore, evidence
for depth-based ecological function in symbionts. We
found Symbiodinium ITS2 types C1 and C1c in mesophotic
zooxanthellate corals. ITS2 type C1 has also been found in
two Leptoseris incrustans colonies sampled in Hawaii
between 10-20 m depth [21]. The generalist C1 Symbiodinium types are widely distributed both geographically
and environmentally [21].

Discussion
Leptoseris corals are some of the deepest-dwelling zooxanthellate corals in the world [7] and the biological
attributes that underpin the ability of this genus to thrive
across such a large depth range (as deep at 165 m [5]) are
central to our understanding of limits of the coral-endosymbiont interaction. Intracellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium are pivotal
to the success of corals as a group and are known to be taxonomically and physiologically diverse [12]. We thus
hypothesized that the Symbiodinium communities hosted
by Leptoseris spp. in the mesophotic zone might be highly
specialized to this environment and that this would be
apparent as a pattern in the distribution of Symbiodinium
types hosted by Leptoseris spp. over a depth gradient. Surprisingly, our data do not support this hypothesis; Leptoseris spp. sampled at 67 m and deeper, host Symbiodinium
types commonly found in shallow-water corals across the

Solar radiation is a major determinant of photosynthesis,
and therefore influences the amount of carbon translocated to the host, and the phototrophic contribution to
the animal [23]. When light declines with depth, without
photoacclimation, carbon fixation rates and the amount
of translocated carbon declines [23]. Leptoseris fragilis in
the Red Sea exhibit large changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations with changes in depth [24]. Our
results from Leptoseris spp. in Hawaii suggest that this may
be a capacity of generalist Symbiodinium types such as C1
and C1c. However, confirming whether these abundant,
generalist types have the ability to photoacclimate across
the depth range under consideration here will require pigment studies and endosymbiont density counts and will
be an important component of future research on the
deep water corals in Hawaii.

Despite the focus on Symbiodinium and its ability to photoacclimate, the coral host can also influence photoacclimation. Research on Leptoseris fragilis in the Red Sea has
shown possible photoadaptations in host light-harvesting
systems that may enhance photosynthetic performance
[25]. These include fluorescent pigments that may convert
light at depth to wavelengths useable for photosynthesis
[4], plate-like growth forms, and morphological adaptations like conical knobs that may serve as coral "light
traps" [24]. Leptoseris in Hawaii also possess these three
adaptations, but their influence on photosynthetic performance in Leptoseris spp. in Hawaii has yet to be directly
demonstrated.
Furthermore, Leptoseris could differ from shallow corals in
its reliance on phototrophic carbon because this coral
could obtain more nutrients from feeding [26], or have
reduced needs for nutrients with slower growth rates and
lower metabolism [27]. For example, L. fragilis has trophic
adaptations that may be responsible for minimizing their

dependence on photosynthetically fixed carbon [28]. L.
fragilis has a perforated gastrovascular cavity, resulting in
a flow-through system where microscopic particulate
organic material such as detritus, bacteria, and plankton
can accumulate [28]. As light decreases with depth, greater
reliance on feeding heterotrophically (rather than on phototrophy) may enable these corals to survive. However, to
date, no studies have examined the relative contribution
of photosynthetically fixed carbon to the daily energy
budget of corals at these depths in Hawaii; such studies
are critical to a more comprehensive understanding of
Leptoseris's spp. broad depth distribution.
Given the known slow rate of evolution in coral mitochondrial DNA [29,30], the six distinct coral haplotypes
we found likely represent multiple species and highlight
unrecognized diversity in this coral genus. In a previous
study using the NAD5 marker, Concepcion et al.
(2006)[29] found no variation between species within the
genus Acropora and Pocillopora, but for the genus Porites, P.

asteroides and P. compressa differed by two indels, and P.
porites and P. compressa by four single bp changes.
Interestingly, we found different Symbiodinium communities associated with different mitochondrial NAD5 haplotypes. Four of the coral mitochondrial types (N2, N4, N5,
and N6) were dominated by C1 and C1c endosymbionts,
however, N1 (n = 4 colonies) and N3 (n = 1 colony)
showed different patterns of symbiont association (with
C1, C1_v1a, and C1_v1b and with C27, respectively).

Conclusion
This study was a natural first step to exploring the biological traits that allow Leptoseris spp. to persist and dominate
at mesophotic depths (i.e. 67 to 100 m depth). We found
common shallow-water Symbiodinium types at depths not
previously recorded for these endosymbionts. We also
found genetic variability at mitochondrial NAD5, which
suggests undescribed taxonomic diversity in Leptoseris.
Mesophotic coral communities are found beyond the limits of traditional SCUBA diving and as a result, their ecology is poorly understood [6,7]. An understanding of the
mechanism(s) by which reef corals adjust to extremes in
the environment and the limits inherent to these mechanisms provides insights into the future responses of deep
and shallow reef communities to environmental change.
Our study indicates that a specialist symbiont is not a prerequisite for existence at environmental extremes.

Methods
Mesophotic corals (67-100 m depth) (n = 15) were collected using the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's
(HURL) manned submersibles, Pisces IV and V, during
two cruises (October 2006 and December 2007) to the
Au'au Channel (see Table 1 for sampling locations)
between the islands of Maui and Lanai aboard R/V Kaimikai-o-Kanaloa. Leptoseris spp. fragments were broken off
using the submersible's mechanical arm, brought to the
surface and preserved in 95% Ethanol or DMSO buffer, or
frozen at -80°C. Species level identifications of Leptoseris
samples were problematic due to: (1) the small sizes of
some of the collected specimens (due to breakage from
the mechanical arm) making identification impossible,
and (2) the finding of morphotypes that had previously
not been reported from Hawaii [7,31]; therefore we refer
to all the samples as Leptoseris spp. Sample size was limited due to the logistical challenges of obtaining deepwater specimens.
Genomic DNAs containing both the host and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates were extracted using a Guanidinium
extraction protocol [32]. The Symbiodinium ITS2 rDNA
marker was amplified using the primers itsD (forward; 5'GTGAATTGCAGAACTCCGTG-3') and ITS2Rev2 (reverse;
5'-CCTCCGCTTACTTATATGCTT-3') [32,33] and Sahara

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/21

DNA polymerase (Bioline, Randolph, MA, USA), a heatactivated high-fidelity complex of enzymes and immolase. PCRs totaled 25 μL and consisted of 2.5 μL of 10×
PCR Buffer (Bioline), 0.5 μL of each primer (10 mM), 0.5
μL (2.5 mM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 0.1 μL
of DNA polymerase, 1.0 μL of DNA, and the remainder of
25 μL water. The ITS2 region was amplified with an initial
denaturation step of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35
cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for one
min, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10
min. Amplified products were cloned using the CloneJET
PCR cloning kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) with the
pJET1.2/blunt plasmid and β-select gold efficiency cells
(Bioline). Colonies were picked and initially screened for
inserts of the correct size with the pJET 1.2 Forward and
Reverse sequencing primers. PCR screens of the correct
size were treated with exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline
phosphatase [34] and sequenced at the University of
Hawaii's Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and
Bioinformatics Facility.
To explore the potential association between coral and
endosymbiont genotypes, the corals were genotyped
using the NAD5 5' intron. Coral host DNA of the NAD5
5' mitochondrial intron was amplified and sequenced
using protocols described in [29] and the primers
NAD5_700F (5'-YTGCCGGATGCYATGGAG-3') and
NAD1_157R (5'-VCCATCYGCAAAAGGCTG-3') [29].
Chromatograms of DNA sequences were inspected using
Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) and sequences were individually identified via the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) in
GenBank. Symbiodinium sequences were manually aligned
with the BioEdit version 5.0.9 sequence alignment software [35] and phylogenetically analyzed using statistical
parsimony implemented in the program TCS version 1.21
[36]. Networks were delineated with 95% certainty, with
gaps treated as a fifth state.
One potential problem associated with PCR based techniques is the overestimation of sequence diversity associated with the characterization of unique sequence types
that reflect PCR error and/or intragenomic variation
[37,38]. To address this and provide as conservative an
estimate of biodiversity as possible, sequences included in
the downstream analysis were screened for the following
criteria: (1) sequences had either been published previously and the sequences retrieved and verified in multiple
independent studies, or (2) were recovered in this study
three or more times from clone libraries representing
three or more independent coral samples. In addition,
ITS2 folding was checked using previously published Symbiodinium ITS2 structures as templates [38,39] in the ITS2
database [40,41] and manually edited using the software

4SALE [42,43]. Potential pseudogenes were identified by
significant changes to the 5.8S sequence not observed in
Symbiodinium or in other closely related dinoflagellates
[38] and changes to the secondary structure of the ITS2
RNA molecule likely to disrupt the functional fold.
A total of 246 sequences identified as Symbiodinium were
recovered from 15 deep (67-100 m) Leptoseris spp. samples. Of the 68 unique sequence types, 55 were recovered
only once and six were recovered twice; these 61 sequence
types were dropped from the analysis. The secondary
structure and folding analysis of the remaining seven
sequence types identified a potential pseudogene that
appeared non-functional (data not shown) and this was
also dropped from the analysis. The number of excluded
and included sequences are shown in Table 1. The six
sequences retained for downstream analyses comprised
170 of the original 246 clones sequenced (69%).
