L. Walp.) in Africa

Abstract
Background: Cowpea is the most important food grain legume in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, no study has so
far assessed rhizobial biodiversity and/or nodule functioning in relation to strain IGS types at the continent level. In
this study, 9 cowpea genotypes were planted in field experiments in Botswana, South Africa and Ghana with the
aim of i) trapping indigenous cowpea root-nodule bacteria (cowpea “rhizobia”) in the 3 countries for isolation,
molecular characterisation using PCR-RFLP analysis, and sequencing of the 16S - 23S rDNA IGS gene, ii) quantifying
N-fixed in the cowpea genotypes using the 15N natural abundance technique, and iii) relating the levels of nodule
functioning (i.e. N-fixed) to the IGS types found inside nodules.
Results: Field measurements of N2 fixation revealed significant differences in plant growth, δ15N values, %Ndfa and
amounts of N-fixed between and among the 9 cowpea genotypes in Ghana and South Africa. Following DNA
analysis of 270 nodules from the 9 genotypes, 18 strain IGS types were found. Relating nodule function to the 18
IGS types revealed significant differences in IGS type N2-fixing efficiencies. Sequencing the 16S - 23S rDNA gene
also revealed 4 clusters, with cluster 2 forming a distinct group that may be a new Bradyrhizobium species. Taken
together, our data indicated greater biodiversity of cowpea bradyrhizobia in South Africa relative to Botswana and
Ghana.
Conclusions: We have shown that cowpea is strongly dependant on N2 fixation for its N nutrition in both South
Africa and Ghana. Strain IGS type symbiotic efficiency was assessed for the first time in this study, and a positive
correlation was discernible where there was sole nodule occupancy. The differences in IGS type diversity and
symbiotic efficiency probably accounts for the genotype × environment interaction that makes it difficult to select
superior genotypes for use across Africa. The root-nodule bacteria nodulating cowpea in this study all belonged to
the genus Bradyrhizobium. Some strains from Southern Africa were phylogenetically very distinct, suggesting a new
Bradyrhizobium species.

Background
Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) is a major food
crop in Africa, where its leaves, green pods and grain
are eaten as a dietary source of protein. The cowpea
grain contains about 23% protein and 57% carbohydrate,
while the leaves contain between 27 - 34% protein [1].
The leaves and grain are also supplied as high protein
feed and fodder to livestock. Cowpea is the most commonly grown food legume by traditional farmers in

Sub-Saharan Africa, possibly because of its relatively
wide adaptation to drought and low-nutrient environments. Cowpea freely forms root nodules with some
members of the Rhizobiaceae such as Rhizobium and
Bradyrhizobium [2]. It is inside these nodules where
nitrogenase enzyme in rhizobium bacteroids reduces N2
into NH 3 via the GS/GOGAT pathway, leading to
exchange of nitrogenous solutes with host plant for
recently-formed photosynthate.
A survey of N2 fixation in farmers’ fields showed that
cowpea can derive up to 66% of its N from symbiotic
fixation in Botswana [3], and up to 99% in Ghana [4].
The observed N contribution by this mutualistic

relationship between cowpea and species of Rhizobium
and Bradyrhizobium forms the basis for its importance in
cropping systems. Moderate grain yields of 1500 kg/ha
have been reported for cowpea in Ghana [1] and over
2600 kg/ha in South Africa [5]. To increase the threshold
of cowpea yields in Africa would require identification of
genotypes that exhibit high symbiotic performance and
better plant growth.
Because cowpea nodulates freely with both rhizobia
and bradyrhizobia [1], it is often described as being promiscuous. Yet only few studies [1,6-9] have examined
the biodiversity of cowpea rhizobia and bradyrhizobia in
Africa, the native home of this legume species. One
study [6] reported four different Bradyrhizobium strains
belonging to 3 genospecies, and concluded that the cowpea rhizobia appeared to be more diverse in arid areas.
Recently, another study [8] grouped cowpea rhizobia
from China into six genospecies, and linked microsymbiont distribution and diversity to geographical location.
Like most published reports on the biodiversity of
root-nodule bacteria, namely rhizobia, bradyrhizobia,
azorhizobia, sinorhizobia and mesorhizobia, none of the
studies [1,6-9] on cowpea rhizobia and bradyrhizobia
has assessed the linkage between symbiotic functioning
and bacterial IGS types resident in nodules and/or used
for determining rhizobial biodiversity. Quantifying N2
fixation in legumes and linking amounts of N-fixed to
the IGS types found in their root nodules, could provide
some indication of the symbiotic efficiency of resident
bacterial populations used for establishing rhizobial biodiversity. That way, studies of legume agronomy in the
context of N contribution could add value to bacterial
biodiversity and phylogeny in relation to symbiotic
functioning.
In this study, 9 cowpea genotypes were planted in
field experiments in Botswana, South Africa and Ghana
with the aim of i) trapping indigenous cowpea rhizobia
in the 3 countries for isolation and molecular characterisation, ii) quantifying N-fixed in the cowpea genotypes
using the 15 N natural abundance technique, and iii)
relating the levels of nodule functioning (i.e. N-fixed) to
the IGS types found inside cowpea nodules, in order to
assess strain IGS type symbiotic efficiency.

Methods
Experimental site descriptions

In Ghana, the experiments were conducted at the
Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) site at
Dokpong, Wa, in 2005. The site is located in the Guinea
savanna, (latitude 10° 03’ N, longitude 2° 30’ W, and
altitude 370 m) and has a unimodal rainfall (1100 mm
annual mean) that starts in May and ends in September/October. The soils are classified as Ferric Luvisols
[10]. Prior to experimentation, the site had been

Page 2 of 12

fallowed for 3 years. In South Africa, the Agricultural
Research Council (ARC-Grain Crop Research Institute)
farm at Taung, Potchefstroom, was used for the field
trials. The Taung experimental site is located between
latitudes 27° 30’ S and longitudes 24° 30’ E, and is situated in the grassland savanna with a unimodal rainfall
(1061 mm annual mean) that begins in October and
lasts until June/July the following year. The soil at
Taung is structureless, and freely drained with a reddish-yellow colour. The site was cropped to maize (Zea
mays L.) the previous year with the application of NPK
fertiliser. In Botswana, the experimental site was located
at Glenvalley near Gaborone, in the Botswana College of
Agriculture in 2006. The farm is situated between 24°
40’ S and 26° 09’ E at an altitude of 1015 m and it is
part of an open savanna agro-ecology with a unimodal
rainfall (429 mm annual mean). The soil is classified as
Ferric Luvisol [10] or Kanhaplic Haplustalf (Soil Taxonomy), and had not been cultivated before.
Planting, harvesting and processing

Nine cowpea genotypes were used in this study, namely
Omondaw, Brown eye, ITH98-46, IT82D-889, Apagbaala, Bechuana white, Glenda, Mamlaka and Fahari. Of
these, Omondaw, Apagbaala (both farmer varieties) and
Brown eye (an inbred cultivar) originated from Ghana;
Mamlaka and Fahari (two farmer varieties) came from
Tanzania; Glenda and Bechuana white were two
improved commercial varieties originating from South
Africa and Botswana respectively, while ITH98-46 and
IT82D-889 were breeder varieties that came from IITA
in Nigeria. The 9 cowpea genotypes were planted at
Dokpong, Taung and Glenvalley in Ghana, South Africa
and Botswana respectively, using a randomized complete
block design with four replicate plots. Planting was done
in mid-July in Ghana, early January in Botswana, and
mid-October in South Africa, in accordance with the
rainfall pattern of each country.
Plants were sampled from the inner part of the middle
rows of each plot at 46 days after planting, and separated into shoots and nodules, in the case of Ghana and
South Africa. The shoots were oven-dried at 60°C to
constant weight for dry matter determination. Nodules
were dried at 45°C and stored prior to DNA extraction.
For the Botswana trial, only root nodules were sampled
due to a sudden incidence of disease (cowpea rust). As a
result, only the shoots from the Ghana and South Africa
were milled to fine powder (0.85 mm sieve) for 15 N
analysis.

N/14N isotopic analysis

About 2.0 mg of each milled sample was weighed into a
tin capsule (Elemental Microanalysis Ltd, Okehampton,
UK) and run on a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP

stable light isotope mass spectrometer (Fisons Instrument SpA, Strada Rivolta, Italy) coupled via a Conflo III
device to Thermo 1112 Flash elemental analyzer against
an internal reference plant material (Nasturtium sp.)
The Nasturtium sp. had been calibrated against an
IAEA standard (Air for N) and the results expressed
relative to air.
The isotopic composition of 15N was measured as the
difference in the number of atoms of 15 N to 14 N in
atmospheric (atm) N2 [11,12]:

Whole-plant 15N natural abundance was calculated as
an average of the 15N natural abundance values of all
plant parts weighted by their respective total N [13]:
15N whole plant 

(15N root N root  15N shoot N shoot )
(N root  N root )

The N content of each organ was determined as the
product of %N and sample weight [14]:
N amount (mg.plant 1)  %N organ  dry weight organ (mg)

%Ndfa and N-fixed values

The proportion of N derived from biological N2 fixation
in the plant was calculated as [15]:
%Ndfa  [( 15N ref   15N leg ) / ( 15N ref  B value)]  100

Where δ15Nref is the mean 15N natural abundance of
non-N 2 -fixing reference plant shoots, δ 15 N leg is the
mean 15 N natural abundance of the legume (cowpea)
shoots, and the B value is the 15N natural abundance of
cowpea shoots which were dependent solely on symbiotic N2 fixation for their N nutrition. B value of -1.759
for cowpea shoots was used in calculating %Ndfa [3]. At
Wa, sorghum and maize crops planted at the same time
and growing on an adjacent field (as monocrops) were
used as reference plants; they had an average δ15N value
of +7.12‰. For Taung, an Eragrostis sp. and an unidentified herbaceous weed growing in the field with cowpea
were analysed as the reference plants. Their average
δ 15 N value of +5.03‰ was used to estimate %Ndfa in
cowpea. While the cowpea plants were raised on ridges,
the Eragrostis sp. and the herbaceous weed sampled as
reference plants, were growing on the ploughed
unridged area around the experimental plots. The
amount of N-fixed was calculated as [16]:

The amount of N-fixed in each cowpea shoot was
divided by the plant’s nodule mass and age to obtain the
specific nodule activity, expressed as μg N - fixed.mg
nod DM-1.d-1 [17].
Nodule harvest and DNA extraction

Two hundred and seventy (270) nodules were harvested from the 9 cowpea genotypes planted in Ghana,
South Africa and Botswana for DNA extraction. The
nodules harvested were generally representative of the
total nodule pool per plant, and were all effective in
N2 fixation based on the pink internal colour (i.e. presence of leghaemoglobin). Total DNA (plant and
microbial) was extracted from each of the 270 nodules,
using the method described by [18]. To sterilise the
nodules, they were rehydrated in sterile distilled water,
immersed in 3.3% w/v Ca(OCl) 2 for 3 min, rinsed in
sterile water, followed by soaking in 96% ethanol and
rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. Each nodule
(about 4 mg in weight) was crushed in 100 μL TES/
sucrose buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM
EDTA di-sodium, pH 8.0, 8% p/v) in a sterilised 1.5
mL Eppendorf tube (using a plastic pestle sterilised in
absolute ethanol). Lyzozyme (4 mg/μL) was added to
the crushed nodule macerate, vortexed for 20 s and
incubated at 37°C for 15 min. A solution of GES (0.05
mM guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1 M EDTA di-sodium,
pH 8.0, 1% N-Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) was added
to the lysed nodule homogenate, vortexed again for
20 s and incubated at 65°C for 15 min. The GES-cell
lysate mixture was centrifuged at 10000 × g in a 3K15
Model Sigma centrifuge for 15 min at 4°C and the
supernatant transferred into a new tube. Total DNA
was pelleted by centrifuging at 4°C at 10000 × g for
15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 0.5 mL 95%
ethanol added to the pellet and centrifuged again at 4°C
at 10000 × g for 15 min. This was repeated twice. The
DNA pellet was then air-dried, re-dissolved in 50 to
250 μL of 8 mM NaOH and the pH adjusted to pH 7.5
by adding 8 μL of 0.1 M HEPES (N-2-Hydroethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid) for every 50 μL of the
NaOH used to dissolve DNA. The purity and quantity
of the DNA was controlled by horizontal electrophoresis
in 0.8% Sigma II agarose gel, using a molecular weight
marker (Smart Ladder) for gel calibration. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V for 30 min. The gel was
stained in an aqueous solution of ethidium bromide
(1 μg/mL) for 30 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water
for 15 min and photographed under UV light with Gel
Doc (Bio-Rad) software.

PCR amplification and restriction fragment analysis

In this study, we chose PCR-RFLP and sequencing of
the IGS region because of its great resolution power
with symbiotic rhizobia [19] and the fact that the region
provides taxonomic information similar to that obtained
by DNA-DNA hybridisation [20]. Depending on its concentration and the amount of impurities present, each
DNA sample was diluted with sterile MilliQ water and
PCR performed in a Perkin Elmer 2400 Thermal cycler
in a total volume of 25 μL reaction mixture using
Ready-to-go Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech).
A negative control with water (no DNA) was included
in all the PCR runs. The 16S-23S rDNA PCR amplification was carried out using two primers, FGPL132-38
and FGPS1490-72 (Table 1). The protocol used included
initial denaturation at 94°C for 15 min; 35 cycles of
denaturation (30 s at 94°C), annealing (30 s at 55°C),
extension (72°C for 1 min) and final extension at 72°C
for 7 min. Amplified DNA products were separated by
horizontal gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. RFLP
was carried out using a total volume of 20 μL containing
8 or 10 μL PCR products (depending on the intensity of
the band on the PCR control gel), 1 μL endonuclease, 2
μL of the relevant buffer and 9 or 7 μL of ultrapure
water (depending on the volume of the PCR products
used). HaeIII and MspI restriction enzymes were used.
The mixture was incubated at 37°C overnight. Restricted
DNA fragments were analyzed after migration in 3%
agarose gel at 80 V for 90 min. Electrophoregrams with
similar migratory patterns were grouped together and
assigned to the different IGS groups (IGS types I to
XVIII).
Gene sequencing

One sample per group was selected for sequencing the
16S - 23S rDNA IGS gene. Prior to sequencing, the PCR
products of the test samples were purified using QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen) and the sequencing done
using four primers, FGPS1490-72, FGPL132-38, BRIIe
and BR4r (COGENICS, Meylan, France, see Table 1).
The sequences were analyzed from electrophoregrams
and corrected using 4Peaks software (2005 Mek and Tsj.

to 16S and 23S rDNA genes were subtracted to obtain
single IGS sequences which were aligned with CLUSTALX [21] and the closely related sequences were
included in following analyses. Phylogenetic analysis was
done using the CLUSTALX and phylogenetic trees constructed using the neighbour-joining method [22]. A
bootstrap confidence analysis was performed on 1000
replicates to determine the reliability of the distance-tree
topology obtained [23]. Graphic representation of the
resulting trees was done using NJPLOT software [24].

Results
Plant growth and symbiotic performance of 9 cowpea
genotypes

Analysis of data on nodule numbers, nodule mass,
shoot dry matter and grain yield using One-Way
ANOVA revealed significant differences between and
among the 9 cowpea genotypes (Tables 2 and 3). At
Wa, for example, Bechuana white and IT82D-889 produced the highest nodule number per plant while
Brown eye and Apagbaala showed the least (Table 2).
At Taung in South Africa, Fahari exhibited the highest
nodulation with Brown eye again showing the least
nodulation together with Omondaw (Table 3). Interestingly, IT82D-889 (which had the highest nodulation at
Wa) also produced significantly the most nodule mass
at Wa, with Mamlaka and Fahari producing very low
nodule dry matter, followed by Brown eye and Fahari
(Table 2). At Taung, IT82D-889 produced the largest
nodule dry mass, followed by Bechuana white, while
Mamlaka and Apagbaala showed the least nodule dry
mass, even though they were intermediate in nodulation (Table 3).
At Wa, Omondaw and Glenda, which were second
highest in nodulation, produced the largest shoot biomass and the highest amount of N-fixed compared to
Mamlaka and Fahari (which had very low nodule mass).
As with IT82D-889 and Brown eye, Omondaw and
Glenda also produced the lowest amount of N-fixed and
the least shoot biomass (Table 2). At Taung in South
Africa, Fahari (which had the highest nodule number
and was second in nodule mass) produced significantly
the highest amount of N-fixed and the largest amount
of shoot biomass (Table 3). In the same manner, Apagbaala, which had the least nodule mass showed (together
with ITH98-46 and Omondaw) the least shoot biomass
and the lowest amount of N-fixed (Table 3).
Nodule occupancy

From the PCR-RFLP analysis, the IGS types of strains resident in 30 root nodules from each of the 9 cowpea genotypes were determined and percent nodule occupancy
estimated. In total, 18 IGS types were found after

analysing 270 nodules from 9 cowpea genotypes (Table 4).
IGS type I was found in the nodules of only Omondaw,
type II in both Omondaw and Bechuana white, type III in
all the genotypes except Omondaw and Bechuana white,
type IV in IT82D-889 only, type V in all genotypes except
Omondaw, type VI in Glenda, Brown eye and Fahari, type
VII in Omondaw, IT82D-889, Bechuana white and
Glenda, type VIII in all the genotypes except Glenda, types
IX, X, XI and XII in only Glenda, type XIII in only Fahari
and Apagbaala, type XIV in only Apagbaala, types XV,
XVI and XVII in only Fahari, and type XVIII in only
Apagbaala (Table 4). Nodules from Fahari contained the
highest number (8) of IGS types, followed by Apagbaala
with 6, IT82D-889 with 5, Omondaw, Bechuana white and
Brown eye each with 4, and ITH98-46 and Mamlaka each
with 3 IGS types (Table 4).
The per-country data for nodule occupancy by each
strain (or IGS type) are shown in Table 5. IGS types I,
IV, IX, X, XI, XIII, XIV, XVI, XVII and XVIII were only
found in the root nodules of cowpea plants grown at
Taung, South Africa (but not in those from Ghana and
Botswana), while XV and XIX were exclusively found in
nodules from Glenvalley in Botswana, and IGS type XII
was unique to nodules from Ghana.

Strain IGS type diversity from PCR-RFLP analysis

When DNA from each nodule was amplified with the
two primers, FGPL 132-38 and FGPS 1490-72, a PCR
product of about 900 bp was found that corresponded
to the size of 16S-23S IGS region. A comparison of Bradyrhizobium DNA extracted from root nodules of the 9
cowpea genotypes using IGS PCR-RFLP analysis with
HaeIII and Msp restriction enzymes yielded a UPGMA
dendogram from HaeIII, which showed 4 divergent lineage groups for the eighteen IGS types. Four clusters
were discernible at 50% similarity level using HaeIII
(Figure 1). Cluster 1 consisted of bacterial DNA from
nodules of Omondaw (grown in South Africa and
Ghana), IT82D-889 and Bechuana white (grown in
South Africa), and Glenda (grown in Ghana). Cluster 2,
on the other hand, was made up of i) IGS types from
nodules of all the 9 genotypes grown in South Africa, ii)
IGS types from nodules of ITH98-46, IT82D-889,
Glenda, Mamlaka, Brown eye, Bechuana white and
Apagbaala grown in Botswana, and iii) IGS types from
nodules of Glenda, Bechuana white and IT82D-889
grown in Ghana. In contrast, cluster 3 consisted of IGS
types coming from root nodules of only Glenda and
Fahari grown in South Africa. Like cluster 2, cluster 4

Relating symbiotic functioning (measured here as specific
nodule nitrogenase activity) to the IGS types found inside
root nodules revealed significant differences in the N2-fixing efficiency of these IGS types (Figure 2). For example,
IGS types V and VIII fixed very low N in IT82D-889 and
Bechuana white relative to IGS type III in Apagbaala at
Wa in Ghana (see Figure 2). It was also interesting to note
that sole nodule occupancy by IGS type VIII in Omondaw
resulted in significantly very high N yield relative to its
poor performance as a sole occupant of nodules in
ITH98-46 at Wa in Ghana (Figure 2A). Similar differences
in symbiotic functioning were obtained for combinations
of resident IGS types found in root nodules of the 9 cowpea genotypes at Taung in South Africa (Figure 2B).
16S-23S rDNA IGS sequencing

Out of 18 IGS types samples submitted for gene sequencing (see Table 5), only 13 (i.e. samples with sequence
numbers 104, 27, 36, 103, 115, 68, 5, 201, 22, 117, 153,
146 and 107) were successfully sequenced. As a result,

belonged to the genus Bradyrhizobium.

Discussion
Field measurements of N2 fixation using the 15N natural
abundance revealed significant differences in plant
growth and symbiotic performance of the 9 cowpea genotypes tested in South Africa and Ghana (Tables 2 and
3). The marked variation in plant growth (measured as
dry matter yield) was linked to differences in overall
nodule functioning. At Wa, for example, Omondaw and
Glenda, which were among the highest in nodulation
(nodule number and mass), showed the lowest ∂ 15 N
values, the highest %Ndfa, the highest amount of Nfixed, and thus produced the largest amount of plant
growth and dry matter (Table 2). This was in contrast
to Mamlaka and Fahari, which exhibited low nodulation
and low N-fixed, and therefore produced the least shoot
biomass at Wa (Table 2). At Taung in South Africa,
Fahari which showed the best nodulation and the highest amount of N-fixed, recorded the highest amount of
shoot biomass relative to Apagbaala, which exhibited
the least nodulation, lowest amount of N-fixed, and thus
produced the smallest plant biomass (Table 3). Of the 9
cowpea genotypes planted at Wa, Apagbaala was among
the top 3 genotypes in N2 fixation (Table 2) due to its
high specific nodule activity (Figure 2A). Yet in South
Africa, Apagbaala and Omondaw were among the least
in N2 fixation, even though they were the highest fixers
in Ghana.
The better symbiotic performance of genotypes at one
location (e.g. Omondaw and Apagbaala at Wa in
Ghana) and their poor performance at another site (e.g.
Taung in South Africa) could be attributed to the quality of nodule occupants (i.e. the resident IGS types
inside root nodules, see Tables 4 and 5). As shown in
Figure 2, when nodule functioning was related to nodule
occupants, differences in N2-fixing efficiency were found
among the resident IGS types, especially where there
were clear cases of sole occupancy. For example, IGS
types V and VIII fixed very low N in IT82D-889 and
Bechuana white relative to IGS type III in Apagbaala
(Figure 2A). It was also interesting to note that sole
nodule occupancy by IGS type VIII in Omondaw at Wa
resulted in significantly very high symbiotic N yield relative to its poor performance as a sole occupant of root
nodules in ITH98-46 (Figure 2A). Similar differences in
N2-fixing efficiency were found for combinations of IGS
types resident in nodules of the 9 cowpea genotypes
planted at Taung in South Africa (Figure 2B). However,
at Taung, the nodules of the 9 cowpea genotypes were
associated with very diverse and different IGS types,
thus making assessment of individual IGS type

Page 10 of 12

symbiotic efficiency very difficult (Figure 2B). Even
where an IGS type proved to be symbiotically very efficient with a particular genotype (e.g. IGS type VIII on
Omondaw at Wa, Ghana), it can become low in N yield
when in combination with other IGS types in nodules of
same genotype (e.g. IGS type VIII on Omondaw at
Taung, South Africa). In that case, either the associated
IGS types I and II were ineffective in N 2 fixation, or
their co-occupancy in root nodules had a negative effect
on the symbiotic efficiency of IGS type VIII (which as a
sole occupant showed high N 2 -fixing efficiency).
Although it has been demonstrated that the symbiotic
performance of a double strain inoculant of Rhizobium
leguminosarum was 2.5 times superior to their sole
counterparts in subterranean clover [25], it is unclear
whether the IGS types of those strains were the same or
different. We therefore still do not know much about
the negative or positive effects of IGS types on nodule
functioning, especially when they are present as sole or
multiple occupants on the same host plant.
The data on nodule occupancy clearly show that there
was greater Bradyrhizobium biodiversity in the soil at
Taung in South Africa relative to Ghana and Botswana,
with many more IGS types found only in South Africa
(Table 5). Cowpea genotypes Fahari, Glenda and Apagbaala proved to be the most promiscuous across the
3 countries in terms of trapping more strain IGS types:
8 by Fahari, 8 by Glenda and 6 by Apagbaala (Table 4).
In addition to the marked strain diversity observed from
data on nodule occupancy, PCR-RFLP analysis using
HaeIII and Msp restriction enzymes showed four lineage
groups for the 18 IGS types (Figure 1). Gene sequencing
of the 16S-23S rDNA IGS region further revealed phylogenetic diversity among the Bradyrhizobium IGS types occupying nodules of the 9 cowpea genotypes grown in South
Africa, Botswana and Ghana (Figure 3). The gene
sequence numbers 104, 27, 36, 103, 115, 68, 5, 201, 22,
117, 153, 146 and 106, representing samples selected from
the 18 IGS types and deposited in the Genbank database,
clustered with different Bradyrhizobium species. As shown
in Figure 3, even though sequence 104 was from Glenda
grown in South Africa, it formed a common clade with
sequence 27 from Omondaw and Glenda grown in Ghana,
and together they clustered around B. yuanmingense and
Bradyrhizobium sp. Similarly, sequence 115 isolated from
Glenda in South Africa shared a common clade with
sequence 68 from 8 of the 9 cowpea genotypes (except
Omondaw) grown in all 3 countries, and clustered with
Bradyrhizobium sp ORS 188, ORS 190 and USDA 3384,
just as sequence 103 isolated from South Africa and Botswana with Glenda, Brown eye and Fahari as trap hosts
clustered around Bradyrhizobium sp ORS 3409 and CIRADc12. Perhaps the most important finding from the phylogenetic aspect of this study is the fact that cluster 2

Pule-Meulenberg et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/89

(consisting of sequences 5, 201, 22, 117, and 153) formed
its own distinct group, suggesting that it is a new Bradyrhizobium species (Figure 3). What is also unique about
this cluster is that all the sequences (i.e. 5, 22, 117, 153
and 146, except for 201) originated from South Africa,
though isolated from different cowpea genotypes (see
Tables 4 and 5), again underscoring the greater Bradyrhizobium biodiversity in South Africa. Sequence 106 was the
only one related to the B. elkanii group (see cluster 3, Figure 3), and was isolated only from South Africa with
Apagbaala as trap host (Tables 4 and 5).
Although some reports claim to have isolated both
bradyrhizobia (slow-growing) and rhizobia (fast-growing)
from root nodules of cowpea [2,26], a recent study [9]
found only Bradyrhizobium species in the root nodules
of cowpea grown in South Africa and Botswana. In contrast, the Chinese have identified both rhizobia and bradyrhizobia in cowpea nodules [8]. In this study, we also
found only bradyrhizobial strains in cowpea nodules
when bacterial DNA was analyzed directly from nodules
of cowpea plants grown in Ghana, Botswana and South
Africa (see Figure 3).
Taken together, the data from studies of nodule occupancy, PCR-RFLP analysis, IGS type symbiotic efficiency
and gene sequencing indicate greater biodiversity of
cowpea bradyryhizobia in Africa, especially in South
Africa. This was evidenced by the different IGS types
found in cowpea nodules, as well as the phylogenetically-diverse groups obtained from the Genbank database. The observed strain diversity associated with the 9
cowpea genotypes led to different levels of IGS type
symbiotic efficacy in same hosts at different sites, and in
different hosts at same experimental site (Figure 2).
Thus, the differences in IGS type diversity and symbiotic
efficiency could account for the genotype × environment
interaction that made it difficult to select superior cowpea genotypes for use across Africa.
In this study, the origin of cowpea genotypes showed
no specific trend in their ability to trap IGS types across
the 3 countries. However, many IGS types appeared to
have clustered along geographical lines (Figure 1); for
example, cluster 2 consisted exclusively of IGS types isolated from soils in Southern Africa. A number of studies
also found clustering of bradyrhizobial isolates according
to geographical regions [9,6,27]. Although in another
study [9] none of the isolates examined showed similarity with B. japonicum and B. liaoningense [9], sequence
146 in this study was closely related to B. japonicum
USDA 38 (AF208514).

Conclusion
We have shown here that i) cowpea is strongly dependent on N2 fixation for its N nutrition in South Africa,
Ghana and Botswana, ii) the diversity of cowpea-

Page 11 of 12

nodulating bradyrhizobia was much higher in South
Africa compared to Botswana and Ghana, iii) some
strains from Southern Africa were phylogenetically very
distinct, thus suggesting that they may be a new Bradyrhizobium species. Strain IGS type symbiotic efficiency
was assessed for the first time in this study, and the
data showed significant differences between and among
the IGS types in terms of their symbiotic efficiency.
