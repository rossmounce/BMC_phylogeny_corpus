Synergisticstrategy is proposed for identifying synergistic transcription factors by function conservation, leading to the identification of 51

Abstract
Background: Previous methods employed for the identification of synergistic transcription
factors (TFs) are based on either TF enrichment from co-regulated genes or phylogenetic
footprinting. Despite the success of these methods, both have limitations.
Results: We propose a new strategy to identify synergistic TFs by function conservation. Rather
than aligning the regulatory sequences from orthologous genes and then identifying conserved TF
binding sites (TFBSs) in the alignment, we developed computational approaches to implement the
novel strategy. These methods include combinatorial TFBS enrichment utilizing distance
constraints followed by enrichment of overlapping orthologous genes from human and mouse,
whose regulatory sequences contain the enriched TFBS combinations. Subsequently, integration of
function conservation from both TFBS and overlapping orthologous genes was achieved by
correlation analyses. These techniques have been used for genome-wide promoter analyses, which
have led to the identification of 51 homotypic TF combinations; the validity of these approaches
has been exemplified by both known TF-TF interactions and function coherence analyses. We
further provide computational evidence that our novel methods were able to identify synergistic
TFs to a much greater extent than phylogenetic footprinting.
Conclusion: Function conservation based on the concordance of combinatorial TFBS enrichment
along with enrichment of overlapping orthologous genes has been proven to be a successful means
for the identification of synergistic TFs. This approach avoids the limitations of phylogenetic
footprinting as it does not depend upon sequence alignment. It utilizes existing gene annotation
data, such as those available in GO, thus providing an alternative method for functional TF
discovery and annotation.

Background

The expression of genes is regulated by transcription factors
(TFs), which interact with the basic transcription machinery

to activate or repress transcription after binding to TF binding sites (TFBSs; also called cis-acting elements) in target
genes and interacting with other DNA binding proteins. In

eukaryotic organisms, transcriptional regulation of a gene's
spatial, temporal, and expression level is generally mediated
by multiple TFs [1-3]. Therefore, the identification of synergistic TFs and the elucidation of relationships among them
are of great importance for understanding combinatorial
transcriptional regulation and gene regulatory networks.
Currently, the identification of synergistic TFs comes predominantly from two general approaches. The first is by the
use of experimental data such as gene expression, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip, and protein-protein interaction data. For this approach, the majority of studies analyzed gene expression data across a variety of experimental
conditions to infer synergistic relationships between TFs [49]. Statistically significant motif combinations are predicted
based on stronger co-expression patterns regulated by two or
more TFs than the expression patterns regulated by a single
one. With the advance in protein-DNA binding assays [10],
researchers have also integrated ChIP data with microarray
expression or protein-protein interaction data to infer synergistic binding of cooperative TFs [11-14]. The second commonly used approach is computational identification of TF
combinations. In this case, synergistic TFs were predicted by
either enrichment analysis of co-occurring TFBSs on the
upstream sequences of genes relative to appropriate background sequences or by comparative genomics using phylogenetically conserved sequences between closely related
species [15-17].
Despite the success of these approaches, both have limitations. The approach based on experimental observation
needs a priori knowledge, such as gene expression patterns in
a certain tissue, which restricts synergistic TF determination
to those tissues or cells studied and thus prevents the discovery of TF combinations from multiple biological conditions.
Conversely, computational approaches can predict TF combinations on a large scale, but they usually lack the ability to
functionally annotate synergistic TFs. Furthermore, methods
based on phylogenetically conserved sequences, although
they can greatly reduce the false prediction rate [18], have
limitations related to missing potentially significant observations. Moreover, if the species are very closely related, nonfunctional sequences may not have diverged enough to allow
functional sequence motifs to be identified; conversely, if the
species are distantly related, short conserved regions may be
masked by nonfunctional background sequences.
In the current study, rather than utilizing these traditional
approaches, we propose a novel strategy to identify TF combinations by function conservation, which can be implemented at two levels. The first is functional conservation of
TFs between species. Based on the strong possibility that each
specific TF plays the same role in regulating gene expression
between closely related species, the occurrence of its binding
sites is expected to be more highly enriched in promoter
sequences of orthologous genes than in promoter sequences

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R257

of non-orthologous genes. The second is functional conservation of TFBSs between promoter sequences of individual
orthologous genes. For identifying TF combinations, the general pattern of TFBS arrangement on promoters of orthologous genes is most likely more important than the precise
positions of the binding sites [19]. To apply these concepts to
synergistic TF discovery, it is important to develop appropriate computational approaches that are able to integrate function conservation from both TFs and TFBSs with analytical
methodologies. We thus utilized human and mouse orthologous promoter sequences to first enrich TFBS combinations
with distance constraints on a genome-scale and subsequently performed enrichment analyses of common orthologous genes (that is, genes that overlapped between mouse and
human with particular homotypic TFBSs) whose regulatory
sequences contain the identified TFBS combinations. We
then integrated the function conservation from both levels by
using Pearson correlation coefficients.
Genome-wide promoter analyses have led not only to the
development of computational approaches but also to the
identification of 51 homotypic TF combinations using known
TFBSs from precompiled position weight matrices (PWMs) in
the TRANSFAC database [20]. As a first step toward discovering functional TF networks, we have further used the developed computational approaches to predicate interactions
between heterotypic TFs (that is, two different TFs). The
strength of this proposed strategy, as opposed to the other
described methods, lies in the fact that this strategy does not
depend on sequence alignment, but rather genome information, for the discovery of functionally conserved TF combinations. Therefore, TF combinations with different functions
can be obtained simultaneously, which is a key first step
towards identifying functional TF networks.

Results
Strategy overview
The overall analysis procedures are shown in Figure 1. The
input data comprised more than 10,000 human and mouse
orthologous promoter sequence pairs from the Database of
Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS) [21]. To incorporate
functional conservation of TFBS combinations into the analysis, we first performed a genome-wide search to obtain all
potential TFBSs for each individual promoter sequence using
the Match® program and 234 unique PWMs from the professional TRANSFAC 9.1 database [22]. We then employed distance constraints to select co-occurring TFBSs in individual
promoter sequences. The degree of enrichment for TFBS
combinations was computed and represented as LODco
scores, which represent the frequency of co-occurrence for
particular TFBSs in promoter sequences with respect to random expectation for the co-occurrence of the same TFBSs
(see Materials and methods). The assumption behind this
enrichment analysis is that random co-occurrence of TFBSs
has less or no distance constraint when compared to

functional TFBSs, although specific distance constraints may
vary for different TFBSs. To incorporate functional conservation of TFs into the analysis, we estimated the degree of
enrichment by using the hypergeometric distribution, which
was represented as LODog scores, for overlapping human and
mouse orthologous genes whose promoter sequences contained the enriched TFBS combinations.

The integration of function conservation from both levels was
achieved by the estimation of correlation between LODco and
LODog. We hypothesized that if the enriched TFBS combinations had functional significance, then the enrichment of
common orthologous genes would correlate with the LODco
scores from both human and mouse promoter sequences,
since functional TFBSs are expected to be highly conserved

between orthologous gene promoter sequences from closely
related species. The degree of correlation would therefore
allow us to identify combinatorial TFs that potentially regulated genes in a synergistic fashion. For the selection of significant correlations, we performed permutation tests to obtain
p values, which were used to set up filtering criteria for multiple tests. Functional TF combinations were predicted based
on p value cutoff threshold (q-value < 0.05) in both human
and mouse and further validated by both known TF-TF interactions and function coherence based on Gene Ontology (GO)
annotation of common mouse and human genes containing
co-occurring TFBSs [23,24].

Enrichment of TFBS combinations and orthologous
genes containing the binding sites
For the enrichment of functionally co-occurring TFBSs, we
first employed 234 PWMs, which represent unique TFs in the
TRANSFAC 9.1 database, to identify homotypic TFBS combinations (that is, two or more binding sites for the same TF on
the same gene). As one of the important components of the
approach, a total of 18 between-TFBS distances were defined
and used to obtain co-occurring TFBSs from individual promoter sequences. Enrichment of TFBS combinations was
estimated on a genome-scale by comparing co-occurring
TFBS frequencies in known promoter sequences to those
from random background sequences.
Figure 2a,b show the overall enrichment results of TFBS combinations for 9 selected distance constraints and one without
distance constraints from all 234 PWMs. A LODco score > 0
exemplifies a higher frequency of TFBSs per promoter
sequence when compared to background sequences. Thus,
the larger the LODco score, the greater the enrichment of a
particular TFBS. The results show that the distributions of
LODco scores obtained from orthologous human and mouse
promoters have similar patterns. Whereas the distribution of
LODco scores from the no distance constraint situation is significantly shifted in isolation to the left, LODco score distributions from distance constraints are shifted to the right along
with the smaller between-TFBS distances. Similar results
were also obtained for enrichment of common orthologous
genes containing the identified TFBS combinations, as can be
seen from the LODog distributions in Figure 2c.
We also performed further analyses to test the statistical significances of LODco and LODog score distributions from individual distance constraints using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
The results indicated that both median LODco and LODog
scores from individual distance constraints were significantly
larger than those from no distance constraint (p < 10-15), further confirming the enrichment of co-occurring TFBSs and of
common orthologous genes. It is important to note that
median LODco scores from individual distance constraints
increase along with smaller between-TFBS distance (Figure
2d), with p values ranging from 2 × 10-4 to 2 × 10-16 for human
and from 5 × 10-8 to 2 × 10-16 for mouse. These findings are,

however, not observed for LODog scores (Figure 2d), for
which no significant p values exist from the comparisons
between adjacent distance constraints. These results suggest
that not all enriched TFBSs represent functional TFBS combinations and, further, that synergistic interactions may not be
applicable to every homotypic TF combination.

Integrating function conservation to identify TFs
having synergistic interactions
Since functional co-occurrence may not be applicable to every
TF and not all enriched TFBSs are functional TFBS combinations, it is therefore important to integrate function conservation from different levels to predict TFs that have synergistic
interactions. We employed Pearson correlation coefficients to
determine whether the 19 LODco scores and their corresponding LODog scores for each individual TFBS correlated with
each other. Since functional TFBSs are highly conserved
between orthologous gene promoters, we expect that a higher
rate of overlapping orthologous genes whose promoters contain the co-occurring TFBSs indicates that the enriched cooccurring TFBSs represent functional ones from individual
distance constraints. Therefore, correlations detect the agreement between TFBS enrichment and orthologous gene
enrichment, no matter whether all the enriched TFBSs are
functional ones or not. Figure 3a,b shows the overall distributions and frequencies of correlation coefficients from all 234
TFBSs for human and mouse. While correlation coefficients
cover a broad range from -0.84 to 0.99, only a small portion
of TFBSs display strong correlations for their LODco and
LODog scores, which is in agreement with the conclusion from
enrichment analyses.
To estimate the statistical significance of the correlations, we
performed permutation tests using randomly paired LODco
with LODog scores for each TFBS and utilized the resulting p
values to set up a cutoff threshold for multiple analyses. Using
a threshold q-value < 0.05, we were able to identify 51 homotypic TF combinations (Table 1) from both human and
mouse, with p values ranging from 3 × 10-3 to < 10-4 and correlations ranging from 0.35 to 0.98. Of these 51 TF combinations, some have relatively smaller correlations when
compared to the remaining TFBSs that were not selected
because they did not meet the established threshold criteria
(Figure 3a,b). This is because TFBSs with similar LODco and
LODog trends along distance constraints have smaller p values from permutation tests; this trend is nicely illustrated by
two TFs, one that met the threshold criterion (E2F1; Figure
4a) and one that did not (MYOGENIN; Figure 4b). Although
correlations for E2F1 are smaller than those for MYOGENIN,
E2F1 p values are much more significant than those from
MYOGENIN. Closer observation indicates that LODco and
LODog scores for E2F1 show a similar trend (Figure 4a), with
both increasing as between-TFBS distance decreases. By contrast, LODco and LODog scores for MYOGENIN do not show
this trend (Figure 4b), resulting in less statistical significance,
even though LODco and LODog scores are highly correlated.

occurrence of known TF combinations in the 51 identified TFs
to all 234 TFs. The results indicated that known TF combinations were significantly enriched in the 51 selected TFs (p =
0.035) compared to those TFs that did not meet the selection
criterion (p = 0.59). These results indicated that our approach
was able to identify to a great extent functionally co-occurring
TFs, which exemplifies the validity of our methods.

Evaluation by known TF-TF interactions
To assess the validity of the predicted TF combinations, we
first used TRANSCompel® professional version 10.4 to determine if known TF combinations were statistically enriched in
the 51 identified TFs [23]. The TRANSCompel® database contains approximately 180 experimentally proven composite
elements of two or more binding sites; of these approximately
180 composite elements, 15 are synergistic combinations of
homotypic TFs. Interestingly, 7 of these known combinations
are in the 51 selected TFs, including CEBPB, CREB, E2F1,
HNF1, HNF3B, OCT1, and PIT. To estimate the degree of
enrichment, we performed a Fisher's exact test comparing the

Evaluation by function coherence
It is a well-established fact that TFs control cellular biological
processes by targeting groups of genes encoding proteins with
similar functions. Based on this fact, we performed function
coherence analyses to determine if genes whose promoter
sequences contained the co-occurring TFBSs had known biological functions associated with the TF predicted to bind to
them. Two of the 51 selected TFs, namely E2F1 and NFAT, are
of particular interest, as the genes that they regulate have well
established physiological roles by previous studies. E2F1 regulates cell cycle progression via transcriptional regulation of

proliferation-associated and cell cycle-related genes [25-28],
while NFAT plays a central role in inducible gene
transcription in the process of immune response and in the
regulation of T-cell activation and differentiation [29-33].
Accordingly, we examined the functional association of genes
with predicted synergistic TFBSs by looking for similar
enriched GO biological process categories in overlapping
human and mouse orthologous genes. This was done by first
identifying the statistically over-represented GO biological
process categories for genes whose promoter sequences contained the co-occurring TFBSs by DAVID [34], followed by
looking for common GO biological process categories
between human and mouse genes from the same distance
constraint. Notably, genes whose promoter sequences contain co-occurring TFBSs display strong function coherence to
the corresponding TFs binding to them, as shown in Table 2,
in which enriched GO biological process categories and their
p values from Fisher's exact tests are listed from eight distance constraints. These results indicate that identified genes
with co-occurring E2F1 binding sites are involved in cell cycle
control, sterol metabolism, and nucleotide and nucleic acid
metabolism; notably, the biological process of cell cycle is
over-represented at most distance constraints tested. In the
case of NFAT, major over-represented biological functions
include homophilic cell adhesion and immune response. As
mentioned above, immune response is directly controlled by
NFAT transcription factor. Overall, these results provide
strong evidence for the functional co-occurrence of the identified TFs, and again exemplify the validity of our novel
approaches.

Function annotation for the identified synergistic TFs
As mentioned above, it is well known that TFs control cellular
biological processes via transcriptional regulation of groups

of genes with similar functions. The roles of a particular TF in
cellular processes can, therefore, be deduced from the known
physiological functions of the TF's target genes.
To perform function annotation, while minimizing false positives, we first sought to identify distance constraints that had
significant correlations between LODco and LODog scores
from the 51 identified TFs. Accordingly, 10,000 random correlations were computed for each distance constraint using
permuted LODco and LODog scores from the 51 TFs and used
to estimate the statistical significance for real correlations.
Correlations from human promoter analyses displayed significance for between-TFBS distances of 20 bp up to 90 bp, with
p values ranging from 0.044 to 0.006 (Figure 5). Although
correlations from mouse promoter analyses were not significant, 8 distance constraints (between-TFBS distances of 20
and 90 bp for human and mouse) were nevertheless used for
function annotation. Common human and mouse orthologous genes containing the synergistic binding sites were
subsequently submitted to DAVID for GO analysis. The selection of biological process categories for TF function annotation was based on the following criteria: biological process
categories are in common in at least five distance constraints
between human and mouse; there exist at least five distance
constraints in both human and mouse whose p values for the
common biological process are less than 0.05.
Function annotation results are shown in Table 3, where
potential biological functions for 38 synergistic TFs are listed
(significant categories were not detected from the other 13
TFs). A brief search of PubMed revealed that annotated biological functions for at least 18 of these 38 synergistic TFs are
in good agreement with previously reported findings by others [35-56]. For example, earlier findings indicated that
HNF1 was involved in the regulation of the expression of

human organic anion transporter 3 [39], IRF in antiviral
defense and immune activation [40], NRF2 in mammalian
mitochondrial biogenesis [42], and Zic3 in neurogenesis [55].
All these results provide further evidence in support of our
novel approaches.

Functional conservation of TFBSs obviates problems
associated with phylogenetic footprinting
Unlike phylogenetic footprinting, which searches for conserved TFBSs between individual orthologous genes by
sequence alignment, our approach of enriching TFBS combinations involved first obtaining all potential TFBSs on a
genome-scale and then looking for TFBS combinations based
on the pattern of binding site arrangement on promoter
sequences. For homotypic TF combinations, the pattern
might include the number of TFBSs and relative betweenTFBS distance. Utilizing this approach, conserved TFBS combinations that are located in different positions on the promoter sequences of orthologous genes can be identified, thus
eliminating problems caused by low sequence similarity and
sequence insertion or deletion.
Detailed analysis of identified E2F1 binding sites exemplifies
this point; Figure 6a shows conservation of putative E2F1
binding sites on human and mouse promoter sequences from
a between-TFBS distance of 20 bp. Overall, the arrangement
of TFBSs is highly conserved (with the exception of one extra
binding site in the mouse STAG1 gene). In some genes, such
as the TSPAN14 and FBN2 genes, E2F1 binding sites are in
exactly the same position on mouse and human promoters,
while in other genes, such as the E2F1 and YY1 genes, the
TFBS pairs are in vastly different locations. We thus hypothesize that it is very unlikely that traditional approaches like
phylogenetic footprinting could identify all of these putative
synergistic TF interactions. To test this hypothesis, we used
the rVista program to perform phylogenetic footprinting to
search for conserved binding sites between human and
mouse promoter sequences for all genes [57]. Notably,
although phylogenetic footprinting detected synergistic
TFBSs for four genes, it missed the remainder (Figure 6a). It
is important to note that the majority of these genes are regu-

lated by E2F1, as their promoters were experimentally proven
to be bound by E2F1. These genes include STAG1 [58], YY1
[58], CDCA7L [58], RNF167 [58], FBN2 [58], NULP1 [58],
DTNB [58], MYBL2 [59], and E2F1 [25,60]. Phylogenetic
footprinting was not able to detect any E2F1 binding site in
promoters of the E2F1, STAG1, YY1, CDCA7L, and NULP1
genes.
To investigate whether the predicted combinatorial TFBSs
that were not detected by phylogenetic footprinting are truly
functional ones, we searched for genes whose promoters have
experimentally proven synergistic E2F1 binding sites. One
promoter of the above five genes, the E2F1 promoter, was
well-characterized from both human and mouse to be
synergistically bound by E2F1 (representing a self-regulatory
loop) [25,60]. Sequence comparisons of both E2F1 binding
sites (Figure 6b), as well as the entire promoter sequences
from both human and mouse, indicated that our predicted
E2F1 binding sites were exactly those experimentally proven,
functional E2F1 binding site combinations on E2F1 promoters. This observation suggests that other predicted synergistic
E2F1 binding sites, without experimental evidence, likely represent functionally conserved elements, despite the fact that
the relative locations of binding sites might vary between species. A good example is the ACVR1 gene with two E2F1 binding site clusters containing a total of five putative binding
sites, which show a similar arrangement between orthologous
genes but are located at different positions on the promoter.
A closer examination demonstrates that these two clusters are
highly conserved in regards to both nucleotide sequence and
spacing between each binding site within each cluster (Figure
6b), suggesting that they are indeed functionally conserved.
Importantly, phylogenetic footprinting detected only one of
the five E2F1 binding sites in the ACVR1 gene.

Quantitative comparisons of function conservation
with other methods
The above results indicated that our approach was able to
identify more truly functional TFBSs than phylogenetic footprinting. We also performed further studies to make quantitative comparisons of our function conservation method with

phylogenetic footprinting and the enhancer element locator
(EEL) algorithm [61]; the latter also employs distance constraints to help identify interacting TFs. To facilitate this
analysis, we obtained a set of 6,183 human genes whose promoters were experimentally proven to be bound by E2F1
within 1 kb upstream of the TSS in HeLa cells [58]. Out of
these promoters, 1,591 (Additional data file 1) are in the promoter list of human genes used in this study and have at least
one E2F1 binding site (PWM: E2F1_Q3_01). We first sought
to obtain promoters with combinatorial E2F1 binding sites
with given distance constraints. We subsequently computed
the conditional probability that synergistic E2F1 binding sites
are spaced in a given distance constraint, given E2F1 binding
sites in these E2F1 target promoters. This conditional
probability, as measured from real promoters, was then compared to those measured from promoters with shuffled
sequences and used to compute the statistical significance for
each individual distance constraint. We observed significance
of E2F1 synergy for distance constraints from 10 bp to 600 bp
(p values from 5 × 10-4 to 6 × 10-34 with q-value < 0.001) and
obtained the corresponding promoters (Table 4).
Using these human gene promoters with combinatorial E2F1
binding sites (see Additional data file 2), we next assessed the
sensitivity and specificity for detecting synergistic E2F1 combinations by function conservation and phylogenetic
footprinting. In this analysis, real promoters were used as
true positives and the corresponding randomized promoters
with shuffled nucleotides as true negatives. Sensitivity (the
fraction of promoters that were identified to have combinatorial E2F1 binding sites) was defined as the proportion of true
positives over combined true positives and false negatives,
and specificity as the proportion of true negatives over combined true negatives and false positives, the latter being the

fraction of randomized promoters that were identified to have
synergistic E2F1 combinations. We applied our function conservation, phylogenetic footprinting (using rVista), and EEL
(stand-alone version for pairwise analysis) to the selected
human and their corresponding mouse orthologous gene promoters. Results indicated that our function conservation
approach had much higher sensitivity (approximately tenfold) than phylogenetic footprinting for all distance constraints tested, as shown in Table 4. On the other hand, both
approaches had equally excellent specificity with no false positives detected using three sets of shuffled promoter
sequences. We were also curious to know the sensitivity of
detecting promoters with any number of conserved E2F1
binding sites by phylogenetic footprinting. Notably, although
phylogenetic footprinting was able to detect 12.9% of the 575
E2F1 target human promoters with one or more E2F1 binding
sites, the positive rate was still much lower than those from
our function conservation approach (20.3%) for combinatorial TFBS detection.
Results of this analysis further indicated that the EEL algorithm was able to detect conserved pairs or clusters of E2F1
sites in only 9 of the 575 target human promoters, demonstrating a much lower sensitivity (1.6%) than our function
conservation approach. It is interesting to note that EEL
detected multiple single E2F1 sites in many target human
promoters. Although these E2F1 sites may not be conserved
ones based on the underlying premise of the EEL algorithm,
we nonetheless manually calculated all possible combinations of E2F1 sites for each target promoter. The overestimated positive rates are listed in Table 4, where EEL still
displays much lower sensitivity (approximately 0.5-fold) than
our function conservation approach for all distance constraints tested. Furthermore, false positives were detected by

sequences (Table 4), indicating lower specificity for EEL.
Taken together, these results indicated that our approach was
able to identify conserved TFBS combinations to a much
greater extent than phylogenetic footprinting and the EEL
algorithm.

Prediction of heterotypic TF interactions and TF-TF
interaction networks
In an effort to expand our analyses to a more complex, perhaps more physiologically relevant situation, we applied our
novel approaches to identify potential heterotypic TF combinations using the selected 51 TFs; a total of 1,275 TF combinations was considered. Correlations between LODco and LODog
scores for these TF combinations had similar distributions to
those from homotypic TF combinations, ranging from -0.96

individual TFs. It is important to note that the binding sites
for the TFs in the smaller cluster are almost all AT-enriched,
while conversely, those in the larger cluster are mostly GCenriched. A closer look at the smaller cluster reveals that
HNF3B, FOX and FREAC7 (also called FOXL1), all members
of the forkhead box family of transcription factors ((([63], are
directly coupled to each other, suggesting that these TFs from
the same family may function in a synergistic fashion. We
have also performed a PubMed search to determine if SP1 is
known to physically interact with any of the 13 factors to
which it is connected by this analysis; we chose to delve into
SP1 further as it is one of the first TFs discovered and has been
highly studied. We found experimental evidence that SP1
physically interacts with EGR [64], CP2 [65], MZF1 [66],
MAZ [67], PU1 [68], CETS1P54 (ETS-1) [69], E2F1 [70], ETF
(TEF-1) [71], and KROX [72]. While SP1 binds to the GC-box
elements and ZF5 is the analogous factor of SP1 [73,74], a
couple of the factors could not be identified in PubMed by the
gene names listed in Figure 7, so their interactions with SP1
are unknown. Overall, these data suggest that this approach
is valid for identifying heterotypic TF interactions.

to 0.99 for human and from -0.94 to 0.99 for mouse (data not
shown). Statistical significance of the correlations estimated
from permutation tests indicated that the number of significant TF combinations was overwhelming, even when a highly
stringent cutoff threshold was applied (q-value < 0.01). Nevertheless, we selected 78 heterotypic TF combinations that
passed the cutoff threshold and also had high correlations in
both human and mouse (R > 0.85) for further TF interaction
analysis. We felt that this combination of using a low q-value
along with a high correlation coefficient would allow us to
minimize false positive predictions.
As shown in Figure 7, TF-TF interaction networks, utilizing
these 78 heterotypic TF pairs constructed by the InterViewer
program [62], segregated into two clusters, with a single link
between PIT1 and CETS1P54. Thirty-six TFs were predicted
to have significant interactions with one another and are represented in the figure. The smaller cluster consists of 19
synergistic TF pairs from 15 TFs, while the remaining 58 synergistic TF pairs constitute the larger cluster from 21

The identification of combinatorial TFs and the elucidation of
relationships among them are of great importance for understanding transcriptional regulation as well as TF networks.
Previous approaches employed for the identification of functional TF combinations are based on either TFBS enrichment
from co-regulated genes or phylogenetic footprinting.
Although both approaches have proven to be successful, they
each have limitations. To explore alternative approaches, we
propose a new strategy to look for synergistic TFs by function
conservation, which was implemented from functional conservation of TFs between species and corresponding TFBSs
between orthologous genes.
Although prior to our study there had not been a genomewide function-based approach for the prediction of
combinatorial TFs, several previous studies employed distance constraints to help identify interacting TFs [9,16,61],
including the EEL algorithm [61]. A side-by-side comparison
of the function conservation approach versus EEL is included
in Table 5. It is important to point out that the core
approaches for computing functional conservation at both
levels were based on genome-scale information of orthologous genes, from which both TFBS combinations and common orthologous genes whose regulatory sequences contain
the identified TFBS combinations were enriched. Integration
of function conservation from both levels by correlation analysis led to the final prediction of combinatorial TFs. While GO
analysis could provide functional annotation for the
predicted TF combinations, it was employed mainly as part of
our procedures to validate our approaches. Therefore, our
validated approaches are readily applicable to other genomes
for the prediction of physically interacting TFs and TF net-

works. This is likely the case as long as relative complete
genes and promoter sequences are available for these
genomes so that orthologous genes between closely related
species can be determined correctly by pairwise alignment
and cluster analysis.
The enrichment of functional TFBSs plays an important role
in the integration of function conservation from different
levels by correlation analyses, as the functional conservation
of TFs is based on genes whose promoter sequences contain

over-represented binding sites. In this study, TFBS enrichment was achieved by first obtaining all potential TFBSs on a
genome-scale, followed by searching for TFBS combinations
by using distance constraints. Although this method was successful, other methods can also be used as long as they are
able to identify over-represented TFBSs or reliably distinguish functional from non-functional TFBSs. Therefore, the
strategy of function conservation is not limited to synergistic
TF discovery, but is applicable to single TFs and even transcriptional regulatory modules.

The distinct advantage of using distance constraints for
enrichment of TFBSs is that it not only provided a simple
means for enriching functional TFBS combinations for a large
number of genes, but it also allowed us to compute correlation with many enrichment results. The latter is especially
important, as a large number of TFBS enrichments with
changing LODco score trends would contribute more to functional TFBS identification, when compared to a small number
of TFBS enrichments identified by other methods. The validity of using distance constraints for enriching TFBS
combinations was demonstrated not only by our study, in
which the LODco scores from no distance constraint were significantly smaller than those with distance constraints (p <
10-15), but also previous studies by other authors [9,16].
A related question is if there exist optimal distance constraints for all TFBSs, which would result in significant and
optimal correlations between LODco and LODog scores for
individual distance constraints. We reasoned that an optimal
distance constraint is most likely to have not only a significantly large correlation but also a higher correlation than
those from its two adjacent distance constraints. Interestingly, although LODog and LODco scores displayed general
patterns of increasing correlations along with smaller
between-TFBS distance (data not shown), none of these cor-

relations were statistically significant (p > 0.3), based on random correlations from 10,000 permuted LODco and LODog
scores from the same distance constraint. Although no
optimal distance constraints were found for all TFBSs, we
noticed that correlations between TFBS enrichment and common orthologous gene enrichment from those 51 selected
TFBS combinations displayed significance for some, but not
all, distance constraints (Figure 5). These results indicated
that optimal distance constraints, if any, might vary among
different TFBSs.
The incorporation of functional conservation of TFs can provide further stringency for synergistic TF discovery, since
computational methods for enriching or characterizing functional TFBSs are likely to contain false predictions. In this
study, the analyses of concordance of TFBS enrichment with
overlapping orthologous gene enrichment are clearly appropriate for identifying functional TF combinations, as correlations detect the agreement between TFBS enrichment and
orthologous gene enrichment, no matter whether all the
enriched TFBSs are functional ones or not. We thus employed
correlation analyses to achieve integration of function conservation from both TF and TFBS levels. Although correlation
between LODco and LODog scores from each individual TFBS
would provide a direct measurement for its functional co-

occurrence, it did not necessarily reflect the degree of similar
changing trends between LODco and LODog scores, which was
especially important for the detection of functionally cooccurring TFBSs, as not all enriched TFBSs truly represent
functional interactions. We also found that permutation tests
for estimating the statistical significance of correlations is
appropriate for not only setting up the cutoff threshold for the
selection of the most statistically significant correlations from
multiple analyses, but also for selecting TFBSs with similar
trends between LODco and LODog scores.
The validity of functional conservation of TFBSs was also
assessed by experiments from our previous investigations. In
a study to identify common transcriptional regulatory elements in a group of interleukin-17 target genes [75], we
employed a similar approach to obtain all potential TFBSs
and looked for conserved TFBSs based on the pattern of TFBS
arrangement on promoter sequences. TFs NF-κB and C/EBP
were found to mediate combinatorial regulation for interleukin-17 target genes, which was validated by both luciferase
reporter gene and gel shift assays. These observations provide
direct proof that our computational methods can predict
functional TFBSs.

In another investigation, we utilized a similar approach to
identify over-represented TFBSs in a group of genes induced
in the intestine of iron-deficient rats [76]. Microarray and
clustering analyses led to the identification of 228
upregulated genes during iron-deficiency across several
stages of postnatal development. We pulled promoter
sequences for these genes in rats, mice and humans and performed enrichment analysis for TFBSs. Our results indicated
that SP1-like binding sites were significantly over-represented in our experimental genes in all three species compared to random background sequences. Our analyses also
predicted that SP1or a related TF could function in a synergistic fashion with the FOX TF to regulate some of our identified
genes. We then inspected the promoter sequences of genes
containing the predicted binding sites for the location and
sequence of the TFBSs. Strikingly, we found that the SP1 and
FOX binding sites were highly conserved in many of these
genes; in some cases, the sequence and location in the promoters across species was identical while in other cases, the
sequence and spacing were conserved, but the relative location of the binding sites was variable. These observations
again emphasize the point that traditional methods such as
phylogenetic footprinting are likely to miss important, conserved elements, and further that our novel approaches are a

Conclusion

Previous methods employed for the identification of functional TF combinations are based on either TFBS enrichment
from co-regulated genes or phylogenetic footprinting. In this
study, we have proposed the use of function conservation for
the identification of TF combinations and have developed
computational approaches to implement this novel strategy.
These approaches include functional TFBS enrichment based
on the pattern of binding site arrangement on promoters of
orthologous genes by distance constraint, enrichment of
overlapping orthologous genes whose regulatory sequences
contain the enriched TFBS combinations, and integration of
function conservation from both TF and TFBS levels by correlation analyses. To assess the usefulness of these approaches,
we have applied them to human and mouse orthologous
promoter sequences. Genome-wide promoter analyses have
led to the identification of 51 homotypic TF combinations,
which were validated by both known TF-TF interactions and
function coherence analyses. The main advantage of our
strategy lies in the fact that it does not depend on sequence
alignment but rather genome information, thus providing an
alternative method for functional TF discovery and annotation. We have further compared our approach directly with
phylogenetic footprinting and clearly demonstrated that
function conservation analysis was better able to predict synergistic, functional TFBSs. Overall, this study has introduced
a novel approach for the discovery of functional TFBSs, which
should be applicable to any species for which genome information is available.

Materials and methods
Promoter sequence sources
Orthologous genes between human and mouse were obtained
from the 'relational table between human and mouse mutu-

ally orthologous genes' in DBTSS, which contains approximately 12,020 orthologous gene pairs. Out of these
orthologous genes, 10,046 have defined promoter sequences
for both human and mouse. Alternative promoter 1 was used
for all genes, as alternative promoter 1 is the most upstream
promoter in the case of multiple alternative promoters for a
gene in DBTSS. Promoter sequences within 1 kb upstream of
the annotated TSS of the 10,046 genes for both human (Additional data file 3) and mouse (Additional data file 4) were
extracted from DBTSS and used for TFBS detection with the
repeat sequences unmasked.

TFBS detection
To perform the measurement for significant co-occurrence of
TFBSs, an appropriate randomly generated background
model is necessary. A Perl script was written to shuffle the
DNA sequences within each promoter to create background
sequences that have the same nucleotide content as the original promoter sequences. These background sequences are
preferable to using intergenic sequences, which usually are
AT-rich or exonic sequences whose nucleotide distributions
tend to be biased. The resulting two sets of shuffled sequences
from human and mouse, together with the original two sets of
promoter sequences, were used for TFBS detection. To provide important information for estimating statistical significance for single gene pairwise comparisons, multiple shuffled
sequences as background are usually employed. In our case,
however, multiple sets of shuffled promoter sequences as
background are not necessary, since no direct pairwise gene
comparisons were performed; instead, comparisons were
performed on a genome-scale using all shuffled sequences as
background. The Match® program [22], for which the profile
parameter was set to be 'minimize the sum of false positives
and negatives', was employed to conduct searches for TFBSs
using vertebrate position weight matrices from the professional TRANSFAC 9.1 database. To eliminate redundant
PWMs for the same TF (prefix of the 'Identifier'), the one with
largest TFBS enrichment (see next section) or with highest
quality control for building the PWM was selected, which

resulted in 234 PWMs (Additional data file 5) for unique factors in this study.

Enrichment of TFBS combinations by distance
constraints
The co-occurrence of TFBSs was defined as two or more binding sites in the same promoter, which can be TFBSs either
from the same PWM or from two PWMs. For combinatorial
TFBS enrichment, distance constraints were first applied for
the selection of co-occurring TFBSs with a certain defined
maximum between-TFBS distance, which is the largest
number of nucleotides allowed between the end of the first
TFBS and the start of the next TFBS. In the case of two PWMs,
the distance constraints were applied to TFBSs from 2 different PWMs but not from an identical PWM, and the number of
TFBS from each individual PWM may vary. To prevent double counting of TFBSs, two overlapping matches for the same
PWM were considered as a single match and the one closer to
the next co-occurring TFBS was counted. A total of 18 distances were defined, ranging from the smallest 10 bp to the
largest 900 bp, for which 10 bp increments were used for
those with distance constraints of less than 100 bp and 100 bp
increments for those with distance constraints of more than
100 bp. The counts of co-occurring TFBSs from distance constraints with smaller between-TFBS distances were also
included in those with larger between-TFBS distances. The
occurrence of TFBSs without a distance constraint was also
computed, but overlapping TFBSs were counted only once.
All calculations were separately computed using in-house
developed Perl scripts (Additional data file 6).
The log odds ratio (LOD) was used to measure TFBS enrichment, which is the frequency of co-occurrence for a particular
TFBS in real promoter sequences with respect to random
expectation for the co-occurrence of the same TFBS from one
corresponding set of shuffled promoter sequences:

⎛ f (# TFBS /# promoters ) ⎞
LOD co = ln ⎜ r
⎟
⎝ f s (# TFBS /# promoters ) ⎠
Where fr(#TFBS/#promoters) is the TFBS frequency per
gene from real promoter sequences, and fs(#TFBS/#promoters) is the frequency from shuffled promoter sequences.

Enrichment analyses of overlapping orthologous genes
For enrichment analyses of overlapping orthologous genes,
genes whose promoter sequences contain at least two cooccurring TFBSs were obtained from both human and mouse.
The p value for the between species enrichment of overlapping orthologous genes, which contained the same TFBS
combinations from the same enforced distance constraint in
both human and mouse, was computed using a hypergeometric distribution:

∑
x =c

Where S1 and S2 are the numbers of genes whose promoters
possess the co-occurring TFBSs from either mouse or human,
respectively; N is the total number of orthologous gene pairs
used in this study (N = 10,046); and c is the number of common orthologous genes between S1 and S2. The resulting p
value is the chance probability of observing c or more common orthologous genes from two sets of size S1 and S2 drawn
from a set of N gene pairs. The enrichment analyses of overlapping orthologous genes were performed for both original
and shuffled promoter sequences. The latter, as described
below, was obtained for the purpose of normalization.
For computing the correlation between the TFBS enrichment
utilizing distance constraints and the overlapping orthologous gene enrichment, the p values of overlapping orthologous gene enrichment from original promoter sequences
were first (-)log transformed and then normalized with the
corresponding (-)log transformed p values from shuffled
promoter sequences. To have a similar scale as LODco, the
LOD for overlapping orthologous gene enrichment was computed as follows:

⎛ −log( p − value _ of _ original _ promoter ) ⎞
LOD og = ln ⎜
⎟
⎝ −log( p − value _ of _ shuffled _ promoter ) ⎠

Analyses of correlations between the TFBS
enrichment and the overlapping orthologous gene
enrichment
Pearson correlation coefficients were employed to estimate
the correlation between the 19 LODco and their corresponding
LODog scores for each TFBS combination, and permutation
tests were employed to estimate the statistical significance of
the correlation. To perform the permutation tests, the 19
LODco and their corresponding LODog scores from each TFBS
combination were randomly paired and used for random correlation computation. The procedures were repeated 10,000
times to reach a random distribution and to give sufficient
power for the estimation of p values. The resulting p values
were used to set up a cutoff threshold (q-value < 0.05) for the
selection of the most statistically significant correlation from
multiple analyses.
