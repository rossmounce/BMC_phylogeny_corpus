Abstract
Background: DNA repair genes encode proteins that protect organisms against genetic damage
generated by environmental agents and by-products of cell metabolism. The importance of these
genes in life maintenance is supported by their high conservation, and the presence of duplications
of such genes may be easily traced, especially in prokaryotic genomes.
Results: The genome sequences of two Xanthomonas species were used as the basis for
phylogenetic analyses of genes related to DNA repair that were found duplicated. Although 16S
rRNA phylogenetic analyses confirm their classification at the basis of the gamma proteobacteria
subdivision, differences were found in the origin of the various genes investigated. Except for lexA,
detected as a recent duplication, most of the genes in more than one copy are represented by two
highly divergent orthologs. Basically, one of such duplications is frequently positioned close to
other gamma proteobacteria, but the second is often positioned close to unrelated bacteria. These
orthologs may have occurred from old duplication events, followed by extensive gene loss, or were
originated from lateral gene transfer (LGT), as is the case of the uvrD homolog.
Conclusions: Duplications of DNA repair related genes may result in redundancy and also
improve the organisms' responses to environmental challenges. Most of such duplications, in
Xanthomonas, seem to have arisen from old events and possibly enlarge both functional and
evolutionary genome potentiality.

Background
The availability of complete genome sequences from different organisms makes it possible to identify, by similarity, potential homologs of genes that have been

experimentally tested in other living beings, resulting in
the recognition of putative functions for the proteins
encoded by them. This research concept represents a revolutionary tool in modern biology, as the data generated

allow for recognition of the presence or absence of genes,
giving indications of the metabolic pathways present in
such organisms and revealing possible particularities of
the individuals in their natural habitat. Moreover, the possibility of obtaining gene sequences from organisms that
have long diverged makes it feasible to use these data to
trace their evolutionary origin [1]. Computer analysis of
genome data, and its capacity to rapidly generate relevant
information, contributes to a better understanding of the
different evolutionary histories, especially within prokaryotes. The inferred relationship among organisms, as first
defined by the use of 16S rRNA sequences, was later confirmed either by the utilization of many other conserved
genes [2,3] or even by alternative strategies to trace evolution with genetic data [4]. However, the utilization of a
single gene to describe the organism evolution has been
contested due to genomic complexity. In fact, the accumulated data have brought evidence to sustain that many
prokaryotic genes do not follow vertical transmission,
revealing the occurrence of gene exchange among different species, a phenomenon known as horizontal or lateral
gene transfer (LGT, reviewed by Ochman [5]).
All known forms of life present efficient systems to maintain the integrity of their genetic material. As DNA is
under constant attack by different environmental agents
and metabolic by-products, evolution has provided
organisms with several DNA repair pathways to remove or
to tolerate lesions in their genetic material. In fact, these
pathways have at least two important contrasting roles in
evolution, safeguarding the genome, and allowing for a
certain level of mutations in the course of evolution. The
critical balance of these two activities is probably the best
reason for the high levels of conservation observed in
DNA repair related proteins, even across the three kingdoms, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. Detailed studies of
many of the different DNA repair genes and protein
domains have been described previously [6,7], confirming that information on DNA repair genes may be very
useful as a source to track genome evolution.
In this work, we investigated the DNA repair genes in the
recently described genomes from the Xanthomonadales
group [8,9] following an evolutionary perspective. The
Xanthomonadales group bacteria have a great economic
impact on agriculture in Brazil and worldwide. The characterization of DNA repair genes from these phytopathogens could help to understand the mechanisms by which
these organisms respond to environmental conditions,
including plant infection. On the other hand, this could
contribute to defining universal features relating DNA
repair with this life style. By comparing the evolutionarily
close genomes of Xanthomonas axonopodis, X. campestris
and Xylella fastidiosa, we found that certain DNA repair
genes present duplications in both Xanthomonas species.

The great relevance of gene duplication for expanding
gene families, as well as for gene innovation, is a consensus among researchers. New genes can facilitate survival in
new environments or make possible the use of new
metabolites. We investigated the phylogeny of such duplicated genes, in search of evidence on the mechanisms by
which cells evolve their DNA repair machinery. Although
most DNA repair genes follow the conserved vertical
transmission found for 16S rRNA phylogeny, the data
clearly show that duplications may have arisen by different means. Examples of a recent duplication, as well as of
other old or LGT events, generating paralogs, are presented. These results also help in tracing the origins of
LGT events that lead to redundancy and also to functional
diversification, especially of Xanthomonas bacteria.

Results and Discussion
DNA repair-related genes are normally highly conserved,
and grant good genetic information for investigating the
evolution of organisms. Orthologs of known bacterial
DNA repair proteins were identified in the plant pathogen
bacteria of the Xanthomonadales group and are listed in
Table 1. The different gene content of these closely related
bacterial species are of particular interest, given that they
can reveal gene loss or acquisition as a consequence of
their different lifestyles. Few genes are missing in the
genome of X. fastidiosa, when compared to both Xanthomonas species: ada-alkA (fusion), tag, phr, dinB and ligB.
For evolution purposes, however, the presence of several
duplications, especially in the Xanthomonas genomes, will
be focused here.
The RecA protein is almost universal among bacteria and
is a clear example of phylogeny that follows 16S rRNA
gene evolution. In fact, this gene is always unique in all
genomes analyzed and has been proposed as an alternative molecule to be used in systematic studies of Bacteria
[2]. Figure 1A shows the phylogenetic tree generated for
this protein, and confirms the distinction of the main
groups of bacteria, such as Firmicutes, Chlamydiales, Spirochaetales and Proteobacteria. Among the proteobacteria, the Xanthomonadales branch is independently
positioned at the root of gamma subdivision. It is important to note that although this seems to be consistent with
the classification of these bacteria as part of gamma proteobacteria, very often the trees, from these and other proteins (see below), place the Xanthomonadales in the same
branch as beta proteobacteria (Neisseria and Ralstonia).
In E. coli, the RecA protein has been shown to participate
in recombinational repair, as well as in the control of a set
of physiological changes to DNA damage, known as SOS
response. The induction of this regulon stems from the coprotease activity of the RecA protein, which cleaves a
repressor protein, denominated LexA, allowing the

expression of the set of SOS genes. The presence of lexA
and recA homologs in the Xanthomonadales indicates
that these bacteria also present a SOS regulon. However,
in Xanthomonas genomes, there are two copies of the lexA
gene. The phylogeny of LexA proteins is presented in Figure 1B. The general topology of this tree indicates that
LexA evolution follows a similar pattern to RecA, although
the lexA gene is not found in all groups of bacteria. The
products of the two copies of the Xanthomonas lexA paralogs are positioned close together in the same branch of
Xanthomonadales, indicating a recent duplication of such
a gene. The fact that they had branched before Xylella's single lexA divergence indicates that this bacterium may have
lost the duplication. Gene losses are expected to be extensive in Xylella, in agreement with this bacterium having a
more specialized parasitic way of life [10]. The duplication of lexA in Xanthomonas points to a highly controlled
SOS regulon, that may be important for fine-tuning the
bacterial responses to stress induced in environmental
changes. Indeed, functional characterization of lexA1 in X.
campestris has been performed by gene disruption, and the
data indicate this protein controls the expression of the
recA gene, as expected for the SOS regulatory circuit [11].
The function of the second paralog, however, remains to
be elucidated. Recent report indicates that the disruption
of the lexA gene in Deinococcus radiodurans does not
change the level of RecA expression, suggesting that LexA
protein may be related to functions other than controlling
the SOS regulon in that organism [12].
The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is one of
the most important, versatile and conserved systems of
DNA damage removal in bacteria. It recognizes damages,
which cause significant helix distortions in the DNA molecule, these being excised as an oligonucleotide by several
enzymes that act as helicases and endonucleases. The
main proteins that participate in such a pathway are
known as UvrA, UvrB and UvrC, which, in sequential

steps, interact with one another, recognize the damaged
strand (UvrA), open the double helix (UvrB), and cleave
DNA (UvrC) at both sides, few nucleotides away from the
lesion. Subsequently, the oligonucleotide containing the
damage is removed by a DNA helicase known as UvrD.
The uvrB gene from X. campestris has been cloned and it
was shown to participate in the resistance of these bacteria
after UV irradiation [13]. The NER proteins are very well
conserved and universal among bacteria. A complete set
of orthologs of these genes is also found in a few species
of the group Euryarchaeote: Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, Methanosarcina sp and Halobacterium sp. NRC1 [14]. Other archaea may have a different unknown NER
system [15].
The genes uvrA, uvrC and uvrD are duplicated in Xanthomonas and the phylogenies of the proteins encoded by
these orthologs, together with the single uvrB, are presented in figure 2. In general, the evolution of these proteins, particularly UvrB (figure 2B), follows a pattern
similar to RecA, the NER protein of Xanthomonas being
positioned in the same branch of the Xylella's ortholog,
close to gamma proteobacteria as expected for a vertical
descent. However, for the duplications, the patterns are
different and more complex. The second ortholog of uvrA
in X. axonopodis is phylogenetically closer to the also
duplicated genes found in several other bacteria (figure
2A), thus indicating an old duplication event in evolution. The absence of this ortholog in most of the proteobacteria could be due to extensive gene loss. However, the
phylogenetic proximity with unrelated organisms (including a duplication in D. radiodurans) points to an origin
due to horizontal gene transfer from other bacteria. The
functions of both uvrA orthologs are not necessarily
related to DNA repair, since this activity can be provided
by either one of them. It is relevant to mention that for the
duplication found in D. radiodurans, White et al [16] have
proposed a function related to the transport of damaged

DNA out of the cell. This is due to the similarity of the
UvrA protein with the ATP-binding subunit of a multifamily of genes involved in the transport across membranes, related to ABC transporters [17].
A similar pattern of evolution was observed for the phylogeny of UvrC protein (figure 2C). One of the two copies
present in X. axonopodis is close to the uvrC orthologs from
other gamma proteobacteria, following a vertical transmission. However, a protein with considerable similarity
to the N-terminal of UvrC is found in both Xanthomonas
species. These orthologs form an independent branch of
the phylogenetic tree of UvrC, close to a heterogeneous
group of gram-positive bacteria. The role of this second
UvrC homolog of E. coli in DNA repair (named Cho protein, for UvrC homolog) has recently been investigated in
detail, and was shown to have an endonuclease activity in
damaged DNA [18]. This protein makes an incision only
at the 3' side of the lesion, while the well-known UvrC was
demonstrated to incise both sides of the lesion in vitro
[19]. Cho may backup UvrC in the repair process of certain kinds of obstructive damage, possibly broadening the
repair capacity of the excision pathway in these bacteria
[20]. The origin of such orthologs is not clear, and
although other bacteria may present protein domains that
have some similarity to Cho endonuclease, known complete Cho homologs are limited to the Azotobacter vinelandii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shiguella
flexneri, and Xanthomonas. Curiously, in Beta proteobacteria, Ralstonia metallidurans and Chromobacterium violaceum,
an endonuclease domain similar to Cho appears as a Cterminal fusion with a putative 3'-exonuclease, corresponding to the epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III. A
similar fusion protein was found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and an interesting coordinated action of these two
activities (endonuclease and exonuclease) was proposed
as a new mechanism of DNA repair [20]. A former duplication could explain the origin of cho in these bacteria,
but, again, one would have to concede extensive gene loss
in other species. Once more, horizontal transfer events,
involving part of the uvrC gene (the one that encodes the
N-terminal) to some gamma proteobacteria, could
explain the limited occurrence of cho only in these bacteria. Moreover, some organisms present a duplication of
the complete uvrC gene (Clostridium acetobutylicum and
Listeria). The proteins encoded by these paralogs are
closely positioned in the tree, thus indicating a recent origin for them, and, possibly, functional redundancy.
The uvrD gene is part of a DNA helicase family, which
includes the pcrA and rep genes [21]. The uvrD gene participates in the removal of damaged DNA strand, after the
incision steps of NER or DNA mismatch repair have
occurred. The evolution tree of these proteins is presented
in figure 2D. Similar to uvrA and uvrC, there are two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/29

orthologs for these genes in the X. axonopodis genome.
One of the orthologs encoded by the uvrD gene is closer
to the gamma proteobacteria, branching with X. fastidiosa,
following a typical vertical inheritance, while the second
is similar to proteins from other prokaryotes, including
Archaea and Bacteria, mainly from the firmicutes and
alpha proteobacteria groups. The second ortholog of this
gene from Sinorhizobium meliloti is found in plasmid DNA
for which an alien origin is suggested, due to its lower GC
content [22]. Additional analysis of the uvrD duplication
in the X. axonopodis genome indicates that it is located
close to transposon-related genes (Figure 3), the G+C content within this region (58.2%) being low when compared to what is found in the rest of the genome (average
64.7%). Moreover, the closest ortholog of this gene is also
found in a plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (figure
2D). These data are compatible with a recent LGT event
for this gene. The absence of uvrD duplication in the
genome of X. campestris gives further support to the LGT
hypothesis, indicating that it has been recently acquired in
the X. axonopodis genome, possibly by means of plasmid
transfer and/or transposon insertion.
Base excision repair (BER) protects genetic material from
a wide range of DNA damaging agents [23]. The plasticity
of this repair pathway is given by the presence of several
different glycosylases, lesion recognition proteins that
catalyze the first step in BER. The three organisms present
similar sets of glycosylases, but X. fastidiosa bears two
identical copies of fpg, probably due to its close proximity
to the also duplicated rRNA genes [8]. This duplication
may also provide to this bacterium, an enhanced protection against oxidative DNA damage. The presence of
duplicated xthA homologs (apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease) in both Xanthomonas is another remarkable feature of BER in this group. Phylogenetic trees generated for
this protein family show these orthologs located in different branches, indicating that the duplication is not a
recent event. However, a miscellaneous branching pattern
of the tree obtained for the different bacterial groups,
results difficult to track the evolution of these genes (data
not shown).
The DNA ligases catalyze the joining of breaks in the
phosphodiester backbone of the DNA molecule and,
thus, play an essential role in several processes of DNA
repair, replication and recombination. These enzymes are
evolutionary related, although two distinct families of
DNA ligases are found: one that is typical for Bacteria,
using NAD+ as cofactor, and a second that is typical of
Eukaryotes and Archaea, but using ATP as cofactor
(reviewed by Wilkinson et al [24]). As for all bacteria, only
single copies of the ligA gene, encoding the NAD-dependent DNA ligase, is found in the Xanthomonas and Xylella
genomes. The phylogeny for these proteins is presented in

figure 4A, and it clearly follows a vertical descent, with the
Xanthomonadales branch close to gamma and beta proteobacteria. However, as described for other bacteria, both
Xanthomonas genomes present extra copies of putative
ATP-dependent DNA ligases (two in X. axonopodis and
three in X. campestris). The phylogenetic tree of ATPdependent DNA ligases is shown in figure 4B. There is a
clear independent branch, where most of the archaeal
ATP-dependent DNA ligases are found, except for the
orthologs observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Streptomyces coelicolor. The other bacterial orthologs
branch independently, wherein alpha proteobacteria
predominate. A curious observation is the high and variable number of ATP DNA-ligases within the genomes of
plant symbiontes, especially in the alpha proteobacteria
(six in Agrobacterium tumefasciens, nine in Sinorhizobium
meliloti and eleven in Mesorhizobium loti). It is possible that
these X. axonopodis genes may have arisen from recent
duplications, soon after gene introduction in alpha proteobacteria, probably by means of LGT from Archaea. The
fact that these bacteria inhabit a common niche in plants
could facilitate mutual gene exchange. However, the function of such ligases in these bacteria is unknown. As the
NAD (+)-dependent ligase is present in all bacterial
genomes, these Archaea-related ligase orthologs, present
in certain bacteria, seem to be redundant, their roles in
cell metabolism remaining a puzzle. Since NAD+-dependent DNA ligases are typically eubacterial, and cannot be
replaced [24], the presence of additional ATP-dependent
ligases is an unsolved question. Several lines of evidence
indicate that the ligation reactions can be processed with

different fidelity depending on the enzyme. Bacterial
NAD+-dependent DNA ligases appear to perform more
accurate ligation reactions, with few mispaired nucleotides being allowed in the DNA extremities [25]. NAD+dependent DNA ligase from Thermus species exhibit
enhanced mismatched ligations under certain conditions
but catalyze reactions with 1–2 orders of magnitude more
discriminative towards correct nucleotide matches than
the ATP-dependent DNA ligase from T4-phage [26].
Working with the ATP-dependent DNA ligase from the
hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakaraensis,
Nakatani et al [27] found that the enzyme could seal substrates with mismatched base-pairing at the 5' end of the
nick, but did not show activity towards the 3' mismatched
substrates.
Therefore, the presence of ATP-dependent DNA ligases in
certain bacteria could be connected to the ligation of DNA
breaks under several contexts that would generate genetic
variability, with possible evolutionary advantages. In the
alpha-proteobacteria group, a non homologous end joining appears to be important for the integration of inserting elements in the genome of host plants, as occurs with
Agrobacterium sp T-DNA [28] or for the amplification of
Rhizobium species amplicons present in pNGR234 plasmid
[29]. In Xanthomonas the presence of the ATP-dependent
DNA ligase could also be linked to the elevated number of
transposable elements [9]. However, the association of
this type of DNA ligase with specific processes that lead to
genetic variability, as proposed above, is still under
investigation.
Some other features of the DNA repair genes in Xanthomonadales are interesting to mention (Table 1). The
absence of a putative photolyase gene (phr) in X. fastidiosa,
while present in both Xanthomonas, may be related to its
limited habitat within the plant xylem or inside the insect
vector [8]. It is also remarkable that only X. campestris
bears the umuC and umuD genes, which encode the DNA
polymerase V (UmuD'2C), related to translesion synthesis
[30]. In fact, both genes are located at the genome close to
bacteriophage related genes [9], suggesting a recent acquisition by LGT, in a similar manner to X. axonopodis uvrD2
gene.

Conclusions
Since the genomes of Xanthomonas (5.1 Mbp) are much
larger than that of X. fastidiosa (2.7 Mbp), it was not a surprise to find more duplicated DNA repair genes in the
former bacteria. Mechanisms for the protection of genetic
information may reflect how the organism deals with
stress and a hostile environment. Thus, the increased
number of DNA repair genes in Xanthomonas may be due
to the fact that these bacteria have a more variable habitat
when compared to Xylella, which lives most of the time

inside its hosts as a parasite. In this work, DNA repair
genes, which appeared duplicated in the genomes, were
analyzed focusing on their evolution, although it should
be pointed out that their functions in vivo remain to be
investigated. The duplicated genes found in Xanthomonas
have close orthologs in other bacteria. As Xanthomonas are
very closely related to Xylella, it is thus possible that, in
these cases, duplications arose before the split Xanthomonas-Xylella, and were lost in the latter.
For the genes investigated, evolution patterns indicate that
duplicated genes may result mainly from relatively
ancient origins. Phylogenetic errors of construction, such
as long branch attraction effect, cannot be completely
excluded, although the presence of close orthologs reinforce the trees generated. Moreover, the duplications are
normally positioned near to orthologs also found in the
genomes of some distantly related bacteria. A clear exception is the most likely recent duplication found for the
lexA paralogs of Xanthomonas, but this seems to be an unusual example. The possibility that gene duplications
would have occurred in an early common ancestor, followed by gene loss in most other bacteria, cannot be the
only explanation for many of the genes analyzed. Therefore, horizontal gene transfer among different bacteria
possibly originated some of these paralogs. A clear example of recent LGT is the uvrD duplication, which is often
found associated with DNA mobile elements. An origin
from other life kingdoms may also have occurred, as for
the ATP dependent DNA ligase, a common ligase in
Archaea, which may have been acquired and were established in certain bacterial genomes, including Xanthomonas. The LGT, more than any other genetic process,
makes possible faster ecological changes with the immediate incorporation of a gene or group of genes [31]. Eventually, organisms may acquire pathogenic features by LGT
events [32,33]. In fact, a more efficient DNA repair system
to protect genetic information would provide pathogenic
organisms with tools to respond to stress caused in the
host-pathogen interaction [10].
The new genes acquired by lateral gene exchange are
expected to be maintained when they provide a selective
advantage to the recipient cell [5]. For the DNA repair
genes investigated in this study, most resulted in redundancy, pointing to function diversification among the
orthologs. This seems to be the case of the uvrC homolog
(cho), which has been found to have a complementary
function in E. coli [18-20]. The fact that the closest
orthologs, such as ATP dependent DNA ligases, are also
observed in other bacteria that interact with plants may
indicate both that they may play important roles in this
interaction and in their necessity to adapt to the host. A
common niche could also favor genetic exchange among

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/29

these bacteria and would provide for the possibility of
their sharing similar molecular mechanisms.
In Mycobacterium tuberculosis some DNA repair genes are
induced by DNA damage, independently of the RecA protein [34]. Among them are orthologs of uvrA, uvrD and
ligB, which are duplicated in Xanthomonas. This novel
mechanism present in M. tuberculosis may also occur in
Xanthomonas and support the idea that these duplications
are also required protecting the genome against damage.
Curiously, the duplicated genes found in Xanthomonas do
not replace the orthologs that present vertical inheritance,
similar to 16S rRNA. This reinforces the idea that they may
complement the known DNA repair mechanisms with
other different functions. The search for such novel functions for these genes may not only improve our knowledge on how cells protect their genomes against DNA
damage, but also about how DNA repair processes evolve
in bacteria.

Methods
Sequences of DNA repair-related proteins were obtained
at the National Center of Biotechnology Information
GenBank database (35). The list of organisms, with abbreviations used and proteins analyzed, is shown in Table 2.
An expanded version, containing all accession numbers of
the genes employed in phylogenetic analyses, is shown in
Table S1 (see additional file 1). The analysis of Xanthomonas was performed comparing the two different
genomes of the species X. axonopodis and X. campestris. As
most of their genes are very similar, only X. axonopodis
homologs are shown, differences being described in the
text. Protein sequences from complete genomes (Bacteria
and Archaea) were aligned using the ClustalX multiple
sequence alignment program [36] with manual adjustment with Genedoc (v2.6.02). Only unambiguously
aligned positions (excluding poorly conserved and gap
regions) were used in phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic
trees were generated for each group of protein homolog
from sequence alignments using the Phylip program version 3.5 [37]. Parsimony analysis was conducted using the
Protpars program, and distance methods were performed
using the Neighbor-Joining method in Phylip, with the
distance PAM matrix model [38]. Bootstrap support (resampled 1,000 times) was calculated, and strict consensus
trees constructed. Only bootstrap values greater than 50%
are shown. Similar topologies were found for both algorithms employed, and only Neighbor-Joining is displayed. The consensus trees so obtained were viewed
through TreeView software [39]. The same set of prokaryote species was used in all analyses, although few organisms were excluded from some trees, for simplification.
The option for non-rooted trees aims at demonstrating
only relationship among organisms without, however,
linking ancestors and descendants.
