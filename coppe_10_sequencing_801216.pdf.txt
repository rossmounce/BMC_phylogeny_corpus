Abstract
Background: Once highly abundant, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.; Anguillidae; Teleostei) is considered to
be critically endangered and on the verge of extinction, as the stock has declined by 90-99% since the 1980s. Yet,
the species is poorly characterized at molecular level with little sequence information available in public databases.
Results: The first European eel transcriptome was obtained by 454 FLX Titanium sequencing of a normalized cDNA
library, produced from a pool of 18 glass eels (juveniles) from the French Atlantic coast and two sites in the
Mediterranean coast. Over 310,000 reads were assembled in a total of 19,631 transcribed contigs, with an average
length of 531 nucleotides. Overall 36% of the contigs were annotated to known protein/nucleotide sequences and
35 putative miRNA identified.
Conclusions: This study represents the first transcriptome analysis for a critically endangered species. EeelBase, a
dedicated database of annotated transcriptome sequences of the European eel is freely available at http://
compgen.bio.unipd.it/eeelbase. Considering the multiple factors potentially involved in the decline of the European
eel, including anthropogenic factors such as pollution and human-introduced diseases, our results will provide a
rich source of data to discover and identify new genes, characterize gene expression, as well as for identification of
genetic markers scattered across the genome to be used in various applications.

Background
The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.; Anguillidae;
Teleostei) is a catadromous fish species with a complex
life cycle conditioned by marine (spawning, larval phase
and maturation) and continental (feeding, growth) environments. Current available information indicates that
the overall stock is at an historical minimum in most of
the distribution area and continues to decline, while
fishing mortality is still high both on juveniles (glass
eels) and adults (yellow and silver eels) [1]. At present,
recruitment is dramatically low, with a sharp and widespread reduction by 90-99% as compared to recruitment

prior to 1980 [2]. Several hypotheses have been put forward concerning the causes of the eel stock decline,
including anthropogenic factors affecting eels during
their continental phase of the life-cycle (overfishing,
migration barriers, pollution and human-introduced diseases; [3]) and climatic events affecting eels during the
oceanic phase [4,5]. The European eel was included in
2007 in Appendix II of the Convention on International
Trade of Endangered Species (CITES; http://www.cites.
org) and was listed in 2008 as critically endangered in
the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species http://www.
iucnredlist.org. A management framework for the recovery of the European eel stock was established in 2007 by
the Council of the European Union through a dedicated
regulation (EU 1100/2007) for eel recovery and sustainable use of the stock requiring the preparation of
national eel management plans from any Member

States. Current demand for eels cannot be met by
fisheries and relies on aquaculture instead, based on
wild-caught juvenile eels as artificial reproduction of the
species is not yet feasible [1].
From this perspective, an evaluation of European eel
population genetic structure, genetic diversity, effective
(spawning) population size, and possible evolutionary
responses to anthropogenic environmental stress is crucial. Traditionally, these issues have been addressed by
studying a limited number of markers due to the shortage of genomic sequence resources available for eels. No
genome sequencing have been conducted for any anguillid species so far and all the species within the genus
Anguilla are still poorly characterized at the molecular
level. For the species A. anguilla only 232 proteins are
available. Similarly, only 121 ESTs and 404 nucleotide
sequences are known, the latter including the complete
mitochondrial genome (NCBI databases 9/25/2010),
encoding 13 peptides.
Next-generation sequencing techniques such as 454
pyrosequencing methodology allow for a massive characterization of expressed genes [6-10]. A complete characterization of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) provides an
overview of the transcriptome, i.e. those genes expressed
in a given tissue at a given time [11]. Initially, pyrosequencing was restricted to model organisms [12-15] because of
the short reads (100-200 bp) produced that make de novo
genome assembly difficult without a reference genome.
However, the more accurate base calling and deeper
sequencing coverage of the 454 approach means that transcribed genes of non-model organisms can be characterized without a pre-existing sequence reference. Recently,
454 pyrosequencing has been successfully applied to largescale EST sequencing in non-model organisms [16],
including insects [17,18], plants [19-21] and corals [22]. In
fish, characterized transcriptomes include the whitefish
Corenogus clupeaformis [23], the eelpout Zoarces viviparus
[24], the lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens [25] and the
cichlid Amphilophus sp. [26]. Pyrosequencing of ESTs can
be used to characterize gene expression, discover and
identify new genes, providing a rich data resource for identification of novel Type I genetic markers (microsatellites
and SNPs) for quantitative trait locus (QTL) and population genomic analyses. Up till now, only 196 ESTs are
available for the Japanese eel [27] and 121 ESTs for the
European eel [28]. More recently, EST sequencing of a
normalized A. anguilla cDNA library produced by the
European Marine Genomics Network of Excellence
allowed to obtain 4,893 ESTs (795 contigs and 4,008 singletons), used for the identification of putatively selected
microsatellites markers [29,30].
The non-coding portion of the transcriptome has been
largely neglected in studies focusing on non-model
organisms despite its emerging biological importance

Page 2 of 13

and the continuous discovery of novel classes of
functional non-coding RNAs [31,32]. As an example,
microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs playing an important role in the regulation of gene expression in a wide range of biological processes, including
cell differentiation, organogenesis and development,
which have been found in a wide range of organisms,
from plants to viruses and vertebrates (reviewed in
[33]). The majority of fish miRNAs have been characterised in model species (360 for Danio rerio, 131 for
Fugu rubripes and 132 for Tetraodon nigroviridis), with
the exception of rainbow trout [34].
Here we present the European eel transcriptome,
obtained by 454 FLX Titanium sequencing of over
300,000 ESTs from a normalized cDNA library, and
assembly of reads in about 19,000 contigs, representing
bona fide individual transcripts. An innovative aspect of
our study is the identification of putative European eel
miRNA sequences, by comparing reconstructed contig
sequences with known Metazoan miRNAs hairpin precursor sequences. In summary, 36% of contigs were
annotated by similarity to known protein or nucleotide
sequences, plus 35 contigs matching miRNAs sequences
known in different species were identified. A database
(EeelBase) has been established that provides the first
picture of the genomic transcriptional activity of this
economically important but endangered species. The
database will be updated in the future, if additional data
becomes available.

Results and discussion
Contigs assembly and validation

A normalised cDNA library obtained from pooling equimolar amounts of total RNA from 18 glass eels was
sequenced using the 454 Titanium platform. A single
sequencing run from a single region produced 310,079
reads, with an average sequence length of 266 nucleotides
(available at NCBI Short Read Archive SRA020995).
Using MIRA 3, sequence reads were assembled into
contigs, representing European eel transcripts. A first
run of assembly using 264,866 reads (85.4% of the total)
produced a total of 28,459 sequences, consisting of
28,229 contigs and 230 singlets. The large majority of
contigs (25,614 contigs or 91%) were assembled with
high confidence, while the remaining 2,615 contigs were
assembled despite the absence of a starting region covered by an “anchor” read with long overlap with many
other reads. Plots in Additional Files 1 and 2 describe
the distributions of length and average quality over all
assembled sequences, and illustrate pair-wise relations
between main sequence properties (see also Table 1A).
Due to the heuristic nature of the assembly process and
previous reports of redundancy (different contig
sequences belonging to the same transcript region) in

sets of transcriptome contigs assembled with different
methods [17], a second run of assembly was conducted
using the previously obtained contigs and singlets as
input. In this way, one quarter of contigs (7,510) were
further assembled in 3,048 meta-contigs, with an
increase of the average length from 455 (all contigs) to
783 nucleotides (meta-contigs). On average, metacontigs included 2.47 contigs (from 2 to 11) and were
covered by 43.2 reads.
A total of 23,997 sequences were obtained by merging
all meta-contigs with the contigs and singlets from the
first assembly not included in any meta-contig. The
number of contigs remained stable over further reassembly (data not shown), which suggests that most
redundancy had been eliminated. A further quality
check was conducted for the final set of putative transcripts by selecting only those sequences at least 200
nucleotide long and with a minimum average sequence
quality of 30 (corresponding to an average error rate of
1/1,000). A total of 19,631 transcripts were obtained
(Table 1B), with an average length of 531 nucleotides
and an average sequence quality of 45 (about 1 in
32,000 bp error rate). Transcripts included information
derived from 248,011 original reads, with an average of
12.6 reads per transcript. The GC content in the transcripts ranged from 21.86% to 67.94%, with a mean
value of 41.44% (median 41.06).
Figure in Additional File 3 shows the distribution of
sequence length and average quality in the final set of
contigs. All contigs were aligned with the set of original
reads from which they were assembled, generating multiple alignments in ACE format. These were included in
the database and might be useful for future identification of intra- and inter-specific sites of genetic variation
(SNPs, microsatellites).
To our knowledge, no general criteria have been
proposed as standard for quality evaluation of de novo
transcriptome assembly. In this sense, three aspects can
be regarded as substantial for assessing how well the
sample of assembled contig sequences represents the
actual transcriptome population: (1) gene coverage, (2)
transcript sequence quality and (3) completeness.

(1) First, we compared the ratio between number of
genes and transcripts in zebrafish Danio rerio and stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. A recent paper by Lu et
al. [35] showed that rates of alternative splicing vary
among teleost species, in terms of fraction of genes with
alternative transcripts (17% in zebrafish; 32.4% in stickleback) and average number of splicing events per gene
(1.74 in zebrafish and 1.65 in stickleback), resulting in a
different ratio between transcripts and genes (1.13 in
zebrafish, 46,571 transcripts/41,365 genes; 1.21 in stickleback, 28,071 transcripts/23,188 genes). Under the
hypothesis that the number of genes and the transcripts/genes ratio in A. anguilla is similar to that estimated for stickleback, which is reasonable considering
the highly duplicated nature of zebrafish genome [35],
the total of 19,631 European eel transcripts would represent about 16,200 genes, with at best about 70% gene
coverage.
The transcriptome gene coverage was estimated by
comparison with the available sequence information for
A. anguilla. All 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes
previously described in European eel were present in the
assembled contigs. Moreover, regarding the 232 known
A. anguilla protein sequences, 113 (75%) out of the 150
different proteins (after eliminating redundancy) were
found in the transcriptome. These two estimations
might be inaccurate because of the limited numbers of
sequences used for comparison, mostly belonging to
highly and/or constitutively expressed genes. By contrast, only 5 out of the 8 glutathione peroxidase genes
known in zebrafish are found in the eel transcriptome.
While 12 genes of two small families of Iroquois
homeobox proteins are found in zebrafish, only 5 contigs/2 putative genes are represented in the eel transcripts. For ATPase genes, a large family in vertebrates
with over 125 genes in zebrafish, only 15 contigs/9 putative genes were present in the eel transcriptome.
However, coverage values in the European eel transcriptome might not be comparable to zebrafish, the
genome of which is characterized by high rates of gene
duplications [35], which might correspond to a considerable increase in gene family size in comparison with

Coppe et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:635
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/635

other species. A moderate to low gene coverage can also
be attributable to tissue/life stage-specific and/or weakly
expressed gene transcripts, which might be applicable to
our study in which the cDNA library was produced
using a single life-stage (glass eels).
(2) Transcriptome sequence quality was evaluated by
comparing the mitochondrial protein-coding genes
found in the assembled contigs with the mitochondrion
sequence in Genbank (NC_006531). A total of 18,554
nucleotide identities were observed out of 18,791 total
nucleotide length of contig to genome BLAST matches,
suggestive of good transcriptome sequence quality. The
observed 1% sequence difference might be due to either
intraspecific genetic variability and/or sequencing errors
affecting assembled mtDNA sequences.
(3) Finally, in terms of sequence completeness, the estimation of the fraction of full-length sequences in the
transcriptome was obtained. A sequence is considered
full-length when it comprises the complete 5’ and 3’
sequences of the mRNA. In this study, we used a less
stringent but broadly adopted definition, considering a
sequence as full length when it contains at least the complete coding sequence (CDS). Using the software FullLengther, 54% of predicted transcripts were validated as
full-length (10,169) or putative full-length (474).
Approximately 25% (2,575) presented at least a significant BLAST match (min. E-value = 1E-3) with nucleotide

Page 4 of 13

(nr) or protein (UniProt) sequences. The remaining 75%
(8,068) were not similar to any known sequence but their
longest ORF fitted the Full-lengther criteria (exceeds 66
nucleotides and contains both ATG and stop codons, or
the ATG is located at no more than 150 nucleotides
from the 5’ end of the transcript, without an in-frame
end codon). Among the 8,988 transcripts considered as
non full-length by the software, 2,348 (12% of the total)
showed BLAST matches. Thus, at least 66% of all contigs
(54% full-length plus 12% non-full-length but with
BLAST hits) could be successfully annotated by similarity
and/or contained a complete CDS.
Functional annotation by similarity

De novo annotation of the European eel transcriptome,
both for the coding and for the non-coding fraction of
transcripts, was obtained by a multistep procedure,
starting with similarity search against main protein and
nucleotide sequence databases, as detailed below.
BLASTX against protein sequence databases

Transcript sequences were compared by BLASTX
against nr database of peptide sequences, the most comprehensive and well annotated collection of proteins,
thus identifying significant similarity with known proteins for 5,530 transcripts (28.2%). In total, 98,799 nr
hits were identified, with an average of 18 hits per transcript. Figure 1 shows the European eel contigs vs nr

threshold indicated in the x-axis. Four groups of HSP- associated E-values are considered, corresponding to the best hits only and to all the hits,
both for the complete set of 5,530 contigs with protein BLAST hits and for the subset of 3,556 contigs with protein hits, which were
subsequently annotated, by association to GO terms.

protein database BLAST E-values analysis, in relation to
the annotated status of contigs. Eukaryotes accounted
for 98.5% of all BLAST hits, while teleost fish accounted
for 34.4% of hits (Table 2; Figure 2). Among fish, zebrafish Danio rerio and salmon Salmo salar represented
about 50% of all the hits, with 10,540 and 6,991 hits,
respectively.
Considering alignment coverage between query and
subject sequences, aligned regions covered on average
45.1% of contigs length: 75% of contigs were aligned
with subject sequences for more than 24.6% of their
length, and 25% for more than 63.5% of their length.
Aligned regions covered on average 35.1% of subject
sequence (known proteins) length, whereas three quarters of aligned regions covered over 55.1% of subject
sequence length. The majority of contig/transcript
sequences (14,316) were not associated to nr BLAST
hits. Comparison of sequence length, quality and GC
content of the set of sequences with and without nr
BLAST hits showed highly significant differences (Table
3): annotated sequences were longer and of higher quality than non-annotated sequences, and GC content of
the two sets was on average about 8 percent points
higher in annotated sequences.
In parallel, BLASTX search with the SwissProt set of
UniProt protein sequences identified significant similarity with known proteins for 4,023 transcripts (20.5%)
with a total of 62,630 hits, with 16 hits per transcript on
average. Only 29 contigs, not previously annotated by
similarity using nr database, were included in the set of
4,023 contigs with SwissProt BLAST hits. Merging the
results of the two BLAST searches, 5,559 transcripts
(28.3%) resulted to be similar to at least one known protein sequence in UniProt or nr database, with adopted
settings.
BLAST against nucleotide sequence databases

Transcript sequences were also compared by BLASTN
against nt database of nucleotide sequences, identifying
significant similarity for 5,495 transcripts (28%). In total,
70,530 nt hits were identified, with an average number
of 13 hits per transcript. A group of 1,433 contigs without hits after BLASTX searches resulted to be similar to
nt sequences.

In summary, a total of 6,963 contigs with at least one
hit after all the BLAST searches were identified, which
represent 36% of the transcriptome.
Functional annotation

BLASTX with nr database was chosen as most informative and used as starting point for the functional annotation analysis conducted with the Blast2GO suite. Among
contigs with nr BLASTX hits, 3,556 (64%) were associated to one or more 3,276 unique GO terms, for a
total of 122,193 term occurrences. After merging GO
annotations to eliminate redundancy, 18.1% of contigs
resulted to be associated to GO terms. The number of
GO terms per annotated contig is reported in Figure
3A. In order to give a broad overview of the ontology
content, GO classes were grouped into GO-slim terms,
which are cut-down versions of the GO ontologies containing a subset of the terms in the whole GO. Using
the web tool CateGOrizer, GO classes were grouped
into a total of 124 GO-Slim terms (Figure 3B, Additional File 4), which included biological process (53%),
molecular function (25%) and cellular component (22%)
ontologies. Among biological processes, cellular, regulatory and development processes represented 95% of the
total, while other key processes like growth or reproduction were also present. Binding represented about 70%
of the molecular function terms.
Sequence and annotation information included in
EeelBase might be valuable for the study of European
eel biology under changing environmental conditions.
Different groups of European eel transcripts that putatively encode proteins critical for environmental stress
response are found in the database. Several transcripts
encoding proteins putatively involved in environmental
adaptation were found in the database. A total of 11 different heat shock proteins were identified (Additional
File 5), a class of functionally related proteins whose
expression is increased when exposed to stress, many
functioning as molecular chaperones with a critical role
in protein binding and folding. Regarding oxidative
stress response, 12 contigs encoding at least 5 different
forms of glutathione peroxidase were identified, key
enzymes involved in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide
but also associated with SH3-domain binding, endopeptidase inhibition and anti-apoptotic activity through caspase regulation. Three contigs were annotated as
encoding at least two superoxide dismutase proteins, a
class of enzymes with a role in superoxide catalysis.
Finally, 22 contigs represented MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) genes, which play an important role
in the immune system. Direct keyword search by GO
terms, implemented in the database, allows to efficiently
retrieve the relevant information.
As a last step, the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) pathway approach for higher order

functional annotation was implemented using the tool
DAVID. Using zebrafish as reference genome, a total of
2,076 zebrafish genes homologous to European eel transcripts were mapped to KEGG pathways. Three of them
are significantly enriched: ribosome (37 genes, FDR 2.7E9), oxidative phosphorylation (34 genes, FDR 2.4E-4) and
proteasome (15 genes, FDR 2.1E-1) (Additional File 6).
Comparison with zebrafish and three-spine stickleback
genomes

European eel transcripts were aligned with the complete
zebrafish genome using BLAT, in order to reconstruct
the exon-intron structure of European eel genes, which
might be useful for primer and probes design in future
experimental studies. For each transcript, the pairwise
alignment with the best-matching zebrafish genome

region was retrieved and analysed. In total, BLAT
detected similarities with a genomic region for 18,990
contigs, although a fraction of alignments included
small regions and/or low percentages of sequence identity. Using alignments between transcript and genomic
of at least 100 nucleotides and 70% sequence identity as
criteria, 3,245 transcripts (17.1%) were related bona fide
to the corresponding orthologous region in the zebrafish
genome. Considering the ratio between matching region
and transcript length, 77.8% of transcripts with significant genome match aligned with zebrafish for at least
50% of the sequence length, while 35.7% aligned with at
least 75% of the sequence length. Similarly, eel transcripts were aligned with the available genome of the
three-spine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. Applying
the same criteria used for zebrafish genome matches,

only 1,062 European eel contigs, corresponding to 5.4%
of the total, aligned with the stickleback genome. Of
these, 4% aligned for at least 50% of the sequence length
and 0.2% for at least 75% of the sequence length,
whereas 671 (63%) aligned also with zebrafish genome.
According to phylogenetic data, Anguilliformes are a
basal branch in the teleost evolution that diverged

before the separation of other teleost lineages, including
Cyproniformes (zebrafish) and Gasterosteiformes (stickleback). Thus, discrepancies in genome matches across
species could be explained by differences in genome
structure rather than by differential sequence divergence. The higher number of matches in zebrafish may
be consequence of the highly duplicated nature of the

Coppe et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:635
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/635

zebrafish genome [35]. Indeed, genome size is three
times larger in zebrafish (1.7 Gb) than in stickleback
(0.6 Gb), according to [35]. Moreover, while the zebrafish genome is fully sequenced, the stickleback genome
is under completion with only 0.45 Gb available so far
(Ensembl assembly BROAD S1).
Transcriptome redundancy

Transcriptome redundancy is expected in assembled
contigs due to the heuristic nature of the assembly process and the settings used to avoid assembly of slightly
different sequences. Different kinds of redundancy can
be considered. Transcript-level redundancy is observed
if different contigs belong to the same transcript. This
may result from lack of conditions for merging read
sequences for a same transcript in a unique contig, due
to no sequence overlap or to sequencing errors. Genelevel redundancy is observed when different contig
sequences belong to the same gene or transcriptional
region. This may partially be explained by the pervasive
existence of alternative transcripts. Recently, Lu et al.
[35] suggested an inverse relation between genome size
and alternative splicing frequency in teleost fish. While
the lowest value of alternatively splicing was found in
the highly duplicated zebrafish genome, the highest
value was found in the compact genome of pufferfish.
Assuming 30% alternative splicing that is intermediate
among the values found in [35] and an approximate
value of 1.7 events per gene, about 42% of transcripts
are expected to belong to alternatively spliced genes in
the European eel. Considering the fraction of annotated
contigs, 5,314 contigs are associated to 3,202 unique
descriptions, 2,281 of which are represented by a single
contig. Thus 43% (2281/5314) of contigs might be transcripts of different genes, whereas the remaining fraction
of contigs may be redundant at gene level (3.3 contigs
per description, on average). Considering that different
descriptions may correspond to different genes, the fraction of descriptions represented by at least two contigs
(29%, 921/3202) is very close to the assumed 30% of
alternatively spliced genes. On the other hand, the number of contigs per description exceeds the expected
number of transcripts per alternatively spliced gene (3.3
and 1.7, respectively) with an excess only partially
explained by the fact that some of the largest groups of
contigs are associated to quite general descriptions (e.g.
“novel protein”, “histone” or “member ras oncogene
family”). Thus, the description redundancy in European
eel contig annotation may be largely, but not completely, explained by alternative splicing rates in fishes.
As an example, contig eu_c381 (2109 nucleotides long,
average quality 66) is annotated as PSA2 (proteasome
subunit alpha type-2), as it matches different proteins
of the InterPro family IPR000426 (Proteasome,

Page 8 of 13

alpha-subunit, conserved site). The contig sequence
corresponds to a putative full-length transcript with best
match in translated nr to a putative ortholog of zebrafish (NP_001122146), a 234 aa proteasome subunit,
whose CDS is completely included in the European eel
transcriptome. The alignment of the same contig with
the zebrafish genome highlights the existence of detectable sequence similarity also outside the CDS, since the
contig aligns with a 4,930 nucleotides genomic region of
chromosome 19, with a total of 1,448 nucleotides
aligned with 87% sequence identity. Looking at the contig annotation, there are two additional (shorter) contigs
in the transcriptome, which are annotated as PSA2:
eu_c1147 and eu_c27369. These sequences match partially overlapping protein hits groups with eu_c381, and
match the same zebrafish genome region. However, they
include different combinations of sequence fragments
and likely correspond to alternative transcripts. Thus,
these three transcripts belonging to a putative PSA2
European eel gene are correctly included in separated
contigs.
Identification of putative microRNAs

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs playing
important roles in the regulation of gene expression in
biological processes including cell differentiation, organogenesis and development [33]. In order to identify
putative novel microRNAs belonging to evolutionary
conserved families, the European eel transcriptome was
compared with known metazoan microRNA hairpin
sequences. A total of 54 significant local alignments
between contigs and hairpin sequences were identified,
involving 54 different hairpins. For each hairpin
sequence, we also considered the absolute positions of
the known major and/or minor mature sequences in the
hairpin, given by the miRBase database, in order to discriminate between contig/hairpin matches involving a
more or less extended region of a hairpin from those
overlapping a mature miRNA sequence. Table 4 reports
a total of 35 contigs matching both hairpins and mature
miRNAs sequences known in different species.
EeelBase: the European eel transcriptome database

A database, freely available online at http://compgen.bio.
unipd.it/eeelbase/, has been implemented using MySQL
and Django web framework. The database is filled with
different layers of information regarding the European
eel transcriptome sequences and analysis results. For
each contig, a gene-like entry (Figure 4) reports different
data and bioinformatic analyses results, according to the
schema detailed below:
• Contig information. For each contig (identified by
EeelBase ID and preliminary description), the FASTA
sequence is provided along with an informative contig

Next generation sequencing has opened the door to
genomic analysis of non-model organisms. The growing
number of species for which significant genetic
resources are available is sparking a new era of study in
which fundamental genetic questions underlying phenotypic evolution, adaptation and speciation can be
addressed with rigor. The European eel transcriptome,
the first obtained by high throughput 454 sequencing
for a critically endangered species, has been produced,
annotated and made freely available through a dedicated
and searchable database. With over 19,000 contigs, 36%
of which annotated by similarity to known protein or
nucleotide sequences and about 18.5% aligned to the
zebrafish or three-spine stickleback genomes, and 35
contigs matching miRNAs sequences known in different
metazoan species, this new resource represents a significant advance in anguillid genomics. Considering the

adaptation, effects of and possible adaptive evolutionary
responses to pollutants and other types of environmental
stress, improvement of aquaculture, and the discovery of
novel genes coding for important life-history traits.
Current demand for eels cannot be met by fisheries
and relies on aquaculture instead [1]. The most promising application of genomics in the European eel is aquaculture, which currently satisfies the big market demand
for eels that fisheries are no longer meeting. Using a
proteomic approach, key genes for growth and survival
in aquaculture stocks can be identified. In this sense,
our annotation revealed several genes with a potential
role in growth including growth hormone (GH), insulinlike growth factor (IGF) and transforming growth factor
(TGF), primary candidates for genetic factors affecting
growth. Our annotation also showed proteins related to
stress, which could also be important in aquaculture as
the reduction of stress might lead to a higher growth
and reproductive output.

Methods
Biological samples

Recruiting glass eel (juvenile) samples were collected in
early 2007 at three separate geographic locations across
Europe, one in the Atlantic Ocean: (1) the estuary of the
river Vilaine (47°29’N; 2°28’W) in Brittany/North-West
France; and two in the Tyrrhenian Sea/Mediterranean
Sea: (2) the estuary of the river Tiber (41°46’N; 12°14’E);
and (3) the estuary of the river Sele (40°48’N; 14°93’E).
Individuals were sacrificed immediately after collection
from the field following internationally recognized
guidelines. Samples were stored in RNALater (Ambion)
at -20°C prior extraction. No analyses or experiments
were conducted with live animals.

30 mg) was used. After checking the integrity and size
distribution of total RNA, RNA samples were pooled
and stored in pure ethanol for shipment to the Max
Planck Institute (Berlin, Germany). One single cDNA
library was constructed using equal amounts of RNA
and normalized for later sequencing. The SMART
(Switching Mechanism At 5’ end of RNA Template) kit
from BD Biosciences Clontech was used to construct
the cDNA libraries, which were later normalised using
the duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) method [36].
Sequencing

Approximately 15 μg of normalized cDNA were used
for sequencing library construction at the Max Planck
Institute, following described procedures [6]. Sequencing
was performed using GS FLX Titanium series reagents
and utilizing one single region on a Genome Sequencer
FLX instrument. Bases were called with 454 software by
processing the pyroluminescence intensity for each
bead-containing well in each nucleotide incorporation
and reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequences.
Assembly

Sequence reads were assembled into contigs by using the
MIRA 3 assembler [37], which uses iterative multipass
strategies centered on high-confidence regions within
sequences and uses low-confidence regions when needed,
with special functions to assemble high numbers of highly
similar sequences without prior masking. Two runs of
assembly were conducted by MIRA 3 in “EST” and “accurate” usage mode, respectively. Settings adopted for the
first run (de novo assembly) of ESTs were those defined by
the 454 sequencing technology. [mira -project = eu1 -job
= denovo,est,accurate,454 -notraceinfo]. The second run
was conducted on previously obtained contigs, which were
used as input for MIRA 3 as Sanger sequences. [mira -project = eu2 -job = denovo,est,accurate]. The complete set of
available reads was realigned to contigs using the mapping
assembly method provided by the Roche GS Reference
Mapper, specifically designed for consensus alignment of
reads against a given reference sequence.
Putative full-length transcripts identification

The software Full-Lengther [38] was used to obtain a
first validation of the assembly, integrating the results of
BLAST against UniProt and nr with those of ORF prediction, in order to calculate the fraction of transcripts,
i.e. assembled contigs, which can be considered bona
fide full-length.

RNA extraction and cDNA library construction

Total RNA was extracted from a total of 18 individuals
(6 per sampling location) using the RNeasy mini-column
kit (QIAGEN). To avoid overrepresentation of muscle
specific genes only the cephalic region (approximately

BLAST against sequences databases and functional
annotation

De novo functional annotation of the European eel transcriptome was obtained by similarity using BLAST,

Coppe et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:635
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/635

Blast2GO and custom made scripts. Batch BLAST similarity searches for the entire transcriptome were locally
conducted against (1) nr peptide database (release of
October 4 2009, including all non-redundant GenBank
CDS translations + PDB + SwissProt + PIR+PRF); (2)
the SwissProt part of the UniProt database; (3) nt database. BLASTX and BLASTN searches were carried out
using default parameters. Alignments with an E-value <
1E-3 were considered significant.
The Blast2GO suite [39] was used for functional annotation of transcripts applying the function for the mapping of GO terms to transcripts with BLAST hits
obtained from BLAST searches against nr. Only ontologies obtained from hits with E-value < 1E-6, annotation
cut-off > 55, and a GO weight > 5 were used for annotation. The web tool CateGOrizer [40] was used for
grouping and counting GO classes using the GO-Slim
method [41]. Additionally, the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, [42]) database, a knowledge
base for systematic analysis of gene functions linking
genomic and higher order functional information, was
implemented for further functional annotation using the
tool DAVID [43].
BLAT against zebrafish and three-spine stickleback
genomes

European eel transcripts were aligned with the complete
genomes of zebrafish Danio renio and three-spine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus using the BLAT search
tool in the UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz)
Genome Browser. For all transcripts, the pairwise alignment with the best matching genome region was
retrieved and recorded for statistical analysis.
MicroRNA discovery

After transcription, primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are
cleaved by the microprocessor complex to generate
precursors sequences with hairpin structure. These premiRNAs are exported from the nucleus and subsequently cleaved by Dicer to generate a miRNA-miRNA*
duplex with an average length of 21 nucleotides. Finally,
one of the two mature miRNAs is integrated into the
miRISC (microRNA induce silencing) complex. By
imperfect base pairing with the 3’ untranslated region
(3’-UTR) of their target mRNAs, mature miRNAs can
cause target silencing mainly by translation inhibition or
mRNA cleavage.
The complete set of microRNA hairpin sequences was
downloaded from miRBase database release 14 [44], a
searchable database of published miRNA sequences. The
10,867 sequences belonging to Metazoan species were
compared to European eel contigs by BLAST similarity
search, using the same thresholds and settings adopted
before.
