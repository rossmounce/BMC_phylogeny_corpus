Abstract
Background: Multi-character empirical studies are important contributions to our understanding
of the process of speciation. The relatively conserved morphology of, and importance of the mate
recognition system in anurans, combined with phylogenetic tools, provide an opportunity to
address predictions about the relative role of each in the process of speciation. We examine the
relationship among patterns of variation in morphology, call characters, and 16S gene sequences
across seven populations of a neotropical hylid frog, Hyla leucophyllata, to infer their relative
importance in predicting the early stages of population differentiation.
Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrate that both morphological and call characteristics were
significantly variable among populations, characterized by significantly lower intra-population
dispersion in call space than morphological space, and significantly greater among-population
variation in call structure. We found lack of concordance between a 16S DNA phylogeny of Hyla
leucophyllata and the significant population-level differentiation evident in both external morphology
and male advertisement call. Comparisons of the reconstructed gene trees to simulated lineages
support the notion that variation in call cannot be simply explained by population history.
Conclusion: Discordance among traits may reflect sampling biases (e.g. single genetic marker
effects), or imply a decoupling of evolution of different suites of characters. Diagnostic differences
among populations in call structure possibly reflect local selection pressures presented by different
heterospecific calling assemblages and may serve as a precursor of species-wide differentiation.
Differentiation among populations in morphology may be due to ecophenotypic variation or to
diversifying selection on body size directly, or on frequency attributes of calls (mediated by female
choice) that show a strong relationship to body size.

Background
The process of geographic speciation may be represented
as the shift from panmixia, through polyphyly and para-

phyly, to reciprocal monophyly of newly emerged sister
species [1]. From this vantage, understanding speciation
requires the study of historical and geographical factors

pling for geographic surveys. Finally frogs have a wellstudied mate recognition system (hereafter – MRS), with
a well-understood neuroethological basis and variation
that is readily quantified and manipulated to test for its
significance [4].

that may underlie origins and diversification of lineages
within species (e.g. isolation by distance, vicariance), and
also the changes that occur in suites of characters that can
affect survivorship or are important in reproductive isolation (e.g. morphology, mate recognition system). Multicharacter phylogeographic perspectives are particularly
fruitful in this regard, where the evolutionary history
inferred from DNA sequence data provides a baseline for
evaluating the divergence of various phenotypic
attributes. In other words, evolutionarily independent,
reciprocally-monophyletic lineages in similar environments can theoretically diverge in heritable phenotypic
attributes due to genetic drift, with greater divergence predicted for more deeply diverged lineages simply because
they have been separated for longer periods of time. Deviation from such expectation implies the action of selection or constraint, indicating that on some level the
evolution of phenotype is decoupled from history.
Anurans (frogs) provide excellent systems for multi-character phylogeographic approaches. They are typically less
vagile than other vertebrates (e.g. mammals and birds),
presumably promoting the development of differentiation among populations and regions. Indeed, many tropical and temperate amphibian species exhibit striking
phylogeographic structure and deep genetic divisions [e.g.
[2,3], implying that significant spans of time have elapsed
over which phenotypic differences could evolve. Many
frog species breed in aggregations facilitating point sam-

MRS was historically viewed as preventing fitness costs
associated with inter-specific mating [5]. Frogs and their
male-delivered advertisement calls have featured prominently in research illustrating such classical notions of
MRS evolution (e.g. [6-8]. Other explanations for MRS
evolution recently have gained greater acceptance focusing on (i) a role for sexual selection, especially through
female preference for certain male traits [reviewed in [9]],
or (ii) on direct selection on the MRS through predation,
competition, and environmental effects (e.g. selection for
signal transmission in different media) [10]. These
hypotheses share the prediction that MRS evolution may
precede the evolution of other hallmarks or correlates of
species status (including morphological distinctiveness)
and may even initiate speciation [11].
In this study we examined patterns of variation in morphology, phylogeny, and male advertisement call across
"populations" of a widely distributed neotropical frog,
Hyla leucophyllata [12]. Morphology tends to be conserved
in frogs both within and among species (e.g. [13,14]), and
it is distinction in the MRS that is the hallmark of speciation [4,15]. For this reason alone we might predict that the
latter will exhibit greater differentiation among populations. However, we can embed predictions of among population divergence within a more formal theoretical
framework. For example, in contrast to morphology, the
MRS in frogs may be under intense stabilizing selection
because of the fitness costs of inappropriate mate choice
[e.g. [16]]. Thus, we might expect there to be little range
wide variation in call at least in those characters important
in female choice. Alternatively, differences in call characteristics among populations may mirror phylogeny if drift
alone results in divergence. Further, call characteristics
may not map onto phylogeny because the former diverges
before differences in neutral characters accrue. In the
present study we test: (i) if there are significant differences
in call and morphology among seven populations of H.
leucophyllata, (ii) if differentiation between populations in
these two suites of traits are significantly correlated, and
how each relates to spatial separation between populations (a potential predictor of both gene flow and degree
of environmental similarity), and (iii) if divergence in
phenotype, and particularly MRS, shows a significant relationship with genealogical history.

Results
Variation
We obtained between 490 and 503 base pairs for all 65
surveyed H. leucophyllata (see Figure 1 for locations), three
H. triangulum, and two outgroup H. elegans. The 24 distinct ingroup haplotypes differed at between 1 and 46
sites (sequence divergence between 0.2 and 8.8 %, respectively), with an average ti/tv ratio, excluding comparisons
with an undefined quotient, of 2.73. Average base composition was as follows: 25.3% A, 20.9% C, 24.4% G, and
29.3% T.

Coefficients of variation for morphology variables among
populations (Additional file 2) ranged from 5.4 % (snout
length) to 11.1 % (hand disc diameter). The first two axes
of the CVA accounted for 77% (CV I = 56.7%, CV II =
20.3%) of the total morphological variance. All variables
loaded positively on CV I (Additional file 3), but were not
equal in magnitude suggesting that these axes represented
some element of both size and shape [17]. Loadings on
CV II were almost all negative, and here again magnitudes
were variable suggesting some shape dimension in addition to size.
Coefficients of variation varied more widely for call variables than those for morphology varying from 2.2% (secondary pulse duty cycle) to 143% (secondary note FM
sweep) (Additional file 4). Five characters varied significantly with body size (Table 3). The CVA of call variables
accounted for 77% of among-population variance over
the first two axes (CV I = 53.7%, CV = II 23.2%) (Additional file 5). A few temporally-based variables showed
the heaviest loadings on CVA axes; generally, shorter primary notes with fewer pulses corresponded to greater
pulse rates and number of secondary notes.
Population distinction in morphology and advertisement
call
All morphological variables differed significantly among
populations, as indicated by highly significant KruskalWallis tests (Additional file 2). However, separation
among populations in the space defined by the first two

CV axes was low relative to within-population scatter (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, post-hoc classification by the overall
CV function was quite accurate (94.7%; Table 4) indicating diagnostic morphological variation among populations.
After sequential Bonferroni adjustment, only 10 of the 30
call variables showed significant inter-population variation as judged by Kruskal-Wallis tests (Additional file 4).
Of these 10 variables, five represented the heaviest loading factors on CV I. Separation along CV I and II was much
more obvious in call than in morphological space (Figure
2B), a fact reflected by the increase in post-hoc classification success (100%) by the CV call function (data not
shown). The increased discriminatory power of the call
CV function is likely due to comparatively low intra-population dispersion in call space. A difference in intra-population dispersion is reflected in two explicit
comparisons. First, when call and morphology CV matrices are scaled equivalently, median intra-population dispersion in call space (diagonal matrix elements) is indeed
significantly lower than that for morphological space
(Mann-Whitney 2 Sample, Zapprox. = -3.066, n1 = 7, n2 = 7,
p = 0.0022). Second, there is a difference in the coefficients of variation: the ten significantly different call variables had a higher average among-population coefficient
of variation (28.3 ± 16.2 %) than morphological variables
(8.6 ± 1.6 %); a difference that is highly significant
(Mann-Whitney 2 Sample, Zapprox. = 4.24, n1 = 10, n2 = 17,
p < 0.0001).
Comparison of morphology, call and geographic distance
Apportioning out the known affects of body size (SVL) on
some call parameters (Table 3) in our call CVA, we found
no relation between level of inter-population differentiation in call and morphology (Table 5). This was true using
both ranked and unranked matrices. Distinctiveness in
morphology between populations estimated from a CVA
showed no relation to geographic distance; however, differentiation in advertisement call structure did show a
clear and significant relationship (Table 5).

Phylogenetics
Topologies of trees from our maximum likelihood and
Bayesian analyses were identical in almost all aspects and
we present only the former in Figure 3. Both approaches
showed three major well supported clades with > 90%
bootstrap support (maximum likelihood) and posterior
probabilities of 1.00 (Bayesian). One clade was com-

prised of three haplotypes found exclusively in H. triangulum (Clade 2 – Figure 3), while the other two contained
only Hyla leucophyllata haplotypes. Clade 1 is distributed
across the entire sampled range of H. leucophyllata with
some well-supported phylogenetic structure within. Clade
3 is comprised of only four H. leucophyllata haplotypes
from two sites (SdN and Man – see Figures 1 and 3). Two

was significantly greater for the reconstructed gene tree
than the gene trees simulated under the model of population fragmentation from a single ancestral population,
over a number of effective population sizes (Figure 5A).
This suggests that either ancestral populations were very
large and that in part, incomplete lineage sorting precludes us from inferring population history from 16S
mtDNA sequences. Alternatively, historical fragmentation
with subsequent secondary contact could also explain
some or all of the genetic pattern observed.

Relation of morphology and call to genealogical patterns
A simple, visual comparison of the patterns of differentiation in morphology and advertisement call (from our CV
analyses) to phylogeny suggest no obvious relationship
between our two measures of phenotypic distinction and
genealogical history. For instance, locales Man and Tab
appear little differentiated in call space (Figure 2B), yet all
seven individuals sampled from Tab have haplotypes
embedded within Clade 1 (haplotypes S, T, U, V), whereas
all 10 individuals from Man have haplotypes within
Clade 3 (L, M). Although SdN haplotypes are dispersed
among divergent Clades 1 (haplotype C) and 3 (A, B)
individuals within this population do not exhibit any
greater dispersion in call space. Similar discord is evident
between morphology and phylogeny. For example, Auk
and Obd exhibit the greatest inter-centroid distances on
CV axis 1 in Figure 2A, yet haplotypes from both sites are
dispersed throughout Clade 1 with no evidence for compartmentalization. Lineages simulated under a population 'stepping stone' model designed to reflect population
similarity based on call parameters (Figure 4B) do not
reduce the disparity in discord between reconstructed
gene and population trees, which remain significantly
higher than expected under neutral coalescence.

Discussion
Variation and distinction among populations
Morphological
Hyla leucophyllata does not show sufficient morphological
variation to have provoked the naming of subspecies or
other taxonomic revision (see Methods). However, upon
close examination the species nonetheless demonstrates
diagnostic patterns of morphological variation across
populations. That significant variation has gone unremarked is perhaps not surprising when the CVA plot for
morphology (Figure 2A) is examined in detail. Despite a
statistically significant separation in this multivariate
space, and indeed on every univariate morphological
measure, most populations of H. leucophyllata grade into
one another in morphological space rather than showing
obvious gaps. Most of the variation among populations
was in size although there was also a shape component.

in most taxonomic descriptions of frogs [18,19]. Thus, in
that sense, the variation found here is significant. However, the evolutionary significance of this variation is
harder to judge. For example, although size and shape differences among populations might reflect evolutionary
divergence in form they could also be due to ontogeny. All
individuals were males and almost all were calling and
thus presumably sexually mature. However, frogs may
undergo some growth-related changes even at this stage
[18], so variation among populations might only reflect
age class differences and thus sampling bias [20]. Equally
problematic would be ecophenotypic variation that is not
heritable and thus not indicative of evolved differences
among populations. Both factors are hard to rule out
without direct experimentation when the taxa studied are
allopatric, the characters continuous, and the differences
subtle or relatively small.
Call
Variation in the advertisement calls of H. leucophyllata was
both greater and more distinctive than that in morphology. For significantly variable call characters, among-population coefficients of variation were on average more
than three times as large as those coefficients for morphoTable 5: Summary of pairwise Mantel's tests on interpopulational distance matrices. Matrices used in each test were

logical variables. In addition, within-population variation
was lower and populations were better separated from
one another in call space than in morphological space
(Figure 2B). However, inasmuch as calls here serve as an
indicator of the MRS, it is insufficient to show variation in
structure of calls; rather this variation must also have
some bearing on mate choice.
Significant variation among H. leucophyllata populations
was found in pulse rate and other temporal features like
call length. In addition, the difference among populations
in dominant frequency was significant if it was not
adjusted for body size. All of these features are known to
affect mate choice in other hylid frogs [4,21]. Moreover,
both pulse rate and dominant frequency are known to
function in mate discrimination in another leucophyllatagroup species, H. ebraccata [22]. The number of secondary
notes was also significantly different among populations
of H. leucophyllata and this character is thought important
to mate choice in H. ebraccata (J. Schwartz pers. comm.).
Although there are no direct tests of which characters
influence mate choice in H. leucophyllata, the tendencies of
frogs in general (and a close relationship with H. ebraccata, in particular) suggest that at least some of the above
characters play a role in mate choice in H. leucophyllata.
Significant geographical variation in the call of H. leucophyllata is consistent with other studies on frogs (e.g., [68,23-26]. However, most of these studies involve calls as
corroborating evidence for differences established first on
morphological or genetic grounds, or are an explicit
attempt to illustrate reproductive character displacement/
reinforcement between established species. Few studies
examine the potential for call evolution to initiate interpopulation divergence, although recent biogeographic
and experimental data have demonstrated that reinforcement may act to drive rapid pre-mating isolation in frogs
(Hoskins 27). Regardless, the data presented here for H.

leucophyllata emphasize the value of considering MRS evolution as a potential cause rather than effect of frog speciation, given that it appears to be under greater selection
pressure than either morphology or DNA sequence.
Phylogenetics
We found striking phylogenetic divisions within H. leucophyllata but with little obvious geographic structure. Previous phylogenetic and phylogeographic work on the 30
chromosome clade (including H. leucophylata and H. triangulum) suggested that neither population spatial proximity nor colour pattern polymorphism corresponds well
with mitochondrial phylogeny [28]. Expanded sampling
and character evaluation in this study confirms this conclusion. Previous studies of frogs have shown similarly
striking phylogenetic divisions within traditionally
regarded species. For example, allozymes and immunological techniques have tended to find pronounced

genetic divisions within frog species [e.g. [29-31]].
Sequence-based studies of intra-specific variation in frogs
also have typically found pronounced genetic divisions
within species [32-34]. Here, point estimates of clade
divergence times surpass those found in 16S in a temperate hylid [34].
Relation between character types
The presence of variation in morphology, advertisement
call, and DNA sequence permits questions about relationships among these suites of data. The null hypothesis is
that evolution in phylogenetic distinction, form, and
reproductive isolation should be at least rank correlated
during the speciation process; i.e. lineages that are evolutionarily independent will diverge through genetic drift
alone given sufficient time. However, we found no such
relationship between either morphology or call, and phylogeny. Even pronounced separation between two popu-

lations for one suite of characters was not necessarily
accompanied by separation for another. A variety of possibilities exist to explain departure from the null expectation of rank correlation. We examine some of these below.
Single Marker Effects
Despite our finding of strongly supported phylogenetic
divisions, this phylogeny is based only on variation of a
single marker, the 16S rDNA molecule. Thus, the lack of a
concordance between phylogeny and morphological or
call divergence found here might then simply reflect a failure to accurately recover historical affinities among populations. However, such correlations can also be absent in
studies of frog populations that use a large number of
nuclear markers such as allozyme studies [e.g. [31], but
see [25]], suggesting the phylogenetic estimate presented
here perhaps could accurately reflect the history of connectedness among these populations. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA is more likely than many single nuclear
sequence loci to reflect historical population affinities
given the former's smaller effective population size. Given
this possibility at least, it is reasonable to explore other
explanations for the absence of a correlation between phylogeny and measures of phenotypic distinctiveness.
Selection on morphology
Insofar as our 16S phylogeny is an accurate depiction of
population history, then major clades of H. leucophyllata
may have been separated from each other for up to several
million years [28]. If so, the lack of apparent correspondence between phylogeny and morphology would still not
be particularly surprising for frogs. A number of studies
have found pronounced genetic differences among frog
taxa that are not reflected in morphology [e.g. [29,31,35]].
What morphological differences there are among populations of H. leucophyllata could reflect ecophenotypic or
ontogenetic effects as noted above. By contrast, deviation
from a relation with phylogeny could indicate the action
of selection upon morphology and adaptation to local
environmental conditions as is suggested in some specieslevel comparisons [20,36]. Although a correlation of morphological with geographic distance might then be anticipated, the geographic separation among H. leucophyllata
populations is generally large and, so, even spatially proximate populations could experience substantially different environmental pressures.

Whether morphological differentiation is selected or not,
the fact remains that large divergences in DNA sequence
relate to seemingly trivial morphological effects in these
frogs. Indeed, species of the leucophyllata-group are separated on average by more than twice as much genetic distance as are clades of H. leucophyllata [28] yet, even at the
species group level, separation on morphological grounds
alone has been historically problematic [37]. Moreover, as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/23

noted above, available evidence suggests that these clades
show levels of sequence divergence greater than that typical between congeners in other groups like mammals and
birds [38]. Why frogs might exhibit conservative morphological evolutionary patterns is not clear. However studies
on another group of amphibians with a conserved morphology offers one explanation. Wake et al. [39] suggested
that in plethodontid salamanders, an unpredictable environment has selected for a generalized body type coupled
with facultative behavioural adjustment. Behavioural flexibility buffers the effect of environmental variation and
hence minimizes naturally-selected morphological
change over evolutionary time. On this view, genetic
changes continue to accrue within lineages but morphological evolution is retarded, leading to decoupling of
morphological and molecular evolution [40]. Hyla leucophyllata fits the profile described by Wake et al. [39] for a
species with an evolutionarily "persistent" morphology. It
seems to face and cope with considerable environmental
heterogeneity, occupying and breeding in a variety of habitats even within the same locale, from cattle ponds in
open fields to closed-canopy forest (Chek, pers. obs).
Hence, this hypothesis could explain why apparently deep
evolutionary splits in H. leucophyllata have not led to obvious and concordant changes in form.
Selection on body size or calls?
The pattern of call evolution provides some of the most
interesting points for consideration. Although call and
morphology distance matrices are uncorrelated (Table 5),
there is a relationship between some aspects of calls and
morphology (body size). A few of the 30 call characters
measured were correlated to snout-vent-length, but this
variation was removed before overall call distance was calculated. Adjustment for body size allowed examination of
call variation that is independent of the most obvious
influence of morphology. However, call variables correlated to body size are far from unimportant to a consideration of the process of call evolution in H. leucophyllata. Of
the call variables correlated to body size, the strongest
relationship was one with dominant frequency (r2 = 0.61;
Table 3): larger males had calls of lower frequency.
Females of several frog species are known to prefer larger
males as mates and independently to prefer lower dominant frequencies – tendencies true of H. ebraccata females
[22,41]. As with any correlation, it is difficult to determine
whether one factor is driving the other, or whether other
factors are causal. Interpopulation variation in body size
might be naturally selected, or indeed could be an ecophenotypic response. In both cases, differences in dominant
frequency and its reception by females simply would be
"dragged along" over time. However, an intriguing possibility is the reversal of this scenario: females could prefer
the signal itself with body size evolution a correlated
effect. Sexual selection theory provides several models by

which direct female preferences and associated male traits
could evolve [42]. A potentially generative role for frog
calls in morphological evolution is reflective of generally
increased research interest in the role of the MRS in initiating speciation, especially with respect to sexual selection
[9,11,27]. Moreover, it emphasizes once again the value
of investigating multiple character suites.
Covariation of calls with geography
As with morphology, there was no obvious relation
between phylogeny and distance among populations in
call (e.g. see Figure 4). Again, this may be due to a failure
of the single genetic marker to accurately reflect the history of gene flow among populations; a recent history of
gene flow could be obscured by lineage sorting effects. If
so, then further study using a suite of nuclear markers
could reveal a correlation of phylogeny with call distance;
a pattern consistent with classical views that see MRS evolution as a largely pleiotropic effect of divergence in other
aspects of the organism [5]. If call divergence among H.
leucophyllata populations is a result of undetected similarity across nuclear loci, then this may explain the only significant and strong correlation among matrices, that
between geography and calls. However, even a study that
found a correlation between call divergence and genetic
divergence also found a residual correlation of call distance with geographic distance [25], which suggests some
other factor that covaries with geographic distance.

One possibility is that locales in closer proximity are more
similar in vegetational composition than those that are
further apart. Among other effects of vegetation is the degradation of acoustic signals broadcast through it [43].
Frog calls with higher pulse rates are degraded more when
transmitted through vegetation than in open habitat formations [44], and there is some evidence that frog species
in open habitats have higher pulse rates than those in forest [45]. Thus, slower pulse rates of some H. leucophyllata
populations might be a selected response of denser vegetation at those locales. However, the lowest pulse rates
actually come from populations in swampy open areas
(RB, Tab). If current habitat is any guide to the long-term
selective milieu, then this suggests that geographic variation in vegetation density is not the cause of the observed
pattern of call variation among populations.
Another factor that could covary with geographic distance
between H. leucophyllata populations is the composition
of the sympatric frog assemblage. Distribution of frog species in the lowland forest of the Amazon Basin is far from
uniform [46]. Of the approximately 200 species found
there only about 10% are found throughout the Amazon,
with H. leucophyllata being one of these [46]. Thus, there
is geographic variation in the identity of species co-occurring with H. leucophyllata. For example, this species can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/23

sympatric with three other leucophyllata-group species in
the western Amazon, whereas, in the eastern Amazon, it
is, as far as is known, the only member of its group. If, all
else being equal, sites closer together are more similar in
species composition, then competition among species for
"acoustic space" could explain both call divergence
among sites and covariation with geographic distance.
Call divergence through acoustic competition could occur
either as a means of avoiding mis-mating (reproductive
character displacement sensu 47], or of avoiding destructive interference of sound waves, or both. Both mechanisms have been invoked to explain the distribution of
call features among species in frog assemblages [reviewed
in [48]]. Like its ecological counterpart, hypotheses of
acoustic partitioning posit that selection acts to carve out
an acoustic niche for the organism such that overlap with
neighbours in syntopic soundspace is minimized. Unfortunately, an inventory of the species at each site and
recordings of all of their calls is not available to test this
hypothesis for H. leucophyllata. Nonetheless, there is some
evidence for acoustic partitioning in frog assemblages of
which H. leucophyllata is a part [49].

Conclusion
Hyla leucophyllata exhibits strikingly deep phylogenetic
divisions, although the species as currently designated is
possibly paraphyletic with H. triangulum. Significant differentiation among populations in both external morphology and male advertisement call does not show any
obvious relationship to the 16S DNA genealogy implying
that, if the latter does mirror the evolutionary history of
the species, then in some sense evolution of these different characters is decoupled. A strong relation between call
structure and geographic distance may reflect differential
acoustic partitioning of H. leucphyllata populations within
different calling frog assemblages. Some call attributes
(notably dominant frequency) show a highly significant
relationship to body size raising the possibility that (i)
divergence in body size is either ecophenotypic or caused
by diversifying selection in different environments, and
has resulted in divergence in call frequency, or (ii) selection on call itself [27], mediated by female choice, has
produced divergence in body size.

Methods
Study species
Hyla leucophyllata is a small (20–35 mm) treefrog widely
distributed and common throughout the lowland forests
of the Amazon Basin [50] and associated habitat. Males
usually call above small water bodies from emergent vegetation and may be syntopic with a variety of other species
(Chek pers. obs.). Hyla leucophyllata is one of six species in
the leucophyllata-group [50]. Like many such frogs, species
group members are characterized by extreme morphological similarity. This leads to the possibility that H. leuco-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:23

phyllata is simply a morphotype. However, sympatry of
several species [51] with clearly distinct advertisement
calls suggests that these taxa are reproductively isolated.
Call differences among the species are generally paralleled
by large differences at mtDNA loci [28], also supporting
the assumption that these taxa are indeed species. Hyla
leucophyllata previously had not been suggested to comprise more than one species, by any criterion. However,
there is some suggestion that at least some lineages within
H. leucophyllata are implicated in a clade containing H. triangulum, and the species as currently designated may be
paraphyletic [28]. In addition, noticeable variation in
phenotype does occur within H. leucophyllata, but is confined to colour-pattern polymorphism. However, particular morphs are not restricted to given populations and
allozyme analysis has established that even extreme differences in colour-pattern are not related to species boundaries [52].
Collections, characters, and measurements
Over three rainy seasons (Nov. 1993 – Feb. 1994; Jan.
1995 – Apr. 1995; Feb. 1996 – Apr. 1996), we collected H.
leucophyllata (n = 99) from seven sites that span the majority of the species' range. For purposes of phylogeographic
analyses we added tissue samples for two additional sites
on the Rio Juruá in western Amazonas (see Additional file
1). Inter-site distances ranged from 35 to 1948 km. Figure
1 indicates localities sampled and Additional file 1 lists
the disposition of specimens, as well as the approximate
latitude and longitude where they were sampled. All individuals collected for this study were males, as judged by
calling activity (only males call) or the presence of testes
during tissue sampling. Once tissue had been sampled,
specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and then stored in
70% ethanol. Sample sizes varied for each character set
(Table 1, Additional file). Minimally, most individuals
that were measured for calls were also measured for morphology and most of these had associated sequences.
Morphology and call
Aspects of shape and size are among the most commonly
used descriptors in systematic diagnoses of frogs. Seventeen measurements from each individual were collected
following Lee and Crump [53] (see Additional file 2 for a
list of variables). Measurements were made on preserved
specimens to the nearest 0.1 mm using dial calipers.
Because colour-pattern is difficult to quantify and its analysis in these frogs may require several thousand individuals [37], colour-pattern was not included as a character.

Hyla leucophyllata produces a call composed of a pulsed
trill (primary note) that may be followed by one to six
shorter secondary notes of similar form (Chek, pers. obs.).
Calls were recorded in the field using a Sony WM-D3 Professional Walkman and Electro-Voice (model 635A)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/23

microphone. Temperature during recording was always
25–26°C, hence no significant effects of temperature on
call characters were expected. Five calls of each individual
were digitized at a sampling rate of (10 KHz) using
CANARY vers.1.2 (Cornell Bioacoustics). The same program was also used to produce waveforms and sonograms
for each call from which variables were measured using
built-in software tools. Variables comprised a mix of spectral and temporal properties of calls, including some that
are known to influence mate choice in other species (e.g.
pulse rate [21]). For each individual, the average of each
variable across its five measured calls was used in all analyses. Variable names and definitions are listed in Table 2;
Figure 5 shows a typical waveform and sonogram from
which call variables were measured.
Statistical analyses of morphology and call data
For morphological and call variables, means and variances were calculated for raw values of each variable.
However, subsequent analyses employed log-transformed
values. Because some aspects of frog calls are influenced
by body size (e.g. dominant frequency [51,54]), all call
variables were regressed against a measure of overall body
size (snout-vent-length; SVL). Where a significant relationship between a call variable and SVL was found, the
residuals of the regression were used in subsequent analyses. Wherever multiple tests were performed (e.g. all call
variables regressed on SVL) a sequential Bonferroni
adjustment [55] was made. Most analyses were performed
in JMP vers. 3.1.6 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and SYSTAT vers. 5.2.1 (Systat Inc., Evanston, Illinois), although some (e.g. Mantel's test) used RPACKAGE vers. 3.0 [55].
Amount and distinctiveness of character variation
Multiple characters were measured for calls and morphology to more fully capture the extent and direction of variation in trait space. We tested for differences among
populations for each character using a Kruskal-Wallace
test. We also used Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) to
examine differences among populations in call and morphology. A technique commonly used in studies of frog
morphological and call variation [e.g. [24,26,57]], CVA
yields axes that summarize trait variation and produces
corrected distances among groups. While the use of CVA
with small sample sizes is of some concern, we found that
the results were qualitatively similar to those produced by
Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a technique with
less stringent assumptions. PCA, however, is not recommended for an analysis of geographic variation [58]
because it does not allow for the a priori consideration of
groups (populations).

CVA yielded corrected (Mahalanobis) distances of each
individual from each population centroid, including the

Page 12 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:23

centroid of its own population. Individual distances from
each population to a given centroid were averaged to produce an inter-population distance. This procedure was
repeated for all pairs of populations to produce a matrix
of pairwise distances. The diagonal of the matrix represents the average distance of individuals from their own
population centroid. The ability of each CVA to discriminate diagnostic variation among populations was assessed
by its success at correctly classifying individuals to the
population from which they originally were drawn.
Relation of morphology, call and geography
Mantel's test was used to calculate correlations between all
distance matrices (call, morphological, a matrix of
straight-line geographical geographic distances between
sites) [59]. One thousand permutation replicates were
performed for each test. Distances within matrices were
first ranked because the principal question concerned
whether the relative magnitudes of variation were correlated. However, the use of unranked matrices did not
change any conclusions. Scales of measurement among
character sets were made comparable by dividing each distance matrix by its maximum value; thus, in rescaled
matrices the maximum value was one.
Phylogeny
For general details on tissue collection and amplification
and sequencing of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S
rRNA gene see [28] Chek et al. (2001). DNA sequence
data from the 16S rRNA gene were used to estimate the
genealogical history of sampled populations. Gaps were
treated as missing data for all analyses. Point estimates of
divergence among major clades was estimated following
the moment method [60], which corrects for the ancestral
portion of within-clade diversity (pnet = pAB - 0.5 [pA+pB]).).

Given the aforementioned possibility of paraphyly of H.
leucophyllata, we included sequence from both it and H.
triangulum. We approached inferring the genealogical relationships of H. leucophyllata using both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches. We included Hyla
elegans as an outgroup, as it lies unequivocally outside of
our leucophyllata/triangulum ingroup [28]. For ML, we used
MODELTEST vers. 3.06, [61] to select the best model of
evolution (GTR + I + G; with proportion of invariant sites
(I) = 0.371, γ shape parameter = 0.491). We conducted ML
using an exhaustive search and 'as-is' sequence addition,
and evaluated support for resulting topologies using 100
nonparametric bootstrap pseudoreplicates with PAUP*
vers. 4.10 [62]. We also ran two simultaneous Bayesian
analyses (MR.BAYES vers.3.1.1; [63], each beginning with
random starting trees, with Metropolis-coupled MCMC
using four incrementally heated Markov chains sampled
every 100 generations. We estimated stationarity of the
Markov chain by plotting the sampled log likelihood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/23

scores versus generation time. Analyses were run for 1.0 ×
106 generations until the average standard deviation of
split frequencies was less than 0.01. Potential scale reduction factors (PSRFs; see [64] for all estimated parameters
was close to 1.00 and estimated effective sample sizes
(using the program TRACER vers. 1.2.1 [65]) for all
parameters were all > 100, both suggesting that we had
adequately sampled the posterior distribution of trees.
Trees generated before the burn of 250000 generations
were discarded and we used the remaining trees to generate 50% majority rule consensus trees.
Coalescent simulations of molecular evolution
We conducted coalescent simulations of molecular evolution and applied a gene-tree/population-tree approach
[66] to estimate whether the 24 haplotypes in the reconstructed 16S gene tree was concordant with two population models representing 1) divergence from a single
ancestral population, and 2) population history as predicted by the significant correlation between call variables
and geographic distance (see results). All simulations and
measures of discordance were done in Mesquite version
1.05 [67]. Reconstructed haplotypes were contained
within populations under both population models listed
above. We used s [68] to measure the discord between the
gene tree and its subdivision into populations (treating
later as categorical variables), with s used to infer time
since divergence assuming no gene flow. For population
divergence from a single ancestral population we apply a
star model; appropriate because there we found no evidence of genetic isolation by distance. The second population model represents a stepping stone model reflecting
the strong relationship between population similarity in
call variables and geographic proximity of populations.
Specifically, a distance matrix based on the CVA of measured call parameters was used to construct a population
tree, which was then used to represent population history
that follows a stepping stone model of divergence.

Simulated gene-trees were created using the Genesis package of Mesquite vers. 1.05. For each simulation we created
500 gene trees for each of three temporal scenarios: Ne =
5000, 10,000, and 40,000, where Ne represents time since
populations splitting measured in generations [67]. Given
that small sample sizes make estimating theta from a single marker problematic, and the difficulty in obtaining
accurate mutation rate estimates for 16S in treefrogs, we
chose to simplify the model by assuming each historical
population had similar effective population sizes. Within
Mesquite, this is equivalent to holding the branch widths
of the population tree equal across populations (branch
widths equal 1). Parameters were modelled using empirically derived nucleotide frequencies, proportion of invariant characters, gamma shape parameter, and sixparameter rate matrix model (see above). A scaling factor

was selected through preliminary runs that provided pairwise sequence divergence rates similar to our observed
16S data (scaling factor = 2.0 × 10-6) [67]. The 500 simulated gene-trees for each generation time provided an
expected distribution of random coalescent gene-trees
from which to compare observed values of s under the two
population hypotheses.
