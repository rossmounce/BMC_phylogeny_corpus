Bioinformatic evidence for a widely distributed,
ribosomally produced electron carrier precursor,
its maturation proteins, and its nicotinoprotein
redox partners
Daniel H Haft

Abstract
Background: Enzymes in the radical SAM (rSAM) domain family serve in a wide variety of biological processes,
including RNA modification, enzyme activation, bacteriocin core peptide maturation, and cofactor biosynthesis.
Evolutionary pressures and relationships to other cellular constituents impose recognizable grammars on each class
of rSAM-containing system, shaping patterns in results obtained through various comparative genomics analyses.
Results: An uncharacterized gene cluster found in many Actinobacteria and sporadically in Firmicutes, Chloroflexi,
Deltaproteobacteria, and one Archaeal plasmid contains a PqqE-like rSAM protein family that includes Rv0693 from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Members occur clustered with a strikingly well-conserved small polypeptide we designate
“mycofactocin,” similar in size to bacteriocins and PqqA, precursor of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Partial
Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) based on the distribution of these markers identifies the mycofactocin cluster, but also a
second tier of high-scoring proteins. This tier, strikingly, is filled with up to thirty-one members per genome from three
variant subfamilies that occur, one each, in three unrelated classes of nicotinoproteins. The pattern suggests these
variant enzymes require not only NAD(P), but also the novel gene cluster. Further study was conducted using SIMBAL, a
PPP-like tool, to search these nicotinoproteins for subsequences best correlated across multiple genomes to the
presence of mycofactocin. For both the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) and iron-containing
dehydrogenase families, aligning SIMBAL’s top-scoring sequences to homologous solved crystal structures shows
signals centered over NAD(P)-binding sites rather than over substrate-binding or active site residues. Previous studies on
some of these proteins have revealed a non-exchangeable NAD cofactor, such that enzymatic activity in vitro requires
an artificial electron acceptor such as N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline (NDMA) for the enzyme to cycle.
Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that the mycofactocin precursor is modified by the Rv0693
family rSAM protein and other enzymes in its cluster. It becomes an electron carrier molecule that serves in vivo as
NDMA and other artificial electron acceptors do in vitro. Subclasses from three different nicotinoprotein families
show “only-if” relationships to mycofactocin because they require its presence. This framework suggests a
segregated redox pool in which mycofactocin mediates communication among enzymes with non-exchangeable
cofactors.

genomics and bioinformatics approaches [2,3]. While
systems suggested by conserved operons are readily
detected through comparative genomics resources such
as STRING [4] and IMG [5], developing meaningful
hypotheses for the functions of proteins lacking any
characterized homolog and for the discovery and
description of novel systems is non-trivial.

However, biological systems completely unrelated to
each other in the sense that no component of one
shows any homology to any component of the other
may resemble each other in their organizing principles.
In a nutrient utilization system, for example, the set of
catabolic enzymes will tend to be accompanied by a
transport operon for nutrient uptake. The two sets of
genes often will be co-clustered, as well as correlated in
their phylogenetic distributions. The system will tend
not to be essential, so that one strain may have the system while others lack it, yet distantly related species
inhabiting similar environments may share it. These and
other commonalities reflect underlying constraints on
the relationships among the different parts of a cell, a
biological grammar that is shared among analogous
systems even if they show no common ancestry and no
sequence similarities. Patterns learned from one nutrient
utilization system can be used to guide the study of
another.
In a bacteriocin system, a small peptide can undergo
multiple forms of processing, including leader peptide
removal and various forms of boutique modification
that differ from one system to another. The precursor
peptide usually but not always is encoded near its
maturases. Transporters in the system will be for export
(there will be no periplasmic substrate binding protein),
and a protease domain may be fused to a permease subunit. Because bacteriocins participate in an evolutionarily rapid arms race of changing toxins and changing
defenses, differences in systems even between closely
related strains may be profound. Study of the nitrile
hydratase-related leader peptide (NHLP) class and nif11
leader peptide (NIF) class of bacteriocin precursor
shows a mix-and-match pattern for associating different
maturase families interchangeably with target families
[6]. Not only can lantibiotic synthases and cyclodehydratases each work on unrelated homology families of precursor peptides, but the same precursor families
(conserved in a region that interacts with transporters
for cleavage and export) can pair with different, even
novel, families of maturases. The biological grammar of
bacteriocin systems provides not just a framework for
describing known systems, but guidance for the discovery of new systems unrelated to those already known.
Recognizing a biological grammar can help to characterize a system by directing follow-up bioinformatics
studies, follow-up experimental work, or both. A particularly important grammar describes cofactor biosynthesis. Biological grammars leave telltale signs through the
constraints they impose on evolutionary processes. If
the cofactor is uncommon and sporadically distributed,
as with coenzyme F420 [7] or pyrolloquinoline quinone
(PQQ), the vivid evidence for the grammar will show in
results from comparative genomics tools such as Partial

Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) [8]. PPP detects correlations between a phylogenetic profile (a listing of genomes) used as a query, and the optimally constructed
protein families that could be built around each of the
proteins in the genome being queried (see methods).
The top tier of results from PPP will consist mostly of
the enzymes actually involved in synthesizing the cofactor. In contrast to bacteriocin systems, these enzymes
should be consistent from genome to genome. But PPP
will also show a second tier enriched in protein families
tightly correlated to the presence of the cofactor, usually
because they are enzymes directly dependent on that
cofactor for their function. Recently, we demonstrated
surprising numbers of flavoenzymes, from three paralogous families, nominated by PPP as likely F420dependent, dozens per genome in Mycobacterium smegmatis and other Actinobacteria [7]. A new bioinformatics tool, SIMBAL [9] (see methods), confirmed that
it was determinants of cofactor specificity rather than
substrate specificity that scored highest. Taylor, et al.
[10] have now provided direct experimental confirmation for nine examples of F420-binding enzymes from
one of these families.
The present work focuses on Rv0693 and the distinctive subfamily to which it belongs within the radical
SAM domain family [11], and on a short peptide with
an extremely well conserved C-terminal motif that
invariably is encoded in the same gene cluster. Individual subfamilies of radical SAM proteins differ greatly
in target and action, and serve as molecular markers for
processes as varied as tRNA and rRNA base modification, metalloenzyme maturation, lipid metabolism, and
post-translational modification both of proteins to create
enzyme active sites, and of short peptides to create bacteriocins and other natural products. Among characterized radical SAM proteins, Rv0693 is most similar to
AlbA (Anti-Listerial Bacteriocin A) [12], and to PqqE
(Pyrrolo-Quinoline-Quinone biosynthesis E) [13],
involved respectively in the biosynthesis of subtilosin A
(a bacteriocin) and PQQ (an enzymatic cofactor). A Cx2-C-x5-C-x3-C motif, located C-terminally to the radical SAM domain and involved in binding an additional
4Fe4S cluster [14] is shared exactly by Rv0693 with
anaerobic sulfatase maturation proteins, a quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase maturation protein, and
the Pep1357-cyclizing radical SAM enzyme [15], and
shared approximately with AlbA and PqqE. All of these
proteins have in common that they perform chemistries
on protein or peptide substrates.
It is noteworthy that two profoundly different grammars can describe systems in which a radical SAM
enzyme modifies a short peptide. Subtilosin A is an
example of a bacteriocin made in this way, while PQQ
is an example of an uncommon enzymatic cofactor

made from a peptide precursor. The technique of
weighing evidence from a variety of comparative genomics approaches against expectations corresponding to
different biological grammars, rather than considering
homology alone, can provide an opportunity to learn
more about novel, uncharacterized systems in silico and
to provide more concrete and detailed hypotheses of
processes and functions.

A further examination of members of the radical SAM
domain superfamily [11,16] for member sequences not
already described by more specific HMMs in the TIGRFAMs collection [17] revealed a clade that included
Rv0693 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and its
apparent orthologs in numerous other Actinobacteria. A
preliminary protein family definition, based on an HMM
constructed from a multiple sequence alignment of this
putative ortholog set, marked a set of loci and created a
phylogenetic profile, from which conserved gene neighborhoods and phylogenetically correlated protein
families could be investigated. Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP), a data mining tool that searches for phylogenetically correlated proteins by tuning sets of working
definitions of families centered on those proteins for
optimal match to the query profile [8], revealed strong
matches to several neighboring proteins, including a glycosyltransferase (Rv0696) and a protein of unknown
function (Rv0692) with no homologs outside of these
neighborhoods. Among the 1450 genomes included in
the PPP data set, we determined that the three always
occur together, or not at all, both within and outside
the Actinobacteria. Non-actinobacterial species included
Thermomicrobium roseum and Sphaerobacter thermophilus from the Chloroflexi, Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum and Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans from the
Firmicutes, and Geobacter uraniireducens from the
Deltaproteobacteria. Manually refined protein family
definitions, with curated seed alignments, HMMs, and
curated cutoffs, were constructed and deposited in the
TIGRFAMs database [17]. Table 1 lists HMMs created
for this study.

Rv0693 belongs to a branch of the radical SAM family in
which known or presumed substrates are short peptides

We have compiled a comprehensive list of radical SAM
proteins characterized by direct assay, mutational
studies, or genome context. The two closest homologs
to Rv0693 in the collection AlbA, the lone maturase for
subtilosin A biosynthesis [12] and PqqE, part of a cassette of genes required for pyrroquinoline quinone
(PQQ) biosynthesis [13,18]. Rv0693 is much more

—

similar to these than to radical SAM proteins of tRNA
or rRNA base modification, hydrogenase metallocenter
maturation [19], biotin cofactor biosynthesis [20], squalene/hopene biosynthesis[21], sulfatase activation [22],
etc. TIGRFAMs model TIGR03963 now defines the
Rv0693 family. “PqqE” is the most common misannotation in public databases for members of this family.
An open reading frame encoding a short peptide with an
invariant C-terminus always occurs in the gene
neighborhoods defined by the families of Rv0693,
Rv0692, and Rv0696

Inspection of these conserved gene neighborhoods occasionally showed a gene prediction for a short peptide
sequence. Multiple alignment of all predicted examples
revealed length heterogeneity ranging from 34 to 78
residues, with extreme sequence diversity upstream of a
carboxyl-terminal 23-amino acid region of extremely
strong sequence conservation, suggesting that the
extended, unalignable N-terminal regions largely reflect
incorrect start site predictions. Searching six-frame
translations of genomes lacking a predicted member of
this family revealed that the predicted coding region is
universally present. Figure 1 shows a multiple sequence
alignment of this predicted protein family, now modeled
by TIGR03969. The last four residues, and seven of the
last eight, are invariant. Conservation appears to be
maintained at the level of protein, not DNA; the last
four codons all differ between the genes from Frankia
alni ACN14a and Thermomicrobium roseum DSM5159
while the corresponding amino acids are identical.
The small size (of the conserved region) of this polypeptide is highly suggestive. Such a small polypeptide is
unlikely to act as an enzyme or structural protein, but

Figure 1 Multiple sequence alignment of gene predictions for mycofactocin precursors. All detectable members of the family defined by
TIGR03969 were collected, sorted by length, and aligned by MUSCLE [33], and then made non-redundant to 80% sequence identity,
preferentially keeping sequences previously treated as genes and available through NCBI. Significant sequence similarity is restricted to the last
23 amino acids; the seven invariant residues occur among the last eight positions.

may instead be a substrate. PqqA, the polypeptide
precursor of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) [13],
averages 23 amino acids in length, identical to the
length of the conserved portion of the alignment in
Figure 1, represented in model TIGR03969. Many bacteriocin core peptides are also similar in size, once the
leader peptide is removed. Both PqqA and bacteriocins
such as subtilosin A are acted upon by radical SAM
proteins as part of their peptide maturation [12,18]; the
AlbA enzyme introduces three separate linkages from
Cys residues main chain atoms of residues elsewhere in
the polypeptide chain [12].
A reasonable hypothesis is that the Rv0693 family radical SAM protein modifies the TIGR03969 family peptide
to produce a bioactive molecule: a bacteriocin, a redox
cofactor like PQQ, or a signaling metabolite such as
Pep1357 [15]. The neighboring glycosyltransferase
(Rv0696) likely also participates. Based on its nearuniversal distribution in the genus Mycobacterium
(among many other Actinobacteria), and analogy of its
biosynthesis cluster to PQQ cofactor and bacteriocin
biosynthesis clusters, we suggest the working name
“mycofactocin“ for members of this family.
The nitrile hydratase/nif11 families expand collections of
peptide-modifying radical SAM proteins

Lantibiotic synthases [23] and cyclodehydratases [24]
serve as high fidelity markers for bacteriocin maturation
clusters, but may be accompanied by additional dehydrogenases, proteases, radical SAM proteins, and other
enzymes best recognized as part of the maturation cluster by context. Recently, we showed a mix-and-match
relationship between families of precursors and families
of maturation enzyme; the nitrile hydratase-related
leader peptide (NHLP) and Nif11-related leader peptide

(Nif11LP) can associate with a single type of export
transporter but with multiple types of modification cluster [6]. Given that AlbA provides an example of a radical SAM enzyme serving as the sole maturase for a
bacteriocin, we searched for examples of NHLP and
Nif11LP family peptides associated with a radical SAM
protein as its only candidate maturase. We found several
sets of mutually closely related enzymes, including
family TIGR04064 (YP_001959118.1, YP_516403.1,
YP_002019717.1, etc.), which provide additional examples proteins that are presumed to act on small peptides
as substrates, and which possess the C-terminal 4Fe4Sbinding motif C-x2-C-x5-C-x3-C that correlates with
protein or peptide modification as suggested by Benjdia,
et al. [14]. These new observations provide additional
support that Rv0693 likely targets a small peptide for
modification.
Additional protein families co-cluster with the
mycofactocin precursor

The last marker universally found in all mycofactocin
gene neighborhoods is the family of Rv0692, now
described by TIGR03967. This small protein (about 90
amino acids in size) lacks detectable homology to any
protein outside of mycofactocin gene neighborhoods. It
might be an enzyme, or subunit thereof, for mycofactocin maturation, but the small size and lack of homology
to any known enzyme suggest otherwise. Alternatively,
it may be a “scaffolding” protein important during
mycofactocin biosynthesis but not after, or a carrier
protein, analogous to apocytochrome c, that binds the
mature product and mediates its interactions with other
proteins. The latter interpretation fits well with the
working hypothesis that the mycofactocin system defines
a novel redox pool with limited communication with

Haft BMC Genomics 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/21

other redox pools such as those of exchangeable NAD
or NADP.
Three additional protein families occur, in single
copies per genome and co-clustered, in most but not in
all species with the mycofactocin gene cluster.
TIGR03966 models a protein family that includes
Rv0694, described as a flavocytochrome. TIGR03964
models a family of homologs to creatinine amidohydrolase, including Rv0695. TIGR03968 describes a family of
putative transcriptional regulators related to TetR.
Because these proteins are not universal in mycofactocin
species, and not variable in count when they are present,
their roles are difficult to infer. The flavocytochrome
may be analogous to the NADPH-dependent F420
reductase that enables electron transfer between the
F420 and NADPH electron carrier pools.
The perfect agreement of the radical SAM family
TIGR03962, the glycosyltranferase family TIGR03965, and
peptide family TIGR03969 creates a reliable phylogenetic
profile that enables subsequent data mining to further
characterize the systems. The profile is information-rich,
not just because of sporadic occurrence outside of the
Actinobacteria, but also because of sporadic loss of the
system in lineages where it is most prevalent. It occurs in
Frankia alni ACN14a but not in Frankia sp. CcI3, in most
Mycobacterium species but not in M. leprae, in Geobacter
uraniireducens but not in Geobacter metallireducens, etc.
Exploration beyond the set of 1450 genomes in our all-vsall comparison set, performed using the non-redundant
protein sequence databases at NCBI (April 2010), found
that additional species with strong matches to the radical
SAM protein and to the glycosyltransferase also contained
the putative mycofactocin. These additional species were
Streptomyces sp. AA4 (an Actinobacterium), Geobacter sp.
M18 (a Deltaproteobacterium), and Haloterrigena turkmenica, an archaeal species in which all components are
found on a large plasmid (NC_013744). These additional
species were examined for gene content but were not
included in data mining analyses. Table 2 shows a list of
species contain the mycofactocin gene cluster. Genome
regions containing the mycofactocin gene cluster are
shown in Figure 2.
Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) based on species
distribution of the mycofactocin cluster generates
cofactor-like results

As expected, the top tier of scores from PPP belongs to
proteins already discussed as invariant markers of the
mycofactocin conserved genome neighborhoods. Mycofactocin itself scores poorly because both its small size
and its inconsistent gene identification limit its numbers
of BLAST hits. Strikingly, additional proteins occur just
below the top tier, and for species after species include
one or two sets of closely related paralogs from within

Page 5 of 14

the same genome. This would be the expected pattern
in the case that members of these additional families
depend on the system rather than being required as part
of it. Such would be the case if the families of paralogs
depend on an uncommon molecular cofactor.
Coenzyme PQQ (pyrroloquinoline-quinone) is a
broadly but sparsely distributed cofactor biosynthesis
system, occurring in about 10% of the 1450 genomes
analyzed by systems reconstruction [25]. Table 3 shows
PPP results obtained for Methylobacillus flagellatus KT,
a producer of PQQ. The radical SAM protein PqqE
from the PQQ biosynthetic cluster was used as the marker to define the phylogenetic profile. In M. flagellatus,
the 4th through 8th best hits are paralogs to each other,
scattered throughout the genome rather than clustered,
and all members of protein family TIGR03075, the
PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase, methanol/ethanol
family. By contrast, Mycobacterium smegmatis carries
only one PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase,
MSMEG_3726, readily identified by PPP. This lone
member, the top scoring protein not involved in PQQ
biosynthesis, lies in the same cassette as the biosynthesis
enzymes. These results show a familiar pattern - a single
gene dependent on other genes is likely to be clustered
with it, while a family of several such genes may be scattered. Note that members of family TIGR03075 score
lower by PPP than the PQQ biosynthesis enzymes themselves because their presence in genomes is spottier than
that of PQQ itself. Some PQQ producers instead (or in
addition) encode members of family TIGR03074, the
glucose/quinate/shikimate family of membrane-bound
PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases. Even more striking
results show certain coenzyme F420-synthesizing Actinobacterial species such as Mycobacterium smegmatis to
encode large paralogous families of F420-dependent
flavoproteins that dominate the PPP results [7]. These two
examples, and a recent experimental confirmation [10] for
the F420-dependent enzymes, demonstrate that the biological grammar of biosynthetic systems for unusual redox
factors can show vividly in PPP results. A second tier of
high-scoring proteins, filled with enzymes belonging to
expanded paralogous families, suggests that the enzymes
depend on that redox factor for their function.
PPP for Mycobacterium avium, using the mycofactocin
radical SAM protein model to generate the query profile,
shows an extraordinary number of oxidoreductases of the
short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (SDR)
described by PF00106, twenty-six of the top fifty hits. An
additional five of the top fifty hits belong to PF00107,
oxidoreductases of the zinc-binding dehydrogenase
family. These two cohorts of paralogous proteins each
belong to a distinctive clade within its parent family.
TIGR03971 represents that clade within family PF00106,
and TIGR03989 represents the clade within PF00107.

Multiple members of PF00106, the short chain alcohol
dehydrogenase (SDR) family of oxidoreductases, occur
in the top 1% of PPP results for various mycofactocinencoding genomes. In fact, all of these SDR proteins
belong to a distinctive clade within the PF00106 family,
now described by TIGRFAMs model TIGR03971. This
wing of the SDR family has undergone a significant
paralogous family expansion in multiple members of the
Actinobacteria, with two members (Rv0687 and Rv2750)
in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nine in Rhodococcus
erythropolis SK121, and twenty-six in M. avium. In this
family, a stereoselective carveol dehydrogenase from
Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14 has been characterized
as a novel nicotinoprotein in the SDR family, with
sequence alignment suggesting an extra loop in the
NAD-binding region [26]; the presence of this loop is
conserved across members of TIGR03971. Experimental

characterization of that protein revealed that the NAD
(H) cofactor, although not covalently bound, is not
exchangeable. Demonstrating enzyme activity in vitro
required use of an artificial electron acceptor, dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), to reduce the NAD cofactor
in situ. No member of the TIGR03971 family has a
solved crystal structure, but structure 1NFQ is available
from PDB as a ternary complex with bound NAD(+)
and androsterone for Rv2002 [27], which is one of the
most closely related members of the SDR family outside
of the TIGR03971 family. This NADH-dependent
3alpha, 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is
described as having a catalytic triad Ser-140,Tyr-153,
and Lys-157, with residue Asp-38 called critical for
cofactor specificity. These four critical residues remain
invariant in TIGR03971 sequences.
A limitation of PPP [8] is that it performs its analyses on
full-length proteins. Recently, we addressed this limitation
by introducing SIMBAL, Sites Inferred by Metabolic

extracellular solutebinding protein

Background Assertion Labeling [9], which can find key
domains or motifs within a protein through a mechanism
similar to PPP (see methods). SIMBAL heat maps generated for members of TIGR03971 always show pronounced
peaks centered within the N-terminal 60 residues. For
sequences outside of the Actinobacteria, these peaks dramatically outscore the apex of the triangular heat map, the
single point that represents the full length of the protein.
The sequence represented in the heat map in Figure 3 is
for a member of the TIGR03971 subfamily of the SDR
superfamily from Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum, a
member of the Firmicutes. The absolute peak score occurs
for substrings drawn from within the N-terminal 60 residues; 56 of the 58 most closely related homologous subsequences as scored by BLAST come from genomes that
also encode the mycofactocin system. Comparable length
subsequences from elsewhere in the sequence score much
more poorly, reflected by colder blue and green colors in
the heat map. PPP had already called attention to the
“only-if” relationship between mycofactocin and the
TIGR03971 family of carveol dehydrogenase-like SDR,
with its altered NAD binding loop and non-exchangeable
NAD cofactor. The SIMBAL result, in which a local hotspot outscores the full-length sequence, suggests that PPP
may actually be understating the strength of the linkage
between the N-terminal region and the mycofactocin
system.
The second panel in Figure 3 shows the crystal structure 1NFQ, a member of the SDR family with bound

NAD and substrate [27]. No SDR enzyme within family
TIGR03971 has been crystallized, but aligning sequences
found by SIMBAL to the structure of INFQ can be
informative. Although SIMBAL found a global peak at
in the N-terminal 60 residues using a long subsequence,
examining results for shorter subsequences from this
stretch shows the global peak resolving into two smaller
local peaks. The two local peaks both represent residues
that bind the NAD cofactor directly, while sitting far
from the position of the substrate-binding pocket and
active site residues.
The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family also
contains a subfamily restricted to mycofactocincontaining species

Performing PPP against multiple genomes, with the set
of mycofactocin-encoding species as the query profile
each time, finds several species in which multiple proteins from the zinc dependent alcohol dehydrogenase
family of PF00107 score among the top-scoring proteins.
Mycobacterium avium contains 5 in the top 50. Collecting several of these high-scoring proteins yielded a seed
alignment from which model TIGR03989 was constructed and added to the TIGRFAMs database. Strong
support that the connection to the mycofactocin profile
is meaningful rather than fortuitous comes from the
occurrence of TIGR03989 members in or near the
mycofactocin cluster in genomes such as Thermomicrobium roseum and Haloterrigena turkmenica plasmid
pHTUR01 [see Figure 2]. As with the SDR subfamily in
TIGR03971, occurrence is not universal among mycofactocin producers, but rather can include multiple
members per genome. Again, the structure of this
relationship suggests a family of enzymes with a shared
dependency on a necessary cofactor.
The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family
modeled by PF00107 contains examples of enzymes that
require, besides NAD(P), a second cofactor. These
include the mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium smegmatis and a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase from
Homo sapiens - two homologous enzymes that both
bind NAD, and both act on adducts of the same substrate, but that rely on different coenzymes [28].
SIMBAL might have been expected to show clearly a
mycofactocin interaction site. For several different members of family TIGR03989, however, probing with
SIMBAL reveals that the best scores from individual
subsequences are merely comparable to the score for
the full-length sequence, rather than clearly exceeding
it. This flatness limits prospects for producing strong
inference from SIMBAL heat maps. The heat map for
member gi|28416709 from Haloterrigena is shown for
completeness in Figure 4. It does not single out any

particular site or sites as being the most critical for
recognizing that a zinc-dependent dehydrogenase originates from a genome that encodes the mycofactocin
systems. It does reveal, however, that best matches to
certain regions of protein structure, such as those associated with homodimerization rather than with cofactor
binding, show very little correlation to the mycofactocin
system.
The iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family shows
peak scores at the NAD binding site

A third protein family in which several paralogs from
the same genome occur among sequences with top
scores by PPP is again a set of nicotinoproteins, this
time the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase family
modeled by Pfam HMM PF00465. Once again, the link
is supported by gene location, close to the mycofactocin
biosynthesis cluster. And again, the subfamily formed by
PPP-nominated members of the larger family, when

tested, is found to be absent outside of mycofactocin
producers, and sporadic rather than universal among
them. This relationship once again supports the notion
that the dehydrogenase subfamily has a dependency on
mycofactocin, rather than a role in producing it.

Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI. Data sets numbered 974 sequences in the TRUE partition and 6998 in the FALSE partition after being
made non-redundant to less than 80% sequence identity. The X coordinate represents the location of the center of each subsequence along the
full-length protein sequence, the Y coordinate represents the size of subsequence tested. The plot is triangular, narrowing as it rises, because
longer subsequences are more constrained and have less room to slide from N-terminus to C-terminus. Panel B: Structure 1NFQ of Rv2002, an
NADH-dependent 3alpha, 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the SDR family. Bound NAD+ is shown in yellow and androsterone in blue.
Active site resides Ser-140, Tyr-153, and Lys-157 are shown in cyan with their side chains as space-filling spheres. Highlighted in brown and red
are regions from Rv2002 that map by pairwise alignment to the locally top SIMBAL hit sequences from PTH_0592 at subsequence sizes of 8
(brown) and size 12 (red), both taken from within the absolute highest scoring subsequence.

in this position easily could regulate the ability of the
nicotinoprotein to give access by other components of
electron transport chains to its bound NAD. The interpretation is guarded, however, as the total number of
sequences in the YES partition is relatively small.
Furthermore, it has not been possible to build an HMM
that finds all PPP-nominated members of this family
while systematically excluding all homologs from mycofactocin-negative genomes. It may be that recruitment
of PF00465 family iron-dependent dehydrogenases to
the hypothesized mycofactocin system has occurred two
or more times independently.
All three nicotinoprotein families identified by PPP are
supported by co-clustering with the mycofactocin gene
cluster in multiple species. The subfamily with the largest numbers of paralogs identified by PPP vs. the
mycofactocin cluster is the TIGR03971 branch of the
SDR family. Certain members of TIGR03971 have a
literature describing an unusual non-exchangeable NAD
binding site and unknown physiological electron acceptor. SIMBAL analysis shows for the TIGR03971 family,
the salient feature in the heat map is exactly the NADbinding region. The finding is repeated in the much
smaller set of iron-dependent oxidoreductases, with
SIMBAL analysis pointing precisely to the NAD. The
fact that several of these oxidoreductases have been at
least partially characterized, and shown to contain NAD

per se, leads us to hypothesize that mycofactocin, perhaps held by a carrier protein, interacts with these proteins near the site of its tightly bound NAD in order to
allow electron transport, rather than serving as an NAD
analog able to bind in place of NAD.

Discussion
Results from PPP suggest that several paralogous
families of enzymes, small clades of nicotinoproteins
within each of the SDR, Zn-dependent, and Fe-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase families, are functionally
linked to an operon that contains a probable polypeptide-modifying radical SAM protein and its apparent
target. The presence of this operon seems not only to
allow the occurrence of members of these nicotinoprotein special subfamilies within genomes, but provide
opportunities for considerable expansion of those subfamilies, as seen by the twenty-six SDR in Mycobacterium
avium.
In some Rv0693 family-containing Actinobacteria, there
have been observations of oxidoreductases whose NAD
cofactor is not exchangeable, whose activity therefore can
be observed only in the presence of artificial electron
acceptors, and whose electron transfer partners in vivo are
unknown. These nicotinoproteins include carveol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14[26] and
several alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases from

TRUE partition and 3620 in the FALSE partition after making the sets
non-redundant to no more than 80% sequence identity. The apex
score of 30.1 nears that of highest local score, consistent with the
ability of TIGR03989 to identify large numbers of members found
exclusively in mycofactocin-producing species. Interesting features
include extended cool (blue and green) regions such as the Nterminal region of about 80 residues, which contains regions well
conserved among Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases yet
apparently poorly predictive for whether or not a matching
protein’s genome of origin contains the mycofactocin cluster.

Amycolatopsis methanolica [29,30]. They belong to three
mutually non-homologous alcohol dehydrogenase families:
the Short Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase family (SDR)
of Pfam model [16] PF00106, the zinc-binding family of
PF00107, and the iron-activated family of PF00465. But
further, they belong specifically to the particular branches
of these families detected by PPP when the species distribution of the mycofactocin cluster is used as the query
profile.
Each of the three subfamilies of interest may be absent
from any one mycofactocin-containing genome, but
more commonly occurs with multiple members present.
On the other hand, the mycofactocin system never
occurs unless at least one of the three subfamilies has
members present. When the mycofactocin operon is
absent in a close taxonomic neighbor (as in M. leprae,
Frankia sp. CcI3, Geobacter metallireducens, etc.) to a
species that has the operon, then these three subfamilies
of nicotinoproteins are absent as well. This pattern suggests that each of these nicotinoprotein subfamilies
depends on the presence of the mycofactocin system,
while the utility of the mycofactocin system to a species
depends on the presence of at least one of the three
subfamilies. Overall, these relationships suggest nicotinoproteins that are linked to mycofactocin through
cofactor interactions rather than, say, through pools of
substrates.

2BL4. Panel B shows the secondary structure cartoon of 2BL4 in green. The NAD cofactor is shown as space-filling spheres in yellow, and the
iron atom as a blue sphere. The sequence identified by homology to the SIMBAL hot spot from panel A is shown in red, making close contact
with the NAD but not with the iron atom. The location of the hot spot is consistent with a role in controlling the ability of NAD to exchange
electrons to other redox carriers.

Mycofactocin is not associated with any transporters
or any recognizable immunity proteins. The precursor
lacks an apparent signal peptide or cleavage signal. The
final four residues of mycofactocin, Cys-Gly-Val-Tyr, are
invariant from Actinobacteria to Firmicutes to Proteobacteria to Archaea. Tyrosine is aromatic, consistent
with an electron carrier role. Cysteine is a commonly
modified residue in bacteriocin maturation, as in the
three Cys side chains bridged to other main chain
atoms of other residues by a AlbA during subtilosin A
biosynthesis. An adjacent glycine allows for the minimum possible steric hindrance to a possible chemical
rearrangement of the peptide backbone. Further study
of this system will require direct experimental efforts to
purify and characterize mycofactocin from natural or
reconstituted systems, and to screen more members of
the oxidoreductase families for activity in the presence
of artificial electron acceptors. Meanwhile, this study
suggests that additional radical SAM enzymes, and perhaps other peptide modification enzymes known from
the study of bacteriocin biosynthesis systems, may act
upon additional classes of short peptides to create
products built not for export, but rather for direct roles
in cellular metabolism.

Conclusion
A broadly but sparsely distributed conserved operon,
found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and
in the Archaea, connects a novel radical SAM protein
family to a short peptide, nearly invariant at its C-terminus, that may be its substrate. The putative product,
called mycofactocin, occurs only in genomes that
encode variant forms of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases in which the NAD cofactors, when examined,
were not exchangeable. Investigation of these dehydrogenases shows that sequence similarities near the cofactor binding site offer the best prediction as to whether
or not a related dehydrogenase is from a mycofactocinencoding genome. The results suggest the existence of a
novel natural product with electron carrier activity, partnered with novel classes of redox enzymes, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and numerous other bacteria.
Methods
Partial Phylogenetic Profiling

Obtaining a list of best BLAST [31] hits to a protein and
picking some arbitrary cutoff to truncate the list provides
a crude working description for a protein family. Certain
well-chosen cutoffs can do particularly well both including proteins that share a specific function and excluding
those that don’t, but such cutoffs may be hard to determine. However, given a phylogenetic profile to serve as a
reference, and evaluating all possible BLAST score cutoffs to find where the list of genomes of origin for the

Page 12 of 14

included set best matches the phylogenetic profile, makes
it possible to choose candidate cutoffs correctly. Once
each protein in a genome receives an individually optimized cutoff to find how well it can match the profile, all
proteins can be ranked. Partial Phylogenetic Profiling
(PPP) [8,32] produces this ranked list, simultaneously
nominating the best scoring proteins additional components of multigene systems and suggesting reasonable
preliminary cutoffs for new protein family definitions.
Partial Phylogenetic Profiling (PPP) [8] was performed
using pre-computed BLAST results on 1450 complete
or high quality draft prokaryotic genomes. PPP explores
a genome for proteins that may belong to families closely tied to some taxonomic distribution (usually defined
by the presence of some other marker). To perform its
search, it scores each protein independently, running
down its list of most closely matching proteins by
BLAST and selecting the cutoff for which the list of
species encountered most closely matches the profile
used to conduct the query.
TIGRFAMs model TIGR03962 was used as the protein family decision rule, or marker, to determine which
genomes contain the mycofactocin system, thus generating the query profile. This species list was verified by
searches with the glycosyltransferase model TIGR03965
and the possible carrier protein model TIGR03967. For
additional study, genomes not included in the set of
1450 were searched at NCBI using PSI-BLAST [31] with
manual review at each iterative step.
HMM construction

Hidden Markov Model construction follows manual
review of multiple sequence alignment membership and
alignment quality, inferred molecular phylogenetic trees,
and cutoff scores, according to practices described for
the TIGRFAMs project [17]. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with MUSCLE [33].
SIMBAL

SIMBAL, or Sites Inferred by Metabolic Assertion
Labeling, functions much like a variant of PPP that can
generate independently calculated scores for any subsequence of any length. For a single protein family
(e.g. PF00106), members found in the collection of complete reference genomes are split into TRUE and FALSE
partitions of a training set, based not on any known
attribute of the protein itself, but rather on a computed
attribute such as whether or not its genome of origin
appears capable of a particular biosynthesis. Next, one
member sequence is selected to test, and all possible
subsequences are compared by BLAST to a combined
data set containing both partitions. Subsequences score
best when sequences from the TRUE partition dominate
the BLAST results; for each subsequence, exploration of

Haft BMC Genomics 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/21

different BLAST score cutoffs finds the cutoff that gives
the best possible score for the subsequence.
SIMBAL scores can be shown graphically in the form
of a heat map, with the x-axis representing the center of
each subsequence, the y-axis representing the length of
the subsequence, and points colored on a scale from
least significant (blue) to most signifant (red). Because
there are fewer ways to select longer subsequences,
culminating in just one way to select the full-length
sequence, SIMBAL heat maps are triangular, with the
apex representing the whole protein. The score at the
apex, therefore, most nearly resembles Partial Phylogenetic Profiling, while plumes in the heat map that rise
from short subsequences indicate sites that contribute
strongly both to specific function and to PPP score.
Aligning these high-scoring subsequences to sequences
with solved three-dimensional structures can distinguish
whether SIMBAL peaks correspond to sites that interact
with substrates, with cofactors, or with other proteins.
Training sets for SIMBAL [9] were performed with by
using the phylogenetic profiles to guide the partitioning
of protein families PF00106, PF00107, and PF0465 [16].
Fragmentary sequences were removed, and data sets
were thinned by removing one of every pair of
sequences greater than 80% identical in sequence. Training set sizes were 974 TRUE and 6998 FALSE (12.2%
TRUE) for the SDR family PF00106, 590 TRUE and
3620 FALSE from Zn-dependent family PF00107 (14%
TRUE), and 62 TRUE, 1555 FALSE from the Fe-dependent family PF00465) (3.8% TRUE). Crystal structure
interpretation was performed with the aid of MacPyMol
http://www.pymol.org/, using crystal structures downloaded from PDB. SIMBAL hot spot sequences were
aligned to their own full-length sequences and to the
corresponding sequences of proteins with solved crystal
structures, and the alignments were inspected manually
to confirm accuracy.
