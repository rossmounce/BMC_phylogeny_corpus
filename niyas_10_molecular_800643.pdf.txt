Abstract
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthritogenic alphavirus, is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and
Ae.albopictus mosquitoes. In the study, reverse-transcription PCR (RT PCR) and virus isolation detected CHIKV in
patient samples and also in adult Ae.albopictus mosquitoes that was derived from larvae collected during a chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak in Kerala in 2009. The CHIKV strains involved in the outbreak were the East, Central and
South African (ECSA) genotype that had the E1 A226V mutation. The viral strains from the mosquitoes and CHIK
patients from the same area showed a close relationship based on phylogenetic analysis. Genetic characterization
by partial sequencing of non-structural protein 2 (nsP2; 378 bp), envelope E1 (505 bp) and E2 (428 bp) identified
one critical mutation in the E2 protein coding region of these CHIKV strains. This novel, non-conservative mutation,
L210Q, consistently present in both human and mosquito-derived samples studied, was within the region of the
E2 protein (amino acids E2 200-220) that determines mosquito cell infectivity in many alpha viruses. Our results
show the involvement of Ae. albopictus in this outbreak in Kerala and appearance of CHIKV with novel genetic
changes. Detection of virus in adult mosquitoes, emerged in the laboratory from larvae, also points to the possibility of transovarial transmission (TOT) of mutant CHIKV strains in mosquitoes.
Findings
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus of the
Togaviridae family and is an important re-emerging
pathogen. It has been responsible for major fever epidemics in many parts of the world [1,2]. The disease,
chikungunya (CHIK), is characterized by high fever,
headache, myalgia, severe and prolonged arthralgia, and
erythematous skin rashes [1]. In general, it is considered
as a self-limiting illness. However, recent outbreaks of
CHIK exhibited unusual severity, neurological complications and suspected mortality [3-6]. The disease is transmitted by the bite of Aedes ( Ae.) aegypti and Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes. Studies have shown that Ae.
albopictus facilitates rapid transmission of the new

strains of CHIKV that had adaptive mutations in the
viral genome [7,8].
CHIK epidemic has caused considerable morbidity in
recent years in India [9,10]. Kerala, in South India, was
one among the worst affected states [11-14]. Abundance
of Ae.albopictus in many parts of the state was implicated for the rapid spread of the infection [11]. Recent
studies carried out in CHIKV from Kerala [11,12,14]
have revealed novel genetic changes in the virus isolates
from 2006-2008 outbreaks. Reports on virus isolation
from mosquito vectors from the region are currently
not available. The aim of the present work was to look
for novel genetic changes in the isolates from 2009 by
sequence analysis of selected genomic regions, and also
to look for CHIKV in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes
The study was done during a fever outbreak in MaySeptember 2009 in Kozhikkode district of northern Kerala (Figure 1). All the patients included in the study had

classical symptoms of CHIK [15]. Samples were
obtained from the outpatient department of three Primary Health Centres (Olavanna, Beypore and Chaliyum)
in the district. 2-5ml of whole blood was collected from
patients who were clinically diagnosed with CHIK and
had a history of fever of 1-5 days duration. Samples
were transported to the laboratory in wet-ice; serum
was separated and stored in aliquots at -80°C. Standard
ethical and bio-safety guidelines were followed, and
informed consent was obtained from all the patients
prior to blood withdrawal.
For virus detection in mosquitoes, households of
CHIK patients, whose serum samples were confirmed in
the laboratory by RT-PCR, were subsequently visited
and larval sampling was done. Stagnant water collected

in discarded articles such as coconut shells, broken
earthern-wares, plastic bottles and damaged drains were
searched for Ae. albopictus larvae. Third and fourth
instar larvae and pupae were phenotypically identified
in situ using standard keys and these were collected and
transferred to containers with fresh water. Four households each in Olavanna and Chaliyum, and three households in Beypore were surveyed. Larvae and pupae
collected from each location were made into a single
pool. In the laboratory, these three pools were independently reared in bowls with water, kept in mosquito
cages at an ambient temperature of 25-30°C and a relative humidity 60-70%. The newly emerged adult mosquitoes were collected and frozen at -20°C for 30 minutes.
Whole-mosquito tissue extracts were prepared by

homogenizing pools of adult mosquitoes [each pool with
30 individual mosquitoes (both males and females)
representing a single location]. Frozen mosquitoes were
homogenized in 700 μl of Dulbecos Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) using a micropestle. These were then
clarified by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4°C and sterilized by filtering through 0.2 μM membrane filter
(Millex GV, Millipore) and used for RNA isolation.
RNA isolation from the 70 patient serum samples and
the three extracts from mosquito samples were carried
out using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, GmBH,
Hilden) exactly as per the kit protocol. Single-step RT
PCR was done using 10 μl of the isolated RNA from all
the samples using Fidelitaq RT-PCR kit (USB, Cleveland,
Ohio), as previously described [14]. PCR primers (Table
1; Figure 2) for CHIKV detection PCR were designed
based on earlier reports [16] and on the conserved
genomic regions of local strains of CHIKV [14]. The
conditions for RT PCR were: a reverse transcription
step at 50°C for 45 min; followed by 35 cycles of thermal cycling, which included denaturation at 95°C for 1
min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and an extension at
68°C for 2 min. Extreme care was taken to avoid PCRcontamination, by carrying out the pre-and post amplification steps in laboratories located in separate buildings
and also by including a non-template control in all
amplifications.
For nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis,
15 clinical samples and all the three mosquito-derived
samples were used. Only clinical samples that gave a
high intensity amplicon in the primary detection PCR
were selected to ensure that sufficient DNA would be
available for sequencing reactions. Five clinical samples
each from Olavanna, Beypore and Chaliyum were used,
making a total of 15 samples. Selected regions of the

CHIKV genome (nucleotide position, with respect to
S27 reference sequence AF369024: nsP2 3134-3636; E2
8832-9332; E1 10246-10539; Table 1; Figure 2) were
amplified by RT PCR as described above using new sets
of primers (Table1; Figure 2). These specific regions
were chosen as they showed nucleotide variability and
novel mutations in our previous study with the local
strains of CHIKV [14], making them suitable for phylogenetic analysis. Purified PCR products were directly
subjected to automated DNA sequencing as per manufacturer’s directions in an ABI-Prism 3730 Genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
sequences were aligned with corresponding CHIKV
sequences obtained from NCBI GenBank using Clustal
W program of MEGA3.1 [17] software, with Kimura-2
distance correction. To get representation from different
gene segments in the evolution of the CHIKV strains,
the partial sequences of nsP2, E2 and E1 genes were
arranged in tandem to obtain a 1311 bp sequence (Figure 3a), which was then used for phylogenetic analysis.
The phylogeny was reconstructed by Neighbor-Joining
method with 10,000 bootstrap replications using the
MEGA 3.1 program. 100 μL of the mosquito extracts or
patient serum samples were used for CHIKV isolation
in confluent monolayer of Vero cells cultured in 75cm2
flasks, as per standardized protocols [14]. The titration
of CHIKV in the infected cultures was done by plaque
assay using a carboxymethyl-cellulose overlay method
[18] on Vero cells.
CHIKV RNA was detected in 49 out of the 70 patient
samples (70%) and in adult mosquitoes derived from larvae from Chaliyum and Olavanna by RT PCR (Figure 4).
All the three mosquito derived samples were positive for
CHIKV, as indicated by cytopathic effects and RT PCR
(Figure 4), in the 3rd passage of virus isolation in Vero

supernatants from these infected cells had a virus titre
of 2.0 × 10 11 , 3.3 × 10 10 , 1.4 × 10 10 plaque forming
units (pfu) ml-1 for samples from Olavanna, Chaliyum
and Beypore, respectively.
Analysis of the partial nucleotide sequences of nsP2
(378 bp; position 3246-3623), E1 (position 10427-10931)
and E2 (position 8893- 9320) revealed a few random
nucleotide changes in the CHKV isolates studied (Additional File 1) with respect to the corresponding
sequences of the previous isolates from Kerala [14]. The
nucleotide change T3297C observed in the 2007 & 2008
Kerala isolates, causing an L539 S mutation in the nsP2
protein, was absent in CHIKV strains of the present
outbreak. A novel substitution (T3296C) was consistently observed in a few strains from patients
(RGCB711, RGCB730, and RGCB755) and in all the
three isolates from mosquito samples. However, this was
a synonymous substitution. The E1 sequence of all the
strains had the C10670T substitution resulting in the
A226V mutation identified in the recent isolates of
CHIKV [3,14]. Another new substitution (E1 G10864A)
detected consistently in all the mosquito-derived strains
and two of the clinical isolates (RGCB711 & RGCB755)
can result in an amino acid change of V291I. Two
nucleotide substitutions (A9114G and T9170A) were
observed in the E2 coding region of all the strains studied from the outbreak. The latter substitution resulted
in an amino acid change L210Q in the predicted
sequence of amino acids of the E2 protein. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that the strains involved in the outbreak were closely related to the East-Central South
African genotype of the CHIKV (Figure 3b). The gene
sequences of CHIKV obtained from mosquito and

patient samples formed a close cluster, distinct from the
strains isolated previously from Kerala [14], rest of India
and other parts of the world. This show a common
genetic origin of the virus strains from patients and
mosquitoes in this outbreak.
Apart from these genetic changes, an interesting
observation in the study was the detection of CHIKV
from adult mosquitoes derived from larval samples.
Considering that these mosquitoes were freshly
emerged in the laboratory from the larvae collected
from areas encountering a CHIK outbreak and did not
have a blood-meal, the possibility of acquiring the
virus through transovarial transmission (TOT) can be
thought of. Even though TOT has been proven in flaviviruses [19-23], the occurrence of this phenomenon
in alphaviruses is still inconclusive [24-27]. Studies
using a Réunion Island isolate of the CHIKV from
2006 outbreak [Strain 06.21; GenBank: AM258992]
could not demonstrate vertical transmission in the
mosquito vector [25]. The mosquito infectivity of
alphaviruses is modulated by mutations in specific viral
proteins [28-31]. Amino acid residues 200-220 of the
E2 protein determine the cellular receptor tropism and
mid-gut infectivity in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes [28,30].
An E2 I211T mutation was found to strongly enhance
Ae.albopictus infectivity of CHIKV strains with the E1
A226V change [31]. Both the mutations were present
in the isolates in this study and also in the recent
Indian isolates [10,12,14] (Figure 5). Interestingly, the
novel mutation in E2 (L210Q) that was detected exclusively in these 2009 CHIKV strains was adjacent to the
E2-211 position. This substitution of the aliphatic
amino acid leucine with glutamine, an amino acid with
polar side chains, can have critical effects on local

protein structure. One of the predicted effects of such
amino acid changes is the exposure of buried protein
surfaces. Possibly, this may alter the interaction of E2
with other proteins, particularly with cellular receptors,
and may change the tissue tropism. However, more
studies are required to understand the effects of the
L210Q mutation.

The results from this study, along with the previous
observations [11,12,14], indicate a constant genomic
evolution of the CHIKV strains circulating in Kerala.
The availability of large numbers of Ae.albopictus vector
mosquitoes [11] and an immunologically naïve human
population unexposed to CHIK in different parts of the
state might facilitate recurrent infections and viral

evolution. Emergence of newer strains with altered virulence and transmission potential is a possible out come
of the long term viral persistence in the community.
Further entomological and virological studies with these
new CHIKV strains would help to understand the changing epidemiology of this re-emerging virus.
