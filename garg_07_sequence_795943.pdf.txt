Abstract
Background: The Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a leading malaria
vaccine candidate antigen. The complete AMA1 protein is comprised of three domains where
domain I exhibits high sequence polymorphism and is thus named as the hyper-variable region
(HVR). The present study describes the extent of genetic polymorphism and natural selection at
domain I of the ama1 gene among Indian P. falciparum isolates.
Methods: The part of the ama1 gene covering domain I was PCR amplified and sequenced from
157 P. falciparum isolates collected from five different geographical regions of India. Statistical and
phylogenetic analyses of the sequences were done using DnaSP ver. 4. 10. 9 and MEGA version 3.0
packages.
Results: A total of 57 AMA1 haplotypes were observed among 157 isolates sequenced. Forty-six
of these 57 haplotypes are being reported here for the first time. The parasites collected from the
high malaria transmission areas (Assam, Orissa, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands) showed more
haplotypes (H) and nucleotide diversity π as compared to low malaria transmission areas (Uttar
Pradesh and Goa). The comparison of all five Indian P. falciparum subpopulations indicated
moderate level of genetic differentiation and limited gene flow (Fixation index ranging from 0.048
to 0.13) between populations. The difference between rates of non-synonymous and synonymous
mutations, Tajima's D and McDonald-Kreitman test statistics suggested that the diversity at domain
I of the AMA1 antigen is due to positive natural selection. The minimum recombination events
were also high indicating the possible role of recombination in generating AMA1 allelic diversity.
Conclusion: The level of genetic diversity and diversifying selection were higher in Assam, Orissa,
and Andaman and Nicobar Islands populations as compared to Uttar Pradesh and Goa. The
amounts of gene flow among these populations were moderate. The data reported here will be
valuable for the development of AMA1-based malaria vaccine.

Background

Methods

The Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the major
causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. Worldwide, approximately 300–500
million people are affected each year with the disease and
children below 5 years of age and pregnant women are the
largest target groups. The global burden of human malaria
is continued to increase due to lack of an effective malaria
vaccine, development of insecticide resistance in the
Anopheles, and drug resistance in the parasite. Several parasite molecules have been tested for their potential as a
vaccine candidate antigens [1]. Majority of these antigens
are expressed on the parasite's surface or the parasitized
erythrocytes. The Plasmodium proteins expressed on the
parasite's surface are more exposed to human immune
system and thus have been found to exhibit high antigenic
diversity [2]. Genetic polymorphisms in the parasite antigens help them to evade the host's protective immune
response but at the same time it hampers the development of an effective vaccine which can contain this disease.

Parasite collection
Patients attending malaria clinics at Kamprup (Assam),
Cuttack (Orissa), Car Nicobar (A & N), Ghaziabad and
Aligarh (UP) and Panjim (Goa) were tested for the presence of P. falciparum. About 50–100 μl of blood was collected from the microscopically P. falciparum positive
patients with their informed consent. The institutional
ethical guidelines were followed for blood collection.

The P. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is
an 83 kDa membrane protein expressed in the late schizont stage of the parasite [3,4]. Although the exact function of AMA1 is not known, its role in merozoite invasion
has been documented by several investigators and antibodies raised against this protein have been shown to
block invasion of the parasites into human RBCs [5-9].
Natural immune responses (both humoral and cellular)
against the AMA1 antigen have been observed in populations exposed to P. falciparum malaria [10]. Thus, AMA1
has been included as one of the potential components of
an asexual stage multivalent malaria vaccine. An AMA1based malaria vaccine has recently been tested in phase I
clinical trial [11]. Although AMA1 is less polymorphic
than other sporozoite or merozoite proteins, some extent
of variation are present across the entire AMA1 sequence
[12-14] but the rate of non-synonymous (dN) mutations
at domain I (aa 138–308) has always been higher indicating that this domain is under strong diversifying selection
[13,15,16].
Antigenic variation in Plasmodium has hampered malaria
vaccine development because the antibodies elicited
against one allele of an antigen might not necessarily
inhibit RBCs invasion by the parasites expressing different
alleles of that antigen [17,18]. Therefore, polymorphism
studies on the AMA1 antigen of natural P. falciparum populations need to be done before initiating any clinical trials of a vaccine using this antigen. This study describes the
extent of antigenic diversity and natural selection at
domain I of AMA1 among Indian P. falciparum populations. The results obtained here will have significant
implications in malaria vaccine development.

DNA isolation and PCR amplification of the ama 1 gene
DNA from P. falciparum infected blood was isolated as
described previously [19]. This DNA was used to amplify
the complete 2 kb ama1 gene using the AMA1-F (5'ACAAAAATGAGAAAATTATACTGC-3') and AMA1-R (5'TTTTAATAGTATGGTTTTTCCATC-3') primers. The cycling
parameters for the primary PCR were as follows: 10 minutes initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 35 cycles
with 1 minute denaturation at 94°C, 1 minute annealing
at 55°C, 2 minute extension at 72°C and a final 10
minute extension at 72°C. The primary PCR product was
diluted 10-times and 2 μl of it was used in nested-PCR to
amplify the 500 bp region encompassing domain I (or
hyper-variable region-HVR) using the AHVR-F (5'CTGGAACTCAATATAGACTTC-3') and AHVR-R (5'TTCTTTCTAGGGCAAACTTTTTC-3') primers. The cycling
parameters for nested primers were the same as for primary PCR primers except that the extension at 72°C was
carried out for 1 minute.
Nucleotide sequencing and sequence analysis
The desired 500 bp DNA band was excised from the agarose gel and purified as described earlier [19]. Sequencing
of the product was done from both strands using AHVR-F
and AHVR-R primers. Sequencing PCR cycling parameters
and other downstream protocols for sequencing were
same as described earlier [19]. The sequences were edited
and the translated amino acids were aligned amongst
themselves and also with P. falciparum 3D7 [GenBank;
NC_004315], Dd2 [GenBank; AASM01002002] and HB3
[GenBank; AANS01001407] strains AMA1 sequences
using GeneDoc Version 2.6.002 program [20]. In addition, BLAST searches were also performed to compare
these AMA1 haplotypes with the other AMA1 sequences
available in the GenBank database. The sequences
reported in this paper have been deposited in the database
[GenBank; EF413088–EF413170].
Statistical and phylogenetic analyses
The numbers of segregating sites (S), observed nucleotide
diversity per site between any two sequences assuming
that the sample is random (π), number of haplotypes (H),
haplotype diversity (Hd), and average number of pairwise
nucleotide differences within population (K), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and recombination parameters (R and

Rm) were calculated using DnaSP ver. 4. 10. 9 [21]. The π
diversity was also calculated on sliding window of 100
bases, with a step size of 25 bp in order to estimate the
step-wise diversity across domain I. The rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) mutations were
computed on MEGA version 3.0 [22] using the method of
Nei and Gojobori's [23] with the Jukes and Cantor (JC)
correction. The dN-dS difference and Tajima's D [24] test
statistics were applied to test the neutral theory of evolution. Positive values for Nei-Gojobori (dN-dS) and
Tajima's D correspond to positive natural selection
whereas negative values correspond to negative or purifying selection [25]. In addition, McDonald & Kreitman
(MK) [26] test was also applied as a test of neutrality taking partial P. reichenowi AMA1 sequence as an outgroup
using DnaSP. The MK test compares dS and dN mutations
within and between species. Under neutrality, the ratio of
dN/dS mutations between species should be the same as
the ratio of dN/dS mutations within species. However,
when the dN/dS ratio is greater between species than
within species, it is said to be under positive natural selection. In case of negative selection, the dN/dS ratio
between species is lower than within species. The genetic
differentiation among the parasite populations was calculated in terms of fixation index (Fst) that estimates diversity within a subpopulation with respect to total genetic
diversity. In addition, average number of pairwise nucleotide differences (Kxy), nucleotide substitution per site
(Dxy), and net nucleotide substitution per site (Da)
between populations were also calculated. The above
parameters were also estimated on DnaSP. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed by neighbour-joining (NJ)
method with Kimura 2-parameter distance matrix [27] in
MEGA version 3.0 [22].

Results
Haplotype diversity and amino acid changes at domain I
The nucleotide sequence encoding domain I of the AMA1
was determined from 157 clinical isolates collected from
five different geographical regions (Assam, n = 28; Orissa,
n = 35; A & N, n = 40; UP, n = 36; and Goa, n = 18) of
India with different malaria transmission intensities. The
analysis of the 456 bp sequence obtained (corresponding
to 448–903 bp region of the ama1 gene encoding for
amino acid residues 150–301) for these 157 isolates
revealed that, 418 nucleotide positions were either monomorphic or invariable. Remaining 44 (9.64%) sites were
polymorphic (8 singleton variables and 36 parsimony
informative), that generated 57 different AMA1 haplotypes (H1 to H57) among Indian P. falciparum populations (Additional File 1). The two predominant AMA1
haplotypes were H56 (13.37%, n = 157) and H57
(15.92%, n = 157) (Additional File 1). Thirty-one haplotypes (H1 – H31) were unique as each one of them was
found in a single isolate only. The BLAST search against all

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/154

P. falciparum AMA1 sequences available in the GenBank
database confirmed that 46 of these 57 haplotypes were
new as they have not been reported earlier from any other
region of the world. The remaining eleven haplotypes
showed 100% identity with the AMA1 sequences reported
from other countries [12,13,16,28]. The H56 was the only
haplotype that showed 100% identity with the already
reported AMA1 sequences [AAG50135] from Indian P. falciparum isolate [13]. Furthermore, none of the isolates had
identical sequences to the 3D7, Dd2 or HB3 AMA1 alleles.
The number of AMA1 haplotypes in Assam (H = 20),
Orissa (H = 23), and A & N (H = 18) were higher than
those seen in UP (H = 10) and Goa (H = 7). Majority
(14.28%, n = 28) of the isolates from Assam showed H48
haplotype which was not found among the isolates
sequenced from the four other areas. Similarly, H57 was
the predominant haplotype in Orissa and A & N but not
seen in Assam (Additional File 2). Certain haplotypes
were found to be region specific, and also none of the 57
haplotypes was common to all the five study areas (Additional File 2). Most (47.22%, n = 36) of the isolates from
UP had H56 AMA1 haplotype that was not found in Goa
isolates.
Amino acid polymorphisms were observed at 29 of the
152 codons (456 bp) across the entire domain I (Additional File 1). Of these 29 polymorphic sites, 17 [codons162 (N/K), 167 (T/K), 173 (N/K), 175 (D/Y), 189 (L/P),
190 (M/I), 196 (D/N), 199 (R/K), 206 (K/E), 218 (S/P),
225 (N/I), 228 (N/K), 242 (Y/D), 244 (D/N), 267 (E/Q),
269 (K/I), and 296 (D/H)] showed di-morphic, 8 [codons
172 (G/E/V), 204 (N/D/G), 207 (Y/D/V), 230 (K/E/Q),
243 (N/K/E), 282 (K/I/N), 283 (S/L/P) and 285 (Q/E/R)]
showed tri-morphic, 3 [codons 187 (N/E/K/D), 200 (D/L/
H/R) and 201 (F/L/S/V)] showed tetra-morphic and only
one site [codon 197 (G/D/H/Q/V)] showed penta-morphic alleles.
The number of polymorphic codons and number of total
mutations for Assam (25 polymorphic codons and 37
mutations), Orissa (27 polymorphic codons and 38
mutations) and A & N (24 polymorphic codons and 33
mutations) isolates were almost equal but greater than the
isolates from UP (20 polymorphic codons and 26 mutations) and Goa (16 polymorphic codons and 20 mutations). Sixteen of the 29 polymorphic codons were
common to all the five regions whereas, remaining 13
codons were showing region-specific polymorphisms.
The N173K, L189P, and D244N mutations were found
among the isolates from Assam and Orissa only but not
among A & N, UP and Goa isolates. The codon polymorphisms D175Y, D/N204G, Y/D207V, S218P and Q/
E285R were A & N specific whereas G/E172V, E/N/
K187D, R199K and K269I were Orissa-specific. Only two

Assam-specific mutations were observed (K/I282N and S/
L283P) while no region-specific mutations was found
among the isolates sequenced from UP and Goa.

Inter-population nucleotide differences (Kxy) varied from
8.3 (between UP and Goa) to 11.53 (Assam and A & N)
(Table 3). Similarly, the average number of nucleotide
(Dxy) and net nucleotide (Da) substitutions per site
between populations ranged from 0.018 to 0.025 and
0.00135 to 0.0755 respectively (Table 3). Although Fst
statistics for the whole Indian P. falciparum populations
was found to be 0.085, the Fst values between different
geographical populations varied from 0.048 (between
Orissa and Goa) to 0.133 (between UP and Orissa) (Table
3). The phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed
that only 14 AMA1 alleles were shared by more than one
geographical area (Additional File 2). Therefore, no
region-wise clustering of the alleles was observed (Figure
2). Inter-population comparison of the total (TM) versus
shared (SM) number of mutations also showed similar

Nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation
The haplotype (gene) diversity (Hd) for all 157 sequences
was calculated to be 0.948 ± 0.010 SD. The average
number of pairwise nucleotide differences within Indian
P. falciparum population (K) was 10.13 with the overall π
diversity 0.0222 ± 0.0005 SD (Table 1). However, the sliding window analysis of the entire 456 bp region estimated
π diversity ranging from 0.00668–0.05126 with the highest value between nucleotide positions 50 and 200
(0.01501 to 0.02488) (Figure 1). A total of 12 minimum
number of recombination (Rm) events were observed
between adjacent polymorphic sites (Table 2). The estimates of R = 4Nr between adjacent sites and per gene were
0.123 and 56.2 respectively. The haplotype diversity (Hd),
nucleotide diversity per site (π) and average number of
pairwise nucleotide differences within population (K)
showed regional variations (Table 1). The π diversity was
highest between nucleotide positions 50 and 200 among
all five populations as estimated by sliding window
method using a step size of 25 bp (Figure 1).

phylogeny and Fst indicated moderate level of genetic differentiation and thus a limited movement of genes
between populations.

The average difference of dN-dS for all 157 AMA1
sequences was 0.027 ± 0.006 SD, indicating that domain
I is under positive natural selection (Table 1). The dN-dS
differences were almost equal for Assam, Orissa and A &

Note: The R and Rm were estimated excluding the sites containing
alignment gaps or those segregating for three nucleotides. The R was
computed using R = 4Nr, where N is the population size and r is the
recombination rate per sequence (per gene) n, number of isolates; Ra,
recombination parameter between adjacent sites; Rb, recombination
parameter for entire gene; Rm, minimum number of recombination
events between adjacent sites

UP and Goa parasite populations (Table 1). The positive
value 0.429 for Tajima's D also indicated that positive natural selection at domain I might be the reason for the
increased allelic diversity observed (Table 1). Similar
results were obtained when the McDonald & Kreitman
(MK) test was applied to this data. The MK test showed
more non-synonymous (dN) mutations within species
(dN 36 vs. dS 3) and fixed difference between species (dN
7 vs. dS 4) indicating positive natural selection (Fisher's
exact test P = 0.033, P > 0.01; Neutrality index = 6.85; α =
-5.85).
The minimum number of recombination events (Rm)
between adjacent polymorphic sites for Assam, Orissa, A
& N, UP and Goa isolates were 9, 11, 7, 8 and 6 respectively (Table 2). The value of R (both between adjacent
sites and for the entire domain) was highest in Assam
(0.178 and 81), followed by Orissa (0.118 and 53.7), Goa
(0.0741 and 33.3), A & N (0.0571 and 26), and UP
(0.0165 and 8) parasite population. The higher value of
the recombination parameters (Rm and R) indicate that
high meiotic recombination is taking place between the
sites generating genetic diversity in the gene. As LD index
R^2 plotted against the nucleotide distances also demonstrated a decline across the entire 456 bp region (Figure
3), it can be assumed that intragenic recombination may
be contributing to the increased diversity observed at
AMA1 domain I.

Discussion
Antigenic variation in the natural P. falciparum populations is one of the major obstacles in the development of
an effective vaccine against malaria [1,29]. A vaccine
based on one allelic form of an antigen might not provide
full protective immunity against the heterologous P. falciparum strains, carrying other alleles of that antigen [30].

Therefore, multiple allelic forms of an antigen may need
to be incorporated in a vaccine to make it more efficacious
against any natural P. falciparum infection [13,31]. In this
regard it becomes absolutely essential to investigate the
antigenic repertoires of the P. falciparum populations from
different malaria endemic regions. The complete AMA1
protein is comprised of three distinct domains [32]. This
study includes only domain I as the rate of non-synonymous mutations at this domain has always been found to
be higher due to the phenomenon of positive natural
selection [13-16,28]. A total of 57 AMA1 haplotypes were
observed from 157 P. falciparum isolates studied from five
different regions of India. The H56 and H57 were the predominant haplotypes (Additional File 1). All measures of
genetic polymorphisms showed regional variation among
these five Indian P. falciparum populations (Table 1). The
extent of genetic diversity depends on the malaria transmission intensity and the prevalence of malaria parasite in
that region. The extent of genetic polymorphisms at
domain I was higher amongst the isolates from Assam,
Orissa and A & N as compared to those from UP and Goa
isolates (Figure 1, Table 1). It is important to note that
Assam, Orissa and A & N are considered as high malaria
transmission areas whereas UP and Goa are low malaria
transmission areas of India [33].
Analysis of the AMA1 sequences indicated that the level of
diversity amongst Indian P. falciparum isolates was relatively lower than the reported diversity for African isolates
but was quite similar to the Asian and South American
populations [13,16,28]. A total of 35 AMA1 alleles (with
π diversity 0.027 at domain I) were found when 51 Nigerian P. falciparum isolates were sequenced, while only 18
alleles (with π diversity 0.025 at domain I) were found
when an almost equal number (n = 50) of isolates were
sequenced from Thailand [16,28]. In another study, a
total of 27 AMA1 alleles were found when 168 isolates
(with π diversity 0.026 at domain I) were analysed from
PNG [12]. It is important to note that number of polymorphic AMA1 codons among PNG [12] isolates (29
codons, 168 isolates) were similar to those observed
amongst the Indian isolates (this study, 29 codons, 157
isolates). Although the number of haplotypes among
Indian isolates (H = 57) were greater than those reported
for the PNG isolates (H = 27) however, the π diversity was
higher for PNG (π = 0.026) as compared to Indian isolates
(π = 0.022).
Only 11 of the 57 haplotypes were identical to some of
the AMA1 haplotypes observed in Thai, PNG and Nigerian P. falciparum isolates [12,13,16,28]. The H56 was the
only haplotype which exhibited 100% identity with previously reported AMA1 alleles [AAG50135] from Indian
isolate [13]. On the other hand 46 AMA1 haplotypes have
been reported here for the first time.

A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree depicting the relationships between different AMA1 haplotypes observed among Indian P. falciparum populations. The distance matrix was prepared using Kimura 2-parameter evolutionary model. Alignment substitutions
were considered for analysis while gaps were ignored. Numbers below the line indicate percentage bootstrap values for 1000
replications. The scale bar represents a genetic distance. The partial AMA1 sequence of P. reichenowi [AJ252087], the closet
species to P. falciparum was taken as an out group [35].

Although polymorphisms were observed at 29 of the 152
codons of domain I, majority (17 of 29) of them were
showing dimorphic amino acids which is in accordance
with previous studies [12,13]. Only 5 alternative amino
acid residues (G/D/H/Q/V) were present in the Indian
parasite population at the highly polymorphic codon 197
of domain I as compared to 7 alternative substitutions
reported from elsewhere [34]. A pdb structure of AMA1
using all these codon polymorphisms was also in accordance with previous studies [9]. Thus any vaccine developed using the AMA1 antigen will need to take into
account all these variations observed within the gene.
The overall difference between dN and dS was positive
(dN > dS) suggesting that domain I is under positive natural selection [25]. Similar results were obtained when
Tajima's D and McDonald & Kreitman (MK) test were
applied. Enormous evidence now supports the theory that
the high allelic diversity at domain I is due to strong selection pressure by host immune response [16,17,25,34].
The estimates of inter-population comparisons (Kxy, Dxy,
Da, TM/TS and Fst) supported moderate levels of genetic
differentiation amongst the Indian populations which are
relatively higher than the Fst values between Wosera &
Nigerian (Fst = 0.0133), and Thai & Nigerian (Fst = 0.033)
populations (Table 3) [12,13,28].

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study shows that domain I of
AMA1 among Indian P. falciparum isolates exhibits fairly
high allelic diversity that differs from one region to
another. The regional differences in AMA1 allelic diversity
may pose a problem for a vaccine based on this antigen.
Results obtained in this study also demonstrate that polymorphisms at domain I is due to positive natural selection. Furthermore, moderate level of gene flow was
observed amongst these parasite populations. This data
on AMA1 polymorphism from Indian P. falciparum isolates will be valuable for the development of AMA1-based
malaria vaccine.
