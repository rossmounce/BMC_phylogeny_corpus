Modeling the asymmetric evolution of a mouse
and rat-specific microRNA gene cluster intron 10
of the Sfmbt2 gene

Abstract
Background: The total number of miRNA genes in a genome, expression of which is responsible for the miRNA
repertoire of an organism, is not precisely known. Moreover, the question of how new miRNA genes arise during
evolution is incompletely understood. Recent data in humans and opossum indicate that retrotranspons of the
class of short interspersed nuclear elements have contributed to the growth of microRNA gene clusters.
Method: We studied a large miRNA gene cluster in intron 10 of the mouse Sfmbt2 gene using bioinformatic tools.
Results: Mice and rats are unique to harbor a 55-65 Kb DNA sequence in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene. This
intronic region is rich in regularly repeated B1 retrotransposons together with inverted self-complementary CA/TG
microsatellites. The smallest repeats unit, called MSHORT1 in the mouse, was duplicated 9 times in a tandem headto-tail array to form 2.5 Kb MLONG1 units. The center of the mouse miRNA gene cluster consists of 13 copies of
MLONG1. BLAST analysis of MSHORT1 in the mouse shows that the repeat unit is unique for intron 10 of the
Sfmbt2 gene and suggest a dual phase model for growth of the miRNA gene cluster: arrangment of 10 MSHORT1
units into MLONG1 and further duplication of 13 head-to-tail MLONG1 units in the center of the miRNA gene
cluster. Rats have a similar arrangment of repeat units in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene. The discrepancy between
65 miRNA genes in the mouse cluster as compared to only 1 miRNA gene in the corresponding rat repeat cluster
is ascribed to sequence differences between MSHORT1 and RSHORT1 that result in lateral-shifted, less-stable miRNA
precursor hairpins for RSHORT1.
Conclusion: Our data provides new evidence for the emerging concept that lineage-specific retroposons have
played an important role in the birth of new miRNA genes during evolution. The large difference in the number of
miRNA genes in two closely related species (65 versus 1, mice versus rats) indicates that this species-specific
evolution can be a rapid process.

Background
Micro RNAs (miRNA’s) are 19 to 22 nt long, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that can fine-tune the expression of protein-encoding genes [1,2]. One example is
the post-transcriptional repression of mRNA targets
involving the so called miRNA “seed” which is nt 2-8 of
the mature miRNA which recognizes complementary
bases in the 3’untranslated region of the mRNA target

[3]. miRNA genes form primary transcripts that are converted by Drosha to miRNA precursors of 70-90 nt
length. Processing of miRNA precursors into mature
miRNA’s is catalyzed by the RNA processing enzyme
Dicer [4,5]. Processing enzymes recognize the secondary
hairpin-structure of the miRNA precursor [6]. Most
miRNA precursors have indeed a distinctive stem-loop
structure that is often highly conserved among distant
species and that is used to distinguish them from other
small RNA classes.
The exact number of miRNA genes, collective expression of which makes the miRNA repertoire of an

organism, is not known and the question how new
miRNA genes arise is an interesting and insufficiently studied problem in evolutionary biology. The conserved hairpin structure in miRNA precursors was applied in two
primary miRNA identification methods: directional cloning and computational identification [7,8]. Consequently,
newly evolved, not-conserved miRNAs were likely to be
overlooked by these methods. Furthermore, some miRNA
gene candidates accumulated sequence mutations that,
over time, either led to mature miRNA genes or to gene
inactivation [9]. Both actions make it difficult today to
trace back the origin of miRNA genes. Using a deep
sequencing approach, a large group of evolutionarily
young miRNA genes was discovered in Drosophila [9]. In
this study, a high birth rate of new miRNA genes was
described (12 new miRNA genes per million years). The
main sources for gaining miRNA genes in plants are based
on miRNA gene duplication events and local inverted
duplication events of short segments from protein-coding
genes [10]. An alternative source of short inverted
sequence segments could be based on transposons as
these often carry terminal inverted repeats or as they can
insert at short distance from their origin, resulting in an
inverted gene arrangement [11]. The involvement of transposons in the birth of clusters of miRNA genes might be
underestimated as computational miRNA detection methods were designed to exclude transposon sequences [8].
However, recent analyses in several mammalian species
[8,12,13] indicated that a number of miRNA gene clusters
were derived from repetitive elements. This may have contributed to “leaps” in the expansion of the miRNA repertoire in placental mammals [14].
Approximately, 40% of the mouse genome is composed of repetitive elements, the largest part of which is
interspersed between or within genes. Two examples are
simple repeats and B1 elements (short interspersed
nuclear elements (SINE), an Alu-like family of retrotransposons in rodents). Each occupies a similar fraction of
the mouse genome (2.3% vs. 2.7%) [15]. Mouse B1 elements are rodent-specific retrotransposons (length
approximately 140-bp) that may have originated from
reverse transcription of ancestral 7SL RNA [16]. Transposable elements like B1 in mice and Alu in humans
were previously thought to be either harmless “junk” or
to influence functional genes negatively [17]. More
recently, however, it was proposed that retrotransposons
can actually contribute to gene function and genome
evolution, either by promoting local duplications, inversions or deletions events or by altering gene expression
[18,19]. Simple repeats are present in micro- and, minisatellites which are short tandem repeats of one repetitive
unit [20] with a characteristic length and sequence. For
instance, in microsatellites, the repeat unit is 1 to 6 bp
long. It has been shown that microsatellites are

Page 2 of 11

characterized by a high sequence mutation rate (10-6 to
10-2 per bp per generation) [21]. This makes microsatellites an adaptable reservoir for genetic changes, in addition to the phenomenon that numerous host genes
evolved from retrotransposons [22,23].
A number of recent findings suggest that the biology of
miRNA’s and of retrotransposons may be connected at
several levels. One starting point is the idea that RNA
interference is a mechanism that protects genomes against
an unacceptably high, self-destructive retrotransposon
activity [24,25]. Interestingly, the RNA interference pathway and the maturation and action of miRNAs share
some processing proteins and both mediate endonucleolytic cleavage [26-28]. Furthermore, the evolutionary growth
of an Alu-rich primate miRNA cluster [29] and a marsupial miRNA cluster [30] were proposed to be driven by
local duplication events involving retrotransposons. For
the miRNA genes in the human chromosome 19 cluster,
the encoded seed sequence was found to be complementary to the most conserved parts of Alu RNA [29].
In the present study we have analyzed the sequence of
a large miRNA cluster which is specifically located in
intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene on chromosome 2 of the
mouse (from now on abbreviated as C2MC). This cluster is very rich in B1 retrotransposons and microsatellites, which are ordered in a regular manner. In rats the
same repeat elements are present, but small changes in
DNA sequence may have resulted in less-stable hairpins
and failure to form mature miRNA from precursors. In
all other mammals an ortholog of C2MC could not be
detected. On basis of this analysis we propose that B1
retrotransposons have contributed to rapid growth of
the mouse C2MC miRNA cluster, which further illustrates the connection between retrotransposition and
the evolution of a miRNA repertoire in mammals.

Results
1. Large mouse-specific miRNA gene cluster in intron 10
of the Sfmbt2 gene

During our search for mammalian miRNA gene clusters
in which SINE repeats may have contributed to cluster
growth [29] our attention was drawn to C2MC, a large
group of miRNA genes on chromosome 2 of the mouse.
This cluster is located in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene
and spans more than 50 Kb (Figure 1A). The C2MC
cluster is predicted to contain 65 miRNA genes which
are annotated by UCSC and which are present in miRBase. Each miRNA gene in the cluster is encoded by the
(+) strand, i.e. parallel to the coding strand of the
Sfmbt2 gene. The C2MC cluster was found to be specifically present in the mouse when considering orthologs
or paralogs of the Sfmbt2 gene. First, in or immediately
around the paralogous mouse Sfmbt1 gene, no miRNA
genes were found (Additional File 1 Figure S1A).

Figure 1 C2MC is a large miRNA cluster in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene. Overview of the mouse Polycomb group gene Sfmbt2 is shown
using the mouse UCSC genome browser (Version mm9 - http://genome.ucsc.edu). A) All miRNA genes are present inside a ~54 Kb region of
Sfmbt2 intron 10, which is not conserved in other mammals except to some extent for rat (Chr2: 10,285,001-10,525,000). B) The cluster contains
65 miRNA genes and is flanked by conserved parts of intron 10 (Chr2: 10,385,001-10,441,000). C) The centrally located miRNA genes appear
evenly spaced. The cluster’s compartmentalized organization is indicated by multiple mappings of RefSeq Genes and by its repeating element
content (Chr2: 10,418,831-10,424,030).

Second, no miRNA genes associated with the Sfmbt2 gene
were found in any other species, except for the rat where
one miRNA gene was found in intron 10 (Additional File
1 Figure S1B). In fact, we noticed that in the total 300 Kb
area of the mouse Sfmbt2 locus, sequence homology to
other mammals (including rat) was lowest with the mouse
intron 10 region (Figure 1A). Low sequence homology was
also found with between mouse Sfmbt2 intron 10 and the
same region in genomes of rabbit, ground squirrel, guinea
pig and kangaroo rat (Additional File 2 Table S1). As can
be seen in Additional File 1 Figure S1B, the rat orthologous intron 10 region on chromosome 17 is of the same
size as in the mouse (about 60 Kb) and has a high density
of simple repeats and SINE elements. Repeats are also
clustered in intron 10 of the mouse (Additional File 1 Figure S1C). When we looked in further detail in the central
region of intron 10 of the mouse (Figure 1C) we found a
regular spacing of miRNA genes, simple repeats and SINE
repeats with an apparent repeat length of 2.5 Kb and we
propose to call this repeat unit MLONG1. A tandem array
of 13 MLONG1 elements is sufficient to account for all
miRNA genes in the center of the C2MC cluster (Figure
2). The SINE repeats of the mouse Sfmbt2 intron 10 are
all classified as B1, which belong to the Alu family. The B1
elements in MLONG1 are more frequent, significantly
smaller and more uniform in orientation than B1 elements
in the collected set of all other introns of mouse chromosome 2 (Additional File 1 Figure S2). We next investigated
the exact composition of the 2.5 KB repeat unit MLONG1.
2. Tandem repeats of MSHORT1 explain the cluster of
miRNA genes in the Sfmbt2 gene

BLAST analysis of MLONG1 indicated that this repeat
was in itself a composite unit, built by a tandem

A

B1F3

array of ten MSHORT1 elements (Additional File 1
Figure S3A). The MSHORT1 consensus sequence (296
nt) aligned to 193 individual MSHORT1 copies (Additional File 2 Table S2) that form a tandemly head-to-tail
array in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene and together
account for >90% of the intronic space. A more detailed
view of the MSHORT1 element consensus (Figure 2A)
suggested that the first 75 nucleotides are a 3’ fragment
of the rodent B1F3 element, while the middle part (83
nt) was homologous to the pre-miRNA gene consensus
which overlapped with two self-complementary microsatellites. The tandem repeat of MSHORT1 elements
could account for all 65 pre-miRNA genes that are
annotated in the cluster. When clustering ten
MSHORT1 elements into a MLONG1 element, loss of
sequence and accumulation of mutations may explain
why only three pre-mRNA genes and up to seven B1F3
fragments are recognized by BLAST (Figure 2B). A similar situation exists in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene of
the rat. In this species, a 197 nt RSHORT1 consensus
was found that aligns to 236 copies which are also tandemly repeated (Additional File 1 Figure S3B, Additional
File 2 Table S3). The MSHORT1 and RSHORT1 consensus elements were found to be homologous to each
other (Additional File 1 Figure S3C), but MSHORT was
extended by 0.1 Kb at its 3’ end.
3. The mouse-specific miRNA gene cluster expanded in
two phases

We next constructed the phylogeny the individual
MSHORT1 elements in order to model the evolutionary growth of C2MC. BLAST analysis allowed the
identification of 9 MSHORT1 sub-clusters each of
which containing 12 or 13 copies of highly similar

Figure 2 Modular repeat composition of C2MC. A) The basic repeat in C2MC is MSHORT1: this is a 296 nt unit, which contains a 75 nt 3’
portion of a rodent B1F3 element and a ~83 nt pre-miRNA gene consensus, which overlapped with an annotation of two self-complementary
microsatellites. B) An array of ten MSHORT1 copies (C1 to C10) forms a 2,5 Kb unit called MLONG1, which contains 3 miRNA genes (red) and 6
B1F3 elements (green). C) The center of C2MC is generated by tandem duplication of MLONG1 elements; the flanks of C2MC contain less
regularly spaced MSHORT1 units (pink).

tandemly repeated in the center of C2MC (Figure 2
and 3B). Similar observations were made for rat
RSHORT1 copies. However, the rat cluster central
region has a less stringent fixation of RSHORT1 copies
in longer units that would represent the rat equivalent
to mouse MLONG1 (Additional File 1 Figure S4).
These results suggest that, during the most recent
expansion of the mouse miRNA gene cluster, which
occurred in the C2MC central region, an array of tandem repeated MSHORT1 copies, fixed as MLONG1,
was duplicated 12 times.

colors in Figure 3A). MSHORT1 elements that could
not be sub-clustered (white in Figure 3A), were more
distant from each other, as were MSHORT1 elements
compared across sub-clusters. All sub-clustered
MSHORT1 copies were found to be located in the
center of C2MC (Figure 2 and 3B), while the
MSHORT1 elements that could not be sub-clustered
were specifically present in the C2MC flanks. The regularly ordered arrangement of MSHORT1 units could
be modeled by the formation of MLONG1, which is

Figure 3 Evolutionary relationship of the MSHORT1 elements in C2MC. A) The phylogenetic tree of all 193 MSHORT1 elements that are
present in C2MC is shown. MSHORT1 copies are numbered from left to right for their location in C2MC. When a miRNA gene is present in the
MSHORT, it is indicated as well. MSHORT1 copies in the central region of C2MC (see Figure 2C) are colored, while the MSHORT1 copies in two
C2MC flanks are white. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of
replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. The scale bar represents 5% of sequence
divergence. B) The sequential order of MSHORT1 copies is highlighted. The MSHORT1 units that belong to the same sub-cluster are listed in
columns. Rows show the arrangement of MSHORT1 units in the corresponding MLONG1 copies. Please note that the first 31 MSHORT1 copies
are located in the left flank of C2MC (Figure 2C), while copies 146-193 are in the right flank.

to miRNA families 466 and 467. A hallmark of miRNAs
embedded in MSHORT1 and RSHORT1 is that the
hairpin precursors overlap with two self-complementary
microsatellites (AC)n and (GT)n, which might have
shaped an ancestral hairpin. miRNAs of families 466
and 467 are not exclusively found within C2MC, but
also on other mouse chromosomes and in other species
than mouse and rat. However, BLAST analysis of other
genomes (human, chicken, D. melanogaster, C. elegans)
for MSHORT1 retrieved no results while in mouse and
rat gave only results within intron 10 of the Sfmbt2
gene. To analyze the relationship between the members
of the miRNA families 466 and 467 in detail, we
selected the 10 pre-miRNAs of these two families that
are located in other species and outside C2MC. We
added 100nt up- and downstream sequence to evaluate
cross-species conservation and compared the sequences
to MSHORT1 and RSHORT1. All analyzed pre-miRNA
sequences of the other species contained microsatellites
resembling a (AT)n repeat instead of a (AC)n or (GT)n
repeats as found in the C2MC miRNA genes. An exception might be the sequence containing has-mir-466 with
(TATG)n and (CA)n microsatellites (Additional File 2
Table S4A). We also assessed the impact of the microsatellite-related miRNA-stem on miRNA family classification by pairwise alignments. The consensus sequence of
MSHORT1 and RSHORT1 was included in the analysis
to represent the C2MC miRNA genes. With an exception from MSHORT1/RSHORT1 and sequences of
miRNA-1277, no sequence similarity was detected any
other miRNA precursor sequence when the microsatellite content was masked (Additional File 2 Table S4B).
Therefore, it is likely that miRNA genes in MSHORT1
and RSHORT1 have originated independently from all
other miRNAs that are classified within miRNA gene
families 466 and 467.
5. Secondary structure predicts a more stable hairpin in
MSHORT1 than in RSHORT1

The next point we addressed was the paradox that,
although intron 10 of the rat and mouse genes contain
mainly copies of SHORT1 including self-complementary microsatellites, the mouse has 65 miRNA-producing genes in this region, while the rat only has one
gene that expresses Mir-466d. A possible explanation
could be the stability of the secondary structures,
which are considered relevant for pre-miRNA processing by Drosha and Dicer [31,32]. To address this
point, we predicted the secondary mRNA structures
from the rat and mouse SHORT1 consensus sequence
(Figure 4A). The analysis was done using three

Page 6 of 11

structure prediction methods (minimal free energy
structure, equilibrium base-pairing probabilities and
centroid structure (Additional File 1 Figure S5)). For
mouse and rat, a 41 nt double stranded hairpin was
found that coincided with the predicted pre-miRNA
sequence in the mouse. A major difference, however,
was found in the entropy of the hairpin region, which
was much lower as compared to immediate surroundings in the mouse than in the rat (Figure 4B). When
we repeated the analysis without the extra 0.1 Kb at
the 3’ end of MSHORT1, a similar result was obtained
as compared to full length MSHORT1 (data not
shown). Therefore, we found a comparable overall
stem-loop structure, but more pronounced differences
in entropy in the region demarcating the 82-83 nt
hairpin structure in the mouse MSHORT1. A detailed
view on the RSHORT1 hairpin showed that next to
point mutations, two deletions of two nucleotides
caused a shift in the hairpin structure. For example, in
RSHORT1 nt 125 does not pair to nt 140, as seen in
MSHORT1, but to nt 150 (Figure 4C). Consequently,
the RSHORT1 hairpin does not resemble the premiRNA structures of this miRNA cluster as closely as
MSHORT1 does. Our results support the idea that
both low entropy and structural resemblance is relevant for the pre-miRNA processing in the mouse.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the repeat elements of C2MC,
a mouse specific miRNA cluster in a large intron of a
protein-encoding gene. The encoded protein SFMBT2
(Scm-like with four mbt domains 2) belongs to the polycomb protein family which is implicated in embryonic
development [33]. Interestingly, the Sfmbt2-gene is
imprinted and primarily expressed from the paternal
allele in early embryos [34]. This makes another example of a large cluster of non-coding small RNA genes in
regions of imprinted DNA [35,36]. In the analysis we
performed in this paper, evidence was found for the
idea that B1 transposons together with two self-complementary microsatellites, have generated a miRNA-containing cassette that has duplicated many times during a
relatively short time of evolution. This idea fits well into
an emerging concept that retroposon-driven local
expansion of miRNA clusters can contribute to the
miRNA repertoire of mammals [37,38]. In our analysis,
the smallest repeat unit bearing one miRNA gene
(MSHORT1) is composed of a 3’ fragment of a B1F3
element, two microsatellites and additional sequence
(Figure 2). The two microsatellites overlap with the
miRNA gene of MSHORT1 and could have created a
stable hairpin due to base pair complementarity. Perfect
hairpins were proposed to be a source of de-novo generated plant miRNAs [10].

MSHORT1 is based on minimal free energy. The colors represent the positional entropy from low (red) to high (blue). The hairpin that forms
pre-miRNAs of some MSHORT1 copies is indicated. B) Positional entropy is shown for the corresponding positions of the secondary structure.
The pre-miRNA corresponding region is highlighted in white. C) &D) Same representation for the secondary structure of RSHORT1 (rats). Please
note the region that potentially forms a pre-miRNA in MSHORT1 is more stable as compared to the corresponding region in RSHORT1. E)
Detailed view of the predicted miRNA containing hairpin structures of MSHORT1 and RSHORT1. The two arms of the RSHORT1 hairpin contain a
different number of nucleotides (left arm vs. right arm), while the number of nucleotides is equal in the two arms of the MSHORT1 hairpin.
Energy rich, asymmetric bulges in the hairpin-stem of RSHORT1 result from an imbalance in hairpin arm length. In MSHORT1, intramolecular base
pairing occurred between nt 125 and nt 140 (pink), while in RSHORT1 nt 125 pairs to nt 150. Sequence coordinates correspond to the pairwise
alignment of the two sequences. The asterisk marks sites of deletion of two nucleotides in RSHORT1 compared to MSHORT1 (adapted from [32]).

One can argue about the point whether or not the
encoded small non-coding RNAs in C2MC are “real”
miRNA’s. In general, miRNA’s are defined by a combination of five criteria for both expression and biogenesis
(for review see [39]). Previous work has indicated that
the miRNAs of C2MC fulfill three of these criteria
[40-42]: (i) detection of a distinct expressed mature ~22

nt RNA transcript; (ii) the identification of its precise
genomic match; (iii) the dependence on Dicer for
miRNA production [39]. What is lacking for the C2MC
mRNA’s is phylogenetic conservation of the ~22 nt
miRNA sequence and its predicted fold-back precursor
[39]. Phylogenetic conservation may be exist, however as
suggested by other miRNAs that are classified together

Lehnert et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:257
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/257

with C2MC miRNA’s into families 466 and 467) [43].
But one should be cautious about this as, we found that
this family classification does largely depend on the
microsatellite related origin of these miRNAs. While
miRNAs of C2MC do contain a combination of (TG)n
and (CA)n microsatellite, the other species’ miRNAs
grouped in these miRNA families generally involve a
(TA)n microsatellite (Additional File 2 Table S4).
Indeed, when we analyzed a 300 nt sequence with the
microsatellite content masked, the miRNA genes of
C2MC showed no sequence similarity to other miRNAs
the 466 and 467 families. Therefore, the miRNAs of
C2MC might have a different origin, and should perhaps
be grouped in a separate miRNA family. An interesting
detail is that mouse miRNAs of families 466 and 467
that do not belong to C2MC could not be confirmed in
an experimental miRNA evaluation approach [42]. The
last criterion for miRNA evaluation describes structural
requirements for a hairpin precursor that contains the
~22 nt miRNA sequence. In this criterion, the hairpin
must be the folding alternative with the lowest free
energy and should not contain large internal loops or
bulges, particularly not asymmetric bulges [39]. We
have arguments that the small RNA’s from C2MC are
different from piRNAs (Piwi protein-associated small
RNA’s). First, piRNA gene clusters are present in intergenetic regions [44], while the small RNA’s in C2MC
are encoded in an intron of a protein-encoding gene.
Second, the mature small RNAs of C2MC have a length
of 22 nt, which is characteristic of miRNAs, and smaller
as the length of piRNAs (24 nt to 31 nt) [45,46].
Differences between MSHORT1 and RSHORT1
should explain why the mouse miRNA cluster C2MC
contains more miRNAs than its rat counterpart. In comparison to MSHORT1, the right arm of the RSHORT1
hairpin shifted laterally by 10 nt and gained 3 asymmetrical bulges, while MSHORT1 had none (Figure 4E).
An energy profile of primary miRNA transcripts is
described for humans. There, the region of the lower
hairpin stem towards the basal segments and the upper
stem close to the Drosha cleavage site were identified as
thermodynamic most stable [31]. This energy profile is
accentuated by the entropy profiles of MSHORT1, but it
is less consistent with the profile of RSHORT1 (Figure
4). Further, sequences flanking the hairpins were
described as essential for efficient in vitro processing
[4,47]. However, RSHORT1 lacks this sequence on its 5
prime side (Additional File 1 Figure S3C). Together
these differences might explain the low number of genes
producing mature miRNAs in the rat cluster.
The results of BLAST analysis of MSHORT1 suggests a
model for the evolution of C2MC (Figure 5). SHORT1
copies accumulated via a recombination-based mechanism
in the common rodent ancestor of today’s mice and rats

Page 8 of 11

(Figure 5A). These ancestral SHORT1 units may have
been more similar to MSHORT1 than to RSHORT1. In
fact, some repeat units in the cluster of modern rats
resemble MSHORT1 instead of RSHORT1, while all
repeat units in modern mice only resemble MSHORT1
(Additional File 2 Table S2 and S3). Thus, a truncation
event resulting in the ~200nt RSHORT1 occurred in the
rat after the speciation of mice and rats. We speculate that
single nucleotide mutations and small deletion events in
10 neighboring MSHORT1 units, caused the formation of
one larger unit MLONG1 (Figure 5B). MLONG1 was
further multiplied in the C2MC center. This model is
similar to what we proposed before in primates (27). In
the mouse the individual miRNAs of C2MC have been
duplicated together with a B1F3 retrotransposon.
What could be the biological implication of the
growth of the C2MC miRNA gene cluster? One possibility is that such growth contributes to the well known
expansion of a miRNA gene repertoire in mammals
[14]. In order to regulate a great diversity of mRNA targets, a repertoire of “seeds” is needed. This requires a
large set of miRNA genes. Local duplication events of
miRNA genes in clusters are, therefore, to some extent
analogous to a repertoire of variable immunoglobulin,
T-cell receptor and Trypanosome variable surface glycoprotein genes [48-50]. A problem with this explanation
is that the growth of the C2MC cluster has not yet generated new “seeds’” to regulate novel mRNA targets: the
miRNAs from C2MC share the “seed” region within a
group of five distinct miRNA clusters, present in mouse,
human and zebra fish [51]. On the other hand, the
miRNA genes may be evolutionary young and since they
overlap with microsatellites, rapid evolution of the
“seed” sequences may still occur. Another possibility of
gene duplication is a dosage effect of miRNA’s with the
same seed. This is particularly interesting for imprinted
genes such as Sfmbt2. More research is needed to evaluate the impact of miRNA concentration generated by
the miRNA genes in C2MC and to compare this action
with that other amplified miRNA clusters, e.g. on chromosome 19 in primates.

Conclusion
In summary, we analyzed C2MC, a large mouse miRNA
cluster that expanded during the time since mice and
rats diverged from each other. Our data indicate that a
B1F3 retrotransposon has contributed to the generation
of a tandemly repeated unit MSHORT1, which grouped
into the 2.5 KB MLONG1 element. The latter led to
rapid growth in the center of the cluster by further
duplication events. Our study indicates that C2MC is a
new example of the phenomenon in which lineage-specific SINE elements contribute to growth of the miRNA
gene repertoire in a particular species.

Figure 5 Dual growth phase model of miRNA gene cluster in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene. A) During the first extension phase of the
cluster in the last common ancestor of mouse and rat a 0.3 kb SHORT1 (yellow box) was copied by gene conversion. Ancestral SHORT1
contains the self-complementary microsatellite which may (mice) or may not (rats) evolve to miRNA genes (red arrow); this sequence is
preceded by the 3’ half of a B1F3-SINE (green arrow). A B1F3 full-length copy marks the 3’ borders of both examined clusters. The initial unit
diverged into MSHORT1 (0.3 kb) and RSHORT1 (0.2 kb), which are both detected in rat, while only MSHORT1 is found in mouse. B) Diversification
of MSHORT1 in mouse caused a fixation of ten adjacent elements in the head-to-tail arrangement to create one 2.5 kb MLONG1 element (gray
arrow), which was further amplified. Fixation involved sequence loss (dashed area) and mutation based element alienation beyond recognition
of B1F3-elements and microsatellites (white arrow).

Methods
Selection of pre-miRNAs with 3’ and 5’ flanking sequence

MicroRNA precursor coordinates were selected from
the Sanger miRNA Registry database (version 16.0). All
pre-miRNA sequences of miRNA family 466 and 467
were extracted with adjacent 100nt at the 5’ and 3’ borders, in those cases where the pre-miRNAs were not in
present within the mouse and rat miRNA cluster. The
sequences were selected from the mouse (release mm9),
rat genome (release rn4), chicken (release galGal4),
human (release hg19), pig (release susScr2) and orangutan (release ponAbe2) from the UCSC genome browser
http://genome.ucsc.edu/. The microsatellite content of
these sequences was masked with RepeatMasker using
the “mask only complex/simple repeats” option.
Generation of multiple and pairwise alignments

Multiple alignments were calculated with ClustalX version 2.0.10 (ftp.embl-heidelberg.de) using the IUB DNA
weight matrix with the following variables: gap opening

10, gap extension 0.2, delay divergent sequence 30%,
DNA transition weight -0.5 and no negative matrix. The
alignments were generated from the mouse MSHORT1
copies and rat MSHORT1 RSHORT1 copies (Additional
File 1 Figures S3, S4). Multiple alignments were edited
with the SEAVIEW program [52] and used in the phylogenetic analyses. Pairwise alignments were calculated
with maln http://www.girinst.org for miRNA precursors
with 100nt 5’ and 3’ sequence of miRNA family 466 and
467 that are not located in this miRNA cluster of mouse
and rat.
Generation of the consensus sequences MSHORT1 and
RSHORT1

The selection of initial sequences was guided by the regular spaced miRNA genes (Figure 1C). The selection
was limited to 4 Kb in order to minimize overlap with
down or upstream positioned regular spaced set of 3 or
2 miRNA genes. Multiple alignment was calculated
from these sequences with ClustalX version 2.0.10 (ftp.

Lehnert et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:257
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/257

embl-heidelberg.de) using the IUB DNA weight matrix.
A similarity graph was used to access the quality of the
multiple alignment and to define a primary consensus
sequence. “Similarity” is a method distributed with the
VectorNTI suite from Invitrogen http://www.invitrogen.
com/vectornti. This consensus sequence was used to
identify MSHORT1 and RSHORT1. A series of Censor
[53] analyses were applied to sharpen consensus boundaries of these 2 consensus sequences. The quality of
Censor identified sequences was controlled in pairwise
comparisons calculated with maln http://www.girinst.
org, before including the sequences in the next analysis
cycle. The B1F3 element was identified with Censor.
The B1F3 element was probably an ancestral B1 element
that gave birth to the ID_B1 family by fusion with a
tRNA-like ID element (Kapitonov and Jurka, submitted
to Repbase Reports as the B1F3 family consensus
sequence). The mouse and rat Sfmbt2 intron 10 composition of MSHORT1, RSHORT1 and B1F3 elements is
summarized in Additional File 2 Table S2 and S3. Censor was also used to analyze the entire genomes of
Mouse, rat, human, chicken, D. melanogaster, C. elegans
for MSHORT1 copies. Further, the sequence of
MLONG1, which was indicated by the phylogenetic
clustering of MSHORT1 copies, was verified with Censor (Figure 2A).
Phylogenetic trees and graphical visualization of repeat
elements and miRNAs features on selected sequences

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [54]
using a Neighbor-Joining method with a pair-wise deletion model [1]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred
from 1000 replicates [2]. The percentage of replicate
trees in which the associated taxa clustered together was
calculated with the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) [2].
The evolutionary distances were computed using the
Maximum Composite Likelihood method [3] and are in
units of the number of base substitutions per site. All
positions containing alignment gaps and missing data
were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons
(pairwise deletion option). Secondary structure predictions were performed with the Vienna RNA web suite
[32]. Repeat features were selected from the mouse
(release mm9) and rat genome (release rn4; http://genome.ucsc.edu/). miRNA features were extracted from
the Sanger miRNA Registry (version 15.0). Perl was
used to generate customized Genbank formatted feature
files, which were subsequently used to generate graphs
visualizing exact positions and length of the features on
each sequence. Graphical prints of the sequences were
generated with the DNAPlotter [55] and Vector NTI
11.0 http://www.invitrogen.com/vectornti.
