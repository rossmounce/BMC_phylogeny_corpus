Abstract
Background: There is little information about the DNA sequence variation within and between
closely related plant species. The combination of re-sequencing technologies, large-scale DNA
pools and availability of reference gene sequences allowed the extensive characterisation of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of four biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation
of ecologically relevant secondary metabolites in Eucalyptus. With this approach the occurrence and
patterns of SNP variation for a set of genes can be compared across different species from the same
genus.
Results: In a single GS-FLX run, we sequenced over 103 Mbp and assembled them to
approximately 50 kbp of reference sequences. An average sequencing depth of 315 reads per
nucleotide site was achieved for all four eucalypt species, Eucalyptus globulus, E. nitens, E.
camaldulensis and E. loxophleba. We sequenced 23 genes from 1,764 individuals and discovered
8,631 SNPs across the species, with about 1.5 times as many SNPs per kbp in the introns compared
to exons. The exons of the two closely related species (E. globulus and E. nitens) had similar numbers
of SNPs at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. These species also had similar levels of SNP
diversity, whereas E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba had much higher SNP diversity. Neither the
pathway nor the position in the pathway influenced gene diversity. The four species share between
20 and 43% of the SNPs in these genes.
Conclusion: By using conservative statistical detection methods, we were confident about the
validity of each SNP. With numerous individuals sampled over the geographical range of each
species, we discovered one SNP in every 33 bp for E. nitens and one in every 31 bp in E. globulus.
In contrast, the more distantly related species contained more SNPs: one in every 16 bp for E.
camaldulensis and one in 17 bp for E. loxophleba, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest
frequency of SNPs described in woody plant species.

Background

pathway [7]. In eucalypts, we are interested in the terpenoid and flavonoid pathways, because they produce compounds that are important in the plants' response to stress
and herbivory. Furthermore, these pathways are well
defined in several plant species [17-21], but there have
been no genetic studies of the genes in these pathways in
eucalypts.

The genome sequence is known for a limited number of
plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa,
Vitis vinifera and Populus trichocarpa [1-5]. In a few plant
species, levels of polymorphism in DNA sequences have
been estimated using large genome data sets [6-8]. Further, in a study of A. thaliana, 20 accession lines were studied to determine SNP variation at genome-wide level [9].
There are two limitations to estimating complete DNA
sequence variation in a species. First, it requires comprehensive sampling of individuals, which is costly and time
consuming. Second, it demands the most modern technology. Next generation sequencing (NGS) provides
opportunities for cost-effective sequencing of massive
amounts of DNA. The relatively new method of parallel
pyrosequencing developed by 454 Life Sciences has
quickly improved in the number of reads and read length.
Two studies recently used these technologies to test fidelity of sequence variants from pooled DNA comprising
DNA from several individuals [10,11]. Both studies
proved that with adequate depth of sequence coverage it
was possible to detect and estimate the frequencies of
SNPs. Such an approach has been used to identify many
SNPs in domestic pigs (Sus domestica Linn.) [12], rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta, Zimmermann) [13], whole
genome comparisons of bacteria (Salmonella (Salmonella
spp.) [14], and from seven families of Eucalyptus grandis,
Hill [15].

Results

Missing from plant biology are large comparative studies
of genomes from closely related plant species [16]. Soon
it will be easy to sequence and thus compare closely
related genomes, for example from relatives of Arabidopsis
or rice. In other sets of closely related species, for which
there is no genome sequence, total sequence diversity at a
set of orthologous genes can be compared. Simultaneously, with the use of genes in defined biosynthetic pathways, associations between levels of SNP variation and the
position of the genes in the pathway can be examined and
also comparisons made of the levels of gene diversity
between pathways. For instance, in A. thaliana there was
no association between variation and position in the
pathway for a set of genes from the phenylpropanoid

Pooled samples from individuals collected across the
geographic range of four Eucalyptus species
For comprehensive characterisation of SNP variation
within an outcrossing plant species, sampling must
include a large number of individuals from populations
covering the geographic range. The samples used in this
study cover the complete natural geographic range of four
Eucalyptus species (Table 1). E. globulus and E. nitens are
represented by 46 and 28 populations, respectively
whereas for E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba a total of 93
and 29 populations were sampled [22,25,26]. With the
combination of large numbers of populations and individuals for each species, we were confident of discovering
all common alleles and the majority of rare alleles for the
genes of interest. Since a bulk sample of pooled individu-

The four Eucalyptus species used in this study all belong to
the subgenus Symphyomyrtus. The two major commercial
species, E. globulus and E. nitens, are closely related and
belong to the same series (Globulares) and section (Maidenaria). The other two, E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba,
are in different sections, Exsertaria and Bisectae, respectively [22]. There is uncertainty about the dates of divergence of lineages within the subgenus Symphyomyrtus but
E. globulus and E. nitens probably diverged 5 - 10 million
years ago, while the more distantly related E. loxophleba
might have diverged between 20 - 40 million years ago
[23,24]. All are important species for wood and pulp production or are planted widely to ameliorate salinity.
We sequenced 23 genes from the gDNA of 1,764 individuals of four different Eucalyptus species allowing us to
characterise the SNPs in these genes and to compare their
patterns of occurrence among species.

als was used for each species, it was important that the
sequences sampled from the pool were a random selection of those from all individuals. Most of the 12 individuals from each of the four species tested for the 57 primer
pairs gave single PCR products of correct size with no
apparent bias in success rate over the geographic range
(data not shown). For the 96 individuals of E. globulus, an
average of 94 (98%) gave a single PCR product from each
of the 17 amplicons tested (data not shown). These data
suggest that the primers work equally well for all samples.
Genes of the terpenoid and flavonoid pathway
We used EST sequences from public libraries to design
specific primers for 37 genes. The primers were used to
amplify E. globulus gDNA and the genes were sequenced
with the traditional Sanger method. These sequences
served as the reference sequences for later assembling the
sequences, which were obtained from the 454 pyrosequencing data. Table 2 shows the 23 genes for which SNPs
were obtained in our re-sequencing study. When multiple
genes of a gene family were included the genes are numbered sequentially (1, 2, etc.). Nine of the Eucalyptus gene
sequences covered the entire corresponding Arabidopsis

gene. The structure of the reference sequences, in terms of
the number of exons and introns, was similar to that in
model plant species. The exons of the eucalypt genes were
similar in size to those in Arabidopsis, but the size of the
eucalypt introns varied widely from Arabidopsis. The
introns were mostly larger in eucalypts compared to Arabidopsis. At the translated amino acid level the reference
sequences of E. globulus were on average 75%identical to
those in Arabidopsis (Table 2).
Pyrosequencing and reference assembly
The separate barcodes for each of the four Eucalyptus species successfully enabled separation of the DNA sequences
by species after the completion of the 454 sequencing. The
data then consisted of 473,182 sequences with an average
length of 219 bp, giving 103.6 Mbp of sequence (Table 3).
Of these, we could align 81% to our reference sequences,
while only 1% of the sequences represented contamination (chloroplastic-, mitochondrial-, and human- DNA).
Three genes were discarded because they had too few
reads aligned to the reference sequences. The remaining
18% of the sequences could be assembled into contigs
belonging to members of large gene families, such as the

terpene-, chalcone- and squalene- synthase families. Some
genes within these families are highly conserved in the
coding regions and can be distinguished only in the more
diverse introns. Primers were required that would amplify
genes from different species and populations, so we
selected conserved regions in the exons for primer design.
However, as a result, some primer pairs amplified genes
from multiple loci. These genes were not used for our SNP
analysis since our focus was the discovery of discrete single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association
studies. Hence the number of genes analysed was reduced
from 37 to 23. The average read length was the same
across species. The number of reads and total length of
sequence varied substantially among species with the figures for E. globulus about two-thirds of those for E.
loxophleba (Table 3), which may have been due to unequal
amounts of DNA used in the barcoding or pyrosequencing process. These estimates do not appear to relate to the
detection rates of SNPs (Table 4).
SNP detection and analysis
A total of 8,631 SNPs were detected in the four eucalypt
species. Of these, 2,825 were common and 5,806 were
rare SNPs (Table 4). The use of pooled DNA precluded the

derivation of haplotypes of individuals and meant that we
could not make nucleotide diversity estimates. Two species, E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba, had approximately
twice as many SNPs as the other two species (Table 4).
Common SNPs that lead to changes in the amino acid
(exons, common non-synonymous) were fewest, while
rare SNPs in introns were most frequent. The proportion
of common SNPs that were non-synonymous ranged
from 32% in E. nitens to 46% in E. globulus. The proportion of SNP sites in the exons that are non-synonymous is
high (ca 50%) in both E. globulus and E. nitens but slightly
less (ca 43%) in the other two species. Table 5 shows the
number of SNPs per 1,000 bp of data, categorised according to rate of occurrence, synonymity and position (exons
or introns), allowing a better comparison of the SNP frequencies among species. Eucalyptus nitens has the lowest
frequency of common SNPs in the exons and of all SNPs
in the introns, while E. globulus has the lowest frequency
of rare SNPs in the exons (Table 5). The other species
share the highest SNP frequencies, with E. loxophleba being
highest in two categories (exons, common synonymous
and introns, common) and E. camaldulensis being highest
in four. The ratio of SNPs in the introns to those in the
exons was higher in E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba than

in E. camaldulensis and E. loxophleba. The gene with the
lowest SNP frequency (across all species) was anthocyanidin synthase (ans) followed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (ggpps) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase

thase (chs) and mevalonate diphospate decarboxylase
(pmd). The SNP diversity in the exons of mvk is at least
twice that of the exons in pmd.
SNP frequencies across the different pathways
Genes at a bottleneck position of a pathway may be under
stronger selective pressure and may therefore have fewer
SNPs than will genes at other positions. Furthermore, the
number of genes with the same function may determine
the SNP frequency at a particular gene. We applied a twotailed Students t-test to determine whether pathway position or gene copy number effect SNP frequencies. Figures
1 and 2 show the assumed terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in eucalypts together with the frequency of SNPs in the exons and introns within each gene
for all four species (Table 6). It is apparent that for most
genes the two Eucalyptus species, E. camaldulensis and E.
loxophleba have more SNPs per kbp than do the other two
species. This is true for both exons and introns. Further
analyses showed that the introns of the mevalonate pathway (MVA) have significantly more SNPs than do those of
the terpenoid pathway (TPS) (P = 0.02), no other combination was significantly different when taking averages of
all four species. Within species, however, we found two
significant differences, both in E. globulus. The MVA pathway had significantly more SNPs in the exons than did the
flavonoid pathway (FLAV) (P = 0.05), while the MVA
pathway had more SNPs in the introns than did the TPS
pathway (P = 0.01).

We hypothesized that genes that occur only once within
the genome (single genes) are under higher selective pressure and therefore we expected to observe less SNPs in
those genes than genes that occur in multi-gene families.
Additional file 1 shows how many members there are in
each gene family from some species with known genome
sequences (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera). BLAST searches within the
genome web pages (A. thaliana (TAIR v. 7.0), O. sativa
(TIGR v. 5.0) and P. trichocarpa (JGI v. 1.1)) and searches
for the gene name in well-annotated genome web pages
(A. thaliana and O. sativa) generated most of the data,
while the numbers for V. vinifera came from Velasco and
co-workers [5]. A comparison of our results to those of
Tsai and co-workers [27], who used similar methods to
estimate the gene numbers for flavonoid biosynthesis
pathway genes from A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa, indicated few differences, which were of little consequence in
placing the genes into two categories: single or low copy
and high copy number genes (see Additional file 1). The
occurrence of pseudogenes make it difficult to verify the
exact copy number of a gene and, in the case of Eucalyptus,
the imminent release of the genome sequence will make
accurate measures easier. A comparison of SNP frequencies between single or low copy genes and genes from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/452

large families showed no significant differences. There
appears to be a tendency towards higher SNP frequencies
for genes in the MVA pathway than for genes in other
pathways (Table 6), but definite conclusions require data
on the hmgr and pmk genes
Comparing SNPs among Eucalyptus species
The four species studied have high sequence homologies
for the genes analysed, with often less than three nucleotides difference per 1,000 bp in exons separating them.
The number of SNPs that each species shared with at least
one other species is shown in Table 7. The estimates are
very similar for E. globulus and E. nitens, both for the exons
and the introns (Table 7). In contrast, E. camaldulensis and
E. loxophleba share 274 and 204 SNPs from the exons and
519 and 399 SNPs from the introns. While the absolute
number of shared SNPs is higher for the latter two species,
the proportion is lower. Overall the proportion of SNPs
shared by more than one species is high - 33%.
Analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous sites across
Eucalyptus
Genes can be under positive or negative selection. Insight
into the type of selection can be obtained from the ratio
of non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site
to synonymous SNPs per synonymous site in the exons of
a gene (pN/pS). Ratios for genes that had less than ten variants were excluded, for example E. globulus lar and anr
with four and nine variations, respectively. We could not
determine a value for E. globulus chalcone isomerase (chi),
because it lacked a synonymous mutation. The values of
pN/pS ranged from 0.04 to 0.95, averaging 0.3. The average ratios for the four species were between 0.08 and 0.69
indicating purifying selection in the pathways studied (see
additional file 2). Interestingly, the two genes with the
lowest pN/pS ratio were 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate
synthase 1 (dxs1) and 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (dxs2).

Discussion
For the 23 genes 8,631 high confidence SNPs across the
four species were identified from 1,764 individuals that
represented the full geographic range of each species. Our
strict criteria undoubtedly led to the exclusion of many
'real' SNPs, but ensured that there were no false-positives
in our SNP identification. There should be no ascertainment bias due to our sampling approach, however, a
major potential bias has been raised with re-sequencing
methods, namely PCR amplification from pooled samples [11,28]. Pools of DNA from four species were used in
this SNP discovery project and the primers were designed
inside the exons to enhance our chance of even and equal
amplification within and across all pools. Our success rate
for using primers across all species was 100%. Nevertheless, this came at a cost, since we had to exclude data from

every 60 bp in Populus tremula [32]. In all these studies a
limited number of individuals were sampled. Our estimates are much higher than comparable SNP frequencies
previously reported in Eucalyptus of one SNP in every 192
bp [15]. This could be explained by our experimental
design, which examined a comprehensive set of populations over the geographical range of each species, in contrast to E. grandis where only three individuals from each
of seven families were examined [15].

genes where the primers clearly amplified more than one
locus, namely the large gene families of terpene-,
squalene- and chalcone- synthases. The study was successful because the reference or consensus sequences in the
four species showed high identity. It is unclear whether
exclusion of gene families led to bias in estimation of
overall levels of SNP diversity.
A general conclusion that can be drawn for the four species is that within all genes there is more SNP variability
in introns than in the exons. In only three of the 92 comparisons (hmgs and anr in E. nitens and smo in E.
loxophleba) do more SNPs occur in exons than introns. The
lowest SNP density in the exons was found in E. nitens
with one SNP in every 39 bp, and the highest in E. camaldulensis with one SNP in every 21 bp, which is similar to
estimates of one in 43 bp and one in 50 for ESTs from
maize [29,30]. For angiosperm trees comparable esti-

There are different levels of SNPs between genes within
species. Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. loxophleba have
higher levels of polymorphism for individual genes than
E. globulus and E. nitens, but there is a smaller range in SNP
polymorphisms between genes. A high proportion of the
discovered SNPs are shared between several species. While
some of these may have occurred independently after species separation, many would have been present before the
speciation events. If evolutionary time from speciation is
the dominant factor then one would expect that genes
from other biosynthetic pathways in the same eucalypt
species will show similar patterns. There is much uncertainty as to how long ago the species separated. The proposed separation age ranges from 5 - 10 mya for E. globulus
and E. nitens to 20 - 42 mya for E. loxophleba from the
other three species [23,24]. That so many SNPs are in
common between species suggest selective forces have
maintained many of them over this period. Similarly, the
unusually large proportion of non-synonymous SNP sites,
especially of common SNPs, along with the high similarity of proportions of synonymous versus non-synonymous SNPs across species suggests maintenance of these
SNPs through selection.
It is noticeable that the two sister species E. globulus and E.
nitens have very similar levels of SNP diversity overall and
at the intron and exon level. The similar proportions of
common SNPs in introns for E. globulus and E. nitens
could result from evolutionary lineages of comparable
age. In fact, they share about 28% of their SNPs, even
though they have been separated for several million years.
Morphologically they are quite distinct species. For the ten
other species in the small taxonomic group Globulares to
which these two species belong [22], we hypothesise that
similar patterns of polymorphism will be found for the
same functional set of genes. Will other eucalypt species
pairs show similar patterns and what does it infer about
evolutionary relationships within and between groups of
species?
Eucalyptus camaldulensis has the highest numbers of SNPs,
especially of rare alleles both in the exons and introns.
This species has the largest geographic range of any eucalypt species and the most number of natural populations

conclusions. Most of the genes studied appear to be under
purifying selection. Similar results have been reported in
other plants [15,36]. In forest trees current data suggest
15-20% of genes are under some form of selection
[37,38]. It is possible that the assumption for a genomewide neutral model does not apply for the eucalypt species. Whether many of the observed patterns are due to
common demographic factors rather than selection may
be resolved when nucleotide diversity estimates are available at the population level.

of the four species that were sampled. Perhaps the species
with the greater number of separate evolving populations
will have a greater array of rare SNPs. A SNP data set from
individuals rather than pooled bulks of DNA would allow
examination of this hypothesis. The several subspecies
within both E. loxophleba and E. camaldulensis suggest
greater evolutionary divergence within these species and
this seems to be reflected in the higher SNP diversity in the
two species. The higher intron/exon ratios of SNPs in
these two species could reflect that they represent older
evolutionary lineages which have enabled greater accumulation of SNP alleles over time, especially in introns,
where selective forces could be weaker. Similar differences
in intron/exon SNP ratios may occur in other eucalypts
and plant groups as a result of differences in length of evolutionary lineages.

The hypothesis that entry point enzymes such as dxs control the downstream production of terpenoids [39] is not
reflected in lower levels of SNP diversity in the corresponding genes, but may be reflected by the low ratios of
pN/pS. Nevertheless there could be significant associations between SNP polymorphisms and concentrations of
final products in these genes. Furthermore, we only examined structural genes here and there could be strong selection on the unknown regulatory elements involved in the
pathway. Recent studies have found evidence of different
patterns of polymorphism between different functional
gene classes with genes interacting with the environment
having high levels of SNP diversity [9]. Examination of the
data set in this study with genes in pathways responsible
for other phenotypic traits for the same eucalypt species
and individuals will enable similar comparison

Conclusion
Our study shows that it is possible to discover most common SNPs and a large proportion of rare sequence variants by 454 pyrosequencing for fragments amplified from
species-wide pooled DNA in a set of targeted genes. We
emphasize that a comprehensive sample collection is the
key for comprehensive SNP discovery. With one SNP in
every 16 bp E. camaldulensis has the highest SNP frequency
of any woody plant species studied so far. The high
number of shared SNPs between E. globulus and E. nitens,
as well as the similar patterns of SNPs in all studied genes
is a reflection of their close phylogenetic relationship. The
study successfully characterised a large number of common SNPs that can be used in association studies in eucalypts.

Methods
In a study of nine genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway
in A. thaliana no association was detected between
sequence diversity and position in the pathway [7]. In our
study structural genes of the terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, which are important in plant-herbivore interactions [33-35], were used. Essentially, no
relationship was found between the levels of SNP diversity in genes and their position in the pathways or
between pathways. Even without some gene sequences
the coverage of the pathways was sufficient to make these

Plant collection
We collected Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) at a field trial in
Northern Tasmania (Latrobe site). This trial was planted
in 1989 from open pollinated seeds collected from 46
locations throughout the geographic range of the species
[40-42]. Leaves from 511 individual trees collected in September 2006, were frozen immediately and kept at -80°C
until further use. Leaves and DNA from 381 Eucalyptus
nitens (Maiden) trees were previously obtained as part of
association genetic studies of the central highlands

regions of Victoria [43] and also from a population genetics study of E. nitens [44]. The four NSW populations (83
trees) from the Byrne study [44] along with 24 central Victorian populations completed the geographic coverage for
E. nitens (Table 1). Butcher had previously collected leaf
samples and extracted DNA from populations of E.
camaldulensis (Dehnh.) covering the geographic range
[26,45]. We used DNA samples from 456 of these sample
trees representing 93 populations. Finally we collected
leaves from 416 E. loxophleba (Benth.) from 29 populations in 2007/2008 covering the range of the species,
including the four subspecies [46].
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from E. globulus, E.
nitens and E. camaldulensis with a modified CTAB method
[47]. and from E. loxophleba with a Qiagen DNeasy 96
Plant kit (Qiagen Australia, Doncaster, Vic, Australia). We
measured the gDNA concentration of each individual
sample with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and adjusted
the concentration to 50 ng/μl for E. globulus, E. nitens and
E. camaldulensis and to 25 ng/μl for E. loxophleba. Finally,
we pooled DNA samples from each species and checked
the resulting pool for quality and quantity on a ND-1000
(Thermo Scientific, USA).
Gene discovery and primer design
Amino acid sequences from genes of the terpenoid and
flavonoid biosynthetic pathways were obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana and in some cases Populus trichocarpa.
They were then used to search for eucalypt sequences with
a BLAST search against the Genebank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ EST data base (tblastn against
Myrtaceae). Eucalyptus hits were then aligned for each
gene, translated into protein and reverse BLAST was used
against Genebank to confirm the gene identity. Primers
were designed (see Additional file 3) to amplify each gene
from gDNA to gain intron sequences as well as confirming
the exon sequences. Some sequences (chs and tps) came
from degenerate primers, cloning, and sequencing in our
laboratory.

Many of the ESTs did not cover the complete open reading
frame of its gene so to close gaps on the 5' end of these
genes we used the GenomeWalker Universal Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA). From the

combined sequence information we made a consensus
sequences for each gene, which later served as our reference sequence for the 454 pyrosequencing assembly. We
designed primers for 37 genes starting within the first
available exon and ending inside an exon, to produce a
fragment of maximum 2,100 bp. If required, multiple
primer pairs were designed to fully cover a gene (see additional file 3), giving us 57 amplicons. The combined
length of all amplicons was approximately 89 kbp.
Verification of primers and fragment amplification
We verified that all primers worked within a species using
firstly 12 individuals from each species which were
selected to cover their geographic ranges, and secondly for
96 individuals from E. globulus but for a subset of 17
amplicons. Fragments were amplified by PCR with TAQTi (Fisher-Biotech, West Perth, Australia) using standard
PCR conditions, separated on 1.2% Agarose gels containing ethidium bromide with images captured on a Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). For re-sequencing, we amplified fragments from each of the four pools of gDNA by PCR under
the conditions described previously and then ran a fraction of the PCR product on an agarose gel to check its
quality. We cleaned single fragments of the expected size
with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Doncaster,
Vic, Australia). When there were several fragments, we
separated the PCR products on a 1.2% Agarose gel and
extracted them from gel using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen, Australia). The DNA concentration of each
purified fragment was then quantified on a ND-1000
(Thermo Scientific, USA) and equimolar amounts of all
fragments from each species were pooled. Each pool was
checked for quality and quantity by assay on a ND-1000
(Thermo Scientific, USA) and by Agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragment pools were frozen and shipped cold to
the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF, St Lucia,
QLD, Australia).
454 sequencing and assembly
After nebulisation, we barcoded the pool from each species and had it sequenced on a Life Sciences GS-FLX
according to standard procedures (454 Life Sciences,
Branford, CT, USA). Sequences were "base-called" using
454 software and then separated according to the barcode.
The sequences that did not have a functional barcode were
discarded (<0.7%). We truncated those sequences with

low base-call quality before separately assembling the
sequences of each species to the reference gene sequences
using CLC Genomics Workbench software (CLC bio,
Aarhus, Denmark) with the software's standard assembly
parameters. For each gene, we excluded regions of low
read depth (<20). For unknown reasons there were no
sequences for the E. globulus dxr gene. Files containing
reads' sequences and quality scores were deposited in the
Short Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [accession number SRA008618].
SNP detection and analysis
We used the CLC Genomics Workbench software (CLC
bio, Denmark) to detect single nucleotide variants within
each species. After reference assembly we had average
sequencing depths between 242 and 410 reads at each
nucleotide site (average of 315). We used a SNP discovery
window of 7 bp at a central base quality score of 40 with
surrounding base quality scores of 20 or more. At read
depths between 20 and 50, we kept only alleles at a frequency of at least 10%, whereas at read depths over 50,
any allele frequencies were kept as long as there were at
least 3 reads with the allele variant. Our confidence criteria lead to the exclusion of 3,734 SNPs. We designated
alleles "rare" if they occurred at frequencies below 10%
and "common" when their frequencies equalled or
exceeded 10%. Finally, we counted the number of SNPs
for each gene and normalized it to 1,000 bp. For the estimation of intraspecific selection, we calculated the ratio of
non-synonymous variants per non-synonymous site (pN)
and synonymous variants per synonymous sites (pS). We
then calculated the ratio of pN/pS for each gene and species [48].
