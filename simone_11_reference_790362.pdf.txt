The reference human nuclear mitochondrial
sequences compilation validated and
implemented on the UCSC genome browser

Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic nuclear genomes contain fragments of mitochondrial DNA called NumtS (Nuclear
mitochondrial Sequences), whose mode and time of insertion, as well as their functional/structural role within the
genome are debated issues. Insertion sites match with chromosomal breaks, revealing that micro-deletions usually
occurring at non-homologous end joining loci become reduced in presence of NumtS. Some NumtS are involved
in recombination events leading to fragment duplication. Moreover, NumtS are polymorphic, a feature that renders
them candidates as population markers. Finally, they are a cause of contamination during human mtDNA
sequencing, leading to the generation of false heteroplasmies.
Results: Here we present RHNumtS.2, the most exhaustive human NumtSome catalogue annotating 585 NumtS,
97% of which were here validated in a European individual and in HapMap samples. The NumtS complete dataset
and related features have been made available at the UCSC Genome Browser. The produced sequences have been
submitted to INSDC databases. The implementation of the RHNumtS.2 tracks within the UCSC Genome Browser
has been carried out with the aim to facilitate browsing of the NumtS tracks to be exploited in a wide range of
research applications.
Conclusions: We aimed at providing the scientific community with the most exhaustive overview on the human
NumtSome, a resource whose aim is to support several research applications, such as studies concerning human
structural variation, diversity, and disease, as well as the detection of false heteroplasmic mtDNA variants. Upon
implementation of the NumtS tracks, the application of the BLAT program on the UCSC Genome Browser has now
become an additional tool to check for heteroplasmic artefacts, supported by data available through the NumtS
tracks.

Background
Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is widely used for
phylogenetic, forensic and clinical studies and many features like maternal inheritance, absence of recombination and lack of efficient repair systems are well known
and extensively studied. Recent advances in genetics
provide researchers with mitochondrial DNA sequences
located within the nuclear genome, thus allowing the
investigation of intriguing aspects of genome organization. Fragments of mtDNA that give rise to nuclear
mitochondrial sequences (NumtS) are found in many

eukaryotic nuclear genomes and believed to derive from
damaged mitochondria [1]. The discovery of these genomic elements dates back to 1967 through hybridization
experiments on mouse liver between mtDNA and
nuclear genome [2]. NumtS generation may have started
soon after the endosymbiontic event [3] although the
underlying mechanisms are still unclear and time and
mode of arrival from mitochondria to nucleus have not
been defined. As far as the mode, the most credited
hypothesis suggests that in presence of mutagenic agents
or under stress conditions, fragments of mtDNA may
escape the organelles, reach the nucleus and likely insert
into nuclear DNA during double-strand breaks (DSB)
repair by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
machinery, although other mechanisms have been

proposed [4,5]. It is commonly accepted that most
human NumtS have originated before modern man,
although evidences of NumtS recent insertions as well
as their duplication in human genomes have been
reported [6-15]. As a consequence, some NumtS display
a highly polymorphic behaviour, as they can occur in
homo- or heterozygosis, or be absent in different individuals at specific loci. These features render them candidates as population markers, as already suggested [16].
Nonetheless, several criteria must be fulfilled before
human NumtS can ascend to the status of evolutionary
markers. NumtS identification, quantification and mapping must be completed and refined in the attempt to
finally define the asset of mitochondrial sequences
within the human nuclear genome, i.e. the human
NumtSome. Indeed, despite scattered data on NumtS
evolution and mechanisms of insertions being published
[10,11,13], these results are based on pools of raw data
that are not readily available. Moreover, it must be considered that accurate mapping is highly dependent on
the quality of the genome assembly for each organism
and on algorithms and parameters applied in silico. The
need to provide a well-characterized, exhaustive database containing the human NumtSome has led us to
generate the Reference Human NumtS compilation
(RHNumtS), based on i) database similarity searching
programs where the human mtDNA reference sequence
(rCRS [17]) is compared to the human nuclear genome
sequences (build hg18 available both at NCBI and
UCSC sites) and ii) the comparison with other already
published compilations [1,5,10,13]. Because of a great
discrepancy among data obtained upon implementation
of different protocols, stringent parameters were utilized

during the production of the first release, RHNumtS.1
[18]. However in the process of in vitro validation, of
the first release, evidences of additional mitochondrial
fragments (Figure 1) not reported in RHNumtS.1
prompted a continuous work of protocol revision that
has led to an extended and deeply validated second
release, RHNumtS.2. The RHNumtS.2 also includes
revisited data from smaller, scattered previously published compilations [1,5,10,13,18]. Here we report the
optimized protocol that allows the detection of human
NumtS. Upon a thorough validation by amplification
and sequencing of the human NumtSome, here completed for the first time, both nuclear and mitochondrial
human NumtS tracks have been created and made available through the UCSC Genome Browser.

Results
The RHNumtS.2 compilation

The RHNumtS.2 compilation was obtained through an
in silico hybridization between each human chromosome (build hg18) and the reference human mitochondrial genome rCRS [GenBank:NC_012920]. The process
returned 766 High Scoring Pairs (HSPs), i.e. mitochondrial fragments similar to nuclear sequences, hereafter
named HSP_NumtS, whose alignment lengths ranged
from 31 to 14904 bp. The similarity percentage of each
fragment versus the rCRS sequence ranged from 63% to
100%. HSP_NumtS showing evident neighbourhood on
both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes were merged
in a single NumtS (assembled NumtS) according to the
criteria described in the Methods section. NumtS covering the D-loop region were returned by BLASTN as different HSPs, as in the rCRS EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ

Figure 1 BLAST2seq dotplot output. The dotplot shows the results obtained by applying BLAST2seq between rCRS and chromosome 1 region
containing HSA_NumtS_021 (release RHNumtS.1). The thin line refers to the part of the HSP_NumtS_021 already annotated in the RHNumtS.1
compilation. NumtS added in RHNumtS.2 are marked with thick lines and highlighted by red arrows.

databank entry the D-loop is split into the end (positions 16024-16569) of the sequence followed by the
start (positions 1-576). Therefore, HSP_NumtS close in
the nuclear genome and mapping on the D-loop region,
were also merged in a single assembled NumtS: this
device fitted our joining protocol to the circularity of
the mitochondrial genome. Overall, RHNumtS.2 annotates 766 human HSP_NumtS corresponding to 585
assembled Human NumtS inclusive of the 190 annotated in RHNumtS.1 [18]. Covered genome amounts to
627410 bases. The complete RHNumtS.2 compilation is
reported here in the additional file 1 RHNumtS.2.xls. A
NumtS ID was assigned to each assembled NumtS with
a format HSA_NumtS_xxx, where HSA stands for H.
sapiens and xxx is a three-digit code.
Detailed statistics on the NumtS length and similarity
distributions are shown in Table 1. Mapping of NumtS
(Figure 2) showed that chromosome 2 and chromosome
18 are respectively the most and least densely populated
by this class of genomic elements in terms of base pairs
overall length (Table 2). A statistical correlation showed
that there is a linear relationship between the number of
NumtS located on each chromosome and the relative
chromosome length (Pearson’s r = 0.82). On the other
hand, the value obtained by correlating the number of
NumtS for each chromosome and the genic density
(0.22) suggests that, at chromosome level, there is no
evidence of NumtS distribution biased by the presence
of genes. NumtS mtDNA coverage (Figure 3) highlights
that the fragments add up to several copies of the mitochondrial genome. Over-represented regions encompass
many tRNAs, the two ribosomal genes 12S and 16S,
large portions of COX1, COX3, CYTB genes and short
fragments of ND1, ND5 and ND6 genes. On the other
hand, D-loop region, the whole ATP8 gene and most of
ND1, ND4 and ND6 genes are under-represented.
Bench and in silico validation of RHNumtS.2

The in silico hybridization was based on a consensus
human genome (build hg18) derived from the DNA
sequencing from 6 different samples. Due to the polymorphic nature of human NumtS [13] and to the technical difficulties posed by repetitive sequences during

assembly of the consensus genome, we proceeded to
validate RHNumtS.2 on an individual of European origin, through amplification and sequencing (bench validation). HSP_NumtS not present in the European
sample (HSA_NumtS_009, HSA_NumtS_426, HSA_NumtS_522) were validated in an Ethiopian sample.
Additionally, in silico validation was carried out on
genomic annotations from eight HapMap samples.
Design of 355 specific primer pairs was performed,
providing amplicons of molecular weight (MW)
expected in presence of the NumtS, as confirmed by gel
electrophoresis, allowing the validation of 354
HSP_NumtS. Overall 339/354 were successfully
sequenced on both strands. Despite yielding an amplicon of expected MW in the case of NumtS presence,
the remaining 15 PCR products contained long homopolymeric stretches or heterozygous repetitive satellitelike sequences, which rendered sequencing incomplete.
Thus 44% of the total HSP_NumtS (339/766) were
sequenced, which is the largest set of NumtS sequenced
to date, to the best of our knowledge. Each obtained
sequence was multi-aligned to the corresponding
mtDNA fragment of the same individual, to the hg18
corresponding nuclear DNA fragment as well as to the
rCRS mtDNA fragment. The multi-alignments are available in the additional file 2 Validated_NumtS_multial.
txt. HSP_NumtS sequences were submitted to the
EMBL databank through the WebIN submission tool
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webin) available through the
INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration) organization. To this purpose, a human
NumtS EMBL flat-file format template was designed
(Figure 4). The entry structure reports in the “Features”
table the “misc_feature” data which allow the end-user
accessing the INSDC databases to obtain the NumtS
location on the nuclear genome and the mtDNA fragments of origin. The accession numbers are reported in
additional file 3 NumtS_validation.xls. Overall, 279
assembled NumtS were validated with this approach
(Table 3), i.e. those NumtS for which a specific primer
pair could be designed.
To further improve and complete the RHNumtS.2 validation, we compared the NumtS map versus the

and ascertained. Overall, 95.4% of the RHNumtS.2 was
hence validated.
The UCSC human NumtS tracks

In order to facilitate browsing of NumtS sequences, we
implemented human NumtS tracks using the UCSC
Genome Browser tools upon mapping on the hg18
build. Four different NumtS tracks were designed and
implemented under the section ‘Variation and Repeats’.
The ’NumtS’ track shows the mapping of the HSPs
returned by BLASTN on the nuclear genome, namely

the HSP_NumtS. Items shading reflects the similarity
score obtained by BLASTN and the arrows direction is
concordant with the strand on which the NumtS is
aligned. A link to mtDNA mapping is also provided.
The ‘NumtS assembled’ track shows items obtained by
assembling HSPs annotated in the ‘NumtS’ track fulfilling the conditions described in the Methods section.
The ‘NumtS on mitochondrion’ track shows mapping of
the HSP_NumtS on the mitochondrial genome. Items
shading reflects the similarity returned by BLASTN, and
the direction of the arrows is concordant with the alignment strand. For every item, a link pointing to the

Discussion
The number of NumtS reported in this release,
RHNumtS.2, has increased about by three fold over the
first one [18], while the amount of bases covered has
increased about by 1.6 fold. More details about the extension of the previous release are provided in the additional

For each individual, discrepancy between the number of FES with NumtS and
the corresponding number of validated NumtS is due to the different
coverage of NumtS loci in FES.

the median value of the extension ratio is 1.05. For ten
NumtS, the extension was quite considerable (extension
ratio > 6). Indeed the protocol designed for the production of the first release was aimed to produce a reference
compilation, i.e. a collection of sequences located on the
reference human genome build and showing strong evidences allowing to define them as “NumtS”. The less
stringent protocol here applied has allowed us to recognize 585 NumtS, over 95% of which have been validated
here for the first time, either by bench approaches (PCR
and sequencing) or in silico on eight samples collected
within the international HapMap project.
The novelty here presented is the implementation of
the NumtS annotations in the UCSC Genome Browser.
The “NumtS Sequence” tracks are available in the hg18
release of the human genome, in the track section “Variation and Repeats": this feature broadens the examination
potential of NumtS within their genomic context, as they
can be intuitively displayed and merged with annotations
of other genomic elements available in the Genome
Browser. Browsing of the 1000 bp-long flanking regions
of NumtS shows that about 97% of NumtS reside in loci
associated to repeated elements of various types. This
evidence led us to suppose that amplification might be
difficult because of the risk to obtain non-specific amplification. Notwithstanding this evidence, 279 NumtS were
amplified, 15% of which fell within highly repeated
regions (Figure 7). As a complementary approach, FES
analysis revealed to be informative with respect to the
validation of in silico detected NumtS located within
duplicated regions. As marked in Table 3 and annotated
in additional file 3 NumtS_validation.xls (sheet “Nonvalidated NumtS”), only 27 NumtS have not been validated, i.e. those mainly involved in duplication events.
A result that it is worth commenting concerns the
coverage of the mitochondrial genome provided by
NumtS. mtDNA fragments related to tRNAs and
extended portions of the two ribosomal genes as well as
of COX1, COX3 and CYTB genes are over-represented,
whereas the D-loop region and other genes such as
ATP8, ND1, ND4 and ND6 were the least represented
within the nuclear genome. These data are in agreement
with the conservation degree of the mitochondrial genes
in mammals reported in [19]. The diversified observed
frequencies of mtDNA fragments could be justified by
taking into account that the RHNumtS.2 compilation
results from an in silico hybridization between the modern human mtDNA and the human nuclear genome,
therefore more evolutionary conserved mitochondrial
regions may have higher chances to be detected with
such strategy. Further bioinformatics analyses based on
different approaches could also contribute to recognize
more ancestral events that had led mitochondrial fragments to insert into nuclear genome. Finally, with

respect to the apparently unbalanced distribution of the
NumtS on the different chromosomes, although preliminary evidence showed a preferential NumtS localization in non-coding regions, a more detailed analysis of
each chromosome and NumtS is required to explain the
insertion bias towards specific chromosomal regions.

Conclusions
In this paper we present the most exhaustive overview
on the human NumtSome implemented in the
RHNumtS.2 compilation, a resource whose aim is to
support different research applications ranging from studies concerning human structural variation, diversity,
and disease, as well as the detection of false heteroplasmic mtDNA variants.
Methods
Blasting of the human nuclear genome versus the
mitochondrial genome

BLAST2seq implements the BLASTN program (release
2.2.19 of the BLAST suite) [20] applied to the comparison between two sequences. The run was performed on

a local server. Twenty-four runs were launched, one for
each human chromosome sequence available through
the hg18 build. The human mtDNA reference sequence
rCRS [GenBank:NC_012920] was used as query. Scoring
parameters were fixed as follows: 2 for match reward, -3
for mismatch penalty; -5 for gap opening, -2 for gap
extension. The e-value was fixed to 1e-03. The hg18
chromosome sequences were fetched using the get-genome program of the GMAP package [21]. Each fragment
of each chromosome aligned with the J01415.2 mtDNA
whose e-value was lower than the fixed threshold produced an HSP (High Scoring Pair).
NumtS assembling

The assembling of the HSPs was performed with
spreadsheet interpolation and manual inspection,
strongly supported by graphical display of the
HSP_NumtS with a custom annotation tool available on
the UCSC Genome Browser. HSP_NumtS located less
than 2000 bp apart on a specific chromosome and corresponding to two mtDNA fragments, not more than
2000 bp apart and oriented in the same direction, were

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) using
as a template each NumtS extended by 1000 nucleotides from the 5’ and 3’ ends, and specifically locating
primers in NumtS flanking regions. The NumtS
sequences with their flanking regions were extracted
from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/) [22]. Primers were designed to ensure amplification, even in case of NumtS absence. For NumtS
longer than 1200 bp, external/internal, internal/external, and/or internal/internal primer pairs were
designed. To exclude co-amplification of mtDNA, primers were validated through BLAST analysis, by comparison with the mitochondrial sequence of the
European individual [18]. Moreover, in order to avoid
primers self-hybridization, the Oligo Analysis tool
available at Operon web site (http://www.operon.com/
technical/toolkit.aspxis), was used. Sequences of primer
pairs are provided in additional file 3 NumtS_validation.xls (sheet “Validated_NumtS”).

PCR amplification and sequencing

The validation of RHNumtS.2 was carried out on DNA
extracted from blood of an individual of European origin
belonging to a typical European mitochondrial haplogroup H2b. NumtS were amplified and sequenced as
previously described [18]. HSP_NumtS not present in
the European sample were validated in an Ethiopian
sample whose mtDNA belonged to the L0 haplogroup.
NumtS sequences were submitted to the EMBL databank and hence to the three Nucleic Acids databases
joint in the international collaboration INSDC. The
WebIn tool available on-line was utilized (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/embl/Submission/). Accession numbers are
provided in additional file 3 NumtS_validation.xls (sheet
“Validated_NumtS”).
Multi-alignment

NumtS sequences were multialigned to the corresponding hg18 sequence inclusive of the NumtS flanking
region and to the mtDNA fragments from rCRS and
from the validation sample. The multi-alignment has
been produced using the ClustalW program (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ClustalW/) [23]. The whole data
set of the multialigned NumtS is available in the additional file 2 Validated_NumtS_multial.txt. Multi-alignment of the sequences already published in [18] have
been included in the dataset.

Comparison of the RHNumtS.2 sequences versus the FES

The HapMap consortium [24] has made available 270
samples from Nigeria, China, Japan and North/West
Europe. With the aim to study human structural variation, eight HapMap samples (Table 4) were selected and
their genomic DNA was cloned using a fosmid subcloning strategy [25]. For each individual library the paired
ends were sequenced and the obtained FES (Fosmid End
Sequences) data were made publicly available (http://
hgsv.washington.edu/).
The in silico validation of NumtS was based on a merging protocol carried out using the Galaxy package
available at http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/. For each sample,
only clones with a single best concordant placement
according to the FES-pair analysis previously described
[25] were considered.
NumtS tracks implementation

The NumtS tracks and the external links were produced
starting from the RHNumtS.2 compilation spreadsheet,
with manual manipulation and by using in-house shell
and Python scripts. The human mitochondrial reference
genome at the UCSC Genome Browser derives from an
African individual [GenBank:NC_001807] and shows
three insertions with respect to the rCRS. Therefore, the
mitochondrial coordinates annotated in the additional
file 1 RHNumtS.2.xls were re-mapped to NC_001807.
The tracks have been released in bed format, one of the
formats allowing the display of the tracks at the UCSC
Genome Browser. Templates of the bed file format and
the chromosome colour key are available on the UCSC
Genome Browser help pages (http://genome.ucsc.edu).

Additional material
Additional file 1: The RHNumtS.2 compilation. The table reports 766
Human HSP_ NumtS fragments of which 150 have been assembled in a
single NumtS according to the rules reported in the Results section. Each
line refers to an HSP_NumtS and reports the NumtS ID, the
HSP_NumtS ID, a code tracing the compilation updating procedure, the
chromosome where the NumtS is located and the strand where BLAST
mapped the NumtS, the positions on the hg18 chromosome and the
rCRS. In the case of assembled NumtS, in the right hand side of the
table, detailed information on each fragment is available. The last
column reports the identity percentage as reported in the BLAST output
for each HSP.
Additional file 2: Multi-alignments of sequenced NumtS. This archive
contains multi-alignments of sequenced NumtS with the corresponding
nuclear and mitochondrial regions. Each file reports the multi-alignment
of reference (hg18) NumtS sequence, the sequenced NumtS, the
corresponding mitochondrial H2b sequence and the corresponding rCRS
region. For the three NumtS not present in the European individual
(HSA_NumtS_009, HSA_NumtS_426, HSA_NumtS_522), the sequence
validated on the Ethiopian individual (L0) was multialigned with the
reference (hg18) NumtS sequence and the sequence produced in the
European sample; the gap present in the latter sequence matches with
the nuclear region where the NumtS maps.
Additional file 3: The RHNumtS.2 Human NumtS validated by bench
and/or in silico approaches. The table reports two sheets, one for the

Page 10 of 11

validated NumtS and the other one for non-validated NumtS. In the
sheet “Validated NumtS”, for each validated NumtS the following data
are reported: the NumtS ID code, the HSP_NumtS_ID, the accession
number hold until published code referred to he INSDC submission, in
the case when the NumtS has been sequenced, otherwise the flag ‘not
sequenced’ is annotated, the flags (Y or N) indicating successful response
to PCR, sequencing and in silico Hapmap sample validation; and finally
the primer code and the forward and reverse primer sequences. In the
sheet “Non-validated NumtS”, the list of non-validated NumtS (neither by
PCR/sequencing, nor by in silico approach) is provided, along with a
possible explanation for validation failure.
Additional file 4: Browsing NumtS tracks on UCSC Genome Browser.
This file provides an essential guide to the browsing of the NumtS tracks
available at UCSC Genome Browser.
