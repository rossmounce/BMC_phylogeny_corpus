Abstract
Background: Atopic and non-atopic wheezing may be caused by different etiologies: while eosinophils are more
important in atopic asthmatic wheezers, neutrophils are predominantly found in BAL samples of young children
with wheezing. Both neutrophils as well as eosinophils may secrete matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9).
Considering that MMP-9 plays an important role in airway wall thickening and airway inflammation, it may
influence the development of obstructive airway phenotypes in children. In the present study we investigated
whether genetic variations in MMP-9 influence the development of different forms of childhood asthma.
Methods: Genotyping of four HapMap derived tagging SNPs in the MMP-9 gene was performed using MALDI-TOF
MS in three cross sectional study populations of German children (age 9-11; N = 4,264) phenotyped for asthma
and atopic diseases according to ISAAC standard procedures. Effects of single SNPs and haplotypes were studied
using SAS 9.1.3 and Haploview.
Results: SNP rs2664538 significantly increased the risk for non-atopic wheezing (OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.40-3.21,
p < 0.001) and non-atopic asthma (OR 1.66, 95%CI 1.12-2.46, p = 0.011). Furthermore, the minor allele of
rs3918241 may be associated with decreased expiratory flow measurements in non-atopic children. No significant
effects on the development of atopy or total serum IgE levels were observed.
Conclusions: Our results have shown that homozygocity for MMP-9 variants increase the risk to develop nonatopic forms of asthma and wheezing, which may be explained by a functional role of MMP-9 in airway
remodeling. These results suggest that different wheezing disorders in childhood are affected differently by genetic
alterations.

Background
Wheezing affects app. 50% of children up to the age of
six, and many but not all of these children develop persistent wheezing or asthma later in life [1]. Diverse
wheezing phenotypes can be identified in hindsight
based on differences in natural histories, trigger and risk
factors [2,3]. Atopic and non-atopic wheezing can easily
be discriminated in children by the presence or absence
of sensitization to allergens. Atopic and non-atopic
asthma show contrasting natural histories and may be
caused by different etiologies: while eosinophils are
most prevalent in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of older
atopic asthmatic wheezers [4], neutrophils are

School, Hannover, Germany

predominantly found in BAL samples of young children
with severe wheezing [5].
When severe airway inflammation with the involvement of neutrophilic inflammation is ongoing [6,7],
repair processes may contribute significantly to airway
remodeling and irreversibility of lung injury. For repair
and remodeling, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a
family of proteases that degrade components of the
extracellular matrix, seem to be of central importance.
Neutrophils synthesize MMP-9 and the protease is
stored in specific granules from which it is readily
released. In circumstances in which neutrophils are
abundant, MMP-9 can be secreted, and identifying other
cellular sources of MMP-9 may be difficult. In patients
with respiratory diseases, macrophages [8], eosinophils
[9] mast cells [10], and dendritic cells [11] all may produce MMP-9 under specific stimulation [8,9].

Eosinophils, important in asthma-related airway inflammation may also be a source of MMP9 and MMP9
expression correlate with eosinophil counts in bronchial
mucosa [12]. Accordingly, matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP-9) acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule perpetuating immune responses [13] but it is also involved in
repair processes after tissue injury and may down regulate remodeling during inflammatory reactions. As a
consequence of its ambivalent nature, MMP-9 levels in
sputum have been directly related to airway inflammation and inversely associated with airway thickening at
the same time [7].
Based on the relevance of MMP-9 in both inflammation and airway remodeling [7,14-18], it was hypothesized that genetic variations in the MMP-9 gene could
be involved in different forms of wheezing and asthma.
A number of polymorphisms have previously been
described for the MMP-9 gene, including variations in
the promoter (rs3918241 = A-1831T) and coding region
(rs2664538 = A2659G) resulting in decreased MMP-9
expression and activity [19]. Thus, the association
between four haplotype tagging SNPs capturing all
essential genetic information of the MMP-9 gene locus
(rs3918241, rs2664538, rs3918256 and rs3787268) and
wheezing phenotypes was studied in three cross sectional population samples of German children.

Methods
Population description

Between 1995 and 1996, a cross sectional study was performed in Munich and Dresden as part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood phase
II (ISAAC II) to assess the prevalence of asthma and
allergies in 5,629 schoolchildren, age 9 to 11 years. All
children of German origin with DNA available were
included in this analysis (N = 3,099). Additionally, 1,165
fourth graders from Leipzig, phenotyped with a very
similar protocol were also analyzed. As described in
detail before [20], self-administered questionnaires
included the ISAAC core questions on symptoms and
diagnoses of asthma, hay fever, and atopic eczema.
Informed written consent was obtained from all parents
of children included in these studies and all study methods were approved by the local ethics committees.
Children whose parents reported a physician’s diagnosis of asthma once, or recurrent, spastic or asthmatic bronchitis more than once were classified as
having asthma. Children were categorized as having
current wheezing if the parents had reported wheeze
in the past 12 months in Munich and Dresden or persistent wheezing in combination with a confirmative
answer to the question “had your child ever had
wheezing” in Leipzig.

The sensitivity to common aeroallergens (Dresden and
Munich: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria tenuis, cat dander, and mixed
grass and tree pollen; Leipzig: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, grass, birch and hazel pollen, cat and dog dander) was assessed by skin prick test (SPT) in all children
included in the study (3054 negative/1056 positive/154
missing = 4264). A child was considered atopic if a
wheal reaction ≥ 3 mm occurred to one or more allergens after subtraction of the negative control. Atopic
asthma was defined as asthma and the concomitant presence of a positive SPT, while non-atopic asthma was
defined as asthma in the absence of a positive skin prick
test. As controls for atopic or non-atopic asthma children without asthma and without atopy were used. Atopic/non-atopic wheeze was defined accordingly (current
wheeze and/without concomitant presence of a positive
SPT). Total serum IgE levels were measured using the
Imulite System (DPC Biermann, Germany). Specific IgE
antibodies (Sx1 from Phadia, Germany) against inhalative allergens (local grass pollen, birch pollen, mugwort
pollen, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cat dander, dog
dander, cladosporium herbarum) were measured in a
range between 0.35-100 IU/ml.
In 9-11 yr old children from Munich and Dresden,
lung function was measured by MasterScope Version
4.1 (Jäger, Würzburg, Germany). A minimum of two
baseline spirograms was performed and the highest of
two reproducible measurements of forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV1) was recorded as baseline
FEV1[21]. Reproducible measurements of maximum
expiratory flows (MEF) at 25, 50 and 75% of vital capacity, MMEF (maximum mid-expiratory flow: the average
expiratory flow over the middle half of the forced vital
capacity, FVC) were determined.
SNPs selection and genotyping

The MMP-9 gene had previously been screened for polymorphisms [22]. Based on all 11 SNPs genotyped by
HapMap[23] with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05
in the European population, linkage disequilibrium (r2 >
0.8) was assessed using the software Haploview [24] and
four haplotype tagging SNP capturing the genetic information of all common SNPs at the locus were selected
for genotyping. Of note, reference SNP id rs2664538
was recently changed into rs17576, dbSNP but for better
comparability with previous publications we continued
to refer to rs2664538 in the text.
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by a
standard salting out method [25] and pre-amplified as
described before[26]. DNA samples were genotyped
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Sequenom

Inc., San Diego, California). Additional details on genotyping are available in the online supplement.
Genotyping SNPs in different populations may lead to
a recruitment bias. However this may be almost
excluded in our study considering the following facts:
(1) this is a truly cross-sectional study that included all
fourth graders in the respective cities. (2) Admixture
was tested between a random sample of 400 children
from Munich and 400 samples from Dresden [27]. Considering this data, bias caused by admixture is very unlikely in these population samples. (3) Investigation of the
fine structure of European populations with applications
to association studies [27] have shown that slight differences observed between these populations cannot
explain differences in associations.
DNA pre-amplification and MALDI-TOF

To minimize the use of genomic DNA in further analyses, a modified primer extension pre-amplification
(PEP) or alternatively the GenomiPhi procedure (Ameham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) were applied for
random DNA pre amplification [28]. PCR assays and
associated extension reactions were designed using the
SpectroDESIGNER software (Sequenom Inc., San Diego,
California). All amplification and extension reaction
conditions have been previously described [29] and specific primers are given in table 1. Primer extension products were loaded onto a 384-element chip with a
nanoliter pipetting system (SpectroCHIP, SpectroJet,
Sequenom) and analyzed by a MassARRAY mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany).
The resulting mass spectra were analyzed for peak identification using the SpectroTYPER RT 2.0 software
(Sequenom Inc., San Diego, California). For quality control, Hardy-Weinberg calculations were performed to

ensure that each marker was within the expected allelic
population equilibrium.
Bioinformatics

Transcription factor (TF) binding analyses were performed using FASTSNP and Alibaba TF search. Phylogenetic comparisons with mouse and dog sequences
were performed using the Vista Genome Browser http://
pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2. Conserved non-coding
sequence (CNS) was defined as a sequence longer than
100 bp and more than 70% conserved with mouse or
rat.
Statistical Analysis

SNPs were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) using chi-square tests, with expected
frequencies derived from allele frequencies. Association
between SNPs and dichotomous outcomes were tested
using chi-square in a recessive model. Additionally odds
ratio and 95% confidence intervals are given. We calculated associations for all genetic models in the first
population sample (Dresden). While additive and dominant models showed similar results, the recessive model
showed the most consistent effects of SNPs in MMP-9
in the Dresden dataset and was thus applied to all datasets. Therefore, we present only the recessive model,
based on robustness and consistency in different
populations.
Lung function parameters were calculated as percentage of reference values. To test for differences in lung
function parameters between genotypes t-tests in a
recessive model were used. All tests were two-sided and
the differences were considered significant with p <
0.05. To correct for multiple testing we used a Bonferroni correction limited to the groups of tests for one

phenotype in a population. Calculations were carried out
with the SAS software (version 9.1.3). Haplotype frequencies were estimated with EM algorithm and common haplotypes (frequency > 0.03) were analyzed with
Haploview. Considering the population sample, this
study has 90% power to find odds ratio as small as 1.30.

Results
Using HapMap data, all 11 SNPs in the MMP-9 gene
could be allocated to four blocks of correlated SNPs
showing high levels of linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8)
with each other (figure 1) as described in the methods
section. One tagging SNP per LD block was selected for
genotyping in a cross sectional study population of German children from Munich, Dresden and Leipzig (n =
4,264). Genotyping success rates (call rates) ranged from

91.7% to 96.0% and no significant deviation from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed (table 1).
First, associations of the four tagging SNPs with main
phenotypes asthma and current wheezing were assessed
(table 2). SNP rs2664538 showed a trend for an
increased risk to develop current wheezing. When analyses were performed for atopic and non-atopic wheezing, association effects were identified especially for
non-atopic wheeze. In children homozygous for the
polymorphic allele at rs2664538, odds ratios (OR) for
non-atopic wheezing was 2.12 (95%CI 1.40-3.21, p <
0.001). Additionally, SNP rs2664538 showed a significant
association with non-atopic asthma (OR 1.66, 95%CI
1.12-2.46, p = 0.011). SNPs rs3918241, rs3918256 and
rs3787268 showed also an increased risk for the carriers
of the homozygous genotype in non-atopic wheeze or

non-atopic asthma. When specific IgE of more than 0.35
IU/ml was used to define atopy instead of prick test
results, very similar results were observed. In homozygous for the polymorphic allele at rs2664538, odds ratios
(OR) for non-atopic wheezing and non-atopic asthma
would be 1.92 (95%CI 1.20-3.07, p = 0.006) and 1.50
(95%CI 0.95-2.38, p = 0.083), respectively.
When the same 4 SNPs were analyzed separately in
the Dresden, Munich or Leipzig population, associations
with non-atopic asthma were strongest in Dresden and
similar trends for non-atopic asthma were also found in
the other two populations for SNP rs2664538. In contrast, a significant protective effect with atopic wheeze
was observed for the minor allele of rs3787268 in
Leipzig.
Also, lung function parameters had been recorded in a
random sample of approximately half of the study population from Munich and Dresden and thus, the effects of
MMP-9 SNPs on lung function at age 9-11 could be
analyzed (table 3).
In non-atopic children, homozygote polymorphic individuals for SNP rs3918241 showed a trend for lower
expiratory flows (MMEF% and MEF 25%). However,
these effects do not remain significant after correction
for multiple testing, and no effect was observed for
other lung function measurements such as FEV1, FVC
or BHR (data not shown).
SNPs rs2664538, rs3918256 and rs3787268 did not
influence lung function parameters significantly. No significant effects on the development of atopy or total
serum IgE levels were observed. Haplotype analyses did
not contribute additional information to the analysis not

observed in the single gene analysis and thus, data are
not shown here.

Discussion
Our systematic study of MMP-9 variations suggests that
polymorphisms in the MMP-9 gene have significant
effects on non-atopic forms of asthma. The very specific
effects of genetic variations in the MMP-9 gene may
help to dissect different forms of asthma and elucidate
the diversity in the mechanisms leading to airway diseases such as non-atopic asthma and other common,
non-atopic forms of childhood wheezing.
Based on the location of promoter SNP rs3918241, a
cis regulatory effect on MMP-9 may be suggested. Polymorphism rs3918241 is located exactly in the core
sequence of a GATA motif (GTAAAGGAAG[T/A]
TAATTATCTC), which may be capable to bind GATA
factors, master regulatory transcription factors for the
differentiation and perpetuation of human Th2 cells.
The variation rs2664538 (Q279R) is located in the
MMP-9 fibronectin II domain (figure 2), which presumably enhances the binding of MMP-9 to its substrate,
the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) [30]. Using FASTSNP
software [31] to predict functional effects of the amino
acid change from glutamine to arginine induced by
rs2664538, this gene variation seems highly likely to
change protein structure and exonic splicing.
Previous in vivo studies had also shown that
rs2664538 is associated with lower MMP-9 levels [19]
and decreased substrate binding [30]. Consistent with
our findings, lower MMP-9 levels in sputum have also
been associated with airway wall thickening [7] and

airflow obstruction. MMP-9 down regulation leads to
airway wall thickening, presumably by insufficient degradation and clearance of extra-cellular matrix. In the airways of adult patients with asthma, ECM deposition is
not only present in the basal membrane but also around
smooth muscle cells and in the adventitial layer, which
may gather volume and contribute significantly to the
airway wall thickening [32]. By decreasing MMP-9 activity, rs2664538 may directly affect these mechanisms by a
decrease in ECM clearance and the subsequent increase
in airway wall thickening.
While the evidence for a direct biological effect of
SNP rs2664538 is rather convincing, it may still be
argued that rs2664538 may only be a proxy for another
SNP within the MMP-9 gene or a neighboring gene,
which is responsible and causal for the observed effects.
Indeed, rs2664538 is in strong LD (r 2 = 1.00) with
C570T, a further SNP in intron 1 of the MMP-9 gene.
However, by performing extensive in silico analysis of
the region and the C570T SNP itself using phylogenetic
comparisons and transcription factor bind prediction as
described in the online supplement, no evidence for a

functional role in regulation or transcription factor
binding could be allocated to the intron 1 region or the
polymorphism (figure 3).
Promoter SNP rs3918241, which was associated with
lung function changes in non-atopic children, is in LD
with other MMP-9 coding variants with putative function. Of the 5 SNPs in LD with rs3918241, two are
located in intronic and non-conserved regions, two are
exonic variations leading to amino acid changes and one
is located in the 3’ flanking region. SNPs rs2274756
(P574R) and rs3918261 (R668Q) are located in the
hemopexin domain, which may down-regulate the bioavailability of active MMP-9. Furthermore, the interactions with receptors are proposed to be the original
function of hemopexin domains in MMPs. Considering
LD, this study cannot discriminate which of the linked
polymorphisms is responsible for the effect observed
between the tagging SNP and lung function parameters.
LD assessments between MMP-9 and neighboring
genes did not reveal a significant LD pattern in the
region harboring MMP-9 on chromosome 20[23] (data
not shown). Thus, it seems very likely that rs2664538

Figure 2 Localization of coding SNPs on a model structure of MMP-9. The studied MMP-9 variations rs3918241 (Q279R), is shown in context
of MMP-9 structure. Q279 is located in the fibronectin type II domain.

could indeed be responsible for some of the observed
effects, potentially due to its direct influences on MMP9 activity as previously suggested.
It is not obvious why genetic variants in the MMP-9
gene are almost exclusively associated with non-atopic
forms of wheezing. Without analyzing atopic as well as
non-atopic forms of asthma or wheeze, the effects
would not have been detected in our population. Thus,

it is not surprising that a previous study was unable to
identify an effect of MMP-9 variations in unstratified
asthma[33], as in that case-control study atopic and
non-atopic asthma were not analyzed separately. Also
not surprisingly, genome wide association studies on
asthma had missed the signal; potentially due to the
very same reason or to the fact that the SNP effects are
not strong enough for GWAS significance levels [34].

The nature of non-atopic wheeze in school children
remains unclear. In particular, the etiological factors of
such disease and differences of its characteristics with
atopic asthma need confirmation. An understanding of
whether different genetic variations influence atopic and
non-atopic wheeze in later childhood could also provide
fresh insight into the mechanisms underlying childhood
wheezing. Kurukulaaratchy et al showed that non-atopic
wheezing is as frequent as atopic wheezing in an unselected cohort of 10 year old British children[35]. BHR
and being diagnosed as asthmatic were significantly
more frequent in children with atopic asthma. Characterization of risk factor profiles for these two states
revealed different patterns. Heredity in the form of
maternal asthma also had a significant effect on the presence of non-atopic wheeze [36]. Clough et al showed
that atopic school children with wheeze had lower FEV1
and greater BHR than non-atopic children [37]. All
these findings, as well as our results showed that atopic
and non-atopic wheezing seem to be different disorders
with similar clinical presentation.
It may be hypothesized that different effects on atopic
and non-atopic forms of wheezing may be due to the in
part contrasting effects of MMP-9 in inflammation and
remodeling. While ECM degradation protects from airway
remodeling, degradation of ECM also facilitates the influx
of inflammatory cells to the airways in allergic inflammation. On the other hand, MMP-9 (and MMP-2) have previously been shown to be essential factors in the clearance
of lung inflammatory cells from the airways [15,18]. Considering these data and our findings, one may hypothesize
that lower levels of MMP-9 are associated with decreased
influx of eosinophils in atopic inflammation, outbalancing
the increase in airway remodeling also due to lower
MMP-9 levels and neutralizing the effect on a population
level. However, this cannot explain why MMP-9 is acting
differently in atopic and non-atopic inflammation and why
the negative effect of increased remodeling due to changes
in a matrix metalloproteinase becomes more important in
the non-atopic asthma.

Conclusions
These results suggest that different wheezing disorders
in childhood are affected differently by genetic alterations in the MMP9 gene and show the need to better
study the role of metalloproteinases in airway inflammation and wheezing.
