Potential pitfalls in MitoChip detected
tumor-specific somatic mutations: a call for
caution when interpreting patient data
Malliya Gounder Palanichamy1,2*, Ya-Ping Zhang1,2*

Abstract
Background: Several investigators have employed high throughput mitochondrial sequencing array (MitoChip) in
clinical studies to search mtDNA for markers linked to cancers. In consequence, a host of somatic mtDNA
mutations have been identified as linked to different types of cancers. However, closer examination of these data
show that there are a number of potential pitfalls in the detection tumor-specific somatic mutations in clinical case
studies, thus urging caution in the interpretation of mtDNA data to the patients. This study examined
mitochondrial sequence variants demonstrated in cancer patients, and assessed the reliability of using detected
patterns of polymorphisms in the early diagnosis of cancer.
Methods: Published entire mitochondrial genomes from head and neck, adenoid cystic carcinoma, sessile serrated
adenoma, and lung primary tumor from clinical patients were examined in a phylogenetic context and compared
with known, naturally occurring mutations which characterize different populations.
Results: The phylogenetic linkage analysis of whole arrays of mtDNA mutations from patient cancerous and noncancerous tissue confirmed that artificial recombination events occurred in studies of head and neck, adenoid
cystic carcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma, and lung primary tumor. Our phylogenetic analysis of these tumor and
control leukocyte mtDNA haplotype sequences shows clear cut evidence of mixed ancestries found in single
individuals.
Conclusions: Our study makes two prescriptions: both in the clinical situation and in research 1. more care should
be taken in maintaining sample identity and 2. analysis should always be undertaken with respect to all the data
available and within an evolutionary framework to eliminate artifacts and mix-ups.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA technology plays an exciting role in
medical research especially the high throughput MitoChip for mtDNA mutation detection in cancer. In the
past few years the MitoChip technique has uncovered a
large number of mtDNA mutations in human head and
neck, adenoid cystic carcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma,
and lung primary tumors [1-6]. The majority of the MitoChip detected mutations were somatic (dominant in
tumor cells) and it has been suggested that these mutations may be used as markers for the early diagnosis of
cancer [2]. However, many of these early stages MitoChip

detected cancer mutations require accurate validation
before put into routine clinical practice. Many recorded
mtDNA mutations in cancer samples are not fully reliable. Employing a phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA
tumor profiles taken from a specific example in the literature, we demonstrate the pitfalls of using MitoChip
identified mitochondrial mutations for clinical diagnosis
of premalignant cancers.

Methods
The advent of MitoChip technology has allowed researchers to explore mtDNA for markers for primary cancers
[1]. Mithani, Maitra, Sui, Zhou, and colleagues, for example, have extensively used the MitoChip platform for
mutation detection in primary cancer samples and uncovered a potentially large number of somatic mutations

[1-6]. To validate the recorded somatic mutations in cancer patients we compared their mtDNA sequence with the
currently available complete mtDNA database [7-14].
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is exclusively maternally
inherited, thus different mtDNA lineages cannot mix or
recombine: the only way that the mtDNA sequence can
change is by the sequential accumulation of mutations
along radiating maternal lineages. Therefore, the mutations seen in tumors samples arise on a background of a
fixed mitochondrial germline haplotype-defining mutation.
With this general concept, we first traced the lineage associated mtDNA mutations observed in tumors and normal
tissue samples by comparing the mutation motif with the
published world mtDNA phylogenies [15]. Then, the
mutations corresponding to haplotype lineages were
paired with their normal tissue sample. If a tumor sample
was distinguished from the corresponding normal tissue
sample by the mutations that distinguish two different
mtDNA lineages, then we could directly interpret that
sample mix-up would produce the result, because the
mutational processes involved in cancer could hardly produce, by chance, the mutations of evolutionary history.

Results
Recently, one hundred forty two mitochondrial mutations were identified from 22 adenoid cystic carcinoma
patients, among these, three patients (#5, #6, and #21, see
Mithani et al. [6] supplementary table S1) accounted for
66% (94/142) of the total mutations [6]. More nonsynonymous amino-acid-changing mutations were found in the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase
(NADH) complex suggesting that these changes play a
role in tumor development. Surprisingly the tumorrelated somatic mtDNA mutations belonged to an evolutionary pathway in the mtDNA phylogeny. The leukocyte
mtDNA sequences of patient 5, 6, and 21 belong to haplogroups K1a4a1a, J2a1a1, and H1, whereas the respective tumor sequence mutation themselves belong to
different haplogroups: F1c, H1c3, and K1a4a1 respectively (Figure 1). Clearly what we see here are not somatic
mutations but different mtDNA lineages stemming from
different individuals which were exchanged with each
other and attributed to the patients in question.
Zhou et al. [3] sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of 83 primary head and neck tumor samples (Head
and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma-HNSCC), and identified 228 mutations by comparison with matched normal
blood leukocyte DNA (see their supporting information
table 2). Subsequently Mithani et al. [5] obtained the
complete mtDNA sequence from salivary rinses of 13
HNSCC patients and found that salivary rinse mtDNA
mutations were congruent with the sequenced leukocyte
DNA (see their supplementary table 1), suggesting that
salivary rinses of patients may also be useful in tumor

risk assessment. Both the studies listed a large number of
homoplasmic somatic changes, in particular sample
numbers #2, #4, (Mithani et al. [5]), #1736, #1836, #2455,
#2714, and #2828 (Zhou et al. [3]). Surprisingly, the phylogenetic analysis indicates that those listed tumor specific somatic mutations are known to follow the pathways
of the African, Western Eurasian and East Asian mtDNA
phylogeny. The samples #1736 and #2828 tumor
sequence signify African lineages L3e2b1a and L3d1,
whereas the leukocyte sequences follow the pathways of
western Eurasian haplogroups R and H (Figure 1). Similarly, other tumor samples #2, #4, #1836, #2455, and
#2714 sequences variants were found in the western Eurasian and East Asian haplogroup V1a, U4b, U5a, and C1;
in contrast, leukocyte sequence information points to the
haplogroups H, HV, J1c5, R (Figure 1). It seems in these
cases, large numbers of homoplasmic mtDNA alterations
found in HNSCC patients are best attributed to sample
mix-up.
Another paper by Sui et al. [2] aimed to demonstrate the
existence of somatic mtDNA alterations in preneoplastic
lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, they
detected a high number (N = 35) of somatic mutations
from a single sessile serrated adenoma patient (see their
additional file 1, case 11), and add that their evidence supports the hypothesis that mtDNA alterations play a role in
gastrointestinal neoplasia. However, we observe that many
of the mtDNA alterations in tumor tissue are congruent
with the African mtDNA haplogroups L1b1a3a (C6548T,
T6827C, A6989G, A7055G, T7389C, C7915T, A8248G,
C16270T and heteroplasmic mutations 12519, 12693,
14203, 16126) and L2a (A7146G, C8468T, C8655T,
T10810C, and heteroplasmic mutations 11914, 11944,
13506, 13590, 13803, 15301), respectively. In addition, the
heteroplasmic variants 13958 and 15849 are also found in
the L2c haplogroup. Similarly, the mtDNA sequence of
normal tissue showed mixed patterns. For example the
four mutations - T12519C, A14203G, T16126C, C16264T
have been found in haplogroup L1b lineages, and two
other variants A9221G and C13506T have been recorded
in haplogroup L2 lineages. Here, we see that sample mixup generated the heteroplasmic and somatic mutations in
case 11 (Figure 2). Furthermore, the authors observed one
cytochrome oxidase subunit I polymorphism, - A7146G,
in 3 adenomas (case 9, 10, and 11), and suggest a pathogenic role. Actually the heteroplasmic polymorphisms
found in the case 9 and 10 result from mixing-up the samples of two lineages- L1b and L2, while the variant
A7146G is belongs to the haplogroup L2. This effectively
rules out a pathogenic role for A7146G polymorphism in
adenomas.
Bandelt et al. [16] demonstrate another case of sample
mix-up in Maitra et al. [1] data. The sample JHU-MITO
# 12 tumor sequence belongs to haplogroup L3e3b,

Figure 1 The mtDNA phylogenetic tree constructed on tumor cases: The Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma-HNSCC patients
#1736, #1836, #2455, #2714, and #2828 are from Zhou et al. [3], and patients #2 and #4 are from Mithani et al. [5]; and the Adenoid
Cystic Carcinoma-ACC patients #5, #6, and #21 are from Mithani et al. [6]. All mutations are scored relative to the rCRS (revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence) [20], prefix h indicates heteroplasmy and a suffix indicates a transversion, d-indicates deletion. Tum, Leu, and Lym-indicates
Tumor, Leukocyte and Lymphocyte respectively. âÐâ signifies haplogroup specific variants which were found in the patients. Recurrent mutations
are underlined. The names of haplogroups are given at the branching points or along single branches. Designation of haplogroups follows van
Oven and Kayser [15].

whereas lymphocyte sequence variants point to the haplogroup HV0a (refer Bandelt et al. [16] Figure 1) which
clearly shows that two mtDNA lineages were attributed
to the same patient. In addition, there are numerous
cases from cancer research where the sample mix-up
could have lead to the false detection of a high percentage of tumor-specific somatic mtDNA mutations, as
Salas and colleagues have pointed out [16-18].

Discussion
The use of mitochondrial DNA mutation and/or polymorphisms patterns to serve as markers is a rapidly
expanding discipline in cancer clinical research [19].
With the advent of high-throughput techniques for the
detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations such as
MitoChip, increasingly researchers have been able to

sequence entire mitochondrial genomes to promote an
understanding of the mtDNA variants of tumor patients
[1]. With MitoChip technology, a large number of
somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome have
recently been reported in head and neck, adenoid cystic
carcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma, and lung primary
tumors [1-6]. The majority of the somatic mutations
were reported from the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) complex and many were
nonsynonymous amino acid-changing mutations. The
investigators of these studies then suggest as a mechanism that the high incidence of amino acid changing
mutations in the NADH complex causes increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and subsequently
increases mtDNA mutation and dysfunction, which creates conditions which favor tumors cell growth [2,3,6].

additional information, see the fig. 1 legend.

In fact from our phylogenetic analysis, we can see that
those predicted mtDNA mutations in the tumor cases
were actually the result of sample mix-up or contamination. It is an unfortunate fact that many clinical geneticists are not aware of existing mtDNA phylogenetic
tools and their power to elucidate medical data. We
emphasize that careful assessment of newly identified
mtDNA sequence variants must be undertaken in clinical studies before the start of large scale tumor diagnostic mtDNA genotyping projects. While researchers put
much effort in a priori quality control and it is also
important to put equal effort into a posteriori control by
performing phylogenetic analysis. In clinical oncogenetics studies-this could help establish which mtDNA
variants are truly associated with tumors.

Conclusions
Identifying mtDNA markers related to cancers could be
very helpful, but data should be collected, analyzed, and
interpreted with special care. Our analysis demonstrates

that a significant proportion of recorded somatic
mtDNA alterations in tumor patients are attributable to
sample mix-up.
