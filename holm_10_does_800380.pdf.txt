Physcomitrella patens (Bryophyta) comprise a
single loop?

Abstract
Background: The endogenous circadian clock allows the organism to synchronize processes both to daily and
seasonal changes. In plants, many metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, as well as photoperiodic responses, are
under the control of a circadian clock. Comparative studies with the moss Physcomitrella patens provide the
opportunity to study many aspects of land plant evolution. Here we present a comparative overview of clockassociated components and the circadian network in the moss P. patens.
Results: The moss P. patens has a set of conserved circadian core components that share genetic relationship and gene
expression patterns with clock genes of vascular plants. These genes include Myb-like transcription factors PpCCA1a
and PpCCA1b, pseudo-response regulators PpPRR1-4, and regulatory elements PpELF3, PpLUX and possibly PpELF4.
However, the moss lacks homologs of AtTOC1, AtGI and the AtZTL-family of genes, which can be found in all vascular
plants studied here. These three genes constitute essential components of two of the three integrated feed-back loops
in the current model of the Arabidopsis circadian clock mechanism. Consequently, our results suggest instead a single
loop circadian clock in the moss. Possibly as a result of this, temperature compensation of core clock gene expression
appears to be decreased in P. patens.
Conclusions: This study is the first comparative overview of the circadian clock mechanism in a basal land plant, the
moss P. patens. Our results indicate that the moss clock mechanism may represent an ancestral state in contrast to the
more complex and partly duplicated structure of subsequent land plants. These findings may provide insights into the
understanding of the evolution of circadian network topology.
Background
The importance of timing of biological processes to the
day-night cycle is reflected in the ubiquity and independent evolution of circadian clock mechanisms in different
taxa [1]. The endogenous circadian clock allows the
organism to synchronize processes both to daily and seasonal changes. In plants, many processes such as photosynthesis that exhibit a daily rhythm are under the
control of a circadian clock. The circadian system is also
important to track seasonal changes, e.g. the anticipation
of spring or autumn to induce reproduction [2]. Even
though circadian clocks in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals have evolved largely independently and thus are

composed of different sets of genes, these clocks show a
common structure or underlying principle. Recent experimental data and modeling suggests that circadian systems are complex networks of several interlocked
feedback loops and interconnected input and output circuits [3,4]. These loops contain both positive and negative elements on transcriptional and post transcriptional
levels [5,4].
Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) has been the main
plant model in studies of plant circadian clocks, and the
first identified feedback loop contained two closely
related and partly redundant Myb-like transcription factors CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and
LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) forming a
negative feedback loop with TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1 also referred to as PRR1) [6]. Experimental data have since shown that additional loops are

needed to explain observed data. Mathematical modeling
and empirical studies suggest that CCA1/LHY also form
a second loop with PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR
7 (PRR7) and PRR9 which both belong to the same family
as TOC1. In addition, an evening phased loop is predicted including TOC1 and a factor that has been suggested to be GIGANTEA (GI) [7-9].
CCA1 and LHY are important regulators of circadian
rhythm in Arabidopsis, not only involved in regulating
the expression of TOC1, but also in mediating light input
to the core oscillator [10-12]. CCA1/LHY regulate several
output genes of the circadian clock by binding to the evening element of the promoter of these genes [13].
TOC1, or PRR1, share domains with the other PRR
proteins (PRR9/7/5/3). The pseudo receiver domain is
similar to the phospho-accepting domain found in
authentic response regulators, and the plant specific CCT
motif (CO, COL and TOC1) contains a putative nuclear
localization signal and has also been shown to mediate
protein-protein interactions [14,15]. PRR9, PRR7 and
PRR5 have, besides regulatory roles close to the Arabidopsis core oscillator, also functions in the response of
the clock to both light and temperature [16-18].
Simulations and experimental data suggest that GI is a
component of the circadian core oscillator with rhythm
defect phenotypes of mutants in both continuous light
(LL) and continuous dark (DD) [19,20]. GI also has an
important role in the photoperiodic control of flowering
as it induces the circadian expression of CONSTANS
(CO) in the late afternoon during long days in Arabidopsis [20]. In addition, GI has a function in temperature
compensation of the circadian clock as a functional GI
has been shown to extend the range of temperatures at
which robust rhythmicity can be maintained [21].
Further components associated with core clock function in Arabidopsis include LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX),
EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), EARLY FLOWERING 3
(ELF3), and members of the ZTL gene family, ZEITLUPE
(ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2) and FLAVINBINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1). ZTL has
been shown to have a functional role in core clock function by controlling the cyclical degradation of TOC1
[22,23]. This is achieved by a blue light dependent protein
interaction with GI, which stabilizes the ZTL protein
[24]. LKP2 may have a similar role, although its effect on
circadian clock function appears to be smaller [24,25].
FKF1 seems not to have a role in clock function itself but
acts down stream of the core oscillator. The FKF1 protein
is also stabilized by protein-protein interaction with GI,
and regulates flowering time by targeted degradation of
CDF2, a repressor of CO transcription [26-29]. Thus, all
members of the ZTL family of proteins have functional
roles closely associated to the evening phased loop comprising TOC1 and GI.

The Myb transcription factor LUX ARRHYTHMO,
however, has been shown to interact with components of
the morning-phased loop. While LUX is required for the
expression of the core clock genes LHY and CCA1, the
LUX promoter also contains an evening element, indicating that LUX itself is under negative control by LHY and
CCA1 [30]. In Arabidopsis, ELF4 has been proposed to
have a function in the core clock and recent experimental
data suggest that ELF4 likely has two inputs, at both
PRR9/PRR7 and GI/LUX, and functions to repress the
light-induced expression of these components of both the
morning- and evening-phased loops [31,32]. ELF3 acts in
the gating of light input to the core oscillator and is necessary for light induced expression of CCA1/LHY; as
such, ELF3 contributes to the resetting of the clock each
day [33,34,32]. In addition, a recent study has demonstrated the dual role of ELF3 by showing that the protein
regulates both circadian rhythm and flowering time in
Arabidopsis by interacting with COP1 and thus mediating the cyclical degradation of GI [35]. Although a specific placement of ELF3 in the plant circadian network
has not yet been determined, the ELF3 protein seems to
interact with components of both the morning- and evening phased circuits of the current three-loop model.
Comparative studies of clock associated components
and the circadian systems in photosynthesizing organisms have been carried out in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri [36-38], and
in several seed plants, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum
[39], Glycine max [40], Phaseolus vulgaris [41], Pisum
sativum [42], Lemna gibba and Lemna paucicostata
[43,44], Oryza sativa [[45] and references therein], Castanea sativa [46,47], Populus nigra [48] and Picea abies
[[49] and unpublished data, our lab]. The consensus
result of studies in seed plants is that homologs to core
clock genes in Arabidopsis are present and furthermore
appear to display a high degree of functional conservation. However, the situation is different in the algae C.
reinhardtii and O. tauri. Beside implicated similarities in
the phototransduction (CRYPTOCHROMES) and kinase
pathways (CKI and CKIIs), that constitute important
input and regulatory components of the circadian clock,
homology to core clock genes in Arabidopsis is limited to
Myb-related and PRR family-like proteins [36-38] (Additional file 1).
As a representative of Bryophytes that separated from
the lineage leading to vascular plants more than 400 MYA
[50], Physcomitrella patens provides the opportunity to
study many aspects of land plant evolution. Circadian
rhythms and photoperiodic responses are known from all
categories of plants from algae and mosses to higher
plants. In P. patens, as in higher plants, photoperiod
affects the switch from vegetative growth to reproduction, as short days (SD) induce sporophyte development

Holm et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:109

in Physcomitrella [51]. Diurnal rhythms in expression
have also been observed for some P. patens genes
involved in photosynthesis [52,53]. Furthermore, the
presence of CONSTANS-like (COL) genes with a diurnal
expression pattern has been reported [54,4]. These genes
are related to the central regulator of flowering time, CO
in Arabidopsis, but their involvement in photoperiodic
induction of reproduction in P. patens is not supported by
available data [[54,55]; our own unpublished data].
Finally, two homologs to known circadian clock genes in
higher plants, PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, have recently
been characterized in P. patens [56].
To systematically identify putative photoperiod pathway and circadian clock components in P. patens and to
study the evolution of the circadian clock, genes associated with the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis (Additional file 1) were used in BLAST searches against the
genome sequence of selected plant species representing
algae, non-vascular plants, non-seed vascular plants as
well as seed plants. Identified putative P. patens clock
genes were further characterized by phylogenetic analyses and by assessing their temporal expression profiles in
photoperiod and free-running conditions.

Results
Database searches in sequenced genomes representing
algae, mosses, lycophytes, and angiosperms identified a
limited set of homologs to genes implicated in circadian
clock in non-land plants, while homologs to a majority of
the included Arabidopsis clock associated genes were
identified in all land plants (Additional file 1), with a few
striking exceptions in moss (see below). These data suggest that a majority of the components in the circadian
clock present in higher plants arose with the evolution of
land plants. To study the evolution of the circadian clock
of land plants in more detail, we focused on P. patens representing the earliest land plant with a sequenced
genome, with the aim of identifying the putative core circadian clock genes present early in the evolution land
plants. We focused on a set of genes for which there is
strong evidence for a circadian clock function in higher
plants.
All studies of diurnal and circadian expression of Physcomitrella genes have thus far observed clear cycling
under light-dark cycles (LD) and/or in DD, but rapid
dampening of the rhythm in LL [[52-56]; our own unpublished data]. This is in contrast to the situation in Arabidopsis, where endogenous expression rhythms can more
readily be measured in LL whereas they dampen more
quickly in DD [14,40,31,34]. It is perhaps premature to
state that the circadian clock in Physcomitrella is dysfunctional in LL, as has been suggested [56], and more
studies of clock behavior in LL are needed. However, in

Selaginella moellendorffii that share significant sequence
homology to CCA1/LHY (Figure 1B). Two predicted protein sequences containing related single Myb domains
were also found in C. reinhardtii. The DNA-binding
domain in Chlre4-402780 was identical to the Myb
domain in the previously described ROC40 [37]. A putative CCA1 homolog has also recently been identified and
characterized in O. tauri [38]. In P. patens, two orthologs
have been identified and characterized, PpCCA1a and
PpCCA1b [58,56]. In the present study, PpCCA1a and
PpCCA1b show stable circadian expression patterns in
LD and for 48 hrs in DD without any apparent dampening (Figure 1C). The rhythmic pattern was statistically
significant with COSOPT pMMC-β values at 0.026 for
PpCCA1a and 0.030 for PpCCA1b (a listing of all statistical test results can be found in Additional file 2). In addition, phases are well superimposed onto those of AtCCA1
and AtLHY with peaks close to dawn.

Estimated fold change

The receiver domain at the N-terminal of the pseudoresponse regulators, TOC1/PRR1 and PRR9/7/5/3, differ
from the authentic response regulators, the ARR-family,
by lacking an aspartate at the phospo-accepting site of the
domain [59]. In addition, the PRRs include a CCT motif
at the C-terminal of the polypeptide (Figure 2A).
Orthologs to TOC1 and the PRR family of proteins have
been identified and extensively characterized in O. sativa
[60,45]. One TOC1-like sequence, Selmo1_438647, and
its allelic variant, Selmo1_447266 (not shown in tree 2B),
are annotated as predicted proteins in the Selaginella
genome database, although both gene annotations contain a stop codon before the C-terminal CCT domain.
Four additional S. moellendorffii sequences positioned on
scaffold_88:201505-204488 and scaffold_62:750390752881, including their probable allelic variants located
on
scaffold_42:1313168-13161115
and
scaffold_20:1992667-1995113, cluster within the remaining PRR sequences (Figure 2B). These are not annotated
as predicted proteins and lack protein ID numbers,
because they appear as fused together with other genes.
Even if it cannot be determined at present whether these
putative proteins are expressed and translated, it appears
obvious that the corresponding nucleotide sequences are
present in the S. moellendorffii genome. In version 4.0 of
the Chlamydomonas genome database, only one predicted amino acid sequence displays resemblance to the
domain structure of the TOC1/PRR family of proteins,
Chlre4-166515 [Additional file 1]. This protein clusters
with a recently identified and described PRR-like protein
in another unicellular green alga, Ostreococcus tauri [38].
This protein, Ot-AY740079, also shares domain structure
with the TOC1/PRR family of proteins and has a clearly
shown function within the O. tauri circadian clock [38].

However, although the O. tauri protein is referred to as a
TOC1-homologue, the phylogenetic analysis reveals a
distant relationship to the remaining TOC1/PRR family
of proteins (Figure 2B). This suggests that the algal proteins constitute sister lineages to the whole TOC1/PRR
family, and that it is not possible from presently available
data to determine whether these proteins are more
closely related to the TOC1-group, or the group consisting of the remaining PRR proteins. We therefore choose
to refer to them as PRR family-like (Additional file 1).
Four pseudo-response regulator homologs have been
identified in P. patens, PpPRR1-4 [Figure 2B, [58]].
PpPRR1 to PpPRR4 are closely related and form a cluster
next to the S. moellendorffii PRRs in the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2B). Thus, no ortholog to TOC1 appears to exist

GIGANTEA

In Arabidopsis, GI is a 127-kD nuclear protein consisting
of 1173 amino acids. It does not contain any previously
described protein domains or motifs. Orthologs to GI
have been identified in O. sativa [61], and in addition, we
found two predicted protein sequences in S. moellendorffii, Selmo1-140066 and Selmo1-170553, that displayed significant sequence homology to AtGI
(Additional file 1). However, GI appear to be absent in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in O. tauri as previously
reported [Additional file 1, [36-38]].
Similarly, no searches for GI, on either nucleotide or
protein levels, yielded any hits against version 1.1 of the P.
patens genome database. We conclude that GI, or any GIlike sequences, are absent in the Physcomitrella genome.
LUX ARRYTHMO

LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX) or PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL),
contains a Myb-related DNA-binding domain similar to,
but distinct from those found in LHY and CCA1 [Figure
3A; [30,62]]. A LUX ortholog has been identified in O.
sativa [45] and one predicted protein in S. moellendorffii
displays sequence homology to AtLUX (Figure 3B). Two
proteins in C. reinhardtii, CrROC15 and CrROC75, also
include Myb DNA binding motifs that share homology
with AtLUX [37]. A search for putative P. patens
orthologs revealed four predicted protein sequences that
clustered together with OsPCL1 and AtLUX (Figure 3B).
Of these putative LUX orthologs, only Phypa-47310
showed a tendency to a circadian expression pattern (Figure 3C). Although the rhythmic expression pattern of

in P. patens. All putative response-regulators in P. patens
show stable rhythm under LD conditions, with very slight
dampening of amplitude in DD (COSOPT pMMC-β values ranging from 0.019 to 0.049) (Figure 2C, right panel).
However, under our sampling scheme, we could not
detect any differential expression of phase peaks among
PpPRR1 to PpPRR4, similar to the sequential expression
of phase displayed by the Arabidopsis quintet of PRR
genes [Figure 2C, left panel; [60]]. Rather, our data suggest that the closely related, and probably recently duplicated PpPRR1 to PpPRR4, have not diverged in terms of
their temporal gene expression pattern.
The emergence in vascular plants of a markedly
diverged TOC1 sub-family distinct from the other PRR
genes, suggests that positive Darwinian selection might
have been important in the evolution of TOC1 genes. To
test this hypothesis, we estimated dN/dS ratios in a phylogenetic tree including identified PRR and TOC1-like
genes from a diverse set of species (Additional file 3). The
results suggest that the branch leading to the TOC1 clade
has diverged due to adaptive evolution (2Δl = 6.75, p <
0.01) and 21.8% of the sites in the two conserved domains
show a significant signal of positive selection (Additional
file 3).

cycling with a phase peak very similar to that of AtLUX

(Figure 4A). Several gene products in both O. sativa and
S. moellendorffii show significant sequence homology to
AtELF4 (Figure 4B); however, the expression patterns of
the rice sequences were reported not to be under circadian control and thus not considered to be ELF4
orthologs [45]. A predicted protein incorporating the
DUF1313 domain is also present in C. reinhardtii [Addi-

The ELF3 protein does not contain any known functional
domains or motifs. Two gene products in O. sativa,
Os01g0566100 and Os06g01426000, show significant
sequence homology to AtELF3, however, their genes do
not display any circadian expression pattern in rice [45].
We found two sequences in S. moellendorffii with significant homology to ELF3, Selmo1-415241 and Selmo1411196 including their allelic variants Selmo1-443557
and Selmo1-443909, respectively (not shown in figure 5).
No ELF3 like proteins were found in the latest version of
the C. reinhardtii database [36]. A search of the P. patens
database produced three predicted proteins with significant sequence homology to AtELF3, that all cluster
together in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 5A). Of the three
putative ELF3-like genes, Phypa-66647 and Phypa165364 displayed an oscillating pattern in both LD and
DD (COSOPT pMMC-β values = 0.025 and 0.16, respectively), with a peak of phase that agreed well with expression data of ELF3 in Arabidopsis (Figure 5B).

tional file 1]. In our phylogenetic analysis of the DUF1313
protein sequences, AtELF4 clusters together with
AtEFL1, while AtEFL2-4 form a separate and more distantly related lineage (Figure 4B). This grouping is supported by recent detailed analyses of the Arabidopsis
DUF1313 proteins, where in addition, it was shown that
only AtEFL1 were able to fully complement the elf4 lossof-function phenotype [32]. One predicted protein in P.
patens, Phypa-49622, displays significant sequence
homology to the DUF1313 domain and clusters together
with the Selaginella sequences (Figure 4B). However, the
expression profile for Phypa-49622 displayed very weak
amplitude in DD and was out of phase with ELF4 in Arabidopsis (Figure 4C). Present data suggest that Phypa49622 is not likely to be a functional homolog of AtELF4.

ZTL, and its homologs LKP2 and FKF1, are unique F-box
proteins with a PAS/PAC domain at the N-terminal and a
series of Kelch repeats at the C-terminal [26,25,63]. The
PAS/PAC domain is a blue light receptor also found in
PHOTOTROPINS, whereas the F-box mediates ubiquitination of specific target proteins [64]. The Kelch repeats
form groups of beta sheets that interact with other proteins [65]. Six separate Kelch-repeats have been identified
in AtZTL and AtFKF1 [26,25,63]; however, for comparison we display only five repeats in figure 6, which is the
result obtained from the SMART database [95,96]. Three
proteins with domain structures similar to the ZTL family in Arabidopsis have been identified in O. sativa,
OsZTL1, OsZTL2 and OsFKF1 [45]. Two predicted proteins in S. moellendorffii with high sequence similarity,
Selmo1-174189 and Selmo1-185595, also share this typical domain structure. In accordance with previous studies, we could not detect any ZTL family-like proteins or
predicted protein sequences in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or O. tauri [Additional file 1, [36-38]]. Our scan of
the Physcomitrella genome revealed several proteins containing the above described functional domains, however,
the three domains were never present in the same predicted protein sequence. Instead, the PAS/PAC domain
was found in duplicates in several predicted phototropins, e.g. PpPHOTA1, PpPHOTB1 and PpPHOTB2. The
duplicate PAS/PAC domains also occurred in isolation, as
in Phypa-143199 and Phypa-4514 (Figure 6). F-boxes followed by Kelch-like repeats could be found in two predicted proteins in P. patens, Phypa-131411 and Phypa14114 but never with the PAS/PAC domain at the N-terminal (Figure 6). Thus, proteins with a domain architecture analogous to the one found in the Arabidopsis ZTL

ELF3 orthologs in P. patens. (A) An unrooted maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed from an alignment of conserved regions of ELF3-like amino acid sequences in A. thaliana, O. sativa, S.

family, in three annotated O. sativa proteins and in two
predicted S. moellendorffii protein sequences, appear to
be absent in P. patens.
Temperature compensation in P. patens

GI has been implicated in QTL mapping experiments and
mutant studies as a strong candidate for mediating tem-

perature compensation in the Arabidopsis circadian clock
[66,21]. It has been shown that GI critically affects clock
function under natural conditions by extending the range
of temperatures at which circadian rhythmicity can be
maintained and period length remains stable. In particular, it would appear that the GI/TOC1 loop participates
by regulating the expression levels of CCA1 and LHY at
both low (12°C) and high (27°C) temperatures [21]. Since
neither GI, nor a GI/TOC1 loop appear to be present in P.
patens, it could be hypothesized that the ability to compensate for changes in ambient temperature is either
maintained by other components related to the clock
mechanism, or is reduced in the moss. To test the temperature response of putative clock genes in P. patens,
cultures were sampled in parallel in constant dark (DD) in
three different temperatures, 12°C, 17°C and 25°C. Temperature was changed one day before the onset of DD at
ZT -24. Gene expression levels were measured for all
putative clock genes in P. patens (Figure 7A-J).
A decrease in amplitude and less well defined phase
peaks are evident in the expression pattern of all genes at
lower and higher temperatures. The broader phase peaks
are noticeable as early as the first day in DD, whereas the
loss of amplitude is more evident during the second day.
These indications of a less robust rhythmic pattern are
more pronounced at 12°C where several genes lose any
trace of rhythmic expression pattern (Figure 7C-E, H).
Although a slight decrease in amplitude can also be seen
during the second day at 17°C, most likely due to a lack of
photoperiodic input, most genes maintain a well-defined
phase peak at this temperature. The observed decay of
robust rhythm is reflected in the statistical analysis of the
time series data. At 17°C, expression patterns of
PpCCA1a-b, PpPRR1-4 and PpELF3L1 all display a significant circadian rhythm as reported by COSOPT
(pMMC-β values ≤ 0.05) (Additional file 2). The group of
significantly oscillating genes are reduced to PpCCA1a-b
and PpPRR1-2 at 25°C, whereas only PpCCA1a-b maintain significant rhythms at 12°C, as reported by either
COSOPT or Fisher's exact G test (Additional file 2).
Although estimates of period length reported by COS-

Figure 7 Time series expression pattern of putative clock genes in different temperatures. Normalized expression levels (CTtarget - CTreference) for
putative circadian clock genes in P. patens measured under three different temperatures in DD (constant dark). The light regime was identical to previous experiments (see legend to figure 1 for further details). Temperature was changed one day (ZT-24) before the onset of DD.

OPT are not to be taken at face value under the present
sampling scheme, it is notable that all significant expression patterns cluster together at 17°C with an estimated
period length of approximately 22 h (Additional file 4). In
summary, time series expression data suggest that the
temperature interval of robust circadian rhythm is more
narrow in P. patens compared to wild type Arabidopsis.
However, the comparatively robust rhythm and stable
period lengths of PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b at all temperatures may indicate a degree of temperature compensation
of these core components independent of GI or a GI/
TOC1 loop.

Discussion
The moss, P. patens, has a set of conserved clock-associated components, which share genetic relationship and
gene expression profiles with clock genes of higher
plants. These components include members of the Myb
family of transcription factors, PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b,
and four pseudo-response regulators, PpPRR1-4 [58,56].
Further putative clock genes present in the moss include
one LUX-like, as well as two ELF3 and possibly one ELF4like component of the Arabidopsis circadian mechanism
(see Additional file 1 for a comparative overview of clock
associated genes in Arabidopsis and P. patens). However,
we note that P. patens appears to lack any genes coding
for proteins orthologous to TOC1, GI or any of the ZTL
family of proteins, all of which are present in S. moellendoerffii. Genes orthologous to some or all of these genes
have also been reported in a number of seed plants, e.g.
the monocotyledons rice [61,45], two species of Lemna
[43,44], the angiosperms soybean [40], pea [42], chestnut
[46], and the gymnosperm Norway spruce [49].
None of the three core clock genes absent in the moss
are present in the green algae C. reinhardtii, as has been
previously reported [36,37] or O. tauri [38], if as we propose, OtTOC1 constitute a sister lineage to the whole
PRR gene-family rather than a TOC1 ortholog. The result
of the phylogenetic analysis of the pseudo-response regulator family of proteins implies that a common ancestor
of all PRR genes was likely present already in the green
algae C. reinhardtii and O. tauri [Figure 2B and Additional file 1, [37,38]]. This notion seems further supported by the fact that the OtPRR-like sequence is the
only pseudo-response regulator to date that display a
functional phosphate acceptor aspartyl residue, implying
recent divergence from the ARR family of proteins [38].
These data collectively suggests that the three core clock
genes have not been lost in the moss, but rather appeared
before, or simultaneously, with the emergence of the vascular plants.
The four PRR proteins in P. patens display a high degree
of sequence similarity and cluster tightly together among
the PRR proteins of higher plants, but are as a group well

Page 9 of 14

separated from the branch including the TOC1/PRR1s of
these plants (Figure 2B). The relatively recent expansion
of the P. patens PRR gene family is reflected in the expression profiles of PpPRR1-4; while the Arabidopsis PRR9/7/
3/5 and AtTOC1 display a serial distribution of phase
peaks suggesting functional divergence [17], the PRR
orthologs in P. patens have a very similar expression pattern with near identical phase peaks (Figure 2C).
Our data suggest that the TOC1/PRR1 orthologs in S.
moellendorffii, O. sativa and Arabidopsis represent a
more recent and functionally divergent variant among the
two component pseudo-response regulators. A functional divergence of the TOC1-like genes compared the
other PRR genes is supported by the elevated dN/dS ratio
inferred on the branch separating the PRR and TOC1
genes. It suggests that a PRR gene duplication in the lineage leading to present day vascular plants was followed
by positive selection on one of the copies possibly due the
recruitment of new genes and features to the circadian
clock. It is tempting to speculate that the adaptive evolution of TOC1 is coupled with the occurrence of GI and
ZTL with which TOC1 closely interact.
While proteins with a domain architecture analogous
to the ZTL family of proteins are also absent in the moss,
the functional domains of these proteins do appear in
other combinations; these sequences include predicted
phototropins and also F-box proteins followed by Kelch
repeats, but without the LOV domain at the N-terminal
(Figure 6). From sequence homology alone, we have not
been able to determine if any of these domains are more
closely related to corresponding domains of ZTL like proteins in higher plants. In any case, the emergence of ZTL
family-like proteins in S. moellendorffii suggest the formation of this novel protein architecture from the modular assembly of already existing functional domains,
possibly through mechanisms such as duplication followed by domain shuffling [67,68].
No trace of GI or GI-like sequences can be found at the
nucleotide or protein levels in available complete
genomes other than in S. moellendorffii and in representatives of higher plants (see references above). Although
gene duplication is considered one of the most common
and important mechanisms for the emergence of novel
genes, it is also known that each genome harbors a certain set of genes that cannot be associated with other
known genes and that often are of unclear origin [69].
Occasionally, these orphan, or de novo, genes can be
traced to ancestral noncoding DNA and intergenic
regions [70-72], but there are also instances, e.g. in Drosophila and rice, where the exact origin of functional genes
remains obscure [73,74]. It may be that the additional
sequencing of full genomes representing different phylogenetic lineages may help to reveal an origin of GI in
intergenic regions of early land plants or algae. However,

Holm et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/109

Page 10 of 14

there is also the rare possibility of horizontal gene transfer, which has been exemplified as occurring between
fungi and early plant lineages such as bryophytes and
lycophytes [75]. Presently, it would appear that GI is a de
novo gene with unclear origin in the land plant lineage.
In view of the current three-loop model of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, the components absent in P. patens, TOC1 and GI, comprise an entire feed-back loop,
also referred to as the evening-phased loop, or the evening oscillator [Figure 8A, 7]. In addition, TOC1 acts as
the second feed-back component together with CCA1/
LHY in the originally described central loop model of the
Arabidopsis clock. Thus, while the clock mechanism of
higher plants may at least comprise a three-loop design,
our findings imply a single-loop for the moss clock (Fig-

Figure 8 Core clock network comparison. Comparison of the core
clock network in Arabidopsis and the version of the core clock in P. patens proposed in this study. (A) Locke's three-loop model where the inferred but as yet unidentified component "X" linking the feedback
from TOC1 to LHY/CCA1 has been omitted for clarity. LUX has been
placed in the vicinity of the morning-phased loop since interactions
with LHY/CCA1 has been experimentally verified (see text for further
details). Similarly, the ZTL family of components has been placed by
the evening-phased loop. ELF4 has been positioned below the central
loop since recent results suggest that it interacts with components of
both the morning- and evening-phased loop (see text for further details). The positioning of ELF3 is relative since the exact means by which
it interacts with the input light pathway, and feed back rhythmic information from the core clock, is not yet fully understood. (B) A suggested
version of the P. patens circadian clock network. The single loop corresponds to the morning-phased loop of the Arabidopsis clock mechanism in seedlings and the "simplified slave version" of the Arabidopsis
root clock. PpELF3L1-2 refer to Phypa_66647 and Phypa_165364.
PpELF4L and PpLUXL refer to Phypa_49622 and Phypa_47310.

ure 8B). It is notable that ZTL, LKP2 and FKF1, with
known functions closely related to TOC1 and GI in Arabidopsis, also appear not to be present in P. patens. The
singular morning-phased loop in the P. patens circadian
mechanism would then consist of PpCCA1a/PpCCA1b
joined together with one or some of the PpPRRs present
in the moss (Figure 8B). Interestingly, such a hypothesized single-loop plant clock is entirely analogous to the
"simplified slave version" of the circadian clock described
in Arabidopsis roots. In roots, the morning-phased loop
is decoupled from the central- and evening-phased loops
and the clock appears to run only on the feed-back interaction between CCA1/LHY and PRR9/7 [76]. However,
in a recent study it was shown that double disruptants of
PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b in the moss still display rhythmic output of the plastid sigma factor PpSIG5 and a
member of the PpPRR-quartet [56]. This suggests the
presence of further components, and/or possibly additional unknown loops, other than a TOC1/GI loop, that
contribute to the maintenance of endogenous circadian
rhythm in P. patens. Recent experimental data illustrate a
similar situation in the Arabidopsis three-loop model,
where triple mutants prr9-10, prr7-11 and toc1-2, still
display detectable endogenous rhythm in LHY/CCA1
expression, although no feed-back loop should remain
intact [77]. To what extent known clock components
ELF3, ELF4 and LUX may contribute to this rhythm in
Arabidopsis is still unknown.
In Arabidopsis, the protein GI has a critical effect on
robustness of circadian rhythmicity and stability of
period length of clock output during prolonged fluctuations in temperature [21]. Our assay of temperature
response of putative clock genes in P. patens shows that
most genes lose their circadian expression at temperatures 12°C and 25°C in constant dark (Figure 7). The
decay of rhythmic expression pattern is most pronounced
at 12°C where only PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b maintain
significant circadian oscillation (Additional file 2 and 4).
One reason for this reduced level of temperature compensation may be the absent GI/TOC1 loop in the moss.
The proposed simpler loop structure of the circadian
clock in P. patens may have implications for the evolutionary origins and development of clock network topology. Hallmark features of endogenous circadian
oscillators include the ability to maintain period length
under constant conditions, to compensate for fluctuations in ambient variables, and yet be able to entrain, or
reset, the clock daily according to environmental cues of
e.g. light and temperature [78]. It has been pointed out
that the complex loop structure of different circadian
clock mechanisms may be a result of these inherently
conflicting evolutionary aims of simultaneous robustness
and sensitivity [79]. Mathematical modeling and simulation studies have shown that the degree of flexibility in an

Holm et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/109

interconnected metabolic system, for example its ability
to attain several aims simultaneously, depends less on the
number of components in such a system, than on the
structure of the network itself. Accordingly, there would
be a selective advantage in increasing loop number and
complexity, as well as on mechanisms that would enable
this, e.g. gene duplication [79,80]. In this perspective, the
circadian clock in P. patens may well represent an antecedent state comprising a single loop structure in contrast to the, in part, duplicated three-loop clock design of
subsequent land plants.

Conclusions
Although the Arabidopsis three-loop model has proven
to have greater realism than previous models, and provides a valuable framework for comparative studies, it is
not yet complete. It was initially pointed out that the
model in its proposed version did not account for all
known clock associated genes or interactions, and experimental data continues to imply the presence of unknown
components and possibly additional loops [7,81,77]. We
believe that the further study of a seemingly less complex
network system not only can provide important insights
into the evolution of circadian network topology, but in
addition, may help clarifying some of the remaining
issues of the circadian clock mechanism of higher model
plants.
Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions

Physcomitrella patens of the Gransden Wood wild type
strain was cultured as protonemal tissue on cellophane
covered BCD medium (0.8% agar, 1 mM MgSO4, 1.85
mM KH2PO4, 10 mM KNO3, 45 μM FeSO4, 1 mM CaCl2,
1× Hoagland's Number 2 solution), supplemented with 5
mM ammonium tartrate. All cultures were grown in
Sanyo MLR-350 growth chambers supplied with white
fluorescent tubes, Toshiba FL40SS W/37 (430-650 nm),
at 65-75 μmol m-2 s-1. Light/dark (LD) conditions used
were 16 h light/8 h dark, followed by constant dark (DD).
Cultures were grown at 20°C, and transferred to temperatures 12°C, 17°C and 25°C one day before the onset of DD
as noted in the text for each experiment. Cultures transferred to 17°C were sampled every 4th hour for 72 hours,
the first day under LD conditions, followed by two days in
DD. Cultures transferred to 12°C and 25°C were sampled
every 4th hour for 52 hours, two time points in light followed by 12 time points in DD, as indicated in each figure.
RNA sample preparation and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from each time point sample
using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). For each sample, 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA

Page 11 of 14

using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following the
manufacturer's instructions.
Quantitative RT-PCR assay for time-series analyses of gene
expression

cDNA samples were diluted 1:50 and amplified with the
DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Finnzymes) on a
MyiQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The
two-step cycling program was as follows: 95°C for 7 min,
followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min.
Melt curve analyses were performed after each amplification to ensure specificity of products. Each cDNA sample
was run in duplicates on separate plates. PCR efficiencies
were calculated for each amplification with the software
LinRegPCR [82]. Any wells showing strongly deviating
PCR efficiencies of either target or reference genes were
excluded from further analysis. We used transcription
level measurements for the P. patens beta-tubulin 1 gene
(Phypa_186458), as a reference to normalize target gene
transcription levels. The PpTUB1 reference gene displayed consistent amplification over all sample time
points and treatments without evidence of circadian
rhythmicity (Additional file 5). The CT values of duplicates were averaged, and the difference of the mean CT
values for reference and target genes (ΔCT) was calculated for each sample time point and treatment combination. Target and reference primer sequences are listed in
Additional file 6. The software COSOPT was used to
detect significant circadian expression patterns under
constant conditions (DD), under all temperatures, among
the genes in the P. patens time series data [83-85]. In
addition, a Fisher's exact g test, as implemented in the
statistical software R package GeneCycle http://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/GeneCycle/index.html,
was
used to search for any harmonic pattern with unknown
frequency in the time series expression data measured
under constant conditions [86,87]. Comparative expression data for Arabidopsis measured under diurnal and
circadian conditions were downloaded from the DIURNAL database [[88], http://diurnal.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/
].

ues ≤ 1e-10 and a domain structure similar to the one
found in Arabidopsis proteins. Conserved regions of predicted protein sequences were aligned with the software
MUSCLE [91]. Protein sequence phylogenies were analyzed with a maximum likelihood model as implemented
in PHYML 3.0 [92] and with a Bayesian inference method
as implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [93,94]. The SMART
database http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ was used for
analyses of annotated protein domains and motifs
[95,96]. Test for positive selection using dN/dS (ω) ratios
were performed on an alignment of selected PRR genes
from angiosperms (Additional file 3). We used the
branch-site test of positive selection as implemented in
PAML 4.3 [97]. Briefly, the branches of the tree are
divided into foreground (the one leading to the TOC1
clade) and background branches (all other branches).
Codon sites are separated into four classes with proportions p0, p1, p2a and p2b. Class 0 have ω < 1, and class 1 ω =
1 on both types of branches. Class 2a has ω < 1 on the
background branch and ω ≥ 1 on the foreground branch.
Finally, class 2b has ω = 1 on the background branch and
ω ≥ 1 on the foreground branch. The test for positive
selection is then obtained by comparing the likelihood of
this model to the same model except that ω is fixed to 1 in
site classes 2a and 2b on the foreground branch [97].
Twice the log likelihood difference between the two compared models (2Δl), was compared against χ2 with 1 df.
