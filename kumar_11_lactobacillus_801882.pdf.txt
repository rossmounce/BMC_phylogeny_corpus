Abstract
Background: Lactobacillus plantarum is considered as a safe and effective probiotic microorganism. Among various
sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in Lactobacillus spp., which can be
exploited for their probiotic attribute. Antibacterial property of L. plantarum has been demonstrated against various
enteric pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo systems. This study was aimed at characterizing L. plantarum isolated
from Kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented biomedicine, and assessing its antagonistic property against a common
enteropathogen Aeromonas veronii.
Results: We report the isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista, and efficacy of its cell free supernatant (CFS)
in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by Aeromonas veronii. On the part of probiotic attributes, VR1 was tolerant to
pH 2, 0.3% bile salts and simulated gastric juice. Additionally, VR1 also exhibited adhesive property to human
intestinal HT-29 cell line. Furthermore, CFS of VR1 was antibacterial to enteric pathogens like Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas veronii and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and E. coli.
Detailed study regarding the effect of VR1 CFS on A. veronii cytotoxicity showed a significant decrease in vacuole
formation and detrimental cellular changes in Vero cells. On the other hand, A. veronii CFS caused disruption of
tight junction proteins ZO-1 and actin in MDCK cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with CFS of VR1.
Conclusions: This is the first study to report isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista and characterisation for
its probiotic attributes. Our study demonstrates the antagonistic property of VR1 to A. veronii and effect of VR1 CFS
in reduction of cellular damage caused by A. veronii in both Vero and MDCK cell lines.

Background
Lactic acid bacteria is now widely used as probiont for
its multifactorial benefits to humans as well as to organisms like fish, poultry and other live stock. In addition
to various sources of isolation [1-3], several recent studies have described the isolation and characterisation of
probiotic microorganisms from traditionally fermented
sources like Dongchimi, Kimchi, Meju, and Doenjang
[4], and Kallappam batter, Koozh and Mor Kuzhambu
[5]. Likewise, traditional Ayurvedic medicines might

serve as a source and a reservoir of potential probiotic
microbes. Nevertheless, there are very little efforts made
in exploration of probionts from ayurvedic fermented
sources. To the best of our knowledge, Kanjika is the
only Ayurvedic source explored in detail for the isolation and in vitro characterisation of Lactobacillus spp.
for probiotic attributes [6]. In this study, Kutajarista is
used as a source for the isolation of potential probiotic
isolates. Kutajarista is a well known polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation prepared traditionally by fermentation
of the decoction of Holarrhena antidysentrica as the
main constituent [7]. It is being prescribed for a number
of chronic diseases like amoebic dysentery, piles,

intestinal parasites infestation and other disorders like
fever, indigestion, and malabsorption syndrome [8].
There are growing number of studies that show the
ability of Lactobacillus spp. to antagonize various pathogens, like enterohemorrhagic E. coli [9,10], Helicobacter
pylori [11], Salmonella typhimurium [12], Shigella dysenteriae [13], using in vitro and in vivo systems. Probiotic microorganisms like Lactobacillus spp. exert
beneficial effects on epithelial cells by secreting bioactive
and extracellular proteins. Moreover, the active fraction
has been isolated and tested for its activity as immunomodulators and inhibitors for pathogenic microorganisms [14,15]. Some recent reports also suggest the
restoration of barrier function in epithelial cells by probiotic treatment due to the strengthening of tight junctions [10,16]. Gene expression profiling of tight junction
proteins demonstrated the effect of L. plantarum
MB452 in strengthening of tight junction associated
proteins in Caco2 cell line [17]. Additionally, immunolocalization studies on tight junction proteins like ZO-1,
claudin and F-actin demonstrate preventive role of L.
sobrius in enterotoxigenic effect of E. coli K88 [18].
Among the species of Aeromonas, A. hydrophila, A.
salmonicida and A. veronii are considered as emerging
human pathogens and have a potent role in various gastrointestinal disorders. Several clinical studies highlight
the outbreak of Aeromonas spp. infection in diarrhoea
[19-21]. Aeromonas spp. harbours at various ecological
niche, making the transmission of this pathogen more
susceptible to humans [22]. A. veronii (MTCC 3249),
bacterial strain that is used in this study was first
reported from a mosquito midgut and subsequently
reported from drinking water supplies and other sources
[23-25], possess multiple virulence attributes like haemolytic activity, plasmids, quorum sensing and type four
secretion system. These virulent properties can be implicated in its role for toxin production and transfer of
antibiotic resistance genes across and within the genera
[26-29]. In addition to previously established virulence
traits, A. veronii was found to be coding for aerolysin
and type three secretion systems.
In the current study, we isolated and characterised
potential probiotic microorganisms from an Ayurvedic
formulation, Kutajarista. We identified one of our
twelve isolates, VR1, homologous to L. plantarum as a
promising candidate exhibiting tolerance to low pH,
bile salts and simulated gastric juice conditions.
Accompanying studies demonstrated that VR1 is
adherent to human derived HT-29 cells and antagonises the growth of commonly known pathogens like
S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and particularly A. veronii. We
further demonstrated that vacuole formation, epithelial
damage and cytotoxicity caused by A. veronii was
reduced or ameliorated by VR1.

Results
VR1 isolated from Kutajarista exhibited strong probiotic
attributes

Twelve isolates obtained after enrichment of Kutajarista
in MRS broth were identified on the basis of 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. One of the isolates showed maximum
homology with L. plantarum based on 16S rRNA gene
sequence [GenBank: HQ328838]. Its phylogenetic affiliation was deduced by comparing the homologous 16S
rRNA gene sequences from NCBI and the phylogenetic
tree is shown in additional file 1, Fig S1.
Acid, bile and gastric juice tolerance is considered to
be the preliminary characteristics of any strain to claim
its probiotic potential [2,30]. VR1 showed tolerance to
low pH (pH 2.0), bile salt concentration of 0.3% and
simulated gastric juice. There was a little increase of 0.3
Log (CFU/ml) during the course of incubation for 3 h,
which further suggested that it can tolerate and remain
viable at acidic pH 2.0 (Figure 1). In 0.3% bile, there was
increase of 0.5 Log (CFU/ml) after 3 h of incubation
and in simulated gastric juice tolerance test, a decrease
of 0.4 Log (CFU/ml) on growth was observed. L. plantarum is known to be adherent to intestinal cell lines
like Caco2 and HT-29. This study showed that VR1 was
adherent to HT-29 cell line with the adhesion ratio of
6.8 ± 0.2%, which was in concordance with the earlier
studies [31].
CFS of VR1 antagonised the growth of enteric pathogens

Antagonistic activity of VR1 culture supernatant was
examined using well-diffusion test against S. aureus

(ATCC 6538P), S. lutea (ATCC 9341), A. veronii
(MTCC 3249), E. coli (ATCC 8739), P. aeruginosa
(ATCC 27853), S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228), and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa (DMH 1), and E. coli (DMH
9). VR1 showed antimicrobial activity against all the
tested microorganisms, with strong antibacterial activity
against A. veronii with 22 mm inhibitory zone (Table 1).
Vacuole formation by A. veronii on Vero cells were
moderated by VR1 CFS

Sensitivity of Vero cells for Aeromonas cytotoxicity has
been well documented [32-34]. Vero cells were treated
with CFS of A. veronii and VR1, in 1:10 ratio in DMEM.
Figure 2 revealed the formation of perinuclear vacuoles
in more than 50% of cells and cell detachment was
observed after five hours of incubation with A. veronii
CFS; however, pre-incubation with VR1 supernatant for
6 h reduced the vacuole formation and cell detachment.
Time lapse microscopy revealed delayed cytotoxic effects
of A. veronii on Vero cells pre-incubated with VR1

Time lapse microscopic images were taken at various
time intervals for 10 h (Figure 3). Treatment with A.
veronii supernatant in 1:10 ratio to media started showing acute cytopathic effect with cell detachment from
the surface, after 6 h of incubation. Alteration in Vero
cells was followed by a change from normal spindle
shaped to round swollen morphology with an extensively altered cytoplasm and gradual destruction of the
monolayer. However, these cytopathic effects were
delayed by 2 h, where A. veronii supernatant was coincubated with VR1 supernatant. Vero cells pre-treated
for 6 h with VR1 supernatant showed marked reduction
in the cytotoxicity caused by A. veronii, and only few
cells were detached even after 10 h of incubation.
VR1 prevented disruption of ZO-1 and F-actin
caused by A. veronii

distribution in MDCK cells treated with VR1 CFS
(Figure 4a3) similar to control cells (Figure 4a1).
However, fragmented, diffused and punctated pattern of
ZO-1 distribution was observed in case of cells treated
with A. veronii supernatant (Figure 4a2). Pre-incubation
of MDCK cells with VR1 for 6 h prior to A. veronii
infection prevented these changes and showed clear
delineation of cellular borders in a belt like manner
(Figure 4a5). Treatment with A. veronii supernatant led
to disorganisation of actin filaments and nuclear condensation was also observed (Figure 4b2 &4c2). However, pre-incubation of cells with VR1 supernatant
maintained the cellular morphology comparable to control cells. In both the treatments i.e. VR1 CFS, and
A. veronii CFS treatment on cells that were pre-incubated with CFS of VR1, actin filaments were present in
high density at the apical perijunctional regions, encircling the cells in a belt like manner (Figure 4b3 &4b5).
However, co-incubation of A. veronii and VR1 supernatant (Figure 4a4 to 4d4) led to the loss of membrane
architecture with loss of fluorescence of ZO-1 and actin,
as observed in A. veronii treatment group.
CFS of VR1 significantly lowered cytotoxicity
induced by A. veronii

The cytotoxic effect of A. veronii CFS was confirmed
by MTT assay, which essentially checks cell viability
(Figure 5). Cell viability was reduced to 60% in Vero
cells treated with A. veronii supernatant for 10 h. Interestingly, Vero cells when pre-incubated with VR1 CFS
for 6 h followed by 10 h of treatment with A. veronii
CFS showed no loss of cell viability. Similarly, VR1 CFS
treatment did not show any detrimental effects on cells
with no loss in cell viability. However, co-incubation of
VR1 and A. veronii supernatant was not effective in preventing cytotoxicity caused by A. veronii.

Discussion
Kutajarista is an Ayurvedic formulation prescribed for
the treatment of dysentery, piles etc. Initial characterisation of bacterial diversity of Kutajarista by the 16S
rRNA gene clone library [GenBank: HQ875575HQ875614] provided evidence about the richness of
Lactobacillus spp. in the preparation of ayurvedic medicine. Therefore, the current study was aimed at characterization of probiotic and antibacterial properties of
L. plantarum VR1 isolated from Kutajarista, against a
known cytotoxic and virulent strain, A. veronii. Previously, it has been reported that L. delbrueckii, L. lactis
and L. mesenteroides can prevent cellular damage caused
by A. salmonicida, a fish pathogen [35,36]. Here we
report that VR1 possess strong probiotic properties and
abrogated the cytotoxicity of A. veronii MTCC 3249, an
isolate from mosquito midgut. To the best of our

knowledge this is the first report of the preventive role
of CFS from VR1 in cellular and epithelial damage
caused by A. veronii.
Traditionally fermented products are rich source of
Lactobacilli, which can be exploited for their probiotic
potential. Indian fermented foods like Kallappam, koozh
and Mor Kuzhambu were reported as a source of potential probiotic Lactobacillus spp. and which is useful as
biopreservative [5]. Ayurveda is traditionally practised
medicinal science for many centuries and medicines are
prepared from herbs. However, very little efforts have
been made in utilizing these preparations as a source of
probionts. There is only major study which reported the
isolation and charactarisation of seventeen Lactobacillus
spp. from Kanjika, an Ayurvedic formulation, for probiotic attributes [6]. In the present study, we used Kutajarista, an Ayurvedic herbal decoction, for isolation of
potential probiont. VR1 showed highest homology to L.
plantarum and exhibited probiotic characteristics such
as tolerance to acidic pH, bile salts and simulated gastric
juice. VR1 also showed adherence to intestinal cell line
HT-29, which is one of the essential prerequisites for a
probiotic microorganism. All these features indicate this
strain of L. plantarum as a potential probiont. A recent
report by Anderson et al. [37] suggests that L. plantarum has better probiotic characteristics and it also
reduces enteropathogenic effect of E. coli as compared
to commercial strains like L. rhamnosus. Moreover, L.
plantarum has been reported to inhibit pathogens in in
vitro and in vivo systems [9,13]. On the same lines, L.

plantarum isolated from Kutajarista showed inhibition
of the tested type strains and clinical isolates of
P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Interestingly VR1 also
prevented the growth of A. veronii, for which virulent
attributes have already been established [26-28].
The pathogenicity of genus Aeromonas is multifactorial and is attributed to factors such as; cytotoxin, aerolysin, hemolysin, adhesins and secretory systems. Apart
from other virulence factors which may contribute to
the pathogenesis of A. veronii, here we report the
presence of type three secretion system and aerolysin
(additional file 2, Fig S2), putatively involved in secretion
of virulence factors to the host cell and haemolytic
activity respectively. Our previous studies have also
demonstrated that A. veronii MTCC 3249 is multi-drug
resistant, and harbours three uncharacterised plasmids
and one of the plasmids codes for functional type four
secretion system [26,28,29].
After establishing the fact that A. veronii was cytotoxic
to mammalian cells and harbours many virulence
factors, our next goal was to observe the protective or
preventive role of VR1 in A. veronii infection. We used
CFS of VR1 to examine its efficacy in amelioration of
cytotoxicity caused by A. veronii supernatant. We
observed high level of vacuole formation as an indication of cytotoxicity and morphological changes in Vero
cells. Earlier, in an enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infection
model, it was shown that pre-incubation with
L. plantarum abolished the cytotoxicity caused by enteropathogenic strain [10]. To test whether VR1 had

similar effects, we studied the time dependent effects of
CFS of A. veronii, VR1, in combination or treatment of
A. veronii on VR1 pre-incubated cells. We found that
pre-incubation of Vero cells with VR1 CFS delayed cytotoxicity, which was induced by A. veronii. Vacuolating
cytotoxic factor from A. veronii was earlier reported to
cause cell death [38].

Tight junction disruption is considered to be one of
the indicators of morphological damage caused due to
cytotoxicity. MDCK cell line infected with V. cholerae
cytotoxin and S. typhimurium showed a clear indication
of epithelial barrier dysfunction by disruption of tight
junction [39,40]. In fish, pre-incubation with prospective
probiont L. delbrueckii sub sp. lactis could prevent

epithelial damage caused by A. salmonicida [36]. To
investigate the effect of CFS derived from VR1, and A.
veronii on epithelial barrier, we selected MDCK cell line
over Caco2 cell line because it exhibits similar epithelial
characteristics like formation of uniform columnar
epithelia, tight junction, and it has an advantage of a
short culture period of 5-7 days in comparison to Caco2
which has 21 days of growth period [41-43]. We found
that A. veronii indeed caused epithelial damage by disruption of ZO-1 and F-Actin in MDCK cell line, which
was prevented by pre-incubation with VR1 supernatant
for 6 h, whereas co-incubation was not able to restore
the epithelial integrity. ZO-1 is a cytoplasmic protein
which interacts directly with F-Actin and is very important in structural and functional organisation of tight
junction. In this study, microscopic observation of cellular damage is well supported by immunolocalization of
ZO-1 and F-Actin, which give clear evidence of VR1 in
ameliorating the epithelial damage caused by A. veronii.
This finding is consistent with earlier report that, L.
rhamnosus GG treatment ameliorated the redistribution
of ZO-1 and claudin in MDCK cell line caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli [16]. In another study, incubation
with CFS of B. lactis 420 has been shown to increase
the intestinal epithelial integrity against enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) [44].

Page 7 of 11

Cell viability assessed by MTT assay revealed that VR1
CFS treatment was not detrimental to cells and there
was no loss in viability when pre-incubated with VR1
CFS. On the other hand, co-incubation could not prevent the loss in cell viability caused by A. veronii. Preincubation of Caco2 with p40 and p75 isolated from the
soluble protein of L. rhamnosus GG, abrogated the disruptive effect of H2O2 on tight junctions of Caco2 cells
[45]. The protective effect of soluble proteins was shown
to be by activation of MAP kinase and PKC dependent
signalling pathways. One more study (Parassol et al.,
[46]) documented that pre-incubation of L. casei with
T84 cells could abolish the invasion and adhesion of
EPEC. On these lines, we speculate, pre-incubation of
mammalian cells with CFS of Lactobacilli sp. initiates
cellular signalling which either inhibits or upregulate
tight junction proteins that may get damaged by entero
pathogens.
In view of the increasing prevalence of Aeromonas
spp. in food products, this study assumes significance of
its application of L. plantarum as a potential probiotic
microorganism. The findings also suggest that the regular usage of probiotic microorganisms in food preparations can prevent the cytotoxicity or manifestation of
pathogenicity in future encounter with pathogens.
Further in depth studies will be necessary to understand
the preventive role of VR1 in invivo model for A. veronii
infection and to identify its active component which
may be used as potential preventive cure against gastrointestinal infection.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
isolation of potential probiotic isolate, L. plantarum
VR1 from Kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented medicine.
CFS of VR1 possesses strong antibacterial property
against A. veronii and reduces its cytotoxic effects in
MDCK and Vero cell lines. Hence, L. plantarum can be
an effective probiotic to prevent Aeromonas infection as
well, as it has been proposed for some other enteric
pathogens.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
for mammalian cells

The bacterial strains used in this study are A. veronii
MTCC 3249, L. plantarum (VR1) NCIM 5395 and E.
coli DH5a. Strains used for antimicrobial study were S.
aureus (ATCC 6538P), Sarcina lutea (ATCC 9341), E.
coli (ATCC 8739), P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228), clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa (DMH 1), E. coli (DMH 9). All the above
mentioned type strains, A. veronii and E. coli were maintained in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C. VR1 was

Kumar et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/152

grown in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) medium (Himedia
Laboratories, Mumbai, India) at 37°C. Overnight grown
cultures of A. veronii and VR1 were inoculated into 5
ml of LB and MRS medium respectively, at 37°C with
shaking at 200 rev min-1. Cell-free supernatant was prepared by centrifugation (10,000 g for 2 min at 4°C) followed by filtration of the supernatants through a 0.22
μm pore size membrane filter (Millipore, India). The filtrates were either refrigerated before use or used immediately. HT-29 (Human colon adenocarcinoma), Vero
(African green monkey Kidney) and MDCK (MadinDarby Canine Kidney) epithelial cell lines, were purchased from the animal cell repository of National Centre for Cell Science, India and maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf serum and 1 × Penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA).
Isolation and identification of Lactobacillus
spp. from Kutajarista

Several samples of Kutajarista, (an Ayurvedic fermented
decoction) were taken at initial days of fermentation. A
number of lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated
(serial dilution with saline) in MRS plate and incubated
at 37°C for 2-3 days. All isolated strains were subsequently propagated in MRS broth and were stored in
40% glycerol in -80°C. Molecular identification was carried out by amplification and sequencing of ~1.5 Kb
partial sequence of 16S rRNA gene by using Eubacteria
specific 16F27 (5’-CCA GAG TTT GAT CMT GGC
TCA G-3’) and 16R1488 (5’- CGG TTA CCT TGT
TAC GAC TTC ACC -3’) [23]. The 16S rRNA gene
sequence for the strain VR1 was submitted to Genbank
with accession number HQ328838. VR1 showed 99%
homology with Lactobacillus plantarum and its phylogenetic affiliation was deduced by neighbour joining
method in MEGA 4.0.
In vitro characterisation of VR1 for probiotic attributes

MRS broth was used to simulate the acidic condition of
intestine by adjusting the pH of the broth to pH 2. For
bile tolerance test, MRS broth was supplemented with
0.3% bile salts (Oxgall, Himedia, India). Simulated
intestinal fluid was prepared to assess passage through
the upper gastrointestinal tract. The composition of
simulated gastric juice was 1.28 g NaCl, 0.239 g KCl, 6.4
g NaHCO 3 , 0.3% bile salts, 0.1% (w/v) pancreatin (Hi
media Labs) per litre of distilled water and the pH to
7.5 adjusted by adding HCl [30]. For all the tolerance
tests, 5 ml overnight grown Lactobacillus strains were
collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 4 ml
of PBS and inoculated (at 109 CFU/ml) in MRS broth
with modifications for acid, bile and gastric juice tolerance medium mentioned above. Then the number of

viable VR1 cells was determined by serial dilution and
plate-count method.
Antimicrobial activity of VR1

The antimicrobial activity of VR1 was determined by
well diffusion assay as described by Chiu et al. [47]. Bacterial strains included in this study were S. aureus
(ATCC 6538P), S. lutea (ATCC 9341), A. veronii
(MTCC 3249), E. coli (ATCC 8739), P. aeruginosa
(ATCC 27853), S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228), and clinical isolates P. aeruginosa (DMH 1), and E. coli (DMH
9). These bacterial isolates were grown overnight in LB
broth and further diluted to 107 CFU/mL and spread on
LB agar plates. One hundred microliters of filtered
spent CFS of VR1 were pipetted into the well on nutrient agar and then plates were incubated at 37°C for 1214 h. The diameters of the zone of inhibition were
measured.
Adhesion assay of VR1

Adhesion of VR1 was performed using HT-29 cells as
described earlier with little modification [2,4]. Briefly,
monolayers of HT-29 were used at the late confluence
with change of media every 2 days. HT-29 monolayers
were washed twice with sterile PBS. The Antibiotic free
media was added to each well and incubated for 12 h.
For each adhesion assay, 1 ml of VR1 suspension (the
final concentration of bacteria was 10 9 CFU/ml) was
mixed with 1 ml of DMEM and added to different wells.
The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h in the presence of 5% CO 2 . After incubation, monolayer was
washed with sterile PBS. One ml of 0.2% trypsin was
added to each well and incubated for 15 min at Room
temperature (RT). The cell suspension was plated on
MRS agar by serial dilution using saline. Results were
interpreted as percentage adhesion, the ratio between
adherent bacteria and added bacteria per well. Three
independent experiments were carried out in duplicate.
DNA manipulations, Hybridization, PCR and Sequencing

A. veronii genomic DNA was extracted using a standard

Assessment of vacuole formation by light microscopy

Bacterial cultures were grown and CFS was prepared as
described above and processed for vacuolation assay as
described previously [33,49] with slight modifications.
Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in six well tissue culture
plate with cell density of 1 × 10 5 cells/ml. The cells
were allowed to settle, attach and grow for 24 h prior to
use. 100 μl of filter sterilized A. veronii, and VR1 CFS,
were added to the respective wells, mixed gently and
incubated for 5 h before taking the images. One of the
wells was pre-incubated with VR1 supernatant for 6 h
before the addition of A. veronii supernatant. Vacuolation was observed by Phase contrast microscopy (Nikon
2000, Japan). Images were taken under 20 × objective
and were analysed using image pro software (Media
Cybernetics, Inc, Bethesda, MD).
Time lapse microscopic analysis of cytotoxic effect

For photomicroscopy, Vero cells were seeded in six well
tissue culture plate with the density of 1 × 10 5 cells/
well. After 24 h of incubation for cell attachment, cells
were treated with bacterial supernatant with a concentration of 1:10 to the culture media; one of the wells
was pre-incubated with probiotic supernatant for 6 h
prior to the treatment with A. veronii supernatant.
Other treatment groups were same as described above.
Live imaging was performed and images were captured
at the intervals of 30 min using NIKON TE 2000 under
20 × objective. Images were analysed by Image pro from
media analytica.

thoroughly rinsed with PBS, mounted on slides and examined under confocal laser scanning microscope at 1-μm
intervals (Zeiss LSM510; Zeiss, Germany).
Cytotoxicity assay

MTT reduction assay was performed to determine the
effect of CFS of A. veronii on Vero cell viability. This
method was adopted from Couto et al. [50] with little
modifications. 10 μl of CFS of VR1 and A. veronii were
added to a final concentration of 1: 10 in culture media
of Vero cells cultivated in 96-well tissue culture plates.
The tissue-culture plates were incubated in 5% CO 2
atmosphere at 37°C for 10 h. Monolayers was examined
after 10 h of incubation for cytotoxic effect. 20 μl of
MTT solution (5 mg ml -1 ) was added to every well.
After incubation for 3 h at 37°C, the media was
removed and precipitated formazan was dissolved with
100 μl of DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 570
nm using Micro-plate reader (Multiskan Ascent V1.24).
The cell viability was expressed as the mean of percentages of treated and untreated monolayers. Experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Analysis of ZO-1 and F-actin distribution by confocal
microscopy

MDCK cells were seeded on the cover slips into 24 well
tissue culture plates and incubated with 1:10 ratio of CFS
of A. veronii and VR1. The tissue-culture plates were incubated in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 10 h with A. veronii supernatant, or with VR1, in other group three wells
were pre-incubated with VR1 for 6 h before addition of A.
veronii supernatant. The immunofluorescence staining
protocol was adopted from Johnson-Henry, [16]. Briefly,
MDCK cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, followed by
fixation and permeabilization with 0.1% triton X-100 for 5
min at RT. Cells were incubated in 5% (vol/vol) bovine
serum in PBS for 1 h at RT and then incubated with primary mouse anti-ZO-1 (339100, Invitrogen, molecular
probes, USA) for 1 h. Unbound primary antibodies were
rinsed and removed by washes with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary ALEXAfluor 633 goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:50 dilution; Molecular Probes) and Rhodaminephalloidin (1: 100 dilution, R-415, Molecular probes) for 1
h at RT. Host cell nuclei were counterstained with 300
nM 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate (DAPI) (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 5 min. Monolayers were
