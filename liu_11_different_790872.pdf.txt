and VAC Strains

Abstract
Background: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is an unassigned member in the family Herpesviridae. To demonstrate
further the evolutionary position of DEV in the family Herpesviridae, we have described a 42,897-bp fragment. We
demonstrated novel genomic organization at one end of the long (L) region and in the entire short (S) region in
the Clone-03 strain of DEV.
Results: A 42,897-bp fragment located downstream of the LOFR11 gene was amplified from the Clone-03 strain of
DEV by using ‘targeted gene walking PCR’. Twenty-two open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted and
determined in the following order: 5’-LORF11-RLORF1-ORF1-ICP4-S1-S2-US1-US10-SORF3-US2-MDV091.5-like-US3-US4US5-US6-US7-US8-ORFx-US1-S2-S1-ICP4 -3’. This was different from that of the published VAC strain, both in the
linkage of the L region and S region, and in the length of the US10 and US7 proteins. The MDV091.5-like gene,
ORFx gene, S1 gene and S2 gene were first observed in the DEV genome. The lengths of DEV US10 and US7 were
determined to be 311 and 371 amino acids, respectively, in the Clone-03 strain of DEV, and these were different
from those of other strains. The comparison of genomic organization in the fragment studied herein with those of
other herpesviruses showed that DEV possesses some unique characteristics, such as the duplicated US1 at each
end of the US region, and the US5, which showed no homology with those of other herpesviruses. In addition, the
results of phylogenetic analysis of ORFs in the represented fragment indicated that DEV is closest to its
counterparts VZV (Varicellovirus) and other avian herpesviruses.
Conclusion: The molecular characteristics of the 42,897-bp fragment of Clone-03 have been found to be different
from those of the VAC strain. The phylogenetic analysis of genes in this region showed that DEV should be a
separate member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.

Background
Herpesviruses are among the most persistent of all
pathogens because they have coevolved with their hosts
over a long period of time, and they are relatively harmless in immunocompetent hosts [1]. The family Herpesviridae comprises approximately 100 members; these
viruses infect a range of host species from humans and
other mammals to birds, amphibians, and reptiles [2]. On
the basis of differences in cellular tropism, genome organization, and gene content, herpesviruses have been
grouped into three subfamilies: Alphaherpesvirinae (a-),

Betaherpesvirinae (b-), and Gammaherpesvirinae (g-)
[3,4]. Currently, duck enteritis virus (DEV), also known
as duck plague virus (DPV) and duck herpesvirus-1 [4], is
an unassigned member of the family Herpesviridae [5].
Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses with a virion size
over 100 nm [1]. The genomes of these viruses are linear, double-stranded DNA, and they differ in size,
sequence arrangements, and base composition [2]. They
also vary significantly with respect to the presence and
arrangement of inverted and directly repeated sequences
[6]. Herpesvirus genomes differ in the arrangement of
direct and inverted repeat regions with respect to
unique regions. Six types of genome structures have
been confirmed adequately in herpesviruses, which are
designated by letters from A to F. The A type structure

consists of a unique region flanked by a direct terminal
repeat at the genome ends. Type B genomes contain
variable numbers of a TR (terminal reiterations) at each
end of the genome. In the C type genome, the number
of direct terminal reiterations is small but sequences
longer than 100 bp are directly repeated and subdivide
the unique sequence of the genome into several well
delineated stretches. The D type genome just has the
repeated sequences at one terminus and in an inverted
orientation internally. In the E group, the genome is
divided into unique long (UL) and unique short (US)
regions; each unique region is flanked by the inverted
repeats. The sequences at the two termini of the F
group are not identical and are not repeated directly or
in an inverted orientation. It has been reported that
DEV also contains linear, double-stranded DNA, and its
genome was shown to be approximately 180 kb in size,
with a G plus C content of 64.3% [7]. Genomic
sequences of DEV have been reported recently by several Chinese research groups; however, discrepancies
were found among these reports [8-18]. Genes in the
UL region of DEV and their arrangement have been
reported by our laboratory, and the results generally
showed more similarity with Mardiviruses [8-13].
Another report showed that the LORF11 gene of the
VAC strain is located at the leftmost end of the DEV
genome, and that the LORF11 gene encoded a putative
protein of 275 amino acids in the VAC strain [14]; both
of these results differ from our previous results [12].
Meanwhile, several genes in the US region have also
been reported [15-18]; however, the length of the putative proteins encoded by the US10 gene and US7 gene
has been debated. In this study, we present a fragment
of 42,897 bp, which contains one end of the L region
that includes part of the LORF11 gene, which was
absent from the published VAC strain, and the whole of
the DEV S region. In addition, we demonstrated a different genomic organization of the junction of the L
region and the S region in this study. These results will
provide a useful comparative dataset for the study of
related genes in DEV and other herpesviruses.

sequences designated as a-type-like sequences [13], as in
the case of the two regions in herpes simplex virus (HSV)
[19]. Another a-type-like sequence was also found at the
end of the TRS in the DEV genome. The overall G plus
C ratio of the region sequenced was 46.09%.
Twenty-two ORFs that contained more than 75 amino
acids were found in the present study, which were in
the order: 5’-LORF11-RLORF1-ORF1-ICP4-S1-S2-US1US10-SORF3-US2-MDV091.5-like-US3-US4-US5-US6US7-US8-ORFx-US1-S2-S1-ICP4-3’. These ORFs were
predicted to encode 17 putative proteins, with the
exception of LORF11, because genes in the IRS and TRS
were inverted and encoded the same proteins. The start
locations of all ORFs were assumed to be the first possible ATG. The motifs of each ORF are listed in Table 1.

Results
The features of the overall sequences and determination
of ORFs

A 207-bp insertion in both the IRS and the TRS regions
was not found in their counterparts in the DEV VAC
strain

A fragment of 42,897 bp downstream of the LORF11
gene was amplified from the genome of the Clone-03
strain of DEV in this study. The genome structure and
the gene layout of this fragment are depicted in Figure 1.
The fragment contained part of the sequence of the
LORF11 gene [12], the rightmost part of the L region, the
US region and its flanking sequences, and inverted
repeats of the short region (IRS and TRS). The L region
and IRS were interrupted by a set of tandem repeat

In addition to the linkage of the L region and the S
region, two insertions of 207 bp were found in the presented fragment in both the IRS region and the TRS
region (Figure 2), when compared with the published
VAC genome. The 158-bp sequence at the 3’ end of the
207-bp sequence of the IRS region was complemented
with a fragment of the same length at the 5’ end of the
207-bp sequence of the TRS region. The remaining
49-bp fragment in each of the insertions was dissociated

The confirmation of the junction between the L region
and the S region

Owing to the different linkages of the L region and S
region found in the genome sequences of the published
DEV VAC strain [14] and our above-described sequence
in the Clone-03 strain of DEV, a pair of specific primers
was designed to confirm the junction of the L region
and S region in the DEV genome. The forward primer,
L25, was located in the LORF11 gene (GenBank no.
EU294364), which is a gene in the DEV UL region that
had only one copy in the genome compared with the
genomes of other alphaherpesviruses. The reverse primer, L26, was located in the SORF3 gene, which is a
gene in the US region of the DEV genome that also has
a single copy in the DEV genome. The PCR product
was used as the model for the second nested PCR after
dilution to 1 in 1,000. We obtained four different fragments (Figure 1), and they were 4,553 bp, 4,689 bp,
4,743 bp, and 5,547 bp in length, respectively. The
results of sequencing of the four fragments showed that
they were parallel with the sequences obtained using
‘targeted gene walking PCR’. Consequently, we determined that the linkage between the L region and the S
region should be in the following order: 5’-LORF11RLORF1-ORF1-ICP4 -S1-S2-US1-US10-SORF3-3’.

and not complemented. Both of the fragments were rich
in A plus T, with a content of 67.15%.
The characteristics of new ORFs detected in the fragment

Two ORFs, designated RLORF1 and ORF1, were
detected in the region upstream of the S region.
Another copy of ORF1 was found to the left of the DEV
L region of the genome [13]. The RLORF1 and ORF1
encoded two putative proteins of 109 and 81 amino
acids, respectively. Four phosphorylation sites were predicted in the sequence of RLORF1.

In addition, eight ORFs encoding four different putative proteins (S1, S2, ICP4, and US1) in the RS region
were detected. Of these proteins, S1 and S2 were identified for the first time in the present study. The S1 gene
encoded a putative protein of 92 amino acids, and four
phosphorylation sites were predicted. No homologue of
S1 was found in the proteins encoded by other herpesviruses. Another unique gene in the RS region was S2,
which encoded a putative protein of 96 amino acids that
contained just six phosphorylation sites. ICP4 and US1
were the same as previously described [13,14].

The DEV US region contained 11 ORFs that were likely
to code for 11 proteins (Figure 1), which included homologues of the HSV-1 genes US10, US2, US3, US4, US6, US7
and US8 [20]. Interestingly, a unique ORF in the DEV US
region, located downstream of US8, was predicted in the
present study and named ORFx. The ORFx encoded a
putative peptide of 118 amino acids. One transmembrane
domain was detected in the ORFx between residue positions 95 and 115 at the N-terminus. Remarkably, the
length of our DEV US10 was 311 amino acids, which was
different from published results of 168, 169 and 298
amino acids [14,15,17]. We also found a sequence of 13
amino acids, CSFWCCLGHAATC (Additional file 1, Figure S1), which mapped to amino acids 236-248 and conformed to the C-C-H-C zinc finger motif as described in
equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) [21,22]
A new gene was predicted in this study, which was
327 bp in length and overlapped 197 bp at the 3’-terminus of the US2 gene. It was homologous to the proteins
encoded by Marek’s disease virus-1 (MDV-1), MDV-2
and HVT and was designated MDV091.5-like gene.
BLAST searches using the amino acid sequence showed
that this protein had some amino acid similarity with
putative nucleotide-binding oligomerization domaincontaining protein 2 of Gasterostrus aculeatus, the putative lyase of Rhodococcus erythropolis, and bacterial
valyl-tRNA synthetase.

Phylogenetic rooted trees were constructed from alignments of the putative proteins with their homologues in
other alphaherpesviruses and are shown in Figure 4 and
5. The DEV US2 gene, US3 gene, US6 gene, US7 gene
and US10 gene showed closer relationships with members of Mardivirus. However, US1 showed a closer relationship between DEV and members of Simplexvirus
and Varicellovirus. The DEV US4 gene showed more
similarity with infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV),
and both clustered into the subfamily Varicellovirus
(Figure 4). The DEV US8 gene fell into an outgroup
position with respect to members of subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae (Figure 5), which implies that a recombination event may have occurred during the origin and
evolution of the virus.

Figure 4 Evolutionary relationship of US1, US2, US3 and US4 proteins in DEV S regions within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. The
phylogenetic tree was generated using the MEGALIGN (DNAStar) program. Sequence distances indicated by the scale were calculated using the
Gonnet 250 matrix in LASERGENE.

Figure 6. Despite obvious similarities, there were marked
differences in gene content, organization and localization between DEV and other alphaherpesviruses. Nevertheless, these overall gene layouts are consistent with a
model that accounts for the divergence of alphaherpesvirus from a common ancestor by a number of homologous and semihomologous recombination events, which
resulted in concomitant loss or gain of US genes [23].
Origins of replication in the S region

Two well-defined origins of replication were found in
the IRS and TRS of the DEV genome, designated oriS.
The two oriS were palindromic structures and contained
the same sequence features: two inverted 9-bp
sequences, which were identical to that recognized by
the origin-binding protein (OBP) encoded by the UL9
binding sequence (GTTCGCAC), separated by a 43-bp
AT-rich spacer sequence (76.75% A+T) (Figure 7). The
features were the same as described for PRV (Pseudorabies virus) [24] and equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) [25].

Discussion
Our laboratory has been engaged for many years in analyzing the genome sequences of DEV [8-13]. After we
had completed the genome sequence of DEV Clone-03,
a DEV VAC genome sequence was also published by
other researchers [14]. However, some differences were
detected by comparison of parts of our DEV Clone-03
strain with those of the DEV VAC strain. Herein, we
presented the sequence of a 42,897-bp fragment
anchored in the LORF11 gene of the DEV genome
which was located at the rightward end of the UL region
[12], by using the method of ‘targeted gene walking
PCR’ (Figure 1). Comparison of the sequence of the
fragment with that of the DEV VAC strain showed that
our Clone-03 strain of DEV had a different gene order
from that of the DEV VAC strain in this region. Consequently, we designed an additional four pairs of primers
according to the new sequences and confirmed the
result using nested PCR (Figure 1). The two methods
obtained the same sequences, and it was demonstrated

Figure 5 Evolutionary relationship of US6, US7, US8 and US10 proteins in DEV S regions within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. The

that the genes in this region should be in the following
order: 5’-LORF11-RLORF1-ORF1-ICP4-S1-S2-US1-US10SORF3-3’, which is different from the DEV VAC strain,
in which the gene order is 5’-LORF11-UL-ICP4-US1US10-SORF3-3’ [14]. The different linkage pattern
between DEV Clone-03 and the VAC strain in the L
region and S region is difficult to explain and requires
further investigation, although a different linkage
between the L and S regions of HSV was also observed
between wild-type virus and cell-adapted virus [26,27].
Interestingly, we also found some novel characteristics
of the sequences in the S region of the Clone-03 strain
of DEV. Two insertions of 207 bp in the IRS and TRS
regions were found in the DEV Clone-03 strain that
were absent from the VAC strain. It has been reported
that some fragments were lost during serial passage of
MDV [28]. Hence, we speculated that the insertion of
the two 207-bp fragments in the DEV Clone-03 strain
and their absence from the VAC strain might be due to

the different passage levels [28]. The S1 gene, S2 gene,
RLORF1 gene, ORF1 gene and ORFx gene that were
observed in the Clone-03 strain in this study also had
similar sequences in the VAC genome; however, those
genes showed no homologues in other alphaherpesviruses. Those genes may be potential markers to differentiate DEV from other alphaherpesviruses.
Davison and McGeoch concluded that differences in
gene layout in the S component between HSV-1 and
VZV have resulted from expansion and contraction of
IRS/TRS during evolution [23]. This may also be the case
for the DEV genome. Unlike those of MDV-1, MDV-2
and HVT, the DEV US1 gene was duplicated and also
inverted to the other end of the US, as is that of PRV
[24]. Similarly, the presence of two copies of the US1
gene in DEV does not imply that the virus expresses two
forms of ICP22 [24]. Although the pattern of the two
copies of the US1 gene in the DEV genome showed a
similar gene layout to those of PRV, the existence of the

Figure 6 Comparison of genes in the DEV and alphaherpesvirus US regions. The comparison was based on the published sequences (37,
21, 20, 49). The red and blank arrows indicate the ORFs that were homologous in different alphaherpesviruses. The gray arrows indicate the
ORFs that not exist in all the selected viruses. The green bars in the leftmost and rightmost parts indicate the sequences of the genomes, except
for the US region. The targeted regions compared in this study are boxed.

LORF11 gene at the rightward end of the UL region indicated that the organization of the DEV genome may be
similar to that of other avian herpesviruses. The presence
of the SORF3 gene and the MDV091.5-like gene, and the
translocation of the US10 gene in the DEV genome,
further suggests a close relationship between DEV and
other avian herpesviruses. In addition, the phylogenetic
analysis of most genes in the presented fragment further
indicated a close relationship between DEV and viruses
in the subfamily Mardivirus. However, the US region of
DEV contained some genes that were absent from the
genomes of other avian herpesviruses, such as US4 and
ORFx, which indicates that DEV may be a unique member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.
Replication of the viral genome is a central event in the
life cycle of herpesviruses. The initiation of viral DNA
synthesis marks the commitment of the infected cell to
the production of new infectious virus and, in most
instances, cell death. HSV-1 contains three origins of
DNA replication of two types: one copy of oriL located at
the centre of the UL region of the genome and two copies
of oriS located in the repeat regions that flank the US
region of the genome [29]. The reasons for the three
potential origins of replication in the viral genome are not
apparent in HSV. In this study, we predicted two copies of

oriS in the RS region of DEV. It has been reported that the
deletion of the oriL in HSV resulted in reduced replication
in mouse tissues and reduced reactivation from latent
infection. Thus, oriL may be required for DNA replication
in certain tissues [29]. Although oriL was absent from the
DEV genome, the core sequence of oriS, which typically
contains an origin recognition element and a DNAunwinding element, was unchanged [29]. This absence of
oriL from DEV may be associated with the evolution of
the viral genome, may lead to different characteristics of
the replication of DEV from those of other herpesviruses,
and may even result in functional deletions from the genome of DEV in comparison with other herpesviruses.

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated a different organization
of genes in the rightward part of the L region and the
whole S region in the Clone-03 strain of DEV, when
compared with the VAC strain. Several novel characteristics were also detected in this region that have not
been reported in the VAC strain, including the presence
of S1, S2, ORFx and MDV091.5-like genes and two
insertions in the IRS and TRS regions. The genomic
order and the characteristics of the genes in this region,
together with phylogenetic analysis based on the

putative proteins encoded by the genes investigated in
the present study showed that DEV should be a unique
member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.

Methods
Virus stock preparation

The Clone-03 strain of DEV was used in this study
[8-13]. The virus stocks were produced by propagation
in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM) with 8% fetal bovine
serum. The infected CEFs were harvested when the
cytopathic effect (CPE) reached 80%. After three freezethaw cycles, the virus stocks were confirmed primarily
by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) as described previously [8-13].
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and
sequencing

The viral DNA was extracted from the virus stocks as
described previously [9]. The ‘targeted gene walking PCR’,
as described previously [30,31], was used to amplify the
targeted DEV genome fragment, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Briefly, four nonspecific ‘walking’ primers, N1, N2, N3 and
N4 [10] were used to walk the genome of DEV. A pair of
specific primers, L1 and L2, was designed on the basis of
the partial sequence of DEV LORF11 published in GenBank (GenBank no. EU294364) [12]. The PCR was carried
out by using L1 and L2 as forward primers; the four nonspecific primers were used as reverse primers. Finally, a
2,998-bp fragment (F1) was amplified, anchored from the
DEV LORF11 gene. Targeted primer L3 and internal

primer L4 were designed on the basis of the newly generated fragment, and was used to amplify the neighbouring
gene fragment with one of the four nonspecific primers.
Similarly, primers L5-L6, L7-L8, L9-L10, L11-L12, L13L14, L15-L16, L17-L18, L19-L20, L21-L22 and L23-L24
(Figure 1) were designed and used in the subsequent PCR
amplifications. The primers used in PCR amplifications in
this study are listed in Table 2.
The PCR was carried out in a 25 μl reaction volume
as described previously [9]. The reaction was performed
at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1
min, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 3 min; the reaction
was ended by elongation at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR
products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The PCR
products were sequenced directly or cloned into the
pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and used for sequencing.
Each of the fragments was sequenced at least three
times from different PCR products.
The determination of open reading frames (ORFs) in the
presented fragment and genomic organization in the
junction between the L region and S region in the DEV
genome

The sequences obtained were assembled using the Gene
Runner (version 3.00, Hastings Software, Inc., Hudson,
NY, USA). The ORFs and genomic organization in the
junction of the L region and S region, and the layout of
genes in the S region, were determined by comparison
with the sequence counterparts of Marek’s disease virus
(MDV), HSV-1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The

study and the reported DEV VAC strain [14], one pair
of specific primers, L25 and L26 (Table 2), was designed
to confirm the result. Primer L25 was located within the
LORF11 gene and L26 was located within the SORF3
gene. This pair of primers was used in the first nested
PCR. Other primers, L27, L28-L29, L30-L31, and L32
(Table 2), were also used in the second nested PCR.
The position of the primers and the strategy for confirmation of the sequence are shown in Figure 1.
The PCR was carried out in a 25 μl reaction volume.
The first nest of the PCR reaction was performed at 95°
C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min,
50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 8 min; the reaction was
ended by elongation at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel and was used
as the template for the second nest. The second nested
PCR was performed at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 53°C for 1 min and 72°C for 3
min; the reaction was ended by elongation at 72°C for
10 min. The products of the second nested PCR were
cloned and sequenced, respectively.
