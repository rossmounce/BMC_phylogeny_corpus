Abstract
Background: The Enabled/Vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) gene family comprises three genes in
vertebrates: Vasp, Enabled homologue (Enah) and Ena-VASP like (Evl). Enah has the most complex gene structure. It has
extra alternatively included exons compared to Vasp and Evl, and possibly one alternatively excluded intron S. The aim
of this mapping study was to probe the occurrence of combinations of exon usage in Enah thereby identifying
possible vertebrate ENAH splice variants. We investigated this via an in silico analysis and by performing a reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) screen on mouse samples. We further probed the expression pattern
of mouse Enah splice variants during development and in a selection of mouse adult tissues and mouse cell lines.
Results: In silico analysis of the vertebrate Ena/VASP gene family reveals that birds do not have Vasp, while fish have
two Evl genes. Analysis of expressed sequence tags of vertebrate Enah splice variants confirms that an Enah transcript
without alternative exons is ubiquitously expressed, but yields only limited information about the existence of other
possible alternatively spliced Enah transcripts. Via a RT-PCR screen, we provide evidence that during mouse
development and in adult mice at least eight and maximally sixteen different Enah transcripts are expressed. We also
show that tissues and cell lines display specific expression profiles of these different transcripts. Exons previously
associated with neuronal expression of Enah splice variants are also present in other tissues, in particular in heart.
Conclusions: We propose a more uniform nomenclature for alternative exons in Enah. We provide an overview of
distinct expression profiles of mouse Enah splice variants during mouse development, in adult mouse tissues and in a
subset of mouse cell lines.
Background
The vertebrate Enabled/Vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) gene family encodes three proteins:
enabled homologue (ENAH, throughout the manuscript
we use protein, gene and mRNA symbols based on the
format of mouse and rat nomenclature, i.e. ENAH, Enah
and Enah, respectively) (also referred to as mammalian
enabled or Mena), VASP and Ena-VASP like (EVL). Ena/
VASP proteins are actin binding proteins that are
involved in dynamic actin remodeling important for
maintaining cell shape and cell movement (for review see
[1]). These proteins are composed of four conserved
domains. An N-terminal Ena/VASP homology domain 1
(EVH1) interacts with different proteins and is especially

important for localization of ENA/VASP proteins in the
cell. The central proline-rich region binds to the actin
binding protein profilin and Src homology 3 (SH3) and
WW domains. The EVH2 domain comprises the globular
actin (G-actin) and filamentous actin (F-actin) binding
sites and the C-terminal coiled-coil region that mediates
oligomerization of the proteins. For VASP no splice variants have been reported, whereas for EVL two splice variants have been discovered: EVL and EVL-I. The latter has
an insert sequence in the EVH2 domain [2]. For mouse
Enah three alternatively included exons were initially
reported: the +++ and ++ exons, located in between
exons 3 and 4, and the + exon that is actually part of an
alternative exon 6 due to an upstream splice event [3,4]
(Figure 1). Recently, in human Enah, a novel alternatively
included exon was found. This exon (11a) is located in
between exons 11 and 12 and is at an equivalent position

Figure 1 Mouse Vasp, Evl and Enah gene structure. Vasp, Evl and Enah have thirteen exons in common. The Evl gene has one exon in addition that
can be alternatively included (exon 10a; previous name exon I). The Enah gene is more complex and has a longer exon 5, an extra expressed exon
(Enah exon 6) and four alternatively included exons (exons 3a, 3b, 6L (a longer form of exon 6) and 11a; previous names +++ or INV, ++, + and 11a,
respectively) and one alternatively excluded intron (intron S). An exon numbering is proposed for the alternatively included exons. The previously
used exon names are also indicated.

of exon I of mouse Evl [2,5]. Next to the alternatively
included exons, an alternatively excluded intron has been
proposed to exist in mouse Enah. The Enah transcript
without this intron (which is part of exon 7) is referred to
in literature as Mena short (Mena S) and has no prolinerich region.
ENA/VASP proteins are expressed in various tissues.
VASP is highly expressed in platelets (and is the only
ENA/VASP protein present there) and is also abundantly
expressed in heart, stomach, intestine, spleen, lung and
blood vessels [6-8]. ENAH is abundantly expressed in the
brain and heart whereas it is not detectable in platelets
and spleen [3,7,8]. Both mouse VASP and ENAH colocalize in stomach, intestine, kidney and heart [7]. EVL is
expressed in the brain but also in spleen, thymus and testis [9].
Neuronal tissue specific expression has been reported
for the mouse Enah splice variants containing exons +++,
++ or + [3]. One transcript only contains exon + whereas
a second and a third transcript contain exon + combined
with either exon ++ or exon +++. Expression of human
Enah transcripts containing the 11a exon is characteristic
for epithelial tumor cell lines and this form appears to be
involved in proliferation [5,10]. This form is down-regulated in invasive tumor cell lines whereas Enah splice
variants containing alternative exons ++ and +++ are upregulated [11,12]. Furthermore, the splice variant containing exon +++ promotes carcinoma cell motility and
invasiveness in vivo and in vitro. This exon was therefore
renamed INV (for invasive) [12]. The short Enah splice
variant lacking intron S is preferentially expressed in
spleen and B-lymphoid cell lines [13]. Also, Evl and the
alternative splice variant Evl-I are differentially expressed
in tissues. EVL is the predominant form in the brain,
whereas EVL-I is enriched in thymus and spleen [2].
From the above studies, it is evident that attempts have
been made to document expression of Enah and Evl splice

variants. These studies, however, only focused on specific
splice variants with only one or maximum two alternatively excluded exons. In general, information on tissue
specific expression or expression during development of
Enah splice variants is still lacking.
In this study we obtained a more complete view on the
spectrum of expressed Enah and Evl splice variants. Next
to in silico analysis we validate the existence of the mouse
Enah splice variants by expression profiling of these transcripts during development, in tissues and in cell lines. In
addition, we propose uniform and consistent names for
all exons.

Results
ENA/VASP phylogeny

To investigate the general occurrence of the alternative
exons described in mouse or human ENA/VASP proteins
we first conducted an in silico analysis of ENA/VASP
members. To this purpose, we systematically retrieved
(predicted) protein sequences from ENSEMBL release 56
[14] and from NCBI [15] for human, mouse, chicken and
the model organisms Danio rerio and Xenopus tropicalis.
Because a number of these proteins were poorly or incorrectly annotated (hypothetical or by numbers) (see Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S1), we performed a
phylogenetic analysis to establish their correct identity
(Figure 2). For this analysis orthologues of mouse VASP,
EVL and the ENAH splice variants (originally described
by Gertler [3]), and selected sequences from the invertebrates Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Hirudo medicinalis, Caenorhabditis elegans and
Dictyostelium discoidum were used. This search and the
subsequent phylogeny yielded two surprising results. We
did not find a VASP orthologue in birds, and fish have
two Evl genes (D. rerio (Dr) Evla and Evlb in Figure 2) (see
Additional file 1: Supplemental Results). The phylogeny
also indicated that ENAH, EVL and VASP arose early in

vertebrate evolution (Figure 2 and additional file 1).
ENAH and EVL are more related to each other. Thus the
ancestral vertebrate ENA/VASP protein appears to have
first given rise to a VASP homologue and an ENAH/EVL
ancestor.
ENA/VASP gene structure

Having established the corresponding ENA/VASP homologues in the selected vertebrates we investigated conservation of their gene structures available in ENSEMBL (see
Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S2). In Figure 1, we
introduce a more uniform exon nomenclature. The gene
structures of vertebrate Enah, Vasp and Evl are largely
conserved, as they share thirteen coding exons with,
mostly, similar start and end positions and lengths (Figure 1). Exceptions are exon 5, which is much longer in
Enah and may encode a coiled coil domain (as predicted
by SMART) and Enah exon 6, which is absent in Vasp and

Evl. All investigated Vasp forms have this thirteen-exon
structure. Evl has fourteen exons because of the presence
of the extra alternatively transcribed exon (10a) between
exons 10 and 11. One exception is D. rerio Evl, which
appears to have no such exon. This extra alternatively
transcribed exon is also present in vertebrate Enah forms
(here 11a). Enah forms all contain seventeen exons
because two additional alternatively included exons (3a
and 3b) are present between exons 3 and 4. Additional
transcripts can be generated by an alternative upstream
splice event of exon 6, creating the longer exon 6L (exon
6L and 6 thus share the 3' part of the exon) (Figure 1).
Exon 3a corresponds to the previously identified exons
+++ or INV in mouse and human and exon 3b is the ++
exon in mouse. Exon 6L corresponds to the region spanning exon + and exon 6 [3-5].
Usage of the different exons adds amino acids to different parts of the ENAH protein (Additional file 2: Supple-

mental Figure S1). These may influence ENAH protein
function in different ways. By inclusion of peptides
encoded by exons 3a and 3b, nineteen and four amino
acids are respectively inserted between the EVH1 domain
and the proline-rich region of ENAH. This may alter the
protein binding properties of the EVH1 domain and thus
localization of ENAH, or change the relative position of
the EVH1 domain with respect to the proline-rich
domain. Insertion of exon 6L encodes an ENAH protein
with a longer proline-rich region and thus a protein that
may bind more profilins and/or multiple different SH3or WW- containing proteins. ENAH with the insertion of
the twenty-one amino acids encoded by exon 11a has a
longer EVH2 domain. This insert is located between the
actin binding motifs [3,5] and the tetramerization
domain. Because of a different orientation of the actin
binding region relative to the oligomerization domain,
the splice variants containing these extra amino acids
may have altered actin reorganization properties.
In silico evidence for EVL and ENAH alternative splice
variants

The extra exon 10a in Evl gives raise to two alternative
splice variants. TBlastN searches using the protein
sequence encoded by exon 10 and 11 with or without the
EVL-I sequence encoded by exon 10a, in expressed
sequence tag (EST) databases, readily revealed that both
transcripts exists in human, mouse, chicken and Xenopus
tropicalis. As mentioned above, there is no evidence from
the gene structure for an EVL-I exon in D. rerio and EST
searches also proved negative.
The Enah gene structure predicts that multiple splice
variants of mammalian ENAH can exist. In the NCBI
GenBank, however, only five mouse Enah reference
sequences of transcripts are present. Transcript 4 has no
alternatively
included
exons
[GenBank:
NM_001083121.1] and is usually referred to as the "general" Enah splice variant. Transcript 1 contains exons 3a
and 6L [GenBank: NM_010135.2], transcript 2 has exons
3b and 6L [GenBank: NM_008680.2] and, transcript 3
exon 6L [GenBank: NM_001083120.1]. In addition, a
form containing exon 11a has been deposited [Genbank:
XM_001473812.1]. Similarly, in human, only two reference sequence transcripts are present: transcript 1 containing exon 11a [GenBank: NM_001008493.1], and
transcript 2 is the general form [GenBank:
NM_018212.4]. Chicken has one reference mRNA
sequence containing exons 3b and 6L [GenBank:
NM_204300.1] and Xenopus (tropicalis and laevis) has
two reference mRNA sequences that are very similar and
have no alternatively used exons [GenBank:
NM_001126543.1 and NM_001092972.1]. In D. rerio the
general form [GenBank: NM_001045028.2] is present in
addition to an incomplete reference mRNA sequence

Page 4 of 13

[GenBank: NM_001013521.1]. Thus these reference
sequences give only marginal support for the use of the
alternatively included exons. We further explored their
usage by searching the EST database for the presence of
vertebrate Enah splice variants (see Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S3). Out of 224 mouse ESTs only one
contains both exons 3a and 3b, supporting the existence
of a transcript containing both of these exons. No EST
with solely exon 3a was uncovered whereas we found one
EST with only exon 3b. Of the other investigated organisms none had ESTs with exon 3a and/or 3b except for X.
tropicalis having one EST with exon 3b. Mouse, human
and chicken have, three, two and one ESTs with the exon
5_6L junction, respectively. It is of note that one of the
mouse ESTs also contains exon 3b (see Additional file 1:
Supplemental Table S3). There is no evidence for such
ESTs in X. tropicalis and D. rerio but interestingly in these
species we found three [GenBank: EL840056.1,
AL961188.2, DC145972.1] and one [GenBank:
EE690964.1] ESTs respectively lacking the entire exon 6.
A blast search performed with exon 11a on the mouse
EST database yielded five hits showing this exon is effectively used. EST searches also revealed that human (sixteen ESTs) and chicken (two ESTs) express an 11a
containing form. For Xenopus (tropicalis and laevis) and
D. rerio we did not find ESTs containing this exon. In
addition, for none of the investigated organisms we found
ESTs without intron S. In summary, from the EST databases there are singular observations that exon 3a is used
in conjunction with exon 3b and exon 3b with exon 6L,
whereas there is no evidence for combinations of 3a and
6L or 11a and 6L. Thus although the vertebrate Enah
gene can hypothetically generate 32 alternative transcripts, little information on the potential use of the alternative exons and their combinations is present in these
databases.
Expression profiling of mouse Enah transcripts;
experimental design and strategy

To further map which Enah splice variants are expressed,
we designed primers that are located on exon-exon
boundaries at the three sites where an alternative exon
can be included or excluded from the transcript (Figure
3A-B, Table 1). When such a forward and a reverse
primer are combined in a RT-PCR reaction, amplification
can only occur from a mRNA target that contains a certain combination of alternative exons (Figure 3A-B).
Whereas this increases specificity it automatically results
in primer pairs with different sensitivity. We chose, for
each primer pair, to perform reactions under a certain
condition (fixed total RNA concentration, fixed number
of PCR cycles, see Additional file 3: Supplemental Table
S4) where many samples gave a strong specific band and
nonspecific amplification occurred as little as possible.

Figure 3 Mouse Enah amplicons. A. Overview of 5' and 3' amplicons with exon 6. B. Overview of 5' and 3' amplicons with exon 6L. (A-B) All theoretical
amplicons are shown. Discrimination between different transcripts occurs by choice of primer pair or -when two amplicons can be formed in one RTPCR- by amplicon length (in case of the absence or presence of intron S) via agarose gel electrophoresis.

However, using this approach low abundant transcripts
may escape detection in a given sample. Indeed, in some
samples, increasing the number of cycles reveals amplicons that were not visible under the chosen condition
(Additional file 4: Supplemental Figure S2). Thus, the
absence of an amplicon does not necessarily mean that
the transcript is not there, but also that it may be below
the detection threshold. In fact, we noticed that longer
transcripts, for instance from exon-exon boundaries 3
and 4 to exon-exon boundaries 11 or 11a and 12) were
difficult to amplify in a reliable manner on all samples
(data not shown) whereas the same primers yielded products with primers located on exon 5 or 7 and 6/6L boundaries (see below). Therefore we divided the transcript into
two groups of amplicons: 5' amplicons and 3' amplicons.
The 5' amplicons potentially combine exon-exon boundaries 3_3a_3b_4 and 5_6L/6_7 and the 3' amplicons combine exon-exon boundaries 5_6L/6_7 and 11_11a_12 and
eventually provide information on presence of the S

intron (102 bp) via the length differences of these amplicons. Because both 5' and 3' amplicons always have either
the 5_6L or the 5_6 exon-exon boundaries, we also obtain
information on full length transcripts. An overview of all
possible alternative exon combinations of the primers
used and of the obtained amplicons is given in Figure 3AB.
Identification of exon 6-containing Enah splice variants

Theoretically, using this design sixteen different transcripts containing exon 6 (i.e. the shorter form of exon 6/
6L) can be amplified (combinations of four 5' amplicons
and four 3' amplicons). To maximize chances of detection, we probed expression of splice variants in a large
sample set i.e. developmental stages, in various adult tissues and in cell lines of different origin. We performed
four RT-PCRs (RT-PCR 1-4) to detect the four possible 5'
amplicons with exon 6 and two RT-PCRs (RT-PCR 5-6)
to detect the four possible 3' amplicons with exon 6 (RT-

PCRs 5 and 6 each can deliver two amplicons derived
from transcripts with or without intron S) (Figure 4,
details in panel A). Note that in RT-PCR 1 to 4 (with
primer Rev 7_6) also a product with exon 6L can be
amplified (Figure 3B) but because the elongation time
was optimized for the smaller amplicon, solely transcripts
with exon 6 were amplified. The specificity of the primers
was evident from amplification reactions on MVD7 cells
that do not express mouse ENAH (Figure 4D). In addition, all RT-PCRs performed in parallel (either embryonic
stages, adult tissues or cell lines) included a water control
(no template) and at least one sample in which the
reverse transcriptase was omitted (RT-). The quality of
the cDNA in each sample is evident from the amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Gapdh) and 18S ribosomal RNA (Rn18s) (Figure 4B-CD, two bottom panels).
We start by describing the RT-PCR-results for detection of exon 6-containing transcripts expressed in whole
embryos of embryonic stages E9.5 to E18.5 and in head
and body fractions of E16.5 to E18.5 (Figure 4B). All four
5' amplicons and the two 3' amplicons containing exon 6
were detected during development. We did not detect the
3' amplicons without intron S. Thus, consistent with EST
presence (see above), we confirm the existence of an Enah
transcript with both exons 3a and 3b (RT-PCR 2) and the
existence of a transcript with exon 11a in mouse (RT-PCR
6). However, we also detected the existence of new transcripts containing either exon 3a (RT-PCR 3) or exon 3b
(RT-PCR 4) together with exon 6. We observed the presence of all transcripts throughout the different stages,
except at the latest stages of embryonic development in
which some transcripts remain below the detection level
under the conditions used (Figures 4 and additional file 4:

supplemental Figure S2A, for RT-PCRs 1, 2, 4 and 6 with
higher cycle number).
We performed similar RT-PCRs on different mouse
adult tissues (Figure 4C). In kidney and heart we detected
all four 5' amplicons and the two 3' long amplicons. In the
other tissues tested (spleen, liver, lung, muscle, brain,
uterus, testis and stomach) we only revealed a subset of
mouse Enah transcripts. In liver and spleen, only amplicons without alternative exons are barely or not detectable: both the 5' and 3' amplicon in liver and only the 3'
amplicon in spleen (RT-PCR 1 and 5). Repeating RT-PCR
1 with more amplification cycles confirms the 5' amplicon without alternative exons is also present in spleen as
expected (Additional file 4: Supplemental Figure S2B).
Surprisingly, although transcripts lacking intron S were
shown to be preferentially expressed in spleen and also
present in the brain [13], we again did not detect these
transcripts in spleen, in the brain nor in any other tissue.
Mouse Enah 5' variants without exon 3a and 3b (which is
considered to be part of the ubiquitously expressed form),
amplified in RT-PCR 1 or with both exon 3a and 3b (RTPCR 2) are detected in most tissues, whereas 5' variants
with either exon 3a (RT-PCR 3) or exon 3b (RT-PCR 4)
show a more restricted and differential expression pattern. The Enah 3' amplicon without exon 11a (RT-PCR 5)
(part of the ubiquitously expressed form) is detected in all
tissues tested, whereas the Enah 3' amplicon with exon
11a (RT-PCR 6) is not (or hardly) detected in spleen and
liver.
We also tested different mouse cell lines for expression
of Enah transcripts with exon 6. The MVD7 cell line
derived from the Mena/VASP knockout is used as a negative control. We screened an embryonic and an adult
connective tissue fibroblast cell line (NIH/3T3 and L-929,

respectively), two neuroblastoma cell lines (Neuro-2a and
N18TG2), the WEHI-3 leukemia cell line, the SP2/0Ag14 myeloma cell line and three epithelial cell lines
derived from a primary prostate tumor of the transgenic
adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model
[16,17] (Figure 4D). In L-929 cells, no Enah transcripts
containing exon 6 were observed (see also Additional file
4: Supplemental Figure S2B). In the NIH/3T3 and the
Neuro-2a cell lines we clearly detected the 5' amplicon
with no alternative exons (RT-PCR 1) and both 3' amplicons either without (RT-PCR 5) or with (RT-PCR 6) exon
11a. In addition, NIH/3T3 cells express a transcript containing exon 3a (RT-PCR 3). In the TRAMP-C, WEHI-3
and SP2/0-Ag14 cell lines all four 5' amplicons and two 3'
amplicons with exon 6 are detected. Transcripts without
intron S are again absent.
Mouse Enah splice variants containing alternative exon 6L

Alternative exon 6L is the largest alternative exon (843
bp). This exon is translated to an extra proline-rich
sequence located between the LERER region and the central proline-rich region of the ENAH protein. This exon is
described to be expressed in the brain [3,18]. As is the
case for transcripts with exon 6, sixteen different full
length transcripts, with exon 6L potentially exist. To get
insight into the presence of these transcripts we used a
similar setup as in the previous section probing 5' and 3'
end amplicons separately. In this case, for detection of the
four possible 5' amplicons, a reverse primer overlapping
exon 6L and exon 5 was used (RT-PCR 7-10), whereas for
detection of the four 3' amplicons the forward primer is
located in exon 6L and overlaps the 5' exon boundary of
exon 6 (RT-PCR 11-12) (Figure 3B and 5A).
In samples of the developmental stages (Figure 5B) we
detected six out of eight theoretical amplicons. This
means that alternative exons 3a, 3b or 3a and 3b can be
combined with exon 6L and that forms with exon 6L and
11a also exist. Again, we could not detect transcripts
without intron S (reflected by single amplicons in RTPCR 11 and 12).
In adult mouse tissues (Figure 5C) the 5' amplicon with
solely exon 6L (RT-PCR 7) was detected in most tissues,
whereas the other 5' amplicons were observed in a more
limited set of tissues. This screening partially confirms
the reported enrichment of amplicons with exon 6L in
the brain, as six out of eight amplicons were detected in
the brain: 5' amplicons with exon 6L solely (RT-PCR 7),
with exon 6L and exon 3a (RT-PCR 9), with exon 6L and
exon 3b (RT-PCR 10), with exon 6L, 3a and 3b (RT-PCR
8) or with exon 6L and exon 11a (RT-PCR 12). However,
expression of exon 6L is not limited to the brain. This is
particularly evident in heart tissue where these six amplicons with exon 6L were also found (Figure 5C). Again, in
all tissues tested, transcripts without intron S were not

Page 8 of 13

observed. In spleen and liver no Enah transcripts with
exon 6L were detected. The other tissues revealed a subset of transcripts containing exon 6L.
The mouse cell lines were also tested for the expression
of splice variants containing exon 6L (Figure 5D). In L929 cells, no Enah transcripts containing exon 6L were
observed, which means that L-929 cells do not express
detectable levels of Enah (Figure 4-5D). In the neuroblastoma N18TG2 cell line six out of eight amplicons containing exon 6L were detected, again amplicons without
intron S were not observed. Only a subset of these six
amplicons were found for the other cell lines. The 5' and
3' amplicons that contain the alternative exon 6L without
exons 3a, 3b and 11a were, however, discovered in all cell
lines (with the exception of L-929 cells). In addition, the
splice variant containing the exons 6L and 3a was
detected in these cell lines.

Discussion
Previous expression studies have focused on the ubiquitously expressed form of mouse ENAH. Here we identify
new mouse Enah transcripts that have various combinations of alternatively included exons and thus provide a
more complete view of the expression profiles of distinct
Enah transcripts. This is of significance for studies linking
expression of certain Enah exons to proliferation or invasion of tumor cell lines [5,10-12]. Clearly, in these types of
informative correlative studies combinations of used
exons will have to be taken into account as well.
Protein sequences and the gene structures of vertebrate
Ena/VASP homologues are relatively well conserved.
Mouse Enah potentially gives rise to 32 different transcripts. An initial in silico analysis of Enah splice variants,
considering all species investigated (human and the
model organisms mouse, chicken, D. rerio and X. tropicalis or laevis), provided evidence for the existence of at
least one EST containing either exon 3a, 3b, 6L or 11a
(see Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S3). However,
we found no EST evidence for the absence of the alternative intron S. It is worth noting that we could only
retrieve a minimal set of ESTs containing these alternative exons. For mouse, we found 224 Enah ESTs of which
only nine have alternative exons. This validates that the
Enah splice variant without alternative exons is the ubiquitous form. Of these nine ESTs with alternative exons,
only four different alternative exon combinations were
found. One EST contains both exons 3a and 3b, one combines exons 3b and 6L, two contain only exon 6L and five
have only exon 11a. Because of the limited length of EST
sequences, we could not retrieve information about exon
combinations 3a and/or 3b with exon 11a. Moreover, a
Genbank search only retrieved five mouse Enah reference
sequences, whereas in theory, if all combinations of alternative exons and introns are used, 32 Enah transcripts

may exist. This indicates that the databases potentially
are a poor reflection of the true complexity of the Enah
transcript family. We therefore designed a RT-PCR
screen to investigate the presence of mouse Enah transcripts during development, in adult tissues and in cell
lines. As there might be a strong bias to the ubiquitous
Enah splice variant without alternative exons (as suggested by the frequency of its occurrence in EST databases), we probed specifically for sets of transcripts using
exon-specific primers. In an initial attempt we tried to
amplify long Enah transcripts to get information on all
possible exon combinations. We however failed to
amplify these products in a reproducible manner from
the various samples. Therefore we divided transcripts
into two amplicons that overlap at the exons 6 or 6L. We
detected, via this approach, the existence of eight Enah
transcripts with different 5' region exons and four Enah
transcripts with different 3' region exons (for an overview
see Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S3). This
proves that at least eight and maximally sixteen mouse
Enah transcripts exist. Until now, expression of variants
with exon 11a was only shown in human [5]. Here, we
show that mouse transcripts with exon 11a (either in
combination with exon 6 or with exon 6L) are expressed
in several tissues and cell lines.
Similar to the EST searches, we have no evidence for
transcripts without intron S in mouse. Tani and colleagues discovered mouse Enah transcripts without
intron S (in exon 7) using a similar RT-PCR set-up as the
one described here [13]. They performed a RT-PCR with
a forward primer located at the beginning of exon 7 and a
reverse primer located in exon 8 on cDNA of mouse adult
brain, spleen and on cDNA of embryonic day 17. Therefore, an amplicon representative for this splice variant
should in principle be present in our RT-PCR assays 5, 6,
11 and 12. We note, however, that in spleen also other
Enah transcripts are difficult to detect. It is however
unclear why we did not detect this splice variant in E17.5
or in the brain.
ENAH is expressed at high levels in the developing
mouse brain where it plays a role in regulation of growth
cone dynamics and axon guidance [18-20]. Consistent
with this, the screening of mouse embryonic stages shows
that all of the identified partial transcripts were found in
mouse embryonic stages and in head fractions at E18.5.
In adult mice, tissue specificity has been shown for some
mammalian ENAH splice variants. Mouse ENAH was
detected in several tissues by immunoblotting, but given
the aberrant mobility of the protein on sodium dodecyl
sulphate polyacrylamide gels and the small size contributed by the coding information in exons 3a (nineteen
amino acids) and 3b (four amino acids), it is unclear
whether such forms can be resolved by this technique. In
addition, the fact that few ESTs are present in the data-

Page 10 of 13

base suggests these transcripts are not abundantly
expressed and thus likely also the protein variants will be
rare. Mouse Enah splice variants with exon 6L are distinguishable from Enah splice variants with exon 6 via western blotting and are abundantly expressed in the brain
[3,7,18]. We confirm that all three described variants with
exon 6L are detected in the adult brain. In addition, a
transcript which has exon 3a, exon 3b and exon 6L and a
transcript containing both exon 6L and exon 11a are
present in this tissue. However, we find that exon 6L is
not exclusively used in the brain. Variants with exon 6L
are also present in other tissues in particular in heart.
This seems in contrast with earlier findings that ENAH
with the extra sequence encoded by exon 6L was only
detected via western blotting in the brain (and not in
heart, kidney, any other tissue tested or in NIH/3T3 cells)
[7,18,21]. RT-PCR is a more sensitive method and if
appropriately designed can also detect low abundant
transcripts. ENAH proteins containing the extra
sequence encoded by exon 6L might be present at levels
that are below detection level for western blotting. On the
other hand, post-transcriptional regulation might prevent the transcripts from being translated in vivo.
ENAH has been shown to be abundantly expressed in
heart and to be important for adult mouse heart function.
Indeed, the hearts of Enah knockout mice develop structural and electrical conductivity abnormalities postnatally (unpublished data mentioned in [22]). Also,
combined disruption of the localization of ENAH and
VASP in cardiac intercalated disks causes dilated cardiomyopathy and early postnatal lethality, whereas VASP
knock-out mice show no cardiac abnormalities [8,23,24].
Here we show that all of the discovered Enah transcripts
are expressed in mouse adult heart, which suggests
important specialized functions for ENAH splice variants
in adult heart.
We screened mouse cell lines for Enah splice variants,
and found that L-929 fibroblast cells do not detectably
express Enah. NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells do, however,
express several Enah transcripts, indicating differences
exist within cell lines of related origin. A similar difference was shown in [5] in which six human breast tumor
cell lines abundantly express ENAH, whereas in one
(DAL) it is hardly detectable. All other cell lines tested
express more than one Enah variant and N18TG2 cells
express all eight transcripts with different 5' end and four
transcripts with different 3' end and thus contain at minimum eight and possibly sixteen Enah transcripts. The
three prostate cancer cells are derived from a primary
prostate tumor of the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse
prostate (TRAMP) model and are of epithelial origin
[16,17]. These all three express splice variants with the
11a exon which has been previously correlated with an
epithelial phenotype and with proliferation of epithelial

Veniere et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/45

tumor cell lines [5]. Here, we in addition show that splice
variants with the 11a exon are also expressed in cell lines
that are not of epithelial origin. This is in line with recent
findings from Warzecha and collegues [25]. Although
these authors report that Enah with exon 11a is strongly
present in human epithelial cells and down-regulated
upon induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
they also show that this transcript is present at basal levels in MDA-MB-231, a cell line with a mesenchymal phenotype. Splice variants containing exon 3a (= INV) or 3b
have been associated with invasion [11,12]. Forms containing this exon are present in the TRAMP C1 and C2
cell lines that are invasive in vitro and tumorigenic when
grafted into syngeneic C57BL/6 hosts, but also in the C3
cell line that is non-tumorigenic [16,26]. Here, we show
that transcripts with exons 3a, 3b or both are present in
all cell lines tested (except for L-929). Expression of splice
variants containing exons 3a or 3b (in combination with
exon 6L) was shown in the brain indicating that expression of these exons is not limited to invasive cells [3]. We
note that Enah transcripts from invasive Polyomavirus
Middle T gene mouse transgenic tumors either contained
the 3a or the 3b exon but a combination of these two
exons was not found [11]. The TRAMP-cell lines do,
however, express such forms.

Conclusions
In summary, we report the expression of mouse Enah
splice variants, caused by variable insertion of four alternative included exons (3a, 3b, 6L and 11a), in a qualitative
way. By covering all possible exon combinations we provide the first strong evidence of the complexity in the
ENA/VASP family on the transcript level. If we take into
account all investigated developmental stages and tissues,
each of these splice variants has a unique expression pattern. In different cell lines different subsets of splice variants were detected, indicating mouse tissues and cell lines
have distinct profiles of Enah transcripts. We demonstrate by our approach that splice variants, identified in
specific studies and attributed to specific tissues or processes, display a wider expression profile. These observations will contribute to studies into understanding ENA/
VASP protein function on an organism-wide scale.
Methods
Cell culture

The MVD7 cell line was a kind gift of Dr. F. Gertler (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and was cultured as
described [27]. NIH/3T3 embryonic fibroblast cells, SP2/
0-Ag14 myeloma cells, Neuro-2a and N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells, L-929 adult connective tissue fibroblast
cells and WEHI-3 leukemia cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)-glutamax
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with penicillin

Page 11 of 13

(100 units/ml) and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and heat inactivated 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Hyclone-Perbio; Brackley, UK). Transgenic
adenocarcinoma mouse prostate-C (TRAMP-C) cell lines
(C1, C2, C3) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in
DMEM containing 4 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g/l glucose
without sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 μg/μl bovine insulin (Sigma)
and 10 nM 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO).
RNA isolation, Endpoint Reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Total RNA was isolated from flash-frozen mouse tissue
and embryos (Swiss mice) (RNeasy Midi, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or from collected cell lines (High Pure RNA Isolation kit) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. DNAse I (Qiagen or Roche)
treatment was performed at room temperature for 15
min (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or 20 min (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) depending on the kit used (RNeasy Midi,
Qiagen or High Pure RNA Isolation kit, Roche) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand DNA synthesis was performed using 2.5 μg of RNA using the
anchored -oligo(dT)18 primer (Transcriptor First Strand
complementary DNA (cDNA) Synthesis kit) (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed in a T3000 thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) with Faststart
taq DNA polymerase (1.5 mM MgCl2) (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland), dNTPs (200 μM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and target specific primers (0.2 μM). For mouse
Enah: target specific primers were designed based on
NM_008680.2,
[GenBank:
NM_010135.2,
NM_001083120.1, NM_001083121.1, BE863360.1 and
CF553956.1] (Table 1) and conditions for PCR reactions
with each primer set were optimized (see Additional file
4: Supplemental Table S4 for reaction conditions). Primers for household genes were designed as published [28].
The amplicons were separated on a 2% agarose gel or a
4.5% NuSieve GTG Agarose gel (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and for each amplicon a representative sample
was cloned with the TOPO-TA cloning kit for sequencing
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR product was cloned
in pCR4-TOPO and transformed into TOP10 E .coli cells.
Insertion of a PCR fragment causes disruption of the
lethal E. coli gene ccdB and permits growth of positive
recombinants. Cycle sequence reactions were performed
with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the T3000 thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) and analyzed
with the 3100 Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Phylogeny

Protein sequences (see Additional file 1: Supplemental
Table S1) were aligned with clustalW2 using the default
settings [29,30]. The resulting alignment file was converted with Forcon [31,32] and distances were calculated
with Treecon [33,34] using Poisson correction and bootstrap analysis with 500 samples. A neighbor joining tree
was constructed and rooted on the Dictyostelium discoidum VASP sequence. Parts covering the sequences
encoded by exons 3a and 3b, or 6L, or 11a flanked by the
sequences encoded by the preceding and the following
exon were used for TBlastN searches at NCBI in the reference gene sequence or EST sequence databases with a
restriction to human, mouse, chicken (or birds), Xenopus
(tropicalis and/or laevis) or zebrafish (or bony fish). In
case of searches for 5_6L encoded sequences or
sequences lacking the information of intron S the expectation value was set to 100 and low complexity filtering
was not applied (see Additional file 1: Supplemental Table
S1, Table S2 and Table S3 and NCBI links). The ENAH
domain structure was analyzed using the SMART tool
[35].
