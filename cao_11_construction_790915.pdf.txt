Construction of high quality Gateway™ entry
libraries and their application to yeast two-hybrid
for the monocot model plant Brachypodium
distachyon

Abstract
Background: Monocots, especially the temperate grasses, represent some of the most agriculturally important
crops for both current food needs and future biofuel development. Because most of the agriculturally important
grass species are difficult to study (e.g., they often have large, repetitive genomes and can be difficult to grow in
laboratory settings), developing genetically tractable model systems is essential. Brachypodium distachyon (hereafter
Brachypodium) is an emerging model system for the temperate grasses. To fully realize the potential of this model
system, publicly accessible discovery tools are essential. High quality cDNA libraries that can be readily adapted for
multiple downstream purposes are a needed resource. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) libraries are an
important discovery tool for protein-protein interactions and are not currently available for Brachypodium.
Results: We describe the creation of two high quality, publicly available Gateway™ cDNA entry libraries and their
derived Y2H libraries for Brachypodium. The first entry library represents cloned cDNA populations from both short
day (SD, 8/16-h light/dark) and long day (LD, 20/4-h light/dark) grown plants, while the second library was
generated from hormone treated tissues. Both libraries have extensive genome coverage (~5 × 107 primary clones
each) and average clone lengths of ~1.5 Kb. These entry libraries were then used to create two recombinationderived Y2H libraries. Initial proof-of-concept screens demonstrated that a protein with known interaction partners
could readily re-isolate those partners, as well as novel interactors.
Conclusions: Accessible community resources are a hallmark of successful biological model systems.
Brachypodium has the potential to be a broadly useful model system for the grasses, but still requires many of
these resources. The Gateway™ compatible entry libraries created here will facilitate studies for multiple userdefined purposes and the derived Y2H libraries can be immediately applied to large scale screening and discovery
of novel protein-protein interactions. All libraries are freely available for distribution to the research community.

Background
Use of the dicot annual Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) as a model system continues to revolutionize our
understanding of plant biology, but the development of
alternative plant models promises to address numerous
knowledge gaps. Especially relevant is the development
of additional models for the agriculturally important
grasses. Leading this charge is the emerging grass model

system Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium). Brachypodium is a monocotyledonous, C3 temperate grass
genus in the family Poaceae, subfamily Pooideae, which
is closely related to wheat, oats, and barley [1,2]. Like
Arabidopsis, Brachypodium has many advantageous features for genetic research, including small size, simple
growth requirements, and a relatively small genome
with diploid accessions [3,4]. While it would be preferable to directly study food crops (e.g., wheat) and biofuel
crops (e.g., switchgrass), they are generally lacking in
many of the desirable features that make Brachypodium
such an excellent model system. Thus Brachypodium

offers a relatively non-demanding entry point to study
the agriculturally important grasses.
From a small handful of highly engaged individuals to
the formation of the International Brachypodium Initiative (IBI), interest in using Brachypodium has steadily
grown since it was first proposed in 2001 [5]. A major
achievement for the IBI was the recently completed
sequence of the Brachypodium distachyon (diploid
accession Bd21) genome [6]. As happened with Arabidopsis 10 years earlier [7], completion of the Brachypodium sequence placed this model system on the fast
track for many exciting discoveries. To facilitate these
discoveries, many labs are actively building publicly
shared tools. For example, the Brachypodium genome is
well-annotated [6] and can be readily queried at several
online sites, such as http://www.brachypodium.org.
Numerous wild accessions have been collected and
shared with the research community [8,9]. Supported by
the underlying Bd21 genome sequence framework, these
wild accessions represent abundant natural diversity for
functional genetics studies. Essential methods for utilizing the genetic potential of Brachypodium are being
rapidly developed and refined. For example, high efficiency Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [10-12]
and optimized crossing techniques (http://brachypodium.pw.usda.gov/) were recently developed. Additionally, rapidly growing numbers of sequence indexed TDNA insertion lines are now publicly available, allowing
researchers to begin searching for loss of function alleles
in specific gene targets ([13], http://brachypodium.pw.
usda.gov/TDNA/). Therefore, many researchers are
simultaneously converging on Brachypodium as a viable
model system for studying the complex and agriculturally important grass lineage and most of the resource
building efforts have resulted in publicly available tools
that benefit the entire research community.
Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries are a particularly useful resource that have been developed for Brachypodium [14]. cDNA libraries are essential tools for
developing expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and
exploring an organism’s transcriptome. The development of highly efficient, in vitro recombination cloning
technologies (e.g., Gateway™ technology) recently made
it possible to capture cDNA libraries in entry vectors
that allow easy shuttling to various downstream destination vectors [15-18]. In fact, the transfer and use of
libraries originally cloned in recombination-ready entry
vectors is only limited by the availability of suitable
downstream destination vectors (or the willingness to
create new vectors) [15,16,19,20]. A previous study comparing the shuttling of libraries by conventional ligationbased techniques versus recombination-based techniques
demonstrated several major advantages of the latter

approach: simplified directional cloning, reductions of
chimeric clones, less size bias, and improved cloning
efficiency [18]. Therefore, the use of recombinationbased technologies to create cDNA libraries can greatly
improve user convenience, potential downstream uses,
and outcome quality.
One published example of a recombination-based
methodology was the creation of high quality Arabidopsis cDNA libraries and the subsequent transfer of those
libraries to yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) vectors [17]. Y2H
screens require high quality libraries and are one of the
most effective methods of identifying novel protein-protein interactions [21-26]. Most well established model
systems have publicly or privately available Y2H
libraries. Because the development of these libraries is
time-consuming and technically difficult, labs may be
precluded from attempting Y2H screens in the absence
of suitable cDNA libraries in appropriate vectors. Generally, suitable libraries (both entry and destination) have
large numbers of unique clones (>10 6 ) and sufficient
average clone lengths to ensure reasonable likelihoods
of obtaining interacting partners with a variety of protein baits. Because of the previously mentioned qualitative features associated with recombinant cloning, this
methodology is well-suited to the creation of Brachypodium cDNA libraries and their downstream shuttling to
Y2H vectors.
Similar to the approach for Arabidopsis, we describe
the creation of two Gateway™-ready Brachypodium
cDNA libraries suitable for various downstream applications, including Y2H analyses. The two entry libraries
represent Brachypodium mRNA populations collected
from plants grown under different photoperiods (20-h
and 8-h day lengths) or after eight different hormone
treatments (hereafter referred to as the photoperiod and
hormone libraries, respectively). Both libraries were
cloned into the Gateway™ entry vector pDONR222
(Invitrogen) and were subsequently transferred to the
Y2H “prey” vector pDEST22 (Invitrogen). Because our
lab is interested in the functions of NUCLEAR FACTOR
Y (NF-Y) transcription factors [27] and interactors are
already described for a subset of these proteins [28-30],
we isolated a Brachypodium NF-Y ortholog and used
this as “bait” to perform initial proof-of-concept screens
with both Y2H libraries. Demonstrating that the Y2H
libraries perform very well, we were able to readily isolate known and novel interactors. Therefore, the Y2H
libraries described here are immediately useful for protein-protein interaction studies and the cDNA entry
libraries can be shuttled and adapted for many other
downstream uses. All libraries, in their entry and Y2H
vector forms, are available for free distribution to the
research community.

Results and Discussion
Library Construction

Both libraries were constructed with the goal of maximizing the number of unique clones as opposed to constructing more narrowly representative “boutique”
libraries. We reasoned that performing screens against
multiple boutique libraries was not practical for most
groups. Additionally, the actual creation and initial testing of each library is relatively complex and time consuming. Therefore, we opted to build two libraries photoperiod and hormone - that each captured a relatively wide range of mRNA expression possibilities.
The photoperiod library represents mRNA from both
long day (LD, 20-h light/4-h dark) and short day (SD, 8/
16-h) grown shoots (entire aboveground plant) of two
week old plants collected over a ~24 hour period. The
LD cycle of 20/4-h was chosen because Brachypodium
is rapidly induced to flower under these conditions [31]
(as opposed to Arabidopsis where 16-h light is sufficient). The hormone library represents mRNA from
both roots and shoots of plants treated with eight different hormones (ABA, ACC, BL, GA3, IBA, KT, MeJA,
and SA - see Abbreviations), also collected over a 24-h
post treatment period to ensure the capture of early and
late response genes in the final library.
In addition to capturing Brachypodium mRNA from a
range of times and treatments for each library, we also
wished to maximize two important measures of library
quality [17]: absolute numbers of independent clones
and average clone length. To improve absolute numbers
of primary clones, we used commercially available electrocompetent cells with transformation rates of >1 × 109
cfu/μg. To maximize clone length, we used a combination of high quality reverse transcriptase enzyme (SuperScript™ III, Invitrogen) followed by column
chromatography (Sephacryl® S-500 HR resin, Invitrogen) to size fractionate the cDNA population (i.e., avoid
cloning truncated cDNAs and primers).
Treatment confirmations

For each library, we confirmed that treatments correlated
to expected transcriptional changes. For the photoperiod
library, we examined the expression of Brachypodium
orthologs for the genes GIGANTEA (BdGI, Bradi2g05230
[32]) and TIMING OF CAB 1 (BdTOC1/PRR1, Bradi3g48880 [33]; Figure 1A and Methods). These genes
were chosen because they are either central to the circadian clock or act as markers for output from the clock i.e., they are known to undergo differential peaks in
expression throughout the circadian cycle [32,34]. As
expected, both genes were expressed differentially during
the sampled light conditions relative to an internal reference gene (Bradi4g00660, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
[35], Figure 1A).

For the hormone library, we consulted the Oryza
sativa (rice) literature (primarily microarray data) for
appropriate hormone marker genes. After identifying
promising rice marker genes for each hormone, we
searched http://www.brachypodium.org for their respective Brachypodium orthologs. After testing two or three
candidates for each hormone, suitable (hormone responsive) orthologous Brachypodium marker genes were
found (Table 1 and Methods). Finally, we confirmed
that all of these marker genes were activated (or
repressed) by the appropriate treatment for the tissue samples used to construct the hormone library (Figure 1B).
Collectively, this data shows that the mRNA isolated to
construct the photoperiod and hormone libraries are
representative of broad temporal and induced gene
expression patterns.
Library Quality

The Heyl Lab (Berlin, Germany) previously created four
Arabidopsis Gateway™-ready libraries with, on average,
~7 × 10 5 primary clones [17]. Additionally, they
reported the average clone length for one of their cDNA
entry libraries (hormone) as 947bp. Because these Arabidopsis libraries have previously been screened with
excellent results (after shuttling to a Y2H vector)
[28,36], we set these quantitative measures as the
desired benchmarks for quality of the Brachypodium
libraries. The complete quality values for our hormone
and photoperiod Brachypodium libraries are summarized in Table 2. Both Brachypodium libraries had ~5.5 ×
107 total primary clones and average clone lengths of
~1,470 (hormone) and ~1,490bp (photoperiod). The
major increase in average clone length for our Brachypodium libraries is likely partly due to significant
improvements in reverse transcriptase enzymes over the
past few years. In fact, we created an early test library
using SuperScript™ II (instead of SuperScript™ III) and
our average clone lengths were considerably shorter
than those of the previously reported Arabidopsis
libraries (data not shown). Further, we utilized columnbased total RNA purification procedures (Methods); we
find that columns generally give lower quantities, but
higher quality RNA than TRIzol®-based methods. Based
on our main two criteria, we conclude that these Brachypodium primary libraries are high quality.
Shuttling Libraries by In Vitro Recombination

We next examined the results of transferring primary
libraries to a downstream destination vector. This was a
simple, single-tube, in vitro recombination reaction
using LR Clonase™ II to drive the transfer of primary
clones from the entry vector (pDONR222) to the Y2H
library destination vector (pDEST22). One major concern was the potential for size bias in these reactions - i.

Figure 1 Library treatment confirmations. (A) Photoperiod library. SD and LD expression is shown for BdGI and BdTOC1 for the samples used
to construct the photoperiod library (mean of four technical replicates/time point (±SEM)). Expression at each time point is relative to the REF
gene (Bradi4g00660 [35], see Methods). Note that this should not be interpreted as a rigorous quantitative analysis of either gene, but is shown
to demonstrate that samples used to construct the photoperiod library come from tissues experiencing varied light input with concomitant
changes in gene expression. However, the SD and LD peaks of BdGI at ZT8 and 12, respectively, are similar to a previous report [32]. (B)
Hormone library. Each treatment results in a clear change in the expression of the respective hormone marker gene. Quantitative values were
generated by ImageJ (see Methods).

e., it was possible that larger, full length clones would be
transferred with lower efficiency than less desirable, partial clones. It was previously demonstrated that the ability to capture larger clones in recombination-based
cDNA libraries can actually be improved relative to conventional ligation-based reactions [18]. Additionally, for
one of the previously described Arabidopsis libraries, no
significant size bias was measured between the entry
and destination libraries following the in vitro transfer
process [17]. Because our average clone size was
approximately 55% larger, we chose to reconfirm this
finding for our Brachypodium libraries. From Table 2,
average clone lengths are not significantly different after
recombinant transfer. We did not attempt to test the
outer limits of transfer efficiency for very large clones,
but we note that the largest transferred clone (from a
random sample of 50) was 8Kb in length. Thus, the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase reaction at amplifying
longer templates might actually be the major concern
where larger clones are highly desirable in a library.
Our results both confirm previous studies and extend
them to libraries with larger average clone lengths
[17,18]. It remains unclear whether or not specific entry
vector/destination vector recombination reactions might
affect the efficiency of insert transfer, but this will need
to be tested by the end user on a case-by-case basis. For

the purposes of creating the Y2H libraries described
here, we demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the average clone lengths after recombination
between pDONR222 cDNA entry libraries and pDEST22
destination vectors.
Proof-of-concept library screens

Although the quality features of both Y2H libraries
appear excellent, the most important measure is the
ability to effectively isolate interacting proteins. The best
protein choice for initial proof-of-concept screens is one
with well-described interacting partners. In this way one
can quickly determine whether or not screening each
library yields expected interactors. For choosing such a
candidate, there is currently very little published data
regarding particular Brachypodium proteins and their
known interactors. Nevertheless, we could infer likely
protein-protein interactions from Arabidopsis.
Because our lab is particularly interested in the functions of NF-Y proteins and we have developed Arabidopsis Y2H interaction datasets for several of these proteins,
we decided to use their Brachypodium orthologs for
initial proof-of-concept screening. We have previously
demonstrated that Arabidopsis NF-Y, subunit C3, 4, and
9 (NF-YC3, 4, and 9) proteins readily interact with various NF-YB and CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE,

TOC1) proteins in Y2H screens and by in vivo immunoprecipitation [28]. Additionally, using phylogenetic,
genetic, and biochemical approaches, we and others have
extended these results to demonstrate that NF-YB, NFYC, and CCT proteins cooperatively function in protein
complexes to control photoperiod-dependent flowering
[27-30]. Therefore, using NF-YC as the bait protein fulfilled our criteria for good proof-of-concept screening
material.
To perform this screen, we first used BLAST and phylogenetic analyses to identify three Brachypodium orthologs of Arabidopsis NF-YC3/4/9 (Bradi1g32200,
Bradi1g67980, and Bradi3g05270). To demonstrate that
these proteins would, at least theoretically, be good
choices to screen the Brachypodium Y2H libraries, we
initially performed directed Y2H tests against already
cloned Arabidopsis NF-YB (NF-YB2 and NF-YB3) and
CCT (CONSTANS (CO) and TOC1) proteins (Figure
2). From Figure 2, the Brachypodium NF-YC orthologs
all effectively interacted with a panel of previously
cloned Arabidopsis NF-YB and CCT proteins. However,
Bradi1g32200 and Bradi1g67980 both displayed low
levels of autoactivation (see the “EV” or empty vector
interaction rows). Because Bradi3g05270 did not display
any obvious autoactivation, we chose this protein to perform the actual proof-of-concept screens against the
Brachypodium libraries.
Using Bradi3g05270 as bait, 62 and 73 interacting
clones were isolated from the Brachypodium hormone
and photoperiod libraries, respectively. As expected, we
readily isolated BdNF-YB and CCT protein interactors
from both libraries (Table 3). However, the distribution
of interacting proteins was substantially different
between libraries. Only one CCT protein (2%) was isolated in the hormone library screen, while this same
class represented 51% of the interactors from the photoperiod library. Likewise, the BdNF-YB protein Bradi3g15670 represented 31% of the hormone library
interactors, but was not isolated from the photoperiod
library. While it is tempting to speculate about biological meanings for these types of results (e.g., is Bradi3g15670 activated strongly by one of the hormone
treatments?), caution is advisable as Y2H results can be
highly variable between screens. This can be true for the
same bait sequentially screened against the same library
[37]. The results here are similar to a screen we performed using NF-YC9 as bait against an Arabidopsis
library [28], although we found a higher percentage of
novel interactors with the Brachypodium libraries (35%
and 19% for the hormone and photoperiod libraries,
respectively, versus 6% for the previous Arabidopsis
screen). Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that
expected and novel interactors can be readily isolated
from these two libraries.

We have developed two Brachypodium Gateway™
cDNA entry libraries corresponding to both photoperiod
and hormone treatment time courses. Both libraries
have the hallmarks of any high quality cDNA library:

clone length (~1.5 Kb). Because these libraries were

generated in a Gateway™ vector, they have many potential downstream uses. The entry libraries were additionally transferred by recombination-based techniques to
create two unique Y2H libraries. Proof-of-concept
screens using the two Y2H libraries demonstrate that
expected interactors can be readily isolated against a
known bait. We note that a subset of the novel interactors isolated in the Brachypodium screen are likely to
represent parallel interactions in Arabidopsis and other
plant species. Therefore, researchers who do not work
with Brachypodium might also find generalizable value
in screening these libraries with their favorite Brachypodium ortholog.
All four libraries - i.e., the entry cDNA libraries
pDONR222-Hormone and pDONR222-Photoperiod and
the Y2H libraries pDEST22-Hormone and pDEST22Photoperiod - have been carefully amplified using a
reduced bias, semi-solid agarose method [38] and are
freely available for distribution to the research community (user pays shipping). Libraries will be mailed as lyophilized pellets with brief instructions on reconstitution,
and the recommended screening procedure for Y2H
libraries. There is no MTA associated with the distribution of these libraries, although end-users are requested
to cite this publication if they use these libraries for
published research. Material requests should be

Plant sample preparation and mRNA extraction

The community standard diploid inbred line of Brachypodium distachyon, Bd21, was used for generation of
both cDNA libraries. Seeds were initially de-husked and
sterilized by soaking in a solution of 25% household
bleach (5.25% NaOCl) supplemented with 0.1%
Tween20 for 30 min with occasional rocking. Sterilized
seeds were thoroughly rinsed four times with sterile
water and then placed on sterile Murashige and Skoog
(MS) agar (4.4 g/l MS salts with vitamins, 3% sucrose,
pH 5.8, and 0.4% phytagel). To provide sufficient vertical
space for two weeks of plant growth, we used Greiner
Bio-One disposable plant culture containers (distributed
by VWR). Seeds were cold-treated at 4°C for four days
and then transferred to a Conviron ATC13 growth
chamber growth chamber at 22°C, 150µE light intensity
(standard florescent bulbs).
For the hormone library, plants were grown for two
weeks in 16-h light/8-h dark (16/8) cycles. For each hormone, 12 plants were hormone treated by spraying the
leaves to runoff and allowing the residual hormone solution to soak into the growth media. The hormones used
and concentrations were as follows: ABA (100µM) ACC
(50µM), BL (50µM), GA3 (50µM), IBA (50µM), KT
(50µM), MeJA (100µM), and SA (50µM). Three plants
(root and shoot) were collected for each hormone treatment at 4, 8, 14, and 24-h after treatment, totaling 96
individual plants. For the photoperiod library, plants
were grown in 20/4 or 8/16-h light cycles for 14 days.
Shoot tissues were collected at zeitgeber (ZT) 4, 8, 12,
18, and 26. For each time point and light cycle, 8-10
plants were collected, totaling ~75 plants. All tissues
were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until mRNA extraction was performed.
To extract RNA, each hormone/time point sample
was ground in a frozen mortar and total RNA was
individually extracted using the E.Z.N.A. Plant RNA
Kit (Omega Biotek). Quality and quantity of extracted
RNA from all samples was confirmed by both agarose
gel visualization and spectrometry (NanoDrop™ 1000,
Thermo Scientific). mRNA was further extracted from
the total RNA fraction using the MultiMacs™ mRNA
Isolation Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Miltenyi Biotec). After completing purification of each
mRNA sample (each condition and time point), equal
quantities of mRNA from each sample were combined
and used in the construction of each library (see
below).

Construction, qualification and amplification of the entry
cDNA library

Following mRNA purification and first strand cDNA
synthesis, we used the Cloneminer™ II cDNA Library
Construction Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions to
create the entry libraries in pDONR222 (Invitrogen).
We experimented with both suggested options for size
fractionation of clones - gel purification and Sephacryl®
S-500 HR resin column size chromatography. We found
better results using the column chromatography and
both libraries were constructed in this manner. Resulting libraries were transferred to DH10B™ T1 phageresistant electrocompetent E. coli by electroporation (12
reactions/library, 25µl/reaction). Small aliquots were set
aside to perform serial dilutions and calculate the number of primary clones. The remaining transformed cells
were diluted with storage solution as per the Cloneminer™ II manual. To examine average clone lengths, we
isolated plasmid DNA by standard methods for ~50 randomly selected clones from each pDONR222 library. We
then digested the plasmids with the restriction enzyme
BsrGI (Fermentas) and calculated the size of all fragments, subtracting the vector backbone (summarized in
Table 2, gel images not shown). To examine average
clone lengths for the pDEST22 (Y2H) libraries, we performed double digestions on the individual clones with
MluI and SacI (Fermentas). Prior to recombinant shuttling and for bulking/distribution purposes, all libraries
were amplified by a semisolid agarose amplification
method that reduces bias in the resulting populations
[38]. A simplified version of this method can be found
in the pCMV-Script XR cDNA Library Construction Kit
manual at http://www.genomics.agilent.com/files/Manual/200465.pdf. Transferring the entry library from
pDONR222 to the Y2H destination library (pDEST22)
was done in a single tube recombination reaction using
LR Clonase™ II following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The reaction was 3µl pDONR222

Page 8 of 10

library (50ng/ µl), 3 µl pDEST22 vector (150ng/µl), 8µl
1x Tris/EDTA (TE) Buffer (pH 8), and 6µl LR Clonase™ II enzyme mix. The reaction was incubated at
25°C for 20-h and then transformed into 6 tubes of electrocompetent cells (50µl/reaction).
Confirming treatment effects

We used reverse-transcription, polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with known marker genes (rice orthologs, see below) to determine that hormone treatments
worked. For the RT-PCR reactions, a sample of total
RNA from each treatment (untreated and four hours
post-treatment) was first digested at 37°C for 30 minutes
with recombinant DNase I (Ambion/Applied Biosystems). cDNA was then generated using the RT enzyme
Superscript II (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA samples from each hormone treatment and the respective untreated controls were used in
standard PCR reactions.
To identify the Brachypodium marker genes corresponding to specific hormone treatments, we primarily
referred to hormone treatment microarray data from
various rice publications. The complete reference list by
hormone is as follows: ABA [39], ACC [40], BL [41],
GA3 [42], IBA [43], MeJA [44], KT [45], SA [46], REF
(UBC) [35]. We selected good candidates from the rice
data and queried the Brachypodium database for suitable orthologs using BLAST tools at two web sites:
http://www.plantgdb.org/BdGDB/cgi-bin/blastGDB.pl
and http://blast.brachypodium.org. We then used Geneious Pro 5.1.4 to design primers for each marker
(Table 4). We report here the best primer pair/marker
gene we identified for each hormone treatment,
although we typically tried two or three markers per
hormone (data not shown). For a uniformly expressed
control gene, we used the Brachypodium ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Bradi4g00660 [35]. To quantify differences in expression, gel images were imported into

ImageJ [47] and volume reports were created for each
gene under non-induced and hormone-induced conditions. Expression of each marker gene was normalized
against Bradi4g00660 expression from the same cDNA
sample, followed by calculating post hormone expression (induced/non-induced). In the same manner, we
used RT-PCR on the BdGI and BdTOC1 [32,33] to
determine that our photoperiod library was cycling as
expected.
Yeast two-hybrid - direct interaction tests and library
screening

Full-length coding regions of NF-YB2, NF-YB3, Bradi1g32200, Bradi1g67980, and Bradi3g05270 were directionally cloned into the Gateway™ entry vector
pENTR™/D-TOPO® as described by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen, cloning primers and pENTR clones available
upon request). CO and TOC1 clones (stock# GC105432
and G21896, respectively) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center in the pENTR223
vector. These entry vector clones were then transferred
to appropriate Y2H vectors to perform direct interaction
assays (or library screens for Bradi3g05270). All direct
interaction assays and library screens were performed as
described in the ProQuest™ manual (Invitrogen).
Library screens were performed with 10mM 3AT (3Amino-1,2,4-Triazole) to prevent false positive detection
due to any low level autoactivation by the DBD:Bradi3g05270 fusion protein. For X-Gal assays (Figure 2),
yeast colonies were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated in Z-buffer containing X-Gal (5Bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside,
Gold Biotechnology) after freezing in liquid nitrogen, as
described in the ProQuest™ manual.
