Abstract
Background: Type A influenza viruses are important pathogens of humans, birds, pigs, horses and
some marine mammals. The viruses have evolved into multiple complicated subtypes, lineages and
sublineages. Recently, the phylogenetic diversity of type A influenza viruses from a whole view has
been described based on the viral external HA and NA gene sequences, but remains unclear in
terms of their six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS).
Methods: In this report, 2798 representative sequences of the six viral internal genes were
selected from GenBank using the web servers in NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. Then, the
phylogenetic relationships among the representative sequences were calculated using the software
tools MEGA 4.1 and RAxML 7.0.4. Lineages and sublineages were classified mainly according to
topology of the phylogenetic trees and distribution of the viruses in hosts, regions and time.
Results: The panorama phylogenetic trees of the six internal genes of type A influenza viruses
were constructed. Lineages and sublineages within the type based on the six internal genes were
classified and designated by a tentative universal numerical nomenclature system. The diversity of
influenza viruses circulating in different regions, periods, and hosts based on the panorama trees
was analyzed.
Conclusion: This study presents the first whole views to the phylogenetic diversity and
distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal genes. It also proposes a tentative
universal nomenclature system for the viral lineages and sublineages. These can be a candidate
framework to generalize the history and explore the future of the viruses, and will facilitate future
scientific communications on the phylogenetic diversity and evolution of the viruses. In addition, it
provides a novel phylogenetic view (i.e. the whole view) to recognize the viruses including the
origin of the pandemic A(H1N1) influenza viruses.

Background
Type A influenza viruses can infect humans and many
kinds of animals including birds, pigs, horses and some
marine animals [1]. The viruses host eight segments in its
genome. The fourth and sixth segments encode the viral
external genes, HA and NA, respectively. The other six segments encode the viral internal genes, PB2, PB1, PA, NP,
MP and NS, respectively. The PB1, MP and NS genes each
encode two overlapping proteins (i.e. PB1-F2 overlapping
with PB1, M2 overlapping with M1, NS2 overlapping with
NS1). According to the viral external HA and NA gene
sequences and their serological features, type A influenza
viruses have been classified into 16 HA subtypes (H1H16) and 9 NA subtypes (N1-N9) [2,3]. The combinations of the HA and NA subtypes further formed dozens
of subtypes including H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2 and
H5N1. In addition, according to each of the viral internal
gene sequences, the viruses have been classified into some
lineages and sublineages, such as the North American lineage, the gull lineage, the human-like swine lineage, etc
[4-9].
In the past century, type A influenza viruses have become
highly diversified and complicated mainly through natural point mutations, cross-host transmission and genomic
segment re-assortment among or within the subtypes, lineages or sublineages [1-47]. Consequently, sometimes it is
difficult to locate a new influenza virus in the viral family
and trace its origin.
Recently, the panorama phylogenetic trees of type A influenza viruses based on their external HA and NA gene
sequences were described, which could be used as the
"maps" in tracing an influenza virus through phylogenetic
analysis of the two genes [3]. However, their phylogenetic
diversity from a whole view largely remains unclear in
terms of their six internal genes, though many papers have
been published on their phylogenetic diversity of limited
time, regions or hosts [4-9,15-39].
The six internal genes of type A influenza viruses were
important in phylogenetic analysis, as demonstrated
below in tracing the origin of the pandemic influenza
virus recently emerging in Mexico [41,42]. The new virus
was designated as A(H1N1) influenza virus by World
Health Organization and has spread to many countries.
Some experts claimed that the virus was an unusually
mongrelized mix of human, avian and swine influenza
viruses with the PB2 and PA genes from avian viruses and
the PB1 gene from human viruses, while some others
assumed that all the genes were from swine influenza
viruses. The latest reports indicated that both opinions
were somehow rational [40-47]. Here, we report the panorama phylogenetic trees of type A influenza viruses based
on their six internal genes, in order to further clarify the
origin of the A(H1N1) influenza virus from a new dimen-

sion, and establish a candidate framework for future scientific communications on the phylogenetic diversity and
evolution of the viruses.

Results
Statistics of sequences type A influenza viruses
Up to May, 20, 2009, 98261 sequences of type A influenza
viruses were available in GenBank. More than half of
them (61528) were from USA (36887), China (mainland:
12592, Hong Kong SAR: 5656), Australia (3444) and
Canada (2949). Additionally, most of them (96248) were
from humans (47958), birds (42282), pigs (4846) and
horses (1162), and most of them (86254) were from the
viruses isolated in or after the year 1990.

Up to May, 20, 2009, 7189 PB2, 7226 PB1, 7074 PA and
7238 NP sequences (≥ 300 amino acid residues) as well as
7954 NS1 and 8605 MP sequences (≥ 150 amino acid residues) were available in GenBank. They were taken as the
candidates of the representative sequences.
The panorama phylogenetic trees of the six internal genes
2798 (492 PB2, 450 PB1, 471 PA, 436 NP, 473 M, 476
NS) representative sequences were selected. Their designations and alignment were given in additional files 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6, respectively. Over half of them were from the
same viruses. Their phylogenetic trees were shown by Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The original tree files
with virus designations were given in additional files 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively.

Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 showed that the sequences of
each of the viral genes could be divided into 6-10 lineages,
and some of the lineages could be further divided into
several sublineages. The distribution of the lineages and
sublineages in hosts, isolation time and places were given
in the figures without description of the exceptions (most
of the exceptions were marked with asterisks in additional
files 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12). They were all located in separated branches in the phylogenetic trees and most of
them were of high bootstrap values (>70). Some lineages
or sublineages like S2.1 and S2.2 were of low bootstrap
values presumably due to the existence of intermediate
sequences [2,48].
The similarity of the phylogenetic trees of the six internal
genes
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 suggested that, with more or
fewer exceptions, the first lineage of the six internal genes
(S1.1, S2.1, S3.1, S4.1, S5.1 and S6.1) all largely corresponded to avian influenza viruses isolated from the
Western Hemisphere (North and South America). The
second lineage of the six internal genes (S1.2, S2.2, S3.2,
S4.2, S5.2 and S6.2) all largely corresponded to avian
influenza viruses isolated from the Eastern Hemisphere
(Europe, Asia, Africa and the Pacific). The third lineage of

the six internal genes (S1.3, S2.3, S3.3, S4.3, S5.3 and
S6.3,) all largely corresponded to seasonal human influenza viruses. The fourth lineage (S1.4, S2.4, S3.4, S4.4,
S5.4 and S6.4) all largely corresponded to classical swine
influenza viruses. The fifth lineage (S1.5, S2.5, S3.5, S4.5,
S5.5 and S6.5,) all largely corresponded to equine H3N8
or H7N7 influenza viruses isolated in the 1960s-2000s.
These five lineages covered most of the representatives for
each of the six internal genes.
The distribution of the main lineages of human (S1.3,
S2.3, S3.3, S4.3, S5.3 and S6.3), swine (S1.4, S2.4, S3.4,
S4.4, S5.4 and S6.4) and equine swine (S1.5, S2.5, S3.5,
S4.5, S5.5 and S6.5) influenza viruses in isolation places
and isolation time were consistent among the six internal
genes except that, as for the PB1 gene, subtypes H2N2 and
H3N2 human influenza viruses were located in the avian
lineage S2.1 rather than in the human lineage S2.3.
The heterogeneity of the phylogenetic trees of the six
internal genes
The phylogenetic trees were also somehow different
among the six internal genes, especially for avian influenza viruses. The most striking heterogeneity was that
avian influenza viruses were largely divided into two lineages corresponding to the two hemispheres, respectively,
based on the viral PB2, PB1, PA, NP and MP gene
sequences (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), but based on the viral
NS gene, they could be divided into two clusters each of
which could be further divided into two lineages or sublineages corresponding to the two hemispheres, respectively (Figure 6). This is consistent with a previous report
[8]. Another striking heterogeneity was that, based on the
viral PA gene, the avian lineage S3.1 corresponding to the
Western Hemisphere was too small and many viruses isolated in America in the 1970s-2000s were located in the
lineage S3.2 which was mainly corresponding to the
viruses isolated in the Eastern Hemisphere in the 1920s2000s (Figure 3). In addition, the lineage S1.7 covered a
few H7N3 subtype avian influenza viruses isolated from
South America based on the viral PB2 gene (Figure 1).
However, they were only a small branch (marked with
black triangles in additional file 8) within the sublineage
S2.1.4 along with some avian influenza viruses isolated in
the 1990s in North America based on the viral PB1 gene.
The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different
regions based on the six internal genes
Like the panorama phylogenetic trees based on the viral
HA and NA genes [3], the ones reported here based on the
six internal genes (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) suggested
that human and equine influenza viruses differed little
among regions, but avian influenza viruses demonstrated
obvious geographical differences. Many avian influenza
viruses isolated in the same hemisphere were situated in
the same lineages or sublineages, and many avian influ-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/137

enza viruses isolated in different hemispheres were situated in different lineages or sublineages.
The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different
time based on the six internal genes
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 suggested that, based on the six
internal gene sequences, all the influenza viruses isolated
from human, horses, pigs or birds showed more or less
time difference, e.g. the human H3N2 influenza viruses
isolated in the 1970s were different from those isolated in
the 2000s. The time difference among human and equine
influenza viruses was more obvious than swine influenza
viruses. Avian influenza viruses showed less time difference, i.e. some avian influenza viruses were similar to
each other, even though they were isolated in different
time periods (like A/turkey/England/N28/73(H5N2) and
A/chicken/Hebei/1/2002(H7N2) in terms of the PB2 gene
in additional file 7), and some avian influenza viruses
within the same lineage or sublineage were quite different
from each other even though they were isolated in the
same period and place (e.g. A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/
97(H9N2) and A/goose/Hong Kong/w222/97(H6N7) in
terms of the PB2 gene in additional file 7).
The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different
hosts based on the six internal genes
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 provided us a whole view on the
diversity of equine, human and swine influenza viruses.
As consistent with the viral HA and NA genes [1,3], the
diversity of influenza viruses isolated from horses was
simple without much divergence, and H7N7 subtype
equine influenza viruses disappeared from the earth at the
end of the 1970s [1]. Human influenza viruses were more
complicated than equine influenza viruses in diversity.
They were divided into H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 subtypes
each of which, however, diverged into few co-existing sublineages [26]. Avian influenza viruses were of higher
diversity than human influenza viruses. They diverged
into multiple lineages and sublineages, and most of them
contained many viruses distinct from each other in terms
of genetic distances.

Swine influenza viruses were also of high phylogenetic
diversity. They could be divided into at least three major
genotypes each of which were of multiple subtypes, as
described below. In addition, pig infections with avian,
human and equine influenza viruses were not rare, and a
few swine influenza viruses such as A/swine/Quebec/
4001/2005(H3N2) were strange in their gene sequences
(additional file 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).
Three genotypes of swine influenza viruses based on the
viral six internal genes
The phylogenetic trees based on the viral HA and NA
genes reported previously [3], and the ones based on the
six internal genes reported here, each have classified swine

Virology Journal 2009, 6:137

influenza viruses into several lineages and sublineages
(Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, additional files 13 and 14). The
combination of the six internal genes presented us three
major genotypes of swine influenza viruses circulating in
the world in the past decades.
The first genotype is the classical swine influenza viruses
circulating worldwide at least from the 1930s-2000s. This
genotype is equal to the whole or a part of the lineage
S1.4, S2.4, S3.4, h1.3, S5.4, n1.3, S7.4, S8.4 of the relevant
genes (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, additional files 13 and
14), respectively, with representatives A/swine/Iowa/15/
1930(H1N1) and A/swine/Iowa/15/1985(H1N1).
The second genotype is the avian-like or so-called "Eurasian"
lineage swine influenza viruses presumably emerging in
Europe in the 1970s and circulating only in Eurasia till date
with representatives A/swine/Belgium/WVL1/1979(H1N1)
and A/swine/England/WVL16/1998(H1N1). This genotype
is equal to the sublineage S1.2.6, S2.2.6, S3.2.6, h1.1.3,
S5.2.3, n1.1.7, S7.2.6, S8.2.2 of the relevant genes (Figures 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, additional files 13 and 14), respectively. Its
eight genomic segments all came from avian influenza
viruses circulating in the Eastern Hemisphere.
The third genotype is the re-assortant swine influenza
viruses presumably emerging in the 1990s and circulating
worldwide [49]. It corresponds to the whole or a part of
the lineages S1.1.4, S2.1.9, S3.2.10, h1.3.2, S5.4.2, n1.3.2,
S7.4.2, S8.4.3 of the relevant genes (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6, additional files 13 and 14), respectively. The NP,
NS and MP genes of the genotype were from the first genotype swine influenza viruses. The PB1 gene of the genotype was from human H3N2 viruses and the PB2 and PA
genes of the genotype were both from avian influenza
viruses. Viruses within this genotype include A/swine/
Korea/CAS08/2005(H1N1),
A/swine/Korea/JL01/
2005(H1N2), A/swine/Korea/CAN04/2005(H3N2), A/
swine/Minnesota/sg-00240/2007(H1N1), A/swine/Minnesota/sg-00239/2007(H1N2), A/swine/Minnesota/sg00237/2007(H3N2).
The majority of the viruses from the first genotype were
H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes of swine viruses. The majority
of the viruses from the second and third genotypes were
H3N2, H1N2 and H1N1 subtypes of swine viruses. A few
H3N1 subtype isolates were also identified in the third
genotypes. In addition, as showed by the aforementioned
isolates in the third genotype, multiple subtypes of swine
influenza viruses within the same genotype could circulate in the same region in the same year.
The origin of the new A(H1N1) influenza virus emerging in
North America in 2009
The sublineage of the new A(H1N1) influenza virus was
situated at the top of the six panorama phylogenetic trees

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/137

(Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). From the panorama phylogenetic trees and additional files 13 and 14, as given in Figure 7, the NA and M gene of the new virus should be from
the aforementioned second genotype of swine influenza
viruses circulating in Eurasia from 1979 to the 2000s. The
other six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS) of
the new virus should be from the third genotype of swine
influenza viruses circulating worldwide from 1998 to the
2000s which hosted genes from human, avian and swine
influenza viruses. In addition, five genes (PB2, PB1, PA,
NA and MP) of the new virus could be traced back to avian
influenza viruses, and the evolution of the PB1 gene had
an additional stop in human populations.
Cross-species transmission in the evolution of type A
influenza viruses
Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 suggested that
horses were seldom infected with influenza viruses of
other hosts, and birds were seldom infected with mammalian influenza viruses. However, it was not rare for pigs to
be infected with avian or human influenza viruses and
humans to be infected with swine influenza viruses. However, human infections with an avian influenza virus were
still rare except for the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza viruses circulating in the Eastern Hemisphere in
recent years.
The phylogenetic trees calculated using the maximum
likelihood model
The phylogenetic trees calculated using the maximum
likelihood model were of no obvious difference from
those calculated using the neighbor-joining model,
regarding to the clades of bootstrap values higher than 70,
and the lineages and sublineages classified herein were
also rational for the trees calculated using the maximum
likelihood model. Additional file 15 is an example, which
shows the panorama phylogenetic tree of the viral PB2
gene calculated using the maximum likelihood model.

Discussion
Calculation and readout of the phylogenetic trees
This report plus a previous one [3] constitute the whole
phylogenetic views of all the segments of the viral
genomes. The web servers of Influenza Virus Resource in
NCBI simplified greatly in the calculation of the phylogenetic trees. Otherwise, it should take several years to finish
the work. The trees could not be calculated or correctly
calculated if the sequences were shorter than a threshold.
Therefore, all the representative sequences were of certain
length limitation.

The representative sequences were not selected according
to the size and composition of the lineages or sublineages,
and thus the trees could not give the actual size and composition of the lineages and sublineages. In fact, the
sequences which are specially distributed in hosts, regions

and time were of higher probabilities to be selected as the
representatives than common ones.
Explanations of the heterogeneities of the panorama
phylogenetic trees
The heterogeneities among the panorama phylogenetic
trees of the six internal genes could be partially explained
as the results of re-assortment of the viral genes [1,11]. For
example, subtypes H2N2 and H3N2 human influenza
viruses obtained their PB1 gene from an avian influenza
virus through re-assortment [22]. Therefore, they were
located within the avian lineage rather than a human lineage based on the viral PB1 gene. In principle, re-assortment of influenza viruses could occur between or within
subtypes, lineages and sublineages. Re-assortment might
be a partial basis of the second striking heterogeneity
observed in avian influenza viruses mentioned above.
That is to say, it is possible that the PA gene of an avian
influenza virus from the Eastern Hemisphere flowed into
the Western Hemisphere in the 1970s, and replaced the
PA gene of many avian influenza viruses circulating in the
Western Hemisphere through many times of re-assortment, and became established there in multiple subtypes
thereby. This assumption was supported by a newly published paper [28], and additional file 9 which showed that
some avian influenza viruses isolated in the Eastern Hem-

isphere in the 1970s within the sublineage S3.2.8 were
quite similar to those isolated in the Western Hemisphere
in the same period within the sublineage S3.2.9.
Heterogeneity of the lineages in mutation rates and divergence also could cause the differences in the structures of
the phylogenetic trees. This might be a partial basis of the
first striking heterogeneity observed in avian influenza
viruses mentioned above.
Cross-species transmission and the role of pigs in the
evolution of type A influenza viruses
In principal, the frequencies of the cross-host infections
are positively correlated to multiple parameters including
the population size of the donor hosts and the receiver
hosts as well as their contact opportunities. In addition,
the cross-host infections are highly restricted if the cellreceptor of the receiver hosts do not match the viruses
from the donor hosts [50,51]. Pigs are of large populations in many regions in the world and have many opportunities to contact birds and humans. Their cell-receptors
match both human and avian influenza viruses [50].
Therefore, it is rational that pig infections with avian or
human influenza viruses are frequently identified. For this
reason, pigs should play an important role in the emergence of new human influenza viruses as an "incubator"

Page 11 of 17

Virology Journal 2009, 6:137

of them. On the other hand, horses are of smaller populations and of cell-receptors matching avian rather than
swine or human influenza viruses [51]. Therefore, it is reasonable to identify here that horses were seldom infected
with influenza viruses of other hosts (additional files 7, 8,
9, 10, 11 and 12), and the equine lineages or sublineages
are genetically closer to the avian ones than others in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
The significance of the panorama phylogenetic trees of the
six internal genes
The panorama phylogenetic trees of the six internal genes
reported here provided us not only a whole view on the
diversity of type A influenza viruses, but also a candidate
framework to generalize the history and explore the future
of the viruses. The human pandemics of H2N2 subtype in
1957 and H3N2 subtype in 1968 [19,22], the severe outbreak of equine influenza with an avian-like H3N8 virus
in China in 1989 [27], and the emergence of the new
A(H1N1) virus in 2009 [41-47], all could be marked in
the panorama "maps". As for the future, it is easier with
the guide of the panorama "maps" to determine whether
an isolate is special or odd in epidemiology (like A/duck/
Victoria/5384/2002(H4N8) in lineage S1.2 in Figure 1)
[52], and whether an isolate is originated from genetic reassortment. As showed by the example in tracing the origin of the new A(H1N1) influenza virus, the panorama
phylogenetic trees indicated that all the genes in the pandemic virus were directly from swine influenza viruses,
but if based on some partial phylogenetic trees, we might
wrongly conclude that the viral PB1 and PB2 genes were
directly from a human virus and an avian influenza virus,
respectively.

The panorama phylogenetic trees also gave us some novel
information to recognize type A influenza viruses. Firstly,
avian influenza viruses of each subtype were usually classified into Eurasian and North American lineages in the
past presumably due to confinement of birds to the distinct flyways of each hemisphere [1,20,28], and here the
two lineages were confirmed by the sequences of the viral
PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and M genes, but their geographical distribution should be enlarged to the Eastern and Western
Hemisphere, respectively. Moreover, the avian influenza
viruses based on the viral NS genes were more complicated than the two lineages as mentioned above [8]. Secondly, most of the sequences of the six internal genes are
of somehow host, geographical, time features. This could
be utilized in the identification of an influenza virus, i.e.
sequencing an internal gene of an influenza virus sometimes could indicate the profile of the virus. For example,
if the sequence of the NS gene of an influenza virus
belongs to S1.5, it is likely for the virus to be an equine
influenza virus. Since the six internal genes are more conserved than the external HA and NA genes, identification

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/137

of an influenza virus based on the internal genes could be
easier than on the external genes. Thirdly, the panorama
trees offered us a new dimension to recognize that pigs
may play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of type A influenza viruses of different hosts. Fourthly,
the representative sequences given in additional files 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 for constructing the panorama trees could be
easily visualized using the software MEGA, and the variable or the conserved regions in the genes could be easily
found using the "Color Cells" function in the menu of
"Display" of the software tool. Such information is useful
at least for PCR primer design.
The bias of the panorama phylogenetic trees of the six
internal genes
It is possible that the panorama views reported here
reflected only a part of the reality. This is consistent with
the principle of iceberg phenomenon in epidemiology,
i.e. the part the reality of diseases or infections discovered
by epidemiological analysis is something like the iceberg
on the surface, and the majority of the iceberg is underwater and unseen. Firstly, few isolates have been reported
from South America and Africa presumably due to inadequate surveillance, and influenza viruses in marine mammals also remain largely unknown. Secondly, only a few
genes of many influenza viruses detected in laboratories
were sequenced and reported. For example, some parts of
the genomes of more than two fifths of the viral isolates,
whose sequences were selected as representatives in this
report, were not sequenced and reported to GenBank. As
a result, we could not select the representative sequences
for the six internal genes all from the same viruses. Moreover, some sequences or viral designations were reported
to GenBank with errors which could distort the phylogenetic trees described here [52]. For example, the designations of two isolates within the second genotype of swine
influenza viruses (i.e. the lineage S1.2.6 of the PB2 gene),
A/swine/Virginia/670/1987(H1N1) and A/swine/Virginia/671/1987(H1N1), were changed in GenBank as A/
swine/Italy/670/1987(H1N1) and A/swine/Italy/671/
1987(H1N1), respectively, in May, 2009. The designations either before or after the changing were wrong, and
this error determines whether the Eurasian lineage of
swine influenza viruses has ever existed in North America
or not.

In general, three types of biases could exist in the panorama trees reported here. The first is sampling bias, i.e. not
all samples of type A influenza viruses circulating in the
world have equal opportunities to be collected for detection. The second is detection bias, i.e. not all type A influenza viruses detected in laboratories have equal
opportunities to be detected correctly and thoroughly.
The third is reporting bias, i.e. not all the sequences of
influenza viruses detected in laboratories have equal

Virology Journal 2009, 6:137

opportunities to be correctly reported to GenBank. It
should be careful in epidemiological inference due to
these biases. For example, we could not conclude that
there were few influenza virus circulations in Africa or
South America in the past decades because few influenza
virus sequences reported there.
The tentative universal nomenclature system of the
lineages and sublineages
Classification and designation of the lineages and sublineages within type A influenza virus are essential for the
studies of the viral evolution, ecology and epidemiology
[1-47]. In this report, decades of lineages and sublineages
within type A influenza viruses were identified, and most
of them were supported by the topology of the phylogenetic trees and high bootstrap values (>70) at relevant
nodes. They were also of more or less specific distribution
in hosts, regions and time.

Because of the heterogeneities of the phylogenetic diversity among the six internal genes, the classification of the
lineages and sublineages of the six internal genes could
not be unified into the same profile.
In this report, we tentatively proposed a numerical nomenclature for the lineages and sublineages based on the six
internal genes. It is informative and specific as it begins with
the segment number. Because only two hierarchies are
involved in the nomenclature for simplicity, some sublineages were probably evolved from other sublineages. Meanwhile, some sublineages could be further divided into some
clades to describe the diversity in more details.
The nomenclature reported herein covers nearly all
known type A influenza viruses, and it is easy to be
expanded to meet the future evolution of the viruses. For
example, a new sublineage, S1.2.7, could be assigned to
the special isolate A/duck/Victoria/5384/2002(H4N8)like viruses in Figure 1, if needed.
The proposed nomenclature is easy to remember as it is of
certain orders as given in Methods. This nomenclature, if
widely accepted, should facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of
type A influenza viruses through the unification of current
miscellaneous nomenclatures which are not only ambiguous and misleading in some cases, but also covered only
a part of the diversity of type A influenza viruses. For
example, the so-called "North America lineage" swine
influenza viruses actually circulated widely in North
America and Asia in recent years.
Proposal to establish an ad hoc international expert group
on nomenclature of influenza viruses
Influenza viruses are of high significance in human and
animal health, and they are very complicated and contin-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/137

uously evolving. Therefore, it is desired to establish an ad
hoc international expert group responsible to double
check some special isolates, select the representative
sequences, calculate the panorama phylogenetic trees,
classify the lineages and sublineages and propose a universal nomenclature for influenza viruses and update
them in time in the future. This is not that difficult as there
have been many human or animal influenza reference
laboratories (international and national). We recognize
that our results are of reference value to the issues but also
might be of some flaws.

Conclusion
This study describes the first panorama analysis of the
phylogenetic diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal genes. It also proposes a tentative universal nomenclature system for the
lineages and sublineages within the viral type. It provide a
novel phylogenetic view (i.e. the whole view) to recognize
the viruses including the origin of the pandemic A(H1N1)
influenza viruses. It also presents a candidate framework
to generalize the history and explore the future of the
viruses.

Methods
Primary analysis online and selection of representative
sequences
Till May 20, 2009, 7500-8800 sequences of each of the
PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP and NS genes of type A influenza
virus isolates were available in GenBank. They were analyzed online using the web servers of Influenza Virus
Resource in NCBI in sequence search, alignment and phylogenetic analysis [53,54]. For each gene, the sequences
were divided into multiple groups according to the virus
isolation time, and each group covered three years. If
some time-continuous groups totally contained less than
400 sequences, they were combined into one group. If a
group contained more than 600 sequences, they were further divided into several groups according to their isolation places or hosts until each group covered no more
than 400 sequences. The phylogenetic relationships
within each group were then analyzed using the online
web servers. Lineages and sublineages of each group were
classified online thereafter according to the principle
stated below.

At least one representative from each of the lineages and
sublineages was randomly selected with consideration of
the distribution of the lineages and sublineages in hosts,
isolation places and subtypes. That is to say, at least one
representative was selected from those within the same
sublineage provided they were distinct from the majority
of the sublineage in the distribution of hosts, places, time
or subtypes, and also at least one representative was
selected from the majority. Most lineages or sublineages
of avian influenza viruses are of multiple HA or NA subPage 13 of 17

Virology Journal 2009, 6:137

types, and so their representatives were selected with little
consideration of subtype. On the other hand, most lineages or sublineages of human, swine or equine influenza
viruses are of limited HA or NA subtypes, and thus at least
one representative was selected from each of the subtypes,
if available. Human and equine influenza viruses are
largely of little geographical difference, and so their representatives were selected with little consideration of isolation places. However, avian influenza viruses isolated in
the Eastern Hemisphere (Asia, Europe, Africa and the
Pacific) were usually different from their counterparts isolated in the Western Hemisphere (North and South America), and thus at least one representative was selected from
each of the hemispheres, if available. In addition, at least
one representative was selected from those of similar distribution within the same sublineage provided that they
were distant from others (genetic distances approximately
more than 3.0%. The value is not a strict standard for such
an analysis. If the value is higher, fewer representative
sequences will be selected, which is of little influence on
the final trees [25]). Representatives of each of the genes
were favorably selected from the same viruses in order to
facilitate the comparison of the phylogenetic diversity of
the genes [30].
Calculation of genetic distances
Genetic distances among the representative sequences
were calculated using the model of nucleotide maximum
composite likelihood including transitions and transversions using the software MEGA 4.1 [55]. The substitution
rates were set equal among sites but different among lineages. Gaps were treated by pairwise-deletion, i.e. ignoring
only the gaps that are involved in the comparison of a pair
of sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis
Representative sequences were aligned using the software
of Clustal X [56], and the results were manually checked
by eyes. Their phylogenetic relationship was analyzed
using the software MEGA 4.1 with neighbor-joining
method and the same parameters for the genetic distance
calculation [55]. Bootstrap values were calculated out of
1000 replicates.
Evaluation of the phylogenetic analysis results
All the sequences of each of the six internal genes of the
viruses isolated from a certain host or in a certain period
available in GenBank were sought as the test sequences.
Their phylogenetic diversity was analyzed online using
the web servers of Influenza Virus Resource in NCBI
[53,54], and compared with the panorama phylogenetic
trees calculated above to check whether the phylogenetic
trees covered the diversity of the test sequences or not.

The phylogenetic relationships among the representatives
were also calculated using RAxML version 7.0.4 with Gen-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/137

eral Time Reversible (GTR) substitution matrix according
to the maximum likelihood (ML) model [57,58], to evaluate the results obtained with neighbor-joining method.
Classification of lineages and sublineages
Lineages and sublineages were classified mainly based on
the topology of the phylogenetic trees, i.e. each lineage
and sublineage should be of a relatively separate cluster in
the trees. Distributions of the viruses in hosts, regions and
time were also considered in the lineage and sublineage
classification. For example, a branch within the trees
might be classified as a sublineage provided it is of a distinct host even if it was of a low bootstrap value.

Designation of the lineages began with the segment
number which was followed by a point and another
number (e.g. S2.1 represents the first lineage of the second
segment corresponding to PB1 gene), and designation of
the sublineages began with the lineage designations followed by a point and a number (e.g. S2.1.1 represents the
first sublineage within the lineage S2.1). The numbers
within the designations of the lineages and sublineages
were favorably in the order from the major to minor ones
in terms of the numbers of representative sequences, and
in the order of avian ones followed by human, swine,
equine ones in terms of hosts, and in the order of the
Western Hemisphere followed by the Eastern Hemisphere
in terms of isolation places, and in the order from the past
to nowadays in terms of isolation time.
