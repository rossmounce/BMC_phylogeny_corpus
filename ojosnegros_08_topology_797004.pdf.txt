Abstract
Background: The molecular events and evolutionary forces underlying lethal mutagenesis of virus
(or virus extinction through an excess of mutations) are not well understood. Here we apply for
the first time phylogenetic methods and Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ) to monitor
genetic distances and intra-population structures of mutant spectra of foot-and-mouth disease
virus (FMDV) quasispecies subjected to mutagenesis by base and nucleoside analogues.
Results: Phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have revealed a highly dynamic variation of
intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies. The population diversity first suffers striking
expansions in the presence of mutagens and then compressions either when the presence of the
mutagenic analogue was discontinued or when a mutation that decreased sensitivity to a mutagen
was selected. The pattern of mutations found in the populations was in agreement with the
behavior of the corresponding nucleotide analogues with FMDV in vitro. Mutations accumulated at
preferred genomic sites, and dn/ds ratios indicate the operation of negative (or purifying) selection
in populations subjected to mutagenesis. No evidence of unusually elevated genetic distances has
been obtained for FMDV populations approaching extinction.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic and PAQ analysis provide adequate procedures to describe the
evolution of viral sequences subjected to lethal mutagenesis. These methods define the changes of
intra-population structure more precisely than mutation frequencies and Shannon entropies. PAQ
is very sensitive to variations of intrapopulation genetic distances. Strong negative (or purifying)
selection operates in FMDV populations subjected to enhanced mutagenesis. The quantifications
provide evidence that extinction does not imply unusual increases of intrapopulation complexity,
in support of the lethal defection model of virus extinction.

Background
RNA viruses replicate as mutant distributions termed viral
quasispecies. This is a consequence of high mutation rates
operating during RNA genome copying, due to the
absence of proofreading-repair activities in the relevant
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and RNA-dependent
DNA polymerases [1,2]. Most phylogenetic relationships
among RNA viruses have been established using the consensus (or population) genomic sequences that represent
a weighted average of multiple, closely related sequences
present at each time point, in each virus sample obtained
for analysis [3]. Phylogenetic relationships established
with consensus viral sequences have been instrumental to
classify viruses and to determine origin of emergent
viruses and rates of virus evolution [1,4,5]. For many purposes it is important to analyze phylogenetically the relationship among different genomes from the same mutant
spectrum of a viral quasispecies. This type of analysis may
reveal the existence of genome subpopulations within
mutant spectra that might encode different phenotypic
traits. Also, it allows the calculation of average genetic distances among individual components of the mutant spectrum, a parameter that can be a predictor of biological
behaviour [1]. As an example, a study with a poliovirus
mutant which displays a -3-to 5-fold higher template-copying fidelity than the wild type documented that a narrow
mutant spectrum impeded the virus to reach the brain of
susceptible mice and produce neuropathology [6,7]. An
early study documented that complexity of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus quasispecies influenced the
pathogenic potential of this virus for mice [8]. A broad
hepatitis C (HCV) virus mutant spectrum was associated
with poor response to treatment by ribavirin and interferon α [9], and rapid early evolution of the virus led to a
chronic infection [10]. Some studies have found an association between a reduction of mutant spectrum complexity of HCV at early stages of treatment and viral clearance
([11]; reviewed in [12]). Recently, the role of the mutant
spectrum in adaptation of West Nile virus has been documented [13,14]. Therefore, there is a need to develop
methods to describe the relationship among components
of mutant spectra in viral populations.
An estimate of the complexity and internal relationships
among genomes within a mutant spectrum can be
obtained through application of distance-based phylogenetic methods, such as neighbour-joining (NJ) [15] or
maximum likelihood [16] procedures. However, the reliability of the derived genome clusters may be questionable when the number of mutations distinguishing
different components of a mutant spectrum is small.
Small genetic distances among genomes of a mutant spectrum are found when a viral clone (single genome) has
undergone a limited number of passages in cell culture
[17]. Despite this limitation, the general topology of a NJ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/207

tree may be robust enough to provide information about
the evolutionary pattern undergone by the viral population.
An alternative method developed to group closely related
sequences is Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ),
which is considered a non-hierarchical clustering method
[18]. PAQ groups together the viral sequences separated
by the shortest genetic distances. For this purpose a centre
genotype that nucleates a group of sequences within a circle (cluster) with a previously set radius is selected. High
compactness of a group is defined by having a larger
number of variants near the centre of the circle than at its
boundary. In this fashion, multiple, overlapping or nonoverlapping groups can be defined within mutant spectra
of viral quasispecies. PAQ has been successfully used to
analyze subpopulations of equine infectious anemia virus
[19], Ty1-copia retrotransposon sequences [20], regulatory sequences of bovine viral diarrhoea virus [21], and
sequential isolates of hepatitis A virus [22]. PAQ should
find increasing application to describe viral quasispecies
in view of its power to quantify relationships among
related sequences, and of the critical role of mutant spectra in virus behaviour.
Our laboratory has studied quasispecies dynamics and
evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a
widespread picornavirus pathogen that causes the economically most important animal viral disease (reviews in
[23,24]). The molecular epidemiology of FMDV has been
analyzed in detail by establishing an extensive database of
genomic nucleotide sequences, as well as by defining phylogenetic relationships among and within serotypes and
subtypes of the virus [25-27]. FMDV has been used as a
model system to investigate lethal mutagenesis, a term
coined to describe virus extinction through an increase of
viral mutation rate during replication ([28]; reviews in
[29-31]). Studies on the interference that mutated FMDV
and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) populations exert on the infectivity of the corresponding standard genomes [32-35] led to the proposal of the lethal
defection model of virus extinction [34]. According to this
model, extinction can occur with a modest average
number of mutations per genome that generates a class of
genomes termed defectors, that can replicate but interfere
with replication of the standard genomes [34,36]. Defector genomes differ from defective-interfering (DI) particles described for many viruses [37] in that DI particles are
dependent on helper virus for replication while defectors
are replication-competent [34,35].
In the course of the studies on lethal mutagenesis of
FMDV, biological clones of the virus were subjected to
serial cytolytic passages in cell culture in the absence or
presence of the mutagenic bases or nucleoside analogues

5-fluorouracil (FU), ribavirin (1-β-D ribofuranosyl-1, 2,
3- triazole- 3 carboxamide) (R), or 5-azacytidine (AZC)
[32,38-41]. These treatments have provided a number of
viral populations differing in their mutant spectrum complexity, as measured by the average mutation frequency
and Shannon entropy within mutant spectra [38-42].
However, possible alterations of phylogenetic relationships among components of the mutant spectra of mutagenized quasispecies have not been studied. To
characterize possible changes among components of
FMDV mutant spectra as a result of the mutagenic treatments, here we compare phylogenetic and PAQ analyses
of several multiply-passaged FMDV populations, and
their mutagenized counterparts. The results show that
phylogenetic and clustering methods can provide a quantification of the mutagenic activity exerted on viral populations by reflecting changes in genetic distances among
components of the mutant spectra of the viral quasispecies. PAQ analysis describes mutant distributions as
spheres with size which is proportional to the genetic
diversity, which varies as a result of enhanced mutagenesis. This type of representation has revealed that viral populations can respond rapidly to environmental changes,
with striking switches between relaxation and compactness of the population diversity, that were not apparent
from the comparison of mutation frequencies or Shannon
entropies. Evidence is presented that identical or closely
related consensus sequences may hide different subpopulations of genomes bearing distinct relationships among
them.

Methods
Cells, viruses, and infections
The origin of BHK-21 cells, and procedures for cell
growth, and infection of cell monolayers with foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV) have been previously
described [39-41,43,44]. The following FMDV clonal
populations have been used in the studies on lethal mutagenesis: i) FMDV C-S8c1, a plaque-purified derivative of
the natural isolate C1 Santa-Pau Spain 70 [44], a representative of European serotype C FMDV [23], GenBank accession number NC_002554; ii) C-S8c1 multiply passaged at
high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in BHK-21 cells; the
viral populations derived from each passage are indicated
with a "p" before the passage number (i.e. C-S8p50 means
C-S8c1 passaged 50 times in BHK-21 cells). iii) FMDV
MARLS, a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-escape mutant,
selected from population C-S8c1p213 [45], GeneBank
accession number AF274010. iv) C-S8c1p260p3d, the
viral population resulting from three diluted serial infections (mo.i. = 0.1) of C-S8c1p260 in BHK-21 cells [46];
gene bank accession number DQ409185; v) C10280, a
clone derived from subjecting C-S8c1 to 280 plaque-toplaque transfers in BHK-21 cells [47,48].

Extraction of RNA, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification
and nucleotide sequencing
Procedures for extraction of RNA from the supernatants of
infected cell cultures, reverse transcription (RT) of FMDV
RNA and PCR amplification with high fidelity Pfu DNA
polymerase
have
been
previously
described
[32,39,40,48]. Molecular cloning in plasmids pET28a3Dpol or pMT-28, as well as controls to ensure that
molecular clones reflect accurately the composition of the
quasispecies under analysis, were described in the primary
publications that produced the genomic sequences analyzed here [46,49-52]. Nucleotide sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Abi Prism; Applied Biosystems) and the automated
sequencer ABI 373 and ABI 3730; all sequences were
determined at least in duplicate, from independent
sequencing reactions.
Mutagenic agents and treatments
The procedures used for the mutagenic treatment have
been described in detail in the primary references
[30,33,38-40]. Here we provide a summary.
Treatment with ribavirin
A 100 mM solution of R (kindly provided by JC de la
Torre) was prepared in PBS, sterilized by filtration, and
stored at -20°C. Prior to use, the stock solution was
diluted in DMEM (Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's
medium) to reach the desired working concentrations
(generally 200 μM to 5000 μM). Cell monolayers were
preincubated with R for 7 h prior to infection. Infections
in the absence of R, and mock-infected cells were maintained in parallel. FMDV MARLS was serially passaged in
the presence and absence of increasing concentrations
(200 μM to 800 μM) of R (Figure. 1). For each passage, 4
× 106 BHK-21 cells were infected with 1–4 × 106 PFU of
virus from the previous passage until cytopathology was
complete (about 30 h in the presence of R, and 16 h in the
absence of R) [40,53].
Treatment with fluorouracil, azacytidine and guanidine hydrochloride
5-fluorouracil (FU) and azacytidine (AZC) were used as
mutagenic base analogues (Figure 1), while guanidine
hydrochloride (G) was used as inhibitor of FMDV replication, as previously described [38,39,41]. FU medium contained 200 μg/ml FU, and FUG medium contained 200
μg/ml FU and 4 mM G. Solutions were sterilized by filtration and stored at 4°C for a maximum of 15 days before
use. Infections in the presence of FUG were performed as
previously described [38,39,41].

The sources of all reagents for molecular studies are given
in the corresponding references that describe the nucleotide sequences used in the present analyses
[32,33,39,40].

arrows indicate high m.o.i. passages (1 to 5 PFU/cell). Drug concentrations during the infections are indicated on the corresponding arrows. A) The initial biological clone C-S8c1 [44] was subjected to three parallel series of cytolytic infections, either
in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (FU) or 5-azacytidine (AZC) or with no drug. B) C-S8c1 was subjected to 213 passages, and
then MARLS clone was isolated as a mAb SD6 resistant mutant [45] (thin arrow). RA populations originated from serial cytolytic infections of MARLS in the presence of the indicated concentrations of ribavirin (R). The concentration of R was increased
from 200 μM to 800 μM in the first 30 passages and from 800 μM to 5000 μM between passages 45 and 60. A bifurcation was
established at passage 30 and the populations were subjected to 5 additional passages in the absence of R to yield the population RA0p35. CAp35 is the population obtained after 35 parallel passages of MARLS in the absence of drug.

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments of consensus sequences and molecular clones were carried out with the program CLUSTAL W
[54], inserted into Bioedit package [55], using FMDV CS8c1 and/or FMDV MARLS (GenBank accession numbers
AJ133357 and AF274010, respectively) as the reference
sequences. Pairwise distances matrix was generated by the
program MEGA3.1 [56], using the Kimura-2 parameter
model [57]. Tree topology was inferred by three phylogenetic methods: (i) Neighbor-Joining (NJ) [15] using also
the MEGA3.1 package [56]; bootstrap re-sampling (1000
data sets) of the multiple alignments was used to test the
statistical robustness of the trees obtained by NJ [58]. (ii)
Maximum Parsimony (MP) (using the program DNAPARS from PHYLIP v3.5 package) [59]. (iii) Maximum

Likelihood (ML) trees were generated by the program
PUZZLE [16] using the Tamura-Nei substitution model
[60], and the Gamma distributed rates with eight parameters (TN-8Γ) as heterogeneity model (see additional file
1). Additionally, for the additional file 2, a ML analysis of
mutagenized populations of FMDV was performed by
means of the program Modelgenerator [61], useful to
identify the optimal evolutionary model (Akaike Information Criteria and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test indicated that the GTR model best fit the sequence data).
Using this model, ML trees were constructed using software from the PhyML program [62], available at [63]. As
a measure of the robustness of each node, we used an
approximate Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT), which assesses
that the branch being studied provides a significant likeli-

hood gain, in comparison with the null hypothesis that
involves collapsing the branch under study but leaving the
rest of the tree topology unaffected [64].
Characterization of mutant spectra
The complexity of mutant spectra was quantified by minimum and maximum mutation frequencies. Minimum
mutation frequency is the number of different mutations
present in the molecular clones divided by the total
number of nucleotides sequenced, and maximum mutation frequency is expressed as the total number of mutations present in the molecular clones divided by the total
number of nucleotides sequenced. The normalized Shannon entropy (H), which is a measure of the proportion of
identical sequences in a distribution [65], was also calculated. It is given by the formula:

H = −[Σ iN (p i ⋅ ln p i )] / ln N

(1)

in which pi is the proportion of each sequence of the
mutant spectrum, and N is the total number of sequences
compared.
For the Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ) [18], the
clones of each viral population were grouped together
under the minimum possible radius, considering no partition. Within each cluster, the average distance (AD)
value, with respect to the central sequence reported by
PAQ, was calculated as a measure of the intrapopulation
diversity, given by the formula:

AD = average distance = (1 / n)Σ in=1(D ic )

(2)

in which n is the number of neighbors within the group
with centre variant c, and Dic is the genetic distance (Hamming) between variants i and c. The populations are represented as spheres with the diameter proportional to the
AD value. Standard errors have also been calculated (see
additional file 3: Standard errors).
The nonsynonymous mutations corrected per nonsynonymous site (dn) and the synonymous mutations corrected
per synonymous site (ds) were calculated using SNAP
[66,67]. Kn and Ks are the ratio of nonsynonymous and
synonymous mutations respectively, per nucleotide
(without any correction). The sliding-window software KEstimator [68] was used to infer the Ks and Kn in the
FMDV genome using 200 nucleotide windows and a shift
of 100 nucleotides per step, to cover all the polyproteincoding region. The software calculates the confidence
interval using Monte Carlo simulations.
Software for phylogenetic and sequence analyses were
retrieved from the corresponding references listed in the
different sections of Methods.

Statistical analysis
One Way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc tests for non equal n,
and standard errors were calculated using Statistica 6.0
software package (StatSoft 2001).

Results
Phylogenetic evaluation of the mutagenesis-induced
diversification of viral populations
The present study was aimed at analyzing retrospectively
sets of consensus and clonal nucleotide sequences determined in our laboratory from FMDV populations subjected to serial cytolytic infections in BHK-21 cells, in the
absence or presence of the mutagenic nucleotide analogues FU, R or AZC [32,33,39,40] – (Figure 1).

A representation of the quasispecies was obtained by
determining the nucleotide sequences of 5 to 21 cDNA
clones from each population, and scoring mutation types,
mutation frequencies, and Shannon entropies. The FMDV
genomic region analyzed was the 3D (polymerase)-coding region (Table 1). Phylogenetic trees were derived from
the nucleotide clonal and consensus sequences from each
population. Sequences from some reference viruses were
also introduced as outgroups to establish minimal and
previously known relationships, as well as to define a general structure of the tree. The distance-based NJ method
[15], under Kimura two parameter model [57], was initially used for phylogenetic reconstructions, as described
in Methods. In some cases the populations were analyzed
using ML and MP algorithms [69] (see additional files 1
and 2). The general topology of these trees was consistent
with that derived from the NJ analysis: the major clades
and the relationships among clonal and consensus
sequences were maintained.
Comparison of the phylogenetic trees derived from nucleotide sequences of the different FMDV clonal populations
passaged 1 and 25 times in the absence or the presence of
AZC or FU shows an expansion of genetic distances
among components of the mutant spectrum of the
mutated populations compared to the respective control
populations passaged in the absence of drug. The presence
of FU led to a higher expansion of the genetic distances
than the presence of AZC (Figure 2). This expansion was
not observed at passage 1 either with or without AZC or
FU. Tree branches radiate from the corresponding consensus sequence with no discernible subclusters within each
population.
A more complex pattern of intrapopulation genetic distances was observed with FMDV passaged in the presence
of R (Figure 3). These populations originated from the
high fitness FMDV clone MARLS [45]. The overall topology of the populations subjected to continuous mutagenic treatment (RAp35, RAp45 and RAp60; passage

history depicted in Figure 1) shows the absence of significant subclusters. In turn, in all cases, a set of clones centrifugally diverge from the consensus sequence located at
the basis of the group. As the number of passages in the
presence of R increases, the genetic distance between the
consensus sequence of each population and its parental
MARLS clone increases substantially (about 11-fold from
passage 35 to passage 60; Figure 3A).
Interestingly, the population that underwent 30 passages
in the presence of R and then 5 passages in the absence of
R, showed a more compact topology, and subclusters of
clones were distinguished (RA0p35* in Figure 3B). It
must be noted that, due to the close relatedness among
the nucleotide sequences analyzed (see Background and
Methods), the bootstrap values associated with the
derived NJ trees suggest limited robustness of the derived
clusterings. Nevertheless, the same general topological
features are also observed when MP and ML were used
(see additional file 1: neighbour-joining, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analysis of populations
RAp35 and RA0p35) (see also statistical evaluation of
PAQ, below).
The control population CAp35, obtained after 35 serial
cytolytic infections of clone MARLS in cell culture in the
absence of mutagen, shows a characteristic tree with evident lower diversity than the populations treated with
mutagen (Figure 3), as documented by the very low mutation frequency value (12-fold smaller than population

of the FMDV genome.

RAp35, see Table 1), and the average shortness of all the
branches.
Partition analysis of quasispecies (PAQ) applied to the
clonal analysis of mutagenized FMDV populations
To further characterize the clonal structure of mutagenized FMDV populations, PAQ was applied to the same
FMDV populations (Figure 1) studied by phylogeny. The
sequences determined from the set of molecular clones
derived from each viral population were treated as separate populations. A radius that grouped all sequences was
chosen, and then the AD value was calculated (see Methods), as a measure of intrapopulation diversity (Figure 4).
We considered the absence of intrapopulation partition as
a priori realistic assumption because each viral population
derives from a well defined ancestor and evolution took
place under controlled conditions, supported also by phylogenetic data (Figure 3A).

PAQ analysis of the populations derived from clone CS8c1 subjected to 25 passages either in the presence of FU
or AZC or in the absence of mutagen, showed a 1.5-fold
expansion of intrapopulation diversity as a result of virus
propagation in the absence of mutagen, and 13.50-fold
and 9.24-fold expansions as a result of passages in the
presence of FU or AZC, respectively (Figure 4A). These values illustrate again the higher mutagenic potential of FU
than AZC (Tukey post hoc test, p = 0.004) on FMDV replicating in BHK-21 cells [39].

tion diversity in RA0p35 was 2.15-fold smaller than
RAp35 (Tukey post hoc test, p < 0.001) (see Discussion).

The 3D of RAp35 and its derived populations harbours
the substitution M296I which decreases its sensitivity to R
[40]. Further passages in the presence of 800 μM R led to
a reduction of diversity of population RAp45 (1.90-fold
reduction in AD value, Tukey post hoc test, p < 0.001;
Table 1). Once the diversity decreased in RAp45, it did not
further increase significantly after 15 additional passages
under higher (up to 5000 μM) concentrations of R
(RAp60) (1.10 fold, Tukey post hoc test, p = 0.9).

The modification of the relationship among components
of the mutant spectrum is not reflected in Shannon
entropy (which is saturated in the highest value, 1, for all
the populations from the RA lineage tested) (see Table 1).
Also maximum mutation frequency varies within a narrow range of 1.7-fold to 2.4-fold when the different populations are compared with RAp35 (table 1). There are no
statistically significant differences in the minimum/maximum mutation frequency of population RAp35 and
RA0p35 (one-way ANOVA: F = 2.57, df = 1.33, p = 0.118).
This ratio is larger (higher diversity) in populations
RAp45 and RAp60, than in population RAp35 (Tukey

AD values derived from PAQ are a more sensitive and realistic descriptor of intrapopulation diversity than mutation
frequencies.

[42]. The mutational bias associated with AZC was mainly
due to transversions G → C, C → G.
The NJ tree derived from consensus nucleotide sequences
of the entire FMDV genome of R treated populations disclosed an unusually rapid fixation of mutations in the
consensus sequence of RAp45 (Figure 6A). In the course
of serial cytolytic passages of C-S8c1, mutations accumulated at a rate of approximately 0.20 mutations per passage [48], with MARLS displaying a similar rate of 0.24

mutations per passage. In contrast, RA deviated to 1.13
mutations per passage, suggesting a very fast evolution
associated with the presence of R (Figure 6B).
Evidence of purifying selection during enhanced
mutagenesis
We have examined whether the highly mutated RA
genomes resulted from random fixation of mutations
along the genome, or from their preferential accumulation at specific genomic sites. Using the sliding-windowbased software K-estimator [68] (described in Methods)
we measured the distribution of mutations (Ka, Ks, nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations per nucleotide,
respectively) along the open-reading frame (polyproteincoding region) of MARLS, RAp35 and RAp45 populations. At certain genome regions, Ka and Ks for RAp35 and
RAp45 displayed values that were statistically significantly
higher than the average (Figure 7). The asymmetric distribution of mutations suggests that despite the high mutational pressure imposed by R treatment, some kind of
selection is still acting during the -passaging of the virus
with error-prone replication.

To distinguish whether the asymmetric distribution of
mutations along the genome was mainly due to positive
or negative (or purifying) selection, the dn/ds ratios were
calculated (see Methods and Table 2). -RA populations
included 6- to 14- fold excess of synonymous mutations,
both in the analysis of the mutant spectrum and the consensus sequence. In contrast, the dn/ds ratio of the consensus sequence of C-S8c1 at passage 263 (C-S8p260p3d)
was 0.62, that is, 6-to 8-fold higher than the value for -RA
populations. Also, a set of MARLS-derived clones scored a
dn/ds ratio of 1.21, 7- to 17-fold higher value than
obtained in the clonal analysis of -RA populations (Table
2). These data, together with the non-random accumulation of mutations along the viral genome (Figure 7),
strongly suggest that purifying selection operates on

FMDV in the course of replication under enhanced mutagenesis.
Virus extinction without a large excess of mutations
To investigate whether FMDV extinction by enhanced
mutagenesis was associated with unusual intrapopulation
divergence [29,30,70,71], a PAQ analysis was performed
on populations FMDV C-S8p3, C-S8p3-FUG and RAp35
[72] (Figure 8A). Preextinction population C-S8p3-FUG
manifested a very modest increase in mutant spectrum
complexity relative to the control population C-S8p3 (Figure 8C). Furthermore, the complexity of C-S8p3-FUG was
much lower than the complexity of RAp35 (AD value
comparison: T student, t = 12.19, p < 0.001), included in
the phylogenetic and PAQ analyses (Figure 8B and 8C).
Therefore, viral extinction can be achieved without any
salient increase of the average genetic distances among
components of the quasispecies (see Discussion).

Discussion
Several remarkable modifications in the mutant spectrum occur when viral populations replicate in the presence of mutagenic agents such as base or nucleoside
analogues. The initial experiments by J.J. Holland and
colleagues documented very modest (1.1- to 2.8-fold)
increases of mutation frequency at single base sites of
poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus, associated with
severe decrease of infectivity, as a consequence of
enhanced mutagenesis by a variety of mutagenic agents
[73]. Subsequent work showed that replication of different viruses in the presence of mutagenic base or nucleoside analogues could lead to virus extinction
accompanied of very modest (from barely measurable up
to 6.4-fold) increases of mutation frequency and mutant
spectrum complexity ([28,39,74]; reviews in [29,30,71]).
In our previous studies with FMDV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus we have observed that in the course of
the transition of the viruses towards extinction: i) there is
a 102- to 103-fold decrease in specific infectivity (number

of infectious units divided by the total amount of viral
RNA); ii) low viral loads and low replication capacity (fitness) favour extinction; and iii) internal, interfering interactions among mutagenized components of the mutant
spectra play an important role in the extinction [3236,38,39,75].
The critical participation of the mutant spectrum in viral
extinction led to the proposal of "lethal defection" as a
model of virus extinction by lethal mutagenesis [34,35],
and motivated the phylogenetic and partition analyses of
mutant spectra reported in the present study. The results
support our previous conclusions on the general increase
of mutant spectrum complexity -here documented by
average genetic distances in phylogenetic trees and quantified by the AD parameter in PAQ- as a result of the various mutagenic treatments. Moreover, new insights into
the events associated with enhanced mutagenesis have
been unveiled by the comparison of phylogenetic and
PAQ analyses. The NJ tree topology of a population
evolved under enhanced mutagenesis conditions consists
of a basal consensus sequence, with the individual components of the population radiating from it (the more
mutated the population the bigger the radiation of the
branches) and with no apparent population structure in
the form of subclusters. Trees constructed with FMDV
populations whose 3D (polymerase) included a substitution that decreased the sensitivity to R (RAp45 and
RAp60) [40] displayed a slight reduction of branch
length, but maintained the same general topology. This is
in sharp contrast with population RA0p35, which, after
only 5 passages in the absence of R, presents an internal
structure completely rearranged, as shown by the NJ tree,
and confirmed with ML and MP methods (Figure 3B, and
additional file 1: neighbour-joining, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analysis of populations
RAp35 and RA0p35).
The average distance parameter AD of PAQ reflects the
fine detail of the intra population structure of diversity
better than the other estimators traditionally used, such
as mutation frequencies or Shannon entropy. Mutation
frequency does not capture the distribution of mutations
among the individual components of a mutant spectrum,
and the Shannon entropy reaches the maximum possible
value of 1 when all the sequences under study are different, independently of the mutational load. This lack of
resolution is circumvented by PAQ due to the pairwise
comparison of all the clones with respect to the central
sequence. In this sense, any subtle variation in the spatial
distribution of mutation frequency may be amplified
yielding a more sensitive, accurate and non-saturating
description of the internal structure of the population.
The present analysis has documented striking expansions
of the average intrapopulation genetic distance associ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/207

ated with mutagenic treatments (Figure 4). Interestingly
the analysis of the RA lineage revealed that, after an initial
expansion of intrapopulation diversity, a remarkably fast
contraction of the average distance occurred in two situations. First, a 2.15-fold reduction in AD value was
observed when the drug treatment was discontinued for
only 5 passages. Second, populations with FMDV including in its 3D (polymerase) replacement M296I -that
decreases the sensitivity to R [40] – displayed a 1.90-fold
reduction in AD value (RAp45 and RAp60 populations,
Figure 4). The ratio of minimum over maximum mutation frequency yielded higher values (indicative of higher
diversity), in populations RAp45 and RAp60 than in population RAp35 which is the most diverse. Therefore mutation frequencies (both maximum, minimum or their
ratio) and Shannon entropy, are less definitory than PAQ
(when analyzing AD) to characterize the internal genetic
diversity of mutagenized viral populations.
A possible interpretation of intrapopulation contractions
is that in the course of the mutagenic treatment subsets of
genomes with better than average replication efficiency
are produced. However, their potential replicative advantage can not be expressed due to the continuous mutational input due to the presence of R. When R pressure is
removed, specific subsets of genomes showing higher
than average replication capacity, replenish the population. A similar, albeit less pronounced, contraction
would occur as a consequence of the dominance of viral
mutants with decreased sensitivity to R.
The MARLS-derived populations that replicated in the
presence of R (the RA lineage, Figure 1B), showed unexpected high resistance to extinction at passage 35 and
subsequent passages, associated with a mutation that
decreased the sensitivity to R [40]. Despite such mutation, the number of total mutations fixed in the consensus sequence of population RAp35 was very high (1.13
mutations/passage, Figure 6) when compared with its
ancestor (0.2 mutation/passage). Also the molecular
clones derived from RAp35 presented a 12-fold increase
in mutation frequency with respect to the control population, CAp35 (Table 1). The specific pattern of mutations of FU-treated, AZC-treated and R-treated
populations (Figure 5), and the increase in mutant frequency with respect control populations (Table 1) suggest that the increase in mutation frequencies was
effectively produced by the action of mutagens, in agreement with the mutational bias induced in the course of
polymerization assays in the presence of R-triphosphate
or FU-triphosphate using purified FMDV 3D (polymerase) ([40], Agudo et al submitted for publication).
Despite the high error frequencies induced by mutagen,
mutations did not accumulate at random along the viral

Page 15 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:207

genome, but rather they accumulated at preferred
genomic regions (Figure 7). The non-random accumulation of mutations and the excess of corrected synonymous mutations (Table 1) are consistent with purifying
selection operating in the evolution of mutagenized populations. Viruses harbouring less deleterious mutations
might have a selective advantage in a landscape of highly
damaged viruses. In this view, the quasispecies would
display a mutagenesis buffering activity, accepting those
mutations that affect the more permissive regions of the
viral genome. This dynamics is strikingly parallel to that
observed in the course of bottleneck transfers carried out
with the same FMDV clones C-S8c1 ([47,48,76-78]
reviewed in [79]). In bottleneck transfers individual
clones are selected for replication. In this situation Müller
ratchet effect operates on the clones [80]. In clones that
resisted extinction, mutations accumulated preferentially
at some genomic regions and, again, an excess of synonymous mutations was found [48,77].
The present study supports the "lethal defection" model
of viral extinction in that a limited number of mutations
per genome can be sufficient to drive a virus to extinction
[28,34,74]. Again, the comparison with FMDV clones
subjected up to 409 bottleneck transfers is highly significant. In such clones extinction was not achieved despite
the genomes reaching average mutation frequencies
which are 5- to 37-fold higher than those associated with
viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis [32,39,41,48]. It
has been proposed that in successive bottleneck transfers,
the kinetics of mutation accumulation allows the fixation
of compensatory beneficial mutations that counteract the
Müller Ratchet effect [76-79].
Several theoretical models of lethal mutagenesis of
viruses have been proposed, either as a direct consequence of quasispecies dynamics and its corollary concept of error catastrophe, or independently of error
catastrophe [70,81-84]. All models converge in that lethal
mutagenesis is a feasible strategy to achieve virus extinction by mutagenic nucleotide analogues. What the models did not take into consideration is the key influence on
extinction of internal interactions exerted among components of the mutant spectra. Lethal and interfering mutations impede a substantial "evaporation" (or "diffusion")
of genomic sequences in sequence space [84], as it could
not be otherwise, considering that we are dealing with
loss of multiple biological functions compactly integrated in a viral genome [70]. The phylogenetic and PAQ
approaches used here should be extremely helpful to
monitor in a quantitative fashion the evolution of mutagenized viral populations both in cell culture and in vivo,
as they increase their mutational load and either succumb or escape extinction.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have unveiled changes in
the internal population structure of FMDV viral quasispecies subjected to mutagenesis by base and nucleoside analogues. Expansions and compressions of mutant spectra
have been quantitated by comparing average genetic distances among components of mutant spectra. Comparisons of the types and distribution of mutations along the
viral genomes have shown that negative (or purifying
selection) acts in the course of enhanced mutagenesis.
Virus extinction can be achieved with modest increases of
population complexity. The average distance parameter
(AD) reflects the intrapopulation structure better than the
other estimators traditionally used, such as mutation frequencies or Shannon entropy.
