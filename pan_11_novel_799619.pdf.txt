Abstract
Background: Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) preferentially induces myeloid leukosis (ML) in meat-type
birds. Since 2008, many clinical cases of hemangioma rather than ML have frequently been reported in association
with ALV-J infection in Chinese layer flocks.
Results: Three ALV-J strains associated with hemangioma were isolated and their proviral genomic sequences
were determined. The three isolates, JL093-1, SD09DP03 and HLJ09MDJ-1, were 7,670, 7,670, and 7,633 nt in length.
Their gag and pol genes were well conserved, with identities of 94.5-98.6% and 97.1-99.5%, respectively, with other
ALV-J strains at the amino acid level (aa), while the env genes of the three isolates shared a higher aa identity with
the env genes of other hemangioma strains than with those of ML strains. Interestingly, two novel 19-bp insertions
in the U3 region in the LTR and 5’ UTR, most likely derived from other retroviruses, were found in all the three
isolates, thereby separately introducing one E2BP binding site in the U3 region in the LTR and RNA polymerase II
transcription factor IIB and core promoter motif ten elements in the 5’ UTR. Meanwhile, two binding sites in the U3
LTRs of the three isolates for NFAP-1 and AIB REP1 were lost, and a 1-base deletion in the E element of the 3’ UTR
of JL093-1 and SD09DP03 introduced a binding site for c-Ets-1. In addition to the changes listed above, the rTM of
the 3’ UTR was deleted in each of the three isolates.
Conclusion: Our study is the first to discovery the coexistence of two novel insertions in the U3 region in the LTR
and the 5’ UTR of ALV-J associated with hemangioma symptoms, and the transcriptional regulatory elements
introduced should be taken into consideration in the occurrence of hemangioma.

Background
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), the most
recently discovered avian exogenous retrovirus, is
thought to have emerged via a recombination event
between an unknown exogenous ALV and an endogenous retrovirus [1-3]. Since the first report of the prototype ALV-J strain HPRS-103 in 1989 in the United
Kingdom [1,4,5], the virus has been found worldwide,
predominantly in meat-type chickens [5]. In China,

ALV-J infection of broilers was first detected and officially recognized in 1999 [6], followed by scattered
reports of infection of broiler and local chickens in
some areas of China [7-9]. Although egg-type chickens
have been experimentally infected with ALV-J to induce
tumors [10], no field cases of ALV-J infection and
tumors in commercial layer chickens were found in
China until 2004 [11]. Curiously, ALV-J infection in
Chinese layer flocks has become widespread since 2008.
Cases of ALV-J, infection and tumors in commercial
layer chickens have been emerging in China in recent
years, causing severe production problems in layer flocks
[12-15].

Clinical infection with ALV-J is associated with the
development of various tumors such as myelocytomas
(ML), erythroblastosis (EB), hemangiomas, nephromas,
and sarcomas [16,17]. ML is the most commonly
reported neoplastic syndrome associated with ALV-J in
broiler chickens [17]. However, the dominant tumor
induced by ALV-J infection in Chinese layer chickens is
hemangioma. Large numbers of clinical hemangioma
cases in egg-type chickens have been reported in China
[7,12-15]. Hemangiomas are vascular tumors characterized by the abnormal growth of endothelial cells from
capillary blood vessels [18]. This type of tumor may be
induced in chickens by an avian leukosis retrovirus
(ALV) variant that contains the erb-B oncogene [19]. It
seems that the ALV-Js common in the field induce a
greater spectrum of tumors because ML has also
occurred in some hemangioma cases [7,14]. Whether
the change in the tumor spectrum of ALV-J in chickens
is related to the sequence variation of this virus or the
species of the host is still unknown.
To better understand the molecular characteristics of
ALV-J, three hemangioma isolates, JL093-1, SD09DP03
and HLJ09MDJ-1, isolated from three separate provinces
in China, were first confirmed to be associated with
ALV-J. Then, the whole genomic sequences of the three
isolates were determined and compared with the published sequences of ALV-J strains, including hemangioma and ML strains. Interestingly, two novel 19-bp
insertions in the U3 LTR and the 5’ UTR, most likely
derived from other retroviruses, were found in all the
three isolates. These insertions introduced one E2BP
binding site in the U3 LTR and RNA polymerase II
transcription factor IIB and core promoter motif ten elements in the 5’ UTR. Meanwhile, the binding sites for
NFAP-1 and AIB REP1 in the U3 LTR of the three isolates were lost, and a 1-base deletion in the E element
of the 3’ UTR of JL093-1 and SD09DP03 introduced a
binding site for c-Ets-1. These transcriptional regulatory
elements, known as factors associated with vascular
tumors [20-23], were speculated to be related to the
development of hemangioma. Herein, we report for the
first time the coexistence of two 19 bp insertions in a
hemangioma ALV-J.

several times their normal size. Morbidity in some flocks
reached 60%, and the mortality rate was over 20%, causing heavy economic losses. To confirm and analyze the
pathogenesis of this disease, livers, spleens, and tumors
were collected from sick chickens in the three provinces.
Virus isolation

The diseased tissues or tumors were inoculated onto the
DF-1 cells, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for five
days for each passage [24]. Uninfected DF-1 cells were
used as negative control. After one blind passage, the
existence of ALV-J in DF-1 cells was verified by PCR
detection of 545 bp repeated sequence [25]. Three blind
passage were conducted until the result of PCR detection of cellular genome and RT-PCR detection of supernatant were both positive.
Primers

Four primers pairs were designed to amplify in the
whole genomic sequences of ALV-J isolates (Table 1).
Primer pairs W1, W2, and W3 were used to amplify the
sequence from position 1 - 7841 of the prototype ALV-J
strain HPRS-103, and primer pair W4 was used to
amplify the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences from
circularized ALV-J viral DNA.
Genomic DNA extract and PCR amplification

The total DNA was extracted from DF-1 cells infected
with virus by using a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) proteinase K and phenol/chloroform/isoamylol (25:24:1)
protocol. Genomic DNA PCR amplification was performed according to the manual of rTaq kit (Takara,
Dalian, China), by using the proviral genomic DNA as
template. The optimum conditions for PCR were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min 40 s, and a final elongation at
72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed in 1%

Methods
Clinical samples

In late 2009, suspected cases of ALV-J infection erupted
in layer flocks in three main chicken-industry provinces
(Jilin, Shandong, Heilongjiang) of China. The levels of
egg production were dramatically reduced in the
affected flocks. Clinical symptoms included hemorrhages
in the skin of the phalanges and feather follicles. Some
layer hens had gray-white nodules in the liver, spleen or
kidneys, and the liver and spleen were enlarged up to

Cloning and sequencing of proviral genomic DNA

All PCR productions were then cloned into the TA vector PMD18-T (TAKARA, Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Dalian, China), and they were sequenced with an AB
3730 DNA sequencer by commercial services in China.
Due to the possibility of genetic variation, at least three
independent plasmids were sequenced for confirmation.

accession numbers are listed in Table 2. Multiple
sequence alignment was carried out using the sequence
analysis software Lasergene 1 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI) and Clustal X 1.83 [26]. An unrooted phylogenetic
tree was generated by the distance-based neighbor-joining method using MEGA 4.1 [27]. Bootstrap values were
calculated using 500 or 1000 replicates of the alignment.
Transcriptional regulatory elements in the U3 were analyzed by NSITE (Recognition of Regulatory motifs), an
online service of Soft Berry (http://linux1.softberry.com/

Sequence analysis

To analyze the sequences of hemangioma ALV-J isolates, the sequences of reference ALV-J strains, including the sequences of all published ML and other
hemangioma ALV-Js, were obtained from GenBank. The

The whole genome sequences of the three isolates
were aligned with DNASTAR (version 5.01), and the
sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers as follows: HLJ09MDJ-1 (JN624878),
SD09DP03 (JN624880), and JL093-1 (JN624879). The
full-length proviral genome sequences of JL093-1,
SD09DP03 and HLJ09MDJ-1 were 7670, 7670 and
7633 nt in length, respectively. To better characterize
ALV-Js associated with hemangioma on a molecular
level, we compared the whole sequences of the three
isolates with the sequences of four other hemangioma
strains and eight ML strains published in GenBank
(Table 2).

The homology analysis of gag, pol and env genes of the
three isolates

Comparisons of the three major genes revealed that the
homology of nucleotide sequence of pol and gag genes
between the three isolates and other isolates in GenBank
were 94.5-98.6%, 97.1-99.5% at the amino acid (aa) level,
respectively. These data suggested that the pol and gag
genes of all ALV-Js were highly conserved.
However, hemangioma and ML ALV-Js seem to have
different env genes. env genes of the three isolates and
other hemangioma isolates was 88.5-91.7% identical to
that of ML strains at the aa level, but a much higher
identity (92.7-99.6%) was found with all hemangioma
strains (except for HLJ09MDJ-1 and NHH), which may
be indicative of the close relationship among hemangioma isolates. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that
hemangioma isolates belonged to the same branch and
that the reference ML strains clustered in the other
branch (Figure 1C).
Novel sequences in LTRs and 5’UTRs of the three isolates

A 19-bp insertion (5’ CTGTAGTCTTGCAACATGC 3’),
located between sites 19 and 20 according to the
sequence of the prototype ALV-J strain HPRS-103,
occurred in the U3 region in the LTR of the three isolates (Figure 2). This insertion is essentially also identical to sequences found in some other retroviruses,
including human hamster virus PR2257 and Rous sarcoma virus strain Schmidt-Ruppin A (RSV-SRA).
NSITE, an online service provided by Soft Berry, showed
that some transcriptional regulatory elements of the U3
region of the three isolates had changed (Figure 2). In

and env gene (Figure 1C). Isolates marked with a black triangle

contrast with ML strains, in the three isolates, the
NFAP-1 and AIB REP1 components were lost due to
the mutation and deletion of base pairs, which was also
observed in the hemangioma strain SCDY1 [12]. An
E2BP binding site was introduced by the 19 bp-insertion. Other components, including a C/EBP, two CArG
boxes, two Y boxes, and one TATA box, were still well
conserved. Homology analysis showed that the U3
region in the LTRs of the three isolates shared 91.895.3% homology with those of other retroviruses, but
only 81.7-87.1% similarity with ML ALV-Js. The U3
sequences of the three isolates clustered in a distinct
group apart from homologous sequences, while other
hemangioma strains such as SCDY1 and NHH belonged
to the same branch as ML strains in the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 1A).

(5’

in the 5’ UTRs of the three isolates; this insertion is also
present in the hemangioma strain JS09GY6 but is not present in any ML ALV-J strain published (Figure 3). Interestingly, the 19-bp insertion was predicted to introduce RNA
polymerase II transcription factor II B and core promoter
motif ten elements, which are also present in two hemangioma strains, SCAU-HN06 and JS09GY6 [13,14]. Homology analysis revealed that the 5’ UTRs of the three isolates
were closely associated with those of type 1 Rouse sarcoma
related virus (RAV-1), Rous sarcoma virus strain SchmidtRuppin A (RSV-SRB) and other retroviruses, sharing 97.5100% identity with each other. Phylogenetic analysis also
demonstrated that all hemangioma ALV-Js and other retroviruses belonged to the same branch and that, strikingly,
the published ML strains were present in the other branch
(Figure 1B).
The molecular features of the 3’ UTRs of the three
isolates

Three elements, the redundant transmembrane region
(rTM), the direct repeat 1 (DR 1) and the E element,

are located in the 3’ UTR. The molecular characterization of the 3’ UTR of the three isolates was as follows.
Deletion of most of the rTM Consistent with ML
strains, most of the rTMs of the three isolates were
deleted, as observed in other hemangioma strains such
as SCAU-HN06 and JS09GY6 [13,14] and the ML strain
ADOL-7501. The rTM was found only in earlier ML
strains such as HPRS-103 [1]. The deletion of the rTM
is common in current ALV-J isolates, suggesting that
this region might be dispensable for viral fitness [13,14].
Complete conservation of DR 1 As a single or double copy element flanking the src in some oncogenic
sarcoma viruses, DR 1 had been found exclusively in
sarcoma viruses and ALV-J in the past [1]. To our
knowledge, DR 1 is present in the 3’ UTR of all ALV-J
isolates, without any exception. DR 1 may contribute to
the fitness of the viruses that contain them because the
element is associated with the efficient accumulation of
unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm and the selective
increase in the amount of spliced src mRNA in ALV.
A binding site for c-Ets-1 was introduced in the E
element Most base pairs of the E element were conserved in the three hemangioma isolates, but minor
mutations were observed (Figure 4). For example, the E

elements of JL093-1 and SD09DP03 had a 1-base deletion (between 7387 and 7389 according to the HPRS103 sequence); this deletion was also present in
JS09GY6, JS09GY3, JS09GY5 and SCAU-HN06 [13,14].

The deletion introduced a specific distinct binding site
for c-Ets-1 according motif analysis; this binding protein
is associated with vascular endothelial cell differentiation. In contrast, most parts of the E element of ML

strains whose sequences have been reported to date
have been deleted. For example, in the USA, the E element of ML strains have been reported to have substantial deletions in >50% of ALV-Js [28], and the E element
has been completely deleted in earlier Chinese ML isolates such as YZ9902 and NX0101 and the recent strain
JS-nt.

Discussion
In this study, the whole genomic sequences of three
ALV-J isolates associated with hemangioma from layers
were determined and compared with the published
sequences of ML and hemangioma ALV-J strains.
Although the three isolates were collected from different
sick layers in three separate provinces of China, they all
contained special sequences such as modifications of the
LTRs and 5’ UTRs that seem to be molecular markers
of some hemangioma strains.
Consistent with other ALV-J strains, gag and pol
genes of the three isolates were highly conserved. However, env genes of hemangioma strains seem to differentiate from ML strains, since the fact that all
hemangioma strains were clustered in the same branch
while ML strains belonged to the other branch in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1C). The env glycoprotein of
ALV, as in other retroviruses, functions mainly as a
ligand for receptor binding for virus entry into susceptible cells [29], and was also demonstrated to be a major
determinant of the lineage-specific oncogenicity and
host range [30-32]. Whether the tumor spectrum is
determined by the env genes of ALV-J or not needs
further study.
Hemangioma ALV-Js seem to contain special U3
region in the LTR and 5’ UTR sequences. Phylogenetic
analyses based on the U3 LTR and the 5’ UTR revealed
that all hemangioma isolates examined and some other
retroviruses belonged to the same branch, whereas the
published ML ALV-J sequences belonged to another
branch (Figure 1A, 1B), implying that these U3 LTR and
the 5’ UTR sequences of hemangioma ALV-Js were
most likely derived from some other retroviruses. To
our knowledge, the ALV-J strains reported to date have
been recognized as slowly transforming viruses, while
related retroviruses such as HBI and RSVs quickly
induce tumors in chickens and have altered biological
properties [33,34]. For example, HBI, which was derived
from the myc-containing virus MC29, was demonstrated
to be capable of inducing a variety of tumors when
injected into newborn chickens [33]. Hence, the acutelike sequences of those hemangioma strains may influence the tumor spectrum and pathogenicity of ALV-J in
layers. The three isolates in this study can replicate to a
high titer in DF-1 cells, a characteristic that is shared
with some other hemangioma viruses [29]. This new

biological property may have a close relationship with
the U3 of the 5’ LTR and the 5’ UTR contained in the
genome of ALV-Js.
It is noteworthy that there were two 19 bp insertions
in the U3 LTR and 5’ UTR in our three isolates that
have not been previously reported. The U3 LTR region
of the avian retroviruses has been extensively characterized as a model of a strong transcription regulatory unit.
This compact enhancer and promoter drives high levels
of viral and cellular gene transcription in many cell
types in birds and in mammals [35-37]. According to
our analysis, parts of the transcriptional regulatory elements in the U3 region of the three isolates have changed. The binding sites for NFAP-1 and AIB REP1 were
not observed in our three isolates but exist in all ML
ALV-Js. The NFAP-1 site is recognized by activator protein 1 (AP-1). AP-1 is a heterodimeric protein that regulates gene expression in response to stimuli such as
cytokines, growth factors, stress, and bacterial and viral
infections [20]. AIB REP1, known as repair of chromatin
damage 1, was recently reported to be a regulatory factor of human gene Apo-AI. Apo-AI is closely related to
the vascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma in
humans [21]. The absence of the NFAP-1 and AIB
REP1 binding sites may influence the infection abilities
of the ALV-J virus in chickens or the development of
hemangioma. Moreover, the insertion in the U3 introduced an E2BP binding site. E2BP was first found in
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and influences the liver specificity of HBV replication through the combination with
an enhancer, EII [22]. The additional DNA binding site
for E2BP introduced in the U3 may be related to viral
tropism [23]. The insertion or deletion of transcription
regulatory elements may severely impact the transcriptional activity of the LTR in hemangioma isolates,
thereby affecting the replication or infection capability
of this virus.
The 5’ UTR played an important role in viral replication through potential intra- and intermolecular interactions [38]. One RNA polymerase II transcription
factorIIB element and core promoter motif ten elements
were introduced via a 19-bp insertion in the 5’ UTR of
all three isolates; this insertion is also found in the
hemangioma strains SCAU-HN06 and JS09GY6 [13,14].
However, the influence of the inserted sequence in viral
replication is still unknown.
Elements in the 3’ UTR play a key role in virion
assembly and the ability to induce tumors [39]. Early
studies found that the rTM exists in the majority ALV-J
trains in China; however, deletion of the rTM has been
observed in a large number of ALV-J strains in recent
years [13,14,40]. The loss of the rTM seems to be a
trend in the sequence variation of the 3’ UTR in current
ALV-Js in China (unpublished data). Therefore, the

Pan et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:552
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/552

rTM is suspected to be related to the evolution and
virulence of this virus, and its role should not be
ignored. The E element, containing a biding site for the
transcription factor c/EBP and acting as an enhancer,
was previously only found in the gene of sarcoma
viruses [41]. Currently, the E element is present in many
ALV-J strains in addition to our isolates (unpublished
data). The existence of the E element in the 3’UTR does
increase the occurrence rate of tumors in chickens
infected with ALV-J, although this element is not the
decisive factor in the induction of tumors [42]. For the
hemangioma ALV-Js examined, a binding site for c-Ets1, introduced in JL093-1 and SD09DP03 due to a 1-bp
deletion, was associated with the development of
hemangiomas. Consistent with other reports, DR 1 of all
hemangioma ALV-Js was very well conserved. This high
level of conservation is consistent with the fact that DR
1 plays an important role in the assembly of the genomic RNA of ALV-Js [43].
In conclusion, our study is the first to discovery the
coexistence of two novel insertions in the U3 region in
the LTR and the 5’ UTR of ALV-J associated with
hemangioma symptoms, and the transcriptional regulatory elements introduced should be taken into consideration in the occurrence of hemangioma.
