Abstract
Background: Leaf-cutting ants live in symbiosis with a fungus that they rear for food by providing
it with live plant material. Until recently the fungus' main inferred function was to make otherwise
inaccessible cell wall degradation products available to the ants, but new studies have shed doubt
on this idea. To provide evidence for the cell wall degrading capacity of the attine ant symbiont, we
designed PCR primers from conserved regions of known xylanase genes, to be used in PCR with
genomic DNA from the symbiont as template. We also measured xylanase, cellulase and proteinase
activities in the fungus gardens in order to investigate the dynamics of degradation activities.
Results: We cloned a xylanase gene from the mutualistic fungus of Acromyrmex echinatior,
determined its protein sequence, and inserted it in a yeast expression vector to confirm its
substrate specificity. Our results show that the fungus has a functional xylanase gene. We also show
by lab experiments in vivo that the activity of fungal xylanase and cellulase is not evenly distributed,
but concentrated in the lower layer of fungus gardens, with only modest activity in the middle layer
where gongylidia are produced and intermediate activity in the newly established top layer. This
vertical distribution appears to be negatively correlated with the concentration of glucose, which
indicates a directly regulating role of glucose, as has been found in other fungi and has been
previously suggested for the ant fungal symbiont.
Conclusion: The mutualistic fungus of Acromyrmex echinatior has a functional xylanase gene and is
thus presumably able to at least partially degrade the cell walls of leaves. This finding supports a
saprotrophic origin of the fungal symbiont. The observed distribution of enzyme activity leads us
to propose that leaf-substrate degradation in fungus gardens is a multi-step process comparable to
normal biodegradation of organic matter in soil ecosystems, but with the crucial difference that a
single fungal symbiont realizes most of the steps that are normally provided by a series of
microorganisms that colonize fallen leaves in a distinct succession.

Background
Neo-tropical leaf-cutting ants of the genera Acromyrmex
and Atta live in symbiosis with the basidiomycete fungus
Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which they rear in underground gardens and provide with fresh leaf material. This
mutualistic interaction provides the ants with easily
digested food in the form of specialized nutrient-rich
hyphal tips, the gongylidia. It has been assumed that the
ants obtain major benefits from the enzymatic capacity of
the fungus to degrade polysaccharides from plant cell
walls [1-3], but this view has recently been challenged by
findings that L. gongylophorus grows only poorly on synthetic media containing cellulose [4,5]. Plant cell walls
consist mainly of polysaccharides in the form of cellulose
microfibrils, embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose and
pectin (fig. 1). Cell wall material accounts for 30–50 % of
leaf dry mass [6], so the ability of the mutualistic fungus
to utilize cell walls has a major influence on the amount
of foliage needed to sustain a leaf-cutting ant colony. Likewise, the extent of degradation of the leaf material harvested by the ants will determine the amount of fungal
waste that colonies have to process to avoid infectious diseases [7,8] and the extent to which these waste products
are the origin of a further decomposition food-chain. The
value of New World crops destroyed by leaf-cutting ants
each year is counted in billions of dollars [3], so that the
clarification of functional questions on the degradation of
cell wall material has both significant economical and
ecological relevance.

During evolution, the degradation of cell wall material
became a particularly acute resource problem for the fungus-growing ants when they started to solely use fresh
leaves as substrate for their fungus gardens. This happened in the common ancestor of the Atta and Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants and coincided with an entire
suite of other transitions towards large colony size, substantial worker caste differentiation and higher genetic
diversity via multiple queen mating [9]. Large colonies
with high turnover rates are more likely to be resourceconstrained and are more vulnerable to pathogen infections, in particular when they accumulate large amounts
of waste [10]. Any ability of the fungal symbiont to
degrade cell wall material would imply more efficient
resource acquisition and less waste, so that documenting
such abilities would contribute to our general understanding of the evolutionary and ecological success of the fungus-growing ants.
A major constituent of plant cell walls is hemicellulose.
Most of this is xylan, consisting of a backbone of xylose
molecules linked by 1,4-β-xylose residues, to which side
groups of 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronopyranosyl, α-L-arabinofuranosyl, acetyl, feruloyl, and p-coumaroyl can be
coupled [11]. Degradation of the xylan backbone is catalyzed by endo-1,4-β-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) that cleave the
backbone randomly into xylo-oligosides, and by β-Dxylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37) that split off xylose monomers
from the non-reducing end of xylo-oligosides (fig. 1).

Based on sequence similarity, the fungal endoxylanases
fall into three groups belonging to, respectively, the glycoside hydrolase families 5 (rarely), 10 and 11 [12,13]. Most
of the ca. 100 endoxylanases isolated so far originate from
Ascomycota: a search in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes
database [14,15] produced only six basidiomycete endoxylanase sequences in glycoside hydrolase family 10 and
four in glycoside hydrolase family 11 for which the substrate specificity has been verified.
The objective of the present study was to directly assess the
presence and functional activity of endoxylanases in the
ant-cultivated fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus by cloning an endoxylanase gene and confirming its substrate
specificity by heterologous expression in yeast cells. We
also directly assayed endoxylanase activity in live fungus
garden material of Acromyrmex echinatior and show that
the activity is highest in the oldest parts of fungus gardens
where the concentration of glucose is very low.

Results
Degenerate primers designed from conserved domains of
known fungal xylanases amplified a gene (LgXyn1) [GenBank:EF208066] with very high similarity to fungal xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 11 [12,13].
The rest of the gene sequence was obtained with a RACE
(Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) based method,
using specific primers designed from the initially amplified sequence. The protein sequence (fig. 2) showed 78 %
amino acid identity (Blast score = 251 bits, E-value = 2e65; 196 of the 234 amino acids) to a xylanase from the
basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune [16] and 61 %
identity (Blast score = 221 bits, e-value = 3e-56; 198 of the
234 amino acids) to a xylanase from the ascomycete Thermomyces lanuginosus [17]. The 5' untranslated region of the
cDNA transcript is only 24 bp long, whereas the 3'
untranslated region is 120 bp. The gene has an intron of
56 base pairs positioned between nucleotide 287 and 288
after the start codon (fig. 2).
The xylanase cDNA sequence was inserted in the yeast
expression vector pYES2 downstream of the galactose
inducible promoter, and transformed into yeast cells.
Extracts from transformed yeast cells grown on medium
containing galactose showed strong xylanase activity
when tested on AZCL-assay plates, while yeast cells grown
on medium containing glucose showed only weak xylanase activity (fig. 3), presumably because the promoter
has some residual activity even in the absence of galactose.
Yeast cells transformed with empty vector showed no
xylanase activity, neither on galactose nor on glucose containing medium (fig. 3).
Stable fungus gardens of leaf-cutting ants have three discernible layers. The top layer has a high proportion of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/40

newly incorporated tiny leaf fragments that the ants
recently placed on the upper ridges of the garden. The top
layer is therefore normally characterized by its darker pigmentation as the newly grown hyphae have not yet
degraded the chlorophyll of the leaf material. The middle
layer is more compact and completely white, and has a
high density of swollen hyphal tips, the so-called gongylidia. The bottom layer is the oldest part of the garden, has
a somewhat darker and drier appearance and has fewer
gongylidia. This stratification of the fungus garden
implies that mycelium and substrate are continuously
moving downward in a fungus garden, a process that takes
ca. 6 weeks to be completed in our Acromyrmex lab colonies. Our laboratory rearing technique with fungus-gardens under inverted 1 l beakers [18] accurately mimics the
field situation in which fungus chambers have a similar
size and shape and where the same differently colored layers can often be observed.
Whereas protease activity was distributed evenly from bottom to top in the three fungus gardens tested (KruskallWallis, χ2 = 2.15, df = 2, p = 0.342), xylanase activity was
strongest at the bottom, only weak at the top and completely absent in the middle layer (Wilcoxon top-bottom,
Z = 3.47, p = 0.0005) (fig. 4A). The activity pattern of cellulase resembled that of xylanase, although stronger activity was observed at the top and in the middle layer
(Wilcoxon top-bottom, Z = 0.28, p = 0.779; Wilcoxon topmiddle, Z = -6.22, p < 0.001; Wilcoxon middle-bottom, Z
= -5.95, p < 0.001) (fig. 4A).
In bacteria and Ascomycota, glucose has been shown to
suppress the expression of xylanase and cellulase [19-23].
We therefore investigated whether the layer-specific activity of xylanase and cellulase in gardens of Leucoagaricus
gongylophorus were related to glucose concentrations. We
measured glucose concentrations in 10 samples for each
of the three layers of the fungus garden of colony Ae-322
and found that the top and middle layer contained about
ten times as much glucose than the bottom layer (Wilcoxon top-middle, Z = -0.4536, p = 0.6501; Wilcoxon topbottom, Z = -3.7796, p = 0.0002; Wilcoxon middle-bottom, Z = 3.7041, p = 0.0002; fig. 4B).

Discussion
In the present study we have cloned a xylanase gene from
DNA and mRNA extracted from Acromyrmex echinatior
fungus-garden material, and we have amplified the same
gene from plated monocultures of the fungal symbiont.
These findings shed important light on the ongoing
debate whether the fungal symbiont of leaf-cutting ants
has evolved from saprophytic or biotrophic free living
ancestors [24,5]. Saprophytic fungi produce extracellular
enzymes to degrade complex organic compounds such as
plant cell walls, whereas biotrophic fungi lack most of the

enzymes needed to degrade plant cell walls, but are able
to break down pectin to gain access to living plant cells
[5]. Our present finding that the Leucoagaricus gongylophorus symbiont of A. echinatior has an expressed gene encoding a xylanase is thus consistent with a saprotrophic origin
of the fungal symbiont of attine ants. This also matches
the phylogenetic evidence showing that the gongylidiaproducing symbionts of the higher attines are a derived
group of fungi originating from an ancestor that was likely
cultivated by a lower attine ant, where it used dead but not
highly degraded plant material [25-27]. Although the fun-

gal symbiont has the enzymatic capacity to degrade xylan,
it is as yet unknown whether the fungus is also able to further degrade the xylobiose product into xylose, and
whether the fungus can assimilate xylose and use it as a
carbon source (fig. 1). The ants, however, are able to survive on xylose and therefore likely able to utilize xylose as
a carbon source [28]. An alternative hypothesis is that the
fungus produces xylanase merely to break down hemicellulose in the cell walls of leaf material to gain access to the
easy degradable compounds within the cells but without
assimilating the degradation products of xylan. However,

as biotrophic fungi apparently are able to penetrate the
cell wall without the need of cell wall degrading enzymes,
we don't find this alternative hypothesis plausible.

underlines that our approach has considerable potential
for studying the activity of other enzymes in attine fungus
gardens.

Previous studies have measured xylanase activity in the
fungus gardens of leaf-cutting ants, either by determining
enzyme activity in fungal material taken directly from gardens [29,30] or from symbiont fungus grown in vitro on
xylan-containing medium [31]. However, the fungus gardens of leaf-cutting ants are home to a wide array of
microorganisms some of which have polysaccharidase
activity [32-39]. It can therefore not be ruled out that
some of the enzymatic activities found in earlier studies
might have originated from these other microorganisms
or from ants or substrate material incorporated in the garden. Our present molecular approach resolves this ambiguity and allows us to conclude that the fungal symbiont
has the enzymatic capability to degrade xylan, and to
make the inference that at least a large part of the xylanase
activity observed in this study and in previous studies
derives from the fungal symbiont of the ants. This also

Fungus gardens as natural decomposition gradients
The observed patterns of enzyme activities in the fungus
gardens suggests that degradation of plant tissue takes
place as a multi-step process, starting at the top of the garden where new substrate is applied by the ants, and ending at the bottom of the garden with old substrate that
eventually will be discarded by the ants. The process starts
with the degradation of compounds with high nutritious
value, such as proteins that have a high content of nitrogen, and ends with the degradation of plant cell wall
polysaccharides, which can be assumed to have a lower
nutritious value. A multi-step degradation process of leaf
substrate in fungus gardens is appealing as a working
hypothesis, because it would match the general pattern of
biodegradation of organic matter in soil ecosystems,
where specialized decomposers colonize the dead plant
material in a distinct succession, starting with fast growing

found [28-31]. The levels of xylanase activity found in
these studies range from 32 μg hp/m/gww (hydrolysis
products per min per gram wet weight of fungal cells) [30]
to 567 μmol hp/m/gdw (hydrolysis products per min per
gram dry weight of fungal cells) [28], and the levels of cellulase activity range from 7.5 μg hp/m/gww [30] to 646
μmol hp/m/gdw [28]. In both cases this corresponds to a
difference of about three orders of magnitude. In contrast
our analyses had relatively modest SE's around the averages obtained. We therefore hypothesize that at least part
of this earlier variation might be explainable by our finding that xylanase and cellulase activity is not uniform
within fungus gardens, but predominantly concentrated
in the oldest parts.

populations of bacteria and so-called sugar fungi that
assimilate the readily available soluble compounds [4042], followed by slower growing ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi that are able to degrade the structural components of the plant material.
Our present results do not allow us to establish that the
measured enzyme activities in fungus gardens are due to
the activity of only a single symbiont, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, or whether multiple microorganisms are
involved, but we expect that the possible contributions of
other microorganisms have been minor, given the massive dominance of biomass of the fungal symbiont. However, in either scenario the ants can potentially regulate
the efficiency of degradation by adjusting the length of
time the substrate is staying in the garden, and thereby
regulate the release of nutrients according to the actual
nutritional need of the colony.
In previous studies of xylanase and cellulase activity in the
fungus gardens of A. echinatior or closely related leaf-cutting ant species, a large variation in enzyme activity was

Molecular and behavioural mechanisms maintaining
stratified fungus gardens
Many xylanolytic and cellulolytic genes are co-regulated
in microorganisms, which seems logical because the natural degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose is normally tightly connected. Both types of enzymes are often
observed to be induced by D-xylose, xylobiose, xylan, cellobiose and cellulose and to be repressed by glucose [1923]. Induction of these genes seems to be mediated by the
transcription activator XlnR, which binds to conserved
motifs in the promoter region of cellulolytic and xylanolytic genes to induce expression [21,23]. Repression, on
the other hand, is mediated by the transcription repressor
protein CreA (a protein isolated form Aspergillus) or Cre1
(the ortholog of CreA isolated from Trichoderma)
[22,23,43-45]. Like XlnR, CreA/Cre1 binds to a conserved
motif in the promoter region of the gene, but in this case
transcription is inhibited. We hypothesize that similar
molecular mechanisms are governing the expression of
degradation enzymes in the fungus gardens of leaf-cutting
ants, which may explain the observed correlation of cellulase and xylanase activities in the middle and lower parts
of the gardens (fig. 4A) and their inverse relationship with
glucose concentrations. A role of glucose as a regulator of
the expression of polysaccharide degrading enzymes has
also been suggested by Silva et al. [46,47], and is in agreement with findings in other filamentous fungi, where glucose is known to be a repressor of xylanolytic and
cellulolytic enzyme genes. This effect of glucose would be
logical as there is no need to produce polysccharide
degrading enzymes when glucose is abundant, whereas a
low glucose concentration would indicate a low level of
monosaccharides and the need to degrade polysaccharides.

In the top layer we did not find this correlation between
glucose levels and enzyme activities, as glucose levels were
comparable to those in the middle layer, whereas xylanase
activity was intermediate and cellulase activity was high.
One possible explanation could be that the top layer of a

Page 6 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:40

fungus garden also contains inducers of cellulase and
xylanase expression that compensate for the repression
effect of glucose. Another possibility is that the cellulase
and xylanase activity in the top layer is in fact not produced by the top mycelium, as it has previously been
shown that leaf-cutting ants mix new leaf material with
fecal fluids before inserting the fragmented leaf material
into the fungus garden [1]. The fecal droplets contain proteins originating from the fungal symbiont, and apparently pass undigested through the alimentary channel of
the ants [48-53]. A broad spectrum of enzymes has been
found in the fecal droplets, and among these are some
that show xylanolytic and cellulolytic activity
[29,30,50,52]. However, whether these enzymes originate
from the ants, the symbiont food ingested by the ants, or
another organism in the fungus garden remains to be unequivocally determined. Clarifying the molecular details of
enzyme transfer via the fecal droplets may therefore shed
very interesting light on the advances of fungus farming
that the evolutionary derived leaf-cutting ants achieved
relative to their ancestors who could, together with their
fungal symbionts, only process dead organic substrate.

Conclusion
The fungal symbiont of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex
echinatior expresses a functional xylanase gene, which
indicates that it can degrade plant cell wall material and
corroborates that the attine ant symbiont has a saprotrophic origin.
Enzymatic degradation activity varied considerably
between different layers of fungus gardens suggesting that
the degradation of leaf substrate is subdivided in a series
of distinct enzymatic steps.
Cellulase and xylanase activities were to some extent negatively correlated with glucose concentrations, indicating
that glucose could have a regulatory role for the expression of these enzymes.

Methods
Biological material
Colonies of Acromyrmex echinatior (numbers Ae150,
Ae219, Ae300 and Ae322) were collected in Gamboa,
Panama and maintained in the laboratory under standard
conditions of 25°C and 70% relative humidity [18] where
they were supplied with a diet of bramble leaves, rice and
pieces of apple. Pure cultures of the symbiotic fungus were
obtained by inoculating mycelium collected from fungus
gardens onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, and incubating them at 25°C in the dark. A characteristic of the
fungal symbiont of higher attine ants is the formation of
gongylidia [1,25,54]. The presence of gongylidia in the
fungus cultures was thus used as an indicator for the isolation of the right species of fungus. Further proof of spe-

cies identity was obtained by sequencing the ITS region
from these isolates [55]. DNA was obtained by grinding
fresh fungus material from fungal gardens and fungal cultures in liquid nitrogen and extracting DNA using a CTAB
based method as described by Saghai-Maroof et al. [56]
with small modifications. As our objective was to obtain
cDNA and protein sequences, we also obtained total RNA
from the same fungus garden material by grinding in liquid nitrogen and extracting RNA using the RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
Cloning of LgXyn1
To obtain candidate xylanase genes, several degenerate
primers were designed from conserved motifs in fungal
xylanases, which were found by aligning known
sequences of fungal xylanases belonging to glycoside
hydrolase families 10 and 11. These primers were used in
PCR to amplify the corresponding sequence from Leucoagaricus gongylophorus genomic DNA obtained from colony
Ae300. The degenerate sense primer 5'-TTY GTN GGI
GGN AAR GGI TGG-3' and the degenerate antisense
primer 5'-CCY TCN GTI GCI CAN AYY TG-3' amplified a
fragment of 475 bp using the following PCR scheme: one
cycle of 95°C for 2 min, then 20 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec,
54°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 15 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec, 54°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 2 min,
and ending with one cycle of 72°C for 7 min. From the
amplified sequence obtained, specific forward and reverse
primers were designed, which were used to clone the
5'end and 3'end using the SMART RACE cDNA kit
(CLONTECH). The 3'end was cloned using the sense
primer 5'-AAT TTA GGG ATG AAT TTG GGT TCC-3' with
PCR conditions consisting of one cycle of 95°C for 3 min,
then 12 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 70°C for 30 sec (with a
0.8°C decrease every cycle) and 72°C for 2 min, followed
by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C
for 3 min., and ending with one cycle of 72°C for 10 min.
The 5'end was cloned using the antisense primer 5'-ACC
CCT TCC TCG CGG CAG CGG AGG AGG G-3', followed
by the nested primer 5'-GTA AGT ACC GCT GTA CTG GAT
CAC TCT GCC-3', which was designed to span the intron.
The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 95°C for
5 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 1 min with an extension of 2 sec every cycle,
and ending with one cycle of 72°C for 7 min. All PCR
products were cloned in pCR4-TOPO before sequencing
using the TOPO TA cloning method (Invitrogen). The
position and sequence of the intron was determined by
alignment of the two gene sequences obtained from
genomic DNA and cDNA. The xylanase gene was finally
amplified and sequenced from DNA extracted from pure
fungus cultures, to confirm its origin from the fungal symbiont.

Heterologous expression in yeast
Heterologous expression of the xylanase cDNA sequence
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was done to confirm the xylanase identity of the protein and to determine whether the
fungal xylanase sequence was functionally active. To this
end, the coding sequence of the xylanase gene was PCR
amplified from cDNA using the sense primer 5'-AAG CTT
CAC CAC AGT TGC AGA ATG GTC-3' together with the
antisense primer 5'-TCT AGA TCA AGC GAC GGT GAT
ACT AG-3'. PCR conditions were one cycle of 95°C for 5
min, then 15 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 20 cycles of 95°C for 30
sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min with an extension
of 2 sec every cycle, and ending with one cycle of 72°C for
7 min.

The amplified cDNA was sequenced, to ensure that no
PCR errors had been incorporated into the construct, and
inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of a galactose inducible promoter.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (MATa his3D1 leu2
trp1-289 ura3-52, Invitrogen) was transformed with either
the pYES2 vector containing the xylanase gene (pYES2LgXyn1) or an empty pYES2 vector using the LiOAc/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method [57]. As the pYES2 vector
contains the URA3 gene, positive transformants could be
selected by plating on a uracil depleted yeast medium consisting of 2 % glucose, 2 % bacto-agar, 0.7 % (wt/vol)
yeast nitrogen base (Invitrogen) and 0.2 % yeast synthetic
drop-out media supplement without uracil (SigmaAldrich), and incubating at 25°C for 3 days. Ura+ colonies
were grown in a similar medium without agar and with
either 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose at 25°C over night.
Yeast cells from 5 ml culture were harvested by centrifugation, ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle,
and dissolved in an equal amount of 50 mM Tris pH 7.0
to be used in an AZCL-xylan assay.
AZCL plate assays
To investigate which parts of the fungus gardens of laboratory colonies expressed xylanase, cellulase and protease
activity, an agarose medium consisting of 1% agarose, 23
mM phosphoric acid, 23 mM acetic acid and 23 mM boric
acid of pH 4.7 was heated until the agarose was melted
and then cooled to 65°C. After this, 0.1 % (w/v) AZCLxylan, AZCL-HE-cellulose or AZCL-casein (Megazymes)
was added and the medium was poured into petri dishes.
After the medium had solidified, wells were made with a
cut off pipette tip to give a diameter of ca. 4 mm. Fungus
garden proteins were extracted by grinding ca 100 mg
fresh fungal material with a sterile pestle in eppendorf
tubes containing 2.5 times as much 50 mM Tris pH 7.0.
The extract was centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 15,000 g,
and 20 μl of the supernatant was applied to each well.
After 22 hours of incubation at 25°C the plates were pho-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/40

tographed and the area of the blue halo surrounding the
well (which is a quantitative measure for the amount of
substrate degraded) was measured using the software program ImageJ ver. 1.29w. Ten samples of 100 mg fungal
material were taken from the top, middle and bottom
layer of the gardens of three colonies (Ae150, Ae219 and
Ae322). All these 90 samples were tested for xylanase, cellulase and protease activity using AZCL-xylan, AZCL-HEcellulose and AZCL-casein respectively. Statistical tests
were done with the statistical package S-plus version 6.1
for Windows.
Glucose assay
To determine the glucose concentration in fungal garden
material from the same top, middle and bottom parts of
fungus gardens, extracts were prepared as described for the
AZCL plate assays. The glucose concentration of the supernatant was measured using the Rotitest d-Glucose kit
(Carl Roth) as described by the manufacturer with minor
modifications. Briefly, 5 μl supernatant was mixed with
50 μl assay buffer and 95 μl water. The absorbance was
then measured at 340 nm using a plate reader (Molecular
Devices) before and after incubation with 1 μl Hexokinase/Glucose-6-Phosphate mixture. Calculation of glucose content was performed as described in the manual
provided by the manufacturer. The glucose concentration
was determined in 10 samples taken from each of the
three layers of a single fungus garden (Ae322).
