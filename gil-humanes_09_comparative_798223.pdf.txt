Abstract
Background: The APETALA2-like genes form a large multi-gene family of transcription factors
which play an important role during the plant life cycle, being key regulators of many developmental
processes. Many studies in Arabidopsis have revealed that the APETALA2 (AP2) gene is implicated in
the establishment of floral meristem and floral organ identity as well as temporal and spatial
regulation of flower homeotic gene expression.
Results: In this work, we have cloned and characterised the AP2-like gene from accessions of
Hordeum chilense and Hordeum vulgare, wild and domesticated barley, respectively, and compared
with other AP2 homoeologous genes, including the Q gene in wheat. The Hordeum AP2-like genes
contain two plant-specific DNA binding motifs called AP2 domains, as does the Q gene of wheat.
We confirm that the H. chilense AP2-like gene is located on chromosome 5Hch. Patterns of
expression of the AP2-like genes were examined in floral organs and other tissues in barley, wheat
and in tritordeum amphiploids (barley × wheat hybrids). In tritordeum amphiploids, the level of
transcription of the barley AP2-like gene was lower than in its barley parental and the chromosome
substitutions 1D/1Hch and 2D/2Hch were seen to modify AP2 gene expression levels.
Conclusion: The results are of interest in order to understand the role of the AP2-like gene in the
spike morphology of barley and wheat, and to understand the regulation of this gene in the
amphiploids obtained from barley-wheat crossing. This information may have application in cereal
breeding programs to up- or down-regulate the expression of AP2-like genes in order to modify
spike characteristics and to obtain free-threshing plants.

Background
One of the main objectives of cereal breeding is to expand
genetic variability within cultivated species. Wild species,
related to cultivated crops, are an important source of variability. Inter-specific hybridization can be used to introgress genetic variability from wild species into crops and
to produce new species with valuable agronomic traits. An
example of this is the hexaploid tritordeum, an amphip-

loid obtained by crossing Triticum turgidum L. (Thell) (2n
= 4x = 28) with Hordeum chilense (Roem. et Schult.) (HchHch, 2n = 2x = 14). Primary tritordeums exhibit enormous
genetic variability for many valuable agronomic and quality traits. For example, the grain and flour from tritordeum
has similar functional properties to bread wheat [1], but
with higher pigment content [2,3]. Most of this genetic
variability can be attributed to H. chilense, a wild relative

of cultivated barley (H. vulgare L.) that occurs exclusively
in Chile and Argentina which is highly polymorphic both
morphologically and biochemically. The variability for
important agronomic traits, such as endosperm storage
proteins [4,5], carotenoid content [6] and resistance to
biotic stresses [7], linked to its high crossability, makes H.
chilense a suitable candidate as a source of genetic variability for the transfer of useful genes to wheat by wide crossing. However, in the process of hybridization, undesirable
traits such as rachis brittleness and non-free threshing
characters, present in wild barley, are also transferred to
the hybrid, limiting its use as an alternative cereal crop.
Many genetic systems have been proposed as responsible
for the free-threshing character in hexaploid wheat.
MacKey [8] proposed a polygenic system distributed
throughout the three genomes that counteracts glume
tenacity and rachis brittleness. A second system is related
to the major gene or gene complex Q [9,10] located in the
long arm of the chromosome 5A which governs the freethreshing character and square spike phenotype. In addition, the Q gene pleiotropically influences many other
characters determinant for domestication such as rachis
fragility [9,11], glume shape and tenacity [10,12], spike
length [10,13], plant height [10,13,14] and spike emergence time [13]. Other genes which influence the freethreshing habit include the Tg locus, located on chromosome 2D [11,15] that codes for tenacious glumes and is
thought to inhibit the expression of the Q gene.
Simons et al. [16] have cloned and characterized the Q
gene in wheat and showed that it has a high homology to
members of the APETALA2 (AP2) family of transcription
factors. This gene family is characterized by two plant-specific DNA binding motifs referred to as AP2 domains. The
AP2 genes form a large multigene family, and play multiple roles during the plant life cycle being key regulators of
many developmental processes such as floral organ identity determination or control of leaf epidermal cell identity [17]. Many studies in Arabidopsis have revealed that
the AP2 gene is implicated in the establishment of floral
meristem identity [18,19], floral organ identity [20-22]
and the temporal and spatial regulation of flower homeotic gene expression [23].
AP2 domain R1

In the present work, we have cloned and characterised an
AP2-like gene from accessions of H. chilense and H. vulgare, wild and domesticated barley respectively, and compared these with other homoeologous genes, including
the Q gene from wheat. The pattern of expression of the
AP2-like gene in floral organs and other tissues in barley,
wheat and amphiploid tritordeum was also studied. The
results are relevant to understanding the role of the AP2like gene in the spike morphology of barley and wheat
and in hybrids obtained from their crossing and for modification of the expression of AP2-like genes to modify the
spike characteristics of cereals for breeding purposes. In
addition, the results provide insight into how important
agronomic genes such as AP2 are regulated in cereal
hybrids.

Results
Structure of the AP2-like genes from H. vulgare and H.
chilense and their predicted proteins
Genomic DNA and complete cDNA sequences obtained
in this work from H. vulgare cv Betzes (line H106) and H.
chilense (lines H1 and H208), and their predicted proteins
were searched using BLASTn and BLASTp algorithms.
Results showed a high homology to many floral homeotic
genes and their corresponding proteins such as the T. aestivum floral homeotic (Q) mRNA [GenBank: AY702956,
AAU94922], the H. vulgare AP2-like mRNA [GenBank:
AY069953, AAL50205], the Zea mays indeterminate spikelet 1 (ids1) mRNA [GenBank: AF048900, AAC05206], the
Oryza sativa transcription factor AP2D2 mRNA [GenBank:
AY685113, AAO65862] and the A. thaliana APETALA2
[GenBank: U12546, AAC13770]. All these genes belong
to an AP2 subfamily of putative transcription factors
which are characterized by the presence of two DNA binding motifs, referred to as AP2 domains, which consist of
60 and 61 conserved amino acids, respectively (Figure 1).
Predicted proteins for H. vulgare cv Betzes and H. chilense
lines reported here, also revealed the presence of these
AP2 domains in the deduced amino acid sequences. The
structure of the AP2-like genes of the Hordeum genotypes
is similar to that of other AP2-like genes (Figure 1). They
all presented 10 exons and 9 introns, and the 21 nt microRNA binding site (miRNA172), which is highly conserved
in all AP2-like genes with only a single nucleotide change

in the T. aestivum cv Chinese spring AP2-like sequence
[GenBank: AY702956].
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the genomic
DNA, its open reading frame (ORF) and the resulting protein of the AP2-like genes from H. vulgare cv. Betzes
(H106) and H. chilense lines H11 and H208, and comparisons with H. vulgare cv. Forester and T. aestivum cv Chinese spring. In genomic DNA gene length ranged from
3229 bp in T. aestivum to 3244 bp in H. chilense line H11
while the ORF extended 1323 bp in all the genotypes
except in T. aestivum, which was slightly longer with 1344
bp. Therefore, the protein length was 447 amino acids for
T. aestivum and 440 amino acids for the rest of genotypes.
The GC content was higher for all genotypes in the ORF
(64.1% to 65%) than in genomic DNA (51.4% to 53.3%).
The estimated molecular weight of the proteins was
around 48–49 KDa while their theoretical isoelectric
points (pI) were between 6.72 and 7.31. The percentage of
identity and polymorphism of the sequences were estimated by means of a comparative alignment of all the
genotypes with the T. aestivum cv Chinese Spring [GenBank: AY702956]. The percentage of identity ranged from
82.1% to 83% in the genomic DNA, from 91.9% to 92.6%
in the ORF and from 89.8% to 91.8% at protein level
(Table 1). These data confirm the high resemblance
between the genotypes at transcript and protein levels.
The ORFs from H. vulgare cv Betzes (line H106) and H.
chilense (lines H11 and H208) AP2-like genes were
aligned and compared. Table 2 shows all the nucleotide
changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), insertions and deletions) and their positions with respect to H.

vulgare cv Betzes (line H106). Fifty-two polymorphisms
were observed among the three genotypes, three of them
were insertions/deletions (Ins/Del) and the rest were
SNPs. Only sixteen of the polymorphisms (indicated in
bold and asterisk) caused changes in the amino acid
sequence.
Comparison of the AP2 predicted proteins from H. vulgare
cv. Betzes (H106) and H. chilense lines H11 and H208,
with other AP2-like proteins is showed in Figure 2. All the
AP2-like proteins compared had similar structural organizations: Motif 1, Motif 2, the nuclear localizing signal, the
first AP2-domain (AP2 R1), the second AP2-domain (AP2
R2), and Motif 3. The two AP2 domains were strongly
conserved among the different species. Hence, the two
AP2 domains were almost identical in the three Triticeae
species compared (T. aestivum, H. chilense and H. vulgare)
with only a single amino acid change in the H. vulgare
sequences (position 258 of the protein) and another in
the T. aestivum sequence (position 269). The three motifs
and the nuclear localizing signal were also highly conserved in all the species aligned in Figure 2. The relationships among the AP2-like proteins was confirmed by
constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the the neighbor-joining method (Additional File 1: Phylogenetic tree
of the AP2-like proteins). The resulting tree showed that
the Hordeum genotypes clustered together and very close
to T. aestivum while the rest of the genotypes were distant.
Chromosomal location of the AP2-like gene in H. chilense
The chromosomal location of the AP2-like gene in H.
chilense was demonstrated by using a 5Hch addition line of
wheat, a 5D/5Hch substitution line of tritordeum

(HT374), and a 1D/1Hch and 2D/2Hch double substitution line of tritordeum (HT382). Figure 3 shows the result
of the amplification by PCR of a sequence of the genomic
barley AP2-like gene using the pair of primers AP2*F2/
AP2Hch*R2 and the DNA isolated from the above genotypes. Amplification of the barley AP2 was obtained in
genotypes carrying the 5Hch chromosome, these are H.
chilense H1, the 5Hch addition line of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, and the tritordeum lines HT382 (1D/1Hch,
2D/2Hch) and HT22. In contrast, the wheat cv. Chinese
spring and the tritordeum line HT374 (5D/5Hch) did not
show amplification (Figure 3). This result shows that the
AP2-like gene in H. chilense is located in the chromosome
5Hch and tritordeum line HT374 (5D/5Hch) lacks the 5Hch
chromosome and therefore the AP2-like gene.
Quantitative real-time PCR of AP2-like genes
The expression level of the AP2-like genes were determined in different tissues by qRT-PCR in wild (H1) and
domesticated (H106) barley, durum wheat (T22), bread
wheat (cv Bobwhite 'BW208'), and tritordeum (HT22,
HT374 and HT382). We designed two sets of primers to
specifically amplify a fragment of the AP2-like cDNA cor-

responding to wheat genome (AP2*F2/AP2Ta*R2) and
Hordeum genome (AP2*F2/AP2Hch*R2) respectively
(Table 3). Therefore, primer pair AP2*F2/AP2Ta*R2 was
used to quantify the expression of the wheat AP2-like gene
in durum and bread wheat (genotypes T22 and BW208)
as well as in tritordeum genotypes HT22, HT374 and
HT382. On the other hand, AP2*F2/AP2Hch*R2 primers
were used to quantify the expression barley AP2-like gene
in H. chilense (H1), H. vulgare (H106), and in the above
tritordeum genotypes. The amplification result of each
pair of primers is shown in Figure 4. The qRT-PCR product
of each reaction had a unique melting temperature peak,
indicating that specific amplification occurred. Figure 4A
shows the dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis of genotypes H1, H106, T22 and BW208. The
two peaks corresponding to Triticum genotypes (T22 and
BW208) had the same melting temperature (83.6°C),
while the wild barley (H1) peak had a lower melting temperature (82.2°C). The cultivated barley dissociation
curve (H106) presented a melting temperature of 83.2°C.
The expected product size was 104 bp for Triticum genotypes and 108 bp for both wild and cultivated barley. This
fragment of 108 bp contains 8 SNP differences between

wild (H11 and H208) and cultivated barley (H106) and is
identical in H11 and H208. Consequently, differences in
melting temperature of PCR products between wild and
cultivated barley can be explained by those 8 SNPs found
between the two sequences. Figure 4B shows the dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis of the specific
amplification of the wheat and barley AP2-like genes
using the three tritordeum lines HT22, HT374 and
HT382. As above, the predicted product size was 104 bp
and 108 bp for wheat and barley AP2-like genes, respectively. Although this 4 nucleotide difference could not be
observed in the agarose gel, different melting temperatures were detected for each PCR product, indicating that
specific amplification occurred in tritordeum background.
In addition, melting temperatures of PCR products in tritordeum lines of both wheat AP2-like gene and barley
AP2-like gene were similar to that in wheat genotypes and
wild barley respectively, as described above (Figure 4B).
The expression of wheat and barley AP2-like genes was
determined in roots, stems, young leaves, and spikes at
various developmental stages, and normalized with the
expression of the actin gene as a reference. Figure 5A and

5B compare the relative expression of the AP2-like gene in
wild (H1) and cultivated (H106) barley, and in durum
(T22) and bread (BW208) wheat. Expression of the AP2like gene was detected in all the tissues and genotypes. In
roots and stems, wild barley (H1) had higher transcription levels than cultivated barley (H106). In turn, durum
wheat had higher expression levels in roots but lower in
stems than that of bread wheat. All four genotypes
showed similar expression levels in young leaves. In the
case of spikes, expression levels of the AP2-like gene
decreased in all genotypes over the course of development
and emergence of the spike (Figure 5B). Figures 5C and
5D compare the level of transcription of the corresponding wheat and barley AP2-like genes in the three tritordeum lines tested. Line HT374 has the 5D/5Hch
substitution whereas line HT382 has the double substitution 1D/1Hch and 2D/2Hch. Finally, line HT22 is a tritordeum amphiploid with no chromosome substitution.
Line HT22 showed higher expression of the barley AP2like gene in roots but lower than that of wheat in stems
and young leaves. Line HT374 lacks the 5Hch chromosome and therefore the expression of the barley AP2-like
gene was not detected in this genotype in roots, stems and

young leaves (Figure 5C). Although line HT382 contains
the 5Hch chromosome, and therefore the barley AP2-like
gene (Figure 3), its expression was strongly reduced in
roots, stems and young leaves (Figure 5C). Finally, in
developing spikes, the expression levels of the wheat AP2like gene in tritordeum HT22 was higher than that of barley (Figure 5D). In line HT374 the expression of the AP2like gene was not detected whereas in line HT382 its
remains at a low level during spike development (Figure
5D),
The ratio between the expression levels of wheat and barley AP2-like genes (wheat AP2/barley AP2) in different tissues of the amphiploid tritordeum HT22 was calculated
and compared with transcription levels in the corresponding H1 (H. chilense) and T22 (T. durum) parentals (Figure
6). In all the tissues studied, the level of transcription of
the wheat AP2-like gene in durum wheat (T22) was lower
than the transcription level of the barley AP2-like gene in
wild barley (H1) and therefore, the wheat/barley AP2
ratio was below 1. In contrast, in the amphiploid tritordeum (HT22), the wheat AP2-like gene was transcribed at
higher levels in all tissues, except in roots. Consequently
the wheat/barley AP2 ratio was higher in the amphiploid
HT22 than in its corresponding H1 and T22 parentals.
The wheat/barley AP2 ratio in the amphiploid was higher

in young leaves and developing spikes than that of roots
and stems (Figure 6).

Discussion
Alignments of the sequenced cDNA and DNA of the H.
chilense lines H11 and H208, and H. vulgare line H106
have shown that the internal structure of exons and
introns of the AP2-like gene described in this work (Figure
1) is the same as that reported for the Q gene in wheat
[GenBank: AY702956] [16], with 10 exons and 9 introns.
BLAST searches revealed that the sequenced genes belong
to the AP2 family of transcription factors which includes
the floral homeotic gene AP2 [22] and AINTEGUMENTA
(ANT) [24,25] involved in lateral organ development by
controlling cell number and growth [26,27]. AP2-like
genes are distinguished by having two plant-specific DNA
binding motifs called AP2 domains and function as key
developmental regulators in reproductive and vegetative
organs [17]. Additionally, the AP2-like genes possess one
microRNA172 binding site in the 3' region (Figure 1). The
microRNA miR172 with 21-nucleotide non-coding RNA
was reported to down-regulate several Arabidopsis genes in
the AP2 subfamily [28,29]. This miR172 and its target
sequence are highly conserved in all the genotypes aligned
in Figure 2, with only a single change in the sequence of
the T. aestivum cv Chinese spring [GenBank: AY702956].

The conserved DNA binding motifs, referred to as AP2
domains R1 and R2, consist of 60 and 61 amino acids
respectively and the alignment with other AP2-like proteins confirmed that these domains are highly conserved,
even between non-related species such as H. chilense and
A. thaliana (Figure 2). Jofuku et al. [22] isolated and characterized the AP2 gene from A. thaliana [GenBank:
U12546] and reported a 53% of identity between the two
AP2 domains R1 and R2 in the central core of the AP2
polypeptide. They also described the presence of an 18amino acids conserved core region in the two AP2
domains with a 72.2% of identity between them. This
region is theoretically capable of forming amphipathic αhelical structures that may participate in protein-protein
interactions. This α-helical structure could also participate
in DNA binding, perhaps through the interaction of its
hydrophobic face with the major groove of the DNA, as
described for other proteins with similar α-helical structure [30]. In the study reported here, the AP2 R1 domain
from H. chilense line H11 has 95% of identity with the corresponding amino acid sequence of that from A. thaliana
described by Jofuku et al.[22], while the conserved core
region is identical. On the other hand, when comparing
the AP2 R2 domain of the two species we found 83.6% of
identity in the full domain and 72.2% in the core region.
Jofuku et al. [22] also reported the presence of a highly
basic 10-amino acids domain adjacent to the AP2 R1
domain that included a putative nuclear localization
sequence KKSR [31,32] which suggested that the AP2 may
function in the nucleus. The same domain of 10 amino
acids is present in the sequences reported here with only a
change in the second position of the nuclear localization
sequence (threonine instead serine) which is conserved in
all the Triticeae sequences of the AP2-like proteins aligned
in Figure 2. Tang et al. [33] described the amino acid
sequences of the three motifs found in the AP2-like protein in rice and compared it with other AP2-like proteins
from different species. We have found similar structures in
the predicted AP2-like proteins of wild (H11 and H208)
and cultivated (H106) barley (Figure 2).
Previous experiments involving the cytogenetic analysis of
aneuploids have located the Q gene in the long arm of
chromosome 5A of the wheat genome [9,34]. The H.
chilense genome has been demonstrated to be collinear to
other Triticeae genomes including those of bread wheat
and H. vulgare [35] so that the AP2-like gene was predicted
to be on chromosome 5Hch of H. chilense. To confirm this,
the AP2-like gene from H. chilense was amplified by PCR
in H. chilense (H1), T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, a 5Hch
addition line of T. aestivum cv. Chinese spring, an
amphiploid tritordeum (HT22), and two tritordeum lines
HT374 and HT382 carrying chromosome substitutions
(Figure 3). The results confirmed that the barley AP2-like
gene is located on chromosome 5Hch and that the HT374

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/66

substitution line (5D/5Hch) effectively lacks this chromosome.
Expression of the AP2-like gene was detected in all tissues
studied. The transcription level peaked in the early stages
of spike development and gradually decreased with spike
maturation, being very similar in all the genotypes tested
when the spike was fully emerged. These results are similar to those reported by Simons et al. [16] who observed
higher expression of the Q gene in developing spikes, with
a peak at the first stages of spike growth in wheat genotypes. Simons et al. [16] also reported lower expression in
non-floral organs such as leaves and roots. Jofuku et al.
[22] studied the transcription of AP2 in A. thaliana obtaining expression in floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens,
carpels, developing ovules and inflorescence meristems)
and also in non-floral organs (stems and leaves).
We characterised the expression of the AP2-like gene in
wild (H. chilense genotype H1) and cultivated barley (H.
vulgare genotype H106) (Figure 4) and found a higher
level of transcription in wild barley in roots, stems and
developing spikes. Simons et al. [16] reported that the
transcription level of the Q allele, contained in bread and
durum wheat cultivars, was consistently higher than that
of q allele, contained in wild wheats, and this was related
with differences in spike morphology. They also described
that the single amino acid difference found in their predicted proteins could provide higher efficiency in
homodimer formation in the Q allele with respect to that
of the q allele. They suggested that the Q protein
homodimer complex recognizes a region on its own promoter, enhancing the expression of the Q allele and leading to higher levels of the Q protein, and this was related
to phenotypic differences in spike morphology between
cultivated and wild wheats. Despite this, differences
between Q and q can be compensated by a gene dosage
effect, with 2.5 doses of q being equal to 1 dose of Q [10].
Our results with wild and cultivated barley showed that H.
chilense (wild) had higher AP2-like gene expression levels
than H. vulgare (cultivated). According to the model proposed by Simons et al., [16], in the case of barley, the
homodimer formation should be higher in H. chilense
than that of H. vulgare, resulting in higher transcript levels
of the AP2-like gene in H. chilense. As for wheat, differences in expression levels for the AP2-like gene in wild
and cultivated barley could be responsible for phenotypic
differences in spike morphology. However, in barley, the
line showing higher expression levels of the AP2-like gene
is H. chilense which is not the cultivated phenotype.
Hence, the wheat model does not entirely fit to barley,
either because the mechanism in barley is different or
because the mechanism is more complex than that
reported by Simons et al. [16]. In the case of wheat, the Q

Page 9 of 13

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:66

and q alleles differ only by one amino acid while the AP2like genes from wild and cultivated barley differ by 17
amino acids. Therefore, differences in the spike morphology between wild and cultivated barley may not only be
due to AP2-like gene expression level, but additional elements must be added to the model to explain better the
contribution of the AP2-like gene to spike morphology in
barley.
We have also characterised the expression of the AP2-like
genes corresponding to wheat and barley genomes in tritordeum amphiploids (HT22, HT374 and HT382). The
comparison of the expression as wheat/barley AP2 ratio
when both genes are expressed together in the tritordeum
amphiploid (HT22) and when they are expressed separately in their parental lines, H. chilense (H1) and T. durum
(T22), showed that the relative expression of the wheat
AP2-like gene in different tissues was very constant in the
amphiploid and in its durum wheat parental (T22). However, the level of transcription of the barley AP2-like gene
was 3.5 times lower in the amphiploid than in its barley
parental (H1). This could be explained by the presence of
a mechanism of regulation for the barley AP2-like gene
that makes it differently expressed in the amphiploid and
in barley. One of the consequences of this down-regulation of the barley AP2-like gene may be the aspect of the
spike in the tritordeum amphiploid, which is more similar to that of durum wheat than that of wild barley. However, many important agronomic features of the spike in
tritordeum, such as fragile rachis and non-free threshing
habit are similar to H. chilense.
Two tritordeum substitution lines (HT374 and HT382)
with free-threshing habit [36] showed only expression of
the wheat AP2-like gene. This was predictable for line
HT374, which has a 5D/5Hch chromosome substitution
and consequently lacks the barley AP2-like gene, but not
for line HT382 (double substitution 1D/1Hch and 2D/
2Hch) which carries the 5Hch chromosome and therefore
the barley AP2-like gene. Thus in this case, expression of
the barley AP2-like gene was affected also by substitution
of chromosomes 1Hch and/or 2Hch. Atienza et al. [36] proposed that the presence of a homoeologous q locus on
chromosome 5Hch would be responsible for the non-freethreshing habit in tritordeum, and consequently the substitution of 5D/5Hch in the line HT374 was responsible of
the free-threshing habit. It was also suggested that the
absence of chromosome 2Hch conferred the free-threshing
habit in tritordeum HT382, because of the absence of a
homoeologous Tg locus from H. chilense that codes for
tenacious glumes, in spite of the presence of q Hch locus
on chromosome 5Hch [36]. Kerber et al. [15] and Jantasuriyarat et al. [11] have proposed that the action of Tg during flower development directly or indirectly interferes
with the Q gene. The results reported from our work support this hypothesis as it appears that the absence of chro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/66

mosome 2Hch in tritordeum HT382 affects on the
expression of the barley AP2-like gene, reducing its transcription to low levels.

Conclusion
The AP2-like gene from wild and cultivated barley has
been characterised in this work. The AP2-like genes contain two plant-specific DNA binding motifs called AP2
domains as does the Q gene of wheat. The results confirmed that the barley AP2-like gene is located on chromosome 5Hch. The expression of the AP2-like genes were
studied in wheat, barley and tritordeum amphiploids
showing that the level of transcription of the barley AP2like gene in tritordeum was lower than in its barley parental. The chromosome substitutions 1D/1Hch and 2D/2Hch
influence the expression of the barley AP2 in tritordeum.
The results are of interest in understanding the role of the
AP2-like gene in the spike morphology of cereals and in
understanding the regulation of this gene in barley ×
wheat amphiploids. In addition, this information may be
used in breeding programs for regulating the expression of
AP2-like genes to modify spike characteristics and to
obtain free-threshing plants.

Methods
Plant material
Plants used in this study were from the germplasm collection of the Instituto de Agricultura Sostenible (CSIC, Cordoba, Spain), and included H. chilense accessions H1, H11
and H208 (2n = 2x = 14; HchHch), H. vulgare cv Betzes
(H106) (2n = 2x = 14; HH), Triticum durum accession T22
(2n = 4x = 28; AABB), T. aestivum cv Bobwhite (2n = 6x =
42; AABBDD) and hexaploid tritordeum accession HT22
(2n = 6x = 42; AABBHchHch) exhibiting the non-free
threshing phenotype derived from the cross between H1
and T22. In addition, two free-threshing lines of hexaploid tritordeum obtained by chromosome substitution
[36] were used: HT374 (5D/5Hch) and HT382 (1D/1Hch,
2D/2Hch). Plants were grown in a greenhouse with supplementary lights providing a day/night regime of 12/12
h at 22/16°C.
RNA isolation
Tissues for RNA extractions were collected, immediately
frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and treated with TURBO DNase (RNase-Free;
Ambion, Warrington, UK) to eliminate any DNA contamination. The resulting RNA was stored at -80°C.
Rapid amplification of 5' and 3' cDNA ends (5' and 3'
RACE PCR)
The SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA) was used for both 5'- and 3'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Four nested specific primers, two

forward and two reverse (Table 3), were designed using
the H. vulgare cv. Forester AP2-like protein mRNA
sequence [GenBank: AY069953] as template and were
used in combination with the primers provided by the kit.
The RACE PCR products were cloned into pGEMT Easy
vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and introduced into
Escherichia coli (DH5α) competent cells by transformation. The resulting plasmid was isolated, purified using
the Perfectprep Plasmid Mini Kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany), and sequenced.
Full-length open reading frame isolation
The 3' RACE PCR sequences were used in combination
with the AP2 sequence from H. vulgare cv. Forester [GenBank: AY069953] to design the primers AP2F4 and
AP2newR (Table 3) to amplify the full open reading frame
(ORF) of AP2-like gene from H. chilense lines H11, H208
and H. vulgare line H106. cDNA was synthesized using
total RNA isolated from immature spikes of above lines
using a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT) (Invitrogen. Carlsbad, CA) in combination with oligo (dT)12–18 and random nonamers
(Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Full ORF was amplified by
PCR using the following conditions: cDNA obtained from
50 ng of total RNA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 μM
of each primer, 1× CERTAMP buffer and 1 unit of CERTAMP Enzyme Mix (BIOTOOLS, Madrid, Spain) in a final
volume of 25 μl. Cycling conditions were: 94°C 3 min, 35
cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 65°C 1 min and 72°C 2 min; and
a final extension cycle of 72°C 7 min. PCR product was
purified using the GFX PCR DNA Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) and sequenced.
Edge-to-edge genomic DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated from leaves using the DNAzol
reagent (Invitrogen. Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Primers used for amplification
were AP2F4 and AP2newR (Table 3). PCR conditions for
edge-to-edge genomic amplification were 50 ng of
genomic DNA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 μM of
each primer, 1× CERTAMP buffer and 1 unit of CERTAMP
Enzyme Mix (BIOTOOLS, Madrid, Spain) in a final volume of 25 μl. Cycling conditions were the following:
94°C 3 min, 35 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 65°C 1 min and
72°C 4 min; and a final extension cycle of 72°C 7 min.
PCR products were run in a 1% agarose gel and gel-purified using the QUIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QUIAGEN
Inc., Valencia, CA). Fragments were cloned into pGEMT
Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and introduced into
E. coli (DH5α) competent cells by transformation. The
resulting plasmid was isolated, purified using the Perfectprep Plasmid Mini Kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany),
and sequenced. Three internal primers (F3APT2, F4APT2
and R5APT2) were designed and, in combination with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/66

AP2F4 and AP2newR, used for the complete sequencing
(Table 3).
Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated, and cDNA synthesised as
described above, from the following tissues of H. chilense
(H1), H. vulgare cv Betzes (H106), T. durum (T22), T. aestivum cv Bobwhite and tritordeum (lines HT22, HT374
and HT382): i) roots from 1 month old plants; ii) stems;
iii) the fourth leaf from 1 month old plants; iv) non
emerged spikes, and v) fully emerged spikes (Feeks scale
10.5). Non emerged spikes were classified as percentage of
the fully emerged spike length (Figure 7).

qRT-PCR was carried out using the SYBR green dye marker
on the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Warrington,
UK). qRT-PCR conditions were: cDNA obtained from 40
ng of total RNA, 0.4 μM of each primer and 1× SYBR
Green Master Mix in a final volume of 25 μl. Two sets of
primers were used for the specific amplification of part of
the AP2-like gene from wheat (AP2*F2/AP2Ta*R2) and
cultivated and wild barley (AP2*F2/AP2Hch*R2). The
wheat actin mRNA [GenBank: AB181991] was used as reference gene using primers ActinF4 and ActinR4 (Table 3).
Three replications of each reaction were performed with
three biological samples for each tissue sample. Cycling
conditions for qRT-PCR were the following: 95°C for 10
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec and 60°C for 1 min.
Primers efficiency was determined for all the genotypes.
