Abstract
Background: As genomes evolve after speciation, gene content, coding sequence, gene
expression, and splicing all diverge with time from ancestors with close relatives. A minimum
evolution general method for continuous character analysis in a phylogenetic perspective is
presented that allows for reconstruction of ancestral character states and for measuring along
branch evolution.
Results: A software package for reconstruction of continuous character traits, like relative gene
expression levels or alternative splice site usage data is presented and is available for download at
http://www.rossnes.org/phyrex. This program was applied to a primate gene expression dataset to
detect transcription factor binding sites that have undergone substitution, potentially having driven
lineage-specific differences in gene expression.
Conclusion: Systematic analysis of lineage-specific evolution is becoming the cornerstone of
comparative genomics. New methods, like phyrex, extend the capabilities of comparative genomics
by tracing the evolution of additional biomolecular processes.

Background
Following speciation, there are many possible molecular
events that can drive the divergence of species. Three of
the most important mechanisms include changes in the
coding sequence of proteins that alter protein function,
changes in regulatory regions that affect gene expression,
and changes in regulatory regions that affect mRNA
splicing.
The evolution of protein-coding sequences has been studied systematically in The Adaptive Evolution Database
(TAED), where such sequences were grouped into gene
families [1]. Within these gene families, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates
(Ka/Ks) was used to detect an excess of nonsynonymous

substitution, with positive selection as a proxy for potential functional change. All cases of positive selection were
mapped together from the gene tree to the species tree.
No systematic approach has been taken to examine relative gene expression or mRNA splicing in the same way,
partly because both appropriate methods and datasets are
lacking. One approach to examine the evolution of gene
expression is to examine the substitution rate in promoters and look for lineages with excess substitution, analogous to Ka/Ks for protein coding sequences [2]. This can
then be correlated with relative expression levels. An alternative approach is to reconstruct ancestral gene expression
states and to examine lineages that show a significant

mony, the method is expected to be most accurate with
short branch lengths and well articulated (speciose) trees.
Using the principle of minimum evolution, a general fast
method has been developed that explicitly reconstructs
the ancestral state of continuous character traits, like gene
expression and mRNA splicing. The speed of this method
will enable application to large datasets with many species
and readily enables a subsequent mapping of data from
gene expression trees to species trees.

change. This has recently been implemented using a maximum likelihood approach for gene expression data [3].
Another evolutionary approach to reconstructing ancestral states is minimum evolution. Similar to the principle
of parsimony, minimum evolution assumes that significant lineage-specific changes of gene expression through
evolution are rarer than conservation of gene expression
patterns. Naive comparison of gene expression values of
genes across very closely related species does not discourage this assumption. The use of minimum evolution
methods to evaluate gene expression ancestral states can
be likened to the use of parsimony to evaluate sequence
ancestral states and the algorithm is modeled after Fitch
parsimony [4]. As shown in Figure 1, examining evolution
along branches improves the signal to noise ratio, compared with examining changes between extant sequences
resulting in an analysis with more power to detect causative substitutions. As with all methods related to parsi-

Another limitation towards extending TAED-like
approaches is the lack of applicable datasets. For mRNA
splicing, comparisons of quantitative expressed sequence
tag (EST) data and genomic sequence data are used to
evaluate relative splicing levels, but existing cross-species
comparisons include very long branches [5]. For gene
expression, several datasets now exist including closely
related species or isolates of yeast [6] and primates [7].
While these datasets are preliminary, they are a starting
point to enable testing of methods. Here, we present our
minimum evolution method, which is available as free
software to download at http://www.rossnes.org/phyrex
and test its performance on the cross-species primate dataset of Enard et al. [7].

Methods
Gene Expression and Sequence Data
Gene expression data was collected from Enard et al. [7]
and contains samples from brain and liver of human,
chimpanzee and orangutan. Sequence data was collected
from Ensembl [8] and consists of the sequence 200 bp
upstream of the gene transcription start site of the genes in
the gene expression dataset.

The reference species tree was taken from Arnason et al.,
an accepted phylogeny in the field [9].
Reconstruction of Ancestral Gene Expression States
The reconstruction of continuous characters was done
using a minimum evolution approach. A range of values
was obtained by running up and down a phylogeny and
determining intervals consistent with minimum total evolution over a tree. Once the values converged on final
intervals, the mid-point of the range was selected.

Intervals for the first iteration are taken from those in the
descendant leaves or nodes. When they overlap the algorithm calculates the intersection between the intervals,
but when they don't the algorithm constructs an interval
range between the descendant intervals, as seen in Figure
2. The second iteration ran through the phylogeny to minimize the allowed intervals. This was done by checking the
upper and lower limit of the parent node interval and the
interval of the node itself. If the upper limit of the parent

node was lower than the upper limit of the node itself or
the lower limit of the parent node was higher than the
lower limit of the node itself, then the limits of the node
were changed to be the same as the parent node limits.
This is depicted as an example in Figure 3, with a corresponding sequence reconstruction depicted in Figure 4.
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
ClustalW [10] was used for multiple sequence alignment
of promoter sequences and BaseML from the Paml package [11] was used for ancestral sequence reconstruction.
Along branch analysis
TESS-Transcription Element Search Software [12] was
used to search the TRANSFAC database. TESS takes a candidate sequence as input and searches TRANSFAC for
transcription factor binding sites that can be locally
aligned with regions of the input sequence. The output
from TESS consists of a list of transcription factor binding
sites that match the input sequence and the position and
length of the transcription factor. These lists were manually controlled for each input sequence and correlated
with the substitutional information calculated from
PAML. Promoters with more than 5% pairwise substitution between human and chimpanzee were discarded. If a
substitution occurred within a transcription factor binding site along any branch, it was annotated. Distributions
were generated of the amount of along branch change in
gene expression and ultimately the number of transcription factor binding sites from TESS that were mutated
along any branch. This was normalized by the total
amount of substitution to generate an enrichment value.

Results and Discussion
A software package that utilizes a minimum evolution
algorithm to reconstruct ancestral states of continuous
character data, like relative gene expression or alternative
splicing levels and parse the amount of change to each

branch of a phylogenetic tree is presented. This software
package is available for download at http://
www.rossnes.org/phyrex.
Enard et al. present an analysis of gene expression in a set
of genes in brain and liver from human, chimpanzee with
orangutan as an outgroup [7]. Using this dataset, we
reconstructed ancestral gene expression values at the last
common ancestor of human and chimpanzee. The promoter sequences (200 bp upstream of the gene start site)
for these genes from human, chimpanzee, and mouse as
an outgroup were downloaded from Ensembl [8],
aligned, and the last common ancestor sequence from
human and chimpanzee was reconstructed using BASEML
from the PAML package [11], as described in the methods
section.
While enhancers can regulate gene expression over long
distances and can be critical to changes in gene expression, many important regulators of transcription are
located in the 200 bp immediately upstream of the gene
start site [13]. While our knowledge of enhancer function
does not permit a fully systematic analysis, analysis of
promoter regions can be used to identify a non-exhaustive
set of candidates.
The distribution of gene expression changes across
branches is shown in Figures 5 and 6 for the human and
chimpanzee lineages, respectively. The strong central peak
was expected, given the conservative properties of the
method. The asymmetry of the distributions was not
expected and may reflect problems with the original dataset. If chimpanzee genes are hybridized to human
sequences and then normalized to correct for substitution
rates, this type of bias may be expected. However, despite
the unexpected shape of the distributions, there is still signal in the data, reflected in the significant enrichment values obtained.

A sample
A sample reconstruction of relative gene expression values is shown as the algorithm progresses. Along branch values are then
obtained by subtracting the more recent node from the more ancient node. The successive values at each node reflect the values obtained moving up and down the tree as they reach convergence.

The 0.5% of genes along each lineage that were most
upregulated and downregulated were collected with the
middle 1% as a control. This corresponded to 34 and 68
genes respectively. Approximately 35% of sequences were

eliminated from the analysis because of >5% divergence

(the 100 bp more distal to the gene start site were on
average much more distant than the 100 bp more

sites using TESS [12] and the number of substitutions in

implicated by this analysis, including the prospective transcription factor binding sites that have undergone substitution. The dataset of genes is too small to pick out
significant gene function signal from the upregulated and
downregulated genes along each lineage. Along the
human lineage, there were fewer substitutions predicted
to destroy transcription factor binding sites on the up-regulated gene lineages compared with the control, while
other lineage data were not different from the control.
Because it is not clear which destroyed binding sites are
normally occupied by transcriptional activators, it is difficult to interpret the biological significance of this result.
While the binding sites predicted may be candidates for
playing an important role in the lineage-specific divergence of human and chimpanzee and warrant further testing for their activity in regulating expression from the
respective promoters, little experimental data is currently

available to further validate the study beyond the statistical validation seen in the enrichment values. However,
evolutionary approaches that consider along branch
change as opposed to pairwise comparison of extant
sequences (as in Figure 1) do hold promise in pinpointing
substitutions that cause the divergence of gene expression
during species diversification.

Conclusion
All together, a method (and software) are made available
for analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing
shifts in a phylogenetic context and for detecting substitutions responsible for driving such shifts. Given some of
the approximations made (enhancers ignored, minimum
evolution rather than maximum likelihood, asymmetrical
dataset to start with), the method performs surprisingly
well and is a valuable starting point for this type of analy-

sis, as well as being subject to future improvements. Ultimately, it will be valuable in comparative genomics to
compare lineage-specific changes in gene content and in
coding sequences, with changes in gene expression and
alternative splicing to get a fuller picture of evolution.
