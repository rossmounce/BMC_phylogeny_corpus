Abstract
Background: Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) causes extensive crop damage throughout the world by feeding directly on
plants and by vectoring hundreds of species of begomoviruses. Yet little is understood about its genes involved in
development, insecticide resistance, host range plasticity and virus transmission.
Results: To facilitate research on whitefly, we present a method for de novo assembly of whitefly transcriptome using
short read sequencing technology (Illumina). In a single run, we produced more than 43 million sequencing reads.
These reads were assembled into 168,900 unique sequences (mean size = 266 bp) which represent more than 10-fold
of all the whitefly sequences deposited in the GenBank (as of March 2010). Based on similarity search with known
proteins, these analyses identified 27,290 sequences with a cut-off E-value above 10-5. Assembled sequences were
annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology and clusters of orthologous group terms. In addition, we
investigated the transcriptome changes during whitefly development using a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE)
system. We obtained a sequencing depth of over 2.5 million tags per sample and identified a large number of genes
associated with specific developmental stages and insecticide resistance.
Conclusion: Our data provides the most comprehensive sequence resource available for whitefly study and
demonstrates that the Illumina sequencing allows de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis in a
species lacking genome information. We anticipate that next generation sequencing technologies hold great potential
for the study of the transcriptome in other non-model organisms.
Background
The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is a genetically
diverse complex containing some of the most destructive
invasive pests of many ornamental and glasshouse crops
worldwide [1,2]. The species complex colonizes more
than 600 different species of plants, transmits many plant
viruses, feeds on phloem sap, and promotes the growth of
damaging fungi on honeydew excretions deposited on
plants [3-6]. Recent phylogenetic analysis combined with
a pattern of reproductive isolation among genetic groups
within B. tabaci indicate that the complex contains at
least 24 cryptic species, some of which have been referred
to as "biotypes" in the last 20 years [7,8]. As the separa* Correspondence: xwwang@zju.edu.cn, shshliu@zju.edu.cn

tion at the species level within the B. tabaci complex is
yet to be fully resolved, we have retained the commonly
used term "biotype" to link this study with existing literature. The most predominant and damaging biotypes of B.
tabaci are the B and Q biotypes [9,10]. While the former
is known for its high fitness parameters, the Q biotype
whitefly has a unique ability to develop and maintain high
levels of resistance to major classes of insecticides owing
to biological and genetic factors [11,12].
Despite its global importance, genomic sequence
resources available for the whitefly are scarce, especially
for the Q biotype. Currently (March 30th, 2010), there are
about 9110 EST and 762 nucleotide sequences available
on NCBI for the B biotype whitefly, and only 683 nucleotide sequences have been deposited for the Q biotype
whitefly. The previous EST sequencing efforts for the B
biotype whitefly have allowed the development of smallscale microarrays for gene expression analysis in the con-

text of insecticide resistance and parasitoid-whitefly
interactions [13-15]. While these studies have highlighted
the utility of cDNA sequencing for candidate gene discovery in the absence of a genome sequence, a comprehensive description of the genes expressed in insecticideresistant Q biotype whitefly remains unavailable.
Over the past several years, the next generation
sequencing technology has emerged as a cutting edge
approach for high-throughput sequence determination
and this has dramatically improved the efficiency and
speed of gene discovery [16,17]. For example, the Illumina sequencing technology is able to generate over one
billion bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run at
less than 1% of the cost of capillary-based methods [18].
Furthermore, this next generation sequencing has also
significantly accelerated and improved the sensitivity of
gene-expression profiling and, is expected to boost collaborative and comparative genomics studies [19,20]. Previously, Illumina sequencing of transcriptomes for
organisms with completed genomes confirmed that the
relatively short reads produced can be effectively assembled and used for gene discovery and comparison of gene
expression profiles [21,22]. Despite its obvious potential,
next generation sequencing methods have not yet been
applied to whitefly research.
In this study, we generated over three billion bases of
high-quality DNA sequence with Illumina technology
and demonstrated the suitability of short-read sequencing for de novo assembly and annotation of genes
expressed in a eukaryote without the prior genome information. In a single run, we identified 168,900 distinct
sequences including hundreds of insecticide target and
metabolism genes. Furthermore, we compared the gene
expression profiles of whiteflies during different developmental stages using a digital gene expression system. The
assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences and gene
expression profiles provide an invaluable resource for the
identification of whitefly genes involved in insecticide
resistance, development and virus transmission.

Results and discussion
Illumina sequencing and reads assembly

To obtain an overview of the whitefly gene expression
profile at different developmental stages, a cDNA sample
was prepared from whitefly eggs, nymphs, pupae and
adults and sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform. After cleaning and quality checks, we obtained 43
million of 75 bp reads from one plate (8 lanes) of
sequencing. To facilitate sequence assembly, these raw
reads were randomly clipped into 21-mers for sequence
assembly using SOAPdenovo software [23]. These short
21-mers were assembled, resulting in 4,274,766 contigs
(Table 1). The mean contig size was 40 bp with lengths
ranging from as small as 22 bp to as large as 2,189 bp. The

size distribution of these contigs is shown in Additional
file 1. Using paired-end joining and gap-filling, the contigs were further assembled into 170,115 scaffolds with a
mean size of 266 bp including 4,588 scaffolds larger than
1,000 bp (Table 1). After clustering using TGICL software
[24], the 170,115 scaffolds generated 168,900 distinct
sequences with 1,206 clusters (mean size: 372 bp) and
167,694 singletons (mean size: 265 bp) (Table 1). In this
manuscript, the singleton means a scaffold that matches
no other scaffolds and the distinct sequences include all
the clusters and singletons generated from scaffolds. The
size distribution of these distinct sequences is shown in
Additional file 1. To demonstrate the quality of sequencing data, we randomly selected 6 singletons and designed
6 pairs of primers for RT-PCR amplification. In this analysis, 5 out of 6 primer pairs resulted in a band of the
expected size and the identity of all five PCR products
were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (data not shown).
Annotation of predicted proteins

For annotation, distinct gene sequences were first
searched using BLASTx against the non-redundant (nr)
NCBI nucleotide database using a cut-off E-value of 10-5.
Using this approach, 27,290 genes (16.2% of all distinct
sequences) returned an above cut-off BLAST result (see
Additional file 2). Because of the relatively short length of
distinct gene sequences (mean size of 266 bp) and lack of
genome information in whitefly, most of the 168,900
assembled sequences could not be matched to known
genes (83.8%). Figure 1 indicates that the proportion of
sequences with matches in nr databases is greater among
the longer assembled sequences. Specifically, a 97% of
match efficiency was observed for sequences longer than
2,000 bp, whereas the match efficiency decreased to
about 48% for those ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp and to
11.5% for sequences between 100 to 500 bp (Figure 1).
The E-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database
showed that 22% of the mapped sequences have strong

GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the
predicted Q biotype whitefly genes. Based on sequence
homology, 7,330 sequences can be categorized into 52
functional groups (Figure 3). In each of the three main
categories (biological process, cellular component and
molecular function) of the GO classification, 'Cellular
process', "Cell part" and "Binding" terms are dominant
respectively; however, we did not find any genes in the
clusters of 'Symplast', 'Chemoattractant' and 'Chemorepellent'. We also noticed a high-percentage of genes from
categories of 'Metabolic process', 'Catalytic' and 'Pigmentation' and only a few genes from terms of 'Cell killing'
and 'Nutrient reservoir' (Figure 3). To further evaluate the
completeness of our transcriptome library and the effectiveness of our annotation process, we searched the
annotated sequences for the genes involved in COG classifications. In total, out of 27,290 nr hits, 7,790 sequences
have a COG classification (Figure 4). Among the 25 COG
categories, the cluster for 'General function prediction'
represents the largest group (1778, 22.8%) followed by
'Replication, recombination and repair' (897, 11.5%) and
'Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis' (842,
10.8%). The following categories: extracellular structures
(2, 0.025%); nuclear structure (8, 0.1%) and cell motility
(22, 0.28%), represent the smallest groups (Figure 4). To
identify the biological pathways that are active in the Q
biotype whitefly, we mapped the 27,290 annotated
sequences to the reference canonical pathways in Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [25]. In
total, we assigned 11,104 sequences to 214 KEGG pathways. The pathways with most representation by the
unique sequences were starch and sucrose metabolism
(553 members); purine metabolism (458 members) and
galactose metabolism (183 members). These annotations
provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways during whitefly research.
Detection of sequences related to the insecticide targets
and metabolism

As the Q biotype whitefly is highly resistant to insecticides, we analyzed the sequences related to insecticide
targets and metabolism and compared our data with
sequences from NCBI nucleotides and EST database [13].
As shown in Table 2, we identified a number of sequences
which are homologous to enzymes related to insecticide

metabolic resistance, such as carboxylesterase and glutathione S-transferase; and insecticide targets, such as acetylcholinesterase, GABA receptor and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor. Among them, the GABA receptor
sequences were identified from the whitefly for the first
time. In total, we obtained 28 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor related sequences. After removing redundant
sequences, we identified 9 different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (Table 3). As an insect genome
generally has 10 to 11 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subunits [26], our database represents a nearly complete
collection of such genes in whitefly. This finding further
demonstrates the quality of our sequencing data and will
certainly facilitate Q biotype whitefly insecticide resistance research. It was previously observed that the resistance to organophosphates in the B biotype B. tabaci was
associated with a point mutation (Phe392Trp) in ace1type acetylcholinesterase [27]. Therefore, we compared
the protein sequence of the Q biotype whitefly ace1-type
acetylcholinesterase with that of the B biotype. Sequence
alignment shows that the Q biotype whitefly acetylcholinesterase also contains the Phe392Trp mutation (data
not shown). Furthermore, three additional mutations
were observed in the N-terminal region of the Q biotype
whitefly ace1-type acetylcholinesterase (Additional file 3)
which might confer further organophosphate resistance.

However, the relevance of these additional mutations
requires further investigation.
Digital gene expression (DGE) library sequencing

An immediate application of our transcriptome sequence
data includes gene expression profiling under different
physiological conditions. Using the DGE method, which
generates absolute rather than relative gene expression
measurements and avoids many of the inherent limitations of microarray analysis, we analyzed the gene expression variations during whitefly development. We
sequenced three DGE libraries: egg & nymph, pupa and
adult, and generated between 2.8 and 3.9 million raw tags
for each of the three samples (Table 4). After removing
the low quality reads, the total number of tags per library
ranged from 2.7 to 3.8 million and the number of tag entities with unique nucleotide sequences ranged from
84,583 to 134,042 (Table 4). For mRNA expression, heterogeneity and redundancy are two significant characteristics. While the majority of mRNA is expressed at low
levels, a small proportion of mRNA is highly expressed.
Therefore, the distribution of tag expression was used to
evaluate the normality of the DGE data. As shown in Figure 5, the distribution of total tags and distinct tags over
different tag abundance categories showed similar patterns for all three DGE libraries. However, under the dis-

tribution of total tags, high-expression tags with copy
numbers larger than 100 are in absolute dominance
whereas low-expression tags with copy numbers smaller
than 10 occupy the majority of distinct tag distributions
(Figure 5). To evaluate the reproducibility of DGE library
sequencing, we performed Pearson correlation analysis
for pupa vs. adult and egg & nymph vs. pupa (Additional
file 4). Pearson correlations for the parallel libraries were
0.96 and 0.99 respectively, indicating the reliability of our
experimental results as well as operational stability.
Mapping sequences to the reference transcriptome
database

To reveal the molecular events behind DGE profiles, we
mapped the tag sequences of the three DGE libraries to
our transcriptome reference database generated in the
above-mentioned Illumina sequencing. This reference
database contains 168,900 distinct sequences with
159,671 unambiguous reference tags. Among the 84,583
to 134,042 distinct tags generated from the Illumina
sequencing of the three libraries, 46,049 to 73,555 distinct
tags were mapped to a gene in the reference database
(Table 4). Tags mapped to a unique sequence are the most
critical subset of the DGE libraries as they can explicitly
identify a transcript. Up to 22.82% (38,548) of the
sequences in our transcriptome reference tag database
could be unequivocally identified by unique tag (Table 4).

To confirm whether the number of detected genes
increases proportionally to sequencing amount (total tag
number), a saturation analysis was performed. Additional
file 5 shows a trend of saturation where the number of
detected genes almost ceases to increase when the number of reads reaches 2 million. Next, the level of gene
expression was determined by calculating the number of
unambiguous tags for each gene and then normalizing
this to the number of transcripts per million tags (TPM).
As summarized in Figure 6, the results show that mRNA
transcribed from the major kinds of genes is represented
in fewer than ten copies and only a small proportion of
genes are highly expressed. In the Additional file 6, we
have listed the top 20 most abundantly expressed genes
from adult whiteflies. While analyzing the five most
abundantly expressed genes with annotation, we noticed
the presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, translation elongation factor 2, cytochrome P450
CYP6CX1v2 and tubulin alpha chain in all the three
libraries.
Distribution of DGE tags on genes

DGE is a SAGE-based transcript profiling method. In
theory, all the sequenced tags in the libraries should be
mapped to the last NlaIII restriction site on the sense
strand at the 3'-end of the transcript. However, like the
results in DGE analysis of mouse and zebrafish transcrip-

tomes [20,22], we found that approximately 60% of the
tags mapped to the classical site (data not shown). This is
probably due to the incomplete NlaIII digestion during
library preparation and the usage of alternative polyadenylation and/or splicing sites [28]. Detection of multiple
tags with high count numbers for a predicted transcript
indicates the reliability of the transcript sequence [22].
Furthermore, the information obtained from multiple
tags per transcript is valuable for the verification of ab
initio gene predictions.

Changes in gene expression profile among the different
developmental stages

To identify genes showing a significant change in expression during different developmental stages, the differentially expressed tags between two samples were identified
by an algorithm developed by Audic et al. [29]. A total of
12,257 significantly changed tag entities were detected
between the adult and pupa whitefly libraries. Those tags
were mapped to 3,318 genes with 822 genes up-regulated
and 2,496 genes down-regulated (Figure 7A & Additional
file 7). Between pupa and egg & nymph libraries, a total of
2,197 differentially expressed genes were detected with

roughly the same amount of up-regulated genes (1,123)
and down-regulated genes (1,074) (Additional file 8). This
suggests that the number of differentially expressed genes
between pupa and adult are larger than that between
pupa and egg & nymph. Next we analyzed the top 20
most differentially expressed genes between samples
(pupa vs. egg & nymph; and adult vs. pupa) (Additional
file 9). We found that more than 60% of the highly regulated genes are orphan sequences - no homologues found
in the NCBI database. This might be consistent with the
expectation that Hemiptera development expresses genes
with no homologues in other species.
Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes

To understand the functions of differentially expressed
genes, we mapped all the genes to terms in KEGG database and, compared this with the whole transcriptome
background, with a view to search for genes involved in
metabolic or signal transduction pathways that were significantly enriched. Among all the genes with KEGG
pathway annotation, 284 differentially expressed genes
were identified between pupa and egg & nymph libraries.
Notably, specific enrichment of genes was observed for
pathways involved in energy and lipid metabolism, such
as the citrate cycle, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and
fatty acid metabolism. In the citrate cycle pathway, all the
differentially expressed genes were significantly upregulated in pupa, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and citrate
synthase. This probably indicates that the metabolic rate
of whitefly at pupa stage is higher than that of whitefly at
egg & nymph stages. Between adult and pupa stages, a
total of 514 differentially expressed genes were found and
a specific enrichment of starch and sucrose metabolism
pathways was noticed. Interestingly, we also found the
enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. To further evaluate
our DGE data, we analyzed the expression level of vitello-

genin which is an egg yolk gene highly expressed in the
adult female [30]. As shown in Figure 8A-B, both vitellogenin 1 and vitellogenin 2 were highly expressed in the
adult whitefly. However, both genes were expressed at
significantly lower levels in the pupa stage and only vitellogenin 2 is present during the egg & nymph stage. For
ecdysone receptor and ecdysone-inducible protein E75,
we noticed a much high expression level in nymphs and
pupas than that in adult whitefly (Figure 8C-D). This is
consistent with their roles in the orchestration of development during molts and metamorphosis [31]. As a control, the translation elongation factor 2 is equally
expressed during the three developmental stages (Figure
8E).

Conclusion
With this study, we present a rapid and cost-effective
method for transcriptome and DGE analysis using Illumina sequencing technology. The single run produced
more than 168,900 distinct sequences with 27,290
sequences having an above cut-off BLAST result. These
findings provide a substantial contribution to existing
sequence resources for the whitefly and will certainly
accelerate insecticide resistance research in the Q biotype
whitefly. To our knowledge, this is the first publication
using Illumina sequencing technology for an organism
without prior genome annotation. Additionally, we have
demonstrated the feasibility of using Illumina sequencing
based DGE system for gene expression profiling and have
provided new leads for functional studies of genes
involved in whitefly development.

bers at 27 Â± 1Â°C, a photoperiod of 14 h light:10 h darkness
and 70 Â± 10% relative humidity. The purity of the cultures
was monitored every 3-5 generations using the random
amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction
technique and the sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene, which has been used widely to differentiate whitefly (B. tabaci) "biotypes" [32]. Since the
quantity of eggs is extremely low, a mixture of eggs and
first to third nymphs were collected as one sample. The
pupae were collected as another sample. For adults, individuals were collected from the culture using a glass tube
(5 Ã 0.5 cm) and the sex was determined under a stereo
microscope. Then adults of the same sex were pooled
into a plastic tube using an aspirator. Finally, these samples were frozen at -80Â°C until use.

RNA isolation and library preparation for transcriptome
analysis

Total RNA was isolated using SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA integrity was confirmed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies) with a minimum RNA integrated
number value of 8. The samples for transcriptome analysis were prepared using Illumina's kit following manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, mRNA was purified
from 6 Î¼g of total RNA (a mixture of RNA from egg &
nymph, pupa and adult at equal ratio) using oligo (dT)
magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is
fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under
elevated temperature and the cleaved RNA fragments
were used for first strand cDNA synthesis using reverse

provided the best result for transcriptome assembly.
Small K-mers make the graph very complex; while large
K-mers can have poor overlap in regions with low
sequencing depth. After sequence assembly, the resultant
contigs were joined into scaffolds using the read mate
pairs. To obtained distinct gene sequences, the scaffolds
were clustered using TGI Clustering tools [24]. Distinct
sequences were used for blast search and annotation
against an NCBI nr database using an E-value cut-off of
10-5. Functional annotation by gene ontology terms (GO;
http://www.geneontology.org) was analyzed by Blast2go
software. The COG and KEGG pathways annotation was
performed using Blastall software against Cluster of
Orthologous Groups database and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes database. The data sets are available
at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) with the accession
number: SRX018661. The assembled sequences have
been deposited in the NCBI's TSA database and can be
searched using the Gene-ID listed in Additional file 2.
Digital gene expression library preparation and
sequencing

Tag library preparation for the three Q biotype whitefly
samples (egg & nymph, pupa, and adult) was performed
in parallel using Illumina gene expression sample preparation kit. Briefly, total RNA from the three samples was
used for mRNA capture with magnetic oligo(dT) beads.
First and second strand cDNA were synthesized and
bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with
NlaIII. The cDNA fragments with 3' ends were then purified with magnetic beads and Illumina adapter 1 was
added to their 5' ends. The junction of Illumina adapter 1
and CATG site is the recognition site of MmeI, which
cuts 17 bp downstream of the CATG site, producing tags
with adapter 1. After removing 3' fragments with magnetic beads precipitation, Illumina adapter 2 was introduced at 3' ends of tags, acquiring tags with different
adapters at both ends to form a tag library. After 15 cycles
of linear PCR amplification, 85 base strips were purified
by PAGE gel electrophoresis. These strips were then
digested, and the single-chain molecules were fixed onto
the Illumina sequencing chip for sequencing. The data
sets are available at the NCBI SRA with the accession
number: SRX018662.
Analysis and mapping of DGE tags

Sequencing-received raw image data was transformed by
base calling into sequence data. Prior to mapping reads to
the reference database, we filtered all sequences to
remove adaptor sequence, low quality sequences (tags
with unknown sequences 'N'), empty tags (sequence with
only adaptor sequences but no tags); low complexity, and
tags with a copy number of 1 (probably sequencing
error). A preprocessed database of all possible CATG+17

Page 10 of 11

nucleotide tag sequences was created using our transcriptome reference database. For annotation, all tags were
mapped to the reference sequences and only allowed no
more than 1 nucleotide mismatch. All the tags mapped to
reference sequences from multiple genes were filtered
and the remaining tags were designed as unambiguous
tags. For gene expression analysis, the number of
expressed tags was calculated and then normalized to
TPM (number of transcripts per million tags); and the
differentially expressed tags were used for mapping and
annotation. The complete lists of differentially expressed
genes are shown in Additional file 7 and 8.
Evaluation of DGE libraries

A statistical analysis of the frequency of each tag in the
different cDNA libraries was performed to compare
gene-expression in different developmental stages. Statistical comparison was performed with a custom written
scripts using the method described by Audic et al. [29].
FDR (false discovery rate) was used to determine the
threshold of P value in multiple test and analysis. We
used FDR < 0.001 as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference. For pathway enrichment analysis, we mapped all differentially expressed
genes to terms in KEGG database and looked for significantly enriched KEGG terms compared to the genome
background.
