Abstract
Background: The wild gaur (Bos gaurus) is an endangered wild cattle species. In Vietnam, the total number of wild gaurs
is estimated at a maximum of 500 individuals. Inbreeding and genetic drift are current relevant threats to this small
population size. Therefore, information about the genetic status of the Vietnamese wild gaur population is essential to
develop strategies for conservation and effective long-term management for this species. In the present study, we
performed cross-species amplification of 130 bovine microsatellite markers, in order to evaluate the applicability and
conservation of cattle microsatellite loci in the wild gaur genome. The genetic diversity of Vietnamese wild gaur was also
investigated, based on data collected from the 117 successfully amplified loci.
Results: One hundred-thirty cattle microsatellite markers were tested on a panel of 11 animals. Efficient amplifications
were observed for 117 markers (90%) with a total of 264 alleles, and of these, 68 (58.1%) gave polymorphic band
patterns. The number of alleles per locus among the polymorphic markers ranged from two to six. Thirteen loci
(BM1314, BM2304, BM6017, BMC2228, BMS332, BMS911, CSSM023, ETH123, HAUT14, HEL11, HEL5, ILSTS005 and
INRA189) distributed on nine different cattle chromosomes failed to amplify wild gaur genomic DNA. Three cattle Ychromosome specific microsatellite markers (INRA124, INRA126 and BM861) were also highly specific in wild gaur, only
displaying an amplification product in the males. Genotype data collected from the 117 successfully amplified
microsatellites were used to assess the genetic diversity of this species in Vietnam. Polymorphic Information Content
(PIC) values varied between 0.083 and 0.767 with a mean of 0.252 while observed heterozygosities (Ho) ranged from
0.091 to 0.909 (mean of 0.269). Nei's unbiased mean heterozygosity and the mean allele number across loci were 0.298
and 2.2, respectively.
Conclusion: Extensive conservation of cattle microsatellite loci in the wild gaur genome, as shown by our results,
indicated a high applicability of bovine microsatellites for genetic characterization and population genetic studies of this
species. Moreover, the low genetic diversity observed in Vietnamese wild gaur further underlines the necessity of specific
strategies and appropriate management plans to preserve this endangered species from extinction.

Background
The wild gaur, also known as the Indian bison or seladang, is a member of the subfamily Bovinae and is currently classified among endangered species and listed as
vulnerable by International Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources [1]. According to the Asian
Wild Cattle Conservation Assessment and Management
Plan (CAMP – [2]), three wild subspecies are generally recognized, including Bos gaurus laosiensis (Myanmar to
China), Bos gaurus hubbacki (Thailand and Malaysia) and
Bos gaurus gaurus (India and Nepal). Recently, the species
name Bos gaurus was suggested for wild gaur instead of
Bibos gauris or Bos frontalis by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature [3]; this name is currently used.
The gaur is one of the most impressive and largest of the
wild cattle. A typical adult wild gaur bull may measure up
to two meters at the shoulders and 900 kg in weight [4].
Gaurs are gregarious animals that live in hilly terrains
below an altitude of 1,800 meters in herds ranging from 6
to 40 individuals. The distribution of wild gaur includes
areas of southern and south-eastern Asia, from India to
peninsular Malaysia, occurring in India, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, China, Laos, Cambodia,
Vietnam and Malaysia [5,6]. In India, wild gaurs have
been probably domesticated about 2500 years ago [7],
mainly for work and meat [8]. Domesticated gaurs are
referred to as "gayal" or "mithan" (Bos frontalis) and are
completely interfertile with their wild relatives [9], which
display a karyotype of 2n = 58 [10]. Furthermore, herders
breed mithans or cross them with cattle to obtain offspring with enhanced production and performance, however usually only F1 females are fertile and can be used for
further breeding purposes.
The global population of wild gaur ranges from 13,000 to
30,000 with a population of mature individuals between
5,200 and 18,000. In the last decades, the number of wild
gaurs decreased dramatically due to the loss of suitable
habitat (in favour of agriculture and its domestic counterpart), hunting or hybridization with domestic cattle [11].
The latter threat also caused the transmission and outbreak of various devastating diseases, such as foot-andmouth, rinderpest and anthrax [12]. In Vietnam, the total
number of wild gaurs is estimated at a maximum of 500
individuals of which 10% distributed in the Cat Tien
National Park, localized close to the Ho Chi Minh City in
the south of the country. During 1991–1995, 120 wild
gaurs were reported to be killed (more than one generation [1]). Thus, information about the current genetic status of the Vietnamese wild gaur population is important
and necessary to develop strategies for conservation and
effective long-term management for this species.

Successful amplification and extensive conservation of
cattle microsatellite sequences in several species of Bovidae and Cervidae families have been documented in
numerous works [13,14], thus allowing possible population genetic studies on related Bovidae species for which
microsatellites have not been developed [15-18]. Furthermore, cross-species amplification was also applied to the
study of population variations in geographically isolated
or endangered species [19,20]. These studies suggest that
a characterization of wild gaur, as a member of the subfamily Bovinae, with bovine microsatellite markers is
highly pertinent and suitable.
Previous genetic studies were carried out on gaur [21,22],
however they were limited to a domesticated group of Bos
frontalis and only a low number of cattle microsatellites
were analyzed. Therefore, the questions about the conservation of cattle microsatellite DNA sequences, as well as
the applicability of these markers for population genetic
studies in Bos gaurus remain open.
The principal aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the
applicability and conservation of cattle microsatellite
DNA sequences in the wild gaur genome and (2) to estimate the current genetic status of this species in Vietnam.

Results and discussion
One hundred-thirty cattle microsatellite markers were
tested for amplification of genomic DNA from a panel of
11 wild gaurs. Three Brown Swiss cattles (Bos taurus) were
used as positive control. Although some amplification
failures were observed, 90% of the microsatellites from
cattle could be successfully amplified by PCR on gaur
genomic DNA, of which 68 markers (58.1%) were polymorphic. A total of 264 alleles were detected across the
117 amplified loci with the number of alleles ranging
from one to six (Table 1) with a mean of 2.2 alleles per
locus. Thirteen microsatellites (10%) distributed on cattle
chromosomes 8 (BM2304), 10 (ILSTS005), 18 (HAUT14),
21 (HEL5), 24 (CSSM023), 26 (BM1314, BMS332 and
HEL11), 29 (BMC2228), X (BM6017, BMS911 and
ETH123) and Y (INRA189), respectively, failed to amplify
in wild gaur. Notably, the non-amplification of locus
ILSTS005 indicated the absence of this sequence in both
wild gaur and mithan [22]. As expected, all the microsatellite markers could be successfully amplified in the positive control samples (Bos taurus), with 92% of them being
polymorphic.
The applicability of bovine microsatellite markers for
genetic studies in several Bovidae species has been
reported in different studies and demonstrated extensive
genomic conservation of cattle DNA microsatellite
sequences during evolution. However, this conservation
varies consistently within the Bovidae subfamilies and

species (Table 2), as one can also expect by phylogenetic
analyses. Additionally, percentage variations of conserved
and polymorphic loci also depend on experimental conditions; specifically the number and the identity of the
specific set of markers, as well as the number of animals
tested play essential roles. This explains the variable levels
of marker conservation in water buffalo, goat and sheep
obtained from different studies (see Table 2 for references). The average conservation of cattle microsatellite
loci across Caprinae species was generally lower than for
Bovinae; in fact goat [23] and sheep [13] showed the lowest among all Bovidae. However, these results do not completely account for the experimental differences discussed
above, which might influence the finding. With the same
set of cattle microsatellites used in this study, our data suggest that Bos indicus is more closely related to Bos taurus
than either Bos gaurus, Poephagus grunniens or Pseudoryx
nghetinhensis (Table 2 and references therein). Within the

Bovini, a close relationship between wild gaur and banteng (Bos javanicus) could be expected, as 90% and 94% of
cattle microsatellites were conserved in their genomes,
respectively (Table 2). These results were in line with
recent taxonomy classifications of Bovidae based on
molecular phylogenetic analyses [24,25] and AFLP data
[26]. Additionally, genomic conservation of cattle microsatellites has been tested on Cervidae, whereas 73.7% and
74.1% of bovine markers could be successfully amplified
in sika deer (Cervus nippon) and red deer (Cervus elaphus),
respectively [14]. Within species of Bos, wild gaur showed
the lowest proportion of polymorphic markers (Table 2).
This finding was in agreement and is possibly related to
the small effective population size of Vietnamese wild
gaurs, compared to other bovid species. The average allele
sizes of most successful amplified markers in wild gaur
were smaller compared to those obtained in cattle. This

was expected [27] and in agreement with previous studies
using cross-species amplification [15,17].
The conservation of DNA sequences flanking microsatellites in the sex chromosomes among cattle and wild gaur
was evaluated by testing the amplification of nine microsatellite loci, which mapped to BTAX (BM6017,
BMC6021, BMS1616, BMS631, BMS911, ETH123,
ILSTS017, XBM11 and XBM7) and four additional loci
(INRA124, INRA126, INRA189 and BM861), which
mapped to BTAY. All these sex-specific microsatellite
markers were monomorphic. The loci BM6017, BMS911,
ETH123 and INRA189 failed to amplify sex-chromosome
specific DNA in wild gaur. Recently, it has also been
reported that locus BM6017 could not be amplified in
yaks [18]. This could be attributed to the absence of
homologous sequences in both species. Moreover, studies
demonstrated that BM861 and INRA126 successfully
amplified from both sexes in yak [18,21] and saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis – [20]), suggesting that they are not Yspecific. These findings indicated that yak and saola X
chromosome retained a homologous segment of the Y
chromosome, which contains both BM861 and INRA126
microsatellite markers. Contrary to these studies, we
could amplify INRA124, INRA126 and BM861 only in
male wild gaurs, indicating that they are Y specific markers
in this species. Hanotte et al. [28] also tried to amplify
locus INRA124 in two males of mithan but failed to
obtain an amplification product. Even though we could
not find any polymorphism for INRA124, INRA126 and
BM861, these three microsatellites were polymorphic in
several bovid species, including domestic cattle, bison,
mithan, swamp buffalo and yak [21,28]. This may be due
to the relative small number (7) of male wild gaurs analyzed, which may have limited the informative content of
this marker. In addition, the significant difference in allele
size of locus BM861 between wild (135 bp) and domestic
gaur (mithan, 150–156 bp -[21]) might be explained by
the introgressive hybridisation of mithan, leading to the
loss of the 135 bp allele from its wild ancestor.
Finally, genotype data collected from the 117 successfully
amplified microsatellites were used for genetic studies of
the Vietnamese wild gaur population. The expected heterozygosity value per locus across the population varied
between 0.091 (BL1029, BMS1128 and BMS424B) and
0.835 (BMS1120) (Table 1). Accordingly, markers
BL1029, BMS1128 and BMS424B showed the lowest PIC
value (0.083), whereas BMS1120 had the highest (0.767)
with a mean of 0.252. In addition, the observed heterozygosities (Ho) ranged from 0.091 to 0.909. Twenty-eight
microsatellites (BL1071, BM6425, BMC1410, BMS1120,
BMS1355, BMS1857, BMS1928, BMS2252, BMS2526,
BMS4015, CSSM66, ETH11, ETH225, ETH3, HEL1, HEL9,
INRA005, INRA023, INRA032, INRA037, INRA063,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/77

INRA121, MB085, MHCII, TEXAN10, TGLA179, TGLA53
and TGLA73; bold-faced in Table 1) showed good level of
informativeness, having a PIC value higher than the
threshold of 0.5 that is considered the value from which
markers begin to be informative and therefore they would
be the most suitable for diversity studies. Among these 28
most informative microsatellites, ten (CSSM66, ETH225,
ETH3, HEL1, HEL9, INRA023, INRA032, INRA037,
INRA063 and TGLA53) are also in the FAO standard panel
of 30 microsatellites for diversity studies, allowing the
study of introgression.
The average observed heterozygosity value (Ho = 0.269)
was lower than the average expected heterozygosity (Nei's
unbiased mean heterozygosity; HE = 0.298) and this difference was statistically significant. Eleven (BM4602,
BMS1322, BMS1353, BMS1926, ILSTS006, INRA037,
INRA063, MHCII, TEXAN10, TGLA126 and TGLA73) out
of 117 loci (9.4%) showed significant deviation from the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at p < 0.05. Over all loci,
departure from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001), reflecting the deviation in the direction of heterozygote deficit. These results
indicate a frequent portion of homozygous individuals in
the Vietnamese wild gaur population, resulting in an
inbreeding coefficient value [F = (HE - Ho)/HE] of 0.10.
Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the population studied might be the results of inbreeding, but
could also have been caused by the presence of nonamplifying (null) alleles, which could have contributed to
the heterozygote deficiencies. In addition, the low average
heterozygosity of wild gaurs may also be the consequence
of the use of cattle derived microsatellite markers, which
are expected to perform less in related species, having a
higher fraction of null alleles and being less polymorphic.

Conclusion
The degree of polymorphism in the high number of microsatellite markers tested provides important information
about the current genetic status of Vietnamese wild gaur.
Its small population size would be dramatically adversely
affected by high inbreeding and genetic drift. Therefore,
the use of cattle microsatellites is adequate and recommended for further population genetic analyses, aimed to
develop effective long-term conservation plans and strategies for this threatened species in Asia, especially in Vietnam. The reported low level of genetic diversity in wild
gaur possibly reflects a bottleneck effect following the dramatic population reduction that occurred in this country
during 1991–1995.

Methods
Sample collection
Eleven wild gaur samples (7 males and 4 females) were
randomly collected in South Vietnam from the Chu Mom

Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples, fibroblast cells and bone fragments following standard methods
[29,30] with minor modifications. DNA from three
Brown Swiss cattles (Bos taurus) was obtained from EDTAanticoagulated whole blood [31] and used as positive
control.

Microsatellite analysis
The same set of 130 bovine microsatellite markers analyzed by Nguyen et al. [18], excluded BPLP, and distributed across the entire cattle genome (Table 1) was tested
for PCR amplification on wild gaur genomic DNA. The
primer pairs, which show extensive polymorphism in cattle, were selected from internet sites [32-34]. The forward
primer of each microsatellite was 5'-labeled with either
FAM, JOE, TAMRA, HEX or TET fluorescent tag. PCR
amplification was carried out, as described by Nguyen et
al. [18], in a total reaction volume of 25 µl containing 20–
30 ng DNA template, 1× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2), 1.25 mM of dNTP mix,
20 µM of each primer and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase
(SIGMA, Buchs, Switzerland). Samples were cycled in a
PCR Express Machine (Thermocycler PCR Express,
Hybaid) at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C
for 30 s, 52–60°C annealing temperature (depending on
the microsatellite used) for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. The
final elongation was at 72°C for 7 min. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a 377 ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with Genescan-350
TAMRA or ROX as internal standards. Fragment sizing and
analysis were done using ABI 672 Genescan software and
Genotyper (version 2.1) software (Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analysis
Genotypes were assigned for each individual based on
allele size data. Allele frequencies, expected heterozygosity (HE = 1 - ∑ Pi2, where Pi = frequency of allele i),
observed heterozygosity (Ho) for all loci were computed
using the Microsatellite Toolkit version 3.1 [35]. Genetic
diversity was estimated according to Nei [36], using the
average heterozygosity across all loci. Probability tests of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [37] based on Markov chain
approaches (5000 iterations) were performed using the
GENEPOP package version 3.4 [38]. The polymorphism
information content (PIC) was calculated using the following formula:

PIC = 1 −
