Abstract
Background: MLVA (multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis) is a reliable typing
technique introduced recently to differentiate also isolates of Enterococcus faecium. We used the
established VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) scheme to test its suitability to differentiate
58 E. faecium isolates representing mainly outbreaks and clusters of infections and colonizations
among patients from 31 German hospitals. All isolates were vancomycin-resistant (vanA type).
Typing results for MLVA are compared with results of macrorestriction analysis in PFGE (pulsedfield gel electrophoresis) and MLST (multi-locus sequence typing).
Results: All 51 but one hospital isolates from 1996–2006 were assigned to the clonal complex
(CC) of epidemic-virulent, hospital-adapted lineages (MLST CC-17; MLVA CC-1) and differed from
isolates of sporadic infections and colonizations (n = 7; 1991–1995) and other non-hospital origins
(n = 27). Typing of all 58 hospital VRE revealed MLVA as the least discriminatory method
(Simpson's diversity index 0.847) when compared to MLST (0.911) and PFGE (0.976). The two
most common MLVA types MT-1 (n = 16) and MT-159 (n = 14) combined isolates of several MLST
types including also major epidemic, hospital-adapted, clonal types (MT-1: ST-17, ST-18, ST-280,
ST-282; MT-159: ST-78, ST-192, ST-203). These data clearly indicate that non-related E. faecium
could possess an identical MLVA type being especially critical when MLVA is used to elucidate
supposed outbreaks with E. faecium within a single or among different hospitals. Stability of a given
MLVA profile MT-12 (ST-117) during an outbreak over a period of five years was also shown.
Conclusion: MLVA is a suitable method to assign isolates of E. faecium into distinct clonal
complexes. To investigate outbreaks the current MLVA typing scheme for E. faecium does not
discriminate enough and cannot be recommended as a standard superior to PFGE.

Background
Effective typing of microorganisms is a prerequisite for
establishing epidemiological or phylogenetic links
between corresponding isolates. A plethora of different
methods has been successfully applied to type and differ-

entiate bacterial strains and clonal groups from each other
[1]. A critical point to all of these methods is their applicability to answer distinct questions ranging from investigation of outbreaks to establishing rather broad
phylogenetic trees of relatedness and arrangement of

strains within major clonal complexes. Each method has
its respective weaknesses and strengths according to the
question(s) addressed and the methodology behind [2-7].
Recently, a new method was introduced using small repetitive elements appearing in a variable number and distributed among the genome of a given species. Accordingly
this technique based on a variable number of tandem
repeats (VNTR) was named multiple-locus variablenumber tandem repeat analysis (MLVA; [8]). Initially
MLVA was established to differentiate high-risk pathogens
such as Bacillus anthracis and Francisella tularensis [9-11]
but has been extended to a numerous number of other
bacterial species and scientific questions [8,12] including
outbreak investigations for pathogenic bacteria [4,13].
MLVA was applied also recently to type isolates of Enterococcus spp. Its discriminatory power was compared to
MLST for a collection of 392 E. faecium [14] and to macrorestriction analysis in PFGE for 83 E. faecalis [15]. In
both cases it was described that MLVA showed similar and
rather concordant discrimination when compared to the
respective reference method. Although the selected VNTRs
were different between the two species, the overall conclusion would suggest MLVA as a typing method on one
hand to discriminate highly enough between strains and
on the other hand indicate the possibility to establish
rather broad phylogenetic relatednesses. To support this
hypotheses and to test the applicability of the established
MLVA scheme for E. faecium to indicate and differentiate
hospital-adapted clonal types appearing in increasing
numbers among hospital patients worldwide [16], we
investigated hospital isolates representing outbreaks and
clusters of infections and colonizations from German
hospital patients from the last 15 years using MLVA, SmaImacrorestriction analysis in PFGE, and MLST. A collection
of 27 E. faecium from commensal, animal, and environmental origins was included for reasons of comparison
and also typed by MLVA.

demic and hospital-adapted clonal types (Table 1). Isolate
UW6520 revealed ST-314 which belongs to MLST cluster
C and not to cluster C1/CC17. Isolates of group I (1991–
1995) were quite diverse; only three possessed a MLST
type belonging to MLST CC17 (ST-17), the other four
were attributed to three different clonal complexes.
MLVA
Altogether 14 MLVA types were assigned. All 51 group II
and III isolates possessed MLVA types associated with
clonal complex C1 of hospital-adapted types (Table 1).
Cluster assignments of new MLVA types were done by the
curator of the MLVA internet pages (J. Top, University
Utrecht, Netherlands) based on pairwise similarities,
UPMGA clustering and similarities within a minimum
spanning tree of relatedness. Four group I VRE belonged
to MLVA clonal complex C1, the other three each one to
A, B or C (Table 1, see also [14]). The 27 isolates of different non-hospital origins showed ten MLVA types. All but
two belonged to MLVA clonal complexes A or B (J. Top,
pers. communication). Main type was MT-89 (n = 9; CCA). Six isolates were none-typeable due to an incapability
of an amplification of one of the six VNTR fragments.
Concordance of PFGE, MLVA and MLST results
Altogether 58 hospital VRE (groups I – III) were typed by
all three molecular typing methods. SmaI-macrorestriction in PFGE revealed 38, MLST 19, and MLVA 14 different types. PFGE was the most discriminatory method with
a discriminatory index of 0.972, MLST the median (0.91)
and MLVA the least discriminatory (0.842) (Table 2). Differences in discriminatory power between those different
typing methods are even more obvious and pronounced
when results involving only outbreak isolates of groups II
and III are compared (PFGE: 0.965; MLST: 0.891; MLVA:
0.814). MLVA appears in all cases as the least discriminatory method which derives from the fact that (i) it
revealed the least number of different types and in addition, (ii) more than half of all the investigated VRE belong
to only two types MT-1 and MT-159.

Results
Macrorestriction analysis in PFGE
Altogether 58 E. faecium were investigated by SmaI-macrorestriction analysis originating from 31 German hospitals. Thirty-eight different PFGE types were assigned based
on a 90 % similarity cut-off and recommendations
described recently [17,18]. However, larger clusters of
strains possessing at least related patterns (> 80 % identity) could be identified ([18]; see below and Fig. 1).
MLST
Altogether 19 MLST types were assigned. All but one hospital-adapted/outbreak isolates (n = 50/51) of groups II
(1996–1999) and III (2004–2006) possessed MLST types
(ST) which belong to MLST CC-17 or C1 representing epi-

Some isolates with identical MLVA types showed different
MLST types (Table 1; Fig. 2). But also the opposite was
found; isolates with identical MLST types could possess
different MLVA types (Table 1; Fig. 2). Isolates harboring
the two major MLVA types, MT-1 and MT-159, combine
isolates showing a various number of STs. E.g., MT-159
isolates combine E. faecium of ST-78, -192, -203, and 283. MT-1 isolates combine E. faecium of ST-17, ST-18, ST280, and ST-282.
Results of MLST partly confirm cluster assignments based
on PFGE data, whereas our data did not show a visible
concordance between MLVA and PFGE (Fig. 1). Many
MLVA types were distributed among different main PFGE

Cluster analysis of hospital VRE based on SmaI-macrorestriction patterns resolved in PFGE (see also Tab. 1). The
dendrogram was evaluated using Dice coefficient and UPMGA clustering (BioNumercis software). Legend: Groups – group I

% identity; see also [30])
clusters. Especially the most common types such as MT-1
(n = 16) and MT-159 (n = 14) were evenly distributed
among different major PFGE branches. This fact is also
reflected in the much lower concordance value for results
of MLVA/PFGE (0.863) compared to MLST/PFGE (0.935;
Table 2). Eight of nine ST-203 isolates cluster in a group
of related PFGE patterns (> 83 % identity) together with
two ST-282 VRE (ST-282 is a double-locus variant [DLV]

of ST-203). A single ST-203 isolate clusters in a side
branch but at least within a cluster of > 75 % identity.
These eleven isolates possess three different MLVA types.
All eleven ST-18 E. faecium cluster in a group with > 70 %
identical patterns. However, also two ST-78 and a single
ST-17 isolates belong to this cluster but are located at both
edges of this branch. These altogether 14 VRE possess four

MLVA types. In contrast to this, isolates of ST-17 appear
distributed among different branches of the PFGE tree.
The eight group II isolates all possess an identical MLST
(ST-117) and MLVA (MT-12) type and an identical or
highly related PFGE pattern (> 95 % identity; only shown
for five isolates). Isolate UW6605 (ST-78) revealed also
MT-12 but is clearly different from group II isolates when
compared on the basis of its PFGE pattern. However, ST117 and ST-78 might be phylogenetically related since
both MLST types only differ in a single locus.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/28

A collection of isolates from a single hospital may not be
diverse enough to elucidate the non-congruencies we
found here between some MLVA and MLST types (e.g.,
MT-159 absent in [20]). The discriminatory power of
MLVA in strains recovered from patients at the University
Hospital in general, i.e. not only associated with the
described outbreaks, revealed a Simpson's diversity index
of 0.846 [20] and was almost identical to what we calculated for our study population (0.842).

MLVA was introduced to molecular bacterial strain typing
as a promising alternative to established typing standard
methods such as AFLP, MLST and partly PFGE or as an
alternative for microorganisms where other common typing techniques could not be applied due to several reasons
[19]. Therefore it was not possible in all cases to compare
its discriminatory power to established standards which is
expected to vary also from genus to genus. For nosocomial
pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, MLVA was introduced as an alternative typing method showing matching
results with macrorestriction typing in PFGE and clusters
generated by spa-typing and MLST [4]. For E. faecium discriminatory power of MLVA was compared to MLST and
AFLP (Amplified fragment length polymorphism) and
found to be reliably sufficient as a suitable typing alternative [14]. But already when comparing data from its original description in detail, some uncertainties emerged
challenging the overall applicability of this method for
typing in general including especially investigation of outbreaks or following routes of disseminated outbreak
strains. For instance, MT-1 combined 58 isolates represented by eleven STs [14]. Since MT-1 is the primary
founder and one of the major MLVA types representing
the cluster of hospital-adapted, clonal types (MLVA C1)
its applicability to investigate single outbreak situations
could be questioned. Indeed, this was one of the results of
our study: Isolates representing several MTs such as the
most common MT-1 and MT-159 neither cluster based on
their SmaI-macrorestriction patterns in PFGE nor possess
all identical or related MLST types (Fig. 1 and 2).

Clonal types might be affected by genomic rearrangements to a different extent. Whereas ST-18 or ST-203 isolates showed rather similar SmaI-macrorestriction
patterns over time and geographical distribution, isolates
of ST-17 were rather diverse. The ST-17 isolates were distributed among several subclusters or represent single
PFGE patterns (Fig. 1). It could be speculated if isolates of
ST-17 represent a rather ancient clonal type prone to
recombination and thus divergent PFGE patterns for a
longer time than ST-203 and ST-18 which could constitute
rather recent hospital-adapted clones. Investigation of ST17 from the early 1990ies as shown in our small collection of group I isolates and in a collection of bacteremia
isolates from the mid to the late 1990ies (Werner, unpublished results) supports this hypothesis. The role of
mobile and conjugative elements in rearranging bacterial
genomes is well-known [21]. The genome sequence of E.
faecalis V583 revealed one of the highest numbers of
mobile, integrative and conjugative elements known so
far from the bacterial world [22]. Similar numbers are suggested for E. faecium, however whole genome data for E.
faecium are still incomplete. Recent comparative genomic
hybridizations for a set of 97 E. faecium from different origins confirm the role of mobile and conjugative elements
for shaping the E. faecium genome [23]. IS element driven
recombination appeared higher in a subset of evolutionary linked epidemic E. faecium than in non-epidemic E.
faecium (based on a comparison of typing results for MLST
and PFGE). In this respect PFGE may be "overdiscriminatory" to a certain extent when applied to investigate socalled hospital clade or epidemic E. faecium [23]. Other
factors and impacts that affect distinct clonal types in a
different manner could also be discussed [24,25].

As shown by our results, discrimination of E. faecium
based on results of MLVA, MLST and PFGE does not
always give concordant results as it was shown for rather
clonal populations such as S. aureus [7] or for an analysis
of E. faecium within a single hospital over a period of five
years [20]. Concerning the latter a more detailed comparison of the results of Abele-Horn et al., and ours may be
required. These, at the first moment rather contradictory
results reflect major differences in the used strain collection (strains from a single hospital vs. 31 hospitals) and
correspondingly resulting MLVA and MLST type diversity.

Clearly, MLVA has its advantages when applied to type E.
faecium. It is a suitable method to identify strains belonging to the complex of hospital-adapted, epidemic clones
(MLVA CC-1). The method is quick (intra-day results),
easy to perform, comparably cheap, with excellent reproducibility (intra- and inter-laboratory) and allows data
transfer and comparison. The comparably long repeat
lengths of the VNTR loci used to type E. faecium make the
assay suitable for agarose gel separation and therefore
capable for many standard laboratories. Introduction of
fluorescence-labelled primers in future may lead to a com-

bined approach of six single reactions into one or two
multiplex PCRs [26].
However, the advantage of comparably long repeat
lengths may lead to an unintentional side-effect. MLVA
was primarily established as a typing method to differentiate between strains. The VNTR repeats are, in general,
very short and in a range of 6 to 30 bp [11,12,27]. The idea
behind MLVA typing is mainly based on errors caused by
the DNA polymerase resulting in slippage and/or recombination in a somehow expectable manner within these
sequences. It could be speculated if repeat lengths of the
sizes used to type isolates of E. faecium (120 – 279 bp)
may be too long to let these events appear in an essential
frequency. So differences between strains would be less
detected and the identified changes would only be suitable to establish phylogenetic links between strain types
similar to or even less discriminatory than MLST. Indeed,
some VNTR fragments showed length of incomplete
repeats suggesting recombinational events within the distinct single repeat units. Assignment of VNTR repeat numbers might be rather erroneous in those cases. Analysis of
tandem-repeat fragment length was recently reported to
provide misleading results about the phylogeny and subspecies affiliation of Francisella tularensis isolates. This was
found to be due to non-homologous, sequence-different
VNTR fragments of identical lengths in unrelated isolates
[28]. It should be emphasized again that the models predicting stability and flexibility of the distinct genomic
repetitive structures used for VNTR analysis in E. faecium
and other bacteria are rather theoretical and speculative.
Nothing is really known about the conditions affecting
stability of these structures. Due to this uncertainty, establishing phylogenetic relatedness in appropriate trees by a
link via single-locus or double-locus variants of MLVA
profiles which might suggest an evolutionary link should
be interpreted with caution.

Conclusion
Altogether 58 E. faecium mainly from clusters of infections
and colonizations and outbreaks among patients from 31
German hospitals were typed by MLVA. Results were compared to results of PFGE and MLST which led to the following conclusions: (i) MLVA is a suitable method to
identify isolates of epidemic-virulent E. faecium clonal lineages and differentiate them from isolates of other origins;
(ii) for isolates of the clonal complex of hospital-adapted
strains MLVA is the least discriminatory method when
compared to MLST and PFGE and MLVA results are less
concordant than MLST results when compared to results
of PFGE; and thus (iii) MLVA appears not to be suitable to
identify strain types of E. faecium in general, e.g. as necessary in cases of outbreaks. The data presented here for E.
faecium clearly indicate that non-related isolates could
possess an identical MLVA type. This would lead to false-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/28

positive results being especially critical when MLVA is
used to elucidate supposed outbreaks with E. faecium
within a single or among different hospitals.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Majority of isolates (n = 43) originated from recent outbreaks and clusters of infections and colonizations (CCI)
in German hospital patients between 2004 and 2006
(group III). Each isolate represents a single case/patient.
We stick to the term CCI since outbreak means cases of
infections. Our sample collection also includes cases of
colonizations (stool samples) and cases of infections
where the role of E. faecium is not clear (pneumonia, UTI).
According to common outbreak definitions, a cluster is
represented by n ≥ 2 cases which were epidemiologically
linked. Isolates UW5248-UW5258 (n = 6) originated
from a large private laboratory service provider in Southwestern Germany with a representative coverage of hospitals in five federal states (Labor Limbach, Heidelberg,
Germany). Six representative isolates were chosen from a
larger set of isolates representing clusters in five hospitals
[29]. The other 37 group III E. faecium originated from 14
other German hospitals. Additional eight isolates representing each one an older outbreak sampled all over Germany between 1996–1999 were also included (group II;
[30]). All seven but one (UW786) older hospital isolates
represent sporadic infections or colonizations in hospital
patients between 1991–1995 (group I; [31]). All hospital
E. faecium were vancomycin-resistant and possessed the
vanA gene cluster. For reasons of comparison 27 E. faecium
isolates from non-hospital origins as well as the vanA reference strain BM4147 were also included [31,32].
DNA isolation
DNA was isolated by a column-based technique as recommended by the manufacturer (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Standard protocol was slightly modified starting with an initial cell wall lysis step of 1 ml overnight culture centrifuged and resuspended in 400 μl TES
buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 10 % saccharose) plus
10 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.

Macrorestriction analysis in PFGE. Genomic DNA was isolated, digested with restriction endonuclease SmaI, and
treated as described recently [29]. The agarose gel concentration was 1 %, the CHEF-DR III apparatus (BIO-RAD
laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for PFGE. The
ramped pulsed times were as follows: 1–11 sec for 15 h
and 11–30 sec for 14 h at 14°C. Relatedness between
banding patterns was calculated using a band based similarity coefficient (Dice) and UPMGA clustering (BioNumerics, Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). A
composite tree of all 58 hospital VRE of groups I – III
resolved in 18 independent PFGE gels was generated the

same way with the exception of increasing the value of the
"position tolerance setting" to 1.5 % (default: position
tolerance setting 1.0 %; optimization 0.5 %). PFGE types
were assigned based on >90 % similar patterns and additionally considering recommendations for fragment pattern analyses as described recently [17,18].

performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations for cycle sequencing of PCR products (Applied Biosystems Germany, Darmstadt). Sequence files were read,
evaluated, aligned, and compared to the reference set of
alleles using sequencing software Lasergene 6.1. from
DNA-STAR (SeqMan 6.1; EditSeq 6.1), TraceEditPro from
Ridom [34], and via the official MLST webpage [33].
Assignment of new MLST types and allocation to their corresponding clonal complexes was done by the curator of
the internet service (Dr. R. J. L. Willems, University
Utrecht, The Netherlands).
MLVA
MLVA VNTRs were amplified according to Top et al., [14]
using modifications given at the corresponding website of
the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands [35]. Pure and
high-yield genomic DNA isolated via commercially available kits is especially essential for a successful amplification of VNTR-2. MLVA types were assigned using the
corresponding tool at the webpage (see above). For
unknown profiles a new MLVA type was assigned by the
operator of the internet service (Mrs. J. Top, University
Utrecht, The Netherlands).
Phylogenetic analyses
Software eBURST v3 was used to establish trees of phylogenetic relatedness between the isolates based on their
MLST or MLVA profiles [36]. Significance of branching of
the calculated trees was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of
1000 computer-generated trees. Clonal complexes are
defined as described recently [14,16]. Discriminatory
indices for and level of congruence between results of
MLST, MLVA and PFGE were calculated using Ridom software (Ridom Bioinformatics, Muenster, Germany) based
on references given [37-39]. However, the corresponding
values should not be interpreted as a stand-alone result.
Calculating similarity indices and congruence between
methods requires sample collections that are rather
unlinked. Our study strain collection is admittedly biased
since it involves only hospital E. faecium. So we recommend taking this into consideration and comparing those
values only within our study strain collection.

GW performed the MLVA typing and cluster analysis,
parts of the MLST sequencing and analyses, analyzed macrorestriction results and wrote the manuscript. IK supervised the strain collection including establishing the main
data set (contributor's data, resistance profile, standard
PCRs, etc.), assorted and allocated isolates for PFGE analyses, and did parts of the MLST sequencing and analyses.
WW supervised the study, established contacts to our
main contributors of strains, supervised assortment of isolates and critically read the manuscript. All authors read
and approved the final manuscript.

Acknowledgements
We would like to thank all persons, their institutions and microbial laboratories that provided the corresponding strains for our analyses. A special
