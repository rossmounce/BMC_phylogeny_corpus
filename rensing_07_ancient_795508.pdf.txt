Abstract
Background: Analyses of complete genomes and large collections of gene transcripts have shown
that most, if not all seed plants have undergone one or more genome duplications in their
evolutionary past.
Results: In this study, based on a large collection of EST sequences, we provide evidence that the
haploid moss Physcomitrella patens is a paleopolyploid as well. Based on the construction of
linearized phylogenetic trees we infer the genome duplication to have occurred between 30 and
60 million years ago. Gene Ontology and pathway association of the duplicated genes in P. patens
reveal different biases of gene retention compared with seed plants.
Conclusion: Metabolic genes seem to have been retained in excess following the genome
duplication in P. patens. This might, at least partly, explain the versatility of metabolism, as described
for P. patens and other mosses, in comparison to other land plants.

Background
In contrast to animals, the entire multicellular diploid
generation of plants (along with the cuticle and thickwalled, non-motile spores) probably evolved after the
transition to land [1,2]. All land plants display alternating
multicellular generations – the sexual, haploid gametophyte and the asexual, diploid sporophyte. In early land
plant fossils the gametophytic and sporophytic generation
share about equal morphological complexity, making it
likely that the gametophyte was reduced and the sporophyte became the dominant generation in vascular plants
[1-3] while in “bryophytes” (mosses, hornworts and liver-

worts) the sporophyte generation was reduced and the
gametophyte became dominant. Thus, “bryophytes” in
comparison with vascular plants enable inference of early
states of land plant evolution. Based upon spores found in
the fossil record, the first plants had occupied the land in
the Middle Ordovician, approximately 460 million years
ago (MYA) [1]. The first splits among the Embryophyta separated the Bryopsida (mosses), Antocerotophyta (hornworts) and Marchantiophyta (liverworts) from the
remainder of the land plants, the vascular plants. The oldest liverwort fossils are from the Late Devonian, ~360
MYA, the oldest mosses to be found in the fossil record are

from the Permian, ~270 MYA [4,5]. The first deposits containing remnants of modern mosses are from the Jurassic
and Cretaceous; based on these fossils some extant species
exhibited only limited morphological change in the past
80 MY [5,6]. Most of the mosses deposited in European
Miocene (24 MYA) are morphologically identical to
extant European genera and even species [5,7]. Mosses
embedded in Caribbean amber (20–45 MYA) could also
be traced to a large extent to extant genera and species [8].
In summary, some moss species might be 40–80 MY old,
whereas some genera might even be 80–100 MY old [6],
which is also seconded by recent phylogenetic analyses
[9,10].

values representing ancient duplication events were calculated. In total, 1,971 genes were placed in 854 clusters. A
cutoff distance of KS 5.0 was used and the KS-range was
divided into bins of size 0.1. The KS age distribution plot
exhibits a clearly distinguishable peak at KS ~0.85, providing evidence for an ancient large-scale or even genomewide duplication event (Figure 1A). While KS values >1.0
should be used with caution because multiple mutations
may cause inaccuracies in the estimation [26,27], the KS
estimate for the peak in the P. patens distribution thus
probably is trustworthy. Also, while e.g. in Drosophila KS is
lower in genes with strong codon bias, this is not the case
for P. patens [28] and thus needs not to be dealed with.

Gene and genome duplications are a driving force of
eukaryotic evolution [11,12]. Angiosperms (flowering
plants) are paleopolyploids, i.e. the genome of their common ancestor was subject to a large-scale or even genomewide duplication event during the Late Jurassic or Early
Cretaceous, 100–160 MYA [13,14]. This duplication event
might have triggered the angiosperm radiation during the
Late Cretaceous, which is apparent in the fossil record
[15]. There is evidence for several more large-scale or
genome-wide duplication events among the angiosperms.
The core eudicots apparently duplicated their genome in
the Late Cretaceous, while the common ancestor of the
Brassicales did so again in the Cenozoic [13,16]. Also poplar, of which the genome sequence has been determined
recently, has undergone an additional genome duplication event ~60 MYA, independent of the one in the Brassicales [17]. Recently, paleopolyploidy has been suggested
for several basal angiosperm species as well as for some
gymnosperms [18]. Interestingly, the retention of genes
after such large-scale duplication events has been shown
to be biased towards certain functional classes [16,19,20]
and it has been argued that such biased retention of duplicated genes has been a driving force for morphological
complexity, increase in biological diversity and eukaryote
adaptive radiation [13,21].

In order to obtain additional evidence for a large-scale or
genome-wide duplication in P. patens, as well as to date
this duplication event, we constructed linearized trees (see
Methods). We constructed neighbor-joining trees for 487
gene families which contained two to ten P. patens genes,
one Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or Ostreococcus tauri gene as
an outgroup sequence, and genes from at least two different seed plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, poplar, or rice) as reference points. Sequences that were evolving too fast or too
slow were removed, after which linearized trees, in which
branch lengths are directly proportional to time, were
constructed for each gene family [29,30]. This left 330
trees, and after removing nodes with bootstrap values <
70%, we obtained 179 nodes representing the duplication
events of P. patens in 159 trees that could be used for dating the gene duplications in P. patens by comparing the
time of duplication with the time of speciation between A.
thaliana and poplar, assumed 100 MYA [31] and A. thaliana or poplar and rice, assumed 150 MYA [32] (see Figure
1B).

The aims of the current study were: (i) to reveal molecular
evidence for genome duplications in non-seed plants, in
particular in the moss Physcomitrella patens, (ii) to date the
duplication event(s), and (iii) to study the possible evolutionary consequences by analyzing the retention of different functional classes of genes.

Results and discussion
Physcomitrella patens is a paleopolyploid
Based upon a dataset of 24,845 P. patens unigenes [22-24],
prediction of open reading frames using species-specific
models yielded a dataset of 22,237 coding sequences.
From those, a total of 2,907 paralogs were determined by
all-against-all BLAST searches using previously described
parameters [25]. After average linkage clustering, the KS-

Next, we plotted the estimated dates of the 179 P. patens
duplication events, which are shown in Figure 1C. As can
be clearly observed, a majority of the gene duplicates seem
to have been created between 30–60 MYA (average 45
MYA), indicating that a large-scale gene duplication or a
whole-genome duplication is indeed likely to have
occurred around this time. Although using two different
calibration dates (100 MYA for the Arabidopsis-poplar
split, and 150 MYA for the monocot-eudicot split) may
affect the age distribution if one of the two calibration
dates is unrealistic compared to the other, age distributions obtained for each calibration point separately were
very similar (data not shown), suggesting that the dates of
100 MYA and 150 MYA [31,32] are in good agreement
with inferred dates from tree topologies.
It should be noted, however, that a number of alternative
and more sophisticated methods exist to estimate divergence or duplication dates based on tree inference, even if
rate heterogeneity between lineages is present. Yet, as has

been shown in several studies (e.g. [33] and references
therein), caution should be taken when using such ratesmoothing methods. It is also much harder to process a
large amount of data in a high-throughput manner using
rate-smoothing methods because of the different parameters that ideally have to be estimated or used for different
genes or proteins, while this is not the case when a correction for unequal rates is not required and faster/slower
evolving genes are simply removed, as in the linearized
trees method applied here. The major disadvantage of the
linearized tree method is that a substantial amount of
data is omitted from the analysis because trees showing
unequal branch lengths for the species under investigation are not considered. However, in the current study
there are plenty of data left to provide convincing evidence that a large-scale gene duplication event has
occurred in the evolutionary past of P. patens. This was the
main aim of our study, rather than to come up with the
most accurate dating of that event, which will be very difficult anyway given the fact that the calibration points are
debateable in the first place.
However, the approximate range of the duplication event
is probably trustworthy. If we assume that the genome
duplication indeed took place about 45 MYA (average of
the peak in Figure 1), and we assume that genes duplicated at that time have an average KS value of 0.85 (see Figure 1), we can infer the rate of synonymous substitutions
by simply dividing 0.85 by 45 MY. This gives us a rate of
1.9 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per
year, which is very close to the value presented by Koch et
al. [34] based on the calibration of molecular clocks for
eudicots. However, these substitution rates have to be
interpreted with caution, since there are many theoretical
and empirical concerns about the accuracy of molecular
clocks and the rate of substitutions in different lineages.
Some of the major issues are rate heterogeneity in and
between lineages caused by evolutionary factors (e.g. generation time), difficulties in interpreting the fossil data
used to calibrate the clock, and rate variation among
genes, even at synonymous sites.
An enigma unveiled: ploidy levels and chromosome counts
among mosses
Besides the long-term effect of increasing the genetic complexity, there might be several possible short-term advantages of polyploidization events for diploid seed plants
(reviewed by [13]), such as heterosis effect, sympatric and
allopatric speciation, decreased inbreeding depression
and genetic load (allowing selfing populations that can be
monoecious and better dispersers). Genome duplication,
due to its effects on gene regulation and developmental
processes, might also be a foundation for speciation and
adaptation through genetic divergence in plants [35]. In
the case of the haploid “bryophytes”, however, other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/130

effects appear more relevant. The allopolyploidization of
dioecious gametophytes might yield a monoecious plant
(thus rendering the dispersal of breeding populations easier). A second advantage might be that the duplication of
the genome would free the formerly haploid plant from
the necessity to preserve the function of crucial single copy
genes under all circumstances, thus enhancing the potential for development of new functions. The moss P. patens
belongs to the Funariaceae, is haploid, monoecious and
self-fertile. Polyploidization occurs rather frequently during transfection of P. patens protoplasts [36]. Among
transformants, diploid plants cannot be distinguished
from haploid plants using morphological traits alone
[37]. The P. patens wild type, however, is clearly functionally haploid, as can be seen from segregation ratios [38].
Taken together, our data suggest that the ancestor of P.
patens underwent polyploidization during the Eocene,
potentially becoming hermaphroditic through this process. However, subsequently the plant became functionally
haploid again (haploidization) while keeping the duplicated chromosomes. Analogous states are known from
seed plants as well, where duplicated chromosomes often
remain after allopolyploidization and subsequent diploidization [39,40].
Most liverworts have 9 chromosomes and hornworts usually have 8, 9 or 10; there are few polyploids in both
groups. The mosses, in contrast, display chromosome
numbers between 4 and 72 [41]. These are probably due
to both different base numbers in the different orders and
the existence of many aneuploids and polyploids [5].
Within the Funariaceae, chromosome counts between 4
and 72 have been reported [41]. While Funaria hygrometrica seems to be representative for the majority of Funariaceae, Physcomitrium pyriforme usually exhibits a higher
chromosome count with several samples each being
described to contain 18, 26, 36, 52 and 54 haploid chromosomes, with the highest number being 72 chromosomes [41]. Among the analysed F. hygrometrica
accessions, 51% contain 28 chromosomes. While single
accessions were described to contain 4, 21 and 42 chromosomes, the remainder contains either 14 (34%) or 56
(9%) chromosomes. In the case of P. patens, chromosome
counts of 14 and 28 have been reported for two different
isolates [42]. These data make frequent, recent and independent polyploidization events among individual species or genera evident. The haploid chromosome count of
the P. patens ecotype analysed here is 27 [43], which, given
the data presented in this work, would make it a putative
paleopolyploid and paleoaneuploid. In a recent phylogenetic analysis, the age of the Funariales was determined at
~172 MYA [9]. Therefore, the whole genome duplication
analysed here most probably represents a duplication
event that occurred after speciation among the Funariaceae. Consequently, the different chromosome counts

found in extant species like P. patens, F. hygrometrica and
P. pyriforme have most probably occurred and been fixed
several times independently during evolution. This is further supported by the fact that moss genera or species
seem to have become hermaphroditic several times independently during evolution, given the dissipated pattern
of mon- and dioecious species within the taxonomic
groups [6].

enriched in plant (A. thaliana and rice) duplicate genes
[47] were compared with those assigned to genes present
in the P. patens KS peak and were found not to be enriched.
The genes present in the peak (Figure 1A) representing the
whole genome duplication were also mapped against the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database in order to analyse in which pathways they are
involved. Among the genes that belong to the under-represented GO categories, the lack of ribosomal proteins
(48% of those present in the reference set) is noteworthy.
The genes belonging to the enriched GO categories all
belong to the KEGG ontology (KO) class "metabolism".
Among GO:0006091 "generation of precursor metabolites and energy", the major KO pathways are energy and
carbohydrate metabolism, among GO:0009058 "biosynthesis", the major KO pathways are carbohydrate, amino
acid and lipid metabolism. Thus, both GO and KEGG
analyses demonstrate an abundance of genes involved in
metabolism that were specifically retained following the
whole genome duplication. This is in concordance with
the high abundance of metabolic genes in P. patens as
compared to seed plants which has been described previously [22]. Based on GO mappings of large-scale genome
or transcriptome datasets, metabolism-associated transcripts account for 10–44% of seed plant transcriptomes,
while their abundance is significantly higher (70–80%) in
mosses [22]. Apparently, metabolic genes have been
maintained in excess following the large-scale duplication
event, which might explain their previously observed
abundance in the P. patens genome.

Gene retention following the whole genome duplication in
P. patens
It has been demonstrated that retention of functional
gene classes after large-scale duplication events is biased
in angiosperms. For example, genes involved in signal
transduction and transcriptional regulation were preferentially retained after the three whole genome duplication
events within the ancestor of A. thaliana, while there was
selection against retention of these genes after small-scale
duplication events [16,19,20]. In order to analyse potential bias among the genes that were retained following the
genome duplication in Physcomitrella patens, we compared
the fractions of genes associated with Gene Ontology
(GO) terms [44]. All paralogs with a KS of 0.6–1.1 (765
genes) were mapped to GO Slim [45] and compared to
the associations of an equally sized random sample. The
biological process categories "biosynthesis" and "generation of precursor metabolites and energy" are significantly
over-represented (q < 0.05) among the retained paralogs
(Table 1). In total, 199 genes, (26%) belong to these categories. Genes of biological process categories that are
under-represented within the genome duplication peak
are "protein biosynthesis", "organelle organization and
biogenesis", "cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis"
and "cytoplasm organization and biogenesis". Genes
involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, which were preferentially retained after genome
duplications in angiosperms [19,20,46], seem not to be
retained in excess following the duplication event in P.
patens. Also, the PFAM domains that were reported to be

Peculiarities of moss ecology and metabolism
There are species of mosses that can survive long times of
dryness (up to 14 years), extreme cold (Antarctica) and
heat (70 to 110 degrees Celsius) and are able to prosper in
only 0.1% of sun light (while seed plants need at least
2%). In general, mosses are adapted to capture of low
light intensities, having low light compensation and satu-

ration points, making use of their one-cell-thick leaflets
and lack of waxy cuticles [48]. The structural simplicity of
the tissues permits mosses to react immediately to water,
CO2 and light availability in terms of photosynthesis [48].
Mosses in general are able to grow over a wider temperature range than seed plants, particularly at low temperatures. Many mosses are able to have photosynthetic gain
at temperatures as low as -10°C [48]. They typically
become dormant in summer heat and drought but are
able to immediately photosynthesize upon rehydration.
Mosses are able to receive nutrients from the substrate as
well as from precipitation and dust [48]. In a multitude of
studies, alternative and/or redundant metabolic pathways
have been described in mosses. As an example, the reduction of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to sulfite by
adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase is considered the
key step of sulfate assimilation in seed plants. While APSreductase is present in P. patens as well, this moss also harbors a phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS)
reductase, which was previously known e.g. from enteric
bacteria [49]. Thus, P. patens is able to employ an alternative pathway of sulfate reduction that is not accessible to
seed plants. Interestingly, sulfate adenylyltransferase, the
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of PAPS from ATP
and inorganic sulfate, is encoded by a gene present in the
KS peak. In Ceratodon purpureus. a bifunctional delta-fatty
acyl acetylenase/desaturase has been characterized which
displays a redundant functionality, being able to introduce a Delta6cis-double bond into 9,12,(15)-C18-polyenoic acids as well as converting a Delta6cis-double bond
to a Delta6-triple bond [50]. P. patens contains a homolog
of the yeast ELO-genes unknown from seed plants, encoding a component of the Delta6-elongase, which is
involved in the biosynthesis of C20 polyunsaturated fatty
acids [51]. Among the proteins encoded by the KS peak
genes, 12 are involved in fatty acid metabolism (e.g., fatty
acid desaturase, long-chain fatty-acid-CoA ligase), of
which eight are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.
Lipid metabolism and volatiles
The tetracyclic diterpene 16alpha-hydroxykaurane is a
major lipid compound in P. patens, which has been shown
to be released into the air [52]. P. patens contains high levels of arachidonic acid and lesser amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid, which is due to delta5- and delta6desaturases that are associated with the synthesis of these
fatty acids [53,54]. A complex mixture of fatty acidderived aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols is released upon
wounding of P. patens. In contrast to other lipoxygenases
cloned so far, the P. patens enzyme exhibits an unusually
high hydroperoxidase and fatty acid chain-cleaving lyase
activity, leading to the formation of unusual oxylipins
based on arachidonic acid as substrate [55]. Thus, a highly
diverse product spectrum is formed by a single enzyme
accounting for most of the observed oxylipins produced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/130

by P. patens. Also, a P. patens gene was cloned and classified to encode an unspecific hydroperoxide lyase having a
substrate preference for 9-hydroperoxides of C18-fatty
acids [56]. The knockout lines failed to emit (2E)-nonenal
while formation of C8-volatiles was not affected, indicating that in contrast to flowering plants the P. patens
enzyme is involved in formation of a specific subset of
volatiles. Ent-kaurene is a precursor for gibberellins (GAs)
in plants and fungi. The fungal CPS/KS enzyme catalyzes
a two-step reaction corresponding to ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS)
activity in plants. Overexpression of fungal CPS/KS in A.
thaliana has been shown to rescue GA-deficient phenotypes [57]. Interestingly, the over-expressing plants emitted ent-kaurene as a volatile, inducing airborne action on
nearby plants. Recently, an ent-kaurene synthase from P.
patens was cloned and characterized. The enzyme is a
bifunctional cyclase which, like fungal CPS/KS, directly
synthesizes ent-kaurene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate
[58].
Tolerance to abiotic stresses
In comparison with seed plants, Physcomitrella patens
exhibits a much greater tolerance to abiotic stresses, being
able to survive e.g. NaCl concentrations up to 350 mM
and sorbitol up to 500 mM [59]. P. patens is dehydration
tolerant, plants that had lost 92% water on a fresh-weight
basis were able to recover successfully [59]. Other mosses,
like Tortula ruralis, are even desiccation tolerant, the rehydrating gametophytes displaying an abundance of transcripts that code for e.g. enzymes involved in oxidative
stress metabolism [60]. The transcript levels of novel putative membrane transporters similar to mammalian
inward rectifier potassium channels were shown to be
upregulated in P. patens upon cold and osmotic stress
[61]. The widespread calcifuge moss Pleurozium schreberi is
moderately tolerant to dissolved SO2 (bisulfite). The tolerance mechanism involves extracellular oxidation using
metabolic (photo-oxidative) energy, passive oxidation by
adsorbed Fe3+ and probably also internal metabolic
detoxification [62]. In a comparative classification of
alpine mosses, lichens and seed plants, strong illumination caused photodamage in dried leaves, but not in dry
moss (Grimmia alpestris) and dry lichens [63]. In hydrated
mosses, but not in leaves of seed plants, protein protonation and zeaxanthin availability are fully sufficient for
effective energy dissipation even when photosystem II
reaction centers are open [64]. During desiccation,
quenchers accumulate in the poikilohydric moss Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus which are stable in the absence of water
but revert to non-quenching molecular species on hydration [65]. Together with zeaxanthin-dependent energy
dissipation, desiccation-induced thermal energy dissipation protects desiccated poikilohydric mosses against
photo-oxidation, ensuring survival during drought peri-

ods [65]. There are several proteins encoded by KS peak
genes that might be related to these phenomena, such as
those involved in carotenoid synthesis (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, zeta-carotene desaturase, two
phytoene synthases) and electron transfer (ten light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding proteins, two
plastocyanins and two cytochrome b6-f complex iron-sulfur subunits).

Conclusion
It is remarkable that many alternative metabolic pathways
exist in P. patens and other mosses while they are absent
from seed plants. Some of the metabolites produced by
these genes, such as volatile lipid compounds, might aid
pathogen defence. As an opportunist growing on different
types of soil, being able to prosper using a plethora of
energy sources might suit P. patens well. Drought tolerance is a primordial trait which is especially important for
mosses, because they generally do not possess an epidermis or a sturdy cuticula. The biased retention of genes
involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction in angiosperms, resulting in highly adapted and
complex regulatory systems, is likely closely interwoven
with their increase in complexity and adaptive radiation
[13]. Mosses, however, might follow an entirely different
strategy, being generalists rather then specialists in terms
of their metabolic gene complement, growing in habitats
not readily accessible for seed plants.

Methods
Unigene set and ORF prediction
The dataset used consisted of 24,845 unigenes based on
~130,000 public P. patens expressed sequence tags (EST),
the production parameters of which have been described
before [22,23]. An evaluation of several tools for open
reading frame (ORF) prediction was carried out, including
ESTScan [66], FrameD [67] and Estwise [68]. As it turned
out, using A. thaliana or plant-trained models yielded a
high rate of false positive predictions for P. patens genes
[23]. Homology-based ORF prediction was hindered by
the fact that the closest homologs often shared only 30–
40% identity on amino acid level. By dividing all publicly
available P. patens mRNAs into a training set (226
sequences) and a test set (100 sequences), FrameD turned
out to be the most accurate individual tool. After testing,
a P. patens specific hidden Markov model (HMM) for ESTScan and interpolated HMMs for FrameD were built by
using all 326 sequences. In order to improve the quality of
the predicted ORFs, FrameD was given the results of a
BLASTX-search of the unigenes against Genpept using an
E-value cutoff of 1E-10. ORFs were determined by combining the prediction results from ESTScan and FrameD,
preferring the latter. In total, 19,313 ORF were detected by
FrameD and 21,344 by ESTScan, the combination yielding 22,237 ORF which were used for further analyses.

Calculating the KS distribution
Two Perl scripts were written to identify clusters of paralogous genes and subsequently calculate KS distributions.
The software ("KeyS") is available upon request. The
method used to calculate Figure 1A is described below.
Identification of pairs of paralogous genes
To identify similar sequences on peptide level, an allagainst-all BLAST-search was performed using BLASTP
with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10. Two sequences were
defined as paralogs if the sequences could be aligned over
a length of at least 150 amino acids and showed at least
30% identity [25]. Gene pairs with a BLAST identity of
98% or higher were further tested for identity because
near identical sequences occasionally are present in clustered EST data due to sequencing errors and the fragmentary nature of EST. To do this, the nucleic acid sequences
were aligned globally using the EMBOSS [69] implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, needle. Afterwards all leading and trailing gaps were removed from the
alignment. Two sequences were then defined as identical
if the aligned sequences had an identity of at least 98.0%.
From all identical gene pairs the longer sequence was kept
and all gene pairs containing the shorter sequence were
discarded.
Clustering of paralogous genes
In order to reduce the computational complexity, genes
were clustered prior to KS calculation. From the list of gene
pairs, the genes of the pair with the highest BLAST-derived
bit score were chosen as the first two genes of a new cluster. If several pairs shared the same bit score, the pair with
the shortest alignment length was selected first. New
members were subsequently added to the cluster using
agglomerative linkage clustering until no more suitable
candidate genes were left. After completion of each cluster, all gene pairs having at least one clustered member
gene were deleted from the gene pair list.
Estimation of KS values for gene pairs
In a first step the peptide sequences were aligned globally
using needle. Afterwards, all positions containing a gap
were removed from the alignment and the amino acids
were replaced by their corresponding codons. The nucleotide alignment was used to calculate the KS-value with
the maximum likelihood method implemented in codeml
of the PAML package [70]. Codon frequencies were calculated from the average nucleotide frequencies at the three
codon positions (codon frequency model F3 × 4). Because
codeml can get stuck in suboptimal likelihood maxima,
the calculation was repeated five times and the KS-value
with the highest likelihood was then assigned to the gene
pair.

Calculating the KS values used in the distribution
To remove node-connecting KS values > 5.0, subtree clustering based on the KS-values as distance measure was performed using average linkage clustering. Assuming that all
genes in a resulting cluster with n members originate from
the same ancestor gene, n-1 duplication events have taken
place. However, the number of possible gene pairs or KSvalues of a cluster with n members is n × (n-1)/2, which
exceeds the number of duplication events for n > 2. Using
all pairwise KS-values of a cluster directly in the age distribution would thus falsify it. Instead, we used approximate
KS-values for the n-1 duplication events that were derived
from the pairwise KS-values during the clustering. The
merging steps taken during the KS-based clustering were
represented in a bifurcating dendrogram. The terminal
nodes represent the genes of the original cluster and each
inner node represents the joining of two clusters, which
also can be regarded as the duplication event giving rise to
the two clusters. To each inner node, and each duplication
event respectively, the average inter cluster KS-value of the
merged gene clusters can be assigned. The inter cluster KSvalues ≤ 5.0 were used to represent the duplication events
of the cluster in the age distribution.
Construction of linearized trees
We have inferred the age of P. patens duplicated genes by
constructing linearized trees and comparing the time of
gene duplication with the A. thaliana-poplar split or the
monocot-eudicot split, following the method used by
Vandepoele et al. [30]. To this end, the 22,237 protein
sequences of P. patens were grouped into 1,967 gene families containing two to ten P. patens proteins based on
sequence similarity [25]. All protein sequences of each
gene family were used as queries to do BLASTP searches
against proteins from Oryza sativa (TIGR release 4), Populus trichocarpa (JGI version 1, released June 7, 2006), Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR release 6), Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (JGI release 3), and Ostreococcus tauri (released
August 8, 2006). Gene families were built and neighborjoining trees were constructed using LINTREE [29] based
on the alignments of each gene family [30]. Only those
gene families that included at least one outgroup
sequence (C. reinhardtii or O. tauri) and sequences that
could be used as reference or calibration points (see
below) to estimate the date of the P. patens duplication,
i.e. sequences from at least two different organisms out of
the three angiosperm species (rice, poplar and A. thaliana), and which all had to have higher BLASTP scores
than that of the outgroup sequence, were considered for
further analyses. Linearized trees, which assume equal
rates of evolution in different lineages of the tree [29],
were constructed for each gene family after sequences
evolving at highly deviated rates were removed [30]. The
split of A. thaliana and poplar, or monocots (rice) and
eudicots (Arabidopsis and poplar), set at 100 and 150

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/130

MYA, respectively, were used as reference points to estimate the age of the P. patens duplicates. Each node that
was used for dating had to have bootstrap support ≥ 70%
[71]. In cases where the tree had more than one reference
point that could be used for dating, the duplication date
was first calculated separately using each reference point.
The tree was then discarded if the minimum and maximum date differed by >20 MYA. If the difference was ≤20
MY, the average of the date estimates from all possible reference points was taken as the date of the duplication
event.
Gene Ontology and pathway mapping
GO terms were assigned to the sequences using Blast2GO
[44] with an E-value cutoff of 1E-25 and a minimal hit
length of 80 amino acids. The GO Slim annotation (which
avoids the redundancy of GO term association) was created using the generic GO Slim file, GO terms, definitions
and ontologies [72]. It was determined (using five-fold
leave-one-out cross validation) how many genes are necessary to do GO bias comparisons in order not to be
affected by sampling bias. As it turned out, a sample size
of at least 500 genes is sufficient to detect significantly
biased categories. The fractions of genes assigned/devoid
of individual GO terms were tested for deviation within
the 765 duplicated genes in comparison with a randomly
chosen reference set (excluding genes from the KS peak) of
equal size (765 out of 2,202 possible genes) using Fisher's
exact test. Resulting p values were adjusted to control for
multiple testing by calculating the false discovery rate
[73]. Statistics were performed with R 2.1.0 [74]. The
KEGG pathways were assigned to the sequences representing the peaks using KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation
Server 1.10; [75]). Searches were performed against the
whole dataset with a bit score threshold of 60 and the bidirectional best hit method (BBH).
