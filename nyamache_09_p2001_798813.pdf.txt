Background

Conclusion

In sub-Saharan Africa, where the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been most devastating, there are multiple subtypes of this virus. The
distribution of different subtypes within African populations is generally not linked to particular risk behaviours.
Thus, Africa is an ideal setting in which to examine the
diversity and mixing of viruses from different subtypes on
a population basis. Objectives: To determine the subtypes
of human immunodeficiency virus -1 (HIV-1) circulating
in a HIV-positive drug naive populations Nairobi, Kenya.

Our analysis indicated that HIV subtypes in Nairobi province of Kenya are predominated by subtypes A1. Additionally, the detection of high prevalence of recombinant
forms indicates viral mixing in among the population,
possibly as a result of dual infections.

Methods
In this study, 78 blood samples were sampled randomly
and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) separated.
Total proviral DNA was used in nested polymerase chain
reaction to amplify 697 bp HIV Pol region. The PCR
amplimers were cloned and partially sequenced. Generated sequences were aligned and phylogenetically analysed using known reference subtypes sequences.

Results
The distribution of subtypes in this population was as follows: subtype A, 39(50%); subtype D, 8(10.25%); subtype C, 28(35.9%); and CRF A1D, 3(3.0%). Based on the
small sample size analysed, the 3.0% intersubtype recombinants detected suggested, there is a higher levels in
Kenya and in other parts of Africa where are multiple subtypes.
