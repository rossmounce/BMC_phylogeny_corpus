Transitional fossil earwigs - a missing link in
Dermaptera evolution
Jingxia Zhao, Yunyun Zhao, Chungkun Shih, Dong Ren*, Yongjie Wang

Abstract
Background: The Dermaptera belongs to a group of winged insects of uncertain relationship within Polyneoptera,
which has expanded anal region and adds numerous anal veins in the hind wing. Evolutional history and origin of
Dermaptera have been in contention.
Results: In this paper, we report two new fossil earwigs in a new family of Bellodermatidae fam. nov. The fossils
were collected from the Jiulongshan Formation (Middle Jurassic) in Inner Mongolia, northeast China. This new
family, characterized by an unexpected combination of primitive and derived characters, is bridging the missing
link between suborders of Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera. Phylogenetic analyses support the new family to be
a new clade at the base of previously defined Eodermaptera and to be a stem group of (Eodermaptera
+Neodermaptera).
Conclusion: Evolutional history and origin of Dermaptera have been in contention, with dramatically different
viewpoints by contemporary authors. It is suggested that the oldest Dermaptera might possibly be traced back to
the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic and they had divided into Archidermaptera and (Eodermaptera+Neodermaptera) in
the Middle Jurassic.

Background
The earwigs (Dermaptera) are familiar insects, often
unwelcomed, mainly due to their nocturnal habit, some
feeding on decaying matters, emitting foul smell, and an
unfounded myth that earwigs would crawl into peoples’
ears and penetrate into their brains during sleep. The
Dermaptera belongs to a group of winged insects of
uncertain relationship within Polyneoptera, which has
expanded anal region and adds numerous anal veins in
the hind wing [1]. Earwigs are very scarce in the insect
fossil record. Nel et al. in 1994 listed only 73 taxa of
Dermaptera described, figured or simply mentioned in
literature [2]. Even with subsequent addition of 10 species, the fossil record of the Dermaptera stands at 83
species [3,4]. Evolutional history and origin of Dermaptera have been in contention, especially for the fossil
earwigs.
Here we report a new genus with two new species (Belloderma arcuata gen. et sp. nov. (Figure 1) and Belloderma ovata sp. nov. (Figure 2)) in a new family of

Bellodermatidae fam. nov., from the Middle Jurassic
(Bathonian-Callovian) of the Jiulongshan Formation [5-7]
in Daohugou (N41°18’30”, E119°13’00”) of Ningcheng
County, Inner Mongolia, China. Our study of these two
earwigs and phylogenetic results provide new understanding of earwigs’ origin and evolutional process and
enable us to update the phylogenetic and evolutional
relationships among major lineages of earwigs.

Methods
The specimens were examined with a Leica MZ12.5 dissecting microscope and illustrated with the aid of a
drawing tube attached to the microscope. Line drawings
were made with photoshop9.0 graphics software. Morphological terms used here follow those by Michael S.
Engel and Fabian Haas [8].
Phylogenetic Analysis

The relationships of fossil Dermaptera is re-assessed, the
fossil taxa used in the phylogenetic analyses of fossil
Dermaptera are listed in Table 1. This study predominantly used body characters, because wing characters
and male genitalia characters are almost always poorly

preserved in fossils. We followed the original descriptions because these fossils were not available to us. Our
phylogenetic analyses of Dermaptera used limited characters to study the reliability and position of the new
family Bellodermatidae fam. nov. rather than the interrelationships of Dermaptera. Thus, if a fossil earwig
genus contains several species, only one representative
species was chosen to keep the number of taxa low for
computational reasons. The character matrix for this
dataset is shown in Table 2 and Table 3. We constructed matrices with 17 taxa, 20 characters and 20
taxa, 20 characters separately. The two matrices are the
same for the fossil species, but they are different in
three additional extant taxa in Table 3. Three species of
Blattodea (Leucophaea maderae, Polyphaga aegyptiaca,
Periplaneta americana) and a species of Plecoptera (Isoperla obscura) [9-11] are used as outgroup.

All characters were treated as unordered and
weighted equally. The data matrices were subjected to
the parsimony analyses in NONA and PAUP* (version
4.0b10) [12]. The two programs implement heuristic
searches somewhat differently, and so both were
employed. Because program NONA can be only
defined one outgroup, so we conducted the cladistic
analyses by each outgroups respectively. Heuristic
search in WinClada/NONA used multiple random
additions of taxa and tree-bisection resection branch
swapping (options set to hold 10000 trees, perform
1000 replications with one starting tree replication,
and the multiple TBR+TBR search strategy). Heuristic
search in PAUP* (version 4.0b10) employed a heuristic
parsimony analyses, with 1000 random stepwise additions of taxa (TBR branch swapping) under ACCTRAN
optimization.

List of characters and character states for phylogenetic
analysis (*: only present in matrix of Table 3)

1. Head. Opisthognathous (0) or prognathous (1) [13].
The three blattodean species have opisthognathous
head, while all other taxa possess a prognathous head.
2. Antennomere. 1st longer than 2nd (0) or 1st shorter
than or equal to 2nd (1) (Own observation). Character
state 1 is present in Archidermapteron, Asiodiplatys,
Protodiplatys, Microdiplatys, Longicerciata; all other species have character state 0.
3. Hind margin of head. Relatively straight (0) or
strongly notched (1) (Own observation). The hind

margin of head is strongly notched in Isoperla, Archidermapteron, Belloderma gen. nov, Semenoviola, Semenovioloides, *Forficula and *Anechura; the hind margin of
head in all other taxa is relatively straight. This character state is uncertain in blattodean species.
4. Neck. Blattoid-type (0) or forficuloid-type (1)
[13,14]. The three blattodean species possess a blattoidtype neck; all other examined dermapterans possess a
forficuloid-type neck.
5. Shape of pronotum. Disc-like, large, Blattodea-type
(0) or disc-like, small, Dermaptera-type (1) [13]. All dermapteran species have disc-like, small, Dermaptera-type
pronotum, while being large in three blattodean species.
6. Venation of tegmina. Present (0) or absent (1) (Own
observation). Veins are absent in *Archaeosoma, *Forficula and *Anechura; while all other species have veins
in their tegmina.
7. Shape of tegmina. Long, outer margin produced
into a point (0) or short, apically blunt (1) (Own observation). The tegmina are long and outer margin

16. Length of cerci. shorter than (0) or longer than
abdomen (1) [13]. Character state 1 is present in Archidermapteron, Asiodiplatys, Protodiplatys, Microdiplatys
and Longicerciata; character state 0 is present in other
species.
17. Adult cerci. Segmented 0) or unsegmented (1)
[13]. The adult cerci are unsegmented in *Archaeosoma,
Semenoviola, Semenovioloides, Turanoderma; *Forficula
and *Anechura; all others have segmented cerci.
18. Shape of adult cerci. Straight (0) or evenly curved
(1) (Own observation). The cerci are evenly curved in
Turanoderma, Turanovia, *Archaeosoma, *Forficula and
*Anechura; the cerci of other species are straight except
Semenoviola, which is uncertain for this character
because of poor preservation.
19. Structure of adult cerci. Symmetrical (0) or asymmetrical (1) (Own observation). The adult cerci are symmetrical in all examined species except Belloderma gen.
nov, which have asymmetrical cerci.
20. Ovipositor. Exposed (0) or unexposed (1) [13]. The
ovipositor is unexposed in outgroup, *Forficula and
*Anechura; all other species have an exposed ovipositor,
except *Archaeosoma, Dermapteron, Longicerciata,
Semenoviola and Semenovioloides because the known
fossils are male or poor preserved.

thin and short, with 3 segments and 1st longest. Ovipositor 1.1 mm long. Pygidium small.
Remarks

The two species are very similar to each other in body
size and eye size, but they differ from each other by
shape of the pronotum, pro-sternum and abdominal
segments, and they have distinctly different tegmina
shapes.
A new family is erected based on these two wellpreserved, unique fossil specimens with an unexpected
combination of characters (Table 4). The combined
characters of this new family allow its allocation to the
suborder Eodermaptera: tarsi three-segmented, tegmina
retain venation, 8th and 9th abdominal tergite in
females are narrowed, but separate from 10th tergite
and not covered by 7th tergite and exposed ovipositor.
However, there are some particular features of the new
family, which are not present for other fossils of Eodermaptera. For instance, the cerci are segmented, which
makes the new family be strikingly analogous to the species of suborder Archidermaptera. On the other hand,
the new family has a character assemblage similar to
extant insects in Neodermaptera, namely, tarsi threesegmented, and 1st segment long and stout, 2nd shortest and distinctly extended distally beneath 3rd one
(forficulid-type). The tarsi character is an important

family character. With respect to tarsi, the new family is
close to the modern Dermaptera [1].
In summary, the above-mentioned characters show
that the placement of the new family to the suborder
Eodermaptera is dubious. To make sure its exact placement, we set up two matrices and carried out phylogenetic analyses, one with only fossil taxa and the other
with fossil and three representatives of extant taxa.
Results of phylogenetic analyses

The phylogenetic analyses of Table 2 by NONA, we get
four most parsimonious trees, tree length = 25, consistency index = 0.76, retention index = 0.89 (Figure 3a),
and by PAUP, we get 34 most parsimonious trees, tree
length = 25, consistency index = 0.7600, retention index
= 0.8966 (See Additional file 1). The phylogenetic analyses of Table 3 by NONA, we get two most parsimonious trees, tree length = 31, consistency index = 0.67,
retention index = 0.87 (Figure 3b), and by PAUP, we get
four most parsimonious trees, tree length = 31, consistency index = 0.6774, retention index = 0.8780 (See
Additional file 2). The results by the two programs are
similar, and results conducted by NONA with the species of Blattodea as outgroup are same (See Additional
file 3). The best supported trees are shown in Figure 3.
Phylogenetic analyses show that the order Dermaptera is
divided into two clades: Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera (or Eodermaptera+Neodermaptera, in the analyses
including of the extant groups) (Figures 3a, b). The monophyly of Archidermaptera is confirmed in all the analyses,
supported by two synapomorphies: straight hind margin
of head (Cha. 3: 0) and pleural overlapping of abdominal
tergites and sternites (Cha. 14: 1) (Figures 3a, b, c). The

suborder Eodermaptera is well assembled in the analyses
that is only concerned for the fossil taxa, supported by one
synapomorphic character: fusion of 8th and 9th abdominal
tergites in females (Cha. 15: 1) (Figure 3a). However in the
analysis including the extant representatives, Eodermaptera grouping with Neodermaptera constitute a monophyly, sharing with Cha. 15 (Figure 3c). Although it
resulted in some different cladograms, our new family is
firmly assigned to the Eodermaptera or (Eodermaptera
+Neodermaptera), representing a stem-group of the clade.

Discussion
About the suborder Eodermaptera

Earwigs from the Jurassic were usually classified in the
extinct suborder Archidermaptera, comprising the known
basalmost lineage, which persisted until the earliest Cretaceous [15-18]. The genus Semenoviola Martynov, 1925
was placed in Coleoptera when it was erected, then it
was transferred to Pygidicranidae Verhoeff, 1902 together
with Semenoviolidae and Turanodermidae, which is a
family of known Neodermaptera [16]. Besides, as demonstrated by Willmann [17] and Haas and Kukalova-Peck
[13], the Semenoviolidae and Turanodermidae are more
closely allied to suborder Neodermaptera owing to the
unsegmented cerci but excluded from the latter owing to
the plesicmorphic retention of venation in the tegmina.
For this reason, Engel [19] proposed a new name, Eodermaptera, including Semenoviolidae and Turanodermidae.
According to the phylogenetic analyses here, the so-called
suborder Eodermaptera becomes paraphyletic, and so we
considered that the previously defined Eodermaptera species should be returned to the Neodermaptera or to combine them together as a new classification group.

About the evolutional history and origin of Dermaptera

Evolutional history and origin of Dermaptera have been
in contention, with dramatically different viewpoints by
contemporary authors. Some experts suggested the oldest fossils to date are tegmina from the Late Triassic of
England and Australia [20], but because of the poor preservation, others suggested the Dermaptera probably
originated during early Mesozoic in Asia [21].
Our study of these earwigs and phylogenetic results
have shed light on evolutional process and origin. The
Dermapteridae species have 5-5-5 tarsi, the same as Protelytroptera, Protodiplatyidae species have 4-4-5 tarsi,
and then (Eodermaptera+Neodermaptera) species have
3-3-3 taici. On the other hand, the unique nature of
hind wing in Dermapteridae indicates a closer relationship with Protelytridae among Protelytroptera, which is
considered as the ancestor of Dermaptera. The aforementioned summary shows that Dermapteridae is the
most basal in the Dermaptera and they are present in
Middle Jurassic. Protodiplatyidae was discovered only
from the Late Jurassic [16,18]. The more derived Bellodermatidae fam. nov. was present in the Middle Jurassic
of Jiulongshan Formation in Daohugou. Therefore, it is
suggested that the oldest Dermaptera might possibly be
traced back to the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic and they
had divided into Archidermaptera and (Eodermaptera
+Neodermaptera) not later than Early Jurassic.
The Turanodermatidae is presently known only from
the Late Jurassic of Central Asia but may extend to the
Early Cretaceous if the genus Archaeosoma [18] proves
to be allied [19]. In Figure 3c, phylogenetic analysis
shows that character 3 weakly supports the combination
of Archaeosoma and Turanoderma to be Turanodermatidae, but in the strict consensus tree, namely Figure 3b,
Archaeosoma and Turanoderma are paraphyletic, so
further research is needed about whether the genus
Archaeosoma can be allied to the family Turanodermatidae. The previously known eodermapterans up to date
have been documented only from the Late Jurassic of
Karatau in Chimkent Province of Kazakhstan [13]. The
discovery of Bellodermatidae fam. nov. extends the age
of previous Eodermapptera to the Middle Jurassic.
The previous neodermapterans first appear in the
Early Cretaceous [22,23] but might have originated in
the Late Jurassic [24]. Certainly, definitive neodermapterans and recognizable pygidicranids are known by
the Middle Cretaceous [1,25]. In summary, following
Grimaldi and Engel [1], the evolution of Dermaptera is
updated in Figure 4.

Conclusions
This new family Bellodermatidae fam. nov., bridging the
missing link between suborders of Archidermaptera and
Eodermaptera greatly enhanced the understandings of

early evolution of Dermaptera. Based on the phylogenetic
analysis, the new family is attributed to the Eodermaptera
or (Eodermaptera+Neodermaptera) unambiguously,
representing a stem-group of the clade. The suborder
Eodermaptera becomes paraphyletic with Neodermaptera, and the previously defined Eodermaptera species
should be returned to Neodermaptera or to combine
them together. It is suggested that the oldest Dermaptera
might possibly be traced back to the Late Triassic-Early
Jurassic and they had divided into Archidermaptera and
(Eodermaptera+Neodermaptera) in the Middle Jurassic.
