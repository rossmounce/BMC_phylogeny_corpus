Corbicula clams (Bivalvia, Corbiculidae) in
Western Europe

Abstract
Background: The genus Corbicula is one of the most invasive groups of molluscs. It includes both sexual and
androgenetic lineages. The present study re-assessed the different morphotypes and haplotypes of West European
Corbicula in order to clarify their taxonomic identification and phylogenetic relationships with American and Asian
Corbicula clams. We studied several populations from West European river basins (Meuse, Seine, Rhine and Rhône)
through an “integrative taxonomy” approach. We combined morphology, partial mitochondrial COI and cyt b
sequences and eleven microsatellite loci. Furthermore, we looked for discrepancies between mtDNA and nrDNA/
morphology, indicative of androgenesis between lineages.
Results: There are three Corbicula morphotypes in Western Europe associated to three mitochondrial lineages and
three genotypes. Form R shares the same COI haplotype as the American form A and the Japanese C. leana. Form
S and the American form C have the same haplotype, although their morphologies seem divergent. The European
form Rlc belongs to the same mitochondrial lineage as both the American form B and the Asian C. fluminea.
Interestingly, within each haplotype/genotype or lineage, no genetic diversity was found although their invasive
success is high. Moreover, we detected rare mismatches between mtDNA and nrDNA/morphology, indicative of
androgenesis and mitochondrial capture between form R and form S and therefore challenging the phylogenetic
relatedness and the species status within this genus. The global phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sexual
Corbicula lineages seem restricted to the native areas while their androgenetic relatives are widespread and highly
invasive.
Conclusions: We clarified the discrepancies and incongruent results found in the literature about the European
morphotypes of Corbicula and associated mitochondrial lineages. The three West European morphotypes belong to
three distinct nuclear and mitochondrial lineages. However mitochondrial capture occurs in sympatric populations
of forms R and S. The species status of the morphotypes therefore remains doubtful. Moreover the androgenetic
lineages seem widely distributed compared to their sexual relatives, suggesting that androgenesis and invasive
success may be linked in the genus Corbicula.

Background
The clams of the genus Corbicula are successful fresh
and brackish water invaders considered ‘r’-strategists,
with rapid maturation, high fecundity, and high dispersal
[1-3]. These bivalves are benthic filter-feeders which can
reduce phytoplankton density [4-6], compete with native

species [7,8] and damage industrial cooling systems [9].
The genus Corbicula is of particular interest both because
of its diverse reproductive strategies (from free-swimming
larvae to incubation of larvae in gills) [10] and because
it contains sexual and asexual reproducing lineages.
The genus includes sexual dioecious species as well as
hermaphrodites, with at least some or all of the latter
reproducing through a rare form of asexual reproduction,
known as androgenesis, in which offspring are clones
of their father [11,12]. Androgenesis in Corbicula is

characterized by the fertilization of an oocyte by an unreduced sperm (with a DNA content equal to the DNA
content of a somatic cell). The maternal nuclear DNA is
then entirely extruded as two polar bodies and only the
‘male’ pronucleus remains and becomes the nucleus of
the zygote [11-14].
Interestingly, androgenetic Corbicula lineages have
biflagellate sperm while sexual ones are characterized by
monoflagellate sperm [15-19].
The modern native range of the genus Corbicula is
Asia, the Middle East, Australia and Africa but fossils
have been recorded in Europe, North America and
Japan (reviewed in [20]). The first record of Corbicula
outside its extant original range was in 1924 in British
Columbia [21,22]. The clams then quickly spread
throughout North America and arrived in South America in the 1970s [23] and in Europe in the 1980s [24].
Although Corbicula is one of the most important
invasive bivalve groups because of its ecological and
economic impacts, the taxonomic status of the invaders
remains unresolved, because, amongst others, the genus
shows considerable phenotypic variation in shell shape
and ornamentation, some of which ecophenotypic [25].
The first traditional morphology-based taxonomic
studies of Asian Corbicula described approximately
200 species [26-28]. However, subsequent studies based
on shell characteristics [29], allozymes [25] or genetics
[30] suggested the occurrence of fewer species. In addition, both dioecious sexual and hermaphroditic clonal
lineages were found in Asia [17,31] but their evolutionary relationships, taxonomic status and nomenclature
are still uncertain. Park & Kim [31] studied several
Asian populations of Corbicula and showed that the
estuarine species form a distinct sister-clade of the
freshwater species with two mitochondrial lineages
being the most common in freshwater habitats in Asia.
Within these two major lineages, several haplotypes are
also found in the invaded areas (America and Europe),
e.g. haplotype FW1 in North America and haplotype
FW5 in America and Europe [31] (Table 1).
In the New World, three shell morphotypes have been
distinguished for invasive Corbicula [18]. The two North
American morphs show substantial morphological and
genetic differences [32,33] with form A (also referred to
as the “white form”) being apparently derived from populations of C. leana from Japan and form B (the “purple
form”) being derived from populations of C. fluminea
from China and/or Korea [34,19]. Both morphs have also
been recorded in South America where a third, genetically distinct, morph also occurs (form C; [18]).
In Europe, Corbicula clams were first recorded in
French and Portuguese estuaries in 1980 [24]. They
have subsequently succeeded in colonising many of the
major European watersheds and can reach high densities

in some rivers and lakes ([35-39], authors’ personal
observation). Ever since Corbicula was found in Europe
in the 1980s, it has been debated which species invaded
this continent and where they came from. A study [40]
revealed two morphotypes in several European rivers.
They were identified as C. fluminea and C. fluminalis.
C. fluminalis sensu stricto is a hermaphroditic form
from Central Asia, the Caucasus and Middle East, characterized by a high triangular shell [41]. Both morphotypes found in European rivers were genetically
characterized as two distinct genetic lineages based on
allozymes and mitochondrial COI sequences. However,
in the River Rhône, Renard et al. [40] found none of
these two haplotypes but instead found a unique, third
haplotype (COI haplotype IV) with the morphology of
the “C. fluminea“ lineage (Table 2). Based on enzyme
polymorphism and RFLP analysis of the mitochondrial
COI gene, this cryptic, unnamed lineage was considered
a separate species (”C. fluminea-like”) [40]. Pfenninger
et al. [42] also conducted a genetic study on Corbicula
including European samples. Two morphotypes, the
“round form” (R) and the “saddle form” (S), were found
sympatrically in the River Rhine. Based on mitochondrial COI sequence data, the round form (R) from the
Rhine has the haplotype H2 which is identical to haplotype I of Renard et al. [40], American form A [18,19,34]
and Asian C. leana haplotype FW5 [31,34]. However,
form S from the Rhine, which is morphologically close
to the C. fluminalis of Renard et al. [40], has exactly the
same COI haplotype (haplotype H4) as the third genetic
lineage (haplotype IV) from the Rhône and not the
expected C. fluminalis haplotype. These COI data also
indicate that the haplotype H4 of form S, and hence
Renard et al.’s [40] haplotype IV, is identical to the haplotype C1 of American form C ([18,19]). Moreover,
random DNA amplification fingerprinting and ITS1
RFLP analysis revealed the presence of cryptic hybrids
between the R and S lineages from the River Rhine [42].
These hybrids could display either parental morphotypes
or, in a few cases, intermediate morphotypes. In Portugal, the populations of Corbicula from the Lima and
Minho rivers are morphologically distinct but have the
same COI haplotype, identical to haplotype FW5 (the
“form A - form R lineage”) [43]. The observed difference
in shell shape and colour has been attributed to an
adaptation to distinct ecological conditions, different
origins and/or genetic alterations during distinct migration, or differential selection processes in the two rivers
[43].
Revising the divergent results obtained by Renard et al.
[40] and Pfenninger et al. [42] for the “C. fluminalis form S” morphotype (see also Table 2), it is still unclear
which European morphotype of Corbicula corresponds
to which haplotype and what is their phylogenetic

relationship with American and Asian Corbicula clams.
In Europe and America, most individuals of Corbicula
that have the same morphotype also have the same mitochondrial haplotype. However a mismatch between
mtDNA and morphotype may be observed because of
androgenesis between distinct genetic lineages [18,19,44].
More specifically, an unreduced spermatozoon from one
lineage can fertilize the egg of another lineage. The
maternal nuclear DNA of the latter one will be extruded
as two polar bodies but the mitochondria will be
retained, while only the ‘male’ pronucleus of the first lineage will be involved in the zygote development [11,18,19].
This phenomenon has also been referred to as egg parasitism. In some rare cases, the maternal nuclear genome
can be partially or totally retained, leading to a peculiar
form of hybridisation [18].
Furthermore, Komaru et al. [45,46] observed in
laboratory populations of C. leana and C. fluminea that
incomplete extrusion of the maternal genome occurs,

causing an elevation of ploidy level. Indeed, individuals
of C. fluminea of several ploidy levels have been
reported (2n: [47]; 3n: [48]; 4n: [48]).
The present study aimed at re-investigating the different morphotypes and haplotypes in West European
lineages of Corbicula in order to finally clarify their phylogenetic relationships with American and Asian clams.
We applied an “integrative taxonomy” approach by studying morphology and comparing it to molecular data [49].
More specifically, we used shell and sperm morphology,
partial mitochondrial COI and cyt b sequences and, in
addition, nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to study
Corbicula spp. collected from the Western European
river basins Meuse, Seine, Rhine and Rhône. In our
phylogenetic dataset we included published COI haplotypes of European, African, American, Asian and Australian lineages. Moreover, we explored the presence of
mismatches between mtDNA and nrDNA/morphotype
(cytonuclear mismatches) in European populations,

challenging the sister-taxon relationships and the species
status within the genus Corbicula. Furthermore, we
emphasize the possible relationship between androgenesis
and the invasive success of Corbicula clams.

Results
Morphological analysis

Two main morphotypes have been discriminated
visually. They correspond to the forms described by
Pfenninger et al. [42]: a round and broad form with
deep ridges (round form, R) and a narrow form with
closely spaced ridges (saddle form, S) (see [39] for pictures of both forms). Both forms occur syntopically in
the Hollands Diep (Rhine-Meuse delta), in the River
Meuse (Belgium, Table 3) and in the Rivers Seine and
Rhine (Table 4). The individuals from the River Rhône
can be subdivided into two colour groups of form R
[36], viz. one with dark shells whose interior surface is
white and purple (as in form R sampled elsewhere), the

other with lighter shells whose interior is white-yellow
(light form, Rlc). Form Rlc from the Rhône has also
been recorded in the River Gardon (France, see [39]).
Measurements were made on 429 specimens of Corbicula from all sampled localities. The measurements provided in the literature for the lectotypes of C. fluminea
Müller and C. fluminalis Müller (collection of Universitetets Zoologisk Museum of Copenhagen [20]) and the
type specimen of C. leana Prime (original description of
the species in [26]) were also included in the analysis.
The two main forms identified a priori (R and S) could
be distinguished on the basis of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) conducted on the three studied
ratios (H/L, H/W and L/W, see Methods) (Figure 1).
Form Rlc from the Rhône was morphometrically close
to form R (Figure 1). We therefore conducted a new
PCA on these two forms exclusively (results not shown).
This analysis still showed an overlap between the two
forms but suggested that specimens of form Rlc have a
significantly lower H/L ratio (analysis of variance, p <
0.01). However, our study included only 14 specimens
of form Rlc and a more extensive sampling is needed to
test the differences with form R. The morphological distinction between forms R and Rlc is mainly based on
colour, especially of the inner shell. Moreover, we
noticed that juvenile individuals of form Rlc have an
orange spot on their umbo (the dorsal shell protrusion)
which is not observed for juveniles of form R (Pigneur
LM & Marescaux J, personal observation).
The lectotype of C. fluminea clustered with individuals
of morphotypes R and Rlc on the biplot. The type specimen of C. leana was found in the margin of the group
composed of individuals of form R only. The lectotype
of C. fluminalis was found within the group of specimens of form S (Figure 1). The two individuals (Mo1
and Se26) showing a cytonuclear mismatch (see COI
and cyt b sequences analysis below) were morphologically part of the R-Rlc group (Figure 1).

Sperm morphology

The sperm morphology of the three morphotypes of
Corbicula (forms R, S and Rlc) was investigated because
the biflagellate sperm type has been recognized as a
diagnostic marker of androgenetic reproduction in this
genus [15,16,18]. The analysis revealed biflagellate spermatozoa in the three morphotypes of Corbicula (forms
R, S and Rlc). These three forms thus seem to reproduce through androgenesis like the invasive lineages
found in America [18].

available for Corbicula, we have conducted the sequence
analysis and the phylogenetic study with COI only.
One haplotype (COI haplotype 1) was found in all our
sampled populations. This haplotype 1 was exclusively
found in form R and its nucleotide sequence is identical to
European C. fluminea (haplotype I, [40]) and haplotype
H2 [41], the American form A [18,34], the Japanese
C. leana [34] and the Asian haplotype FW5 [31] (Tables 1,
2). We will refer to this COI haplotype as haplotype FW5
which was a common code used in Park & Kim [31] for
all individuals of Corbicula with this COI sequence.
The second haplotype (COI haplotype 2) was found in
all specimens of form S and in two specimens of form R
(Table 2). Haplotype 2 is identical to the European “C.
fluminea-like” COI haplotype IV from the Rhône [40]
and haplotype H4 found in form S in the Rhine [42]
and to the American form C [18] (Tables 1, 2). We will
refer to this haplotype as haplotype FW17 as in Park &
Kim [31]. Haplotype FW17 has not been found in any
Asian population [31].
We observed a discrepancy between the mitochondrial
lineage and morphology for two individuals of form R.
The first one was a single individual from the River
Meuse at Liège-Monsin (individual Mo1) and the second one is a single individual from the Seine (individual
Se26). Both individuals had the morphotype R but
exhibited the COI haplotype 2 (found in form S). The
same results were obtained for cyt b haplotypes. We
sequenced both genes again on new tissue samples from
these two individuals and obtained the same results.
Our third haplotype (COI haplotype 3) was exclusively
found in the individuals of form Rlc from the Rhône
while form R from this same site had the haplotype 1
(FW5) (Table 2). Renard et al. [40] found COI haplotype
IV in the five individuals studied from the Rhône; we
did not find this haplotype IV in the new samples we
obtained from River Rhône. Our haplotype 3 from the
Rhône is identical to the sequence of C. fluminalis (haplotype V) from Renard et al. [40] (Table 2). Therefore,
there is a discordance between our haplotypes and those
obtained by Renard et al. [40] for form S. The same discrepancy was also reported by Pfenninger et al. [42]
(Table 2). Our haplotype 3 is identical to the haplotype
FW4 of the Indonesian C. subplanata [31,50] (Table 1).
We will here refer to haplotype FW4 as in Park & Kim
[31]. This haplotype FW4 clusters with the American
haplotype B1 (identities: 636/637 bp) and C. fluminea
from Korea (identities: 613/614 bp) (Figure 2).
Our analysis yielded only three haplotypes for all
studied individuals among the four sampled European
rivers. Surprisingly, Pfenninger et al. [42] recorded a larger number of COI haplotypes, especially in the River
Rhine. We aligned all of these haplotypes and observed
that some sequences contain several Ns or are shorter

Page 7 of 15

than most published sequences. We therefore included
only some representative haplotypes of that study in our
Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI)
analyses.
Mitochondrial phylogeny (COI gene)

In total, 57 COI sequences of Corbicula available in
GenBank, including those three sequences from the present study, were included in the phylogenetic analysis
(Table 1). Out of these 57 sequences, 47 COI haplotypes
were defined (Additional file 1). From the 714 positions
(562 excluding gaps or missing data) including the
outgroup, 158 sites were variable (28%). Only 13% of
the sites remained variable when we excluded the
outgroup, the estuarine lineages (see Figure 2) and C.
madagascariensis.
Based on the lower value of Akaike information criterion (AIC), the GTR+g model was selected for phylogenetic analysis. Neocorbicula limosa was used as an
outgroup. ML analysis and BI gave a similar topology.
The phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) shows two divergent
clades: an “estuarine clade” (Asian C. fluminalis and
C. japonica) and a “freshwater clade”. Within this freshwater clade, C. madagascariensis is a sister-taxon to all
other freshwater lineages of Corbicula. In this latter
group, there is no clear geographic clustering of haplotypes of Corbicula, highlighting their cosmopolitan distribution. However the phylogenetic relationships
between the freshwater lineages of Corbicula remain
unresolved due to the low support (bootstrap and posterior probabilities) obtained for most clades. The three
haplotypes of our study (referred to as FW4, FW5 and
FW17 as in Park & Kim [31]) are each associated with a
distinct freshwater subclade. Within each of these subclades, there are mostly representatives of Corbicula
with biflagellate sperm (see Table 1) suggesting that
these lineages reproduce through androgenesis [19].
However the clade containing haplotype FW4 also
includes C. linduensis which has monoflagellate sperm
[17], suggesting that this latter reproduces sexually.
Microsatellites

Nuclear markers were mainly used in this study to
investigate the observed mismatches between mtDNA
and nrDNA/morphotype. For all eleven polymorphic
micosatellite loci, the two individuals with morphotype
R and COI haplotype 2 (FW17) of form S (individuals
Mo1 and Se26) exhibited exactly the same microsatellite
genotype as the form R individuals. Therefore, both
individuals clearly belong to the form R lineage at the
morphological and nuclear levels but have the form S
mitochondrial haplotype.
The same eleven microsatellite loci were also used to
analyse several West European individuals of Corbicula

Figure 2 Maximum Likelihood tree based on a 562 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene from Corbicula spp. Posterior
probabilities from Bayesian Inference (first) and bootstrap values from Maximum Likelihood (second) are indicated for nodes found in both
analyses. Sequence of Neocorbicula limosa was used as an outgroup. See Table 1 for the origin of all the sequences. The three European

belonging to the three different morphotypes (Table 5).
For microsatellite locus ClB03, forms R and S present the
same alleles (heterozygous; 2 alleles) while for the loci
ClA02, ClB11 and C01 forms S and Rlc have the same
allele size. Two loci (ClA01 and ClA03) did not amplify in
form S, though they did amplify in the two specimens of
form R with mtDNA COI haplotype 2 (as in form S). Two
other loci (ClD06 and ClE01) did not amplify in form Rlc.
The remaining four microsatellite loci amplified in all
three forms and revealed differences in allele size between
form R, S and Rlc. Since the microsatellite library was constructed for form R [51], it is not surprising that, due to
the genetic divergence between the three forms, some loci
did not cross-amplify in form S or Rlc (Table 5).
Surprisingly, for each tested microsatellite locus, zero
polymorphism was observed between individuals within
each morphotype originating from different West-

European populations. Only three distinct genotypes
(genotypes 1, 2 and 3 for forms R, S and Rlc respectively)
were identified. Bayesian clustering conducted using the
STRUCTURE software revealed distinct categories, with
the highest and most reliable probabilities for K = 3
(Additional file 3). This confirmed the observed differences between the three forms and the presence of only
three invasive haplotypes/genotypes of Corbicula in
Western Europe (Table 5).
These results are indicative of an overall very low
genetic divergence within European Corbicula and could
be related to their clonal reproductive mode.

form S) and the morphotype R. “R”, “S” and “Rlc” refer to the three West
European morphotypes.

in [36,41,42]. Our morphological analysis did not provide a
strong taxonomic assignment although the type specimen
of C. leana was plotted near the group including form R.
The sequence of haplotype 1, found in all studied individuals of form R in Europe (except the two “mismatches”),
was identical to Asian haplotype FW5. Those results are
congruent with those of Siripattrawan et al. [34] and
Hedtke et al. [19] which concluded that populations of
American form A (and therefore the European form R)
are derived from populations of C. leana (haplotype FW5)
from Japan. On the basis of these COI results, the European form R would not correspond to C. fluminea sensu
stricto as previously assumed. Regarding the genotyping
results, all 27 individuals of form R had one specific
nuclear genotype (genotype 1) for the 11 tested loci.
The individuals of form S (Meuse, Seine and Rhine
rivers) correspond morphologically to Corbicula fluminalis as defined by Renard et al. [40] and Korniushin
[41]. Our morphological analysis, through the PCA, also
showed similarity between the European form S and the
lectotype of C. fluminalis from Mesopotamia. The COI
haplotype 2 found in form S was identical to haplotype
FW17 and to American haplotype C1 (of form C). Interestingly Park & Kim [31] already highlighted that no
Asian haplotype corresponds to haplotype FW17.
Genetic and morphological data of specimens from the
native area of C. fluminalis (Middle East, Caucasus and
Central Asia) are needed to confirm the taxonomic
assignment of the European form S/American form
C. Our results also suggest that form S does not correspond to C. fluminalis sensu Park & Kim [31]. This
Chinese, estuarine C. fluminalis was found in the same
mitochondrial clade as C. japonica (Figure 2). Korniushin [41] already reconsidered this form as C.
cf. japonica on the basis of anatomy and reproductive
features. The genotyping results showed that all 23
European individuals of Corbicula of form S had the
same, distinct nuclear genotype (genotype 2) for the
9 microsatellite loci that amplified in form S although
these nuclear markers were developed for form R.

Pigneur et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/147

We obtained new samples from the Rhône and our
analysis revealed the presence of two distinct COI
lineages in this river: (i) the haplotype 1 (FW5) in individuals of form R and (ii) the haplotype 3 (FW4) found in
specimens of form Rlc exclusively. The European light
form Rlc had the same COI haplotype as the Indonesian
C. subplanata, and was closely related to the American
form B and Corbicula fluminea from Asia [19,34]. Glaubrecht et al. [10,17] already made the assumption that
C. subplanata would be conspecific with the widespread
C. fluminea. Hedtke et al. [19] concluded that the
American form B would be derived from populations of
the Asian lineage C. fluminea. As in form S, 9 microsatellite loci amplified in European form Rlc and revealed
a third distinct genotype (genotype 3), being identical in
all tested individuals of form Rlc.
The overall low genetic divergence between and
within the three forms and the possibility of a peculiar
hybridization through androgenesis between forms (see
below) suggest that invasive lineages of Corbicula may
represent a polymorphic species complex. Therefore we
propose to use the nomenclature “form R”, “form S”
and “form Rlc” for the three West-European lineages of
Corbicula.
- Unravelling discordant COI results

The sequence of haplotype 3 (FW4) we found in form
Rlc (Rhône) was identical to the C. fluminalis - haplotype V and not to the expected haplotype IV of the
Rhône found by Renard et al. [40]. This result of
Renard et al. [40] is contrasting with our data and
those of Pfenninger et al. [42]. Moreover, Renard et al.
[40] included 6 individuals of the C. fluminalis form
(form S) from the Meuse (Netherlands) but their
sequence (COI haplotype V) does not correspond to
the one we found (haplotype 2) in our sampling of
morphotype S and it does not correspond to haplotype
H4 from form S published by Pfenninger et al. [42]
(see Table 2). We do not have any evidence of temporal changes in the studied populations and we therefore hypothesize a mismatch between the published
sequences and their associated names/populations in
the paper of Renard et al. [40]. More specifically, the
COI sequence assigned to C. fluminalis (haplotype V)
in their publication actually belongs to the individuals
from the Rhône (their third unidentified lineage) and
corresponds to our form Rlc (also from the Rhône),
while their sequence of haplotype IV (Rhône) corresponds to their specimens of C. fluminalis as Pfenninger et al. [42] and this study demonstrated. In Table 2,
we present a summary of the incongruence and a
comparison of European, American and Asian COI
haplotypes of Corbicula.

- Mitochondrial/morphotype-nuclear mismatch

In Europe and North America, most individuals of
Corbicula with the same morphotype belong to the
same mitochondrial lineage ([18,19,42], this study). In
addition, in this study we have preliminary indications
that the same Corbicula morphotype also belongs to a
single genotype although more individuals should be
investigated. However, we detected a discrepancy
between the mitochondrial lineage and, the morphology
and the nuclear lineage of two specimens of form R,
one from the Meuse and one from the Seine, two of the
three rivers where we found forms R and S in sympatry.
These individuals with morphotype R exhibit the mitochondrial haplotype of form S (for both cyt b and COI)
but all polymorphic microsatellite markers identified
a form R nuclear DNA origin (genotype 1) for both
specimens. In the absence of recent nuclear exchange
between the morphotypes, the observed mismatch could
be explained by double uniparental inheritance (DUI),
population polymorphism in the ancestor of the species
or egg parasitism between the species [19]. Hedtke et al.
[19] did not find any evidence of DUI in individuals presenting a mtDNA/morphotype mismatch. The hypothesis of a polymorphic ancestor was rejected on the basis
of their phylogenetic analysis [19]. Hedtke et al. [19]
therefore concluded that this observed discrepancy
could only be the consequence of an androgenetic “egg
capture": after fertilization between the unreduced
sperm of one haplotype and the egg of a distinct haplotype, the maternal nuclear DNA from the egg is
extruded. The descendant therefore contain paternal
nuclear DNA while they retain the maternal mitochondrial DNA, resulting in a cytonuclear mismatch as
observed here for two individuals.
A similar cytonuclear mismatch was observed in some
American populations between forms A and B and
between forms B and C living in sympatry [18,19].
Discrepancies between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies have already been reported for Corbicula [42,44].
According to our mitochondrial phylogeny and our
microsatellite data, the disjunction found in our two singular individuals would imply a spermatozoon of lineage
R that “parasitized” an egg of lineage S.
- Androgenesis and invasiveness

In freshwater ecosystems, Corbicula fluminea sensu lato
is considered one of the most invasive species [3]
because of its large geographic dispersal and invasive
behaviour [3,20,24]. The invasive success of lineages of
Corbicula is attributed to their following biological
traits: rapid growth and maturation, high fecundity,
excellent dispersal capacities and association with
human activities [3]. However, their unique reproductive

Pigneur et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/147

mode might also play a role in the invasiveness of
lineages of Corbicula while this has never been highlighted. Our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) demonstrates that the “freshwater clade” includes both sexual
dioecious and androgenetic lineages. The sexual lineages
are mostly restricted to limited Asian areas, e.g. C. sandai which is endemic to Lake Biwa (Japan) or C. matannensis which is endemic to Indonesia. Moreover, it has
been shown that, on a limited spatial scale, the lacustrine lineages of Corbicula from Sulawesi (Indonesia)
form well-defined genetic clades [50] while identical or
closely related haplotypes of the androgenetic lineages
are found over large geographic distances, both in the
native and invaded regions ([31,50], this study). This
emphasizes that androgenesis seems to favour the invasive success of these clams. More specifically, androgenetic Corbicula are hermaphrodites and capable of selffertilization. Therefore, a single individual may easily
found a new population if the conditions are favourable.
This is one of the main advantages of asexual as compared to sexual lineages [52].
In addition, our genetic analysis of European populations of Corbicula revealed an absence of polymorphism
within each form. Many invasive species escape low
levels of genetic diversity owing to multiple and/or
repeated introduction events [53,54]. On the contrary,
there is a “prevalence of genetic bottlenecks” in invasive
species with several species showing a low genetic diversity but a high invasive potential [55]. This is considered
the “genetic paradox of invasive species” [55-58]. In the
case of Corbicula, further investigations should assess
the genetic diversity of the native populations to determine whether the invasive forms have encountered
genetic bottlenecks or not. Due to androgenesis several
of the lineages in the native area may indeed contain a
low genetic diversity. Whatever the origin of their low
genetic diversity, invasive lineages of Corbicula represent
one of those examples of “genetic paradox”. Phenotypic
plasticity, which is particularly high in molluscs, might
have played an important role in the adaptation to and
colonization of new environments as demonstrated in
many other invasive species [59-61]. In other words,
those three invasive clonal lineages of Corbicula, particularly form R dominating in Western Europe, could be
“general purpose genotypes” or even “super-genotypes”
associated with high levels of plasticity in response to
fluctuating environmental conditions [62,63].
However, a certain level of genetic diversity in Corbicula may be found in the combination of a nuclear
genome of one lineage with a new mitochondrial genome of a different lineage as a result of androgenesis
between lineages. This may provide a higher advantage
to androgenetic lineages compared to other asexually

Page 11 of 15

reproducing species. Mitochondrial capture has already
been pointed out as dispersal strategy in the endangered
cypress tree Cupressus dupreziana. This androgenetic
organism produces diploid pollen that may in turn fertilize the ovule of the related, common species Cupressus
sempervirens. This latter species, then, acts as a surrogate mother [64,65]. Moreover, androgenesis allows an
elevation of ploidy when there is mixing of nuclear genomes during incomplete extrusion of the maternal
nuclear genome [19,45,46].
- Androgenetic species: the pitfall of mitochondrial
phylogenies

Several studies revealed mitochondrial/morphotype discrepancies in populations of Corbicula where distinct
forms live in sympatry ([18,19,42], this study) and
hypothesized that it was the consequence of an androgenetic egg parasitism ([18,19], this study). We would like
to highlight here that this type of mitochondrial capture
could lead to inaccurate species delimitation. The mitochondrial gene tree only traces the maternal lineage and
it is, in the case of androgenesis, misleading for species
relationships. Until now, most phylogenetic studies in
Corbicula have relied mainly or solely on mitochondrial
data, but this can result in the grouping of distinct
nuclear lineages in the same mitochondrial cluster.
Therefore the use of an “integrative taxonomy”
approach as developped here, combining nuclear and
mitochondrial data along with morphology, is essential
to verify the phylogenetic relationships within androgenetic taxa such as Corbicula. Moreover, we suggest that
due to these peculiar hybridization events between
lineages as a consequence of an androgenetic mode of
reproduction, invasive European Corbicula should be
considered as a polymorphic species complex including
three distinct clusters. For example, the European form
S and the American form C have the same COI
sequence but appear very different on the basis of shell
morphology compared to pictures of form C from Lee
et al. [18]. The observed differences in shell shapes
could be related to phenotypic plasticity, but alternatively, forms S and C could also belong to distinct
nuclear lineages sharing the same mitochondrial DNA
through androgenesis. The same hypothesis seems confirmed by preliminary results in the COI cluster “form B
- form Rlc”. These morphs can easily be distinguished:
the form B from the Americas has a deep purple inner
shell surface while the form Rlc from Europe has a whitish inner shell surface. The assessment of cross-amplification of microsatellite loci in American forms revealed
that form B and form Rlc have distinct genotypes [51].
They therefore belong to distinct clusters at the nuclear
level.

Conclusions
The three different morphotypes of Corbicula found in
Europe are clearly distinct at the mitochondrial and
nuclear level. The European form S seems related to
C. fluminalis on the basis of morphology while mitochondrial data suggest that forms R and Rlc are derived
from the androgenetic C. leana and C. fluminea respectively. However this taxonomic assignment remains
uncertain and, due to the weak phylogenetic signal
among freshwater Corbicula, these could be considered
as a polymorphic species complex. Moreover, species
delineation in Corbicula is even more complicated since
we have to take into account the possibility of androgenesis and egg capture between the different morphotypes as observed in this study for two individuals.
Hedtke et al. [19] also demonstrated that nuclear
exchange is possible and that the nuclear DNA of the
American Corbicula form B originated from hybridization of separate nuclear lineages. As a consequence,
taxonomic assignment in androgenetic lineages based on
mitochondrial phylogeny only may be biased, and using
an “integrative taxonomy” approach combining nuclear
and mitochondrial data along with morphology may at
least avoid the pitfall of pooling divergent evolutionary
nuclear lineages. We therefore recommend using the
proposed nomenclature form R, form S and form Rlc
for convenience in differentiating the three invasive European Corbicula lineages.
Furthermore our phylogeny highlights that the cosmopolitan, invasive forms of Corbicula have identical or
closely related haplotypes and seem to be androgenetic
while the sexual, dioecious lineages seem restricted to
the native Asian areas. Androgenesis would thus play an
important role in the invasive success of Corbicula
clams, especially because they are hermaphrodites and
capable of self-fertilization.
Methods
Specimen collection

Live specimens were collected from 23 localities in the
Meuse river in France, Belgium and the Netherlands
(Table 3), and from one site in the Seine river in France
(Table 4). Additional specimens from one locality in the
Rhine and one in the Rhône were obtained (Table 4). Specimens were immediately processed or preserved in 96%
ethanol prior to analysis. Individuals from the Meuse and
Seine rivers were collected in fish bypasses with a handnet
or directly from the river bottom with a handnet, or dug
out from the sediment with an Eckman dredge.
Morphological analysis

The shell morphology of the different morphs from
Meuse, Rhine, Rhône and Seine rivers was analysed. The
shells of 429 individuals were measured for length (L),

Page 12 of 15

height (H) and width (W) with a calliper: “L” is the
maximal anteroposterior dimension, “H” is the maximal
dorsoventral dimension and “W” is the maximal width
of the valves. We also included published measurements
of the lectotypes of C. fluminea and C. fluminalis [20]
and of the original description of C. leana [26]. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out using
the table of the three morphometric ratios (H/L, H/W
and L/W). Calculations were performed and graphics
drawn using R software with the ade4 package [66]. The
function “dudi.pca” was used to apply the PCA to the
correlation matrix. Scores from axis 1 were plotted
against those from axis 2, each point was identified
individually.
Sperm morphology

Biflagellate sperm is indicative of androgenesis in the
genus Corbicula [15,16,18]. We analysed the sperm
morphology of specimens of form R (Meuse, N = 4),
form S (Rhine and Seine, N = 5) and form Rlc (Rhône,
N = 3). To isolate and observe the spermatozoa, a protocol was adapted from several studies [67-69]. The
individuals preserved in absolute ethanol were opened
and the visceral mass, which includes the gonads, was
cut. The tissue was collected in a tube and collagenase
resuspended in RPMI was added (final concentration: 1
mg/l). The tissue was sheared and collagenase-RPMI
mix was added to a final volume of 600 μl. The preparation was then incubated at 45°C until complete degradation. The samples were centrifuged during 3 minutes at
3000 rpm. One drop of the undernatant was put on a
glass slide and observed under a light microscope at
100× magnification.
Gene amplification and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the adductor
muscles or the foot of 215 individual specimens (fresh
or preserved in 96% ethanol) using the DNeasy blood &
tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A fragment of 710 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and a fragment
(430 bp) of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using the primers LCOI490 and HCO2198 [70] and, UCYTB151F
and UCYTB270R, respectively [71]. Amplifications were
performed in 25 μl total volume including 0.5 μl of
gDNA, 1× GoTaq Green reaction buffer (Promega), 200
μM of dNTPs (Promega), 0.5 μM of both primers and
0.1 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR conditions were: 4 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 45
s at 94°C, 45 s at annealing temperature (45 °C for COI
and 42°C for cyt b) and 45 s at 72°C, and then a final
extension of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were purified and sequenced with each universal primer on an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/147

automated ABI3730XL Genetic Analyzer (Macrogen
Inc.). COI and cyt b sequences were deposited in
GenBank [GU721082-GU721084; JF518976-JF518978].
Sequences were visualized and aligned using BioEdit
7.0.5.3 [72].
Phylogenetic analyses (COI)

The evolutionary model for the phylogenetic analysis of
COI sequences was selected using jModelTest 0.1 software [73]. Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed
with PhyML 2.4.5 software and bootstrap values were
obtained for 1,000 replicates [74]. A Bayesian Inference
(BI) analysis was performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [75].
We ran four independent analyses with four Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) each, for 4 million generations. Trees and parameters were sampled every 100
generations. To ensure stabilization, we discarded the
first 25% of sampled trees. The remaining trees were
used to compute a consensus tree. The split frequency
was below 0.01. For all analyses, published COI
sequence of Neocorbicula limosa was used as an outgroup. A total of 54 sequences from several Corbicula
lineages available on GenBank were included (origins in
Table 1). Trees were visualized using MEGA4 [76].
Microsatellite study

We used eleven microsatellite loci described in Pigneur
et al. [51] to analyze individuals of the three observed
European morphotypes (see Table 5 for the number of
tested individuals). Regarding the samples from the
Meuse, Rhône and Rhine, the individuals analyzed in the
present study are different from those used in Pigneur et
al. [65]. For each locus, the amplification was performed
in 10 μl total volume including 0.5 μl of gDNA, 1×
GoTaq reaction buffer (Promega), 200 μM of dNTPs
(Promega), 0.5 μM of both primers and 0.1 U of GoTaq
DNA polymerase (Promega). The forward primers were
5’ fluorescently labelled and fitted with a GTTTCTT
PIG-tail. Amplification by PCR was performed as follows:
4 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles: 45 s at 94°C, annealing for 45 s and 72°C for 45 s, and then a final extension
of 12 min at 72°C. The fragments were analysed on an
ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer with GeneScan-500 (LIZ)
size standard (Applied Biosystems). Results were visualized using GENEMAPPER software (Applied Biosystems). Additionally, the microsatellite results were
analyzed using Bayesian clustering with the STRUCTURE
software version 2.0 [77] to define the number of categories (K) of individuals. STRUCTURE was run for 10
repetitions of each K from 1 to 5 assuming admixture.
Analysis was performed using a burn-in period of 50,000
followed by 200,000 MCMC repetitions.
