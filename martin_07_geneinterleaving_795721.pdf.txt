Abstract
Background: Recent comparative genomic studies claim local syntenic gene-interleaving
relationships in Ashbya gossypii and Kluyveromyces waltii are compelling evidence for an ancient
whole-genome duplication event in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We here test, using HannenhalliPevzner rearrangement algorithms that address the multiple genome rearrangement problem,
whether syntenic patterns are proof of paleopolyploidization.
Results: We focus on (1) pairwise comparison of gene arrangement sequences in A. gossypii and S.
cerevisiae, (2) reconstruction of gene arrangements ancestral to A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii,
(3) synteny patterns arising within and between lineages, and (4) expected gene orientation of
duplicate gene sets. The existence of syntenic patterns between ancestral gene sets and A. gossypii,
S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii, and other evidence, suggests that gene-interleaving relationships are the
natural consequence of topological rearrangements in chromosomes and that a more gradual
scenario of genome evolution involving segmental duplication and recombination constitutes a
more parsimonious explanation. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees reconstructed under alternative
hypotheses placed the putative whole-genome duplication event after the divergence of the S.
cerevisiae and K. waltii lineages, but in the lineage leading to K. waltii. This is clearly incompatible with
an ancient genome duplication event in S. cerevisiae.
Conclusion: Because the presence of syntenic patterns appears to be a condition that is
necessary, but not sufficient, to support the existence of the whole-genome duplication event, our
results prompt careful re-evaluation of paleopolyploidization in the yeast lineage and the
evolutionary meaning of syntenic patterns.

Background
The existence of an ancient whole-genome duplication
(WGD) event in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1] has been
debated over the past several years. WGD followed by
massive gene loss could explain duplicated genes that are
interspersed throughout the genome and syntenic relationships with other hemiascomycete yeasts [2-4]. An
alternative view is that evolution proceeded gradually
through segmental chromosomal duplications that
occurred independently, sometimes massively, and were
extensively shuffled by recombination [5-10]. Dietrich et
al. [11] recently sequenced the Ashbya gossypii genome and
in a comparative exercise claim their results provide compelling evidence supporting either WGD or a genomic
fusion between related species (i.e. a paleopolyploidization) during the early evolution of S. cerevisiae. A similar
claim comes from the Kluyveromyces waltii genome
sequence [12]. In both studies, regions of 'double synteny'
(DS) were identified in which single genes or groups of
genes expressed homology relationships with alternating
chromosomal regions of S. cerevisiae. This evidence was
interpreted as proof of the WGD scenario, and syntenic
patterns were considered an indication of the gene order
of the most recent common ancestor.
The A. gossypii genome is extremely compact, with seven
chromosomes encoding 4,966 protein and RNA molecules [11]. It contains rare gene duplications, only 221
introns, and no transposons of subtelomeric repeats.
Although the vast majority of protein-encoding genes
(95%) show homology to S. cerevisiae genes, only ~10%
are gene duplicates in DS patterns. Consequently, the
WGD scenario requires that almost an entire gene complement be deleted, and that deletion within regions
(termed 'blocks') establishing DS patterns proceed with
precision and without leaving massive evidence of relics
(gene remnants) or pseudogenes (Fig. 1A). This appears to
be unlikely. Recent gene sequence-decay compilations in
intergenic regions of S. cerevisiae have identified only: (i)
221 disabled open reading frames (ORFs) with middlesequence frameshifts and premature stop codons (about
3% of the proteome; [13]), and (ii) 278 pseudogenes,
including 124 highly degenerated gene remnants termed
relics [6], many of which were intermingled with ancestral
blocks of duplication [14]. Relics comprising 3% of intergenic regions matched only six over-represented and two
under-represented PROSITE motifs (out of 1,319 patterns) in intergenic regions, suggesting pseudomotifs are
remnants of very ancient S. cerevisiae genes [15]. Moreover, there are 24 triplicated genes (~0.5%) homologous to
A. gossypii out of 496 duplicated homologues in S. cerevisiae [11]. These numbers approach the expected Poisson
distribution, suggesting that some of the duplicated
regions were subjected to additional duplications in the
course of evolution. Furthermore, Kellis et al. [12] also

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

found triplicated regions in K. waltii; ~1% of the genome
lies in segments that match three or more regions in S. cerevisiae.
We believe that the proposal of a massive WGD in the
yeast lineage based solely on the evidence of interleaving
patterns in sister regions (i.e., DS) is unwarranted and that
DS events are more likely a natural topological consequence of a more gradual process of rearrangement within
and between chromosomes. Under this evolutionary scenario, gene duplicates originate from partial genome
duplication (PGD) events that are local and/or segmental
in nature and distribute in time throughout lineages. To
test if PGD is more parsimonious than the WGD scenario,
we here use Hannenhalli-Pevzner polynomial-time algorithms to transform a numeric representation of one
genomic complement into another by rearrangement and
to reconstruct ancestral chromosomal complements of
genes.

Results
Pairwise comparison of gene arrangements in A. gossypii
and S. cerevisiae
We estimated, under the competing PGD and WGD models, the minimum number of evolutionary steps needed to
convert an arrangement of genes in A. gossypii into the corresponding arrangement in S. cerevisiae (see Methods for
details). For PGD, we first duplicated genes in tandem and
then proceeded to rearrange chromosomal segments. For
WGD, we duplicated the entire gene dataset, deleted genes
in blocks or individually, and rearranged the resulting segments. The exercise was done using a number of A. gossypii
syntenic blocks, including DS block 7 (ORFs AAL119W to
AAL087C; Fig. 1A) and DS block 9 (ORFs AAL030C to
AAR004C; data not shown), both typical examples of DS
in chromosome I (see Figs. 1 and 2 in [11]). Syntenic relationships related to the entire A. gossypii chromosome I
were also analyzed (Fig. 1B). In all cases examined, we
found PGD was more parsimonious than WGD. A total of
23 steps were needed to transform A. gossypii DS block 7
into S. cerevisiae chromosome XV and XVI segments under
PGD, and 24–36 steps under WGD (Fig. 1A). A total of 30
steps (6 tandem gene duplications and 24 rearrangements) were needed to transform DS block 9 containing
the centromere of A. gossypii chromosome I into S. cerevisiae chromosome III, VII, XII, and XIV segments under
PGD, and 37–45 steps (1 segment duplication, 18–26
deletions, and 18 rearrangements) under WGD. Similarly,
the transformation of A. gossypii chromosome I into 15 S.
cerevisiae chromosomal segments required 293 steps
under PGD or 405–499 steps under WGD (Fig. 1B).
Clearly, the difference in parsimony scores between PGD
and WGD widens as the sampling becomes more inclusive. Consequently, we expect that a complete analysis of
syntenic relationships in the genome of A. gossypii will

Comparison of WGD and PGD scenarios in A. gossypii DS block 7 (A) and chromosome I (B). A. gossypii genes and
gene segments with homologues in S. cerevisiae chromosomes (shown with different colors) are transformed into corresponding S. cerevisiae chromosomal segments. When extending results to the entire genome, these segments need to be rearranged
into complete S. cerevisiae chromosomes. Arrows with numbers in A represent ORFs and their orientation, and are highlighted
in black when subject to duplication or rearrangement. Terminal rearrangements are indicated by arrows. Vertical lines in B
represent duplications. The absence of S. cerevisiae chromosome I homologues of A. gossypii chromosome I genes is surprising,
given the high levels of rearrangement observed. This suggests biases in synteny that are incompatible with the WGD scenario.

either maintain or broaden the advantage of PGD in parsimony scores. Results therefore underscore the importance of genomic context in comparative analyses.

Impact of weighting schemes
We also used weighting schemes a posteriori that consider
possible differences in 'effective' rates between duplications, deletions, and rearrangements that occurred since

Figure weighting schemes on parsimony analysis
Effect of2
Effect of weighting schemes on parsimony analysis. A.
Decreasing the weight of deletions has limited effect on parsimony scores supporting the WGD hypothesis. B. Decreasing the weight of genome duplication (relative to the weight
of observed gene duplications) renders the WGD scenario
possible only if entire genome duplications are considered
relatively common events, i.e., occurring at frequencies about
an order of magnitude lower than gene duplications. Circles

evolutionary scenarios. WGD scores are given within a range
delimited by considering deletions of genes individually or in
blocks.

the divergence between S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii. However, we found that weighting always renders an implausible scenario for WGD when paleopolyploidization
events are considered rare (Fig. 2).
Weighted parsimony analyses of A. gossypii chromosome I
synteny data again suggest WGD is less parsimonious
(SWGD = ~1.2–1.3 weighted steps) than PGD (SPGD = ~0.3

weighted steps). PGD remains always the preferred scenario (Fig. 2A), even if the probability of a deletion is considered many orders of magnitude greater than that of a
rearrangement (as recently argued by Gu and Huang
[16]). Only unlikely scenarios will favor WGD. For example, WGD will be more parsimonious than PGD if WGD
events occur about an order of magnitude less frequently
than gene duplications (i.e., with wWGD <0.057) and only
when deletions occur in blocks (Fig. 2B). We believe this
is unrealistic. Few gene duplicates exist and large tracts of
duplicated segments are not present in yeast to warrant
exceedingly high rates of paleopolyploidization.
Phylogenetic analysis of gene arrangements in A. gossypii,
S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii and reconstruction of a
common ancestor
Phylogenetic analysis of chromosomal rearrangements in
multiple genomes permits the reconstruction of common
ancestors and estimation of the number of evolutionary
steps that separate ancestors from extant gene complements. These measures were used to test the PGD and
WGD hypotheses under more realistic conditions.

We first used the set of genes present in A. gossypii chromosome I to reconstruct a gene arrangement that was ancestral to arrangements of homologous genes in A. gossypii, S.
cerevisiae, and K. waltii (Fig. 3). Genes that were not shared
by the three genomes, including those that were duplicated, had to be removed from further analysis. The reconstructed common ancestor had eight chromosomal
segments. Interestingly, gene-interleaving patterns of
ancestral chromosomal segments arose naturally and
were clearly visible in A. gossypii (Fig. 3), suggesting DS
patterns arise in the absence of a WGD. These patterns
were present in about 70% of A. gossypii chromosome I.
DS patterns were also visible in S. cerevisiae and K. waltii.
We also calculated the number of steps between the ancestor and the extant gene arrangements under the PGD or
WGD hypotheses (Table 1; Fig. 3A). Under the PGD scenario, there were a total of 195, 125, and 104 steps
between the ancestor and either A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, or
K. waltii, respectively. Under the WGD scenario, there
were a total of 422, 270, and 346 steps between the common ancestor and either A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, or K.
waltii, respectively. These results indicate that the PGD
scenario is more parsimonious than WGD in all lineages
(tree length = 424 steps) (Fig. 3B). However, reconstructed trees under a WGD hypothesis had 651, 645, and
590 minimal steps when the WGD event was placed in the
A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii lineages, respectively
(Fig. 3B). Consequently, the WGD scenario was considerably more likely in the lineage leading to K. waltii. There
were also two interesting observations: (1) A similar
number of steps transformed the ancestor into S. cerevisiae
and K. waltii under WGD and PGD scenarios, respectively,

and (2) S. cerevisiae and K. waltii were evolutionarily
closer to the common ancestor than A. gossypii. Chromosome I was therefore similarly rearranged in these two lineages. Interestingly, when we use the minimum number
of deletions needed to establish gene-interleaving relationships under the WGD hypothesis as an indicator of
the complexity of DS patterns, we find that the number of
deletions was similar in lineages leading to S. cerevisiae
and K. waltii. This suggests that DS patterns in K. waltii are
as abundant as those in S. cerevisiae.
We then focused on individual DS blocks, using data from
the ancestor of the entire A. gossypii chomosome I to
reconstruct alternative evolutionary scenarios in lineages
leading to extant species. Figure 4 illustrates the approach
using A. gossypii DS block 13 (AAR069-AAR043) (see Fig.
3 of Dietrich et al. 2004). This region defines one of several gene-interleaving relationships in A. gossypii describing synteny with ancestral chromosomal segments (pinkand-blue interleaving pattern in Fig. 3). We transformed
DS block 13 in A. gossypii into the ancestor and then transformed this ancestral gene arrangement into the S. cerevisiae counterpart under competing WGD and PGD
hypotheses (Fig. 4A), considering only the most parsimonious alternative under each scenario (Fig. 4B). Again, we
find PGD was always more parsimonious than WGD. It is
noteworthy however, that the DS pattern under WGD
arose only in the lineage leading from the ancestor to A.
gossypii (with 6 minimum deletions) and not in the lineage leading from the ancestor to S. cerevisiae. This strongly
suggests that the gene-interleaving pattern in DS block 13
did not originate by the proposed WGD after the divergence of S. cerevisiae and K. waltii, but did so earlier.
Figure 5 illustrates how synteny patterns arise within lineages using A. gossypii DS block 7 (analyzed in Fig. 1A) as
an example. In this analysis, A. gossypii genes 7 (AAL112),
12 (AAL107) and 27 (AAL092) had no orthologs in K.
waltii and had to be removed. The common ancestor of
this block fell within a single chromosomal segment, and

the number of steps between the ancestor and extant
sequences of genes in S. cerevisiae and K. waltii was calculated under the two alternative hypotheses (Fig. 5A).
Under PGD, the number of steps between the common
ancestor and A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii was 15,
6, and 15, respectively. Under WGD, 19–42, 16–36, and
24–38 steps separated the ancestor and extant species,
respectively. The minimum number of deletions needed
to establish a syntenic pattern in A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae,
and K. waltii was 9, 6 and 15, respectively. This indicates
that the interleaving patterns of DS block 7 were more
structured in S. cerevisiae and K. waltii than in A. gossypii. It
is noteworthy however, that the most parsimonious scenario for the existence of a WGD places the event in the A.
gossypii lineage with 25–48 total steps from A. gossypii to S.
cerevisiae and a minimum tree length of 40 steps (Fig. 5B).
In turn, placing the WGD event in the S. cerevisiae or K.
waltii lineage was less parsimonious and required 31–51
steps from A. gossypii to S. cerevisiae and 39–53 steps from
A. gossypii to K. waltii. The resulting trees had lengths of 45
and 46 minimum steps, respectively. Consequently, lineages leading from the common ancestor of the entire
clade (indicated putatively with an arrowhead in Fig. 5) to
S. cerevisiae should be the largest contributors to the putative WGD event (involving less than 25 evolutionary
steps) and corresponding DS pattern (involving less than
6 minimum deletions). Results suggest again that PGD is
more likely than WGD and that the most parsimonious
explanation of the existence of the WGD event is that it
occurred before the divergence of the S. cerevisiae and K.
waltii lineages.
Orientation of duplicate genes in S. cerevisiae with
respect to A. gossypii
We also analyzed the reading orientation relative to the
centromere of the 47 genes present in A. gossypii chromosome I that were duplicated in S. cerevisiae. It is expected
that without rearrangement, duplicated Watson-oriented
genes placed at the left of the centromere and Crick-oriented genes placed at the right of the centromere would be

Phylogenetic analysis of chromosomal rearrangement in A. gossypii chromosome I and gene segments with
homologues in S. cerevisiae and K. waltii chromosomes (A) and tree reconstructions under alternative WGD
models (B). The common ancestral gene arrangement sequence of A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii (containing eight segments) was reconstructed (open circle) and genes were transformed into corresponding chromosomal segments (see Fig. 1).
Thus, the common ancestral gene sequences embedded in the 8 chromosomal segments of the ancestor were tracked through
the corresponding extant sequences of A. gossypii, S. cerevisiae, and K. waltii. Visual inspection reveals interleaving arrangements
of differently colored segments. A detailed analysis of gene order and orientation confirms these interleaving arrangements are
synteny patterns. The reconstruction of an ancestor allowed evaluation of which of the competing hypotheses (WGD and
PGD) was more parsimonious in lineages leading to extant species. Note that the branches of the trees do not reflect actual
lengths, the arrowhead shows the root of the tree based on Kurtzman and Robnett [47], and the star identifies the branch in
which the putative WGD occurred [1,12]. The star is also used to indicate the branch defining alternative WGD scenarios.

Phylogenetic analysis of A. gossypii DS block 13. A. Three chromosomal segments homologous to this syntenic region
and derived from the phylogenetic reconstruction exercise described in Figure 3 were found to be ancestral to A. gossypii, S.
cerevisiae, and K. waltii. They are labeled with greek letters. The arrangement of genes in A. gossypii DS block 13 was transformed into the three ancestral chromosomal segments and these were then transformed into corresponding chromosomal
segments in S. cerevisiae, invoking both the WGD and PGD evolutionary scenarios. Under WGD, deletions were those that
produced the most parsimonious scenario. The minimum number of deletions needed to produce a DS pattern in S. cerevisiae
was considered to be 1, and not 3, because there was no guarantee that three chromosomal segments were not part of a single chromosome. B. Because under the WGD scenario we first duplicate the entire gene complement and then proceed to
delete and rearrange genes, direction of change in lineages is important. The figure shows alternative WGD reconstructions
used to select the most parsimonious WGD scenarios shown in A.

read towards the direction of the centromere in S. cerevisiae. Left and right are here defined relative to the 5' and 3'
ends of the chromosomal sequence, respectively. Conversely, duplicated Crick-oriented genes placed at the left
of the centromere and Watson-oriented genes placed at
the right of the centromere would be read against the
direction of the centromere. Any departures from this
expectation would signal the occurrence of gene rearrangement.
When we compared changes in the reading orientation of
genes in chromosome I of A. gossypii, there were 28 and 19
Watson-oriented and Crick-oriented genes, respectively,
and these were duplicated into 45 and 49 Watson and
Crick genes in S. cerevisiae, respectively. The analyses
showed there were a total of 49 changes of gene orientation. We also found that there were 23 and 24 genes
placed at the left and right of the centromere for A. gossypii,
respectively. After the duplication, there were 24 and 70
genes placed at the left and right of the centromere for S.
cerevisiae, respectively. Therefore, there were 36 changes in
the position of the genes with respect to the centromere
and genes placed at the left side of the centromere
changed their position more often than those at the right.
We also analyzed how gene orientation changed with
respect to the centromere. In A. gossypii, there were 21 and
26 genes that were read against and toward the centromere, respectively. After gene duplication, there were 49
and 45 genes that were read against and toward the centromere in S. cerevisiae, respectively. However, our analysis finds that a total of 51 duplicated genes in S. cerevisiae
changed their orientation with respect to the centromere.

Discussion
Gene-interleaving patterns of synteny established
between S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii [11] and between S.
cerevisiae and K. waltii [12] were recently used to support
the existence of paleopolyploidization in the yeast lineage. In both of these studies, DS patterns were considered
the signature and proof of WGD. However, there were no
attempts to evaluate alternative evolutionary models that
would explain the DS patterns, and there were no efforts
to weight differentially the genome duplication event and
the massive loss of duplicated genes necessary to explain
the existence of a relatively small number (only 10%) of
duplicated genes in the S. cerevisiae genome. Using Hannenhalli-Pevzner rearrangement algorithms that address
the multiple genome rearrangement problem [17], we
here suggest that DS patterns are the natural consequence
of topological rearrangements in chromosomes and that a
more gradual PGD scenario of genome evolution involving segmental duplication and recombination constitutes
a more parsimonious explanation of gene order in the
yeast lineage. Four lines of evidence are used here to test if

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

DS patterns are necessary and sufficient conditions for the
occurrence of WGD in yeast: (1) pairwise comparison of
gene arrangements, (2) reconstruction of ancestral gene
arrangements, (3) synteny patterns arising within and
between lineages, and (4) expected gene orientation of
duplicate gene sets. As with previous analyses that claim
DS patterns support the WGD hypothesis [11,12], our
phylogenetic studies do not weight the occurrence of rearrangements and other evolutionary processes, since we do
not know the rate of these events in the wild and over evolutionary time. Finding these weights represents an
extremely challenging task [18].
Pairwise comparison of gene arrangements
A direct pairwise comparison of gene arrangements from
S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii converted one arrangement
into another and produced unweighted parsimony scores
that falsified the WGD hypothesis in favor of the gradual
evolutionary scenario (Fig. 1). Differential weighting of
parsimony scores under more realistic evolutionary
assumptions also falsified the WGD scenario (Fig. 2).
Decreasing the weight of deletions (relative to rearrangements) had limited effect on parsimony scores supporting
the WGD hypothesis. Similarly, decreasing the weight of
the genome duplication supported the WGD scenario
only at unusually high genome duplication frequencies
(an order of magnitude lower than gene duplications).

It could be argued that strongly penalizing the WGD event
can bias the analysis. However, there are reasons to
believe yeast paleoploidization is a rare event [18]. Polyploid lines exhibit high levels of chromosome instability
[19,20] while segmental duplications are rare, but occur
frequently over evolutionary time [9,18]. In fact, according to the WGD hypothesis, paleopolyploidization
occurred once in the history of hemiascomycete fungi
[10], possibly after the divergence of the S. cerevisiae and
K. waltii lineages [1,12]. The fact that a small fraction of
genes in yeast are duplicated and that there are few relics
or pseudogenes that were left behind [12-15] suggests
polyploidization and gene deletion events occur at low
evolutionary frequencies in yeast. The existence of polyploid strains of yeast resulting from defects in mitosis or
interspecific mating need not detract from this argument
because we have limited understanding of the long-term
stability of these lines. Gene deletion should also be
regarded a slow process. In many cases, more than half of
gene pairs are retained over tens of millions of years following genomic doubling [21], though instantaneous
rates of deletion could be higher immediately following
events of duplication.
In our studies, unweighted parsimony analysis should be
considered a more conservative 'falsification' tool that
eliminates assumptions introduced by weighting

Biology Direct 2007, 2:23

schemes, especially because the estimation of weights
from incidence values may be misleading. Estimating
actual rates of duplication, recombination, and deletion
during the 100 Myr of evolution encompassing the putative WGD event constitutes a difficult proposition, especially because rates vary with time. For example, gene
duplicates arise at high rates in yeast, about 0.0083 per
gene per Myr, but the process varies with the level of
sequence divergence and is counteracted by the relatively
short half-life of individual genes (~4 Myr) due to active
gene silencing and loss [22,23].
It could be argued that conservation of gene order in DS
patterns, the cornerstone of the WGD hypothesis, cannot
be explained by the PGD scenario. For example, rearranging A. gossypii chromosomes by their very nature perturbs
the original gene order evident in the genome decreasing
considerably the a priori probability of obtaining similar
patterns by rearrangement in other genomes (e.g., in S.
cerevisiae). Following this argument, DS patterns under
the PGD hypothesis would ultimately arise as a consequence of a highly fortuitous and unlikely sequence of
rearrangement events. This frequentist argument is fallacious under the light of evolution, and ultimately critiques the unrealistic and unidimensional nature of
pairwise gene arrangement analysis, in which one extant
genome transforms into another. Gene arrangements
arise from a common ancestor, and a valid comparison of
contemporary genomic patterns has only value if supported by phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral gene
arrangements. For example, the number of shared traits in
lineages increases with decreases in taxonomic distance.
Extensive sharing of traits in closely related lineages could
be erroneously interpreted as a highly fortuitous and
unlikely sequence of events. However, traits arise by common descent with modification, with changes accumulating gradually according to some model (e.g., WGD or
PGD scenarios) and resulting in evolutionary patterns
adequately revealed by modern phylogenetic analysis. In
this regard, gene arrangements are not different from any
other trait, whether these are molecular, biochemical, or
morphological. We here contend that DS patterns arise as
the result of gradual change in evolutionary lineages and
should be regarded as shared and derived features that were
inherited from an ancestor and not as fortuitous and
unlikely events.
Phylogenetic analysis of multiple genome arrangements
The pairwise comparison of gene arrangements previously
used is grounded in phylogenetic analysis but does not
assume the existence of a phylogenetic tree. To compare
evolutionary hypotheses under more realistic conditions,
we used the multiple genome rearrangement algorithm in
GRIMM to generate a phylogenetic tree and reconstruct
ancestors (Fig. 3). The algorithm evaluates, for example,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

all possible chromosomal reversals for a set of genome
complements, selecting those 'good' reversals that bring
all genomes closer to the ancestral genome and iterating
the procedure until all genomes are transformed into it
[17]. The reversal distance should be considered a good
approximation of the true distance for many biologically
relevant cases, and is currently widely used in the analyses
of genome rearrangements [24]. GRIMM was recently
used to reconstruct an ancestral murid genome using the
human, mouse, and rat genomes [25] and to analyze
mammalian chromosome evolution in a multi-species
phylogenomic comparison [26].
We attempted a rearrangement analysis of multiple
genomes but this was not possible because of the high levels of recombination present in hemiascomycete yeasts
(N. Martin, unpublished data). Despite computational
limitations, we built a phylogeny describing the evolution
of genes present in A. gossypii chromosome I along the S.
cerevisiae, K. waltii, and A. gossypii lineages, reconstructing
a gene arrangement that was present in the common
ancestor to these species (Fig. 3). Transforming the
arrangement of genes in the ancestor into arrangements in
extant species under competing PGD and WGD hypotheses again falsified the paleopolyploidization event (Table
1; Fig. 3). As with pairwise analysis, PGD was always more
parsimonious than the WGD scenario.
Interestingly, the minimal number of deletions needed to
establish gene-interleaving patterns with the ancestor
under WGD was comparable in the lineages leading to S.
cerevisiae and K. waltii. This suggests these two genomes
had DS patterns that were similarly structured. In fact,
interleaving patterns of ancestral chromosomal segments
were clearly visible in contiguous fragments of all three
extant genomes analyzed, visualized as interleaving
arrangements of differently colored segments in Figure 3.
In particular, DS patterns could be detected in about 70%
of chromosomal regions of chromosome I in A. gossypii.
Consequently, gene-interleaving patterns cannot be considered an exclusive property of lineages that have undergone a WGD.
Synteny patterns arising within and among lineages
According to the WGD hypothesis, paleopolyploidization
occurred after the divergence of the S. cerevisiae and K.
waltii lineages [1,12]. In fact, DS patterns arising from the
comparisons of S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii [11] and S. cerevisiae and K. waltii [12] genomes were given as irrefutable
proof of paleopolyploidization. Consequently, the WGD
event had to occur in the lineage leading to S. cerevisiae
and after the divergence of K. waltii (marked with a star in
Fig. 3) if DS patterns depicted paleopolyploidization
appropriately. However, phylogenetic analyses of gene
orthologues duplicated in S. cerevisiae suggest genes dupli-

Biology Direct 2007, 2:23

cated and/or specialized before the S. cerevisiae and K.
waltii lineages diverged from each other [27]. This is
clearly incompatible with the WGD hypothesis.
The presence of gene-interleaving patterns in the genomes
of the three fungi examined in this study is also incompatible with the WGD hypothesis and suggests patterns of
synteny arise naturally as a result of duplication and rearrangement. To visualize the evolution of individual syntenic patterns, we used the reconstructed ancestral gene
arrangements of A. gossypii chromosome I to study individual DS blocks defined by Dietrich et al. [11]. In these
analyses, small groups of genes present in defined order in
the ancestral complement produced DS patterns between
extant genomic regions in relatively few steps under competing WGD hypotheses. This allowed placement of the
WGD event in alternative branches of the reconstructed
phylogenetic tree, evaluating the placement that is the
most parsimonious.
DS block 13 is one of several synteny blocks in chromosome I of A. gossypii (see Fig. 3 of Dietrich et al. [11]). This
block represents fundamentally an interleaving pattern of
S. cerevisiae chromosome II and XIV segments, though it
also involves chromosome VII. We chose this DS pattern
because it coincides with an interleaving arrangement of
ancestral chromosomal segments in A. gossypii that is illustrated with alternating pink-and-blue colored segments in
Figure 3. Explaining gene order in the common ancestor
under the WGD hypothesis showed the DS pattern arose
in the lineage leading to A. gossypii, before, but not after
the divergence of S. cerevisiae and K. waltii (Fig. 4). This
single example shows not all DS patterns in blocks
reported by Dietrich et al. [11] were involved in the putative WGD.
We also analyzed DS block 7, the example DS pattern
used by Dietrich et al. [11] to illustrate the basis of the
genome duplication model (Fig. 5). Transformation of
the ancestor into extant gene arrangements under competing hypotheses revealed how DS patterns developed in the
making of this syntenic block. Under WGD, interleaving
patterns were less structured but were generated more parsimoniously in the A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae lineages
than in the K. waltii lineage (Fig. 5A). In fact, the most parsimonious explanation of the WGD event proposed to
have occurred in the S. cerevisiae lineage [1] places it in the
lineage that originates in the common ancestor of the
clade (arrowhead) prior to the divergence of the S. cerevisiae and K. waltii ancestors (Fig. 5B).
Since many syntenic patterns mapping onto A. gossypii
chromosome I could be explained by interleaving patterns
occurring early, prior to the divergence of S. cerevisiae and
K. waltii, we extended our comparative approach to the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

entire A. gossypii chromosome I (Figure 3). Surprisingly,
alternative tree reconstructions did not place the WGD
event in the lineage leading to S. cerevisiae as would have
been expected. Instead, the most parsimonious explanation for a genome duplication event was that it occurred
after the divergence of the S. cerevisiae and K. waltii lineages, but in the lineage leading to K. waltii. This is clearly
incompatible with the WGD scenario proposed when
comparing syntenic regions in the genomes of S. cerevisiae
and A. gossypii [11], and S. cerevisiae and K. waltii [12].
Note than in these comparative experiments, it is the
WGD scenario the one that was unable to recover the
paleopolyploidization event in the right branch of the
tree. Arguments of differential weighting of steps cannot
be brought to question these results, which are ultimately
based on the syntenic relationships and patterns that have
been used to support the WGD hypothesis in pairwise
analyses [11,12]. We focus here exclusively on the
genomes that were used to postulate DS patterns as irrefutable proof of the ancient duplication event in yeast.
However, our comparative analyses could be extended to
other genomes that speciated presumably after the WGD
event, such as S. castelli [28].
Overall results therefore confirm that the existence of DS
patterns is a condition that is necessary but not sufficient to
support the existence of paleopolyploidization. Therefore,
caution should be exercised when using DS patterns to
support WGD claims [11,12]. The fact that about 90% of
the S. cerevisiae genome is involved in establishing syntenic relationships with closely related fungi, such as A.
gossypii, cannot be used as proof of ancient tetraploidy
occurring after the divergence of K. waltii and A. gossypii
[11,12], because DS events appear to occur earlier in the
yeast lineage and in other lineages believed to be free of
paleopolyploidization events. DS patterns are therefore
likely to be the direct consequence of chromosomal rearrangement and segmental duplications and to emerge naturally under the more parsimonious PGD scenario. In this
gradual process of change, segmental duplications are
expected to distribute along branches in the tree.
Our results also show that the generation of interleaving
patterns of synteny under a WGD scenario is a complex
process in which chromosomal rearrangement plays an
important role. We still need improved models of rearrangement that incorporate segmental duplication of
extensive regions of the genome. Despite this limitation,
phylogenetic reconstruction experiments here described
falsify the WGD hypothesis as such in favor of a more
gradual evolutionary scenario.

Gene orientation of duplicate gene complements
Wolfe and Shields [1] studied the orientation of duplicated regions (blocks) with respect to the centromere in S.
cerevisiae. These regions were identified by amino acid
sequence similarity. Under a WGD scenario, the expectation was that block orientation would be conserved if
blocks were formed by reciprocal translocations among
duplicate chromosomes. Under a competing PGD scenario, independent rearrangement of blocks would result
in random orientations. Analyses of S. cerevisiae duplicate
regions revealed that 50 out of 55 regions did not change
in orientation and this was given as evidence in support of
a WGD hypothesis driven by "tetraploidy and translocation" [1]. Following this line of reasoning, we analyzed
the orientation relative to the centromere of the 47 genes
in chromosome I of A. gossypii that were duplicated in S.
cerevisiae. In our case, gene orientation defines the orientation of a duplicated region that was not rearranged during the evolutionary time frame considered. There were 49
changes of gene orientation and 36 changes in the position of genes with respect to the centromere. As a result,
there were 51 changes in gene orientation with respect to
the centromere. These changes were substantial (almost
half of duplicates) and support the existence of independent chromosomal rearrangements compatible with the
PGD scenario.

Conclusion
It is true that many diploid species actually represent paleopolyploids. Polyploidy may have occurred in the lineage
of at least 70% of angiosperms [29], and it is clearly a revolutionary and ongoing process in the grasses [30]. We
recently traced the evolution of genome size in lineages of
the grass family and found several instances of genome
size increase, some quite notable, which could be
explained by paleopolyploidization [31]. Plant paleopolyploidy is supported by genomic and phylogenetic analyses [32-34] and may have had an important role in the
origin and evolution of angiosperms [35,36]. However,
the controversial proposal that genome evolution is
mainly driven by WGD [37] and is widespread in vertebrates and fungi has been intensely debated [5,38-40].
Hughes et al. [41] used parsimony criteria and phylogenetic analyses to falsify the existence of ancient genome
duplication events that would structure Hox-bearing
human chromosomes. The validity of using 'parsimony
tests' like these to falsify the WGD hypothesis has been
recently questioned [16,40]. However, statistical considerations failed to disprove the validity of the test and there
was no attempt to measure the actual rearrangement process. This is necessary in order to unravel the actual meaning of synteny patterns.

genomics [42]. The apparent simplicity of the WGD scenario in its ability to explain syntenic relationships in
pairwise comparison is attractive, but can be misleading.
Our studies show that a PGD alternative that involves
only tandem gene duplications and rearrangements is
consistently more parsimonious and explains the order
and directionality of genes in fungal chromosomes.
The WGD scenario seems poorly compatible with analyses of contemporary polyploids that show increased
ploidy is an inherently unstable state. For example, in
recent experiments, autotetraploids of S. cerevisiae had elevated rates of chromosome instability and died rapidly in
stationary phase [20]. In contrast, the PGD scenario certainly matches the dramatic ability of S. cerevisiae to
increase the frequency of chromosomal rearrangements
under environmental stress, a feature that could facilitate
sympatric speciation in starving populations (E. Kroll,
personal communication). It is also compatible with
mitotic and meiotic stability of interchromosomal duplications and direct tandem duplications [9,43]. In contrast,
in these studies, large duplications carried by a supernumerary chromosome were highly unstable.
While more parsimonious, the PGD scenario here proposed does not consider evolutionary contributions from
segmental duplications, events known to be common in
hemiascomycete yeasts [7-10]. We believe the associated
loss of gene duplicates generated from the successive accumulation of segmental duplications should be inferred
from relics left behind by gene decay [13-15] and used in
future evolutionary models.
To conclude, our results disprove the concept that the
existence of DS patterns constitutes compelling evidence
of paleopolyploidization in the S. cerevisiae lineage
[11,12]. A more gradual evolutionary scenario explains
DS patterns more parsimoniously. Under Popperian falsification criteria, our results prompt to restate the null
hypothesis that paleopolyploidization did not occur in
yeasts. However, computational limitations restrict our
analyses to a single chromosome in A. gossypii. This also
limits the falsification test because the corresponding
homologous regions are scattered into many non-consecutive synteny blocks in virtually all chromosomes in S.
cerevisiae and K. waltii. Extension of these studies to entire
genomes, the use of experimentally defined weights for
gene duplication, deletion, and WGD events, and the use
of rearrangement models that allow inclusion of small
and large duplication and deletion events should refine
and extend our conclusions.

A. gossypii, K. waltii, and S. cerevisiae genomes [11,12]
using the Genome Rearrangements In Man and Mouse
(GRIMM) web server [44]. A genome was represented as a
signed permutation of gene numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n spreading over m chromosomes or genome segments, with signs
'+' and '-' indicating the two possible orientations of a
gene (hereafter termed Watson and Crick, respectively).
GRIMM addresses the pairwise genome rearrangement problem using Hannenhalli-Pevzner algorithms that find the
minimum number of rearrangement operations [e.g.,
inversions (reversals), translocations, fissions, and
fusions] necessary to transform one genome into another,
when genomes contain the same gene set and each gene
appears exactly once in a genome. The rearrangement
algorithms have been recently used to study genome rearrangements in the very difficult Campanulaceae cpDNA
dataset [17] and breakpoint reuse in mammalian evolution [26,45,46]. GRIMM does not separate and bring
genes back together in artifactual patterns. GRIMM tries to
explain rearrangements with a minimum number of rearrangement operations. In short segments (e.g., a single
synteny block; Fig. 1A), the operation is restricted and a
pattern of shuffling may appear evident. However, when
examining detailed rearrangement operations in an entire
chromosome, genes change their positions in large
groups, and not as individual localized jumping events.
In our study, we combined rearrangement operations
with duplication and deletion events, we gave all of them
initially the same weight, and we used combined estimates of the minimum number of evolutionary steps
(changes) as parsimony scores in support of the PGD or
WDG scenarios. Under PGD, gene duplications were
forced to occur in tandem, and duplicates were given a
new gene number. Out of all possible duplicate gene combinations in DS blocks, optimal (most parsimonious)
evolutionary scenarios were those that required the least
number of steps. These parsimony scores should be considered conservative estimates. For example, when conducting pairwise analysis of syntenic relationships in A.
gossypii chromosome I, the 47 gene duplicates were randomly assigned to alternative S. cerevisiae segments without attempting optimization. Since some of the 247
possible combinations are expected to be more parsimonious than those arising by random assignment, parsimony scores under PGD should be regarded as
conservative upper bounds. Under WGD, we counted the
deletion of genes that follow the WGD event either in
blocks or individually, prior to rearrangement. Consequently, parsimony scores were given as a range with an
expectation that the most realistic scenario will match
some central tendency. Note that alternative PGD and
WGD scenarios can be proposed in which duplications
and deletions are allowed to occur at different times during rearrangement. Computation of parsimony scores for

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

these alternative scenarios is complex. However, scores
should not differ significantly from those reported, especially if segmental duplications and deletions involve sets
of few genes.
We also weighted the number of rearrangement (r), gene
duplication (d), genome duplication (wgd), and deletion
(del) events a posteriori, to account for possible differences
in the effective rates of these evolutionary processes. Total
weighted parsimony scores (S) representing the WGD
(SWGD) or PGD (SPGD) evolutionary scenarios were calculated according to the general formula
S = wrsr + wdsd + wwgdswgd + wdelsdel
with s representing the number of events and w the relative weights associated with them. Weights were calculated from the actual genomic incidence of these events.
According to the WGD model, polyploidization occurred
once in the history of hemiascomycete fungi [10] and
within the 100 million year (Myr) period since the divergence between S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii. During this
period, about 1,000 rearrangements and 2,000–2,500
deletions had to accompany the WGD event in order to
explain synteny data (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, the PGD scenario suggests that about 300 gene duplications and 1,700
rearrangements occurred during the same period. Weights
for rearrangements (wr = 0.0005–0.001), gene duplications (wd = 0.003), entire genome duplications (wwgd = 1),
and deletions (wdel = 0.0004–0.0005) were used to estimate reference SWGD and SPGD scores, and study how individual weights affected parsimony scores.
Comparing more than two gene arrangement sequences
(referred here as 'gene arrangements') allows reconstruction of a common ancestral arrangement (referred here as
the 'common ancestor') to the gene arrangements analyzed. Reconstruction requires that the gene complement
be shared by all genomes considered. Under competing
PGD and WGD models, we determined the minimum
number of steps needed to convert the arrangement of
shared genes in A. gossypii chromosome I (307 common
genes) of the ancestor of A. gossypii, K. waltii, and S. cerevisiae into the corresponding chromosomal arrangement in
extant species. To achieve this goal, the ancestral arrangement common to A. gossypii, K. waltii, and S. cerevisiae
gene complements was inferred by minimizing the
number of translocations, reversals, fissions, and fusions.
The number of chromosomal rearrangements needed to
generate the ancestor and the genes that were duplicated
defined the number of evolutionary steps separating the
ancestor and the three extant sequences under PGD. We
also estimated the number of steps under the WGD scenario for lineages leading to S. cerevisiae [11] and K. waltii
[12]. Initially we created an entire genome duplication

Page 13 of 22

Biology Direct 2007, 2:23

that was then followed by massive deletions. We assumed
that for every change in order in an extant gene arrangement, a deletion occurred following the WDG event, generating a gene-interleaving pattern. Consequently, the
ancestral arrangement of genes was generally transformed
into two gene arrangements that complemented each
other. By the same token, the ancestor was transformed in
GRIMM to extant S. cerevisiae and K. waltii chromosomal
arrangements. Thus, the parsimony score under WGD
included the global duplication event, subsequent deletions, and rearrangements, excluding the number of gene
duplications. In these analyses, the phylogenetic tree that
was reconstructed was rooted in the branch leading to A.
gossypii according to Kurtzman and Robnett [47].

Montpellier II, France). 21 May 2007

Martin et al. are mistaken. The answer to the question they
pose in their title is "Yes". There are several different lines
of evidence that all support the WGD hypothesis, and the
interleaving pattern is one such line of evidence. I suppose
that one could make the philosophical argument that in
evolution it is impossible to absolutely prove anything,
but the evidence for WGD is so strong that I think that any
reasonable scientist would consider it proven at this stage.
Martin et al. place too much faith in the HannenhalliPevzner algorithm. They ignore the fact that, even though
their PGD model can explain the observed data using
fewer rearrangement steps than the WGD model, the PGD
model requires an exceedingly unrealistic pattern of rearrangements to happen. In order for their model to produce the observed pattern of double conserved synteny
(DCS) interleaving, a bizarre series of nested inversions of
pieces of DNA of progressively increasing size must have
occurred, as I describe in Comment 1 below. There is no

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

known evolutionary mechanism that can produce such a
pattern, and in my opinion this makes the PGD model
untenable, regardless of the results of the HannenhalliPevzner algorithm. Parsimony is not just a question of
how many steps are required, but also whether those steps
are plausible events.
Author's response
We disagree with Dr. Wolfe's statements. As we will elaborate
below, DS patterns of rearrangements under the PGD model
are not "unrealistic" or "bizarre". The generation of these patterns under the PGD hypothesis does not require "a complex
series of events to happen in an orchestrated manner" as the
reviewer suggests. They can be considered the natural consequence of the chromosomal rearrangement process, very much
as genome duplication and selective deletion of genes can be
considered the engines of the WGD model. Even in cases that
involve nested inversions in hot spots of rearrangement, they
can be explained by known biological phenomena (see below).
In fact, two or more simple steps of nested or overlapping inversions (reversals) will produce DS patterns at two ends of the
segments that are being rearranged (Fig. 6). This process is
clearly more parsimonious and plausible than a rare WGD and
many targeted deletions.

In our study, we use algorithmic operations (steps) of chromosomal rearrangement, duplication and deletion to compare the
WGD and PGD hypotheses or to establish in which lineage the
WGD occurred. All operations should be considered plausible
events, as they all represent outcomes of known biological phenomena (e.g. recombination, mutation processes, etc). We use
these operations to challenge the concept that DS patterns constitute irrefutable proof of the WGD model [11,12]by using
Ockham's razor ('Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate'),
a principle of preferring simple explanations in hypotheses to
complex ones. This principle is fundamental to scientific
inquiry. Because the rearrangement process is a critical and
complex problem [42], we use one of the most advanced algorithms known to date to reconstruct rearrangement operations
in genome evolution. The algorithm has been used successfully
for example to study genome rearrangement in mammals [26].
The issue is not to "place faith in the Hannenhalli-Pevzner
algorithm", but to test the validity of WGD versus a null
hypothesis of no WGD with this modern bioinformatic tool. It
turns out that our analysis falsifies the WGD hypothesis and
that under this light, the evidence of paleopolyploidization in
yeast may not be so strong as Dr. Wolfe contends. It now
behooves WGD supporters to find an improved rearrangement
algorithm that does not falsify their model.

nested inversion events to have occurred in each interleaved region

A series6 nested or overlapping inversions produce DS patterns at ends of the rearranged segments
A series of nested or overlapping inversions produce DS patterns at ends of the rearranged segments. Yellow
lines between steps indicate the chromosomal segments that are inverted between rearrangement steps. Note that the complexity of resulting DS patterns is enhanced if genes highlighted in pink or blue result from previous translocations between
chromosomes, or if the inversion process is combined with fissions, fusions and translocations. Moreover, the timing of rearrangement and the lineage in which the rearrangement occurs will further delimit the DS patterns produced. Ultimately, DS
patterns arise from a comparative exercise that is set by the user.

multispecies view of this region using the Yeast Gene
Order Browser [48]. My explanation of this pattern is that
an ancestor of S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, S. castellii and K.
polysporus had a gene order essentially identical to what is
currently seen in A. gossypii, K. waltii and K. lactis. After
WGD in the common ancestor of the first four species,
many genes were deleted. In S. cerevisiae this left the current paired region between chromosomes XV and XVI.
The interleaving pattern was later disrupted slightly by a
subsequent inversion of the region between YPL172C and
YPL176C on chromosome XVI, as marked in Additional
File 1. The left part of Martin et al's Figure 1A describes
this scenario accurately, with 24–36 steps (depending on
the size of the deletions), though I note that the 4 "terminal rearrangements" are actually reciprocal translocations.
The PGD scenario for the same region is summarized in
Martin et al's Figure 1B. They say that it is more parsimonious because the total number of steps is only 23. But the
steps are very strange. In Additional File 2 I show the
details of the 19 rearrangement steps required in this
panel (reconstructed using the GRIMM server, the same
method used by Martin et al.). The 19 steps are a series of

nested inversions, centered on gene 12 and getting progressively larger. They make a series of flip-flop sorting
movements that gradually moves all the red genes to the
left, and all the green genes to the right. Look at how gene
18 ends up beside gene 20. At step 7→8, the link between
genes 18 and 19 is broken by inverting an eight-gene
region (shown by the yellow bar). At the next step, step
8→9, a slightly larger nine-gene region that spans and
extends from the original eight, undergoes reinversion so
that gene 18 is placed beside gene 20, and gene 19 ends
up in the growing red area on the left. In total, in the
course of the 19 steps required under the PGD model,
gene 12 undergoes inversion 19 times; gene 14 is inverted
17 times, gene 16 is inverted 15 times, and so on (see
Additional File 3). I do not know of any evolutionary
mechanism that can result in a nested series of inversions
of progressively increasing size like this. If one made 19
random inversions in this region, it would be exceedingly
unlikely that they would form a nested pattern like this. If
the PGD model is correct, it implies that there were 55 (or
more) central points, such as gene 12 above, that were
continuously inverting and re-inverting, each time carrying a slightly larger region around them, in order to form

Page 15 of 22

Biology Direct 2007, 2:23

the 55 interleaved regions that we now see [1]. Moreover,
each of these whirlpools of inversion managed to perform
the flip-flip sorting process without crashing into the next
whirlpool further along the chromosome; otherwise we
would see triple- or quadruple-interleaving patterns, but
we do not.
Hence I consider the PGD model unparsimonious. It
requires a complex series of events to happen in an
orchestrated manner, with no obvious mechanism, to
produce the synteny relationship between A. gossypii and
S. cerevisiae that we now see. In contrast, the WGD model
requires only one unlikely event (the WGD itself) followed by a lot of very simple events (gene deletions, and
reciprocal translocations at random genomic sites).
On Discussion paragraph 4 (page 8) Martin et al. admit
that it could be argued (as I do) that under the PGD model
the double-synteny patterns "would ultimately arise as a
consequence of a highly fortuitous and unlikely sequence
of rearrangements". I do not understand the basis on
which they then reject this argument as "frequentist" and
fallacious, but they do say that "valid comparisons need to
reconstruct the ancestral gene arrangement first". I show
in comment 2 below that they have failed to reconstruct
the ancestral arrangement correctly.
Author's response
Dr. Wolfe points out appropriately that under PGD and during
rearrangement of A. gossypii DS block 7 (encompassing A. gossypii genes AAL188 to AAL087) a series of nested inversions
centered on gene AAL107 (gene 12 of Additional File 3)
occur. For accuracy, we would like to mention that Additional
files 2and 3describe several different rearrangement operations
besides inversions (reversals). In fact, the optimal transformation of DS block 7 into S. cerevisiae homolog regions involves 6
translocations and one fission, besides the first 12 reversals, and
these operations are not all centered on AAL107. Dr. Wolfe
then critiques the rearrangement patterns of nested inversions
as being unnatural, stating there is no known evolutionary
mechanism that can produce them. This is incorrect. Nested
inversions are common, have functional roles in programmed
gene rearrangement processes in bacteria [49], and occur even
in large tracts for example around bacterial origins of replication [50]or plant chromosomal arms [51]The existence of 'hot
spots' of rearrangements with one end in 'fragile breakage' sites
and another in random locations may be common in mammalian genomes and the result of long regulatory regions and inhomogeneity of gene distribution [46,52]. Besides mammals
[26], the existence of fragile sites has been confirmed in other
genomes, including Drosophila [53], and our knowledge of why
recombination hot spots occur preferentially in certain genomic
regions is expanding and suggest common mechanisms for their
formation and function in eukaryotes [54]. In particular, hot
spots in yeast are not distributed randomly and can be associ-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

ated with transcriptionally active regions, nucleosome excluding sequences, and GC rich chromosomal regions [54].
Consequently, inversion "whirlpools" captured by the rearrangement algorithm at global scale may represent natural phenomena in yeast. Dr. Wolfe also questions the unlikely nature
of having inversion whirlpools occurring in each DS block that
could collide with each other to form triple- or quadruple-interleaving patterns. This concern is again unfounded. As we state
in Methods, when restricting rearrangement analysis to chromosomal segments, patterns of shuffling (the whirlpools) may
appear evident, but such patterns vanish or distribute as the
analysis is extended to the entire chromosome. We thank Dr.
Wolfe for bringing this subject to discussion because it induces
clarification of the importance of genomic context. It is unnatural to perform rearrangement operations in a DS block,
because the algorithm fails to use other genomic regions in more
parsimonious rearrangement scenarios. Consequently, DS
block-specific whirlpools are generally replaced by more global
rearrangement patterns as one encompasses more genomic
sequence around the DS block (culminating with the chromosome containing the block and then the entire genome). To
illustrate this point, we analyzed DS block 7 in conjunction
with neighboring blocks 6 and 8 (encompassing A. gossypii
genes AAL127 to AAL031), together or in isolation (Fig. 7).
Original whirlpool patterns of individual DS blocks disappear
and are replaced by more global rearrangement processes that
involve genes in all three blocks. Rearrangement patterns for
genes in A. gossypii chromosome I become even more global
(Fig. 8). In conclusion, whirlpools do not collide with each
other and the PGD scenario, very much as the WGD model,
involves many simple events that are plausible. In fact, two or
more inversion steps can generate one or two DS blocks in
regions that are terminal to the rearranged fragments (Fig. 6).
Comment 2. The ancestral gene order inferred by Martin
et al. does not make sense
In Figures 3, 4, 5, Martin et al. consider the evolution of
gene orders in S. cerevisiae, A. gossypii and K. waltii from
their common ancestor. To do this, they tried to infer the
gene order that existed in the common ancestor, but they
did not do this correctly. Consider their Figure 5, which
shows the same region that I have shown in Additional
File 1. In this region the A. gossypii and K. waltii gene
orders are essentially identical (see Additional File 1); they
are colinear (the only differences between them are the
absence of a homolog of gene YOR264W in A. gossypii,
and the absence of a homolog of YOR258W in K. waltii).
Therefore, parsimony says that the common ancestor of A.
gossypii and K. waltii had virtually the same gene order as
each of these species has today. Indeed, the same gene
order is also seen in K. lactis (Additional File 1). But Martin et al's Figure 5 shows an ancestor (chromosomal segment alpha) that is 15 steps different from each of K. waltii
and A. gossypii under a PGD model. Their scenario implies
that an identical series of 15 rearrangement steps hap-

Summary of genes rearranged at each step in DS block 6, 7 and 8 or individually in DS block 6 and DS block 8
under the PGD model. As in Additional File 3, we tallied genes that are involved in rearrangement steps of reversals (inversions), transpositions, fissions and fusions and belong to DS blocks 6, 7 and 8 (105 genes, 69 steps), DS block 6 (8 genes, 6
steps) and DS block 8 (60 genes, 37 steps).

pened convergently in both K. waltii and A. gossypii after
they diverged from their common ancestor. This scenario
is so unrealistic that I cannot believe that any of the results
they derive from this ancestral order are accurate.
Author's response
The argument of the reviewer is again faulty and as discussed
above relates to disregard for genomic context. The ancestral
arrangements of genes belonging to DS blocks described in Figures 4 and 5(with segments labeled with greek letters) were
reconstructed from an analysis of the entire A. gossypii chromosome I (Fig. 3) and not from analyses of only genes specific to
the DS blocks in question. The ancestral gene arrangements for
individual DS blocks of A. gossypii chromosome I take into consideration rearrangement operations that are global. Consequently, the steps that better explain evolution of gene order in

DS block 7 based on genes in chromosome I (Fig. 5) are quite
different when only using information in DS block 7-specific
genes, explaining why the ancestor is 15 steps away both from
K. waltii and A. gossypii and not less. No convergent evolutionary processes are needed to explain results because optimal rearrangement scenarios occur more naturally at chromosomal and
not DS block levels.
Comment 3. Other evidence supports the WGD hypothesis
and is incompatible with PGD
Let me mention briefly two other pieces of evidence, apart
from the interleaving pattern, that support the WGD
hypothesis and show how they are incompatible with the
PGD model.

The 246 rearrangement steps necessary to transform A. gossypii chromosome I into chromosomal segments
that are homologous in S. cerevisiae according to the PGD scenario. The diagram was obtained directly from GRIMM.
Black horizontal bars show groups of genes rearranged at each step and are analogous to the yellow bars described in Additional File 2 for DS block 7. Vertical colored lines indicate chromosome segment ends ("caps") and show effect of fusions and
fissions. Chromosomal segments of source and destination genomes are colored as in Figure 1. Note that rearrangements
involving the largest number of genes (bottom of diagram) are roughly centered on the centromere (located at the right hand
side of DS block 9).
(i) In the S. cerevisiae genome, 551 pairs of duplicated
genes are arranged in a pattern where a series of genes in
one region of the genome has a series of paralogs in the
same order in another region [1,38]. Under Martin et al's
PGD model, these 551 pairs originated as independent
tandem duplications. Therefore, if we consider a large
duplicated region such as "Block 34" which contains 13
duplicated pairs [1] in the same order on chromosomes
VII and XVI, the PGD model requires that these identical
orders are the result of convergent evolution. The PGD
model required that after tandem duplication of each of
the 13 genes, the 13 extra copies were moved to new locations and placed in the same order (and relative orientations) as their progenitors. How can that happen? Just by
chance? It is extremely improbable, and the same pattern
is seen in all the duplicated blocks, not just Block 34.
(ii) The conserved orientation of the blocks relative to the
centromeres [1] indicates that they were formed from
larger duplicated blocks (i.e. duplicated whole chromo-

somes) by reciprocal translocation. Under the PGD
model, conservation of block orientation could only happen if a whole chromosome is subjected to a huge number
of nested inversion events of the type described above,
centered on one point (the centromere), so that the genes
first become sorted into two monotonic subsets of the
original order, and then a series of reciprocal translocations occurs. Such a model is not credible. In the last section of Discussion (titled "Gene orientation of duplicate
gene components") Martin et al. discuss this issue but
consider the orientations of individual genes rather than
the orientations of blocks of adjacent genes. The orientation of individual genes is more liable to be affected by
species-specific inversion of small segments of DNA after
the WGD (e.g. the genes that are labeled in parentheses in
Figure 2 of ref. [11]), and so should be less well preserved
after WGD than the overall block orientation. Martin et al.
state (in the same Section) that for S. cerevisiae homologs
of genes on A. gossypii chromosome I, "almost half" of
them show non-conserved transcriptional orientation

with respect to the centromere. The relatively low level of
orientation conservation of homologs of genes on A. gossypii chromosome I is, I believe, a special situation resulting from an unusual series of rearrangements of genes
near the MAT locus. I find that when the whole A. gossypii
genome is considered (520 syntenic-homolog duplicate
gene pairs from Table S3 of ref. [3]), 710 of the 1040 S.
cerevisiae genes (68%) are transcribed in the same orientation relative to the centromere as in A. gossypii (Additional
File 4). This is significantly more than the 50% expected
under the PGD model (P = 10-17 by Fisher test), so falsifying a model of independent gene duplications and relocations.
Author's response
Dr. Wolfe brings to discussion two additional lines of evidence
that are often used in favor of the WGD hypothesis, both of
which are related to the orientation (relative to the centromere)
of duplicated A. gossypii-homologous genes that exist in S. cerevisiae (the 551 pairs listed in Additional File 4).

One argument, originally presented in the comparison between
the S. cerevisiae and K. lactis genomes [1], is that conservation
of order and orientation of duplicated genes in S. cerevisiae
(defining blocks when using three pre-defined criteria) can only
be explained by tetraploidy and reciprocal translocations under
a WGD scenario. Under this argument, alternative scenarios
(e.g. the PGD hypothesis) will require that gene order and orientation of duplicates, exemplified in genes of block 34 [1],
result from convergent evolution. However, definition of blocks,
which can be arbitrary, is unnecessary under our PGD model.
Syntenic gene-interleaving relationships under the PGD model
are the result of genomic rearrangements that occur more parsimoniously and in concert within the larger genomic context.
These rearrangements are difficult to visualize without the help
of rearrangement algorithms, sometimes involve local nested
inversions (Fig. 6), but more generally encompass a gradual
rearrangement of genomic segments of different lengths within
and between chromosomes. These processes do not need nested
centromere-centered inversions followed by sorting in monotonic subsets, as the reviewer contends. These trivial explanations are misleading and do not portrait appropriately the
complex rearrangement process. When considering gene duplications under PGD (arising by independent tandem or segmental duplications), gene orientation should not be made relative
to other genes in a block because gene-interleaving patterns do
not delimit the rearrangement process in a chromosome.
Instead, gene orientation should be studied on a gene-by gene
basis relative to the centromere and to corresponding homologues.
The other argument is statistical. According to the WGD
hypothesis, duplicated genes in S. cerevisiae should preserve
their orientation with respect to the centromere. Dr. Wolfe
agrees that the low level of conservation of gene orientation of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/23

homologs of genes on A. gossypii chromosome I (only 46% of
duplicated pairs preserve their orientation) does not support the
WGD model, but believes this constitutes a special situation
arising from the existence of the MAT locus in chromosome I.
He then states that when considering all 551 duplicate pairs of
the S. cerevisiae genome, 68% are transcribed in the same orientation relative to the centromere (Additional File 4).
Because this is significantly more than the 50% expected under
a pure rearrangement model (not the PGD model as Dr. Wolfe
contends)(P = 10-17by Fisher test), the reviewer correctly states
this falsifies a model of independent gene duplications and relocations. However, the argument is misleading because the test
relates only to the validity of the WGD scenario and should
involve the null hypothesis of no orientation change in gene
duplicates. What the reviewer fails to mention is that because
32% of genes do change orientation and given a sample size
that will make expectations highly significant, the null hypothesis of no change will be rejected by a more significant P value
(P = 10-113) by Fisher test, therefore rejecting the WGD model.
Reviewer's report 2
Austin L Hughes, Department of Biological Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA (nominated
by Eugene Koonin, NCBI, NLM, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894,
USA). 29 August 2007

Ohno [37] was the original champion of the hypothesis
that whole genome duplication (WGD) has played an
important role in evolution. Ohno [37] had some very
odd ideas about the mechanism of gene expression that
led him to believe that tandem duplication could never
lead to anything productive. Today we know that Ohno
was wrong about tandem duplication, which in fact is a
ubiquitous feature of genomes. Moreover, through functional differentiation of duplicates, tandem duplication is
clearly a major source – perhaps the major source – of evolutionary novelty [55]. Polyploid organisms are known,
but it is unclear that polyploidization has ever given rise
to any important novelty. Thus, the recent obsession with
alleged cases of WGD on the part of evolutionary genomicists is puzzling to say the least.
As my colleagues and I have discussed extensively elsewhere, a significant problem with virtually all published
claims of WGD is that in these studies the authors show
evidence of patterns consistent with WGD but they do not
conduct critical hypothesis tests [56]. To my way of thinking, what is distinctive about natural science (as opposed
to other forms of human intellectual effort) is the use of a
specific method (the "hypothetico-deductive method")
that decides among competing hypotheses by formulating
falsifiable predictions of each hypothesis [57]. In science,
the null or starting hypothesis must always be the hypothesis of no effect. Thus, we must always approach the study
of genomic evolution with the null hypothesis that no

WGD has taken place. Only if the observed results are
highly unlikely under the null hypothesis should we (tentatively) accept the alternative hypothesis of WGD.

Reviewer's report 4
Mark Gerstein, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520,
USA)

The paper of Martin et al. is unusual in that it applies a rigorous hypothesis-testing framework to WGD in the case
of the yeast S. cerevisiae. The approach is based on the
assumption that the more parsimonious evolutionary scenario is more likely. This seems reasonable, particularly
since WGD advocates typically make the claim that WGD
is more parsimonious than hypotheses invoking independent events of segmental duplication because the latter duplicates many genes with one event. However,
Martin et al. show that in fact a hypothesis of multiple segmental duplications is more parsimonious than that of
WGD, given biologically reasonable assumptions.

The reviewer provided no comments for publication

Of course, a limitation of any such study is that only certain scenarios are compared, since the number of theoretically possible scenarios is very large. WGD advocates will
perhaps claim that there may exist an unexplored scenario
involving WGD that would be more parsimonious than
the scenarios without WGD examined here. But the burden of proof is on the WGD advocates. Unless they can
present actual proof that WGD is more parsimonious, the
null hypothesis stands. The paper of Martin et al. is important because it provides a solid quantitative demonstration that WGD is not a plausible hypothesis in a species
for which the hypothesis of WGD has rarely if ever been
questioned.
Author's response
We thank Dr. Hughes for his comments and for placing our
work into the right context, the Popperian hypothesis-testing
framework. We apply this framework to an important question
related to evolutionary change. Is genomic change gradual or
saltatory? The question applies in our case to the yeast lineage
and to levels of chromosomal duplication, but the theme is
recurrent in biology.

We agree that not all possible scenarios are compared and that
this limits our study. For example, our analysis proceeds by
duplicating, deleting and then rearranging genes, in that order.
However, there could be other more parsimonious explanations
that would consider steps of duplication, deletion and rearrangement in any possible sequence. We hope a powerful algorithm and a formal distance measure can be devised in the near
future that can handle this complicated and computationally
intense problem.
