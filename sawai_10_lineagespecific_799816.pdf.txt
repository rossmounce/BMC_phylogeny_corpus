Abstract
Background: The 200 kDa merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of malaria parasites, a strong vaccine candidate,
plays a key role during erythrocyte invasion and is a target of host protective immune response. Plasmodium vivax,
the most widespread human malaria parasite, is closely related to parasites that infect Asian Old World monkeys,
and has been considered to have become a parasite of man by host switch from a macaque malaria parasite.
Several Asian monkey parasites have a range of natural hosts. The same parasite species shows different disease
manifestations among host species. This suggests that host immune responses to P. vivax-related malaria parasites
greatly differ among host species (albeit other factors). It is thus tempting to invoke that a major immune target
parasite protein such as MSP-1 underwent unique evolution, depending on parasite species that exhibit difference
in host range and host specificity.
Results: We performed comparative phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of the gene encoding MSP-1
(msp1) from P. vivax and nine P. vivax-related simian malaria parasites. The inferred phylogenetic tree of msp1
significantly differed from that of the mitochondrial genome, with a striking displacement of P. vivax from a
position close to P. cynomolgi in the mitochondrial genome tree to an outlier of Asian monkey parasites.
Importantly, positive selection was inferred for two ancestral branches, one leading to P. inui and P. hylobati and
the other leading to P. vivax, P. fieldi and P. cynomolgi. This ancestral positive selection was estimated to have
occurred three to six million years ago, coinciding with the period of radiation of Asian macaques. Comparisons of
msp1 polymorphisms between P. vivax, P. inui and P. cynomolgi revealed that while some positively selected amino
acid sites or regions are shared by these parasites, amino acid changes greatly differ, suggesting that diversifying
selection is acting species-specifically on msp1.
Conclusions: The present results indicate that the msp1 locus of P. vivax and related parasite species has lineagespecific unique evolutionary history with positive selection. P. vivax and related simian malaria parasites offer an
interesting system toward understanding host species-dependent adaptive evolution of immune-target surface
antigen genes such as msp1.

Background
Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by the anopheline mosquito, is caused by the genus Plasmodium. Of
the five parasite species that infect humans, Plasmodium
vivax is arguably the most prevalent in South and Central America, Melanesia, Asia and the Middle East,
accounting for 80 - 90 million cases annually [1]. Unlike
P. falciparum, which often causes severe malaria, P.
vivax infections are rarely lethal but a major cause of
morbidity in endemic countries. An ideal control strategy is the development of effective vaccines, with potential targets in the asexual blood stage responsible for the
clinical manifestation of the disease. The 200 kDa merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1), a vaccine candidate
antigen that is abundantly expressed on the surface of
merozoites and plays critical role in erythrocyte invasion, is one of the major targets of the host immune
response [2]. MSP-1 is conserved in all Plasmodium
species. Disruption of the Plasmoium MSP-1 gene has
been demonstrated to have a deleterious effect on the
parasite growth in experimental animals [3].
The 200 kDa precursor of P. falciparum MSP-1 undergoes proteolytic processing, producing four major polypeptides of approximately 83, 30, 38 and 42 kDa from the
N-terminus to C-terminus [2]. These polypeptides are on
the merozoite surface as a non-covalently associated complex. Coincident with erythrocyte invasion the C-terminal
42 kDa is further cleaved to produce the N-terminal 33
kDa and C-terminal 19 kDa, and except for the latter, all
processed fragments are shed [4]. The 19 kDa C-terminal,
which contains two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domains, remains anchored to the merozoite membrane
and is carried into the invaded erythrocytes. These processing events appear to be conserved in P. knowlesi, a P.
vivax-related simian malaria parasite [5]. Both the 42 kDa
and 19 kDa polypeptides are considered to be promising
vaccine candidates for P. falciparum and P. vivax [6,7].
However, the gene encoding MSP-1 (msp1), which is present as a single copy per haploid parasite genome, is highly
polymorphic [8] and thus, presents a major obstacle to
effective vaccine development. There is evidence showing
that allelic diversity of MSP-1 is strongly associated with
strain-specific protective immunity in experimental animals [9,10]. Sequence variation in msp1 has previously
been studied for P. falciparum [8,11,12]. A large proportion of P. falciparum msp1 has a dimorphic structure,
with alleles classified as belonging to either K1 or MAD20
type. Divergence between these dimorphic alleles is estimated to have occurred approximately 27 - 35 million
years ago (mya) [13,14]. Although the biological significance of allelic dimorphism in P. falciparum msp1 is
unknown, it is likely that K1 and MAD20 alleles are maintained by balancing selection as part of the parasite

immune evasion mechanism. We have shown that P.
vivax msp1 also shows extensive allelic variation but that
the polymorphism pattern is clearly different from the
dimorphic nature of P. falciparum msp1 [15]. Furthermore, in contrast to the presumed ancient origin of P. falciparum msp1, the origin of P. vivax msp1 polymorphism
is relatively recent [16].
P. vivax has a unique evolutionary history as compared
with P. falciparum. It is believed that P. falciparum and
the closely related chimpanzee parasite, P. reichenowi, codiverged alongside that of humans and chimpanzees
[17,18]. In contrast, P. vivax is closely related to parasites
such as P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi that infect Asian Old
World monkeys (OWMs), though P. vivax does not infect
the OWMs [19]. P. vivax has recently been proposed to
have become a parasite of man by host switch from a
macaque malaria parasite sometime between 50,000 to
300,000 years ago [20,21] or 460,000 years ago [22]. P.
hylobati, a parasite of gibbons in Southeast Asia, is also
considered to have originated by host switch from a macaque parasite. Several Asian macaque malaria parasites
have a range of natural hosts, e.g., P. inui and P. cynomolgi
infect multiple species of the genera Macaca and Presbytis
[19]. P. knowlesi infects not only macaques, leaf monkeys
and langurs but also has recently been recognized as the
fifth human malaria parasite based from studies in Southeast Asia [23]. Experimental infections of the rhesus macaque, M. mulatta, and the Japanese macaque, M. fuscata,
by P. coatneyi, P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi or P. inui result in
acute manifestations of malaria with high parasitemia,
whereas these parasites produce less symptoms and lowgrade infections in the long-tailed or crab eating macaque,
M. fascicularis [19,24,25]. This indicates the same parasite
species causes different disease manifestations among host
species. Such differential disease manifestations may suggest that immune responses to P. vivax-related malaria
parasites greatly differ among host species (although other
factors, such as the ability of the parasites to infect a wider
range of red blood cells, e.g., reticulocytes vs. mature red
cells, can also contribute to virulence). It is thus tempting
to invoke that a major immune target parasite protein
gene such as msp1 underwent unique evolution, depending on parasite species that exhibit difference in host
range and host specificity. As such, P. vivax and P. vivaxrelated simian malaria parasites are invaluable resources in
our attempts to understand adaptive evolution in malaria
parasites.
In this study, we investigate (i) the occurrence of natural selection on msp1 in lineages of P. vivax and
related simian malaria parasites through comparative
analysis of phylogenetic trees between msp1 and the
mitochondrial genome, and (ii) using comparative analysis of msp1 polymorphism between P. vivax, P. inui and

P. cynomolgi, we examine the species-specific diversifying selection on msp1. Results obtained here show that
msp1 evolved under positive selection in ancestral
lineages including the one leading to P. vivax and its
closely related simian parasite species, three to six mya,
coinciding with the period of radiation of Asian macaques. Also, a signature of species-specific diversifying
selection was detected in P. vivax, P. inui and P.
cynomolgi.

Results
Divergence of msp1 sequence

We obtained 20 new msp1 sequences from P. knowlesi,
P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P. fieldi, P. fragile and P. gonderi
(Additional file 1). An alignment of the sequences,
together with previously published sequences including
P. vivax, P. simiovale, P. hylobati and P. coatneyi,
revealed considerable sequence variations between species with substantial sequence length difference between
5097 bp to 5787 bp (Additional file 2). These variations
include numerous substitutions, extensive indels and
varying numbers of repeats (Additional file 3). Since
indels and repeats were unreliably aligned, these were
excluded, leaving 4176 bp aligned positions that were
used for further analysis (Additional file 3). Nucleotide
divergence in the aligned 4176 bp sequences and amino
acid divergence were 39% - 42% and 41% - 47%, respectively, between P. gonderi, an African OWM parasite
and P. vivax and related simian malaria parasites.
Between P. vivax and the seven Asian monkey parasite
species divergence was 15% - 21% and 24% - 36% at the
nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome and
msp1

The mitochondrial genome of Plasmodium has been
shown to be free from strong positive selection [20,26].
In this work, we obtained 28 new sequences of the
mitochondrial genomes from P. knowlesi, P. fragile, P.
inui, P. cynomolgi and P. fieldi. Together with reported
sequences, we constructed the Maximum likelihood
(ML) tree of the mitochondrial genome of P. vivax and
related simian parasites and compared the tree with that
constructed from msp1. The mitochondrial ML tree
revealed two major clades using P. gonderi as an outgroup: one for a clade of P. coatneyi and P. knowlesi,
and the other for a clade of P. fieldi, P. cynomolgi, P.
vivax, P. hylobati and P. inui (Figure 1a). (P. simiovale
was grouped into the P. fieldi lineage in this study, as
noted in Methods.) Relationship between these two
clades and P. fragile was not well resolved. These results
are basically consistent with the tree topologies constructed using two nuclear genes, b-tubulin and CDC-2,
and the plastid gene TufA [21], 18S rRNA gene [27],

Page 3 of 12

and the mitochondrial cytb gene [28]. A ML tree constructed using sequences of three mitochondrial protein
coding regions was similar to the ML tree using the
whole mitochondrial genome sequence (not shown).
The ML tree of msp1 shows two major clades using P.
gonderi as an outgroup, one for P. vivax and the other
for the seven Asian monkey parasite species. In the latter clade, three sub-clades were noted: (i) P. fragile, P.
coatneyi and P. knowlesi, (ii) P. fieldi and P. cynomolgi,
and (iii) P. hylobati and P. inui (Figure 1b). Topologies
of the mitochondrial tree and the msp1 tree appear to
be distinct, with striking difference in that P. vivax was
displaced from its position closest to P. cynomolgi in the
mitochondrial tree to an outlier of the seven Asian
monkey parasites in the msp1 tree. Applying the mitochondrial genome sequence data to the msp1 topology,
significant difference was noted between the two trees
(Îli = -42.1, p = 0.003) (Table 1). Similarly, applying the
msp1 sequence data to the mitochondrial genome topology, the two trees were significantly different (Îli =
-23.6, p = 0.041). Additionally, msp1 alignment columns
were separated into a partition composed of first and
second codon position sites (partition of nonsynonymous sites; codon 1 + 2) and another partition comprised of third codon position sites (partition of
synonymous sites; codon 3), with trees constructed independently for the two distinct partitions. The topology
of the ML tree for msp1 codon 1 + 2 was the same as
that of the msp1 ML tree using all sites, whereas it significantly differed from the topology of msp1 ML tree of
codon 3 (Îli = -23.4, p = 0.030). Applying the mitochondrial genome sequence data to the topology of the
msp1 codon 3 tree, the difference was not significant
between the two topologies (Îli = -9.4, p = 0.333).
These results indicate that the msp1 best tree is significantly different from the mitochondrial genome best
tree, and that the difference between the mitochondrial
genome best tree and the msp1 best tree is largely due
to nonsynonymous substitutions in the latter, suggesting
positive selection in the evolution of msp1.
Lineage-specific positive selection in msp1

We examined the occurrence of lineage-specific positive
selection using the free-ratio model, which allows variable Ï (= kA/kS) among branches. For this analysis, the
ML topology of the msp1 third codon positions was
used. The free-ratio model revealed three specific
branches having Ï > 1: the branch ancestral to P. fieldi
and P. vivax (branch A, Ï 1 ), the branch ancestral to
branch A and P. cynomolgi (branch B, Ï 2 ), and the
branch ancestral to P. hylobari and P. inui (branch C,
Ï3) (Figure 2a). Values of Ï1, Ï2 and Ï3 were not significantly greater than one by likelihood ratio test (LRT)
when the free model was compared with the constrained

models that fixed Ï1, Ï2 or Ï3 at one. Since it is likely
that a large number of sites in msp1 may be under
strong purifying selection due to constraints of the proteinâs function, we estimated Ï values for three separate
msp1 regions: the 5â region (1851 bp), the central region
(1227 bp) and the 3â region (1098 bp); corresponding to
the N-terminal 83 kDa fragment, the central 33 kDa +
38 kDa fragments, and the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment,
respectively. In the 5â region, four branches showed Ï >
1: the lineage to P. fragile, branches A, B and C. Among
these, Ï of branch C was significantly greater than one
when the free model was compared with the constrained
model that fixed the Ï at one (p = 0.041 by LRT test)
(Figure 2b). In the central region, Ï > 1 was detected in

branch B (Figure 2c). When the free model was compared with the constrained model that fixed the Ï at
one, Ï was slightly higher than one though not significant (p = 0.076). Two branches (a lineage leading to P.
inui and branch B) in the 3â region, likewise, showed Ï
> 1 but were not significant (Figure 2d). As a whole, we
observe that positive selection was acting on the msp1 5â
region and central region at the early period after the
divergence among P. fieldi, P. vivax, P. cynomolgi, P.
hylobati, and P. inui.
To infer the time of the two branches where positive
selection was detected (branches B and C in Figure 2),
we estimated the divergence time of lineages of interest
using the mitochondrial sequences. The relative rate

tests revealed evolutionary rate constancy in two different groups with rate heterogeneity between them (Additional file 4): one group (Group I) includes P. gonderi, P.
vivax, P. cynomolgi and P. fieldi using P. chabaudi, a
rodent malaria parasite, as an outgroup, and the other
(Group II) includes P. knowlesi, P. hylobati and P. inui
using P. gonderi as an outgroup. In Group I, the average
pairwise genetic distance between P. gonderi and P.
fieldi/P. vivax/P. cynomolgi was 0.036 Â± 0.003 and that
between P. fieldi and P. vivax/P. cynomolgi was 0.011 Â±
0.001. Assuming that P. gonderi and Asian monkey
parasite species diverged around 10 mya along with
their respective hosts [18], the divergence time of P.
fieldi, P. vivax and P. cynomolgi was 3.0 Â± 0.3 mya. In
Group II, the distance between P. knowlesi and P. hylobati/P. inui was 0.035 Â± 0.002 and that between P. hylobati and P. inui was 0.025 Â± 0.002. Adopting the
divergence time of P. knowlesi and other Asian OWM
parasites of 6.3 mya [18], the divergence time of P. hylobati and P. inui was 4.6 Â± 0.4 mya. Dating of the common ancestor of branches B and C was not successfully
estimated, due to rate heterogeneity between the two

Page 5 of 12

groups. We therefore conservatively adopted the divergence time (6.3 Â± 1.4 mya) of P. knowlesi and other
Asian monkey parasites as an older timing of the common ancestor of branches B and C. Thus, branch B was
estimated to lie between 3.0 Â± 0.3 and 6.3 Â± 1.4 mya,
and branch C to lie between 4.6 Â± 0.4 and 6.3 Â± 1.4
mya.
Polymorphism of msp1 sequences

Intraspecific nucleotide diversity (Ï) varied between
1.9% and 3.4% in P. vivax, P. cynomolgi, and P. inui, in
which ten or more sequences were available (Additional
file 1). Average pairwise amino acid difference was 3.7%
to 5.0%. Our previous analysis has revealed the evolution of msp1 polymorphism in P. vivax and P. cynomolgi
after speciation [16]. The present study extends this
recent evolution of msp1 polymorphism to P. inui (Figure 1).
Detection of the signature of diversifying selection

To detect amino acid sites under positive selection in
msp1 sequences, we used the omegaMap to perform a

Figure 2 Lineage-specific positive selection in the phylogeny of msp1 from P. vivax and P. vivax-related simian malaria parasite
species. The maximum-likelihood (ML) tree topology was constructed using sequences of msp1 codon 3 for (a) the whole msp1 gene, (b) the 5â
region, (c) the central region and (d) the 3â region. The estimates of kA and kS (Ã100) are shown above each branch. Branches showing Ï (= kA/
kS) >1 are bold-lined. A branch showing Ï significantly greater than 1 (P < 0.05), when the free ratio model was compared with the constrained
model that fixed Ï of the branch of interest at 1, is double-asterisked; and that weakly higher than 1 (P < 0.1) is asterisked. Abbreviations are: Pfi,

Bayesian inference on Ï (= dN/dS) [29]. This method
allows us to identify positively selected amino acid sites
in sequences even in the presence of widespread recombination breakpoints, thus applicable to P. vivax msp1
sequences, in which recombination events have been
inferred [15]. The selection parameter Ï was analyzed
for msp1 alignments of P. vivax, P. cynomolgi and P.
inui. P. vivax showed five regions with posterior probability of positive selection > 95% (Figure 3). P. inui and
P. cynomolgi had eight and four regions, respectively,
with posterior probability > 95%. Most of these positively selected regions/sites overlapped among the three
species: all five regions in P. vivax and all four regions
in P. cynomolgi coincided with those regions in P. inui
(Figure 3a), suggesting between-species conservation of
positively selected regions/sites. The number of positively selected sites varied among species: 116 sites in P.
vivax, 28 sites in P. inui and 22 sites in P. cynomolgi
(Additional file 3). We are not certain why P. vivax
showed numerous positively selected sites, although closer inspection of those positively selected regions
revealed longer haplotype blocks in P. vivax (Additional
file 5). Such haplotype blocks may have falsely produced
relatively numerous selection sites. Of note, at positively
selected amino acid positions that were shared by the
three parasite species, amino acid substitutions were
remarkably divergent: e.g. amino acid substitutions at
739 (position 999 in the P. vivax Sal-1 sequence in
Additional file 3; figure S1) were R/Q/A/T in P. vivax,
H/Q/T/P/N in P. inui, and L/Q/V in P. cynomolgi.
Positively selected sites within non-recombination
sequence segments were also detected using HyPhy/
Datamonkey [30]. Due to the inherent limitation in the
maximum number of sequences (n = 14) that can be
handled by the recombination detection program, 14 P.
vivax sequences were randomly selected from a total of
43 sequences and analyzed, with the procedure being
repeated five times. The number of positively selected
sites varied from nine to 15 in five computations, and
those detected thrice or more (referred to as consensus
sites) were eleven, while those detected in at least one
computation were 29 (Figure 3b). The numbers of positively selected sites were nine and 18 in P. inui and P.
cynomolgi, respectively. Although only one positively
selected site (at amino acid position 739) was shared by
the three parasite species, there were two additional
selected regions/sites that were positioned nearby in
each species: at 193 - 200 and 247 - 260. It is also
worth noting that in each of the three species, the positively selected sites detected by either omegaMap and
HyPhy/Datamonkey roughly overlaps (Figure 3): six of
the eleven sites detected by HyPhy in P. vivax (consensus); eight of the nine sites in P. inui; and nine of the 18

Page 6 of 12

sites in P. cynomolgi. Positively selected sites are somewhat clustered in the 5â regions.

Discussion
Ancestral positive selection in P. vivax and related simian
malaria parasites

This study presents evidence of a signature for ancestral
positive selection on an immune target surface antigen
gene (msp1) of malaria parasites. Differences in the phylogenetic trees between the mitochondrial genome and
msp1 of P. vivax and related simian malaria parasites
suggest that msp1s have evolved under positive selection. Positive selection was detected in an ancestral lineage leading to P. inui and P. hylobati (branch C) (Figure
2) and weak positive selection in an ancestral branch
leading to P. vivax, P. fieldi, and P. cynomolgi (branch
B). In these branches, positive selection was not detected
at the whole gene level but in separate msp1 regions. It
is rare to find a gene showing evidence for positive
selection at the whole gene level or a long gene region
because most genes are under purifying selection [31],
and thus small regions that are under positive selection,
if any, may not be readily detectable. We do not therefore exclude the possibility that smaller msp1 regions
and/or limited amino acid sites were under positive
selection in ancestral branches other than branches B
and C of P. vivax-related simian malaria parasite
lineages.
Estimated time frame of these lineages was between
3.0 and 6.3 mya. It should be noted that 6.3 mya is a
conservative estimate because of the lack of an appropriate calibration point to estimate a common ancestor of
branches B and C. With this in mind, the estimated
time frame seems to coincide well with the period of
radiation events of Asian macaques (3.7-5.1 mya) [32]. It
is plausible that Asian macaque malaria parasites
radiated along with radiation events of host monkey
species. Natural infections in macaques such as M. fascicularis with several Asian simian malaria parasites like
P. cynomolgi and P. inui are relatively benign, whereas
experimental infections with these parasites are severe
and frequently lethal to non-natural macaque hosts that
inhabit areas free of simian malaria [33]. To survive in
such partially resistant hosts, parasites would have
developed a mechanism(s) to evade host immune
attacks and thus favorable mutations were probably

Asia, sympatric speciation of macaques occurred and
this may have provided a niche for a potential expansion
of host range of ancestral malaria parasites. Some ancestral parasites that successfully gained favorable mutations for immune evasion in major antigen genes during

the radiation period may have succeeded in adapting to
newly appeared macaque species, thus leaving a signature for ancestral positive selection on msp1.
Diversifying selection in P. vivax, P. inui and P. cynomolgi

Polymorphisms of the whole msp1 sequences or
sequences of three separate msp1 regions do not show
evidence for diversifying selection in P. vivax and P.
cynomolgi [16]. We confirmed this for P. inui (data not
shown). This is not unexpected because MSP-1 is essential for the parasite survival [2]. However, we obtained a
signature for diversifying selection at specific amino acid
sites in these parasite species. Interestingly, three positively selected sites/regions were shared by the three
parasite species (Figure 3), suggesting a common structural feature of diversifying selection. However, amino
acid substitutions in these sites/regions greatly differed
among the three parasite species. Also, other positively
selected sites/regions were not shared among the three
species. These indicate that the evolution of msp1 polymorphism is species-specific in P. vivax and related
simian parasite species. The species-specific feature of
diversifying selection on msp1 underscores the importance of understanding the protective immune response
to the vaccine candidate MSP-1 in a species-specific
context.

Little structural information is available for MSP-1,
except for the C-terminal 19 kDa polypeptide, which
contains cysteine-rich two epidermal growth factor-like
domains [34,35]. A hydropathy profile suggests that most
of MSP-1 regions, apart from the N-terminal signal peptide and the 19 kDa polypeptide, are hydrophilic (data
not shown), being consistent with the prediction that
MSP-1 is a component of the merozoite surface coat
[36]. It is thus presumed that positively selected sites are
antibody-binding epitopes. Amino acid substitutions are
mostly radical ones in terms of chemical properties
affecting, for example, the acidity/basicity and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity nature, likely exerting influence in
the antibody binding epitopes of the protein. Alternatively, amino acid changes in these positively selected
sites may alter the ability of antigen-derived peptides to
bind to allelic forms of class II major histocompatibility
complex (MHC), resulting in specific loss of an immune
recognition by particular T cells.
In P. vivax, positively selected sites/regions appears to
be clustered in the 5â region of msp1. Seroepidemiology
studies suggest that the 5â region is subjected to diversifying selection by immune pressures. A high proportion
of individuals infected with P. vivax in Colombia contain
IgG antibodies against Pv200L, a N-terminal protein of
P. vivax MSP-1 (residues 69 to 430 of the Belem strain).

Sawai et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/52

This region also confers partial protection from P. vivax
challenge infection in Aotus monkeys which are experimental models but not natural hosts of P. vivax [37].
Clinical protection has, likewise, been correlated to IgG
antibodies against the N-terminal part of MSP-1 (residues 170 to 675) in western Brazilian Amazon [38].
Similarly, positively selected amino acid sites were
detected in the C-terminal 33 kDa fragment that corresponds to one of the cleaved fragments of the 42 kDa
polypeptide of P. falciparum MSP-1 [39]. In individuals
living in an endemic area in Sri Lanka, naturally
acquired antibodies were directed more strongly to the
42 kDa polypeptide of P. vivax MSP-1 than to the 19
kDa fragment [40], suggesting stronger immunogenicity
of the 33 kDa polypeptide. It is therefore probable that
diversifying selection on the 3â region of P. vivax msp1
corresponding to the 33 kDa region is driven by hostâs
immune pressure. Although positively selected sites/
regions were also detected in the central region, no
immunological study has been done to date, thus no
clear inference can be made for diversifying selection at
this region.
In the present study, highly polymorphic sequence
regions consisting of indels and different numbers of tandem repeats with varying repeat units and lengths (Additional file 6) were not analyzed due largely to limitations
in reliably aligning sequences. In P. falciparum msp1,
sequence variation of tandem repeats is confined to two
variable blocks, blocks 2 and 8 [11]. In block 2 of P. falciparum msp1, different types of tripeptide repeats have
been shown to be involved in protective immunity in
individuals living in a malaria endemic area [41]. It has
been reported that sera of P. vivax-infected patients contain IgG antibodies strongly recognizing the N-terminal
variable blocks of P. vivax MSP-1, whereas they do not
react to the N-terminal conserved blocks [42]. Thus, variations in the number and sequence units of tandem
repeats in msp1 from P. vivax and related simian malaria
parasites may well be associated with allele-linked protective immunity or strain-specific protective immunity.

host immune responses. Analysis of ancestral positive
selection would unveil what is essential for successful
adaptation to new hosts, and eventually help to further
understanding the evolutionary arms race between malaria
parasites and their hosts. Additionally, in this study, a signature for species-specific diversifying selection on msp1
was detected in P. vivax, P. inui and P. cynomolgi, underscoring the importance of understanding the protective
immune response to the vaccine candidate MSP-1 in a
species-specific context.

Methods
Plasmodium species sequenced

Sequences of msp1 and the mitochondrial genome of P.
vivax-related simian malaria parasite species were
obtained from the following Plasmodium species (and
strains): P. gonderi, P. fragile (two strains: Hackeri and
Nilgiri), P. knowlesi (three strains: Malayan, Hackeri and
H), P. coatneyi, P. hylobati, P. simiovale, P. fieldi (three
strains: N-3, A. b. introlatus and Hackeri), P. inui (13
strains: Leaf monkey 1, Hawking, Cinui, Perak (IM),
N34 (IN), Leucophyrus (IC), Perlis (ID), A. hackeri (IF),
Leaf Monkey II (IF), Taiwan II (IB), Celebes, Mulligan,
and Celebes II) and P. cynomolgi (ten strains: T746,
T824, B, Cambodian, Ceylonensis, Gombak, Langur, Pt
2, Smithsonian and RO). Most of the parasites were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), unless described previously [16]. Toque monkeys were experimentally infected with P. cynomolgi
T746 and T828, and a Japanese macaque was infected
with P. coatneyi, and their bloods collected. These
experimental infections were approved by Ethical Review
Committee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo,
Sri Lanka (No. EC/00/69) and Animal Experiment Committee, Dokkyo University Medical School, Japan (No.
0397). Other sequences retrieved from GenBank are
given in Additional file 1, which also lists the parasitesâ
natural hosts.
DNA sequencing

Conclusion
The present study revealed a signature for lineage-specific
ancestral positive selection on msp1 in P. vivax and related
simian malaria parasites. This ancestral positive selection
is inferred to have occurred three to six mya, coinciding
with the period of the radiation of Asian macaques.
Ancestral Asian macaque parasites may have succeeded in
expanding their host ranges when parasites successfully
generated adaptive evolution in immune target antigen
genes such as msp1. The recently published parasite genomes of P. vivax and P. knowlesi, [43,44] have revealed
that the related two species evolved unique genetic systems of antigenic variation (such as vir family in P. vivax

Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from infected monkey blood using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, MD). Nearly complete nucleotide sequences of
msp1 from Asian monkey parasites were obtained by
direct sequencing of PCR products using previously
designed PCR primers and sequencing conditions [16].
However, since P. gonderi msp1 sequence was not successfully obtained from the above procedures, the uneven
PCR method [45] was employed, in which PCR was conducted using a combination of known sequence primer
and random primers. Initially, a short conserved region
(about 500 bp) in the 5â part of msp1 was amplified using
Pgo-f92: 5â-TTTTYGTTACCAAATGTCAATGTGAA-3â

Sawai et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/52

and Pgo-r2: 5â-ACAACTTTCTTCAGCATGTCCA-3â,
and sequenced. To extend this short region outwards
from both directions, amplifications were done using primers derived from the short region sequence and random primers. PCR fragments were cloned into TOPO
TA and XL vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prior to
sequencing. Using newly identified sequenced regions as
a scaffold for further extensions, the uneven PCR was
repeated until the whole P. gonderi msp1 coding region
was obtained. Finally, the following primers were
designed to amplify the full length msp1, Pgo-f19: 5âTGCTACATCTTAAAACATTCGAATAT-3â and Pgor17: 5â-TTAAAGCTCACTGCATAGCAGAATA-3â.
Cycling conditions were 94Â°C for 1 min, 40 cycles at 94Â°C
for 20 sec, 58Â°C for 30 sec, and 72Â°C for 6 min, and a
final extension at 72Â°C for 10 min. Sequences were
obtained using an automated sequencer 3100 Genetic
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA), and reads were verified at both directions with at least two independent
amplifications.
The 6-kb Plasmodium mitochondrial genome was
amplified using the following primers to cover the complete genome, PvmtF5488: 5â-GGTATAATTCCATTATCTCATCCAGA-3â, PvmtR3088: 5â-CAACATAAC
ATTTTTTAGTCCCATGCT-3â, PvmtF2959: 5â-TAC
TAAGATAAAGAACTCCAGGCGT-3â and PvmtR0: 5âTTAACATAATTATAACCTTACGGTCTGT-3â. PCR
conditions and sequencing procedures were the same as
those for msp1. Sequences obtained in this study have
been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank with accession
numbers AB444049-AB444069 and AB444106AB444136. We noted an inconsistency of P. knowlesi
sequences in the present study and the recently published genome report [44]. The sequences of msp1 and
the mitochondrial genome of the P. knowlesi H strain
obtained from ATCC did not match the sequence
reported in the genome project [44] using the H strain;
but those of the ATCC P. knowlesi Malayan strain were
completely identical to sequences of the genome project.
We are uncertain on how to explain this discordance
between datasets.
Sequence alignment

The nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W
[46] and alignments were further checked manually.
Nucleotide divergence between species and intra-specific
nucleotide diversity (Ï), the average pairwise nucleotide
difference per site, were calculated using DnaSP version
4.0 [47]. Average of pairwise amino acid difference was
calculated using MEGA version 4 [48].
Construction of phylogenetic tree

ML phylogenetic trees were constructed using the mitochondrial genome (5818 bp) and msp1 (4176 bp)

Page 9 of 12

sequences by PAUP v4.0 b10 [49]. In the construction
of phylogenetic trees, P. fieldi and P. simiovale were
found to be very closely related to each other (Figures
1a and 1b). Their morphological similarity has also been
reported [19]. For these reasons, P. simiovale was
grouped to the same taxon of P. fieldi in this study.
Since there are a large number of available P. vivax
sequences for the mitochondrial genome (n = 282) and
msp1 (n = 43), two to three distantly related sequences
were used for constructing trees. The appropriate
nucleotide substitution model was selected by the Modeltest 3.7 [50]. A general time-reversible substitution
model where rate heterogeneity among sites was taken
into account by a mixture of Gamma-distributed positive rates and a point mass at rate zero (GTR+I+G) was
used for both mitochondrial genome and msp1. One
hundred bootstrap replicates were done for constructing
ML trees. Difference between phylogenetic trees of
mitochondrial genome and msp1 was statistically evaluated using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [51] implemented in the PAML version 4 [52].
Detection of positive selection in ancestral lineages

To assess lineage-specific positive selection on msp1, the
ratio of kA to kS (= Ï), in which kA and kS are the
number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes
per nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively,
was estimated for branches in a tree using the branch
model implemented in PAML version 4. The Ï ratio
measures the direction and magnitude of selection on
amino acid replacements, with values of Ï < 1, Ï = 1,
and Ï > 1 indicating purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection, respectively. The heterogeneity of Ï among branches was incorporated using the
free-ratio model where each branch has its independent
Ï value. For branches with Ï > 1, a LRT was conducted
between the free-ratio model and a constrained model
with Ï of a branch of interest fixed at one.
Estimation of divergence time of lineages

To date the time frame, in which positive selection is
predicted, the divergence time of lineages of interest
was inferred from the phylogeny of the mitochondrial
genome constructed here. Evolutionary rate constancy
was tested for various lineages using Tajimaâs relative
rate test for the molecular clock hypothesis [53]. The
mitochondrial genomes of P. chabaudi, a rodent malaria
species, (GenBank accession number: AB379671) and P.
gonderi were used as outgroups. When lineages showing
rate constancy were identified, the genetic distance
between lineages was calculated with the Jukes and Cantor correction. We adopted the divergence time of 10
mya for a common node of P. gonderi and Asian monkey malaria parasites, and 6.3 mya for a common node

Sawai et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:52

of P. knowlesi and other Asian monkey malaria parasites
as calibration points [18].
Detection of positively selected amino acid sites

In order to detect the sites under positive selection, we
must be able to distinguish the signatures of selection
from recombination. If the sequences have undergone
recombination, we can spuriously infer selection within
a model that assumes a common phylogeny for all sites
[54]. We accomplished this by analyzing datasets independently under population genetic and phylogenetic
approaches taking into account the effect of
recombination.
The population genetics method employed is the one
implemented in the omegaMap software [29]. It is a
Bayesian method to infer the posterior distribution of Ï
(= dN/dS), in which dN and dS are the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes per nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, based on a coalescence
approach with recombination, where the codon model is
an extension of the NY98 model [55] which incorporates a rate for insertion/deletions. In the omegaMap
implementation the population recombination rate r
and the selection parameter Ï are allowed to vary along
the alignment following independent change-point processes and are sampled through Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC). In our analyses we set the prior
expected length of blocks for r and Ï at 30 codons.
Two independent MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000
iterations with a burn-in of 10% of the total number of
iterations. Upon convergence the two chains were
merged to infer Ï. Due to constraints in omegaMap, we
randomly sampled 25 out of the 43 sequences of P.
vivax.
The phylogenetic approach assumes that the
sequences are free from recombination and consequently all sites follow the same phylogenetic tree. Even
when there is a moderate-to-low signal of recombination, we can still infer selection provided that we can
detect the recombination breakpoints. In such cases, we
may apply the phylogenetic procedure for each nonrecombinant segment - defined by the breakpoint locations. HyPhy/Datamonkey [30] is a likelihood-based procedure that can handle potentially recombinant
sequences when inferring positively selected sites under
the phylogenetic assumption. The recombination breakpoints were first predicted by using the Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD) algorithm [56]
implemented in HyPhy/Datamonkey. The detection of
positive selection was then conducted for each nonrecombinant segment. For each segment a neighborjoining tree [57] was constructed using MEGA 4. To
estimate Ï (= dN/dS) at each codon, a fixed-effects likelihood method that directly estimates dN and dS at each

Page 10 of 12

site was used. This method involves 3 steps: first, the
nucleotide substitution model parameters and branch
lengths are obtained by ML given the alignment segment and the neighbor-joining tree. Second, values for
dN and dS are estimated for each site using the parameters found at the first step and the MG94 codon
model [58], with and without the constraint that dN =
dS. Finally, an LRT is performed to infer whether dN is
significantly different from dS. Owing to computational
limitations of GARD, the maximum number of
sequences analyzed within the phylogenetic approach
was set to 14 per analysis.
