Evolution of the mammalian lysozyme
gene family
David M Irwin1,2*, Jason M Biegel3 and Caro-Beth Stewart3

Abstract
Background: Lysozyme c (chicken-type lysozyme) has an important role in host defense, and has been extensively
studied as a model in molecular biology, enzymology, protein chemistry, and crystallography. Traditionally,
lysozyme c has been considered to be part of a small family that includes genes for two other proteins,
lactalbumin, which is found only in mammals, and calcium-binding lysozyme, which is found in only a few species
of birds and mammals. More recently, additional testes-expressed members of this family have been identified in
human and mouse, suggesting that the mammalian lysozyme gene family is larger than previously known.
Results: Here we characterize the extent and diversity of the lysozyme gene family in the genomes of
phylogenetically diverse mammals, and show that this family contains at least eight different genes that likely
duplicated prior to the diversification of extant mammals. These duplicated genes have largely been maintained,
both in intron-exon structure and in genomic context, throughout mammalian evolution.
Conclusions: The mammalian lysozyme gene family is much larger than previously appreciated and consists of at
least eight distinct genes scattered around the genome. Since the lysozyme c and lactalbumin proteins have
acquired very different functions during evolution, it is likely that many of the other members of the lysozyme-like
family will also have diverse and unexpected biological properties.

Background
The vertebrate lysozyme gene family has traditionally
been considered to be composed of three genes: lysozyme c, lactalbumin, and calcium-binding lysozyme
[1-4]. Lysozyme c, chicken-type (or conventional) lysozyme, is a bacteriolytic enzyme that is secreted into
many body fluids of mammals (e.g., blood, tears, and
milk) and is found at a high concentration in the eggs
of many bird species [1,2,5]. Lysozyme c is widespread
in nature; its protein and gene sequences have been
characterized from numerous diverse vertebrate and
non-vertebrate species [3,5,6]. Lactalbumin is related to
lysozyme, with around 40% amino acid identity and
nearly identical three-dimensional structure, but lacks
its bacteriolytic activity [1,2,4,7]. Lactalbumin is
expressed in lactating mammary glands, where it binds a
calcium ion and modifies the activity of b-galactosyltransferase-1, such that the complex catalyzes the

synthesis of lactose [2,4,7]. Lactalbumin has recently
been shown to have a second activity in the gut, where
it loses the calcium ion and binds a fatty acid; this new
form of lactalbumin appears to promote apoptosis of
tumor cells, and thus has been renamed HAMLET
(human lactalbumin made lethal to tumors) [8]. Lactalbumin appears to be found only in mammals, and is
widely distributed in this group. Calcium-binding lysozyme has bacteriolytic activity like lysozyme c, but also
shares with lactalbumin the ability to bind a calcium
ion. Calcium-binding lysozymes appear to be relatively
rare; they have been found in the milk of only a few
mammalian species (e.g., horse, dog, cat, seal, and
echidna), as well as in the eggs (e.g., pigeon) and stomachs (e.g., hoatzin) of some bird species [3,9]. Indeed,
calcium-binding lysozyme genes have not been reported
for the human or rodent genomes.
Previous phylogenetic analyses of lysozyme c, lactalbumin, and calcium-binding lysozyme sequences had suggested that the earliest divergences within this gene
family occurred between lysozyme c and the ancestor of
the genes for lactalbumin and calcium-binding lysozyme,

and that this initial gene duplication may have preceded
the divergence of the lineages leading to fish and mammals [10,11]. The separation of the lactalbumin and calcium-binding lysozyme genes was proposed to be more
recent, with some studies [9,12] suggesting a divergence
on the early mammalian lineage, which would be consistent with the restriction of the lactalbumin gene to
mammals. In contrast, another study [11] suggested that
the duplication generating the lactalbumin and calciumbinding lysozyme genes predated the bird-mammal
divergence. Moreover, the orthology of the mammalian
and avian calcium-binding lysozymes has even been
questioned [3,11]. Thus, the origin of these mammalian
lysozyme-like genes remains an open question.
Recently, cDNAs for several additional lysozyme-like
sequences have been identified from human testis
cDNA libraries [13-15]. These cDNAs were found to be
encoded by genes that are now annotated by Ensembl
[16] as LYZL (lysozyme-like): LYZL2, LYZL4, LYZL6
and LYZL3 (Synonym SPACA3; SPACA, Sperm acrosome associated [15]. SPACA3 is also known as SPRSA
[14] and SLLP1 [13]). The predicted protein sequences
of some of these lysozyme-like sequences have amino
acid substitutions at sites important for the catalytic
activity of lysozyme, suggesting that these proteins
would not be able to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds of
bacterial peptidoglycan [13,15]. Since these four new
lysozyme-like genes (LYZL2, LYZL4, LYZL6, and
SPACA3) are expressed predominantly in the testes, it
has been suggested that they might have a role in reproduction [13-15,17]. Such a role has been shown for
Lyzl4 and Spaca3 in mice [18,19].
The identification of these LYZL genes in the human
genome suggests that the mammalian lysozyme-like
gene family is larger than previously appreciated, and
raises the possibility that the lysozyme-like proteins
encoded by these genes may have novel biological functions. Here we have used extensive similarity searches of
the human and other vertebrate genomes. We thereby
identified three additional intact lysozyme-like genes in
the human genome; these have been annotated in the
databases, but not reported in the literature. We have
also identified multiple lysozyme-like genes in the genomes of diverse vertebrates. Using a combination of
phylogenetic and genomic neighborhood (or synteny)
analyses, wherein the relationships of the genes that
flank the lysozyme-like genes in diverse species were
examined, we demonstrate that orthologs of the human
lysozyme-like genes are found in the genomes of diverse
mammalian species. Our analyses suggest that there
were at least six, and perhaps as many as nine, diverse
types (or subfamilies) of lysozyme-like genes in the genome of the common ancestor of all extant mammals,
and that these diverse genes have been maintained on

most mammalian lineages. This suggests that their protein products probably have essential biological functions that are yet to be identified.

Results and Discussion
Number of Lysozyme Genes in the Human Genome

To determine the size of the lysozyme-like gene family,
we performed BLAST [20] similarity searches of the
human genome for sequences that predict potential protein sequences similar to lysozyme c, and thereby identified a total of nine annotated genes (Table 1, and
Additional file 1: Table S1). Of these nine annotated
genes, six had previously been characterized: lysozyme c
(LYZ) [21], lactalbumin (LALBA, Synonym: LYZL7) [22],
LYZL2, LYZL4, LYZL6 [15], and SPACA3 (Synonyms:
LYZL3, SPRSA, SLLP1) [13,14]. The three remaining
genes identified in our BLAST searches – the LYZL1,
SPACA5 (Synonym: LYZL5), and SPACA5B genes – had
been annotated as lysozyme-like in Ensembl [16], but
have not been discussed in the literature. A tenth lysozyme-like sequence was later identified using our genomic neighborhood analysis (see below), but appears to
be a pseudogene (ψLYSC1). These ten lysozyme-like
sequences are distributed over five chromosomes in
humans, with two genes each on chromosomes 10, 17,
and X, three genes on chromosome 12, and one gene
on chromosome 3 (Table 1). Each of the potentially
functional genes predicts a protein sequence about 140150 amino acids long, similar to lysozyme c and lactalbumin. The mature regions of these proteins are readily
aligned due to the presence of many highly conserved
residues, including the eight cysteines known to be
involved in disulfide bonds in lysozyme and lactalbumin
(Figure 1). Each of the lysozyme-like genes has been
annotated as being composed of four or five exons. The
140-150 amino acid coding regions are spread over four
exons in each of the genes with the introns in exactly
the same locations, including phases, as found in the
lysozyme c and lactalbumin genes [5,6] (Figure 1).
Moreover, the LYZL1, LYZL2, LYZL4, LYZL6, and
SPACA3 genes are annotated as having an additional 5’
exon, which in some cases might be translated to produce proteins that have longer N-terminal regions (especially in the case of SPACA3; not shown in Figure 1).
Most of the predicted human proteins (Figure 1) show
between 30% and 53% amino acid sequence identity in
pairwise comparisons (Table 2), suggesting that the gene
duplications that gave rise to them are fairly ancient (or,
alternatively, that these proteins have evolved at extremely rapid rates). If these gene duplications were indeed
ancient, then we would expect to find these genes in
diverse mammalian species (as we did; see below). In
contrast, the LYZL1/LYZL2 and SPACA5/SPACA5B
protein pairs are 97% and 100% identical, respectively

(Table 2); this suggests that their genes likely duplicated
fairly recently, and thus these duplicates are predicted to
be more limited phylogenetically. The LYZL1 and
LYZL2 genes are both located on human chromosome
10, but are separated by about 1 Mb; moreover, these
genes are embedded within 60 kb long repeated

shown). This suggests that the LYZL1 and LYZL2 gene
duplicates were generated as part of a recent segmental
duplication on chromosome 10. Likewise, the SPACA5
and SPACA5B genes are both on the X chromosome,
separated by about 120 kb, and are within long (~100
kb) repeated DNA sequences that have high sequence
identity (not shown). Thus, the LYZL1/LYZL2 and
SPACA5/SPACA5B gene pairs both appear to have
originated from relatively recent and large genomic segmental duplications, a common form of gene duplication in mammals [23]. The high sequence identity of
these gene pairs also could be due, at least in part, to
concerted evolution [24], as discussed below.
Lysozyme Genes in Other Vertebrate Genomes

To determine whether an expanded lysozyme-like gene
family is a general feature of mammalian (and other vertebrate) genomes, we conducted intensive homology
searches for lysozyme-like genes in all vertebrate
genomes available in the Ensembl and Pre!Ensembl databases (http://www.ensembl.org, http://pre.ensembl.org/
index.html) [16,25]. These results are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Additional file 1: Table S1), and
summarized for mammals in Figure 2. At least one lysozyme-like gene was found in each vertebrate genome,
with the exception of the lamprey. Multiple lysozymelike genes were identified in all of the mammalian
species ranging from 5 in opossum to 18 in cow. The
fewest number of genes were found in bony fish, where
only one gene was identified per genome, and in birds,
where at most two genes were identified per genome.
The anole lizard and Xenopus tropicalis, the lone representatives of reptiles and amphibians with sequenced
genomes, had 8 and 16 lysozyme-like genes, respectively.
Importantly, the BLAST searches identified potential
orthologs in most mammalian genomes (Figure 2) of all
of the divergent lysozyme-like genes found in the

Figure 2 Diversity and evolution of mammalian lysozyme-like genes. A phylogeny, adapted from recent phylogenomic analyses [71-73], of
the mammalian species examined in this study is shown; branch lengths are not proportional to evolutionary time. The numbers of each type
of lysozyme-like gene identified in the mammalian genomes are shown by symbols on the right of the Figure. Species with genomes of higher
quality (better coverage and assembly) are labeled in bold and with asterisks. The status of the genes in each genome are indicated by symbols,
listed in the key box in the figure, where solid boxes indicate genes that are predicted to encode full-length sequences, open boxes indicate
incomplete genes, which may be due to either incomplete genome sequences or may be pseudogenes, the Greek letter psi identifies wellcharacterized pseudogenes, zero indicates that no gene was identified in our searches, and the ‘not’ sign indicates genes that appear to have
been deleted from the genomes. The question mark beside the sloth Lyzl8 gene indicates that this is a tentative assignment. Inferred
evolutionary events are mapped onto their most likely lineage, based upon the data presented in this figure, coupled with our various
evolutionary analyses. Duplication of genes is indicated by a gene name with an arc over it. Gene deletion is indicated by an X preceding the
name of the deleted gene. X? means that the deletion is uncertain, as the missing gene may actually exist in a gap in the descendant genome
(s). Pseudogene generation is indicated by the psi (ψ) that precedes the gene name; if the pseudogene is associated with a gene duplication
event it also has an arc. If multiple events are shown on a lineage, the order shown does not imply historical order of occurrence.

human genome (LYZ, LALB, LYZL1/2, LYZL4, LYZL6,
SPACA3, and SPACA5). Initial assignments of orthology
of these mammalian genes were based upon sequence
similarity, but were subsequently confirmed by performing genomic neighborhood and phylogenetic analyses
(see below). Our combined findings about gene number
and orthologous relationships of the mammalian lysozyme-like gene family members are outlined in Figure 2.
In contrast to the mammalian genes, the lysozyme-like
genes found in the other vertebrate genomes could not
be readily classified into the above subfamilies based
upon sequence similarities; this is because these genes
and their encoded proteins displayed similar levels of
sequence identity to all of the different mammalian
paralogs. Furthermore, no evidence of synteny with the
mammalian genes was found for any of the non-mammalian vertebrate genes, except for the lysozyme c gene.
Thus, none of the non-mammalian vertebrate lysozymelike genes could be definitively classified as orthologs of
any of the lysozyme-like mammalian genes, other than
Lyz itself.
Many of the genes that were identified in our searches
were only partial sequences, most likely due to the
incomplete nature of the genomes in question. However,
all but one of these genes were consistent with a structure similar to that of the mammalian lysozyme and lactalbumin genes – that is, their coding regions appeared
to be composed of four exons having similar intronexon structures [5,6]. The lone exception was a Lyzl1/2like gene found in the treeshrew (from Genescaffold_6044), which had a nearly full-length coding
sequence that contained stop codons and frameshifts,
but no introns; thus, this gene appears to be a processed
pseudogene. Taken together, these observations suggest
that essentially all of the vertebrate lysozyme-like genes
have been generated by duplications of genomic DNA,
rather than by reverse-transcription and insertion into
genome.
Phylogeny of Vertebrate Lysozymes

The presence of multiple lysozyme-like genes in all
mammalian genomes, as well as in the genomes of several other vertebrate species, raises the possibility that
the lysozyme-like gene family may have amplified early
in vertebrate evolution. To examine this issue, and to
further establish the orthology-paralogy relationships of
lysozyme-like genes, we conducted a series of phylogenetic analyses (Figure 3, and Additional files 2-4: Figure
S1-S3).
Importantly, as illustrated by the Bayesian analysis
shown in Figure 3, all of these phylogenetic analyses
suggested that most lineages of mammals have eight different types of lysozyme-like genes (or pseudogenes):
Lyz, Lalba, Lysc1, Lyzl1/2, Lyzl4, Lyzl6, Spaca3, and

Page 5 of 16

Spaca5. Regardless of type of phylogenetic analysis,
these mammalian genes always clustered together as
monophyletic groups, or clades, supporting their orthologous relationships. These mammalian gene clades routinely had high statistical support, again regardless of
method used. These results are consistent with the
orthologous relationships suggested by the original
BLAST searches, as well as with our genomic neighborhood analyses (described in more detail in the sections
below). However, the genes from the other vertebrates
did not consistently group with any of these mammalian
orthologs, with the exception of some of the lysozyme c
sequences.
In addition, it is clear that most, if not all, of the eight
mammalian lysozyme-like genes duplicated and diverged
from each other prior to the divergence of the earliest
mammalian lineages. This is clear for at least two reasons. First, both the platypus and the eutherian genomes
contain copies of most of these gene duplicates; therefore, these genes must have diverged earlier than did the
species lineages. Second, some of the non-mammalian
vertebrate genes appear to have phylogenetic affinity for
some of the mammalian gene lineages, although few
have much statistical support. This is particularly evident for many of the lizard genes which, as illustrated in
Figure 3, tend to branch with various mammalian orthologs. If this result is not an artifact, then many of the
lysozyme-like genes must have duplicated prior to the
mammal-reptile (or even mammal-amphibian) divergence. If this were the case, however, then these gene
duplicates must have been deleted from the genomes of
birds.
Whereas our phylogenetic analyses supported the
monophyly of each of the mammalian lysozyme-like
gene duplicates, the relationships between the paralogs
were not resolved well (see Figure 3, and Additional
files 2-4: Figures S1-S3). While many of our phylogenetic analyses, including the one shown in Figure 3 (and
Additional file 3: Figure S2), suggested that the Lalba
clade was the earliest diverging lineage and that most of
the Lyzl and Spaca genes (Lyzl1/2, Lyzl4, Lyzl6, Spaca3,
and Spaca5, but not Lyzl8) were most closely related to
each other, these relationships were not consistently
found (e.g., see Additional file 2: Figure S1). Therefore,
the phylogenetic analyses are inconclusive concerning
the relationships of the different subfamilies of mammalian lysozyme-like genes.
The phylogenetic trees also suggested the possibility
that at least some of the gene divergences occurred very
early in vertebrate evolution, i.e., prior to the mammalfish divergence. For example, the mammalian Lyz gene
sequences were found to branch with Lyz genes from
fish, rather than with the other mammalian lysozymelike genes (Figure 3); if this branching order reflects the

Figure 3 Phylogeny of vertebrate lysozyme-like genes. Bayesian phylogenetic tree of vertebrate lysozyme genes. The tree shown was
generated with MrBayes [60,61] using DNA sequences of diverse vertebrate lysozyme-like sequences. (For sequences see Additional files 1 and
18: Tables S1 and S2 for sequences.) The alignment used to generate the tree is shown in Additional file 19: Figure S17. The trees were built
after 2,000,000 generations with nst = 6 and rates = gamma (the TrNef+I+G model was selected as the best model by ModelTest [66-68]). Insect
and amphioxus sequences were used to root the tree. Solid diamonds indicate nodes that represent the gene duplication events that generated
the different types of lysozyme-like genes, or subfamilies, found in mammals. The support for each clade containing each subfamily of
mammalian lysozyme-like gene is boxed, with posterior probabilities above the lineage and bootstrap support from maximum likelihood analysis
below (from Additional file 3: Figure S2). The remaining lineages only display the posterior probabilities from the Bayesian analysis.

actual evolutionary history of the genes (rather than
phylogenetic affinity based upon conserved lysozyme
protein structure and function), then the Lyz gene lineage must have diverged from the other lysozyme-like
genes prior to the mammal-fish divergence. Again, if
this were true, then many species lineages must have
deleted the duplicates from their genomes. Below, we
discuss each subfamily of lysozyme-like gene in the
mammals, and consider their potential non-mammalian
orthologs.
Lysozyme c (Lyz) Genes

The Lyz gene is the best-studied lysozyme-like gene, and
has been extensively characterized in many species [1-6].
Our genome searches and phylogenetic analyses identified many genes that appear to be orthologous to Lyz in
diverse vertebrates (Figure 3, and Additional files 1-3:
Table S1, and Figures S1 and S2). To confirm the
orthology of the Lyz genes, we used a genomic neighborhood analysis, wherein we examined the orthology of
the genes that flank the Lyz gene in diverse species. The
avian and mammalian Lyz genes are flanked by the
Cpsf6 and Yeats4 genes (Figure 4). This organization is
maintained in species with tandemly duplicated Lyz
genes, such as rodents and cow, where the Cpsf6 and
Yeats4 genes are found flanking a cluster of Lyz genes
(Figure 4). A slightly different organization is seen in
the opossum, which has four Lyz genes; in this case the
Cpsf6 gene is upstream of two of the Lyz genes and the
Yeats4 gene is downstream of the other two, but these
two clusters are separated by about 12 Mb of DNA that
potentially was inserted into the opossum genome (Figure 4). Of the numerous lysozyme genes found in Xenopus tropicalis, the LyzA gene was found to be most
closely related to the avian and mammalian Lyz genes in
the phylogenetic trees (Figure 3); consistent with this,
the LyzA gene is located adjacent to a Yeats4 ortholog
(Figure 4), suggesting it is a true ortholog of the mammalian Lyz gene. Most fish Lyz sequences branch in a
clade with mammalian Lyz genes (Figure 3). However,
although the Cpsf6 and Yeats4 genes are neighbors in
the fish genomes, the fish lysozyme genes are not adjacent to either of these genes; thus the genomic neighborhood analysis does not provide support for the
orthology of fish and mammalian Lyz genes. Intriguingly, the zebrafish Lyz gene was found to be in a different genomic context from other fish Lyz genes (results
not shown), which would agree with the hypothesis generated by the phylogenetic analyses (see Figure 3, and
Additional files 2 and 3: Figures S1 and S2) that the zebrafish Lyz gene is not truly orthologous to the other fish
Lyz genes.
The number of Lyz genes found in mammalian genomes varied from 1, in most species, to 12 (Figure 2,

and Additional file 1: Table S1). Multiple Lyz genes had
previously been identified in the genomes of mice and
rats [26-29], rabbits [30,31], and artiodactyls [32-36]. In
addition to these species, multiple Lyz genes were found
in many other species, including guinea pig (9 genes),
elephant (8 genes), armadillo (5 genes), sloth (6 genes),
opossum (4 genes), and wallaby (8 genes) (Figure 2, and
Additional file 1: Table S1). Phylogenetic analysis of the
Lyz sequences, suggested that the multiple genes in
diverse species are due to independent gene duplications
or amplification events (Figure 5). However, previous
work has shown that Lyz genes have been subjected to

Figure 5 Phylogeny of mammalian lysozyme c (Lyz) genes. A
Bayesian phylogenetic tree of mammalian lysozyme c genes was
generated by MrBayes [60,61] using the DNA coding sequences of

or both (Additional file 5: Figure S4). Interestingly,
although an ortholog of Lyzl1/2 was found in the platypus genome, one could not be found in the opossum,
even though the Bambi and Dnm1p17 genes are adjacent in this species; this suggests that the Lyzl1/2 gene
was deleted from the opossum genome (Figure 2, and
Additional file 5: Figure S4). Both human and macaque
have duplicated Lyzl1/2 genes that reside in similar
genomic neighborhoods (Additional file 5: Figure S4),
which should imply that the Lyzl1/2 gene duplication
occurred prior to the human-macaque divergence. Phylogenetic analysis of the Lyzl1/2 sequences, however,
implies that independent gene duplication events
occurred on the macaque, human, and marmoset
lineages (Figure 6). A more likely scenario than multiple
independent gene duplications in these closely-related
primate species is that the original Lyzl1/2 gene duplication event occurred in their common ancestor (as diagrammed in Figure 2), and concerted evolution between
the Lyzl1 and Lyzl2 genes has obscured this original
event. Although a Lyzl1/2 pseudogene was found in the
treeshrew (Figure 2, and Additional file 1: Table S1), it
was generated independently, as discussed above. Potential Lyzl1/2 orthologs in zebrafish and lizard were suggested by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3); however,

concerted evolution on the ruminant and rodent
lineages [28,29,32-37]. Since the inference of independent gene duplication on sister lineages, instead of on
their common ancestral lineage, is a pattern generated
by concerted evolution, the distributions of duplicated
Lyz genes (Figure 2, and Additional file 1: Table S1)
combined with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 5) suggests that concerted evolution might also have occurred
on lineages such as Afrotheria (e.g., elephant and hyrax)
and marsupials (opossum and wallaby).

Lysozyme-like 1/2 (Lyzl1/2) Genes

As mentioned above, the Lyzl1 and Lyzl2 genes in the
human genome appear to have been generated recently
via a genomic segmental duplication. Indeed, with the
exception of those primate species that are close relatives of human, most other mammals have only a single
gene sequence similar to Lyzl1 or Lyzl2 (Figure 2, and
Additional file 1: Table S1). Comparison of the genomic
neighborhoods surrounding the Lyzl1/2 genes in diverse
mammals demonstrates orthology of these genes, as the

[66-68]. The tree was rooted with the platypus Lyzl2 sequence. The

Irwin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:166

these genes were not in genomic neighborhoods similar
to those of the mammalian genes (results not shown),
so their evolutionary relationships remain ambiguous.
Lysozyme-like 4 (Lyzl4) Genes

The Lyzl4 gene was either found as a single copy, or was
missing, in all of the mammalian genomes examined
(Figure 2, and Additional file 1: Table S1). Many of the
missing genes likely reflect incomplete genomes rather
than deletions. Genomic neighborhood analysis confirmed the orthology of the Lyzl4 genes across placental
mammals. However, the flanking genes are on different
chromosomes in opossum, suggesting that chromosomal
recombination had occurred (Additional file 6: Figure
S5). Phylogenetic analyses of Lyzl4 sequences were consistent with it being a single copy gene (Additional file
7: Figure S6). The only potential non-mammalian orthologs of Lyzl4 identified by the phylogenetic analyses
were from the lizard (LyzM and LyzN in Figure 3, but
no evidence for orthology in Additional files 2-4: Figures
S1-S3); however, the lizard and mammalian genes were
not in similar genomic neighborhoods (data not shown).
Lysozyme-like 6 (Lyzl6) Genes

Most mammals exhibited only one Lyzl6 gene, although
the opossum had none. Yet, in contrast to most of the
other paralogs, great variation in the number of Lyzl6
genes was observed across mammals, with five genes
identified in the dog and four genes identified in both
the alpaca and the hyrax (Figure 2, and Additional file 1:
Table S1). Given the distant relationships of these three
species, these gene duplication events must have
occurred independently. The placental and wallaby
Lyzl6 genes reside in a conserved genomic neighborhood, which again suggests that this gene was deleted
on the opossum lineage (Additional file 8: Figure S7).
The presence of multiple Lyzl6 genes in a genome raises
the possibility of concerted evolution; however, sufficient
data were not available to allow examination of this possibility for the Lyzl6 genes (Figure 2, and Additional files
1 and 9: Table S1 and Figure S8). The phylogenetic analyses did not suggest any candidates for Lyzl6 orthologs
in non-mammalian species (Figure 3, and Additional
files 2-4: Figures S1-S3).
Sperm acrosomal protein 3 (Spaca3) Genes

Spaca3, like Lyzl4, was not found to be duplicated in
any of the mammalian genomes examined (Figure 2,
and Additional file 1: Table S1). Spaca3 resides in a
conserved genomic neighborhood in placental mammals;
however, a Spaca3 gene is absent from this genomic
neighborhood in the opossum (Additional file 10: Figure
S9). While the wallaby and platypus Spaca3 genes could
not be placed in a genomic context due to the short

Page 9 of 16

lengths of their genomic contigs (Additional file 10:
Figure S9), phylogenetic analysis of these sequences
(Additional file 11: Figure S110 was consistent with
them being orthologs. These results suggest that the
Spaca3 gene was deleted on the opossum lineage.
Again, no non-mammalian orthologs were suggested by
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3, and Additional files 2-4:
Figures S1-S3).
Sperm acrosomal protein 5 (Spaca5) Genes

The Spaca5 gene was found only within placental mammals, with no orthologs suggested by phylogenetic analysis or similarity searches in marsupials, platypus, or
other vertebrates (Figures 2 and 3, and Additional files
1-4: Table S1 and Figures S1-S3). Thus, it is possible
that this gene duplication happened in the ancestor of
placental mammals. Genomic neighborhood analysis
showed that the Spaca5 gene was in a similar neighborhood on the human, macaque, mouse, and dog X chromosomes (Additional file 12: Figure S11); this genomic
region was not found in marsupials, platypus, or other
vertebrates (results not shown). The SPACA5 gene was
found to be uniquely duplicated in the human genome
(Figure 2, Additional files 1 and 13: Table S1 and Figure
S12). A very recent duplication of SPACA5, since
human-chimpanzee divergence, could account for the
perfect identity of the protein sequences (Table 2) without requiring concerted evolution; however, concerted
evolution between the human SPACA5 and SPACA5B
genes cannot be excluded.
Lysozyme-like 8 (Lyzl8) Gene

The platypus genome contained one lysozyme-like gene,
named Lyzl8, which did not group with any of the other
mammalian genes (Figure 3, and Additional files 2-4:
Figures S1-S3). All of our phylogenetic analyses supported the designation of Lyzl8 as a unique lysozymelike gene duplicate, as the platypus gene did not fall
within any of the other monophyletic gene groups. The
relationship of the platypus Lyzl8 gene to the other lysozyme-like genes was highly labile in the phylogenetic
analyses (Figure 3, and Additional files 2 and 3: Figures
S1 and S2). This result is in accord with the fact that
the platypus Lyzl8 gene (or protein) showed little
similarity to any of the other lysozyme-like genes (or
proteins) in our BLAST searches. When the platypus
Lyzl8 gene was used as a query to search mammalian
genomes, only one genomic sequence – from the sloth
(Figure 2, and Additional file 1: Table S1) – was found
to have greater similarity to Lyzl8 than to any other
lysozyme-like gene. When the short sloth sequence was
used as a query against the platypus genome, its best
match was the Lyzl8 gene. However, the sloth genomic
contig was short, containing only a single exon, and

Irwin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/166

therefore could not be used for phylogenetic or genomic
neighborhood analysis; thus, the evidence supporting
orthology of the sloth sequence to the platypus Lyzl8
gene is very weak. Thus, at present, it is not clear
whether this gene duplication happened on the ancestral
mammal lineage, with subsequent losses on most descendant lineages, or on the monotreme lineage.

Lactalbumin (Lalba) and Calcium-binding Lysozyme
(Lysc1) Genes

Mammalian Lalba genes have been well characterized,
and are typically single copy in mammals [1,2,4,6,7]
(Additional file 14: Figure S13). Curiously, it was previously reported that multiple Lalba genes exist in the
bovine and ovine genomes [38,39], but here we found
only a single copy of the Lalba gene in the cow genome
(Figure 2, and Additional file 1: Table S1). Whether this
reflects differences in the sources of DNA in the different studies or is due to incomplete genome assembly is
unknown. The only genome that revealed a duplicate
Lalba gene was the pika (Figure 2, and Additional file 1:
Table S1). Despite hypotheses about an early origin of
the Lalba gene [10-12], no good candidates for nonmammalian orthologs were identified by our phylogenetic (Figure 3, and Additional file 2-4: Figures S1-S3)
or genomic neighborhood (Figure 7, and results not
shown) analyses.
An intriguing observation from our genomic neighborhood analysis of was that the mammalian calcium-binding lysozyme gene (Lysc1) is located adjacent to the
Lalba gene in the dog (Figure 7) and horse (not shown)
genomes. Both previous phylogenetic analyses [9-12]
and our new phylogenetic analyses (Figure 2, and Additional files 2-4: Figures S1-S3) suggested that the Lysc1
gene originated prior to the radiation of mammals.
However, our tBLASTn searches using either dog or
horse Lysc1 identified similar sequences in the genomes
of only a few diverse mammals – dog, cat, horse, shrew,
sloth, and mouse lemur (Figure 2, and Additional file 1:
Table S1). It is also noteworthy that the mammalian
(Lysc1) and avian calcium-binding lysozyme genes are
not closely related in our phylogenies, a finding in
agreement with some earlier analyses [3,11]. Thus, it is
reasonable to speculate that calcium binding evolved
independently in these bird and mammal lysozymes.
The newly identified Lysc1-like genomic sequences all
were found on short genomic contigs (Additional file 1:
Table S1); nonetheless, both the cat and mouse lemur
genomic contigs also encode part of the c12orf41 gene
(Additional file 15: Figure S14A), which is adjacent to
the Lysc1 gene in both the dog and horse genomes (Figure 7). This suggests that the Lysc1 gene may be near
the c12orf41 gene in other mammalian genomes. Using
a strategy that has previously worked to identify genes

gene family; C12orf41, chromosome 12 open reading frame 41;
CCNT1, Cyclin-T1 (CycT1, Cyclin-T); Mip, major intrinsic protein of
lens fiber; Spryd4, SPRY domain containing 4; Gls2, glutaminase 2. A
large sequence gap exists in the cow genome, indicated by the
parentheses, near the expected location of the Lysc1 gene. The
platypus Lalba gene is on a small contig, as indicated by the shorter
line flanked by dotted lines, that has not been annotated to contain
(nor do we find) any other genes. Genes in the horse genome (not
shown) are organized similar to those shown for the dog. Genes in
the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, baboon, and elephant genomes
(not shown) are similar to those of the human and macaque. Genes
in the rat and guinea pig genomes (not shown) are similar to those
of the mouse.

that could not be found through typical BLAST searches
[40,41], we focused carefully on the sequences between
the Lalba and c12orf41 genes. In 17 of the 37 mammalian genomes available from Ensembl [16,25], the Lalba
and c12orf41 genes were contained in contiguous genomic sequences. In 18 of the 20 species this genomic
region was fragmented into several small genomic contigs; thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that in these
genomes the two genes are contiguous. In the pig and
the little brown bat this genomic region was not fragmented. In the pig, the current genome assembly does
not encode the Lalba gene and the c12orf41 gene is
embedded within a very large genomic fragment, suggesting that the Lalba - c12orf41 genomic region has
been reorganized in the pig genome (or that this region

Irwin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/166

has been incorrectly assembled). In the little brown bat,
the Lalba gene is embedded in a large genomic fragment that was not annotated to include c12orf41
(although our BLAST searches did identify a very small
fragment with strong similarity). A more careful examination of the little brown bat genomic contig revealed
that most of the genomic region is composed of unsequenced gaps.
For the 17 genomes that did have linked Lalba and
c12orf41 genes, the distance between these two genes
ranged from ~50 kb (mouse, rat, and rabbit) to ~250 kb
(cow and opossum). For all of these genomes, except
the opossum (see below), the only genes (or pseudogenes) annotated as existing between Lalba and
c12orf41 were olfactory receptor-like genes, which are
not very useful for identifying orthologous and conserved genomic neighborhoods due to their abundance.
In the opossum, in addition to the olfactory receptorlike genes, three additional genes were annotated
between Lalba and c12orf41: the genes Mip, Spryd4, and
Gls2. Unfortunately, the wallaby genome is poorly
assembled near the Lalba and c12orf41 genes, and thus
the neighboring genes could not be identified. Although
the Mip, Spryd4, and Gls2 genes reside on the same
chromosome as Lalba and c12orf41 in many mammals
(e.g., human, rat, guinea pig, cow, horse, and elephant),
they are found greater than 8 Mb away; furthermore, in
some species (e.g., mouse and dog) they are on different
chromosomes. These observations suggest that the organization of the Lalba, c12orf41, Mip, Spryd4, and Gls2
genes, and potentially a Lysc1 gene, has changed
between the opossum (and possibly other marsupials)
and placental mammals.
The genomic sequence between the Lalba and
c12orf41 genes for the 17 genomes where these two
genes were linked was aligned with MultiPipMaker
[42,43]. Sequences with similarity to the Lysc1 gene
were not observed in 9 of the genomic sequences –
those from marmoset, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit,
treeshrew, cow, little brown bat, and opossum (Additional file 15: Figure S14B). It should be noted, however,
that for 3 of these species (cow, little brown bat, and
marmoset) these genomic sequences contain large
amounts of unknown sequence (i.e., sequence gaps).
Thus, there are only 6 species with nearly complete
genomic sequences spanning the Lalba and c12orf41
genes for which we have good evidence for the actual
absence of a Lysc1 gene or pseudogene – mouse, rat,
guinea pig, rabbit, treeshrew, and opossum. Pairwise
sequence alignments between the mouse, rat, or guinea
pig genomic sequences with those from dog or horse
(or primates) using PipMaker [42] revealed that a large
genomic region, which could potentially encode a Lysc1
gene, is missing from these rodent genomes (results not

Page 11 of 16

shown). This suggests that this genomic region, including the Lysc1 gene, was deleted either early on the
rodent lineage or in the common ancestor of rodents
and close relatives (e.g., rabbit), but after the divergence
of the rodent lineage from the primate lineage (see
Figure 2).
Interestingly, some of the genomes – including those
from certain haplorrhine primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, baboon, and tarsier) and the elephant – do possess sequences between
the Lalba and c12orf41 genes that aligned with three of
the four exons (exons 2 through 4) of the horse and dog
Lysc1 genes (Figures 7 and 8, and Additional files 15
and 16: Figures S14C and S15). All of these genomic
sequences, except for that of the tarsier, are on large
genomic segments that have only a few short unsequenced gaps. It is unlikely that all of these genomic
sequences have been similarly misassembled, thus we
conclude that exon 1 was deleted from all of these
genes, and therefore the Lysc1 gene is a pseudogene in
all of these species (Figure 2). In addition to missing
exon 1, all of these Lysc1-like gene sequences have both
frameshift insertions and/or deletions and in-frame stop
codons, strengthening the conclusion that they are pseudogenes (Figure 8, and Additional file 16: Figure S15).
The loss of exon 1 from the Lysc1 gene of haplorrhine
primates and elephant must have been independent
events (Figure 2) as the mouse lemur, a strepsirrhine
primate, has a Lysc1 gene that has an intact exon 1
(Figure 8, and Additional file 16: Figure S15), plus the
primates and elephants are quite distant relatives.
Intact Lysc1 genes that predict potentially functional calcium-binding lysozymes were found in only a few species (dog, horse, and shrew), whereas pseudogenes were
found on several lineages (primates, elephant, and
sloth). Phylogenetic and genomic analyses suggested
that the pair of Lysc1 genes found in the shrew resulted
from a tandem gene duplication event on the lineage
leading to this species (Additional files 1 and 17: Table
S1 and Figure S16); the divergence of the predicted protein sequences of the two genes suggests that they are
not undergoing concerted evolution, however. The Lysc1
gene was deleted from the genome on the lineages leading to rodents (mouse, rat, guinea pig, and squirrel) and
treeshrews. Taken together, the above observations suggest that the Lysc1 gene likely arose from a duplication
of the lactalbumin gene early in mammalian evolution,
and was inactivated several times independently, as
summarized in Figure 2.

Conclusions
Here we have shown that the mammalian lysozyme gene
family is much larger than previously anticipated, and is
composed of at least eight distantly-related members

Figure 8 Alignment of predicted calcium-binding lysozymes
(Lysc1). Inferred amino acid sequences of predicted Lysc1 genes for
diverse mammals are shown in the single-letter amino acid code.
The DNA sequences are shown in Additional file 16: Figure S15. The
number +1 identifies the N-terminal residue of the mature protein,
and the signal peptides are shown in italics. The solid black
triangles above the sequence indicate locations of the introns in the
gene, with the exon number shown above the protein sequence.
Dashes (-) identify gaps introduced to maximize alignment and refer
to the absence of homologous sequence. Questions marks (?)
indicate gaps introduced to maximize alignment, but are also
potential sequence that may exist in sequence gaps in the genome
assemblies (= missing data). Codons that have one or two base
deletions, and thus would have a frame shift, are marked by an X.
Asterisks identify in-frame stop codons in the sequences.

(Lyz, Lalba, Lysc1, Lyzl1/2, Lyzl4, Lyzl6, Spaca3, and
Spaca5) in most mammalian species. These observations
suggest that this family experienced several duplication
events prior to the origin of mammals. Several other
gene families also experienced such amplifications near
the origin of mammals, such as those generating the
gene families for keratin-associated proteins [44], kallikriens [45,46], and bitter taste receptors [47]. Amplification of these latter genes has been suggested to be
associated with development of new mammal-specific
features – e.g., hair (keratin-associated proteins), skin

Page 12 of 16

(kallikriens), and diet (bitter taste receptors) [44-47].
Intriguingly, lactalbumin is essential for lactose synthesis
in mammary glands, a mammal-specific trait [2,4,7].
These observations raise the possibility that other members of the lysozyme-like family have also evolved mammal-specific roles. The new lysozyme-like genes have
been largely conserved within mammals, suggesting that
they provide important biological functions. The products of the Spaca3 and Lyzl4 genes have recently been
shown to be involved in fertilization in mice [18,19].
Much further study is needed to identify the enzymatic
activities (if any) and biological functions of these newly
identified lysozyme-like proteins.
Similar to the keratin-associated protein [44] and bitter taste receptor [47] gene families, genes for the lysozyme-like proteins are dispersed over several
chromosomes (Table 1). The mechanisms by which
these original gene duplications occurred are unclear,
as the genes that flank the dispersed lysozyme-like
genes show no homology to each other, implying that
they were not generated by large segmental duplication
events (as we observed for the duplications of LYZL1/
LYZL2 and SPACA5/SPACA5B in the human genome).
The lysozyme-like gene family also shares with the keratin associated protein [44], kallikrein [45], and bitter
taste receptor [47] gene families the propensity for
lineage-specific gene duplications (see Figures 2 and 3).
The lineage-specific expansions, in contrast to the
initial duplications, have frequently been tandem in
nature. Such tandem organization increases the likelihood that the duplicated genes could be involved in
concerted evolution [22,23], which our phylogenetic
analyses suggest have occurred in the Lyz and Lyzl1/2
subfamilies. The Lyz subfamily showed the greatest
tendency to tandemly duplicate and evolve in concert,
whereas the other lysozyme-like genes typically showed
conservation in copy number. Tandem duplication or
amplification of the Lyz gene has previously been
observed in certain mammals, including the ruminants
and rodents, where lysozyme appears to function as a
digestive enzyme in the gut [3,25-34]. It is of interest
to note that many of the species that we found to possess multiple Lyz genes – e.g., elephant and wallaby –
are also herbivorous species, and thus may use lysozyme as a digestive enzyme upon gut bacteria. The
need for higher levels of digestive lysozymes in the
guts of fermenting herbivores could have driven the
fixation of the tandem duplications in these lineages.
Gene conversion between the tandem duplicates might
then provide a mechanism whereby favorable mutations in one gene copy could spread to the other
copies in the cluster [33,36], as well as a mechanism
for retention of sequence similarity [24] in welladapted proteins.

Methods
Database Searches

All vertebrate genomes maintained in the Ensembl [16]
and Pre!Ensembl [25] databases (release 57, see Additional file 1: Table S1 for a full list) were searched in
April 2010 for lysozyme-like sequences. We initially
searched the genomes using the tBLASTn algorithm
[20,48] using previously-characterized human and
rodent lysozyme c and lactalbumin sequences. Subsequent tBLASTn searches used all of the identified putative lysozyme-like protein sequences. Similar searches
were conducted using additional databases (e.g., genome
assemblies and ESTs) available at the NCBI website
[49]. After identification of the dog and horse calciumbinding lysozyme gene, the other mammalian genome
assemblies on the Ensembl database were searched using
these sequences using tBLASTn for similar sequences.
All sequences that had E-scores below 0.01 were examined. Sequences identified by BLAST searches were used
in reciprocal BLASTx searches of the human, mouse
and dog proteomes to ensure that their best matches
were lysozyme-like sequences. Sequences that were
unannotated to encode lysozyme-like sequences (see
Additional file 1: Table S1) were examined to identify
potential coding sequences using published methods
[50-52]. Insect and amphioxus lysozyme sequences, used
as outgroups for the phylogenetic analysis (see below),
were identified by searches of the NCBI ENTREZ protein database [49] for Drosophila [53] and amphioxus
[54] lysozymes; these protein sequences were then used
in tBLASTn [20] searches of the Ensembl [16] and NCBI
databases [49] for related sequences. Several insect
sequences were downloaded to represent the diversity of
insect lysozyme sequences.
Genomic comparisons of DNA sequences near the
lysozyme-like genes were conducted using PipMaker
and MultiPipMaker [42,43,55]. Genes neighboring the
lysozyme-like genes were identified from the genome
assemblies at Ensembl [16] and Pre!Ensembl [25]. The
organization of genes adjacent to the lysozyme-like
genes was used to determine whether the genes of interest reside in conserved genomic neighborhoods.
Phylogenetic Analysis

Phylogenies of vertebrate lysozyme-like gene coding
sequences were generated with sequences from human,
mouse, dog, horse, opossum, wallaby, and platypus,
representing the diversity of mammals, as well as those
from other vertebrate species (see Additional file 1:
Table S1) and outgroups (Additional file 18: Table S2).
Lysozyme-like coding sequences were aligned using
MAFFT [56] and Clustal [57], as implemented at the
Guidance web site [58,59], using default parameters. (A

Page 13 of 16

MAFFT alignment of all the full-length sequences is
provided in Additional file 19: Figure S17). Protein
sequences were used as guides to generate the DNA
sequence alignments. The reliability of the alignments
was examined using Guidance [58,59] and trimmed
alignments using sites that had values above the default
cut-off of 0.93 were generated. Insect and/or amphioxus
lysozyme sequences were used to root the trees of vertebrate lysozyme-like sequences.
Phylogenetic trees of the sequences were generated by
a variety of methods including MrBayes 3.1.2 [60,61],
PhyloBayes 3.2f [62], and PhyML [63], MEGA4.0.2 [64],
and PAUP* 4beta10 [65]. Bayesian trees were generated
from coding sequences with MrBayes 3.1.2 using parameters selected by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests
with ModelTest version 3.8, as implemented on the
ModelTest server [66-68]. MrBayes was run for
2,000,000 generations with four simultaneous Metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov chains sampled every
100 generations. The average standard deviation of split
frequencies dropped to less than 0.02 for all analyses.
The first 25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in
with the remaining samples used to generate the consensus trees. Trace files generated by MrBayes were
examined by Tracer [69] to verify if they had converged.
Bayesian phylogenies were also generated from protein
sequences using PhyloBayes, with two chains being used
with the automatic stopping rule set to terminate the
analysis when bpcomp and tracecomp indicated that discrepancies between the chains was equal to or below 0.2
and all effective sizes were greater than 100. The first
10% of the trees were discarded as burnin. PAUP* was
used to construct parsimony trees. Bootstrapped maximum likelihood trees, 100 replications, were generated
by PhyML [63] on the PhyML webserver [70] using
parameters for the substitution model suggested by
ModelTest. The maximum likelihood search was
initiated from a tree generated by BIONJ and the best
tree was identified after heuristic searches using the
nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) algorithm. MEGA4
[64] was used to construct bootstrapped (1000 replications) neighbor-joining distance trees, using either Maximum Composite Likelihood distances for the DNA
sequences or JTT distances for the proteins sequences.
Bootstrapped parsimony trees were also generated by
PAUP [65], with 1000 replications and the same search
method used for maximum likelihood.
With respect to orthology-paralogy issues, the choice
of outgroup, the alignment method (MAFFT [56] or
Clustal [57]), and the use of full-length or trimmed
(based on Guidance scores [58,59]) alignments had little
influence on the key findings of these analyses. Methods
that relied on shorter sequences (i.e., trimmed

Irwin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/166

alignments or protein sequences) or simpler models of
sequence evolution (i.e., neighbor-joining or parsimony)
tended to yield weaker support for the earlier diverging
lineages, but none of our analyses were in significant
conflict with the key inferences of the phylogeny presented in Figure 3.
For phylogenies that contained just mammalian lysozyme-like sequences, Lalba sequences were arbitrarily
used to root the trees. When only mammalian lysozyme-like gene sequences were used for the phylogenetic analyses, then stronger support for each of the
orthologous groups was found with all of the phylogenetic methods used including Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, distance, and parsimony (see
Additional file 4: Figure S3). To generate gene-specific
phylogenies, the platypus sequence was used as a root,
except for Lysc1 and Spaca5 where the platypus does
not have these sequences. For Lysc1, the sloth sequence
was used to root the tree, whereas for Spaca5 the elephant and tenrec sequences provided the root.
