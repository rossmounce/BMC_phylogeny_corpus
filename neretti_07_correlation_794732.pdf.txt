Abstract
Time course gene expression experiments are a popular means to infer co-expression. Many
methods have been proposed to cluster genes or to build networks based on similarity measures
of their expression dynamics. In this paper we apply a correlation based approach to network
reconstruction to three datasets of time series gene expression following system perturbation: 1)
Conditional, Tamoxifen dependent, activation of the cMyc proto-oncogene in rat fibroblast; 2)
Genomic response to nutrition changes in D. melanogaster; 3) Patterns of gene activity as a
consequence of ageing occurring over a life-span time series (25y–90y) sampled from T-cells of
human donors.
We show that the three datasets undergo similar transitions from an "uncorrelated" regime to a
positively or negatively correlated one that is symptomatic of a shift from a "ground" or "basal"
state to a "polarized" state.
In addition, we show that a similar transition is conserved at the pathway level, and that this
information can be used for the construction of "meta-networks" where it is possible to assess new
relations among functionally distant sets of molecular functions.

Background
Time series of gene expression data from high throughput
experiments have been used to infer networks of co-

expressed genes. By following the changes in expression at
the genomic level, it is possible to identify groups of genes
with a similar expression pattern. Most of the techniques

currently used in functional genomics have been adapted
from machine learning and statistical inference. Some of
them generate networks of genes; others simply generate
clusters of genes. Examples of the latter are algorithms
based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) [1-4], PhylogenicType Trees [5-10], agglomerative clustering and partitional clustering. For network determination, techniques
have been developed based on differential equations [11],
Bayesian networks [12], hybrid petri networks [13],
Boolean regulatory networks [14,15].
Relevance networks [16,17] are a popular method for the
analysis of time series of expression levels. The basic idea
is to construct a network of similarity of the genes' expression patterns. Several similarity measures have been utilized, such as correlation and mutual information. This
technique can then represent multiple connections
between genes, and capture negative as well as positive
correlations. Once the matrix containing the similarity
measure for all pairs of genes has been computed, a
threshold is used to define the links in the network. Network validation can be obtained by permutation testing,
i.e. by randomly shuffling the time points independently
for each gene.
A similar approach has been applied to metabolic networks [18,19]. The authors computed metabolite correlations to infer changes in regulation using samples from
different physiological states. On the other hand, we
focused on the analysis of time series of expression levels
for genes that were selected for differential expression
between treatment and control.
An alternative approach is offered by Graphical Gaussian
Models (GGM) that use partial correlation as a measure of
independence between two genes. Partial correlations are
related to the inverse of the correlation matrix, and in
GGMs missing edges indicate conditional independence.
One of the biggest problems with GGMs is that the
number of genes is usually much larger than the number
of samples (e.g. time points), such that the correlation
matrix is usually singular and cannot be inverted. Different approaches have been proposed to circumvent this
problem: restrict the number of genes analyzed to less
than the number of samples [20-22]; use partial correlation coefficients of limited order [23-25]; approach the
matrix inversion as an ill-posed inverse problem through
regularization methods (usually via empirical Bayes, such
as variance reduction) [26,27].
Although co-expression is not a direct indication of coregulation, it is a very useful tool that can be used to interpret the effect of a perturbation in eliciting different phenotypes when combined with an ontology analysis. Here,
we use a correlation based method to generate co-expres-

sion networks on three different datasets and we characterize the change in its structural properties induced by the
system's perturbation. We then use a correlation-based
analysis to infer how the perturbation affects the system at
the level of metabolic and signalling pathways.

Results
We considered three datasets of time course gene expression arrays: 1) Conditional, Tamoxifen dependent, activation of the cMyc proto-oncogene in rat fibroblast; 2)
Genomic response to nutrition changes in D. melanogaster; 3) Patterns of gene activity as a consequence of
ageing occurring over a life-span time series (25y–90y)
sampled from T-cells of human donors.
Gene selection
Due to the heterogeneous nature and properties of the
datasets, we selected the significant genes according to different criteria.

For the cMyc dataset we applied a two way ANOVA (time
and treatment as variability factors) to identify genes
whose expression pattern was significantly affected by
cMyc activation. With this method we identified a set of
1,191 significant genes out of a total of 8,799 [28].
The D. melanogaster diet arrays provide a higher resolution
dataset and genes were selected via GeneTrace, which
looks for change points in the time series of the expression
ratios between the two cohorts. GeneTrace identified
3,519 genes with significant change point. These results
showed that physiological response to nutrient uptake
involves a rapid change in transcriptional profile at a global scale, and that most of the changes are small (81% of
the 3,519 ratios smaller than 1.5 fold).
For the human aging dataset we applied one way ANOVA
(with donors' age as variability factor) with a P value <
0.01 that resulted in a set of 768 probesets selected out of
a total of 14,688 probesets.
Correlation network analysis
When cMyc is activated by Tamoxifen, the activity profile
of the probesets clearly changes into a strongly correlated
regime. These findings are reflected in the histograms of
the correlation coefficients for the N-control and T-treatment data sets (Figure 1) and in the main parameters of
the connectivity distributions obtained from the corresponding adjacency matrices (Table 1). The adjacency
matrix characterizing the network was obtained by considering only the correlation coefficients whose absolute
value exceeded a threshold fixed between 0.95 and 0.99
(we remark that the lower threshold value was higher than
the value requested for a P < 0.05 statistical significance of
the correlation coefficients). The results shown in this

paper were obtained for a threshold equal to 0.98, but
similar results held for the [0.95–0.99] interval. These
coefficients were set equal to 1, producing a symmetric
adjacency matrix alr. For each gene connectivity degree k
was defined as the total number of genes it was connected
to, i.e.

k(l) = ∑ alr For the T-treatment dataset the number of
r ≠l

coefficients close to +1 or -1 increases significantly. This
finding indicates that many of the 1,191 genes, whose
expression levels over time were affected by tamoxifen
stimulation, became either strongly correlated or anti-correlated.

to a Gaussian distribution (bottom row).

over NY-control (top right) the distribution becomes
bimodal and genes tend to be either strongly correlated or
anti-correlated.
We used time reshuffling to test the time sequence
dependence of the results. By randomly shuffling the time
series for each gene separately, time relationships between
expression levels are broken, but the mean and standard
deviation for each gene are unaltered. Properties of the
gene network that truly depend on the expression level
dynamics should be significantly affected by a random
shuffling in time. The bottom row of Figure 2 shows the
result for the D. melanogaster data. In both cohorts this
leads to a Gaussian distribution for the values of the correlation coefficients (Fig. 2 bottom row). Analogous
results have been obtained for the other two datasets (Fig.
1 and Fig. 3).
The role of noise was taken in to account by analyzing the
correlation coefficient distribution obtained from a dataset of randomly generated vectors of the same size than
the experimental datasets (e.g. for the c-Myc dataset: a 5 ×
1191 array of values sampled from the Standardized
Gaussian Distribution [29]). The resulting distribution
strictly resambles that obtained with the no Tamoxifen
dataset.

It is possible to identify a subnetwork of strongly correlated/anticorrelated genes by selecting the probesets
based on the the treatment factor's strength in the ANOVA
analysis. This selection process can be characterized as a
transition from a unimodal (most genes are uncorrelated)
to a bi-modal behavior (genes are either correlated or anticorrelated). Figure 4 shows how this process occurs by
decreasing the cutoff P value (Pthr) used to select significant genes in the cMyc dataset. The different panels show
the histogram of the correlation coefficients between the
expression values over time from the probesets in the
dataset N (left column) and T (right column) for decreasing Pthr. The top row includes all the probesets used in the
analysis (Pthr > 1); the central row corresponds to an intermediate threshold (Pthr = 0.2); the bottom row corresponds to the lowest threshold (Pthr = 0.05). Notice that
the transition from unimodal to bimodal is only present
in the T dataset, while the N dataset in not affected even
when the cutoff P value is very small. Analogous results
have been obtained for the other two datasets.
Pathway analysis
We identified the pathways whose genes' expression was
significantly affected by the system perturbation. We performed this analysis on the D. melanogaster diet dataset
and on the cMyc dataset which share the common feature

of being generated through a direct perturbation of the
system. The problem in this analysis is that different pathways in the KEGG [30] database contain different numbers of genes, and that not all of them had been measured
due to limitations in the microarrays utilized. For this reason we computed the 95% confidence limits for the population proportions (p) of affected genes in each pathway
(see Methods). We found that 45 pathways out of 110
included at least 20% of genes whose expression pattern
changed significantly upon re-feeding (see Table 2). For
the cMyc dataset, a smaller proportion of genes had been
measured in each pathway. Hence, we used a lower
threshold and found that 51 pathways out of 135 had
more than 5% of the measured genes with significant
changes (Table 3).

When we analyzed these pathways with the correlation
method described earlier, we found that the difference in
the correlation distributions between treated and
untreated cases is qualitatively the same as the one
observed in the entire pool of genes selected with the
change point analysis. Figure 5 shows this effect, as well as
the time course of the expression ratios for the Purine
metabolism pathway and the Target of Rapamycin (TOR)
pathway (notice that TOR does not compare in the Table
2, since it is not part of the KEGG database and was
instead manually annotated from the literature). The
same effect was observed in the cMyc dataset, as exemplified in Figure 6 for five representative pathways: (A)
MAPK signaling, (B) calcium signaling, (C) focal adhesion, (D) gap junction, (E) insulin/IGF signaling.

Discussion
In all three data sets different and specific genes are
affected by the perturbations but give rise to a common
correlation profile (Figures 1, 2, 3). This suggests that,
despite their specificity, the global changes in gene expression follow a pattern that is largely independent from the
data sets. This results could be explained by assuming that
temporal changes in gene expression in biological complex systems is scale-independent and characterized by
changes in an initial triggering core of genes (specific to

the perturbation and the cell type) followed by a propagation to other genes.
In particular, in the cMyc dataset we found that the correlation method identifies a list of genes containing many of
the genes found by O'Connell et al. [31], as well as many
genes that, to our knowledge, have not been identified
before. This indicates the possibility that the cMyc regulatory network may be much larger than currently
described. To rule out the presence of undetectable corre-

lations between genes in the unperturbed state (i.e. when
cMyc is not active), we performed a one-way analysis of
variance on the unperturbed dataset to detect genes whose
expression level changes significantly over time. Less than
3% of the genes was selected for differential expression
over time, compared to more than 10% for the perturbed
dataset (P < 0.05).
For the D. melanogaster dataset our analysis showed that
refeeding induces a change in the expression patterns of
thousands of genes. Since this analysis was performed at
saturation, we estimate there are few false positives and
few undetected changes. The analysis of the correlation
between expression patterns reveals that many genes
respond to re-feeding in a coordinated manner. In fact,
upon re-feeding, the activity profile of the genes clearly
changes to a stronglycorrelated/anticorrelated regime.

An extension of this method, based on the cross-correlation between genes belonging to different pathways
allowed us to build a network of relationships between
pathways. In Figure 7 we show changes of a five-nodes
network of selected genes when cMyc is activated. The five
pathways, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling (CS), focal
adhesion (FA), gap junction (GJ), insulin/IGF signaling
(INS/IGF), were among those selected for the large proportion of significant genes (Table 3). The unperturbed
state is characterized by a dominance of random correlations between pathways whereas after the perturbation we
observed the emergence of positive and negative correlation regimes (Figure 6).
The MAPK showed a marked increase in negative correlation with CS and INS/IGF, a doubling in positive correlation with FA and GJ. CS increased the number of

large increase in the anticorrelation with INS/IGF. On the

and progression. The increase in the anticorrelation of
MAPK, FA and GJ with CS and INS/IGF may be interpreted
as a new kind of control by CS and INS/IGF of the other
three pathways.

Overall, our analysis revealed the emergence of positive
links between MAPK, FA and GJ in following cMyc activation, an interesting insight given that the relation between
electrical cell properties and the signaling system is, with-

Conclusion
Three different systems sharing the time series experimental design after a perturbation (cMyc conditional activation, refeeding after caloric restriction and effect of time in
young and old donors) have been examined.

expression dynamics following cell perturbation. We also
showed that this behavior is conserved at the pathways
scale for pathways that have been significantly affected by
the perturbation.
In particular, our analysis revealed the emergence of links
between a core set of pathways in the cMyc dataset which
may play an important role for the comprehension of the
early phenotypical changes following cMyc activation.
This method was successful in identifying changes in gene
expression profiles related to the acute response to a perturbation both in model systems and in humans as well as
in revealing the centrality and importance of selected
pathways by its multiscale generalization.

Methods
Microarray datasets
1) cMyc dataset
Two gene expression data sets were extracted from the set
of microarray experiments based on genetically engineered rat cell lines [31]. The first data set (N data set)
contains the gene expression data for the c -myc-/- MycER
cell line treated with vehicle (ethanol) only. The second
data set (T data set) contains the gene expression data col-

lected after the addition of tamoxifen. Binding of
tamoxifen to the estrogen receptor domain elicits a conformational change that allows the fusion protein to
migrate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor.
Samples were harvested at five time points after the addition of tamoxifen to the culture medium: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16
h. The entire experiment was repeated on three separate
occasions, providing three independent measurements
for each gene and each time point. Expression profiling
was done by using the Affymetrix platform and U34A
Gene Chips.
2) D. melanogaster diet dataset
Newly enclosed virgin females were maintained in yeastfree media until 4 days old and then transferred either to
media with yeast (Y-treatment) or to control media without yeast (NY-control). Samples were collected every hour
for the following 12 hours. Four additional samples were
collected prior to refeeding and arbitrarily designated -4, 3, -2, and -1. Synchronization of the physiological state
was obtained by imposing diet restriction in third instars.
Affymetric gene chips were used to measure mRNA abundance at each hour for both Y-treatment and NY-controls.
A time-ordered sequence of expression ratios was then
computed for each gene in the array [32].

3) Human aging dataset
T-cells were extracted from peripheral blood of 20 healthy
male human donors. Donors were age-stratified into 4
groups of 5 subjects each: 25–35 years old, 40–50 years
old, 55–65 years old and 70–80 years old respectively.
Custom-made microarrays (Unilever Labs, Colworth UK)
with about 19000 human probes were performed in
duplicate (dye-swap) for each subject.
Probeset selection
1) cMyc dataset
A full factorial ANOVA was applied to each of the 8,799
probesets to identify those that significantly changed in
their expression level in time between the two conditions
(data set N versus data set T). Probesets with a P value corresponding to the change-in-treatment factor < 0.05 were
considered to be significantly affected by the treatment
(i.e., activation of Myc by tamoxifen). A total of 1,191
genes were selected using this criterion.
2) D. melanogaster diet dataset
When considering high resolution time series, changepoint analysis [33] is a powerful tool for detecting subtle
changes; it is robust to outliers and can control the overall
error rate. The Tatar group has extended this technique to
statistically detect changes for time-series microarray data
(GeneTrace [32]). For each gene's time-series, the algorithm returns an estimated change-point (CUSUM estimator) and the two-tailed probability of this statistic from
a sample of 10,000 random permutations across all of the
ordered expression ratios. GeneTrace identified 3,519
genes with significant change point (significance threshold = 0.005, expected false positive inferences 70 out of
14,000).
3) Human aging dataset
One-way ANOVA was applied to each of the 14,688
probesets to identify those that significantly change their
expression level in time. With a P value of 0.01, 768 genes
were selected for further analysis.
Correlation analysis
The similarity measure for the expression dynamics of two
genes within the same data set is given by the correlation
between the two expression-level time series. For a given
data set, if xlj is the expression level of a gene with label l
at time j, then the similarity between two genes with labels
l and r, respectively, is given by:

clr =

∑ j ( xlj − μl ) ( xrj − μr )
σ lσ r

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S1/S16

where μl and μr are the averages in time of the expression
levels for the two genes, and σl and σr are their standard
deviations.
Time reshuffling was used to test the time sequence
dependence of the results obtained by the two techniques.
By randomly shuffling the time series for each gene separately, time relationships between expression levels are
broken, but the mean and standard deviation for each
gene are unaltered. Properties of the gene network that
truly depend on the expression level dynamics should be
significantly affected by a random shuffling in time.
Pathway analysis
We ranked pathways based on the percentage of genes
selected by the significance analysis in each one of them.
To account for the different number of measured genes in
different pathways, we computed the 95% confidence
limits for the population proportions (p) of significant
genes in each pathway. Using a relationship between the
F distribution and the binomial distribution [34], the
confidence interval can be computed for the binomial
parameter p [35-37]. The lower confidence limit L1 and
the upper confidence limit L2 become:

L1 =
L2 =

X + (n − X + 1)Fα (2),ν1 ,ν 2
( X + 1)Fα (2),ν1 ,ν 2
′ ′
n − X + ( X + 1)Fα (2),ν1 ,ν 2
′ ′

ν1 = 2(n − X + 1),ν 2 = 2 X

′
′
, ν1 = 2( X + 1),ν 2 = 2(n − X)

where n is the total number of genes measured in a pathway, and X is the number of significant genes in that pathway.
We selected a 20% threshold for the Drosophila array and
5% threshold for the rat array. In fact, the Drosophila
array contained 14,688 probesets corresponding to more
than 90% of the fly's genome. Hence the analysis was
done at saturation. The rat array used in the cMyc experiments contained 8,799 probesets corresponding to
roughly 1/3 of the rat's genome. Requiring a 20% change
in the cMyc experiment would result in a very small list of
pathways. However, it is well known that cMyc affects the
expression of a large pool of genes (directly or indirectly).
Our interpretation is that the same cMyc experiment done
at saturation would reflect this at the pathway level as
well, i.e. many pathways would more than 20% of the
genes with a significant change in expression profile over
time.

Links between selected pathways were generated by computing the correlation of the gene expression time series
between genes in different pathways and generating a
