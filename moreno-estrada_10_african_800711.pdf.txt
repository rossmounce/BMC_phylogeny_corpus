human FOXI1

Abstract
Background: The human FOXI1 gene codes for a transcription factor involved in the physiology of the inner ear,
testis, and kidney. Using three interspecies comparisons, it has been suggested that this may be a gene under
human-specific selection. We sought to confirm this finding by using an extended set of orthologous sequences.
Additionally, we explored for signals of natural selection within humans by sequencing the gene in 20 Europeans,
20 East Asians and 20 Yorubas and by analysing SNP variation in a 2 Mb region centered on FOXI1 in 39
worldwide human populations from the HGDP-CEPH diversity panel.
Results: The genome sequences recently available from other primate and non-primate species showed that FOXI1
divergence patterns are compatible with neutral evolution. Sequence-based neutrality tests were not significant in
Europeans, East Asians or Yorubas. However, the Long Range Haplotype (LRH) test, as well as the iHS and XP-Rsb
statistics revealed significantly extended tracks of homozygosity around FOXI1 in Africa, suggesting a recent
episode of positive selection acting on this gene. A functionally relevant SNP, as well as several SNPs either on the
putatively selected core haplotypes or with significant iHS or XP-Rsb values, displayed allele frequencies strongly
correlated with the absolute geographical latitude of the populations sampled.
Conclusions: We present evidence for recent positive selection in the FOXI1 gene region in Africa. Climate might
be related to this recent adaptive event in humans. Of the multiple functions of FOXI1, its role in kidney-mediated
water-electrolyte homeostasis is the most obvious candidate for explaining a climate-related adaptation.

Background
FOXI1 is a family member of the forkhead-box (FOX)
transcription factors that are characterized by the FOX
~100 amino acid monomeric DNA-binding domain [1].
Different mutations in the human FOXI1 gene and its
regulatory binding site on SLC26A4 (also known as pendrin) have been shown to compromise the transcription
of this anion transporter gene in patients with Pendred
Syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct [2]. Foxi1 has also been recognised as a
key factor necessary for correct patterning of distal
nephron epithelium and adequate acid-base homeostasis
in the kidney causing distal renal tubular acidosis in
Foxi1-/- mice [3]. Moreover, Foxi1 has been reported to

be a crucial activator of the B1-subunit of the vacuolar
H+ -ATPase proton pump (ATP6V1B1) as well as for
pendrin (encoded by SLC26A4) and carbonic anhydrase
II expression in the epididymal cells, which are required
for a correct mouse sperm maturation [4]. Overall, these
findings have led to the hypothesis that mutations in the
human FOXI1 gene might cause sensorineural deafness
with distal renal tubular acidosis and male infertility [4].
Thus, FOXI1 seems to be involved in the acid-base
balance of at least three different organs: inner ear, testis, and kidney. Using human-chimpanzee-mouse orthologous gene trios, FOXI1 was suggested as an example
of a gene involved in hearing that appeared to present a
subset of sites with accelerated amino acid substitution
in the human lineage [5]. However, the availability of
additional FOXI orthologous sequences from a variety of
species, including other primates, has permitted this
initial finding to be revised. Genes involved in sensory
perception show accelerated evolution or are under

positive selection in the human lineage [5,6]. Reproduction was only found as a biological function showing an
excess of positively selected genes when comparing
human and chimpanzee, and thus it could not be established in which of the two branches positive selection
acted [7]. Within humans, adaptation to different
climates may have entailed adapting kidney function to
varying hydration levels. For instance, a thrifty genotype
in water retention is suggested to have been selected in
the gruelling trans-Atlantic voyage of the slave ships,
resulting in a higher prevalence of hypertension in
African-Americans [8]. Moreover, variants influencing
salt homeostasis in the CYP3A5 and AGT loci have
been shown to be targets of a selective pressure varying
in intensity in correlation with latitude [9]. It is of great
interest, therefore, to investigate whether FOX1I has
been the target of local adaptation in humans. In order
to test such a hypothesis, we evaluated the patterns of
nucleotide variation and looked for signals of positive
natural selection in the human FOXI1 gene by resequencing 20 Europeans, 20 Asians and 20 Yorubas and by
assaying SNP variation in 971 individuals from the
Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel; [10]).

Methods
Population samples

Sixty HapMap DNA samples for resequencing were
obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ,
USA). These consisted of 20 Europeans (Utah residents
with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe),
20 Asians (10 Japanese from Tokyo and 10 Chinese
from Beijing) and 20 Yorubas (from Ibadan in Nigeria).
Coriell Repository numbers for these samples are listed
in Table S1 (Additional File 1).
SNP genotypes were obtained for the Human Genome
Diversity Panel (HGDP-CEPH), which contains 1,064
DNA samples from individuals representing 51 populations globally distributed [10]. In all statistical analyses
atypical, duplicated individuals and deduced first-degree
relatives were removed by using the H971 subset recommended by Rosenberg [11]. In order to maximize sample sizes, genotyped samples were re-grouped into
39 populations based on geographic and ethnic criteria
as in Gardner et al. [12]. For part of the analysis, populations were further grouped into seven geographical
regions: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSAFR), Middle EastNorth Africa (MENA), Europe (EUR), Central-South
Asia (CSASIA), East Asia (EASIA), Oceania (OCE) and
America (AME).
All samples used were originally collected with proper
informed consent. The research protocol was approved
by the Clinical Research Ethical Committee of the
Municipal Institute of Health Care (CEIC-IMAS).

Resequencing of the FOXI1 gene

We amplified two overlapping fragments of 2,100 bp
and 2,099 bp covering the entire FOXI1 genomic
sequence. PCRs were performed in a total volume of
25 μl, containing 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 ,
0.5 μM of each primer (Additional File 2, Table S2), 1×
buffer, 0.05 U Taq polymerase (Ecogen), and 10 ng
genomic DNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 3 min
at 94°C, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 3 min; and a final step of extension of
5 min at 72°C. PCR products were purified using MultiScreen PCRμ96 chemistry (Millipore) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Amplified PCR products were
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator chemistry ver.3.1
(Applied Biosystems) and the sequencing primers listed
in Table S2 (Additional File 2). Extension products were
purified using the Montage SEQ96 Cleanup kit (Millipore) and run on an ABI 3730 XL sequencer. Sequence
analysis and contig assembly for each sample were performed with the Seqman module of the DNASTAR
Lasergene software ver. 7.1.0 and visually inspected at
least twice. All polymorphic sites were checked manually
and heterozygote positions were confirmed by reamplifying and resequencing the SNP site from the same or
the opposite strand. Nucleotide sequence data reported
are available in the GenBank database under accession
numbers GU049150 to GU049269.
SNP genotyping data

A total of 21 SNPs covering 400 kb centered on the
FOXI1 gene region were genotyped on the HGDPCEPH diversity panel. SNPs were selected every 5-10 kb
within the gene and up to around 30 kb in both 5′ and
3′ end flanking regions; from this point, an extra SNP
was then added every 40 kb up to around 200 kb in
both flanking regions. Preference was given to SNPs
with a minor allele frequency (MAF) over 10%, which
were compiled from HapMap (Release 7 May 2004) and
dbSNP (Build 121 June 2004) databases. SNPs were
typed using the SNPlex Genotyping System from
Applied Biosystems within a larger set of SNPs covering
additional genes as described elsewhere [13]. Illumina
HumanHap650K Beadchip genotypes on the HGDPCEPH panel were downloaded from the Stanford
Human Genome Center website. From this publicly
available data we extracted a SNP genotype set centered
on FOXI1 and extending up to 2 Mb (with a total of
693 SNPs), which was complemented by 15 of our
previously genotyped SNPs.
Statistical analysis

In order to test for positive selection in the human lineage we initially applied the improved branch-site test 2
of positive selection [14] on a phylogeny containing five

mammalian species (Additional File 3, Figure S1). The
human reference sequence for FOXI1 and its orthologous sequences in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog had
been previously extracted from Ensembl (Gene IDs
ENSG00000168269, ENSPTRG00000017514, ENSM
USG00000047861, ENSRNOG00000006293, ENSCA
FG00000016968) and aligned with ClustalW [15]. The
alignment length was 1,137 bp, which became 1,110 bp
(97.6%) after removing gaps (Additional File 4, Figure
S2). Calculations for the corresponding null and alternative hypotheses were performed using the codeml program implemented in the PAML package [16]. Results
for additional likelihood ratio tests of positive selection
on the human lineage considering different multispecies
alignments were obtained from the Human PAML
browser [17]. Table S3 (Additional File 5) summarises
the likelihood ratio test results for the branch test
(Model H versus Model H null) and for the strict
branch positive site test of positive selection (Model A
versus Model A null).
Arlequin [18] was used to calculate FST values among
the 39 populations studied with a locus by locus Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) [19]. Haplotypes
were inferred from sequencing data using the Bayesian
statistical method in the program PHASE 2.1 [20] using
the default parameter set with 1,000 iterations. Haplotype estimation from the 400 kb and 2 Mb SNP genotype data sets was performed with FastPHASE [21]. The
Network 4.5.0.1 software package (http://www.fluxusengineering.com) was used to construct the minimum
mutation network by means of the median-joining algorithm [22,23]. The ancestral states for the FOXI1 polymorphic positions were inferred from the previously
aligned orthologous sequences in chimpanzee, mouse
and rat but adding macaque (ENSMMUG00000014124)
to the alignment.
Nucleotide diversity statistics and analysis of population polymorphic sites were carried out with the FOXI1
resequencing data and the DnaSP software ver. 4.00
[24]. Departures from neutrality were tested by means
of Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s F, F*, D and D* and Fay and
Wu’s H tests. In order to obtain realistic distributions
for the statistics and thus evaluate evidence for natural
selection, we performed 10,000 coalescent simulations
using Cosi version 1.1 [25]. As some demographic
effects (such as population expansions) and positive
selection have similar effects on genealogies [26] those
simulations included the ad-hoc, continent-specific
human demographic calibration described in Schaffner
et al. [25] and that is provided with the Cosi source
code. We used an infinite-sites model, with S fixed as
the number of segregating sites found, and the length of
the simulated sequence was set to the length of the
sequence analyzed (4,007 bp). The recombination rates

Page 3 of 12

used were those estimated for the region [27]. The critical value for each statistic was obtained from the
empirical distribution of the corresponding neutral
model with a significance level of 0.05. For the whole
human sample, DnaSP software ver. 4.00 [24] was used
to produce coalescent neutral simulations with a constant population size.
For every population we analyzed the distribution of
the minor allele frequencies (MAF) and the derived
allele frequencies (DAF) of the corresponding SNPs
along 2 Mb centered on FOXI1. The proportion of
SNPs with allele frequencies higher or lower than a
defined threshold (MAF <0.10 for the MAF analysis and
DAF >0.80 for the DAF analysis) was calculated within
sliding windows of 100 kb in size every 20 kb and
plotted against distance as in Moreno-Estrada et al. [28].
We constructed independent distributions for each
population with additional genotype data generated elsewhere [28]. Regions enriched by windows in the top 5%
of the corresponding distribution were considered as
outliers. Given their small sample size (<10 individuals),
the San population was not included in the MAF
threshold analysis. Ancestral states for all analyzed SNPs
were obtained from the chimpanzee and/or the macaque
genome sequences (panTro2, Mar. 2006 assembly and
rheMac2, Jan. 2006 assembly, respectively).
Unusually long range haplotypes along the 2 Mb
region centered on FOXI1 were explored by applying
two complementary EHH-based approaches especially
designed to detect intermediate frequency and fixed (or
nearly so) selected variants. For the first approach, we
applied both the Long Range Haplotype (LRH) test [29]
and the iHS statistic [30], and for the second we used
the XP-Rsb statistic [28]. The LRH test was carried out
using the SWEEP software package (version 1.1) defining cores as the longest non-overlapping core haplotypes
with at least one SNP and not more than 20 SNPs. In
order to obtain additional data for a background distribution of EHH values we used phased haplotype data
for eleven 2 Mb regions studied elsewhere [28]. For
each core haplotype identified, we calculated the EHH
and the relative EHH (REHH) at varying distances from
the core for each main continental region separately.
More specifically, marker H (defined as the degree to
which each added marker at a further distance causes
the extended haplotype to decay for all core haplotypes)
of 0.04 and 0.02 were selected as they are roughly
equivalent to a genetic distance of 0.25 and 0.3 cM,
respectively (matching the observed amount of recombination in the actual tested data). Core haplotypes were
placed in 5% frequency bins and the respective EHH
and REHH values were log-transformed for each bin in
order to obtain approximately normally distributed
values. The empirical significance of the LRH test was

Moreno-Estrada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:267
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/267

estimated by means of p and q values as in MorenoEstrada et al. [28]. The Integrated Haplotype Score
(iHS) was estimated as previously described [30,31]
using publicly available genotype data for ~650,000 genome-wide distributed SNPs in 39 populations from the
HGDP-CEPH diversity panel [32]. With an approach
similar to that described by Nielsen et al. [33] to detect
regions with aberrant allele frequency spectra (test 1),
we applied a composite likelihood test to detect regions
with aberrant “iHS spectra”. We first divided |iHS| in
bins of size 0.1, and then estimated the probability that
a SNP had an |iHS| value in a particular bin, both for
each SNP in the whole genome dataset (which produced
an empirical background distribution) as well as for
each sliding window of 31 SNPs over the whole genome.
Two composite likelihoods were estimated for each window, one by multiplying the probabilities obtained from
the window itself, and the other by multiplying the
probabilities obtained from the whole genome. A loglikelihood ratio was then formed comparing both
likelihoods, where extreme values indicate unusual distributions of iHS in the respective window compared to
the rest of the genome. For each SNP this log-likelihood
ratio for the window centered on the SNP is referred to
as windowed iHS in Results. Finally, in order to allow
for multiple population comparisons of EHH, we computed XP-Rsb for every SNP site and population versus
all other HGDP-CEPH populations as described in Moreno-Estrada et al. [28]. In order to assess significance,
we obtained a p-value for each population and SNP site
along the FOXI1 region by ranking its XP-Rsb value
with respect to the genome-wide distribution generated
with the ~650,000 SNPs from Li et al. [32]. We then log
transformed the p-values and plotted them against position, searching for clusters of significant values inside or
around the FOXI1 gene.

Results
FOXI1 divergence patterns

The recent increase of available newly sequenced genomes led us to re-evaluate the initial evidence of nonneutral evolution of FOXI1 in the human lineage
obtained with three-species sequence alignments [5].
When considering a phylogeny of five mammals, the
improved branch-site test 2 of positive selection [14]
rejected the hypothesis of positive selection at a subset
of sites in the human branch (p = 0.7039). We also
investigated the patterns of FOXI1 protein evolution
from several multiple sequence alignments, including
additional non-human primates besides chimpanzee. We
used two maximum likelihood methods (see Materials
and Methods) to specifically test for: (i) a dN/dS ratio on
the human branch significantly different from 1, and (ii)
codon sites with a d N /d S ratio significantly different

Page 4 of 12

from 1 in the human lineage. Overall FOXI1 did not
present significantly accelerated amino acid substitution
rates or particular codon sites undergoing positive selection in the human branch in any of the comparisons
(Additional file 5, Table S3).
Patterns of FOXI1 sequence variation

Polymorphic variation in the FOXI1 gene was investigated by sequencing 4,007 bp, encompassing its two
exons, most of its untranslated regions, and its corresponding intronic region, in 20 Yorubas, 20 Asians and
20 Europeans. We found 22 sequence variations: 21 substitutions and one deletion/insertion polymorphism
(Table 1). Among them, six were singletons: one in Yorubas, three in Europeans and two in Asians. One of the
Asian-specific singletons was the only non-synonymous
substitution observed (rs3828625), an Asn to Ser replacement at amino acid position 362 for isoform a (or
amino acid position 267 for isoform b). The remaining
three exonic polymorphisms were synonymous changes.
Twenty of the 22 sequence variations detected here had
been previously reported in dbSNP build 131. Excluding
singleton variants, we identified a total of 15 haplotypes
(Table 2). Half of the analysed chromosomes belonged
to either Ht-01 or Ht-04, found in all three populations
studied. We found three specific haplotypes for Africans,
three for Europeans, but none specific for Asians. In
order to visualize the phylogenetic relationships among
the identified haplotypes we constructed a median-joining network; ht-08 carried ancestral alleles at each SNP
(Additional File 6, Figure S3). The reticulated pattern
observed in the network points to the action of recurrent mutation or recombination. However, given that
more than one nucleotide position is often involved, the
latter seems more likely as a mechanism for producing
new sequence variation.
Summary statistics of genetic diversity and neutrality
tests for FOXI1 are reported in Table 3. These levels of
diversity are in agreement with estimates from other
genomic regions sequenced in a similar set of samples
(SeattleSNPs database, http://pga.gs.washington.edu/).
Notably, in the Yoruban population the number of segregating sites, and different haplotypes as well as values
of nucleotide diversity were similar to the European
population sample. However, in Africans haplotype
diversity was lower. In order to investigate the possible
genetic footprint of selection we performed several neutrality tests on each of these three populations and on
the whole human sample (Table 3). Significance was
estimated by means of coalescent simulations under
each inferred past demography [25] or in the case of the
whole human sample by considering constant population size. None of the neutrality statistics displayed
significant departure from neutrality (P > 0.05).

Patterns of SNP variation in FOXI1

In order to widen both the genomic context and the
range of human populations analyzed, we also explored
the pattern of SNP variation along a 2 Mb region centered on FOXI1 in 39 worldwide human populations
covering more human genetic diversity than the three
samples we sequenced. In particular, we looked for an
excess of low frequency variants, the presence of high
frequency derived alleles, and unusually long range haplotypes. These possible signatures of natural selection
persist in the human genome at varying time scales, and
therefore give information about adaptative events
occurring at different intervals during our evolutionary
history [34]. For each population and within multiple
100 kb sliding windows along the FOXI1-centered 2 Mb
region we separately plotted: (i) the proportion of SNPs
with MAF <0.10 (Additional File 7, Figure S4) and (ii)
the proportion of SNPs with DAF >0.80 (Additional File
8, Figure S5). In both analyses, no particular pattern

emerged around or surrounding the FOXI1 gene in any
of the populations studied. However, when searching for
signatures of unusually long haplotypes, we found strong
signals from all the three statistics we applied. First,
according to the LRH test [29], up to five different core
haplotypes close to FOXI1 clearly stood out with relatively high frequencies (>0.50) and significant REHH
values in the Yoruba population (see Table 4 and Materials and Methods). A picture of the unusual EHH
breakdown around FOXI1 in Yorubas is presented in
Figure 1. Similarly, in Sub-Saharan Africans (SSAFR)
from the HGDP-CEPH diversity panel, the complete
FOXI1 gene region was clearly enriched for outliers of
the iHS statistic [30], reaching significant values within
the top 1% of the genome-wide distribution (iHS >3)
(see Figure 2). The strongest signals were located inside
FOXI1 and extended several kb downstream in agreement with the location of the most significant core haplotypes observed with the LRH test described above.

circle in the center of each plot indicates the core and each node

indicate the observed haplotypes and the thickness of the branch is
proportional to the haplotype frequency in the population.

When ranking all genes in the genome by their maximum windowed iHS within the gene region (defined as
the longest transcript ± 2 kb), FOXI1 was ranked number 339 out of 17,637 (p-value = 0.019) in the SSAFR
continental sample. Finally, we used the XP-Rsb statistic
[28] to compare the integrated EHH at each particular
SNP site in a population with that averaged across multiple populations (as opposed to comparing the EHH of
alleles within the same population like in the LRH test
and the iHS statistic). Interestingly, a cluster of significant XP-Rsb values was detected in the FOXI1 region
for the Yoruba (p < 0.01) and Mandenka (p < 0.05) African populations. Figure 3 shows genome-wide significance for XP-Rsb at every SNP site and population
plotted against distance along the 2 Mb region centered
in FOXI1. The cluster of significant values involving
FOXI1 was exclusively observed in Africans and also

correlates with the location of the LRH and iHS signals
previously described. Other significant values can be
seen in Figure 3, for example, at 168.5 Mb for the
French population, and around 170 Mb for N. Italy.
These signals lie well beyond FOXI1 and, given the pattern of linkage disequilibrium in the region, are most
certainly unrelated to this gene.
We next explored what may have been the functional
variation underlying the recent selection signal detected
in Africa by these two EHH-based approaches. To that
effect, using HapMap data [35] we studied the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) pattern around FOXI1 in the Yoruban population and found a LD block containing FOXI1
in a region of ~70 kb between two hotspots of recombination. As shown in Figure S6 (Additional File 9), a
similar LD block structure was detected in the Yoruban
population of the HGDP-CEPH panel. Then we
screened all known SNP variation for a putative functional effect using PupaSuite [36,37] in a ~140 kb segment containing the previously identified LD block and
all the significant core haplotypes found in the FOXI1
gene region (see Additional File 9, Figure S6). Out of
646 SNPs we detected 19 as functionally relevant polymorphisms (Additional File 10, Table S4). Since we have
found that the footprint of natural selection seems to be
evident in Africans, we can narrow down that candidate
list by rejecting the SNPs with small frequency differences between Africans and non-Africans. After removing the SNPs with an absolute difference in MAF
between Africans and Europeans smaller than 0.2, only
six SNPs remained. Five of them affect exonic splicing
enhancers either for the DOCK2 gene (rs6555882,
rs1045176 and rs9307) or the FOXI1 gene (rs2277944
and rs6873124), while rs7704953 creates a new transcription factor binding site for FOXI1. Except for
rs6555882, which maps further away, these SNPs are all
within the 70 kb block described above. Therefore, they
(or unknown functional variants in linkage disequilibrium with them) are the best candidates to represent
the functional variation that caused this signature of
selection.
Finally, in order to explore a possible relation between
climate and FOXI1 variation, we tested for correlation
between allele frequencies and absolute latitude for the
SNPs in the significant core haplotypes in the LRH test,
SNPs with significant values for the iHS and XP-Rsb
statistics, and rs2277944 (worldwide allele frequency
distributions were not available for the other suggested
candidate functional SNPs). Out of 27 SNPs, correlation
with absolute latitude was nominally significant (p <
0.05) for 13 of them. All significant core haplotypes contained at least one SNP with significant correlation with
absolute latitude (p < 0.05), and rs2277944 was also significantly correlated with latitude (p < 0.01). The most

significant correlation (Pearson’s r = -0.536, p < 0.01
after Bonferroni correction) was for allele A at
rs7736379 in core ACCC (see Table 4), implying that its
frequency decreases towards higher latitudes (Figure 4).
Since the most significant event to shape human genetic
diversity was the Out of Africa migration, we recalculated partial correlation coefficients with absolute latitude by controlling for the geographical distance to East
Africa (Nairobi). All the significant correlations mentioned above remained significant, implying that the dispersion out of Africa is not a meaningful confounding
factor for this result. However, when put in a genomic
context, these correlations are not exceptional: out of
585,379 SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05 genotyped in the same individuals by Li et al. [32], 8.6% had
more extreme correlations with absolute latitude, and
14% after correcting for distance to East Africa.

Discussion
Genes related to fertility and/or sensory perception may
have been driven by accelerated evolution in humans,
but, contrary to Clark et al. [5], we did not find in the
human branch such acceleration of the FOXI1 gene,
which is involved in the function of the ear, testis, and
kidney [8]. It is recognised that the accuracy and power

of likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for detecting positive
selection improve with the number of species used in
such approaches [38]. Consequently, we used the
Human PAML browser [17] in order to perform both
branch and branch-site tests of positive selection in
multiple species comparisons containing several mammals and additional primates to human and chimpanzee.
None of the tests performed indicated positive selection
for the FOXI1 coding sequence in the lineage leading to
humans. However, ω is ~1 in many branches of the
FOXI1 phylogeny (see Additional File 3, Figure S1),
which suggests that the FOXI1 amino acid replacement
rate is equally fast in all branches and that comparative
LRTs such as the ones performed here may lack power
to detect positive selection in any particular lineage. In
any case, we did not find evidence of a specific evolution
pattern for FOXI1 in the lineage leading to humans.
Variation in the FOXI1 gene sequence was compatible
with neutral evolution in samples of Africans, East
Asians and Europeans. However, patterns of extended
linkage disequilibrium in the FOXI1 gene region suggested recent positive selection in some of the African
samples of the HGDP-CEPH diversity panel [10]. Half

Genevestigator [41] and GeneSapiens [42], FOXI1 has
the highest mRNA expression levels in kidney (but
inner ear data was not available). Fittingly, among the
diverse functions of this transcription factor, its role in
the kidney as a master regulator of vacuolar H+-ATPase
proton pump subunits [8] might be an intriguing candidate function for climate adaptation through water-electrolyte homeostasis and prevention of dehydration. If
that were the case, FOXI1 would join the ranks of the
growing number of known genes such as FABP2, RAPTOR and SLC24A5 [43] that allowed humans to adapt
to the diversity of climates we encountered during our
past expansion.

absolute latitude in 39 HGDP-CEPH populations. The line
represents linear regression.

haplotypes in the LRH test correlated with latitude, suggesting a possible role for climate in the adaptation
mediated by FOXI1. A higher correlation with latitude
may not have been reached due to the apparent recentness of the selective event and its restriction to SubSaharan African populations. An alternative explanation
(but less likely, given the distance to most of the significant signals of selection found) is geographically localized selection at the DOCK2 gene, which encodes for a
cytoplasmatic protein required for lymphocyte chemotaxis in response to chemokines [39]. It is suggested
that patterns of linkage disequilibrium pinpoint recent
selective events, while the accumulation of variation by
mutation requires some time before sequence-based
neutrality statistics become significant [40]. The finding
of no significant deviation from neutral evolution with
statistics such as Tajima’s D, or Fay and Wu’s H has
been previously recognized to be consistent with the
low power of these traditional tests to detect recent
selective sweeps as for example in the case of the G6PD
locus [29]. Moreover, tests based on the allele frequency
spectrum have low power to detect incomplete sweeps,
especially after a selective event in standing genetic variation [40]. Interestingly, while nucleotide and haplotype
diversities tend to be higher in Africans than in other
populations, this was not the case for FOXI1, which
could be taken as further evidence of positive selection
in Africans. No non-synonymous coding SNPs were
found in the core haplotypes or their linked variation.
Therefore, taken as a whole, our results suggest that
recent selection may have acted on the expression rather
than on the amino acid sequence of FOXI1. Based on
two extensive collections of microarray data from a
large variety of available human tissue samples,

Conclusions
We have found no genetic evidence of accelerated protein evolution for the FOXI1 gene in the human lineage;
however, within humans we have discovered signatures
of a recent episode of positive selection in African populations. Our evolutionary approach identifies directions
for future functional analyses of how genetic variation in
the FOXI1 gene region can result in phenotypic differences among human populations, which might be
related to water-electrolyte homeostasis.
