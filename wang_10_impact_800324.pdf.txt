monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes from
wild emmer wheat, primarily from Israel and Golan

Abstract
Background: Various enzyme inhibitors act on key insect gut digestive hydrolases, including alpha-amylases and
proteinases. Alpha-amylase inhibitors have been widely investigated for their possible use in strengthening a
plant’s defense against insects that are highly dependent on starch as an energy source. We attempted to unravel
the diversity of monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes of Israeli and Golan Heights’ wild emmer wheat with
different ecological factors (e.g., geography, water, and temperature). Population methods that analyze the nature
and frequency of allele diversity within a species and the codon analysis method (comparing patterns of
synonymous and non-synonymous changes in protein coding sequences) were used to detect natural selection.
Results: Three hundred and forty-eight sequences encoding monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors (WMAI) were
obtained from 14 populations of wild emmer wheat. The frequency of SNPs in WMAI genes was 1 out of 16.3
bases, where 28 SNPs were detected in the coding sequence. The results of purifying and the positive selection
hypothesis (p < 0.05) showed that the sequences of WMAI were contributed by both natural selection and coevolution, which ensured conservation of protein function and inhibition against diverse insect amylases. The
majority of amino acid substitutions occurred at the C-terminal (positive selection domain), which ensured the
stability of WMAI. SNPs in this gene could be classified into several categories associated with water, temperature,
and geographic factors, respectively.
Conclusions: Great diversity at the WMAI locus, both between and within populations, was detected in the
populations of wild emmer wheat. It was revealed that WMAI were naturally selected for across populations by a
ratio of dN/dS as expected. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the
variations in the SNPs. A sharp genetic divergence over very short geographic distances compared to a small
genetic divergence between large geographic distances also suggested that the SNPs were subjected to natural
selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in polymorphisms at this locus. According to
population and codon analysis, these results suggested that monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors are adaptively
selected under different environmental conditions.

Background
Two major classes of methods are currently in use to
detect natural selection: population methods, based on
analyzing the nature and frequency of allele diversity
within a species, and codon analysis methods, based on
comparing patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous
changes in protein coding sequences. A substantial

private and public effort has been undertaken to characterize SNPs tightly associated with genetic diversity.
SNPs are identified in ESTs, thus polymorphism could be
directly used to map functional and expressed genes [1].
The majority of SNPs in coding regions (cSNPs) are single-base substitutions, which may or may not result in
amino acid changes. However, some SNPs may alter a
functionally important amino acid residue, and these are
of interest for their potential links with phenotypes [2]. If
the phenotypic effect impacts survival and reproduction,
natural selection operates on SNP alleles [3].

Evolutionary pressures of various kinds have often been
hypothesized to cause active and rapid evolutionary
changes. Positive selection is a form of natural selection
that influences the process by which new advantageous
genetic variants sweep across populations. Though
advantageous mutations are of great interest, they are difficult to detect and analyze because neutral and deleterious mutations predominate by frequency. In contrast,
purifying selection is expected to act against mutations
that have deleterious effects on protein structure by causing changes to functionally important amino acid residues or by altering the regulation of gene expression [4].
Since SNPs are almost always bi-allelic, relatively lowgene diversity at a given SNP site is equivalent to lower
allelic frequency than the less frequent of the two alleles.
The reduction of gene diversity at these SNP sites, in
comparison to SNPs in the same genes that do not affect
protein structure, provides evidence that the purifying
selection has reduced the population allelic frequencies
of deleterious SNP alleles [5]. A classic measure for selective pressure on protein-coding genes is the dN/dS (Ka/
Ks) ratio. The ratio of the observed non-synonymous
mutation rate to the synonymous mutation rate can be
utilized as an estimate of selective pressure, where dN/dS
< 1 suggests that most amino acid substitutions have
been eliminated by the purifying selection, while a dN/dS
> 1 indicates positive selection [6].
Wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) presumably
adaptively diversified from northeastern Israel and Syria
into the Near East Fertile Crescent, where it harbors rich
genetic diversity and resources [7]. Previous studies in cereals have shown significant nonrandom adaptive molecular genetic differentiation at single and multi-locus
structures among micro-ecological environments [8,9].
The genetic differentiation of variable wild emmer wheat
populations included regional and local patterns with
sharp genetic differentiation over short distances [10].
Alpha-amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for
the control of seed weevils as these insects are highly
dependent on starch as an energy source [11]. In vitro
and in vivo trials using a-amylase inhibitors, including
those made in field conditions, have now fully confirmed their potential for increasing yields by controlling
insect populations [11]. In cereal seeds, a-amylase inhibitor proteins with 120-130 amino acids, which include
trypsin inhibitors as well as a-amylase inhibitors, can be
grouped into one large family on the basis of the homology between their amino acid sequences [12]. It is
known that the bulk of wheat albumins consists of a
few amylase isoinhibitor families that are very likely
phylogenetically related and coded by a small number of
parental genes [13]. The monomeric, homo-dimeric, and
hetero-tetrameric a-amylase inhibitors (WMAI, WDAI,
and WTAI) are the main members of a family of wheat

kernel proteinaceous inhibitors that are active on exogenous alpha-amylases of various origins. WMAI-0.28,
WMAI-0.39, WDAI-0.19, and WDAI-0.53 were extensively investigated [14,15]. WMAI is a proteinaceous
inhibitor with a molecular weight of 12 kDa; WDAI is a
24 kDa protein formed by the combination of two 12
kDa subunits; WTAI is a mixture (about 60 kDa) of
WTAI-CM2 plus 2 WTAI-CM3 plus WTAI-CM16,
where none of the subunits is active on its own [14,16].
It was well established that each family was closely
related, with largely identical amino acid sequences and
conformational structures, and it was suggested that the
inhibitors derived from common ancestral genes [17]. In
a co-evolving system of plant-insect interactions, plants
synthesize a variety of toxic proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous molecules for their protection against insects
[18,19]. Proteinase inhibitors are therefore a potential
model system in which to study basic evolutionary processes, such as functional diversification [20]. The structure and diversity of WDAI genes in wild emmer wheat
from Israel was revealed, and the relationship between
the emmer wheat genes and ecological factors was elucidated by 16 specific SNP markers [21]. It was found that
the populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide
range of diversity in WDAI, both between and within
populations.
In this study, SNP diversity of the wheat monomeric
a-amylase inhibitor formed 14 natural wild emmer
wheat populations in Israel and Golan. A population
analysis including an examination of its ecological characteristics as well as comparing patterns of synonymous
and non-synonymous changes in coding sequences of all
accessions were also used to detect the natural selection
of genes. The results yielded further insight into the correlation between plant defense proteinaceous inhibitors
and their environmental stresses.

Results
Characterization of monomeric a-amylase inhibitors

Genomic PCR amplifications were conducted by specific
WMAI cloning primers, and desired PCR products were
detected in accessions of wild emmer wheat. A total of
348 novel gene sequences of WMAI were obtained and
submitted to NCBI [GenBank: FJ874277-FJ874629], consisting of 456 bp including a 90 bp signal peptide coding
domain. The frequency of SNPs was 1 out of 16.3 bases
in which 28 cSNPs were detected in the coding
sequence. Some population-specific SNPs were detected,
such as 96G, which was found only in six sequences
from the population of Daliyya (29). All of the 31
sequences from the population of Amirim (24) were
114G, 228C, 246G, 282C, 288G, 297A, 315A, 339A, and
438G while sequences from other populations had SNPs
in these sites (Table 1).

Thirty-three haplotypes were revealed by the sequence
alignment of monomeric a-amylase inhibitor sequences
from wild emmer wheat (Table 1). Haplotypes were
highly separated by Median-joining network analysis,
and at least three groups emerged (Figure 1). For each
haplogroup, there was a primary haplotype (H02, H16,
or H30), while haplotype H16 was the main one occurring in 158 WMAI sequences, followed by haplotype
H10, H30, and H02. The mutations (different SNPs)
between haplotypes and the primary haplotype in each
group were less than five (Figure 1). Our findings indicate that the three haplogroups were not equally distributed (Figure 2). Besides the haplotypes having only one
sequence, some haplotypes were characterized geographically. Fifteen sequences belonging to H15 were from
the Qazrin (5), Gamla (8), Rosh-Pinna (9), Mt. Gilboa
(16), and Amirim (24) populations, which were located
in northern sites of Israel and Golan.
It was found that the SNPs in a-amylase inhibitor
gene sequences could determine amino acid substitution
in proteins (Table 2). Only nine SNPs in the nucleotide
sequence of WMAI resulted in amino acid variations;
among these SNPs, two were at the third codon position, and, as expected, most SNPs that resulted in
amino acid changes were found at the first or second

Page 4 of 13

position (Table 2). Amino acid sequence alignments
indicated that alpha-amylase inhibitors were highly
homologous and belonged to a monomeric a-amylase
inhibitor family including WMAI-0.28 and WMAI-0.39
(data not shown); however, some haplotypes shared the
same deduced protein sequence. The amino acid substitutions probably determined a charge difference resulting in different relative mobility on gel electrophoresis
and in differential inhibitory activities of WMAI-0.28,
WMAI-0.32, WMAI-0.35, WMAI-0.39, and WMAI-0.48
with similar molecular weights [13]. Additionally, ten
Cys were observed in most of the deduced proteins of
the monomeric a-amylase inhibitors, and all cereal-type
a-amylase inhibitors had ten Cys as well. Only seven
sequences belonging to haplotypes H09, H21, H22, and
H23 had Arg128 in place of Cys128 (Table 2). Interestingly, these seven sequences were all from middle Israeli
populations: Mt. Gilboa (16), Beit-Oren (28), and BatShelomo (30), respectively.
Adaptive evolution analysis

The dN/dS ratio is widely used as an indicator of natural
selection in gene sequences. An excess of non-synonymous
mutations relative to synonymous mutations is a clear
indication of positive selection, whereas a lack of

non-synonymous mutations relative to synonymous polymorphisms suggests negative or purifying selection
imposed by functional constraint. To analyze the natural
selection of wild emmer wheat monomeric a-amylase
inhibitors, the dN/dS codon analysis for purifying and
positive selection was calculated.
At first, the software PAL2NAL was used to calculate
the dN/dS ratio for each haplotype compared with the
main haplotype, which was used as a reference (Table
3). The site-specific models implemented in codeml

indicated that both purifying and positive selection had
occurred; however, the purifying selection predominated.
Since the main haplotype was used instead of the original sequence, other methods should be applied to clarify
the selection of this protein.
Next, the selection Z-test was carried out using MEGA
3.1. To determine whether natural selection contributes to
diversity in WMAI, the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions was evaluated for each pair of
haplotypes. The Tajima’s Neutrality test showed that pS
(segregating sites per site) = 0.06, pi (Nucleotide/amino
acid diversity) = 0.02, and D = 0.82. The Z-test results
revealed a very high proportion of sequences that were
under selection across populations; nine haplotype
sequences showed the ratio of dN/dS expected under the
hypothesis of selection (dN≠dS, p < 0.05). These nine
sequences represent cases where a haplotype differed from
the other 32 haplotypes by more than 70%. The results of
purifying and positive selection hypothesis also showed
that the sequences of WMAI were contributed by both
selection hypotheses in this protein (data not shown).
Finally, we assessed positive selection with the FEL
routines by HYPHY [22]. The sequence alignments and
NJ tree were used to calculate the dN/dS (ω) ratio for
each site (Figure 3). The results from HYPHY analyses

confirm the occurrence of selection in WMAI sequences
(Table 4). According to the site-by-site LRT data, it was
indicated that the majority of selected amino acid residues were subjected to purifying selection. The ratio
values of whole sequences were also substantially lower
than 1, indicating that the inhibitors were under strong
purifying selection pressure. However, few amino acid
residues at the C-terminal were positively selected, suggesting that this part of the protein was subjected to
directional or diversifying selection.

the 14 populations of wild emmer wheat were summarized in Table 5. It was obvious that some populations
had higher diversities. The values of He ranged from
0.094 to 0.353 with the population of Beit-Oren (28)
having the highest value (0.353), followed by the population of Nahef (25). The population from Kokhav Hashahar (19) had the lowest He value of 0.094. Genetic
distances (D) were calculated for comparisons of all
populations based on the gene sequences of monomeric
amylase inhibitors among all population pairs (Table 6).
However, low D values ( < 0.050) were observed
between some populations from different areas, and the
estimates of D values were significantly and geographically independent. Large genetic distances and sharp

Multiple regression and Spearman rank correlations
between environmental variables and SNPs

Principle components analysis (PCA) was carried out
using the ecological factors as variables (as listed in
Table 7, except for Sz, Ma, and So). The main ecological
factors were selected for multiple regression analysis,
which was mentioned in our previous paper [20]. Multiple regression analysis was done next using the ecological factors to investigate the relationship between
environmental variables and SNPs. The geography, temperature, water, and solar radiation factors, singly or in
combination, explained a significant proportion of the
diversity in the SNPs (Table 8). The best variable

predictors of He and I were two temperature factors:
Tdd and Trd. The combination of geographic, temperature, and water availability factors were significant (p <
0.05) for genetic diversity (Table 8). SNPs in this gene
could be classified into several categories associated
with water, temperature, and geographic factors, respectively. The best single-variable predictors of SNP allele
frequencies were: (1) water (Dw, Rr, Rv, Hu-14, and
Th); (2) temperature (Tdd, Ta, and Sh); (3) geographic
(Ln, Lt, and Al) factors (Table 8). It was obvious that
water and temperature factors were the best variable
predictors, singly or in combination, with other ecological factors (Table 8).
Spearman rank correlations of ecological factors and
genetic diversity of each of the SNP sites were shown in
Table 8. Only one SNP was correlated with geographical
factors (WMAI-451G was negatively correlated with Ln,
rs = -0.521). Seven SNPs were positively or negatively
correlated with the temperature factors of Tm, Ta, Td,
Sh, and Tdd; another three SNPs were correlated with
water (Table 9).

Genetic polymorphism of a-amylase inhibition sequences

The present study analyzed the extent of genetic polymorphisms and the effect of diversifying selection on
SNPs in wild emmer wheat monomeric a-amylase inhibitor sequences among specific Israeli and Golan
Heights’ populations. This is the first time large numbers of emmer wheat accessions were sequenced for
functional protein genes and natural selection is
depicted on a modeled structure. Although SNP markers had already been used to assay the polymorphism
of dimeric inhibitors, only 20% of SNP sites were successfully analyzed by the markers [21]. We obtained 384
WMAI gene sequences from 14 populations that
belonged to 33 haplotypes, and 28 SNPs were detected
(Table 1).

*For instance, populations 5 and 30 were collected from two sites that were 80 km away from each other, while populations 11 and 24 had only 10 km distance.
The geographic distances of the first group were 8 times further than the second, but the genetic distance was only 1/25.

Different amino acid residues determined by polymorphic sites would significantly affect the structure,
charge, and function of the inhibitors. The charge difference could be responsible for the relative mobility of gel
electrophoresis and the differential inhibitory activities
of a-amylase inhibitors [23]. In former investigations,
more than five inhibitor proteins belonging to the

WMAI family had been found, such as inhibitor 0.28,
0.32, 0.35, 0.39, and 0.48. They had similar molecular
weights but different inhibiting activity [13]. The relationship between nucleotide polymorphisms and the
amino acid changes in WMAI were summarized in
Table 2. Only 11 SNPs in the nucleotide sequence of
WMAI resulted in amino acid variations. Most

polymorphic sites did not occur at the functional conservative site, which ensures the a-amylase inhibitors
maintain their ability to combine with a-amylase. All
cereal-type a-amylase inhibitors had 10 Cys (5 disulfide
bonds). Both WMAI 0.28 and 0.39, similar to WDAI
0.19, were readily inactivated by treatments that break
disulphide bonds, thus indicating that their stability
mainly depends on the integrity of their disulphide
bridges [24]. By combining FAB-MS and automatic
sequencing, it was possible to assign the five disulfide
bonds of the a-amylase inhibitor 0.28 from wheat kernels as follows: Cys7-Cys54, Cys21-Cys42, Cys29-Cys82,
Cys43-Cys98, and Cys56-Cysl13 [25]. The monomeric
a-amylase inhibitors from Israeli and Golan Heights’
populations had 10 Cys (except for 7 accessions), and
the positions of the 10 Cys were conserved. Most of the
SNPs did not occur at highly conserved positions, which
ensured that the a-amylase inhibitors would keep their
correct 3D structure to combine with a-amylase.
The mutants obtained by García-Maroto et al. (1991)
allow the identification of two regions of the molecule
that are critical for inhibition mechanisms: the N-terminal sequence (positions 31-36; the signal peptide residues were 1-30) before the first Cys (Cys37) and the
sequence after the seventh Cys, which is right after a
CRC (positions 84-86) motif [26]. According to the
alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of emmer
wheat WMAI, no amino acids were changed by nucleotide mutations in this domain (Table 2). The majority of
changes in amino acids occurred at the C-terminal, and
most of the amino acids in the middle domain were
conserved, ensuring the stability of WMAI (Table 2).
Although the most important positions were conserved, position analysis of the ratio of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions provided strong evidence
for natural selection acting on WMAI. The dN significantly differed from dS according to PAL2NAL results.
However, the whole sequences dN/dS < 1 suggested
that the inhibitors were under strong purifying selection
pressure (indicating that there might be a structural
requirement) and that amino acids at the C-terminal
were positively selected; in other words, amino acidaltering substitutions offer fitness advantages that would
result in the diversity of WMAI.
Ecological Genetics and Evolution of WMAI

Experimental populations evolving under natural selection represent an interesting tool to study genetic bases
of adaptation [27]. The ecological genetic analysis was
carried out to investigate the evolutionary mechanism of
WMAI from wild emmer wheat. The diversity of
WMAI gene sequences from Israeli and Golan Heights’
populations was revealed. Populations could be divided
by SNPs, even within closely related populations

Page 10 of 13

originating in approximate geographic locations. Our
results demonstrated that the polymorphism of monomeric a-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat
was correlated with the ecogeographic distribution of
the accessions. Observations were consistent with previous results on other seed storage proteins such as
HMW-GS and WDAI according to molecular markers
[21,28-30].
Central populations used in this study were collected
in warm, semi-humid environments on the Golan Plateau and near the Sea of Galilee. Marginal steppic populations were collected across a wide geographic area on
the northern, eastern, and southern borders of wild
emmer distribution involving hot, cold, and xeric peripheries; while marginally mesic (Mediterranean), populations were collected from the western border of wild
emmer distribution [31]. The present study included 14
populations from different sites in Israel and Golan, and
covered a wide range of ecogeographical conditions
across the distribution range of the species. Specific
SNP positions detected in WMAI were found highly
effective in distinguishing genotypes and populations of
wild emmer wheat originating from diverse ecogeographic sites in Israel and Golan. High levels of polymorphic loci (P), expected heterozygosity (He), and
Shannon’s information index (Table 5) with high genetic
distance values between populations were found (Table
6). These results suggest that genetic variation at these
SNP positions in the WMAI was at least partly ecologically determined for these populations.
The relationship between SNP genetic distance and
geographical distance was investigated, and it was found
that the estimates of genetic distance (D) were geographically independent. Sharp genetic divergence (large D)
over very short geographic distances against small
genetic divergence (small D) between large distances
were observed, which was also found by allozymes,
RAPD loci, SSR, and SNP marker analysis [21,32,33].
For example, the genetic distance between populations
of Tabigha(11) and Amirim(24) (located only about 10
km apart with D = 0.1819) was 25 times higher than the
genetic distance between populations Qazrin(5) and
Bat-Shelomo(30) (separated by 80 km with D = 0.0072)
(Figure 1).
Collection areas of wild emmer were different in altitude, longitude, latitude, and several other environmental factors (Table 7) [31]. It was noteworthy that SNPs
in WMAI were correlated with ecological factors by
multiple regressions and the Spearman rank correlations’ matrix. Among the 28 SNPs, 11 SNPs led to
amino acid changes at nine positions (Table 2). It was
shown that these SNPs were significantly more correlated with water availability factors (Rv and Dw), temperature factors (Ta, Sh, and Tdd), and geographical

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:170
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/170

factors (Ln, Al, and Lt) than the other factors (Table 8).
Ecogeography, temperature, and water availability factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant
proportion of the diversity in SNPs of a-amylase inhibitor genes. Diversity could be further explained by
changes in ecological factors, i.e., Al (altitude), the sharp
gradient of climatic conditions from north to south in
Israel and Golan, with increasing temperatures and
decreasing water availability towards the semiarid zones
in southern Israel. Also, ecological factors taken into
account for this study were not representative of all the
possible components involved in the determination of
the actual climate [32,33].
Environmental stress can greatly influence plant susceptibility to herbivores and pathogens, and drought
stress can promote outbreaks of fungal diseases and
plant-eating insects [34,35]. Herbivore insects and the
level of herbivore pressure may vary with ecological factors. Different herbivore-related selection pressures at
these ecological locations may influence polymorphism
of insect-resistant loci in wild emmer wheat [21]. Different environmental pressures at each site related directly
to the climate, but WMAI expression responded indirectly to environmental factors. It is possible that several
evolutionary mechanisms underlie the differences in
diversity of a-amylase inhibitors and ecological factors.
It could be concluded that the variation in genetic diversity of the WMAI gene between populations is a product of selective forces.
The genetic structure of wild emmer wheat populations in Israel is mosaic [30]. This patchy genetic distribution appears to reflect the underlying ecological
heterogeneity at micro- and macro-scales [32,33,36,37].
Thus, higher polymorphisms and genetic variations of
WMAI within and between populations could be
explained as adaptive complexes generated by natural
selection and co-evolution with insects.

Conclusions
Alpha-amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for
the control of seed weevils, as these insects are highly
dependent on starch as an energy source. A total of 348
gene sequences of wheat monomeric a-amylase inhibitor (WMAI) were obtained; the frequency of SNPs was
1 out of 16.3 bases; 28 SNPs were detected in the coding sequence. Great diversity at WMAI loci, both
between and within populations, was detected in the
populations of Israeli and Golan Heights’ wild emmer
wheat. It was revealed that WMAI were naturally
selected for across populations by the expected ratio of
dN/dS. The results of purifying and positive selection
hypothesis (p < 0.05) showed the sequences of WMAI
were contributed by both natural selection and co-

evolution, which ensures the conserved function as well
as the inhibition of a variety of insect amylases. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in SNPs. The conflict
between genetic divergence and geographic distances
also suggested that the SNPs in WMAI were subjected
to natural selection, and ecological factors had an
important evolutionary role in gene differentiation at
this locus. These results suggested that a-amylase inhibitors are adaptively selected under different environments according to population and codon analysis.

Methods
Plant material and ecological background of wild emmer
wheat

Wild emmer wheat (T. dicoccoides) is the wild progenitor of modern tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, which is
predominantly a self-pollinated wheat distributed over
the Near East Fertile Crescent [38]. A center of distribution and diversity of emmer wheat was found in the
catchment area of the upper Jordan Valley in Israel and
its vicinity [7]. Wild emmer wheat included 114 accessions from 14 populations, collected from various locations in Israel and Golan, which are representative of a
wide range of ecological conditions such as soil, temperature, altitude, and water availability. Individual
plants of emmer wheat were collected at random, at
least 1 m apart, from populations differing in major ecological properties. These collection sites and populations
have been described in detail in the literature [7,31].
The genotypes used for the present study are conserved
in the cereal gene bank of the Institute of Evolution,
University of Haifa. Populations used in this study along
with their geographic origins and climatic conditions are
listed in Table 7.
DNA isolation and PCR amplification

Ten seeds of each accession were germinated in the
dark at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted
from plant leaves at about two weeks of age with a
modified CTAB protocol as described in Murray and
Thompson [39]. Specific primers (F: ATGTGGATGAAGACCGKGTT; R1: GACTAGRYGTCCGKATACGC;
R2: CACGCACCGCACCATTACTT) for WMAI were
used to amplify the gene coding sequences [40]. PCR
amplification was performed with PTC-240 cycler (BioRad) in a volume of 50 μL, which consisted of about
100 ng of genomic DNA, 100 μM of each dNTPs, 1 μM
of each primer, 1U Taq polymerase, 1.5 mM Mg2+ in
1 × PCR buffer. The cycling parameters were 95°C for
5 min to pre-denature, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for
1 min, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min with a final
extension at 72°C for 5 min.

SNPs mining and haplotype identification

POPGENE 1.32 [45] was used to analyze genetic polymorphism (P), expected heterozygosity (Nei’s gene diversity) (He), and Shannon’s information index (I) for each
SNP position and population. STATISTICA version 6.0
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/stathome.html was
used to perform PCA analysis, stepwise multiple regression (MR), and Spearman rank correlation coefficients.
Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the
best predictors using SNP frequencies as dependent variables and the ecogeographic factors as independent variables at each of the polymorphic SNP loci. Spearman
rank correlation coefficients were used to assess differences in genetic indices P, He, and Shannon’s information index in climatic variables for 14 populations.

Amplification products were separated in 2% agarose
gels. Since the WMAI are encoded by multigenes, the
desired DNA fragments were ligated to the pBluescript
SK (+) T-vector plasmid (Stratagene), and then five
positive clones were screened and sequenced.
The alignment of sequences and the SNP assessment
were carried out using the multiple-sequence alignment
software Clustal W http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw and
DNAman 5.2.2 http://www.lynnon.com. The a-amylase
inhibitor ORFs were translated into amino acid
sequences using the ORF Finder program at the NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Polymorphic positions
were identified by MEGA version 3.1 [41] and were
used in place of all of the mutations’ positions (the positions with change observed only once in the dataset
were removed) in the subsequent analysis.
Subsequently, the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes from
wild emmer wheat were analyzed by the median-joining
network method [42], which was suitable to analyze the
sequence from wheat and Aegilops species [43], and the
phylogenetic clusters were demonstrated by using the
program Network 4.5.1.0 http://www.fluxus-engineering.
com/sharenet.htm. Since no phylogenetic study had
been performed on alpha-amylase inhibitor gene types, a
median-joining (MJ) network based on the sequence
alignment of haplotypes was constructed.
Selective pressure analysis

Codon-based Z-test to selection (p < 0.05) was carried
out by using MEGA version 3.1 [41] to estimate nucleotide sequence divergence distances from synonymous
and non-synonymous sites with the Nei-Gojobori model
in standard error determined from 1000 bootstrap replicates. Ratios of non-synonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site were computed for haplotypes of
WMAI by PAL2NAL http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/
using codon-based maximum likelihood methods contained in the codeml program of the software package
PAML (dN/dS: dN/dS-value > 1 indicates positive selection, dN/dS < 1 purifying selection, and neutral evolution when dN/dS = 1) [44]. We also analyzed the
selection of a-amylase inhibitor sequences with the program HYPHY http://www.hyphy.org version 1.002 beta
[22]. FEL analyses were applied; all analyses employed
the MG94 model of codon substitution. Results were
considered significant when P value < 0.05. The
sequence alignments and NJ tree were used to calculate
the dN/dS (ω) ratio for each site.
Ecological genetics analysis

The programs POPGENE 1.32, and STATISTICA 6.0
were used to carry out the ecological genetics analysis.
