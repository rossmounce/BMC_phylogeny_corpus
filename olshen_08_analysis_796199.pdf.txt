Abstract
Background: Genetic isolates such as the Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) potentially offer advantages in mapping novel loci in whole
genome disease association studies. To analyze patterns of genetic variation in AJ, genotypes of 101 healthy individuals were
determined using the Affymetrix EAv3 500 K SNP array and compared to 60 CEPH-derived HapMap (CEU) individuals. 435,632
SNPs overlapped and met annotation criteria in the two groups.
Results: A small but significant global difference in allele frequencies between AJ and CEU was demonstrated by a mean FST of
0.009 (P < 0.001); large regions that differed were found on chromosomes 2 and 6. Haplotype blocks inferred from pairwise
linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistics (Haploview) as well as by expectation-maximization haplotype phase inference (HAP)
showed a greater number of haplotype blocks in AJ compared to CEU by Haploview (50,397 vs. 44,169) or by HAP (59,269 vs.
54,457). Average haplotype blocks were smaller in AJ compared to CEU (e.g., 36.8 kb vs. 40.5 kb HAP). Analysis of global
patterns of local LD decay for closely-spaced SNPs in CEU demonstrated more LD, while for SNPs further apart, LD was slightly
greater in the AJ. A likelihood ratio approach showed that runs of homozygous SNPs were approximately 20% longer in AJ. A
principal components analysis was sufficient to completely resolve the CEU from the AJ.
Conclusion: LD in the AJ versus was lower than expected by some measures and higher by others. Any putative advantage in
whole genome association mapping using the AJ population will be highly dependent on regional LD structure.

Background
As a result of the completion of the HapMap [1], and the
development of platforms for high-throughput SNP genotyping, it is now possible to carry out genome wide association studies to map novel disease associated loci [2-6].
Typing a dense panel of SNPs across the genome permits
the identification of genetic variants associated with disease. It has been proposed that the study of "founder populations" derived from genetic isolates may improve the
efficiency of mapping polygenic traits [7]. One example of
a genetic isolate is Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), where the combination of random genetic drift and at least three population "bottlenecks" resulted in a limited number of
founder mutations associated with common inherited
diseases [8-10]. At the outset of these studies, our working
hypothesis was that the younger overall age of such populations should permit a smaller number of SNPs to
explain the overall genetic variability.
In the AJ population, in disease bearing individuals, haplotype blocks, or regions of linkage disequilibrium (LD)
associated with disease, are indeed large, on the order of
one to10 Mb in the regions immediately surrounding
founder mutations. AJ disease with these characteristics
includes hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [11,12].
Therefore, we reasoned that a systematic genomic analysis
of LD structure in AJ would facilitate genome wide association studies to identify cancer-susceptibility loci in AJ.
Consequently we set to better understand patterns of
genetic variation in this group, including allele frequency
spectra, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions,
differences in allele frequencies from other European populations, including patterns of LD.

Methods
Study population
The study enrolled 102 healthy AJ women who either
accompanied male urology patients identified through
the Urology Clinic or who were participating in cancer
screening at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC). Participants completed a self-administered
questionnaire about their medical history, date of birth,
date of last mammogram, race, religious affiliation, as
well as country of birth and religious affiliation of grandparents. To be eligible for enrollment in this study, individuals must have indicated that all four grandparents
were Jewish and of Eastern European ancestry. Any
woman who indicated a prior diagnosis of breast cancer,
atypical hyperplasia, or lobular carcinoma in situ was not
eligible for this study. Informed consent and blood specimens were obtained from these women under an IRBapproved protocol at MSKCC. One research subject withdrew permission to use her DNA prior to laboratory analysis. That sample and related records were redacted from
the study. The remaining subjects enrolled in this study

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/14

were the first 101 individuals of a planned ascertainment
of 300 control individuals from another ongoing study.
AJ genotyping
Preparation of genomic DNA from blood was performed
as previously described [13]. Genotyping was carried out
using Affymetrix GeneChip Early Access Version 3 (EAv3)
Human Mapping Arrays. Use of Affymetrix EaV3 chips for
genotyping was performed as described in the Gtype 4.0
manual [14] except that 150 ng of all genomic DNA samples were evaluated for quality by gel electrophoresis. Following qualification of the DNA samples, each sample
was divided into two aliquots. Sequence complexity was
reduced by restriction enzyme digestion with either NspI
or StyI, and a biotin-labeling primer amplification assay
was performed on each DNA aliquot. Hybridization of
the amplified probes was then performed on specific NspI
or StyI arrays, as appropriate.

Microarray output was analyzed using the Bayesian robust
linear modeling using Mahalanobis distance (BRLMM)
algorithm [15]. This is a modification of a published algorithm that normalizes fluorescent signals across multiple
chips and makes inference across multiple SNPs to render
more accurate calls [16]. In addition, the Bayesian component helps to reduce the bias against heterozygote calls
(relative to the prior dynamic modeling algorithm). Only
those 435,632 SNPs present both on the EAv3 and the
Affymetrix 500 K commercial array that had dbSNP rs
numbers were included in further analyses. Of these,
221,233 SNPs were present on the NspI array and 214,399
SNPs were present on the StyI array. Mapping of the SNPs
to the May 2004 (NCBI build 35, hg 17) coordinates was
possible through the annotation files supplied by Affymetrix [17].
The distribution of SNPs on each chromosome arm
(Additional File 1, Table S1) was approximately proportional to the size of the arm, with the exceptions of arms
19p, Xp, and Xq, each of which had fewer than 80 SNPs
per Mb compared to the average of 163 SNPs per Mb for
the other chromosome arms. The other exception was
chromosome 21p, which was represented by a total of
only 4 SNPs. For the 43,998,832 attempted genotype
calls, a total of 511,653 were no calls (1.1%). Overall, the
percentage of no calls per SNP ranged from 0% to 72%
(SD, 2.7%) (Additional File 2, Fig. S1). The percentage of
no calls per SNP ranged from 0% to 72% (SD, 2.9%) for
the NspI array, and 0% to 50%, (SD, 2.4%) for the StyI
array. With respect to the two arrays (Additional File 3,
Fig. S2), the percentage of no calls for the NspI array
ranged from 0.4% to 4.6% (SD, 0.6%) and the percentage
of no calls for StyI array ranged from 0.2% to 4.5% (SD,
0.7%). Every statistic presented here was recalculated for a

more limited set of SNPs (167,676) that had completion
rates of 99.6% or above.
CEU genotyping
Data from 60 CEPH-derived CEU subjects that were also
part of the HapMap Project [18] were included in the
analysis for reference. These 60 individuals were the parents of 30 trios, with the children excluded so that the genotype data could be considered independently. These
experiments were performed by Affymetrix [19]. As with
the AJ population, CEU genotypes were determined using
the BRLMM algorithm. Of 26,137,920 attempted genotypes on the CEU population, there were 145,402 (0.6%)
no calls, lower than the1.1% no call rate for the AJ (Additional File 4, Fig. S3). The percentage of no calls by SNP
ranged from 0% to 68% (SD, 1.7%), with a range of 0%
to 43% (SD, 1.8%) for the NspI array and 0% to 68% (SD,
1.5%) for the StyI array. With respect to the two arrays
(Additional File 5, Fig. S4), the percentage of no calls
ranged from 0.1% to 2.7% (SD, 0.7%) for the NspI array
and 0.1% to 2.4% (SD, 0.4%) for the StyI array. For each
of the 90 CEU individuals, there were 489,913 genotype
calls available from the HapMap web site (HapMap version 20, July, 2006). When compared with the commercial Affymetrix chip, there was 99.4% concordance
(43,638,269 genotype calls agreed). In making this assessment, there were 67,394 absolutely discordant genotype
calls (called heterozygous in HapMap but homozygous by
Affymetrix array or vice-versa), leading to mean call confidence scores for AJ and CEU that were within 3% of each
other but significantly different. These differences and
slight discordance probably reflects the large number of
SNPs analyzed and use of the Affymetrix commercial
arrays for the CEU analysis and early release arrays for the
AJ analysis.
Determination of SNP frequencies and Hardy-Weinberg
departures
Several SNP characteristics were compared between the AJ
and CEU subjects. Minor allele frequencies for each SNP
were compared between populations using Fisher's exact
test, with the Bonferroni method used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Global patterns in allele frequency were
examined using the fixation index of the subpopulation
within the total (FST) [20] and the Wilcoxon signed rank
test to assess significance. The Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficient (DA) was calculated in order to assess
both magnitude and direction of departures from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) [20]. It is noted that the
sign of DA for any departure is precisely the same as the
sign of the fixation index for the individual within the
subpopulation (FIS), which can be derived from DA by a
simple algebraic manipulation. Exact tests of HWE were
computed as described [21]. Regions out of HWE were
identified using circular binary segmentation (CBS) with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/14

a chi-square statistic instead of a t-statistic [22]. This recursive algorithm was applied one chromosome at a time.
The rates of heterozygosity were also computed, as was
FST. Also computed were Nei's [23] standard genetic distance measure (Ds) and six recent implementations of the
information theoretic measures. These included entropy
for admixed populations, assuming three different admixture percentages: 10%, 50% (maximum admixture) and
90%. Additionally, three information theoretic measures
that may be useful for differentiating individuals within
populations on the basis of selected SNPs were computed:
two forms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and an informativeness for assignment statistic suggested by Rosenberg
et al. [24]. The results from these last two sets of analyses
are available on our public browser described in a subsequent section. For the X-chromosome analyses of HWE
and computation of genetic measures, only the 30 females
in the CEU data set were included.
Linkage disequilibrium and haplotypes
A major argument for using founder populations for
genetic mapping is that they may be expected to display
greater levels of LD and lower haplotype complexity. In
order to test the former hypothesis, a subset of SNPs passing HWE criteria and having a minor allele frequency of
greater than 10% in both populations was identified. The
standard LD estimators r2 and D' were calculated, restricting the analysis to SNP pairs within 500 kb of one
another. Since both estimators are influenced by sample
size, the same number of AJ and CEU individuals were
compared. To accomplish this, six sets of 60 AJ individuals
were randomly selected from the 101 total AJ individuals.
A nonparametric sign test was used to test significance of
the difference in LD between the CEU and AJ. For each
subset of 60 AJ and 60 CEU, the test was performed on the
total set of SNP pairs, on a subset of SNP pairs where each
SNP was tested only with its nearest neighbor (if a SNP
did not have a neighbor within 40 kb, that SNP was
dropped), and to examine longer range LD, on a subset of
SNP pairs where each SNP was tested with another SNP
approximately 200 kb away. This same sign test was also
used in 1 Mb windows in order to identify local regions of
the genome showing exceptional differences in LD patterns. In addition, the decay of LD over distance was
examined by plotting average r2 between SNP pairs across
a wide range of distances from 0–5, 5–10, out to 475–500
kb apart. Here, r2 was averaged over the six sub-samples of
60 AJ and 60 CEU.

As an additional metric to compare LD between the two
populations, the proportion of SNP pairs with no evidence of recombination (D' = 1.0) at different distance
intervals between the SNPs was examined (the same
described above for the decay of r2). The same sample

sizes of 60 AJ and 60 CEU were used, and averaged across
the six replicates.
Haplotype blocks were estimated in two ways. The first
was by using the HAP program to infer linkage phase relationships and reconstruct chromosomal haplotypes
[25,26]. This algorithm determines local haplotypes by
exploiting the correlation between SNPs in physical proximity resulting from LD using a genealogy based model of
perfect phylogeny. The reconstructed chromosomal haplotypes were partitioned into blocks of limited diversity. A
haplotype block is defined here as a span of SNPs such
that haplotypes with a minimum frequency of 5%
account for at least 80% of the haplotypes in a block. Separate block partitions for samples in each of the two populations were determined. (HAP derived haplotype blocks
by chromosome are available upon request from the
authors.) Another haplotype block definition utilized was
the default settings of Haploview [27], which uses pairwise LD statistics to implement the methods of Gabriel et
al. [28]. One key difference between HAP and Haploview
is that the former assigns every SNP to a haplotype, while
the latter constructs haplotype blocks based only on pairwise LD. Triangle diagrams derived from the Haploview
data are available [29].
Homozygosity mapping
Homozygous tracts were defined using an extension of the
likelihood-based method originally applied to short tandem repeat polymorphisms [30]. A log likelihood odds
(lod) score was calculated at each SNP, contrasting the
likelihood of observing the genotype assuming the surrounding segment is autozygous (as opposed to not
autozygous). The method accounts for population-specific allele frequencies as well as for genotyping error and
mutation (combined term, ε = .005). Since SNPs are not
independent, the lod score was adjusted using a log-transformation of a recombination measure (rec_val, in cM/kb,
from the Oxford HapMapI r16c.1 UCSC tract) at each SNP
position, according to the formula (1 + log10(1 – (0.39 –
rec_val))). For every run of two or more consecutive
homozygous SNPs in an individual, the adjusted lod
scores were summed and a homozygous tract was defined
when the score reached 20. Homozygous tracts were not
disrupted by SNPs with missing information ("no call"),
which did not contribute to the score, and tracts were not
allowed to cross centromeres or gaps in the human
genome assembly of estimated size of 50 kb or greater. To
compare populations, the proportion of the genome
within homozygous tracts and the tract length (kb) were
compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (two-sided Z
approximation).

Additional data sets examined
Subsequent to detailed examination of the 101 AJ and 60
CEU genotype data sets just described, we sought to verify
our results: For this purpose, we culled any SNP with more
than two no calls based on a theoretical optimization of
our heterozygosity detection. This resulted in a dataset of
167,676 SNPs on which we performed each analysis. In
addition, we carried-out a cross-examination with additional data. For this purpose, we examined the ~317,000
genotypes from 151 Jewish women included in a recent
study [31]. We ran HaploView on this dataset using the
default parameters previously described. The results of
each of these validation data sets are displayed on our
public browser described in a subsequent section.
Principal components analysis
In order to determine whether the two populations were
sufficiently differentiated to resolve them based on examination of these SNP sets, we applied the numerical methods implemented in the Eigenstrat package [32]. Rather
than use the second half of the package to adjust association p-values for population stratification, we used only
the Principal Components analysis portion (pca) of the
package and graphed the result of Component 1 versus
Component 2. In addition to the graph presented, we
applied this pca to both the data described in a recent
study [31], and to the data in the SNP set reduced to minimize no calls (the 167,676 SNPs described above). Each
set of data provided comparable results. To confirm all
derived indices measuring excess heterozygosity, rate of
LD decay over genetic distance and measures of global
patterns of allele frequency difference such as FST, we
recalculated these measures on the cohort of 87 AJ subjects that remained after 14 outliers detected by pca were
removed.
Browser and software
The generic genome browser, gbrowse [33], was used to
create a visual display of project data. This visual display
is publicly available and can be accessed from the main
page of that URL under the rubric "Projects" [34]. The data
on that browser include: 1) call consistency measures
based on mean Wilcoxon's signed rank test P-values for
BRLMM call confidence; 2) Hardy-Weinberg compliance
statistics; and 3) human population genetic distance
measures. The R-statistical package was used extensively
for summary graphics. Data analyses were performed with
SAS, SAS/Genetics, SPSS or R, unless otherwise noted.

Results
SNP characteristics
There were 39,664 (9.1%) monomorphic loci in the AJ
population and 54,170 (12.4%) in the CEU population,
with a strong overlap; 35,269 (89.8%) of monomorphic
AJ were monomorphic in both populations. Filtering

these monomorphic loci from the allele frequency comparison did not appreciably change the shape or summary
of allele frequency statistics. Scattergrams of the minor
allele frequencies for both groups are shown in Fig. 1a.
Although most points lie along the 22.5° line in the
graph, there are some outliers. (They are expected to be on
the 22.5° line instead of the 45° line because the major
and minor alleles were determined based on the observed
data for the AJ.) The mean minor allele frequency for the
AJ was 0.21 (median 0.19). Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) for the minor allele frequency pairs between the
two populations was 0.91. Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, which is appropriate for non-Gaussian data,
yielded a similar value of 0.92.

and 6 (Fig. 1b), consisting of a total of 533 SNPs. These
chromosomes had local FST values as high as 0.51 (chromosome 2) and 0.34 (chromosome 6). Mean FST across
the genome was 0.009 with a median of 0.001 (Fig. 2).
While we consider this to be a small difference between
the populations, it was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
A permutation method was used to determine whether
the observed FST distribution differed significantly from
the null. By permuting the ethnic label but retaining the
SNP data, 100 datasets of pseudo-AJ and pseudo-CEU
were created. Calculation of FST statistics for the permuted
set was then performed 100 times, along with calculation
of mean, median, mode, variance, and 95% confidence
intervals. Although additional permutations beyond 100
datasets could considerably diminish the P-value estimate, this method resulted in the lowest possible P-value
(< 0.01), and thus rejection of the null hypothesis. By

Calculation of FIS was used to further quantify departures
of genotypic frequencies from panmixia. Mean FIS was 0.0124 for AJ and -0.0131 for CEU. These comparable
negative FIS values are consistent with evidence of similar
levels of outbreeding (isolate breaking) in both populations and also suggest that the above-mentioned homozygosity excess in CEU at α = 0.05 was not a distinguishing
characteristic, a point further supported by the similarity
of shape of the HWE violations in the two populations
(Fig. 3).

Compliance with HWE was evaluated separately for the AJ

had a majority with negative DA (51.6%), indicating
excess heterozygosity, while CEU had a majority with positive DA (57.4%), indicating excess homozygosity. Both

An analysis was performed using the CBS algorithm in
order to find clusters of markers out of HWE. The results
indicate that, although the overall number of markers not
in HWE was less than expected, there were small regions
with all, or nearly all markers out of HWE (Fig. 4). Also
notable is that there was very little overlap in the clusters
between AJ and CEU.

The LD metric r2 was calculated separately in AJ and CEU
individuals for all SNP pairs within a 500 kb radius of one
another. These tests were performed on subsets of 60 AJ
individuals to match the sample size of the CEU dataset;
had the full 101 AJ been compared to the 60 CEU, a spurious excess of LD would have resulted in the CEU [35].
Unless otherwise noted, the statistics that follow are averages across six such subsamples of AJ individuals. For bins
of separation between the SNPs (0–5 kb, 5–10 kb, etc.),
the mean r2 was calculated for each bin (Fig. 5). These data
revealed a pattern of LD decay as a function of distance,
with AJ displaying a slightly more rapid rate of LD decay
than CEU at short distances, but a slower rate of LD decay
at distances beyond 200 kb. Patterns of LD decay measured by mean D' appeared qualitatively similar to those
using r2.

Because metrics for LD could be calculated for the same
pairs of SNPs in the two population samples, the simplest
test comparing LD in AJ and CEU determined whether the
count of cases where r2(AJ) > r2 (CEU) vs. r2(AJ) <r2(CEU)
corresponded to a binomial trial with P = 0.5. In the first
test, the r2 values compared were all those within a radius
of 500 kb on chromosome 1. In this case, there were
1,067,034 SNP pairs where r2 (AJ) > r2 (CEU) and 997,694
SNP pairs for which r2 (AJ) <r2 (CEU), and the sign test
indicated that there was a significant excess of LD in AJ relative to CEU (P < 10-10). Restricting attention to only r2
values calculated between each SNP and its nearest neighbor (higher order LD imposes a non-independence across
LD values), a different pattern was observed. Here there
was significantly higher LD in CEU than AJ, where r2 (AJ)
> r2 (CEU) for 11,228 tests and r2 (AJ) <r2 (CEU) for
13,391 tests (P < 10-10). This pattern was consistent with
our analysis of LD decay, where CEU had higher levels of
LD for SNPs close to each other. However, there did
appear to be a trend toward higher r2 for AJ compared to
CEU when considering only SNP pairs separated by
greater than 200 kb, where r2 (AJ) <r2 (CEU) for 13,609
tests and r2 (AJ) > r2 (CEU) for 14,570 tests (P < 10-8).
These results can be explained in terms of the sampling
variance of LD caused by a founder event (see Discussion).
The same procedure was used for all SNPs within each 1
Mb window slid along chromosome 1 in order to identify

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/14

local regions with LD differences between the populations. The sign test plotted for each 1 Mb region of chromosome 1 for one representative sample of 60 AJ resulted
in the P-values shown in Fig. 6. Patterns of LD were quite
variable across the chromosome, with AJ having higher
LD at 73–74 Mb and CEU having higher LD at 187–188
Mb. Also examined was the number of 1 Mb bins on chromosome 1 where the sign test was significant (P < 0.05)
for an excess of LD in one population or the other. This
analysis was performed separately for each of the six subsamples of 60 AJ individuals. When considering all SNPs,
CEU had higher LD than AJ for the region 42–49 Mb, and
AJ had higher LD than CEU for 125–133 Mb. When considering pairs of SNPs and their closest neighbor, CEU
had higher LD than AJ for 38–52 Mb and AJ had greater
LD for 0–2 Mb. Finally, when considering pairs of SNPs at
least 200 kb apart, CEU had higher LD than AJ for 14–18
Mb while AJ had higher LD for 26–37 Mb windows. These
results appear to reflect the stochastic nature of sampling
that occurred at founding of the ancestral AJ population.
To assess the impact of selecting different samples of 60
AJ, the number of times that one population had significantly higher LD with one sample and the opposite population had significantly higher LD with a different
sample was examined. For all SNPs, the average number
of 1 Mb windows where this switch occurred was 8.2. For
neighboring SNPs, no windows switched and for SNPs
200 kb apart, an average of 0.267 windows switched.
To compare these data to those from a recent analysis of
LD structure on chromosome 22 [36], a sliding window
plot of average r2 and 1.7 Mb windows with a 1.6 Mb overlap was utilized, in contrast to the 1 Mb non-overlapping
windows used in this study. The pattern of average r2
peaks was similar to that noted in the previous study
(Additional File 7, Figure S6). The sign tests for chromosome 22 were qualitatively similar to those on chromosome 1. On chromosome 22, there were 194,639 SNP
pairs for which r2 (AJ) > r2 (CEU) and 179,166 SNP pairs
for which r2 (AJ) <r2 (CEU), and the sign test indicated
that there was a significant excess of LD in AJ relative to
CEU (P < 10-10). For independent pairs of neighboring
SNPs there was significantly higher LD in CEU than AJ,
where r2 (AJ) > r2 (CEU) for 1,951 tests and r2 (AJ) <r2
(CEU) for 2,188 tests (P < 0.00025). When considering
only independent SNP pairs separated by greater than 200
kb, there was a significant excess of LD in AJ relative to
CEU. There were 2,145 tests where r2 (AJ) <r2 (CEU) and
2,392 tests where r2 (AJ) > r2 (CEU) (P < 0.00026). Chromosome 22 also showed local regions where LD was significantly different between the AJ and CEU samples:
when considering all pairs of SNPs there were 21 to 26 1Mb windows where AJ had significantly higher LD than
CEU, and three to six 1-Mb windows where CEU had significantly higher LD than AJ.

As an additional metric to compare LD between the two
populations, we looked at the proportion of SNP pairs
with no evidence of recombination (D' = 1.0) at different
distance intervals between the SNPs, as previously
described Shifman et al. 2003 [37]. In this analysis, CEU
had more LD at closer (< 200 kb) distances between SNPs,

The HAP-derived haplotype block estimates gave 59,269
blocks for AJ and 54,457 blocks for CEU. Since this
method puts every SNP in a block, more blocks indicates
that each block is smaller. This is reflected in AJ blocks
having an average length of 36.8 kb (median 26.6 kb),
while CEU blocks had an average length of 40.6 kb
(median 28.9 kb). The distribution of block lengths is displayed in Fig. 7. Similarly, the number of tagged SNPs was
136,584 in AJ (average of 2.3 per block), and 128,205 in
CEU (average of 2.4 per block). HAP derived haplotype
blocks by chromosome are voluminous data available
upon request from the authors. Since there were 101 AJ
individuals and 60 CEU individuals, we examined haplotypes using only 60 AJ, but the results were similar to
those obtained using all the samples (data not shown).
Once the single SNP blocks were removed, the average
and median blocks were still smaller in AJ. The average
length was 38.0 kb in AJ compare to 42.1 kb in CEU and
the median was 27.7 kb in AJ compared to 30.3 kb in
CEU.

compared to CEU. The average block length for AJ was
26.5 kb (median 11.3 kb), which was less than the average

lengths in AJ were consistent with the HAP results.
Homozygosity mapping
The median number of homozygous tracts per individual
reaching the threshold score of 20 was 26 for AJ and 28 for
CEU. The median tract lengths were significantly different,
at 731 kb in AJ and 621 kb in CEU (P < 10-10). A significantly greater proportion of the AJ genome was contained
in homozygous tracts (median 0.87%; range 0.26% –
2.07%) compared to CEU (median 0.73%; range 0.39% –
3.98%) (P = 0.02) suggesting a greater level of autozygosity in AJ (Fig. 8). There was one clear outlier in the CEU
population, sample NA12874, which was also identified
in a previous study of homozygosity tracts as an outlier
[38].
Principal components analysis
In order to compare the two populations by reducing
dimensionality to two axes according to the Principal
Components Analysis (pca) implementation of Price et
al., [32] we first performed pca analysis on all 435,632
SNPs in the CEU and AJ overlapping sets as well as subset
of 167,676 SNPs with no detectable Hardy Weinberg
departures and no call rates below 1%. Both analyses
revealed discrete clustering of the populations, as shown
in Fig, 9, consistent with the FST findings. Some outliers
were evident among the AJ set, consistent with outbreed-

ing. Subsequent analyses were performed on the entire
SNP set in order to include a full representation as in
recent association studies [39], but re-analysis was also
performed on the subset of 87 cases left after removal of
14 subjects identified by pca analysis. For this subset there
were 28,053 SNPs with call rates below 95% and 9,395
with call rates below 90% in the unfiltered analysis of
435,632 SNPs, but in the filtered analysis of 167,676
SNPs all rates were >99.6%. For the LD decay analysis, this
recalculation showed that for SNPs <150–200 kb apart,
the CEU have more LD, while for SNPs >200 kb apart, the
AJ had slightly more LD. This was seen using both % of
SNP pairs where D' = 1 as well as average r2. The average
r2 values differ slightly from using subsets from the 101 AJ,
but the overall patterns remained the same. When the 14
PCA outliers were removed, we found that the mean FST,
representing the distance between the AJ and CEU
increased slightly, to 0.0099 from 0.0094. In addition, the
mean heterozygosity increased slightly when outlier AJ
were removed, from 0.26 to 0.28. However, the mean heterozygosity was not significantly different in either case
from the CEU, which was 0.27.

Discussion
A high density genomic scan was used to compare several
aspects of the structure of genetic variation in a genetic
isolate (AJ), and a representative population of northern
European ancestry (CEU). Prior studies of haploid regions
of the genome, including mitochondrial DNA and the
nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome, support
the hypothesis that AJ are genetically distinct, with little
recent admixture with host European populations [4043]. While the relative endogamy of AJ has been postulated based on historical documentation of population
bottlenecks and the isolation of AJ in Europe, initial analysis of LD structure in AJ compared to Europeans showed
modest increases in LD [36,37]. In those studies, comparisons between AJ and Europeans were made based on LD
in two 1 Mb regions per chromosome, typed with 16 SNPs
per region [37], or were restricted to a single chromosome
[36]. In contrast to these studies which utilized about one
SNP per 62.5 kb across the genome [37] or 2,589 SNPs at
a density of one marker per 13.8 kb on a single chromosome [36], in the current study, a high density analysis of
genetic variation in AJ was performed utilizing 435,632
SNPs at a mean density of one SNP per 2.5 kb (median
one SNP per 5.8 kb) across the entire genome. While our
study also found regions where AJ show greater LD than
CEU (e.g. the region analyzed by Service et al. [36]), LD
structure was highly variable with CEU showing greater
measure of LD on other chromosomes.
Our analysis reveals small but significant differences in
measures of genetic diversity between AJ and CEU. The
mean value of FST, a useful measure of overall genetic
divergence among subpopulations, was only 0.009, but
because of the large number of SNPs typed, this small
value is nevertheless highly unlikely to occur by chance (P
< 0.001). The biological interpretation of FST values as
high as 0.05 generally indicate negligible genetic differentiation [44,45], underscoring the power of dense SNP genotyping for detecting evidence of historical isolation
despite small genetic differences. The areas of greatest difference as assessed by FST were on chromosome 2 and
chromosome 6, presumably involving the HLA region on
chromosome 6 and the LCT locus on chromosome 2. The
differences in the HLA regions are also consistent with the
SNP-by-SNP comparisons. Distinct patterns of LD in the
HLA region have been observed in AJ [46] and selective
sweeps at LCT have been shown in European populations
[47]. Associations have been made between specific HLA
alleles and several disorders [48-50]. Very recently, a consortium group has derived an FST value comparing Northern Europeans to Ashkenazi Jews, also on the Affymetrix
500 K platform [51]. They report a value of 0.009, identical to that observed here. Together this study and the current study begin to create an Ashkenazi specific

"HapMap" and also begin to define subsets of markers
sufficient to distinguish these populations.
Because of the founder effect, inflated sampling variance
of haplotype frequencies in turn results in inflated variance in LD. For SNPs that are very close to one another, if
the parent population had high LD, the AJ could witness
lower LD due to this sampling. Most SNPs at somewhat
greater distances would have had nearly zero LD, and it is
the founding effect that produced the observed greater LD
observed in AJ at intermediate SNP distances. Because
haplotype blocks are generally inferred from the relatively
close, high-mutual LD set, this sampling variance could be
expected to erode the size of these blocks. When actual
measures of genome-wide LD structure in the two populations were compared, haplotype blocks inferred from
pair-wise LD statistics as well as by EM haplotype phase
inference did indeed tend to be smaller in AJ. Analysis of
global LD decay showed essentially no difference between
AJ and CEU, although there was a tendency for faster
decay of nearby SNPs and slower decay of intermediate
distance SNPs in the AJ. These data are more consistent
with the AJ as an older, larger population than CEU, and
would suggest that the LD structure of AJ may not provide
a global advantage for whole-genome association mapping. In contrast, however, the proportion of SNP pairs in
CEU showing no evidence of recombination (D' = 1)
among SNP pairs at different distance intervals was greater
in CEU than in AJ only at short distances, with the AJ generally showing more LD at longer distances. Similarly,
analysis of local LD, for example the analysis of LD decay
at chromosome 1, revealed a similar pattern, with AJ
showing slower decay (more LD) at longer distances. In
addition, a likelihood ratio approach showed that runs of
homozygous SNPs were approximately 25% longer in AJ
than CEU, which is more consistent with expectation in a
genetic isolate. These aggregate data suggest that CEU, like
AJ, underwent a population bottleneck, but given that the
overall diversity of AJ is not lower than that of CEU, the
greater homozygous tract lengths in AJ imply an average
shorter time back to common ancestry for the AJ sample.
The data presented here demonstrate that founder effect
advantages for AJ as applied to LD mapping will be
regionally variable. A recent analysis of LD structure utilizing 2,486 SNPs on chromosome 22 [36] revealed generally greater average r2 in AJ individuals, leading to the
conclusion that association analyses in groups like AJ
would require at least 30% fewer markers than studies in
outbred populations [36]. The analysis reported herein,
based on more than twice the SNP density, revealed a pattern of LD on chromosome 22 that is virtually identical to
that observed by Service et al[36]. However, analysis of
other loci (e.g., chromosome 1) as well as a global
genome analysis revealed significant variability in local

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/14

LD structure. Thus, in undertaking LD mapping for gene
discovery in AJ, regional variability lending a founder
effect advantage will occur in only some regions of the
genome.
To explore the basis of the differences in LD structure
noted here, it is important to consider possible sources of
ascertainment bias resulting from the selection of AJ subjects or those in the comparison CEU group. In this study
we utilized an American AJ cohort of women without a
history of breast cancer, while a prior study utilized an
Israeli AJ cohort [37]. Shifman et al. [37] found very high
similarity of allele frequencies (r2 = 0.96) comparing AJ
and Caucasian individuals. In contrast, an r2 of 0.83 was
observed in this study. This latter value did not change
using major allele frequencies, or if SNPs were filtered
based on HWE violations by Fisher's exact test or Spearman's Rho test. These findings suggest possible biases due
to population stratification, or alternatively, that the
genomic measures employed more accurately reflect true
allele frequency differences than in the prior study. Notably, the American AJ samples used here and the Israeli AJ
samples in the ascertainment of Shifman et al. [37] appear
to have similar proportions of SNP pairs showing no evidence of recombination (D' = 1) for pairs less than 5 kb
apart (81% in our U.S. samples versus 76% in the prior
series). This suggests a general comparability in the AJ
sample sets with regard to LD structure.
However, for the comparison group of "European" samples, there were striking differences; the proportions of
SNP pairs showing no evidence of recombination (D' =
1.0) for pairs less than 5 kb apart was 86% in our series
versus 63% in the prior series. All or part of the comparison ascertainment in the prior series' [36,37] samples was
from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository at Coriell, whereas we utilized the CEPH reference families
derived from Utah residents of European ancestry. It is
therefore possible that differences in our findings and
those of prior studies are a result of these differing ascertainments of those of European ancestry. Because of
polygyny and founder effects associated with the Utah
Mormon genealogies [52,53], this population may not
serve as a representative European comparison group.
However, gene frequency data, including red cell antigen
and HLA loci, were similar between CEU and northern
European cohorts in an early study [52]. Similarly, a more
recent study of LD structure showed nearly identical patterns, although only regions comprising 14.3 Mb of the
genome were compared [54].
The data presented here are consistent with a hypothesis
that the high level of similarity of patterns of LD between
AJ and CEU results from the same historical events that
shaped the extended LD in these two populations. The

finding of regions of slower LD decay (greater LD) in AJ
for distant SNPs is not readily explained, and suggests the
possibility of ancestral admixture. It is clear that regions of
LD around pathogenic mutations in AJ can be quite large,
extending up to 10 Mb, consistent with their more recent
origin. While the historical record is subject to interpretation, demographic considerations and analysis of coalescence times of founder mutations suggest at least three
periods of founding and expansion of AJ, one greater than
100 generations (20 centuries) ago, marking the founding
and expansion of the Jewish population in the Middle
East, one approximately 20 generations (five centuries)
ago [8,9], marking a constriction resulting from persecution and the Plague, and subsequent expansion of AJ in
central Europe, and, finally, a more recent event approximately 12 generations (three centuries) ago marking the
constriction of AJ in Europe as a result of renewed persecution, and subsequent re-expansion.
Not all founder mutations in AJ resulted from the most
recent bottlenecks; the I1307 K allele of APC, for example,
seen in both Sephardic as well as Ashkenazi Jews, dates to
the initial bottleneck from 100 generations ago [9,55].
Given these demographic and historical observations, it is
perhaps not surprising that the LD map of the Ashkenazim reveals features both of its ancient origins (a greater
number of smaller sized haplotype blocks) but also
greater endogamy (increased size of homozygous regions
identical by decent) compared to Europeans. It is also
likely that the local genomic differences observed between
AJ and CEU (regional differences in Fst and local differences in LD decay) reflect the impact of both selection as
well as genetic drift. Analysis of specific regions of local
difference by tests of evolutionary neutrality will be
needed to explore selective effects, which have recently
been documented in European, Chinese, and African populations [56]. The predominant impact of founder effects
in AJ, however, is evidenced by the documentation of
pathogenic mutations for more than 20 heritable diseases,
including heterozygous syndromes (e.g. hereditary breast
and ovarian cancer), where there is less precedent for
selective advantage than for carriers of recessive traits
[8,10].
Whether the genetic characteristics of AJ, revealed here to
be complex and showing local differences in LD structure,
will prove to be helpful in genomic association studies
remains to be determined. Based on computer modeling,
it has been demonstrated that if haplotypes were introduced by a small number of founders, LD will be greater
in isolated compared to outbred populations [57]. In the
case of extreme genetic isolates, extended LD was clearly
evident around even common alleles when compared
with neighboring populations [58]. While clearly advantageous for mapping rare alleles with population frequen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/14

cies less than the reciprocal of the effective number of
founding chromosomes, initial experience indicates that
gene mapping advantages may be limited in discovering
alleles associated with complex disease [4]. In that setting,
rare mutations may be present on an extended haplotype,
as a result of one or several original founding chromosomes carrying the particular mutation. More common
alleles may also enter small founder populations multiple
times resulting in lengths of shared haplotypes around
these alleles that are indistinguishable from the larger
ancestral population [57].
Despite these potential limitations of LD mapping in AJ,
SNP-based LD mapping successfully "rediscovered" BLM
and BRCA2 in proof-of-principle exercises using AJ
cohorts [11,12]. While genomic association studies in
large outbred populations are seeking to map loci for
common cancer susceptibility genes, it remains to be seen
if this same approach using AJ will benefit from local
increases in LD around candidate loci. Based on this preliminary LD map of AJ, the advantage of genome-wide
association studies in AJ compared to CEU are likely to be
modest and highly dependent on regional LD structure.

Conclusion
There were small but significant differences in measures of
genetic diversity between AJ and CEU. Analysis of
genome-wide LD structure revealed a greater number of
haplotype blocks which tended to be smaller in AJ. There
was essentially no difference in global LD decay between
AJ and CEU, although there was a tendency for faster
decay of nearby SNPs and slower decay of intermediate
distance SNPs in the AJ. These data are more consistent
with the AJ as an older, larger population than CEU, and
would suggest that, depending on regional differences in
LD structure, AJ populations may not always provide an
advantage for whole-genome association mapping.
