Abstract
Background: Transmembrane receptor kinases play critical roles in both animal and plant signaling pathways
regulating growth, development, differentiation, cell death, and pathogenic defense responses. In Arabidopsis
thaliana, there are at least 223 Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), representing one of the largest
protein families. Although functional roles for a handful of LRR-RLKs have been revealed, the functions of the
majority of members in this protein family have not been elucidated.
Results: As a resource for the in-depth analysis of this important protein family, the complementary DNA
sequences (cDNAs) of 194 LRR-RLKs were cloned into the GatewayR donor vector pDONR/ZeoR and analyzed by
DNA sequencing. Among them, 157 clones showed sequences identical to the predictions in the Arabidopsis
sequence resource, TAIR8. The other 37 cDNAs showed gene structures distinct from the predictions of TAIR8,
which was mainly caused by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Most of the genes have been further cloned into
GatewayR destination vectors with GFP or FLAG epitope tags and have been transformed into Arabidopsis for in
planta functional analysis. All clones from this study have been submitted to the Arabidopsis Biological Resource
Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University for full accessibility by the Arabidopsis research community.
Conclusions: Most of the Arabidopsis LRR-RLK genes have been isolated and the sequence analysis showed a
number of alternatively spliced variants. The generated resources, including cDNA entry clones, expression
constructs and transgenic plants, will facilitate further functional analysis of the members of this important gene
family.

Background
Multi-cellular organisms such as plants and animals use
cell surface receptors to sense and transduce chemical
signals for cell-to-cell communications. One of the most
important groups of cell surface receptors, the receptorlike protein kinases (RLKs), has unique structural features that make them particularly suitable for cell-to-cell
signaling. A typical RLK contains an extracellular receptor domain to perceive a specific signal, a single-pass
transmembrane domain to anchor the protein within
the membrane, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain to
transduce the signal downstream via autophosphorylation followed by further phosphorylation of specific substrates. Plant receptor kinases were originally named

“receptor-like” protein kinases since ligands for these
receptors were largely unknown at the time when the
first RLK was identified in maize [1]. Since then, a small
number of RLKs have been functionally characterized in
plants and a few specific ligands have been identified.
They play essential roles in plant growth, development,
pathogen resistance and cell death [2-8].
In the model plant Arabidopsis, both transmembrane
RLKs and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs,
which lack extracellular domains) belong to a large,
monophyletic gene superfamily of at least 610 members,
representing nearly 2.5% of the protein coding
sequences within the entire genome [9,10]. About two
thirds of genes in this superfamily encode proteins with
a typical N-terminal signal peptide and a hydrophobic
transmembrane domain, which are consistent structural
features of transmembrane RLKs. Based on their

structural and sequence similarities, the RLKs are
further grouped into more than 10 subfamilies. Leucinerich repeat (LRR)-RLKs represent the largest subfamily
in the Arabidopsis genome with at least 223 members
[10].
Despite the identification of a large number of LRRRLKs in Arabidopsis, biological functions have been
defined for only about 30 proteins (Additional file 1:
Table S1), which play crucial roles in a variety of different physiological processes. For instance, ERECTA (ER)
regulates organ shape and inflorescence architecture
[11]; CLAVATA1 (CLV1) determines the balance
between undifferentiated and differentiated shoot and
floral meristem cells [12]; BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR
KINASE 1 (BAK1) are a pair of RLKs involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling [13-15]; HAESA controls floral
organ abscission [16]; FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2)
contributes to plant defense/pathogen-recognition [17];
VASCULAR HIGHWAY 1 (VH1) influences leaf cell
patterning [18]; and EXCESS MICROSPOCYTES 1
(EMS1), SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR
KINASE 1 (SERK1) and SERK2 play important roles in
microsporogenesis and male sterility [19-21]. Other
LRR-RLKs of known function include RECEPTOR-LIKE
PROTEIN KINASE 1 (RPK1), involved in abscisic acid
early signaling [22,23]; TOAD2 and its redundant
homologue RPK1, both required in Arabidopsis embryonic pattern formation [24]; PXY, responsible for maintaining vascular tissue polarity [25]; and GASSHO1
(GSO1) and GASSHO2 (GSO2) which are essential for
the normal development of epidermal surface of Arabidopsis embryos [26]. Recently, two LRR-RLKs, BIR1 and
SOBIR1, were identified to regulate cell death and
innate immunity in Arabidopsis [27]. Interestingly, several RLKs were found to possess dual or multiple roles
during plant growth and development. For example,
ERECTA is involved in both plant development and
pathogen defense responses [28]. BAK1 and BAK1-LIKE
1 (BKK1) regulate BR-dependent cell growth, and play
an important role in cell-death control under various
biotic and abiotic stresses. When plants are attacked by
bacterial pathogens, BAK1 also can be recruited to the
FLS2 complex and regulates the innate immunity
response [29-32].
Reverse genetics has been used as a routine and effective approach to dissect the biological functions of
genes. Isolated complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences
are valuable resources in many processes in determining
the functions of their corresponding genes. For example,
the cDNA sequences can be used for ectopic expression,
complementary experiments for gene knock out lines,
site-directed mutagenesis, dominant negative analysis,
gene silencing and RNA interference, subcellular

localization of epitope-tagged fusion proteins, and protein-protein interaction analysis. Epitope-tagged fusion
proteins can also facilitate the proteomic studies of
interesting genes. For example, in vivo phosphorylation
sites of BRI1 and BAK1 were identified by immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged BRI1/BAK1 from Arabidopsis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and the functions of the
identified phosphorylation sites were determined in
planta [33,34].
In this paper, the full-length cDNA cloning of the
entire Arabidopsis LRR-RLK subfamily genes is reported.
A total of 194 cDNA sequences have been successfully
amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into a GatewayR donor
vector pDONR/ZeoR. Sequence analysis indicated that
157 cDNAs are identical to the predicted or earlier submitted cDNA sequences in The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR) database, whereas 37 other genes
showed altered cDNA sequences distinct from those
presented in the database, which is likely due to alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. One hundred eighty cDNA
sequences with 100% sequence accuracy were further
transferred, by in vitro DNA recombination, into two
different destination vectors with either FLAG or GFP
as the C-terminal fusion tags. Preliminary results indicated that most of the gene products can be detected by
Western hybridization analysis using anti-FLAG or antiGFP antibodies. The results and resources generated by
this study will be useful tools for future functional analyses of LRR-RLKs.

Results
Construction of GatewayR-compatible binary vectors for
plant transformation

To facilitate future functional analyses of all LRR-RLKs,
we generated 4 different Gateway R-compatible binary
vectors for high through-put cloning of LRR-RLKs (Figure 1A). The four vectors contain a GatewayR cassette
for DNA recombination with plasmid DNA of entry
clones to produce final expression constructs. GFP or
FLAG sequences were integrated at the 3’ terminus of
the Gateway R cassette for the production of epitopetagged fusion proteins that will facilitate subsequent
immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation
analyses.
The first vector, named pB35GWG, contains a BASTA
resistance gene for selecting transgenic plants and a Cterminal GFP tag. The second vector, designated
pK35GWG, uses a kanamycin resistance gene for selecting transgenic plants, also with a C-terminal GFP tag.
The third vector, termed pB35GWF, uses the BASTA
gene for transgenic selection and FLAG as the C-terminal fusion tag. The fourth vector, labeled pK35GWF,
contains a kanamycin resistance gene as the selectable

Figure 1 Gene transformation constructs generated in this study. Four GatewayR-compatible cloning vectors developed specifically in this
study. All the four vectors were derived from pBIB vectors [60] by inserting the GatewayR module and BASTA resistance gene. GatewayRmediated addition of GFP and FLAG epitope tags to the C-terminal ends of target sequences in vectors pB35GWG and pB35GWF. The attB sites
are from the recombination between attL and attR sites. The target LRR-RLK sequence without stop codon is inserted between the attB1 and
attB2 sites. To make the sequence in-frame with the epitope tags, one extra G is attached to the end of the C-terminus of the target sequence.
Amino acids are indicated with a single-letter code. Additional amino acids from attB sites and linking sequences in destination vectors are
added to the final protein.

marker and again has a C-terminal FLAG tag. All vectors use the CaMV 35 S promoter with dual enhancers
to drive expression of the gene of interest. Detailed
sequence information of the junction region of the
GatewayR cassette and the GFP or FLAG eptiope tags is
also shown (Figure 1B).
To examine whether the newly-constructed GatewayRcompatible vectors are reliable in generating LRR-RLK

overexpressed transgenic plants, a functionally characterized gene, BAK1, was used for the test. Previous studies have shown that BAK1 is involved in the BR signal
transduction pathway [14,15,34]. Overexpession of
BAK1 can suppress the dwarf phenotype of the bri1
weak allele, bri1-5, to wildtype [14,15,34]. To clone
BAK1 into the destination vectors, attB1 and attB2
flanked BAK1 was PCR-amplified and gel purified as

described in experimental procedures. After BP and LR
clonase reactions, BAK1 was transferred into the destination vectors and introduced into bri1-5 mutant plants.
Obtained transgenic plants showed a typical bri1-5 suppression phenotype (Figure 2A). Western hybridization
analysis using anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies also
indicated that both BAK1-FLAG and BAK1-GFP were
truly overexpressed in the transgenic plants (Figure 2B).
The results suggest that the generated destination vectors are fully functional and can be used for cloning and
overexpression of all LRR-RLKs in Arabidopsis plants
for future functional analyses.
GatewayR cloning of LRR-RLKs

A three-step protocol was used to efficiently produce
attB1- and attB2-flanked LRR-RLK ORF fragments
(Additional file 2A): (a) the reverse transcriptase reaction to generate single-stranded cDNA; (b) the first
round of PCR with gene-specific primers to amplify target ORF flanked with partial attB1 and attB2 adaptor
sequences; and (c) the second round of PCR with universal attB1 and attB2 adaptor primers to integrate

Figure 2 Functional examination of the generated
GatewayRdestination vectors. Full-length cDNA sequence of BAK1
was PCR amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 plants and introduced
into two destination vectors, pB35GWG and pB35GWF, by in vitro
DNA recombination mediated by BP clonase and LR clonase.
Expression constructs harboring BAK1 cDNA were transformed into
the bri1-5 mutant, a weak allele of bri1. Overexpression of BAK1
using the vectors can suppress the bri1-5 mutant phenotype,
indicating that the vectors are functional. Expression of BAK1 was
confirmed by Western hybridization in transgenic plants. Anti-FLAG
and anti-GFP antibodies were mixed to detect the signals on one
membrane.

complete attB1 and attB2 sites into the ORF amplicons.
Two hundred twenty three predicted LRR-RLKs distributed on all five chromosomes of the Arabidopsis genome
with ORF sizes ranging from 339 bp -3,759 bp are presented in TAIR8. The coding sequences of 221 LRRRLKs are larger than 1,500 bp. Superscript III was used
to produce long cDNAs with full-length ORFs and a
proof-reading polymerase (AccuPfx) was employed to
amplify the predicted ORFs with high fidelity. Two
rounds of PCR can produce enough DNA for GatewayR
cloning even for some genes with relatively low expression. PCR products were obtained for 208 of the 223
predicted LRR-RLKs genes, while 15 genes were never
amplified by RT-PCR (Additional file 2B). All PCR products were agarose gel purified and introduced into
pDONR/Zeo R to produce the entry clones. Plasmid
DNA from entry clones was then used for LR clonasemediated in vitro DNA recombination with appropriate
destination vectors to yield FLAG and GFP epitope
tagged constructs.
Sequence analysis of the isolated LRR-RLKs

A total of 194 cDNA sequences were successfully cloned
into the donor vector and are summarized in Table S2
in Additional file 1. Among them, 157 (80.9%) of the
clones contain cDNA sequences identical to those predicted in TAIR8 (Additional file 1: Table S3). The other
37 isolated sequences (19.1%) display gene structures
that are different from their corresponding predictions
in TAIR8 (Additional file 1: Table S4, S5). Based on
their structural differences, they can be divided into two
groups: (1) one complete ORF exists from the predicted
start codon to the predicted stop codon despite the coding sequences being different from that predicted (Figure 3); (2) no continuous ORF exists from the predicted
start codon to the predicted stop codon because of the
different coding sequences (Figure 4). The other 29
LRR-RLKs (Additional file 1: Table S6) were not isolated
successfully because of possible wrong annotation, specific and/or low expression, and bactericidal effect.
The first group includes 23 genes (Figure 3, Additional
file 1: Table S4). The detailed sequence differences are
summarized in Table S7 and the alignments among isolated cDNAs, predicted ORFs and the corresponding
genomic DNA sequences are shown in Additional file 3.
The isolated sequence of At1g31420 is 3 bp shorter
than the prediction. One clone [GenBank:AK226234]
with the same sequence as the prediction was found in
database, indicating that this gene has transcripts with
alternative splicing (Figure 3A). The isolated sequence
of At4g26540 is 6 bp longer than the prediction, and
both Cs at position 1,412 and 1,484 in the isolated
sequence are not found in the Arabidopsis genome (Figure 3B). The isolated sequence of At5g37450 displays
two unpredicted exons and shows one unpredicted

intron in predicted sequence (Figure 3C). An unpredicted exon is found in the isolated sequence of
At5g45840 (Figure 3D). Two predicted introns in gene
At3g56100 are eliminated in the isolated sequence and
have become a part of the first exon (Figure 3E). The
first predicted exons of At3g24660 and At4g20270 have
one unpredicted extra intron each (Figure 3F, G). The
predicted 5th exon of At5g14210 contains one extra
unpredicted intron, and the intron/exon boundary is
also different from that predicted (Figure 3H). Two predicted exons disappear and one unpredicted intron is
shown in the predicted 10th exon of At1g51890, and a
different intron/exon boundary is also observed (Figure
3I). The isolated sequence of At5g65240 is 30 bp shorter
than the prediction because of the different intron/exon
boundaries; and a RIKEN clone [GenBank:AY059844]
without a continuous ORF from the predicted start
codon to the predicted stop codon is available in the

database (Figure 3J). Isolated sequences of the other 13
genes, At1g05700, At1g07560, At1g14390, At1g34110,
At1g51880, At1g53430, At2g02780, At3g21340,
At4g20940, At4g29180, At5g35390, At5g59650 and
At5g59680, show different intron/exon boundaries compared with the predicted sequences, resulting in different mRNA sequences (Figure 3K-W).
The second group contains 14 genes (Figure 4, Additional file 1: Table S5). The detailed sequence differences are summarized in Table S8 in Additional file 1
and the alignments among isolated cDNAs, predicted
ORFs and the corresponding genomic DNA sequences
are shown in Additional file 4. Unlike the genes in the
first group, the isolated sequences in this group do not
display continuous ORFs from the predicted start codon
to the predicted stop codon that were used to design
the forward and reverse PCR primers for Gateway R
cloning. The isolated sequences of genes At1g06840,

Gou et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/19

At1g35710, At1g51860, At1g53440, At3g46370 and
At5g44700 exhibit different intron/exon boundaries
compared to the predicted ORF sequences (Figure 4AF). Different intron/exon boundaries are also found in
the isolated ORF sequences of At1g53420, At1g56120,
At5g07150, At1g29730 and At1g56140, with other structural differences (Figure 4G-K). The predicted 6th intron
disappears in the isolated ORF sequence of At1g53420
(Figure 4G). The predicted intron 17, exon 17 and exon
18 are merged into exon 18 and the predicted exon 16
is split into exon 16 and exon 17 in the isolated
sequence of At1g56120 (Figure 4H). The third predicted
exon does not exist in the experimentally derived
sequence of At5g07150, and the other six predicted
exons are merged into two exons (Figure 4I). The first
two exons and the first intron in the prediction of
At1g29730 merge into the first exon in the isolated
sequence (Figure 4J). The predicted exon 17 is split into
exon 17 and exon 18 in the isolated sequence of
At1g56140. In database, a previously isolated sequence
[GenBank:BT011697] is different from both the prediction of At1g56140 in TAIR8 and the sequence from this
report, losing the sequence from exon 6 to exon 23 and
part of exon 24, resulting in a much smaller protein
with 184 aa compared to the predicted protein of 1,032
aa (Figure 4K). Two predicted introns in At2g28970 do
not exist in the isolated sequence (Figure 4L).
At1g56130 displays an unpredicted intron (Figure 4M).
One extra unpredicted intron is shown in At4g29990,
and the isolated sequence is different from both the
existing sequence [GenBank:X97774] and the TAIR prediction (Figure 4N).
Although the isolated sequences of genes At4g31250
and At5g01950 are the same as the current predictions
in TAIR8, the previously reported coding sequences of
them are different (Figure 5A, 5B). The predicted exon
1 of At4g31250 is split into exon 1 and exon 2 in
sequence AK176245 [GenBank:AK176245] (Figure 5A).
Gene At5g01950 has a new annotation in TAIR8. The
isolated sequence contains the same ORF as the current
prediction, but the first two predicted exons in TAIR5
are arranged as three exons. The existing sequence
AK229912 [GenBank: AK229912] shows a different
intron/exon boundary between exon 7 and intron 7,
resulting in a smaller ORF of 631 amino acids (Figure
5B).
Detection of alternative splicing of LRR-RLKs

Potentially alternatively spliced variants of 38 LRR-RLKs
were examined by RT-PCR with variant-specific primers
according to the predicted mRNA sequences and previous reports (Figure 6). Isolated cDNA sequences from
this study were not examined because they were identified by RT-PCR during the cloning procedure. Isolated
cDNA of At4g26540 in this report showed a structure

Figure 5 Two LRR-RLKs producing alternatively spliced
transcripts. At4g31250, the isolated sequence in this report is the
same as the TAIR8 prediction with an ORF of 675 aa. A previously
reported sequence, AK176245, shows an unpredicted intron,
producing a shorter protein of 588 aa with delayed start codon and
early stop codon. The GenBank accession number for the isolated
sequence is FJ708761. At5g01950, the first two exons in TAIR5
prediction are shown as three exons in both experimental
sequences. AK229912 displays a different intron/exon boundary with
a shorter exon 7, resulting in a shorter protein of 631 aa. The
GenBank accession number for the isolated sequence is FJ708768.

with slight difference from the prediction in database,
which made it difficult to examine the sequence difference with variant-specific primers. This gene was not
included in the RT-PCR experiment. From inflorescence, 34 variants of 33 LRR-RLKs were confirmed by
RT-PCR with expected size of products (Figure 6). No
RT-PCR products were obtained from At1g34110,
At1g51880, At3g21340, At3g56100 and At4g31250. The
previously reported cDNA sequence [GenBank:
BT011697] of At1g56140 was not amplified from this
study, but the predicted variant sequence [GenBank:
NM_104492] of it was confirmed by RT-PCR. Both the
previously reported cDNA sequence [GenBank:
AY059844] and the predicted mRNA sequence [GenBank: NM_125922] of At5g65240 were confirmed in
this study. From leaf, RT-PCR fragments of 35 variants
of 34 LRR-RLKs were obtained (Figure 6). No RT-PCR
products with expected sizes were obtained for the same
genes as in inflorescence except At1g51880 that produced a larger fragment than predicted. No RT-PCR
product of previously reported cDNA [GenBank:
AK176245] of At4g31250 was recovered. Together, a
total of 34 LRR-RLKs were confirmed with alternative
splicing of pre-mRNA, including four previously
reported cDNA variants of At1g31420 [GenBank:
AK226234], At4g29990 [GenBank: X97774], At5g01950
[GenBank: AK229912] and At5g65240 [GenBank:
AY059844].
LRR-RLKs phylogenetic analysis

Sequence analyses of isolated LRR-RLKs reported in this
paper demonstrate that some of them encode protein

sequences distinct from the predictions. This sequence
variation and the improved annotation of Arabidopsis
genome makes it necessary to examine the previously
created phylogenies of this superfamily. The previous
report suggested 15 subfamilies because the sequences
clearly fell into distinct clades [10]. Studies in this report
based on the alignment of the full-length amino acid
sequences result in a similar phylogenetic tree to the
previous report [10] with minor adjustments (Additional
file 5). (1) At1g74360, a member of the previously
assigned subfamily LRR X, fell into the LRR VII subfamily; (2) two members (At1g35710 and At4g08850) of the
previously assigned subfamily LRR XII, one previously
ungrouped gene (At2g25790), and one member
(At5g51350) of the subfamily LRR XIV fell into the LRR
XI subfamily.
Epitope-tagged proteins of LRR-RLKs in transgenic
Arabidopsis plants

The expression of LRR-RLKs cloned in the destination
vectors pB35GWF and pK35GWG and transformed into
Arabidopsis ecotype ‘Columbia-0 (Col-0)’ was verified
by Western hybridization analysis with aFLAG and
aGFP antibodies respectively (Figure 7A, B). Immunoprecipitated membrane protein was prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE for the detection of FLAG-tagged
fusion proteins while total protein could be used directly
to detect signals of GFP-tagged fusion proteins. The
FLAG- or GFP-tagged LRR-RLKs could be detected in

Discussion
Experimentally derived sequences help to verify and
expand the predicted genome annotation

The TAIR annotation release TAIR8 (April, 2008) contains 33,282 genes, including 27,235 putative protein
coding genes. Among all the putative protein coding
genes, 2,289 genes have not been experimentally supported by identified transcripts. Among the 223 predicted LRR-RLK genes, 30 of them have no EST
support. EST support for 12 of them is now provided
(Additional file 1: Table S9). A total of 94 LRR-RLK
genes have no isolated full length coding sequence in
the existing database. From this study, 70 new LRR-RLK
cDNAs with full length coding sequence were provided
(Additional file 1: Table S10). The resources generated
in this study will provide useful tools for future functional analyses of this important protein family. At the
same time, phylogenetic analysis can guide researchers
to create double, even higher level, mutants to overcome
functional redundancy of genes in one subfamily. For
example, elegant genetics studies in subfamily LRR II
revealed redundant functions of SERK genes in brassinosteroid signal transduction [14,15,30,35], male sporogenesis [21,35], pathogen response [29,31,35] and cell
death [30,32]. Phylogenetic analysis in this study indicated that several subfamilies, such as LRR XII whose
members fell into two different subfamilies based on the
phylogeny of full length amino acid sequence, could be
rearranged to aim future functional analysis of their
gene members.
The sequence data generated from this project will
also greatly improve genome annotation [36]. In a previous study, 5,000 full-length gene transcripts from Arabidopsis were used to re-annotate its genome. The
results indicated that the gene structures of approximately 35% of the examined genes could be improved
according to the isolated full-length cDNA sequences
[37]. When examing existing EST and full-length cDNA
sequences for all of the predicted LRR-RLKs, one fulllength cDNA, clone RAFL25-47-F19 [GenBank:
AK221400], was identified that covered two predicted
loci, At1g51830 and At1g51840, with a full and complete ORF of 886 aa. The loci should be merged into
one according to this data. As described above, from
this study a total of 37 genes were identified with different variant transcripts compared to the predictions
(Additional file 1: Tables S7, S8). All the data are useful
for the improvement of Arabidopsis LRR-RLK
annotation.

Gene functions and alternatively spliced transcripts

The TAIR8 release showed that 4,330 of the annotated
27,235 protein coding genes (15.9%) have alternatively
spliced transcripts. In this report, sequence analyses
show that a total of 37 LRR-RLK genes have different
sequences from the TAIR8 predictions. This includes
two possibilities: (1) the prediction was not correct; (2)
both the predicted and the isolated sequences exist in
plant, which suggests some LRR-RLK genes have alternatively spliced transcripts, possibly in the same tissue,
or in different tissues, or under different growth
conditions.
The sequence analysis of isolated LRR-RLKs in this
report revealed different forms of the CDS compared to
TAIR8 predictions or the existing sequences in the database, including alternative intron donor and/or acceptor
sites (for example, At1g05700, At4g20940, At5g44700),
unpredicted introns (At3g24660, At4g20270, At1g56130,
At4g29990), unpredicted exons (At5g45840), unspliced
introns (At3g56100, At2g28970) and different combinations of the aforementioned changes. They form a continuous ORF or several discontinuous ORFs. The
presence of the observed alternative splicing was further
confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 6). It is already known
that alternative splicing can significantly increase the
complexity of the transcriptome and proteome by
synthesizing multiple transcripts and proteins from one
gene. Several previous reports showed that approximately 20% of Arabidopsis genes are alternatively
spliced and some alternatively spliced transcripts have
different functions [38-42]. Serine/arginine-rich (SR)
proteins form a conserved family of splicing regulators
in eukaryotes. The pre-mRNAs of Arabidopsis SR genes
are extensively alternatively spliced, and about 95 transcripts are produced from 15 genes. The transcriptome
complexity of SR genes is increased by six-fold. Abiotic
stresses regulate the alternative splicing of the premRNAs of SR genes to produce different isoforms of SR
proteins that are likely to have altered functions in premRNA splicing [41]. Six mRNA variants were generated
by alternative splicing in the pre-mRNA of a homologue
of SR protein, atSR45a. The transcript abundance and
the splicing patterns of atSR45a were altered under various types of stress [42]. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) 70K protein (U1-70K)
interacts with splicing factors and is involved in basic
and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA [43-47]. In Arabidopsis, two distinct transcripts are produced by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA of the U1 snRNA 70K
gene. Only the short transcript encodes a full-length
functional U1-70K, whereas the long transcript codes
for a truncated U1-70K [48]. COP1 is a negative regulator of Arabidopsis light-dependent development. COP1b
is generated by alternative splicing, resulting in a 60-

Gou et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/19

amino acid deletion in the WD-40 repeat domain relative to the full-length COP1, which functions as a dominant negative regulator of COP1 function [38]. The
maize MIK gene codes for a GCK-like MAP4K that can
be activated by interaction with maize atypical receptor
kinase (MARK) [49]. Four different mature mRNAs of
MIK are generated by alternative splicing, and the
resulting polypeptides display different kinase activity
and are differentially activated by interaction with the
MARK receptor [50]. Recent studies further demonstrated that alternative splicing affected regions frequently code for intrinsically disordered regions of the
corresponding protein products and the association of
alternative splicing and intrinsic disorder results in various isoforms to increase the functional and regulatory
diversity of the gene [51-54].
LRR-RLKs are critical proteins involved in many
aspects of plant growth, development and stress
responses. It is noticed that six genes (At1g05700,
At1g07560, At1g51880, At4g29180, At5g37450 and
At5g44700) produce RT-PCR fragments with different
sizes in inflorescence and leaf (Figure 6), which indicates
that different forms of LRR-RLK protein may be
required for distinct tissue development and function.
Some of the alternatively spliced transcripts of LRRRLKs will generate truncated versions of the predicted
proteins. The truncated proteins may be involved in the
functional regulation of these genes in different developmental stages and different growth conditions/stresses.
Future functional analyses of the alternatively spliced
LRR-RLKs, revealed from this study, would eventually
elucidate the biological meaning of the process.
Gene function and phosphorylation sites analysis

Clones reported in this paper are not only a resource for
gene annotation, but also will be very useful for gene
function analysis. Genes in entry clones can be transferred freely to any GatewayR -compatible destination
vectors and introduced into Arabidopsis. They can be
used for overexpression in Arabidopsis to dissect the
resulting phenotypes that will indicate the possible
related pathways and functions of the target genes. They
can be used to generate different epitope-tagged fusion
proteins. For example, as described above, GFP- and
FLAG-tagged fusion protein can be produced in transgenic plants with different antibiotic resistances. The
subcellular localizations of the interesting genes can be
determined with the help of confocal microscopy. The
homodimerization or heterodimerization between LRRRLKs can be detected and confirmed by coexpression in
planta and coimmunoprecipitation analysis. The transgenic plants can also be used to isolate protein complexes for each LRR-RLKs, which can help to dissect the
complicated signaling pathways that the genes participate in. The cloned genes could be mutated directly by

Page 10 of 15

site-directed mutagenesis in entry clones to create
kinase-inactive copies. Overexpression of kinase-inactive
genes in Arabidopsis will be useful to dissect the functions of the genes by dominant negative effects, especially in the case that functional redundancy is a
problem during analysis of them.
In order to clearly understand LRR-RLK function, it is
necessary to characterize cytoplasmic kinase domain
phosphorylation and examine the role of receptor oligomerization in initiating signaling pathways. The primary
goal of this study was to generate resources for our current Arabidopsis 2010 project that is focused on mapping LRR-RLK phosphorylation sites, assessing the
functions of the identified sites in plant growth and
development, and examining the in vivo interactions of
numerous LRR-RLKs. A prototype for this approach has
been developed for the BRI1 and BAK1, two LRR-RLKs
involved in BR signaling. For example, immunoprecipitated BRI1-FLAG protein was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
and multiple in vivo phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues of BRI1 were identified. T-1049 and S-1044 are
highly conserved activation loop residues that were
shown to be essential for kinase function in vitro and
BRI1 signaling in planta [33]. The interaction of BRI1
and BAK1 was studied in detail both in vitro and in
vivo, and a novel mechanism of sequential transphosphorylation was developed, which helps explain the
role of the BAK1 co-receptor in regulating BR signaling
through BRI1 [34]. This approach, utilizing the
resources developed here, is being expanded to examine
the mechanisms of action of numerous LRR-RLKs
across this important family of regulatory proteins.

Conclusions
This study generated four GatewayR-compatible destination vectors for plant transformation and they were
proved functional by overexpressing BAK1 to suppress
bri1-5 mutant plant phenotype. Complementary DNA
sequences of 194 Arabidopsis LRR-RLKs were cloned
into the GatewayR donor vector pDONR/ZeoR and analyzed by DNA sequencing. A total of 37 isolated LRRRLKs showed distinct sequences from the database prediction or previously reported sequences. Alternative
RNA splicing was observed in some of them, which was
thought involved in the regulation of gene functions and
plant development. Experimental evidences for the
annotation of these LRR-RLKs were provided in is study.
The generated cDNA clones, expression constructs and
transgenic plants are useful resources for scientific communities and will accelerate the research in this field.

Methods
Primer design and reverse transcriptase PCR reaction for
LRR-RLK cloning

Coding sequences of all the predicted LRR-RLK genes
[10] were retrieved from the database (TAIR5 release).
Primer pairs for all the genes were designed according
to the predicted ORF sequences. The forward primer
contained partial attB1 sequence (5’-AAAAAGCAGGCT-3’), the start codon and 18-28 gene-specific
nucleotides thereafter to yield a sequence with a T m
value higher than 55°C. The reverse primer contained
partial attB2 sequence (5’-AGAAAGCTGGGT-3’) and
18-28 nucleotides of 3’ gene specific sequence without
the stop codon. To make the cloned sequence in frame
with FLAG and GFP sequences in the vectors, one extra
C was added before the gene specific sequence in the
reverse primer.
Total RNA was extracted from whole plants, inflorescences and roots of Arabidopsis using RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Messenger RNA
(mRNA) was isolated from the total RNA by Oligotex
mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Either total RNA or mRNA
was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 40 μl volume. Two rounds of PCR reactions were performed to generate attB-flanked PCR
products. The first round of PCR with gene specific primers was processed with the following program: 95°C
for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, 68°C
for 4 min; 72°C for 10 min. After the first round of PCR
reaction was completed, the second round of PCR was
performed using attB1 and attB2 adaptors as universal
primers containing attB1 and attB2 recombinational
cloning sites (attB1 adaptor: 5’-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3’; attB2 adaptor: 5’GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3’) to
incorporate complete attB1 and attB2 sequences into
the final PCR products.
Gel purification and in vitro DNA cloning

PCR products of all LRR-RLKs were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE buffer. DNA products were purified from the DNA containing gel slices
using GENECLEAN® Turbo kit (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA)
and PureLink™ Gel Extraction Kit (Invitrogen). Purified
PCR products were eluted into 50 μl ddH2O. GatewayR
BP clonase-directed in vitro DNA cloning (Invitrogen)
was performed between purified DNA and plasmid
DNA of the GatewayR donor vector pDONR/ZeoR in a
5 μl volume at room temperature for approximately 16
h. The BP clonase reactions were transformed into E.
coli DH5a competent cells and incubated overnight at
37°C for selecting positive entry clones on Luria Bertani
(LB) agar plates containing 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen).

Page 11 of 15

Positive entry clones were picked for further analysis by
colony PCR with M13 forward (5’- TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3’) and M13 reverse (5’- CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3’) primers. Entry clones with
positive PCR signal and correct molecular size were
inoculated into 2.5 ml LB broth containing 50 μg/ml
zeocin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Plasmid DNA
of entry clones were isolated and analyzed by restriction
enzymatic digestion. Clones with appropriate insert sizes
were selected for further analyses by DNA sequencing.
After sequence verification, plasmid DNA of each
entry clone was recombined into the destination vectors
pB35GWF, pB35GWG, pK35GWF and pK35GWG (see
below) with the help of LR clonase (Invitrogen). The LR
reactions were transformed into E.coli DH5a competent
cells and incubated overnight at 37°C for selecting positive expression clones on LB agar plates containing 50
μg/ml kanamycin. The recombinants were inoculated
into 2.5 ml LB broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin
and incubated overnight at 37°C. Plasmid DNA of each
expression clone was isolated and further analyzed by
restriction enzymatic digestion.
DNA sequence analysis

All coding sequences in entry clones were sent to HighThroughput Sequencing Solutions (The University of
Washington, http://www.htseq.org) for sequence analysis
with M13 forward primer, M13 reverse primer and gene
specific primers. Sequences from the same clone were
manually assembled into contigs with the help of Seqtools http://www.seqtools.dk/. Sequences from contigs
were compared by BlastN to the Arabidopsis AGI CDS
dataset to examine the sequence identity and whether
the sequences were from mRNA of target genes. The
sequences of contigs were also compared to the AGI
whole genome dataset by BlastN. The sequences of
assembled contigs, the corresponding CDS sequences
and genomic sequences were aligned and analyzed by
Spidy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Ostell/
Spidey and GeneDoc http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/
index.html to identify introns and exons in target genes
and view the detailed sequence differences.
Determination of LRR-RLK variants with reverse
transcriptase PCR

Total RNA of inflorescence (including flowers and siliques) and leaf was prepared from four week old Arabidopsis Col-0 plants grown in soil with RNeasy plant
mini kit (Qiagen). On column DNase I digestion of the
total RNA was performed during the RNA purification
process according to the manufacture’s instruction to
eliminate the genomic DNA contamination. Ten micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed to cDNA
with PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) in a 40 μl volume according to the manufacture’s instruction. Same amount of cDNA equivalent

Gou et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/19

to 100 ng total RNA was used to perform the primary
PCR reactions for 38 LRR-RLKs that show potential
alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. The nested PCR reactions were conducted to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the investigation of alternative splicing with
variant-specific primers. The variant-specific primers
were carefully designed, for example, flanking the alternatively spliced sequence if available, to further eliminate the possible genomic DNA contamination. The
cDNA sequences generated from this study were not
examined by RT-PCR. The used primers were listed in
Table S11 in Additional file 1.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Full-length cDNA sequences of six previously reported
LRR-RLKs (At1g51830 [GenBank:AK221400], At1g75640
[GenBank:AK226809], At3g24240 [GenBank:AJ550163],
At4g29990 [GenBank:X97774], At4g39270 [GenBank:
AY099851], At5g67200 [GenBank:BT003370]) were
retrieved from GenBank. The predicted mRNA
sequences of 37 LRR-RLKs without experimentally produced complete coding sequences were retrieved from
TAIR. The mRNA sequences of all the other 180 genes
were from this study. The corresponding protein
sequences were then imported into MEGA 4 [55] for
multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW [56] and phylogenetic analysis by using the Neighbor-joining [57]
and bootstrap [58] methods. The weighing matrix used
for ClustalW alignment was BLOSUM with the penalty
of gap opening 10 and gap extension 0.2. The bootstrap
consensus tree was inferred from 1,000 replicates.
Construction of GatewayR-compatible binary vectors

The mannopine synthase (mas) promoter (Pmas) and
the coding region of glufosinate resistance (BAR) gene
were PCR-amplified from pSKI015 [59] and the resulting PCR products were purified and cloned into HindIII/BamHI digested pBlueScriptSK(+) (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA). Synonymous mutations were introduced into
the BAR sequence by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate all regularly used restriction sites including EcoRI,
XhoI, SacI, and KpnI, resulting in pBlueScriptSK
(+)-BAR. All site-directed mutagenesis reactions were
carried out with PfuUltra™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). After treatment with 10 units of DpnI
for 1 h at 37°C, 2 μl PCR products were transformed
into E.coli DH5a competent cells for selecting positive
colonies on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. PCR products of positive colonies were digested
with EcoRI, XhoI, SacI and KpnI to select those with
mutations. After sequence verification, the plasmid
DNA of pBlueScriptSK(+)-BAR was used as template to
amplify the Pmas and BAR region flanked with HindIII
and BglII sites. PCR products were digested by HindIII
and BglII, and cloned into HindIII/BamHI digested
pBIB-HYG-35S [60]. The resulting vector was named

Page 12 of 15

pBIB-BASTA-35S and the BamHI restriction site in this
vector was eliminated after BamHI/BglII ligation. The
T-DNA region of the vector was sequenced, and the
resistance of transgenic plants to herbicide was confirmed by spraying with Finale (AgrEvo, Montvale, NJ).
GatewayR-FLAG fragments and GatewayR-GFP fragments were amplified from pEarleyGate 302 and pEarleyGate 103 [61] respectively by AccuPrime™ Pfx DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen). The digested and purified fragments were cloned into the KpnI/SacI sites of pBIBKAN-35S [60] and pBIB-BASTA-35S to produce GatewayR-compatible binary vectors pK35GWF, pK35GWG,
pB35GWF and pB35GWG. The T-DNA regions of the
binary vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Plant materials, growth conditions, transformation and
selection

Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were grown at 22°C in a longday condition (16 h of light and 8 h of dark) in the
greenhouse. The floral dip method [62] was used to
transform wild-type Arabidopsis and bri1-5 mutant
plants [63]. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101
containing each target construct was grown at 30°C for
30 h to the stationary phase. Cells were then harvested
by centrifugation and resuspended in two volumes of
water with 5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.03% (v/v) Silwet L-77
(Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX). Healthy and vigorously
growing inflorescences of Arabidopsis were immersed in
the above A. tumefaciens suspension for 30 sec for gene
transformation. After treatment, plants were kept in
covered flats for 1 day. All the seeds subjected to
screening were treated at 4°C for 3 d before being sown
on soil or agar plates. Seeds from plants dipped with
constructs containing the glufosinate resistance (BAR)
gene were sown directly on soil and sprayed with
1.5:1,000 (v/v) commercially available Finale (AgrEvo) in
water to screen for transgenic plants with herbicide
resistance. Seeds from plants dipped with constructs
containing neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII)
were grown on ½ Murashige and Skoog medium (MS)
plates [64] with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 0.6% (w/v) agar
and 1% (w/v) sucrose to obtain transgenic plants with
kanamycin resistance. After about 10 days on agar
plates, the selected kanamycin resistant individuals were
transplanted to soil.
Western hybridization analyses

Transgenic plants harboring GFP fusion proteins were
harvested after 3 weeks of growth in soil. Total proteins
from leaves were prepared for Western hybridization.
Membrane proteins were extracted from 11 d seedlings
grown in shaking liquid culture and subjected to immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged fusion proteins as previously described [14,33]. Protein samples were
separated on 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel. Western

were performed as previously described [14,33].
