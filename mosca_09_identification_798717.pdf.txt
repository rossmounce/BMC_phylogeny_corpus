Abstract
Background: The identification of the organisation and dynamics of molecular pathways is crucial
for the understanding of cell function. In order to reconstruct the molecular pathways in which a
gene of interest is involved in regulating a cell, it is important to identify the set of genes to which it
interacts with to determine cell function. In this context, the mining and the integration of a large
amount of publicly available data, regarding the transcriptome and the proteome states of a cell, are
a useful resource to complement biological research.
Results: We describe an approach for the identification of genes that interact with each other to
regulate cell function. The strategy relies on the analysis of gene expression profile similarity,
considering large datasets of expression data. During the similarity evaluation, the methodology
determines the most significant subset of samples in which the evaluated genes are highly
correlated. Hence, the strategy enables the exclusion of samples that are not relevant for each gene
pair analysed. This feature is important when considering a large set of samples characterised by
heterogeneous experimental conditions where different pools of biological processes can be active
across the samples. The putative partners of the studied gene are then further characterised,
analysing the distribution of the Gene Ontology terms and integrating the protein-protein
interaction (PPI) data. The strategy was applied for the analysis of the functional relationships of a
gene of known function, Pyruvate Kinase, and for the prediction of functional partners of the
human transcription factor TBX3. In both cases the analysis was done on a dataset composed by
breast primary tumour expression data derived from the literature. Integration and analysis of PPI
data confirmed the prediction of the methodology, since the genes identified to be functionally
related were associated to proteins close in the PPI network. Two genes among the predicted
putative partners of TBX3 (GLI3 and GATA3) were confirmed by in vivo binding assays

(crosslinking immunoprecipitation, X-ChIP) in which the putative DNA enhancer sequence sites of
GATA3 and GLI3 were found to be bound by the Tbx3 protein.
Conclusion: The presented strategy is demonstrated to be an effective approach to identify
genes that establish functional relationships. The methodology identifies and characterises genes
with a similar expression profile, through data mining and integrating data from publicly available
resources, to contribute to a better understanding of gene regulation and cell function. The
prediction of the TBX3 target genes GLI3 and GATA3 was experimentally confirmed.

Background
The identity of each cell in a multicellular organism is
determined by the unique gene-expression patterns of
that cell type and is specified by a complex system
characterised by intricate molecular circuits. Within these
networks, regulatory elements control and modulate
RNA and protein expression levels. The application of
the Systems Biology approach holds great promise for
the identification of the structure and dynamics of
cellular pathways [1], thus facilitating the understanding
of the complexity associated with cellular functions.
However, only a small part of these pathways has been
characterised in such a way to enable them to be useful
for mathematical modelling and predicting in vivo
dynamics.
In recent years, the wide use of various high-throughput
technologies has generated a large amount of data
regarding the transcriptome and the proteome states of
cells. Part of these data is stored in publicly available
databases, such as: the Gene Expression Omnibus [2],
ArrayExpress [3] and The Stanford Microarray Database
(SMD) [4] that collect microarray experiments data; the
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) [5] and the
BioGRID [6] that store protein-protein interaction (PPI)
data. Data collected in such resources can be integrated
allowing the collection of different types of information
that can be useful for strategies that aim to understand
regulatory unit interactions and cellular pathways
dynamics.
The comparison of gene expression profiles can be used
to predict whether a number of genes are functionally
related. The hypothesis is that if two genes have a similar
expression profile across many biological samples then
they may be functionally related. Indeed, expression
profile similarity in a large number of experimental
conditions is an empirical evidence that the considered
genes could establish some relations to determine cell
functioning. The relationship can be the involvement in
the same biological process or the physical interaction
between proteins. Hence, the analysis of the RNA
expression levels supported by the integration of PPI
data helps the reconstruction of cellular pathways.

The co-expression analysis approach was recently
applied to many human microarray datasets, revealing
functionally coherent groups of genes [7] and was used
to create a database of co-expressed gene networks in
mammals [8]. The measure of the similarity among pairs
of expression profiles was based on the correlation, that
permits the identification of a profile of similar shape
regardless of the expression level. However, the application of co-expression analysis on datasets including
samples generated with heterogeneous experimental
conditions may cause some issues. In this context, it is
important to adopt a strategy that considers subsets of
samples. Indeed, some of the collected samples may be
not relevant for the pair of genes analysed because the
genes may not be active in some sample types. Moreover,
two genes may be positively correlated in some conditions while negatively correlated in others.
In this work, we present a strategy based on data mining
and data integration to identify genes functionally
related to each other through a biological pathway or a
physical interaction. The calculation of the similarity of
gene expression values over a number of samples is
coupled within an optimisation system that identifies
the subsets of samples where the correlation between the
expression profiles is the highest. The pipeline integrates
data from the Gene Ontology (GO) project [9] and PPI
databases in order to characterise the putative partners of
the gene of interest and the type of relationship that they
establish. We report the results of two applications of the
presented methodology: one, for validation purposes,
concerns Pyruvate Kinase (PK), while the other is related
to the prediction of the putative partners of the gene TBox 3 (TBX3), a transcription factor with the T-box DNA
binding domain that is involved in the regulation of
developmental processes.

Results and discussion
Coupling data mining and data integration for the
identification of functionally related genes
The methodology, represented in Figure 1, takes as input
a genes-by-samples expression matrix X, where the
element xi, j is a measure of the gene i expression in
the sample type j.

Figure 1
Illustration of the pipeline. The methodology takes as input an expression matrix. The optimisation process calculates the
strength of the correlation for each gene with a chosen gene and identifies the samples where the correlation is optimal.
Subsequently, genes are ranked and a number of genes are selected. Then, the selected genes are characterised analysing the
GO terms enrichment and the properties of the PPI network established by the proteins they produce.

The first part of the procedure calculates the extent of the
correlation between the expression profiles of the studied
gene and all the other genes in X. The calculation of a gene
pair correlation is coupled within the optimisation
process. This procedure is based on a genetic algorithm
that, for each gene pair, partitions the samples into three
disjoint sets such that the set C+ contains the samples in
which the correlation between the genes is positive, Ccontains the samples in which the correlation is negative

and C0 contains the samples in which there is no
correlation. The first and the second sets can be empty
but at least one of them must have a size larger than a
predefined threshold (under which the number of
samples is considered too small to support a significant
correlation analysis); the third group has a predefined
limited size that represents the maximum number of
samples that can be considered not relevant. Subsequently, genes are ranked according to the correlation

values that they exhibit with respect to the gene of interest.
The strategy implements different ranking possibilities.
Indeed, it is possible (i) to focus the attention on the
genes showing the highest positive or negative correlation,
(ii) to produce a unified list or (iii) to consider the genes
that show a dual behaviour, that is the genes that are
positively correlated with the gene of interest in some
samples and negatively correlated in other samples. The
decision on how to do the ranking is left to the user since
it is related to the specific case study.
Once the ranking is done a number of top ranked genes
are selected as input for the subsequent part of the
analysis. Regarding this selection, the set of genes within
the first percentile constitutes a reasonable choice since
its elements encode for proteins that are close to each
other in the PPI network (this evidence is discussed later
in the text).
The analysis follows with the integration of the GO
terms and PPI data. GO terms are used to provide a list
of potential components, functions and processes that
are significantly enriched in the selected genes. This task
is accomplished comparing the distribution of the GO
terms among the selected genes with a reference
distribution. In particular, the system searches for overand under-represented terms. Due to this calculation, it
is possible to obtain an initial idea of the biological role
of the studied gene.
PPI data are integrated from HPRD and BioGRID. The
strategy builds the network by establishing the products
of the selected genes along with their first neighbourhood in the PPI network (the first neighbourhood of a
node in a graph is the set of nodes that are directly
connected with it). The system calculates the all-pairs
shortest paths length between the proteins included in
the considered network and their clustering coefficients.
The shortest path between two nodes of a graph is the
shortest way to walk from a node to the other following
the connections between nodes; the length of the
shortest path is the number of edges included in it.
The clustering coefficient is a measure of the neighbourhood density of the considered node [10]. The information gained from the analysis of the shortest paths and
clustering coefficients is used following the evidence that
the shorter the distance between two proteins in the PPI
network, the higher the probability that they have a
similar function [9]. By the integration and analysis of
PPI data the system determines, first of all, the subset of
the functional relationships among the selected genes
that are constituted by physical interactions between the
encoded proteins. Moreover, it provides a list of modules
of interacting proteins encoded in a format that can be
used as input for software like Cytoscape [11] that allows

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S12/S8

network visualisation and analysis. These modules
contain proteins that are close in the PPI network,
participate in the same biological processes and in some
cases could represent protein complexes.
Breast cancer case study: breast primary tumour
expression data from SMD
A dataset composed by breast cancer expression data was
assembled using data available in the literature. Indeed, we
were interested in gaining some insight into the potential
functional partners of the Tbx3 protein in breast cancer or
breast pathologies. In humans, mutations in TBX3 result in
the Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome (UMS), an autosomal
dominant disease that is characterised by mammary
gland hypoplasia and other congenital anomalies, suggesting that TBX3 is required for normal breast development
[12]. In addition, TBX3 was found over-expressed in breast
cancer tissues and cell lines [13,14]. Therefore, since the
level of expression of TBX3 is lower in non-cancer breast
epithelial cells with respect to breast malignant cells, in
order to identify genes co-regulated with TBX3 in breast
cancer, we used expression data generated from breast
primary tumour samples. The dataset was downloaded
from SMD and includes 413 samples (Additional File 1)
annotated in the database as breast primary tumours. Data
were retrieved as preprocessed log2 fold changes, representing expression variations with respect to the reference
conditions used in the experiments in which samples were
collected. In order to validate both the methodology and
the considered dataset, the pipeline was applied to a gene
of known function, PK. The protein encoded by this gene
catalyses the transphosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate producing pyruvate and ATP and it constitutes the last
step of the glycolytic pathway.
Genes within the top percentiles of the ranked
lists are enriched in proteins that are near to
each other in the PPI network
In order to empirically choose a subset of the ranked
gene list produced after the optimisation process, we
analysed the distribution of the PPI among the proteins
encoded by the ranked genes. Following the evidence
that proteins that are near to each other in the PPI
network have a similar function [15] we expect that if the
genes within the top percentiles of the list are composed
by proteins functionally related we would find that the
proteins that they encode are separated by a short
distance in the PPI network. Recently, it has been shown
that the average distance of protein pairs in the human
PPI network is 4.85 [16]. Therefore, we considered a pair
of proteins (A, B) to be near if d(A, B) ≤ 3 where d is
the distance between (A, B) in the PPI network. We
calculated the proportion of the protein pairs with
d ≤ 3 with respect to all the possible pairs in a chosen

percentile. In both the applications of the presented
strategy, we found that the portion of protein pairs that
are near to each other in the PPI network is the highest in
the first percentile and decreases considering the genes
included in the subsequent percentiles, Figure 2.
This result has a dual implication. First, it constitutes a
validation for the presented methodology, and in
particular for the optimisation process that evaluates
the expression similarity. Indeed, its ranked output
reproduces the evidence that functional similarity should
correspond to closeness in the PPI network. Second, the
analysis of the trend of the portion of protein pairs that
are close in the PPI network with respect to the
percentiles of the ranked list enables one to choose a
cutoff for the selection of the genes for subsequent
analyses.
In both the cases of PK and TBX3, the genes included in
the first percentile were selected as the final gene list,
since they exhibited the highest portion of proximal
protein pairs.

Pyruvate Kinase functionally related genes
The output of the optimisation process (Additional File 2)
was ranked considering both positive and negative
correlation coefficients. The analysis of the GO term

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S12/S8

enrichment among the selected genes revealed that they
are involved in metabolic processes, cell cycle and response
to DNA damage (Table 1). The presence of genes that
participate in metabolic processes is expected since PK has
a key role in metabolism. Moreover, it seems reasonable to
find genes involved in cell cycle, considering that the
dataset concerns breast cancer and proliferating tumour
cells where expression of PK is crucial [17]. Indeed, since
highly proliferating cells require energy, glycolysis is a
major pathway involved in energy production.
Response to DNA damage is a process that is tightly
coupled with cell cycle. Due to the unique nature of how
some tumour cells grow in acute cycling and hypoxic
conditions and that tumour cells have elevated rates of
glucose uptake but reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation, the unique cellular metabolism found in cancer
cells may be correlated in part with the function of genes
involved in DNA damage response, for instance, BRCA1
which may have a role in regulating genetic instability in
hypoxic cells [18]. In order to test for a potential
biological role of genes positively and negatively
correlated to PK, the GO terms enrichment was
evaluated separately in the two subsets (data not
shown). The analysis revealed that the positively
correlated genes are mainly involved in metabolism,
cell cycle and DNA repair. This reflects the direct
functional relationship among the processes listed
above under tumour conditions. Conversely, we found
that the top ranked genes negatively correlated with PK
are enriched in GO terms related to “response to
stimulus” and “immune system processes”. It is well
established that there is a relationship between cancer
cells and the immune system for regulating tumour
dormancy, tumour survival and tumour progression
[19]. Hence, the evidence of a relationship of negative
correlation between PK and genes involved in immune
system processes can be the consequence of the necessity
to inhibit the immune system to allow cell growth.

However, it is important to consider that the RNA used to
generate the expression data in the analysed dataset was
usually not derived from microdissected breast tumour
cells. This implies that the RNA of different cell types can
be present in the samples used for analysis and, since these
cells have not been excluded, it is possible that the reported
functional relationships include genes that are specific of
immune system cell types.
The integration and the analysis of the PPI established by
the proteins encoded by the selected genes revealed a
number of modules of interacting proteins. One of these
(Figure 3A), includes proteins with a role in DNA
replication and repair. All these proteins are encoded
by genes that were reported to be positively correlated
with PK.
Globally, the results described above constitute another
validation of the methodology that is successfully able to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S12/S8

identify a subset of genes that share some functional
relationships with the gene of interest under analysis.

Prediction and experimental validation of TBX3
functional partners
The output of the optimisation process (Additional
File 3) was ranked considering both positive and
negative correlation coefficients. The GO terms distribution was studied to search overrepresented terms among
the selected genes. The terms with the most significant
p-values are associated with processes, functions and
components that are consistent with some predicted
biological roles of TBX3 (Table 2). The 20 top ranked
genes (Table 3) are involved in transcription regulation
with a particular role in developmental processes (such

as GATA3, GLI3 and PBX1), in signal transduction (such
as RGL2) and in regulation of apoptosis (CFLAR and
BCL2). It seems reasonable that TBX3 could regulate a
network of transcription factors, generating the amplification of its signal by activation or repression of a
cascade of other genes involved in the control of DNA
transcription. Another class of possible TBX3 targets is
the group of genes involved in cell signalling and cell
communication, like membrane proteins, G-coupled
membrane receptor or signal transduction proteins, as
PRRT2 or RGL2, and transport proteins, as SH3BP4. In
this class of genes, for instance, we reported a gene that
encodes for a calcium dependent membrane protein,
FSTL5, involved in the process of cellular adhesion. It is
not surprising that TBX3 could control genes of the cell
cycle or apoptosis, which are processes in the tumour
development.
Also in the case of TBX3, the genes found negatively
correlated are enriched with GO terms related to
immune system processes. The interpretation of this
correlation might be similar to that observed for PK in
that the samples used for the analysed data set may not
be derived from microdissected cells but may consist of
several different cell types.
The integration and the analysis of PPI data revealed a
number of modules of interacting proteins. One of these
(Figure 3B) includes proteins that have a role in immune
system processes.

Sequence based prediction and experimental validation
of TBX3 transcription regulated targets
Since TBX3 is a transcription factor, it is expected that a
subset of highly correlated genes identified with the
presented approach, could be TBX3 gene targets or
protein co-factors. Indeed, since correlation does not
imply causation, TBX3 highly correlated genes are not
necessarily TBX3 direct targets.

In order to find the TBX3 regulated targets, an independent
computational analysis was carried out to identify the TBX3
Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) on the genome.
The analysis was done using ReXSpecies [20], a tool that
analyses sequences using data from multiple species.
We found that 2 genes within the top ten ranked genes
after the optimisation process have the TBX3 TFBS
upstream to their gene transcription start site. They are
GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), the top ranked gene,
and GLI-Kruppel family member 3 (GLI3), Table 3.
These two genes have not been previously described to
be targets of TBX3 (the only Tbx3 reported target genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S12/S8

are p14ARF [21] and the serum response factor, SRF
[22]). The two putative TBX3 targets where validated
using formaldehyde-mediated DNA-protein crosslinking
[23]. DNA-protein interactions can be probed in vivo
using an approach whereby DNA-bound proteins are
first cross-linked to the DNA by treatment with
formaldehyde that results in instantaneous formation
of cross-linked networks, preventing transient redistribution of the cellular components. The formaldehydecrosslinked chromatin is sonicated to introduce random
and limited breakage. Then the DNA-bound protein
region of the chromosome can be enriched for by
immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The
protein bound DNA regions can then be amplified and
thereby validated with the use of specific primers
designed to encompass the putative TBX3 protein
binding site. This type of analysis can be used to identify
putative TBX3 protein interaction regulatory regions and
enhancer sequences on chromatin that modulate cell
function [23]. This assay was performed using two
different cell lines, the LA7 cell line [24-26] and a well
known human breast cancer cell line, BT474. Primer
pairs were selected to amplify beta-actin which was used
as a negative control for both cell lines (Figure 4A and
Figure 4B, upper left and right panels), and GATA3
(Figure 4A, middle panel) or GLI-Kruppel family
member (GLI3) (Figure 4A and Figure 4B, lower left
and right panels) regions containing the potential
binding sites for TBX3 protein. As Figure 4 shows, we
performed PCR amplification on total genomic DNA as a
positive control of the PCR products (lane 1); in the PCR
on pre-immune (PI) sera, no band was amplified as
expected by the fact that chromatin should not be
precipitated by the PI sera (lane 2). PCR on the

Conclusion
The presented methodology identifies functionally
related genes analysing a large dataset of microarray
experiments and integrating data from literature. During
the evaluation of a pair of expression profiles the system
identifies the sample subsets where the correlation is the
highest. This feature is important especially when the
datasets consist of a large number of samples collected in
different experimental conditions, since the pool of
active biological processes depends on these conditions
and hence not all the samples can be useful for the
expression similarity calculation.
A dataset containing primary breast cancer expression data
was assembled from the literature and used to search
genes functionally related to a gene of known function,
PK, and for the prediction of TBX3 functional partners. In
both cases the methodology found a number of genes that
share functional relationships with the gene under
analysis. The integration of PPI data provided a validation
of the results, confirming that genes ranked within the top
percentiles encode proteins that are close in the PPI
network, an evidence of functional relationship. Moreover, the analysis of PPI data enabled the identification of
interacting protein modules among the putative partners
of the gene of interest. In order to prove the prediction of
the methodology concerning the TBX3 gene, we used a
combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, a
technique that is used to validate in vivo DNA-binding
protein locations on chromatin DNA. The cell-typespecific transcription program is controlled by the
availability of a set of transcription factors and the
accessibility of their target sites in the chromatin. Targetsite accessibility is modulated by multiple factors, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. By this
technique we validated two main TBX3 target genes, GLI3
and GATA3. GATA3 is one member of a transcription
factor family that plays an essential role in the specification of and maintenance of differentiated cell types, in
particular in mammary gland differentiation (for review
see [27,28]) and in breast cancer has emerged as a strong
predictor in tumour differentiation [29,30]. It is not thus
surprising that the transcription factor Tbx3 [14], being
involved in tumour progression, could control the GATA3
transcription factor. It has already been reported a clear
role for GLI3 transcription factors in the normal mouse
mammary gland development [31] and GLI3 may have a
particular role in the breast cancer metastasis to bone
in vivo [32] as GL3 is involved in mediating epithelialstromal tissue interaction [31].

In conclusion, the presented strategy is demonstrated to be
a useful tool to mine large datasets available in the
literature in order to identify functional and physical
relationships established by the gene of interest and to
characterise its biological role starting from the study of the
available information related to its predicted partners.

Methods
Expression matrix preprocessing
The expression matrix preprocessing done by the
methodology presented here handles the issue of the
potential presence of multiple expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) that represent the same gene. The pipelines
supports different strategies for this task. The decision
of which one to apply depends on two kinds of
considerations which result in contrast outcomes: one
related to molecular biology and the other related to
computational time. Indeed, the possibility to include in
the analysis the whole set of ESTs related to a gene has
been taken into account for alternative splicing but, on
the other hand, this solution is the most expensive in
terms of computational cost. In the opposite case, in
which only one EST is selected to represent the
associated gene, the computational cost is the lowest,
but the potential different behaviour of the splicing
variants is lost.

Both in the cases of PK and TBX3, the EST with the
higher number of available expression values across the
samples was selected to represent the associated gene.
For all the other genes the EST with the highest number
of expression values available in the same samples with
respect to the gene under analysis (PK or TBX3) was
selected to represent the related gene.
The optimisation process
Similarity between a pair of expression profiles is
assessed using the Pearson’s r. In order to enable the
comparison between Pearson’s coefficients calculated on
a different number of pairs of expression values we use
r ′ = r N − 2 since the statistical significance of the
Pearson’s r is proportional to the sample size N, that is
the bigger the sample size the smaller the correlation
expected by chance.

The optimisation process is handled using a Genetic
Algorithm (GA). An individual is defined as a string s
over the search space S Œ {+, -, 0}m that represents the
possible assignments of every sample 1, 2,..., m to one of
the sample sets C+, C-, C0 defined above. The fitness
function is defined such that it has its maximum value
when the samples partition determines the highest
positive correlation in the set C+, the highest negative
correlation in C- and no correlation in C0. Hence, the

aim of the optimisation process is the maximisation of
the fitness function that we defined as a map from the
normalised correlation coefficients associated at each set
to the interval [0, 1] Œ ℜ:

that have, by definition, the global maximum equal to
a = m C i /m, and where b = m C i − 2 . The results
concerning the case studies of PK and TBX3 were obtained
running the GA with a population of 500 individuals for
5000 generations.
GO terms enrichment and PPI analyses
The systems identifies the GO terms that are under/overrepresented in a given list of significant genes respect to a
reference gene set. The probability that the observed
distribution is obtained by chance is calculated using the
appropriate cumulative hypergeometric distribution.

PPI data are integrated from HPRD and BioGRID. Given
a list of proteins in input the system builds a graph that
represents the PPI in which the considered proteins are
involved. In particular, the nodes of the graph include
the proteins given in input along with their interacting
partners (their first neighbourhood); the edges are all the
connections available in the databases listed above
among the considered nodes. The all-pairs shortest
paths are calculated using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
Software
The pipeline relies on a series of Perl scripts, C programs,
and MySQL databases. Considering the main tasks, data
preprocessing and GO enrichment analysis rely on Perl
scripts; the optimisation process and the all-pairs shortest-paths problem are solved with C programs; local
MySQL databases were created to integrate data from the
GO project, HPRD and BioGRID. The programs composing the pipeline are available upon request.

Prediction of TBX3 TFBSs
TFBSs were predicted using a tool that searches genomic
regions from multiple species [20]. TFBSs may be
located upstream or downstream of known genes, or
be part of their UTRs (untranslated regions). Typically
the tools use TFBS models represented by Hidden
Markov Models (HMM, used by Mapper [33]), Position
Specific Weight Matrices (PWM, used by Genomatix
[34]), or IUPAC consensus sequences (Genomatix) to
predict TFBSs in a DNA sequence, or source of models
such as Jaspar [35] and Transfac [36]; Genomatix uses a
database of TFBS developed in-house. The DNA motif
that was used is designed to match usually short
sequences (about 8–20 base pairs). The ReXSpecies
tool is designed to remove false positive matches.
ReXSpecies is an evolutionary approach for TFBS
prediction by phylogenetic footprinting, and is based
on the idea that the sequences coding a regulatory
element should be preserved across different species. The
phylogenetic footprinting method tries to discover TFBS
in a set of orthologous regulatory regions from multiple
species, by identifying the best conserved motifs in those
orthologous regions.
TFBSs in genomic data sequence data. Experimental
confirmation of TBX3 interacting partners
Validation of putative TBX3 targets was performed by
formaldehyde-mediated DNA-protein cross-linking [23].
DNA-protein interactions were probed using primers
designed to span the region where the putative Tbx3 binding
sites were found by genomic sequence analysis. The
following primers amplifying the same genes in both
rat and human sequences were used: FW
5’-TTCTCACTGGTTCTCTCTTCTGCC-3’ and RW 5’TTGGGATGGGGAGTCTGTTCAG-3’ amplifying a fragment
of 310 bp from the beta Actin gene of rat (Gene ID N. 81822)
and human (Gene ID N. 60); amplifying a fragmentof 300 bp
from Gli3 gene of rat (Gene ID 140588) FW 5’-TTTTGGGAGTAGGGGCAACTG-3’ and RW 5’-TCTCCGTTCACACCTTTTGCTATC-3’ amplifying a fragment of 289 bp,
and human (Gene ID 2737) FW 5’-CAGTTAGAGAGAAGGGACGGACAG-3’ and RW 5’-CAGGGTGTAAAAAAGGCATCC-3’ and amplifying a fragment of 431 bp; FW 5’CTGGGTGAGCCACCATCA-3’ and RW 5’-AGAGATCCGTGCAGCAGAG-3’ amplifying a fragment of 255 bp from GATA
3 gene of rat (Gene ID 85471).
