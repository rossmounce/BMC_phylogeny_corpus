Abstract
Background: Recent genomic studies have revealed a teleost-specific third-round whole genome
duplication (3R-WGD) event occurred in a common ancestor of teleost fishes. However, it is unclear how
the genes duplicated in this event were lost or persisted during the diversification of teleosts, and
therefore, how many of the duplicated genes contribute to the genetic differences among teleosts. This
subject is also important for understanding the process of vertebrate evolution through WGD events. We
applied a comparative evolutionary approach to this question by focusing on the genes involved in longterm potentiation, taste and olfactory transduction, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, based on the whole
genome sequences of four teleosts; zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and green spotted puffer fish.
Results: We applied a state-of-the-art method of maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference and
conserved synteny analyses to each of 130 genes involved in the above biological systems of human. These
analyses identified 116 orthologous gene groups between teleosts and tetrapods, and 45 pairs of 3RWGD-derived duplicate genes among them. This suggests that more than half [(45×2)/(116+45)] = 56.5%)
of the loci, probably more than ten thousand genes, present in a common ancestor of the four teleosts
were still duplicated after the 3R-WGD. The estimated temporal pattern of gene loss suggested that, after
the 3R-WGD, many (71/116) of the duplicated genes were rapidly lost during the initial 75 million years
(MY), whereas on average more than half (27.3/45) of the duplicated genes remaining in the ancestor of
the four teleosts (45/116) have persisted for about 275 MY. The 3R-WGD-derived duplicates that have
persisted for a long evolutionary periods of time had significantly larger number of interacting partners and
longer length of protein coding sequence, implying that they tend to be more multifunctional than the
singletons after the 3R-WGD.
Conclusion: We have shown firstly the temporal pattern of gene loss process after 3R-WGD on the basis
of teleost phylogeny and divergence time frameworks. The 3R-WGD-derived duplicates have not
undergone constant exponential decay, suggesting that selection favoured the long-term persistence of a
subset of duplicates that tend to be multi-functional. On the basis of these results obtained from the
analysis of 116 orthologous gene groups, we propose that more than ten thousand of 3R-WGD-derived
duplicates have experienced lineage-specific evolution, that is, the differential sub-/neo-functionalization or
secondary loss between lineages, and contributed to teleost diversity.

Background
Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is believed to be one
of several major evolutionary events that shaped the
genomes of eukaryotes from yeasts and plants to vertebrates [1-6]. WGD, which generates dozens of thousands
of duplicate genes, is usually followed by massive gene
loss or the acquisition of new roles for the duplicated
genes (i.e., sub-/neo-functionalization [7,8]). The evolution of these duplicate genes should occur independently
among the lineages that diverged after the WGD. Such an
event may contribute to the emergence of genomic differences among lineages that have experienced a WGD, and,
therefore increase the genetic and phenotypic diversity
among the organisms in that group.
Jawed vertebrates, which have the most complex body
plan and behavioral characteristics, are thought to have
experienced two rounds of (1R- and 2R-) WGD events
early in their evolution, and teleost fishes experienced one
more WGD (3R-WGD [6,9-12]). This notion is supported
by data from several recent genomic analyses [4,13-21].
Since these events (1R-, 2R-, and 3R-WGD) occurred in
ancestors shared by major phylogenetic groups such as
tetrapods and teleosts, they may have been important for
the formation of vertebrate-specific genomic features.
The teleost-specific 3R-WGD may be crucial to understanding certain aspects of teleost diversity; in addition,
the event is very interesting given its time of occurrence.
The 1R- and 2R-WGDs, which contributed to the formation of jawed-vertebrate genomes, including those of
mammals, occurred before the split between tetrapods
and teleosts; thus, they are very old events [5,14,15,17].
Probably because of their oldness, the 1R- and 2R-WGDs
seem to have left few traces in the duplicated genes or tree
topology of the gene families within the current genomes
[4,22,23]. On the other hand, the 3R-WGD is estimated to
have occurred in an ancestor of teleosts but after the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods [24-26]. Thus, it is the relatively recent WGD shared by a large vertebrate group, i.e.,
teleosts. Therefore, we can expect that teleost genomes
contain many more WGD-derived duplicate genes and
their 'traces' of evolution than tetrapod genomes. In addition, in teleosts, whole-genome sequence data from multiple
species
[16,20,27],
reliable
phylogenetic
frameworks, and estimated divergence times between lineages [28-33] are now available. Thus, we can systematically analyze the evolution of WGD-derived duplicate
genes and their lineage-specific actions by focusing on teleosts, which experienced 3R-WGD. This will provide valuable insights into the evolution of vertebrates through
WGDs.
Previous studies have analyzed WGD-derived duplicate
genes mainly by pairwise comparisons using the genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/127

of phylogenetically distant species such as human and
pufferfishes [15-17,19,20]. Studies focusing on a particular gene family have also been performed (e.g., [34,35]).
Studies on the medaka and green spotted puffer fish
(Tetraodon) genomes suggested that they contain about
2,000 pairs of duplicate genes derived from the 3R-WGD
[20]. The analyses based on pairwise comparison, however, are insufficient to address the detailed evolutionary
process, e.g., the temporal- and lineage-specific manner of
gene loss/persistence, after the WGD. These concerns are
still not fully resolved by studies based on whole genome
data from a few teleost species [36,37], and they can be
resolved only by ancestral-state inferences by using multiple genome data, and phylogenetic frameworks and divergence time estimations. Thus, it is unknown how
duplicated genes have been maintained or lost temporarily through lineage diversification after the WGD and how
many of them contribute to the current genomes of each
species.
To address these concerns, we estimated the evolutionary
processes experienced by the duplicated genes after the
3R-WGD by analyzing the whole-genome data of four teleosts (zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and Tetraodon)
based on teleost phylogeny and their divergence time estimates. In our comparative analyses, we focused on signal
transduction pathways involved in learning, memory, and
sensory perception, which may have played crucial roles
in vertebrate evolution, as well as energy metabolism,
which is common to eukaryotes. As representatives of
each pathway, we selected four molecular interaction networks: long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission
(LTP), taste transduction (TT), olfactory transduction
(OT), and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). First, we sought
duplicate genes derived from the 3R-WGD by intensive
phylogenetic and conserved synteny analyses of the genes
involved in the above networks. Next, we estimated the
temporal pattern of duplicate gene loss/persistence after
the 3R-WGD on the basis of teleost phylogeny and their
divergence time framework [28,30,31,33]. The 3R-WGDderived duplicates that have persisted over the course of
evolution were analyzed in terms of their function, locations in the network topologies, numbers of interacting
partners, and total length of coding sequences.

Results
Orthologous gene groups between tetrapods and teleosts
In this study, protein-coding genes involved in LTP, TT,
OT, and TCA were analyzed to search for duplicate genes
derived from the 3R-WGD, and their subsequent loss or
retention was inferred. According to the KEGG pathway
database [38], LTP, TT, OT, and TCA (the network
schemes are based on knowledge in the human) comprise
67, 24, 32, and 27 human loci, respectively (olfactory
receptor [OR] and taste receptor type 2 [T2R] genes were

excluded; see Methods). Among these genes, three, eight,
and five were repeatedly involved in LTP and TT; LTP and
OT; and LTP, TT, and OT, respectively. After removing
these overlaps, 130 human genes [see Additional file 1:
Table S1] were subjected to a comparative genomic analysis with other animal genomes.

Putative orthologs of these 130 human genes in Tetraodon,
stickleback, medaka, zebrafish, chicken, clawed frog,
ascidian, and fruit fly were obtained through BLASTN
searches against their genomes using human protein-coding sequences as queries (for details, see Methods). The
obtained genes were subjected to a series of phylogenetic
analyses, including preliminary and secondary neighborjoining (NJ) analyses and final maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis. Based on the ML trees [see Additional file
2: Fig. S1–S63], the genes were classified into four categories (Figure 1; for details, see Methods). As a result, 119 of
the 130 human genes were found to have orthologs in teleost genomes [see Additional file 2: Fig. S1–S63], while no
clear orthologs were identified for the remaining 11 genes
(PPP3CB; PPP3R2; CALM1, 2, 3, and 6; PRKCG;
GUCA1C; and CLCA1, 2, and 4) [see Additional file 2: Fig.
S14, S15, S16, S25, S45, and S47]. Among the 119 human
genes, 3 were duplicated specifically in human [see Additional file 2: Fig. S7 and S53B]. Accordingly, we identified
a total of 116 orthologous gene groups between tetrapods
and teleosts, corresponding to the 130 human genes
examined (Table 1).
Persistence of the duplicated genes after the 3R-WGD
Systematic analysis of the gene phylogenies described
above successfully identified the duplicated genes derived
from the 3R-WGD. These identifications were ascertained
based on previously published information related to
doubly conserved synteny in the medaka genome [20]
shown in [Additional file 2: Fig. S1–S63] and the genometo-genome conserved synteny information presented in
[Additional file 2: Fig. S64–S68]. Duplicated genes
derived from the 3R-WGD were identified in at least one
species in 45 of the 116 orthologous gene groups (Table
2). This indicates that the genome of the common ancestor of the four teleosts (zebrafish, medaka, stickleback,
and Tetraodon) contained at least 161 (116+45) loci
belonging to the 116 orthologous gene groups, meaning
that 56.5% [(45×2)/161] of the loci in the ancestor were
duplicate genes derived from the 3R-WGD.

one gene for PPP1CA in its LTP network, whereas the
other fishes possess both members of the 3R-WGDderived pair. Based on the lineage-specific presence or
absence of the duplicates, we counted the number of 3RWGD-derived genes and the total number of loci in the
four teleost genomes (Table 3). The average of these numbers across the four teleosts shows that, among 133 loci
still present on average in a teleost genome, average 55
(55/133 = 41.4%) remain duplicated from the 3R-WGD
in at least one teleost genome (not in all four teleost
genomes).
A few genes were found to have expanded dramatically by
repeated duplication independent of WGD. For example,

in the OT system, phosphodiesterase 1C (PDE1C) genes
were duplicated specifically in the stickleback genome
[see Additional file 2: Fig. S44], implying the existence of
multiple bypass circuits that regulate the cyclic AMP
(cAMP) pathway in the stickleback OT system. Other
examples include the calmodulin (CaM or CALM) genes
involved in LTP and OT. The CaM gene family included
diverse members before the split of tetrapods and teleosts,
and the differential members have persisted in the tetrapod and teleost genomes, respectively [see Additional file
2: Fig. S16]. Interestingly, the amino acid sequences of
CALM1 and 2 in tetrapods and their closest CALMs in teleosts are identical in their alignable region.
Temporal loss or persistence of the duplicated genes after
the 3R-WGD
Based on our data concerning the presence or absence of
3R-WGD-derived duplicate loci (Figure 2), we estimated
the number of gene loss events on the basis of the teleost
phylogeny using parsimony (for details, see Methods).
The inferred gene loss events were then assigned to the
phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to the
estimated divergence time derived from a molecular clock
analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences [33] (Figure
3A).

The obtained temporal pattern of gene loss (Figure 3B)
indicates that many (71/116 genes; see Table 2) of the
duplicated genes were rapidly lost following the 3R-WGD

before the split of zebrafish (node c), whereas on average
more than half (27.3/45 genes; see Table 3 "Grand total":
54.5/2 = 27.3) of the duplicated genes remaining in the
ancestor of the four teleosts (45/116 genes) have persisted
for about 275 million years (MY). Least-squares fitting of
a neutral model of the loss of gene function to the data
points for the 3R-WGD and the common ancestor yielded
an exponential decay curve with a slope of -0.0123 (Figure
3B gray line). On the other hand, approximation to all
data points yielded a moderate curve with slope = -0.0034
(Figure 3B black line), showing that the tempo of gene
loss was not constant over the course of evolution after the
3R-WGD (Figure 3C). This result was essentially
unchanged when we used upper and lower extremes of
the 95% confidence intervals of the estimated times of 3RWGD and lineage divergences in the approximation (relevant slopes were -0.0106 and -0.0030, and -0.0135 and 0.0037 when upper and lower extreme values were used,
respectively; see Figure 3D).
Properties of the gene groups that retained 3R-WGDderived duplicates
We characterized the 3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes on
the basis of several properties of the encoded proteins. In
terms of their locations in the network topologies of LTP,
TT, OT, and TCA, we were not able to find a local concentration of 3R-WGD-derived duplicates (e.g., their localization at upstream or downstream of the pathways; Figure
4). In addition, although most of the proteins included in

the four systems are of different types, we found no significant difference in the frequency of 3R-WGD-derived
duplicates (described in Table 2) among the four networks (χ2 = 1.7266, d.f. = 3, P = 0.6310).
We next compared the function, total length, and number
of interacting partners of the proteins in the networks.
There was no significant difference in the frequency of
each type of function (e.g., enzymes, G proteins, ion channels, phosphorylation enzymes, and receptors) between
the 3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes and 1:1 orthologous
genes (χ2 = 4.3984, d.f. = 5, P = 0.4936; Figure 5A). However, there was a significant difference in the length of the
protein-coding sequences. The protein peptides encoded
by the 3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes tended to be long
(>1000 amino acids) rather than short (<200 amino

acids; χ2 = 8.5044, d.f. = 2, P = 0.0142; Figure 5B; human
protein were used as the hypothetical ancestral state).
Additionally, the 3R-WGD-derived duplicates were
enriched in longer-sized glutamate receptors (GRM1,
GRM5, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, and GRIN2C) compared to the
1:1 orthologous genes, although this trend was not statistically significant (χ2 = 2.2011, d.f. = 2, P = 0.3327). The
average number of interacting partners was also significantly higher for the 3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes (n1
= 71, n2 = 45, Welch's t = 2.0203, P = 0.0470) [see Additional file 1: Table S2]. Within the 3R-WGD-derived
duplicates, there were no significant differences in the
length of protein-coding sequences and the number of
interacting partners among the genes that remain duplicated in one, two, three, and four teleost genomes (see
Table 2; data not shown).

Discussion
Persistence of the duplicated genes after the WGD event
Careful analysis of more than 100 orthologous gene
groups in the tetrapod and teleost genomes suggested that
the genome of a common ancestor of four teleosts
(zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and Tetraodon) contained
a high proportion (90/161 = 56.5%) of duplicated genes
derived from the teleost-specific 3R-WGD (Table 2). This
estimate was produced by extensive data mining of wholegenome databases and reliable ML phylogenetic analyses
of the genes involved in LTP, TT, OT, and TCA. Although
these genes represent small fraction of the whole genome,
and such transcriptional, signal-transduction, and metabolic networks may have different biases for duplicate
gene preservation [21,37], we found no significant difference in the frequency of 3R-WGD-derived duplicates
among the four networks (see Results and Table 2). This
may imply that there is no remarkable difference in retention rate of the 3R-WGD-derived duplicates between subcellular networks that would be important in vertebrate
evolution, and metabolism networks that are common to
eukaryotes. A possible reason for this is the relatively
smaller population size of vertebrates, in which the neutral, random genetic drift is more dominant factor in their
duplicate gene loss/retention [8]. In the monocellular
eukaryotes, which have much larger population sizes, on
the other hand, natural selection would play a more dominant role in duplicate gene loss/retention. Actually, in a
ciliate Paramecium study, it is suggested that gene dosage

constraints (a form of natural selection) after WGD
favoured co-retention of the genes within same metabolic
pathways or protein complexes [39].
If the retention ratio of 56.5% represents a trend in the
whole genome, the duplicate genes generated by the 3RWGD may have occupied more than half of the proteincoding loci in a common ancestor of the four teleosts. This
may even underestimate the true proportion of the 3RWGD-derived duplicates in the common ancestor, since
some duplicates may have been lost independently in all
4 species. In any case, such a large number of duplicate
loci, probably more than ten thousand genes, may have
undergone lineage-specific loss or differential functionalization among teleosts after their diversification. Such lineage-specific gene evolution would characterize the
genome of each teleost lineage, and consequently, contribute to various diversity among modern teleosts, which
include more than 26,000 species, 500 families, and 40
orders [40].
Our results also suggests that many of the 3R-WGDderived duplicate genes persist in modern teleost
genomes. The number of the duplicates identified (Table
3) suggests that they comprise on average 41.4% of the
protein-coding loci in modern teleosts. This value is
higher than those reported in previous studies based on
pairwise comparisons of the human and teleost genomes,
i.e., 15.2% [(2134×2)/28005] to 20.0% [(2009×2)/

20131] [20,41]. These estimations are based on analysis
of much larger number of genes compared to those of this
study, however, these might be underestimations for the
retention rate of 3R-WGD-derived duplicates due to the
limited sensitivity of semi-automatic BLAST-based analyses. In our study, we simultaneously analyzed multiple
teleost genomes using state-of-the-art methods for phylogenetic inference. Thus, we may have more effectively
identified the 3R-WGD-derived duplicates, but instead,
our analysis covers limited fraction of the genomes (116
orthologous genes; about 0.5% of all protein-coding
genes).
Although teleost genomes may contain large number of
3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes as suggested above, it is
reported that teleost and tetrapod genomes have similar
number of protein-coding genes in general (mammals:
22,000 on average in human, mouse, dog, and cow; teleosts: 23,000 on average in Tetraodon, stickleback, medaka,
and zebrafish) [41]. This may be explained by both an
increase of gene number in tetrapods through repeated
chromosomal rearrangements and local gene duplications [16,20], and secondary loss of 1R- and 2R-WGDderived duplicates in teleosts [37]. These issues should be
addressed within the broader context of 1R/2R/3R-WGDs
in early vertebrate evolution based on the emerging
genome sequence data of shark (elephantfish), lamprey,
lancelet, and sea urchin in the future.

lower extremes are shown by black and gray lines, respectively.

Evolution of the duplicate genes derived from the 3R-WGD
The inferred temporal pattern of loss/persistence of the
3R-WGD-derived duplicates (Figure 3) provides new
insights into the long-term evolution of duplicate genes
after WGD. Whereas many (71/116 genes) of the duplicated genes are estimated to have been lost during the initial 75 MY before the divergence of Otocephala (the group
including zebrafish; Figure 3B gray line), on average more
than half (27.3/45 genes) of the genes survived until the
divergence of Otocephala (45/116 genes) persisted for
275 MY (Figure 3B black line). Such a temporal pattern of
duplicate gene maintenance cannot be solely explained by
a complete neutral loss of gene function, which would be
expected to lead to an exponential drop in gene number
over time (Figure 3B gray line). Instead, it appears that the
genes which persisted for 275 MY have been maintained
by selection. This evolutionary scenario is essentially
unchanged if we use both upper and lower extremes of
95% confidence intervals for estimated times of the 3RWGD and lineage divergences (see Figure 3D). Our
results, however, are based on a subset of genes in the
genomes of only four teleosts and an approximate divergence times of teleosts with large error intervals of 50–100
MYA [33]. In addition, our results might be affected by
incompleteness of the draft genome data of teleosts, especially that of zebrafish. Therefore, extrapolating our

model proposed here to genome evolution in 26,000 teleost species over 300 MYA should be verified in further
studies with an increased number of sample genes and
genomes.
The long-term maintenance of the duplicates may be
attributable to sub-/neo-functionalization of their gene
functions [8,42-44] in general, although advantageous
effect of the increase of gene dosage by duplication may
also contribute to the duplicate gene persistence [45]. The
model of subfunctionalization predicts that, initially after
the WGD, many of the duplicated genes were rapidly lost
due to the neutral accumulation of degenerative mutations leading to a loss of gene function (neutral phase; Figure 3C); however, a subset of duplicate genes were
maintained through subfunctionalization caused by
degenerative mutations leading to the loss of a subset of
gene functions. Such subfunctionalized duplicates can
persist for extremely long (evolutionary) periods of time
by selection (selection phase; Figure 3C) and thus afford
opportunities for the evolution of new genes with novel

functions or more adaptive properties (sub-neofunctionalization [26,43,44]). The proposed time course of gene
loss/persistence after the 3R-WGD (Figure 3) seems to be
well-matched with the model of sub-neofunctionalization.
The above view is supported by the present results of several analyses related to protein multifunctionality.
Because the initial subfunctionalization occurs primarily
through degenerative mutations leading to the loss of a
subset of gene functions, it is theoretically possible that
the probability of subfunctionalization depends on the
degree of multifunctionality of the genes or their encoded
proteins [8]. This prediction is supported by the observation that the genes included among the 3R-WGD-derived
duplicates are significantly longer in terms of their coding
sequence (longer sequences likely contain more protein
domains and motifs; Figure 5B) and have a significantly
larger total number of interacting partners [see Additional
file 1: Table S2]. These results, which are compatible with
the theoretical prediction of the subfunctionalization

[8] and, thus, this process will proceed gradually over long
evolutionary periods of time [26]. These issues, however,
should be addressed by further analyses on the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and/or repertoires of
protein function of the respective 3R-WGD-derived duplicates in the future.

model, imply that the 3R-WGD-derived duplicates that
remain in modern teleosts have maintained initially by
subfunctionalization.
The timing of the occurrences of sub-neofunctionalization is important for interpreting our results and understanding long-term genome evolution after WGDs. If the
sub-neofunctionalization have completed mainly in the
initial phase after the 3R-WGD but before the divergence
of the four teleosts (see Figure 3), this would have contribute little to the differential gene functions among teleost
lineages. However, if the neofunctionalization following
subfunctionalization occurred mainly after the divergence
of the four teleosts, such lineage-specific sub-neofunctionalization of many 3R-WGD-derived duplicates would
have contributed to various aspects of teleost diversity. We
propose that the latter is the case in general, because neofunctionalization depends on rare beneficial mutations

Genome and gene duplication and teleost evolution
The present study clearly shows that a few gene groups
among those analyzed here have expanded dramatically
by repeated gene duplications independent of WGD. One
representative of them is the well known OR (olfactory
receptor) gene family. In vertebrates, this family is constituted by about ten subfamilies [46], and the different subfamily has expanded dramatically in each genome of
tetrapods and teleosts, respectively [46,47]. Furthermore,
in the OT system, PDE1C genes were found to have been
duplicated specifically in stickleback genome [see Additional file 2: Fig. S44]. PDE is a key enzyme in the cyclic
AMP pathway, as it regulates the localization, duration,
and amplitude of intracellular cAMP signaling [48]. Sticklebacks, therefore, may have multiple bypass circuits to
regulate the cAMP pathway possibly in the OT system via
sub-/neo-functionalization of these highly duplicated
PDE1C genes. These multiple occurrences of the PDE1C
genes may be a genetic basis for some adaptive traits of
sticklebacks. Recent analysis on the stickleback PDE1C
genes has favoured the notion that these multiple duplicates have been retained, not by sub-/neo-functionalization in their gene functions, but rather through their effect
of increased gene dosage within the OT system, which is
possibly correlated with the territorial behaviour of stickleback [49]. In summary, the above results suggest that
both of WGD and lineage-specific expansion of particular
genes generated genomic characteristics of each species.

It has been suggested that the 3R-WGD promoted speciation and thus led to an increase in species diversity among
teleosts [12,50-54]; however, the association between
WGD and species richness in teleosts remains controversial [55]. Even if the 3R-WGD is less directly associated
with species richness, we propose that the lineage-specific
evolution of many 3R-WGD-derived duplicates, that is,
the differential sub-neofunctionalization or secondary
loss between lineages, contributed to various aspects of
genomic diversity that exists among teleosts. Such diversity may underlie the adaptive radiation of teleosts that
inhabit a broad range of ecological zones – from marine
to fresh water, from deep to shallow sea environments,
and from equatorial to polar regions. To understand the
diversity and evolution of teleosts, as well as vertebrates in
general, it will be particularly valuable to characterize the
differences between teleosts and the basal non-teleost
fishes, which have not experienced the 3R-WGD [24-26],
in relation to the genetic impact of the 3R-WGD.

Conclusion
More than 100 genes was systematically analyzed based
on whole-genome sequences of multiple teleost fish species (zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and Tetraodon) and
state-of-art methods of phylogenetic inference. This
revealed that, while many of the duplicate genes derived
from the teleost-specific 3R-WGD has been rapidly lost
after the 3R-WGD within about 75 MY, the remaining
duplicates may have occupied more than half (56.5%) of
the protein-coding loci in a common ancestor of the four
teleosts. The following temporal pattern of loss/persistence of these duplicates is understood by sub-neofunctionalization model of duplicate gene evolution, and this
view is supported by analysis of length of protein-coding
sequences and numbers of interaction partner of proteins,
which are likely associated with gene multifunctionality.
Based on these results, derived from the first systematic
assessment of evolutionary fate of more than 100 genes
after the 3R-WGD, we propose that many of the 3R-WGDderived duplicates, probably more than ten thousand of
genes, have undergone lineage-specific evolution or secondary loss, and contributed to teleost diversity. Lineagespecific expansion of some portion of gene families also
appears to have contributed to genomic characteristics of
each lineages.

Methods
Identification of orthologous gene groups between
tetrapods and teleosts
Network diagrams for LTP, TT, OT, and TCA, and the coding sequences of the human genes that comprise these
networks were obtained from the KEGG pathway database [38]. The obtained human coding sequences were
used as queries for a BLASTN search against the Ensembl
genome database [27,41]. The following versions of the
Ensembl genome database were used: human (Homo sapiens, NCBI 36, October 2005), chicken (Gallus gallus,
WASHUC2, May 2006), clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis,
JGI 4.1, August 2005), zebrafish (Danio rerio, Zv7, April
2007), medaka (Oryzias latipes, HdrR, October 2005),
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, BROAD S1, February
2006), green spotted puffer fish (Tetraodon nigroviridis,
TETRAODON 7, April 2003), ascidian (Ciona intestinalis,
JGI 2, March 2005), and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster,
BDGP 4.3, July 2005). Since the two pufferfishes Fugu
rubripes and T. nigroviridis are much closer to each other
than to the other teleosts above, only the latter, for which
the genome sequence was determined at relatively high
coverage [16], was analyzed. The resulting BLAST hits
were manually screened (E-value cut-off of < 10-3) and
evaluated for their gene product length and Ensembl
annotations to confirm their similarity to the human gene
queries. When only a partial sequence was found in the
Ensembl database, we predicted the full-length coding
sequence from the genomic sequence using the program
WISE2 [56].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/127

The primary sequences of the proteins obtained by the
above procedure were aligned using ClustalW [57]. All
gap-containing sites were removed. For each alignment, a
preliminary NJ analysis was performed based on Poissoncorrected genetic distances using MEGA 3.1 [58]. Based on
the resultant NJ trees, those sequences comprising clades,
which were apparently distinct from any human query
gene, were excluded. The remaining sequences were again
analyzed by NJ to identify ingroup and outgroup
sequences. The selected primary sequences were then realigned and subjected to ML phylogenetic analysis using
the program TreeFinder (version June 2007) [59,60] with
1,000 LR-ELW (the expected-likelihood weights applied
to local rearrangements of tree topology) edge support
tests [61]. In almost all cases in this analysis, the obtained
tree topology was consistent between ML and second-ML
tree with slight changes in the ML score and supporting
values for the nodes of the tree. When the final ML tree
was ambiguous, further ML analysis was performed based
on nucleotide sequences. The phylogenetic information
contained within nucleotide sequences is generally greater
than that contained within amino acid sequences, and, in
many cases, it increases the resolution of the resulting
phylogeny. Such analysis require significant time and
effort, and therefore could not be applied to all analyses
undertaken in this study. The best-fitting amino acid and
nucleotide substitution models were selected using programs ProtTest 1.4 [62] and ModelTest 3.06 [63], respectively.
Based on the final ML trees [see Additional file 2: Fig. S1–
S63], the genes were classified into four categories: (i)
genes with a 1:1 orthologous relationship [64] between
human and teleosts (Figure 1A); (ii) genes that were
duplicated in human or tetrapods but not in teleosts (Figure 1B); (iii) 3R-WGD-derived duplicates (Figure 1C); this
identification was confirmed by data showing doubly
conserved synteny in the medaka genome [20] [indicated
in Additional file 2: Fig. S1–S63] and genome-to-genome
conserved synteny analyses mentioned below [shown in
Additional file 2: Fig. S64–S68]; and (iv) genes with no
clear orthologous relationship between human and teleosts (Figure 1D). A full list of the genes used in our final
ML analysis, including their Ensembl IDs, is given in
[Additional file 3: appendix].
Synteny analysis
To confirm whether the putative 3R-WGD-derived duplicate genes were actually generated by the 3R-WGD, we
analyzed conserved syntenies in the medaka genome. In
Supplementary Table 15 of the report showing the draft
genomic sequence of medaka [20], the authors presented
information on conserved syntenies in the medaka
genome. Specifically, they determined whether those
medaka genes corresponding to 20,352 human proteincoding genes were located in a block of doubly conserved

synteny (DCS) derived from the 3R-WGD. Using this
information, we confirmed that the inferred teleost-specific duplicate genes were derived from the 3R-WGD. The
results of this validation were shown in supplementary
figures [see Additional file 2] (the data of gene locations
are not shown).
For those teleost-specific duplicate genes that appeared to
be derived from the 3R-WGD but were not located on
DCSs in medaka, we analyzed the genomic regions
around the loci in human, zebrafish, medaka, stickleback,
and Tetraodon. Physical mapping data in the neighborhood of each locus were obtained via queries and BLAST
searches (E-value threshold < 10-3) using the orthologous
prediction section of the Ensembl genome database
[27,41]. We picked up all identifiable genes described as
putative orthologs of the queries. Their genomic locations
were then used to rebuild the synteny maps [see Additional file 2: Fig. S64–S68].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/127

ing partners were counted (Ca 2+ and another protein).
This is because Ca 2+-activated CaM functions as a calcium
sensor and signal transducer for a multitude of proteins.
This view is supported by the fact that the amino acid
sequences of CaM are extremely conserved among vertebrates [67] while the interacting partners of CaM are
numerous. By similar reasoning, the number of interacting partners for PKA was counted as two (cAMP and
another protein). All OR genes among the OT and T2R
genes in the TT network were excluded from the analysis
because the OR and T2R gene families have been enormously expanded by specific duplications in mammals,
and the orthologous relationships between tetrapods and
teleosts are less clear [46,47,68]. If large numbers of OR
and T2R loci were incorporated into the current analysis,
the results would be biased and beyond the scope of this
study. The numbers loci of the taste receptor type 1 genes
(T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3) are as previously reported
[69,70].

Analysis of the temporal pattern of gene loss
The numbers of gene loss events after the 3R-WGD was
estimated using parsimony based on the teleost phylogeny [28,30,31]. The inferred total number of 3R-WGDderived duplicate pairs that persisted in each node of the
phylogeny was matched with the corresponding divergence time estimate [33]. The derived two-dimensional
data points, estimated occurrence time of the 3R-WGD
event (average 353.0 MY ago) [15,17,19], and four data
points representing the current state of the four teleost
genomes were approximated to a neutral model of the
loss-of-function of duplicated genes, αe-2μt [8,65,66],
using least-squares fitting. The parameters μ, t, and α corresponds to the null mutation rate, number of generations
since the time of duplication, and normalization factor,
respectively. In this analysis, absolute time (years) was
used to approximate the number of generations.

List of abbreviations used

Estimation of the number of interacting partner of the
investigated proteins
The number of interacting partners for the proteins in the
LTP, TT, OT, and TCA was counted on the basis of human
network diagrams obtained from the KEGG pathway database [38]. In the case of CAMK2B, CAMK2G, PRKACB,
CAMK2A, CAMK2D, ADCY8, PLCB2, ITPR3, PRKACA,
PRKACG, PRKX, PRKY, CaM, and PKA, those molecular
interactions that served essentially the same function were
counted as one. For example, adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8,
EC: 4.6.1.1) is involved in LTP and TT, and it interacts
with CaM and cAMP in the former, and with cAMP and Gprotein in the latter; however, the total number of interacting partners for ADCY8 was counted as three (CaM,
cAMP, and G-proteins). In the case of CaM, although CaM
interacts with many of types of proteins, only two interact-
