The CAZyome of Phytophthora spp.: A
comprehensive analysis of the gene complement
coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes in
species of the genus Phytophthora
Manuel D Ospina-Giraldo*, John G Griffith, Emma W Laird, Christina Mingora

Abstract
Background: Enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism include Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside
hydrolases (GH), Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases (PL), commonly referred to as carbohydrateactive enzymes (CAZymes). The CE, GH, and PL superfamilies are also known as cell wall degrading enzymes
(CWDE) due to their role in the disintegration of the plant cell wall by bacterial and fungal pathogens. In
Phytophthora infestans, penetration of the plant cells occurs through a specialized hyphal structure called
appressorium; however, it is likely that members of the genus Phytophthora also use CWDE for invasive growth
because hyphal forces are below the level of tensile strength exhibited by the plant cell wall. Because information
regarding the frequency and distribution of CAZyme coding genes in Phytophthora is currently unknown, we have
scanned the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum for the presence of CAZyme-coding genes using a
homology-based approach and compared the gene collinearity in the three genomes. In addition, we have tested
the expression of several genes coding for CE in cultures grown in vitro.
Results: We have found that P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum contain a total of 435, 379, and 310 CAZy
homologs; in each genome, most homologs belong to the GH superfamily. Most GH and PL homologs code for
enzymes that hydrolyze substances present in the pectin layer forming the middle lamella of the plant cells. In
addition, a significant number of CE homologs catalyzing the deacetylation of compounds characteristic of the
plant cell cuticle were found. In general, a high degree of gene location conservation was observed, as indicated
by the presence of sequential orthologous pairs in the three genomes. Such collinearity was frequently observed
among members of the GH superfamily. On the other hand, the CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity
for some of their putative members. Quantitative PCR experiments revealed that all genes are expressed in P.
infestans when this pathogen grown in vitro. However, the levels of expression vary considerably and are lower
than the expression levels observed for the constitutive control.
Conclusions: In conclusion, we have identified a highly complex set of CAZy homologs in the genomes of P.
infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum, a significant number of which could play roles critical for pathogenicity, by
participating in the degradation of the plant cell wall.

Background
Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato late
blight, and as such, a major contributor to the Irish
Potato Famine, is believed to cause annual losses worldwide surpassing $6.8 billion. This is a conservative

estimate corresponding to the loss of approximately 15%
of the global production of potato (20 Mha), valued
about $45.4 billion [1]. Currently, no single strategy is
successful at controlling late blight; hence, integrated
management is presently the most reliable approach for
disease control [2]. The apparent resilience of P. infestans to typical control measures such as the fungicide
metalaxyl [3-7] or new approaches such as the use of

resistance genes [8-10] was observed especially after the
A2 mating type became more prevalent, facilitating sexual reproduction and recombination, and leading to an
increase of the genetic diversity of P. infestans populations [11]. The ability to overcome control alternatives
that had been successful previously is probably due to P.
infestans’ genome plasticity, as evidenced by the presence of multiple isozyme genotypes in sexual populations [12]. Sequence analysis of the gene coding for
glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (GPI) in multiple P.
infestans isolates revealed a widespread allelic assortment and the gene copy number differed in several isolates [13]. The evolutionary variation of the GPI genetic
profile seemed to be concomitant with the emergence of
more virulent P. infestans races [13]. Evidence indicative
of P. infestans’s ability to undergo genome-wide changes
and adaptations was originally reported by Torto et al
[14], who identified a large number of secreted proteins
from EST data sets, some of which could influence the
infection process and manipulate the host plant
response to the pathogen.
The genome of P. infestans has been sequenced
recently and analyses of the complete sequence (~240
Mb) suggest the presence of two distinctive regions, the
largest one (~ 74% of the genome) characterized by the
presence of highly repetitive DNA. In contrast, in P. sojae
and P. ramorum, two other major phylogenetic clades of
the genus Phytophthora, only 39 and 28% of their respective genomes are repeated sequences [15]. The regions
with highly repeated content lack conservation in the
gene order and their gene density is very low. On the
contrary, regions with less repetitive DNA have a high
gene density and the gene order is very conserved. In
general, a significant portion of the P. infestans genome
is populated by transposons, and when compared to the
other two genomes, the expansion in P. infestans can be
attributed to the proliferation of these elements and
other repeats in areas lacking gene order conservation
[15]. An important group of genes found in the repeatrich regions codes for effectors, which are proteins that
can alter the course of disease. This group includes genes
formerly known as avirulence genes, such as Avr3a and
Avr4. A large collection of effector proteins is characterized by the presence of the RXLR-dEER motif in their
sequence and recent analysis indicates that more than
500 putative RXLR-containing genes could be found in
the P. infestans genome [15]. These effectors are thought
to be translocated to the plant cell cytoplasm via haustoria, which are specialized absorbing organs that develop
at the tip of the penetration peg, invaginating the host
cell plasma membrane [16]. The RXLR motif has been
shown to be required for the translocation of these effectors into the plant cell but not for targeting into P. infestans haustoria or secretion to the extra-haustorial matrix

Page 2 of 16

[17]. A second group of necrosis-inducing effectors, initially identified through bioinformatic approaches [14],
was highly represented in the P. infestans genome. These
cytoplasmic effectors, known as Crinkler or CRN, exist as
part of a numerous family of almost 200 members, which
in comparison to P. sojae and P. ramorum, is also considerably expanded [15]. In most cases, effectors are predicted to contain a typical N-terminal signal peptide
[14,18].
While the frequency and distribution of effector genes
in the P. infestans genome has been clearly elucidated,
similar characteristics have not been established for
most genes involved in specific metabolic processes. For
example, carbohydrate-active enzymes (also known as
CAZy enzymes or CAZymes) are involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of glycoconjugates, oligo- and
polysaccharides. Most importantly, carbohydrate-active
enzymes play a central role in the synthesis and breakdown of the plant cell wall. Phytophthora infestans, having a cell wall that includes cellulose as a major
component presumably requires a complement of
CAZymes that can greatly exceed that of fungi. In addition, P. infestans CAZymes can effectively function as
pathogenicity factors by specifically targeting the carbohydrates of the plant cell wall. Thus far, however, a
comprehensive analysis of the CAZyme-coding gene
complement in Phytophthora is still missing.
Four superfamilies of CAZymes have been recognized:
Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside hydrolases (GH),
Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases
(PL) [19]. In fungi, there is abundant evidence suggesting that the GH, PL, and CE superfamilies may act as
cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE), and therefore,
play a role in pathogenicity [20,21]. In P. infestans exclusively, a few reports also support the notion that
CWDE-coding genes exist in its genome [22-25] and
that some CWDE produced by this oomycete are actually secreted [26,27]. In this report, we present a
description of the CAZyme-coding genes, with emphasis
on the CWDE, found in the P. infestans, P. ramorum
and P. sojae genomes, and a preliminary analysis of the
transcriptional activity of some of these genes in P.
infestans cultures grown in vitro. In addition, we present
a comparative analysis of P. infestans CAZy gene repertoire with the respective homologs found in the P.
ramorum and P. sojae genomes.

Methods
Isolates and culturing

Phytophthora infestans isolate FL-01-2, belonging to
race US-8 was used in this study. Cultures were grown
in Rye Agar A or B (for long-term maintenance or sporulation, respectively) [28], or Pea Broth (for mycelial
growth and nucleic acid extraction).

Nucleic acid manipulation

Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from P.
infestans mycelium grown in Pea Broth [13] for ~ 2
weeks at 22°C in the dark before harvesting. Total RNA
was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) following the protocol supplied by the
manufacturer. Genomic DNA was extracted using the
GenElute™ Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), following the instructions provided by
the supplier. Genes and fragments of interest were
cloned in pCR®2.1 TOPO® TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Sequencing reactions were performed by
GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ). DNA digests, and agarose gel electrophoresis were conducted according to
standard procedures [29].
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR
(qPCR)

All RT-PCR reactions were performed using 1 μg of
total RNA treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen),
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and gene-specific primers. Control reactions
(no template and minus reverse transcriptase) were run
to ensure amplification was not due to potentially contaminating DNA. Phytophthora infestans actin A mRNA
was used as a constitutively expressed reference gene.
Primer sequences, amplicon sizes, and other pertinent
data are shown in Table 1. qPCR was conducted in an
iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad).

Candidates for RT-PCR and qPCR were selected on the
basis of significant sequence similarity as determined by
BLASTP searches and the lack of EST evidence supporting their expression as indicated by the information
available for each gene model. Primer pairs were
designed using Primer-Blast, a combination of Primer3
and BLAST [30]. Phytophthora infestans genomic DNA
(as a template) and the Gradient option of the iQ cycler
were used to optimize the amplification efficiency of
each primer pair. Melt Curve/Peak analysis, which measures the melting temperature (Tm) of double stranded
DNA molecules, was used to determine the number of
amplified products and ensure there was no non-specific
amplification. Reactions were conducted as follows: 95°
C/3 min (one cycle) and 40 two-step cycles consisting of
95°C/10 s (step one) and specific annealing temperature/
30 s (step two). All assays were conducted by triplicate.
Amplicons were either sequenced directly or cloned
prior to sequencing to confirm the expected target had
been amplified. Gene expression was evaluated by determining the relative quantity (ΔCT) of the mRNA using
the gene expression analysis software provided with the
iQ5 Cycler.
Data mining and bioinformatics analyses

Data mining was conducted using the assembly 1 of the
P. infestans genome released by the Broad Institute [31]
and assembly 1.1 of the P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes released by the Joint Genome Institute [32,33].

crassa, Phytophthora spp., or Trichoderma viride corresponding to all families belonging to the CE, GH, GT
and PL superfamilies were retrieved from the CAZy
database [34]. Homologous sequences in the P. infestans,
P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes were obtained by
screening the CAZy sequences against the Phytophthora
spp. genome databases using BLASTP. Matches with a
statistical significance threshold (E value) < 10-5 were
selected. Orthologous search was done using the Phylogenetic Resources for the Interpretation of Genomes,
PHRINGE [35], pipeline and the gene mappings
between genomes. Potential subcellular localization and
the presence of putative signal peptides and other motifs
were evaluated with the following algorithms: SecretomeP (non-classical and leaderless secretion of proteins),
SignalP (signal peptide and cleavage sites), TargetP (subcellular location of proteins), NetNGlyc (N-linked glycosylation), NetOGlyc (O-GalNAc glycosylation), NetPhos
(generic phosphorylation sites), all available at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis [36], and big-PI
Predictor (for Glycosylphosphatidylinositol -GPI lipid
anchor- modification site prediction [37].
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequence alignment was done with Clustal W [38]. No
manual adjustments were introduced. Nucleotide distances were estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter
model [39] and phylogenetic inference was performed
by the distance-based Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
[40]. Bootstrap tests with 1,000 replications [41] were
conducted to examine the reliability of the interior
branches and the validity of the trees obtained. All phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and
MEGA version 4 [42].

Results
The CAZyome of Phytophthora spp

Scanning of the P. infestans genome for the presence of
CAZyme-coding gene homologs resulted in a set of 435
sequences. The GH superfamily was the most highly
represented, containing 244 homologs, distributed in 34

families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each 49, 83
and 59 homologs, arranged in 8, 22, and 3 families,
respectively. For each CAZy superfamily, the number of
genes found and the families they belong to are shown
on Table 2. In addition, 96 sequences containing carbohydrate-binding modules (a CBM is defined as a noncatalytic, contiguous amino acid sequence within a
carbohydrate-active enzyme that has the ability to recognize and bind carbohydrate compounds [43]) were identified. Of the 435 putative homologs found, a total of
345 sequences had E values smaller than 10-10. A significant number of genes (123) coded for extracellular proteins (all containing a canonical signal peptide) as
determined by SignalP. Furthermore, 15 other sequences
were predicted to be extracellular by the SecretomeP
algorithm and contained non-canonical secretion signals.
Eight homologs, all predicted to be extracellular,
appeared to contain a signal for GPI lipid anchoring.
The largest set of predicted extracellular proteins containing signal peptide (79) or with non-canonical secretion signals (14) belong to the GH superfamily. There
were 12 and 33 (19 of them with non-canonical secretion signals) potentially extracellular CE and PL members, respectively. No GT genes were predicted to code
for extracellular proteins (see Additional file 1).
Frequently, the majority of members of a superfamily
belonged to specific families. For example, GH families
76 and 81 had 17 members, families 3 and 95 had 20
members, and family 28 contained 21 putative genes. In
the GT superfamily, families 41 and 71 had 14 and 15
putative genes, respectively. Family 4 and family 10 of
the CE superfamily contained 14 and 15 putative genes,
while all but three of the PL genes found belong to
families 1 and 3 (18 and 39 putative genes, respectively).
Supercontig1.2 appeared to contain the highest number
of CAZy members (26), followed by supercontig 4 (24),
supercontig 13 (20), supercontig 16 (19), and supercontig 3 (18).
In the genome of P. sojae a total of 379 CAZy homologs were identified. The GH superfamily was the most
densely populated with 191 homologs, belonging to 25
families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each 35, 99,

and 54 homologs, distributed in 3, 18 and 3 families,
respectively. In this group, 287 sequences had E values
< 10 -10 . With regards to the CWDE group (280
sequences), 194 were predicted to code for extracellular
proteins, with the vast majority containing a classical
signal peptide. Fourteen homologs, two of them without
a clear signal peptide, contained a sequence for GPI
lipid anchoring (see Additional file 2).
Phytophthora ramorum contained 310 CAZy homologs in its genome. The GH repertoire was the most
numerous, composed of 167 putative genes distributed
in 27 families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each
21, 75, and 47, organized in 5, 17, and 3 families,
respectively. A total of 277 putative homologs had E
values smaller than 10-10. Of the 235 CWDE found, 153
were predicted to encode extracellular proteins, with a
considerable number of them carrying a signal peptide.
Only five homologs, all with signal peptide, contained a
signal for GPI lipid anchoring (see Additional file 3).
Members of each superfamily have undergone multiple gene duplications as revealed by phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic trees of all PL genes found in
the P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes are
shown as an example (Figures 1, 2 and 3). A Codonbased Test of Positive Selection, which provides the
probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality (dN = dS. dS and dN are the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per site,
respectively) in favor of the alternative hypothesis of
positive selection (dN > dS), was conducted using the P.
infestans PL dataset. Results indicate that there is no
evidence to reject the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality
(P > 0.05).
In all three genomes, CAZy homologs not considered
to be extracellular appeared to be delivered mostly to
the cytoplasm, the mitochondrion, or the plasma membrane. Interestingly, a few sequences were predicted to
target the nucleus. Ab initio prediction of intron presence in all three genomes revealed that 61.4% of the P.
infestans CAZyme-coding genes contain introns. In P.
sojae, 51.2% of the genes had introns, and in
P. ramorum, there were 37.7% of intron-containing
genes. The number of introns per gene ranged from one
to ten and their size generally fluctuated between 40
and 200 bp, although bigger introns appeared to exist
(see Additional files 1, 2, 3). A significant number of
introns have been validated through expressed sequence
tag (EST) comparisons. It is important to note, however,
that a large set of introns remains to be confirmed,
especially in the cases of genes with more than 3 introns
and/or intron size greater than 200 bp. In this case, RTPCR analysis is required to confirm whether these
introns truly exist or are artifacts introduced in the original gene assemblies.

Gene synteny and collinearity

Syntenic analysis of the Phytophthora spp. genomes,
based on regions of those supercontigs (known as scaffolds in P. sojae and P. ramorum) containing the largest
number of CAZy homologs revealed, in general, a high
degree in location conservation (i.e. multiple genes
found in a P. infestans supercontig had homologs in the
same P. sojae or P. ramorum scaffold. An example of
this syntenic relationship is shown in Figure 4. Gene
collinearity for a specific CAZy superfamily was also
apparent as indicated by the presence of multiple,
sequential orthologous pairs when the P. infestans genome was compared with either one of the other two
genomes (Figure 5a and Figure 5b). Such collinearity
was frequently observed among members of the GH
superfamily. On the other hand, the CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity for some of their putative
members (Figure 6a and Figure 6b).
A preliminary search in the P. sojae, P. ramorum, and
other oomycete genomes for orthologs to the CAZy
genes found in the P. infestans genome using the Phylogenetic Resources for the Interpretation of Genomes
(PHRINGE. http://oomycetes-public.genomeprojectsolutions-databases.com/cgi-bin/clusterSearch.pl) pipeline
and the gene mappings between genomes revealed the
presence of orthologous genes in the target genomes for
a majority of CAZy members (Table 3). On a few occasions, orthologs to the P. infestans CAZy genes were
found in the P. sojae genome only; more rarely, orthologs appear to exist in P. ramorum but not in P. sojae.
Less frequently, potential orthologs could also be identified in the genomes of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis
and Pythium ultimum. All, but one, of the CE homologs
had orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes, and a total of 17 putative CE-coding genes
appeared to have paralogs within the P. infestans genome (see Additional file 4). Two hundred fourteen GHcoding genes had orthologs in both P. sojae and P.
ramorum. Three putative GH-coding genes had an
ortholog only in P. ramorum, while seven other had an
ortholog in P. sojae only. The remaining 20 genes did
not appear to have orthologs in either genome. In addition, due to duplications in the target genomes, several
P. infestans genes seemed to have multiple co-orthologs,
mostly in the P. sojae genome (see Additional file 5).
Ninety-five of the GH-coding genes appeared to have at
least one paralog in the P. infestans genome. Of the GT
complement, 72 members had orthologs in both, P.
sojae and P. ramorum genomes while three had orthologs in P. sojae only. Only 16 of members of this group
appeared to have paralogs in the P. infestans genome
(see Additional file 6). A total of 56 (out of 59) P. infestans PL-coding genes had orthologs either in both,
P. sojae and P. ramorum (53), or in P. ramorum only (3)

(see Additional file 7). Forty-eight members of this
CAZy superfamily exhibited paralogs in P. infestans
(Table 3).
Expression analysis of a subset of CE-coding genes

Sixteen putative CE-coding genes for which no EST evidence was available in the databases, were analyzed for

expression using cDNA templates derived from total
mycelial RNA extracted from P. infestans grown in vitro
(Table 4). RT-PCR experiments allowed us to detect
transcripts for seven of the CE-coding genes studied and
visual inspection indicated that presumably some of
these transcripts were being expressed at different rates.
In order to quantify the differences of expression

Figure 2 Evolutionary relatedness of P. sojae PL genes. Phylogenetic relationships among the putative PL genes found in P. sojae were
inferred using deduced amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic trees were obtained by the Neighbor-joining method. Robustness of the trees
was evaluated by a bootstrap with a 1000 replications. Not all number are shown to avoid cluttering in areas containing neighboring clades

suggested by the RT-PCR assays, we designed real-time
qPCR experiments for all genes, including those that did
not appear to be expressed in vitro. These qPCR assays
were performed using three technical replicates for each
CE-coding gene and for actin A, the constitutive control; a no-template control reaction was also included.
In order to minimize the effect of potential pipetting
errors and achieve meaningful results, only trials in
which individual replicate values had standard deviation
< 0.5 were used to determine the mean threshold cycle

(Tc) for each gene and for subsequent analyses. A comparison between the expression levels of all CE genes
and that of the constitutive control actin A revealed that
all CE genes were expressed at lower levels than actin
A, with relative fold expressions (RFE) fluctuating
between 0.00010 and 0.21440. Based on the RFE for
each gene, four different groups could be formed: maximum expression (Group 1: RFE > 0.04), medium expression (Group 2: RFE = 0.003 - 0.039), minimal expression
(Group 3: RFE = 0.001 - 0.0029), and very low

expression (Group 4: RFE < 0.001). Results of the qPCR
experiments indicate that transcripts from genes
PITG_02545, PITG_03543, and PITG_08912 accumulated at a higher rate than any other transcript, as determined by their threshold cycle and RFE. Four genes
(PITG_07734, PITG_08421, PITG_10850, and
PITG_11976) had medium levels of expression and
another group of four genes (PITG_08863, PITG_08914,
PITG_14190, and PITG_18907) showed minimal levels
of expression; the remaining 5 genes had expression
rates barely above background levels. Overall, the
expression profiles, as measured by qPCR, matched
those observed by RT-PCR. The only exceptions were

PITG_08912 and PITG_03543, which had not been
clearly detected by RT-PCR.

Discussion
The complexity of carbohydrate metabolism is in part
explained by the extensive assortment of carbohydrate
compounds and their diverse stereochemistry. Catalysis
of the biochemical reactions involving these compounds,
therefore, requires a vast array of enzymes, now referred
to as “carbohydrate-active enzymes” (CAZymes). Four
CAZyme superfamilies of structurally related enzymes
that degrade, modify, or create glycosidic bonds are
known: Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside

hydrolases (GH), Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases (PL). Since most of these enzymes target carbohydrates that are part of the plant cell wall,
they are also referred to as cell wall-degrading enzymes
(CWDE). Analysis of the genomes of P. infestans and
two other Phytophthora spp. has revealed that these
organisms contain a large multiplicity of CAZymes
(Table 2). Most of these enzymes are unequivocally
involved in the biochemical pathways aimed at maintaining Phytophthora metabolism. The fact that a significant
number of these CAZymes contain carbohydrate-binding
modules, which allows them to recognize and bind carbohydrate compounds [43], would support this assessment. Moreover, the presence of relatively large
complement of CAZy genes with predicted canonical or
non-canonical secretion signals, which would enable
them to effectively function as CWDE, would seem to
indicate that these oomycetes also rely on enzymatic
activities to successfully infect and colonize their hosts.
Surprisingly, despite its greater number of CAZy homologs, P. infestans contains a smaller set of extracellular
proteins than P. sojae or P. ramorum. The GH superfamily, with 115 families currently recognized based on their
amino acid sequence [all of which catalyze the hydrolysis
of a glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates
or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety [44-46]], is the most highly represented in the P.

infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes. Given the
complexity of carbohydrate biochemistry and the broad
range of hydrolytic activities it involves, is not unexpected that all genomes examined exhibit a considerable
number of GH members. A number of these genes lack a
cellulose-binding domain (CBD), a characteristic that was
originally noted in the first GH family 5 gene cloned
from a phytopathogenic fungus [47,48]. The CBD
anchors the enzyme to crystalline cellulose substrates
and it has been suggested that its absence would, therefore, facilitate diffusion of the enzyme through the host
cell wall [22]. Within the GH group, the family with the
largest number of members was family 28, which is comprised of enzymes with multiple, but related, functions
(E.C. 3.2.1.*). These are mostly polygalacturonases (PGs)
associated with the hydrolysis of galacturonic acid-based
compounds, which are usually found as part of pectate
and other galacturonans. PGs are believed to play a
major role in the degradation of the plant cell wall by
fungi through the hydrolysis of the pectin layer, which
facilitates tissue invasion and maceration. Although large
families of PG-coding gene have been characterized in P.
cinnamomi [49] and P. parasitica [50] and individual
PG-coding genes have been cloned and characterized
from P. infestans [25], this is the first comprehensive
report on this group of genes in P. infestans. PG genes
are expressed in planta, and at least in the case of

Figure 6 Members of CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity for some of their putative members. In the case of CE, only one
(out of five) gene located in a 50-kb region of supercontig1.16 had an ortholog in a corresponding scaffold in P. sojae but not in P. ramorum
(A). In the case of PL, three (out of eight) genes located in a 50-kb region of supercontig1.14 had orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum (B).

P. parasitica, their expression has been clearly linked to
pathogenicity [50]. GH families 3 and 95 had 20 members; giving the biochemical activities of the former
(mainly b-glycosidase, which chiefly targets the hydrolysis
of terminal, non-reducing b-D-glycosyl residues, releasing b-D-glucose) the number of gene copies is not unusual. In contrast, the relatively high extent of the latter
family is puzzling, as its key role is the hydrolysis of

fucose derivatives, which in comparison with other carbohydrates are less abundant in the plant or oomycete
cell. Intriguingly, fucosterol (a sterol with a fucose moiety) is the most prominent sterol found in oomycetes
capable of synthesizing sterols de novo; however, so far
there is no evidence that Phytophthora is among such
organisms. Therefore, the presence of this large complement of putative proteins with a-fucosidase activity

remains difficult to explain. Finally, GH families 76 and
81, which are involved in the random hydrolysis of
(1®6)-a-D-mannosidic linkages in unbranched (1®6)mannans and the hydrolysis of (1®3)-b-D-glycosidic linkages in (1®3)-b-D-glucans, respectively, were also
highly represented. Mannans are found in the fungal cell
wall, but more importantly, are present in all lineages of
land plants analyzed to date, where they are key constituents of the cell wall and play major roles as carbohydrate
storage compounds and in metabolic networks devoted
to other cellular processes [51] and b-1,3- and b-1,6-glucans compose the bulk of the oomycete cell wall but are
also components of the plant cell. Hence, the presence of
multiple members of these families could confer a significant evolutionary advantage to P. infestans.
Although the number of putative GT members was
considerably large, this was not surprising as the transfer
of sugar moieties resulting in the formation of glycosidic
bonds during the biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyl transferases [52]. Members of
family 41 (one of the two most highly represented GT
families in P. infestans) catalyze the glycosylation of proteins at asparagine residues while members of family 71
(E.C. 2.4.1*) have, in general, a-mannosyltransferase
activity (but more than 200 specific activities can be
found within this enzyme class). Perhaps, the most
interesting members found within the GT superfamily
are the four cellulose synthase genes (GT family 2),

which represent a novel class and whose function has
been recently characterized in depth [53]. These genes
are required for pathogenicity as evidenced by P. infestans inability to form functional appressoria when the
genes were silenced through RNA interference [53].
Even more intriguing is the presence of a fifth member
of the GT family 2 that matches very strongly (E value
= 0) the putative chitin synthase gene from Magnaporthe grisea. Although no direct evidence exists favoring the presence of chitin in P. infestans cell wall, the
existence of chitin synthase genes has been demonstrated in other oomycetes [54,55], suggesting that chitin
is indeed produced in these species. We have cloned
this gene from both P. infestans and P. sojae and preliminary experiments indicate that the gene is expressed
in cultures grown in vitro. Results from functional characterization assays will be published elsewhere.
For Phytophthora pathogenesis, however, the presence
of multiple PL and CE putative members is highly significant, as both types of enzymes are involved in the
degradation of cell wall components either by cleavage
of the polysaccharide chains, which leads to the formation of a double bond at the resulting non-reducing end,
or by catalysis of the acyl group removal from substituted saccharides, respectively [56]. All but a very few of
the PL genes found belong to families 1 and 3 (18 and
39 putative genes in P. infestans, respectively), and
almost 40% of these putative genes have canonical or
non-canonical secretion signals. Both of these families
are involved in the degradation of the plant cell’s middle
lamella, either by hydrolysis of pectate (families 1 and 3)
or its methyl ester, pectin (family 1). Families 4 and 10
of the CE superfamily have the largest numbers of
members in P. infestans. The putative CE family 4 genes
found (14) act on deacetylation of xylans, chitin, and
peptidoglycans while the family 10 members (15) are
esterases acting on non-carbohydrate substrates. Previous reports indicate that the cutinase gene family has
undergone a notable expansion in P. sojae and P.
ramorum [57]. Members of this family (CE family 5)
hydrolyze cutin, a polymer of hydroxy fatty acids that
are usually C16 or C18 and contain up to three hydroxy
groups. In P. infestans, the actual set of genes with true
cutin hydrolase activity (E.C. 3.1.1.74) is equal to P.
ramorum’s (4) but relatively small compared to the
number of these genes found in P. sojae (16). It is worth
noting that, so far, no conclusive evidence has been
found linking Phytophthora pathogenicity with cutinase
activity.
Phylogenetic analysis for each superfamily suggests a
very active evolutionary history characterized by constant duplications (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Two major
clades, in which most PL genes are contained, can be
seen in the phylogenetic tree for the PL superfamily in

Ospina-Giraldo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:525
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/525

P. sojae and P. ramorum. An even closer relationship
among the PL members can be seen in the phylogenetic
analysis results obtained for P. infestans. In this species,
essentially all PL genes have evolved from a single common ancestor. Genomic comparisons conducted with
other oomycete genomes including P. sojae, P.
ramorum, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Pythium
ultimum indicate that homologs for a large number of
CAZyme-coding genes exist in all oomycete species studied; however, it is plausible that the fast evolutionary
pace shown by the P. infestans genome has led to the
appearance of a few unique genes for which no homologs have been found elsewhere (Table 3). We used a
cut-off value of 10 -5 to determine homology by
BLASTP; however, even when a smaller cut-ff (10 -10 )
was used a large set of potential homologs was found
(in P. infestans this equals to only 90 less sequences
than with the higher cut-off). This would support the
validity of the results obtained using this method.
The nature of the plant cell wall, and the fact that cell
walls constitute the fundamental tier where plant-pathogen interactions take place would help explain the need
for a multiplicity of CAZymes in Phytophthora. In the
primary cell wall, the cellulose microfibrils and the
hemicellulose [this term applies to all glycans extracted
from the cell wall, to which the cellulose microfibrils are
non-covalently bound, including xyloglucans (XyGs) and
glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAXs)], are embedded in a
pectin matrix. Both, XyGs and GAXs are composed of
an extensive variety of modified and non-modified carbohydrate monomers [58]. As the cell wall is the first
barrier that must be breached in order to penetrate and
successfully colonize the host, it is plausible that an
abundant assortment of enzymes targeting the glycosidic
bonds be produced by the pathogen. In addition, these
enzymes could also be associated with the necrotrophic
phase [59]. The structure and composition of P. infestans cell wall is still ill defined; however, it is clear that
cellulose is one of its major components (as opposed to
chitin, which is the major component of fungal cell
walls [60]). Therefore, the overall carbohydrate metabolism and the specific chemical activities needed for
pathogenicity would help explain the vast array of genes
coding for CAZymes found in these three genomes.
True synteny is loosely defined as a correspondence in
the actual chromosomal locations of two gene homologs
from two related species [61]. Despite the gross and
small-scale chromosomal rearrangements typical of fungal genomes, which can vary by more than an order of
magnitude both within and between kingdoms [62], P.
infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum appear to have
retained many structural similarities in their chromosomes (Figure 4). Previously, extensive collinearity
between orthologs from P. sojae and P. ramorum had

Page 13 of 16

been reported [59]. Whereas it is not possible to ascertain the actual level of synteny among the three Phytophthora genomes given that individual chromosomes
were not sequenced, the presence of multiple, collinear
homologs in every scaffold or supercontig from each
genome would indicate that, in most cases, they all
share a very similar chromosomal arrangement (Figure
5). A few CE and PL genes appear to be the exceptions
(Figure 6). Determining the true ortholog of a gene is a
challenging task given that sequences evolve at different
rates and duplications and losses are fairly common; in
some cases, orthologs are 100% identical and in other
cases there is no detectable sequence similarity. This
makes the use of distance measuring methods insufficient to determine orthology (Jeffrey Boore, pers.
comm.). For this reason, in addition to using the gene
mappings between genomes, we also looked at the evolutionary trees generated by PHRINGE, which provide
the actual evolutionary history of the genes and facilitate
the accurate determination of orthology by analyzing
gene duplications and losses. Most instances of orthology were validated by both methods; however, in several
cases, potential orthologs found in the gene mappings
were not validated by PHRINGE and vice versa. Even
within PHRINGE, while numerical values (low seed
score) could suggest orthology, the phylogenetic tree did
not support such relationship. Moreover, there were
cases in which seed score was high but the phylogenetic
tree appeared to support orthology. Interestingly, in the
GH and GT superfamilies, the number of potential
orthologs in the target genomes (when present) was
usually one, and only in a few situations there appeared
to be more than one ortholog for a gene. In contrast,
most P. infestans CE and PL genes had more than one
(usually up to four) orthologs in both P. sojae and P.
ramorum genomes. The overall expansion of these gene
families in each species is evidenced by the number of
paralogs found, especially within the GH and PL superfamilies, with the latter showing an extremely high percentage of members (81.4%) with paralogous genes
(Table 3 and Figures 1, 2 and 3).
For a large number of homologs identified there is
EST evidence that suggests they are expressed in vitro.
However, a considerable group of gene models in all
genomes still lacks any evidence of expression. Therefore, we designed specific primers targeting distinctive
regions of these genes using a Clustal-based sequence
alignment, as a starting point to select the most dissimilar regions, and Primer-Blast. We attempted to
design primers that would span an intron, but frequently this was not possible due to the fact that many
P. infestans genes do not contain introns. In addition,
these primers were intended for both RT-PCR and
qPCR use, but the more stringent primer design

Ospina-Giraldo et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:525
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/525

constraints of the latter technique became a limiting
factor, making it difficult to design primers that would
successfully work in both types of assays. Using RTPCR, we were able to detect seven of the 16 genes targeted. Because of its greater sensitivity and the need to
quantify the differences in expression rates, we evaluated the same genes using qPCR. When determining
the mean threshold cycle (Tc) only trials in which individual replicate values had standard deviation (SD ) <
0.5 were used; this would minimize the effect of potential pipetting errors. Hence, on several occasions multiple trials were run in order to obtain consistent values
that were reliable for further analyses. Because we used
equal amounts of starting material for each qPCR
experiment, we were able to use the Relative Quantity
(ΔCT) method of analysis, in which no modification of
the data is needed to obtain normalized data. Clearly,
in comparison to actin A, all CE genes were expressed
at much lower levels than actin A, and the relative
quantity and fold expression of the majority of genes
was below 0.005. Although all genes could be detected,
there were apparent differences in expression as suggested by the RFE and the ΔC T method of analysis.
Two of the genes that were expressed at the highest
rate (PITG_02545 and PITG_08912) belong to CE
family 8, whose known activity is pectin methylesterase. The third one (PITG_03543) has pectin acetylesterase activity (family 13). Interestingly, in all genomes
studied, there is a considerably high number of CE
family 8 gene copies. This result matches our expectations very well as pea seeds constitute the main nutritional component of growth medium and these
combined activities would be required for its utilization. The other genes analyzed have various esterase
activities but may not be essential for in vitro growth.
We are in the process of evaluating by qPCR the
expression of all CAZyme gene models for which there
is no EST evidence or that contain questionable intron
size or a number of introns exceeding the usual number typically found in oomycetes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified a highly complex set of
CAZy homologs in the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae,
and P. ramorum, a significant number of which could
play roles critical for pathogenicity, by participating in
the degradation of the plant cell wall. For most of these
genes there are homologs in the three species, distributed and organized in patterns that strongly support the
existence of synteny and gene collinearity among these
species. Preliminary experiments with highly specific
gene primers (as shown by the results of the Melt
Curve/Peak assays run during qPCR analysis) indicate

Page 14 of 16

that all these genes are expressed in cultures grown in
vitro, albeit at different rates.
