Abstract
Background: Dermatophytes are the primary causative agent of dermatophytoses, a disease that
affects billions of individuals worldwide. Trichophyton rubrum is the most common of the superficial
fungi. Although T. rubrum is a recognized pathogen for humans, little is known about how its
transcriptional pattern is related to development of the fungus and establishment of disease. It is
therefore necessary to identify genes whose expression is relevant to growth, metabolism and
virulence of T. rubrum.
Results: We generated 10 cDNA libraries covering nearly the entire growth phase and used them
to isolate 11,085 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), including 3,816 contigs and 7,269
singletons. Comparisons with the GenBank non-redundant (NR) protein database revealed
putative functions or matched homologs from other organisms for 7,764 (70%) of the ESTs. The
remaining 3,321 (30%) of ESTs were only weakly similar or not similar to known sequences,
suggesting that these ESTs represent novel genes.
Conclusion: The present data provide a comprehensive view of fungal physiological processes
including metabolism, sexual and asexual growth cycles, signal transduction and pathogenic
mechanisms.

Background
Dermatophytes, consisting of organisms in the Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum genera, are the primary etiologic pathogens of various dermatophytoses,
such as tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea inguinalis, tinea
manus, tinea unguium and tinea pedis. These infections
are widespread and increasing in prevalence on a global
scale. Indeed, in some geographic regions, dermatophyte
infection is now considered a major public health concern.
Unlike other fungi, dermatophytes can cause infections in
healthy, immune-competent individuals. Estimates suggest that 30 to 70% of adults are asymptomatic carriers of
these fungi [1]. T. rubrum is the most common superficial
fungus, accounting for at least 60% of all superficial fungal infections in humans. This organism may remain viable in the environment for over six months, thus
accounting for widespread infections. Transmission
occurs most often from person to person [2], for example,
by shedding of infected skin cells and hair and by direct
body contact [3].
Diagnosis of dermatophyte infections relies on clinical
presentation, requiring successful isolation and culture
and microscopy. It will take 2 to 4 weeks to culture and
pleomorphic growth can lead to misidentification. Sometimes the morphological phenotype is not very stable.
Rapid diagnostic tests using current molecular methodologies have been slow to develop for the dermatophytes
[4].

tion as well as in the inflammatory reaction [2,11-13].
Thus, they are considered to be critical virulence factors
for dermatophytes. There are many reports of the isolation and characterization of one or two proteases from an
individual species of dermatophyte [14-18]. In T. rubrum,
Some keratinases have been isolated and a subtilisin gene
family were identified at the genetic level [19-22]. Jousson
et al isolated a five-member secreted metalloproteases
(MEP) family from genomic libraries of T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes and M. canis. Further phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the metalloproteases secreted by the three
species in vitro are encoded by orthologous genes,
strongly suggesting that the multiplication of an ancestral
metalloprotease gene occurred prior to the dermatophyte
species divergence [23]. However, only a small number of
proteases from dermatophytes have been characterized at
the genetic level.
Taken together, the lack of effective diagnostic and treatment strategies, the large number of individuals that experience dermatophyte infections, and the economic
consequences highlight deficiencies in the research efforts
aimed at understanding dermatophyte. T. rubrum is the
most common superficial fungus, inducing dermatophytoses in various parts of the human skin, and can also
cause deeper infections such as kerions, abscesses and
granulomas. Research examining the pathogenesis of T.
rubrum in numerous skin infections is needed in order to
develop novel therapeutic agents and identify potential
drug targets.
In the present study, we constructed various T. rubrum
cDNA libraries and obtained 11,085 unique expressed
sequence tags (ESTs). By analyzing these ESTs, we were
able to further elucidate the physiological activities in
metabolism, signal transduction, sexual life cycle, pathogenesis and cell wall composition of T. rubrum. These
sequences provide an unparalleled resource for the future
understanding of this remarkable fungus. Furthermore T.
rubrum represents an attractive model species with which
to study dermatophytes and other pathogenic filamentous fungi.

Furthermore, despite the availability of new systemic antifungal therapies, nail infections are particularly difficult to
eradicate, presenting a 25 to 40% recurrence rate [5].
Another increasing problem in clinical treatments is growing resistance to antifungal drugs. In the past decade,
more and more cases of azole- and terbinafine-resistant
fungal infections have been reported [6-8]. Ryder et al
[9,10] characterized at the molecular level the cause of the
resistant phenotype of some clinical isolates, considering
the resistance in some T. rubrum clinical isolates to terbinafine appears to be due to a single amino acid substitution
in the gene squalene epoxidase.

Results and discussion

T. rubrum is anthropophilic, specialized to infect humans,
but rare animal infections have been reported. It is urease
negative and vitamins independent. On the Bromcresol
purple-(BCP)-milk solids glucose media, it shows
restricted growth, no indicator color change for 10 to 14
days, then profuse growth with indicator change to purple
(alkaline). Its teleomorph has not yet been found. Arthroconidia and mycelial fragments are the infectious agents.

Expressed sequence tags sequence determination
EST sequences were produced from 10 different cDNA
libraries. After trimming for the vector and poor quality
segments, a total of 34,670 sequences were identified and
11,085 unique ESTs were isolated. Isolated ESTs included
3,816 contigs and 7,269 singletons. All the constructed
libraries, culture conditions and sequencing statistics
employed in this study are summarized in table 1. The
average sequence length of these unique ESTs was 586
nucleotides (nt). Approximately 8,639 (78%) of the
unique ESTs were longer than 400 nt.

In the synthesis of the cDNA first strand, incomplete
cDNA synthesis and/or 5' truncation of mRNA transcripts
could lead to an overestimation of the gene number identified from our analysis. Accuracy of the estimation absolutely depends upon the quality of the library. Among the
7,764 matched ESTs, 1,439 could be matched to reference
genes if the subjected starting site was set to be the first
coding amino acid; meanwhile 2,325 matching genes
could be found if the subjected starting site was allowed
to be any of the first 10 amino acids. These data confirm
that the quality of the libraries is reliable.
Comparison to Non-redundant and Clusters of
Orthologous Groups databases
Identified ESTs were compared with the GenBank nonredundant (NR) protein database. This comparison enabled us to assign putative functions to or find homologs
from other organisms for 7,764 (70%) of the ESTs. The
remaining 3,321 (30%) ESTs were only weakly similar or
not similar to known sequences (E ≥ 1E-05), suggesting
that they represent novel genes.

The comparative results for the ESTs with respect to the
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, and its
eukaryotic counterpart termed the KOGs database, are
summarized in table 2. The ESTs identified herein contained a broad range of genes, predominantly encoding
putative proteins involved in primary metabolism, gene
expression, post-translation processes and cell structure. A
significant proportion of the identified ESTs were
matched to genes involved in transcription and signal
transduction, suggesting that T. rubrum has an elaborate
regulation system.
The COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75% of the
185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of
unicellular organisms, including 3 Eukaryota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Encephalito-

zoon cuniculi. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs)
include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and
Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe),
and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters
of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or ~54% of
the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products [24].
Because the RNA processing in eukaryotic cells is more
elaborated, and eukaryotic cells have some structures that
prokaryotic cells lack, for example, nuclear and mitochondria, more genes involved in RNA processing and modification [A], chromatin structure and dynamics [B], cell
cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning [D],
nuclear structure [Y], cytoskeleton [Z] and intracellular
trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport [U] were
identified in KOGs than COGs. The difference between
gene number of class energy production and conversion
[C] was mainly due to the mitochondrial related genes.
On the contrary, more genes involved in cell motility [N],
mainly encoding secretory pathway and cell motivity
related proteins, were identified in COGs than KOGs.
Meanwhile, the COG/KOG result was also affected by the
subtle difference in functional classification to function
similar
proteins,
especially
transporters.
Comparison of ESTs to those already available in GenBank
To date 3,749 T. rubrum ESTs have been released to GenBank by other research groups, most of which (3,711)
were obtained in condition mimicking virulence by Zaugg
and Monod et al. When we compared these 3,749 previously reported ESTs to the NR database and to our EST
pool, we found that 3,112 of the previously described
ESTs in GenBank had matching homologs in other organisms in the NR database (E <1E-05) and that 637 ESTs
were only weakly similar or did not match known
sequences. Among the 3,749 ESTs identified previously,
2,738 ESTs matched 1,325 unique ESTs in our data (E

these data be somewhat redundant. The remaining 1,011
did not have matching homologs in our EST database,
including 263 ESTs which had no homology whatsoever
in the NR database. Meanwhile, 748 of the 1,011 ESTs
obtained only in their research had some homology with
sequences in the NR database (E <1E-05), while 620 ESTs
appeared to be hypothetical proteins, predicted proteins
or unnamed protein. Some secreted proteinases that were
identified by Monod et al. were not identified in our study
(i.e. subtilisin-like protease SUB4, dipeptidyl-peptidase

IV, leucine aminopeptidase 1, leucine aminopeptidase 2
and a putative secreted metalloprotease 4), suggesting that
the condition in their research may be a more suitable
environment to induce expression of these proteins. The
proteinases subtilisin-like protease SUB1 and subtilisinlike protease SUB5 were expressed not only in the condition they mimicked but also in YPD media (see Additional file 1). By comparison with previous released ESTs,
our data supply the information about gene expression in
different conditions, advancing the current knowledge of
T. rubrum transcriptome.

Metabolism and secondary metabolism
Metabolic overview
A large percentage of T. rubrum genes were annotated in
glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation systems, as
expected from what is known from other aerobic filamentous fungi. Genes corresponding to the citrate cycle
enzymes and to components of complexes I (NADH-CoQ
reductase), II (Succinate-CoQ reductase), III (CoQ-Cytochrome C reductase), and IV (Cytochrome C oxidase)
were identified. The presence of these genes reflects the
fungus' ability to perform complete aerobic pyruvate degradation and oxidative phosphorylation.

The pathways involved in metabolizing mono- and disaccharides, such as glucose, fructose, mannose, and sucrose,
as well as polysaccharide starch, were best represented in
the identified ESTs. There were also a large number of
membrane transporters for saccharides such as xylose and
fucose. Among the identified ESTs, all aminoyl-tRNA synthases have been previously described with the exception
of cyseine-tRNA synthase, of which only one contig was
found to exhibit weak homology (C3495-Contig1, E
value 0.00008). Comparison of our ESTs data to KEGG
revealed that these proteins were probably involved in
many amino acid metabolism pathways, including glutamate metabolism, alanine and aspartate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, methionine
metabolism, cysteine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, lysine biosynthesis, arginine and
proline metabolism, histidine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. Analysis of
these pathways indicated that T. rubrum could itself synthesize lysine. It could synthesize some amino acids via
amino acid synthetase including glutamate, glutamine,
asparagine, cysteine, tryptophan and threonine, and it can
also synthesize some other amino acids via amino transfer
reactions. The primary lipids in T. rubrum are sterol and
phospholipid. Our analysis of the metabolic pathways in
T. rubrum revealed that it can also synthesize co-enzymes
such as riboflavin, nicotinate, nicotinamide, coenzyme A,
ubiquinone, and folate. The genes probably involved in
the synthesis of thiamine included: NMT1 protein, THI4
protein, ThiC protein and a putative ThiG protein.
Because T. rubrum's vitamin independence serves to separate it from species such as Trichophyton violaceum that
have vitamin requirements, identification of the ESTs
involved in vitamin synthesis is of great significance for
molecular diagnosis. Some ESTs probably involved in
metabolism are included in additional files (see Additional file 2).
Secondary metabolism
Secondary metabolites are a remarkably diverse class of
cellular products that often exhibit taxonomic specificity.
Secondary metabolites are generally considered "nones-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/255

sential" for organismal growth in culture. In addition to
the metabolic pathways mentioned above, there are also
several secondary metabolic pathways present in T.
rubrum. It has long been known that dermatophytes can
survive in toxic environments, presumably through the
production of biological tools to resist these toxins.
Indeed dermatophytes have even been isolated from
sewer water and polluted soil containing organic compounds such as aromatic compounds. The pathways
implicated by the EST analysis are consistent with T.
rubrum's capability to enzymatically degrade various toxins such as phenanthrene, dibenzofuran, ethylbenzene,
styrene, fluorene, and 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-Bis-(4'-Chlorophenyl)Ethane(DDT) (see Additional file 3).
Similar to other pathogenic filamentous fungi, such as
Magnaorthe grisea [25] and Aspergillus fumigatus [26], several important secondary metabolic products, were also
found in T. rubrum; these included non-ribosomal peptide
synthases, polyketide synthases, two putative dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, a putative arsenate reductase
and a hydrophobin. These gene products may be related
to T. rubrum growth and pathogenicity. Polyketides
(derived from polyketones) are a class of secondary
metabolites produced by most organisms, but they have
been most extensively examined in bacteria and fungi. In
fungi, numerous functions have been proposed for
polyketides, including the production of toxins [27,28]
and spore pigments [29,30]. Although it is well known
that T. rubrum can produce pigments, the relationship
between secondary metabolic pathways and pigments
production remains unresolved. The various identified
ESTs involved in secondary metabolism are listed in additional files (see Additional file 3).
Interestingly, T. rubrum harbors a putative sterigmatocystin biosynthesis monooxygenase StcW (C1113-Contig1),
and a probable sterigmatocystin biosynthesis P450
monooxygenase STCL (Cytochrome P450 60B,
EST000637, [GenBank:DW406216]), suggesting that it
very likely may produce sterigmatocystin. However, confirmation of this possibility will require further investigation. Sterigmatocystin is of particular significance in
evaluating the toxicity of T. rubrum products because prior
evidence indicates that it is probably toxic to the human
liver.
Although it is suspected that Trichophyton mentagrophytes
can produce a penicillin-like substance [31], we did not
find any evidence suggesting that T. rubrum generates antibiotic-like by-products.
Signal transduction
We also identified a variety of signal transduction systems
in T. rubrum, such as MAPK, cAMP-dependent pathways,

Page 5 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:255

G-protein pathways, Ras pathways, and a large number of
serine/threonine protein kinase/phosphatases and signal
histidine kinases. Although the first four systems are generally conserved among fungal and mammalian species,
the numbers and functions of signal transduction of histidine kinases vary between fungi. For example, in S. cerevisiae there exists only one, but in Neurospora crassa [32]
there are 11 different histidine kinases. Indeed, there are
many differences in the numbers and types of histidine
kinases between filamentous fungi and yeast. Some experimental results [33-36] obtained with Candida albicans
and Aspergillus fumigatus suggest that histidine kinases are
related to fungal pathogenesis. In T. rubrum many ESTs are
homologous to histidine kinases, some of which may be
related to osmotic and nutrient responses. Several identified histidine kinases contain PAS/PAC domains, suggesting that they are involved in oxygen and light responses.
In addition to histidine kinase-related ESTs, we also identified Calcium-Calmodulin homologues and related proteins, suggesting that Ca-CaM pathways may be utilized
by T. rubrum, similar to the model organism Neurospora
crassa. Commonly, Ca2+ release from internal stores is
mediated by the second messengers inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cADP ribose, or by Ca2+-induced
Ca2+ release [37]. Although InsP3 is present within Neurospora hyphae [38] and T. rubrum, Neurospora lack recognizable InsP3 receptors, ADP ribosyl cyclase and
ryanodine receptor proteins, which are principal components of Ca2+ release mechanisms in plant and animal
cells. These observations raise the question of whether
there may be other second messenger systems that are
responsible for Ca2+ release from internal stores that
remain to be discovered in filamentous fungi. InsP3
receptors, ADP ribosyl cyclase or ryanodine receptor proteins were also not found in our EST data (the existence of
these genes can only be determined after the whole
genome is sequenced). Thus the mechanism of T. rubrum
Ca-CaM pathways remains to be determined. The various
identified ESTs involved in signal transduction are listed
in additional files (see Additional file 4).
Sexual and asexual development
Although the sexual life cycle has been described for Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton ajelloi and Microsporum canis [2,39], which are all heterothallic species, the
sexual cycle of T. rubrum remains to be elucidated. We
compared sexual-cycle related genes with those in other
fungi, and our findings suggest that T. rubrum may be
capable of sexual reproduction.

Sexual reproduction in ascomycete filamentous fungi is
governed, in part, by two different mating-type genes that
establish sexual compatibility: one gene encodes a protein
with a high mobility group (HMG) domain, and the other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/255

encodes a protein with an alpha box domain (MAT). Such
MAT containing genes are termed alpha mating-type
genes. Homothallic fungi typically possess both matingtype genes and are self-fertilizing. Heterothallic fungi possess only one mating-type gene and require a partner with
a different complementary mating-type gene. Although
the MAT locus has not yet been found in T. rubrum, HMG
is present (4 ESTs: EST000702, [GenBank:DW406281];
EST001404, [GenBank:DW406983]; EST004330, [GenBank:DW680849]; EST004146, [GenBank:DW680665]),
and a large number of meiosis-related genes were identified in the ESTs, many of which were also found in
Aspergillus niduluns and/or A. fumigatus. An analysis of 215
genes implicated in the fungal mating process, pheromone response, meiosis and fruiting body development
revealed that many genes present in A. nidulans [26,40,41]
are also present in T. rubrum, including several genes for
which the only known function is related to sexual reproduction (see Additional file 5). These results suggest that
T. rubrum may also possess sexual cycles. However more
in-depth exploration will be required in order to determine whether they indeed possess sexual cycles.
The current research on the fungal asexual development
cycle primarily involves studies of Neurospora crassa and
Aspergillus niduluns, and the literature contains two distinct models. Our comparison of the identified T. rubrum
ESTs with the NR protein database, revealed a key enzyme
(FlbD, EST023258, [GenBank:DW699777], E value 5E52) that is present in A. niduluns [41], but no key enzymes
present in Neurospora crassa. Because in A. nidulans four
proteins (FlbC, BrlA, AbaA and WetA) besides FlbD are
also required in macroconidiation pathway, it is still
unclear whether T. rubrum is more similar to A. niduluns or
N. crassa with regards to asexual development.
Extracellular proteinases
The most evident dermatophyte feature is the ability to
digest keratin. Dermatophytes can degrade human and
other animal keratin protein and utilize it. This represents
the pathogenic feature that differentiates dermatophytes
from other fungi. The secreted proteinases of dermatophytes play an important role in the process of infection
and are thus considered the primary virulent factors.
However, only a few proteinase sequences have been
identified thus far in T. rubrum [19-22,42-45]. In our data,
secreted proteins were firstly analyzed by the NR comparison result. To the putative secreted protein identified in
NR database, all of the corresponding ESTs were further
subjected to SignalP prediction analysis. As to the ESTs
listed in the Additional file 6, 48 of them were predicted
to contain a signal peptide. Among the T. rubrum ESTs,
identified secretory systems include type I, II, III and V,
with type II, III being the most heavily represented. We
also identified a large number of putative secretion related

pathways and putative secreted proteinase, including
some serine proteinases, aspartic protease, alkaline proteinase, peptidases and metalloprotease. (see Additional file
6). Among the serine proteinases, 10 unique ESTs were
homologous to the known dermatophyte subtilisin-like
serine protease family members SUB1, SUB5, and SUB6
[22]; meanwhile no identified ESTs were homologous to
SUB2, SUB3, SUB4, or SUB7. The identity of the 6 serine
protease ESTs with highest homology to T. rubrum serine
proteinases varied from 80% to 93%, suggesting that the
genes may be selectively spliced, and/or the family may
have other members, and/or that these genes have many
copies in the genome.
Secreted metalloproteases are thought to be associated
with lesion extension [15]. Recent reports [46] have identified a nitrogen regulating factor response region located
upstream of the Microsporum canis MEP1 gene, consistent
with the finding that, at the beginning of infection, there
are only a few urea molecules, amino acids and glucose
molecules available as a nutrient resource in sweat. Aspartic protease is an acid proteinase whereas secreted metal
proteinase and subfamily members are neutral or basic
proteinases. The presence of these proteinases supports
the finding that initially T. rubrum can grow in either
acidic or basic pH environments.
These proteinase and peptidase findings suggest that they
may also be related to amino acid transportation. During
T. rubrum infection, extracellular proteins are hydrolyzed
into peptides by secreted proteinases then are further
degraded into amino acids or dipeptides by peptidases
and finally transported into cells. The identification of
these proteinases and peptidases increases our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism underlying T.
rubrum infection.
These secreted proteinases can not only degrade proteins
such as keratin, elastin and collagen to supply nutrients to
the fungi, but can also induce delayed-type hypersensitivity (such as with the SUB family and Tri r4) [1,22]. However, although the T. rubrum allergen Tri r4 EST shares
98% homology with that in Trichophyton mentagrophytes, it
is clear that the inflammation mediated by T. rubrum is
not as severe as that induced by T. mentagrophytes . This is
probably due, at least in part, to the presence of multiple
inflammatory factors in T. mentagrophytes. When comparing the putative virulence factors present in T. rubrum with
those in A. fumigatus [26] we also observed that many
known virulence factors in A. fumigatus were not present
in the identified T. rubrum ESTs. Likewise, many putative
T. rubrum virulence factors were not found or were divergent in A. fumigatus. For example, the mep1 gene exists in
both A. fumigatus (Afu8g07080) and dermatophytes, but
the two sequences were highly divergent (E value 5e-26).

Cell wall
The cell wall is a structure that humans lack but that fungi
have. Therefore, the cell wall represents an ideal target for
novel anti-fungal drugs. Many cell wall-related proteins
were found among the presently identified ESTs, including chitin synthesis, chitinase, β1,3-glucan synthase, β1,6glucan synthase, and 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme.
By analyzing the pathways involved in cell wall synthesis,
it can be inferred that T. rubrum is probably capable of
synthesizing peptidoglycan, the primary component of
gram-positive bacteria. The principle enzymes involved in
the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamyl-2, 6-diaminopimelate-Dalanyl-D-alanine
ligase
(EST020893,
[GenBank:DW697412], GO:0008766) and phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase
(EST009048,
[GenBank:DW685567], EC:2.7.8.13) were identified in
our EST data. But it is still to be determined by experimental confirmation. We also identified some putative proteins that are likely to be involved in sterol synthesis,
which is a primary target for clinically-available drugs. The
components of the identified ESTs that are involved in cell
wall synthesis are listed in table 3.

Conclusion
The estimated T. rubrum genome size is at least 22.05 Mb
[47]. And we estimate that a significant proportion of the
gene content of T. rubrum is represented in this collection
of sequences. Although ESTs can only represent genes that
are actively expressed in particular phases, they complement the value of genomic sequencing through the functional identification of novel genes and provide
information about gene structure and expression patterns
[48-53]. Thirty percent of the 11,085 contigs and singletons identified in our analysis represent unique genes.
Our Blast searches revealed that 33% of the 11,085
unique sequences possess matches in the yeast genome
(<e-5), suggesting that there are clear distinctions (~67%)
between yeast and filamentous fungi. These findings highlight the need for additional research on filamentous
fungi.
In summary, although superficial fungi are the primary
human pathogenic fungi, our knowledge about these
organisms remains limited. T. rubrum represents an ideal
model for the study of superficial fungi; our work in identifying ESTs in T. rubrum cDNA libraries will facilitate a
greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying its growth, metabolism, pathogenesis and
drug resistance. In addition, our work may aid in the identification of novel effective drug targets and anti-fungal
agents.

Methods
Preparation of strains and materials
T. rubrum (strain BMU01672) and medium have been
described previously [54].
Preparation of cell cultures
Preparation of hyphae cultures
A few hyphae of T. rubrum were inoculated on potato glucose agar and incubated at 27.5°C for 2~3 weeks. In order
to get cDNAs covering the entire growth phases, the
hyphae were inoculated in liquid YPG medium (10 g/L
yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 10 g/L D-glucose) and incubated in a 27.5°C bath shaker for 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 20, 22,
26, 28, 34 and 36 d, respectively. Combine the mycelium
from (7,10, 15, 20, 28) (7, 10, 16, 22, 26, 28), (16, 20,
22), (26, 28), and (34, 36) days, thus get 8 samples (or
mixtures) from 7, 10, 14, (7, 10, 15, 20, 28), (7, 10, 16,
22, 26, 28), (16, 20, 22), (26, 28),(34, 36) day. All the
samples or mixtures were used to construct unnormalized
cDNA libraries except the mixture (7, 10, 15, 20, 28),
which was used to prepare the tester cDNA of a subtracted
cDNA library. A large number of sequenced plasmids in 7,
10, and 14 days libraries were in vitro transcripted (Riboprobe® in vitro Transcription Systems, Promega) and the
RNA products were further reverse transcripted into the
driver cDNA (Clontech PCR-Selected cDNA Subtraction
Kit). The fungal samples (or mixtures) were centrifuged
and the supernatant were discarded. The pelleted mycelium were washed twice with PBS.
Preparation of spore cultures
A few hyphae of T. rubrum were inoculated on potato glucose agar and incubated at 28°C for 2~3 weeks. The
spores were then washed by liquid YPG medium and filtered by cell filter to get rid of the hyphae. Part of the
spores obtained were incubated in YPG medium at 28°C
for 12 hours. Finally we got two samples, spores and incubated spores, respectively.
Isolation and purification of total RNA and mRNA
Total RNA and mRNA were isolated and purified as
described previously [54].
Construction of the cDNA library
Construction of the unnormalized cDNA library
The 9 cDNA libraries (7 representing mycelium and 2 representing spores) were constructed following the protocols of the SUPERSCRIPT™ Plasmid System with
GATEWAY™ Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning
(Invitrogen).
Construction of the subtracted cDNA library
The subtracted library was constructed following the protocols of the Clontech PCR-Selected cDNA Subtraction
Kit. According to the instruction of the Kit, driver cDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/255

will be subtracted from the tester cDNA therefore a normalized library is constructed.
Isolation and purification of plasmids, and sequencing of
clones
The cDNA plasmids were isolated as described previously
[54]. Sequencing was performed with a generic T7 primer
located 5' upstream of the inserted segments, following
the protocol of the PRISM Big Dye Terminator Kit on an
ABI3700 or MEGABACE automated sequencer.
Bioinformatic analysis
Sequence data processing, EST clustering and re-assembly
The processing method has been described previously
[54].
EST analysis and construction of the metabolic pathway
The clustered EST consensus sequences were assigned
with potential functions through homologous comparisons by BLASTX searches of the GenBank non-redundant
(NR) protein database (07/2005), Gene Ontology (GO,
11/2005) and Yeast Genome Database (YGD, 11/2005).
ESTs were further classified according to the NCBI Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins database (COGs,
06/2005) and the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups
(KOGs, 06/2005). The metabolic pathways of T. rubrum
were partially reconstructed by searching for known pathway homologs found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes database (KEGG, 11/2004). Secreted proteins were analyzed by comparison to NR. All the threshold cutoff were E<1E-05. As to the putative secreted
protein identified in NR database, all of the corresponding ESTs were further subjected to SignalP prediction analysis.
Accession numbers
The sequences have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers from [GenBank:DW405580] to [GenBank:DW407270] and from [GenBank:DW678211] to
[GenBank:DW711189]). All the information about GenBank numbers, contigs assembly, and ESTs annotation
could be obtained form our Trichophyton rubrum database
[55].
