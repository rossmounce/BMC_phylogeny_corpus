Abstract
Background: Creating new protein domain arrangements is a frequent mechanism of
evolutionary innovation. While some domains always form the same combinations, others form
many different arrangements. This ability, which is often referred to as versatility or promiscuity of
domains, its a random evolutionary model in which a domain's promiscuity is based on its relative
frequency of domains.
Results: We show that there is a clear relationship across genomes between the promiscuity of a
given domain and its frequency. However, the strength of this relationship differs for different
domains. We thus redefine domain promiscuity by defining a new index, DV I ("domain versatility
index"), which eliminates the effect of domain frequency. We explore links between a domain's
versatility, when unlinked from abundance, and its biological properties.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that domains occurring as single domain proteins and domains
appearing frequently at protein termini have a higher DV I. This is consistent with previous
observations that the evolution of domain re-arrangements is primarily driven by fusion of preexisting arrangements and single domains as well as loss of domains at protein termini.
Furthermore, we studied the link between domain age, defined as the first appearance of a domain
in the species tree, and the DV I. Contrary to previous studies based on domain promiscuity, it
seems as if the DV I is age independent. Finally, we find that contrary to previously reported findings,
versatility is lower in Eukaryotes. In summary, our measure of domain versatility indicates that a
random attachment process is sufficient to explain the observed distribution of domain
arrangements and that several views on domain promiscuity need to be revised.

Background
Domains are protein structural units that are also evolutionarily conserved on sequence level [1-3] (see also
review by Bornberg-Bauer et al. [4] and references
therein). While there are numerous combinations of
domains (which we call domain arrangements), there are by
orders of magnitude fewer domains.

Furthermore, a large part of most proteins can be mapped
to known protein domains [5,6]. Thus, domains can be
viewed as the building blocks of proteins: most known
proteins are composed of a limited number of domains
and some other structural units such as coiled-coils. Most
domains are found in identical combinations in all proteins in which they occur. However, some domains form

a large number of different combinations [7-9]. For example, the SH3 domain occurs in as many as 654 different
arrangements in various proteins in the SwissPfam [10]
database only.
The ability of a domain to form different combinations
was first termed domain mobility [1,11] and this term is
still sometimes used in the context of intron-wise modular recombination [12]. However, it turns out that novel
combinations usually do not arise by domains being
transferred from one protein to another, but by events
such as the fusion of one protein with another or loss of
terminal protein fragments [13-18]. Therefore, the term
"domain versatility" or "domain promiscuity" seems to be
more appropriate [4]. In the following, promiscuity will
refer to a domain's tendency to combine with other
domains to form different proteins. Understanding the
tendencies of domains to form different combinations is
crucial for understanding the evolution of multidomain
proteins [19-24], genomic comparisons [20] and even
findings of direct medical impact [25].
Several measures of domain promiscuity exist (see Tab.
1). One counts the number of different domains, with
which the given domain occurs in a protein (NCO) [7].
However, with this approach, even domains that always
co-occur in the same local context, ie. have the same
neighbouring domains, have increased promiscuity. This
is because there is no distinction between co-occurring
domains that are positioned next to the domain of interest and co-occurring domains found at distant sites within
a protein. A possible solution can be to count only the
number of different immediate neighbours (NN) [26].
Tordai et al. [12] used yet another measure, in which they
count in how many different triplets a domain occurs
(NTRP). A unique triplet is composed of three domains –
the domain of interest and its N- and C-terminal neighbours.
Domains and their ability to form different combinations
can be represented as a graph, allowing the usage of network-analysis tools. A co-occurrence network can be constructed as follows: nodes represent domains and edges

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/285

between two domains are drawn if both domains occur at
least once in the same protein. Since most domains occur
in only one combination, but few domains form a large
number of combinations, the network is scale free [7,27].
Several investigations focused on such co-occurrence networks of proteins [7,20,21,25]. By analysing the co-occurrence graph, "hubs" can be identified. Such hubs
correspond to domains that have a high number of links
to other domains.
Few factors have been proposed to influence a domain's
likelihood to form many combinations. First, a domain is
less likely to form combinations if it does not have a
robust, autonomous fold [28]. Secondly, Vogel et al. [29]
have shown that the combination tendencies of domains
can be explained by a preferential attachment model originally described by Koonin et al. [27]. In this model,
domains that have a high abundance tend to form more
combinations, i.e they are apparently more promiscuous.
However, promiscuity is, in this model, a consequence of
a random evolutionary process in which selection does
not directly play a role. If this is the case, the concept of
domain promiscuity (that is, that some domains have an
inherent property that makes them more promiscuous
than others) would be devaluated. For example, the fact
that a domain is a hub in a domain co-occurrence network
would not give more information than the statement that
this very domain is widely spread. Another property of
domains that seems to be connected with promiscuity is a
domains average size in amino acids. Tordai et al. [12]
have found a weak, negative correlation (r = -0.15)
between domain size and NTRP, meaning that small
domains tend to be more promiscuous. However,
whether domain size is correlated with abundance
remains to be tested. Furthermore, they have shown that
certain classes of domains are more versatile than others.
For example, extracellular proteins and proteins located
on type 1-1 exons are found to form a higher number of
triplets (NTRP).
Therefore, an important question arises: are all domains
equally promiscuous given a certain number of occurrences? What observations concerning the causes of versa-

Results and Discussion
Measures of domain promiscuity and the domain
versatility index
Existing measures of domain promiscuity
First we asked whether different measures for asserting
domain promiscuity produce similar results. We compared the following methods: number of different direct
neighbours of a given domain (NN), number of domains
with which a given domain occurs in the same arrangement (NCO) and number of triplets (NTRP) (Tab. 1, see
Methods for details). We found that all applied measures
strongly correlate with each other and with the number of
occurrences of a given domain (Fig. 1). Thus, most of the
variation in domain promiscuity as defined by any of the
existing measures can be explained by the number of
occurrences.

tility are still supported if domain abundance is corrected
for? Is the model of evolution completely random? In this
study we show that, while taking a simple measure of
domain promiscuity (such as the number of co-occurrences) is misleading, there is a property of domains that
(i) is not simply correlated with the frequency of a
domain, and (ii) corresponds to a domain's tendency to
form combinations. We propose that a measure, which
will be defined in the following, should be used that disentangles a domain's promiscuity from its frequency. We
call this measure domain versatility index.

The data presented further were obtained using the
number of neighbours (NN) as a preliminary measurement for promiscuity. However, the results are similar if
other measures are selected for computation (see supplementary material).
Correlation between number of occurrences (N) and number of
observed neighbours (NN) across genomes
To understand the relationship between the number of
occurrences of a domain and its promiscuity, we investigated the following question in more detail. If the number
of observed neighbours correlates with number of occurrences, does, for a given domain, the number of its neighbours in a given genome correlate with the number of
occurrences of that domain in that genome? In other
words, assume one counts the number of occurrences (N)
of a certain domain in different genomes. For each
genome, we compare N with the number of neighbours
this domain has in the given genome. We wanted to know
if there is a correlation, in a given genome, between the
number of occurrences of a domain and the number of its
neighbours. First, we divided the SwissPfam database in
sets, each corresponding to one organism only. Secondly,
we compiled a list of all domains found in SwissPfam. For
each of these domains, we analysed each of the genome
files separately. Given the domain and organism, we
counted the number of occurrences (N) of this domain as
well as the number of its neighbours (NN). For each
domain, we analysed the relationship between NN and N.
A comparison of this relationship for two domains and
sample plots for selected domains are displayed in Fig. 2.
Each of these plots corresponds to a domain or domain
clan (see Methods for the description how calculations
were made for domain super-families; domain clans were
taken from Pfam [10]).

Many domains can be found in only one or two genomes,
or are always present in one or two different arrangements
only. We find that 86,252 Pfam A and B domains (74%)
are found only in one or two proteins in the SwissPfam
data set. 77,629 domains (66%) have only two or fewer
different neighbors. For Pfam A domains the corresponding numbers are 1624 (26%) and 1265 (20%), respectively. Therefore, no regression can be calculated for these
domains. However, for the domains for which a correlation could be reliably calculated, all of them show a significant correlation between N and NN. In fact, the
relationship between NN and N is almost perfectly loglinear for many domains (see Fig. 2 and supplementary
material). We find that, for a given domain, the number
of occurrences in a genome is a very good predictor of promiscuity when promiscuity is defined by NN, NCO or
NTRP. The tight relationship between N and NN underlines the fact that measures such as the number of co-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/285

occurrences, neighbours or local triplets of a protein
essentially only show how abundant a domain is.
According to the previously proposed random model of
evolution [29], the promiscuity of a domain defined in
terms of co-occurrences is tightly linked to the frequency
of a domain. If this was the case, then the apparent promiscuity of domains does not necessarily depend on any
inherent property of the domain itself. Instead, it may
indicate that such domains had more opportunity to
propagate and rearrange, for example because they are
older. In other words, given the high correlation between
N and NN, domain promiscuity based on NN does not
give substantially more information than its abundance.
To understand how domains differ in their inherent properties to form new combinations, these two factors –
number of abundance and promiscuity – must be
unlinked. This prompted us to search for a new measure
of promiscuity that would not be correlated with domain
abundance. Using this measure, it should be possible to
find out which properties of domains correlate with their
abundance, and which show the intrinsic ability of a
domain to form new combinations.
We observed that the strengh of the relationship between
N and NN differs for different domains. Fig. 2A shows an
example of two domains – a methyltransferase domain
and the Sushi domain. For both domains, there is a strong
relationship between the number of occurrences (N) and
the number of neighbours (NN). However, given the
same N, the methyltransferase domain has many more
neighbours than the Sushi domain.
The domain versatility index (DVI)
Although, as shown above, several measures of promiscuity are actually measures of their abundance, we see varying dependency of all these measures on the number of
occurrences of the domain (e.g. of NN on N) for different
domains. We argue that this measure reflects the concept
of versatility better than other measures which are correlated with domain abundance.

Let us consider the following theoretical example. Let
domain A have a large number of neighbours (Fig. 3). In
the genome I, it occurs three times (N = 3) and forms four
combinations in which it has altogether three different
neighbours (NN = 3). In the same genome, another
domain B has three occurrences but only one neighbour
(N = 3, NN = 1). If we take NN as the measure of promiscuity, B will appear to be less promiscuous than A. Next,
let us consider the situation in a second genome II (Fig. 3).
Here, domain A has 6 occurrences and four neighbours,
while domain B has 4 occurrences and 3 neighbours.
Thus, the NN of domain B is still smaller than the NN of
A. However, we see that, despite the fact that domain B

Examplary calculation of the DVI
Examplary calculation of the DVI. Exemplary calculation of the DV I. Sets of proteins belonging to two distinct genomes
are indicated as strings of domains represented by boxes in the top left. The occurrence of two exemplary domains, A and B,
is displayed in the table, along with two measures of domain promiscuity. N denotes the total occurrence, NN the total number
of direct neighbours and NCO the total number of co-occurrences for a given domain in its respective genome. Grey shaded
fields within the NN and NCO fields indicate the specific domains that yield the respective values. In essence, the DV I represents the strength of the relationship between N and NN, indicated by the graph to the right. Each line represents a domain as
indicated by associated boxes. The slope for the two domains, A and B, signifies the DV I. The desired unlinking of the versatility measurement from the total occurrence is clearly illustrated; despite the overall lower occurrence of domain B, it tends to
form new combinations more readily indicated by the steeper slope in the relationship between N and NN.

occurs only once more, it gains two neighbours while
domain A occurs three more times gaining only a single
new neighbour. It seems as if domain B has some property
that, illustrated in the relationship between NN and N,
makes B more readily form new combinations despite it's
overall lower frequency in comparison to domain A. We
thus wanted to obtain a parameter that describes a
domain's tendency to from combinations, but is independent of the frequency with which a domain occurs in
a given genome. Therefore, we defined the Domain Versatility Index (DV I) as the strength of the relationship
between the number of occurrences of a domain and the
number of its neighbours. More precisely, we calculate the
logarithmic regression of NN over N, and take the linear
coefficient as DV I.

Calculating the DV I can be done using different
approaches. For example, one can include or exclude
Pfam B domains. Furthermore, as only few data points
exist for many domains, some of the DV I values are
loaded with large regression error. Thus, it seems reasonable to select a cut-off for the percentage error. We only
considered domains, for which the regression coefficient
error was smaller than 10%.

We observe that different domains exhibit different versatility. In essence, the DVI measures how likely a domain is
to gain new combinations given a certain abundance in a
certain genome. We measure the DVI by comparing abundances and domain combinations in different genomes.
Each data point shows how this relationship evolved in a
given context of genome evolution. Genomes evolve,
among others, by genome and gene duplications during
which the abundance of domains increases. How many
new combinations are formed after such events through
modular rearrangements depends on the ability of a
domain to gain these new combinations. Thus, if we
observe a strong linear relationship across genomes and

Additionally, the number of neighbours is limited by the
number of occurrences. In any given protein a domain can
have at most two neighbours. Thus, if a domain occurs
once, it can only have two neighbours; if it occurs twice, it
can only have at most four neighbours. More abundant
domains rarely achieve the maximum possible number of
neighbours. However, domains occurring with a low copy
number in a genome tend to approach the limit, thus
facilitating a steeper slope of the regression line for small
N. Thus, for computational purposes, it is reasonable to
select only those domains for calculation that occur in at
least one genome with at least a given number of neighbours. We tested several approaches. For example, we

even kingdoms, we conclude that there are intrinsic,
domain-specific constraints that act on the evolution of
domain combinations throughout the whole evolutionary history. It is therefore important to calculate the DVI
of domains in many genomes to investigate how domain
arrangements evolve.

tested regression models more complex than log-linear,
simple linear regression without logarithmic transformations and different versatility measures (NTRP or NCO)
than the number of neighbours (NN). All the different
calculation procedures give similar results, and the
obtained coefficients are highly correlated (see supplementary material). The different DV I sets calculated using
different approaches and the overall DV I distribution correlate (Pearson r correlation coefficient > 0.8).
Furthermore, our initial analyses have shown that
domains that form repeats (for example, LRR 1 or Ankyrin
repeat) have an unusually low DV I (see supplementary
material). One can explain this by the fact that most
occurrences of these domains fall within a repeat stretch,
while the expansion of protein repeats [30] does not
increase the actual number of neighbours. To remove this
effect, we considered stretches of one repeated domain as
a single occurrence following the approach by Ekman et
al. [31]. Here, we present results of the DVI calculation
using restrictive thresholds. We only calculated the DV I
for Pfam domains that (i) occur in at least 3 genomes, (ii)
have at least 20 neighbours in at least one genome and
(iii) have a low error (error of the DV I < 10%). In this set,
we were able to define a DV I for 358 Pfam A domains and
58 Pfam B domains. The distribution of the calculated DV
I is roughly normal with mean 0.60 ± 0.14. If the constraints are relaxed, the results are similar; however, the
error of the calculated coefficients is larger.
Furthermore, as expected, the DV I does not correlate
either with the number of occurrences, N, or with other
promiscuity measures such as number of neighbours, NN
(Fig 2, supplementary material). The full results tables can
be downloaded from the supplementary material web
page.
We find low DV I values for several repeat domains such
as the extensin domain (Extensin_1) or leucine rich repeat
(LRRNT), despite having corrected for the number of
repeats. Also, other domains such as Sushi or the Receptor
L domain which are very frequent have a low DV I.
Domains with a high DV I include several transcription
related genes such as Zinc finger, bZIP or basic helix-loophelix domain (bHLH), but also the caspase recruitment
domain (CARD), chaperone domain DnaJ and different
transferase domains (Tab. 2). In order to be able to calculate the DV I for a given domain, the domain in question
must occur in several genomes. Thus, the DV I cannot be
calculated for domains that are not widely spread, for
example because they occur only in a few known proteins.
The problem of the low coverage of the PFAM database by
domains with a calculated DVI has, in fact, two solutions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/285

Obviously, with each new genome sequenced and annotated, the amount of data for evaluation will grow and
thus also the number of domains that have an assigned
DVI. In fact, we used the complete proteome data from
Integr8 database [50] to analyse the DVI of 749 full
genomes. This increased the number of Pfam A domains
with a DVI assigned to 727, and the data obtained was
almost identical to the DV I derived from the SwissPfam
database (r = 0.9). Furthermore, it turns out that the ratio
NN
N

is significantly correlated with DVI (r = 0.7, p < 10-15;

see supplementary data) and thus can be used as a proxy.
Finally, the low number of the DVIs obtained was partly
due to the rigorous thresholds applied. Relaxing the
thresholds we obtain a DVI for over 1,200 Pfam A
domains. We have repeated the analyses with this data set
and found that our findings remain unchanged (see supplementary material). Thus, the relatively small coverage
of Pfam A+B is not an inherent limitation, because it
depends only on the amount of available sequence information. With the growing number of completely
sequenced genomes, it will become possible to calculate
this property for many more domains.
A recently published method by Basu et al. [32] tries to
adress the problem of domain versatility in a similar manner. The method also builds upon a calculation of normalising the number of neighbours of a given domain by
its frequency. However, our method corrects for gene
expansions within a genome and for domain expansions;
furthermore, since it includes both PfamA and PfamB
domains, a possible problem with low coverage of amino
acid sequences is avoided. Last but not least, the DVI corresponds directly to the evolutionary expansion of
domain neighbourhood as a result of the increase of
domain abundance (Fig. 2). Thus it reflects directly an
evolutionary process and can be easily interpreted as the
likelihood of a domain to form new combinations.
To compare DVI with the weighted bigram frequency
index presented by Basu et. al [32], we applied the goodness of fit statistics R2 to the DVI (linear and logarithmic
regression) of every domain and to a regression model
that corresponds to the weighted bigram frequency index.
We find that the logarithmic regression model outperforms the bigram frequency index in 95% of the cases and
the linear model in 62% of the cases. The average difference between the DVI (defined by the logarithmic regression model) and the weighted bigram frequency index is
12%.

Domains with a medium DV I

Domains with a high DV I

What makes a domain versatile?
The hypothesis that some domains might be more versatile than others – irrespectively of whether they are more
frequent – is intriguing. We wanted to know whether,
given the same frequency of occurrence, some domains
will propagate and form new combinations more easily
than others. We attempted to elucidate whether a certain
property of a domain influences its versatility. Therefore,
we explored the following possible links to the DV I:
domain age, length and pattern in forming domain
arrangements. Furthermore, we tested the influence of
genetic mechanisms on the DV I. In particular, we studied

the influence of LTR retrotransposons on the DV I because
of the clear diagnostic features they exhibit and the established methods available to detect them. Retrotransposons can occasionally move non-viral domains and
could thus enhance domain recombination rates. We also
wanted to know whether domains with a certain function
have a higher DV I. It is conceivable that, depending on a
function and particular selective pressures, some domains
may be more "useful" for the organisms in different protein contexts than others. For example, domains that are
responsible for protein-protein interactions or DNA binding should be more likely to occur in different combina-

tions. Vogel et al. [29] explored the relationship between
domain abundance and number of neighbours (NN),
however they did not find any conclusive results.

due to the fact that these domains had more time to
spread, in accordance with the model presented by Vogel
et al. [29].

Versatility and domain age
We examined whether domains that originated early in
life history have a higher number of neighbours, as predicted by the random evolution model. To get a rough
estimate of the relationship between the age of a domain
and its properties, we have adopted a simplified version of
the approach described by Wang et. al [33] and divided
domains into three groups: "old", "middle" and "new"
based on their taxonomic spread. "Old" domains are
present in all kingdoms; "middle" are common for all lineages in either of the Eukaryota, Archea or Bacteria and
"new" are specific to one lineage within these groups (e.g.
in Metazoa only).

We wanted, however, to know, whether older domains are
intrinsically more versatile than younger domains. Specifically, we ask whether domains that originated at the root
of the tree of life have a significantly different DV I from
domains that originated later. We did not find any significant differences (p = 0.16 in a one-way ANOVA). Since
the domains that are specific to a clade are generally
younger than domains spread throughout the tree of life,
this finding shows that the average DV I does not depend
on the age of a domain (Fig. 4). This means that domains
arising at any time during the evolution have the same
chance of becoming versatile.

For example, domain PF00001 (a transmembrane receptor from the rhodopsin family) is found in all domains of
life, while the Kringle domain (PF00051) can be found
only in the eukaryotes. While the former would be
defined as 'old,' the latter would be defined as 'new' and
nodes in-between as 'middle.' Indeed, domains that originated early have, on average, a higher number of neighbours. For example, domains that are found in all main
three life forms (Bacteria, Archea and Eukaryota) have on
average 12.51 neighbours, while the respective values for
Eukaryota and Metazoa are 5.72 and 3.69. This does not
mean that all ancient domains are very widely spread or
have a high number of neighbours. In fact, the variance of
these properties also increases with domain age, and thus
there are domains that probably are very ancient, but do
not form many combinations. For example, the RNA
polymerase domain PF04983 occurs in many clades altogether 89 times, but has only 9 different neighbours.
However, we expect that truly versatile domains should
have equal chance of arising during the course evolution.
That is, a young domain that recently appeared can also be
versatile, albeit in a limited clade. For example, a novel
transcription related domain that recently evolved in
mammals is not expected to be different in its ability to
form new domain combinations from a domain shared
throughout the tree of life, although it will not have yet as
many connections formed. Given the random model, the
number of connections is a function of time, however not
necessarily dependent on an inherent property different
in older and in younger domains. We observe a strong correlation between the age of a domain and its observed
number of occurrences, as well as the number of neighbours (p < 10-15 in a one-way ANOVA for three age categories). Therefore, older domains seem to be more
promiscuous if measured using previously described units
of promiscuity such as the NN or NCO. This is possibly

We further asked whether the domain versatility differed
significantly between Bacteria, Eukaryotes and Archea. We
expected that due to the fact that eukaryotic proteins tend
to contain more domains, the versatility in eukaryotic
proteins will be higher. To test this hypothesis, for each of
the genomes in one of the three forms of life (Bacteria,
Archea and Eukaryota) we calculated the average DV I of
all domains that are contained in that genome.
We find a small, but statistically highly significant difference between prokaryotic (bacterial and archeal) and
eukaryotic genomes. The average DV I for bacterial,
archeal and eukaryotic genomes were, respectively, 0.64 ±
0.0003, 0.65 ± 0.0012, and 0.58 ± 0.0002. Thus eukaryotic domains tend to be even slightly less versatile, although
though they may form, on average, more connections in a
domain co-occurrence network than a prokaryotic
domain. This is in contrast with previously reported findings based on domain versatility measures correlated with
domain abundance [12]. There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, it may be that the apparent decrease in DVI corresponds to a higher rate of gene
expansion by gene and genome duplications. We have
tested this by correcting the DVI by gene expansion
through removal of redundant domain arrangements and
found that results are robust. A second possibility is based
on the fact that eukaryotic proteins have, on average, more
domains than prokaryotic protein. Furthermore, it has
been previously reported that domain rearrangements
most frequently involve protein termini [18]. Since in
Eukaryota, there are proportionally fewer terminal
domains and since the non-terminal domains are less
likely to acquire new neighbors, on the average, an
eukaryotic domain will form fewer connections (acquire
new neighbors) than expected from its abundance, and
therefore has a relatively low DV I. On the same hand, due
to the larger genomes and gene expansion in Eukaryotes,
domains are more abundant and domain rearrangements

The relationship between the DVI, domain position and domain age
The relationship between the DVI, domain position and domain age. Left: Domain age and the DV I. OLD – domains
that are common to all three main branches of life (Bacteria, Archea, Eukaryota); MID – domains that are present in all taxons
of one of these branches (e.g. domains that can be found only in Bacteria, but not in Archea or Eukaryota); NEW – domains
that are present only in one subgroup of one of these branches (e.g. domains that occur only in vertebrates). Right: DV I and

domains or more; MID – all remaining (non-terminal) domains; SINGLE – domains in single-domain proteins. On the y axis,

more frequent in terms of absolute numbers. This makes
the domains appear more versatile if one applies one of
the measures of promiscuity that is correlated with
domain abundance.
Correlations between DVI and arrangements properties of domains
It has been shown that domain rearrangement events very
often involve whole terminal fragments [17,34,35]. Such
rearrangement events, which are predominantly protein
fusion and fission events [16,36], very often involve single
domain proteins that are fused to or split from another
protein. We observed that domains which also occur as
single-domain proteins have, on average, a higher DV I
(0.62 ± 0.01 vs 0.53 ± 0.01; p < 10-7 in a two-tailed t-test
with equal variances). We further supported this finding
as follows. For a given domain, we considered all proteins
in SwissPfam that contain this domain, and calculated the
fraction of single-domain proteins (that is, fraction of proteins in SwissProt that harbour only this given domain).
The proportion of single-domain proteins is correlated
with the DV I of the domains (Pearson r = 0.25, p < 10-5).
Therefore, if a domain occurs frequently as a single
domain protein, it is likely to have a high DV I.

Some domains may be more prone to be rearranged by a
specific genomic mechanism. For example, retrotransposons are abundant in many eukaryotic genomes and
may play a condsiderable role in their evolution [37-40].
It has be suggested that retrotransposons may promote
recombination [37,41,42] and thus may also have an
impact on domain rearrangements in turn facilitating a
higher DV I. To test whether domains that are included in
retrotransposition events tend to have a higher DV I, we
used the LTR detection method described by Rho et al.
[43]. We scanned genomic DNA from Mus musculus for
long terminal repeats, translated the nucleic acid sequence
flanked by LTRs into all six reading frames and detected
Pfam A domains by running HMMPFAM from the
HMMER package [44] against Pfam A HMM models.
Using an E-value cut-off of 10-5 and removing common
viral domains such as Transposases, RVTs or Gag-related
domains, ~180 mostly non-viral domains were obtained.
We were able to calculate the DV I for 53 domains, but did
not detect any significant difference between domains
found within LTR boundaries and other 'non-LTR'
domains.

Previously, we have shown that domains in terminal
indels differ with respect to their number of neighbours
from domains found on non-terminal positions. We now
asked, whether domains found at the termini are more
often partaking in fusion/fission events simply because
they are more abundant, or whether they tend to be more
versatile. We found that the latter is the case. The average
DV I for terminal domains is 0.61 as opposed to 0.49 for
the non-terminal domains (p < 10-15 for a one-way
ANOVA). This means that, on average, terminal domains
are more versatile.
DVI and intrinsic domain properties
Furthermore, the DV I correlates with average length of a
domain: longer domains have a higher DV I (r = 0.25, p <
10-6). This is in variance with previous investigations,
which were based on other versatility measures such as the
number of triplets (NTRP) formed [12]. We interpret this
contradiction as follows. Number of triplets correlates
strongly with domain abundance (N). It is therefore possible that domain length primarily correlates with domain
abundance. Indeed, we see a statistically significant, negative correlation between the number of occurrences of a
domain and the domain length (r = -0.14, p = 0.005). We
also explored the link between domain structure and versatility, but did not find any correlation.
DVI and domain function
Next, we asked what the functional properties of domains
with different DVI values are. A manual investigation of
the domain functions has shown that domains with low
DV I are very often repeats. Note that the combinatorial
effect of the repeats (that is, that several occurrences of a
domain in a row give a high number of occurrences and a
very low number of neighbours) have been accounted for
as described in the previous section.

Among the domains with the highest DV I (see supplementary table 1) there are several domains that bind to
various nucleotides such as DNA, RNA and ATP binding
domains. For example, we find several Zinc finger
domains, the PAS fold or the Helicase domain. On the
other hand, among the domains with low DV I we see
numerous structural domains and domain repeats, such
as the cap region of the leucine rich repeat (LRRNT), collagen triple helix (Collagen) or the Ankyrin repeat (ANK).
We wanted to know whether these observations can be
quantified and if they are statistically significant.
To quantitatively test the differences, we analysed the GO
terms that are associated with different domains. A GO
term was associated with a domain, if it was shared by all
proteins containing the given domain, as defined in the
Interpro database [45]. We calculated the average DV I for
different GO terms and compared them using analysis of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/285

variance (ANOVA). We were not able to find any significant differences in average DV I between the different GO
terms.
Since the calculation of a DV I is limited to domains that
occur in multiple instances in several genomes, only a
small fraction of Pfam A domains could be associated
with a DV I. To alleviate this problem we calculated the
DV I for the 263 Pfam clans. For example, instead of calculating the DV I separately for SH3_1, SH3_2, SH3_3,
SH3_4 and SH3_5 domains, we treated each occurrence of
such a domain as the occurrence of its respective clan ID
"CL0010". In summary, we were able to calculate the DV
I for 115 clans. Furthermore, we calculated the average DV
I of Pfam domains that belong to a given Pfam clans and
found that both measures are significantly correlated (r =
0.6, p < 10-12). While the latter (averaging DV I over members of Pfam clan) seems to be a more straightforward
approach, the former (substituting domain names in
SwissPfam by the respective Pfam clan IDs) allows a calculation of the DV I for a larger number of Pfam clans. We
see that, for most of the Pfam clans, the correlation
between N and NN is equally strong as for Pfam domains
(see supplementary material).
We further repeated the GO analysis for Pfam clans.
Again, we do not find a clear connection between the GO
functions associated with a Pfam clan and the calculated
DV I.
While we could see that protein domains from the same
Pfam clan do indeed have similar DV I values, we were not
able to show that domains that have either a low or a high
DV I have a particular functional assignment, i.e. common GO annotations. Potentially, there could be a problem with the way GO annotations are assigned to proteins
and protein domains; for example, automatically assigning GO terms to a domain by taking over the GO terms of
the proteins that share the given domain may introduce a
systematic error. On the other hand, there is maybe no
general functional link between protein domain versatility and its function (e.g. some transcription factors are
specialised and non-versatile whereas some others are versatile).

Conclusion
The idea that some domains can more easily form new
domain combinations than others is very intriguing. It is
consistent with a model of protein evolution in which
proteins with new functionality arise by combining functional units. A frequently used metaphor is the one of
Lego blocks: complex proteins can be created by combining existing blocks of a simpler function. Just like the idea
that new genes can be invented by neo- or subfunctionalisation [46,47], this perspective could shift the view we

have on protein evolution. The arising of complex features
can often be explained more easily from the perspective of
modular evolution than using the classical models of
molecular evolution such as evolution by point mutations. It is therefore not surprising that several investigations emphasize the concept of domain versatility or
promiscuity.
We show that the previously used measures of promiscuity are coupled to the frequency of a domain in a genome.
Therefore, to understand the principles of domain-wise
modular evolution, one needs to disentangle these concepts and decouple the promiscuity of a domain from the
frequency with which it occurs.
We have found a new measure, the domain versatility
index (DV I), for what can be truly considered the versatility of a domain and have shown that this measure does
not correlate with domain abundance or age. We have
shown that this measure has properties expected from a
measure of domain versatility. We find that domains that
form single domain proteins or that occur at protein termini (where rearrangements occur frequently) have all a
higher than average DV I. We also show that domain versatility, as expected for an intrinsic property, is not related
to domain age. Furthermore, contrary to findings based
on abundance-related versatility measures, we could not
observe that eukaryotic domains are significantly more
versatile. Also, we could not correlate the versatility with
protein function or retrotransposition. We suggest followup studies should further consider the issue of linking DVI
to the phylogenetic history of proteins, explaining when
the proteins acquire new domain combinations and how
the new combinations formed relate to the DV I.

Methods
Databases used and dataset preparation
We used SwissPfam from the Pfam database version 21 as
of 2006 [10]. The SwissPfam set of protein arrangements
was divided into files, each corresponding to one organism. In total, 10,746 species were included in the analysis.
The files were converted to XDOM [48] format and can be
downloaded from our web site. Interpro version 14 [45]
was used to obtain GO annotations of Pfam domains. The
mouse genome (NCBI m36) was obtained from the
Ensembl [49] website. All supplementary material is available online at: http://iebservices.uni-muenster.de/supp
mat/DVI/.
Calculation of versatility parameters
Calculation of the direct indices of domain versatility
We calculated the following previously described indices
of domain versatility: number of co-occurrences (NCO;
[29]), number of direct neighbours (NN) and number of triplets (NTRP; [12]). For each domain, we calculated the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/285

number of co-occurrences as follows. For a given domain,
all proteins containing this domain were identified. NCO
is the total number of different domains in these proteins
minus one. Number of immediate neighbours was calculated as the number of different domains that occur
directly at the N- or C-terminus of the given domain. If a
domain was found at a terminus, the number of neighbors was increased by one (terminal position of a domain
was considered to be a valid domain combination). Triplets are defined as unique combinations of either: three
domains, with the given domain in the middle, two
domains and a letter if the domain occurs at either N- or
C-terminus (e.g. N-PF00001–PF00002 means that the
given domain PF00001 occurs at the N-terminus of the
protein) or three letters, if the domain occurs in a single
domain protein (e.g. N-PF00001-C). We calculated the
number of triplets as the number of unique triplet combination in which a domain occurs. These calculations were
done for all domains in the data set.
DVI calculation
We calculated the domain versatility index (DV I) as follows. For each domain, we considered the number of
occurrences (N) of this domain in a genome as well as the
number of immediate neighbours (NN). We define DV I
as the coefficient of logarithmic regression of NN over N
with its respective error.

Furthermore, we calculated and compared both, logarithmic and linear regression coefficient of NCO, NN and
NTRP over N. We have chosen the logarithmic regression
coefficient for further analysis, because it follows the logarithmic model of Vogel et al. [29]. The DV I has been
computed in R using the following models: NN = a log(N)
+ b for logarythmic regression and NN = aN + b for linear
regresion (N – number of occurences, NN – number of
neighbors, a and b – regression coefficients). The DV I was
then defined as the a coefficient from the regression
model.
To correct for domain expansion, we have removed
domain repeats from the data set. Similarily, to correct for
gene expansion, we have removed identical domain
arrangements from the data set.
To test whether the use of SwissPfam introduces a significant bias to the observed data, we have recalculated the
DVI using proteins from 749 full Eukaryotic, Bacterial and
Archeal genomes from the Integr8 database, release 84
([50]; see supplementary materials for the full data set).
Overlapping domains were removed, with PFAM
domains given precedence over other annotations. In this
data set we obtained DVIs for 980 domains, including 727
Pfam A domains. These DVI values correlate significantly

Page 12 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:285

with the values obtained for the SwissPfam data set (r =
0.91, p < 10-15).
To compare different approaches for the DVI calculation
and the index described in [32], we used the R2 statistic to
evaluate the goodness of fit for each domain and for different models applied. The equation used by Basu et al.
[32] corresponds to a model given by the equation NN
log(NN) = log(N); consequently, we define NN' = NN
log(NN) and use the following regression model in R:
NN' = a log(N) + b. We have calculated the average
R2value for each of the three models applied.
DVI for domains of different age
We defined three classes of domains. "OLD" – domains
that are common to all three main branches of life (Bacteria, Archea, Eukaryota); "MID" – domains that are present
in all taxons of one of these branches (e.g. domains that
can be found only in Bacteria, but not in Archea or
Eukaryota); "NEW" – domains that are present only in
one subgroup of one of these branches (e.g. domains that
occur only in Metazoa). The parameters (DV I, N, NCO,
NN, NTRP) were calculated for these three groups and the
significance of differences analysed with a one-way
ANOVA.
Analysis of Pfam CLANs
We calculated the DV I for Pfam clans using two methods.
First, we calculated it as the average DV I of all the Pfam
domains belonging to a clan for which a DV I could be
obtained. Next, we modified the XDOM files by replacing
each domain by its corresponding clan ID, and calculated
the DV I as previously described for Pfam domains.
Domains that do not have a CLANs assignment were
retained.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, the R package [51] in the version
2.4.1 was used. For correlations, Pearson r correlation
coefficient and Spearman rank correlation coefficient
were used where appropriate. Principal component analysis of the different measures of versatility was done using
the princomp method from the R package.
