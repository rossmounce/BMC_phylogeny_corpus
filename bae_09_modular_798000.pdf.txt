Abstract
Background: Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (PHGPx), the most abundant isoforms of
GPx families, interfere directly with hydroperoxidation of lipids. Biochemical properties of these proteins vary
along with their donor organisms, which has complicated the phylogenetic classification of diverse PHGPx-like
proteins. Despite efforts for comprehensive analyses, the evolutionary aspects of GPx genes in invertebrates
remain largely unknown.
Results: We isolated GPx homologs via in silico screening of genomic and/or expressed sequence tag databases
of eukaryotic organisms including protostomian species. Genes showing strong similarity to the mammalian
PHGPx genes were commonly found in all genomes examined. GPx3- and GPx7-like genes were additionally
detected from nematodes and platyhelminths, respectively. The overall distribution of the PHGPx-like proteins
with different biochemical properties was biased across taxa; selenium- and glutathione (GSH)-dependent
proteins were exclusively detected in platyhelminth and deuterostomian species, whereas selenium-independent
and thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent enzymes were isolated in the other taxa. In comparison of genomic
organization, the GSH-dependent PHGPx genes showed a conserved architectural pattern, while their Trxdependent counterparts displayed complex exon-intron structures. A codon for the resolving Cys engaged in
reductant binding was found to be substituted in a series of genes. Selection pressure to maintain the
selenocysteine codon in GSH-dependent genes also appeared to be relaxed during their evolution. With the
dichotomized fashion in genomic organizations, a highly polytomic topology of their phylogenetic trees implied
that the GPx genes have multiple evolutionary intermediate forms.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of invertebrate GPx genes provides informative evidence to support the
modular pathways of GPx evolution, which have been accompanied with sporadic expansion/deletion and exonintron remodeling. The differentiated enzymatic properties might be acquired by the evolutionary relaxation of
selection pressure and/or biochemical adaptation to the acting environments. Our present study would be
beneficial to get detailed insights into the complex GPx evolution, and to understand the molecular basis of the
specialized physiological implications of this antioxidant system in their respective donor organisms.

Background
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated through an
incomplete reduction of oxygen molecules during mitochondrial respiration and/or cytosolic metabolism. Exposure to exogenous stimuli such as radiation and redoxcycling drugs might be an alternative pathway of ROS production. ROS perform physiological roles relevant to cell
signaling and redox-status control [1,2], while unbalanced generation of these species induces detrimental oxidation of macromolecules including DNA, proteins, and
lipids. To minimize ROS-derived damage, aerobic organisms have evolved a series of multi-layered enzymatic and
non-enzymatic defense systems [3]. Distinct enzymatic
activities such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx),
and peroxiredoxin (PRx; also called thioredoxin peroxidase) have been well characterized from numerous taxa,
as the major antioxidant defense mechanism.
Selenium-containing GPx proteins reduce H2O2 and
organic hydroperoxides by employing glutathione (GSH)
as an electron donor. A total of eight GPx families have
been described in mammals on the basis of primary structure, specific substrate accessibility, and spatial expression
[4,5]. These homotetrameric isoenzymes conserve structural/biochemical properties, however, a number of
enzymes that have been classified into GPx4 (phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx; PHGPx) may function in monomeric forms and exhibit unique substrate availability. The
enzymes can interfere directly with hydroperoxidized
phospholipids in biomembranes. Proteins belonging to
the other GPx families display substrate preference toward
H2O2and protect against lipid peroxidation via a concerted operation with phospholipase [6]. PHGPx is the
basis of a principal defense system that intimately participates in the repair of disrupted biomembranes [7]. The
vertebrate-specific GPx7 and GPx8 also lack the oligomerization loop, although their unique enzymatic properties
are less understood [5].
Multiple isoenzymes showing primary structure similar to
those of the mammalian PHGPxs have been described in
plants, along with their respective subcellular expression
profiles [8,9]. Plant enzymes possess a Cys residue instead
of a selenocysteine (Sec) at the catalytic site, and prefer
thioredoxin (Trx) as the electron source [9-11]. A pair of
PHGPx-like proteins that effectively reduce the peroxides
by adapting the Trx system has also been isolated from
insect, yeast, and protozoa [12-15]. Interestingly, the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was likely to express
both GHS-dependent (CrGPx1 and CrGPx2) and Trxdependent (CrGPx3–5) GPxs [16]. These observations
have created a controversy regarding the classification of
PHGPx-like proteins [8,9]. Conventional cladistic analyses based on comparison of primary structures generally
annotate these proteins as PHGPxs, prior to empirical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/72

examination of their catalytic mechanisms (for example,
see [17]). It has been suggested that the Trx-dependent
GPxs comprise the fifth class of the PRx family, on the
basis of their biochemical properties rather than their
phylogenetic affinity [8,9]. Conversely, a novel functional
class of 'Trx GPx-like peroxidase (TGPx)' has been proposed to clarify the unique GPx group sharing a common
evolutionary origin with the GSH-dependent GPxs [5].
The molecular basis for the differential preference has also
been investigated and appeared to involve a 'resolving
Cys' within the α2 helix of the Trx-dependent GPxs
[5,18,19].
With the accumulation of genomic databases, it has been
possible to analyze homologous genes from diverse taxonomical groups. In this context, the evolutionary relationships among the eight GPx families including the complex
PHGPx-like proteins were comprehensively examined
[5,20]. The proteins isolated from all metazoan species
were clearly separated from those of fungi/algae/prokaryotes and plants, and some of algal proteins were dispersed
in a distinct group together with the Kinetoplastida GPxs
[20]. These analyses demonstrate that PHGPx-like proteins are the most abundant type found in almost all aerobic organisms and considered as an ancestral form of the
GPx superfamily [20]. The common ancestor appears to
have diverged into GPx7/8 and GPx1/2/3/5/6 groups after
being duplicated in the vertebrate lineage [5,20]. The
highly polytomic relationships suggest parallel evolutionary pathways for the GPx families following duplication
events in the early stage of GPx evolution. Lateral gene
transfer has also been introduced as a relevant mechanism
for the presence of GPx3-like genes in parasitic nematodes
[5]. However, the evolutionary aspects of GPx genes isolated from invertebrates have not yet been fully investigated. The evolutionary relationship between GSH- and
Trx-dependent GPxs also remains largely unclear.
Recent molecular phylogeny has positioned the Platyhelminthes into Lophotrochozoa, which forms a monophyletic clade Protostomia with the Ecdysozoa [21,22].
The phylum is composed of markedly diverse species,
most of which have established a parasitic life mode
within specific host organisms. The tissue-invasive parasites are continuously exposed to oxidative stresses generated by both endogenous and exogenous ROS, which are
generated by host immune cells [23,24]. Therefore, parasitic nematodes and platyhelminths might provide good
models for the investigation of biochemical and physiological diversification of antioxidant enzymes. Together
with the Trx system, GSH-dependent proteins perform
central roles in the thiol-disulfide redox homeostasis in
these parasites by providing electrons to essential
enzymes and by protecting against oxidative stress
[25,26]. GPxs homologous to the mammalian plasma

GPx (GPx3) and PHGPx have been characterized only
from a few filarial nematodes and trematodes, respectively [25,27,28].
The trematode GPxs seem to play specialized roles in their
unique biotic environments, in association with sexual
reproduction [28,29]. In the present study, we isolated
GPx genes in lower animals, especially in platyhelminths
and nematodes, and investigated their evolutionary
aspects. Almost all of the platyhelminth genes examined
displayed a strikingly close relationship to the mammalian PHGPx genes. In addition to the previously described
GPx3-like genes, vertebrate-type PHGPx genes were also
identified in nematodes. Comparative analyses further
indicated that the GPx7 family, which has been known to
be specific to vertebrates, already diverged in the Lophotrochozoa, although the gene lineage seems to have been
deleted in most of the lower animal genomes. At structural and functional levels, the GSH-dependent platyhelminth and nematode PHGPx-like genes appear to
share an evolutionary progenitor with the deuterostomian
homologs. The Trx-dependent GPx genes found in the
other ecdysozoans may have modularly evolved from
another paralogous gene duplicated in a common metazoan/plant ancestor.

Results
Isolation of platyhelminth genes encoding GPx
The GPx genes were isolated from various platyhelminths
via in silico screening of their respective genomic/
expressed sequence tag (EST) databases (Figure 1). Our

westermani adults detected two genes encoding GPx-like
proteins (PwGPx1 [GenBank: ABE68811] and PwGPx2
[GenBank: ABE68812]). The Paragonimus proteins
revealed significant identities to GPx proteins including
those of Schistosoma mansoni [GenBank: AAU34080,
AAC14468]. BLAST searches with these GPx sequences
retrieved two homologs from the S. japonicum EST database (97,525 ESTs in the GenBank [CV689936,
AY223160]), and one from each of the S. haematobium
(15,000 ESTs; Shaem32f07.q1k, ShGPx1) and Fasciola
hepatica databases (15,000 ESTs; Fhep45e11.q1k,
FhGPx1) at the Sanger Institute. Screening of the genomic
databases for S. mansoni (assembly ver. 3.0) and S. japonicum (ver. 2.0) revealed that schistosomes possess only two
GPx genes corresponded to each of the mRNA sequences
(see also [27]). The EST (73,587 entries) and genomic
databases (ver. 3.1) of Schmidtea mediterranea (Class Turbellaria) contained three paralogous GPx genes
(DN292195/DN303738 for SmedGPx1, DN310389 for
SmedGPx2, and DN312778 for SmedGPx3). A GPx gene
(EGPSgr-5h09.q1k, EgGPx1) was also found in the EST
database of a parasitic cestode Echinococcus granulosus
(15,000 ESTs). Searches using human [GenBank:
CAA68491, AAP50261] and nematode [GenBank:
CAA48882] GPx1/3 lineages showed similar results,
although the E-values were moderately increased from <3
× 10-23 to <6 × 10-16. The BLAST results were supported by
the subsequent analyses for the detection of functional
domain(s) conserved in these proteins, based on Hidden
Markov Models (InterPro IPR000889 family).
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of platyhelminth
GPx genes
The majority of the platyhelminth genes isolated in this
study encoded a Sec-dependent GPx, as predicted by the
detection of a second in-frame TGA codon and a concurrent Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) motif within their 3'untranslated region (UTR) [27,30]. The motifs conserved
the unique secondary structure comprising two helices
separated by an internal loop, a SECIS core structure, a
quartet located at the base of the second helix, and an apical loop; these were equivalent to those of the mammalian homologs (Figure 2) [31]. The quartets of nonWatson-Crick base pairs were class I (ATGA_AA_GA) in
these platyhelminth genes, as were the cases in the mammalian selenoprotein genes. Exceptionally, SjGPx1 contained a quartet pattern of class II (GTGA_AA_GA). In
contrast, PwGPx1 contained a standard codon for Cys
(TGC) rather than the Sec codon and the SECIS was not
detected within its nucleotide sequence.

The polypeptides encoded by the platyhelminth GPx
genes showed a broad range of sequence identity either to
one another or to the other eukaryotic PHGPx-like pro-

reproduction-related cells such as vitellocytes [27-29].
Exogenous oxidative chemicals including paraquat,
juglone, and H2O2also induced the trematode genes in a
dose-dependent manner [27,28]. PwGPx genes exhibited
expression patterns identical to those of the Schistosoma
and Clonorchis orthologs, as was evident in RT-PCR and
immunohistochemical analyses (unpublished data). The
enzymatic activity was not detected in the metacestode
stage of E. granulosus [34], even though an mRNA
sequence (EgGPx1) was isolated from the larval stage. We
could not currently trace any empirical data demonstrating expression profiles of the antioxidant enzymes in Turbellaria. Given the sexual reproduction mechanism
conserved in these platyhelminths [35-37], the planarian
genes might have an expression pattern similar to that of
the trematode genes.

teins (21–87%). The N-terminal amino acid (aa) extension was hydrophobic in a major fraction of the
trematode and planarian proteins (underlined sequences
in Additional file 1), while such sequences were not
detected in SmGPx1, SjGPx1, and ShGPx1. The presence/
absence of the leader sequences would be responsible for
the expression of differentially targeted proteins, as was
evidenced in the mitochondrial/non-mitochondrial variants of mammalian PHGPxs [32]. The active Cys, Gln, and
Trp residues, which participate in the formation of the catalytic-site geometry, were well conserved at their corresponding positions, although the thiol-containing Cys
was exclusively replaced by Sec in the platyhelminth and
mammalian GPxs (T-1, -2, and -3 in Additional file 1)
[19,33]. The Gln and Trp residues were replaced by Met/
Leu and Tyr in the Paragonimus proteins. The other functional aa involved in the stabilization of the active site,
were also detected in their primary structures (C-1 [Asn], 2 [Cys], and -3 [Asn]). The Cys residue, which is pivotal in
the interaction of Trx-dependent GPx with Trx, could not
be defined in the platyhelminth proteins, as well as in the
nematode and mammalian PHGPxs [5,18]. These lower
animal GPxs lacked the subunit-interacting domain and
PGGG motif found in the tetramer-forming GPxs.
Expression profiles and preferential electron donor
In trematode parasites, the expression of various GPx
genes increased in proportion to the development of
donor organisms and showed a specific locality within

The substrate specificity of schistosome GPxs was likely to
be similar to those of mammalian PHGPxs [38], and the
Cys motif found in the Trx-dependent GPxs was not
detected in the primary structures of platyhelminth proteins analyzed in this study (Additional file 1). The preferential affinity toward electron donors has not been
determined empirically with any of the platyhelminth
GPx proteins including the well characterized Schistosoma
and Clonorchis enzymes. We examined the catalytic efficiency with the native GPxs partially purified from adult
P. westermani (Figure 3). The enzymes effectively reduced
H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide using GSH as an electron donor. The proteins also showed considerable reactivity with Trx, while these activities were lower than those
with GSH (15.4–39.4%). The specific activity of GPx proteins decreases dramatically in the range of several tens to
several hundred, when provided by an alternative reductant, rather than their preferential electron donor (see [18]
and references therein). Therefore, it is possible that the
purified Paragonimus proteins might have been contaminated with PRxs, although we examined the samples with
the Clonorchis sinensis PRx-specific antibodies, which were
highly cross-reactive against P. westermani PRxs (Figure
3A). Regardless of this possibility, however, these observations collectively suggest that the trematode GPxs exhibit
a catalytic pattern identical to that of the mammalian
PHGPx proteins.
Phylogenetic analysis of GPx gene families
In addition to the platyhelminth proteins, we retrieved
several hundred GPx-like proteins either from the nonredundant GenBank or organism-specific databases
(sequence identity: 35–53%, E-values < 10-16). Proteins
with primary structures similar to those of mammalian
PHGPxs were found in all major taxa including plants,
bacteria, protozoans, fungi, algae, invertebrates, and vertebrates. GPx3-like proteins, which had been likely to be

inferred from the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model
were not significantly different between the PHGPx- and
GPx1/3-like groups (P = 0.053; Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
test), although the values were highly variable: 0.33–2.37
in the PHGPx-like groups versus 0.31–0.55 in the GPx1/3
groups (bold-face values in Table 1). At the inter-group
level, the rates of divergence between a pair of PHGPx and
GPx1/3 group were considerably higher than those
between a pair of the same GPx family (Table 1). These
results suggest that each of the GPx families has diverged
during similar evolutionary times and that the GPx3-like
proteins are endogenous in nematodes, rather than having originated by lateral gene transfer. To verify these
views, we performed in-depth phylogenetic analyses.

Biochemical properties of the native PwGPx1 and PwGPx2
Biochemical properties of the native PwGPx1 and
PwGPx2 proteins. (A) The partially purified PwGPxs were
resolved by 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE (15%, pH 3-10) and
transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were
reacted with the PwGPx-specific mouse antisera (1:2,000
dilutions). One-dimensional blots with PwGPxs (10 μg) and
whole protein extracts (40 μg) of Paragonimus westermani
(Pw-CE) and Clonorchis sinensis (Cs-CE) were also examined
with a pooled mouse antiserum against C. sinensis PRx1 and
PRx2 (1: 1,000 dilutions; our unpublished data). (B) The specificity and catalytic efficiency of the proteins purified by a
series of gel chromatographies were examined toward catalytic substrates (H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide [CHP])
and electron donors (glutathione [GSH] and thioredoxin
[Trx]), respectively. The concentrations of GSH and Trx
added in the reactions were empirically determined to
ensure that the reductants are saturated. The absorbance
values of experimental groups were substracted with those
of reactions without PwGPxs. The reactions were performed
in triplicate and the specific activities in μmol/min/mg were

vertebrate-specific, were further found in nematode and
tunicate species. The nematode GPx3-like proteins are
proposed to have originated from vertebrate hosts by lateral gene transfer [20]. However, the presence of GPx3like proteins in a tunicate, which has not been described
previously, implies that the hypothesis of horizontal gene
transfer from vertebrate(s) to nematode(s) needs to be reexamined.
The sequences of 105 proteins were selected for cladistic
analyses (Additional file 2). Intra-group divergences

The PHGPx-like proteins exhibited a highly polytomic
clustering pattern in a maximum likelihood tree constructed by the quart puzzling method of TREE_PUZZLE
(Figure 4, the NEWICK-format tree is attached as Additional file 3). The phyletic GPx3-lineage members comprised another polytomic clade. A portion of the
orthologous PHGPxs were clustered into well-separated
focal clades, in accordance with the taxonomical positions
of their donor organisms. The GPx7 and GPx8 proteins,
which have been recently detected in vertebrate species,
positioned into each of the distinct clades. In protostomians examined, only nematode species harbored the GPx3like proteins. The neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony trees showed topologies similar to that of the maximum likelihood tree (Additional file 4). The groupspecific clustering of PHGPxs was much more substantial
in the neighbor-joining tree, albeit the statistical significance of some branching nodes could not be supported by
bootstrap analyses. The neighbor-joining tree demonstrated that the GPx7 and GPx8 proteins have diverged
from each other after being duplicated in vertebrates.
More interestingly, two proteins in S. mediterranea
(SmedGPx1)
and
C.
intestinalis
[GenBank:
XP_002128643] showed a closer relationship with the
vertebrate GPx7/8 lineages. Since the planarian is believed
to have maintained its free-living life mode, the lineage
members might also have endogenously evolved in the
protostomian stage. The members seem to have been
deleted in the other protostomian species selected in this
study.
The Trx-dependent GPxs with the resolving Cys were
largely scattered in plants, algae, protozoans, and insects
(marked with ‡ in Figure 4 and Additional file 4), while
the Cys residue was substituted by another aa in some of
the alga and insect proteins. Conversely, the Sec codon
and the associated SECIS motif were recognized as being
largely confined to the mRNA sequences of the GSHdependent lophotrochozoan, ascidian, and vertebrate

members (indicated by ‡ in Figure 4). Among the ecdysozoans examined, only an arachnidal tick, Boophilus
microplus, was found to express the Sec-dependent
PHGPx protein [GenBank: ABA25916]. The C. reinhardtii
[GenBank: AAL14348] and Hydra vulgaris [GenBank:
ABC25026] proteins also contained Sec in their primary
structures. The GPx7/8-like proteins found in S. mediterranea and C. intestinalis were selenium-independent,
consistent with vertebrate proteins [5]. However, the evolutionary events resulting in these biased distributions of
proteins with different biochemical properties could not
be clearly addressed in the phylogenetic analysis.
Exon-intron structures of PHGPx homologs
The polytomic phylogeny of PHGPxs suggested that these
proteins have evolved in a modular fashion from multiple
genes, while informative diagnostic substitutions could
not be detected between the dichotomized GSH- and Trxdependent proteins, except for the resolving Cys in the
major Trx-dependent GPxs (Additional file 2). We examined the presence of orthologous introns in the PHGPx
homologs to trace their evolutionary pathways in details.
The genomic organizations were predicted by comparing
each of the mRNA sequences with its corresponding chromosomal sequence isolated either from DNA databases
(Figure 1) or by PCR amplification (PwGPxs [GenBank:
DQ454159, DQ454160]). The numbers of intron were
highly variable in the diverse PHGPx genes, with a gross
tendency to increase along with the taxonomical positions
of donor organisms (Figures 5 and 6). The genes from
free-living nematodes, vertebrates, and plants were split
into three, seven, and six exons, respectively. Meanwhile,

insect genes displayed highly complicated exon-intron
structures with different intron numbers from one to
three. Interestingly, the platyhelminth genes displayed an
organization pattern comparable to that of mammalian
orthologs. A gene isolated from a parasitic nematode Brugia malayi was more complex than those of free-living
nematodes.
The preservative organization patterns were analyzed by
comparing the position of each intron in relation to the aa
alignment and their phases. The phases and positions of
the respective introns were also conserved in the taxonspecific gene groups. Among the groups, however, orthologous introns shared in the evolutionary terms could be
detected on the basis of the biochemical properties of
their encoded proteins. The introns were tightly conserved
between the Sec- and GSH-dependent platyhelminth and
vertebrate genes, except for one intron that was specifically integrated into the vertebrate orthologs. The first
intron of Caenorhabditis genes was matched to the second
one identified in these common decedents. Two introns
of the Brugia gene were found to be orthologous to the
platyhelminth and vertebrate introns (Figure 5A). The
GPx7/8-like genes of S. mediterranea and C. intestinalis, as
proposed in the phylogenetic analysis, displayed a different intron conservation pattern (Figure 5B). The exonintron architecture of the tunicate gene was identical to
those of vertebrate GPx7 and GPx8 genes, and the turbellaria gene shared the last intron with them. The complex
insect genes, which encode proteins exhibiting strong
affinity to Trx, shared an intron with plant GPxs in a
dichotomized pattern (Insect I and II in Figure 6). In addi-

Discussion
tion to these clonal genes, GPx genes with unique exonintron structures were also retrieved from the insect
genomes (grouped into Insect III in Figure 6). The C. reinhardtii genome possessed genes with each of the unique
number and position of intervening intron, including the
gene encoding a Sec-dependent protein [GenBank:
AAL14348]. The architectural conservation patterns
showed weak relations to the presence of resolving Cys in
the insect and alga genes (genes containing the motif were
marked with § in Figure 6). The phyletic GPx1 and GPx3
members had their respective intron-sharing patterns in
the genomic structures, while those were clearly distinguished from the chromosomal organizations of PHGPx
members (Additional file 5).

In this study, we described a comparative analysis of GPx
genes including platyhelminth orthologs such as the
human lung fluke and freshwater planarian genes, for the
purpose of predicting their evolutionary pathways. The
GPx homologs displayed diversity in the copy number
among the eukaryotic species, which suggests that independent multiplication events have occurred in each of
the taxa. In nematodes and deuterostomians, a couple of
duplicated genes have diverged further into GPx1 and
GPx3 lineages, respectively, while all GPx paralogs have
preserved the structural properties similar to that of the
mammalian PHGPx genes in the other invertebrate
clades. A GPx7/8-like gene previously shown to be vertebrate-specific was isolated from the genomes of a tunicate
and turbellaria. The spatiotemporal expressions of GPx

were inducible by exogenous stimuli with the soluble
hydroperoxide and redox-cycling drugs, which can cross
cell boundaries and trigger the conversion of oxygen into
O2- [39]. The increased GPx activity against these chemicals seems to result indirectly from the accumulation of
H2O2 and/or lipid peroxidation within the target cells/
organs, due to O2- overproduction. Alternatively, their
responsiveness upon these stimuli could be a simple consequence of the coordinated regulation of phase I oxidative enzymes via the Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway
[40], given the fact that the specific role of trematode GPx
proteins is highly associated with sexual reproduction
[28,29].

Genomic organizations of thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent PHGPx genes. The chromosomal structures of insect
and plant genes that encode the Trx-dependent proteins
were compared to each other to detect orthologous introns.
The insect genes are categorized into three groups according
to their conservation patterns. The symbol § marks the gene
with the Cys motif in its encoded protein. More detail is presented in the legend to Figure 5.

genes were found to be specific to each of the duplicated
copies in plants and vertebrates, which demonstrate functional diversification among them [4,9]. However, the
trematode gene inductions were concentrated in the
reproduction-related vitellocytes contained within vitelline follicles and eggs. This fact might suggest that the
duplication events have been forced to increase genetic
redundancy and/or protein levels, rather than to increase
the size of isoenzyme pools with distinct tissue expression
profiles, at least in the trematode species.
The substrate specificity of GPx-like proteins has been
debatable not only because the parasitic nematode proteins are not enzymatically active toward H2O2 but also
because PHGPxs show a variation against diverse catalytic
substrates. The trematode PHGPxs reduced H2O2 much
more effectively than cumene hydroperoxide, as was
determined with the Paragonimus (Figure 3) and Schistosoma proteins [38], whereas plant homologs preferred the
organic peroxide [9]. Interestingly, the GSH-dependent
incapability of plant PHGPxs in reduction of H2O2 was
reversed when Trx was provided as an alternative electron
donor [10]. These results suggest that the GPx family
genes have functionally diverged according to the biochemistry of their action environments. The active site
geometry is modified in response to the binding of GSH
or Trx [33]. The vitellocyte-specific platyhelminth genes

The majority of the mammalian GPxs contain Sec at their
catalytic site, which is co-translationally inserted in
response to a UGA codon, the stop signal in the standard
genetic code. The alternative decoding of the opal codon
depends on a cis-factor (SECIS) located in the 3'-UTR of
selenoprotein genes [30]. In our analysis, the distribution
of selenium-dependent GPxs (sGPxs) was biased toward
platyhelminth and deuterostomian species, with a few
exceptions: proteins isolated from an annelid [GenBank:
ABA25916], alga [GenBank: AAL14348], and cnidarian
[GenBank: ABC25026]. Of the platyhelminth enzymes
obtainable, PwGPx1 and SmedGPx1 (GPx7-like protein)
were determined to be selenium-independent GPx
(siGPx). The Sec codon was replaced by a typical Cys
codon in the nematode homologs, although nematode
species also contained selenoproteins such as Trx reductase and/or SelK [41]. It has been suggested that siGPx proteins have emerged independently from sGPx
counterparts during evolution, in response to the
increased atmospheric oxygen concentration [16,42].
Conversely, a recent comparative analysis predicted the
progressive acquisition of Sec by Cys-based proteins in a
series of donor organisms [5]. The siGPx in protozoans,
fungi, and plants, and the biased distribution of sGPx
within a narrow range of taxonomical clades seems to
support the Cys-based evolutionary route of GPx proteins.
The highly conserved genomic architecture among Secdependent genes can be taken as evidence for the suggestion (Figure 5). siGPx has been postulated either to comprise a second-line defense or to cooperate with sGPx in as
yet-unknown and novel manner, to cope with cellular oxidative stresses [43]. In plants and lower animals, PRx constitutes a major antioxidant system against ROS-derived
damage and the platyhelminth GPx seems to be involved
in a specialized physiological function(s) [9,10,27,28].
Therefore, it is possible that siGPx carries out its role in a
specific microenvironment with an optimal pH for the
thiol group, along with the diversification of its donor
organism. The siGPxs of filarial nematodes, of which
functions are mainly confined to the cuticular matrix, may
provide another example of this suggestion [44]. The

induction level of PwGPx1 was higher than that of
PwGPx2 during the development of P. westermani and
against exogenous oxidative stresses, while their histological distributions were almost identical (data not shown).
Currently, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is
related to their differential reactivity or it is an indication
of functional and/or histological diversification within
each of their respective subcellular micro-niches.
Together with the selenium dependency, the categories of
GPx isoenzymes also revealed taxonomical biases along
with their donor organisms; the GPx3-like proteins were
detected exclusively in the deuterostomian and nematode
species, whereas those with a phylogenetic linkage to
PHGPx were ubiquitously isolated across taxa from plants
to vertebrates. Since the complete or draft whole genome
sequences with a considerable coverage (>7) have been
comprehensively screened via a series of BLAST searches
(Figure 1; see also [9,15,27]), the absence of genes encoding GPx3-like proteins appears apparent in the plant and
invertebrate genomes selected in this study. The free-living and pytoparasitic nematodes [45], of which whole
genome or comprehensive EST databases are available,
contained both of the GPx lineages. The GPx3-like filarial
proteins were identified empirically by analyzing the
major cuticular glycoproteins [46]. Recently, we detected
a PHGPx-like gene from the B. malayi DNA database
[GenBank: XP_001897517]. Genes highly homologous to
the vertebrate GPx7/8 genes were also detected exclusively
in the free-living turbellaria and tunicate (Figures 4 and
5B). Therefore, it is evident that there have been a series of
selection pressures to drive the mosaic distributions of the
GPx3- and GPx7-lineage genes across taxa, which was similarly observed in the DNA methyltranferase gene
homologs [47], although the mechanism(s) in the selection of genes for deletion/maintenance waits for further
investigation.
The tetrameric GPx1/3-lineage proteins were phylogenetically related to one another in the cladistic analysis and
their chromosomal genes showed clonal conservation
patterns (Figure 4 and Additional file 4). On the contrary,
the phylogeny and genomic structures of PHGPx genes
were found to be multifaceted. The aa sequences of PHGPxs were well aligned throughout the whole polypeptides,
except for the extreme N-terminal segments, and gaps
resulted from indels of codon were not prominent (Additional file 2). The polymorphic N-terminal regions were
intimately related to the evolutionary acquisition/loss of
regulatory signal within certain members (Additional file
1). Despite the tight sequence conservation, the hypervariable genomic structures of these genes exhibited a discontinuous conservation patterns according to the
taxonomical distributions and/or biochemical properties
of protein products (Figures 5 and 6). Whether we accept

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/72

the "intron-early" or the "intron-late" hypothesis concerning the origin of spliceosomal introns, it is clear that an
orthologous intron can be taken as a footprint revealing a
common ancestor during evolution of the corresponding
genes [48]. Therefore, each of the genes encoding GSHand Trx-dependent proteins might have evolved along
separate pathways from a certain evolutionary time,
although the enzymatic properties of the nematode PHGPxs have not yet been examined empirically. Compared to
the tightly conserved introns among the platyhelminth
and vertebrate orthologs, intron preservation was much
more complicated in the Trx-dependent insect and plant
genes. The third intron of plant genes was orthologous to
the second intron of some insect genes (Group I) and the
forth intron was shared with the other insect genes
(Group II), while a series of insect genes (Group III) with
uniquely integrated introns were further recognized. The
aa sequences of plant exons 3, 4, and 5 displayed identity
values of 47.8, 59.8, and 53.3%, respectively, to the corresponding regions of Group I insect genes, and 49.8, 41.2,
and 64.0%, respectively, to those of Group II insect genes.
These collective results suggest a probable recombination
event at a region matched to the end of current exon 4,
which had occurred between two paralogs in a primordial
genome that evolved into plants. After gaining additional
introns, the gene might have undergone genic/chromosomal multiplications. Alternatively, each of the diverse
insect genes might have unique exon-intron remodeling
process mediated by a gene's recombination with a cDNA
generated by reverse transcription of the respective mRNA
[49]. Further information on the intermediate metazoan
genes would be informative to address this intriguing
issue.
The fully diverged mammalian genes were present as a
single genomic copy, whereas the PHGPx- or GPx3-like
genes had multiple copies in the respective genomes of
the other metazoans and plants. Together with the polytomic relationships and differentiated genomic organizations, this fact is likely to provide additional evidence for
the modular evolutionary pathways of GPx gene family
from multiple intermediates. The presence of GPx3 in the
soil-borne and pytoparasitic nematodes, and GPx7 in the
free-living planarian and tunicate, respectively, would
reduce the possibility of lateral gene transfer between taxa.
Each of the primordial paralogs duplicated from a common ancestor seems to have been subject to independent
exon-intron remodeling processes such as homologous
recombination and integration of intronic sequences,
along with their taxonomical lineages. A series of the
intermediate genes might have diverged either to GPx3like genes by gaining exonic nucleotides corresponding to
the subunit interaction domain or to GPx7 homologs,
while they underwent lineage-specific expansion or deletion in the metazoan animals. The GPx1/2 genes are likely

Page 9 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:72

to have evolved from the retrointegration of GPx3-like
intermediate aided by retrotransposon-encoded proteins,
which was followed by acquisition of introns, during an
early evolutionary period of the Vertebrata. The evolutionary pathways for the GSH- and Trx-dependent GPxs
appear be separated from the common eukaryotic ancestor. The Trx-dependent GPxs without the resolving Cys in
insects and algae would be acquired by the relaxation of
selective constraints and/or by the adaptation to the
micro-environments in their specific action sites. Further
studies on biochemical properties with the individual
insect GPxs and detection of a second Cys motif, if any,
would be helpful to gain more insight into the complex
evolution of PHGPx-like proteins.

Conclusion
Our study on the comparative analysis of GPx gene families suggests that these genes have modularly evolved
from multiple intermediates, which accompanied the
structural diversification and sporadic expansion/deletion. In addition, the ubiquitous PHGPx genes with different biochemical properties are likely to have been
separated in an early evolutionary time. The dichotomized evolutionary pathways were traceable by considering structural conservation patterns in the chromosomal
genes. Multiple GPx genes have tissue-specific implications in mammals and plants. However, the duplication
events appear to be intimately related to an increase in the
genetic repertoire of the antioxidant enzyme, at least in
the platyhelminth species. The modular evolution of GPx
genes in association with their biochemical properties
may provide a molecular basis for understanding the
detailed physiological implications of this antioxidant
enzyme system. The complexity in genomic structures of
platyhelminth genes, which is comparable to that of
mammalian genes, further suggests that these organisms
comprise an informative model system in elucidating the
driving-forces and courses of genomic complexity during
eukaryotic evolution.

Methods
In silico isolation of GPx genes from platyhelminth species
Two novel genes encoding GPx proteins (PwGPx1 and
PwGPx2) were isolated from an EST dataset of P. westermani [50]. The Paragonimus genes, together with those of S.
mansoni [GenBank: L37762, AY729668] were used as queries in the homology searches to retrieve their orthologous
genes. Genomic and/or EST databases specific to platyhelminths were screened via stand-alone BLAST searches,
including S. mansoni, S. haematobium, F. hepatica, E. granulosus (Sanger Institute; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
Projects/Helminths), S. japonicum (Shanghai Center for
Life Science and Biotechnology Information; http://life
center.sgst.cn/schistosoma/cn/schistosomaCnIn

dexge.do), and S. mediterranea (Genome Sequencing
Center
of
Washington
University;
http://
genome.wustl.edu/) (Figure 1). The GenBank DNA/protein databases at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were
also selected for the screening. GPx proteins isolated from
human (GPx1 and GPx3 [GenBank: CAA68491,
AAP50261]) and filarial nematode (Brugia pahangi [GenBank: CAA48882]) were employed as the other queries
during the analyses.
Sequence analysis
The coding profiles and patterns of sequence similarity of
the retrieved mRNA sequences were analyzed using the
ORF Finder and BLAST programs equipped at the NCBI.
The similarity pattern of each sequence was verified by a
subsequent analysis based on the Hidden Markov Models
using InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/Inter
ProScan/). The SECIS motif was predicted using the SECISearch program (ver. 2.19; http://genome.unl.edu/SECISearch.html). The putative hydrophobic signal peptide
was analyzed by the SignalP program (http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Chromosomal segments homologous to the PwGPx cDNAs were amplified
from the P. westermani genome by long-range PCR using
the gene-specific primer pairs, which had been designed
from the nucleotide sequences within both ends of the
cDNAs (5'-GGTACCAACAGTGACGGTTTGATTTTC TAA
CACC-3' and 5'-GACAGGCCTGGAGGTGAATTGA TGAGAGTGAACC-3' for PwGPx1; 5'-GG AACA TCGA AGGTGGTTTGAAAAAGGTCAACTTC-3' and 5'-CT TTA CTC AC
AAACTACTGTTGCAATAATAGTAACGTC-3' for PwGPx2).
PCR was conducted with the LA Taq system (Takara,
Shiga, Japan) and the resulting PCR products were cloned
into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) for sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were
determined from both strands using a BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Core Kit (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA,
USA) and an automated ABI PRISM 377A DNA Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The mRNA
sequences were aligned with their corresponding genomic
sequences by considering the general rule for nucleotides
tightly conserved in the exon-intron boundary [51], after
which their chromosomal structures were determined
[GenBank: DQ454159, DQ454160].
Enzymatic characterization of native PwGPx proteins
The native proteins were purified from an adult worm
extract using an AKTA fast-performance liquid chromatography (Superdex 75), followed by DEAE-anion exchange
chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), by monitoring GPx activity. The proteins
were also examined by 1-dimensional (1-D) and/or 2-D
Western blotting employing mouse antisera specific to the

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:72

recombinant forms of the PwGPx proteins. The purified
GPx proteins were dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.2) overnight at 4°C. The specific activity of the native proteins
was examined by the reduction of H2O2 or cumene
hydroperoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in the
presence of GSH and Escherichia coli glutathione reductase
(GR), as described previously [38,52]. The 200 μl reaction
mixtures contained 5 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM
GSH, 0.1 unit of GR, 0.1 mM NADPH, 1 mM EDTA, and
1 μM of PwGPx. The reagents were pre-warmed to room
temperature just prior to use in the reaction. After adding
the substrate, the NADPH oxidation level was monitored
at A340 for 5 min with a spectrophotometer. A series of
mixtures containing 10 μM E. coli Trx and 0.1 unit of
thioredoxin reductase (TR) instead of GSH and GR were
also assayed.
Phylogenetic Analysis
A total of 105 members that were assigned separately into
the eight GPx families, were finally selected during the
BLAST searches, by considering both the identity values
and taxonomical distributions of donor organisms. The aa
sequences were aligned using ClustalX and optimized
using GeneDoc. The alignment was used as an input to
obtain a maximum likelihood tree using the quartet puzzling algorithm implanted in TREE_PUZZLE (ver. 5.2)
[53]. The options were selected to use the JTT model for
the aa substitution [54], estimation of aa frequencies from
the dataset, gamma distribution model for rate heterogeneity (the parameter alpha was estimated from the input
data), eight gamma rate categories, and 50,000 puzzling
steps. Indels between pairs of sequences were regarded as
missing data. Distances between pairs of protein
sequences were calculated according to the JTT model and
corrected for the gamma distribution of evolutionary
rates. The standard errors were computed by the bootstrapping of 1,000 replicates. The sequence alignment was
also applied in phylogenetic analyses using the neighborjoining (PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR) and maximum parsimony (PROTPARS) programs of the PHYLIP package
(ver. 3.6b). The statistical significance of each branching
point in the resulting trees was evaluated using 1,000 random samplings of the input alignment by the SEQBOOT
program.
