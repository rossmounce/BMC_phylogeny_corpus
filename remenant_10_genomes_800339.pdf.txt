Abstract
Background: The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex includes thousands of strains pathogenic to an unusually
wide range of plant species. These globally dispersed and heterogeneous strains cause bacterial wilt diseases, which
have major socio-economic impacts. Pathogenicity is an ancestral trait in R. solanacearum and strains with high genetic
variation can be subdivided into four phylotypes, correlating to isolates from Asia (phylotype I), the Americas
(phylotype IIA and IIB), Africa (phylotype III) and Indonesia (phylotype IV). Comparison of genome sequences strains
representative of this phylogenetic diversity can help determine which traits allow this bacterium to be such a
pathogen of so many different plant species and how the bacteria survive in many different habitats.
Results: The genomes of three tomato bacterial wilt pathogens, CFBP2957 (phy. IIA), CMR15 (phy. III) and PSI07 (phy. IV)
were sequenced and manually annotated. These genomes were compared with those of three previously sequenced
R. solanacearum strains: GMI1000 (tomato, phy. I), IPO1609 (potato, phy. IIB), and Molk2 (banana, phy. IIB). The major
genomic features (size, G+C content, number of genes) were conserved across all of the six sequenced strains. Despite
relatively high genetic distances (calculated from average nucleotide identity) and many genomic rearrangements,
more than 60% of the genes of the megaplasmid and 70% of those on the chromosome are syntenic. The three new
genomic sequences revealed the presence of several previously unknown traits, probably acquired by horizontal
transfers, within the genomes of R. solanacearum, including a type IV secretion system, a rhi-type anti-mitotic toxin and
two small plasmids. Genes involved in virulence appear to be evolving at a faster rate than the genome as a whole.
Conclusions: Comparative analysis of genome sequences and gene content confirmed the differentiation of R.
solanacearum species complex strains into four phylotypes. Genetic distances between strains, in conjunction with
CGH analysis of a larger set of strains, revealed differences great enough to consider reclassification of the R.
solanacearum species complex into three species. The data are still too fragmentary to link genomic classification and
phenotypes, but these new genome sequences identify a pan-genome more representative of the diversity in the R.
solanancearum species complex.
Background

analyses are a powerful tool for understanding the complex evolutionary events in specific phylogenetic lineages.
R. solanacearum, formerly known as Pseudomonas
solanacearum and Burkholderia solanacearum, is the
causal agent of bacterial wilt [1]. This soil-borne vascular
pathogen is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical
climates and affects an unusually broad range of crops,
including both monocot and dicot plants [2-4]. Many
affected hosts are critical for developing countries

because of their strategic importance as cash crops or as
subsistence foods like potato (Solanum tuberosum),
tomato (S. lycopersicum), eggplant (S. melongena), cooking banana (Musa spp.) and peanut (Arachis hypogea). In
the 1990s, potato brown rot strains of R. solanacearum
historically known as race 3/biovar 2 (r3b2) were introduced in Europe and North America [5,6]. Due to their
adaptation to tropical highland climates, these strains,
which are more virulent at cool temperatures (~20°C)
than tropical strains [7], may pose major threats in temperate zones. Therefore, R. solanacearum was listed as a
quarantine organism in Europe and Canada and as a Bioterrorism Select Agent in the U.S. [8].
R. solanacearum and the closely related species R. syzygii (a pathogen of clove in Indonesia) and the banana
blood disease bacterium (BDB) form a complex in the R.
picketii lineage [9-12]. This species complex includes
thousands of genetically distinct strains that can differ
from each other by more than 30%, and thus do not
belong in the same species by conventional definition
[13]. This species complex includes strains with broad
and narrow host ranges, which are ecologically different
as well: potato strains are cold-tolerant and banana
strains are insect-transmitted, and with different geographic origins. Because R. solanacearum strains have
been isolated from virgin jungle soils in both Asia and the
Americas, the origin of the species complex is believed to
predate the geological separation of the continents [14].
Based on analyses of the 16S-23S internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) region, egl and hrpB genes and on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), the R. solanacearum
species complex is hierarchically classified in four phylogenetic groups called phylotypes, which reflect their origins as follows: Asia (phylotype I), the Americas
(phylotype II), Africa (phylotype III) or Indonesia (phylotype IV, which includes R. syzygii and BDB) [15,16]. Each
phylotype can be further subdivided into sequevars, or
sequence variants, which may contain isolates with similar virulence patterns or common geographic origin [12].
Despite their considerable phylogenetic diversity, R.
solanacearum strains are unified by their common
pathology. All cause bacterial wilt disease, which is characterized by bacterial colonization of the plant xylem vessels to very high cell densities (109 - 1010 CFU/ml xylem
fluid), vascular browning, stunting, wilting, and often
rapid death [3]. The bacterium is transmitted by soil, surface water, and infected propagation materials like potato
tubers or ornamental cuttings. It most commonly infects
plants through the roots, but some strains are insecttransmitted [17]. Bacterial wilt is difficult to control
because the bacterium survives for years in infested soils
and weed hosts. Breeding for host resistance, the best
management strategy is complicated by the pathogen's
high genetic diversity. For example, tomatoes resistant to

Page 2 of 16

R. solanacearum strains in one region are often susceptible to those in another [18].
Genome sequences of R. solanacearum strains can
answer historic questions about what traits allow this
bacterium to be such an aggressive and lethal pathogen of
so many different plants, and to survive in such different
habitats as soil, water, non-host plant rhizospheres and
host xylem vessels. The bi-partite genome of R. solanacearum strain GMI1000 (phylotype I, sequevar 18) was
sequenced and analyzed [19,20] . The genome has two
replicons, called the chromosome and the megaplasmid,
with a mosaic structure that implies many rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. Several factors have
been shown to contribute to bacterial wilt virulence,
especially the type III secretion system (TTSS) and associated effectors [21], and production of extracellular polysaccharides and enzymes [22]. The GMI1000 genome
encodes more than a hundred TTSS effectors or putative
effectors [23]. Draft genomes are available for two additional R. solanacearum strains: IPO1609/UW551, which
cause potato brown rot disease in cool-temperate climates and Molk2, which causes Moko disease of banana
and plantain [24,25]. These respectively belong to phylotype IIB sequevar 1 (IIB-1) and sequevar 3 (IIB-3).
To better understand how this highly diverse and scattered species complex has evolved and diverged without
losing its fundamental pathological qualities, we
sequenced the genomes of three additional broad host
range strains from other phylotypes, namely: American
strain CFBP2957 (IIA-36), African strain CMR15 (III-29)
and Indonesian strain PSI07 (IV-10). All were originally
isolated from tomato. Their complete genomes were
manually annotated and analyzed with the aim of investigating the conserved, variable, and specific gene repertoires of these strains and the three previously sequenced
ones, with a special emphasis on genes involved in virulence and pathogenicity. In addition, the genomes of 51 R.
solanacearum strains (including the six sequenced
strains) were compared by CGH on a pan-genomic
microarray. These comparative genomic approaches produced new insights into the evolution and taxonomy of
the R. solanacearum species complex.

Results and Discussion
It has long been known that R. solanacearum is a highly
heterogeneous group of strains and thus no one genome
sequence could represent the entire species complex. Initial genomic studies revealed that R. solanacearum
strains have a substantial backbone of common housekeeping and virulence functions, but also carry a divergent set of genomic modules that likely confer distinct
ecological phenotypes and host specificity [19,24]. Comparing multiple bacterial genomes distributed around the
phylogenetic tree was therefore essential to understand

the evolutionary driving forces and mechanisms that
have produced such a phenotypically and genotypically
diverse group. Four existing genome sequences represented phylotype I (tomato isolate GMI1000) and phylotype II (IPO1609/UW551 and Molk2, from potato and
banana, respectively) [19,24,25]. The phylotype-sequevar
subclassification system provided rational criteria for
choosing more strains to sequence to cover significant
additional diversity in the species complex. We therefore
sequenced genomes of strains that cause bacterial wilt of
tomato from Indonesia (PSI07, phylotype IV), Cameroon
(CMR15, phylotype III), and the French West Indies
(CFPPB2957, phylotype II).
Overview of genomes of CFBP2957, CMR15 and PSI07

The two-replicon (chromosome and megaplasmid)
genome architecture of these three tomato strains was
identical to that found in the three previously sequenced
strains. As in the GMI1000 genome [20], most -but not
all- housekeeping genes were carried on the chromosome. However, the capture or creation of the megaplasmid by Ralstonia spp. appears to be an ancient event,
since all strains in the R. pickettii lineage studied to date
have two replicons (Lucas et al, unpublished). Moreover,
CGH microarray analyses by Guidot et al. [16] established that both replicons have a long history of coevolution within the R. solanacearum species complex.
The sizes of the chromosomes and megaplasmids, and
therefore the entire genome, are similar in all strains The
average genome size for the sequenced R. solanacearum
strains was approximately 5.7 Mb including the chromosome (3.6 Mb) and the megaplasmid (2.1 Mb) (Table 1).
Additional data on genome characteristics are provided
in supplemental material [Additional file 1]. R. solanacearum strains CFBP2957, CMR15 and PSI07 had
genome lengths of 5,683,402 bp, 5,606,288 bp and
5,593,041 bp, respectively, with a common average G+C
content of 66.7% in both replicons. With an average pro-

tein coding density of 86.8%, chromosomes contained
about 3500 predicted coding sequences (CDS), and
megaplasmids contained about 1800. Only one rRNA
operon was detected in each R. solanacearum genome,
except in strains GMI1000 and CMR15, which had 4 and
3 rRNA operons, respectively. Additional ribosomal
operons can permit faster adaptation to new environmental conditions by increasing protein synthesis capacity [26]. In CMR15, two rRNA operons were on the
chromosome and one on the megaplasmid; GMI1000 has
three on the chromosome and one on the megaplasmid.
The three CMR15 rRNA operons were 99.5% identical at
the nucleotide level. Fifty-nine, 49 and 56 tRNA genes
were identified in strains CFBP2957, CMR15 and PSI07,
respectively.
Automatic re-annotation of the R. solanacearum
sequences in the public domain identified 517 additional
coding sequences (CDS) in GMI1000 (263 on the chromosome and 254 on the megaplasmid [Additional file 2]).
These newly identified genes, encoding mostly proteins
of unknown function, were encoded 'RALSO' to distinguish them from previously-annotated CDS ('RSc' and
'RSp').
The R. solanacearum pan-genome

The new genome sequences from strains CMR15,
CFBP2957 and PSI07 were combined with existing
sequences from strains GMI1000, IPO1609, and Molk2 to
identify a total of 9093 unigenes which constitute the
known pan-genome of R. solanacearum: that is, the set of
all genes present in a group of organisms. The pangenome is composed of the core-genome (genes present
in all strains), the dispensable genome (genes present in
some strains, but not all) and the specific genome (unique
genes present in only one strain) [27]. As reported in figure 1, among these 9093 genes, 2543 were highly conserved (bidirectional best hit (BBH)) in the six genomes
and constituted the R. solanacearum core-genome, which

thus makes up 28% of the pan-genome. Ninety-three percent of the core genome CDS were located on the chromosome. The dispensable genome contained 3538 genes
(39% of the pan-genome). This is in general agreement
with a previous conserved genome estimate of 2690 genes
that was based on CGH analyses of 18 strains [16]. The
overestimate by the CGH approach is probably due to
nonspecific hybridizations and lower technical precision
of hybridization compared to sequencing. The number of
strain-specific genes was variable, ranging from 391 for
Molk2 to 640 for GMI1000 (figure 1). For these six R.
solanacearum strains, a total of 3012 genes were identified as strain-specific genes, which represents a third of
the current pan-genome. Depending on the strain, the
number of proteins of unknown function (or conserved
proteins of unknown function) encoded by the strainspecific genes ranged from 73 to 84% in. These genes
likely hold many clues to the traits and mechanisms
underlying the biological diversity of the R. solanacearum
species complex, but because so few of these CDS can be
functionally annotated, gene by gene mutagenesis and
phenotype analysis will be needed to determine their
roles.
Genome plasticity and genomic islands

Working from the GMI1000 genome, we identified syntenic CDS in all six R. solanacearum genomes and also in
some bacterial species most closely related to the R. picketii lineage (figure 2A). The six R. solanacearum genomes
were highly syntenic: 55 to 65% of the CDS on the megaplasmid and 70 to 80% of the CDS on the chromosome
were in synteny. This percentage decreased to below 55%
on the chromosome and 20% on the megaplasmid in

Page 4 of 16

other closely related species, except for R. picketii, where
68 and 40% of CDS, on the chromosome and the megaplasmid respectively, were in synteny with GMI1000. R.
pickettii is closely related to, but not a member of the R.
solanacearum species complex; both belong to the R.
pickettii lineage (as distinct from the R. eutropha lineage)
[9]. Cupriavidus spp. and R. eutropha are the closest relatives to the R. pickettii lineage, but in these genomes the
number of CDS in synteny with GMI1000 was dramatically lower on both replicons. Further, the size of syntenic
regions was greater within the R. solanacearum species
complex; an average of 11 to 16 CDS per synton was
observed on chromosomes of these strains (figure 2B,
black bar). The exception was the African strain, CMR15,
where we found an average of 25 CDS per synton with
GMI1000. For the other related species, the mean number of CDS in one synton was fewer than 8. For all comparisons, we found that the megaplasmids always
contained fewer CDS in synteny than the chromosomes.
Multiple alignments of R. solanacearum genomes
revealed that many genomic rearrangements occurred in
the history of these organisms, including intra- and interreplicon rearrangements (figure 3).
R. solanacearum is naturally competent for DNA transformation [28-30] which allows cells to acquire foreign
genetic material directly from their environment. Nakamura et al [31] estimated that nearly 16% of GMI1000
genes were horizontally transferred. Genomic islands are
parts of genomes that display evidence of horizontal
acquisition. They have a minimal length of 5 kb and contain CDSs with no BBH and no synteny with genomes of
compared organisms. Table S3 [Additional file 3] provides a complete list of the numerous genomic islands
detected in CFBP2957, CMR15 and PSI07, and a schematic representation of genomic island locations is given
in figure 4. The density of genomic islands was two-fold
greater on megaplasmids than on chromosome. Many of
these genomic islands were IS or phage sequences containing almost exclusively proteins of unknown function.
However, some genomic islands carried type III effectors
(or putative effectors), including, in CMR15: GALA8, an
unknown effector, similar to other GALA effectors (GR1
on the chromosome); popP2 (GR11 on the chromosome);
as well as putative effectors (GR29 or GR32 on the megaplasmid). Two supplementary rRNA operons (GR12chromosme and GR2-megaplasmid) and nosZRDFYL, an
operon involved in the anaerobic denitrification pathway
(GR12-megaplasmid) were also located on genomic
islands in CMR15. In PSI07, three putative type III effectors were detected on chromosomal genomic islands
(GR12 and GR31) and one on the megaplasmid (GR38).
In CFBP2957, only two putative effectors were detected
in genomic islands (GR4-chromosome and GR3-megaplasmid). These results are still too fragmentary to deter-

mine any relationship between host ranges and the
presence or absence of repertoires of specific effectors.
However, acquisition of new effectors could theoretically
contribute to rapid adaptability and diversification, especially in virulence and aggressiveness, as well as to saprophytic fitness.
Interestingly, the megaplasmids of CFBP2957 and
PSI07 also harbor a genomic island containing the rhi
operon. This operon was composed of 9 genes: rhiB
(20274 pb), rhiC (97185 pb), rhiI (867 pb), rhiD (12468
pb), rhiH (1458 pb), rhiE (12657 pb), rhiF (7824 pb), rhiA
(7158 pb) and rhiG (1983 pb). The rhi genes were previously unknown in Ralstonia strains, but are present in
Pseudomonas fluorescens [32] and in Burkholderia
rhizoxinica where they encode a non-ribosomal peptide
synthase (NRPS) that synthesizes the antimitotic toxin
rhizoxin [33]. Although this operon spans more than 80
kb, it could have been horizontally acquired since R.
solanacearum can exchange and integrate DNA fragments of 30 to 90 kb by natural transformation [29]. The
insertion of such a toxin operon in the genome of R.
solanacearum could provide a competitive advantage in
the soil environment.
Comparison of some metabolic properties

To better understand metabolic diversity among the
sequenced strains, we used Principal Compenents Analy-

sis (PCA), a type of factorial analysis that analyzes a data
matrix by several quantitative variables [34]. We applied
PCA to a matrix describing the completion (measured as
a percentage) of all known metabolic pathways present in
the six R. solanacearum genomes (figure 5). The first two
resulting factors captured over 67% of the data's total
variability. The axes were interpreted with the help of
external information, such as each strain's host, phylotype, and the laboratory of annotation. The first factorial
axis separated strain GMI1000 from the five other strains.
This result accounted for the metabolic functions corresponding to the red-colored vectors. The list of pathways
that these vectors represent can be consulted in Table S4
A and B [additional file 4], and generally have a maximum
of two or three reactions. None of these pathways appear
to be complete in GMI1000. This suggests that this factorial axis is in fact an artifact of insufficient or erroneous
enzymatic function annotations. This should help guide
future annotation efforts. The second factorial axis separated the strains according to their hosts: banana and
potato for Molk2 and IPO1609, and tomato for PSI07,
CMR15 and CFBP2957. As would be expected, Molk2
and IPO1609, which are close together in the factorial
plane, actually belong to the same phylotype (IIB).
Careful examination of the metabolic potential of the
studied genomes has revealed some specificity capabilities for compound degradation. Although R. solan-

acearum is a highly adapted and ancient plant pathogen,
this organism can also survive well in soil and rhizospheres and, consequently, its genome encodes ability to
metabolize diverse organic compounds as energy
sources. Pathway analyses indicate that this bacterium
can utilize a wide range of substrates including amino
acids, sugars, and fatty acids as well as glycerol, ethanol,
methylglyoxal, and beta-ketoadipate ([Additional file 4,
sheet B], also Genin and Boucher [20]). GMI1000 was
predicted to grow on various aromatic compounds

including ferulate, vanillate, and protocatechuate [20],
which are released when lignin degrades in soil. However
strains CMR15 and GMI1000 do not harbour the benABCD and catABC genes involved in benzoate and catechol degradation to beta-ketoadipate. Another
contrasting example is D-galactonate degradation, which
can serve as energy and sole carbon source for many
enteric bacteria [35]. In soil, bacteria such as Azotobacter
vinelandii and Sinorhizobium meliloti convert D-galactose to D-galactonate via the De Ley-Doudoroff pathway,

Figure 5 Principal Component Analysis of six R. solanacearum genomes, performed from a two dimensional matrix, combining
genomes and metabolic pathways. Individual points represent genomes, and colored vectors symbolize completion of some pathways
(number of reaction for pathway x in a given organism/total number
of reactions in the same pathway x defined in the MetaCyc database)
in the data (see method section). Pathways with similar completions
(vectors with similar orientation) have been clustered and drawn in a
same color. Thus, genomes can be associated with their representative
and characteristic groups of metabolic pathways (i.e. vectors pointing
in their direction). The corresponding pathway functions are listed in
Suppl.Table S4.A.

and finally to D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. Our data indicate that D-galactonate degradation is
functional only in strains GMI1000, CMR15 and PSI07
[Additional file 4, sheet B]. However, this substrate must
be taken up whole from the environment because no degradation enzymes upstream in the pathway were apparent in these genomes. Curiously, it seems that the Dgalactonate transport system is different in CMR15,
which harbors only one likely transport gene in the corresponding synton, and in GMI1000 and PSI07, which each
have 3 genes highly similar to the L-arabinose ABC transporter (annotated as araFGH).
Urease, which is necessary for utilization of urea as sole
nitrogen source, has three main subunits and five accessory proteins. Genetic determinants for this enzymatic
activity were found in all strains except Molk2, the only
banana wilt pathogen sequenced to date. All six strains
appear able to metabolize inorganic nutrients such as sulfate and nitrate, consistent with experimental data [14].
However, the denitrification pathway was complete only
in strains GMI1000 and CMR15, because the nosZ gene
encoding nitrous oxide reductase was absent from the
four other strains; this heterogeneity was previously

noted [25]. Genes for periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap),
nitrate reductase (nar), nitric oxide reductase (nor) and
nitrite reductase (nir) were present on the megaplasmids
of all six sequenced R. solanacearum strains.
Finally, all six genomes contain genes involved in the
detoxification of noxious compounds and in metal resistance, which likely support colonization and survival in
specific ecological niches. An interesting example is arsenic resistance which in bacteria is mediated in part by ars
genes. Among these, arsC encodes an arsenate reductase
[As(V)TAs(III)], arsA and arsB encode an arsenite efflux
pump, and arsR encodes a transcriptional regulator [36].
As(III) is known to induce oxidative stress, to cause DNA
damage, and to inhibit the DNA repair system [37]. It is
generally further oxidized by the arsenite oxidase
[As(III)TAs(V)] encoded by aoxAB genes. The arsC gene
is the sole gene in this pathway present in all six strains,
with two tandem copies in PSI07. In addition, only PSI07
can oxidize arsenite: on the PSI07 megaplasmid is a cluster containing two arsC genes, aoxAB, and arsR. The
annotation of the arsC-like gene is probably erroneous in
the other Ralstonia species (and in many other bacterial
genomes as well).
Virulence factors

Many traits contribute to virulence of R. solanacearum
strains. The best known are the type III secreted effectors, well described in this bacterium and in other plant
pathogens [23]. However, other traits, such as production
of EPS and cell wall-degrading enzymes, are also important for wilt disease development. Based on the literature,
we created an inventory of 128 genes involved in virulence from the six sequenced R. solanacearum genomes
[Additional file 5: Supplemental Table S5]. Some genes
are involved in swimming motility, twitching motility and
chemotaxis. Table S5 gives a representative pair of genes
for each of those functions. Virulence genes were subdivided into 5 categories: type III effectors (TTE) and putative effectors, the exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic
genes, the cell wall-degrading enzyme (CWDE) genes,
response to host defence genes and key virulence regulators. Scrutiny of the genomes shows that all six strains
have all genes needed for functional type II and III secretion systems. Similarity distances between each
sequenced strain were computed on the basis of gene
presence/absence data for these 128 virulence genes (data
not shown). Phylogenetic analysis constructed on the
basis of: 1) all known or putative Type 3 effector genes in
the pan-genome, and 2) all known virulence factor genes
of all kinds in the pan-genome, resulted in trees that were
significantly different from each other, and significantly
different from trees based on well-conserved genes like
mutS and egl sequences, or on the entire genome
sequences (data not shown). This result suggests that vir-

Remenant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:379
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/379

ulence factor genes have evolved or been lost or added at
substantially different rates than R. solanacearum genes
as a whole. A more fine-scale case-by-case analysis will
likely be needed to trace the evolutionary history of individual virulence traits. Analysis of strains hosted by
plants phylogenetically distant from tomato (a common
host for all strains analyzed here except Molk2) may elucidate roles of individual virulence factors in determining
host range.
Type III-secreted effectors are an important potential
source of host range variability in R. solanacearum
strains; these have mainly been described in GMI1000
and UW551 to date [23,25]. Specific effectors that are
important in CMR15, CFBP2957 and PSI07 are
unknown. We attempted to detect new type III effectors
with the Effective software [38], but this did not work well
for R. solanacearum strains, giving about 50% false negative on previously annotated effectors (data not shown).
Plasmids in Ralstonia solanacearum strains

Genin and Boucher [20] suggested that the presence of
small plasmids in R. solanacearum cells, initially
described by Morales and Sequeira [39], was more an
exception than a rule. However, we found small plasmids
(<50 kb) in the African and Indonesian strains. These
plasmids were named pRSC35 (35 kb, GC% = 61.3) in
strain CMR15 and pRSI13 (12.8 kb, GC% = 61.0) in strain
PSI07. The presence of small plasmids is therefore maybe
less rare in R. solanacearum strains than previously
thought. These small plasmids may have remained undetected until now because their very low copy number
makes them difficult to purify (unpublished results).
Despite their low copy numbers, the stability of these
plasmids is apparently ensured by two different toxin/
antitoxin (TA) systems. On pRSC35, two CDS had a limited homology with zeta-toxin and epsilon-antitoxin
(<40%), which form a post-segregational mechanism for
plasmid maintenance in bacteria [40,41]. The regulator ω
was not detected in the CMR15 genome. This zeta/epsilon TA system is well described and a similar system confers a bactericidal effect on Bacillus subtilis, and
bacteriostatic effects on E. coli [42].
The plasmid pRSC35 was broadly syntenic with plasmids from many plant-associated bacteria including
pXcB of Xanthomonas citri pv. aurantifolii (65% of CDS
in synteny), diverse P. putida plasmids (from 58 to 62%
synteny), a X. citri pv. citri plasmid (58% synteny) and a
plasmid from X. euvesicatoria (51% synteny). Among the
44 CDS present on this plasmid (figure 6A), 14 appeared
to be involved in the Type IV secretion system: 10 genes
make up the virB operon (virB1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and
11) ranging from 5 to 15 kbp, and four genes form the tra
operon (traA, B, C and D) from 28 to 34 kbp. Eight CDS
coded for proteins potentially involved in DNA metabo-

lism (such as partition proteins parA, parB and parR, a
DNA methyltransferase, and a DNA mismatch endonuclease). Finaly, one CDS had a strong homology to a Znmetalloprotease (mpr), also carried on plasmids in several
human and/or animal pathogenic bacteria or opportunistic bacteria: P. putida, Yersina pestis, Escherichia coli
O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica,
etc. Metalloproteases like those encoded on pRSC35 are
essential for the infection process of many eukaryotes
[43-46].
The unexpected Type IV Secretion System is unique
among R. solanacearum strains studied to date and could
play diverse important roles in virulence and adaptation.
The CMR15 Type IV secretion system genes, which are
clustered together with the virB operon, have nearly the
same organization as on pXAC64 of Xanthomonas citri
pv citri [47]. The type IV secretion system is a bacterial
conjugation apparatus [48] and the DNA thus efficiently
imported through the cell envelope can directly increase
the fitness or virulence of bacteria by mediating the
acquisition of new traits like effectors or antibiotic resistance genes. Type IV secretion systems can also be
directly involved in virulence via direct injection of effectors or DNA into plant cells [49,50]. No obvious type IV
effectors were found on pRSC35 or in the complete
genome of CMR15, but some proteins of unknown function could be Type IV effectors. Additional experiments
are needed to investigate (i) the distribution of this plasmid in African phylotype III strains, (ii) the ecological
and pathogenic role of this plasmid in the phenotype of
phylotype III strain CMR15, and (iii) the occurrence of
such plasmids in strains belonging to other phylotypes.
A second low-copy number plasmid, pRSI13, was present in PSI07. It was syntenic with a plasmid found in
Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14 (34% of CDS in synteny),
Burkholderia pseudomallei 9 and 91 (30 and 26% respectively), Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DS-1 (26%), Acidovorax sp. JS42 (26%) and E. coli pOLA52 (26%). pRSI13
contained 23 CDS, 16 of which encoded for proteins of
unknown function and one for a putative transcriptional
regulator. Other pRSI13 CDS coded for proteins putatively involved in DNA metabolism or conjugation (figure
6B). Thus, the functional annotation reveals no obvious
role for this plasmid in either the ecology of the bacteria
(saprophytic life in the soil) or during pathogenesis. The
maintenance of this plasmid seems likely due to the TA
system rather than to increased fitness.
New insight into the phylogeny of the R. solanacearum
species complex

Genomes were compared pairwise using the average
nucleotide identity (ANI) calculation (figure 7); the dendrogram summarizes the results, which grouped together
strains GMI1000 (Asia) and CMR15 (Africa), with ANI

values above 96%. New World (American) strains
CFBP2957, Molk2 and IPO1609 (phylotype II) were likewise clustered together (above 98% ANI between Molk2
and IPO1609 and above 96% between CFBP2957 and
Molk2-IPO1609). Indonesian strain PSI07 was closest to
the phylotype II group, but the ANI values between PSI07
and any other strain were always less than 95%. The
topology of the species complex phyogenetic tree com-

puted from ANI values was fully consistent with that
observed in previous trees computed with CGH microarray data [16] and with mutS and hrpB sequences [15].
Thus, working with a smaller number of strains but with
much more data per strain, these genome sequences confirm the phylotype classification scheme and their phylogenetic position, i.e. phylotype I is closest to phylotype
III, and phylotype IV is closest to the phylotype IIA and

demonstrated that ANI values above 95% are equivalent
to the 70% DNA-DNA hybridization cut-off value traditionally used to differentiate bacterial species. Using this
standard, our data identify three evolutionarily distinct
groups within the R. solanacearum species complex:
GMI1000-CMR15; CFBP2957-IPO1609-Molk2; and
strain PSI07. Separate ANI analysis of replicons gave the
same result as whole genome analyses (data not shown).
As proposed by Stakebrandt et al [53], genomic data can
be used to propose new species, provided that there is
sufficient congruence with DNA-DNA reassociation.
We used CGH of a spotted microarray reflecting the
pan-genome of GMI1000, IPO1609, and Molk2 to further
define phylogenetic relationships among a set of 51
strains selected to span the known diversity within the
species complex, and to verify that the three new
genomes selected were truly representative of their
respective phylotypes. Hierarchical clustering of these 51
strains (figure 8) differentiated five clusters, which each
cluster matching to a phylotype (or a phylotype subdivision). This dendrogram is fully congruent with the validated phylogeny of the species complex [15,54] and
deepens a previous analysis performed on a smaller set of
strains with a less complete CGH microarray based only
on the GMI1000 genome [16]. Furthermore, the position
of each sequenced strain within its own phylotype cluster
allowed us to extend ANI results to the other 46 strains.
The taxonomy of the species complex can now be
reviewed based on these consistent results from several

different techniques. The analyse of genetic distance
between genome sequences of much strain, especially in
phylotype IV, should be decisive, but our CGH data suggest that there is a solid phylogenetic basis for dividing
this group into three species, according to the phylotype
scheme: one species containing Phylotype II, a second
containing Phylotypes I and III, and a third containing R.
solanacearum strains from Phylotype IV.

Conclusion
We compared the genome organizations and gene repertoires from six phylogenetically distant and phenotypically divergent strains from the R. solanacearum species
complex. These strains shared many structural and genotypic traits observed in the first sequenced strain of R.
solanacearum, GMI1000. Our results significantly
expanded the known R. solanacearum pan-genome, identifying thousands of genes that more sharply define the
common core, the dispensable and the specific (strainunique) genomes. However, the genomes differed quite
significantly. Our ANI and other analyses suggest that
this large and heterogeneous species complex spans
enough variation that it could be reclassified into at least
three distinct taxonomic groups, which each have the
equivalent of more than 30% divergence from the other
two at the DNA-DNA hybridization level. Post-genomic
mining of this pan-genome can combine comparative
tools like CGH microarrays with phenotypic experiments
to determine the distribution and the biological functions
of likely traits identified with in silico analyses. Such combined approaches will increase our understanding of the
evolutionary past, the phylogeography, and the biological
specialization of R. solanacearum species complex
strains. Although four of the six strains sequenced to date
were isolated from tomato plants, our analysis did not
identify any variations in previously known virulence factors that were unique to tomato pathogens. This could be
explained by either 1) an insufficiently large sample of
non-tomato pathogen genomes or 2) a biological unity in
the core mechanisms of bacterial wilt across all R. solanacearum species complex members, with host specificity
and ecological adaptations conferred by traits that remain
to be identified. Sequencing of additional species complex members that infect highly divergent plant hosts
such as clove trees and plantains will offer additional
insights into the traits that confer host specificity on bacterial wilt pathogens.
Methods
Strains

The three sequenced strains were isolated from infected
tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) in different geographic locations: CFBP2957 (phylotype IIA-36) was isolated in the French West Indies [Syn. MT5, [55]], CMR15

Remenant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:379
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/379

(phylotype III-29) in Cameroon [56] and PSI07 (phylotype IV-10) in Indonesia [12]. Bacteria were grown at
28°C in B liquid medium [57]. Strains CFBP2957, PSI07
(CFBP7288) and CMR15 (CFBP6941) were deposited at
CFBP [58] (Collection Française de Bactéries Phytopathogènes, Angers, France). Table S6 [Additional file 6]
provides a list of the 51 R. solanacearum strains used in
microarray experiments, with their geographical origin
and host of origin.
Sequencing and assembly

Genomic DNA was purified from overnight liquid cultures of each strain using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Sequencing of the R. solanacearum strains CMR15, CFBP2957 and PSI07 was
performed using the strategy described by Aury et al.
[59]. Around 20× coverage of 454 GSflx reads were mixed
with 1× coverage Sanger reads for the scaffolding, which
was derived from a 10 kb insert fragment size library.
Each library was constructed after mechanical shearing
of genomic DNA and cloning of generated inserts into
plasmid pCNS (pSU18-derived). Plasmid DNAs were
purified and end-sequenced (11520 R. solanacearum PIII,
14592 R. solanacearum PIIA and 7680 R. solanacearum
PI) by dye-terminator chemistry with ABI3730 sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) leading to an
approximately 1-fold coverage. The sequences were
assembled using Newbler (Roche Diagnostics) and validated via the Consed interface [60]. For the finishing
phases, we used primer walking of clones and/or PCRs
and transposon bombs Template Generation System™ II
Kit (TGS™ II Kit) (Finnzyme), Kan3 as well as around 60×
coverage using Solexa reads GAI to polish the genome
draft.
Automatic and expert annotation of the Ralstonia genomes

Coding sequences (CDS) were predicted using AMIGene
(Annotation of Microbial Genomes) software [61]. Each
predicted CDS was assigned a unique identifier prefixed
with "CMR15_", "CMR15_mp" and "pCMR15_", for R.
solanacearum CMR15 (respectively the chromosome,
megaplasmid, and plasmid), with "PSI07_", "PSI07_mp"
and "pPSI07" for R. solanacearum PSI07 (respectively the
chromosome, megaplasmid, and plasmid), and with
"RCFBP_", "RCFBP_mp" for R. solanacearum CFBP2957
(respectively the chromosome and megaplasmid). The set
of predicted genes were submitted to automatic functional annotation using the tools listed in Vallenet et al.
[62]. Apart from the plasmid-encoded genes, the functional assignment was first based on the reference
genome of Cupriavidus taiwanensis annotations [63] for
strong orthologs i.e., 85% identity over at least 80% of the
length of the smallest protein. All these data (syntactic

Page 12 of 16

and functional annotations, and results of comparative
analysis, see below) are stored in a relational database,
called RalstoniaScope. Manual validation of the automatic annotation was performed using the web-based
MaGe [64] (Magnifying Genomes) interface, which
allows graphic visualization of the annotations enhanced
by a synchronized representation of synteny groups in
other genomes chosen for comparison. As described by
Vallenet et al. [65] the system also offers several functions
to guide accurate manual expert annotation. We performed a complete manual annotation of the CMR15
genome and then used it to automatically annotate strong
orthologs in PSI07 and CFBP2957. Only 'specific' regions
of these two strains, i.e. those containing genes not
orthologous to ones in CMR15, were manually annotated. Finally, this expert work was used to update the
annotation of GMI1000, which was published in 2002,
and to automatically annotate the two other sequenced
(but not finished) strains, Molk2 and IPO1609 [24]. Using
the available contigs of Molk2 and IPO1909, we were not
able to properly organize the corresponding sequences
using GMI1000 as a reference genome. Genomes of these
two R. solanacearum strains are thus not correctly assembled in MaGe and some analyses remain impossible with
these genomes.
Complete sequence data for CFBP2957, CMR15, PSI07,
GMI1000, Molk2 and IPO1609 are publicly available via
the MaGe interface (RalstoniaScope [66]). Sequences and
annotations data of R. solanacearum CFBP2957, CMR15
and PSI07 have also been deposited at the EMBL database [67] [EMBL:FP885897 and EMBL:FP885907 (chromosome and megaplasmid), EMBL:FP885895 and
and
EMBL:FP885906
and
EMBL:FP885896,
EMBL:FP885891 respectively. Sequences of plasmids
pRSC35 and pRSI13 are available using accession numbers EMBL:FP885893 and EMBL:FP885890].
Genomic Island Identification

We used the RGPfinder tool in the MaGe annotation platform (Roche et al., in preparation) to investigate Regions
of Genomic Plasticity (RGPs) in the whole genome
sequences of R. solanacearum GMI1000, CMR15, PSIO7,
CFBP2957, Molk2 and IPO1609. RGPs are defined as
regions of at least 5 kb that are missing in at least one of
the genomes compared. This definition makes no
assumption about the evolutionary origin or genetic basis
of these variable chromosomal segments. RGPfinder
searches for synteny breaks between a target genome and
a set of closely related bacteria (generally other strains) to
define RGPs. It also provides information about composition abnormalities (%G+C deviation, Codon Adaptation
Index) and RGP flanking features such as tRNA, IS and
repeats, which are common characteristics of genomic
islands (GI). Moreover the tool integrates the results of

Remenant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:379
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/379

Alien Hunter [68] a method that analyses compositional
biases to detect atypical sequences (i.e., sequences potentially acquired by horizontal gene transfer).
Synteny group computation

Sequence data for comparative analyses were obtained
from the NCBI database (RefSeq section [69]). Putative
orthology relationships between two genomes were
defined by gene pairs satisfying either the BBH criterion
or an alignment threshold (at least 40% sequence identity
over at least 80% of the length of the smallest protein).
These relationships were subsequently used to search for
synteny groups (i.e., conservation of the chromosomal
co-localisation between pairs of orthologous genes from
different genomes) among several bacterial genomes
using an algorithm based on an exact graph-theoretical
approach [70]. This method allowed for multiple correspondences between genes, detection of paralogy relationships,
gene
fusions,
and
chromosomal
rearrangements (inversion, insertion/deletion). The 'gap'
parameter, representing the maximum number of consecutive genes that are not involved in a synteny group,
was set to five.
Average nucleotide identity calculation

The average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated
according to Konstantinidis and Tiedje [51]. Pairwise
comparisons between sequences were done separately for
chromosomes and megaplasmids (GMI1000, CFBP2957,
CMR15 and PSI07), and then for entire genomes
(GMI1000, Molk2, IPO1609, CFBP2957, CMR15 and
PSI07). Similarity between strains (using Euclidian distance) and dendrogram computation were conducted
with the R statistical environment [71], using ape and
ade4 libraries [72,73].
Metabolic network comparison

The metabolic network of each genome was predicted by
the "Pathway Tools" software [74] using MetaCyc [75] as a
reference pathway database (version 12.0). Starting with
the functional annotation performed in MaGe, this software applies selection rules to infer possible metabolic
pathways and builds a special database called a PGDB
(Pathway/Genome Database). These metabolic networks
for each R. solanacearum genome are directly available in
the MaGe graphical interface.From those data, a twodimensional matrix was built, wherein each line represents a Ralstonia genome, and each column a specific
pathway measure (according to the Metacyc metabolic
classification). Each value corresponds to a pathway completion measure (defined as the number of enzymatic
reactions which have been found in a given pathway
divided by the total number of reactions in this pathway
in Metacyc). This data matrix is the starting point of

Page 13 of 16

Principal Component Analysis, which highlights possible
metabolic similarities and specificities between the
genomes.
All R. solanacearum genomes were considered in this
statistical analysis, but only pathways with non-constant
completion could be analyzed. After examination of the
amount of inertia captured by the method's resulting factors, 2 axes were kept for further analysis (they represent
more than 67% of the total dispersion). For graphical representations, the variable (pathways) plot and the individual (genomes) plot were combined, restricting plotted
variables to those with a quality of representation greater
than 0.75, in order to conserve interpretability. Solely as
an additionnal aid to interpretation and to listing readability, for each factorial plane, the pathway variables
were hierarchically clustered according to the angles
between their vectors. The clustering method used a
Euclidean distance and ward's criterion; the number of
classes was chosen after manual examination of the cluster tree, and led to 8 classes for the first factorial plane
(see also Table S4-A).
CGH microarray experiments

The DNA microarray used in these experiments was generated by C. Boucher and collaborators (INRA-CNRS,
Toulouse, France). This spotted microarray consists of
6,516 65-mer and 70-mer oligonucleotides representative
of the genes identified from the genomes of R. solanand
acearum
GMI1000
[EMBL:AL646052.1
IPO1609
[GenEMBL:AL646053.1],
and
Molk2
[GenBank:
Bank:NW_002196569.1]
NW_002196564.1]. Each gene was represented by a single oligonucleotide except for 115 effector genes, which
were represented by two to six oligonucleotides to distinguish allelic forms of a given gene. A limited number of
oligonucleotides representative of particular intergenic
regions were also included on the microarray. This
microarray also includes a set of appropriate negative
controls. Each oligonucleotide was spotted twice on the
microarray. DNA extraction and labelling, and microarray hybridization were performed as described by Guidot
et al [16]. Standard control DNA used for all genome
hybridization experiments consisted of an equimolar
combination of the genomic DNA from the three
sequenced strains GMI1000, IPO1609 and Molk2. Analysis was conducted as previously described using ImaGene
and GeneShight (BioDiscovery) softwares [16]. A gene
was considered as absent from the tested strain when the
base 2 logarithm of the ratio of the normalized hybridization signal of the tested strain over the normalized
hybridization signal with the control DNA was lower
than the cutoff value of -1 [28].
