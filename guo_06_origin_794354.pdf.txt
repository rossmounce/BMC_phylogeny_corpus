Abstract
Background: The domestication of plants and animals was extremely important anthropologically.
Previous studies have revealed a general tendency for populations of livestock species to include deeply
divergent maternal lineages, indicating that they were domesticated in multiple, independent events from
genetically discrete wild populations. However, in water buffalo, there are suggestions that a similar deep
maternal bifurcation may have originated from a single population. These hypotheses have rarely been
rigorously tested because of a lack of sufficient wild samples. To investigate the origin of the domestic yak
(Poephagus grunnies), we analyzed 637 bp of maternal inherited mtDNA from 13 wild yaks (including eight
wild yaks from a small population in west Qinghai) and 250 domesticated yaks from major herding regions.
Results: The domestic yak populations had two deeply divergent phylogenetic groups with a divergence
time of > 100,000 yrs BP. We here show that haplotypes clustering with two deeply divergent maternal
lineages in domesticated yaks occur in a single, small, wild population. This finding suggests that all domestic
yaks are derived from a single wild gene pool. However, there is no clear correlation of the mtDNA
phylogenetic clades and the 10 morphological types of sampled yaks indicating that the latter diversified
recently. Relatively high diversity was found in Qinghai and Tibet around the current wild distribution, in
accordance with previous suggestions that the earliest domestications occurred in this region.
Conventional molecular clock estimation led to an unrealistic early dating of the start of the domestication.
However, Bayesian estimation of the coalescence time allowing a relaxation of the mutation rate are better
in agreement with a domestication during the Holocene as supported by archeological records.
Conclusion: The information gathered here and the previous studies of other animals show that the
demographic histories of domestication of livestock species were highly diverse despite the common
general feature of deeply divergent maternal lineages. The results further suggest that domestication of
local wild prey ungulate animals was a common occurrence during the development of human civilization
following the postglacial colonization in different locations of the world, including the high, arid QinghaiTibetan Plateau.

Background
The domestication of plants and animals has played a central role in the socioeconomic transitions from huntergatherer organization to agricultural settlement and
nomadic pastoralism in human history [1-4]. Domestication, giving rise to organisms with novel combinations of
phenotypic traits, was accomplished through human
selection for desirable genetic mutations from natural
populations. A better understanding of the genetic basis
of domestication will help to improve domesticated
organisms and open opportunities for new domestications. In addition, genetic evidence has revealed many
details, not available through archaeological studies,
about the origin and early history of the ungulate domestic meat animals, e.g. sheep [5], cattle [6], pig [7], horse
[8], goat [9], dog [10], donkey [11] and water buffalo
[12,13]. Elucidating the origin of domesticated yaks
(Poephagus grunnies) will extend our broad understanding
of the main ungulate domestications during the history of
human civilization. Domestic yaks are mainly distributed
in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the largest continuous high elevation ecosystem in the world, occupying
nearly 2.5 million km2 of the Asian continent and reaching an average elevation of more than 4000 m a.s.l. (Fig.
1). Both the climate and environments of the Plateau are
extremely harsh, its landscapes are barren and the biotic
communities are specifically adapted to the extreme conditions [14]. The costs of living here are severe, for example, the nutritional demands and capture costs are very
high while the physiological capacity to benefit from successfully procured resources is low [15]. The area is currently occupied primarily by nomadic Tibetan pastoralists
[14] and domesticated yaks provide the most important
resources (i.e., food, hides, dung fuel and transport
power) for them and other populations living here and in
adjacent high-altitude regions [14,16,17]. More than 14
million yaks are currently herded in the QTP and the adjacent Asian highlands (North India, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Mongolia and Russia) [14,17]. Morphological data indicate that yaks in areas outside China derived from Chinese
yaks [17]. The earliest recorded Poephagus fossils originate
from the lower Pleistocene [18], which is paralleled by the
estimated date, based on molecular data, of the genetic
divergence between Poephagus and its sister group Bison
bison around 1.8 million year ago (myr) [19]. It has been
speculated that wild yaks were first domesticated in Tibet
(Fig. 1) because the earliest evidence of human activity
and yak husbandry (Qiang Culture), dating from ca.
10,000 yrs BP, has been found in this region [1]. However,
because it is difficult to distinguish between wild and
domestic yak remains, this assumed domestication time
needs to be confirmed by further evidence. A yak pastoralist society was only well established in the QTP by ca.
4,500 yrs BP [16] and most researchers believe that the
yak domestication occurred not earlier than 10,000 yrs BP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/73

[17]. Therefore, there is still a lack of independent evidence regarding where and when wild yaks were first
domesticated [20]
Previous studies have revealed a general tendency for populations of livestock species to include deeply divergent
maternal lineages [5-11,21,22]. Such deep branching suggests that current breeds of some species may have been
domesticated in multiple, independent events from genetically discrete wild populations with a wide distribution
of wild progenitors [23,24]. However, in some species
with a limited distribution of wild populations, e.g., water
buffalo, there are suggestions that a deep maternal bifurcation may have originated from a single wild gene pool
[12,13]. These hypotheses have rarely been rigorously
tested, because of a lack of sufficient wild samples [e.g. for
cattle, [6]] and/or phylogeographic structure [e.g. for
dogs, [10]] although a multiregional origin has been convincingly shown for pigs by comparing DNA from domesticated pigs and wild boars from various areas around the
world [7]. Evidence for this kind of multiregional origin
has been obtained for a small domesticated animal, the
chicken [22], as well as for the large domestic animals
mentioned above. The ca. 15,000 wild yaks that still roam
on the plateau [14] (Fig. 1) provide unique opportunities,
unavailable for most other domestic animals, to analyze
the origins of domesticated yaks and to elucidate their
domestication process, especially the development of current maternal lineages.
We present here an investigation of mitochondrial DNA
diversity in domestic yaks reared across the QTP. We also
surveyed the corresponding DNA variation of 13 wild
yaks, eight of which were collected from a single wild population. This maternal sequence is better than other
nuclear marker in illustrating domestication events of
mammals because it avoids genetic introgression due to
hybridization between wild and domestic animals [e.g.
[9,10]]. Our main objective in this study was to obtain
genetic information on the evolutionary domestication
history of modern yaks. The specific goals of this study
were to: (1) characterize the maternal diversity of the
domestic yaks; (2) examine origins of the main lineages
and clades and their correlations with morphological
breeds; and (3) explain the probable domestication time
of this large animal in the arid QTP based on the genetic
calibration obtained in the present study and the available
archaeological data.

Results
Sequence variation and identified haplotypes
We sequenced mtDNA D-loop region of 250 domestic
yaks (see Table 1 for locations) and 13 wild yaks. We also
downloaded 25 sequences from GenBank [25]. Using
both our data and the published data, 113 variable sites

and 87 haplotypes were found in the total sample of 275
domestic yaks and 13 wild yaks. We identified 10 haplotypes in the 13 wild individuals. Only one haplotype was
shared by both domestic and wild yaks.
Phylogenetic analyses and networks of the major clades
Two deep lineages were identified by the NJ tree (Fig. 2: I)
and haplotypes recovered in domestic yaks clustered into
six divergent clades (Clades A, B, C, D, E and F). Among
them, clade A, B and C contained wild yak haplotypes.
This preliminary NJ phylogenetic relationship was further
tested by maximum parsimony [see Additional file 1],
maximum likelihood analyses and Bayesian analyses (Fig.
1). The aligned dataset for maximum parsimony analyses
including all 87 yak haplotypes and one Bison sequence
contained 637 sites of which 37 were variable but phylogenetically uninformative, and 51 were variable and
informative. Parsimony analysis identified 10000 trees

with 159 steps, a consistency index (CI) of 0.560, and a
retention index (RI) of 0.895. The 50 % majority-rule MP
consensus tree (Additional figures: SFig. 1) was basically
congruent with the ML tree (-lnL = 1803.55, Fig. 2: II)
based on the best fit model (K81 + I + G) although most
tentative clades did not receive high bootstrap supports
under both ML and MP analyses. Bayesian analysis with a
similar topology received moderate to high supports for
identified clades A, B, C and F, but failed to support the
other clades (D and E). However, all these analyses suggested that 87 haplotypes from both domestic and wild
yaks clustered into two well-supported lineages (Fig. 2).
This finding is consistent with findings of multiple lineages in most domesticated animals [e.g. [5-9]] as well as
previous researches of domestic yaks [25,26]. However,
the two lineages we detected contain haplotypes from
both domestic and wild yaks. Ten wild yak haplotypes
were distributed throughout the total tree. Six of them

Xinjiang. Clades A-E were found in nearly all geographic
regions, and at similar frequencies, in all populations
(Table 2). The similarity of the genetic variation among
regions can be further seen in the phylogenetic networks
of clades A-E (Fig. 3). In each of these networks there are
a few central haplotypes, found in most geographical
regions and at high frequencies, surrounded by less frequent types that are mostly unique to a specific region.

Geographical distribution of lineages and their
correlations with current breeds
Clade A occurred in all regions, Clade B in all regions but
Sichuan, and Clade C in all regions but Xinjiang. A total
of 56.4% of domestic yaks had haplotypes belonging to
Clade A and 87.3% had types belonging to Clades A, B or
C. Thus, these three clades constitute a common source
for a large proportion of the mtDNA variation in all
domestic yaks. Clades D and E were also found in all

There is also no clear correlation between the mtDNA
phylogenetic clades and the 10 morphological types
(breeds) of yaks sampled (Table 3), except that haplotypes
of the Huanhu breed nested within one of the two main
lineages, in Clades A and B. The haplotypes of all other
breeds were found to cluster within clades from both of
the two deeply divergent lineages. For example, individuals of the Tianzhu breed, which differ from those of the
other breeds in that they are white rather than black,

nested within Clades A, B, D, and E (Fig. 2). This pattern
suggests that mapping of morphology of each breed to the
maternal phylogeny is impossible because most clades
comprise more than one breed and some haplotypes were
shared by all morphological breeds.
Genetic diversity and expansion test
As summarized in Table 4, the nucleotide diversities
among the clades varied substantially. Generally, Clades
C, and E, had relatively low nucleotide diversity and Clade
A had the highest diversity. Assuming that domestication
of yaks and agropastoralism are likely to have resulted in
dramatic, sustained increases in the populations of both
the early herders and their herds, genetic indicators of
such expansion should be present in the DNA of modern
yaks. The star-like phylogeny of three large clades (A, B,
and C) is indicative of such rapid expansion following
domestications [27]. This demographic expansion
hypothesis was further supported by analyses based on

two separate procedures. First, each clade produces
smooth pairwise mismatch distributions (excluding wild
yak haplotypes) that are indicative of expansions [28]
(Table 4). Second, Fu's Fs test, which is particularly sensitive to population growth [29], detected significant (P <
0.001) signals of departure from neutrality in Clades A, B
and C, yielding values of -28.0, -14.2, and -6.6, respectively (P < 0.0001).
Molecular calibration
The coalescent time of two deep divergent lineages was
estimated around 131,000 yrs BP (under a constant population size model) or 109,000 yrs BP (under a exponential growth model) when the divergence between yak and
Bison was assumed to start around 1.8 myr ago under the
relaxed molecular clock hypothesis (see Additional file 2).
The mean substitution rate was calculated to be 14.6 %
per million years or 1 bp substitution per 11,000 years for
the analyzed 637-bp region when the constant popula-

tion size model was assumed. We used this mutation rate
to calculate the probable domestication time of yaks.
Since the domestications may have resulted in demographic expansion, the initial dates of such events can be
estimated using the average mutational distance from the
central sequence and the mutation rate [10]. Assuming
two origins from wild yak haplotypes for Clade A (the
resulting subclusters are indicated in Figure 3), the mean
genetic distances to their central nodes (0.76 and 0.44
substitutions with SEs of 0.09 and 0.12, respectively) give
estimated ages of 8360 ± 900 years and 4840 ± 1320 years,
respectively. Similarly, the estimated ages of three subclusters of Clade B are 5940 ± 900, 5500 ± 2420 and 4950 ±
1540 years, based on mean genetic distances to their central nodes of 0.54 ± 0.09, 0.50 ± 0.22 and 0.45 ± 0.14 substitutions, respectively. The estimated ages of Clades C, D,
and E are 6710 ± 1430, 8470 ± 3080 and 2750 ± 1430
years, based on mean genetic distances to their central
nodes of 0.61 ± 0.13, 0.77 ± 0.28 and 0.25 ± 0.13 substitutions, respectively. The estimated domestication timescales of all identified clades or subclades are much shorter
when the mean mutation rate under the exponential
growth model (19.3 % per million years) was adopted
(see Additional file 3). When the mutation rate of bison
(32 % per million years) according to the radiocarbondated sequences was adopted [30], the possible domestication and expansions in Clades A, B, C and D were dated
between 1200 and 3700 yrs BP (see Additional file 3).

Discussion
Maternal lineages of the domestic yaks and their origins
Evidence of deep maternal diversity has been found in
most domesticated ungulate animals [5-11,21,22]. Here
we present evidence for similarity divergence in yaks – one
important domesticated ungulate animal that had not
previously been analyzed in this fashion. The results,
together with those of the cited studies, suggest that
deeply diverged lineages might be a general characteristic
of most large animals.

We estimated, from our molecular calibration, that the
two main lineages in domestic yaks probably diverged >
100,000 yr BP (see Additional file 2), far earlier than yaks
could have been domesticated. Therefore, it is unlikely
that the deep divergence resulted from two lines derived
from different domestication events following separate
evolutionary paths. This raises interesting questions about
how such deep divergence may have arisen in the wild
population. According to theoretical modelling, the deep
maternal lineages detected may have originated either
from distinct wild populations or from a single large population containing highly divergent lineages [5]. However, here we provide robust evidence showing that these
two main lineages are also present in a single wild population, suggesting that their divergence occurred before
the domestication. This phylogenetic pattern suggests that
all domestic yaks may have originated from a single wild
population (or gene pool). Notably, only one haplotype
in the network was found within both wild and domestic
yaks, indicating that the wild yaks sampled in this study
are unlikely to be derived from domestic animals. Therefore, the first simple inference is that the size of the ancestral population was large enough to give rise to these two
deep lineages. Assuming a 3-year generation length in
yaks, a divergence time of > 100,000 yr BP suggests that
more than 300,000 reproductive females would have
been required for such deep divergence under the constant population size hypothesis. Both pastoralism and
other human activities (such as intensive hunting) have
greatly decreased the number of wild yaks during the past
century [14,17]. However, it seems unlikely that a population of this size was present at the time because the
number of wild yaks in the present QTP is only estimated
to be ca. 15,000 individuals [14]. Another possible explanation for the occurrence of two such deeply diverged lineages is that the glacial climate drove the wild yaks into
two refugia, where the populations diverged, then mixed
again in interglacial or postglacial periods. This is highly
possible since the estimated date of divergence (between

86,000 and 157,000 yr BP) falls well within the Quaternary. At this stage, the QTP was subjected to several cycles
of glacial and interglacial climatic oscillation [31]. Geological evidence suggests that during the maximum glacial
advance, an ice sheet covered an area five to seven times
larger than it does today [32]. The pollen fossil records
suggest that vegetation of the central QTP shifted alternately between permafrost-steppe and forest in response
to the Quaternary glaciations and interglaciations, respectively [33]. The lack of food might have driven yaks into
different adjacent refugia, and thus accumulate sufficient
divergence to explain the divergence we observed. However, when the climatic oscillation ended, wild yaks might

which of these explanations is the most likely.

have resulted in the mixture of the different lineages if
they had been domesticated at different times or in different places in or close to the wild distribution. Furthermore, the divergence of all the identified clades within the
two lineages seems to have been completed in the wild
population before the domestication(s). The three clades
that are represented in relatively small numbers of individuals (D, E and F) do not contain wild haplotypes, but
all of the three main clades (A, B and C) do. The four
former clades are situated at the base of the phylogenetic
tree, suggesting that their haplotypes have earlier origins
than those in the latter set of three clades. The failure to
detect corresponding wild haplotypes in the four small
groups (Clades D, E and F) is probably mainly due to the
small number of wild yaks sampled. Therefore, the morphological diversification of current breeds probably
occurred after stable pastoralist communities had been
established. These findings are consistent with the recent
hypothesis that the recent breeding events may have
played a substantial role in the evolution of morphological breeds of domestic animals [34], probably due to a
general relaxation of selective constraints in the wild animals [35].

We initially expected the maternally identified clades to
show a correspondence with the current breeds, because
these breeds have distinct morphological differences [17].
However, the data we obtained show no distinct correlations (Table 3), suggesting that the morphological diversification might have occurred late after their maternal
divergences, especially between the two deep lineages.
Similar situations have also been found in other animals
(such as chickens, [22]) and have been suggested to be
due to extensive interchanges between different maternal
lineages during trade migrations of human beings in early
herding history. However, such a hypothesis relies on the
assumption that the lineages derived from separate
domestications of different wild populations separated by
substantial geographical distances. For domestic yaks, the
mixtures of maternal lineages found in most morphological breeds are mainly due to the common presence of
both lineages in the wild populations and the limited distribution of wild yaks in the QTP. According to this scenario, any domestication event might have recruited wild
individuals from both lineages. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the high mobility of nomadic pastoralists could

Domestication of yaks in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
Populations near to a centre of initial origin are expected
to maintain more ancestral variation and to show higher
haplotypic and nucleotide diversity than populations
derived through subsequent migration colonization [10].
However, recent gene flow after domestication might blur
this genetic signature. The distribution of the seven
domestic phylogenetic clades shows that the total haplotype diversity is similar among the geographical regions.
This pattern might result from the frequent gene flow
among breeds and different regions after the domestication. However, both the total number of haplotypes and
the number of haplotypes unique to the specific region is
high in Qinghai and Tibet, which are closer to the current
wild distribution (Table 2, Fig. 1). After adjusting the frequencies to account for differences in sample sizes there
were also significantly more haplotypes and endemic hap-

lotypes in Qinghai and Tibet than in the other regions (P
< 0.05). This high diversity is consistent with the previous
suggestion by Qian [1] that the earliest domestication
events occurred in this region. Further details regarding
the probable evolution and spread of the haplotypes provided by the median networks also support this hypothesis (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic patterns indicate that
haplotypes of Clades A, B and C found in Gansu, Sichuan,
and Xinjiang derived from a subset of the Qinghai and
Tibet haplotypes. The regionally restricted occurrence of
Clades F and G may represent later introgressions of wild
yak sequences into the domestic population. However,
since these clades were found in only two and three individuals, respectively, it is possible that they were formed
together with the other clades and are also widespread,
but were not detected in the other regions because they
occur at low frequency. These findings suggest that (a)
domestication event(s) occurred at a place (or places)
fairly close to the centre of the wild distribution and the
initial mitochondrial gene pool then spread from the
region of origin to the other regions, the unique types subsequently forming in the different derived domestic yak
populations.
However, the available genetic data do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn on whether yaks were
domesticated in single or multiple events from the single
wild gene pool. Under the hypothesis that all current
domestic yaks might have originated from a single domestication, all clades should have similar genetic patterns
and expansion times because their wild founders probably originated in the wild populations before their domestication. However, Clades A, B, C and D expanded earlier
than the other clades according to our dating of the expansions of the presumed wild founders. Therefore, these
demographic differences seem to support an alternative
hypothesis that multiple domestications occurred from
the same gene pool at different times. However, we were
unable to discern how many wild haplotypes were actually involved in the founding of each clade due to the limited numbers of wild yak samples. The differences in
founding haplotypes would undoubtedly have affected

the network patterns of each clade and the consequent
dating. For example, the greater age of the first subcluster
(A1) in Clade A and its network pattern suggest that more
than one haplotype might have founded this subclade,
and further subdivision of A1 should reduce the current
calibration (Fig. 3). This dilemma would presumably be
resolved by the analysis of more wild and domestic samples.
Because of the great difference of the mutation rates
between the shorter and longer time-scales, it is difficult to
pinpoint the initial domestication time in animals [34].
This is probably due to the deleterious mutation accumulations and fewer purifying effects on the shorter timescales [36,37]. We firstly calculated the domestication
timescales under the molecular clock hypothesis (the substitution rate, 1 substitution per 40,000 years for the analyzed 637-bp region). Our initial calculations suggested
an unrealistic early dating of the start of the domestication
(between 10000 and 30000 yrs BP for five identified
clades). Because of the lack of the archeological sequences
in yaks, it is unlikely to obtain the actual pedigree mutation rate in this animal. The mutation rate of bison [30] is
probably unsuitable for yaks, because the dated domestication time (1200–3700 yrs BP, see Additional file 3) is
obviously shorter than the historical records of yak husbandry [38]). However, the timescales estimated according to the mutation rate calibrated between bison and yak
divergence under the molecular clock relaxation allowing
the terminal branches to have faster rates suggested that
the domestication of yaks probably occurred around the
early Holocene, within 10,000 yr BP [see Additional file 3]
This hypothesized scenario is more consistent with the
available archeological data for both colonization signatures of human beings in the QTP and yak remains. It
remains unknown whether the earliest human being who
colonized the QTP ca. 30,000 yrs BP had survived the Last
Glacial Maximum between ca. 20,000 and 15,000 yrs BP
[39]. The undoubted postglacial evidence of human colonization of the QTP was found in the north-eastern part,
in what is now Qinghai, at least ca. 12,000 yrs BP [40] and
in Tibet before 10,000 yrs BP [41]. These colonizers, pos-

sibly as well as earlier survived ones may have initiated the
domestication of yaks. The yak remains found in Tibet,
dating from ca. 10,000 yrs BP [1], might have suggested
the earliest domestication of yak. The archaeological
records further suggest that the abundance of yak products
increased several-fold between 10,000 and 5,000 yrs BP,
and by 4,500 yrs BP pastoralist communities were well
established in the QTP [38]. These findings suggest that
the yak husbandry might have grown rapidly after the initial domestication since 10,000 yrs BP. In addition, it is
interesting that this growth is closely correlated with the
rapid vegetation transition that occurred during the early
Holocene in the eastern QTP. It remains unclear why the
forests that recolonized this region postglacially were
quickly replaced by steppe and alpine meadow vegetation
[42], which has persisted to the present day. However, the
development of yak husbandry after the initial domestication may be one of the factors that caused the forests to
disappear and promoted the persistence of steppe and
meadow vegetation through top-down controls of the
alpine ecosystem.

Conclusion
The genetic evidence presented in this study suggests that
the deeply divergent maternal lineages characteristic of
most domesticated ungulates are also present in domestic
yaks. The presence of deeply diverged lineages of domestic
individuals in a single, small wild population was first
demonstrated in ungulate animals. This finding provides
robust evidence that deeply diverged lineages of domestic
animals may very well originate from a single gene pool,
rather than from genetically discrete populations.
Although our data do not allow definitive conclusions to
be drawn on whether yaks were domesticated in single or
multiple events, the molecular calibrations based on the
demographic expansion suggest that domestication may
have occurred within the Holocene, which is consistent
with the archaeological records. This elucidation of the
origin of domesticated yaks extends our broad understanding of the main ungulate domestications during the
history of human civilization. The practice of animal
domestication has long been believed to have first developed in the Near East [2]; however, available information
suggests that the practice reappeared in diverse locations
of the world. Both archaeological and molecular evidence
suggest that modern dogs were domesticated from wolves
in eastern Asia about 15,000 yrs BP [10], sheep and goats
from wild progenitors in the Near and Middle East around
10,000 yrs BP [5,9], cattle from aurochs in the Near East
about 10,000 yrs BP [6], domestic donkeys from two wild
progenitor lineages in Africa 5000 yrs BP [11], modern
pigs from more than one boar population in multiple
places across Eurasia since the Holocene [7] and domesticated horses from similarly distinct horse populations
across Eurasia since 4,500 yrs BP [8]. The cited reports,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/73

together with the present study suggest that domestication
of local wild prey ungulate animals has been a common
practice after the postglacial human colonization in
widely varying locations of the world. The early humans
tamed local populations of both widely distributed wild
species (e.g. boar) and locally endemic species (e.g. yak).
These early domestic animals then dispersed throughout
larger areas, or even across the world, carried by humans
during migrations or along trade routes. Despite the common general feature of deeply divergent maternal lineages, the demographic histories of these ungulate
livestock species are more complex and variable than previously thought. For yaks, more wild samples are needed
to clarify the development of the deeply divergent lineages
and clades in the wild yaks, while more archaeological
evidence will be helpful to elucidate the details of the
early domestication and migration of yaks.

Methods
Samples
We examined DNA from 275 domestic animals representing 10 breeds of yak (Plateau, Huanhu, Da Tong, Tianzhu,
Pali, Sibu, Jianli, Jiulong, Maiwa and Bazhou), including
sequences of 25 yaks downloaded from GenBank. The
breeds are classified by their morphological characteristics
rather than their local origins. Therefore, the domestic
yaks were subdivided into five geographical groupings:
Qinghai, Tibet, Gansu, Sichuan and Xinjiang. The tissues
of eight wild yaks were collected from one small population in west Qinghai, all of which died of unclear causes
in March 29, 2005. Materials for another five wild yaks
were collected from the Datong yak breeding facility
(Qinghai) and the museum of the Northwest Plateau
Institute of Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
which were captured or killed on the QTP, but no precise
details of the locations of the captures or kills are available
(for further information see Table 1).
Extraction, DNA amplification and sequencing
DNA was extracted from frozen muscle tissue, blood or
dried skin using a standard phenol-chloroform method
[8-10]. The mitochondrial D-loop region was amplified
using the primers YDF 5'-GTAAAGAGCCTCACCAGTAT3' and YDR 5'-TCCTGTAGCCATTGACTAT-3'. PCR amplifications were carried out in 30 µl reaction mixtures
including each primer (0.3 µl of a 10 µM solution), dNTPs
(0.7 µl of a 2.5 mM solution), 3 µl of 10 × buffer and 0.12
µl of 5 U/µl Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 4
min, 35 amplification cycles (95°C for 55 s, 50°C for 55
s and 72°C for 55 s) and a final extension at 72°C for 5
min in a Tpersonal Thermocycler (Biometra). PCR products were purified using a CASpure PCR Purification Kit
following the manufacturer's recommended protocol
(Casarray, Shanghai, China). Sequencing reactions were

carried out using a DYEnamic Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), also
following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.
Sequencing products were separated and analyzed using a
Megabase 500 Automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).
Analysis of mitochondrial sequence data
The sequences were manually aligned and new sequences
were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers
[GenBank: DQ138998 to DQ139260]. The 25 downloaded sequences are under the accession numbers [GenBank: AY521137–AY521161, AY722118 and AY749414].
One sequence of Bison (GenBank: U12936) was used as
outgroup. At first, we constructed a neighbor-joining (NJ)
tree of all the haplotypes under the Kimura 2-parameter
model using MEGA 3 software [43]. Then, phylogenetic
relationships of haplotypes were further confirmed by
maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses
in PAUP* 4.0b10 [44] and Bayesian analyses [45]. Maximum parsimony analyses (equally weighted characters
and nucleotide transformations) involved a heuristic
search strategy with 100 replicates of random addition of
sequences, in combination with ACCTRAN character optimization and MULPARS+TBR branch-swapping and
STEEPEST DESCENT options on. The program Modeltest
[46], was utilized to find the model of sequence evolution
that best fit data set by the hierarchical likelihood ratio
(LR) test for maximum likelihood analyses. Maximum
likelihood heuristic search parameters were simple addition sequence of taxa with TBR branch swapping, MULTREES and COLLAPSE. For Bayesian analyses [45], four
simultaneous Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) were
run for 5,000,000 generations, saving a tree every 1000
generations. Posterior probability (shown as percentages,
PP) for Bayesian analyses [45] and bootstrap values (BP)
[47] for MP trees assessed relative support for monophyletic groups. Burn-in, the generation time for each
parameter to reach the stationary state, was determined by
visual inspection of the log-likelihood values. We discarded the first 499 trees and collected 4501 trees (whose
log-likelihoods converged to stable values) to construct a
50% majority rule consensus tree with posterior probabilities with PAUP* v4.0b10 [44]. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 replicates using a heuristic search with
simple addition with TBR and MULPARS options on
(maximum parsimony) and a fast stepwise-addition
search of the maximum-likelihood genetic values
obtained (maximum likelihood).

At last, in order to investigate the possible relationships
among all sequences of each major clade identified in the
above analyses, median-joining networks were constructed using the program Network 4.1 [48]. Arlequin 2.0
was used to estimate nucleotide diversity values, parame-

ters and goodness of fit from mismatch distributions and
to compute Fu's Fs test of selective neutrality values [49].
Molecular calibration
In order to calculate the mutation rate for the studied
region of the D-loop, we extended to compile a separate
data matrix comprising all yak halotypes, seven sequences
(U12864, U12936, U12946, U12948, U12955, U12956
and U12959) of Bison bison (the sister group of yak, [19])
and one sequence of Bos incus (L27714, outgroup). This
matrix under the selected best-fit model of DNA substitutions [46] was subjected to maximum likelihood analyses
for molecular clock hypothesis tests. The hypothesis of
rate constancy was evaluated with the LR test by calculating the log likelihood score of the chosen model with the
molecular clock enforced and comparing it with the log
likelihood score without the molecular clock enforced.
The molecular clock was rejected because constrained and
unconstrained analyses differed significantly (HKY+I+G
with a 15.93 ratio for transition/transversion, -2 ln LR =
120.94, df = 94, P = 0.03). We therefore used Bayesian
analysis to estimate coalescent time of two deep lineages
and evolutionary rate, as implemented by the program
BEAST [50,51]. The molecular clock assumption was
relaxed by allowing the rate to vary throughout the tree in
an autocorrelated manner, with the rate in each branch
being drawn from an exponential distribution whose
mean was equal to the rate in its parent branch. Two population models (constant size and exponential growth)
were tested, and the final rate estimates from the two
models were compared. The mean mutation rate of the
model that yielded the highest posterior probability was
chosen. Following a burn-in of 5,00,000 cycles, all parameters were sampled once every 100 generation from
5,000,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps.
Convergence of the chains to the stationary distribution
was checked by visual inspection of plotted posterior estimates using the program TRACER [52], and the effective
sample size for each parameter sampled from the MCMC
analysis was almost always found to exceed 100, usually
by an order of magnitude. The divergence between yak
and Bison was assumed to start around 1.8 myr ago, based
on the fossil records and calibrations from the other
molecular sequences [18,19]. Thus we calibrated the phylogeny with a normal distribution prior (mean: 1.8 myr,
std: 0.2 myr) on the divergence time of Bison and yak.
Then we used our previous method to calculate the probable domestication time during the domestication expansion of each identified clade according to the estimated
rate [10]. Because the evolutionary rate is dependent on
the calibration point, mutation rates observed in pedigrees are higher than those inferred from the earlier species divergence times [34-37]. For a comparison, we
further used the mean mutation rate of bison, 3.2 × 10-7
(substitution/site/year), based on the radiocarbon-dated

sequences [30] to estimate the possible domestication
expansion timescales in each identified clade.
