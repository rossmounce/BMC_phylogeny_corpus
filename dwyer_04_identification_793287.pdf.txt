Abstract
Background: Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus are closely related members
of the B. cereus-group of bacilli. Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify
specific chromosomal sequences unique to B. anthracis.
Results: Two SSH libraries were generated. Genomic DNA from plasmid-cured B. anthracis was
used as the tester DNA in both libraries, while genomic DNA from either B. cereus or B.
thuringiensis served as the driver DNA. Progressive screening of the libraries by colony filter and
Southern blot analyses identified 29 different clones that were specific for the B. anthracis
chromosome relative not only to the respective driver DNAs, but also to seven other different
strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis included in the process. The nucleotide sequences of the
clones were compared with those found in genomic databases, revealing that over half of the clones
were located into 2 regions on the B. anthracis chromosome.
Conclusions: Genes encoding potential cell wall synthesis proteins dominated one region, while
bacteriophage-related sequences dominated the other region. The latter supports the hypothesis
that acquisition of these bacteriophage sequences occurred during or after speciation of B. anthracis
relative to B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. This study provides insight into the chromosomal
differences between B. anthracis and its closest phylogenetic relatives.

Background
Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is
responsible for a serious and often fatal disease of mammalian livestock and humans [8,22]. Its spore-forming
capability and highly pathogenic nature have made it one

of the most effective bioterrorism agents. Pathogenic
strains of B. anthracis contain two plasmids that confer virulence; the toxin-encoding 181.6-kb pXO1 [21,27,29]
and the capsule-encoding 94.8-kb pXO2 [12,27,42]. Loss
of either plasmid attenuates virulence. Environmental

isolates of virulent B. anthracis have been found to contain
some pXO2- cells indicating that spontaneous loss of this
plasmid may occur outside the selective pressures of the
host [11,41].
Bacillus cereus is commonly isolated from soil and has
been implicated in food-related diseases [9]. Bacillus thuringiensis contains plasmids that encode an array of gene
products including the insecticidal crystal proteins [39]. B.
anthracis, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis are closely-related
members of what has been referred to as the Bacillus
cereus-group. Comparison of their 16S rRNA sequences
place them within a range expected for members of the
same species [3]. In addition, DNA-DNA hybridization
[19,37] and pulsed field gel electrophoresis [14] studies
have revealed great homology between their chromosomal DNAs. Recent data obtained from multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis (MEE) and by multiple-locus
sequence typing suggested that B. anthracis, B. cereus, and
B. thuringiensis belong to one and the same species, and
that salient distinguishing of each member is due to plasmid-borne genes [15].
Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a PCRbased DNA subtraction method that enables the identification of genomic sequence differences between various
strains or species of bacteria. Tester DNA is defined as that
in which the differences are being sought relative to a
driver DNA. For example, SSH has been successfully used
to identify unique genomic sequences for specific strains
of Helicobacter pylori [2], uropathogenic E. coli [18,43],
and colonizing Campylobacter jejuni [1]. This technique
has also been used to detect unique genomic sequences
found in E. coli but not in Salmonella typhimurium [4], in
pathogenic Burkholderia pseudomallei but not in nonpathogenic B. thailandensis [36], in pathogenic Burkholderia
mallei but not in B. thailandensis [7] and in B. anthracis but
not in B. cereus 14579T, B. thuringiensis Al Hakam, or B.
cereus 3A [32]. This methodology has not only identified
genetic differences among different strains or species of
bacteria but also defined genes that contribute to the virulence of an organism. These virulence-related genes are
often localized on the chromosome. Such clusters have
been referred to as pathogenicity islands [13].
Herein we report the application of SSH to elucidate
genomic differences of B. anthracis in comparison to B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis, thereby identifying DNA
sequences that are unique to the B. anthracis chromosome. In contrast with B. anthracis described as one of the
most monomorphic species within the B. cereus group, B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis present a vast range of genetic
diversity. For this study we used the genomic DNA of B.
cereus 14579T or B. thuringiensis 10792T as driver DNA
because these are representive of the respective species. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/15

the subsequent screening of the B. anthracis-specific chromosomal sequences, we used several Bacillus sp. strains
more closely-related to B. anthracis [15,31,33]. The B.
anthracis-specific chromosomal sequences found elucidate genomic differences of these three closely-related
bacteria. These sequences can be exploited for the development of more stable and robust chromosome-specific
markers important for accurate identification of B. anthracis and unique from those previously reported [30-32].

Results
Screening of B. anthracis/B. cereus and B. anthracis/B.
thuringiensis SSH libraries
SSH libraries were generated using RsaI-digested genomic
DNA from B. anthracis strain 7700 (pX01- , pX02- ) as the
tester and either RsaI-digested genomic DNA from B.
cereus 14579T or B. thuringiensis 10792T as the drivers. All
clones derived from the B. anthracis/B. cereus (Ba/Bc)
library were given a numerical designation, whereas those
of the B. anthracis/B. thuringiensis (Ba/Bt) library commenced with an alphabetical designation. The subsequent
screening process used for selection of clones containing
B. anthracis-specific chromosomal DNA is outlined in
Table 1.

Forty four hundred Ba/Bc and Ba/Bt clones were prescreened for B. anthracis-specific sequences by comparing
duplicate sets of colony filters. One set was probed with 32
P-labeled tester sequences, while the other set was probed
with the corresponding 32 P-labeled driver sequences. Two
hundred and twenty-four Ba/Bc and 189 Ba/Bt clones displayed more intense hybridization when probed with B.
anthracis genomic DNA than with that of B. cereus or B.
thuringiensis. Recombinant plasmid DNA of the 413 SSH
clones selected was digested with RsaI, electrophoresed on
agarose gels, Southern blotted, and then probed with the
corresponding 32 P-labeled driver genomic DNA. Insert
DNA sizes ranged between 100–2000 bp, as predicted
from analysis of the frequency with which RsaI digests
each of these Bacillus genomic DNAs. Ninety-six Ba/Bc and
59 Ba/Bt clones had inserts that were undetected by the
driver DNA probe.
The insert DNA from each of these 155 candidate testerspecific clones was isolated, 32 P-labeled and used to
probe DNA blots containing the HindIII-digested
genomic DNAs of (1) B. anthracis strain 7700, (2) B. thuringiensis strain 97-27, (3) B. cereus strain 14579T and (4)
B. thuringiensis strain 10792T. B. thuringiensis strain 97-27
genomic DNA was used because it is extremely similar to
that of B. anthracis [15,16,28,32,33]. Thirty-two of the Ba/
Bc clones and 20 Ba/Bt clones detected sequences of B.
anthracis 7700 DNA only (data not shown).

were probed with the 32 P-labeled insert DNA of each of
the 52 clones found to be B. anthracis-specific after initial
genomic DNA blot screening. An example of this more
extensive analysis is provided in Figure 1, demonstrating
detection of sequence homology in the four B. anthracis
genomic DNA samples only when probed with the insert
of Ba/Bt clone E4. Clone E4 did not detect any homology
in any of the B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, or other Bacillus
species included on this blot.
A summary of the 52 clones tested in this manner is presented in Table 2 (see Additional file 1). Thirty-nine of the
52 clones were observed to be completely specific for B.
anthracis (highlighted in bold type). All probes but one
consistently hybridized and detected a similar pattern of
restriction fragments found in all four B. anthracis
genomic DNA samples which included pathogenic B.
anthracis strains RA3 and 7611. Clone 140 was the exception in that it detected some polymorphism in the restriction fragment pattern displayed in the B. anthracis
genomic DNA samples (data not shown). Thirteen SSH
clones did detect nucleotide sequences in strains other
than B. anthracis. Clones 14, 34, 140, O4, Z6, L7, and O7
hybridized with one other; clones 151, 227, G and R3
hybridized with two other; and clones A4 and K4 hybridized with three other B. cereus and / or B. thuringiensis
genomic DNAs on the survey blot, exclusive of the driver
strains.

Sequence analysis of B. anthracis-specific clones
Sequence determination and chromosomal location of B. anthracisspecific clones
The nucleotide sequence was determined for each insert
of the 39 clones that were found to be B. anthracis-specific.
Seventeen of the 39 clones demonstrated double, triple
and as much as quadruple redundancy, finally sorting
into 7 different RsaI-fragments (Table 2 and 3, see Additional file 1 and 2). Therefore, these 39 clones delineate
29 different RsaI fragments of the B. anthracis 7700 chromosome. BLAST analysis [24] sorted these 29 RsaI fragments into 6 different regions on the A2012 strain [34]
chromosome (Figure 2). Areas on the chromosome delineated either by 13 or more clones, 3 clones, or one clone
were designated as regions, clusters, or orphans, respectively. Regions I and II encompassed eight and thirteen
different B. anthracis-specific RsaI fragments that were
identified by thirteen and sixteen clones, respectively.
Three other locations were found to encompass two or
three different B. anthracis-specific RsaI fragments. Clones
81/231 and F7 define Cluster I; clones 230, 84 and 135
define Cluster II; and clones 9/49 and 221 define Cluster
III. Single B. anthracis-specific orphan clone M7 identified
the remaining chromosomal area.
Annotation of Region I and II delineated by the B. anthracis-specific
clones
Open reading frames (ORFs) overlapping and/or bordering B. anthracis-specific sequences were identified [26]
and the amino acid sequences derived from these ORFs
were compared to other protein sequences [25]. The
results of these analyses are summarized in Table 3 (see
Additional file 2).

Region I, delineated by 8 B. anthracis-specific RsaI-fragments and consisting of an area of 14.5 kb, contains 10
potential ORFs. Nine of these ORFs demonstrated

significant sequence similarity with genes encoding
enzymes and proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis or
export of polysaccharides in other bacterial species. The G
+ C content of the DNA encompassing the SSH-selected
sequences in this region was 32.1% which is not significantly different from that of the entire B. anthracis chromosome, reported to be 35.4% [35].
Region II, which encompassed an area of 24.5 kb flanked
by clones H4 and 150b, contains 40 potential ORFs.
Nineteen of these ORFs had sequence homology with a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/15

variety of bacteriophage-related gene products. Ten of the
13 B. anthracis-specific RsaI-fragments overlapped with
these bacteriophage-related sequences. No functional
match could be assigned to 21 of the potential ORFs interspersed with the 19 bacteriophage-related ORFs. However, detection of 13 of these potential ORFs by
overlapping SSH clones suggests they contain B. anthracisspecific DNA. Analysis of the flanking chromosomal
sequences reveals other bacteriophage-related ORFs 7.5
kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of this region, including a third ORF homologous to phage integrase gene
sequences. Outside of these limits, potential ORFs had
homology with housekeeping genes found to be conserved in other Bacillus species. For example, ORF
BA_1004, homologous with the YfjO gene (RNA methyltransferase) of B. subtilis, was found closest upstream,
while ORF BA_1064 homologous to the RocR gene (transcriptional activator of the arginine utilization operon) of
B. subtilis was found downstream. The G + C content of
the chromosomal region defined by these B. anthracis-specific clones was 35.3%. Again this is not significantly different from the average G + C content of the B. anthracis
chromosomal DNA. In the recently published genome
sequence of B. anthracis Ames strain Region II is contained
within the area designated " B. anthracis phage lambda
Ba01" [35].
Annotation of clustered and isolated genes delineated by the B.
anthracis-specific clones
Cluster III, encompassing an area of 30 kb, was defined by
2 B. anthracis-specific RsaI-fragments. This region contains
43 potential ORFs. Nineteen of the ORFs had sequence
homology with bacteriophage-related gene products.
Bacillus anthracis-specific RsaI-fragments derived from SSH
clones 9/49 and 221, overlapped 2 of these bacteriophage-related sequences. No sequence similarity could
be assigned to 17 of the 43 potential ORFs located in this
region, three of which had sequences that overlapped
with SSH clones. Also found in this cluster were 3 ORFs
(BA_4580/ YndN gene B. subtilis; BA_4583/ dUTPase;
BA_4585/ RspF gene B. subtilis) encoding B. anthracis
homologues for gene functions probably conserved in
most species of Bacillus. No SSH-selected clones mapped
to these genes. Analysis of the chromosomal sequences
bordering Cluster III revealed other bacteriophage-related
ORFs up to 2.6 kb upstream and 7 kb downstream. Two
ORFs that were homologous to a phage integrase gene
sequences were found, one in each flank. Open reading
frames outside of these limits demonstrated homology
with housekeeping genes found conserved in other Bacillus species. For instance, ORF BA_4538, the FtsK_SpoIIIE
gene, was found closest upstream; while ORF BA_4601,
homologous to the YlbM gene of B. subtilis was situated
closest downstream. The G + C content of the DNA
encompassing the SSH clone sequences mapped to this

third cluster was determined to be 35.0%. Again, this is
not significantly different from the average G + C content
of the remainder of the B. anthracis chromosome. Cluster
III is contained within the area designated " B. anthracis
phage lambda Ba03" of the B. anthracis Ames strain
genome [35].
Cluster I contains a bacteriophage-related sequence that
was detected by B. anthracis-specific clones 81/231, while
clone F7 sequences overlapped with 3 potential ORFs
encoding hypothetical proteins found to have no homology with any known proteins. These clones are contained
within the area designated " B. anthracis phage lambda
Ba02" of the B. anthracis Ames strain genome [35].
In Cluster II clone 230 was derived from an ORF displaying full-length homology with the wapA gene of B. subtilus

encoding a cell wall-associated protein. Clones 84 and
135, also located in Cluster II, overlapped potential ORFs
encoding hypothetical proteins with no known function.
Finally, orphan clone M7 overlapped with an ORF demonstrating homology to a gene encoding a Nitrogen regulation protein in B. subtilis.
Comparison with published B. anthracis-specific SSH-selected clones
A comparable SSH analysis was recently reported using
the genomic DNAs of B. anthracis as the tester and of
either B. cereus 14579T, B. thuringiensis Al Hakam or B.
cereus 3A as the driver [32]. Of the 28 B. anthracis-specific
clones reported only 3 share nucleotide sequences with 3
of the 29 B. anthracis-specific RsaI fragments presented in
this study (clones M. Ctg032, dhp61.183, and dhp64.188

respectively). Therefore, 26 of the SSH clones reported
here offer newly defined B. anthracis-specific chromosomal sequences. Five clones found in the other study
(dhp61.178, dhp77.002, M. Ctg037, R. Ctg177, and
dhp73.022) were proximal to (within the same ORF) 5 of
the B. anthracis-specific RsaI fragments listed in this paper
(clones 03, 5,198,150b, and 9/49, respectively). This
comparison is summarized in the last column of Table 3
(see Additional file 2), as well as the letter designation of
the corresponding genomic island. Thus, the genomic
islands designated as A, B, C, and E [32] correlate with the
locations of Cluster I, Region I, Region II and Cluster III,
respectively. In addition, clone dhp77.047 is located in
Region II upstream of clone H4, but within the confines
of the bacteriophage-related sequences (phage lambda
Ba01). Finally, clones dhp61.181 and R. Ctg152 are found

within the area of Cluster III with phage lambda Ba03
sequences [35].
Diagnostic screening of Bacillus strains by PCR
amplification using clone E4-specific primers
B. anthracis-specific clone E4 sequences were used to
design oligonucleotide primers for PCR screening of a
larger sampling of Bacillus strains. The expected size of the
anticipated PCR product was 235 bp. PCR amplifications
were performed on (i) 14 B. anthracis strains isolated from
different geographical locations and harboring both, one,
or neither of the pX01 and pX02 plasmids, (ii) 34 closelyrelated B. cereus and B. thuringiensis strains, including 14
Bacillus sp. Ba813+ transition strains, and (iii) a B.
mycoides strain (see Table 2). The same set of strains was
used to evaluate a B. anthracis chromosome-specific PCR
assay that exploited polymorphisms found in the rpoB

gene [31]. Without exception, all 14 B. anthracis strains
analyzed resulted in the amplification of the expected size
PCR product, while all 35 closely-related B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. mycoides strains analyzed did not yield any
significant amplification product. An electrophoretic representation of these results in presented in Figure 3.

Discussion
Two SSH libraries were generated that identified chromosomal DNA sequences found in B. anthracis and not in B.
cereus or B. thuringiensis. B. anthracis 7700 DNA was used
as the tester DNA, and total genomic DNA of either B.
cereus 14579T or B. thuringiensis 10792T served as the drivers. Progressive screening by colony filter and Southern
blot analyses identified 39 clones that were specific for the
B. anthracis chromosome relative to the driver strains of B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis and seven other more closelyrelated strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Since B.
anthracis 7700 is cured of all plasmids, only chromosomal
sequences were identified. The B. anthracis-specific clones'
insert DNAs were sequenced, mapped to the B. anthracis
chromosome, and annotated. Seventeen clones shared
insert sequence, resulting in a final count of 29 B. anthracis-specific RsaI-fragment inserts. Interestingly, four of
these seven redundant inserts were derived from both
driver libraries. The 29 insert sequences are distributed
over 6 different areas on the B. anthracis chromosome,
with 8 and 13 of them being found in Regions I and II,
respectively. Seven insert sequences were distributed into
3 clusters. The remaining clone was located singly on the
chromosome.
Region I contains ORFs that had significant similarity
with genes encoding enzymes and proteins involved in
cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. Typically in this
process, phosphorylated sugar molecules are first activated by conversion into nucleotide sugar derivatives.
Enzymes, such as epimerases and dehydrogenases, may
then modify these nucleotide sugar precursors into the
distinctive sugar subunit(s) characteristic of the cell wall
of a particular bacterial species. Transferases may then catalyze the sequential transfers of the sugar residues from
their nucleotide carriers to a membrane-bound acceptor,
usually a lipid carrier, forming the characteristic carbohydrate repeating unit. This first stage of cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis usually occurs in the cytoplasm at
the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. At this
point, an ABC transporter cassette may permit the lipidlinked carbohydrate-repeating unit to pass through the
membrane. This two-component system consists of a
translocation permease protein with membrane-spanning
domains and an associated ATP-binding protein that
energizes the permease.

In Region I potential ORFs BA-0356/7/8 and BA_0361/2,
demonstrating sequence homology to genes encoding an
epimerase and a dehydrogenase, respectively, were identified by SSH clones 190/N, Y4 and 142/I6. Potential ORFs
BA_0365/6 and BA_0371, detected by SSH clones 55/67/
212/235, 66 and P3, demonstrated sequence similarity to
genes encoding different types of transferases. Clone 190/
N and Y4 inserts also overlapped with potential ORFs
BA_0359 and BA_0360, which displayed significant
sequence similarity to other known ABC transporter
cassette proteins. The best match was with B. subtilis genes
tagG and tagH, involved in the translocation of cell wall
component teichoic acid. However, the corresponding B.
anthracis potential ORFs cannot encode equivalent functional homologs. B. subtilis cell wall-associated teichoic
(TA) and teichuronic acid (TUA) are absent in B. anthracis
[23]. The remaining potential ORFs (BA_0363/4 and
BA_0368/9 and BA_0370 detected by clones 201, 55/67/
212/235, O3, G and P3) in this region were found to share
homology with proteins involved in cell wall synthesis
whose specific functions are currently unknown. These
same ORFs were also found to be specific for B. anthracis
A2012 by whole genome comparison with B. cereus
14579T [17].
The Gal-NAG polysaccharide, derived from sugar components D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, has been
demonstrated by monoclonal antibodies to be uniquely
associated with the cell wall of B. anthracis and a few B.
cereus strains [10]. This result was also obtained for B.
anthracis pX01- and pX02-strains, indicating that the
enzymes and proteins necessary for synthesis and export
of this B. anthracis-specific polysaccharide are located on
the chromosome. It is possible that the Gal-NAG polysaccharide, or other components associated uniquely with
the cell wall of B. anthracis, are synthesized by enzymes
and exported by proteins encoded by genes specific to B.
anthracis. Such specific genes might be detected by SSH as
the genes associated with Region I have been. Substantiation of this hypothesis will require functional analysis of
the Region I genes. It is interesting to note though that
genes encoding cell wall biosynthesis proteins have been
selected in many other subtractive hybridization experiments [1,4,5,7,18,36].
Bacteriophage-related sequences dominated B. anthracisspecific Regions II and Cluster III delineated by 15 SSHselected RsaI fragments. Potential ORFs within and flanking Regions II and Cluster III included some identified as
bacteriophage integrases/recombinases. Such enzymes
could have facilitated the integration of these sequences
into the chromosome of B. anthracis. The putative ORFs of
Regions II and Cluster III encoding proteins of unknown
function may be bacteriophage sequences that have
degenerated beyond recognition by database comparison.

PCR analysis indicated that the clone E4 sequence of
Region II is conserved in and is specific for B. anthracis.
Also, phage lambda Ba01 and Ba03 sequences, which
include Regions II and Cluster III, respectively, were found
by comparative genome hybridization between the B.
anthracis Ames strain and 19 other members of the B.
cereus group to be absent in all but B. anthracis [35]. These
results suggest that acquisition of bacteriophage-related
Region II and Cluster III occurred during or after speciation of B. anthracis relative to B. cereus and B. thuringiensis,
i.e. during or after the acquisition of plasmids pX01 and
pX02, the distinguishing attributes of B. anthracis. The G +
C content of Region II (35.3 %) and Cluster III (35.0%)
do not differ significantly from the genome-wide average
of 35.4%. This indicates that these regions may have been
(i) acquired from bacteriophage with similar G + C content or (ii) acquired so long ago that they amalgamated
with the B. anthracis genome, attaining an indistinguishable G + C content by amelioration [20].
For the most part the remaining B. anthracis-specific
clones correlated again with ORFs encoding (i) cell surface molecules (detected by clone 230), (ii) other bacteriophage-related sequences (detected by clone 81/231),
(iii) conserved hypothetical proteins (detected by clones
135 and M7) or (iv) hypothetical proteins of unknown
function (detected by clones 81/231, F7, 84,135, and
M7).
In conclusion, the present study revealed differences
between the chromosome of B. anthracis and those of
eight strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. The general
differences were seen in genes that may encode proteins
related to cell wall synthesis and bacteriophages as well as
ORFs encoding proteins of unknown function.

Methods
Bacterial strains and genomic DNA preparation
The B. anthracis, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis strains used
in this study are listed in Table 2. The bacterial genomic
DNA was extracted by a method described elsewhere [6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/15

plates and two sets of nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) on LB/kanamycin plates. Filters were treated
with 10% (w/v) SDS, denature (0.4 N NaOH, 0.6 M
NaCl), neutralize (0.5 M tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl)
and 2X SSPE (20 mM EDTA, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH
7.4, 3.6 M NaCl) solutions for 5 min. each, air dried and
baked at 80°C under vacuum for 2 hrs. Filters were prehybridized in 5 × Denhardt solution at 65°C for at least four
hours before hybridization in 5 × SET (0.75 M NaCl, 0.1
M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM EDTA), 1 × Denhardt, 0.5 %
(w/v) SDS, 12.5% dextran sulfate, and 25 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65°C overnight. RsaIdigested B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis
genomic DNAs were labeled with 32 P (Random-Primer
Labeling System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and used to probe the two sets of colony filters
for each SSH library.
Plasmid DNA preparation and insert fragment isolation
Plasmid DNA was isolated from 1–5 ml LB or TB/kanamycin cultures by either the boiling miniprep method [38] or
the Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Insert fragments to be used as probes for genomic DNA blots were
separated from vector sequences on 0.7% agarose gels and
extracted by electroelution [38].
DNA blot analysis
One microgram of DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.),
subjected to electrophoresis in 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels
and transferred to Genescreen Plus nylon membranes
(New England Nuclear Life Science Products, Inc., Boston,
MA) as per manufacturer's instructions. DNA blots were
prehybridized and hybridized at 65°C in 330 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/
v) dextran sulfate and salmon sperm DNA at 25 µg/ml.
Filters were washed twice for 30 min. intervals at 65°C in
2 × SET, 0.5% SDS and autoradiographed.

Suppressive subtractive hybridization
SSH was performed using the PCR-Select Bacterial
Genome Subtraction Kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Generation of SSH libraries also required the use of the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) with vector pCR2.1 as per manufacturers
instructions.

Sequencing and bioinformatics
Each clone was sequenced in duplicate with the M13 forward and reverse primers using an ABI377 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Boston, MA) and the
BigDye terminator ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The nucleotide
sequences were edited and assembled with the Sequencing Analysis 3.0 and AutoAssembler 3.1.2 programs. The
SSH DNA sequences were subsequently localized on the
A2012 strain chromosome [24] and annotated [25,26].

Screening of suppressive subtractive libraries
Transformed E. coli TOP10F' cells were plated out on
selective LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing X-Gal,
IPTG and either ampicillin (100 µg/ml) or kanamycin (50
µg/ml) [38]. White colonies were streaked onto master

PCR amplification of the sequences identified by SSH
clone E4
The sequences of primer E4F (5'-AGC AAA AGC TAA CTG
CTC GGG-3') and E4R (5'-TCT ACC CCT TCA GGA TTA
GCG-3') were derived from SSH clone E4 sequences

found 235 bp apart. The PCR reaction of 25 µl consisted
of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.2), 75 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2
, 0.2 mM of dNTPs (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN), 1 µM of each of primers E4F and E4R, 0.05 U/
µl of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Corp.,
Foster City, CA), and 100 ng of genomic DNA template.
Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System
2400 (Perkin Elmer) and the cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 30 sec., 64°C for 30 sec., and 72°C for 30 sec.,
and finishing with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min.
The PCR assays were performed on 14 B. anthracis strains
isolated from different geographical locations and harboring any combination of the pXO1, pXO2 plasmids, as well
as 35 closely-related Bacillus strains, including 14 Bacillus
spp. Ba813+ strains (Table 2). The amplicons were electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) SeaKem GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) with 40 mM Tris-acetate-1 mM
EDTA (pH 8.3) running buffer and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.
