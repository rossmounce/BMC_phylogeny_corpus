Abstract
Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a prominent role in signal transduction and
cellular homeostasis in plants. However, imbalances between generation and elimination of ROS
can give rise to oxidative stress in growing cells. Because ROS are important to cell growth, ROS
modulation could be responsive to natural or human-mediated selection pressure in plants. To
study the evolution of oxidative stress related genes in a single plant cell, we conducted
comparative expression profiling analyses of the elongated seed trichomes ("fibers") of cotton
(Gossypium), using a phylogenetic approach.
Results: We measured expression changes during diploid progenitor species divergence,
allopolyploid formation and parallel domestication of diploid and allopolyploid species, using a
microarray platform that interrogates 42,429 unigenes. The distribution of differentially expressed
genes in progenitor diploid species revealed significant up-regulation of ROS scavenging and
potential signaling processes in domesticated G. arboreum. Similarly, in two independently
domesticated allopolyploid species (G. barbadense and G. hirsutum) antioxidant genes were
substantially up-regulated in comparison to antecedent wild forms. In contrast, analyses of three
wild allopolyploid species indicate that genomic merger and ancient allopolyploid formation had no
significant influences on regulation of ROS related genes. Remarkably, many of the ROS-related
processes diagnosed as possible targets of selection were shared among diploid and allopolyploid
cultigens, but involved different sets of antioxidant genes.
Conclusion: Our data suggests that parallel human selection for enhanced fiber growth in several
geographically widely dispersed species of domesticated cotton resulted in similar and overlapping
metabolic transformations of the manner in which cellular redox levels have become modulated.

Background
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen,
superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and
hydroxyl radicals, are generated by oxidative reactions and
other metabolic processes in cells and could have deleterious effects on growth and survival [1-4]. Naturally, cells
have evolved mechanisms to scavenge excess ROS to prevent cellular damage, including up-regulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms [5-8]. In addition to the
necessity of controlling excess potentially damaging ROS,
eukaryotes have harnessed ROS as signaling molecules for
a diverse array of regulatory processes, including
responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, regulation of
growth and development, and control of programmed
cell death [2-5,9-11]. Because of their important roles as
signaling molecules, as well as their toxicity at higher levels, ROS concentrations are finely tuned and developmentally regulated by a complex gene network (at least 152
genes in Arabidopsis; [2]), which collectively control and
modulate ROS metabolism [2,5].
Recently, several ROS-related signal transduction and
sensing components have been identified, including
kinases, calcium channel proteins and redox-sensitive
transcription factors [12-17]. The role of ROS has also
been studied in cell wall biosynthesis, where ROS have
been shown to be involved in lignin biosynthesis, crosslinking reactions between cell wall components, and loosening of cell walls in growing tissues [18-22]. ROS have
been proposed to be involved in regulating cell growth in
root hairs and pollen tubes, for example, via NADPH oxidases that control development by generating ROS and
regulate cell expansion through the activation of calcium
channels [23]. The role of Ca2+ flux in ROS signaling is
also well-characterized and involves calcium binding proteins, such as calmodulin and NADPH oxidases [24,25].
Stimulation of a Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm through
NADPH oxidase-derived ROS, and in turn, activation of
NADPH oxidase to produce ROS also establish a positive
feedback regulation maintaining growth in expanding
root hair cells [26]. However, exogenous application of
H2O2 attenuated the rate of root hair growth with a prolonged rise in Ca2+ after inhibition of growth [27]. ROS
may also alter cell-wall properties and participate in their
metabolism, as shown in vivo in radish seeds and maize
roots [19,28]. In young cotton "fibers", which are singlecelled epidermal trichomes, H2O2 appears to be important for the differentiation of the cellulose-rich secondary
cell wall, and H2O2levels are finely regulated [20,29].
Additionally, exogenous H2O2 levels are regulated by
redox status-related antioxidant enzymes including Cu/
Zn-superoxide dismutase (CSD) that localizes to secondary cell walls of developing cotton fibers and is involved
in cell wall growth [22]. Redox levels in cotton fiber cells
are important for stability of cellulose synthases, neces-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/378

sary for cellulose biosynthesis during fiber elongation and
secondary wall formation [30].
Since ROS levels are important to cell growth, the possibility exists that ROS modulation has been responsive to
selection pressure. The genus Gossypium is an excellent
model for studying the evolution of ROS modulation
because cotton fiber represents a highly derived modification of epidermal seed trichomes. These trichomes have
the experimental advantage of being single-celled and
readily detached for in vitro studies of gene expression or
for other purposes. From an evolutionary standpoint, trichome length, color and form vary considerably among
the ~50 mostly wild species in the genus [31,32], thus providing a natural system in which to investigate the evolutionary relationships between cell growth and ROS
modulation. Finally, Gossypium includes both diploids
and allopolyploids, of which four species (two diploid
and two allopolyploid) were independently domesticated
for use as feed and fiber crops [32] (Figure 1). This evolutionary context, and especially the multiple, parallel replicated "experiments" of domestication over the past ~7000
years, provide a unique opportunity to explore the connections between cell growth, natural and human-mediated selection, and ROS modulation.
Initial insight into these relationships has emerged from
recent comparative gene expression profiling experiments. In a comparison between a short-fibered, wild diploid species (G. longicalyx) and a domesticated diploid
cotton (G. herbaceum), Hovav et al. [33] showed that during fiber development several stress responsive genes were
up-regulated in the wild species, whereas ROS scavenging
and signaling genes were comparatively over-expressed at
the same developmental stages in the domesticated species. Analogous results were obtained in another microarray comparison in cotton, this time between wild and
domesticated forms of the allopolyploid species G. barbadense. In this latter study, a greater number of antioxidant and ROS signaling genes were up-regulated in the
domesticated accession early in fiber development,
whereas at the same developmental stages genes associated with ROS production were over-expressed in the wild
accession [34].
Here we build upon these earlier observations with new
analyses and experiments to explore the expression of
ROS-related genes during various evolutionary stages
encompassing several orders of magnitude of differences
in time, including ~5–10 millions of years of diploid species divergence, the diversification of wild allopolyploid
species over the past 1–2 million years, and two parallel
domestications of allopolyploid species approximately
5000 years ago [35,36]. We use high-resolution microarray methodology [37] to comparatively study gene expression for ~42,000 genes in diploid and allotetraploid

Evolutionary history of diploid and allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium). Phylogeny of the genus is shown, with the history of repeated domestication at both the diploid (n = 13) and polyploid (n = 26) levels. The ancestral A- and D-genome diploids are inferred to have diverged from a common ancestor ~5–10 million years ago, prior to genomic merger in a common
polyploid nucleus ~1–2 million years ago [32]. The newly evolved allopolyploid lineage subsequently diversified into five species
(three used for microarray analysis are shown). Two allotetraploid species, G. hirsutum (source of 'upland cotton') and G. barbadense (source of 'Pima cotton'), and the diploid species G. arboreum were domesticated by humans within the past ~7000
years [35,36]. In the present study, we used models of the two progenitor diploids, G. arboreum (A-genome) and G. raimondii
(D-genome), and both wild and domesticated forms of G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. We also included G. tomentosum, a wild
allopolyploid from Hawaii. A representative image of a single seed at maturation is also shown for each species, with attached
trichomes ("cotton fiber") with average fiber length (G. raimondii = 1.6 cm; G. arboreum = 3.0 cm; wild G. hirsutum = 2.0 cm;

cotton species at an early stage of fiber development. By
restricting our attention to ROS-related processes, we
hoped to shed light on how ROS gene expression may
have been altered in this single cell type during diploid
divergence and natural allopolyploid formation, and by
human selection pressure associated with repeated
domestication.

Results and discussion
ROS-related gene expression evolution at the diploid level
To explore the evolution of oxidative stress related genes
during diploid divergence, we assayed mRNA expression
levels in fiber cells from domesticated G. arboreum and
from wild G. raimondii at 2 days post-anthesis (hereafter
"dpa"). This comparison encompasses natural species
evolution in addition to human-mediated selection associated with domestication of the former species, which
has spinnable fibers that are several-fold longer than the
short, tightly adherent, commercially useless fibers of the
former species (Figure 1). Our rationale for exploring fibers from 2 dpa was based on our earlier observations that
oxidant and antioxidant genes are up- or down-regulated
early in fiber development [33,34], but not later. For
example, among the highest 100 differentially expressed
genes in a wild accession of G. barbadense at 2 dpa, more
than a third are potentially involved in stress-related processes; at later stages of fiber development, there were few
such genes [34]. Using a custom microarray, this analysis
revealed a high level of differential expression, using relatively stringent statistical criteria. Genes were considered
significant if the q values, adjusted for multiple testing
[38], were < 0.01 (Figure 1). Approximately 20% of all
genes were differentially expressed between the two species, with a relatively even distribution in terms of direction; that is, 4,175 genes (~10% of the genes on the array)
were up-regulated in G. arboreum, whereas 3,984 genes
(~9.5%) were up-regulated in G. raimondii. This observation of extensive expression evolution between homologous cells of congeneric species, on a 5–10 million year
timescale, is consistent with other recent comparative
expression profiling experiments [33], where ~22% of all
genes were differentially expressed in 5 dpa fibers of G.
longicalyx and G. herbaceum species, consistent with the
closer phylogenetic relationship of these taxa [32,39].

Among these more than 8,000 differentially expressed
genes, gene lists were filtered for biological processes corresponding to putative ROS producing, scavenging and
cell-signaling mechanisms based on GO annotations, as
reviewed in [1] and [2] (Table 1), yielding a total of 548
genes (251 and 297 up-regulated in G. arboreum and G.
raimondii, respectively; for gene list see Additional file 1).
Notably, up-regulated genes were asymmetrically distributed between the two species with respect to classes of
ROS genes. Many genes with antioxidant and transferase
activity, and potential ROS-mediated cell-signaling proc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/378

esses are up-regulated in G. arboreum fibers, including
'peroxidase activity', 'glutathione transferase activity' and
'epoxide hydrolase activity', and in contrast few genes
were categorized as contributing to ROS production. In
contrast, G. raimondii fibers had higher levels of expression for genes involved in ROS production, including 'glycolate oxidase activity' and 'H2O2 biosynthetic process',
but lower levels of expression for genes involved in ROS
scavenging (Tables 1 & Additional file 2).
The foregoing results show parallels with earlier studies
involving microarrays and cotton fiber development. Specifically, in comparisons between the diploid species G.
herbaceum and G. longicalyx, as well as for wild vs.
domesticated accessions of G. barbadense (Pima cotton),
some genes involved with modulating H2O2 and other
ROS levels were up-regulated in the accessions with longer
fibers [33,34]. As noted above, inhibition of H2O2 production or application of exogenous H2O2 acts as a signal
in cell wall differentiation in young cotton fibers, with
extended cell elongation correlated with activation of
antioxidant enzymes and premature formation of secondary walls being associated with increased H2O2 levels
[20,29].
In addition to genes likely to be directly involved with ROS
production and scavenging, many other genes may be
stimulated through ROS signaling cascades that ultimately influence gene expression. For instance, although
signaling molecules such as 'kinases' are known to be
important in many cellular processes, some play roles in
downstream signaling events associated with ROS. Serine/
theronine protein kinases for example, play a major role
in ROS sensing and the activation of MAPKs [40]. However, downstream signaling events associated with ROS
sensing involve calcium and calcium binding proteins
[24,25]. In addition, a number of transcription factors are
important components of the oxidative stress response
signal transduction network. These include heat shock
transcription factors, Zn finger proteins and WRKY transcription factors [12-15]. To search for the involvement of
these classes of genes less certain to be involved in ROS
metabolism than those directly functioning in the production and scavenging of ROS, we conducted searches based
on sequence similarity to angiosperm homologs (usually
from Arabidopsis), and identified several genes up-regulated in both G. arboreum and G. raimondii that become
candidates for having roles in ROS signaling (Table 1).
These, however, require experimental characterization to
substantiate a role in ROS signaling.
Modulation of ROS levels may also be linked to cell elongation, as indicated by the aforementioned work on
hydrogen peroxide levels and fiber elongation [20,29]. As
shown in Table 1, more processes involving antioxidant
genes (ROS scavengers) are up-regulated in G. arboreum

when compared to G. raimondii and vice versa for oxidant
genes (ROS producing). Thus, G. arboreum fibers may
experience less oxidative stress than G. raimondii fiber cells
at the same developmental stage, suggesting a connection
to the differences in fiber phenotype. This provokes the
speculation that some of the stress-related biological processes and genes that are up-regulated in G. arboreum have
achieved this through domestication.
As shown in Figure 2, up-regulated antioxidant genes in
domesticated G. arboreum also show up-regulation at the
protein level, validating our microarray interpretations.
Protein blot analysis with thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase
(tylAPX) and cytosolic APX (cytAPX), as well as Cu/Znsuperoxide dismutase (CSD), confirmed the up-regulation of some of these genes in G. arboreum in comparison
to G. raimondii during diploid divergence and domestication (see Table 2 for comparable APX and CSD microarray
results). In addition, co-expressed HSP70 genes in all six
species also show equivalent expression at the protein
level (Figure 2), providing additional support to the
microarray results.

Expression of ROS-related genes in wild allopolyploids
The observation that ROS-related genes are differentially
expressed at the diploid level between the long- and shortfibered diploids G. arboreum and G. raimondii prompted
us to test how differences were manifested in allopolyploids derived from the two genomes (A and D, respectively) represented by these two species. To explore this
question for ROS-related genes in allopolyploid cotton
fibers we utilized the phylogenetic framework represented
in Figure 1 and microarray data from three of the five naturally occurring wild allopolyploids, i.e., G. hirsutum, G.
barbadense and G. tomentosum, comparing mRNA abundances in these three species with 1:1 RNA mixtures of G.
arboreum and G. raimondii, which represent a mid-parent
value (MPV). We hypothesized that among allopolyploid
species, domestication will have the strongest effect on
ROS gene expression levels, whereas genome merger and
doubling per se will have a weaker effect because there has
not been human selection for increased fiber length; in
this case our null hypothesis is that gene expression levels
in wild allopolyploids should be, on average, approximately at the mean of the levels of the two progenitor diploids.

tionship to cell elongation [33,34], then, and in contrast
to the expectation for wild polyploids, domesticated varieties of the polyploid species would be expected to exhibit
evidence of this at the gene expression level. Additionally,
as noted above, two species of allopolyploid cotton, G.
hirsutum and G. barbadense have been independently
domesticated [32,35], thus allowing two tests of this
hypothesis.

Differences between the MPV and the three wild polyploid species (G. hirsutum, G. barbadense and G. tomentosum) led to varying numbers of differential expression in
each case (Figure 3), with 778 shared genes that were upregulated. These shared genes were thus inferred to represent the early effects of polyploidization, prior to speciation and later domestication. Categorization of these
genes into biological processes revealed no significantly
over-represented process related to ROS metabolism (see
Additional file 3), consistent with our expectation that
genome merger and polyploidization would not affect
ROS-related genes in the wild species. We explored the
data further for genes up-regulated in each of three wild
species as well as genes shared by any two of the three species (numbers shown in intersections in Figure 3). No
process related to ROS metabolism emerged for any single
species, whereas for pairs of species, there was a marginally significant up-regulation of 'oxidases' in wild G. hirsutum vs wild G. barbadense as well as wild G. barbadense vs
G. tomentosum (see Additional file 4).

To test this we used the microarray data to perform wild/
domesticated contrasts in both species. These analyses
revealed 777 and 498 genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in cultivated G. hirsutum versus its
wild counterpart, and 223 and 216 that were up-and
down-regulated, respectively, in cultivated G. barbadense,
relative to its wild accession (Figure 1). Assessment of biological processes corresponding to these differentially upregulated genes showed significant up-regulation of processes involving antioxidant genes in both domesticated
species (see Additional file 2 & Table 2).

An important pattern emerged from these comparative
expression data, namely, that shared processes between
the two species were often observed but that they involved
in different sets of genes. For example, the process 'perox-

idase activity' in G. hirsutum includes ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and thioredoxin reductase genes, whereas in
G. barbadense this process is represented by several peroxidase genes (see Additional file 2 &4). Similarly, different
sets of genes in the 'antioxidant activity' category were upregulated in the two species, i.e., catalase, glutathione Stransferases and thioredoxin in G. hirsutum, and peroxidases in G. barbadense (Table 2 & Additional file 5). These
genes have been shown to function as antioxidants, assisting in the regulation of ROS levels and contributing to cell
elongation under high redox conditions [8,29,41,42].
Our data suggest that parallel selection by humans operated on different genetic components of the fiber development program in G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, leading to
parallelism at the metabolic level and in morphology.
In addition to parallel up-regulation of ROS-related processes, our data also reveal possible examples of parallel
down-regulation. A case in point is for the process 'peroxide biosynthesis', which was down-regulated in the cultivated varieties of both G. hirsutum and G. barbadense,
suggesting that down-regulation of ROS production
accompanied domestication (Table 2). In addition to the
foregoing examples of putative parallel responses to
domestication, other ROS-related processes and genes
were significantly differentially expressed in one of the
two domesticated species. In domesticated G. hirsutum,
the biological process 'cyclin-dependent protein kinase
inhibitor activity', which harbors a gene for inhibiting serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to play crucial
role in ROS sensing [40], was down-regulated. This obser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/378

vation raises the possibility that domestication entailed
an repression of kinase inhibitor genes, enhancing the
potential of a growing cell to sense toxic ROS levels and
activate downstream processes to maintain optimal concentration. In domesticated G. barbadense, the processes
'superoxide dismutase' and 'carotenoid biosynthetic process' were down-regulated, both known to be important in
ROS scavenging (Table 2) [6,41]. The microarray based
interpretations were also confirmed with comparable
results at protein level for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase
(CSD) and tylAPX and cytAPX for wild and domesticated
G. hirsutum and G. barbadense (Figure 2). Comparable to
microarray data, higher levels of CSD is observed in wild
G. barbadense in comparison to domesticated G. barbadense (Figure 2). However, although CSDs transcript
levels in domesticated G. hirsutum are up-regulated in
comparison to wild G. hirsutum (see Additional file 2),
this is not observed in the protein blots (Figure 2). This
inconsistency could be a result of antibodies cross-reacting with only some but not all of the CSD gene products,
potentially not reacting with the specific CSD transcripts
up-regulated in domesticated G. hirsutum, as well as differences in post-translational modification, or other factors.
ROS-related genes and parallel domestication across
ploidy levels and continents
Because cotton domestication involved in two different
allopolyploid species in the New World as well as two different diploid species in the Old World [32,36], a naturally replicated "experiment" of domestication provides
the opportunity to evaluate potential parallelisms in ROSrelated responses across ploidy levels and continents. To
explore parallel recruitment of genes during domestication at the diploid and polyploid levels, we tabulated the
differentially expressed genes (up-and down-regulated)
that were shared between G. arboreum and domesticated G.
hirsutum as well as between G. arboreum and domesticated
G. barbadense (marked by asterisks in Additional file 2). A
total of 178 and 38 shared genes were up-regulated and
102 and 22 were down-regulated in G. arboreum with G.
hirsutum and G. arboreum with G. barbadense in comparisons to their wild relatives, respectively. Up-regulated
genes shared by G. arboreum and G. hirsutum belong
mainly to ROS scavenging classes, including glutathione
S-transferase and ascorbate peroxidases (see Additional
file 2), but also include putative ROS signaling genes such
as serine/threonine kinase (see Additional file 5). Up-regulation in G. arboreum and G. hirsutum suggests that selection during domestication for agronomically more
favorable fiber phenotypes resulted, in parallel, in the
enhanced expression of similar genes. In contrast, G. raimondii and wild G. hirsutum have low levels of expression
of these same genes, correlated with their much shorter
fibers and temporally compressed development (Figure
4a) [31].

ment of ROS scavenging and signaling genes in one
diploid and two different polyploid species. Although this
is true at the level of biological process, or perhaps metabolism, it is clear that the genesis of these similarities is
only partially congruent at the genetic level. That is, different sets of antioxidant genes are up-regulated in the
domesticates. This repeated metabolic transformation
accompanying domestication would appear to be without
precedent. An exciting prospect for future work will be to
dissect this physiological parallelism into its responsible
constituent genes, and to learn the mutational basis of
their altered regulation or function. Notwithstanding our
ignorance of the specific function of most of the genes
implicated as important in this study, a generality emerges
that the avoidance or delay of stress-like processes in
domesticated species may play a large role in the enhance
elongation of fibers in cultivated compared to wild forms,
in conjunction with an increased ability to modulate cellular redox balance in the growing cell. It would be interesting to explore whether similar trends in the evolution
of ROS gene expression accompanied the domestication
of other crops and for other traits, for example tolerance
to stressed environmental conditions or to enhanced
growth of other organs.

Methods
Shared up-regulated genes between G. arboreum and
domesticated G. barbadense include a suite of peroxidase
genes (see Additional file 2). These genes encode an
important class of ROS-regulating enzymes, which eliminate toxic molecules generated as a byproduct of aerobic
respiration [29]. As shown in Figure 4b, expression levels
of peroxidase genes in domesticated G. barbadense were
similar to those of G. arboreum, suggesting once again parallel selection under domestication at the diploid and
polyploid levels.

Conclusion
The present study implicates an oxidative stress responsive
gene network as being involved in the evolution of elongated epidermal seed trichomes, providing the foundation for later human domestication of an important crop
plant. We provide clues here into ROS related genes that
may have been selected by humans, starting with initial
domestication of wild perennial thousands of years ago,
through the development of modern elite lines. Notably,
the majority of up-regulated ROS-related processes are
diagnosed as having become enhanced during domestication, at both the diploid and polyploid levels, as opposed
to being a result of allopolyploid formation per se. This
suggestion that expression evolution of oxidative stress
related genes was primarily concomitant with domestication is bolstered by the remarkable observation that independent parallel domestication events, taking place in
different hemispheres thousands of years ago under aboriginal human selection pressure, led to parallel recruit-

Plant materials, RNA isolation and microarray
preparation
Three biological replicates of seven Gossypium accessions
were grown in the Pohl Conservatory at Iowa State University, Ames, IA: G. arboreum, G. raimondii, a wild form of
G. hirsutum (accession TX2094), a domesticated form of
G. hirsutum (accession TM1), a wild form of G. barbadense
(accession K101), a domesticated form of G. barbadense
(accession Pima S-7) and G. tomentosum. Because truly
wild, as opposed to feral, forms of G. barbadense are difficult to verify, we selected the accession used based on earlier allozyme analysis (Percy and Wendel, 1990) and its
relatively primitive morphology. These accessions include
representatives of both diploid progenitor genomes ("A"
and "D") of allopolyploid cotton [32](Figure 1), and both
wild and domesticated forms of allopolyploid cotton (G.
hirsutum and G. barbadense).

Flowers were tagged at anthesis and harvested at 2 days
post-anthesis. For each of three biological replicates,
ovules were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at -80°C. RNA extractions were performed following a
modified hot borate procedure optimized for Gossypium
[43]. From each pair of A2 and D5 replicates, an equimolar
RNA mix (1:1 mix) was also generated to estimate midparent expression values (MPV). RNA samples were
amplified with the TargetAmpTM 1-Round aRNA Amplification kit from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison,
WI) and quantified and assessed for degradation using a
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All

amplified RNA samples were sent to NimbleGen Systems
(Madison, WI) for cDNA synthesis, labeling, and hybridization to custom microarrays developed from an assembly of cotton ESTs [37]. This custom microarray platform
has the ability to measure homoeolog-specific gene
expression for ~1500 genes in the allotetraploids, as well
as overall gene expression for 42,429 unigenes.
Microarray data processing and statistical analysis
Raw data values for each gene were natural-log transformed, median-centered, and quantile-normalized
across all arrays. Following normalization, contig-level
log ratio values were determined by calculating an average
of log ratio values from 7 probes per gene for a total of
42,429 genes, using Tukey's biweight method [44,45]. A
linear model as described [34], including effects for replication and genotype, was fitted to these contig-level data,
allowing the estimation of all possible contrasts between
G. arboreum, G. raimondii, their 1:1 mix, wild G. hirsutum,
domesticated G. hirsutum, wild G. barbadense, domesticated G. barbadense and G. tomentosum. For each gene, differences were calculated using pair-wise contrasts between
A2 vs D5, wild G. hirsutum vs 1:1 mix, wild G. barbadense vs
1:1 mix, G. tomentosum vs 1:1 mix, wild G. hirsutum vs
domesticated G. hirsutum and wild G. barbadense vs
domesticated G. barbadense. The 42,429 p-values from
each comparison were converted to q-values using the
method of [38]. These q-values were used to identify the
number of differentially expressed genes for a given comparison when controlling for a false discovery rate (FDR)
of 0.01. Blast2GO http://www.blast2go.de was used to
infer biochemical pathways involved in a given comparison and to calculate statistical significance. The expression
values for microarray experiments have been submitted to
the database with following accession numbers:
GSM432872; GSM432873; GSM432874; GSM432875;
GSM432876; GSM432877; GSM432878; GSM432879;
GSM432880; GSM432881; GSM432882; GSM432883;
GSM432884; GSM432885; GSM432886; GSM432887;
GSM432888; GSM432889.
Validation of microarray results with massARRAY
To confirm the microarray-based interpretations, we used
an application of a mass ARRAY based validation technique. The robustness of mass ARRAY technique has been
demonstrated showing high correlation with RT-PCR
[46]. We checked 18 randomly selected genes at 2 dpa in
three biological replicates for homoeolog contributions to
the transcriptome for domesticated G. hirsutum samples
(for details of validation design, see Supplementary methods in Additional file 6). The mean value for each of three
replicates was determined and compared with the estimates derived from the homoeolog-specific microarray.
The correlation between SNP-specific microarray and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/378

mass ARRAY-based techniques is shown with high R2
value (0.84) at p-value < 0.001 in Additional file 6.
Protein blot analysis
Cotton fibers were mechanically separated from frozen
ovular tissue using a modified liquid nitrogen and glass
bead shearing procedure [47]. Total protein samples were
extracted using a phenol-ammonium acetate/methanol
method [48]. Briefly, ~250 mg of crushed fiber tissue was
dissolved in extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, (pH
8.8), 10 mM EDTA, 900 mM sucrose, 0.4% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4°C. The proteins were precipitated overnight with ammonium acetate/methanol solution at 20°C and the pellet, collected by centrifugation, was
washed with ice-cold ammonium acetate/methanol (100
mM ammonium acetate in 100% methanol) and 80%
acetone and dried. The total proteins pellets were solubilized into 1× Laemmli sample buffer (0.0625 M Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol)
and stored at -20°C until analysis. Protein gel blots were
preformed as described [7]. Antibodies against cytosolic
and chloroplastic APXs (ascorbate peroxidase) were
obtained using a domain conserved to these proteins (a
fragment of thylakoid APX from Lys100 to Ile341) as
described in [49]. Antibodies against Cu/Zn-superoxide
dismutase (CSD) was obtained from Agrisera (Vannas,
Sweden) and that against HSP70 was prepared as
described by [50] using purified proteins as antigens. Primary rabbit antibodies were used in a 1:3000 dilution
while secondary goat anti rabbit antibodies conjugated to
horse radish peroxidase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were
used at a 1:20,000 dilution. ECL™ chemiluminescent
detection (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK)
was performed as described in [7].
