Abstract
Background: In plants the hormone cytokinin is perceived by members of a small cytokinin
receptor family, which are hybrid sensor histidine kinases. While the immediate downstream
signaling pathway is well characterized, the domain of the receptor responsible for ligand binding
and which residues are involved in this process has not been determined experimentally.
Results: Using a live cell hormone-binding assay, we show that cytokinin is bound by a receptor
domain predicted to be extracellular, the so called CHASE (cyclases, histidine kinase associated
sensory extracellular) domain. The CHASE domain occurs not only in plant cytokinin receptors but
also in numerous orphan receptors in lower eukaryotes and bacteria. Taking advantage of this fact,
we used an evolutionary proteomics approach to identify amino acids important for cytokinin
binding by looking for residues conserved in cytokinin receptors, but not in other receptors. By
comparing differences in evolutionary rates, we predicted five amino acids within the plant CHASE
domains to be crucial for cytokinin binding. Mutagenesis of the predicted sites and subsequent
binding assays confirmed the relevance of four of the selected amino acids, showing the biological
significance of site-specific evolutionary rate differences.
Conclusion: This work demonstrates the use of a bioinformatic analysis to mine the huge set of
genomic data from different taxa in order to generate a testable hypothesis. We verified the
hypothesis experimentally and identified four amino acids which are to a different degree required
for ligand-binding of a plant hormone receptor.

Background
The plant hormone cytokinin is required for many fundamental processes and developmental programmes such as
cell division, shoot branching, root development and
senescence [1]. For the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana it
has been shown that the cytokinin signal is perceived by

members of the cytokinin receptor family, which are sensor histidine kinases [2-4]. Mutational analysis of the
three cytokinin receptors (AHK2, AHK3, CRE1/AHK4)
revealed that they act redundantly, but are absolutely
required for normal cytokinin perception and plant
growth [5-8]. In the current model, it is predicted that the

hormone binds to the Arabidopsis histidine kinase receptors (AHKs) via an extracellular ligand binding domain,
the so-called CHASE (cyclases/histidine kinases associated sensory extracellular) domain [9,10]. The CHASE
domain, about 250 amino acids long, is exclusively found
between two transmembrane regions as the N-terminal
part of adenylyl cyclases, diguanylate cyclases or histidine
kinases in a number of eukaryotes and numerous bacteria.
It includes, for example, the spore differentiation factor,
DhkA, and the osmosensing receptor-adenylyl cyclase
ACG, which regulates spore dormancy, from the slime
mold Dictyostelium discoideum. DhkA recognizes a small
peptide, SDF-2 [11], and it was proposed that ACG binds
discadenine [12]. Thus the CHASE domain is believed to
bind diverse low molecular weight ligands. However, the
ligand and its cognate receptor are only known in a few
cases. Among higher eukaryotes the domain is found only
in plants as part of specific sensor histidine kinases, the
cytokinin receptors. It was proposed that plants acquired
the CHASE domain through their chloroplasts, which
have a cyanobacterial ancestry [9,10].
The binding of cytokinin to the receptor is thought to
cause a conformational change leading to the autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue in the
cytosolic part of the receptor. Subsequently, the signal is
transferred to a canonical aspartate within the C-terminal
part of the protein and transduced further by a multi-step
two-component signaling system (for recent reviews see
[13-15]).
The cytokinin binding activity of full-length CRE1/AHK4
was shown before by several different types of assays
[3,4,16,17]. Although the CHASE domain is suspected of
being the ligand binding domain, no systematic approach
has been made with any cytokinin receptor to identify the
binding domain unequivocally. Once a binding domain
has been determined, the next step of the characterization
is to identify functional amino acid residues. In this report
we describe a novel knowledge-based approach that uses
sequence information from distantly related organisms to
predict putative functionally relevant sites in the ligand
binding domain. The bioinformatics method was based
on detecting differences in the evolution of individual
amino acid sites between the CHASE domains of the different protein subclasses. The underlying premise was that
a slower evolutionary rate of a given amino acid position,
e.g. the conservation of a different amino acid in plants
versus other organisms, would identify important positions for receptor function. These positions are putatively
important in binding the plant-specific ligand, which is
thought to be different from the other subgroups.
Thus the aims of this study were twofold: (i) mapping of
the ligand binding domain of CRE1/AHK4 and (ii) iden-

tifying amino acids crucial for the binding of cytokinin to
the receptor. Using a binding assay we provide direct
experimental evidence that cytokinin is bound via the
CHASE domain of CRE1/AHK4. The substitution of four
of the five amino acids, which were predicted by evolutionary analysis to be important for a functional ligandbinding domain, caused a clear change in the ligand binding, in this case a complete loss of, or strongly reduced,
cytokinin binding. This demonstrates the power of combining bioinformatic predictions with experimental validation, which have been proven to be a very useful tool in
other subjects in the past [18,19]. Thus the data further
underpin the general potential of evolutionary proteomics to identify functionally relevant sites in proteins of
known or even of unknown function.

Results
CRE1/AHK4 binds cytokinin via the CHASE domain
The cytokinin binding domain of CRE1/AHK4 was
mapped by expressing the cytoplasmic part or the CHASE
domain with the adjacent transmembrane domains as
GST-fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 1A). The cytokinin
binding capacity was tested in an in vivo binding assay
[17] and compared to the binding capacity of the fulllength protein in the same experimental setup. The fulllength protein showed the highest relative trans-zeatin
binding (Fig. 2). The binding capacity was slightly lower
in the truncated version of CRE1/AHK4 consisting of the
CHASE domain and the flanking transmembrane
domains. The cytoplasmic domain and the empty vector
control showed very weak or no binding (Fig. 2). The
results of the binding assay indicate that the CHASE
domain is the cytokinin binding domain of CRE1/AHK4.
Evolutionary analysis of CHASE-subclasses reveals
putative cytokinin-binding residues
Sequences containing the CHASE domain were identified
in plants, slime-molds, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria
and a multiple sequence alignment was generated for the
region spanning the domain (Figure 3B and Additional
file 1; for details see Material and Methods). The phylogenetic tree reveals several distinct subgroups, one of which
includes all plant sequences (Figure 3A). Our computational approach to identify functional important positions is based on the assumption that CHASE domains
found in plants recognize a different class of ligands (cytokinin) than bacterial domains and that these functional
differences can be detected by a change in evolutionary
rates of amino acid substitutions. A candidate position
should have a slow evolutionary rate in plants and a fast
evolutionary rate in other subgroups or a slow evolutionary rate in all subgroups, but then the subgroups should
be conserved in a different amino acid to distinguish the
plant sequences from bacterial sequences. The slime-mold
sequences were not included in this analysis because their

subgroup contained only two sequences and was not supported by a high bootstrap value. Among the positions
that were derived from the analysis of bacterial and plant
sequences and fulfilled the above criteria we selected five
positions, which show the strongest evidence for functional divergence and thus, are likely to be important in
cytokinin binding: Position T317 of CRE1/AHK4 is not
only slowly evolving among plant sequences but also
among all investigated bacterial subgroups (evolutionary
site rate category 1; Fig. 3B). However, in each subgroup,
this site is occupied by a different amino acid with varying
biochemical properties. Only in the plant subgroup, this
position is occupied by an amino acid with a hydroxyl
containing side chain (threonine). The evolutionary rate
of CRE1/AHK4 positions W244 and K297 is very low in
the plant CHASE sequences compared to that of the
CHASE domains of the other subgroups, indicating that
these positions might be important in plants. The amino
acids at positions 304 and 305 have different biochemical
properties and evolutionary rates in the different subgroups (Fig. 3B). Position 304 is occupied by phenylalanine only in the plant sequences while the bacterial
subgroups have mostly aliphatic amino acids as a residue
in this position. At position 305, the plant subgroup has
either a basic amino acid or a proline, while in the other
subgroups the class of amino acids is not conserved. It

should be noted that position 301, a functional important
residue of the CRE1/AHK4 CHASE domain, did not fulfil
our criteria, because some bacterial sequences are conserved in the same or a similar amino acid. In fact, an
allele mutated in this position, which leads to an amino
acid change to isoleucine, is known as wooden leg (wol)
and was discovered in a screen for altered root morphology [20]. Subsequent analysis of this only known mutation of the CHASE domain in plants revealed the
complete loss of cytokinin binding of the mutant protein
[4]. We included this mutation as a positive control in our
analysis.
Specific amino acid substitutions lead to significant
changes in cytokinin binding
The selected amino acids were substituted by alanine.
Subsequently the ability of the mutated CHASE domains
as part of the full length protein was tested for cytokinin
binding activity. As controls, the wild-type CRE1/AHK4
protein showed strong cytokinin binding, while the
empty vector did not show any cytokinin binding in the
assay (Fig. 4A). We also confirmed that the known mutation (T301I) in the CHASE domain causes loss of cytokinin-binding activity [4] (Fig. 4A). In contrast and as
expected, the substitution of the canonical histidine of the
cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain by glutamine

(H482Q), which abolishes the receptor's signaling capacity [21], does not alter the cytokinin binding capacity of
the receptor (Fig. 4A).
Two of the candidate residues, namely F304A and T317A
led to a complete abolishment of ligand binding (Fig. 4A).
Two other amino acid substitutions – W244A and R305A
– resulted in strongly reduced binding capacity, approximately 60% and 40% of the CRE1/AHK4 wild-type control, respectively (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the substitution of
K297A caused only a slight decrease of the cytokinin binding of the mutant protein compared to the wild-type
CRE1/AHK4. The protein level of all GST-fusion proteins
was checked by Western blot and did not show significant
differences (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
CRE1/AHK4 binds cytokinin via the CHASE domain
In this study we investigated how the plant hormone cytokinin is recognized by its receptor. It has been hypothesized that cytokinin is bound by the CHASE domain of
the receptors [2-4,9,10], but no experiment has been performed to prove this hypothesis. Testing truncated versions of a protein for activity is a first step to delineate
those parts of the protein important for the investigated
function [22-24]. The binding assays using the full-length
and several truncated versions of CRE1/AHK4 (Fig. 2)
confirm the hypothesis that trans-zeatin is bound by
CRE1/AHK4 via the CHASE domain. This is relevant as
cytokinin occurs also inside the plant cell and it could be,
therefore, possible that cytokinin is bound also via the

data show that this possibility is not realized in CRE1/
AHK4.
Bioinformatic analysis identifies residues that are crucial
for a functional ligand binding domain
Functional important amino acid positions are often predicted by combining evolutionary information of a protein family with 3D structures. The underlying
assumption is, if a position adopts a new beneficial func-

tion, it will be subject to stronger selective constraint,
which will be reflected in the evolutionary rates of amino
acid replacement [25]. Several methods have been
described in the past that search for spatial clusters of subfamily conserved residues or that search for shifts in the
evolutionary rates of protein subfamilies [26-33]. The
accuracy of computer predictions has been confirmed in
several cases through mutagenesis experiments
[18,34,35]. In the lack of a 3D structure of the CHASE
domain, we focused on identifying sites that stand out by

Interestingly, the three amino acids which show the
strongest effect and also the positive control T301 are
located in close vicinity in two predicted β-sheets in the
center part of the CHASE domain (Fig. 1B). The only
exception in this study, position K297, which, while completely conserved among plant sequences in contrast to
bacterial sequences, did not show any significant reduction in cytokinin binding (Fig. 3A), is located just outside
the first of these two central β-sheets. We hypothesize that
these β-sheets are part of a binding pocket for cytokinins.
It is understood that only the experimental determination
of the structure will provide conclusive evidence. The
identification of important amino acids presented here
will be an important contribution to understand the functioning of the CHASE domain, once structural data
become available.

Future applications
Plant tissues typically contain a mixture of different biologically active cytokinin metabolites. The specificity of
ligand recognition was investigated for Arabidopsis and
maize cytokinin receptors and it was shown that their relative affinities for different cytokinins varies [4,16,17,36].
Analysis of the mutant receptors generated in this study
has shown that the mutations do not affect the recognition of different cytokinins in a distinct way (Romanov et
al., unpublished result). Thus these amino acids appear to
be of general relevance. As they are conserved among all
plant CHASE domains they might present the key residues
for binding the hormonal core. Fine-tuning for specific
cytokinins could be achieved by additional, less conserved
positions. It will be interesting to see whether our bioinformatical design also enables the identification of amino
acid residues which are relevant to the detection of different types of cytokinins by receptors of the same species.
However, such an analysis will require a greater number
of different cytokinin receptors to be studied with respect
to their cytokinin binding preference.

Conclusion
smaller evolutionary rates in the plant subfamily or, at
sites that evolve slowly in all subfamilies, by biochemical
different amino acids that are conserved in the different
subfamilies.
Experimental evaluation of the roles of the selected amino
acids in cytokinin binding underpinned the validity of the
approach. Substitutions to alanine of four of the five
selected amino acids in CRE1/AHK4 showed a dramatic
alteration of the cytokinin binding, in this case a strong
reduction to total abolishment of the trans-zeatin binding
(Fig. 4A), thus confirming their importance in cytokinin
binding.

Using truncated versions of the cytokinin receptor CRE1/
AHK4 in a binding assay, we have experimentally defined
the CHASE domain as the ligand binding domain of this
class of receptor. Based on our bioinformatical approach,
combined with experimental validation, we successfully
identified functionally important amino acids in this
domain. The experimental confirmation of these residues
highlights the significance of evolutionary proteomics in
the post genomic era and demonstrates its potential for
the characterization of protein functioning. In addition to
the analysis of proteins with known functions, the
approach can be envisioned as an aid in the enormous
task of functionally annotating the vastly increasing
amount of sequence information provided by the numerous genome sequencing projects.

Methods
Construction of the different CRE1/AHK4 variants
The truncated variants of CRE1/AHK4 (At2g01830.2)
were generated by PCR using the respective primers (Additional file 2) and cloned into the entry vector pDONR221
of the Gateway™ cloning system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad).
For the amino acid substitutions the HindIII fragment of
CRE1/AHK4 containing the entire CHASE domain was
cloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla). Sitedirected mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange® II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La
Jolla) using the respective primers (Additional file 2). The
mutated fragments were sequenced and recloned into a
CRE1/AHK4 clone in the pDONR221 vector missing the
HindIII fragment in the cDNA. Subsequently all clones
were shuttled into the pDEST15 vector (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad) and transformed into the E. coli strain
BL21DE3pLys (Novagen, San Diego).
Cytokinin binding assay and immunoblotting
For in vivo cytokinin binding the assays were performed as
published [17]. Pellets of 1 ml of the respective E. coli culture (used in the binding assay) were resuspended in 50
μL reducing 1x Laemmli buffer [37] and heated to 95°C
for 5 min before separating 25 μL of the protein extract on
a 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, München, Germany). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad) using a tank transfer system (Bio-Rad) with
Towbin buffer without methanol [38]. After blocking for
2 h at room temperature with Tris buffered saline (TBS)
including 5% low fat dried milk powder, the membrane
was incubated with anti GST primary antibody (B-14)
(1:500 in blocking buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) 3 h at room temperature. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti mouse secondary antibody (1:4000 in blocking buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg,
Germany)
and
enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce SuperSignal West
Pico; Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany) were used for
detection. Blots were exposed to Pierce CL-Xposure films
(Perbio Science).
Sequence analysis
Sequences containing the CHASE domain were retrieved
from Genbank's non-redundant database using a Hidden
Markov Model, which was built from a representative
multiple sequence alignment [10] obtained from the
Pfam database (HMMER package)[39]. To identify additional plant sequences, Genbank's EST database was
searched with the CHASE domain of CRE1/AHK4. EST
sequences were translated into proteins. Protein regions
containing the CHASE domain were aligned with hmmalign (HMMER). The alignment (Additional file 1) was
manually optimized to minimise gaps in loop regions and
used to calculate a phylogenetic tree with CLUSTAL W

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/62

[40]. Five stable subtrees with more than 90% bootstrap
support were chosen for the analysis of evolutionary rates,
of which one represents all plant sequences and four subtrees represent bacterial sequences. In order to identify
functionally diverged amino acid sites, we estimated evolutionary rates for each position in the five alignments
and compared the rates between the plant and bacterial
groups. This allows the identification of positions that are
under selective pressure in the plant group, while they are
free of any constraint in bacterial groups. In contrast to
more simple amino acid conservation scores, evolutionary rates reflect the amino acid changes considering the
phylogenetic distance of the sequences. Evolutionary site
rates were estimated with the maximum likelihood
method implemented in the TREE-PUZZLE program v5.1
[41,42]. For the estimation of the evolutionary site rates
with TREE-PUZZLE, we have chosen a heterogeneity rate
model that was compared with the null model, which
assumes a uniform rate among sites. The two models were
compared in a log likelihood ratio test and in four out of
five cases the null model was rejected (p-value < 0.01). We
used the Jones Taylor amino acid substitution model and
assumed an eight category discretized gamma model for
the variation of substitution rates among sites. We
searched for sites that are conserved in the plant group but
fast evolving in bacterial groups, or that are slow evolving
in all groups, but conserved in different amino acids.
