Accra, Ghana

Abstract
Background: Antimicrobial resistance is under-documented and commensal Escherichia coli can be used as
indicator organisms to study the resistance in the community. We sought to determine the prevalence of
resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials with particular focus on the quinolones, which have recently been
introduced in parts of Africa, including Ghana.
Results: Forty (13.7%) of 293 E. coli isolates evaluated were nalidixic acid-resistant. Thirteen (52%) of 2006 and 2007
isolates and 10 (66.7%) of 2008 isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. All but one of the quinolone-resistant
isolates were resistant to three or more other antimicrobial classes. Sequencing the quinolone-resistance
determining regions of gyrA and parC, which encode quinolone targets, revealed that 28 quinolone-resistant E. coli
harboured a substitution at position 83 of the gyrA gene product and 20 of these isolates had other gyrA and/or
parC substitutions. Horizontally-acquired quinolone-resistance genes qnrB1, qnrB2, qnrS1 or qepA were detected in
12 of the isolates. In spite of considerable overall diversity among E. coli from Ghana, as evaluated by multilocus
sequence typing, 15 quinolone-resistant E. coli belonged to sequence type complex 10. Five of these isolates
carried qnrS1 alleles.
Conclusions: Quinolone-resistant E. coli are commonly present in the faecal flora of Accra residents. The isolates
have evolved resistance through multiple mechanisms and belong to very few lineages, suggesting clonal
expansion. Containment strategies to limit the spread of quinolone-resistant E. coli need to be deployed to
conserve quinolone effectiveness and promote alternatives to their use.

Background
Following emergence of resistance to inexpensive
broad-spectrum antimicrobials across much of Africa,
quinolone antibacterials have recently been introduced
and are widely used. West African studies that sought
quinolone resistance in commensal or diarrhoeagenic
Escherichia coli before 2004 reported no or very low
incidences of resistance to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones [1-4]. Thus, available data suggests that
resistance to the quinolones was rare in West Africa
until the first decade of the 21st century. More recent
anecdotal reports and surveillance studies point to
emergence of quinolone resistance among enteric
pathogens and faecal enteric bacteria in Ghana and
elsewhere in West Africa [5-8]. In a study by Nys et al.
(2004) faecal isolates of adult volunteers in eight

different countries were assessed for susceptibility to
antimicrobials in the same laboratory [8]. Resistance to
broad spectrum first-generation antibiotics was common and ciprofloxacin resistance was found to be
slowly emerging in Asian, South American and African
countries, including Ghana [8]. Newman et al. (2004)
collected 5099 clinical bacterial isolates (1105 of which
were E. coli) from nine of the ten regions in Ghana
and tested them for antimicrobial susceptibility. They
found that over 70% of the isolates were resistant to
tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin and chloramphenicol and reported that 11% of the
isolates were ciprofloxacin-resistant [7].
Quinolones inhibit the activity of bacterial DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase enzymes, which are essential for replication. Single nucleotide polymorphisms

(QRDR) of gyrA and parC, the two genes that encode
DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV respectively, can
lead to conformational changes in these enzymes that
cause them to block quinolones from binding to the
DNA- substrate complex, yet still preserve their enzymatic function [9]. In Escherichia coli and related
Gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the first target
for fluoroquinolones. If gyrA has resistance-conferring
mutations, the primary target of fluoroquinolone
switches from DNA gyrase to topoisomerase IV
[10,11]. Studies from other parts of the world have
found that resistance-conferring mutations are typically
selected in gyrA first, and then parC.
Although mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and parC
are the most commonly documented resistance
mechanisms, resistance has also been known to be
conferred by mutations in the second topoisomerase
gene, parE. Another mechanism of quinolone resistance relies on upregulation of efflux pumps, which
export quinolones and other antimicrobials out of the
bacterial cell. For example, mutations in the gene
encoding a repressor of the acrAB pump genes, acrR,
are associated with quinolone resistance [12]. Quinolone resistance can also be acquired horizontally
through transferable quinolone resistance (qnr) or
other DNA. The Qnr gene product inhibits quinolones
binding to target proteins [13]. Other horizontally
acquired quinolone resistance genes include aac(6’)-Ib
, encoding a fluroquinolone acetylating enzyme, as well
as qepA and oqxAB, which encode horizontally transmitted efflux pumps [14-16].
Resistance to the quinolones often emerges at lowlevels by acquisition of an initial resistance-conferring
mutation or gene. Acquisition of subsequent mutations
leads to higher levels of resistance to the first-generation
quinolone, nalidixic acid and a broadening of the resistance spectrum to include second-generation quinolones
(first-generation fluoroquinolones) such as ciprofloxacin,
followed by newer second- and third-generation fluoroquinolones [17].
Although multiple mechanisms of quinolone resistance have been reported from other continents, there
are few data from sub-Saharan Africa on the molecular
basis for quinolone resistance. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing on fecal E. coli isolates from
Accra, Ghana in 2006, 2007 and 2008. We identified
isolates that were resistant to nalidixic acid and screened
these strains for mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and
parC as well as horizontally-acquired quinolone-resistance genes. In order to gain some insight into resistance dissemination, we also studied inter-strain
relatedness among quinolone-resistant E. coli isolates by
multilocus sequence typing.

Results
Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is high and
resistance to the quinolones was detected

In 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, 156, 78 and
101 stool specimens were collected. A total of 293
Escherichia coli isolates were recovered from culture of
the 335 stool specimens. Consistent with the results of
recent studies from West African countries, including
Ghana [1,7,8], 50-90% of the E. coli isolates were resistant to the broad-spectrum antimicrobials ampicillin,
streptomycin, sulphonamides, tetracycline and trimethoprim (Figure 1). Resistance to chloramphenicol was less
common but was seen in 30-41% of the isolates. The
proportions of isolates resistant to most agents were
comparable between 2006 and 2007. However, the proportion of isolates resistant to each antimicrobial in
2008 was significantly greater than those seen in 2006,
for all agents (p < 0.05) (Figure 1).
As illustrated in Figure 1 in 2006 and 2007, we recorded
resistance rates to nalidixic acid of 12.3% but by 2008, 15
(18.2%) of isolates were nalidixic acid resistant. Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates represented 7 (5.4%) and 6 (7.7%) of
the total number of isolates in 2006 and 2007 respectively.
In 2008, 10 (9.9%) of the isolates were fluoroquinolone
resistant. Thus, in 2006 and 2007, 13 (52%) quinoloneresistant E. coli isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant but in
2008, 10 (67%) of the quinolone-resistant E. coli were
resistant to ciprofloxacin (Figure 1). Although the numbers were too small to attain statistical significance, organisms with higher nalidixic acid MICs were recovered more
commonly in 2008 than in 2006 (Table 1).
Quinolone resistance was almost always seen in multiply-resistant E. coli. As shown in Table 1, all quinolone-resistant E. coli (QREC) were resistant to at least
one other antimicrobial and all but three of the QREC

isolates were resistant to four or more non-quinolone
antibacterials. Most QREC demonstrated high-level
resistance to nalidixic acid with 21 of 40 of the QREC
isolates showing a nalidixic acid MIC that exceeded
1024 mg/L. Among 2006 isolates, low-level resistance
was more common, with the MIC50 in that year being
128 mg/L. In both 2007 and 2008, the MIC 50 was
>1024 mg/L.
Quinolone resistant E. coli predominantly harbour
mutations in gyrA, parC or both

Increasing nalidixic acid MICs, accompanied by resistance to fluoroquinolones is often due to the acquisition
of multiple mutations in quinolone targets. We
sequenced the quinolone-resistance determining regions
(QRDRs) of gyrA and parC in the 40 QREC isolates. As
shown in Table 1, 28 (70%) of the quinolone-resistant
isolates had at least one non-synonymous substitution
in the QRDR of gyrA and 18 of these isolates also had
one or more non-synonymous mutations in parC.
Twenty-seven of the 28 isolates with at least one mutation in gyrA had a serine to leucine substitution at position 83, one of the most commonly documented
resistance conferring mutations [10]. Twenty of these
isolates also harboured the frequently documented
aspartic acid to asparagine substitution at position 87
and all of these isolates had a nalidixic acid MIC of at
least 256 mg/L. Eighteen of them were resistant to
ciprofloxacin as well as nalidixic acid.
Eighteen QREC isolates had non-synonymous mutations in the QRDR of parC with a serine to isoleucine
substitution at position 80, present in 16 strains, being
the most common substitution (Table 1). The 2007 isolate with a Thr66Ile substitution in ParC had a single

GyrA substitution, Ser83Leu. All other isolates with
ParC substitutions also had Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn
substitutions in GyrA. Five isolates had more than one
ParC substitution. Thr66Ile and Asn105Ser substitutions
in ParC, seen in two isolates in this study, have not previously been described in E. coli but Thr66Ile has been
seen in Salmonella enterica serovars Heidelberg and
Mbandaka [18] (Table 1). Both substitutions occur in
strains with other previously described non-synonymous
polymorphisms in parC and gyrA. In each case, the level
and spectrum of resistance seen is not significantly
greater than that for isolates that lack the novel substitution. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that
either substitution confers additional resistance although
confirmation of this assumption, or otherwise, can only
be made in isogenic strains.
Multiple horizontally-transmitted quinlone resistance
genes were detected among E. coli from Accra

We used PCR to screen for qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and qepA
genes and confirmed all amplicons by sequencing. Of
the 40 strains evaluated twelve carried one horizontally
acquired quinolone resistance gene. These were qnrB1
(2 isolates), qnrB2 (1 isolate), qnrS1 (7 isolates) and
qepA (2 isolates). In two isolates, without mutations in
gyrA and parC QRDRs, horizontally-acquired resistance
genes could account for the resistance seen. However, in
the vast majority of cases, horizontally acquired resistance was seen in combination with QRDR mutations.
Quinolone-resistant E. coli from Accra are overrepresented among multi-locus sequence type 10

We hypothesized that clonal expansion might account,
at least in part, for the rise in resistance seen in the

Namboodiri et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/44

course of the study. To test this hypothesis, we subjected all the 40 QREC isolates to multi-locus sequence
typing by the scheme of Wirth et al [19] and deposited
their allelic profiles in the database at http://www.mlst.
net. We identified 30 Sequence Types (STs) among 40
QREC isolates from Ghana (0.75 STs per strain). As
shown in Figure 2, quinolone resistance is seen in
diverse lineages that have been detected in Ghana. STs
that were recovered more than once among the QREC
included ST10 (9 isolates) as well as STs101, 156, 227,
648 and 1466 (2 isolates each) (Table 1). Although there
were 10 QREC STs that were identified for the first
time in this study (reflecting the low proportion of
strains from West Africa in the database), only one of
these (1466) was seen more than once among QREC
(Figure 2, Table 1). Three others were related to STs
that were also seen among QREC - ST1471 was a single-locus variant of ST206, and STs1286 and 1467 were
respectively single- and double-locus variants of ST10.

Page 5 of 9

Horizontally-transmitted quinlone resistance determinants were expectedly detected in strains belonging to
multiple STs. However qnrS1 alleles were in all but two
cases detected among strains belonging to the ST10
complex.
Nine of the 40 QREC isolates obtained in this study
belonged to ST10, in contrast to 10 of 125 other E. coli
from Ghana in the database (p = 0.02, Fisher’s exact
test). Moreover six other QREC isolates were single- or
double- locus variants of ST10. Thus ST10 appeared to
be over-represented among QREC isolates from Ghana.
Because most of the isolates from Ghana were deposited
in the database two to four years in advance of our own
study, we sequence typed eight non-QREC isolates
selected at random from our 2008 isolates. All eight
belonged to different sequence types (10, 349, 541, 1474,
1475, 1476, 1477 and 1478), five of the eight sequence
types were novel, and only one 2008 non-QREC strain
was an ST10 isolate. Therefore our data suggest that

ST10-complex QREC may represent a successful quinolone-resistant lineage.

Discussion
Evolution of reduced susceptibility to the quinolones is
causing concern following rapidly rising rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in many parts of the world
[20]. In African countries with a high infectious disease
burden, formal and informal health systems depend
heavily on broad spectrum orally-administrable antibacterials. In this study, we found that most commensal
E. coli isolates are resistant to ampicillin, sulphonamides,
tetracycline and trimethoprim, as well as streptomycin,
which have been used to treat actual and supposed bacterial infections in Ghana for over four decades, and
that resistance to these agents is increasing with time.
We also found that about a third of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol. Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials
have been recently introduced as an effective alternative
to older antibacterials that have been compromised by
resistance. However, although resistance rates were
markedly lower for this class of drugs, we also found
that quinolone resistance was increasingly common
among fecal E. coli in this study.
We determined that 12-18% of fecal E. coli isolated
from healthy individuals in Accra in 2006, 2007 and
2008 are quinolone resistant. Twenty-three of the 40
QREC isolated were resistant to the fluoroquinolone
ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin-resistant QREC, showing
high-level nalidixic acid resistance, were more commonly isolated in 2008 than in 2006 and 2007. Strains
with one or no mutations in gyrA were typically ciprofloxacin sensitive. However most isolates had accumulated a second gyrA mutation and/or mutations in parC
and were fluoroquinolone resistant. The QRDR polymorphisms most commonly detected in this study are
those most frequently reported in the literature [10]. As
has been validated experimentally in isogenic strains,
high-level nalidixic acid resistance and fluoroquinolone
resistance in isolates in this study was associated with
parC substitutions in strains also harbouring substitutions in gyrA [17]. However, gyrA and parC mutations
did not absolutely correlate with nalidixic acid MICs,
partly due to horizontally-acquired quinolone-resistance
genes. We sought qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and qepA genes by
PCR and confirmed all amplicons by sequencing. We
found that two isolates without mutations in the
QRDRs of gyrA and parC, as well as ten isolates with
QRDR mutations carried a qnrS1, a qnrB or a qepA
allele. The presence of horizontally-acquired genes
accounted in part for elevated nalidixic acid MICs in
strains that harboured these genes, but not completely.
It is therefore possible that other resistance mechanisms,
such as ParE polymorphisms, other horizontally

Page 6 of 9

acquired resistance genes (such as oqxAB and aac(6’)-Ib
for example), over-active efflux, or even novel mechanisms are present in some of the isolates.
Resistance patterns in pathogens often mirror those in
commensals. This is borne out by our recent documentation of quinolone resistance in Vibrio cholerae isolates
recovered in the same time frame as the E. coli strains
presented in this report [21]. Fifteen of the 40 QREC isolates identified in this study belonged to ST10, or were
single- or double-locus variants of this ST, pointing to
the possibility of clonal expansion. ST10-complex strains
were isolated in all three years and therefore over-representation of these STs in our sample cannot be explained
by short-term, localized clustering. There are four major
E. coli phylogenetic clades: ECOR A, B1, B2 and D. Few
studies have looked at the geographical variance in the
distribution of these groups but overall, QREC from
Ghana were predominantly drawn from ECOR group A.
Of the STs identified in this study that are classified into
ECOR clades at the E. coli MLST database, ST10 complex (14 isolates) belong to ECOR group A, ST131 (1 isolate) to ECOR B2, STs101 and 410 (3 isolates) to ECOR
B1 and STs 156, 206 and 210 (4 isolates) are hybrids of
ECOR A and B1, that is AxB1. Available data appear to
suggest that ECOR A strains are highly prevalent in
Africa, compared to some other world regions [22]. However, when we compared the sequence types of quinolone-resistant and -susceptible strains from Ghana only,
we still found that resistant strains were over-represented
in the ST10 complex. Pandemic clonal expansion of
some QREC lineages has been reported in the literature
[23-28]. For example, ST131 is a globally disseminated
multi-resistant clone and was detected once among the
QREC in this study. Recent reports suggest that isolates
from Europe and North America that belong to ST10- or
ST131- clonal complexes may be less likely to carry virulence factors for invasive disease, but more likely to be
fluoroquinolone resistant [24-28]. However it is equally
likely that mutations to fluoroquinolone resistance are
more likely to be stably inherited in a specific genetic
background. Our own data also appear to suggest that,
although horizontally acquired, qnrS1 is associated with
ST10 complex.
A recent paper by Davidson et al suggests that the antimalarial chloroquine may select for fluoroquinoloneresistant fecal bacteria in malaria endemic areas and proposes that chloroquine-mediated selection accounts for
high levels of QREC in fecal flora in villages in South
America [29]. However, data from within Africa (where
chloroquine has seen heaviest use) to support this
hypothesis are currently lacking and evidence from elsewhere supports a link between quinolone resistance rates
in E. coli and fluoroquinolone consumption at population
levels [30,31]. Our own data suggest that even if

Namboodiri et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/44

resistance was present at low levels prior to the introduction of the quinolones, an upsurge in resistance may
reflect a selective advantage that came with quinolone
introduction. This is particularly likely for Ghana were
artemisinin combination therapies have recently been
introduced to replace chloroquine. Furthermore, because
almost all quinolone resistant-E. coli were multiply resistant, selective pressure from other, even more commonly
applied, antimicrobials will help to maintain the quinolone-resistant clonal groups we identified in this study.

Conclusion
Fluoroquinolones, largely ciprofloxacin, were introduced
very recently to Ghana with high expectations. This
study demonstrates that resistance to these drugs is
already common and occurs through multiple mechanisms, suggesting that heavy use of these valuable drugs
may rapidly obliterate their usefulness. In addition to the
impact that the emergence and dissemination of quinolone resistant bacteria may have on the use of fluoroquinolone antibacterials, we found that QREC were almost
invariably resistant to multiple antimicrobials. This is
worrisome because it means that, if the commensal flora
is reflective of resistance profiles in pathogens, there may
be few low-cost alternatives for managing infections due
to Gram-negative enteric organisms. Additionally, horizontally-acquired resistance to the quinolones, and presumably other agents may be present on mobile elements
that could be transmitted to pathogens. Recent calls for
antimicrobial development have spotlighted hospital
pathogens and Gram-positive community-acquired
pathogens such as Staphylococci [32]. Our data suggest
that there is also a pressing need for orally administrable
drugs with activity against Gram-negative organisms,
which can be used to manage community enteric infections in Ghana and other parts of Africa. Additionally,
known strategies for containing antimicrobial resistance
need to be more rigorously applied [33-35].
Methods
Strains

This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Ghana Medical School. E. coli
isolates were recovered from stool specimens collected
from consenting, apparently healthy individuals who
presented for medical check-ups at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital and the Microbiology Department of the
University of Ghana Medical School. Colonies with a
typical E. coli morphology on MacConkey agar were
subjected to biochemical testing, and where this was
inconclusive, by 16 S amplification and sequencing [36].
Colonies from the same specimen with identical biochemical and susceptibility profiles were treated as identical strains.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Each isolate was tested for susceptibility to eight antimicrobials using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) disc diffusion method
[37]. Antimicrobial discs and control strain E. coli
ATCC 35218 were obtained from Remel. The antimicrobial discs used contained ampicillin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), trimethoprim (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg) and sulphonamide (300 μg). Inhibition
zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with
CLSI guidelines with WHONET software version 5.3
[38]. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to nalidixic acid were measured using the agar dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton agar as recommended by the
CLSI and using E. coli ATCC 35218 as control [39].
Mutational analysis of the Quinolone-Resistance
Determining Regions of gyrA and parC

DNA was extracted from each quinolone-resistant isolate, using the Promega Wizard genomic extraction kit.
The QRDR of the gyrA and parC genes were amplified
from DNA templates by PCR using Platinum PCR
supermix (Invitrogen) and the primer pairs listed in
Table 2. PCR reactions began with a two-minute hot
start at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
annealing temperature, 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. gyrA
amplifications were annealed at 58°C and parC reactions
were annealed at 52°C. E. coli K-12 MG1655 [40] was
used as a control. Amplicons were sequenced on both
strands and predicted peptide sequences were compared
to the corresponding gene from the MG1655 genome
[40] by pair-wise FASTA alignments.
Identification of horizontally-acquired quinoloneresistance genes

Horizontally-acquired quinolone-resistance genes were
identified by PCR. The primers of Liu et al [41] were
used to screen for the qepA gene and qnrA, qnrB, and
qnrS were identified with PCR using the primer pairs
published by Wu et al [42] (Table 2). Amplicons were
sequence-verified.
Multi-locus sequence typing

Gene fragments from the adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh,
purA and recA were amplified using primers listed in
Table 2, as described by Wirth et al [19]. Amplified DNA
products were sequenced from both ends. Allele assignments were made at the publicly accessible E. coli MLST
database at http://www.mlst.net. Phylogenetic inferences
about ancestral allelic profiles and strain interrelatedness
were made using eBURSTv3 at http://eburst.mlst.net/
defining clonal complexes based on groups sharing five
identical alleles and bootstrapping with 1000 samplings.
