Background
Several studies have been performed exploring HIV-1
subtype B antiretroviral resistance mutation profiles.
Nonetheless, data for other HIV-1 subtypes is scarce.
The aim of the present work was to analyze the subtype
F protease antiretroviral related mutations.
Methods
Data from 38 HIV-1 subtype F individuals with
sequences obtained in two different time points were
analyzed. All patients presented virological failure to a
protease-inhibitor containing regimen. The average of
time between the first and the second sequence was 1.5
year. Most patients had changed therapy at least once
between the first and the second genomic sequence. Protease subtyping was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.
T-pared test was performed to verify possible differences
in the total number of mutations and in the number of
primary mutations when comparing the group containing
all first sequences and the group containing all second
sequences. We searched for all primary mutations present in the group of first sequences. Once a primary
mutation was present in the first sequence, we verified its
presence after changing therapeutic regimen.

number of primary mutations stayed stable, but once a
primary mutation was present in the first sequence, it
was commonly found also in the second sequence. That
was the case of D30N, N88D, L90M and V82A.

Discussion
Our results suggest that increasing the number of total
mutations after changing therapeutic schema is a trend,
as well as the persistence of some primary mutations
even after at least one year under a new Protease Inhibitor related selective pressure.

increased after one or more therapy changing. The
