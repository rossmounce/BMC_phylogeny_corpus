Abstract
Background: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) catalyze oxidation of various substrates using oxygen
and NAD(P)H. Plant P450s are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites performing
diverse biological functions. The recent availability of the soybean genome sequence allows us to identify and
analyze soybean putative P450s at a genome scale. Co-expression analysis using an available soybean microarray
and Illumina sequencing data provides clues for functional annotation of these enzymes. This approach is based
on the assumption that genes that have similar expression patterns across a set of conditions may have a
functional relationship.
Results: We have identified a total number of 332 full-length P450 genes and 378 pseudogenes from the soybean
genome. From the full-length sequences, 195 genes belong to A-type, which could be further divided into 20
families. The remaining 137 genes belong to non-A type P450s and are classified into 28 families. A total of 178
probe sets were found to correspond to P450 genes on the Affymetrix soybean array. Out of these probe sets, 108
represented single genes. Using the 28 publicly available microarray libraries that contain organ-specific
information, some tissue-specific P450s were identified. Similarly, stress responsive soybean P450s were retrieved
from 99 microarray soybean libraries. We also utilized Illumina transcriptome sequencing technology to analyze the
expressions of all 332 soybean P450 genes. This dataset contains total RNAs isolated from nodules, roots, root tips,
leaves, flowers, green pods, apical meristem, mock-inoculated and Bradyrhizobium japonicum-infected root hair
cells. The tissue-specific expression patterns of these P450 genes were analyzed and the expression of a
representative set of genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We performed the co-expression analysis on many of the
108 P450 genes on the Affymetrix arrays. First we confirmed that CYP93C5 (an isoflavone synthase gene) is coexpressed with several genes encoding isoflavonoid-related metabolic enzymes. We then focused on nodulationinduced P450s and found that CYP728H1 was co-expressed with the genes involved in phenylpropanoid
metabolism. Similarly, CYP736A34 was highly co-expressed with lipoxygenase, lectin and CYP83D1, all of which are
involved in root and nodule development.
Conclusions: The genome scale analysis of P450s in soybean reveals many unique features of these important
enzymes in this crop although the functions of most of them are largely unknown. Gene co-expression analysis
proves to be a useful tool to infer the function of uncharacterized genes. Our work presented here could provide
important leads toward functional genomics studies of soybean P450s and their regulatory network through the
integration of reverse genetics, biochemistry, and metabolic profiling tools. The identification of nodule-specific
P450s and their further exploitation may help us to better understand the intriguing process of soybean and
rhizobium interaction.

Background
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are enzymes
found in most organisms from bacteria, to plants and
human [1]. They catalyze the oxidation of various substrates using oxygen and NAD(P)H. In plants, large numbers of P450 genes form complex super-families and play
important roles in many plant metabolic processes. They
are involved in biosynthesis of pigments (anthocyanins),
accessory pigments (carotenoids), defense-related compounds (some phytoalexins), UV protectants (flavonoids
and sinapoyl esters), structural polymers (lignins), and
fatty acids. P450s also contribute to the homeostasis of
signalling molecules such as plant hormones because
they are frequently the rate-limiting enzymes of hormone
biosyntheses [2]. Similar to their functions in animals,
P450s are also responsible for degradation of endogenous
as well as exogenous compounds such as herbicides,
insecticides and pollutants [3].
Structurally, the bacterial P450s are soluble proteins. In
contrast, all plant P450s studied so far are membranelocalized. Most of them are anchored on the cytoplasmic
surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a hydrophobic peptide present at the N-terminus, possibly forming a trans-membrane segment [4]. Analysis of the
Arabidopsis and other plant P450 sequences predicts
potential signal peptides that should target some of the
P450s to the plastids or to the mitochondria [2], though
no mitochondrial P450s are known in plants. The number of P450 genes in plants is much higher than in other
organisms, correlating to the fact that plants produce a
huge repertoire of primary and secondary metabolites.
For nomenclature and classification of diverse P450
genes, a universal system has been set up based on the
protein sequence identity and phylogeny [5]. Briefly,
P450 proteins that share at least 40% identity are
assigned to the same family. They are further grouped
into sub-families that share at least 55% identity. A few
exceptions to this nomenclature system do occur, especially in plants where gene duplication events make it
more complex. In such cases, phylogeny and gene organization are taken as criteria for family assignment. P450
genes for all organisms are named and classified by a
P450 nomenclature committee in chronological order of
sequence submission (David Nelson: dnelson@uthsc.
edu). To distinguish from other organisms, plant P450s
are classified into families from CYP71A1 to CYP99XY,
and then from CYP701A1 and above [2]. P450s in plants
are traditionally classified in two types: the A-type and
the non-A type [6,7]. Recently, plant P450s have been
re-classified into 11 clans. The A-type is now grouped as
the CYP71 clan and the non-A type has 10 clans including the CYP51, CYP72, CYP74, CYP85, CYP86, CYP97,
CYP710, CYP711, CYP727, and CYP746 clan [7].

Here, we carried out a systematic analysis of the soybean genome for P450 gene families. Soybean (Glycine
max) is one of the most important legume species and a
leading oilseed crop in the world. Processed soybeans
are the largest source of vegetable oil and protein feed.
According to a USDA report, soybean represented 56%
of world oilseed production in 2008 http://www.soystats.
com/2009/. The soybean genome has recently been
sequenced and various large-scale expression analyses
have been established in soybean, providing unique
resources for genomic analysis of this important gene
family [8]. Importantly, the soybean P450 information
can be compared to other fully sequenced plant genomes. As of September 2010, from the fully sequenced
plant genomes, there are 71 full-length P450 genes in
moss Physcomitrella patens, 245 in Arabidopsis, 332 in
rice, and 310 in poplar [9].
Since membrane-bound enzymes are traditionally
more difficult to study, few P450s have been functionally
characterized. In the Arabidopsis genome, only 41 of the
245 coding sequences have been associated with a specific biochemical function [10]. Recently, a large-scale
P450 co-expression analysis with functional annotation
of the 245 Arabidopsis P450 genes was performed to
predict the function of unknown P450 genes [11]. This
co-expression analysis revealed expression patterns of
the majority of Arabidopsis P450s, and provided novel
clues on individual P450 functions, pathways, and their
regulatory networks. A novel phenolic pathway in pollen
development was identified based on this co-expression
analysis [12].
In this study, using in silico resources and bioinformatics tools, we identified and annotated putative functional P450 encoding sequences in the soybean genome.
Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences
allowed us to identify gene orthologs and clusters of
orthologous groups for further characterizations. By
analyzing large-scale microarray and Illumina sequencing data, we also analyzed the co-expression of P450
genes in soybean, which could provide important clues
to their function. We were able to identify tissue-specific
P450 genes that may play roles in biological process like
nodulation, floral development, and seed maturation.
The large-scale expression analyses were confirmed for
selected P450 genes using quantitative real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

Results and Discussions
Soybean cytochrome P450 genes

A large number of soybean P450 genes have been
deposited into the cytochrome P450 database http://
drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html following the
completion of the soybean genome sequencing. A total

of 332 full-length soybean P450 genes and 378 pseudogenes with Glyma location markers were retrieved from
the database. To screen for additional P450 genes, we
performed BLAST search using standard P450 domains
against Phytozome 4.0 and confirmed all 332 putative
P450 genes in the genome. No new full-length P450
gene was discovered by three sets of domain search
algorithms, including Pfam, Panther, and KOG. Additionally, we were able to identify 13 new pseudogenes
from the domain searches, which were later confirmed
and classified by the P450 nomenclature committee and
updated in the cytochrome P450 database (as of September, 2010). Currently, the cytochrome P450 database
lists all the soybean P450 genes, pseudogenes, and their
corresponding Glyma location markers. These genes are
classified into A-type and Non-A type P450s. There are
20 families of the A-type and 28 families of the non-A
type P450s in soybean, consisting of 195 and 137 fulllength sequences, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).
Among these families, CYP71 is the largest A-type
family, with 55 members (Table 1); while CYP94 is the

largest non-A type family (Table 2), with 14 members.
Only four families; CYP703, 718, 724, and 727 consist of
a single gene. The remaining 44 families are all multigene families most likely due to two genome duplication
events in soybean [8,13]. The number of pseudogenes
matched well with the number of full-length genes in
the A-type families (Additional File 1, Table S1A). For
example, CYP71, the largest family also has 65 pseudogenes, the most in all families. In contrast, pseudugene
numbers did not match the numbers of full-length
genes in non-A type families (Additional File 1, Table
S1B). For example, CYP710 has only two full-length
genes but 17 pseudogenes. We speculate that non-A
type P450s are evolutionally more ancient than A-type
families, allowing more time for gene duplication and
rearrangement, resulting in more diverse compositions
than A-type genes.
The soybean P450 genes were compared to a few
selected plant species including Medicago, Arabidopsis,
rice, poplar, grape and moss (Tables 1 and 2). A comparison of P450s among soybean, Medicago, Arabidopsis

Non-A type P450 families are organized into 10 clans. The families highlighted in bold have unique distributions among these species as described in the text.

and rice, where comprehensive analyses of the P450
genes have been published, revealed that the CYP92
family is present in most of the higher plants except
Arabidopsis. CYP92A6 is proposed to be involved in
brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis during etiolated hypocotyl growth of pea [14,15]. Since this family is absent
in Arabidopsis that has a robust BR biosynthesis and
signaling system, CYP92A6 might have additional functions that need to be evaluated. Similarly, CYP727,
CYP728 and CYP733 families are present in rice and
soybean and absent in Arabidopsis and Medicago. For
example, CYP727A1 is represented by a single gene in
rice and CYP727B5 is a single gene in soybean. These
are probably solo-function genes similar to the CYP51G
family [9]. CYP736 family is present in soybean and
Medicago [16] but absent from - Arabidopsis and rice.
However, like several other families, the CYP736 family
genes are also found in grape and poplar (Table 1). We
did not identify any unique “legume-specific” A-type
P450s. In general, moss has the most distinct P450
family distribution, representing a significant evolutionary distance.
The CYP702 and CYP708 of non-A type families are
present in Arabidopsis but absent in soybean, Medicago
or rice (Table 2). The P450 genes from these two
families are all unique to Arabidopsis and its closest
relatives, such as Brassica napus, making these the only
known Brassicaceae-specific CYP proteins thus far.
Among them, CYP708A2 is a thalianol hydroxylase, and
CYP702A2 and CYP702A3 are triterpene synthases [17].
In contrast, if grape and poplar P450s are included, we
cannot find any P450 families that are unique to soybean, or unique to legumes (soybean and Medicago
combined). Even though legumes P450 are involved in
making unique compounds, such as isoflavones
(CYP93C), these P450 genes are not distant enough to
form their own families.

sterols, fatty acids, etc.) hormones and other signaling
molecules. Based on the phylogenetic tree, CYP736
family that is present in soybean and Medicago closely
resembles to the CYP83 and CYP81 gene families in
Arabidopsis (Additional File 2, Figure S1A). The CYP83
family genes are involved in glucosinolate metabolism
[19]. As shown in Additional File 2, Figure S1A, the
CYP733A family in soybean and CYP81K in Arabidopsis
belong to the same cluster, but no function has been
assigned to either of these two gene families.
Flavones are widely distributed in higher plants and
isoflavonoids are mainly produced in the leguminous
plants. They play significant eco-physiological functions
in the adaptation of plants in their biological environments [20]. Flavonoids are synthesized from the phenylpropanoid pathways that utilize several cytochrome
P450s. One of the P450 families involved in flavonoid
biosynthesis in soybean is the CYP93 family that contains 13 genes compared with 8 genes in Medicago, 1
gene in Arabidopsis and 3 genes in rice (Figure 1). The
CYP93 family includes 9 subfamilies, among which
CYP93A encodes dihydroxy-pterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase
(D6aH) involved in legume phytoalexin biosynthesis
[21]; CYP93B is flavone synthase (FNSII) involved in

Phylogenetic analysis of soybean and Arabidopsis
P450 genes

A neighbor-joining (N-J) phylogenetic tree for P450 protein sequences from soybean and Arabidopsis was constructed to determine the orthologous genes and cluster
groups between these two species using P-distance in
the MEGA4 package [18]. The soybean P450 genes were
first classified into two major classes, A-type and nonA-type (Additional File 2, Figure S1A and Figure S1B).
The A-type genes contain 59% of the soybean sequences
(195 of the 332 sequences) and represent many of the
plant-specific enzymes for the synthesis of secondary
products (such as phenylpropanoids, etc.). The proteins
encoded by the non-A-type sequences contain 137 of
the 332 sequences and include enzymes involved in the
synthesis of primary metabolic compounds (such as

flavone biosynthesis [22,23]; CYP93C is isoflavone
synthase (IFS) involved in isoflavone biosynthesis [24].
Arabidopsis CYP93D1 is the only member in the 93D
subfamily and it is closely related to soybean
CYP93A30, suggesting it can be orthologous to the soybean gene (Figure 1). There are a few sequences in the
CYP93F and the CYP93G families, whose functions are
still unclear. Sequence similarity indicated that the
CYP93 family could have evolved from the more ancient
CYP75 by duplication and divergence. The CYP93C
family is mostly confined to legumes, whereas the
CYP93B sequences have a wider distribution and are
found in many species. It is possible that CYP93C might
have evolved from the CYP93B subfamily which appears
to be a more ancient subfamily [9].
For the non-A type P450s, we selected the CYP74
family for more detailed comparisons. Members of
CYP74 family are involved in the formation of plant
oxylipins, a large family of metabolites derived from
polyunsaturated fatty acids [25]. In Arabidopsis genome,
only two CYP74s have been identified: CYP74A1 and
CYP74B2. Arabidopsis CYP74A1 encodes an allene
oxide synthase (AOS), which commits 13-hydroperoxy
linolenic acid (13-HPOT) to the formation of plant
defense hormone, jasmonic acid [26] whereas CYP74B2
is a hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), which converts 13HPOT to 6-carbon aldehydes and 12-carbon ω-ketofatty acids [27]. The volatile products from HPL pathway are collectively called green leaf volatiles (GLVs),
which can attract the natural enemies of insect herbivores and play an important role in tritrophic interactions. As shown in Figure S1B, in the soybean genome,
out of 6 CYP74s, there are 3 CYP74As: CYP74A1,
CYP74A21 and CYP74A22. We can assume that these
three CYP74As are bona fide AOSs. It has been
reported that tomato and several other plant species
have at least two AOSs leading to the formation of jasmonic acid [25]. Similar to Arabidopsis, soybean has
only one member of CYP74B; CYP74B15, which is
probably a functional HPL. The remaining two soybean
CYP74s: CYP74C12 and CYP74C13 do not have homologs in Arabidopsis. CYP74Cs from cucumber, melon,
almond and rice were shown to be HPLs that have a
preference, but not absolute specificity, for 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acids [28-31]. A third
AOS gene from tomato was identified, LeAOS3, which
is a 9-AOS and a member of CYP74C. So far, 9-AOS
has been identified in a few plants including tomato,
barley and potato http://metacyc.org/META/new-image?
type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5407[32]. It is quite
possible that CYP74C12 and CYP74C13 have activities
against 9-HPOT and it would be interesting to identify
the products of enzyme reaction to see if there are 9HPL or 9-AOS.

P450 gene expression profiling using Affymetrix arrays
showed organ-specific and stress-induced expression

To obtain expression profiles of soybean P450 genes, we
first utilized the extensive Affymetrix array data publically available at the NCBI database. To identify P450
probe sets on the Affymetrix soybean array (Part
#900526), we performed BLASTN searches using the
sequences of each probe set against the predicted soybean cDNAs at the TIGR gene index and Phytozome
4.0 genomic sequences. A total of 178 probe sets were
found to correspond to P450 genes. Out of these probe
sets, 108 represented single genes (at least 100 bp in
matching length); the rest matched with more than one
gene (55 of them matched with more than two genes).
Since multiple targets complicate interpretation of the
expression profiles, we focused on the 108 single-target
genes for further analysis.
There are 28 microarray libraries that contain organspecific information in the public database. Following
standard microarray data analysis, we identified highly
tissue-specific soybean P450 genes (with a cut-off > 3
for up-regulated genes and < −3 for down regulated
genes). The data are summarized in Figures 2, 3, 4 and
Additional File 3, Table S2. The P450 genes highly
induced in leaves, roots, hypocotyl, seeds and axillary
meristem are apparent (Figures 2 and 3). For example,
out of 108 P450 genes, seven are highly induced and
one significantly repressed in the axillary meristem tissues when all genes expressed in all tissues were averaged as control. Each tissue has its own unique set of
differentially expressed P450s. Interestingly, CYP93C1
(IFS1) and CYP93C5 (IFS2) were highly expressed in
roots and seeds. More specifically, IFS1 is mainly
expressed in the root and seed coat; while IFS2 is mainly
expressed in embryos and pods. These results agree with
previous publications using Northern blot analysis, qRTPCR, and promoter:GUS transgene assays [33].
CYP93A2, a member of the 93A subfamily, also
showed high expression in roots. CYP81E12, CYP81E28
and CYP81E21 are also highly expressed in roots. The
CYP81E family encodes isoflavone 2’- and 3’-hydroxylases which are involved in isoflavonoid phytoalexin
synthesis. Not surprisingly, in Medicago CYP81E7 was
reported to be highly expressed in roots as well [34].
Other up-regulated and down-regulated P450 genes in
each tissue are listed in Additional File 4, Table S3. The
functions of these genes are not known, however their
strong tissue-specific expression suggests their involvement in those tissue types.
There are 99 microarray libraries in the public database from various stress treatments of soybean. As summarized in Figure 4, the genes CYP736A28, CYP93E1,
CYP82A4, CYP94C18 and CYP81E11 are highly induced
in soybean cyst nematode infection. Similarly, CYP71D9,

dataset.

CYP736A33, CYP72A128, CYP81E28, and CYP81E21
showed strong induction in hypocotyls infected with
Phytophthora Sojae. Interestingly, CYP707A51 and
CYP710A23 are highly expressed in soybean leaves treated with Nod factor from B. japonicum compared to
untreated leaves, suggesting they may be involved in the
auto-regulation process in which shoots synthesize a
mobile signal to suppress additional nodulation in the
root after initial rhizobial infection. Under abiotic stress
conditions, CYP71D9 and CYP83D1 were highly
expressed under iron deficiency compared to plants
grown under sufficient iron. The exact functions of
these two genes have not been reported before.
P450 gene expression profiling using Illumina
transcriptome analysis identified organ-specific and
rhizobium-induced expression

Given the limitations of the current soybean Affymetrix
DNA microarray platform, we also utilized Illumina
transcriptome sequencing technology to analyze all 332
soybean P450 gene expressions, using published data
from Libault et al. [35]. These data sets were generated
from total RNAs isolated from nodules, roots, root tips,
leaves, flowers, green pods, apical meristem, mockinoculated and B. japonicum-infected root hair cells harvested at 12, 24 and 48 h after inoculation [35]. For
comparison, total RNA extracted from stripped roots
(i.e. roots devoid of root hairs) were also harvested and
sequenced at 48 h after inoculation with B. japonicum.
Illumina transcriptome analysis allowed a more

thorough assessment of all of the 332 soybean P450
genes. Additionally, since Affymetrix array analysis is
considered to be less sensitive when comparing different
experimental set ups, especially for low abundant RNAs,
this deep transcriptome sequence analysis allowed a
clear distinction between low-abundance and undetectable transcripts.
From these Illumina data, the P450 genes highly
expressed in different tissue were hierarchically clustered
using the MeV v4.5.1 software. The entire expression
profile in all tissues and treatments is shown in Additional File 5, Figure S2. To simplify the figure, the
expression of P450s involved in isoflavone biosynthesis,
CYP93 family genes and P450 families present only in
soybean and not in Arabidopsis, including CYP92,
CYP733, CYP735 and CYP736 have been highlighted
(Figures 5 and 6). In Figure 5, very different expression
profiles in apical meristem, green pods, nodules, roots,
flowers, leaves, and root tips can be seen among selected
P450s. For example, CYP733A members were not
detected in any of the tissues, suggesting a more narrow
distribution beyond our collection of cDNA libraries. In
Figure 6, root hairs and stripped roots were profiled
with or without rhizobia induction. Isoflavone biosynthetic enzymes were expressed in all tissues and treatments, in contrast with CYP733A and CYP83 family
where no expression could be detected in any tissues.
Interestingly, CYP88A3 appeared to be expressed only in
the root hairs, not in the roots stripped of root hairs.
Similarly, CYP736A31 and CYP736A32 exhibit much

higher expression in the root hairs than in the stripped
roots. In contrast, the same family CYP736A47 and
CYP736A48 had an opposite expression pattern, with
significantly higher expression in roots than in root
hairs.
Of all P450 genes analyzed, the ones highly expressed
in nodules, roots, leaves and flowers are summarized in
Table 3. The most abundant P450 genes in each tissue,
as shown by the calculated tag sequence numbers, are
CYP83G4 (nodules), CYP76X6 (apical meristem, green
pods and leaves), CYP83E12 (flowers), and CYP93C5
(roots and root tips). Clearly, CYP76X6 is the most
abundant P450 in green tissues (function unknown);
while the isoflavone synthetic enzyme IFS is the major
P450 in roots.
We were interested in the rhizobium-induced P450
genes. Out of 12 genes in the CYP736 family,
CYP736A34 showed high expression in nodules and
roots (Table 3 and Figure 6). CYP78A71, CYP83G4 and
CYP71A44 were highly expressed in nodules. Almost no
expression was detected in other tissues. Considering
there are only two members of the CYP83 family in
Arabidopsis, but five members in M. truncatula and six
members in Lotus japonicus, the CYP83 family may play
important roles in legumes, although its function
remains unknown [16].
To confirm these findings from Illumina sequencing,
we carried out qRT-PCR analysis on the four nodulespecific genes and a set of selected other P450 genes.
Total RNAs were isolated from hypocotyls, roots, leaves,
flowers, seed (stage R8), and dissected nodules. The
expression levels of the above-mentioned CYP78A71,
CYP83G4, CYP71A44, and CYP82D30 were measured.
All four genes showed dominant nodule-specific expression, consistent with the Illumina data. Two additional
genes, CYP81E12 and CYP736A34, showed strong root
and nodule expression, also fitting the Illumina data
very well. All six genes on Figure 7 had lower expression
in other tissues.
As controls, CYP82D26, CYP74B15, CYP93C5, and
CYP83E21 genes were also analyzed by qRT-PCR (Figure 8). All four genes showed exactly the same expression pattern as suggested by Illumina analysis. CYP93C5
(IFS1) has been characterized by other expression analysis methods previously and all data are consistent with
our qRT-PCR analysis. Taken together, we have discovered four major nodulation-specific P450 genes, which
will be functionally characterized in the future.
We also analyzed another set of Illumina data recently
published by Severin et al. [36]. Since the normalization
methods were different in these two data sets, we were
unable to combine these two transcriptome data. However, the expression profiles of highlighted genes in the
comparable tissue types were similar in these two data

sets (see Additional File 6, Table S4). For example, the
above-mentioned CYP78A71, CYP83G4, and CYP71A44
all showed nodule-specific expression while CYP82D30
expressed in roots and nodules.
Co-expression analysis revealed co-ordinately expressed
metabolic enzymes of some P450s

Co-expression analysis assumes that some genes of the
same biochemical pathway are co-ordinately regulated at

the transcriptional level. In general, P450s catalyze slow
and irreversible steps in many branches of the plant
metabolic pathways. They have been shown to be coexpressed and regulated with non-P450 genes with
known functions in the same pathway [37]. For example,
the functions of several uncharacterized P450 genes in
Arabidopsis were predicted using co-expression analysis
and confirmed experimentally later [11,38]. In this
study, we performed co-expression analysis comparing

the expression of each P450 with that of genes present
in the Affymetrix Soybean gene chip.
The annotation information of the current Affymetrix
soybean gene chip was combined with expression data
to identify genes and pathways co-expressed with the
P450 genes. For each P450 gene, we calculated Pearson
correlation coefficients (r-value) with genes present on
the Affymetrix soybean array. Only the genes with significant coefficients (r > 0.7) were selected for pathway
analysis. We first investigated a known soybean P450
gene to test our co-expression analysis approach. As
shown in Table 4, CYP93C5 isoflavone synthase (IFS1)
gene co-expresses strongly with several isoflavonoidrelated metabolic enzymes, including chalcone isomerase

1B1 (r = 0.91), and chalcone isomerase 1B2 (r = 0.87).
Interestingly, the few transcription factors, such as
Myb76 and bZIP42 that are co-expressed with these
genes could be the missing transcription factors that
regulate isoflavone biosynthesis under stress conditions.
Functional annotation of Arabidopsis and soybean are
shown in Table 5.
We then performed the co-expression analysis on many
of the 108 P450 genes on the Affymetrix arrays (Table 4
and Additional File 6, Table S4). We selected three examples and highlight them in Table 4. The CYP728H1
showed high expression in roots and nodules, and was coexpressed with 4-coumarate:CoA ligase isoenzyme 2, cytochrome P450 98A2 and 4- coumarate:coenzyme A ligase

genes which are involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism.
CYP728H1 is also co-expressed with endo-xyloglucan
transferase, NAC transcription factor, 2’-hydroxy isoflavone and early nodulin genes. Gene expression and coexpression analysis suggests that CYP728H1 may play an
important role in isoflavone metabolism, as well as during
root and nodule development.
The CYP736 family is present in soybean but not in
Arabidopsis. CYP736A34 showed high expression in
roots and nodules (Figure 7). Co-expression analysis
showed that the expression of this gene is highly

correlated with lipoxygenase, lectin and CYP83D1, all of
which are involved in root and nodule development
(Table 4). Some of the co-expressed genes are defense
related genes such as cysteine proteinase. Since defense
response is one of the early nodulation events,
CYP736A34 may be functioning at the early stages of
this symbiotic process.
These analyses show that co-expression analysis combined with pathway mapping of co-expressed genes is a
powerful tool to identify genes encoding enzymes acting in
the same biochemical pathway or biological process.

List of P450 genes and their expression intensity values in different organs. Value zero indicates no expression.

Unfortunately, annotation of soybean genes in the Affymetrix gene chip is not as comprehensive as other model species. Many of the co-expressed genes have unknown or unconfirmed functions. A majority of the P450s cannot be
mapped to specific pathways. However, this approach still
provides important leads to large sets of uncharacterized
soybean P450s, and with improved annotation of soybean
genes in the near future, we should be able to extract more
functional information of soybean P450s.

Conclusions
Soybean is an important leguminous crop. With the
advent of soybean genome sequencing, it is possible to
study large gene families of soybean. We targeted one of
the most challenging families in plants, the cytochrome
P450 genes, and investigated their genetic make-up, gene
distributions, expression profiles, and co-expressed associates. Cytochrome P450s are indispensable for soybean
growth, development, and defense against pathogens.
They may play important roles for soybean symbiotic
interaction with rhizobacteria. Overall, we identified 332
full-length P450 genes and 378 pseudogenes in the genome. We used publicly available microarray libraries and
identified few tissue-specific and stress responsive soybean
P450s. The tissue-specific expression patterns of some
P450 genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. In addition, the
expressions patterns of all 332 soybean P450 genes were
obtained through the analysis of Illumina transcriptome
datasets. The co-expression analysis on some of the P450
genes was performed using the Affymetrix array datasets.
We demonstrate that gene co-expression analysis is a useful tool to guide our further study on the function of
uncharacterized genes. Importantly, the identification of

nodule-specific P450s and their further exploitation may
help us to uncover the intriguing process of soybean and
rhizobium interaction.

Methods
Identification of soybean cytochrome P450 genes

Existing soybean P450 genes and corresponding Glyma
numbers (location markers in soybean genome) were
retrieved from the Cytochrome P450 Homepage website
http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html. Additional full-length soybean genes were identified based on
the cytochrome P450 domain predictions from Pfam
[39], Panther [40], and KOG [41] separately. The search
results were consolidated with existing soybean P450s.
From these sequences, the pseudogenes were identified
using existing criteria listed on the P450 homepage
website.
Computational phylogenetic analysis

Protein sequences of soybean P450 genes were obtained
based on Phytozome 4.0. For comparison, a collection
of P450s from Arabidopsis thaliana (245 genes) and the
corresponding CYP names were retrieved from Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 web-based resource http://
www.p450.kvl.dk/p450.shtml[42]. In addition, CYP93
family proteins from Medicago truncatula and rice were
selected from Genbank for relationship analysis across
species. Multiple sequence alignment were performed
using the BLOSUM matrix (Gap opening and extension
penalties of 25 and 1, respectively), using the ClustalW
algorithm-based AlignX module from the Mega4 software [18]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using
the Neighbour-Joining Tree method by P-distance in

analysis was examined by bootstrap testing with 1000

Publically available experiments and arrays were listed
at the NCBI GEO and Array Express database http://

expression, six experiments (28 arrays) were analyzed

experiments (99 arrays) were analyzed using RNAs isolated from various abiotic and biotic stress treatments.
Expression analysis was carried out using GeneSpring

10GX (Agilent Technologies, Forster City, CA). First,
all microarray data were normalized and summarized
using the RMA algorithm. Signals from each probe set
were then normalized to the median of their values
across the entire dataset. Quality control of the dataset
was performed using Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) to confirm that there were no outlying replicate
samples, and dye labeling had no associated bias. Data
were combined from replicate samples and grouped in
experiment interpretations. Gene list (CYP genes) were
generated by expression with cut off P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA
with Posthoc-TukeyHSD test to determine statistical

significant difference between means. Signal intensities
from organ and tissue samples were then compared to
the average signal intensities during normalization. In
stress experiments, signal intensities from treatment
groups were compared to signal intensities from the
corresponding control samples to generate fold
changes. Genes that were significantly up or down
regulated (>two fold) were selected for hierarchical
clustering. Hierarchical clustering tree was created
based on Pearson correlation coefficient under each
experimental condition. Co-expression analysis and
pathway mapping were performed in GeneSpring as
well. The selected P450 genes were mean-centered and

of 51,529 annotated soybean genes (74.5% of the 69,145
putative, annotated soybean genes) were found to be
expressed in at least one condition.
1.5 Plant materials, growing conditions, and RNA
extraction

Soybean (G. max L. cv. Jack) seeds were germinated in
three-gallon pots containing Promix (Home Depot,
Atlanta, GA). The seedlings were grown in Conviron
growth chamber (26/20 °C day/night temperature,
photoperiod of 14/10 h, 800 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity
and 60% humidity). When the seedlings developed four
nodes and three fully opened trifoliate leaves, approximately 25 d after sowing, the roots, hypocotyls, leaves
were collected. Flowers and early R8 stage seeds were
harvested 55 and 100 d after sowing, respectively. Collected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Soybean plants inoculated with B. japonicum
USDA110 strain was used for nodulation as described
previously [45].

Reference-Soybean function

Total RNA was isolated from plants using TRIZOL
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For each sample, 10
μg of total RNA were digested with RNase-free DNaseI
(Promega, Madison, WI) to remove any genomic DNA
contamination. After DNaseI treatment, RNA concentration was determined again using a NanoDrop ND1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg total RNA using the Superscript III first
strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). All cDNA samples
were diluted 50-fold in sterile water for real time PCR
reaction.
1.6 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Gene specific primers were designed using ProbeFinder
Version 2.44 https://www.roche-applied-science.com.
The list of genes and primers used for amplification
are shown in Additional File 7, Table S5. Primer specificity was further confirmed by blasting each primer
sequence against Phytozome http://www.phytozome.

net/search.php?show=blast using the BLASTN algorithm. Soybean Actin and Ubiquitin genes were used
as internal controls for gene expression studies [46].
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed in 96-well plates (StepOne Plus Real Time
PCR System; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for
all tissues tested. Clontech’s SYBR Advantage qPCR
Premix was used for the qRT-PCR reactions. Primer
sets (0.2 μM final concentrations for each primer)
were used in a final volume of 10 μL per well. The
thermal profile of the qRT-PCR reactions was 95°C for
5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, and
60°C for 10 sec and 72°C for 20 sec. Melting curve of
each PCR amplicon was obtained by adding the following cycling condition: 95°C for 15 sec followed by a
constant increase of the temperature between 60 to 95°
C at an increment of 0.3°C/cycle.
