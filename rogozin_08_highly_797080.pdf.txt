Abstract
A widespread and highly conserved family of apparently inactivated derivatives of archaeal B-family
DNA polymerases is described. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the inactivated forms comprise a
distinct clade among archaeal B-family polymerases and that, within this clade, Euryarchaea and
Crenarchaea are clearly separated from each other and from a small group of bacterial homologs.
These findings are compatible with an ancient duplication of the DNA polymerase gene followed
by inactivation and parallel loss in some of the lineages although contribution of horizontal gene
transfer cannot be ruled out. The inactivated derivative of the archaeal DNA polymerase could
form a complex with the active paralog and play a structural role in DNA replication.

Findings
DNA polymerases are enzymes that are essential for
genome replication and repair in all cellular life forms
[1,2]. There are several distinct families of DNA polymerases some of which are unrelated to each other whereas
most show varying degrees of relationship [3,4]. All
archaea and eukaryotes encode at least one but typically
several paralogous B-family DNA polymerases that play a
key role in DNA replication [5]. Euryarchaeota typically
posses one or two B-family polymerase, in addition to the
apparently unrelated D-family polymerase whereas Cre-

narchaeota have two or three paralogous B-family
polymerases but no D-family polymerases [6-8].
When examining the relationships between archaeal Bfamily DNA polymerases, we unexpectedly observed that
in many Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, one of the Bfamily DNA polymerase paralogs, despite the high level of
overall sequence conservation, contains disrupted versions of the sequence motifs that are known to be essential for the catalytic functions. The polymerases of the Bfamily contain two enzymatic domain, namely, the N-ter-

minal 3'-exonuclease domain that performs proofreading
and the C-terminal polymerase proper domain [9,10]. In
the apparently inactivated archaeal polymerase, the
sequence motifs that in the active forms harbor the catalytic amino acids required for each of these activities are
partially disrupted (Fig. 1 and Additional File 1). In particular, the crucial, most conserved YGDTD motif that coordinates Mg2+ in B-family DNA polymerases and in which
both aspartates and the tyrosine are essential for the
polymerase activity [11-13] harbors at least two replacements in the apparently inactivated derivatives although it
is notable that the distal aspartate is conserved and so is
likely to retain an important function (Fig. 1). In addition,
the most conserved DIE motif (Exo I) of the N-terminal 3'exonuclease proofreading domain does not have a clear
counterpart in the corresponding part of the polymerase
derivatives described here (Additional File 1), strongly
suggesting that the exonuclease activity is inactivated as
well.
Phylogenetic analysis of archaeal B-family polymerases
showed that the inactivated forms comprised a distinct
clade with a 100% bootstrap support (Fig. 1). Moreover,
within this clade, the Euryarchaeal and Crenarchaeal
forms were clearly separated, also with full bootstrap support, and joined a third subclade that included similarly
inactivated homologs from three diverse bacteria (Fig. 1).
The presence of the inactivated DNA polymerases in
diverse subsets of both Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota
is compatible with an ancient duplication of the DNA
polymerase gene followed by inactivation and parallel
loss in some of the lineages. However, a relatively later
duplication, inactivation and subsequent spread via horizontal gene transfer also could be a viable evolutionary
scenario for the inactivated polymerases.
Inactivation of the enzymatic function of a protein and
utilization of the inactivated protein for non-enzymatic
(structural) roles, so that it retains substantial sequence
conservation, is not without precedent. Perhaps, the cases
that are most relevant for the present finding are the
apparent inactivation of the small subunits of DNA
polymerases and the N-terminal 3'-exonuclease domains
in eukaryotes. In all Euryarchaeota, the small subunits of
PolD contain all sequence signature of the calcineurinelike superfamily of phosphoesterases [14] and have been
shown to possess 3'-exonuclease, proofreading activity
[15-17]. By contrast, in the eukaryotic orthologs of these
proteins, most of the catalytic residues are replaced, so the
protein apparently performs a structural role in the
polymerase complex [8,14]. Another example is the inactivation of the N-terminal 3'-exonuclease domain in two
eukaryotic members of the polB family, pol α and pol ζ.
Despite the overall high level of sequence conservation,
the catalytic residues in the exonuclease domains of these

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/32

polymerases are replaced with amino acid residues that
cannot function in the proofreading reaction, so structural
roles have been proposed for these domains [2,18]. To
our knowledge, the PolB derivative described here is the
first case of an evolutionarily conserved and, by implication, functionally important but, apparently, inactive
DNA polymerase. Conceivably, this protein is involved in
archaeal DNA replication, perhaps, as a structural subunit
of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme [14,19]. Determination of the function of this unusual protein should yield
significant insight into archaeal DNA replication.

version.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Purificacion Lopez-Garcia, Universite Paris-Sud
Rogozin and co-workers report here an interesting observation. They identify a highly conserved clade of B-family
polymerases grouping euryarchaeotal, crenarchaeotal and
also some bacterial sequences whose Mg2+-binding motif
has several replacements from the canonical YGDTD,
notably the tyrosine and one of the aspartates that are
essential during polymerization. They propose that these
amino acid changes lead to inactivated enzymes that
might have retained a purely structural role. This is a justified in silico prediction that, however, remains to be
tested. In particular, it would be important to see whether
the enzymatic activity actually disappears or whether
some kind of activity can still be performed, or performed
under particular conditions and with precise partners.
One of the aspartates involved in polymerization remains
very well conserved in this motif; the same is true for
another aspartate upstream in the sequence. Such
sequence conservation at long evolutionary distances
might indicate more than an exclusive structural function.
I hope that this observation will foster the appropriate
biochemical work downstream. I would recommend the
authors to insist on the hypothetical nature of their prediction, which they do in parts of the text by speaking
about 'apparently inactivated' polymerases, through all of
it including the title and the figure legend.

Authors' response: We appreciate the comments and included
additional qualifications in the text; we also emphasize the conservation and probable functional importance of the distal
aspartate in the Mg2+-binding motif. However, we also stress

Figure 1 derivatives of B-family DNA polymerases in archaea: inactivation of the principal catalytic motif and phylogeny
Inactivated
Inactivated derivatives of B-family DNA polymerases in archaea: inactivation of the principal catalytic motif
and phylogeny. The right part of the figure shows the sequences of the essential Mg2+-binding motif of B-family DNA
polymerases for two families of active archaeal polymerase (top and middle) and the inactivated derivative (bottom). The
motifs are shown in the form of sequence LOGOs where the height of the amino acid symbols is a function of the frequency of
the given amino acid in the given position [20,21]. The left part of the figure shows a phylogenetic tree for archaeal B-family
DNA polymerases. Color code: purple, Euryarchaeota (E); green: Crenarchaeota (C); brown: organisms that might represent
distinct arcaheal phyla: Nanoarchaeota (N), Korarchaeota (K), and Thaumoarchaeota (T); black, bacteria (B). Each organism is
denoted by the full systematic name and the Gene Identifier (GI) number. Multiple sequence alignment of archaeal B-family
polymerases (Additional File 1) was constructed using the MUSCLE program [22]. The tree was built using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the MOLPHY program [23] by local rearrangement of an original Fitch tree [24]. The same
program was used to compute bootstrap values which are indicated (%) for selected major branches.

the obvious disruption of the catalytic motifs in the exonuclease
domain, an observation that suggests concordant inactivation
of both domains of these proteins.
Reviewer's report 2
Chris Ponting, Oxford University
Rogozin et al. have made the interesting observation that
some bacteria, euryarchaea and crenarchaea possess a
homologue of B family DNA polymerase that contains
substitutions within the YGDTD active site sequence. The
evidence that this represents a homologue whose function
is likely to be distinct from that of typical family B
polymerases is compelling. What function this might be is
uncertain, although the authors tentatively suggest an
atypical role in DNA replication. This study shows, lest we
ever forget, that demonstration of homology need not
always lead to a successful prediction of function.
