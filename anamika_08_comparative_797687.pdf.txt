Abstract
Background: Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a common event in many cellular processes.
Further, many kinases perform specialized roles and are regulated by non-kinase domains tethered
to kinase domain. Perturbation in the regulation of kinases leads to malignancy. We have identified
and analysed putative protein kinases encoded in the genome of chimpanzee which is a close
evolutionary relative of human.
Result: The shared core biology between chimpanzee and human is characterized by many
orthologous protein kinases which are involved in conserved pathways. Domain architectures
specific to chimp/human kinases have been observed. Chimp kinases with unique domain
architectures are characterized by deletion of one or more non-kinase domains in the human
kinases. Interestingly, counterparts of some of the multi-domain human kinases in chimp are
characterized by identical domain architectures but with kinase-like non-kinase domain.
Remarkably, out of 587 chimpanzee kinases no human orthologue with greater than 95% sequence
identity could be identified for 160 kinases. Variations in chimpanzee kinases compared to human
kinases are brought about also by differences in functions of domains tethered to the catalytic
kinase domain. For example, the heterodimer forming PB1 domain related to the fold of ubiquitin/
Ras-binding domain is seen uniquely tethered to PKC-like chimpanzee kinase.
Conclusion: Though the chimpanzee and human are evolutionary very close, there are
chimpanzee kinases with no close counterpart in the human suggesting differences in their
functions. This analysis provides a direction for experimental analysis of human and chimpanzee
protein kinases in order to enhance our understanding on their specific biological roles.

Background
Protein phosphorylation is a core process in many signal
transduction pathways which regulates various aspects of
cellular processes. Members of the family of protein

kinases mediate protein phosphorylation. The family of
Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases is one of the largest protein families. Members of this family are involved in regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell

growth and differentiation, cell cycle control, apoptosis,
transcription, cell motility and cell-cell communication.
By covalent tethering of phosphate group from ATP, protein kinases modify the functional activity of the substrates to result in changes in the levels of enzyme activity,
cellular location or association with various other proteins in the proximity [1]. The catalytic domain of protein
kinases is approximately 250–270 amino acids long and
shares a common three-dimensional fold [2]. Despite
these common features, protein kinases interact specifically with varieties of substrates and are regulated by a
variety of means such as binding of second messengers,
phosphorylation within and outside catalytic kinase
domain and association with adapter and regulatory subunits. The differing substrate specificities and modes of
regulation are contributed mainly by specific sequence
variations within the kinase domain as well as by the
occurrence of characteristic non-kinase domains tethered
to kinase domains in multi-domain kinases [3-5]. Since
protein kinases have great impact on various cellular processes, their cellular activity is tightly regulated. Any perturbation in protein kinase activity results in various diseases
such as cancer and tumor. As a result protein kinases are
popular drug targets in cancer therapeutics.
The family of protein kinases studied in this work comprises of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Various
protein kinases involved in signaling pathway are conserved from yeast to human [6]. Explicit analysis of the
human kinome made in our group [3] as well as in the
groups of Hunter and coworkers [7] and Kostich et al [8]
provided a comprehensive picture for the first time on the
repertoire of human kinases [9]. The availability of draft
version of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) genome by the
Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium [10]
has given us opportunity to decipher the role of protein
kinases in signaling pathway of our closest evolutionary
relative and to compare the protein kinases of chimpanzee with human in order to expand our understanding of
human biology. The draft version of the chimpanzee
genome revealed that the difference between chimpanzee
and human genome is only 1.2% [10,11] and the major
part of the genomic divergence could be attributed to
insertions and deletions (indels) [12]. Human specific
indels contribute towards human specific traits by changing the RNA and protein expression level [13] which
might leads to huge difference in the areas such as brain
size and behaviour. The divergence in the 3' UTR and 5'
UTR of chimpanzee genes contribute towards differences
in the gene regulation between human and chimpanzee
genomes [14].
The comparison of chimpanzee and human genome can
give valuable insight about the drastic differences in the
physiology (e.g. reproductive biology), anatomy (e.g.

unique vertebral column structure) and pathology (rare
occurrence of HIV progression to AIDS, neurodegenerative diseases, epithelial cancer, and resistance to Plasmodium falciparum infection in chimpanzee) between the
two genomes. The current analysis is, however, confined
to recognizing kinases that are common and different
between human and chimpanzee and the kinases that are
unique for chimpanzee or human. Comparison of chimpanzee and human kinomes will help us to study the
major differences and similarities between chimpanzee
and human signal transduction pathways involving protein kinases.
Analysis of kinomes of several organisms performed in
our group and in other groups [3,6,7,15-21] revealed that
kinase complement represents 2–3% of the proteome. In
the current study, using the sensitive bioinformatics
approaches previously established by us in the studies on
various kinomes [3,5,17,20,21] we have identified 587
putative protein kinases (PPKs) in chimpanzee and it corresponds to approximately 1.8% of the genome size. The
PPKs are further classified based upon Hanks and Hunter
classification scheme [22].
Classification of protein kinases into various Hanks and
Hunter subfamilies [22] reveals many kinases that are
conserved between chimpanzee and human, which
reflects functional constraints of these PPKs in the core of
signaling pathway. Apart from the kinase catalytic
domain, we present our analysis on other (accessory)
domains found tethered to the kinase domain. This information can be retrieved online from the KinG website
[23] at http://hodgkin.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~king. The final
list of PPKs identified in the chimpanzee genome has
been carefully arrived at after eliminating the redundant
sequences (identity>95%) and the sequences lacking key
functional residues like Aspartate (D) [acts as base –
accepts the proton from the attacking substrate hydroxyl
group during phosphotransfer mechanism] in the catalytic loop. Short and truncated sequences, which are less
than 200 amino acids long, have not been considered in
the present analysis. Hence all the sequences present in
the current analysis are likely to be active gene products.
The objective of this study is to identify, classify and annotate the protein kinases in chimpanzee genome and to
compare this preliminary kinome set with human which
is the closest relative of chimp.

Results and discussion
Chimpanzee and human putative protein kinases (PPKs)
are identified using the approach described in the Methods
section. Based upon Hanks and Hunter classification
scheme, these PPKs are further classified into various protein kinase subfamilies. Accessory domains, transmem-

brane segments if any, have also been identified.
Additional file 1 lists the kinases encoded in chimpanzee
genome with details of subfamily association for kinase
catalytic domain and domain architecture. Here, we
present repertoire of chimpanzee protein kinases, which
has been identified and analyzed for the first time, to the
best of our knowledge. Further, it has been compared with
the human kinome.

Table 1: Number of PPKs, in various Hanks and Hunter
subfamilies, identified from human and chimpanzee genomes

Many chimp kinases are unclassified as the extent of similarity of the catalytic regions to any of the previously
known kinase sub-families is very low. However many of
these unclassified chimp kinases have corresponding
closely-related human kinases. A dendrogram of unclassified chimp and human kinases (Figure 2) demonstrates
close relationship between unclassified kinases between
chimp and human. However a few chimp kinases without
a closely-related human counterpart can also be noticed.

We have identified 587 kinases from chimp genome using
various sophisticated sequence analysis and classification
procedures described in the section on Methods. We have
classified these kinases into various subfamilies and compared the distribution with that of human kinases (Table
1). As can be seen in Table 1 almost all the subfamilies of
protein kinases are represented in comparable population
in human and chimpanzee. This is in contrast to mouse
kinome in which there is dramatic expansion of Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) gene, loss of a few
protein kinase genes as compared to human kinome and
lineage specific protein kinases derived from retrotransposition [24]. These observations are consistent with our
notion of relatively higher evolutionary divergence
between human and mouse as compared to human and
chimp. However some of the chimpanzee kinases are radically different from the nearest human kinases (Table 2).
For example, a chimpanzee kinase classified as casein
kinase 1 (ENSPTRP00000001150) on the basis of significant sequence similarity (31%) of the catalytic domain
and excellent e-value (2e-16) with the casein kinase 1
from human. However this chimp kinase has a POLO
BOX tethered to the kinase catalytic domain. Thus this
chimp kinase represents a hybrid CK1_POLO kinase.
Interestingly
ENSEMBL
reports
that
ENSPTRP00000001150 has a high similarity with the
human kinase ENSP00000361275. However, according
to our classification protocol ENSP00000361275 is classified as a POLO kinase on the basis of 52% sequence identity with classical POLO kinases and excellent e-value of e112. Figure 1 shows the dendrogram of the CK1 sub-family of kinases and it highlights the significant divergence
of chimp homologue from its counterparts in other
organisms.

Though many kinases between chimp and human are
highly similar the cases of significant difference emerge
mainly due to difference in domain architecture of multidomain kinases of chimp and human. Following sections
discuss the differences between some of the chimp and
human kinases arising out of difference in domain tethering features. Additional file 2 shows amino acid sequence
alignments for some of the pairs of chimp and nearest
human kinases that are characterized by pronounced differences in terms of domain architecture.
Domain composition of chimpanzee kinome
Many of the protein kinases in higher eukaryote are multidomain proteins; the kinase domain is tethered to various
non-kinase domains. We examined the global domain
composition of 587 putative kinases encoded in the chimpanzee genome. Globally, 82 different domains, other
than kinase domains and Pkinase_C (the protein kinase C
terminal) domain, are seen in the 587 chimpanzee
kinases. A list of the most frequently found accessory
domains is provided in Table 3. The most frequent
domain tethered to protein kinase domain is the immunoglobulin I-set domain, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The I-set domain is found in a variety of
protein families. It is seen 96 times, but only in 34 proteins and it means that it often occurs as repeats. The second most frequent domain, Fibronectin type III domain
(fn3), belongs to the Ig-like fold superfamily. It also
occurs in repeats: it is seen 67 times in 27 PPKs. It is
involved in cell surface binding. Ankyrin repeat is the
most common protein-protein interaction motifs in
nature. It is seen 51 times in six chimpanzee PPKs. The
immunoglobulin domain (Ig), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is present 46 times in 29
PPKs is also found tethered to protein kinase domain as
repeats. SH2 domain acts as a regulatory module, by interacting with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides; it is
seen 32 times in 29 PPKs. C1_1 is the phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain, found tethered to diacylglycerol dependent protein kinases C (PKC). It is found 30
times in 22 PPKs. In the case of human protein kinases
also, the above mentioned non-kinase domains are most
frequently occurring as accessory domains to the protein
kinase domain.
Domain architecture analysis – chimpanzee-specific and
human-specific
In the recent Pfam version 22, the protein kinase domain
(PF00069) is seen in 771 different architectures, and the
protein tyrosine kinase domain (PF07714) is seen in 333
different architectures. In the repertoire of chimpanzee
protein kinases, out of 587 PPKs, 286 PPKs have accessory
domains tethered to the kinase domain. The rest of the
protein kinases do not have any other domain tethered to
the kinase domain.

The comparison of chimpanzee and human kinomes
revealed some organism-specific domain architectures
(see Methods section). We have also identified unusual
domain architectures. These domain architectures are
common only to human and chimpanzee with no or poor
representation in other organisms with known genomic
data at the present time. We describe here the chimpanzee
and human specific architectures and the unusual domain
architectures common to chimpanzee and human (Figure
3).

Chimpanzee specific multi-domain architectures of
kinases
We have identified three PPKs with chimpanzee specific
domain architectures, depicted in figure 3a. These PPKs
belong to the AGC group, the CAMK group and the Raf
kinase.

A protein (ENSPTRP00000000076), classified under PKC
subfamily, is composed of a PB1 domain followed by the
protein kinase domain which is followed by a protein
kinase C terminal domain (Figure 3a1). The PB1 domain
is present in many eukaryotic cytoplasmic signalling proteins and is responsible, although not systematically, in

the formation of PB1 dimers [25]. It thus serves as a
molecular recognition module. This architecture is known
so far only in an atypical PKC of Phallusia mammilata, a sea
squirt. Our analysis identified two chimpanzee PKCs and
a human PKC with a similar architecture, in which a phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain is inserted

between the PB1 and the protein kinase domain. The presence of the phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain
in combination with the protein kinase and a PKC terminal domain indicates that it is probably responsible for
the recruitment of diacylglycerol, which in turns might be
involved in activation of the kinase. The deletion of this

domain in chimpanzee PKC (ENSPTRP00000000076)
implies that the recruitment of diacylglycerol might be
achieved by an external interacting module.
In a chimpanzee PPK classified under the camk1 subfamily (ENSPTRP00000011569), the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is followed by the protein kinase
domain (Figure 3a2). The PH domain is seen in a variety
of intracellular signaling proteins. It can perform various
functions including binding of phosphorylated serine/
threonine residues [26], and interacting with calcium ion
and calmodulin. This protein, annotated as novel peptide,
is closely related to a human PKC (ENSP00000270202)
which has an inserted PKC domain at the C-terminal and
a longer protein kinase domain. We thus identified a
chimpanzee camk1 that is closely related to, but clearly
distinct from the nearest human counterpart.
A chimpanzee PPK belonging to the raf subfamily
(ENSPTRP00000037507), a novel peptide displays a
domain architecture with a RBD (Ras Binding Domain)
followed by the catalytic kinase domain (Figure 3a3). This
particular protein departs from the typical architecture
because it lacks a C1_1 domain (Phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain).
Chimp counterparts of a few human kinases are kinaselike non kinases
In the human kinome, we have identified a few multidomain protein kinases having high sequence identity
(more than 57%) with chimp homologues over the entire
length. These human kinases and the chimp counterparts
share almost the same domain architecture. Most interestingly these chimp homologues are unlikely to function as
a protein kinase (PKLNK) as they all lack the catalytic base

residue (Asp) (Figure 3b) compared to the nearest human
kinases.
We identified a human camk1 (ENSP00000311684) with
an architecture in which 6 Immunoglobulin domains (Iset) are followed by a fibronectin 3 domain (fn3), followed by two I-set domains, the protein kinase domain,
an I-set domain, a fn3 domain, and a second kinase catalytic domain. The close chimp homologue annotated as a
known peptide (ENSPTRP00000022133) has PKLNK
domain instead of the C-terminal protein kinase domain
in the human homologue. This chimp homologue lacks
the catalytic aspartate in the catalytic loop (Figure 3b1). Iset and fn3 domains are involved in various biological
functions such as cell-cell recognition and immune system, and are found in many protein families, including
receptor tyrosine kinases.
In the two human PPKs belonging to ptk8 subfamily
(ENSP00000371341 and ENSP00000323216) the protein kinase domain is followed by a Src homology 3
(SH3) domain and a GTPase binding domain. The SH3
domain is seen in signaling proteins related to cytoskeletal organisation [27]. Both these sequences are annotated
as 'known-ccds peptide' and are present in Refseq and
Genbank databanks as non-receptor tyrosine kinases.
These two human receptor protein kinases are very similar
to chimpanzee PKLNKs ENSPTRP00000027141 and
ENSPTRP00000027139 respectively (Figure 3b2) in terms
of identity between the protein kinase and PKLNK
domain and domain architecture.
A related and unique architecture, with an additional Cterminal ubiquitin associated domain, is seen in human
PPK (ENSP00000329425) which belongs to ptk8 subfamily. The ubiquitin associated domain is seen in many

signaling proteins [28]. ENSP00000329425 is also annotated as a known-cdds peptide and is highly similar to a
chimpanzee PKLNK, ENSPTRP00000027136 (Figure
3b3). The fact that these human PPKs with unique architectures are related to non functional chimpanzee kinases
is intriguing since they indicate a loss of kinase function
in chimpanzee and gain of kinase function in human during the course of primate evolution. These PKLNKs in
chimpanzee might be involved in various cellular processes through protein-protein interaction.

We identified, in human and chimpanzee kinomes,
domain architecture of catalytic protein kinase domain
which is closely related to AGC group followed by PDZ
domain. Such a domain combination is not found in
other kinomes. The human PPK (ENSP00000261569),
which is the counterpart of ENSPTRP00000029005 of the
chimpanzee kinome, is the microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (Swiss prot entry:
O15021) which is shown to be highly expressed in the
brain [31].

A human putative tyrosine kinase, ENSP00000306717
(belonging to ptk17 subfamily), has an unusual architecture which is human specific, where the protein kinase
domain is following an Ldl receptor A domain (Low density lipoprotein receptor domain class A) and a MAM
domain (Figure 3b4). The Ldl receptor A domain is a short
domain that is able to bind Ldl and calcium [29] and the
MAM domain is commonly found in receptors and is
thought to have an adhesive function. These domains
could thus be implicated in the binding of the ligand to
the extracellular part of the protein. No close chimp
homologue to this human kinase could be identified.

A combination of PX, MIT and the protein kinase domain
is seen in chimpanzee PPK (ENSPTRP00000003319), a
novel peptide, and one human PPK (ENSP0000035592
7), labeled as known-cdds. PX domain is a phosphoinositides binding domain and MIT is the microtubule
interacting and transport domain. Human PPK
(ENSP00000355927) is highly similar to the Ribosomal
protein S6 kinase delta-1 (swiss-prot entry Q96S38)
which is known to be expressed in brain [32,33].

Unusual domain architectures: Domain architectures
conserved only between chimpanzee and human kinomes
We have identified domain architectures in human and
chimpanzee kinomes that are poorly or not represented in
kinomes of other organisms. These architectures, represented in Figure 3c, fall into the AGC, CK1 and the PTK
groups.
AGC group
Two AGC PPKs, ENSPTRP00000001185 from chimpanzee and ENSP00000361078 from human, both annotated
as 'novel peptide', display an architecture in which a
domain of unknown function (DUF 1908) is followed by
the protein kinase domain and the PKC terminal domain.
DUF 1908 is present in 29 structural eukaryotic proteins
in Pfam. Additionally, 14 sequences in Pfam display a
similar architecture with an additional C-terminal PDZ
domain. Our current survey identified 3 chimpanzee PPKs
and 3 human PPKs with this architecture. The PDZ
domain that is present in these 6 sequences, but absent
from chimpanzee (ENSPTRP00000001185) and human
(ENSP00000361078), is 80 to 90 amino-acid long
domain and found tethered to diverse signaling proteins.
It is involved in protein-protein interaction, and has the
capability to bind the C-terminal part of its partner [30].
This suggests that PDZ domains could be involved in ligand recruitment. The lack of PDZ domains in one chimpanzee kinase and its relative in human implies that a
compensatory external binding module would be needed
to perform the function.

CAMK group
CAMK kinases have fibronectin 3 (fn3) and immunoglobulin I-set domains in a variety of combinations. We identified 4 types of architectures in PPKs which are closely
related to camk1 subfamily, and are not present in
kinomes of other organisms:

- 'fn3 x 2, I-set, fn3 x 3, I-set, fn3 x 2, I-set, fn3 x 3, I-set, fn3
x 3, I-set x 2, fn3 x 2, I-set x 2, fn3, Pkinase, I-set x 10' : this
architecture is seen in a chimpanzee PPK (novel peptide
ENSPTRP00000021693) and a human PPK (novel peptide ENSP00000343764).
- 'I-set x 8, fn3, Pkinase, I-set': in two chimpanzee PPKs
(novel
peptides
ENSPTRP00000046634
and
ENSPTRP00000045642) and two human PKKs
(ENSP00000353452,
a
novel
peptide
and
ENSP00000354004, a known peptide). The latter corresponds to myosin light chain kinase (swissprot entry
Q15746).
- 'I-set x 7, fn3, Pkinase, I-set' : in a chimpanzee PPK (novel
peptide ENSPTRP00000026393) and in a human PPK
(known peptide ENSP00000320622). The latter sequence
corresponds to the entry NP_444254 in the RefSeq database of NCBI and it is the isoform 2 of Myosin light chain
kinase.
- 'I-set, Pkinase': in a chimpanzee PPK (novel peptide
ENSPTRP00000028713) and a human PPK (known peptide ENSP00000339291).

CK1 group
A Filament domain is seen associated to the protein
kinase domain of chimpanzee PPK (ENSPTRP000000119
29) and human PPK (ENSP00000263802). Filament
domains are components of the cytoskeleton and the
nuclear envelope [34]. To our knowledge, this kind of
domain composition having protein kinase domain and
Filament domain together is identified here for the first
time.
PTK group
Four domain architectures seen in PTK group are poorly
or not represented in kinomes of other organisms. A
chimpanzee PPK (the novel peptide ENSPTRP00000001
085) and a human PPK (the known-ccds
ENSP00000361554) have an architecture composed of an
immunoglobulin domain, followed by a Laminin EGFlike domain, an EGF domain, three fibronectin 3 domains
and the catalytic protein kinase domain. A transmembrane helix is predicted with high confidence between the
fibrnonectin 3 domain and the kinase domain. Laminin
EGF-like domain is found in laminin which is the constituent of basement membranes. The functional role of EGF
(epidermal growth factor) domain is unclear; it is seen in
a variety of membrane and secreted proteins [35]. This
architecture is not seen in kinomes of other organisms but
a related architecture lacking the fn3 domains is reported
for 6 sequences. It is related to a tyrosine-protein kinase
receptor Tie-1 (corresponds to swissprot entry P35590),
and is specifically known to express in developing vascular endothelial cells.

A combination of two EGF hand domains with three
fibronectin 3 domains, followed by a transmembrane
domain and the protein kinase domain is seen in a chimpanzee PPK (ENSPTRP00000035632, a novel peptide),
and in a human PPK (ENSP00000343716, labeled as
known-ccds) and corresponding to the Tyrosine-protein
kinase receptor TIE-2 (swissprot entry Q02763). This
architecture is present in a sequence of mimivirus. A
related architecture with only one EGF domain is seen in
chimpanzee PPK (ENSPTRP00000035635), and in a
human PPK (ENSP00000369375, embl entry CAI16055)
which is the TEK tyrosine kinase. Such architecture is not
yet known to occur in kinomes of other organisms.
ENSPTRP00000040876, a chimpanzee PPK annotated as
a novel peptide in the genome dataset and the human
PPK ENSP00000350224 which is also labeled a novel
peptide, are composed of a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
domain and a protein kinase domain. This architecture
has not known to occur in other kinomes. BTK domain is
a Zinc-binding motif domain [36], usually found associated to other domains like, pleckstrin homology and Src
homology domains.

Orthologous protein kinase pairs of chimpanzee and
human
In the current analysis, we have compared 587 PPKs in the
chimpanzee genome with human kinases and identified
orthologous kinases. To compare genes across these two
organisms and to identify the orthologues, we have considered two features: 1) The full length of the two gene
products have been compared with the condition that the
difference in number of residues of orthologues should
not be more than 50. 2) The classification of kinase catalytic domains of orthologues should correspond to same
subfamilies of kinases under Hanks and Hunter classification scheme. There are 470 orthologous pairs which we
have identified in the current analysis. This information
can be found in Additional file 3. A comprehensive comparison of the predicted protein kinases shared by the
chimpanzee and human indicates that nearly 81% of the
chimpanzee protein kinases have putative orthologs in
human genome. Interestingly 427 out of 470 orthologous
pairs are characterized by a high sequence identity of at
least 95%. For 117 chimpanzee kinases we did not detect
human orthologues based on the criteria we have used.
Many of these kinases have substantially different lengths
and are characterized by differences in domain tethering
preferences discussed above.
Comparison of human and chimp transcriptome
The comparison of humans and chimpanzees with respect
to differences in expression levels and protein-coding
sequences for genes active in brain, heart, liver, kidney,
and testis is available [37]. This data on expression levels
was extensively studied by Khaitovich et al [38] who have
analyzed the difference in the expression levels of various
human and chimp proteins. From these papers we have
obtained the information pertaining to the difference in
the expression level of protein kinase genes between
human and chimp in five different tissue types and this
data is presented in Additional file 4.

The Additional file 4 highlights the 100 human protein
kinase genes which have different expression level as compared to the corresponding chimp protein. As can be seen
from this Additional file for many kinases difference in
the expression levels in various organs are rarely above 1.
So, as concluded in the original analysis [37,38] the
expression levels of most chimp and human proteins at
various organs are highly comparable. However the most
pronounced difference corresponds to expression of a
CaMK (ENSG00000071575) in brain (difference of more
than 7). But difference in expression of the same kinase in
other organs is not as pronounced as in brain. Considering kinases with differences in domain architecture, a
human protein kinase gene (ENSG00000104936) which
encodes for agc_other subfamily is lacking putative transmembrane domain as compared to its close chimp homo-

logue (Table 2) and the difference of the gene expression
level as compared to chimp is more in brain as compared
to liver, kidney, heart and testis suggesting variation of
gene expression level of this gene in the brain tissues of
the two mammals.

Conclusion
In this report we have made an effort to understand the
repertoire of protein kinases in the chimpanzee which has
close kinship with human. The comprehensive list and
classification of protein kinases in chimpanzee genome
presented in this report is a valuable resource for future
signaling research for these closely related organisms.
Identification of various PK subfamilies indicates that the
core signaling pathway involving PK is well conserved
between chimpanzee and human. This implies conserved
steps in the signaling pathways in chimpanzee and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/625

human involving protein kinase as central player. However, substantial number of chimpanzee kinases deviates
markedly in terms of the domain combination/architecture resulting in unique varieties of functional domain
combinations. Considerations of functions of modules
which are tethered to the protein kinase domain enable us
to predict the functional role of PPKs in the chimpanzee
genome. Results obtained from this study adds new facets
to the contribution of protein kinases in signal transduction of chimpanzee and comparative kinome gives us
insights about evolution of protein kinases in two closely
related species. Given the importance of protein kinases in
signaling, experimental analysis would be fruitful to dissect the signaling system of chimpanzee and will provide
valuable insight into the similarities and differences
between chimpanzee and human signaling pathways.

Methods
In this paper, we have identified and classified chimpanzee protein kinases on the basis of the amino acid
sequences of putative proteins encoded in the chimpanzee genome. We have compared them with updated list of
human protein kinases.
Data
The chimpanzee and human proteome data are retrieved
from the ENSEMBL database [39] release 46 (August
2007). The chimpanzee proteome data is based on the 2.1
genome assembly released by the Chimpanzee Sequencing Consortium in March 2006 [10]. The genome coverage is more than 94% for euchromatic genome http://
www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/chimp/.
Chimpanzee
proteome is composed of 33,167 protein sequences, generated from an automatic annotation system based on
biological evidences [40]. The human genome was used as
a guide for annotation, by projecting the human gene
models onto the chimpanzee genome. The number of
experimentally characterized proteins in chimpanzee is
very low. In the present data set, 3,373 protein sequences
(10% of the data) are labeled as "known peptides", which
means that these proteins were mapped to entries in
Swiss-Prot, RefSeq or SPTrEMBL during the annotation
process. The remaining 29,794 (90% of the data), that
could not be mapped to known proteins, are annotated as
"novel peptides".

The human proteome data is based on the NCBI 36
assembly of the human genome, released in November
2005. It is composed of 43,570 protein sequences: 3,614
"novel peptides", 18,642 "known peptides" and 21,314
"known-ccds peptides". The "known-ccds" annotation
means that these sequences are part of a core set consistently annotated, high quality data in the frame of the
Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) project.
Protein kinase detection and analysis
Protein kinases are identified using a combination of profile-based search methods such as PSI-BLAST [41] and
RPS-BLAST [42] using multiple profiles (MulPSSM)
[43,44]. MulPSSM approach has been previously benchmarked and has been used in our previous kinome analysis for several other genomes [3,5,17,20,21]. Summary of
the main steps involved in the current analysis is presented in Figure 4.

On the one hand, the proteome of interest is searched for
the protein sequences of Pfam families PF00069 (Protein
kinase domain, 54 sequences) and PF007714 (Protein
tyrosine kinase, 152 sequences). On the other hand, we
use multiple PSSMs created for the 55 protein kinase
classes [45] represented in Hanks and Hunter classification scheme [22] as query to search against the proteome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/625

using RPS-BLAST. For associating a kinase into its Hanks
and Hunter subfamily we consider only those hits with
sequence identity greater than 30% with bonafide members of the subfamily and the profile alignment coverage
greater than 70%.
The results of PSI-BLAST and RPS-BLAST searches have
been merged into a single list of putative protein kinases
which are further refined using several criteria. Sequences
shorter than 200 amino-acids are excluded, as it is well
known that the usual length of catalytic region is approximately 250 to 300 amino-acids [22]. Redundancy level is
reduced to 100% using cd-hit program [46]. The presence
of the catalytic aspartate, essential for the catalytic activity
[22], is checked to distinguish between Putative Protein
Kinases (PPKs) and Protein Kinase-Like Non-Kinases
(PKLNK). Catalytic aspartate has been detected from the
multiple sequence alignment of PPK kinase domain generated by clustalW [47] and by manually checking the
RPS-BLAST and PSI-BLAST outputs. Suspicious cases were
submitted for fold prediction using the PHYRE [48]http:/
/www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/. After reducing the redundancy level to 95%, we obtain a final set of 587 chimpanzee PPKs. These PPKs are classified according to Hanks
and Hunter classification scheme [22]. The population
and distribution of chimpanzee protein kinases into various subfamilies has been described in Additional file 5.
Further, non kinase domains were analyzed using
HMMER [49,50]. Transmembrane regions were detected
using TMHMM program [51].
Identification of organism specific kinase architectures and
unusual domain architectures
Protein kinase domain is commonly found tethered to
accessory domains; the ordered list of domains along a
sequence defines its domain architecture. Here, we compare domain architectures seen in human and chimpanzee kinomes and extract organism-specific and unusual
domain architectures. A domain architecture is said to be
organism-specific if it is found to belong to a particular
kinase sub-family in an organism but not in the same
kinase family of the other organisms. We also define unusual domain architecture as domain architectures identified only in human and chimpanzee kinases, but not
present or poorly represented in kinomes of other organisms.

Domains are detected using HMMER and Pfam domain
library, and families are defined based upon the Hanks
and Hunter classification scheme. Unique and unusual
architectures are further checked to ensure that the
uniqueness (or unusualness) is not the result of family
misclassification or domain mis-assignment. Only significant cases are reported here.

Kinase regulatory module detection
We searched for the regulatory domains of various PK
families. The detection is achieved by RPS-BLAST using
multiple profiles of regulatory domains. Sequences of
PKA regulatory domains, calmodulins and cyclins were
retrieved from the well-annotated sequence data base
swiss-prot [52] using the hierarchical classification of
Expasy http://www.expasy.org at the family level. Multiple profiles were generated for each regulatory protein as
described in [43] with 44, 89 and 296 sequences of PKA
regulatory domains, calmodulins and cyclins respectively.
The resulting multiple PSSMs were used to detect the putative protein kinase's regulatory elements.
Orthology detection
In order to detect orthologous protein kinase pairs
between chimpanzee and human, we compared the predicted protein kinases by carrying out all against all
BLAST. Firstly, chimpanzee PPK sequences have been used
as query against the database of predicted human kinome
and secondly predicted human PPK sequences have been
used as query against the database of predicted chimpanzee kinome. If the two given sequences are almost of equal
length (length difference should not be more than 50
amino acids) and belonging to the same subfamily of protein kinase, then we have considered the two genes as
orthologues. Close orthologues have been identified by
using a further condition of sequence identity should be
greater than 95%.
Phylogenetic analysis
For the phylogenetic analysis MEGA software [53] has
been used to generate dendrogram showing the various
subfamilies of predicted protein kinases. Multiple
sequence alignment of the kinase domains (generated
using clustalW) has been used as input. Maximum parsimony method has been used to generate the dendrogram.
