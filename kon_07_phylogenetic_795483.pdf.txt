Abstract
Background: The lancelet Asymmetron inferum (subphylum Cephalochordata) was recently
discovered on the ocean floor off the southwest coast of Japan at a depth of 229 m, in an anaerobic
and sulfide-rich environment caused by decomposing bodies of the sperm whale Physeter
macrocephalus. This deep sulfide-rich habitat of A. inferum is unique among the lancelets. The
distinguishing adaptation of this species to such an extraordinary habitat can be considered in a
phylogenetic framework. As the first step of reconstruction of the evolutionary processes in this
species, we investigated its phylogenetic position based on 11 whole mitochondrial genome
sequences including the newly determined ones of the whale-fall lancelet A. inferum and two coralreef congeners.
Results: Our phylogenetic analyses showed that extant lancelets are clustered into two major
clades, the Asymmetron clade and the Epigonichthys + Branchiostoma clade. A. inferum was in the
former and placed in the sister group to A. lucayanum complex. The divergence time between A.
inferum and A. lucayanum complex was estimated to be 115 Mya using the penalized likelihood (PL)
method or 97 Mya using the nonparametric rate smoothing (NPRS) method (the middle
Cretaceous). These are far older than the first appearance of large whales (the middle Eocene, 40
Mya). We also discovered that A. inferum mitogenome (mitochondrial genome) has been subjected
to large-scale gene rearrangements, one feature of rearrangements being unique among the
lancelets and two features shared with A. lucayanum complex.
Conclusion: Our study supports the monophyly of genus Asymmetron assumed on the basis of the
morphological characters. Furthermore, the features of the A. inferum mitogenome expand our
knowledge of variation within cephalochordate mitogenomes, adding a new case of transposition
and inversion of the trnQ gene. Our divergence time estimation suggests that A. inferum remained
a member of the Mesozoic and the early Cenozoic large vertebrate-fall communities before shifting
to become a whale-fall specialist.

Background
The subphylum Cephalochordata (lancelets), one of the
basal groups of living chordates [1,2], appears to have
maintained its basic body plan for several hundred million years [3,4]. Lancelets are widely distributed in tropical and temperate shallow seas and consist of three genera
(Branchiostoma, Epigonichthys, and Asymmetron) with more
than 30 known living species [5-8]. Adults are benthic,
inhabiting sandy and shell/sand bottoms of clear seawater, while larvae are planktonic in both inshore and offshore areas (ca. 1.5 to 4 months duration) [5,9-11]. For a
long time, it has been believed that the lancelets prefer
such aerobic conditions, whereas recently a new lancelet
Asymmetron inferum was discovered in an anaerobic and
sulfide-rich bottom [7]. This species is only distinguishable morphologically from congeners by the number of
myomeres [7].
In July 2003, during the Hyper-Dolphin/Natsushima
cruise of the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center
(JAMSTEC), 26 specimens of A. inferum were collected
from bottom sand subjacent to the decomposing bones of
the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus at a depth of 229
m, off Cape Nomamisaki, Kyushu Island, southwest Japan
(Fig. 1). Twelve dead whales that had been stranded on
the southwestern coast of Kyushu Island were submerged
in February 2002, and then were observed to study the
faunal composition and succession of the biological communities associated with whale-falls [12]. The submerged
bodies of whales on the floor provided rich pickings that
resulted in substantial amounts of organic material, lipids, and sulfides for dense biological community comprising of the mytillid mussels Adipicola pacifica and A. crypta
[13,14] and the bone-eating marine worm Osedax japonicus [15]. A. inferum is also a member of this community
[12].
This deep (>200 m) and sulfide-rich habitat is unique to
A. inferum in the lancelets. A sulfide-rich environment –
including hydrogen sulfide – is generally toxic to macroorganisms. Therefore, the adaptation of this species to
such a lethal environment is an intriguing phenomenon,
but the phylogenetic framework for understanding its
processes has not yet been established. Nohara et al. [16]
conducted molecular phylogenetic analysis of the intrarelationships of some lancelets using whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences, but A. inferum
and two congeneric species of A. lucayanum complex [8]
were not included. To know the phylogenetic position of
the whale-fall lancelet A. inferum, we determined the
whole mitogenome sequences from three species of the
genus Asymmetron including this species (A. inferum,
Asymmetron sp. A, and Asymmetron sp. C [=A. lucayanum
sensu stricto] in A. lucayanum complex [8]) to compare
with the published data for Nohara's A. lucayanum [16]

Features of A. inferum mitogenome
The nucleotide sequences from the mitogenomes of the
three Asymmetron species have been deposited in DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers of
AP009352 for A. inferum, AP009353 for Asymmetron sp. A,
and AP009354 for Asymmetron sp. C (=A. lucayanum sensu
stricto). The total lengths of the A. inferum, Asymmetron sp.
A, and Asymmetron sp. C mitogenomes were 15,084,
15,050, and 15,100 bp, respectively. Mitogenomes of the
mentioned species of Asymmetron, each contained 37
genes for large- and small-subunit ribosomal RNAs (rrnL
and rrnS, respectively), 22 transfer RNAs (trnX; X is the
standard single-letter amino acid code), and 13 proteins
(ATP synthetase subunits 6 and 8 [atp6 and atp8], cyto-

chrome c oxidase subunits I-III [cox1-3], NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1–6 and 4L [nad1-6 and 4L], and
cytochrome b apoenzyme [cob]), as is generally the case
with metazoan mitogenomes (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2). The
mitogenome organization of Asymmetron sp. A and Asymmetron sp. C was identical to that of Asymmetron sp. B (=
Nohara's A. lucayanum [16]), while that of A. inferum was
unique among the lancelets.

Phylogenetic relationships
Partitioned Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analysis
of the 11 mitogenomes from the concatenated nucleotide
sequences from 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes,
plus 2 rRNA genes (dataset #1) under the general time
reversible model with gamma correction and invariablesite assumption (GTR + I + Γ) [19] yielded a topology with
resolution of the branching pattern among lancelets. All
nodes were supported by higher Bayesian posterior probabilities (100%). BI analysis using dataset #2 (triplets converted amino acid sequences) under mtREV + I + Γ [20]
(for protein-coding genes) and GTR + I + Γ (for tRNA and
rRNA genes) models produced the same tree topology
(Fig. 3). All nodes were supported by higher Bayesian posterior probabilities (100%). Maximum-likelihood (ML)

The mitogenome of A. inferum contained 13 protein-coding genes, of which one reading-frame overlapped on the
same strand (atp8 and atp6 shared 7 nucleotides). Ten
protein-coding genes (atp6, cob, cox2, cox3, nad1-4,
nad4L, and nad6) started with ATG, the other protein
genes (atp8, cox1, and nad5) with GTG (Table 1). Stop
codons of protein-coding genes were TAA in the atp8, cob,
cox1, nad2-4, and nad6; TA in the cox3, and nad4L; and T
in the atp6, cox2, nad1, and nad5. For those genes with an
incomplete stop codon, the transcripts would be modified
to form the complete termination signal UAA by polyadenylation after cleavage of the polycistronic RNA, as demonstrated for other metazoan mitogenomes [17]. There
were 22 tRNA genes, which were clustered or individually
scattered in the genome. The tRNA genes ranged in size
from 57 to 71 nucleotides, large enough for the encoded
tRNAs to fold into the cloverleaf secondary structure characteristic of tRNAs. The trnS(gcu) and trnC lacked the
DHU arm, like Branchiostoma floridae [18]. The ribosomal genes (rrnS and rrnL) of A. inferum were 854 bp and
1360 bp, respectively. They were located, as in other lancelets, between the trnP and trnL(uaa) genes, being separated by the trnF and trnV genes. There were two major
unassignable regions (MUS) longer than 40 bp in the A.
inferum mitogenome. One of the regions (MUS1, 45 bp)
was located at the identical position to MUS in the mitogenomes of the A. lucayanum complex (between the cox1
and cox3 genes) [16]. The other region (MUS2, 48 bp),
located between the trnM and nad2 genes, was unique
among the lancelet mitogenomes.

analysis using dataset #1 under the transversional substitution model with gamma correction and invariable-site
assumption (TVM + I + Γ) produced exactly the same tree
topology as that found in the BI analyses (figure not
shown). Most nodes were supported by high bootstrap
probabilities (>98%), with the exception of a clade comprising B. lanceolatum and B. floridae (77%). Heuristic
maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of the dataset #1 also
produced the identical tree topology as in the above analyses (figure not shown). The MP analysis yielded the single most parsimonious tree, with a length of 23,178 steps
(consistency index [CI], 0.605; retention index [RI],
0.455; and rescaled consistency index [RC], 0.275). Most

nodes were supported by high bootstrap values (>92%),
with the exception of the same clade (B. lanceolatum + B.
floridae) as in ML analysis (56%).
Divergence time estimation
As a high rate of heterogeneity among lineages of lancelets
was observed by the two-cluster test [21], we used two different molecular dating methods, the penalized likelihood (PL) [22]) based on the BI tree (dataset #2) and the
nonparametric rate smoothing (NPRS) [23] based on the
ML tree (dataset #1). The divergence time between A.
inferum and A. lucayanum complex was estimated to be

Discussion
Phylogenetic position of A. inferum
Our phylogenetic analyses of mitogenome sequences for
eight lancelets using Bayesian inference (BI), maximum
likelihood (ML), and maximum parsimony (MP) methods show that extant lancelets are clustered into two
major clades: the Asymmetron clade and the Epigonichthys
+ Branchiostoma clade (Fig. 3). This result is consistent
with the findings of Nohara et al. [16]. The topology of the
resulting trees implies that the asymmetrical arrangement
of gonads seen paraphyletically in the genus Asymmetron
and Epigonichthys can be regarded as a plesiomorphic feature, supporting the hypothesis that the gonadal symmetry in the genus Branchiostoma was derived from the
asymmetric Epigonichthys-like ancestor [16]. Nishikawa
[7] recovered the genus Asymmetron as a valid genus distinct from another valid genus Epigonichthys based on four
morphological characters as follows: the elongated urostyloid process, marked metapleuran asymmetry, intercirral membrane with abrupt height change between lateral
and ventral ones, and posterior shift of the cirral skeletal
ring [24] with its anterodorsal extremity located at (or

sometimes behind) the fourth myomere. The present
molecular phylogeny shows that these morphological
characters of the Asymmetron species are phylogenetically
informative, supporting his claim. Although the A. lucayanum complex includes deep divergence (p-distance = 19%
in cox1 of mitogenome [8]), A. inferum is placed on the sister group to this species complex, not nested within it (Fig.
3). This result indicates that the whale-fall lancelet A.
inferum was diverged from the circumtropical lancelet A.
lucayanum complex before the ancient separation in this
complex [8].
Gene rearrangement of A. inferum
We discovered that the A. inferum mitogenome has been
subjected to large-scale gene rearrangements. To elucidate
the relative timing of these gene rearrangements, we
mapped gene orders of the lancelet mitogenome onto the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). Gene orders of Epigonichthys
and Branchiostoma are similar to that of typical vertebrate
mitogenomes [25], with the exception of slight differences in the location of four tRNA genes [18]. Therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that the ancestral lancelet gene
order is almost the same as that of the Epigonichthys and
Branchiostoma. The A. inferum mitogenome has three
novel gene positions: (1) an inversion extending from the

trnL(uag) to nad6 genes; (2) transposition of the cox3 and
nad3 genes from between the atp6 and the trnR genes to
between the cox1 and trnS(uga) genes; and (3) an inversion of the trnQ gene and its transposition from between
the trnM and nad2 genes to between the nad3 and the
trnS(uga) genes. The gene order of this mitogenome can
be parsimoniously explained by the following steps:
events (1) and (2) occurred in the ancestor of all Asymmetron species, event (3) subsequently occurred in the lineage
of A. inferum, and event (4) (see [16]) occurred in the
ancestor of A. lucayanum complex (Fig. 2). In other words,
novel gene positions (1) and (2) represent molecular
synapomorphies shared among the Asymmetron species,
and novel gene position (4) is the synapomorphy of A.
lucayanum species complex.
Gene position (3) and existence of MUS2 are unique to A.
inferum. MUS2, located at the identical position of trnQ in
the mitogenomes of A. lucayanum complex, appears to be
a trnQ pseudogene because of its sequence similarity to
the acceptor and anticodon arm regions of trnQ of A.
inferum and complement sequences of that of A. lucayanum complex (Fig. 6). Therefore, gene arrangement pattern (3) may have resulted from two events as follows: the
inversion of trnQ gene occurred at the original position by
recombination of the mitogenome as a possible cause for

pattern (1) [16], followed by transposition, involving a
tandem genomic duplication and subsequent random
deletions of the duplicated part, as invoked for many cases
of gene rearrangement in animal mitogenomes ([25] and
references therein).
When and how did A. inferum become a whale-fall
specialist?
A. inferum is considered as whale-fall specialist. This species has been found only in the whale-fall community at
the “sulfophilic stage” (fueled by anaerobic breakdown of
bone lipids) and has never been found elsewhere including shallow waters, wood-falls, cold seeps, or hydrothermal vents [7,15]. Therefore, it is natural to suppose that
this lancelet may make use of the lipid-and-sulfide-rich or
the organic material as a food source like other community members [26]. So far as the gross anatomy is concerned, there are no significant differences between A.
inferum and its shallow-water congeners [7], which indicates that A. inferum may be a filter-feeder like its congeners. The mechanism of feeding of this whale-fall lancelet
still remains as an open question.

When did A. inferum adapt to sulfide-rich environment?
To examine the timing of A. inferum lineage, we estimated
the divergence time between A. inferum and the other spe-

appearance of the large whales, based on the molecular
clock. In the whale-fall bathymodiolin bivalves of the genera Adipicola and Idas, the divergence time (<30 Mya, the
middle Oligocene) is synchronous with the major radiation of unequivocally oceanic whales [32,33], based on
molecular age estimation (inferred from [26,34]) and the
fossil records [35]. This synchronicity suggests that high
sulfide-rich habitats derived from large whales with oilrich bones [36] may play an important role in the divergences of Osedax, Adipicola, and Idas. Their tolerance and
utilization of sulfide may have already been developed at
the time of their invasion into whale-fall communities,
because their sister groups are chemosymbiotic
[26,30,34], provided actually or potentially with these
abilities.

cies of Asymmetron inhabiting coral reefs. With a slight difference between two resultant estimations of 115 Mya
(Fig. 4) and 97 Mya (Fig. 5) (the middle Cretaceous),
these appear far older than the first appearance of large
whales, represented by the inshore archeocetacean Basilosaulus (40 Mya, the middle Eocene) [27]. Therefore, an A.
inferum-like ancestor seems to have become a member of
the whale-fall community after more than 57 million
years of the emergence of A. inferum lineage (Figs. 4 and
5). Prior to the appearance of large whales, there were the
Cenozoic or Mesozoic large fishes (e.g., the giant fossil
shark Carcharocles, 10–20 m long; the ichthyodectid
Xiphactinus, 4.2 m long) and the Mesozoic reptiles (e.g.
ichthyosaurus [<16 m long] and plesiosaurus [<14 m
long]) in the sea [4]. These large fishes and reptiles in the
Mesozoic may have played an ecological role similar to
the whales on the sea floor, as suggested by Martill et al.
[28] and Hogler [29]. A. inferum may have been a member
of these large vertebrate-fall communities before becoming a whale-fall specialist.
Another whale-fall specialist, the bone-eating marine
worm Osedax also shows ancient divergence time (> 100
Mya) from its sister group (vestimentiferans + Sclerolinum)
(inferred from [30]); however, the divergence time within
Osedax (<42 Mya) [15,30,31] coincides with the first

Unlike these whale-fall specialists, the A. inferum-like
ancestor might have had a very low sulfide tolerance,
because its sister group, A. lucayanum complex, and all the
remaining lancelets inhabit aerobic environments [37].
This does not necessarily deny our hypothesis that A.
inferum lineage may have started its life-mode as a vertebrate-fall specialist in the Mesozoic, because, unlike modern whale-falls with oil-rich bones, the Mesozoic large
vertebrate-falls may possibly have lacked sulfophilic
stages during decomposition [35,36], resulting in a low
concentration of sulfide. Subsequently, the A. inferum lineage may have come to gain the sulfide tolerance to
become a whale-fall specialist.

Conclusion
The trees based on the whole mitogenome sequences
show that the whale-fall specialist A. inferum is the sister
group to the coral reef lancelet A. lucayanum complex, supporting the monophyly of the genus Asymmetron, assumed
on the basis of the morphological characters. Furthermore, the features of the A. inferum mitogenome expand
our knowledge of variation within cephalochordate
mitogenomes, adding new cases of inversion and transposition of the trnQ gene. Novel gene orders in Asymmetron
were found to be useful for phylogenetic inference.
The divergence time between A. inferum and its sister
group A. lucayanum complex is estimated to be 115 Mya
or 97 Mya (the middle Cretaceous), which is older than
the first appearance of large whales (40 Mya, the middle
Eocene). Our results raise the possibility that A. inferum
lineage was initially a member of the Mesozoic and the
early Cenozoic large vertebrate-fall communities, and
subsequently shifting to become a whale-fall specialist.

Nomamisaki, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, 229 m deep
(Fig. 1) during the Hyper-Dolphin/Natsushima cruise of
JAMSTEC (NT03-08 leg1). Comparative specimens of two
species of A. lucayanum complex were collected with the
aid of SCUBA from coral sand 10–20 m deep off the
northwest coast of Kuroshima Island, Yaeyama Islands,
Japan, and Castle Harbour in Bermuda [8]. These collected specimens were fixed and preserved in 99.5% ethanol. The whole body of a specimen from each species was
used to extract total DNA, which was performed using the
DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer's protocols.
PCR and Sequencing
The mitogenomes of the three Asymmetron species were
amplified in their entirety using a long PCR technique.

Four lancelet-versatile long-PCR primers [see Additional
File 1] were used to amplify the entire mitogenome in two
reactions. The long-PCR products were diluted with TE
buffer (1:19) for subsequent use as PCR templates. Fortythree lancelet-versatile, 39 fish-versatile, and 23 speciesspecific PCR primers [see Additional File 1] were used in
various combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping
segments of the entire mitogenome. Fifty species-specific
primers were designed in cases where no appropriate
lancelet-versatile primers were available for A. inferum.
Long PCR and subsequent nested PCR were performed as
previously described [16]. Double-stranded PCR products, purified using a Pre-Sequencing Kit (USB), were subsequently used for direct cycle sequencing with dyelabeled terminators (Applied Biosystems). Primers used
were the same as those for PCR. All sequencing reactions

were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled fragments were analyzed on a Model 3100
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Alignments
Four Asymmetron, an Epigonichthys, and three Branchiostoma species, including whole mitogenomes of known
species (Asymmetron sp. B, AB110092[16]; E. maldivensis,
AB110093[16]; B. floridae, AF098298[18]; B. lanceolatum,
AB194383 [38]; B. belcheri, AB083384 [Matsuzaki et al.,
unpublished data]) were phylogenetically analyzed,
based on surveyed mtDNA sequence data. An enteropneust Balanoglossus carnosus (AF051097[39]), a cyclostome Petromyzon marinus (U11880 [40]), and a smallspotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula (X16067[41]) were
chosen as outgroups. Urochordates were not included in
the present analysis because of peculiarity of their mitogenome sequences that was remarkably different from
those of other chordates, supposedly because of rapid
evolutionary rate in the mitogenome [42,43].

The DNA sequences for the 11 species were edited and
analyzed with EditView ver. 1.0.1, AutoAssembler ver. 2.1
(Applied Biosystems), and DNASIS ver. 3.2 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd.). Amino acids were used for
alignments of the protein-coding genes, and secondary
structure models were used for the alignment of tRNA
genes. Since strictly secondary-structure-based alignment
for the two rRNA genes was impractical for the large dataset, we employed machine alignment instead, which
would minimize erroneous assessment of the positional
homology of the rRNA molecules. The two rRNA gene
(rrnL and rrnS) sequences were initially aligned using
CLUSTAL X, ver. 1.81 [44]. Each primary aligned sequence
was realigned using ProAlign ver. 0.5 [45] and those
regions with posterior probabilities ≥70% used in the
phylogenetic analyses. These probabilities seemed to
effectively remove all ambiguously aligned regions.
Ambiguous alignment regions, such as the 5' and 3' ends
of several protein-coding genes and loop regions of several tRNA genes, were excluded, leaving a total of 12,497
available nucleotide positions (10,059, 1,275, and 1,163
positions for protein-coding, tRNA, and rRNA genes,
respectively) for phylogenetic analyses. Two datasets were
used in our analyses: dataset #1, concatenated nucleotide
sequences from 13 protein-coding, 22 tRNA, and two
rRNA genes (total position 12,497); dataset #2, concatenated amino acid sequences from 13 protein-coding
genes plus nucleotide sequences from 22 tRNA and two
rRNA genes (5,791).
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis for dataset #1 using
PAUP* 4.0b10 [46] was performed under a transversional
substitution model with gamma correction and invaria-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/127

ble-site assumption (TVM + I + Γ), which was chosen as
the most fit for the present case based on hierarchical likelihood tests by Modeltest 3.6 [47]. The base frequencies
were estimated to be A = 0.2940, C = 0.2233, G = 0.1598,
and T = 0.3230. The substitution rates were A-C = 0.9657,
A-G = 8.4537, A-T = 1.3911, C-G = 1.6808, C-T = 8.4537,
and G-T = 1.0000. Assumed proportion of invariable sites
was 0.1312. Gamma distribution shape parameter was
0.4086. Heuristic search option of PAUP* was chosen for
obtaining the ML tree. Robustness of each internal branch
of the ML tree estimated was evaluated with 100 bootstrap
replications [48].
Partitioned Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analysis
was performed with MrBayes version 3.1.2 [49,50]. Five
(dataset #1) and three (dataset #2) partitions were set
(1st, 2nd, 3rd codon positions, tRNA genes, and rRNA
genes; and amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding
genes, tRNA genes, and rRNA genes, respectively). The
general time reversible (GTR) model with gamma correction and invariable-site assumption was used in the analysis for dataset #1, and for tRNA and rRNA genes of
dataset #2. As mentioned above, TVM + I + Γ was chosen
as the best fitted for the present case. However, the TVM
model is a special case of the GTR model and is not yet
implemented in MrBayes. Therefore, the GTR model (GTR
+ I + Γ) was used in the analyses. The mtREV [20] model
with gamma correction and invariable-site assumption
(mtREV + I + Γ) was used in the analysis for the proteincoding genes of dataset #2. This model was selected as the
best-fit model of amino acid substitution by MrBayes.
Model parameter values were treated as unknown and
were estimated for each analysis. Random starting trees
were used, and analyses were run for one million generations, sampling every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior
probabilities were then calculated from the sample points
after the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
began to converge. To ensure that our analyses were not
trapped in local optima, four independent MCMC runs
were performed. Topologies and posterior clade probabilities from different runs were compared for congruence.
Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis for dataset #1 was
performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [46]. Heuristic MP analyses were conducted with TBR (tree bisection-reconnection) branch swapping and 100 random addition
sequences. All phylogenetically uninformative sites were
ignored. Robustness of each internal branch of the MP
tree estimated was evaluated with 1,000 bootstrap replications [48].
Divergence time estimation
The analyses of divergence time were conducted with the
penalized likelihood (PL) [22] and the nonparametric
rate smoothing (NPRS) [23] methods. Molecular clock

approaches were not used because a high rate of heterogeneity among lineages of lancelets was observed by the
two-cluster test (LINTREE [21]). The previous analyses
based on molecules were referred to the calibration points
for our dating because of the absence of a useful fossil
record in the lancelets. PL approach based on the BI tree
(dataset #2) was performed by r8s 1.71 [51]. All r8s analyses utilized the truncated Newton (TN) algorithm and
the additive rate penalty function. All analyses were reoptimized 1,000 times (set_num_restarts = 1,000) to avoid
entrapment on a local solution optimum. The optimal
smoothing parameter (121) was estimated using crossvalidation. The divergence times between Cephalochordata and Vertebrata (+ Urochordata) (891 Mya) and
between Agnatha (Cyclostome) and Gnathostomes
(Chondrichthys) (652 Mya) [1] were used for the age of
two calibration points. NPRS approach based on the ML
tree was performed by TreeEdit 1.0 [52]. As a reference
point for dating, the divergence time between Asymmetron
and the other genera (162 Mya) was used for the age of
root node [16].
