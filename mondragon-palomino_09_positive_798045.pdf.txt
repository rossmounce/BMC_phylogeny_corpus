Abstract
Background: Positive selection is recognized as the prevalence of nonsynonymous over synonymous
substitutions in a gene. Models of the functional evolution of duplicated genes consider neofunctionalization as
key to the retention of paralogues. For instance, duplicate transcription factors are specifically retained in plant
and animal genomes and both positive selection and transcriptional divergence appear to have played a role in
their diversification. However, the relative impact of these two factors has not been systematically evaluated.
Class B MADS-box genes, comprising DEF-like and GLO-like genes, encode developmental transcription factors
essential for establishment of perianth and male organ identity in the flowers of angiosperms. Here, we contrast
the role of positive selection and the known divergence in expression patterns of genes encoding class B-like
MADS-box transcription factors from monocots, with emphasis on the family Orchidaceae and the order Poales.
Although in the monocots these two groups are highly diverse and have a strongly canalized floral morphology,
there is no information on the role of positive selection in the evolution of their distinctive flower morphologies.
Published research shows that in Poales, class B-like genes are expressed in stamens and in lodicules, the perianth
organs whose identity might also be specified by class B-like genes, like the identity of the inner tepals of their lilylike relatives. In orchids, however, the number and pattern of expression of class B-like genes have greatly
diverged.
Results: The DEF-like genes from Orchidaceae form four well-supported, ancient clades of orthologues. In
contrast, orchid GLO-like genes form a single clade of ancient orthologues and recent paralogues. DEF-like genes
from orchid clade 2 (OMADS3-like genes) are under less stringent purifying selection than the other orchid DEFlike and GLO-like genes. In comparison with orchids, purifying selection was less stringent in DEF-like and GLOlike genes from Poales. Most importantly, positive selection took place before the major organ reduction and
losses in the floral axis that eventually yielded the zygomorphic grass floret.
Conclusion: In DEF-like genes of Poales, positive selection on the region mediating interactions with other
proteins or DNA could have triggered the evolution of the regulatory mechanisms behind the development of
grass-specific reproductive structures. Orchidaceae show a different trend, where gene duplication and
transcriptional divergence appear to have played a major role in the canalization and modularization of perianth
development.

Background
One important goal of contemporary biology is to understand how changes in developmental processes generate
evolutionary novelties at the morphological level. The
growing field of evolutionary developmental biology
('evo-devo'), approaches this question by determining
how changes in the number, sequence and expression of
developmental regulatory genes bring about formation of
new structures. In plants and animals, these developmental regulatory factors have expanded during evolution
(e.g. by gene and genome duplication) to form large and
diverse gene families linked by complex genetic and physical interactions [1-3].
Mutations in transcriptional regulators of development
often do not significantly affect the complete organism
because their function is generally confined to a single category of organs or modules [4]. Thus, it has been hypothesized that developmental transcription factors are more
likely to evolve new functions and so coordinate the
development of viable morphological novelty [4]. The
importance of duplication and diversification of genes
encoding transcription factors (e.g. Hox genes) is substantiated by genomic analyses showing that these kinds of
genes are specifically retained in plant [5] and animal
genomes [6,7]. Additionally, these genes show diverging
patterns of expression, unequal rates of substitution and
positive selection [6-11].
Positive selection is also involved in the diversification of
several groups of plant developmental transcription factors [12-17]. Recent research has focused on those
encoded by members of the MIKC-type MADS-box gene
family because of their key role in the development and
evolutionary diversification of the angiosperm flower [1822]. Thus, characterizing their patterns of molecular evolution is essential to understanding their function and the
mechanisms of morphological evolution. Because different functional classes of MADS-box genes form distinct
clades [23-25], their phylogeny is an important aid to
identify and test hypotheses explaining the different selective regimes that are generally considered to drive their
evolution.
The plant-specific proteins encoded by MIKC-type MADSbox genes have an unique and highly-conserved domain
structure that includes MADS- (M-), intervening (I-), keratin-like (K-) and C-terminal (C-) domains [26]. The
MADS-domain is mostly involved in DNA-binding and,
together with the I-domain, mediates the formation of
dimers. The K-domain plays an important role in protein
– protein interaction during both dimerization and the
formation of multimeric complexes. The C-terminal
domain is the most variable region. In some cases it is
involved in transcription activation, but it may also be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/81

involved in multimeric complex formation (reviewed in
[26]).
The ABCDE model of flower development (reviewed in
[26]), describes the genetic interactions of the five major
classes of floral homeotic selector genes termed class A, B,
C, D and E genes, almost all of which are MIKC-type
genes. Each of these gene classes determines the identity
of different floral organs: Class A and E genes specify
sepals; class A, B and E genes determine petals; the combination of class B, C and E genes specifies stamens (male
reproductive organs); class C and E genes determine carpels (female reproductive organs); and class D genes
determine ovules.
Of special interest to our study are class B MADS-box
genes encoding transcription factors, key to the specification of petal and stamen identity [27-32]. A gene duplication event that preceded the origin of extant angiosperms
gave rise to DEF- and GLO-like genes, the two major lineages of class B genes in angiosperms [33-35]. The regulatory role of class B genes in some model plants such as
Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus involves obligatory heterodimerization of proteins from the DEF and
GLO lineages [27,29,36]. Moreover, these heterodimers
form higher order complexes with other classes of MADSdomain proteins [37-39].
Recent analyses of the molecular evolution of class B-like
MADS-box genes in angiosperms detected positive selection after two key duplication events that generated first
DEF- and GLO-like genes and later euAP3-type and TM6type genes, which are the major sublineages of DEF-like
genes [22]. The analysis of Hernández-Hernández et al.
showed that during evolution, positive selection probably
modified the central property of protein complex formation because most of the selected sites belong to the Kdomain mediating protein – protein interactions in the
complexes of MADS-domain transcription factors [22].
Thus, the evolutionary emergence and divergence of DEFand GLO-like genes after duplication enabled the formation of obligate heterodimeric complexes involved in the
determination of floral organ identity, while the evolution of the class B gene lineages of euAP3-type and TM6type genes may be associated with the morphological
canalization of the core eudicot flower [22,40].
Flowers of many monocots are actinomorphic, with two
trimerous whorls of highly similar petaloid organs called
tepals. In contrast, at least three kinds of organ identity
exist in the zygomorphic orchid perianth: in the first floral
whorl there are three outer tepals (T1–T3; often also
termed 'sepals'). In the second whorl there are two lateral
inner tepals (t1, t2; 'petals') and a median inner tepal (t3)
called lip or labellum [41,42]. The orchid family is

divided into five monophyletic subfamilies that successively diverged from each other: Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae,
Cypripedioideae,
Orchidoideae
and
Epidendroideae [43,44]. In each subfamily the three types
of perianth organs have specific features, though the lip
typically adopts the widest range of morphologies. In
Apostasia, one of two genera of the Apostasioideae, the lip
resembles the other tepals [45], while in flowers of Cypripedioideae the lip is "deeply pouched and inflated" [46].
In contrast, the reproductive organs of the typical grass
floret are surrounded (from inner to outer) by two lodicules, palea and lemma following a zygomorphic organization. One or more florets are surrounded by two
glumes, thus constituting a spikelet, the characteristic
reproductive unit of grass inflorescences [47,48]. Class B
gene expression and corresponding homeotic transformations in mutant plants suggest that the lodicules are probably homologous with eudicot petals, even though
lodicules are small, often glandular-looking organs that
appear very different from typical petals [49,50]. The
homologies of palea, lemma and glumes to organs of
other angiosperms, such as sepals or prophylls remain
controversial [51].
Many monocot species have several copies of DEF- and
GLO-like genes which are expressed differently from their
orthologues first characterized in Antirrhinum majus and
Arabidopsis thaliana [35,52]. For example, the development of petaloid tepals in the outer whorl of Tulipa gesneriana and other petaloid monocots is probably
determined by the heterotopic expression of DEF- and
GLO-like genes [53-56]. Although this research suggests
there are alternative ways in which class B proteins regulate the genes encoding them and are associated with
novel morphologies, it is still far from clear how MADSbox gene duplication and transcriptional divergence is
associated with developmental flexibility and the evolutionary diversification of floral morphology. An opportunity to address this question comes from recent studies in
putative class B genes from Orchidaceae (orchids; order
Asparagales), which indicate that the high degree of perianth diversity of this family might be associated to duplication of MADS-box genes [57-61]. Specifically, studies
on the orchid species Habenaria radiata, Dendrobium crumenatum, Phalaenopsis equestris and the hybrid Oncidium
"Gower Ramsey", have indicated that the petaloid character of the outer tepals of orchid flowers is due to heterotopic expression of class B genes HrDEF, DcOAP3A,
PeMADS2 and PeMADS5, and OMADS3, respectively
[57,58,60,61]. In particular, the analyses of Phalaenopsis
equestris and Dendrobium crumenatum indicated that the
specific combination of duplicate gene expression in each
whorl is associated with development of three distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/81

groups of organs: the outer and inner lateral tepals and the
exceptionally diverse orchid lip [58,60].
Recently, we linked these distinct patterns of expression
and organ identity determination with preliminary data
on the molecular phylogeny of orchid DEF-like genes
[42,62]. We argued, that the orchid perianth evolved from
a lily-like ancestor as a result of duplication of DEF-like
genes and subsequent regulatory changes that brought
about differential expression of the paralogues. Our
model predicts that the extant diversity of the orchid perianth results from changes in expression of some of these
four DEF-like genes, or from changes in the downstream
targets of the proteins that they encode [42]. These two
scenarios are not mutually exclusive and the pattern of
selection on these genes could help to distinguish
between them. We hypothesize that the occurrence of distinct patterns of molecular evolution in each clade of
orchid DEF-like genes may substantiate the hypothesis
that each of them is associated to distinct protein- or
DNA-binding capabilities.
The DEF- and GLO-like genes from the order Poales provide a useful point of comparison for testing this hypothesis because they are essential for specification of stamens
and the grass-specific lodicules [49,50] and are expressed
in homologous whorls of the grasses and their closest relatives. This indicates that the morphological differentiation of grasses from tepaloid monocots is possibly the
result of changes in the downstream targets of class B transcription factors [63].
With nearly 25,000 and 20,000 species each, Orchidaceae
and Poales, respectively constitute two thirds of all monocot species and include some of the most frequently studied groups of plants [47,64]. Molecular phylogenetic
analysis have consistently shown that the Orchidaceae is
the sister group to all other Asparagales [65-67]. Likewise,
Asparagales is the sister group of the Commelinids, a wellsupported large clade comprising Arecales (palms), Commelinales (spiderworts), Zingiberales (gingers) and
Poales (grasses, sedges and bromeliads). Together, Asparagales and Commelinids occupy a somewhat derived
place in the phylogeny of the monocots (Inset, Figure 1).
These two groups plus Liliales (lilies), are sister to a clade
formed by Pandanales (screwpines) and Dioscoreales
(yams). The most basally divergent groups of the monocots are Acorales, Alismatales and Petrosaviaceae, which
successively diverged from each other from the group
comprised by Asparagales, Commelinids, Liliales, Pandanales and Dioscoreales [65,66].
Here, we present an in-depth phylogenetic analysis of
putative class B DEF- and GLO-like genes from the mono-

cots. In this study, we substantially widen the sample of
DEF- and GLO-like genes, incorporating new sequences
from four out of five orchid subfamilies: Vanilloideae,
Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae, as
well as Hypoxis, a member of the Asparagales frequently
employed as outgroup in phylogenetic analyses of the
Orchidaceae. The molecular phylogenies that we generate
are essential for testing hypothesis on the selective
regimes that affected class B-like MADS-box genes during
the evolution of the orchid perianth. We compare the
molecular evolution and expansion of DEF- and GLO-like
genes in the Orchidaceae and order Poales to understand
the processes of duplication and natural selection behind
the genes associated with the development of the perianths and stamens of the two largest groups of the monocots.

Results
Ancient and conserved paralogy in DEF-like genes, but not
in GLO-like genes from orchids
We isolated three to four different cDNA sequences of
DEF-like genes from each of the orchid species Vanilla
planifolia (Vanilloideae), Phragmipedium longifolium
(Cypripedioideae), Spiranthes odorata (Orchidoideae) and
Gongora galeata (Epidendroideae), whereas in Hypoxis villosa (Hypoxidaceae), we found only two different
sequences. In contrast, in almost all the orchid species
analyzed only a single GLO-like sequence was identified,
with the exception of Habenaria radiata, where two GLOlike genes have been isolated [61]. In Hypoxis villosa two
different sequences were found (Table S1 in Additional
file 1).

The molecular phylogeny of all monocot DEF-like
sequences in GenBank (Figure 1) shows strong support
for the existence of four orchid-specific clades of orthologous genes that we designate according to the first
reported sequence in the literature [57,58]: PeMADS2-like
genes (clade 1), OMADS3-like genes (clade 2), PeMADS3like genes (clade 3) and PeMADS4-like genes (clade 4).
The phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that clades 1
and 2, as well as clade 3 and 4, are sister clades (Figure 1).
The topology of each clade reproduces the phylogeny of
the Orchidaceae, indicating that the genes within these
clades are orthologues (different genes that originated in
speciation events) [42]. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the sequences in each of the four orchid DEFlike clades have features specific to each clade and suggest
that, following gene duplication, they might have
acquired different functions. In particular, the C-domain
of the corresponding proteins is a region possibly
involved in protein – protein interactions in multimeric
complexes [68]. This region experienced a remarkable
level of clade-specific diversification (Additional file 2),
whereas in the M-, I- and K-domains most of the substitu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/81

tions involve amino acids of similar chemical properties.
In the positions encoding the MIK-region, nucleotide
identity ranges from 68 to 92%, but as expected, it drops
to a range between 46 to 90% in the region encoding the
C-terminal domain of sequences in clades 1, 3 and 4. This
reduced identity is particularly pronounced in clade 2,
where it ranges from 28 to 57% as a result of a large
number of substitutions (e.g. PeMADS5 and SpodoDEF2)
or early stop codons (e.g. OMADS3 and GogalDEF2) that
eliminated the positions encoding for the otherwise
highly conserved C-terminal 'PI-derived' and 'paleoAP3'
motifs (Additional file 2). Finally, the monophyletic status of the individual clades of DEF-like genes in
Orchidaceae (Asparagales) and in the orders Liliales,
Poales and Commelinales is supported with posterior
probabilities of at least 99% (nodes indicated with
arrows, Figure 1). However, the phylogenetic relationships between these clades are undefined by these data.
In contrast with the ancient clades of orchid DEF-like
genes, all GLO-like sequences of orchids form a single
clade supported with PP = 1.0 (Figure 2). Only HrGLO1
together with OrcPI and HrGLO2 with SpodoGLO1, representatives of the subfamily Orchidoideae, form two distinct and equally well-supported subclades (PP = 1.00),
one of which appears more closely related to GLO-like
genes from the subfamily Epidendroideae, whereas the
other is closer to the single sequence found in Phragmipedium longifolium (Cypripedioideae) (Figure 2). It remains
to be seen whether this duplication is specific to the subfamily Orchidoideae or took place after the divergence of
the Cypripedioideae and Vanilloideae, as suggested by
our analysis. Despite this apparent subfamily-specific
duplication and divergence, the sequences of orchid GLOlike genes are between 65 to 94% identical at the nucleotide level in the MIK-region and between 75 to 92% in
the C-terminal domain, where there are neither large deletions nor early stop codons (Additional file 3). As with, to
the clades of orchid DEF-like genes, GLO-like sequences
also reproduce the phylogenetic relationship of the species from which they were isolated.
Each region of the alignments is distinctly variable and
thus has different proportions of phylogenetic informative positions. For example, this is reflected in the higher
support levels and phylogenetic resolution in the tree
obtained with the MIK-region of DEF-like genes (Figure
1), compared with the one estimated only with the C-terminal domain or with both regions together (Additional
files 4 and 5). This indicates that different domains of
these transcription factors are subject to different selective
regimes. In contrast, the high degree of conservation in all
regions of the GLO-like genes is reflected on the relatively
similar phylogenetic reconstruction obtained with com-

Phylogeny of monocot GLO-like genes based on an alignment of the cDNA encoding all domains. The figure
shows the Bayesian inference phylogeny with all GLO-like sequences where the complete coding sequence is available and the
new ones reported here. The bars indicate the single clade formed by sequences from the Orchidaceae and of Clades 1 and 2
formed by the rest of the Asparagales, Poales Zingiberales, Liliales, Arecales, Alismatales and the outgroup. The number on
every node corresponds to the Bayesian posterior probabilites (PP). Black arrows emphasize nodes that are discussed in the

plete sequences (Figure 2), or individual regions (Additional files 6 and 7).

GLO-like genes from Poales did not reject the null hypothesis of constant rates of substitution.

The apparent lack of family-wide duplications in the
GLO-like genes within Orchidaceae contrasts with the two
well-supported (PP = 0.92 and 1.0, respectively) clades
formed by the other Asparagales sequences (Figure 2).
According to their species composition, we estimate that
these two clades A1 and A2 at least go back to the origin
of the Hypoxidaceae and are present in the relatively
advanced family Asparagaceae (Figure 2). Most importantly, clade A1 is clearly associated with the corresponding clade of the family Orchidaceae (PP = 0.89).

Purifying selection affected orchid DEF- and GLO-like
genes differently
The analysis of variation of ω along codon sites showed
that both DEF- and GLO-like genes fit a scenario where
positive selection is absent (M7, where ω < 1) (Table S2 in
Additional file 1). This result is supported by the estimation of ω in DEF-like genes with the FEL method from
HyPhy. In this analysis, 156 of 249 codons (63%) in the
alignment of DEF-like genes are under purifying selection
with a P ≥ 0.95, whereas the rest of the codons are under
neutral evolution (data not shown). However, the tests we
applied are conservative and cannot detect positive selection when it affected only a small proportion of sites in a
few branches of the phylogeny. For this reason, we implemented a series of tests that focus on specific branches of
the phylogenies of DEF- and GLO-like genes (See "Methods" and Table 1).

The grasses belong to an order (Poales) that also shows a
well-supported and group-specific internal duplication of
their corresponding GLO-like genes [63,69]. Furthermore,
the clades corresponding to the Liliales, Zingiberales, Arecales and Alismatales are also monophyletic (supported
with PPs ≥ 0.91) and contain species-specific gene duplications (Figure 2).
DEF-like genes in clades 1 and 2 of Orchidaceae evolve
under different rates of substitution
For every pair of sequences tested, the Maximum Likelihood-based (Relative Rate Test) RRT in HyPhy employs a
(Likelihood Ratio Test) LRT to evaluate whether the data
fit the null hypothesis of a molecular clock where the
branch lengths of a phylogeny are equal or an alternative
hypothesis where branch lengths are different.

After adjusting all the results of the RRTs for multiple
comparisons, we found that 128 of 231 pairs of orchid
DEF-like genes rejected the null hypothesis of a constant
rate of substitution (P ≤ 0.027). In order to compare the
rate differences between the pairs of DEF-like sequences
that rejected the null hypothesis, we grouped them
according to the clade where they belong (Figure 1) and
estimated the median of the relative rates of synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitution of these groups (Additional file 8). In the case of nonsynonymous substitutions, the most significant comparisons involve species
from orchid Clades 1 and 2 with rate between 0.10 and
0.30 substitutions/nucleotide (Additional file 8A). This
means that the genes from clade 2 have a rate of nonsynonymous substitutions about three times higher than those of
sequences in clades 3 and 4 (Additional file 8A). On the
other hand, the relative rate of synonymous substitution
fluctuates independently of the clades compared (Additional file 8B).
In contrast, all 45 pairwise comparisons of orchid GLOlike genes failed to reject the null hypothesis (P ≥ 0.05)
and have a median rate of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution of 0.023 and 0.534 substitutions per
nucleotide, respectively. Similarly, the RRT with DEF- and

To determine whether the ω ratio varies substantially in
clades of DEF- and GLO-like genes from the order Poales
and the family Orchidaceae we compared the null
hypothesis (H0) of a "single ω ratio for all branches" (M0)
with several nested alternative hypotheses (H#) represented by M2, where one or more clades of interest are free
to adopt different values estimated from the data (Figure
3).
In the case of DEF-like genes, we tested five hypotheses
where H0 assumes that ω adopted the same value along
all branches of the phylogeny. Using LRT we compared
this scenario with four relevant alternative hypothesis:
H1, where a specific ω is estimated for the branches of
clade 1 (C1); H2, where clade 2 (C2) has a different ω to
the rest of the branches; H3, where orchid clades C1, C2
and C3 have estimated ω values different to the rest of the
branches and H4, where the branches of each of the four
clades of the orchid DEF-like genes and the single clade of
Poales DEF-like genes (P1) have ω estimates significantly
different from the rest of the branches (Figure 3).
Hypotheses H0 and H3, which assume no significant differences between all or some of the groups of branches
tested, are significantly (≤ 0.0001) rejected in favor of H4,
where specific ω values were estimated for the different
groups of DEF-like genes from Orchidaceae and Poales
(Figure 3). Most importantly, in hypothesis H4 where ω is
estimated for each group of branches, these values converge and indicate that although all clades tested are
under strong purifying selection, the group of branches in
orchid clade C2 has an ω value of 0.1978, which is more
than twice those estimated for other groups of branches
(Figure 3).

Similarly, in the corresponding analysis of monocot GLOlike genes we tested a null hypothesis H0 where all clades
have the same estimated ω value and six alternative
hypotheses where this rate is estimated for one or more
relevant groups of branches. To determine whether gene
duplication is associated with a distinct pattern of evolution, we estimated ω on both the single clades of GLO-like
genes from orchids (C1) and Liliales (L1) as well as the
paralogous clades from Poales (P1, P2) and the remainder
of Asparagales (A1, A2) (Figure 4).
Comparisons of H0 vs H1 and H7 rejected the scenario
where ω is the same in all branches, thus favoring the
alternative hypotheses where the orchid clade has ω =
0.043 (P ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 4). Like the DEF-like
sequences, all clades of GLO-like genes are under strong
purifying selection, but this is especially pronounced in
the case of the single orchid clade (Figure 4).

We complemented the previous branch-based analysis
with two tests for detecting rate shifts in paralogous clades
[70]. Specifically, we tested paralogous clades of DEF-like
genes 1 and 2 as well as 3 and 4 and the GLO-like clades
P1 and P2 (Tables 2, 3 and 4). The tests showed that in
clades 1 and 2 there have been significant (P ≤ 0.0005)
shifts in the value of ω following gene duplication (Table
2). Both models MC and MD estimated that approximately 42% of the sites of both clade 1 and 2 have divergent ω values, (ω2 C1 = 0.21 and ω2 C2 = 0.50, respectively),
and that these site classes are on a background of stronger
purifying selection (ω1 = 0.033 in 55% of the sites) and
neutral evolution (ω0 = 1.28 or ω1 = 1.0 in approximately
2% of the sites) (Table 2). These results are consistent with
those estimated by the previous analysis with M2, where
clade 1 is under more stringent purifying selection than
clade 2 (Figure 3). Also in agreement with the previous
analysis of M0 vs. M2, the analysis of DEF-like genes in

Figure hypotheses about the variation of ω along the phylogeny of DEF-like genes from the Orchidaceae
Test of 3
Test of hypotheses about the variation of ω along the phylogeny of DEF-like genes from the Orchidaceae. The
table summarizes the hypotheses tested and their maximum likelihood estimates of ω, which depending on the hypothesis, are
free to vary in specific clades (indicated on the phylogeny), while being uniform in the rest of the phylogeny. Column "L" indicates the likelihood value that corresponds to each hypothesis, and P the probability of each model rejecting its corresponding
null hypothesis in the series of LRTs indicated at the bottom of the table. The phylogeny employed in these tests is based on
the alignment of the complete coding sequences of DEF-like genes. However, to facilitate the inference of the parameters for
each model, the outgroup and sequences from clades not directly relevant to the analyses were removed from the alignment
and the phylogeny was re-estimated with an ad hoc model as described in Methods. The branches labeled with italics were
tested for positive selection with branch-site models A1 and A.

clades 3 and 4 showed that 75% of their sites are under
stronger purifying selection (ω2 C4 = 0.025 and ω2 C3 =
0.017) than genes in clades 1 and 2 (Table 3).
A similar set of branch-site tests used to study the divergence of the two clades of Poales GLO-like genes (Table 4)
showed that MC, the model where shifts in ω take place
after gene duplication, fits the data significantly better
than other hypotheses (P < 0.0001). This result confirms
that although P1 and P2 are under purifying selection
(ω0= 0.211) as previously shown with M0 vs M2, ω is
especially stringent when considering the clades individually (ω2P1 = 0.0148 and ω2P2 = 0.01608, respectively)
(Table 4).
Positive selection preceded diversification of DEF-like
genes in Poales
We estimated ω in the branches preceding the origin and
subsequent duplications of DEF- and GLO-like genes
from Orchidaceae and Poales by employing the branchsite models MA and MA1 (Figure 3, Table 5). As discussed
in "Methods", MA and MA1 assume that branches in a
phylogeny are divided in foreground and background
while their codon sites are sorted in classes 0, 1, 2a and 2b
according to their ω value (Table 1). In site classes 0 and

1, both foreground and background branches have 0 < ω0
< 1 or ω1 = 1, respectively. However, in the foreground
branches, MA assumes that site classes 2a and 2b have ω2
> 1 whereas in MA1 these site classes have ω2 = 1 (Table
1). Therefore, comparing MA with MA1 is a test of positive
selection on branches and sites.
The branch-site analysis showed positive selection on the
branch preceding the divergence of DEF-like genes in the
Poales (Table 5). In this branch, the corresponding Bayes
Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis, included in MA, detected
seven codon sites under positive selection (PP ≥ 0.90),
most of which are in the region encoding the K-domain
(Figure 5). The codon substitutions in these sites represent
both radical and preferential changes in the chemical
properties of the amino acids that they encode (Figure 5).
The positions under positive selection that we detected in
this lineage are different from those identified by Hernández-Hernández et al. (2007) [22] in other nodes of the
phylogeny of class B genes as well as from sites in AP3
from Arabidopsis thaliana that are critical for protein – protein interactions [71].
Furthermore, we tracked the occurrence of positive selection along the branches representing the divergence of

elephas and S. angusifolia (Table 5, Figure 3). Although in
these analyses the foreground branches have ω > 1 and
sites under positive selection were identified, the LRT does
not reject the null model MA1.
Similarly, we tested for positive selection in branches that
in Orchidaceae precede and follow the duplications of
DEF-like clades 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 3, Table S3 in Additional file 1). The LRTs of these analyses did not reject the
null hypothesis where over 95% of the codon sites are
under purifying selection (ω0 = 0.084).
Further analyses in different nodes of the evolution of
GLO-like genes in the Orchidaceae and Poales did not
reject the null hypothesis where most of the sites have ω0
= 0.112 (Figure 4 and Table S4 in Additional file 1).

Discussion
The phylogeny of MADS-box genes indicates that functional classes A, B, C+D and E of floral homeotic genes are
grouped in distinct clades [23-25], suggesting that duplication and functional diversification of MADS-box genes
contributed significantly to the evolution of the flower
structure [23,33,72,73]. Thus, studying the phylogeny of
MADS-box genes is a powerful tool to better understand

the evolution of plant morphology [23,33,73-75]. Here
we investigate the molecular evolution of putative class B
genes from monocots, with special emphasis on DEF- and
GLO-like genes from orchids and Poales. We have chosen
these genes because they most likely specify the identity of
both perianth organs and stamens throughout the
angiosperms, and they are thus essential for understanding important aspects of the morphological divergence of
the orchids and grasses from the rest of the monocots
[41,42,63,76,77]. Specifically, we determined whether
shifts in the rates and patterns of nucleotide substitution
of duplicated class B genes are correlated with their subsequent functional divergence and thus with the evolution
of novel perianth structures in orchids and grasses.
Ancient duplication of DEF-like genes possibly facilitated
the diversification of the orchid flower morphology
The phylogenetic analyses presented here strongly support the existence of four ancient, orchid-specific clades of
DEF-like genes. These four clades and their internal
branches are generally supported with PP values > 0.99.
Our data strongly suggest that the sequences within each
clade are orthologues, because they reproduce the systematic relationships reported for the four most derived subfamilies of the Orchidaceae: (Vanilloideae (Cypri pedio
ideae (Orchidoideae, Epidendroideae))) [44,78]. This

indicates that the clades are the result of ancient gene
duplication events that at least precede the origin of the
subfamily Vanilloideae, which according to recent estimates, emerged between 71 to 62 MYA [79]. The ancient
origin, conservation and unique expression (see below) of
these distinct groups of orchid-specific genes suggest that
they have key roles in determining the organ identities
behind the characteristic orchid floral morphology
[42,62]. Our data show that clades 1 and 2, as well as
clades 3 and 4, are sister to each other. Although clades 1
and 2 seem most closely related to some other DEF-like
genes in the Asparagales (Figure 1), the data available do
not allow unequivocal reconstruction of the deeper phylogenetic relationships between orchid paralogous groups
and the rest of the monocot sequences.
Exceptionally, we found that members of subfamily
Orchidaceae have two lineages of GLO-like genes (Figure
2). We argue that these two lineages may be the result of a
subfamily-specific duplication because exhaustive RACE
on several cDNA pools from species in subfamilies Vanilloideae (Vanilla planifolia), Cypripedioideae (Phragmipedium longifolium) and Epidendroideae (Gongora galeata)
yielded only a single GLO-like gene. The fact that GLO-like
genes from Cypripedioideae and Epidendroideae seem to
associate with different lineages of Orchidoideae (Figure

2), may be the result of differential gain and loss of duplicate genes during the evolution of these subfamilies.
The phylogeny of DEF-like genes provides the evolutionary context needed to interpret functional information on
these sequences and suggests a particular model of perianth organ determination and evolution [42,62]. Mapping the known expression patterns onto the phylogenies
of orchid DEF-like sequences shows that genes belonging
to the same clade have the same or very similar expression
domains [42]. These clade-specific expression patterns
suggest that the duplication events that gave rise to the
ancestors of these clades were followed by transcriptional
and functional differentiation of each paralogue.
Specifically, in addition to expression in the gynostemium, genes from both clades 1 and 2 are expressed in the
outer and inner tepals, whereas the expression of genes in
clades 3 and 4 is limited to the inner tepals or to the lip,
respectively [42]. Considering both the expression patterns of each clade and the events of gene duplication that
generated them, it seems likely that after the first gene
duplication, the ancestor of genes in clades 3 and 4 produced the differences between inner (expression "on")
and outer tepals (expression "off"). The resulting morphology might still exist in the basal genus Apostasia (sub-

family Apostasioideae) whose flowers do not yet possess
elaborate lips [45]. Similarly, the distinction between lateral inner tepals and the lip emerged after a second gene
duplication affecting the ancestor of clades 3 and 4, followed by changes in the cis-regulatory regions of the
duplicated genes that resulted in differential expression
and determination of lip identity by clade 4 genes [42].
Validating this scenario involves further characterization
of the patterns of expression of DEF- and GLO-like genes
in the basal and relatively species-poor families Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae and Cypripedioideae.
Although genes in clade 1 and 2 are expressed in all the
perianth organs, it is unlikely that they have a completely
redundant role in the determination of perianth organ
identity. According to our phylogenetic reconstruction,
these clades were already present in the Vanilloideae, an
orchid subfamily that emerged at least 62 million years
ago [79]. Retention of duplicate genes for such a long time
is alone a strong argument for functional diversification.
Furthermore, our analyses show that the members in
these clades have substantial differences in their C-terminal domains, distinct rates of nonsynonymous substitution and significant differences in their respective patterns
of purifying selection (Figures 1, 3, Tables 2, 3, Additional
file 2). Specifically, in the sequences of clade 2 DEF-like
genes, a relatively high proportion of non-synonymous
substitutions followed the duplication that generated this
clade and eventually caused the truncations in the open
reading frames that characterize the sequences analyzed
here. Despite the high level of divergence of clade 2 orchid
DEF-like genes, our detailed characterization of ω along
the phylogeny of all orchid class B genes did not indicate

specific branches or sites where positive selection took
place. Our estimation of ω along sites, branches and specific clades documents a scenario of prevalent purifying
selection (Figures 3, 4, Tables 2 to 4) that agrees with previous analyses of class B genes and other floral organ identity genes [13,14,22,80]. However, we cannot completely
rule out the occurrence of positive selection, since its
effects on few sites during a brief evolutionary period can
be masked by ensuing and continuous purifying selection
[81,82].
The uniform expression of GLO-like genes in the perianth
organs of orchids [59-61], indicates that although these
genes are probably essential for proper flower development, they may not play a role in determining the different organ identities in the orchid perianth [42]. However,
further work is needed to determine whether the subfamily Orchidoideae-specific gene duplication (Figure 2)
is associated with differential patterns of expression and
function and thus with the specific morphology of this
subfamily.
Similarly to DEF-like sequences, all clades of GLO-like
genes were under strong purifying selection, but this is
especially pronounced in the case of the single clade of
genes from orchids (Figure 4). We think the differences in
the ω ratio reflect the distinct selective constraints affecting duplicated class B genes. Specifically, the ratios corresponding to the generally monogenic clades of the
Orchidaceae (ω = 0.043) and Liliales (ω = 0.0907) are
lower than those of the rest of the Asparagales and the
Poales, where there are two GLO-like loci (ω = 0.1206 and
ω = 0.157, respectively). We reasoned that in orchids, and

to a lesser extent in GLO-like sequences from Liliales, the
lower rate of substitution reflects the stable co-evolutionary interaction between the product of a single GLO-like
gene with several DEF-like interaction partners. Also,
duplicated loci in clades A1 and A2 from the rest of the
Asparagales, as well as P1 and P2 from the Poales, may be
completely or partially redundant and thus under less
stringent purifying selection than their single-copy homologues in other species (Figure 4).
The fact that each of the clades of DEF- and GLO-like
sequences replicates the systematic relationships of the
four most advanced subfamilies of the Orchidaceae
[44,78] suggests that these sequences may be useful for
reconstructing the phylogeny of the Orchidaceae, provided the analysis exclusively involves orthologous
sequences.
Positive selection in DEF-like genes from Poales preceded
the evolution of the grass floret
The order Poales contains 18 families, of which three are
represented in our analyses of DEF-like genes: Restionaceae (Elegia elephas), Joinvilleaceae (Joinvillea ascendens) and Poaceae with the rest of the species (Streptochaeta
angustifolia, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, Zea mays). Recent phylogenetic analyses showed that
the early-diverging lineage of the Restionaceae is the sister
group of a clade containing Joinvilleaceae and the more
derived Poaceae; the latter comprising most of the species
of Poales [47,65]. Previous studies [63] sampled species
representing the morphological transition from the typical monocot flower to the grass floret. Specifically, the
flowers of the basal Elegia elephas and Joinvillea ascendens
are actinomorphic, possessing two trimerous whorls of
tepals and three or six stamens, respectively [63]. In contrast, the floret of the early-diverging grass Streptochaeta
angustifolia has 12 bracts. The trimerous arrangement of
the six bracts VII to XII have been interpreted as the first
and second perianth whorls [63]. Most importantly, the
expression of class B gene SaAP3 in the last three bracts
and in the six stamens suggests that these bracts are second whorl organs, possibly a transitional form preceding
the evolution of actual lodicules [63,83]. Moreover, the
study of Whipple et al (2007) suggests that class B genes
control the identity of second whorl organs in a broader
sense than only petal identity. The morphologies outlined
above contrast with the grass floret found in the rest of the
Poaceae species analyzed here. Specifically, the floret is
formed by one lemma and one palea subtending a flower
formed by two or three lodicules, and the male and
female reproductive organs. The grass floret is also a zygomorphic structure like the orchid flower, mostly due to
frequent differential suppression of stamens from different whorls [84,85] and suppression of the adaxial lodicule
in most derived grasses (e.g. Hordeum, Oryza) [48,84].

In this context, the evidence for positive selection in the
branch that represents the divergence of Poales DEF-like
genes from the rest of the monocot genes (Figure 3, Table
5) suggests that during the morphological divergence of
grasses a series of nonsynonymous substitutions took
place before the emergence of the characteristic grass floret. Positive selection probably continued along the
branches following the divergence from Elegia elephas and
Streptochaeta angustifolia (Table 5), but the corresponding
signal eventually became masked by positions under purifying selection that probably encode amino acids essential
for a grass-specific network of class B gene targets. The
facts that class B transcription factors SILKY1 (DEF-like)
and ZMM16 (GLO-like) from maize share conserved heterodimerization specificity with Arabidopsis thaliana class
B proteins APETALA3 and PISTILLATA in vitro and rescue
the corresponding null mutants makes it conceivable that
the residues mediating the interaction between these two
sets of class B proteins already existed in the most recent
common ancestor of monocots and eudicots [76]. This
not only suggests that the mechanisms of organ identity
determination for second whorl organs were established
early during the evolution of the angiosperms, but also
that the subsequent morphological divergence in the
grasses is probably associated with the lineage-specific
substitutions in the K-domain that we detected. Substitutions in this domain may have the potential for changing
higher order complex formation of class B proteins and
thus their binding specificity to downstream target genes,
eventually enabling them to coordinate the development
of novel perianth structures.
Methods for detecting positive natural selection, like the
ones we employed here, are powerful tools to generate
and experimentally verify interesting hypothesis on the
evolution of new gene functions and phenotypes.
Recently, molecular adaptation of polygalacturonase
inhibitor protein, TRIM5α, feruloyl esterase A and salicylic acid methyltransferase has been tested on proteins
encoded by genes where nucleotides under positive selection were modified via site-directed mutagenesis or by
domain-swapping experiments generating genes encoding chimeric proteins [86-89]. In the future, similar
approaches could be employed to assess the functional
consequences of positive selection in DEF-like transcription factors from Poales. For example, hypothesis on the
transcriptional activity of these proteins could be evaluated by substituting sites under positive selection with the
ones found in present-day orchids or the ones inferred to
have existed in their common ancestor. The interactions
of chimeric or mutagenized DEF-like proteins from Poales
with other MADS-domain transcription factors and DNA
could be assayed in vitro via yeast-two-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays [90], respectively, or in

planta employing Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer
(FRET) [91].
Functional consequences of C-terminal deletions in clade 2
DEF-like proteins of orchids
Previous phylogenetic analyses of the DEF- and GLO-like
proteins identified specific motifs characteristic for certain
plant lineages [33,35]. Similarly to what we observed in
the different lineages of orchid DEF-like genes, most of
these characteristic motifs evolved in the C-terminal
domain of the encoded proteins. This domain is highly
variable and in class B proteins it might be involved in the
formation of multimeric transcription factor complexes
[39,92]. The evolutionary importance of these differences
in the C-terminal domain is supported by their long evolutionary conservation (Additional file 2). In particular,
the family specific C-terminal deletions observed in orchid
DEF-like proteins from clade 2 are exceptional if one considers that in all published DEF-like proteins, C-terminal
deletions are only species specific (M. Mondragón-Palomino, unpublished results). The importance of these
orchid-specific deletions is highlighted by recent findings
on the occurrence of frameshift mutations in the regions
encoding C-terminal motifs of the members of the clades
of DEF- and GLO-like genes [93,94]. For example, the
study by Kramer et al[94] indicates that the C-terminal
motif 'euAP3' resulted from a translational frameshift
caused by a single nucleotide deletion in the ancestral
motif 'paleoAP3'. Because the paleoAP3 motif is found in
DEF-like proteins throughout the angiosperms (e.g. in
TM6-like proteins of eudicots), whereas the euAP3 motif
is found only in DEF-like proteins of higher eudicots,
Lamb and Irish [95], suggested that there is a causal relationship between duplication of DEF-like genes, mutations in the C-domain, functional differentiation of DEFlike genes and the emergence of specific floral morphologies. Although the previous evidence argues for the functional importance of the C-terminal deletions in the
orchid clade 2 proteins, there is surprisingly little experimental evidence for a function of the C-terminal domain,
not only in orchids but also in other species. Specifically,
recent independent studies with truncated DEF-like proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Chloranthus spicatus
suggest that the C-terminal domain is not essential for floral identity [96,97]. Interestingly, yeast-two hybrid experiments involving OMADS3 from orchid Oncidium "Gower
Ramsey", a clade 2 protein lacking the conserved C-terminal motifs PI-derived and paleoAP3 (Additional file 2),
showed that this protein forms homodimers [57], opening up the possibility of novel regulatory functions for the
proteins of clade 2. However, results derived from experiments using DEF-like proteins with truncated C-terminal
domains of other monocots do not lend support to a particular role of this domain in dimerization [68,90].

Conclusion
Our results strongly support the existence of four distinct
paralogous clades of orchid DEF-like genes that originated
at least 62 MYA via three gene duplications. It appears
likely that the gene duplication that gave rise to the ancestors of clades 1 and 2 on the one hand and clades 3 and 4
on the other hand occurred simultaneously, due to a
whole genome duplication (WGD) (Figure 6). In contrast,
all orchid GLO-like genes form a single, highly conserved
clade where subfamily-specific gene duplicates may only
have been retained in Orchidoideae. Our analyses show
that the four clades of orchid DEF-like genes are significantly distinct in their level of sequence divergence,
strength of purifying selection and clade-specific sequence
motifs. These differences, together with the clade-specific
patterns of gene expression [42,57,58,60-62], suggest that
after duplication, changes in the promoter and coding
region resulted in sub- and neofunctionalization of the
paralogous DEF-like genes. We argue that the orchid DEFlike genes acquired new functions in the specification of
at least three different orchid-specific perianth organ identities by changes in expression patterns and target gene
recognition. According to the 'orchid code' [42,62], in
addition to the expression of a GLO-like gene and possibly
also AP1- and/or SEP-like genes, the combined expression
of clade 1 and clade 2 genes in the first floral whorl determines the formation of outer tepals. In the second whorl,
the identity of lateral inner tepals is determined by the
combined action of clade 1, clade 2 and clade 3 genes. The
identity of the lip is determined by the organ-specific
expression of a clade 4 gene in addition to the expression
of all the other DEF-like genes [42]. The neofunctionalization of the four orchid DEF-like genes, implicit in the
'orchid code' may have been a crucial event in the morphological diversification of the orchid flower (Figure 6).
It could have 'modularized' the orchid perianth, by enabling an individual response of every type of organ to natural selection and thus independent evolution [62].
Contrary to the case in lilies and tulips, where perianth
development is very likely under control of one set of floral homeotic genes, including DEF-like and GLO-like
genes [54], the different perianth organs of the orchids are
controlled by different sets of genes, therefore mutational
changes can easily be restricted to one or two types of
organ by mutations in the genes that specify their identity
during development. For example, mutational changes
can be easily restricted to the inner tepals and lip by mutations in a clade 3 gene, or to the lip by mutations in a
clade 4 gene. This may provide a proximate explanation
for why the lip is the most diverse organ. A similar scenario is not likely in petaloid monocots with identical
tepals, because changes in the mechanisms determining
organ identity of one tepal are very likely accompanied by
the same (pleiotropic) changes in the rest of the perianth

Trends 6
Trends in the molecular evolution of DEF- and GLO-like genes from Orchidaceae and Poales. In this schematic
phylogeny the major morphological and evolutionary features of the two lineages of class B genes from Orchidaceae and Poales
are summarized: (a) Three gene duplications resulted in four DEF-like genes in the Orchidaceae. The points where these events
happened are labeled 1 to 3 without assuming any specific order for duplication events 2 and 3. This includes the reasonable
possibility that duplications 2 and 3 occurred simultaneously (e.g. by partial or complete genome duplication). We propose that
duplication of DEF-like genes is associated to the emergence of new perianth organ identities. Specifically, from an ancestor
with an actinomorphic perianth evolved after the first round of DEF-like gene duplication an intermediate morphology where
inner and outer tepals were different. Following a final round of duplication and functional divergence of clade 4 genes the lip
or labellum organ identity emerged and made the perianth zygomorphic. The arrow indicates a 180° rotation of the pedicel and
or ovary (resupination) that in most orchids sets the lip, the developmentally uppermost tepal, in a lowermost portion of the
perianth. (b) Purifying selection prevails in DEF- and GLO-like genes (ω << 1), but is less stringent in Orchidaceae DEF-like genes
from clade 2 (ω < 1); (c) Some proteins encoded by DEF-like genes from clade 2 miss part of the C-terminal domain; (d) Positive selection (ω>1) took place at the base of the Poales DEF-like genes. Most of the positions involved are in the K-domain.
Positive selection was also detected, although not statistically significant, on the lineage linking DEF-like genes from Restionaceae with the rest of the Poales. The highly reduced and zygomorphic perianth or grasses evolved from a common ancestor with the "typical" monocot perianth morphology. Here represented by black half-moons are the inner perianth organs of
Streptochaeta angustifolia (Anomochlooideae) and Oryza sativa (Pooideae) to illustrate the morphological transition that was
preceded by the process of positive selection here documented. In this diagram the palea is in gray and the outer perianth
whorl is absent.

due to their common genetic control of development
[62].
The 'orchid code' suggests that the diversification of the
orchid perianth started with changes in the regulatory
regions of the duplicated class B genes, which were soon
followed by changes that led to the recognition of different target genes [42]. The conserved clade-specific motifs
that characterize each clade may be the result of diversifying selection taking place early and transiently during the
divergence of the ancestral paralogues, but possibly after
some changes that affected the domains of expression had
already occurred. Subsequently, purifying selection may
have been stabilizing the network of protein – protein and
protein – DNA interactions involving four DEF-like proteins.
Our analyses suggest that diversification of the K-domain
in DEF-like genes of Poales may have triggered the initial
changes in transcription factor interactions that coordinate the development of the lodicules (Figure 6). Our
comparative analysis of class B genes in the Orchidaceae
and Poales, as well as published information on their pattern of expression, suggests that in these species-rich
groups positive selection and transcriptional divergence
have had different influences on the evolution of morphological diversification. In a wider context, the presented results suggest the preservation and functional
diversification of paralogous genes involves case-specific
differential divergence of coding and regulatory sequences
(Figure 6).

Methods
Plant material
Pre-anthesis flower buds of Hypoxis villosa (Hypoxidaceae)
and orchids Vanilla planifolia (Vanilloideae),Phragmipedium longifolium (Cypripedioideae), Spiranthes odorata
(Orchidoideae) and Gongora galeata (Epidendroideae)
were collected from the living collections of the Halle
(Halle an der Saale), Wilhelma (Stuttgart) and Heidelberg
Botanical Gardens. They were preserved and transported
in liquid nitrogen or RNAlater (Sigma) and stored at 80°C. The choice of the orchid species was based on their
subfamily membership, the availability of blooming individuals and the number of plants present in living collections. In this study, we did not include material from the
subfamily Apostasioideae because there were no specimens available in the living orchid collections outside of
their natural range of distribution in Southeast Asia. We
included H. villosa because this species and the rest of the
family Hypoxidaceae (Asparagales) show important similarities to the orchids [98,99] and members of the Hypoxidaceae are frequently used as point of comparison in
recent molecular phylogenies of the orchids.

Sequence isolation
Bud material was used for total RNA isolation with Biomol's reagent, following the protocol of the manufacturer.
Total RNA was employed for cDNA synthesis by using a
poly-T primer with Fermentas MuLV Reverse Transcriptase. MADS-box gene specific sequences were isolated by 3' RACE from at least two different cDNA pools
from each species with primer pair RQVT2 (5'-CGR CAR
GTG ACS TTC TSC AAR CG-3') and AB07 (5'-GAC TCG
AGT CGA CAT CTG-3') under conditions specified by the
manufacturer for Taq polymerase (Fermentas). PCR products of about 700 bp were cloned into vectors pGEMT
(Promega) or pJET1 (Fermentas) following the protocols
of the manufacturers. The ligation products where electroporated into E. coli XL1 Blue, and 50 to 100 positive
clones from each ligation were selected and sequenced in
both directions multiple times with vector-specific primers on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer using Big Dye Terminator chemistry. The resulting sequences were assembled
and managed with the program SEQUENCHER (4.5,
Gene Codes Corporation). The level of identity and phylogenetic association of these sequences with previously
identified monocot DEF- and GLO-like sequences was
determined with different strategies using BLAST [100] to
all plant sequences in GenBank. The sequences that where
unequivocally identified as those of DEF- or GLO-like
transcripts were employed to generate specific primers to
isolate the 5' end of the sequence with the 5'-RACE kit
(Roche). Assembly of the 5' and 3' partial sequences
allowed us to design specific primers to isolate the corresponding full-length sequences.
Sequence alignment
We assembled two datasets by retrieving with BLAST and
keyword searches all monocot DEF- or GLO-like nucleotide and amino acid sequences deposited in NCBI's GenBank until September 20th 2007 (Table S1 in Additional
file 1). The amino acid sequences were aligned using the
program T-coffee [101,102] to the corresponding DEFand GLO-like conceptual amino acid translations of the
cDNA sequences that we isolated from orchids. In these
alignments we included as outgroup representatives the
following sequences from basal angiosperms: KjAP3 (Kadsura japonica),AP3-1 (Illicium floridanum),IhAP3-1 (Illicium
henryi),BsAP3 (Brasenia schreberi),NjAP3-3 (Nuphar
japonica),EfAP3 (Euryale ferox),NymAP3 (Nymphaea sp.),
NtAP3_1 (Nymphaea tetragona),AP3-1 (Nuphar variegata)
and AmAP3 (Amborella trichopoda) for the phylogeny of
DEF-like sequences. Similarly, for the phylogeny of GLOlike genes we employed the sequences of KjPI (Kadsura
japonica), PI (Illicium floridanum), IhPI-1 (Illicium henryi),
BsPI (Brasenia schreberi), CcPI (Cabomba caroliniana), NtPI
(Nuphar tetragona), EfPI (Euryale ferox), NjPI-1, NjPI-2
(Nuphar japonica) and AtPI (Amborella trichopoda). In an

initial step, the alignments were assessed with GBLOCKS
[103] and T-coffee. Subsequently, after manual improvement using GenDoc [104], we used amino-acid sequence
alignments as a template to align the corresponding
nucleotide sequences. The nucleotide alignment of DEFlike genes contained 61 sequences and was 762 bp long,
whereas the GLO-like matrix contained 74 sequences and
was 696 bp long.
Phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis
We analyzed the alignments of DEF- and GLO-like
sequences on their complete length or separated in the
positions encoding the MIK region and the C-terminal
domain, as defined in [71]. The program MODELTEST
(3.7) [105] was employed to determine which model of
nucleotide substitution fits better to each alignment
according to the corrected Akaike Information Criterion
[106]. The parameters of the best model were employed
to reconstruct the phylogenies of DEF- and GLO-like
genes with Mr. Bayes (3.1.2) [107]. We performed preliminary runs of Bayesian Inference to determine the point
where the Likelihood estimates resulting from each generation converges on a single value. Based on this, we performed all analyses of Bayesian inference for 2,000,000
generations, sampling every 100th and with a burn-in of
3,000 generations. Finally, we obtained a consensus tree
with the rest of the results and used the posterior probabilities (PP) to estimate the statistical support for each
node.
Determining the substitution saturation of the dataset
We determined the level of substitution saturation of
DEF- and GLO-like sequences by plotting their genetic distance versus the number of transitions and transversions.
Because the number of transitions relative to that of transversions decreases with increasing divergence, the point of
substitution saturation corresponds with the distance
value where the plots diverge from linearity and reach a
plateau [108]. The pairwise genetic distances of both DEFand GLO-like genes were obtained in PAUP 4 beta 10
(Swofford 2002) using the nucleotide substitution model
GTR+I+G which best fitted the data as estimated by analysis with MODELTEST (see previous section). The pairwise number of transitions and transversions
corresponding to each dataset was obtained using DAMBE
4.5.56 [108] and the plots were drawn with MicroSoft
Excel.
Relative Rate Test
We employed the Maximum Likelihood (ML) pairwise
Relative Rate Test (RRT) as implemented in the program
HyPhy (v. 1.0) [109] to estimate the relative rate of substitution between the orchid and Poales DEF- and GLO-like
sequences and their corresponding outgroup sequence
TGDEFA and TGGLO from Tulipa gesneriana (Liliaceae),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/81

respectively. We chose these as representatives of the outgroup because the phylogenetic analysis presented in this
paper showed that their relationship to the sequences
from the rest of the monocots is well supported and their
level of nucleotide substitution is not saturated.
The Maximum Likelihood-based RRT in HyPhy employs a
Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to evaluate whether the
sequence data fits the null hypothesis of a molecular clock
(equal rates) represented by a tree of three taxa where all
parameters are constrained to be equal along its branches,
or an alternative hypothesis where such parameters are
free to adopt different values. In order to infer the parameters of these phylogenetic hypotheses for each pair of
sequences, we used the Muse-Gaut model [110] of codon
substitution with nucleotide equilibrium frequencies
based on their position in the codon (in Hyphy nomenclature MG94W9). The resulting parameter estimates were
compared through series of Likelihood Ratio Tests that
involved all pairs of sequences in relation to the corresponding outgroups. There is no simple procedure to
reduce the effect of multiple comparisons in this series of
P-values because the RRTs share the same outgroup and
thus are not independent. Alternatively, the developers of
HyPhy recommend adjusting the P-values of the LRTs for
False Discovery Rate by implementing the BenjaminiHochberg procedure (S. Kosakovsky-Pond, Hyphy on-line
discussion forum). The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is the
proportion of false positive results among all significant
results. With the Benjamini-Hochberg correction we
enforced a FDR = 0.05 by ranking all n P-values from
smallest to largest, then dividing them by n and multiplying the result by 0.05 [111]. The LRT comparisons that
rejected the null hypothesis of neutrality are those where
the original P-value was smaller than the corrected value.
For consistency with analyses described in the following
section, the RRT analysis excludes sequences from basal
angiosperms and all positions with indels.
Analysis of evolutionary patterns of divergence
The ratio (ω) of the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions
at nonsynonymous sites (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions at synonymous sites was estimated to figure out
whether the coding region of a gene is under negative
(purifying) selection (ω < 1), positive selection (ω > 1) or
evolves neutrally (ω = 1). Variations of ω along the evolutionary history of a gene family indicate changes in both
the associated selective regime and functional constraints.
Because different selective regimes might affect only some
branches or sites during relatively short evolutionary time
[6], we analyzed the heterogeneity of selective pressures in
DEF- and GLO-like genes with the program codeml from
the PAML package [112,113], by comparing five pairs of
models (abbreviated M) that describe the pattern of

Page 21 of 26

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:81

codon substitution at the levels of: (a) codon sites (M7 vs
M8), (b) specific branches in a phylogeny (M0 vs M2) and
(c) sites from specific clades (M1a vs MC and M3 vs MD)
or (d) sites from specific branches (MA and MA1). Table
1 summarizes the main features and parameters of each
model of codon substitution and the datasets analyzed
with them. Each of these models serves to estimate ω and
other parameters. Comparing the likelihood of these estimates via a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) determines
whether a model that considers positive selection fits the
data better than one assuming neutral or purifying selection. A detailed description of each test is provided elsewhere [70,112,114].
We investigated the occurrence of positive selection along
codon sites by comparing the model M8 with model M7
[112]. Then, we characterized the variation in selection
pressure among branches of DEF- and GLO-like genes
with a series of tests comparing the null hypothesis M0
"one ω ratio for all branches", with different alternative
hypothesis based on M2 "different ω ratios", where independent ω values are estimated for specific branches [115]
(Table 1).
We implemented clade and site tests of models M1a vs
MC and M3 vs MD, to determine whether functional constraints differ significantly between clades after gene
duplication in the two paralogous groups of DEF-like
genes in Orchidaceae (Clades 1 and 2) or (Clades 3 and 4)
(Figure 1), or the duplicate GLO-like genes from Poales
(Figure 2). Clade models MC and MD assume that there
were variations in the selective pressures among the
amino acids encoded by a gene and that some of these
sites also experienced changes in selective regimes at different points of their evolutionary history, such as changes
occurring after gene duplication [70] (Table 1).
With branch-site models A and A1 [116], we tested for the
occurrence of positive selection on individual codons
along specific branch groups of DEF- and GLO-like genes
from the orchids and Poales. Model A assumes that the
branches in the phylogeny are divided a priori in foreground and background clades, where only the former
may have experienced positive selection (Table 1). In the
null model MA1 ω2 = 1, thus comparing model MA with
MA1 is a direct test of positive selection on the foreground
clades.
The relative fit of the parameters estimated by each of
these models of codon substitution is represented by a
maximum likelihood value that can be compared
between nested hypotheses by a Likelihood Ratio Test
(LRT). The LRT statistics are assumed to be χ2 distributed
with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the
number of parameters between models. The application
of these models requires a phylogenetic assumption, but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/81

since the process of ML inference with program codeml is
computationally intensive, for most of the tests we
employed unrooted trees inferred as previously described
from a smaller dataset. This dataset does not include
sequences of basal angiosperms and sequences with large
sections of indels (gaps) because we did not want to consider them as additional character states. The alignment of
DEF-like genes is 747 bp long and contains 41 sequences,
while the alignment of GLO-like genes is 666 bp long and
has 61 sequences. The tests involving clade-sites models
required the use of three alignments that only included
members of clades 1 and 2, 3 and 4 from the Orchidaceae
DEF-like genes or sequences from clades 1 and 2 of the
Poales, respectively (Table 1). The phylogenies corresponding to these alignments were constructed as
described previously.
To detect variations in parameter estimation, we performed and compared the analyses of each model at least
twice. As with the RRTs with HyPhy, all analyses with
codeml were conducted without considering positions
with indels. In addition to the tests performed with PAML,
we carried out an independent estimation of ω in DEF-like
genes with the on-line implementation of the Hyphy
package http://www.datamonkey.org. Specifically, we
employed the FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) method to
estimate the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitution across codons with the same alignment and
phylogeny previously used to test M0 with PAML.
