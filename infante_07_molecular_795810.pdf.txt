Abstract
Background: Keratins make up the largest subgroup of intermediate filaments, and, in chordates,
represent the most abundant proteins in epithelial cells. They have been associated with a wide
range of functions in the cell, but little information is still available about their expression profile
and regulation during flatfish metamorphosis. Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is a commercially
important flatfish in which no keratin gene has been described yet.
Results: The development of large-scale genomics of Senegalese sole has facilitated the
identification of two different type I keratin genes referred to as sseKer1 and sseKer2. Main
characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and mammal keratins are described.
Phylogenetic analyses grouped sseKer1 and sseKer2 in a significant clade with other teleost
epidermal type I keratins, and have allowed for the identification of sseKer2 as a novel keratin. The
expression profile of both genes was studied during larval development and in tissues using a realtime approach. sseKer1 and sseKer2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in skin than in other
tissues examined. During metamorphosis, sseKer1 transcripts increased significantly at first stages,
and reduced thereafter. In contrast, sseKer2 mRNA levels did not change during early
metamorphosis although a significant drop at metamorphosis climax and late metamorphosis was
also detected. To study the possible regulation of sseKer gene expressions by thyroid hormones
(THs), larvae were exposed to the goitrogen thiourea (TU). TU-treated larvae exhibited higher
sseKer1 and sseKer2 mRNA levels than untreated control at both 11 and 15 days after treatment.
Moreover, addition of exogenous T4 hormone to TU-treated larvae restored or even reduced the
steady-state levels with respect to the untreated control, demonstrating that expression of both
genes is negatively regulated by THs.
Conclusion: We have identified two keratin genes, referred to as sseKer1 and sseKer2, in
Senegalese sole. Phylogenetic analyses revealed sseKer2 as a novel keratin. Although they exhibit
different expression patterns during larval development, both of them are negatively regulated by
THs. The co-regulation by THs could explain the reduction of both keratin transcripts after the
metamorphosis climax, suggesting their role in the tissue remodelling processes that occur during
metamorphosis.

Background
In animal cells, the cytoskeleton is composed of three filament classes: actin microfilaments (6 nm diameter),
microtubules (20 nm diameter), and intermediate filaments (IFs) so denoted for their size (8–12 nm diameter)[1,2]. The integrated network formed by all these
filaments, in conjunction with associated proteins, is
responsible for the mechanical integrity of the cell. In contrast to the evolutionarily conserved actin and tubulin
proteins, IFs are highly divergent and exhibit cell typespecific expression patterns (reviewed in [3]). In human, up
to 70 different IFs have been identified and grouped in
five subfamilies, termed type I to V, with type I and type II
including keratins [3,4].
Keratins are the major structural proteins in epithelial
cells, and are encoded by a large multigene family that
accounts for about 75% of all IF genes in chordates [5].
They act as a scaffold allowing for the maintenance of cellular architecture, and providing resistance to mechanical
and non-mechanical stresses; although, other nonstructural functions such as cell signalling, protein targeting in
polarized epithelia, cell proliferation, and in apoptosis
have also been reported [5-11]. According to the biochemical properties of the encoded polypeptides, keratins
are classified into two different types: type I and type II
[1,9]. Type I keratins are acidic (pI = 4–6), and their
molecular masses range from 40 to 64 kDa, whereas type
II keratins are neutral to basic (pI = 6–8) and tend to be
larger (52 to 68 kDa). Nevertheless, this designation of
type I keratins as acidic or type II as basic is not supported
in fish (see for example [12-14]). Unlike other IF proteins,
keratins form obligatory heteropolymeric filaments consisting of equal numbers of type I and type II keratins
[1,15]. All keratins share a common tripartite structure
that includes a central highly α-helical "rod" domain,
which features heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues,
flanked by a "head" and a "tail" domain [1,9,16]. The
heptad repeat pattern of the rod domain is a signature of
a coiled-coil fold [17], which leads to an elongated architecture formed by a parallel coiled-coil dimer. Nevertheless, the heptad periodicity within the rod domain is
interrupted in several places, resulting in four consecutive
segments (or coils) of different size but identical number
of amino acids (aa) among keratins (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B),
separated by three spacers or "linkers" (L1, L12, and L2)
of highly variable length and primary structure [1,9,16].
According to their expression in epidermal keratinocytes
as well as other stratified epithelia and simple epithelia,
keratins are subdivided into two distinct types: "E" (from
epidermal) and "S" (from simple epithelia) [18]. In teleosts, "S" keratins are also expressed in many mesenchymal
cells, probably helping to resist osmotic stress [18]. In
human, the classical "S" keratin 8 and keratin 18 [19]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/118

have true orthologs in tetrapods and teleosts. In contrast,
teleost "E" keratins as well as other "S" keratins lack direct
orthologs in other vertebrate classes, suggesting an independent evolution in bony fish [20-23]. This observation
is also supported by sequence comparison and chromosomal distribution analyses of vertebrate keratin genes,
which uncover a scattered distribution and an excess of
type I keratins in teleosts in contrast to the two clusters
and almost the same proportion of type I and type II keratin genes found in mammalian genomes [24-27].
Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis (Pleuronectiformes:
Soleidae), is a commercially important flatfish. During
larval development, this species undergoes metamorphosis from 12 to 19 days after hatching (DAH). The process
involves jaw and head restructuring, eye migration from
the left to the right side, and a change from a symmetrical
to an asymmetrical body shape [28]. These drastic morphological changes have been shown to be regulated by
thyroid hormones (THs) in flatfish [29,30]. Currently, the
regulation of keratin genes by THs has been demonstrated
in other metamorphosing organisms such as Xenopus laevis and Rana catesbeiana [31-35]. In flatfish, only in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) a keratin gene
(hhKer1) has been recently characterized. This gene was
shown to be down-regulated at the climax of metamorphosis, when T4 hormone reached the highest levels [36].
Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that dependence of
keratin genes expression on THs during metamorphosis
remains to be demonstrated in flatfish.
The development of large-scale genomics of Senegalese
sole has allowed for the availability of a high number of
EST sequences. In this study, we have identified and characterized two type I keratin genes (referred to as sseKer1
and sseKer2). The main sequence features are described.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out to identify putative
orthologous sequences. Gene expression profiles during
larval development and in tissues from juvenile soles were
explored using real-time PCR. Additionally, thiourea (TU)
and T4 treatments were carried out in order to elucidate
the dependence of both sseKer gene expressions on THs.

Results
Molecular characterization and phylogeny of Senegalese
sole keratins
Two sseKer genes were identified after EST analysis of a
normalized cDNA library constructed from different larval stages (pre-, meta-, and post-metamorphosis), undifferentiated gonads, and six adult tissues (testis, ovary,
stomach, intestine, liver, and brain). A total of 8 and 3
clones were identified as sseKer1 and sseKer2, respectively.
Sequences of both sseKer loci were confirmed by direct
sequencing of PCR products amplified from a pre-metamorphic library using all the possible combinations of

keratin-specific primers (Table 1) with universal primers
T3 and T7 (although modified by elongation of their 5'end with 6 nucleotides using the pBK-CMV sequence as
template). The PCR conditions were the same as used in
real-time assays. This strategy also allowed us to rule out
amplification of additional Senegalese sole keratin genes.
sseKer1 encoded a transcript of 1441 nucleotides (nt)
[DDBJ:AB301423] that contained a short 5'-untranslated
region (42 nt) followed by an open reading frame (ORF)
of 409 codons. The 3'-untranslated region was 172 nt long
and included a canonical polyadenylation signal
(AATAAA, 1422–1427) and a short oligo-A tail. For
sseKer2, a cDNA sequence of 1299 nt was identified
[DDBJ:AB301424]. The ORF comprised 404 codons, and
it was preceded by a 14-nt 5'-untranslated region. The 73nt long 3'-untranslated region contained a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at positions 1276–1281, and as
sseKer1, included a short oligo-A tail.
The translated aa sequences of sseKer1 and sseKer2 showed
that they consisted of 408 and 403 residues of molecular
mass 44,188 and 44,332 Da, respectively. The predicted pI
of sseKer1 and sseKer2 proteins was 4.91 and 5.11, respectively.
A computational analysis of sseKer1 and sseKer2 using
tBLASTx revealed that the best matches corresponded to
teleost type I keratins in both cases. Both sseKer1 and
sseKer2 contained a head domain (87 and 70 aa, respectively) rich in glycine and serine, and a short tail domain
(16 and 28 aa, respectively). Features of IFs present in
both sseKer1 and sseKer2 included a central rod domain
with the coil 1A (35 residues: 88–122 in sseKer1, 71–105
in sseKer2), coil 1B (101 residues: 134–234 in sseKer1,
117–217 in sseKer2), coil 2A (19 residues: 251–269 in
sseKer1, 234–252 in sseKer2), and coil 2B (115 residues:
278–392 in sseKer1, 261–375 in sseKer2), separated by
the linker regions L1 (11 residues), L12 (16 residues) and
L2 (8 residues), and the evolutionarily conserved IF signature motif IAEYRRLLD (Figure 1). In addition, five charac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/118

teristic motifs of type I keratins were identified both in
sseKer1 and sseKer2, two in each of coil 1B and 2B, and a
fifth one spanning between L12 and coil 2A (Figure 1).
Finally, a leucine-zipper motif L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L was
identified in coil 1B domain of both sseKer1 and sseKer2
at positions 193–214 and 176–197, respectively (Figure
1).
Sequence identities between sseKer1 and sseKer2, and
with respect to type I keratins from other vertebrates (see
Table 2), are depicted in Table 3. Identity between both
Senegalese sole keratins was 54.1 (entire protein) and
63.6% (rod domain), respectively. With respect to other
species, sseKer1 overall identities ranged between 36.5–
73.8% and 42.3–81.6% for the entire protein and central
rod domain, respectively. For sseKer2, amino acid identities varied between 39.0–67.5% and 45.7–77.0%, respectively. In all pairwise comparisons, sseKer1 and hhKer1
exhibited the highest identity values.
Maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ)
phylogenetic trees were constructed from a multiple aa
sequence alignment of the central rod domains corresponding to sseKer1, sseKer2, as well as a range of type I
keratins (see Table 2). Largely congruent topological trees
were generated using both methods (Figures 2 and 3). In
agreement with previous reports, keratin 14 sequences
only found in ancient ray-finned fish such as sturgeon
(Acipenser baeri), bichir (Polypterus senegalus) and gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), appeared forming a separate and highly
consistent clade (100% of bootstrap support) close to
sequences of river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) used as an
outgroup [37]. Similarly, a consistent clustering of gnathostomian keratin 18 sequences was also observed both in
ML and NJ trees. With regard to Senegalese sole keratins,
they grouped together with other teleost epidermal keratins in a highly consistent clade (98 and 75% of bootstrap
value in ML and NJ trees, respectively). Nevertheless,
sseKer1 and sseKer2 clustered into different subclades.
The former appeared closely related to hhKer1 in a highly
supported branch (100% of bootstrap support both in ML

Expression levels of sseKer genes in tissues
Steady-state levels of both Senegalese sole keratin transcripts were quantitated in head-kidney, liver, testis, brain,
heart, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen, intestine, stomach,
and gills from juvenile soles (Figure 4). Relative gene
expression levels were normalized by measuring 18S
rRNA and expressed relative to head-kidney. Both keratin
genes exhibited a quite similar expression profile in tissues. sseKer1 transcripts were highly abundant in skin (17,
53, and 80-fold higher than gills, brain and intestine,
respectively, and >200-fold higher than the remaining tissues; P < 0.001 in all cases). Likewise, sseKer2 was abundantly expressed in skin. However, this keratin gene also
exhibited significantly higher mRNA levels in gills than in
the remaining tissues (P < 0.001).
Expression levels and regulation during larval development
Expression patterns of both Senegalese sole keratin genes
during larval development (from 2 to 22 DAH) were also
determined. Data were normalized to the housekeeping

relative to 2 DAH. Both sseKer1 and sseKer2 transcripts
were detected very early at 2 DAH (Figure 5). Nevertheless, they displayed different expression profiles during
development. sseKer1 transcripts increased continuously
reaching a peak at 13 DAH (54-fold, P < 0,001; S1 metamorphic stage). Thereafter, mRNA levels dropped progressively. In contrast, sseKer2 transcripts increased
significantly at 3 DAH, coinciding with the external feeding (3.6-fold; P < 0.001). After that, expression levels did
not vary significantly until the end of the metamorphic
process, when a significant drop (P < 0.05) was detected
(at 19 and 22 DAH).
To investigate the involvement of THs on the expression
of both keratin genes, 7 DAH larvae were exposed to the
goitrogen TU. As a consequence of the TU treatment, the
metamorphic process was blocked at S1–S2 stages (early
metamorphosis) as determined by the degree of eye

mRNA levels for both sseKer genes were quantified in
whole larvae pools collected 8 h, and 6, 11, and 15 days

profiles similar to those described above (Figure 6). TUtreated larvae showed 7 and 5-fold higher sseKer1 mRNA
levels (P < 0.05) than controls at both 11 and 15 dat,
respectively. In contrast, no significant differences in gene
expression were found at 6 dat (13 DAH larvae), suggesting that the rise of sseKer1 transcripts during metamorphosis (see Figure 5) is independent on THs. With regard
to sseKer2, highly significant transcript levels were
detected as a consequence of the TU treatment in larvae

to ensure the lack of endogenously synthethized T4 at day
7, when the exogenous T4 was supplied. mRNA levels of
both sseKer genes were determined in larvae sampled 8
and 13 days after T4 treatment (datt). It is important to
indicate that T4 released the metamorphosis blocking
induced by TU. The expression patterns of untreated and
TU-treated larvae were similar to those described above
(Figures 5 and 6). In contrast, sseKer1 and sseKer2 steadystate transcript levels in TU+T4-treated larvae were similar

We have obtained the complete cDNA sequence of two
distinct Senegalese sole keratin genes, referred to as
sseKer1 and sseKer2. Amino acid sequence analyses
revealed that the subdomain organization was basically
identical to that of mammalian and fish keratins in the
central rod domain, detecting the four consecutive coils
1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B [3,9,12,21,39]. Moreover, both
sseKer1 and sseKer2 presented the IF signature motif at
the end of coil 2B, a feature that is common to all IFs, and
possessed a predicted molecular mass and pI within the
expected value for vertebrate type I keratins
[1,19,21,23,33,34,39-41]. A leucine-zipper motif conserved among type I keratins from zebrafish, goldfish
(Carassius auratus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),
X. laevis, and human was also identified at the end of coil
1B in both keratins [12]. All these results, and the identification of the five characteristic motifs that provide a signature for type I keratins, indicate that both sseKer genes
actually encode for functional type I keratins.
Phylogenetic analyses give further support to the classification of sseKer1 and sseKer2 as "E" type I keratins. In fact,
expression analysis of sseKer genes in tissues showed that
the highest transcript levels were observed in skin. Both
proteins were grouped together with other "E" type I
keratins from teleosts [21,36] in highly consistent clades
both in ML and NJ trees. At the sight of the phylogenetic
trees, such a group of keratins does not seem to have a
tetrapod counterpart. This result is not surprising if we
take into account previous results showing that type I
keratins from teleosts have diversified independently
from those of tetrapods [4,21,25-27,37].
With the exception of keratin 18 gene, next to the type II
keratin 8 gene, teleost type I genes are spread over many
different positions in the genome. This may be the result
of whole genome duplication and subsequent massive
gene loss occurred in teleost fish lineage after its divergence from terrestrial vertebrates [42-44]. The high
sequence identity and the close phylogenetic relatedness
between sseKer1 and hhKer1 indicate that both genes
could be considered as orthologous genes. However, this
hypothesis is not supported by gene expression data.
Whereas hhKer1 has an abundant expression in pre-metamorphic larvae [36], sseKer1 reaches the highest expression levels during metamorphosis (S1–S2 stages). In
addition, hhKer1 is undetectable in adult skin [36]; in contrast, sseKer1 is abundantly expressed in skin from juvenile
soles. So, if hhKer1 and sseKer1 are real (or not) orthologous genes, it is still a problem that is unresolved. With
regard to sseKer2, no evident counterparts were found
both in ML and NJ phylogenetic trees either in tetrapods
or in teleosts, and thus sseKer2 can be considered as a
novel type I keratin. sseKer2 could be the result of a type I

gene duplication event and further retention in the Senegalese sole. Indeed, several examples of keratin duplications have been described in zebrafish, spotted green
pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) and tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes) [25]. We consider that orthologous genes
for sseKer2 can be present in other teleosts, or, at least, in
flatfish. Nevertheless, more available molecular data will
be necessary to shed light on this issue.

nificantly lower levels than those detected in controls.
These results demonstrate that THs down-regulate sseKer1
and sseKer2 expression. The co-regulation of both keratins
by THs, in spite of their distinct expression profiles during
development, could explain the reduction of both keratin
transcripts after the metamorphosis climax, suggesting
their role in the tissue remodelling processes that occur
during metamorphosis.

Senegalese sole sseKer1 and sseKer2 showed quite different
expression patterns during larval development. Whereas
sseKer1 reached the highest transcript levels at S1–S2
metamorphic stages, sseKer2 was mostly expressed at initial developmental stages. However, both genes reduced
their transcripts levels late in metamorphosis. Different
expression profiles for epidermal keratin genes during
metamorphic processes have also been described in
anuran organisms. For example, a X. laevis 51 kDa keratin
coding gene was expressed in skin at an almost constant
level during metamorphosis, while three 64 kDa keratin
coding genes were up-regulated at a later larval developmental stage and further expressed highly in the adult skin
[31,45]. Two other genes, XK70 and XK81, were expressed
in the epidermis from embryos to larvae [46,47]. Moreover, type II xlk was expressed exclusively in the larval skin,
and type I xak-a, xak-b, and xak-c genes in adult skin
[34,35]. Finally, xlk2, another type I keratin gene, was
exclusively expressed in the larval period from hatching to
late metamorphic stages [41]. In developmental studies of
Rana catesbeiana tadpoles, three epidermally expressed
keratins have been further characterized: rlk and rk8 (type
II), and rak (type I). During metamorphosis, no change in
rk8 mRNA levels was detected whereas rlk and rak were
down- and up-regulated, respectively [33,48]. Interestingly, the expression of many of these genes is differentially regulated by THs. Thus, 63 kDa keratin genes, xak-a,
xak-b, xak-c, as well as rak are up-regulated by THs [31-35].
In contrast, xlk and rlk are negatively regulated [33-35].

In fish, the absence of keratinization in adult skin seems
to be a common phenomenon. Immunocytochemical
and RT-PCR techniques have been unable to detect epidermal keratins typical of keratinizated tissues in the adult
skin of several teleosts, including C. auratus and H. hippoglossus [36,53]. Thus, it has been proposed that scales
and mucus present in adult skin of teleosts accomplish the
same function as epidermal keratins and keratinizated
skin in tetrapods, constituting a barrier against mechanical stress, parasites, pathogens, and loss of body fluids
[36,54]. In fact, the presence of cystine bridges in the skin
of adult Senegalese sole specimens has been related to the
glycoprotein nature of the mucous secretion and not to a
process of keratinization of the outer most layer of the epidermis [55]. Nevertheless, it is striking that among all tissues examined, both sseKer1 and sseKer2 exhibited the
highest mRNA levels in skin. Thus, the possibility of both
Senegalese sole keratin proteins playing a role in resistance to mechanical or osmotic stresses cannot be ruled
out. This hypothesis is also supported by the abundance
of the two sseKer transcripts in gills (mainly sseKer2),
another mucus secreting tissue involved in osmotic regulation. Additionally, attractive hypotheses about other
possible functions of sseKer1 and sseKer2 can be considered. For example, there are evidences supporting a role
for keratin proteins in skin pigmentation both in human
and mouse [8]. In the Senegalese sole, skin darkness has
been observed in animals under stressing conditions [56].
As melanin granules have been found physically associated with IFs in skin pigment cells of fish [57], and there
are accumulating reports of interactions of keratins (and
other IFs) with microtubule-dependent motors [58], a
putative role for Senegalese sole keratins in regulating the
transport of melanin pigments is at least challenging. An
alternative and exciting hypothesis for the possible
involvement of sseKer1 or sseKer2 in skin pigmentation
can be related to apoptotic processes. In this sense, there
are findings that point to keratins as proteins involved in
the regulation and execution of apoptosis [5], and such
apoptotic processes seem to play a role in the change of
body colour in fish by modifying the morphology and
density of the skin pigment cells [59]. Moreover, it would
be worthwhile to study the possible role of Senegalese
sole keratins as regulators of protein synthesis and epithelial cell growth through interactions with components of

THs play a key role in flatfish metamorphosis. The start of
the metamorphic process has been associated with a surge
of THs that increase their levels until the metamorphic climax, and reduce towards post-climax [29,30]. In this survey, the possible regulation of sseKer1 and sseKer2 by THs
was studied using TU and combined TU+T4 treatments.
TU is a blocking agent of THs synthesis that can reduce T4
levels by about 95% [49]. Exogenous treatments with TU
as well as other types of thyroid inhibitors have proved
useful to study the involvement of THs on metamorphosis in flatfish [29,49,50] and the transcriptional regulation
of genes involved in the pituitary-thyroid axis [51,52]. TUtreated larvae exhibited significantly higher sseKer1 and
sseKer2 transcript levels than controls at late metamorphosis. In contrast, addition of T4 reduced the amount of
both sseKer1 and sseKer2 transcripts to similar or even sig-

the translational apparatus, as described for other keratins
[8].

Conclusion
In conclusion, in this study we describe the sequence and
main features of the cDNAs encoding two type I keratins
in the Senegalese sole, sseKer1 and sseKer2. Phylogenetic
analyses revealed sseKer2 as a novel type I keratin. Both
genes were highly expressed in skin and secondarily in
gills. In contrast, they exhibited distinct expression patterns during larval development, with sseKer1 reaching the
highest transcript levels during the first metamorphic
stages and sseKer2 at first feeding. TU+T4 treatments demonstrated that sseKer1 and sseKer2 were negatively regulated by THs, suggesting their role in tissue remodelling
that occurs during metamorphosis in flatfish. However,
the specific function of each keratin during larval development and metamorphosis, as well as their regulation and
interactions with other genes, are issues that need to be
clarified in the future for the improvement of Senegalese
sole aquaculture conditions.

Methods
Source of fish and experimental rearing conditions
All experimental sole larvae were obtained from fertilized
eggs collected from breeding tanks, where breeders
spawned naturally under environment conditions. Eggs
were incubated at a density of 2000 eggs L-1 in 300 L cylinder conical tanks with gentle aeration and a water
exchange every two hours. Temperature and salinity during all experiments were 20°C and 38 ppt, respectively.
Newly hatched larvae were transferred to a 400 L tank at
an initial density from 45 to 50 larvae L-1 with a 16L:8D
photoperiod and a light intensity of 600–800 lux. Larvae
were fed rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) 3 DAH until 9 DAH.
From 7 DAH enriched artemia metanauplii were fed until
the end of the experiment. Pools of larvae from 2 to 22
DAH (n = 3) were collected, washed with DEPC water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until analysis.
Metamorphic stages (S0–S4) were classified according to
[28]. These stages are as follows: S0 (pre-metamorphic),
symmetric larvae with vertical swimming plane; S1, the
left eye starts to migrate towards the dorsal position, until
it touches the midline of the dorsal surface; S2, the migrating eye can be seen from the right-ocular side up to reaching the midline of the dorsal surface; S3 (metamorphic
climax), the individuals change their swimming plane
and the eye continues migrating within the ocular side;
S4, eye translocation is completed and the orbital arch is
clearly visible.

Chronic exposure to 30 ppm (394 μM) TU was achieved
in 200 L round tanks. TU was added on 7 DAH, and water
was kept stagnant for 24 h. After this exposure, 20% water
was exchanged daily, with the subsequent addition of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/118

eliminated TU. A second tank with the same characteristics was used to rear untreated control sole larvae. Larvae
were initially stocked at a density of 100 individual L-1,
and lights were kept off until the onset of external feeding
3 DAH. Fluorescent lamps supplied an illumination of
800 lux on the water surface, while a 16L:8D light cycle
was used. Larvae were fed rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis)
and 48 h Artemia metanauplii, according to the experimental design. The Haptophyceae Isochrysis galbana (TISO strain) was employed for the enrichment of both live
preys, and was also added (2 mg dry weight L-1 d-1) to larval tanks during rotifer use. Daily larval samples were
removed for metamorphosis control. Pools of larvae (n =
3) were also collected, washed with DEPC water, frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until analysis.
For the rescue experiments, culture conditions were the
same as described above, but 30 ppm TU was added 4
DAH to ensure lack of endogenously synthethized T4 at
the commencement of exogenous T4 treatment. At 7
DAH, untreated control larvae were transferred to a pair of
16 L cylinder conical tubes at an initital density of 45 larvae L-1. TU-treated larvae were transferred to 4 tubes, two
of which were supplemented with 100 ppb (0.112 μM)
T4. After this new exposure, 20% water was exchanged
every two days, with the subsequent addition of the eliminated TU and TU+T4. Pools of larvae (n = 3) were collected 8 and 13 days after the commencement of T4
treatment, washed with DEPC water, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until analysis.
Juvenile Senegalese sole individuals (average weight =
169.60 ± 24.3 g; n = 3) were obtained from IFAPA Centro
El Toruño facilities (El Puerto Santa María, Cádiz, Spain).
They were sacrificed by immersion in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) according to the guidelines on the care
and use of fish in research, teaching and testing from the
Canadian Council on Animal Care (2005). Head-kidney,
liver, testis, brain, heart, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen,
intestine, stomach, and gills were rapidly dissected, frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until use.
Identification of keratin cDNAs in Senegalese sole
Ten cDNA libraries were constructed from different larval
stages and adult tissues of Senegalese sole using the ZAP
Express® cDNA Syntesis kit and Zap Express cDNA Gigapack® III Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene) following the
manufacturer's protocol. The libraries were pooled and
normalized, and approximately 11,000 randomly
selected clones were sequenced from the 3'-end (Cerdà et
al., in preparation). Expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
encoding keratins were identified after EST annotation.
Sequences have been deposited with accession numbers
[DDBJ:AB301423] and [DDBJ:AB301424] for sseKer1 and
sseKer2, respectively.

Alignments of the predicted polypeptide sequences were
carried out, and the sequence identities calculated by MegAlign program from the LASERGENE software suite. For
this purpose, a range of type I keratin protein sequences
were retrieved from databases (Table 2). ML and NJ phylogenetic analyses were carried out from a multiple amino
acid sequence alignment of the rod domains corresponding to sseKer1, sseKer2 as well as a total of 76 additonal
type I keratins (Table 2). The bestfit model of sequence
evolution was determined to be JTT+I+G (-lnL =
21,898.95) using the ProtTest v1.3 [60], with a gamma
distribution shape parameter (four rate categories) of
1.633, and a proportion of invariable sites of 0.081. These
settings were also employed for the NJ analysis. In both
cases, the PHYLIP package [61] was used as follows. A
bootstrap analysis was performed using SEQBOOT (500
replicates for ML; 1000 replicates for NJ). Data were analyzed by ML using the software PHYML that generated 500
trees. The consensus phylogenetic tree was then obtained
(CONSENSE). For NJ, data were analyzed with PROTDIST
that generated 1000 distance matrices. The program
NEIGHBOR was then employed to generate 1000 trees.
Finally, the consensus phylogenetic tree was obtained
using CONSENSE. Trees were drawn using the TreeViewX
program v0.5.0. River lamprey type I keratins (Table 2)
were used as and outgroup to root trees.

(R) primers (Table 1), and 12.5 μl of iQ™ SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad). Matching oligonucleotide primers
were designed using Oligo v6.89 software (Medprobe).
Amplification of specific keratin encoding cDNA fragments was verified in previous assays by direct sequencing
of PCR products obtained with the same reaction conditions employed in real-time PCR. The real-time amplification protocol used was as follows: initial 7 min
denaturation and enzyme activation at 95°C, 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 s, and 70°C for 30 s. Each assay was done in
duplicate. For normalization of cDNA loading, all samples were run in parallel using GAPDH2 or 18S rRNA as
housekeeping genes for larval development and tissues,
respectively (Table 1). To estimate efficiencies, a standard
curve was generated for each primer pair based on known
quantities of cDNA (10-fold serial dilutions corresponding to cDNA transcribed from 100 to 0.01 ng of total
RNA). All calibration curves exhibited correlation coefficients higher than 0.99, and the corresponding real-time
PCR efficiencies were in the range 0.93–0.97. Relative
mRNA expression was determined using the 2-(ΔΔCt)
method [64]. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM.
Comparisons among groups were carried out with oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey
test for identification of the statistically distinct groups.
Significance was accepted for P < 0.05.

Presence of known domains in the predicted protein
sequence of sseKer1 and sseKer2 was determined by scanning in the PROSITE database [62]. PSCAN application at
the EMBOSS [63] was employed to identify type I keratin
motifs.

RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
Homogenization of juvenile tissues and larvae was carried
out using Lysing Matrix D (Q-BioGene) for 40 s at speed
setting 6 in the Fastprep FG120 instrument (Bio101).
Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of pooled larvae using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All RNA isolation procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases, total RNA was treated twice
with DNase I using the RNase-Free DNase kit (Qiagen) for
30 min in order to avoid amplification of contaminating
genomic DNA. RNA sample quality was checked using
Experion (Bio-Rad) and quantification was done spectrophotometrically. Total RNA (1 μg) from each sample was
reverse-transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad). Lack of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR amplification of RNA samples in the
absence of cDNA synthesis.

Real-time analysis was carried out on an iCycler (BioRad). Reactions were accomplished in a 25 μl volume
containing cDNA generated from 10 ng of original RNA
template, 300 nM each of specific forward (F) and reverse
