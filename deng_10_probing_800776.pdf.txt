Probing the pan-genome of Listeria
monocytogenes: new insights into intraspecific
niche expansion and genomic diversification
Xiangyu Deng1†, Adam M Phillippy2†, Zengxin Li1, Steven L Salzberg2, Wei Zhang1*

Abstract
Background: Bacterial pathogens often show significant intraspecific variations in ecological fitness, host
preference and pathogenic potential to cause infectious disease. The species of Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative
intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of human listeriosis, consists of at least three distinct genetic
lineages. Two of these lineages predominantly cause human sporadic and epidemic infections, whereas the third
lineage has never been implicated in human disease outbreaks despite its overall conservation of many known
virulence factors.
Results: Here we compare the genomes of 26 L. monocytogenes strains representing the three lineages based on
both in silico comparative genomic analysis and high-density, pan-genomic DNA array hybridizations. We uncover
86 genes and 8 small regulatory RNAs that likely make L. monocytogenes lineages differ in carbohydrate utilization
and stress resistance during their residence in natural habitats and passage through the host gastrointestinal tract.
We also identify 2,330 to 2,456 core genes that define this species along with an open pan-genome pool that
contains more than 4,052 genes. Phylogenomic reconstructions based on 3,560 homologous groups allowed
robust estimation of phylogenetic relatedness among L. monocytogenes strains.
Conclusions: Our pan-genome approach enables accurate co-analysis of DNA sequence and hybridization array
data for both core gene estimation and phylogenomics. Application of our method to the pan-genome of
L. monocytogenes sheds new insights into the intraspecific niche expansion and evolution of this important
foodborne pathogen.

Background
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive foodborne
bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of the
human and animal infectious disease, listeriosis. L.
monocytogenes can thrive in diverse environmental
reservoirs (e.g. soil, water, and sewage) and proliferate
under unfavorable conditions (e.g. high osmolarity, low
pH, and refrigeration temperature) that other bacterial
pathogens cannot endure [1-4]. Its robust physiological
characteristics, coupled with its ubiquity in food processing, distribution and retail environments, have
made L. monocytogenes difficult to manage in food

manufacturing, particularly for ready-to-eat food products. L. monocytogenes causes the highest rates of hospitalization (about 92%) and mortality (about 20%)
among all foodborne bacterial pathogens in the United
States [5], making the control of this bacterium in
foods a high priority for both food safety and public
health. Yet, the versatile lifestyle of L. monocytogenes
both inside and outside its host, and its unique capability to invade and replicate in different host cell types
(e.g. macrophages and nonprofessional phagocytes),
have made this opportunistic pathogen a paradigm for
studying host-pathogen interactions, pathophysiology,
gene regulation, and stress adaptation [6,7].
Previous molecular subtyping studies have collectively
suggested that the species of L. monocytogenes is composed of at least three major evolutionary or genetic
lineages that notably differ in their prevalence in causing

human and animal diseases [8-15]. Specifically, lineage I
(or LI) and lineage II (or LII) of L. monocytogenes are
frequently isolated from foods and implicated in the vast
majority (>95%) of both sporadic cases and epidemic
outbreaks of human listeriosis [3]. Genetic lineage III
(or LIII) strains are rarely reported in cases of human
infections, but are sometimes associated with animal
disease cases [3,14,16]. The mechanisms underlying the
biased predominance of certain L. monocytogenes genetic
lineages in human listeriosis remain largely unknown.
Several recent studies have revealed elevated levels of
genetic diversity among LIII isolates [12,15]. Multilocus
sequence typing analysis on the basis of partial sigB and
actA gene sequences have also suggested that LIII is
polyphyletic, with the co-existence of at least three distinct subgroups (i.e. LIIIA, LIIIB, LIIIC) [14,16]. Atypical
phenotypes of LIII isolates, such as deficiency in
rhamnose fermentation [14], attenuated virulence potential [16], reduced resistance to heat and cold stresses
[17] and lowered biofilm productivity [18], have collectively indicated that LIII may have followed a distinct
evolutionary path from other L. monocytogenes lineages.
Compared to fairly extensive studies on LI and LII
strains, little is known about LIII. Although it is documented that most listerial virulence factors such as the
positive regulatory factor (or PrfA) are well conserved
across the entire L. monocytogenes species, LIII strains
are underrepresented in both food contamination and
human listeriosis. This led us to speculate the existence
of additional, yet-to-be-identified genetic factors in the
predominant disease-causing L. monocytogenes lineages
(i.e. LI and LII) that may mediate listerial niche adaptation, resistance to extra- or intracellular stresses, and
pathogenicity. These unknown genetic factors may have
been lost, mutated, or decayed in LIII as the genomes
evolved, resulting in a defective phenotype for LIII isolates in certain ecological and host niches. To test our
hypothesis, we combined in silico comparative genomic
analyses with an array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) approach to probe the genomic diversity
of L. monocytogenes and to identify genomic features
common in LI and LII but absent in LIII. Array CGH is a
powerful yet cost-effective approach for genotyping and
detecting intraspecies genomic diversity for many bacteria. Previous efforts on comparative genomic analyses
underscore the usefulness of CGH in resolving genetic
lineages and identifying strain- or lineage-specific genes
in L. monocytogenes [10,19-22]. However, most of these
studies targeted only a number of selected genes or partial listerial genomes, making an accurate assessment of
intraspecies genomic diversity difficult.
It is recognized that a few sequenced genomes may
not fully represent the entire genetic repertoire of a
given organism [23-35]. For this reason, the pan-genome

concept has triggered new investigations on genomic
diversity for several bacterial species, including Streptococcus spp. [24,28,29], Haemophilus influenzae [25],
Neisseria meningitides [30], Escherichia coli [31-33], and
Lactococcus lactis [34]. Pan-genome refers to the total
genetic repertoire of a given species, which is typically
composed of “core” genes plus some “dispensable” or
“accessory” genes [25,27,35]. Pan-genomic DNA arrays,
which probe the full genetic repertoire, have recently
gained increasing popularity for the systematic survey of
diversity in prokaryotic species [31,36,37].
The availability of more than 20 L. monocytogenes full
and draft genomes has made this pathogen an ideal candidate for pan-genomic study (Table 1). Our initial comparative analysis of 17 L. monocytogenes genomes
indicated a “closed” pan-genome for this bacterial species. Species with a closed pan-genome typically share
highly syntenic genomes with less frequent horizontal
gene transfers (HGT) and genomic rearrangements.
Therefore, the entire gene pool can be fully sampled by
sequencing a small set of representative isolates, and the
number of new genes to be discovered by sequencing
additional genomes will quickly approach zero. This
prompted us to design and construct a pan-genome
CGH array that, in theory, accommodates the total
genomic diversity of the L. monocytogenes species on a
single DNA chip. Compared to several previous pangenome microarrays that targeted either the conserved
sequence of gene families with low probe density or no
coverage of the intergenic regions, we utilized a novel
probe selection algorithm (PanArray) to design a pangenome tiling array that incorporates the genomes of 20
available L. monocytogenes strains [38]. This design provides unbiased coverage of the pan-genome, and also
superior accuracy and resolution for data analysis.
Using integrated data obtained from both in silico
whole-genome comparisons and pan-genome CGH analyses, we (1) explored the intraspecific genetic diversity
of L. monocytogenes with a focus on the largely unexplored genetic lineage III; (2) estimated the core and
pan-genome that define the L. monocytogenes species;
(3) identified unique protein-coding genes and regulatory RNAs in the predominant disease-causing lineages,
as they may relate to ecological fitness, host niche adaptation and pathogenicity; and (4) reconstructed phylogeny for different L. monocytogenes lineages and strains
based on pan-genome characteristics.

Results
Pan-genomic array coverage

Initial power-law regression analysis of 17 sequenced
L. monocytogenes genomes (Table 1) suggested that
this bacterial species exhibits a nearly closed pan-genome, which would yield rapidly diminishing returns of

could be designed to query the full genetic repertoire
of the species, and be used to completely genotype
currently unsequenced strains. For this purpose we
designed a pan-genomic array comprising 385,000 50mer in situ synthesized oligonucleotide probes that
fully tile the sequences of 20 L. monocytogenes genomes (Table 1), with no gaps, at greater than 2-fold

our chip design, four additional L. monocytogenes

genomes were sequenced to closure, including strain
Clip 80459 (LI), strain Finland 1988 (LII), strain R2561 (LII) and strain HCC23 (LIII). These new L. monocytogenes genomes enabled us to evaluate the genomic
coverage of our array design by individually mapping
each of the 385,000 oligonucleotide probes to annotated genes to the four genomes. A 50-mer probe was
mapped to a particular gene if it perfectly matched the
gene sequence or contained only a single nucleotide
mismatch. For each annotated gene, the probe coverage was calculated as the percentage of the gene length

covered by mapped probes. Results in Table 2 suggest
that our design adequately represents the intraspecies
diversity of L. monocytogenes, particularly for LI and
LII genomes. However, due to the limited number of
fully sequenced LIII genomes available at the time of
design, the coverage for LIII specific genes is less optimal, as indicated by HCC23.
Accuracy of CGH detection calls

Genomic DNA of nine LIII strains were each co-hybridized on the pan-genome arrays with that of EGD-e
(LII) as an internal reference. The nine LIII strains were
carefully selected from a strain collection to represent 3
different serotypes (4a, 4b, and 4c) and 3 different subgroups (LIIIA, LIIIB, and LIIIC) of this lineage (Table
1). Individual probes were designated as present or
absent in the sample based on statistical analysis of the
normalized signal intensities (see Materials and Methods). Since the position of each probe is known for all
sequenced L. monocytogenes genomes, genes were
scored by the fraction of targeting probes with a positive
signal, otherwise known as the positive fraction (PF).
This yields a very flexible scoring scheme that can be
readily applied to any intragenic or intergenic feature of
the genome targeted by a sufficient number of probes.
A high PF indicates a gene is likely present in the hybridized genome. Circular maps of all PF values for the
nine LIII genomes in reference to an LI strain F2365
and an LII strain EGD-e are shown in Figure 1.
To select an appropriate PF threshold and test the
accuracy of gene calls based on PF values, we examined
the true-positive and false-positive rates of the PF criterion for 51,814 annotated L. monocytogenes genes, compared against genomes for which we had both sequence
and CGH array data. True gene “presence” was determined by a tblastn search of the 51,814 predicted proteins against a six frame translation of the genome [39],
requiring a minimum of 50% amino acid similarity and
an E-value ≤ 10-5. Figure 2 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves for the PF criterion
measured against the tblastn standard for two L. monocytogenes strains, EGD-e and J2-071. The PF measure is

remarkably robust, as there appear to be very few genes
near the classification threshold. Additional file 1 shows
a density estimation of PF values for both present and
absent genes, suggesting that the vast majority of present genes have PF > 0.9 and absent genes PF < 0.1.
Based on the ROC analysis, a PF cutoff of 0.6 was chosen to best match the tblastn results and minimize the
expected error rate. The seemingly higher false-positive
rate for J2-071, in comparison to the closed EGD-e genome, is partially due to tblastn false-negatives incurred
from the 78 gaps in the J2-071 draft genome. In these
cases, a gene that is truly present, but overlapping a
sequencing gap, is falsely reported as absent by the
tblastn method which artificially increases the measured
false-positive rate of the CGH array method.
Accuracy statistics for the chosen 0.6 PF cutoff versus
the 50% alignment similarity cutoff are given in Table 3.
The array has perfect sensitivity for detecting the EGDe and J2-071 control genes. Expected accuracy was estimated for detecting both individual gene variants from
all other strains and for detecting homologous gene
groups (HGs). Orthologous gene groups are typically
preferred; however, the inability of CGH to accurately
determine sequence identity and gene order makes it
impractical to discriminate between highly similar paralogs. Alternatively, we tested for the presence of 3,560
strongly homologous groups, identified by clustering
proteins with higher than 50% amino acid similarity.
A gene group was marked as present in a genome if
any gene from that group exceeded the BLAST or PF
threshold. Figure 2 also displays the true- and falsepositive rates of HG detection alongside the original
ROC curves. In comparison to detecting individual gene
variants, HG detection significantly increases the sensitivity of the array without increasing the false-positive
rate. When analyzing only a single gene variant on the
chip, high polymorphism in the sample genome can disrupt hybridization and lead to false-negatives. However,
by considering an entire gene group, a sample only
needs to hybridize with its nearest variant, thereby
increasing the sensitivity [34]. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the array at detecting HGs in unsequenced
strains, Table 3 also lists accuracy statistics for EGD-e
and J2-071 when the probes specific to those genomes
are removed from the analysis. This simulates the accuracy of the array at calling genes in an unsequenced LII
or LIII strain. The sensitivity of the array is only slightly
affected, with a 0.2% true-positive rate drop for EGD-e
and a 1.3% drop for J2-071. The drop is more pronounced for J2-071 because it is one of only two LIII
genomes included on the array, so ignoring the J2-071
specific probes affects the sensitivity of calling HGs
from that lineage.

Estimation of core and pan-genomes

The expected number of new genes to be discovered by
sequencing additional L. monocytogenes strains, and the
sizes of the core and pan-genomes, were estimated
using methods adapted from Tettelin et al. [24].

Frequent gaps and sequencing errors in low-quality genome assemblies were found to cause many missed protein alignments, which affected the core genome
estimation. For example, only 683 EGD-e proteins meet
the alignment threshold in all 24 draft L. monocytogenes

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500

genomes, an unreasonably low number. Additionally,
fragmented annotations in the low quality genomes artificially inflate the pan-genome size estimate. To avoid
these artifacts, only 18 “high quality” L. monocytogenes
genomes were used for the new genes and pan-genome
estimation. Genomes sequenced to less than 10× coverage using 454 pyrosequencing were excluded from the
sequence analysis (Table 1). Array CGH results for the
8 additional LIII genomes were included in the core
gene estimate.
To estimate the L. monocytogenes core genome, the
number of shared genes was computed for many random permutations of N genomes, and the mean number
of shared genes was computed for each N. The number
of core genes for the species was estimated by fitting an
exponential decay function to the means. For the highquality sequenced genomes, this analysis yielded an estimated horizontal asymptote of 2,467 ± 7 core genes.
However, the sequenced genomes include only two LIII
genomes. Repeating the analysis for all 26 genomes,
including CGH results for the 8 additional LIII genomes, reduced the estimate by over 100 genes to 2,330
± 5, emphasizing the importance of a balanced sample
of diversity for estimating core genome size. Figure 3A
displays the result of the 26 genome analysis including a
smoothed density plot of the shared gene count distributions, the mean value for each N, and the best-fit
exponential decay.
Imperfect detection sensitivity due to sequencing gaps
makes it impossible to achieve convergence for real
data, so an exact core genome cannot be determined.
Any non-zero false-positive rate for detecting core genes
will artificially shrink the core genome with each additional genome, violating the horizontal asymptote of an
exponential decay. This is evident in the almost linearly
decreasing means towards the tail of Figure 3A. To
account for these false-negatives, we introduced an additional parameter to the core genes model that adds a
constant number of false-negatives upon the addition of
each genome (see Materials and Methods). The revised

model is a much closer fit to the data (residual standard
error of 2.98 versus 10.68), accounts for noisy draft and
CGH data, and yields an increased core genes estimate
of 2,456 ± 4. This likely represents an upper bound on
the core genome size. Considering results from both
models, and the uncertainty caused by the draft genomes and CGH data, we estimate the core genome of

(approximately 80% of a typical L. monocytogenes
genome).

Figure 3 Prediction of core, new and pan genes in L. monocytogenes. (A) Exponential regression analysis that predicts the number of core
genes in N sequenced genomes. For each N, permutations are randomly sampled and the number of core genes conserved in all N genomes is
computed. The estimated number of core genes in 26 L. monocytogenes genomes ranges from 2,330 to 2,456. The sampled distribution is
represented by a smoothed color density plot obtained through kernel density estimation. Yellow indicates the lowest density and purple
indicates the highest density. For each N, black circles indicate the mean value and whiskers indicate the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the
distribution. An exponential decay fit to the means is given by a solid red curve. A modified exponential decay is given by a solid black curve,
which better fits the observed data by accounting for false-negative gene calls. (B) Power law regression analysis predicts the number of new
genes that will be discovered by sequencing additional L. monocytogenes genomes. The LIII genomes are the outliers that pull the means
higher, indicating that LIII diversity has not yet been fully sequenced. (C) Power law regression analysis predicts the number of L. monocytogenes
pan genes accumulated from genome sequencing is currently 4,052 and growing.

A major limitation of array CGH is that this method
cannot detect novel genes contained in LIII genomes.
For this reason, the pan-genome estimation was performed for only the high-quality sequenced genomes, of
which two are from LIII. Again, the number of new
genes identified by sequencing each additional genome
was computed for many random permutations of N genomes. The number of new genes identified for each N
was modeled by the power law function n = N-a [26].
Using the median values, the power law exponent a was
estimated to be 1.12 ± 0.02. This is slightly lower than
our original estimate of 1.38 due to the recent sequencing of four additional genomes, an updated annotation,

and a stricter similarity threshold. In both cases, an
exponent a > 1 indicates a closed pan-genome, meaning
the size of the pan-genome is a bounded function of the
number of sequenced genomes. However, fitting a
power law to the mean values of these distributions
yields a = 0.85 ± 0.01, suggesting an open pan-genome
(Figure 3C). This difference is caused largely by the
diverse strains N1-017, HCC23, and J2-071, which contain many strain-specific genes and pull the mean values
higher than the medians. For example, strain HCC23
contains 122 strain-specific genes not found in any of
the other 17 strains. Removal of these three genomes
from the analysis results in an a slightly greater than

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/500

one for both the mean and median analyses. Two of
these genomes are the only LIII strains in the analysis,
indicating that additional sequencing from LIII may
reduce the exponent even further. This regression analysis suggests L. monocytogenes has a significantly diverse
gene reservoir, and additional sequencing of LIII genomes is necessary to resolve the exact size and nature of
the L. monocytogenes pan-genome.
The estimated growth of the L. monocytogenes pangenome with additional sequencing was also simulated
using many random permutations of genomes. For open
pan-genomes, the cumulative number of unique genes
discovered with the sequencing of additional genomes
can be modeled by Heap’s law using the power law
function n = Ng [26]. This regression is illustrated by
Figure 3B and g was estimated as 0.12 ± 0.001. Since
the growth of an open pan-genome is equivalent to the
number of new genes added after sequencing each successive genome, the derivative of the pan genes function
should be equal to the new genes function. That is Ng-1
∝ N-a and a = 1 - g for a < 1. Although simulated separately, the pan and new gene functions do follow this
property for the mean value regressions, with a = 0.85
and g = 0.12 being in good agreement. For N = 18, the
mean estimated pan-genome size is 4,052 and continues
to grow, with diminishing returns, for larger N.
The above method is useful for estimating the size of
the pan-genome, but because it depends on the order of
the genomes analyzed, it does not yield a single representative set of pan genes for the analyzed strains. An

Page 8 of 21

alternative that does not depend on the order of genomes is to measure the number of gene groups identified by a similarity clustering method such as
OrthoMCL [40]. We applied a similar approach, but for
clustering strong homologs rather than orthologs, to be
consistent with the other analyses. From a graph of
52,776 proteins with > 50% similar proteins connected
by edges, 3,744 HGs were identified (Additional file 2)
using the MCL graph clustering algorithm [41]. This
provides a relative lower bound for the size of the currently sequenced L. monocytogenes pan-genome.
Lineage-specific genes and disparately distributed genes

Lineage-specific genes refer to genes that are exclusively
present in a single L. monocytogenes lineage based on
the above defined similarity threshold. To maintain a
stringent threshold, a gene is not considered to be lineage-specific if any member of its HG is present in
another lineage. Annotated genes in F2365 (LI), EGD-e
(LII), and J2-071 (LIII) were used to screen for gene
lineage specificity against all genomes analyzed in this
study. Table 4 lists 4 LI- 5 LII- and 6 LIII-specific genes
identified in our study. Most of these genes encode
hypothetical proteins. It is notable that only 5 of the 21
LII-specific genes previously identified by Doumith et al
[10] passed our lineage specificity threshold. We used
colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to verify
the lineage specificity for all LI- and LIII-specific genes
identified by CGH analysis (except for LMOf2365-0409
due to the small size of this gene for proper PCR primer

Lineage specificity is based on comparative analysis of 26 genomes in this study, including 7 LI strains (F2365, H7858, Clip 80459, N1-017, R2-503, HPB2262 and
J1-194), 9 LII strains (EGD-e, R2-561, Finland 1988, 10403S, N3-165, F6900, F6854, J2818 and J0161) and 10 LIII genomes (HCC23, J2-071, F2-501, F2-524, J1-208,
M1-002, W1-111, F2-208, F2-569 and W1-110). Gene ID is designated based on a respective reference genome.

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500

design). A total of 225 colony PCR assays were conducted for randomly selected L. monocytogenes strains
in our collection, including 8 LI, 8 LII, and 9 LIII
strains. The PCR results confirmed the lineage specificity for all genes analyzed, suggesting that the CGH
approach was accurate for calling gene presence or
absence and determining lineage specificity.
We identified 86 disparately distributed genes (or
DDGs) as listed in Table 5. DDGs refer to genes
that are highly conserved (PF > 0.6 or protein similarity >50%) in LI and LII genomes but absent or highly
divergent (PF < 0.6) in at least six of the nine LIII genomes. DDGs are of particular interest for us because the
biased distribution and conservation of these genes in LI
and LII genomes likely correlate to the enhanced ecological fitness and pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes in
the host. The largest functional group of DDGs (41%) is
associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism.
Figure 1 illustrates their distribution. L. monocytogenes
harbors one of the largest bacterial carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) genes [42-44]. The abundance and diversity of the PTS system allows this soil
saprophyte to utilize different carbon sources associated
with the ecosystems it inhabits such as soil, silage and
sediments. Fifteen PTS genes were identified as DDGs;
most are associated with fructose-specific PTS enzyme
II components (lmo0357-0358, lmo0631-0633, lmo21352137, and lmo2733). We surveyed the distribution of
978 annotated PTS genes and their homologs in all 26
L. monocytogenes genomes, and found 965 (99%) PTS
genes are conserved in all LI and LII genomes and 7
(0.7%) are specific to LI. In contrast, 137 (14%) PTS
genes are absent or divergent in LIII genomes. Diversity
in PTS content is most noticeable among the three LIII
subgroups, where 48 (4.8%), 137 (14%), and 136 (13.9%)
PTS genes are absent in LIIIA, LIIIB and LIIIC, respectively. An interesting distinction among 3 subgroups is
that LIIIA strains are capable of fermenting rhamnose,
whereas LIIIB and LIIIC strains are deficient in rhamnose utilization [14]. We discovered a cluster of six
genes (lmo2846-2851), which is likely to mediate rhamnose utilization, is missing from all LIIIB and LIIIC genomes. Five genes in this cluster [45] share protein
similarities to the rhamnose catabolic pathway in Escherichia coli [46,47] and other Gram-positive bacteria such
as Bacillus subtilius (Additional file 3).
The second-largest functional group of DDGs consists
of 12 putative transcription factors representing 7 different regulatory gene families. Six are adjacent to PTS
genes and possibly involved in regulating carbohydrate
metabolism. Four are absent from the non-pathogenic L.
innocua [43], L. welshimeri [48] and L. seeligeri [49],
suggesting roles in virulence and pathogenicity. One
Crp/Fnr (cyclic AMP receptor protein–fumarate and

Page 9 of 21

nitrate reduction regulator) family gene lmo0753 was
found to be highly specific to LI and LII but absent in
LIII. This Crp/Fnr factor is adjacent to a bile resistance
gene btlB and shares similar functional domains with
prfA, the master regulatory gene of L. monocytogenes
virulence.
We found multiple DDGs associated with gastrointestinal (GI) tract adaptation. For instance, two bile-associated genes btlB (lmo0754) and pva (lmo0446) are
absent in LIII. Both genes help L. monocytogenes resist
the antimicrobial effects imposed by bile salts during its
passage through human GI tract [50]. Loss of these
genes lowered tolerance to bile and reduced persistence
in murine GI tract [51]. The glutamate decarboxylase
(GAD) system mediates the acid resistance in bacteria
[52-54]. In L. monocytogenes gadD1 (lmo0447) is responsible for growth at mild acidic conditions (pH = 5.1) and
gadD2 (lmo2363) primarily mediates the resistance to
severe acidic stress (pH = 2.8) [55]. We found that
gadD2 is conserved in all lineages, whereas gadD1 and
its coupled glutamate: g-aminobutyrate antiporter gadT1
(lmo0448) are absent in most LIII strains except for J2071 and HCC23. An arginine deminase (ADI) system
(lmo0036-0041) was recently characterized in L. monocytogenes [56]. The ADI system plays a role in listerial acid
tolerance and may contribute to the enhanced adaptation to acidic conditions in the stomach. It was previously reported that this gene cluster is present in LI
and LII but absent from LIII and non-pathogenic
L. innocua and L. welshimeri [56]. Our results, however,
showed that the ADI gene cluster is also highly conserved in LIIIB. An additional seventeen DDGs have no
homolog in the genome of L. innocua, including three
putative genes encoding LPXTG surface proteins
(lmo0333, lmo1666 and lmo2085) and sepA, a putative
virulence factor co-regulated by PrfA and sB [57,58].
Small regulatory RNAs

Complete tiling of the L. monocytogenes pan-genome
allowed us to survey the distribution of 100 non-coding
small regulatory RNAs with specified 5’ and 3’ positions
[45] in 9 LIII genomes. The majority (87%) of these
sRNAs are conserved in LIII genomes, and only eight
were found to be absent or divergent in LIII (PF < 0.6)
(Table 6). Noticeably, all eight sRNAs are also absent
from L. innocua, and five were differentially expressed
in intestinal lumen or blood, suggesting roles in host
niche adaptation. For example, ril38 contributes to listerial survival in human blood [45].
Phylogenomic reconstruction

To reconstruct the phylogeny of all L. monocytogenes
strains analyzed in this study, we surveyed the binary distributions of 3,560 HGs (Additional file 4) and 2,846

EGD-e protein-coding genes among the 26 L. monocytogenes genomes, respectively. We then constructed neighbor-joining (NJ) trees [59] based on a maximumlikelihood gene content distance measurement [60] (Figure
4). The NJ trees based on 3,560 HGs (Figure 4A) and
2,846 EGD-e genes (Figure 4B) both clearly separated all
L. monocytogenes strains into 3 main clusters (i.e. a LI
cluster, a LII cluster and a LIII cluster) [61]. However, the
EGD-e gene-based NJ tree showed a distorted topology,
indicative of a bias caused by a restricted set of loci used
for phylogenetic reconstruction [62].

Of note in LI, the serotype 4b strain N1-017 appears to
be closely related to serotype 1/2b strains in the LI cluster, likely representing an evolutionary intermediate
between the split of serotype 4b and serotype 1/2b [10].
Of note in LII, four strains F6900, F6854, J2818 and
J0161 were previously traced back to a single food processing facility over a time span of 12 years [63]. These
four isolates are clustered closely on a single branch,
indicative of a recent common ancestry.
While the NJ trees based on gene content allowed some
inference of L. monocytogenes phylogeny, the reliability of

the tree topology can be compromised by reticulate events
such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Therefore, a split
network was constructed using the Neighbor-net algorithm [64] to evaluate the extent by which incompatible
phylogenetic signals (e.g. HGT) might affect our estimation of phylogenetic topology. Split networks do not force
the formation of a tree-like structure and are able to represent incompatible signals as parallel edges, indicating the
possibility of HGT or recombination. The resulting split
network (Figure 4c) shows a congruent topology with the
NJ tree (Figure 4a), suggesting the majority of the 3,560
HGs have been vertically inherited.
Genomic diversification in L. monocytogenes lineage III

Figure 5A shows a rooted NJ tree for the three LIII subgroups, using EGD-e as an outgroup. HCC23 appears to
be most closely related to LIIIA. Further evidence that
links HCC23 to LIIIA is the rhamnose utilization gene
cluster. This gene cluster is conserved in LIIIA and
HCC23 but absent in LIIIB and LIIIC. The rooted NJ
tree also suggests that LIII is polyphyletic and HCC23
possibly resembles an ancestral state of LIII. The emergence of 3 LIII subgroups is likely to be concomitant
with stepwise genome reduction as observed in some

Page 13 of 21

non-pathogenic Listeria species, including L. welshimeri
[48] and L. seeligeri [49].
A total of 206 genes, that are highly conserved in LI and
LII, are found to be phylogenetically informative for LIII
(i.e. present or absent in at least one LIII strain) (see Additional file 5). Figure 5C shows a heat map of these genes
in the ten LIII strains. Interestingly, gradual gene decay or
diversification was observed in the order of LIIIA, LIIIC
and LIIIB. Loss of select LI and LII core genes was most
significant in LIIIB. This LIII subgroup forms a deep
branch in a split network (Figures 5B). However, it should
be noted that the contribution of novel LIII genes to the
phylogenetic reconstruction is likely to be underestimated
due to the limited number of fully sequenced LIII genomes available at the time of this study.
To access the inter-lineage diversity from a gene
content perspective, we identified 576, 521 and 489
accessory genes in F2365 (LI), EGD-e (LII), and J2-071
(LIII), respectively and surveyed their distributions in 26
L. monocytogenes genomes (Additional file 6). Minimum
spanning trees were then built to compare and visualize
the different distributions of these accessory genes
across the three lineages (Additional file 7). Accessory
genes display similar distributions in most LI and LII

strains, featured by one to two dominant subsets (shown
as large circles) generated by genes present or absent in
most strains of the same lineage. However, more complex and branched distributions were observed in LIII
strains, demonstrating an elevated genomic diversity in
this rare L. monocytogenes lineage.

Discussion
Pan-genome CGH was used in this study to compare L.
monocytogenes genomes in pursuit of novel genes that
potentially promote the fitness and virulence of LI and
LII strains in human, as these strains are predominantly
associated with human listeriosis. We used phylogenomic concepts [65] to guide our search for DDGs and
to infer the phylogeny for the species. Array CGH is suitable for the purpose of this study because it is relatively
cost-effective compared to the sequencing and closure
required to make accurate gene calls using whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Unlike whole-genome sequencing, however, the CGH approach has several inherent
limitations in detecting novel genes or pseudogenes,
inferring sequence-based phylogenies, and for a host of
other analyses inaccessible with array data.
A particular challenge in this study was to unify the
analysis of both genome sequence and CGH array data.
The sensitivity of the two methods is fundamentally different. BLAST searches are capable of precisely measuring amino acid similarity and can identify orthologs and
detect distant homologies. In contrast, DNA array hybridizations measure nucleotide conservation and are only
capable of detecting highly conserved DNA sequences.
In addition, hybridization gives no positional information and is non-specific, making it difficult to discriminate between paralogs. For this reason, we used
homologous groups for gene content comparison, and
permitted variant sequences to hybridize to their nearest
neighbor in a group, rather than a single selected variant
(see Methods). Prior to implementing this method, there
was tremendous detection bias in the CGH data. The
HG method greatly increased the agreement between
the array and BLAST detection strategies, which was
critical for the phylogenetic analysis of the combined
data.
The low frequency of LIII in human listeriosis can be
partially explained by its overall rarity in foods, lack of
unrecognized virulence factors, or defective mutation in
some known virulence factors. For instance, a novel
streptolysin S-like hemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor, listeriolysin S, was recently found to be exclusively
present in LI strains [66]. This factor contributes to
virulence of the pathogen in murine and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based assays [66]. Several
studies also reported that premature stop codons are
common in inlA in LIII strains [67-70]. Point mutations

Page 14 of 21

in inlA are presumably caused by localized recombination and lead to a truncated InlA protein and consequently a reduced invasion phenotype in human
intestinal epithelial cells [67-70]. Our pan-genome study
uncovered 86 DDGs and 8 non-coding small RNAs that
are absent or mutated in the largely uncharacterized
LIII genomes (Table 5 and Table 6). Most of these
genes fall into the functional categories of cell wall
structure, transcription regulation, and carbohydrate
metabolism and transport. Such functions are likely to
play critical roles in ecological fitness of L. monocytogenes in different environment such as food processing
facilities and host niches. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport stand out as the largest
functional group of DDGs, implying that the capability
of utilizing different carbon sources in the transmission
and infection cycle contribute most to the predominance of LI and LII strains in human infections. In particular, PTS systems that are likely to confer nichespecific metabolic advantages are conserved in LI and
LII but decayed or lost in LIII. For example, the fructose-like PTS components (lmo2133—lmo2137) are conserved in all LI and LII genomes but completely lost in
LIIIB and LIIIC (Figure 1). This operon was postulated
to have been acquired by L. monocytogenes through
HGT from Enterobacteriaceae that cohabitate the GI
tract of mammalian host [71]. A recent study of its
homolog in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli suggested
that this operon promotes bacterial fitness against the
stress in host serum and gut, and enhances bacterial
invasion in eukaryotic cells [72]–both are integral parts
of listerial pathogenesis.
L. monocytogenes possess extraordinary capabilities for
sustaining harsh conditions during its residency in the
environment (e.g. it can utilize limited carbon source),
in foods (e.g. it can resist salts and grow at refrigeration
temperatures), and in parasitized hosts (e.g. it can
escape from immune defense). During its passage
through the human GI tract, L. monocytogenes is able to
resist the antimicrobial effects imposed by gastric contents. Multiple genes involved in combating GI tractrelated stresses, primarily gastric acid (gadD1, gadT1
and the ADI system) and bile salts (btlB and pva), are
missing in LIII. Loss of these genes may result in a
defective phenotype in surviving the GI tract prior to
invasive infection [50]. Also absent in most LIII genomes are a number of small regulatory RNAs (e.g. rli29
and rli48) and transcription factors (e.g. lmo2138 and
lmo2851) that appear to be up-regulated in the murine
intestine [45]. It is reasonable to speculate that the GI
tract may act as a major barrier to prevent LIII strains
from causing systematic infections. Epidemiological studies seem to support this speculation by collectively
showing that gastroenteritis, rather than more severe

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/500

Page 15 of 21

listeriosis symptoms, is predominant among infected
individuals [73-75]. Although intracellular strategies
have been the primary focus in numerous studies of listerial pathogenesis, a few recent studies demonstrated
that the GI passage has a fundamental impact on listerial pathogenicity [76,77]. Considering that most LIII
strains possess virulence factors related to its intracellular lifestyle and are cytopathogenic [14], the inability to
survive in the GI tract becomes a plausible explanation
for the overall rarity of LIII in human listeriosis.
We estimate that the L. monocytogenes core-genome
consists of 2,330 to 2,456 genes and the pan-genome
encompasses over 4,052 genes (Figure 3). Compared to
several other bacterial species, L. monocytogenes has
relatively higher proportions (about 80%) of core genes
shared by individual genomes (Table 7), which in turn
reflects lower intraspecies genomic variability. This is
consistent with the low rates of recombination in this
bacterial species [68]. Despite the perceived high genomic synteny, L. monocytogenes possesses considerably
diverse pan gene reservoir and displays biased distribution of accessory genes across major evolutionary
lineages (Additional file 7).
Some incompatible phylogenetic signals as indicated in
the split network (Figure 4C) were traced back to
prophage-associated genes. Notably, the comK prophage
regions in different L. monocytogenes genomes display
significant sequence variations (Additional file 8). Such
variations may be a result of prophage decay, recombination that have accumulated in the remnants of common prophage ancestor(s), or multiple lysogenization of
different bacteriophages at the same genomic location.
Phages have been recognized as the major contributors

of important biological properties (e.g. virulence factors)
in many bacterial species [78,79]. The functional impact
of bacteriophages on the biology of L. monocytogenes, if
any, has yet to be determined.

Conclusions
Intraspecific variations in host preference, ecological
fitness and virulence are common in many bacterial
pathogens. This is exemplified by the species of L.
monocytogenes which consists of multiple distinct
genetic lineages. Two lineages of this species (i.e. LI
and LII) predominantly cause human sporadic and epidemic infections, whereas the other (i.e. LIII) has never
been implicated in human disease outbreaks for
unclear yet intriguing reasons. Here we described a
novel pan-genomic approach that combines in silico
comparative analysis and high-density CGH arrays to
explore the genomic diversity of L. monocytogenes. Our
integrated approach allows vigorous core genome estimation and phylogenomic reconstruction, which in
turn is nearly impossible for low-quality, short-read
draft genome assemblies with hundreds of contigs.
Exponential regression analysis predicts that L. monocytogenes has a core genome of between 2,330 to 2,456
genes (80% of each individual genome) and a pan-genome repertoire of over 4,052 unique genes. Comparison of all lineage strains reveals high genomic synteny
with limited sequence drift associated with lysogenic
bacteriophages. Phylogenomic reconstructions based
on 3,560 homologous groups suggest a polyphyletic
population infrastructure and gradual loss of metabolic
genes as this saprophytic species diversified into the
rare and probably defective lineage III. Based on our

results, one L. monocytogenes strain carries about 75%
of the pan genes of this species. That said, experiments
based on a single reference strain may not adequately
sample the total genetic repertoire and not fully interpret the versatile biology of L. monocytogenes. With a
more defined species core genome, we may also be
able to supplement new genomic criterion for taxonomic classification of L. monocytogenes, as some traditional methods are often inconclusive and
controversial. The pan-genomic approach described
here can be used to explore the genomic diversity in
other pathogenic species, as such information would
be extremely valuable for us to better understand the
intraspecific variations in virulence, and the ecology,
epidemiology and evolution of microbial pathogens.

Methods
Bacterial isolates and genomic DNA extraction

Table 1 lists the 31 L. monocytogenes strains analyzed in
this study. As of November 2008, twenty sequenced
L. monocytogenes strains were available and used for the
pan-genome array design. CGH was performed for nine
LIII strains representing 3 serotypes (4a, 4b, and 4c) and
3 subgroups (LIIIA, LIIIB, and LIIIC). Four additional
isolates that were sequenced after the array design were
incorporated in the pan-genomic and phylogenetic analysis. Bacterial strains were grown overnight in brain
heart infusion (BHI) broth at 35°C. Genomic DNA was
extracted and purified using MasterPure Gram positive
DNA purification kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies,
Madison, WI). Genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3 or
Cy5 dye prior to array hybridization.
Pan-genomic array design

The pan-genome tiling array was designed using the
PanArray software [38] to fully tile the 20 sequenced
L. monocytogenes genomes (Table 1). PanArray
employs a greedy probe selection algorithm to tile
multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of
probes. For this study, PanArray was used to design an
array comprising 385,000 50-mer oligonucleotide
probes that fully tile the 20 listerial genomes at 2.65 ×
coverage with no gaps. To avoid tiling low quality or
contaminant sequence, contigs less than 2 Kbp in
length were discarded, leaving 54,810,759 bp of tiled
sequence. A full description of the array design is
given in [38], and the array design is available from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [80] under
accession number GPL8942. To incorporate newly
sequenced strains that had not been included in the
original array design, we aligned all probes on the
array to the new genomes allowing one mismatch per
probe, and added genes with probe coverage ≥90% of
their length to the array annotation.

Array hybridization and data analysis

Genomic DNA of each LIII strain was co-hybridized with
that of EGD-e on a Roche NimbleGen 385 K custom
CGH array. Two dye-swap replicates were performed for
each LIII strain/EGD-e pair to eliminate dye bias and test
the array reproducibility. Genomic DNA labeling and
array hybridization were performed at Roche NimbleGen
according to the manufacturers specifications (Madison,
WI). Technical details on DNA labeling and hybridization can be found at http://www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/cgh_userguide_v6p0.pdf . We designed a probebased intensity classification scheme to provide the most
flexibility for pan-genome array data analysis, allowing
any locus to be classified based on the aggregated scores
of its individual probes, without reference to control
hybridization. Specifically, all raw signal intensities were
first transformed to log values, then log intensities for
replicate hybridizations were normalized using quantile
normalization [81]. Replicates were combined at the
probe level by taking the average of the normalized log
intensities for each probe. Quantile normalization
assumes similar intensity distributions, so to avoid crosssample normalization bias. Each strain was normalized
and processed independently.
Because there was no one single reference to operate on,
and to preserve sensitivity for small polymorphisms, intensity data was not smoothed or segmented. Instead, individual probes were each classified as present or absent using
a minimum kernel density (MKD) method. MKD methods
have performed well for the binary classification of both
genes and segments [31,82], and here we extended the
idea to the classification of individual probes. Because the
array contains the full genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes and 4,300 random control probes, there is expected
to be a significant fraction of both present and absent
probe intensities for any L. monocytogenes sample. Therefore, the distribution of probe intensities is generally bimodal, and the minima between the present and absent peaks
can be used as an effective threshold for binary classification. For each sample, the probability density function of
the observed intensities was estimated using kernel density
estimation and the central minima of this function identified as the optimal cutoff (Additional file 9). This method
was preferred because it is non-parametric, there is no
potential normalization bias, it requires no training, and
each sample can be processed independently without
affecting the accuracy. It is also extremely flexible, in that
a classification for any gene can be generated by aggregating the classifications of the probes targeting that gene.
For this purpose, genes were scored by collecting all
probes known to target a specific gene and computing the
fraction of probes classified as present, the positive fraction (PF). A PF threshold of 0.6 was chosen by analysis of
ROC curves for the EGD-e and J2-071 controls to

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/500

minimize the total error rate (false-positive rate + falsenegative rate) versus the tblastn 50% protein similarity
threshold. PF was favored because it does not depend on
cross-sample normalization, as would be necessary for an
intensity threshold, and additional genomes can be analyzed independently without affecting accuracy. This
makes it ideal for rapid and economical analysis of novel
isolates, while maintaining comparable accuracy to alternative analysis methods [31,34].
Pan-genomic analysis

Pan-genomic analysis was performed using the methods
introduced by Tettelin et al. [24], with modifications on
the conservation threshold and permutation sampling.
Annotated proteins for each genome were aligned to the
six frame translations of all other genomes using tblastn.
Query proteins were marked as present in a subject genome if the corresponding amino acid sequences aligned
at ≥ 50% similarity with an E-value ≤ 10-5, where “similarity” was defined as the number of positively scored
residues divided by the length of the protein sequence.
This threshold is more stringent than originally proposed in [24], but less stringent than those used in
other studies (e.g. [32]). The 50% threshold was empirically selected as a compromise between tolerating draft
genomes with fragmented annotations and avoiding
false positive detections due to conserved domains and
distant paralogs. A PF threshold of 0.6 was consequently
chosen as an analogous threshold for the CGH results,
as described above. Genomes sequenced to less than
10× coverage using 454 pyrosequencing were excluded
from the analysis.
The addition of an N th genome was simulated by
examining ordered combinations of N genomes. Due to
the large number of available genomes, it was not feasible to consider all possible permutations as originally
suggested. Instead, a randomly selected subset of
100,000 permutations was considered for the addition of
each N, and the mean (or median) values were computed from this subset. For each permutation, the number of new genes found in the N th genome G N was
computed as the number of proteins of GN not present
in any genomes Gi for i = {1, ..., N-1}. The number of
core genes was computed as the number of proteins of
GN present in all genomes Gi for i = {1, ..., N}. Because
gene sequences for the CGH strains are not known,
EGD-e was set to be GN for all permutations. The number of pan genes in a permutation of N genomes was
computed by examining the genomes Gi in order from
1 to N. A gene in Gi was identified as a pan gene if it
was not present in any of the genomes Gj for all j < i.
The Gauss-Newton method implemented by the R
function nls [83] was used to perform non-linear least
squares regression on the mean and medians of the core

Page 17 of 21

genes, new genes, and pan genes distributions. According to [26], the number of new genes n expected to be
discovered by sequencing an Nth genome was modeled
by the power law function n = N-a, and the number of
pan genes also by a power law n = Ng. According to
[24], the number of core genes was modeled by the
exponential decay function n = e -N/τ + Ω, where Ω
describes the horizontal asymptote and therefore the
core genes estimate. In all cases, the functions were fit
to the mean or median values for all N > 1.
To accommodate false-negative errors introduced by
sequencing gaps and weak hybridization signal, the originally proposed exponential decay function was modified with the addition of a fourth parameter to model
the effect of a constant number of false-negatives with
the addition of each genome. The modified equation is:
n =  e −N  + Ω − N 

where the linear parameter b represents the number
of core genes lost to false-negative errors for each N.
Core gene loss due to false-negatives is not a truly linear
phenomenon (e.g. sequencing gaps are not independent
and the core genome can never be negative), but for a
large core genome and a modest N it is a reasonable
approximation that is easy to fit. To assure convergence
of the optimization algorithm, b was first estimated via
linear regression for N ≥ 15, and this was used as the
start estimate of b for the full model regression. The
augmented model is useful in that the observed core
genome size may be linearly decreasing (as is expected
for draft genomes), but an estimate of the true core genome size Ω may still be recovered.
Identification of homologous groups

Homologous groups (HGs) were used for phylogenetic
reconstruction and core genome estimation. HGs were
identified by clustering a graph of protein similarity for
all annotated protein-coding genes from the 18 highquality L. monocytogenes genomes. A node was added
to the graph for each one of the 52,776 annotated proteins. Edges were added between any two proteins with
an alignment above the 50% similarity threshold.
Unlike OrthoMCL, no orthology constraint was
applied. Edges between any two similar proteins were
added, including edges between proteins in the same
genome. This was necessary due to the inability of
CGH to accurately determine orthology. The MCL
clustering algorithm was applied to this graph using an
inflation parameter of 2.0. From this clustering, 3,744
HGs were identified, including strain-specific genes
represented as singleton clusters (Additional file 2).
Some HGs, mostly singletons, were not represented on
the array because additional genomes had been

Deng et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:500
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/500

sequenced after the array design. A total of 3,560 HGs,
represented on the array by at least one member gene,
were used for the phylogenetic analysis.
For sequenced genomes, an HG was called present if
at least one member protein of the HG aligned above
the 50% similarity threshold. For CGH genomes, an HG
was called present if at least one member gene of the
HG hybridized with PF ≥ 0.6. Results based on this
threshold were converted to a unified binary table indicating gene presence or absence for all HGs in all genomes analyzed in this study (Additional file 4). These
binary vectors were used for measuring evolutionary distance using the maximum-likelihood measure of [59],
and Neighbor-net split networks [60] and neighbor-joining trees [65] were built using the SplitsTree program
[84]. Alternative parsimony methods failed to build reasonable trees, most likely due to the large number of
incompatible splits caused by both horizontal gene
transfer and errors in the data.
PCR verification of lineage-specific genes

PCR primers were designed for 3 LI and 6 LIII specific
genes using the Primer3 software (available at http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). Colony PCR for each gene
was performed for 8 LI, 8 LII and 9 LIII strains using
the Taq Mastermix PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
PCR amplicons were confirmed by the proper size of
the DNA bands after agarose gel electrophoresis.

divergent: “0”) of phylogenetically-informative LI and LII core genes in LIII
strains were summarized in this table.
Additional file 6: Binary distribution of accessory genes in 26 L.
monocytogenes genomes. Binary distribution (i.e. present: “1"; absent or
divergent: “0”) of accessory genes in 26 L. monocytogenes genomes.
These genes were used to generate the minimal spanning trees.
Additional file 7: Minimum spanning trees that show the
distribution of accessory genes in different L. monocytogenes
lineages. A total of 576, 521 and 489 accessory genes were identified
from F2365 (LI), EGD-e (LII), and J2-071 (LIII), respectively. The binary
distribution of these accessory genes was surveyed in 28 L.
monocytogenes genomes, including 4 newly sequenced strains. Each
circle represents a group of accessory genes in F2365 (A, D, G), EGD-e (B,
E, H), or J2-071 (C, F, I) that share a unique binary distribution (i.e. “1” for
presence or “0” for absence) in all strains belonging to a specific lineage
(i.e. I, II, or III). The size of each circle is proportional to the total number
of genes that share the same binary distribution. Each circle is colorcoded based on the number of L. monocytogenes strains (from 0 to 10,
see color bar) that share the same distribution. This figure provides an
overview of the genomic diversity of the three genetic lineages from a
perspective of accessory gene presence or absence, where LIII displays
the most diversified gene content.
Additional file 8: Alignment of A118-like prophage in different L.
monocytogenes lineages. The x-axis gives the location on the EGD-e
chromosome, and for each strain, windowed alignment identity is given
on a scale of 50-100% identity on the y-axis. Strains which show no
homology to the EGD-e A118-like prophage are struck through in blue
line. Strains which do show homology to the prophage, but the
prophage is inserted somewhere other than comK, are struck through in
red line (N1-017, HCC23). This plot illustrates some interesting
phylogenetic incompatibilities. For example, based on whole-genome
analysis, the nearest phylogenetic neighbor to EGD-e is R2-561. Yet the
comK prophage in nearly all other strains appears more similar to EGD-e
than does the prophage in R2-561, which has identity < 50% for most of
its length.
Additional file 9: Probe density versus mean log intensity of the
CGH arrays. Histogram with overlaid kernel density estimation (red) of
the distribution of probe intensities for sample J1-208, showing an
optimal intensity cutoff of 8.82 at the minimum between the present
and absent modes. Displayed distribution is for the mean intensities of
the two normalized quantile replicates for strain J1-208.
