Abstract
Background: Small untranslated RNAs (sRNAs) seem to be far more abundant than previously
believed. The number of sRNAs confirmed in E. coli through various approaches is above 70, with
several hundred more sRNA candidate genes under biological validation. Although the total
number of sRNAs in any one species is still unclear, their importance in cellular processes has been
established. However, unlike protein genes, no simple feature enables the prediction of the location
of the corresponding sequences in genomes. Several approaches, of variable usefulness, to identify
genomic sequences encoding sRNA have been described in recent years.
Results: We used a combination of in silico comparative genomics and microarray-based
transcriptional profiling. This approach to screening identified ~60 intergenic regions conserved
between Sinorhizobium meliloti and related members of the alpha-proteobacteria sub-group 2. Of
these, 14 appear to correspond to novel non-coding sRNAs and three are putative peptide-coding
or 5' UTR RNAs (ORF smaller than 100 aa). The expression of each of these new small RNA genes
was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization.
Conclusion: Small non coding RNA (sra) genes can be found in the intergenic regions of alphaproteobacteria genomes. Some of these sra genes are only present in S. meliloti, sometimes in
genomic islands; homologues of others are present in related genomes including those of the
pathogens Brucella and Agrobacterium.

Background
Numerous DNA sequences giving rise to small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs or sRNAs, ranging from size 50 to 250
nt for the vast majority of them) have been found in bacterial plasmids, phages, transposons and chromosomes.

Estimates of the number of ncRNA genes in E. coli range
from 50 to several hundred [1,2]. The first ncRNAs were
detected in the 1960s by chance, discovered by direct
labelling as being associated with proteins on migration
gels or identified after random mutations. The abundance

of bacterial genome sequence data has allowed gene-finding computer programs to annotate a large number of
prokaryote sequences. However, although de novo annotation programs successfully identify and map protein-coding genes, they are not designed to identify ncRNA genes.
Recently, the intergenic regions (IGRs) of selected bacteria
and yeast genomes were systematically searched for
ncRNA genes. These computational screenings involved a
combination of criteria, including large gaps between protein-coding genes [3,4] even though in Sulfolobus solfataricus, 13 small RNAs (sRNAs) have been found encoded
either within, or overlapping, annotated open reading
frames [5]. Other criteria used are extended conservation
between species [2,4,6], orphan promoter or terminator
sequences [2,4,7], base-composition signatures [8,9], and
conserved secondary structures in deduced RNA
sequences [10-13] even if not always significant [14].
Recently, ncRNA research algorithms have been developed including some or all of these criteria [15-18]. Supplementary in vivo experiments involving for example
studies of expression patterns by Northern blotting or
microarray testing are still essential to confirm that the
sRNA candidate genes are indeed transcribed; such studies
also provide information about temporal expression patterns, potential precursor forms and degradation products. In addition to in silico analysis, experimental in vivo
RNomics were also developped (for example RACE and
SELEX) [19-21].
ncRNAs are involved in a great variety of processes including chromosome replication and cell division (dicF [22]),
transcriptional regulation (6S RNA [23]), RNA processing
(RNase P or rnpB, [24]), mRNA stability and translation
(antisense sequences such as spot42 [25]), protein stability
(tmRNA, [26]) and transport (4.5S or ffs, [27]), stress
adaptation (for example oxyS [28]), transition from
growth to stationary phase (dsrA, rprA [29,30]), quorum
sensing and virulence (qrr [31]), plasmid copy number
control (RNAI and RNAIII [32,33]), carbon storage (csrBC
[34]), and oligopeptide transport (gcvB [35]). Some provide housekeeping functions and others are regulators of
stress gene expression, e.g. sRNAs modulating the bacterial cell surface by antisensing outer membrane protein
(omp) genes (such as micF and micC, reviewed in [36,37]).
In many cases, ncRNAs are associated with proteins that
enhance their function (Hfq [38], SmpB [39]). Their
mechanisms of action can be grouped into three main categories: antisense by base-pairing with another RNA/DNA
molecule (oxyS), RNA structure mimicry (6S, tmRNA) and
catalytic functions (rnpB). These categories are not exclusive (some ncRNAs can be classified in more than one category). Also, not all mechanisms of action are known and
it is likely that some ncRNAs act in ways that have not yet
been described.

Sinorhizobium meliloti (formerly Rhizobium meliloti) is a
common Gram-negative soil bacterium that lives symbiotically on the roots of certain genera of leguminous
plants (including Medicago and Melilotus). The bacterium
enters the root tissue through infection threads and forms
nodules, inside which it converts atmospheric nitrogen
into ammonia. In return, the plant provides an energy
source for the bacteria. Excess nitrogen remains in the soil,
potentially reducing the need for fertilisers. S. meliloti is
one of the best known Rhizobia; it has been extensively
studied by numerous groups worldwide and is readily
amenable to genetic studies. Like many other members of
the alpha-proteobacteria, this fast growing Rhizobium possesses a multipartite genome: a 3.65-Mb chromosome
and two megaplasmids, pSymA (1.35 Mb) and pSymB
(1.68 Mb) [40]. Its genome shares various fundamental
similarities with those of some other symbiotic bacteria
and various plant (Agrobacterium) and animal pathogens
(Bartonella, Brucella). As for most sequenced prokaryotic
genomes, the annotation of the S. meliloti genome has led
to the prediction of protein-coding genes but yielded very
little information about non-coding RNA genes. When
the genome sequence of the S. meliloti strain 1021 was
completed [40], its RNome was only composed of three
identical rRNA operons, 54 tRNAs (53 decoding the
standard 20 aa and one selenocysteine tRNA), and a single
annotated ncRNA, ssrA (tmRNA or smc04478). The characterisation and expression patterns of this RNA gene were
recently published [41]. Two other ncRNAs are described
in dedicated databases [27,42] one matching rnpB, the
RNA component of the ubiquitous RNAse P ribonucleoprotein enzyme, and the other ffs (4.5S RNA), the RNA
constituent of the signal recognition particle (SRP).
Recent work by MacLellan with S. meliloti strain 1021 [43]
and Izquierdo with strain GR4 [44] also describes ctRNAs
(counter-transcribed-RNA) involved in plasmid incompatibility. In addition, 5' untranslated regions (UTR) of
mRNAs that act as "riboswitches" have also been predicted in S. meliloti. Those cited by the Rfam database
[45,46] sense concentrations of vitamins B2 (RFN,
upstream from ribH2) and B12 (cobalamin, upstream
from cobP, smb20056, smc00982, smc00166 and between
smb20555-smb20556), of thiamine (THI, in 5' of thiD, thiC
and smc03869) and of glycine (5' end of gcvT). Corbino et
al. [47] also describe riboswitches for methionine (SAM,
in front of metA and metZ) and serine (serC), as well as elements upstream of suhB, smc02983 (speF) and smc03839
(ybhL). No lysine, leucine, threonine or tryptophan riboswitches have been predicted in S. meliloti or in related
alpha-proteobacteria. Finally, a repression of heat shock
gene expression (ROSE) element is also annotated in the
RFAM database, in the 5' translated region of smb21295
(ibpA-like).

The purpose of this study was to discover unidentified
small RNA genes in the chromosome of S. meliloti and
related alpha-proteobacteria. We used computational
comparative genomic prediction of sRNA gene candidates
combined with expression profiling using dedicated
microarrays, followed by Northern hybridization. This
approach revealed 17 previously unidentified sRNAs,
eight of which are widely conserved in the alpha-proteobacteria phylum. These analyses suggest that, like other
free-living bacteria, alpha-proteobacteria encode numerous sRNAs, although their number and their nature may
differ between species.

Results and discussion
Profile of small RNAs in S. meliloti
Staining of total RNA from bacteria resolved on gels
reveals abundant sRNAs [48-52]. We used this method to
analyse S. meliloti small RNA (<400 nt: Figure 1A). Four
intense bands were detected, three of which correspond to
the sizes predicted for 5S RNA (band 5), 4.5S RNA (band
2), and the 5' end of tmRNA (band 4, [41]). Band 6 (≈70
nt) corresponds to a length and migration profile compatible with tRNAs. No RNAs migrating faster than 70 nt
were detected. Two less intense bands (1 and 3) were
observed and were compatible with sizes predicted for
rnpB RNA and for the 3' end of tmRNA [41]. Northern
blotting confirmed the identity of each of these bands
(Figure 1B). Surprisingly, no additional RNAs were visualized with either RNA extraction method (Trizol™ or Qiagen™, not shown) or stress (see conditions in Material and
Methods section, data not shown). This experiment indicated that small RNAS do not constitute an abundant class
of RNAs in S. meliloti, in contrast to what has been
observed in marine Cyanobacteria and in Staphylococcus
aureus [50-52]. As a consequence, we could not employ
direct elution and sequencing to identify new sRNAs [53]
in S. meliloti. We thus used computational prediction to
identify candidates for further testing.
Known sRNAs of S. meliloti: distinguishable biases?
ncRNAs in AT-rich hyperthermophiles can be located on
the basis of local variations in genomic base composition
[10,11]. Although the S. meliloti chromosome is GC-rich
(62.7%), we scanned the regions containing tmRNA, rnpB
and ffs (Figure 2) for base composition signals. Unlike ATrich genomes, no difference was observed between sRNA
and background genomic sequences (Table 1). BLAST
alignments of the three sRNAs against all sequenced bacteria revealed significant similarities with sequences from
the alpha-2 subgroup of the class Proteobacteria. However
maximum likelihood trees (see Additional file 1) showed
that most identical sequences were from different
genomes (R. etli and leguminosarum for ffs and tmRNA;
Mezorhizobium for rnpB). To conclude, no apparent dominant bias was observed for the three known S. meliloti

ncRNAs, except primary sequence conservation in IGRs of
related alpha-proteobacteria genomes (especially subgroup-2).
Selection of sRNA candidate genes in the S. meliloti
chromosome
Most bacterial sRNA searches were conducted using the E.
coli genome as a reference, so we first compiled the sRNAs
available in the Rfam database for that organism (strain
K12, riboswitch/cis-regulatory genes excluded) to try to
identify sRNA orthologs using BLAST alignments (e-value
< 1) against the complete S. meliloti chromosome
sequence. No significant similarities were detected except
for 4.5S and rnpB (see Additional file 2). ssrA (tmRNA)
was not detected, presumably because the S. meliloti
tmRNA is in a two-piece "permuted" form [41]. Surprisingly, the "ubiquitous" ssrS (6S RNA) was not detected
either. Similar analysis with Bacillus and Pseudomonas
sRNAs [RFAM] gave no further hits. This first approach

confirmed a key point: most sRNAs cannot be detected by
inter-phylum primary sequence identity.
RNA-specific tools described in the literature were then
assessed. However, most rely on preliminary structural
knowledge, knowledge which is poor for this phylum.
Thus only a subset of these tools was tested: those
reported to be able to detect new sRNA gene candidates in
prokaryotic species. ISI (Intergenic Sequence Inspector,
[54]) relies on inappropriate filters (in particular GC%),
and was far too sensitive if the filters were disabled (close
to 300 candidates). The use of QRNA [7] requires preliminary alignments. We tested it by aligning the 61 sRNAs
annotated in the E. coli (K12) genome against S. meliloti's
chromosome, but only 4.5S and rnpB were predicted by
this tool. Finally, we assessed sRNApredict2 [18], which

combines commonly sRNA-associated genetic features; it
was used to search the S. meliloti chromosome IGRs for
sRNAs, by comparison with A. tumefaciens and R. etli. As
shown in the output tables (see Additional file 3), 13
sRNAs were predicted, seven being common to the two
genomes compared. However, a detailed analysis of each
candidate revealed that only one (pred1) was likely to correspond to a genuine small RNA gene whereas the others
are almost certainly 5' UTRs (in view of the small distances and nature of the surrounding genes) or repeated
elements (RIME, Sm- [55,56]).
We ended up selecting for further analysis: the IGRs containing the origin of replication oriC (as a negative control) and the tmRNA, rnpB and 4.5S RNA genes; 22 IGRs
longer than 450 nt; 13 IGRs showing short sequence identity in alpha-proteobacteria (see Additional file 10); and
28 IGRs selected using the Artemis Comparison Tool
(ACT) with related genomes (see Additional file 11).
Indeed, the sequence identities marked by the ACT were
mostly confined to actual open reading frames (ORFs),
even between two close chromosomes (S. meliloti and A.
tumefaciens). Although hits in intergenic regions were
extremely rare (less than 40), all three S. meliloti known
sRNAs (tmRNA, 4.5S and rnpB) were included in these
hits: we thus concluded similar ACT-visualized IGRs represented good sRNA gene candidates. Among these IGRs,
those containing large repeats (Sm-1 to Sm-5) or RIMEs
were however excluded, as were IGRs smaller than 50 nt
(to avoid inclusion of 5' or 3' UTR elements).
This selection accounted for 67 candidate IGRs (see Additional file 4), which throughout this paper shall be
referred to as sra, followed by a number corresponding to
their order of apparition on the chromosome (starting
from oriC).

Detection of expression using microarrays and Northern

Microarray hybridization was the first method used to test
for transcription of the sRNA candidates; an IGR-dedicated array was used (see Materials and Methods). The initial goal of the time-course microarray experiments was to
detect ncRNA gene transcripts in various conditions. We
first monitored gene expression over time during growth

in minimal (MV) and rich (LB) media. The average log2
SNR of the three known ncRNAs (tmRNA, rnpB and 4.5S)
and the ribosomal RNA 5S (included as a control) was
very low (0.49) in MV medium, but was higher (4.13) in
LB medium (see Additional file 5). We applied various
stresses, as described in Materials and Methods, but
detected no specific induction (not shown). We therefore
used LB medium for expression analyses and the results
are expressed as a heat map (Figure 3). We also checked
the expression of all of the candidates by Northern dot
blotting. Twenty-five candidates were found to give a
strong hybridization signal (including rnpB and 4.5S RNA
genes) and nine gave weak but detectable signals. Among
the dot blot-"positive" IGRs, ten did not show significant
expression on microarrays (Fig. 3, group B1), perhaps due
to insufficient fluorescent labelling (e.g. the RNA was too
small or labelling was hampered by secondary folding).
Twenty-three IGRs gave no transcription signal either in
Northern dot blots or in microarrays (Fig. 3, group B2).
These included sra01, which corresponds to the S. meliloti
origin of replication (oriC or smc04880) and was used as
an internal negative control. Indeed, various methods
(including qPCR and blotting) have been used to demonstrate that there is no transcription at this site (not
shown). Lastly, 11 IGRs giving a transcription signal on
microarrays were not confirmed by Northern dot blotting;
in these cases the signal may have originated from surrounding coding genes.
Small RNA transcripts detected by Northern hybridization
Northern blotting was used to detect sRNAs. The same
probes as for Northern dots were used but after hybridization of newly purified RNA from fresh cultures. For some
candidates, probes were redrawn to target areas common
to all considered subgroup-2 alpha-proteobacteria. sra15
was discarded because it appears to correspond to a
pseudo phe-tRNA gene (not shown). This locus is possibly
a vestige or a target of DNA insertion; indeed, a 500-kb
symbiosis island has been shown to integrate into a phetRNA in the M. loti chromosome [57].

Four sRNA candidates (sra51, sra37, sra47, sra59) gave
large transcripts (~1000 nt, not shown), inferred to be
part of adjacent ORFs for three reasons: (i) they were
larger than the intergenic region; (ii) they were large
enough to encompass one of the flanking coding genes;
and (iii) the strand detected corresponded to the orientation of at least one of the flanking genes. We did not pursue investigations to determine whether these 5'/3' UTRs
encompass cis-regulatory RNA structures.
The signals detected for sra48, sra58 and sra62 were very
strong and composed of multiple bands (data not
shown). For sra48 and sra58, the explanation is sequencespecific hybridization of the probe to various transcripts

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/467

due to small imperfect DNA repeats (sm-2 fragment in the
case of sra58 and a previously undescribed repeat in sra48,
data not shown). The sra62 candidate corresponds to a
repeated region that coincides with the fixT loci, present in
three copies in the genome of S. meliloti [40]. In the two
first copies, fixT genes (fixT1 and fixT2) are co-located
with fixK genes (fixK1 and fixK2). The third copy region of
fixT gene (fixT3) encompasses sra62, which corresponds
to a fixK3 pseudogene (not shown).
However, it cannot be concluded that the 23 candidates
(group B2, Figure 3) for which no transcript was detected
by microarray or Northern blot experiments correspond
to false predictions: some of them may possibly be true
sRNAs, but which are poorly or not expressed in the conditions tested.
Analysis of the 17 newly identified small RNAs
We further investigated the 17 sRNA candidates that
yielded signals with a suitable size in Northern blots
(<300 nt, Figure 4A). We excluded (Table 2) sra10, that
contains a possible 101 amino acid ORF and sra29, which
is a probable leader for rpsF (S6 ribosomal protein gene)
[58,59]; we also excluded sra24 that may encode a short
peptide (38 aa long) rather rich in cysteine (10%). The 23
first aa (MALFFKPHCFLSLYCCLLSQRG...) correspond to
a predicted transmembrane segment whereas 30% of the
14 other residues are positively charged amino acids. This
biochemical configuration is found in small molecular
peptide ion channels, such as defensins, involved in hostdefences.

Of the 14 remaining RNAs, six correspond to S. melilotispecific sRNAs (called orphan sRNAs, Table 3). All except
sra61 lie within a genomic island [60] (sra14 in Smc19T;
sra11, sra12a and sra12b in Smc21T; sra66 maps at the 5'
end of Sme80s, just downstream from the insertion
tRNAser gene smc03779). All these sRNAs are absent from
Agrobacterium and other Rhizobium species, consistent
with the absence of the three genomic islands from these
related genomes. The "coding potential" of sra11, sra12a,
sra12b and sra14 was assessed and only sra66 could translate a small non-conserved 16 aa peptide. There may be a
relationship between their biological functions and their
presence in genomic islands as bacterial islands are often
related to eukaryotic host cell colonization (virulence or
symbiosis). Indeed bacterial sRNAs were recently detected
in the pathogenicity island of Staphylococcus [51] and in
Salmonella (InvR [36]). Multiple 5' and 3' RACE mapping
of these candidates was unsuccessful, possibly due to
insufficient cDNA or because they are too small for satisfactory cloning. With no available orthologous sequences,
determination of extremities through alignment and
structure prediction based on covariations are not possible. The functions of these new non-coding genes are thus

post-transcritptional regulators via base-pairing action, so
we used TargetRNA [61] to assess their capacity to act as
antisense RNAs. No significant putative target was found
for sra11, sra12a, sra14 or sra61, but sra12b and sra66

match with mRNA targets (see Additional file 12). One
interesting TargetRNA prediction was the interaction
between sra66 and a tolR-exbD-like gene (smc03957).
TolR-ExbD proteins are membrane-bound transport proteins essential for ferric ion uptake in bacteria [62], and

small RNAs modulating the free intracellular iron pool
have indeed been identified in other bacteria (e.g RyhB,
[63]).
In E. coli, sRNA genes were considered to be conserved if
the alignment had an E-value lower than 0.001 [64]. On
this basis, the sequences of the eight remaining expressed
S. meliloti sra genes are highly conserved in related alphaproteobacteria (e-value < 10-10; Table 4). sra56 is even an
analog of Escherichia coli's 6S RNA (SsrS) that has recently
been corroborated by RFAM. sra56 may thus be considered as a fortuitous positive control, validating our experimental approach. All these conserved sra genes we
describe were then subjected to transcriptional element
analysis, structure prediction using covariation, and
potential mRNA target prediction.
Genomic synteny for alpha-proteobacteria sra genes
S. meliloti chromosomal sRNA-encoding genes have a
slight distribution preference, 70% of them being on the
left replicore, but no preference was observed concerning
the leading or the lagging strand (Figure 4B). The conservation of gene adjacency (synteny) may be associated with
functional relationships (e.g. gcvB and ssrA are functionally associated to their conserved adjacent genes, respectively gcvA and smpB) [35,65]. Therefore, we assessed the

conservation of neighbouring genes for the eleven alphaproteobacterial sra, including tmRNA, rnpB and 4.5S (see
Additional files 10 and 11). We found only three (4.5S,
tmRNA and sra41) where both flanking genes were conserved and four with one conserved flanking gene (including rnpB). Three display no synteny (including sra56 =
6S). However, our observations suggest that in alpha-proteobacteria, functional association between sRNAs and
conserved adjacent genes is uncertain, as even smpB is not
linked to tmRNA (separated by 1,1 Mb).
Conserved sra gene transcriptional signals
The computational identification of promoter sequences
is difficult because signals are weak [4]. Consensus binding sites have been proposed for the S. meliloti σ70 and σ54dependent promoters (CTTAGAC-n17-CTATAT [66] and
TGGCACG-n4-TTGCW [67], respectively). Using relaxed
regular expressions (i.e. pattern matching), we scanned
the 5' UTR region of each sra gene to detect any such consensus (max. 4 mismatches). In the same way than for the
orphan candidates, the end-mapping experiments
remained unsuccessful for all new candidates but sra32 (5'
end-AAACAGGCAGGAA and 3' end-CTTGTTTTTTT), thus
the exact sites of the extremities of the sra genes are
unknown. However, sequence alignment between several
alpha-proteobacteria was informative. As for ORFS, no

significant nucleotide identities were apparent in the 5'
and 3' regions (not shown). Thus, the start and stop of the
alignment and the sizes deduced from electrophoretic
motility were used to define the ends of each sra gene. We
only detected consensus σ70-promoters in the ubiquitous
ncRNAs (ffs, tmRNA, rnpB and 6S) and the 5'-UTR
mapped region of sra32 (Table 5). Even with a larger
spacer between the -35 and -10 boxes (17 to 20), no consensus sequence was detected in the other sra genes. Similarly, only the ffs 5'-UTR matches a possible σ54 binding
site. However, S. meliloti contains a large number of predicted sigma-factors (ca. 16), it is therefore possible that
sra genes are dependent on them. Unfortunately, Melinabased [68] motif extraction from the promoter regions of
these genes was inconclusive and did not show any consensus.
We also looked for potential classical L-shaped terminators (stable stem-loops followed by U-stretches) at the
alignment-deduced 3' end of each sra. As most terminators in GC-rich bacteria have no long consecutive Ustretches [69], we also looked for I-shaped (stable stemloop with no U-stretch) and V-shaped (two consecutive
hairpins [69]) terminators (Table 6). Terminator structures could be predicted for all conserved sra genes, except
sra30 and sra34, for which the alignments are too short for
the ends to be accurately mapped. All three shapes were
found, I-shapes being the most common. This supports
the proposal that "orphan" terminators in IGRs may indicate the presence of an sra gene, although because of the
high GC content of the S. meliloti genome, stable stemloops are frequent and consequently not very informative.

Conserved sra genes predicted structure and mRNA
targets
The structures of non-coding RNAs are important for their
function. Consequently, we made a conserved secondary
structure prediction for all alpha-proteobacteria sra genes
(except sra30 and sra34 because of too short alignments).

We first compared the 4.5S and 6S Alifold [70,71] and
RNAz [72], outputs with the equivalent RFAM structure
(Additional file 13). The two tools give different structures
for 4.5S, the Alifold prediction being closer to that of
RFAM than the RNAz prediction. However, bulge A, the
minimal site required for binding to EF-G [73], is similarly folded in the three models. The three predicted structures of sra56 (6S) are similar, 6S being folded as a largely
double-stranded RNA with a single-stranded central
bulge. However, the 3' side of the central bulge can form
a stable stem-loop in alpha-proteobacteria, as previously
described [74].
The predicted structure of sra03 is well-conserved, composed of three long hairpins: the central one, ending with
a 15 nt loop, is strictly conserved, and the 3' and 5' stemloop structures present co-varying nucleotides. Analogous
design (three stem-loops) was found for the E. coli sRNAs
drsA, micC and qrr [46]. No significant target mRNA was
found using the full RNA but the 15-nt loop presents complementarity with the 5'-UTR of the smc03977-smc03976
operon (not shown). These two genes have paralogs,
mostly in alpha-proteobacteria genomes. The function of
Smc03977 is unknown but Smc03976 belongs to the
ZapA cell division family of proteins [75]. ZapA binds the

sra41

sra25 was only identified in Rhizobia (meliloti, etli and
leguminosarum), however with remarkable primary
sequence identity. Its predicted secondary structure is also
highly conserved, composed of a long stem with one central bulge and a small hairpin. The 3' end structure was
predicted to act as a stabilization terminator. A possible
pairing with the 5' UTR of a gene encoding a putative
membrane protease protein (Smc04020) was proposed
by TargetRNA, although with low significance (p-value >
10-3). This protein resembles the E. coli HflKC protein,
known to interact with the cell division protease FtsH
[76]. As for sra03, we propose that sra25 may have a role
in the S. meliloti cell cycle.
Only Alifold proposed a consensus structure for sra33: it
resembles other short bacterial sRNAs including RyeE
[46]. Predictions for sra33 showed strong pairing ability
with the 5' ends of smc00899 and of rkpJ. The first gene is
organized in an operon structure with smc00900 (encoding a PilT-like toxin), defining a post-segregational killing
toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. This type of mechanism,
involving sRNAs in the inhibition of TA systems, has been
extensively described in E. coli [77]. Finding such a mechanism in S. meliloti is interesting as we recently detected
approximately 53 TA loci (accounting for 95 genes) in the
complete genome sequence [78].
sra32 is the only small RNA predicted both by
sRNApredict2 and ACT analysis. For this gene, hybridization was tested by Northern blot and a signal was
obtained for two of the most distant members: A. tumefaciens (140 nt) and R. elti (132 nt) (Figure 5A and 5B). The
secondary structures of sra32 were predicted by both Alifold and RNAz; 59% of the nucleotides can pair in seven

conserved regions, those at the 3' and 5' ends (TB1 and
TB7) possibly forming stabilization stem-loops. Only the
primary sequence of TB3 is conserved, all other structures
being supported by covariations. The search for potential
mRNA targets yielded significant predictions for fliM
(flagellar motor switch) and smc01800 (cytochrome C
oxidase). The same sequence of sra32 (nt 60 to 95, TB4 to
TB6) is predicted to pair with the 5' leader region of both
mRNA targets. Discovery of a putative flagella antisense
RNA in S. meliloti and related bacteria is interesting.
Indeed, all these bacteria interact with plant or mammal
cells and flagella are cell-surface components required for
eukaryotic-prokaryotic cells interactions [37].
Finally, structure and target prediction of sra41 needed
preliminary analysis as (i) two signals were detected by
Northern hybridization (a major ~106 nt band and a
minor ~68 nt species) and (ii) sra41 is present in three
imperfect copies, two in tandem in the same chromosomal IGR and the third, with a more divergent primary
sequence, maps in pSymA. Additionally, sra41 is well-conserved in alpha-proteobacteria and is present in two to
three copies, on both chromosomes and (mega-)plasmids
except in Agrobacterium (chromosomal loci only). Translatable small ORFs are predicted within some sra41 candidates (see Additional file 6) whereas others are devoid of
complete coding frames. A similar conserved structure
was proposed for the three S. meliloti copies, composed of
three stem-loops as described for sra03. Target mRNAs
were predicted separately for each of the three sra41 copies

in S. meliloti. The only predicted target for the first chromosomal copy is smc02392, which encodes a hypothetical
protein with a Sel1 repeat-containing domain. The second
copy is predicted to interact with two mRNAs encoding
Smc00317, a transmembrane protein with homologies to
efflux carrier proteins, and Smc01118, a glucoproteaselike protein possibly involved in chaperoning processes.
No significant target was predicted for the pSymA copy.

Conclusion
We used computational comparative genomic screening
to search for small RNA genes in S. meliloti and related
alpha-proteobacteria, as very few sRNAs had been identified in this phylum [46]. From a list of 64 S. meliloti candidate IGRs (excluding tmRNA, 4.5S and rnpB), we show
that 17 encode small RNAs (14 non-coding RNAs, two
small mRNAs and a 5' leader region). This work constitutes a significant advance in small RNAs studies in alphaproteobacteria.
A possible antisense function was suggested for 57% of
the sra genes, although these predictions remain based on
TargetRNA estimations. To validate these antisense activities, further in vitro validation of predicted target genes
will be necessary, even if TargetRNA's e-value was set to a
highly significant threshold (see material and methods
section). It is however interesting to notice that the functions of the predicted mRNA targets are various, including
roles in transport, membranes and toxin-antitoxin systems. However, antisense RNAs may act on transcription

termination, translation, mRNA degradation and can be
activators and/or repressors. As a consequence, accurate in
silico prediction of sra functions is difficult. The specific
physiological roles of these newly discovered genes in
alpha-proteobacteria regulatory pathways can only be
determined by biological investigation. The initial regulation of each sra gene, i.e. the precise signalling conditions
that trigger their expression should be analyzed, as this
may give us clues about their roles. Monitoring the expression of each sra under various conditions would require
numerous experiments, as many parameters can be
changed alone or simultaneously to simulate oxidative,
heat, cold, and osmotic stresses as well as nutrient and
metal starvation. In E. coli, Hfq generally facilitates the
pairing of ncRNAs [79]. Therefore the influence of the S.
meliloti hfq homolog (nrfA or smc01048) in the sra-target
mRNAs hybrid formation could be analyzed by constructing a mutant. In parallel, screening should be extended to
additional replicons (megaplasmids and plasmids): we
show that sequence conservation in closely related bacteria IGRs can indicate the presence of putative small sra
genes.

Methods
Bacterial growth
In all experiments, S. meliloti strain 1021 (streptomycin
resistant, StrR) was grown at 30°C in the presence of 25
μg.ml-1 of streptomycin. Bacteria were initially grown to
the stationary phase in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium, collected, washed and then resuspended in MV (Vincent

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:467

minimal medium, 1970 [80]) or LB medium. Stresses
were applied in MV at mid-exponential phase (OD600
nm = 0.4) as follows: 10 minutes with a sub-lethal dose of
hydrogen peroxide (10 mM); salt shock (0,4 M NaCl), pH
5 and pH 9 generated with 10 N HCl or NaOH were also
applied during 10 minutes; cold (10°C) and heat shocks
(40°C) lasted 15 minutes. The other alpha-proteobacteria
used in Northern blot and sequencing experiments are
listed in Additional file 7.
RNA purification and DNase treatment
Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min, 2600 × g,
room temperature) and immediately frozen at -80°C.
These pellets were subsequently re-suspended in 200 μl of
TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8 – 1 mM EDTA) containing lysozyme (1 mg.ml-1) and total RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen™) and treated with
RQ1 Rnase free DNase (1 U.μg-1, GE Healthcare) in the
presence of 6 mM of MgCl2 for 20 min at 37°C.
5' and 3' RACE mapping
RNAs shorter than 300 nt were eluted from a 2.5% highresolution agarose gel (Sigma) in 0.5 × TBE buffer [81]
and used to build a cDNA library using the MessageAmpII-Bacteria kit (Ambion). The RNAs were 3' endpolyadenylated and first strands were synthesized using
oligo-T7-dT (AATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAA dT25)
then treated overnight at 37°C with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the presence of 1 mM of dTTP. The
second strands were obtained with a 5'-primer
(GGAATACTAGTGACACCAGACAAGTTG dA15). PCR
was carried out at 55°C using 1 μl of the cDNAs and 4
pmoles of the appropriate specific primers (see Additional
file 8): one corresponding to the targeted gene and the
other specific to either the 5' or 3' tagged ends. The products obtained were inserted into pGEM-T (Promega) and
sequenced using the BigDye terminator v3 protocol
(Applied Biosystems). RNA genes of interest were amplified by PCR with a 50°C to 40°C touch-down program,
using the 5' and 3' end primers designed after mapping,
from 12 genomic DNA preparations from several Rhizobia (see Additional file 8). The resulting products were
sequenced using the protocol described above and analyzed in silico for co-variation and conserved secondary
structure.
Northern dot analysis
DNase-treated, S. meliloti total RNA (10 μg per dot) was
denatured (by incubating for 10 min at 70°C then chilling
on ice) and spotted under vacuum onto a nylon membrane (Zeta Probe) using Bio-Dot (Bio-rad). These dot
membranes were baked for 30 min at 80°C, pre-hybridized, hybridized and washed according to Ambion's
instructions (Oligoprobes), and hybridization was visualized on InstantImager (Packard). 20-mer oligonucleotides

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/467

(see Additional File 3) were 5' P-end labelled with
[gamma32P]ATP. For each candidate, two oligonucleotide
probes (one per strand) were selected to identify the
strand of transcription. Aliquots of 62 pmoles of each oligonucleotide probe were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with
1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase, 2.5 μl of 10 × kinase
buffer (Ambion) and 2 μl of 32P-ATP [5,550 KBq (222,000
KBq.mmol-1)]. The radiolabelled probes were then purified through MicroSpin G25 columns (GE Healthcare).
The efficiency of probe labelling was monitored in a liquid scintillation analyser (1600 TR Packard).
Northern blot analysis
S. meliloti was grown in LB medium to mid-exponential
phase (OD600 nm= 0.8). Total RNA (10 μg) was extracted,
denatured, and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% acrylamide/bis acrylamide (19:1) denaturing gel (8 M urea)
in 0.5 × TBE buffer [81]. The RNA was then transferred to
a nylon membrane (Ambion) in the same buffer and the
membrane was baked for 30 min at 80°C. Biotinylated
oligoprobes were used for hybridization and bound
probes were detected according to Ambion's instructions
(BrightStar® BioDetect™).
Construction of the DNA microarrays
A PCR-based microarray was designed (see Additional file
9) with primer3-designated oligonucleotides derived
from the 67 IGRs (intergenic empty regions) identified by
screening (see Additional File 4). Seventy bp were
excluded at the 5' and 3' ends of each IGR to avoid expression contamination by adjacent genes. The IGRs with
lengths >550 nt were amplified as more than one PCR
fragment. Each PCR involved 200 ng of S. meliloti 1021
genomic DNA, 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase
(Promega) and 4 pmol of each oligonucleotide in a final
volume of 50 ml for 40 cycles (Peltier Thermal Cycler, MJ
Research Inc). The PCR buffer contained 5 μl MgCl2 (25
mM), 1 × Taq buffer (Promega) and 4.3 μl dNTPs. The
length and quality of each PCR product was assessed by
electrophoresis on 2% agarose TBE (Tris-Borate EDTA 0.5
× final) gels. The IGRs-PCR probes were dried, resuspended in 30 μl betaine, 1.5 M-3 × SSC and spotted in
triplicate onto GAPS II™-coated glass slides (Corning)
through robotic arraying (Microgrid II, BioRobotics).
Microarray hybridization, data acquisition and statistical
analysis
The labelled cDNA was resuspended in hybridization
buffer (3 × SSC/0.1% SDS/50% formamide) and cohybridized with 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA to the microarray glass slides overnight at 55°C. The slides were
washed for 5 min at 55°C in wash buffer (2 × SSC/0.1%
SDS) then 2 min in high-stringency buffer (0.2 × SSC/
0.1% SDS, twice), 2 min in 0.2 × SSC (twice) and 2 min
in 0.1 × SSC, and dried by centrifugation (3 min, 210 g).

Hybridized
microarray
slides
were
scanned
(GenePix4000, Axon Instruments, Inc.) with independent
excitation of the fluorophores Cy5 and Cy3 at 10-μm resolution. Our microarray time series experiment was
planned with a dye-swap design; Dabney & Storey
recently showed that a simple average dye-swap removes
dye bias without affecting the biological signal and preserves the ordering of true expression means [82]. To
determine if ncRNA candidates showed detectable expression as assessed by microarray analysis, we used log2 SNR
(signal to noise ratios), the "noise" value being the average intensity of spots containing spotting buffer. All genes
with log2 SNR lower than 2 (a signal less than 4-fold
greater than the technological noise) were considered as
untranscribed under the conditions tested and their value
changed to 0 (filtering). The resulting expression profiles
are illustrated as a heat map.
Bioinformatics
Intergenic regions (IGRs) were determined as genome
areas with no gene annotation on either of the two
strands. The S. meliloti database used [83] includes original annotations of all ORFs, as well as tRNA, rRNA and
repetitive elements. The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT
[84]) from the Sanger Centre [85] was used for whole
genome comparisons of IGRs between the S. meliloti chromosome, as the reference, and other alpha-proteobacteria
genomes: Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 Cereon,
Rhizobium etli CFN42, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. vicae
3841 and Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/467

genomes were used: Agrobacterium tumefaciens str. C58
and Rhizobium etli CFN 42. Consequently, two blast output files were generated, where S. meliloti intergenic
regions were compared to the cited genomes using WU
BLAST 2.0 with same parameters as Livny [18] (E = 10e-5,
V = 10000 et B = 10000). Finally, databases of regions of
predicted conserved secondary structure were produced
using QRNA, again with parameters set to the same values
as in [18]. No input files corresponding to RNAMotif
search results or to promoter/transcription binding sites
were provided to sRNAPredict.
TargetRNA [61] was used (default parameters) to identify
sra candidates' mRNA targets. Potential base pair binding
interactions were considered significant only if their Pvalue fell below 0.001. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by ClustalW [90] and resulting multiple alignments
were used in ALIFOLD [71] to model RNA secondary
structures. Similar predictions were realized using the
RNAz program [72].

Authors' contributions
VU and AC conceived the design and use of the microarrays and performed the isolation and blotting of the
RNAs. AC performed 5'-3' RACE and sequencing of sra32
candidates in Rhizobiales. ES and FBH performed the bioinformatic analyses and IGRs annotation. FBH designed
and coordinated all aspects of the project. All authors read
and approved the final manuscript.

Additional material
ISI [54] was used taking the initial embl record file corresponding to the S. meliloti chromosome (AL591688) as an
input, and applying an IGR length threshold of 7 bp.
Parameter 'w' in BLAST was set to 7 in order to refine word
detection.
In order to produce the input alignment file for QRNA
v.2.0.3.c [7], the 61 ncRNAs annotated in the E. coli K12
Refseq file (NC_000913) were extracted, and compared to
the chromosomal IGRs of S. meliloti thanks to WU BLAST
2.0, with various e-value thresholds (10-5, 10-2, 0.1 and
default: 10). QRNA was then run with scanning window
set to 100 nt.
sRNAPredict2 [18] was tested using the S. meliloti chromosome ORF list (NC_003047.ptt) from the Refseq repository [86]. The ".coords" TIGR file is unavailable for S.
meliloti. The t/rRNA database was compiled from data in
the TIGR_CMR RNA list [87] and from the S. meliloti
sequencing consortium website [83]. The terminator database was derived from TransTerm [88,89]. The S. meliloti
sRNA training set was generated from data available at the
corresponding RFAM database page [46]. Two reference
