Abstract
Background: Since proteins perform their functions by interacting with one another and with
other biomolecules, reconstructing a map of the protein-protein interactions of a cell,
experimentally or computationally, is an important first step toward understanding cellular function
and machinery of a proteome. Solely derived from the Gene Ontology (GO), we have defined an
effective method of reconstructing a yeast protein interaction network by measuring relative
specificity similarity (RSS) between two GO terms.
Description: Based on the RSS method, here, we introduce a predicted Saccharomyces proteinprotein interaction database called SPIDer. It houses a gold standard positive dataset (GSP) with
high confidence level that covered 79.2% of the high-quality interaction dataset. Our predicted
protein-protein interaction network reconstructed from the GSPs consists of 92 257 interactions
among 3600 proteins, and forms 23 connected components. It also provides general links to
connect predicted protein-protein interactions with three other databases, DIP, BIND and MIPS.
An Internet-based interface provides users with fast and convenient access to protein-protein
interactions based on various search features (searching by protein information, GO term
information or sequence similarity). In addition, the RSS value of two GO terms in the same
ontology, and the inter-member interactions in a list of proteins of interest or in a protein complex
could be retrieved. Furthermore, the database presents a user-friendly graphical interface which is
created dynamically for visualizing an interaction sub-network. The database is accessible at http://
cmb.bnu.edu.cn/SPIDer/index.html.
Conclusion: SPIDer is a public database server for protein-protein interactions based on the yeast
genome. It provides a variety of search options and graphical visualization of an interaction
network. In particular, it will be very useful for the study of inter-member interactions among a list
of proteins, especially the protein complex. In addition, based on the predicted interaction dataset,
researchers could analyze the whole interaction network and associate the network topology with
gene/protein properties based on a global or local topology view.

Background
Protein-protein interactions play a key role in many biological processes and therefore, are increasingly forming
the focus of studies in understanding protein function
and cellular behaviour [1,2]. Genome-scale protein interaction networks have now been determined experimentally for several model organisms [3-12]. However, these
interaction datasets are often incomplete and noisy
[13,14]. Therefore, several in silico interaction predictions
have been designed as complementary to existing experimental approaches, which are derived from gene context
analysis, such as gene neighbourhood, gene fusion events,
phylogenetic profiles and correlated mRNA expression
patterns. Detailed reviews of these methods can be found
elsewhere [15,16]. Currently, the interaction predictions
have been improved by integrating different genomic features based on a single probabilistic framework in yeast
[17,18] and human [19].
Originating from the Gene Ontology (GO), which organizes biological information for molecular function (MF),
biological process (BP) and cellular component (CC) for
different model organisms [20], we have defined a new
metric of relative specificity similarity (RSS) to predict the
functional association of two proteins [21]. Using both
CC and BP ontologies and their respective annotations
from Organelle DB [22], we derived a gold standard positive (GSP) dataset with the highest confidence of RSS values and then reconstructed a protein-protein interaction
network [21]. A schematic explanation of the prediction
of interaction network is shown in Figure 1.
Using our computational method, we have now developed a web-accessible database, Saccharomyces Proteinprotein Interaction Database (SPIDer). This database contains the predicted yeast protein-protein interaction dataset, which is based on a new release of GO and the
annotations derived from SGD [23]. Moreover, it provides
users with a graphical interface to visualize an interaction
sub-network for a list of proteins of interest.
Construction and content
We used the MySQL database system and Perl scripting
language to develop and implement our database. The
graphical view of network was designed using the Graphviz tool [24]. Our server runs on the Linux operating system. The content of the database is as follows.
GSP dataset
SPIDer houses the data for yeast protein-protein interactions (GSP dataset) solely derived from the GO and yeast
annotations by measuring RSS between two GO terms at
the genome level (Figure 1 and Ref [21]). In previous
work, we used the September 2004 release of GO and
yeast annotations from Organelle DB [22] to obtain a GSP

dataset, which covers 78% of the integrated high-quality
interaction dataset (valid experimental interactions) [21].
Here, we used the March 2006 release of the GO and yeast
protein annotations downloaded from SGD submitted on
March 31, 2006. The derived GSP dataset is proved to
have a high confidence level, as it covers 79.2% of the
high-quality interaction dataset which was used in the
previous work [21]. The current GSP dataset consists of 92
257 interactions encompassing 3600 proteins, and the
reconstructed interaction network forms 23 connected
components, out of which the largest contains 3527 proteins and 92 084 interactions.
A detailed help page explaining the contents of the database is available online at the website.
Cross references to other databases
SPIDer provides general links to connect predicted protein-protein interactions with four other related datasets
derived from three databases, namely, DIP [25], BIND
[26] and MIPS [27]. Both DIP (the release of April 2, 2006
was used here) and BIND (the release of May 21, 2005)
are important databases that contain information on protein-protein interactions. MIPS provides all annotated
and genome-scale protein interactions (the release of January 18, 2005), and also compiles data on protein complexes (the release of June 20, 2005), which are converted
to binary interactions using the matrix model. As a result,
there are 15 296 interactions in GSPs that have at least one
connection to the four datasets, out of which 2951, 1431,
1135 and 14 452 interactions in our database have cross
references to DIP, BIND, MIPS binary interactions and
MIPS complexes, respectively.
Utility
Datasets in SPIDer can be accessed through a variety of
search features.

(i) Searching by protein information: given an SGD [28]
identifier, a group of interactors of the query protein is
returned. The interaction table is designed to be clickable
and thus directs users to more detailed information, such
as cross references to other databases, and hyperlinks to
the pages with evidence information retrieved from the
datasets we integrated. Before visualizing the network of
queried interactions dynamically, two filtering criteria –
the RSS score cutoff with default 0.85 and interaction step
with default 1 – can be set to navigate the final graphical
display of the network. No result to any given query may
be due to the absence of the query protein from the GSP
dataset. This search option also allows users to specify a
keyword of standard gene name, open reading frame
(ORF) name or protein description and to retrieve a list of
SGD entries that match the keyword. Then, one or multiple proteins of interest can be selected and used in turn as

steps: (1) Using both CC and BP ontologies and their respective annotations, the distributions of protein pairs with various RSS
values for the two ontologies were obtained. (2) Then a Z-score analysis was applied to draw the statistical significance of the
quality scoring system and the nine data segments with different combinations of confidences were obtained. (3) To evaluate
the RSS method, an integrated high-quality interaction dataset was applied. Based on a Z-score analysis, a positive dataset and a
negative dataset were selected. Moreover, a gold standard positive (GSP) dataset with the highest level of confidence and a
gold standard negative (GSN) dataset with the lowest level of confidence were derived. (4) Finally, a yeast protein-protein
interaction network was reconstructed from the GSP dataset. The RSS method, a new metric for semantic similarity to score
the degree of the functional association between two different proteins by comparing the relative specificity of pairs of GO
terms assigned to them in similarity within a GO DAG [21].

the query for the SCF-CDC4 complex (search by inputting the MIPS identifier '445.10'). The table of cross-member interactions has the following information: the information for two interacting proteins, their RSS values on the three ontologies (CC,
BP and MF), the cross references to other binary interaction datasets (DIP, BIND and MIPS physical interactions) and the MIPS
complexes, as well as the hyperlinks to the evidence information. This table is designed to be clickable and provides hyperlinks
of the proteins to SGD. Both DIP binary interactions and MIPS complexes have links to their home pages. (B) A graphical representation of the inter-member interaction network of the SCF-CDC4 complex using the default score cutoff. Nodes and
edges represent proteins and cross-member interactions, respectively. Each node is labeled standard gene name. Each edge is
depicted in colour representing the RSS score, which is the minimum of the BP and CC RSS values. In addition, the ORF name
and primary SGD identifier are obtained when the cursor is positioned over a node, and score value over an edge (an example
of the interaction between CDC34 and SKP1 is shown). Five different scores of edges in the legend are depicted in five colours.

tion sub-network, facilitating users to associate the network topology with gene/protein properties based on a
global or local topology view.

Availability and requirements
(ii) Searching by GO term information: by entering a GO
term identifier or a keyword of the term description, users
can retrieve a list of proteins annotated on the term(s).

The database is freely accessed on the internet [29]. The
complete gold standard positive dataset is on request by
contacting with the corresponding author.

(iii) Retrieving the RSS value of two GO terms in the same
ontology by entering their identifiers. This option allows
users to access the maximum RSS value computed
between the two GO terms.

List of abbreviations used

(iv) Browsing inter-member interactions by entering a
MIPS complex identifier or a list of proteins: we provide
users with a search facility to extract the inter-member
interactions of a list of proteins of interest. It allows inputting a MIPS complex identifier, and also a list of gene
names, ORF names or SGD identifiers either by simply
pasting them into the text box, or by uploading a plain file
where proteins are separated by a space or a newline. For
example, in order to identify the topology of SCF-CDC4
complex (MIPS identifier 445.10; containing five members), the identifier is entered. Figure 2 shows the search
results and a graphical view of the sub-network of the
complex.
(v) Searching by sequence similarity: this search feature
facilitates users to retrieve protein sequences matching a
query sequence or its fragment. The results are returned as
a list of proteins ordered by the BLAST e-value.

Discussion
The yeast protein-protein interaction dataset will continue
to be updated using the new release of GO and yeast
annotations in SGD. Furthermore, in the future, we
intend that our database will provide more detailed analysis results of the whole interaction network, which are
useful in analyzing and understanding yeast proteome.
We also expect to reconstruct the maps of interactions
from other completely sequenced genomes with highquality GO-based annotations for functional genomic
research.

Conclusion
SPIDer is an open and public database server for proteinprotein interactions which are solely derived from the
Gene Ontology (GO), based on the yeast genome. It provides users with convenient access to protein interactions
based on various search features. In particular, it allows
users to analyze the potential inter-member interactions
among a list of proteins of interest, which is especially
useful for the analysis of protein complexes. Furthermore,
it presents a graphical interface for visualizing an interac-
