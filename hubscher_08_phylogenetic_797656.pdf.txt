Abstract
Background: The bacterial cell wall is the target of many antibiotics and cell envelope constituents
are critical to host-pathogen interactions. To combat resistance development and virulence, a
detailed knowledge of the individual factors involved is essential. Members of the LytR-CpsA-Psr
family of cell envelope-associated attenuators are relevant for β-lactam resistance, biofilm
formation, and stress tolerance, and they are suggested to play a role in cell wall maintenance.
However, their precise function is still unknown. This study addresses the occurrence as well as
sequence-based characteristics of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins.
Results: A comprehensive list of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins was established, and their phylogenetic
distribution and clustering into subgroups was determined. LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins were present
in all Gram-positive organisms, except for the cell wall-deficient Mollicutes and one strain of the
Clostridiales. In contrast, the majority of Gram-negatives did not contain LytR-CpsA-Psr family
members. Despite high sequence divergence, the LytR-CpsA-Psr domains of different subclusters
shared a highly similar, predicted mixed a/β-structure, and conserved charged residues. PhoA
fusion experiments, using MsrR of Staphylococcus aureus, confirmed membrane topology
predictions and extracellular location of its LytR-CpsA-Psr domain.
Conclusion: The LytR-CpsA-Psr domain is unique to bacteria. The presence of diverse subgroups
within the LytR-CpsA-Psr family might indicate functional differences, and could explain variations
in phenotypes of respective mutants reported. The identified conserved structural elements and
amino acids are likely to be important for the function of the domain and will help to guide future
studies of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins.

Background
The cell envelope forms a protective shield around bacteria and is also the site of primary host-pathogen interactions. Its composition and surface characteristics are

therefore important in pathogenesis, and may, in view of
increasing resistance against all commonly used cell walldirected antibiotics, present novel potential antibacterial
targets.

The LytR-CpsA-Psr family of cell envelope-associated transcriptional attenuators has been brought into focus of scientific interest upon the discovery that members of this
family influence various virulence factors as well as antibiotic resistance of important human pathogens and,
interestingly, seem to play a role in bacterial cell envelope
maintenance [1-5]. Therefore, this protein family represents a promising target to gain more insight into virulence and antibiotic resistance development.
The LytR-CpsA-Psr family members are putative transmembrane proteins carrying a so-called LytR-CpsA-Psr
domain, which is predicted to be extracellular. LytR was
first described in Bacillus subtilis, where it acts as an attenuator of the expression of both itself and the divergently
transcribed lytABC operon, which encodes a putative lipoprotein (LytA), an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase
(LytC) and its modifier LytB [3]. CpsA is suggested to play
a role in transcription activation of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon of Streptococcus agalactiae [2]. Psr
was initially proposed to be a repressor of penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) synthesis in Enterococcus hirae [6],
however, Sapunaric et al. could neither confirm an effect
on PBP5 synthesis nor autolysis nor β-lactam resistance
[7]. In contrast, the LytR homolog BrpA affects autolytic
activity of Streptococcus mutans [1] and positively influences biofilm formation ability as well as acidic and oxidative stress tolerance [5]. Furthermore, BrpA inactivation
alters phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the outcome of bacteremia in a rat model [8]. In
Staphylococcus aureus, the LytR-CpsA-Psr member MsrR
contributes to β-lactam resistance [4]. MsrR of S. aureus as
well as Psr of Enterococcus faecalis were both shown to
increase virulence in the model host Caenorhabditis elegans
[9,10]. Furthermore, expression of SA0908, another member of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family in S. aureus, is increased
during infection in a murine renal abscess model [11].
The function of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain, however, is
still unknown and so far information about these proteins
is based on phenotypic characterizations. A more comprehensive knowledge about the occurrence of LytR-CpsA-Psr
proteins and analyses of their sequence will provide a
basis for experimental determination of interactions or
structure/function relationships.
In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins and analyzed secondary structure predictions. In addition, the
staphylococcal LytR-CpsA-Psr protein MsrR was used as a
model to confirm membrane topology.

Results and discussion
Sequence collection of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins
A comprehensive sequence collection was obtained by
searching the InterPro database [12] for LytR-CpsA-Psr

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/617

members (InterPro entry IPR004474) and using PSIBLAST [13] to identify further homologous sequences as
described in the Methods section. Sequences representing
fragments of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain were excluded
from the studies. The revised dataset comprised 1'079
sequences.
Occurrence of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain
Members of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family were found in the
eight bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae (Figure 1). In addition, a LytRCpsA-Psr fragment was identified in Plesiocystis pacifica
strain SIR-1, which is a member of the δ-Proteobacteria.

The LytR-CpsA-Psr domain is restricted to the kingdom of
bacteria with two exceptions occurring in the moss Physcomitrella patens subsp. patens (Bryophyta, Moss Superclass
V) and the freshwater amoeba Paulinella chromatophora.
Physcomitrella is widely used as a model organism in plant
genetics as it undergoes integrative homologous recombination with a high efficiency [14], while Paulinella contains photosynthetic inclusions (chromatophores)
affiliated with the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus spp. [15]. BLAST analysis of the LytR-CpsA-Psr
sequences found in Paulinella and Physcomitrella revealed
high similarities to those found in Synechococcus sp.
WH5701 and Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2, respectively (data
not shown). It is therefore conceivable that the LytRCpsA-Psr proteins found in Physcomitrella and Paulinella
are of bacterial origin.
Analysis of the genomes available at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [16] revealed that
all of the completely sequenced Firmicutes contain at least
one member of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family, except for
Clostridium kluyveri strain DSM 555 and the whole order of
Mollicutes. In the phylum of Actinobacteria, LytR-CpsA-Psr
proteins were found in every completely sequenced
genome and the same was true for Deinococcus-Thermus,
Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae. In contrast, only two strains
of the Bacteroidetes, i.e. Pedobacter sp. BAL39 (Sphingobacteriales) and Bacteroides capillosus ATCC 29799 (Bacteroidales) harbor LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins, but none of the
completely sequenced strains. Among the Chloroflexi, the
Dehalococcoides do not possess LytR-CpsA-Psr members,
whereas they were found in the orders Chloroflexales and
Herpetosiphonales. Most of the Cyanobacteria genomes contain LytR-CpsA-Psr members, but only two out of twelve
Prochlorococcus marinus genomes.
Characteristics of LytR-CpsA-Psr carriers
The organisms having LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins represent
the immense diversity of bacteria with regard to morphology, ultrastructure, motility, metabolic characteristics, and
habitat preferences. LytR-CpsA-Psr family members were

Overview of the occurrence of LytR-CpsA-Psr family proteins in bacteria
Overview of the occurrence of LytR-CpsA-Psr family proteins in bacteria. The phylogenetic tree is based on the
interactive tree of life (iTOL) [65], which was pruned to a selection of genera representing the different phyla. The eight phyla,
where LytR-CpsA-Psr family proteins were found, are printed in bold, and red circles indicate their presence in the respective
genera. In case not all members of a certain genus harbor LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins, the circle was put in brackets. For a comprehensive description of the occurrence of LytR-CpsA-Psr domain refer to the text. 1)A single fragment of a LytR-CpsA-Psr
protein was detected in the δ-Proteobacterium Plesiocystis pacifica strain SIR-1. 2)Except for the Dehalococcoides, which are representing the phylum of the Chloroflexi in this tree, all members of the Chloroflexi contain LytR-CpsA-Psr family members.

found in pathogens of human, animals, or plants as well
as in non-pathogenic organisms, in generalists and specialists such as hyperthermophilic bacteria. This heterogeneity raises the question: Is there a common trait to the
LytR-CpsA-Psr carriers? One of the most striking observations was that the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins are absent in the

large Gram-negative phylum of Proteobacteria and many
other Gram-negative groups, while all of the Gram-positive bacteria contain at least one copy. Given the proposed
role of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins in cell envelope maintenance and the lack of the respective domain in the cell
wall-deficient order Mollicutes, this finding might indicate

a correlation with the Gram-positive cell wall in particular. However, the list of LytR-CpsA-Psr carriers also comprised Spirochaetes and numerous organisms classified as
Gram-negatives, such as members of the Cyanobacteria,
Thermus, Thermotogae, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi.
Nevertheless, many of the Gram-negative LytR-CpsA-Psr
carriers show features of a typical Gram-positive cell wall,
such as a thick, multilayered peptidoglycan, a high crosslinking extent, or polysaccharides cross-linked to the peptidoglycan. Intermediate types between a typical Gramnegative and Gram-positive cell wall are for example
observed in various Cyanobacteria [17], Chloroflexus aurantiacus [18], and Deinococcus radiodurans [19]. In conclusion, however, a common feature related to peptidoglycan
composition or amount was not apparent.
Loss and gain of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins in the course of evolution
The LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins described so far are not essential, and viable knock out mutants were obtained in S.
aureus, S. mutans, and E. hirae [1,4,7]. These particular
organisms, however, contain more than one member of
the LytR-CpsA-Psr family. It would be interesting to know
if the inactivation of all LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins affects viability. On the other hand, our sequence collection showed
that this protein family was lost in certain organisms in
the course of evolution. As mentioned above, only two
Prochlorococcus strains carry LytR-CpsA-Psr members. The
respective strains, MIT9303 and MIT9313, are distinct
from other Prochlorococcus isolates in that the size and GC
content of their genomes are more similar to those of the
genus Synechococcus [20]. The differences in genome size
reflect gene gain and loss during the evolution of Prochlorococcus, which lost the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins after divergence from the MIT9303/MIT9313 clade. Interestingly,
besides the LytR-CpsA-Psr members, numerous genes that
are present in MIT9303/MIT9313 and most Synechococcus,
but absent in the other completely sequenced Prochlorococcus, are involved in cell envelope biogenesis [20]. Apart
from Prochlorococcus, C. kluyveri is likely to be another
example for the loss of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins. C. kluyveri
differs from other members of the genus Clostridium by
unique metabolic features and its genome shows only
very low syntheny on protein level to other Clostridia [21].

The occurrence of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family in the Thermotogae, which are considered an evolutionary early branch
of bacteria [22], might indicate that this family already
appeared in a common procaryotic ancestor and was lost
by some lineages during the process of diversification, e.g.
in the Proteobacteria. From this point of view, the incidence in P. pacifica SIR-1 could be the result of lateral gene
transfer. However, the GC content of the LytR-CpsA-Psr
protein encoding gene and the GC content of P. pacifica
SIR-1 do not differ and a more thorough investigation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/617

would be required to address this question. Yet, lateral
gene transfer plays a significant role in evolution [23], and
it is possible that LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins were (re-)
acquired in the time course of procaryotic diversification.
Cluster analysis
Our sequence collection revealed that from one, e.g. in C.
tetani, to eleven, e.g. in Streptomyces coelicolor, any number
of LytR-CpsA-Psr members could be found in a single species. In order to investigate if there existed sub-families
and a particular distribution, we performed a cluster analysis based on pair-wise sequence similarities resulting
from a BLAST all against all search using CLANS [24] with
a P-value cut off of 10-35.

The results mainly reflected taxonomic relationships.
Accordingly, the clusters were termed using the first character(s) of the respective phylum followed by consecutive
numbers in case of multiple clusters. The majority of
sequences grouped in six clusters, i.e. A1 (Actinobacteria
cluster 1), Ch (Chloroflexi cluster), F1–F3 (Firmicutes clusters 1 to 3), and M (taxonomically mixed cluster) (Figure
2 and Additional file 1). Besides these main clusters, seven
'peripheric' clusters containing four to 18 proteins were
observed: A2, A3, Cy (Cyanobacteria cluster), F4, F5, S (Spirochaetes cluster), and T (Thermotogae cluster). In addition,
five sequences of the Deinococcus-Thermus group that were
found in close proximity to each other were considered an
additional cluster D. A small number of proteins did not
cluster with any other of the LytR-CpsA-Psr members.
A step-wise increase in the P-value cut off caused the clusters A1, Ch, F1, F2, and M to merge in a supercluster (data
not shown), suggesting a close relationship of the
enclosed sequences. Decreasing the P-value cut off
resulted in disconnection of the clusters into subclusters
mainly following phylogenetic affiliations (data not
shown). To verify whether unequal family sizes or redundant sequences distorted cluster analysis, CLANS was subsequently applied to a reduced dataset of 576 sequences
with a maximum similarity of 90%. The use of this
reduced dataset had no significant effect on the outcome
of the clustering (data not shown) and the following discussion is based on the results obtained using the unfiltered list of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins.
Cluster M – taxonomically mixed central cluster
Cluster M was the only one containing proteins of organisms belonging to various phyla, i.e. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria,
Bacteroidetes,
Deinococcus-Thermus,
and
Cyanobacteria, and might represent those sequences that
have diverged the least from a presumed ancestral LytRCpsA-Psr protein. A clearly separated subcluster (Ma) contained exclusively sequences of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus species as well as of the amoeba Paulinella.

Two-dimensional CLANS clustering of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins
Two-dimensional CLANS clustering of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins. Proteins are represented by dots and colored
according to their taxonomic relationship: blue, Actinobacteria; olive, Bacteroidetes; green, Cyanobacteria; yellow, Chloroflexi; turquoise, Deinococcus-Thermus; red, Firmicutes; dark green, Physcomitrella; brown, Plesiocystis; pink, Spirochaetes; petrol, Thermotogae. BLAST sequence similarities are indicated by lines shaded from light grey (P-values < 10-35) to black (P-values < 10-200).
Clusters are indicated using the first character(s) of the corresponding phylum and are numbered in case there is more than
one cluster of the same phylum. M denotes the taxonomically mixed 'central' cluster. Subclusters within A1, F1, and M are
marked with small letters.

Cluster A1 – common Actinobacteria sequences
Most LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins of the high GC Gram-positive organisms grouped in cluster A1. A1-type sequences
were identified in each member of the Actinobacteria and
therefore represent the sequences characteristic for this
phylum. The proteins of this cluster were predominantly
predicted to have a single transmembrane segment with
an extracellular LytR-CpsA-Psr domain, a trait attributed
to the majority of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins.

Within cluster A1, three separated subclusters were distinguished. Subcluster A1a enclosed solely sequences of different Mycobacterium species, whereas A1b and A1c both
covered sequences of various Actinobacteria.
Cluster A1 also harboured FrnA [UniProt:O68907], which
contains an SBP_bac5 domain (bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 5 domain; PFAM:PF00496).
The family 5 solute-binding proteins comprise peptidebinding proteins, such as the oligopeptide transporter

subunit OppA of Gram-negative bacteria. FrnA was exclusively found in Streptomyces roseofulvus, and is encoded by
the first gene of a 25 kb-region, containing genes involved
in biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic frenolicin
[25]. In Saccharopolyspora erythraea, two A1-type proteins,
SACE_6482 and SACE_6483, are encoded adjacent to aveBII (SACE_6480), a dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase
involved in the biosynthesis of a polyketide sugar unit
precursor and hence of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A [26]. However, any involvement of LytR-CpsAPsr proteins in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by
organisms of the order Actinomycetales remains open.
Cluster A2 – Actinobacteria proteins with multiple transmembrane
segments
A few LytR-CpsA-Psr family members of the Actinobacteria
clustered in A2. In contrast to the A1-type proteins and the
LytR-CpsA-Psr family members in general, those proteins
found in A2 were calculated to cross the membrane two to
four times. In accordance with predictions for LytR-CpsA-

Page 5 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:617

Psr members with one transmembrane helix and independently of the number of predicted transmembrane
helices, the LytR-CpsA-Psr domains of A2-type proteins
were mainly suggested to be extracellular by the various
programs used. A2-type proteins were only present in
some organisms of the Propionibacterineae, Streptosporangineae, and Micrococcineae.
Cluster A3 – Streptomyces-specific proteins
This cluster contained four sequences, which are rich in
glycine and the polar amino acid glutamine predominantly located within a stretched, uncharged segment
close to the N-terminus. The A3-type proteins also differ
from other LytR-CpsA-Psr members by their exceptional
length ranging from 559 to 617 aa and were only found in
Streptomyces.
Cluster F1 – Psr/MsrR-like proteins of Firmicutes
Apart from those sequences comprised in cluster M, the
Firmicutes sequences divided into three main clusters F1–
F3 and two peripheric clusters F4 and F5. Cluster F1 contained proteins of the orders Bacillales and Lactobacillales
(subcluster F1a) as well as of Clostridiales and the two nonFirmicutes Pedobacter sp. (phylum Bacteroidetes) and Fervidobacterium nodosum (phylum Thermotogae) (subcluster
F1b).

F1-type proteins included Psr of enterococci, which is suggested to be an activator of its own transcription, especially in the presence of ampicillin [27]. In the food-borne
pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, transcription of psr is
increased in response to growth at 10°C [28]. Cluster F1
also included MsrR of Staphylococcus aureus, which is
involved in β-lactam resistance [4]. msrR belongs to the
cell wall stress stimulon, a set of genes collectively
induced upon exposure to antibiotics damaging the cell
wall [29,30].
Cluster F2 – LytR/BrpA-like proteins of Firmicutes
Cluster F2 mainly contained sequences of the orders Bacillales and Lactobacillales and included LytR of B. subtilis and
BrpA of S. mutans. BrpA has an impact on autolysis, biofilm formation, stress tolerance, and virulence [1,5], and
LytR acts as an attenuator of the lytABC operon encoding
the major autolytic amidase of B. subtilis [3]. LytR belongs
to the σX regulon, which controls genes participating in
cell envelope metabolism and modulation [31,32]. YwtF,
a further F2-type protein in B. subtilis, is a member of the
σM regulon. The σM regulon plays a role in response to cell
envelope stress, and in contrast to lytR, ywtF gene expression is upregulated by bacitracin and vancomycin [33-35].
A similar situation as in B. subtilis was observed for transcription of lytR and ywtF in B. licheniformis [36]. The two
F2-type LytR-CpsA-Psr members of S. aureus, SA0908 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/617

SA2103 in strain N315, both belong to the cell wall stress
stimulon as does msrR of cluster F1 [30,37,38].
In Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis strain 407-1,
the F2-type LytR-CpsA-Psr protein EcfY is thought to be
encoded in an operon with sigW (similar to extracytoplasmic function σ factor) and ecfX (putative anti-σ factor).
sigW and ecfX contribute to β-exotoxin production, and
ecfY was proposed to be involved in negative control of
sigW expression [39].
In cluster F2, a LytR-CpsA-Psr protein with a type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase superfamily domain (PAP2,
PFAM:PF01569) was contained, which is encoded by E.
faecalis EF_3245. Certain PAP2 family members have
undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity, and
thus may play a role in peptidoglycan biosynthesis by providing the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate [40,41].
Moreover, the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein of the eukaryote
Physcomitrella also clustered in F2.
The staphylococcal protein LytR (SA0251 in strain N315),
the response regulator of the two-component system
LytSR [42], does not belong to the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein
family despite its name.
Cluster F3 – CpsA-like Firmicutes proteins with multiple
transmembrane segments
The third Firmicutes cluster was formed by the CpsA-like
proteins, which are predominantly found in the genus
Streptococcus. In streptococci, cpsA (also cpsX, epsA, wzg) is
the first gene of the capsular biosynthesis locus, and CpsA
is assumed to be a transcriptional regulator of capsule production in S. agalactiae [2]. In S. pneumoniae, however,
although encapsulation is reduced in a cpsA mutant, no
evidence for an effect of CpsA on transcription of the cps
operon was found [43]. Yet, the mutant exhibited reduced
tyrosine phosphorylation of CpsD, which is thought to be
required for production of elevated amounts of capsule
[43].

All F3-type proteins were predicted to have three transmembrane helices with an intracellular N-terminus. Additionally, CpsA and related proteins of streptococci possess
a DNA polymerase processivity factor domain (DNA-PPF,
PFAM:PF02916), a subdomain of the replisome sliding
clamp unit. However, the subunits of the sliding clamp
ring are composed of two homologous subdomains, the
DNA-PPF domain and a gp45-slide C subdomain
(PFAM:PF09116) [44], which is absent in CpsA. Moreover, in CpsA the DNA-PPF domain was predicted to span
the third putative membrane segment with the major portion of the domain located extracellularly. These findings
imply that the DNA-PPF domain found in CpsA proteins
fulfils a different function. The extracellular portion of the

Page 6 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:617

CpsA DNA-PPF domain overlaps with a structural periplasmic binding protein-like II domain (SCOP superfamily 53850) as identified using SCOP (Structural
Classification Of Proteins) [45]. This superfamily includes
various binding proteins such as phosphate-binding proteins, glutamine-binding proteins, or ferric-binding proteins. Interestingly, SCOP superfamily 53850 also covers
the family 5 solute-binding proteins discussed with
respect to the A1-type LytR-CpsA-Psr protein FrnA.
A number of proteins of the Clostridiales also clustered in
F3. Although these proteins did not produce a significant
hit to the DNA-PPF domain in a PFAM search, they were
of similar length as CpsA (456–559 amino acids), and
four of them [UniProt:A5KKW2, A8RE01, A8R906, and
B1C5F5) were also predicted to carry a periplasmic binding protein-like II domain.
Clusters F4 and F5 – small 'peripheric' Firmicutes subclusters
Cluster F4 only contained sequences of Lactococcus lactis
and Streptococcus thermophilus, whereas F5 only contained
sequences of certain Clostridiales. The F4- and F5-type
sequences showed the same transmembrane organization, and family domain architecture as those of the Firmicutes main clusters F1 and F2.
Clusters Ch, Cy, D, S and T – other taxonomy-specific clusters
The sequences of the Chloroflexi grouped in one single
cluster (Ch) closely related to M, and all LytR-CpsA-Psr
members of Thermotoga and one of the two members
found in F. nodosum assembled in the Thermotogae cluster
T. Cluster D comprised those Deinococcus-Thermus
sequences not included in cluster M. Cluster Cy enclosed
a set of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus sequences, and
finally the LytR-CpsA-Psr members of the Spirochaetes Borrelia were grouped in cluster S. The sequences of the other
Spirochaetes, i.e. Leptospira and Treponema, were not
included in any cluster.

All sequences enclosed in these clusters showed for the
LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins a characteristic organization with
a short cytoplasmic domain, one transmembrane segment, and a putative extracellular domain carrying the
LytR-CpsA-Psr element.
Phylogenetic distribution
For a more detailed analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins, 30 fully sequenced
strains representing the six phyla Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and
Thermotogae were selected (Additional file 2). Figure 3
summarizes the number of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins
detected in these strains and the results of the CLANS clustering related to the species tree, which was constructed
based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/617

Comparison of the genome sizes and the number of LytRCpsA-Psr members in the respective organisms revealed a
positive correlation (Figure 4). There were, however,
exceptions like Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 with a genome size of
7.2 Mb but only two LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins.
The accumulation of multiple LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins
most probably often happened through duplication from
an ancestral species- or group-specific sequence, leading
to as many as 11 members in S. coelicolor. Ten of the S. coelicolor LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins clustered in A1, while the
eleventh [UniProt:Q9RDK8] clustered in A3. In contrast
to Q9RDK8, all genes of the ten A1-type proteins lie
within the central core region of the S. coelicolor genome,
and seven of the LytR-CpsA-Psr genes are consecutively
encoded. The core region of S. coelicolor comprises genes
likely to be essential, such as genes involved in cell division, DNA replication, transcription, translation, and
amino acid biosynthesis [46].
Gene duplication might also have happened in an ancestor of the Deinococcus-Thermus group, which is likely to
have carried two members of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family:
one of the M cluster-type and a more differentiated, phylum-specific one. Both of these LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins
have been retained in all of the fully sequenced organisms
of this taxon.
An identical distribution of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins was
found in the genus Staphylococcus and Listeria, which share
one member in the MsrR/Psr-like cluster F1 and two
members in the LytR/BrpA-like cluster F2. Only Staphylococcus haemolyticus encodes a fourth LytR-CpsA-Psr protein, CapM, which clusters in F2 and is the last gene of a
putative capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus capAcapM. capA-capG show ≥ 76% amino acid identity to the
cap5[8]A-cap5[8]G genes of S. aureus, while capH-capM
are unique to S. haemolyticus and might be of exogenous
origin [47]. The three LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins common to
staphylococci and listeria most likely were present in an
evolutionary older organism before their phylogenetic
separation, however, the cluster analysis leaves the phylogeny of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins in general open, and
a hypothesis that cluster M represents the most original
group remains speculative.
In order to infer evolutionary relatedness of the LytRCpsA-Psr proteins represented by the 30 strains selected,
phylogenetic trees were constructed. However, the LytRCpsA-Psr proteins show only low amino acid identity and
the domain characterizing this family is only about 150
amino acids in length (average value of the respective 93
sequences), rendering construction of phylogenetic trees
problematic. Reliable bootstrap support was only
obtained close to the terminal nodes, though the results of

Distribution of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins in selected genomes
Distribution of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins in selected genomes. The distribution of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family members
was investigated in 30 fully sequenced bacterial strains. Phylogenetic relationships are shown by means of a species tree based
on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. The NCBI RefSeq database accession numbers and the sizes of the genomes (total of all
DNA molecules) in mega bases (Mb) are indicated. The number of LytR-CpsA-Psr family members (LCP) identified in the corresponding genome are given and the last column summarizes in which CLANS cluster they were found as follows: 'denotation
of the cluster':'number of proteins'. A number without an indication of a cluster means that this sequence did not group with
any other sequences.

the cluster analyses were supported (Additional file 3),
reflecting taxonomic relationships as shown in the 16S
rRNA gene tree in Figure 3.
Secondary structure prediction
A subset of twelve sequences representing the LytR-CpsAPsr proteins of clusters M, A1, F1, F2, F3, Ch, and T was
subjected to secondary structure prediction. The
sequences analyzed included the three eponymous proteins LytR, CpsA, and Psr, as well as other family members
that have been described in literature, i.e. BrpA, MsrR, and
SA0908. The sequences varied in length from 293 to 485
amino acids and they showed very different contents of
charged amino acids and theoretical isoelectric points (pI)
ranging from 5.17 to 9.66 (Additional file 4). All

sequences contained one consensus transmembrane
region predicted by all of the four servers used, except for
CpsA, which was predicted to have three transmembrane
helices. The majority of the membrane topology predictions suggested an intracellular N-terminus, implicating
an extracellular location of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain.
The putative cytoplasmic tails of eight sequences were very
short ranging from only six to 19 amino acids while
CE2746 of C. efficiens [UniProt:Q8FLW3] showed a long
cytoplasmic domain of 121–123 amino acids. A graphical
overview of the respective architectures, illustrating also
variations in the length of the extracellular domains, is
given in Figure 5. The overall identities of the amino acid

CpsA-Psr proteins
Relationship of the genome size to the number of LytRRelationship of the genome size to the number of
LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins. With an increasing genome size
generally an increased number of LytR-CpsA-Psr family
members was found in the 30 strains investigated. The coefficient of correlation was 0.621, indicating an intermediate
positive correlation, which is illustrated by the linear regression line (red).

sequences were only between 17 and 39% (Additional file
5).
There was a good overlap of the predicted structural elements within the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain and its flanking
regions (extended LytR-CpsA-Psr domain), revealing a
mixed a/β-structure (Figure 6). Secondary structure predictions have to be interpreted with caution and only
experimental resolution will allow accurate interpretation
of structure-function relationships. However, preliminary
circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purified and
refolded extracellular domain of MsrR of S. aureus support
predicted α-helix and β-sheet contents (L. Lüthy, unpublished).
The amino acid identities of the extended LytR-CpsA-Psr
domains ranged from 21 to 44% (Additional file 5) and
were hence only little above those of the full length proteins. Interestingly, the few fully conserved residues
included nine charged amino acids: aspartic acid,
arginine, and lysine. Charged residues are often involved
in the active site of proteins, where they interact with
charged ligands or bind substrates. Moreover, they may
play a role in formation of protein-protein complexes and
are important for folding, stability, and solubilization of
proteins [48]. It is therefore very likely that at least some
of the conserved residues are indispensable for the function of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain in these proteins.
High sequence divergence was observed with regard to
some of the peripheric clusters, e.g. the Spirochaetes cluster
S. Although the secondary structure predictions mainly

showed a for LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins typical domain organization with a short N-terminal tail, a single transmembrane
domain (red), and a long C-terminal part carrying the LytRCpsA-Psr domain (light blue). An exception of this architecture is found in the group of CpsA-like proteins, represented
by CpsX of S. agalactiae (Q3K0S7_STRA1), which contain
three predicted transmembrane helices and a DNA polymerase processivity factor domain (orange) in addition to the

agreed with those of the other LytR-CpsA-Psr members,
there was a very weak conservation of amino acids (data
not shown), possibly indicating a different function.
Confirmation of membrane topology
The predicted membrane topology of the LytR-CpsA-Psr
proteins was verified by PhoA fusions using the staphylococcal protein MsrR as a representative of the protein family. The amino acid sequence of MsrR is identical in twelve
of the 14 sequenced S. aureus strains available on the
NCBI website [16] and there is only one amino acid difference in strains Mu50 and Mu3, which both have lysine
at position 146 instead of glutamic acid (Additional files
5 and 6). For the following analyses, the sequence represented by S. aureus strain N315 was employed (see also
Additional file 4).
PhoA fusions and activity assay
Five different PhoA fusion proteins were constructed, with
MsrR lacking either 0, 80, 147, 246, or 295 amino acids
from the C-terminus (full length, Δ80, Δ147, Δ246, and
Δ295) (Figure 7A), and were expressed in the phoA- E. coli

strain CC118. Correct folding of PhoA relies on the formation of disulfide bonds and occurs in the periplasm
only. Therefore, PhoA activity can only be measured if the
fusion protein spans the membrane in a suitable orientation. The fusions of PhoA to the full length protein and to

MsrR truncated by 80, 147, and 246 amino acids from the
C-terminus led to significant PhoA activity, indicating that
PhoA had been translocated to the periplasmic space (Figure 7B), however, there were large variations in activity
between the different fusion constructs. The highest activ-

Page 10 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:617

ity was reached when PhoA was fused to MsrR shortly after
the transmembrane domain (Δ246), whereas the fusions
towards the C-terminus (Δ147, Δ80, and full length)
showed lower activities. Western blot hybridization using
α-PhoA antibodies revealed partial degradation of the
Δ147, Δ80, and full length fusion constructs, which likely
accounts for the observed differences in PhoA activity
(Figure 7C). In contrast, one strong, single band of the
expected size was detected for the Δ246 as well as for the
Δ295 fusion constructs. The Δ295 fusion lacks the transmembrane domain and did not yield PhoA activity above
the threshold value, indicating that the fusion construct
remained in the cytoplasm.
These findings confirmed the predicted arrangement of
the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein MsrR in the membrane: The
short N-terminal tail is located inside of the cell and is followed by one transmembrane helix and an extracellular
domain carrying the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain. Most members of the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein family show very similar
predicted architectures as MsrR.

Conclusion
Members of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family are known to influence clinically important attributes of various pathogens
[2,4,5]. The LytR-CpsA-Psr domain was found to be
restricted to the kingdom of bacteria. Being present in
hyperthermophilic organisms of evolutionary early
branches, the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins appear to constitute
an ancient protein family. All Gram-positive organisms
were found to possess LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins, except for
the Mollicutes that seem to have lost this protein family in
the course of diversification. In contrast, the LytR-CpsAPsr domain was only observed in a minority of the Gramnegatives, and it is conceivable that the LytR-CpsA-Psr
proteins were lost in Proteobacteria and Chlamydiae as well
as in most of the Bacteroidetes during evolution. LytRCpsA-Psr proteins are shared by the most diverse procaryotic phyla, including the thermophiles of the first bacterial branches, and the genes encoding LytR-CpsA-Psr
proteins often belong to the core genome. Although these
proteins do not appear to be essential, they presumably
confer a selective advantage to their carriers, as becomes
apparent in vitro when mutant cells are challenged with
antibiotic, acidic, or oxidative stress [4,5].
The finding that various members of this protein family
are part of the cell wall stress stimulon in different organisms [30,33-38] might further suggest a role in ensuring
cell envelope integrity. Nevertheless, the specific functions
of the LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins are probably more diverse
than originally anticipated, as indicated by the results of
the cluster analysis, explaining discrepancies in phenotypes of knock out mutants [1-4,7].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/617

Our analyses of the occurrence and distribution of the
LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins as well as the determination of
putative structural elements and conserved amino acids of
the family-specific domain will provide a guideline for the
design of future experiments to elucidate structure-function relationships.

Methods
Sequence collection
As of August 20, 2008, accession numbers of LytR-CpsAPsr protein family members included in the InterPro database (InterPro entry IPR004474), a consortium of the
member databases PROSITE, Pfam, Prints, ProDom,
SMART, and TIGRFAMs [12], were obtained. Homologues
sequences not present in InterPro were identified by PSIBLAST [13] against the NCBI non-redundant protein
sequence database (nr) using MsrR of S. aureus strain
N315 [UniProt:Q99Q02] as a query and an E-value
threshold of 10-4. Amino acid sequences were retrieved
from UniProt [49] or from NCBI [16].
Cluster analysis
To identify closely related sequences within the LytRCpsA-Psr members, CLANS (CLuster ANalyis of
Sequences) was used [24]. For two-dimensional visualization of pairwise sequence similarities, based on P-values
of high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) resulting from a
BLAST all against all search, the P-value cut off was set to
10-35 and the attraction (attract) and repulsion (repuls)
exponents were set to 2. Network-based clustering was
applied to assist designation of clusters.
Structure analysis
Sequence compositions and theoretical pI were analyzed
using ProtParam [50]. Transmembrane regions were predicted using TMHMM [51], the "DAS"-Transmembrane
Prediction server [52], TMpred [53], and HMMTOP [54].
Secondary structures were predicted using SsPro [55],
PSIPRED [56], and Jpred [57].
Amino acid sequence alignments
Amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.6 [58] and protein identity matrices of the MUSCLE
alignments were calculated using ClustalX 2.1 [59].
Phylogenetic trees
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using programs of the
PHYLIP 3.67 package [60]. For construction of a species
tree, aligned 16S rRNA genes were downloaded from the
ribosomal RNA database RDP-II [61]. Misaligned characters were manually edited using SeaView version 2.2 [62].
The C- and N-termini were trimmed and gap-only sites
were deleted from the alignment. A distance matrix, computed with DNADIST using the F84 model of nucleotide
substitution, was used for construction of a distance tree

bands corresponding to the expected size were detected (marked by an asterisk): 52.6 kDa (1), 58.0 kDa (2), 69.3 kDa (3),
76.9 kDa (4), and 85.5 kDa (5). In the lanes containing constructs number 3–5, several smaller bands were present, which most
probably represent degradation products.

trees, bootstrap resampling was performed using SEQBOOT. Consensus distance trees were generated using
PROTDIST with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution
matrix, NEIGHBOR, and CONSENSE. Phylogenetic trees
were drawn with Dendroscope version 1.2.4 [63].
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table
1. Bacteria were maintained at 37°C on Luria Bertani (LB)
(Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin or on sheep-blood
agar plates.
PhoA fusion constructs
PCR products covering different lengths of msrR of S.
aureus strain Newman were generated using the forward
primer 5'-GCGCCTCGAGATGGATAAAGAAACTAATGA3' and the following reverse primers: 5'-GCGCGGTACCTCTTCATCTAAAAAGTCTTT-3' (full length), 5'GCGCGGTACCGTTCTAAAATTAACCATTTC-3' (Deletion

Recognition sites of restriction endonucleases are underlined. The amplicons were digested using XhoI and KpnI
and inserted into pHA-1 downstream of the araB arabinose-inducible promoter and upstream of the phoA gene
lacking both the 5' segment coding for the signal sequence
and the first five residues of the mature protein. The resulting plasmids were transferred into the phoA- E. coli strain
CC118.

Expression of PhoA fusion proteins and PhoA activity assay
Overnight cultures of E. coli strain CC118 harboring the
msrR-phoA fusion constructs of interest were diluted 1:100
in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown
to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. Bacterial cultures
were then divided into halves: in one half, protein expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose, while the other
half was left untreated. After growth for an additional
hour, 1 ml of induced and non-induced cells, respectively,
were harvested for determination of PhoA activity by a pnitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma-Aldrich) cleavage
assay [64]. In addition, 200 μl of each cell suspension
were collected for verification of PhoA fusion protein
expression by Western blot using an α-PhoA antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Abcam Ltd.,
UK).
Western blot analysis
Whole cells were heated for 5 min at 65°C in 5× SDS loading buffer supplemented with 0.05% N-lauroylsarcosyl
and subjected to SDS-12%-PAGE. Separated proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (HybondECL; Amersham Biosciences), and for detection of PhoA,
a HRP-conjugated α-PhoA antibody (Abcam) diluted
1:100'000 and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce) were used.

at position 146 of MsrR of S. aureus Mu50 and Mu3 is indicated by a
red box. The LytR-CpsA-Psr domain as defined in the PFAM database
(PF03816) is shaded in grey, and conserved residues as determined in
Figure 6 are highlighted in blue. Residues of the predicted transmembrane
regions are printed in red. Sequences are labelled using UniProt entry
names. STAS1, S. saprophyticus ATCC15305; STAAN, S. aureus
N315; STAAM, S. aureus Mu50; STAES, S. epidermidis ATCC12228;
STAHJ, S. haemolyticus JCSC1435.

Neighbour-joining tree of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed based on a MUSCLE alignment of the full length
sequences. Bootstrap values only support the branching order towards the
terminal nodes and deeper branches have to be considered unresolved (red
values). Using solely the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain for the initial alignment,
changing parameters, e.g. for calculation of the distance matrix, or applying another tree construction algorithm did not improve the results (data
not shown). The UniProt entry names are given, and the subtrees are
colored using the same color scheme as in Figures 2 and 3 (blue, Actinobacteria; green, Cyanobacteria; yellow, Chloroflexi; turquoise, Deinococcus-Thermus; red, Firmicutes; petrol, Thermotogae). Brackets
indicate the corresponding CLANS clusters.

Primary sequence analyses of LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins and results of
transmembrane region prediction. The primary sequences of the full
length proteins as well as of the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain as defined in the
PFAM database (PF03816) were analyzed using ProtParam. Transmembrane segments were predicted using the web-based servers TMHMM,
TMpred, Das, and HMMTOP. The first and the last residue of the predicted transmembrane domains are indicated.
