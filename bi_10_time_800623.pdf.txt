Time and time again: unisexual salamanders
(genus Ambystoma) are the oldest unisexual
vertebrates
Ke Bi1,2, James P Bogart1*

Abstract
Background: The age of unisexual salamanders of the genus Ambystoma is contentious. Recent and ancient
evolutionary histories of unisexual Ambystoma were proposed by a few separate studies that constructed
phylogenies using mitochondrial DNA markers (cytochrome b gene vs. non-coding region). In contrast to other
studies showing that unisexual Ambystoma represent the most ancient unisexual vertebrates, a recent study by
Robertson et al. suggests that this lineage has a very recent origin of less than 25,000 years ago.
Results: We re-examined the phylogenetic relationship of the unisexuals to A. barbouri from various populations
using both mitochondrial markers as well as the complete mitochondrial genomes of A. barbouri and a unisexual
individual from Kentucky. Lineage dating was conducted using BEAST and MultiDivTime on a complete
mitochondrial genome phylogeny. Our results support a monophyletic lineage for unisexual Ambystoma that
shares its most recent common ancestor with an A. barbouri lineage from western Kentucky. In contrast to the
Robertson et al.’s study, no A. barbouri individual shared an identical or almost identical cytochrome b haplotype
with any unisexual. Molecular dating supports an early Pliocene origin for the unisexual linage (~5 million years
ago). We propose that a unisexual-like cytochrome b numt (or pseudogene) exists in the controversial A. barbouri
individuals from Kentucky, which was likely the cause of an erroneous phylogeny and time estimate in Robertson
et al.’s study.
Conclusion: We reject a recent origin of unisexual Ambystoma and provide strong evidence that unisexual
Ambystoma are the most ancient unisexual vertebrates known to exist. The likely presence of an ancient
cytochrome b numt in some Kentucky A. barbouri represents a molecular “fossil” reinforcing the hypothesis that
these individuals are some of the closest extant relatives to unisexual Ambystoma.

Background
Because of the absence of sex, a brief evolutionary lifespan is generally expected for unisexual and asexual
organisms [1]. Nevertheless, ancient unisexuals and
asexuals that persist millions of years have been discovered in various taxa among plants, fungi and animals
[2]. With recent advances in molecular genetics and
phylogenetics, our knowledge of reproductive systems
and evolutionary histories of many unisexual and asexual lineages has been quickly improved. Recent evidence
reveals that many unisexuals are capable of utilizing

modified reproductive modes and/or mitotic or meiotic
mechanisms to incorporate “a bit of sex” [3-7], or they
can incorporate additional genetic material to compensate for the suspected lethal effects caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations [7-10]. Thus,
although populations may be all female, unisexual are
not necessarily equivalent to asexual populations [5].
The discovery of ancient unisexual and asexual lineages
not only poses a dilemma for evolutionary theoreticians
but also provides an opportunity to address questions
that relate to the prevalence and maintenance of sexual
reproduction.
Unisexuality in vertebrates has been discovered in
about 90 lineages of fresh water fish, amphibians and
reptiles [11], most of which are recently spun off from

sexual relatives via interspecific hybridization [7,12].
North American unisexual mole salamanders of the
genus Ambystoma co-evolve with five distinct sexual
ambystomatids (A. laterale, A. jeffersonianum, A. tigrinum, A. texanum, and A. barbouri) across the entire
unisexual distribution [9,13-15]. Unisexual Ambystoma
persist as a “parasitic entity” by stealing and incorporating sperm from sympatric sexual species via a complex
reproductive mode, kleptogenesis, to generate nearly 30
genomic combinations or biotypes, with ploidy levels
ranging from diploid to pentaploid [5,15]. Genomes in
unisexuals may not be transmitted unaltered. Recent
studies using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH)
demonstrate complex intergenomic exchanges in unisexual populations [4,16-18].
Despite the complexity of their nuclear genomes, all
unisexuals contain a highly conserved mitochondrial
genome which is derived from A. barbouri, suggesting
that A. barbouri may be the maternal ancestor of the
unisexual lineage [5,9,19]. Although the ancestry of unisexual Ambystoma is not contested by these studies, the
age of the unisexual lineage is controversial. Unisexual
Ambystoma have been proposed as the most ancient
unisexual vertebrates known to exist [5,20,21]. Based on
a phylogeny constructed by the mitochondrial intergenic
spacer and control region (mitochondrial non-coding
region or NCR), Bogart et al. [5] estimated that the unisexual lineage and the closest relatives, an A. barbouri
lineage from Kentucky, are descended from the most
recent common ancestor 2.4-3.9 million years ago (Ma).
Their results are based on the observation of a 3.91%
pairwise difference in the control region between unisexuals and a few Kentucky A. barbouri individuals. On
the contrary, Robertson et al. [19] constructed a phylogeny using a different mitochondrial marker cytochrome
b (cyt-b) gene and suggested that unisexual Ambystoma
have a very recent origin which could be less than
25,000 years ago. Strikingly, they found a few A. barbouri specimens that were also used by Bogart et al. [5]
to have an identical or almost identical cyt-b haplotype
to unisexual individuals. Such a large discrepancy is difficult to understand because the two different mitochondrial DNA markers (NCR vs. cyt-b) that came from the
same A. barbouri individuals demonstrated distinctly
different evolutionary relationships to the unisexual lineage (~3.91% vs. ~0%). Therefore, the question: “are unisexual Ambystoma ancient or recent?” is unresolved.
To provide a clearer answer to this question, we reexamined the phylogenetic relationship of unisexuals
and A. barbouri from various populations using both
mitochondrial cyt-b gene and NCR as markers. We
especially focused on A. barbouri samples (JPB34337,
JPB34342, JPB34343, JPB34356) that demonstrated distinctly different sequence divergences to the unisexuals

in the two studies [5,19]. Given that the rate of substitution likely varies for different genes/regions in the mitochondrial genome, we compared the substitution rates
of complete mitochondrial genomes (mtgenomes) of
unisexual and A. barbouri. We sequenced the mtgenome of a Kentucky A. barbouri specimen (JPB34342)
that was used in both studies and provided conflicting
results. We chose to sequence the mtgenome of one tetraploid unisexual A. laterale - 3 jeffersonianum (or LJJJ)
from a northern Kentucky population as a representative
unisexual. This individual was chosen because it was
found to have the most common mitochondrial NCR
haplotype among unisexuals (haplotype B in [5]), it was
collected in a state (Kentucky) where unisexuals were
previously unknown, and it was geographically close to
the A. barbouri individuals that were deemed to be the
closest relatives to unisexual Ambystoma. For comparison, we also sequenced mtgenomes of one A. barbouri
and one A. texanum from Ohio to examine their phylogenetic relationships to the Kentucky unisexual and
A. barbouri individuals. The time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA) for unisexual lineage and
its closest relative was re-calculated based on the mtgenome phylogeny.

Results
Mitochondrial cyt-b and NCR trees

Primers Glu14100L, MLM651 and M2R (abbreviated as
GMM) were used to amplify and sequence a ~ 2200
base pairs (bp) mitochondrial fragment that included
cyt-b and NCR. A total of 46 cyt-b sequences, including
one from an outgroup species (Ambystoma laterale)
downloaded from GenBank, were compared (Table 1).
Of the 1141 bp resolved, 228 sites were variable and 143
sites were phylogenetically informative. A total of 42053
most parsimonious trees resulted from the parsimony
analysis with 335 steps, a consistency index (CI) of
0.758 and a retention index (RI) of 0.939. For NCR, 46
sequences including one A. laterale from GenBank were
recovered (Table 1). Of the 1065 bp resolved, 215 sites
were variable and 111 sites were phylogenetically informative. A total of 90 most parsimonious trees were
obtained from the parsimony analysis with 310 steps, a
CI of 0.768 and a RI of 0.944. For both markers, a GTR
+I+G model was selected as the best-fit model. The cytb strict consensus tree (not shown) was nearly identical
to the Bayesian tree, but NCR strict consensus (not
shown) and Bayesian trees yielded slightly different
topologies. The Bayesian trees with the BPP and BSP
from the parsimony analyses are presented in Figure 1.
Both cyt-b and NCR trees clustered all specimens into
four clades (Figure 1). All the unisexuals, irrespective of
their biotypes and ploidy levels, formed a monophyletic
clade A. Clade A was sister to clade B that contained

Figure 1 Bayesian gene trees of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt-b) gene from Robertson et al. [19][A] and the present study [B], and
Bayesian gene tree of non-coding region (NCR) by the present study [C]. The tree arrangement from Robertson et al. [19] has been slightly
modified. Left numbers along branches represent the Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) and right numbers represent bootstrap proportions
(BSP) derived from the parsimony analysis. The detailed information of specimens that were sequenced is listed in Table 1. *A unisexual-like cytb numt likely exists in A. barbouri specimens JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343 and JPB34356 [A] so they were grouped within the unisexual clade.

A. barbouri individuals from southern Ohio and west of
the Kentucky Rivers in central Kentucky. This clade corresponded to the A. barbouri “western clade” in Niedzwiecki’s study [22]. Clade C contained A. barbouri from
north or east of the Kentucky River and north of the
Ohio River, as well as the disjunct populations in western Kentucky. This clade corresponded to the “northern clade” that was identified by Niedzwiecki [22]. Clade
D included A. texanum and A. barbouri from Tennessee. In the NCR tree, the relationship of clade D in
respect to three other clades was, however, not well
resolved but the monophyly of clade A+ clade B was
strongly supported (BSP = 99; BPP = 100).
In Robertson et al.’s study [19], four specimens
(JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343, JPB34356) of A. barbouri were found to be clustered in the unisexual clade
and three of them (JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343)
shared the same cyt-b haplotype with some of the unisexuals (Figure 1A). We sequenced the cyt-b gene from
the very same individuals but we found that none of
them shared an identical or almost identical haplotype
to any unisexual. We examined the sequence chromatogram of cyt-b in these individuals and only single signal
peaks were observed at every site. All four samples were
grouped in clade B with other A. barbouri where the
average cyt-b sequence divergence between A. barbouri
and unisexuals was 5.16% (Figure 1B). Likewise, no
A. barbouri shared the same or even a very similar NCR
sequence with unisexuals (Figure 1C), and the ingroup

relationship in the NCR tree was concordant with that
obtained by Bogart et al. [5].
Amplification of cyt-b gene by MVZ15 and MVZ16

Bogart et al. [5] used primers MLMTHR and MLM651 to
obtain a ~1100 bp intergenic spacer and control region
from unisexual and A. barbouri specimens. We compared our sequencing results using the same primers and
confirmed that MLMTHR and MLM651 produced the
identical sequences to those by using primers GMM. Primers MVZ15 and MVZ16 were used by Robertson et al.
[19] to amplify an ~800 bp cyt-b fragment from ambystomatids. In their study, A. barbouri individuals JPB34337,
JPB34342, JPB34343 and JPB34356 were found to contain
an identical or almost identical haplotype to unisexuals
which placed them in the unisexual clade. Using the
same primers, we failed to duplicate the same sequencing
results in JPB34342 and JPB34343 as discovered by
Robertson et al. [19]. Cyt-b failed to amplify in JPB34337
when using MVZ15 and MVZ16 but primers GMM confirmed that JPB34337 did not contain a unisexual haplotype. The results showed that these three individuals
shared A. barbouri cyt-b haplotypes that were grouped
with other A. barbouri in clade B (Figure 1B). We found,
however, that JPB34356 did have a unisexual-like cyt-b
haplotype as was found by Robertson et al. [19] using
MVZ15 and MVZ16 as PCR and sequencing primers.
This contradictory result was unexpected. We further
examined the sequence chromatogram of JPB34356 and

Bi and Bogart BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/238

found that its sequence contained many heterozygous
sites (multiple signal peaks) in positions where the variable sites between unisexuals and clade B A. barbouri
were located (Figure 2). At these heterozygous sites,
A. barbouri’s sequence signals were generally weaker
than unisexual-like sequence signals so the latter would
be read by the program by default (Figure 2). We ruled
out the possibility of DNA cross contamination and
mitochondrial heteroplasmy in JPB34356 because, using
primers GMM which targeted a much longer fragment
for PCR amplification and sequencing, we consistently
found a pure A. barbouri haplotype from JPB34356. In
the sequence chromatogram, unisexual-like sequence signals were no longer detectable (Figure 2A). We used various primer combinations to amplify mitochondrial genes
of JPB34342 using a new DNA extraction in the present
study as well as an old DNA extraction used by Robertson et al. [19]. None of the amplicons showed any signs
of DNA contamination or mitochondrial heteroplasmy.
Additionally, through sequencing the mtgenome of
A. barbouri JPB34342, unisexual JPB39932 and other
specimens we showed that cyt-b gene did not have any
duplicated component residing in the mitochondrial genome. A plausible explanation was that JPB34356 contained
a nuclear copy (or copies) of a unisexual-like mitochondrial cyt-b gene fragment (numt or pseudogene). When

using whole genomic DNA as template, both the actual
mitochondrial cyt-b gene and its nuclear numt could have
been co-amplified by MVZ15 and MVZ16. To further test
this prediction we used the mitochondrial DNA fragment
as a template and conducted sequencing PCR using
MVZ15 and MVZ16 as primers. The results showed that
no heterozygous sites existed in the sequence chromatogram (Figure 2A) and JPB34356 did not contain a unisexual-like cyt-b haplotype in its mitochondrial genome.
Another primer combination using MVZ15 and MLM651
(targeted a ~2200 bp fragment too) was also used to
amplify cyt-b using JPB34356 whole genomic DNA as
template and no unisexual-like signals were detected in
that sequence chromatogram.
Mtgenome phylogeny

A total of 17 mtgenome sequences, including 13 downloaded from GenBank, were used for phylogenetic construction (Table 2). The combined DNA dataset
contained 9647 bp with 3464 variable sites and 2361
were phylogenetically informative. Parsimony analysis
generated a single tree 8803 steps in length (CI = 0.569,
RI = 0.614). For Bayesian analysis, a GTR+I+G model
was selected as the best-fit model. The tree topologies
derived from parsimony and Bayesian analyses were
similar, with slight differences in the relationships of

some outgroup species, and we present the Bayesian
tree in Figure 3. The monophyly of Kentucky A. barbouri JPB34342 and unisexual JPB39932 was strongly
supported by both analyses (BSP = 100; BPP = 100).
The overall sequence divergence of mtgenome
between the unisexual sample JPB39932 and A. barbouri
JPB34342 was 4.42% (Table 3). We divided the mtgenome into 18 partitions and the pairwise difference of
each partition ranged from 2.27% (concatenated tRNAs)
to 7.03% (intergenic spacer). All 13 protein-coding genes
were rather variable between genomes of JPB39932 and
JPB34342. Except for ND4L (3.03%) and ATP8 (3.57%),
the pairwise differences of all other genes were no less
than 4.50%. JPB34342 was found to have an identical
cyt-b haplotype to unisexuals by Robertson et al. [19].
Our study clearly demonstrated that neither the cyt-b
gene nor any other genes, tRNAs or NCR throughout
the mitochondrial genome were the same between
A. barbouri JPB34342 and the unisexual.
Molecular dating

The relaxed lognormal clock analysis of the mtgenome
sequences by BEAST produced the same topology as
the Bayesian analysis. The divergence times estimated
by BEAST and MultiDivTime are listed in Table 4. In
general, the time estimates by BEAST and MultiDivTime were largely congruent. We present a time-calibrated tree from BEAST in Figure 4. The split between
unisexual Ambystoma and Kentucky A. barbouri (Node
A) took place about 5.3 Ma (CI 2.4, 8.7) by BEAST, and
5.1 Ma (CI 2.7, 9.0) by MultiDivTime. Both analyses

agreed that the origin of the unisexual linage may date
back to early Pliocene.

Discussion
No Ambystoma barbouri shares an identical mitochondrial
cyt-b gene with unisexuals

The phylogenies generated using cyt-b, NCR as well as
mtgenome all support the hypothesis that unisexual
Ambystoma form a monophyletic group and share the
most recent common ancestor with an A. barbouri lineage from Kentucky [5,9,19]. The age of unisexual
Ambystoma was in high disagreement because four
A. barbouri individuals (JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343,
JPB34356) examined by two previous studies demonstrated distinctly different phylogenetic relationships to
the unisexual lineage. Robertson et al. [19] found that
these four A. barbouri were grouped with the unisexual
cyt-b clade that suggested a very recent origin of unisexual lineage which was less than 25,000 years ago. On the
other hand, Bogart et al. [5] found a 3.91% sequence
pairwise distance in the control region between unisexuals and a few Kentucky A. barbouri individuals (including JPB34342, JPB34343, JPB34356) and claimed an
ancient evolutionary history of unisexual Ambystoma,
approximately 2.4-3.9 Ma. When using primers targeting
a long mitochondrial fragment (~2200 bp), we found
that no A. barbouri, including the four controversial
A. barbouri individuals used by Robertson et al. [19],
shared the same cyt-b gene sequence with unisexuals.

of mtgenome of the representative specimens further
demonstrated that neither the cyt-b gene, nor other
genes/regions in the mitochondrial genome were identical or almost identical between unisexuals and

A. barbouri. The overall substitution rates throughout
the mitochondrial genome, especially in protein coding
genes, were found to be rather consistent. Through a

haplotype that was more similar to the unisexuals than
western clade Kentucky A. barbouri including specimens
JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343 and JPB34356. Therefore, all our evidence clearly demonstrates that there is
no known A. barbouri that shares an identical cyt-b
gene with unisexuals.
Molecular dating demonstrates an ancient origin of
unisexual Ambystoma

In our BEAST analysis, the rate covariance among adjacent branches was 0.13 which was close to zero and
their 95% confident intervals spanned zero (CI -0.20,
0.46). This result suggests that rate autocorrelation is
insignificant [23] and BEAST (without rate-autocorrelation assumption), rather than MultiDivTime (with rateautocorrelation assumption), would be more appropriate
for the data and calibration choices in our study.

Nevertheless, our results show that the time estimations
between BEAST and MultiDivTime are largely congruent, especially within the ambystomatid salamanders
(Table 4). Both analyses show that unisexual Ambystoma
and Kentucky A. barbouri descended from their most
recent common ancestor about 5 Ma so this dichotomy
likely occurred in early Pliocene. More conservatively, if
we take the lowest value at 95% CI inferred by both
analyses, the unisexual lineage originated at least 2 Ma
(early Pleistocene). Generally, our estimate was consistent with previous time estimates of the origin of unisexual Ambystoma [5,20,21] which validates them as the
most ancient unisexual vertebrate lineage known to
exist [2].
Niedzwiecki [22] suggested that the Kentucky and
Ohio Rivers likely act as barriers between western and
northern A. barbouri mtDNA clades (corresponding
respectively, to clades B and C in our study, Figures 1B
&1C). The Kentucky River might have been responsible
for the divergence between A. barbouri from A. texanum as well as for the divergence of geographically distinct A. barbouri mtDNA lineages. Using a rough
calibration approach (1.5% per million years for the A.
tigrinum complex) [24], Niedzwiecki [22] estimated that
various A. barbouri mitochondrial lineages were separated around 3.5-5 Ma and a similar time would have
elapsed since the split between the main A. barbouri
clades and A. texanum. Our study suggests that both
divergence times are possibly more ancient than these
estimates. In the BEAST analysis, for example, the
separation between Kentucky A. barbouri (represented
by clade B, Figures 1B &1C) and Ohio A. barbouri
(represented by clade C, Figures 1B &1C) likely took
place 8.1 Ma (CI 4.4, 12.4). The split of western and
northern A. barbouri from A. texanum likely occurred
10.4 Ma (CI 6.0, 15.4). Our results indicate that both
events may have taken place in late to middle Miocene
or at least in early Pliocene, suggesting a longer evolutionary history for A. barbouri than expected.
Is a unisexual-like cyt-b numt present in A. barbouri?

Nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes or numts, which
evolve independently as paralogous copies of the original mitochondrial DNA segment, are relatively common
and have been reported in various taxa [25-30]. Failure
to discriminate real mitochondrial sequences and numts
often confuses the genetic diversity of species and
produces erroneous phylogenies [31]. Because the
nuclear genome has an overall slower mutation rate
than the mitochondrial genome, estimates on divergence
times can be problematic [28,32]. Numts can originate
from all parts of the mitochondrial genome including
the cyt-b gene [33] and the majority of numts are fairly
short sequences [34].

[A-F] are estimated by BEAST. The horizontal gray bars through these nodes indicate 95% credibility intervals from the BEAST analyses. Nonambystomatid specimens are not shown in the tree. Detailed time estimates can be found in Table 4. An early Pliocene origin for unisexual
Ambystoma is proposed.

When using whole genomic DNA as template and primers MVZ15 and MVZ16 for PCR amplification and
sequencing [19], A. barbouri individual JPB34356 possessed two different PCR products. One of the two was
not detectable in the sequence chromatograms when
using mitochondrial DNA as template with MVZ15/
MVZ16 as sequencing primers, or using total genomic
DNA as template with other various primer combinations. DNA cross contamination can yield sequence heterozygosity but contamination should have affected each
gene/region across the entire mtgenome. We tested the
old DNA extractions of A. barbouri individuals
(JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343, JPB34356) used by
Robertson et al. [19], and we did not find any signs of
DNA contamination in any other genes/regions. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy may also be responsible for
mixed mitochondrial amplicons [35,36]. The possibility
that these A. barbouri individuals embrace A. barbouri
and complete unisexual-like mtgenomes is minimal as
proven by the experiments we conducted above. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy could also be caused by regional

mutations or duplications of some mitochondrial copies
[37,38]. If these A. barbouri individuals have two types
of mtgenomes which are heteroplasmic only in the cyt-b
gene, we should have detected the heterozygous signals
in the cyt-b gene when using old/new total genomic
DNA extractions or mitochondrial DNA as templates
with any primer combinations for PCR and sequencing.
The most reasonable explanation is that A. barbouri
individual JPB34356 contains a unisexual-like cyt-b
numt. This unexpected discovery in JPB34356 has
resolved the mystery and provides a reasonable explanation for the data that were obtained by Robertson et al.
[19]. We believe that a unisexual-like cyt-b numt was
present in some A. barbouri individuals, including
JPB34337, JPB34342, JPB34343, and JPB34356. It is very
possible, in their study, that the cyt-b sequences recovered from these four A. barbouri were in fact unisexuallike numts. Therefore, the subsequent phylogenetic construction and divergence time estimates that were based
on these putative numts were erroneous. Although we
did not detect stop codons in these numts, it is known

Bi and Bogart BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/238

that numts do not always include stop codons or indels
and sometimes are indistinguishable to their mitochondrial orthologs [35]. It is possible, however, that the stop
codons were situated up/downstream beyond the region
amplified by the MVZ15/MVZ16 primers that we used.
Whether numts can be amplified may also depend on
the quality and quantity of nuclear DNA template in the
PCR reaction. In our study we failed to find or amplify
the same sequences in three other controversial specimens JPB34337, JPB34342 and JPB34343, which likely
resulted from the more highly degraded nuclear genomic DNA from these samples.
Implications of having an ancestral cyt-b numt in
A. barbouri

Dating the origin of unisexual/asexual lineages is usually
based on the extent of genetic divergence from their
nearest sexual relatives [7,39]. In general, time estimates
are more robust if both mitochondrial and nuclear
genomic markers are used as inferences. Uncoupling
evolutionary trajectories between their mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes, however, make molecular dating
of unisexual Ambystoma depend solely on the mitochondrial genome. All unisexual Ambystoma share one
mitochondrial origin but the evolutionary histories of
their nuclear genomes are much more complicated and
dynamic. It is clear that no recurrent hybridization
between any of the sexual sperm donors produces new
unisexual lineages [5,9] otherwise unisexual individuals
would contain a mitochondrial genome derived from
one or more of the extant sexual, sperm - donating species of Ambystoma. Bogart et al. [15] showed that A.
barbouri can serve as a sperm donor for unisexuals in a
single pond from southern Ohio. The cyt-b and NCR
haplotypes recovered from those A. barbouri were
found to be grouped in clade C (Figures 1B &1C), and
are distantly related to the unisexuals. Without recurrent hybridization, unisexual individuals have evolved an
extremely flexible reproductive mode by which they rely
on sexual sperm donors to perpetuate. Unisexuals
replace their nuclear genomes with those from sexual
sperm donors, historically and contemporarily, throughout their entire distribution [40]. Consequently, it is
impossible to use nuclear genome sequences for molecular dating of unisexual Ambystoma.
Little and Hebert [41] have criticized the traditional
dating strategy used for unisexual and asexual organisms
[39] because dating, not only requires a thorough search
of extant taxa, but also related species that may have
gone extinct since unisexuality/asexuality originated.
Neiman et al. [42] reviewed asexual lineage longevity
among invertebrate and vertebrate taxa and criticized
the notion that there existed young and “ancient” asexual lineages. They found that the distribution of asexual

Page 10 of 14

lineages followed a regular and linear age distribution.
The tabulated ages of asexual vertebrate lineages (fish,
amphibians, and reptiles) were all less than 300,000
years old and could even be considered young compared
with the estimated age of a sexual species. The unisexual Ambystoma lineage was included in their table of
asexual lineages with an age <25,000 years based on the
incorrect time estimate provided by Robertson et al.
[19]. Our present study demonstrates that unisexual
Ambystoma have persisted for about 5 million years and
we attribute this longevity to the fact that they are unisexual, not asexual, and have a unique reproductive
mode (kleptogenesis)[5].
Because A. barbouri may have an ancient evolutionary
history [[22], this study], it is reasonable to assume that
there may have existed a closer common ancestor to the
unisexuals which became extinct at some unknown time
[5]. Finding a unisexual-like cyt-b numt in some A. barbouri individuals suggests that its origination must have
taken place at about the same time as the hybridization
event that gave rise to unisexuals. Once a numt is established in its descendants’ nuclear DNA, it would be
much more conserved than the mitochondrial haplotype
because the mitochondrial cyt-b mutates faster than its
numt. The presence of an ancestral cyt-b numt in the
western Kentucky clade of A. barbouri would also suggest that no other population of A. barbouri, including
any potential extinct lineages, needs to be considered
more closely related to the unisexuals.

Conclusions
Using multiple sets of empirical evidence and rigorous
statistical methodologies, we reject the conclusion of a
recent origin of unisexual Ambystoma and support the
hypothesis that unisexual Ambystoma is the most
ancient lineage in unisexual vertebrates known to exist.
The amplification of unisexual-like cyt-b sequence in a
few Kentucky A. barbouri individuals is the possible
cause of the erroneous phylogeny and time estimate
determined by Robertson et al. [19]. The unisexual-like
cyt-b sequence, presumably a numt, in a few Kentucky
A. barbouri could represent a useful molecular “fossil”
showing that the A. barbouri lineage from Kentucky
represents the closest relatives to the unisexuals. Interestingly, our study shows that the unisexuals’ mitochondrial genomes, which are descended from ancestral A.
barbouri, seem to have changed little over time because
their cyt-b genes are very similar to the ~800 bp ancestral cyt-b numt amplified sequence identified in some
extant A. barbouri individuals. Low mitochondrial DNA
variation among present unisexual populations have
been described before [5,20] and it might be attributed
to population bottlenecking of unisexuals prior to their
rapid expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum. The

Bi and Bogart BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/238

length, number of copies and distribution of the cyt-b
numt in A. barbouri is not yet known and there may be
other A. barbouri individuals that have similar cyt-b
numts and/or other ancient signatures shared with unisexuals. The confirmation of an ancient ancestry of unisexual Ambystoma validates them as an excellent model
system for studying the evolution and maintenance of
unisexuality in vertebrates.

Methods
Samples

Ambystoma barbouri from various populations from
Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee were examined. Because
unisexuals were found to share a highly conserved mitochondrial genome in previous studies [5,9,19,20], we
only sequenced a few unisexual individuals from several
geographically distant populations to represent the unisexual lineage. The four specimens that were used for
sequencing of their mtgenomes were: A. barbouri from
Kentucky (JPB34342), unisexual LJJJ from Kentucky
(JPB39932), A. barbouri from Ohio (JPB37710), and
A. texanum from Ohio (JPB37892). To introduce calibration points into the molecular dating analyses,
mtgenome sequences of 12 salamander species were
retrieved from GenBank [43-47]: A. californiense,
A. laterale, A. tigrinum, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis,
Cynops cyanurus, Dicamptodon atterimus, Euproctus
platycephalus, Hynobius amjiensis, Notophthalmus viridescens, Paramesotriton laoensis, Taricha rivularis, and
Triturus cristatus. A frog, Xenopus tropicalis, was used
as an outgroup. Its mtgenome was also downloaded
from GenBank. Detailed sampling and sequence information is listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Laboratory protocols

Total genomic DNA was extracted from frozen larvae,
adult muscle, heart or liver tissues using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction method. We also tested some
DNA extractions used by previous studies [5,19]. A
combination of 22 primers [45] was used to amplify
contiguous and overlapping fragments that covered the
entire mitochondrial genome. PCR was conducted in a
25 μl mix including 30-50 ng of template DNA, 1 U
Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), 1× PCR buffer,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of
each primer. PCR cycling parameters were 95°C for
5 min as initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles of
95°C for 30 sec, 45-50°C [45] for 45 sec, 72°C for 30 sec
to 2 min depending on the expected size of fragments
(approx. 1 min/kb), and a final step at 72°C for 5 min.
PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gels and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen).
Sequencing was performed with the corresponding PCR
primers using BigDye 3.1 terminator sequencing

Page 11 of 14

chemistry with an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences were assayed using Sequencher (version 4.5;
Gene Codes). For some large PCR fragments that were
more than 1600 bp, specific internal primers were
designed to obtain their complete sequences.
Primers Glu14100L [45] and MLM651 [24] were used
to amplify a ~2200 bp mitochondrial fragment that
included cyt-b, intergenic spacer and control region. An
internal primer M2R (reverse primer, 5’-GTTGGTGG
TTTCTCGCCCTAAG-3’) was designed for sequencing
across the complete fragment. As a comparison, we also
used the same primers MVZ15 and MVZ16 [48] that
were used to amplify cyt-b genes by Robertson et al.
[19] to examine some of the A. barbouri individuals,
especially those that had an identical or almost identical
cyt-b haplotype to unisexuals. These two primers targeted an ~800 bp partial cyt-b gene fragment [19]. Likewise, we used the same primers MLMTHR and
MLM651 [24] that were used by Bogart et al. [5] to
amplify NCRs from some specimens and the expected
size of PCR products was approximately 1100 bp [5].
The PCR annealing temperature was set to 50°C for
MVZ15 and MVZ16, and was set to 46°C for MLMTHR
and ML651. The protocols of standard PCR reaction,
purification, sequencing and sequence alignment were
the same (above).
Phylogenetic methods

Three phylogenies were constructed using mtgenome,
cyt-b, and NCR, respectively. When using mtgenomes
for phylogenetic construction, we excluded all the
tRNAs and non-coding regions and only included two
rRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes. This was necessary
because of the absence of several tRNAs and the lack of
the intergenic spacer in mtgenomes of some outgroup
species as well as the difficulty in sequence alignment of
control regions. With the 13 protein-coding genes, the
third codon positions were eliminated because of high
substitution rates. Multiple substitutions likely produce
noise in phylogenetic and dating analyses [45]. Ambiguous alignments in the two rRNA regions were also
excluded. Additionally, all the gaps in the alignments
were eliminated manually. Finally, a DNA dataset containing all 17 DNA alignments (each with two rRNAs
and 13 protein-coding genes without third codon positions) was generated.
A maximum parsimony analysis was conducted using
PAUP* (version 4.01b10) [49]. Each sequence was treated as a taxon and each nucleotide was treated as a
character. All characters were weighted equally and
unordered. A heuristic search method via tree-bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch swapping was used. Bootstrap proportions (BSP) [50] with 1,000 replicates were
used to evaluate the nodal support. A Bayesian analysis

Bi and Bogart BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:238
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/238

was conducted using MrBayes (version 3.1) [51]. Model
selection was based on the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) as implemented in MrModeltest (version 2.2)
[52]. The best-fit model was used in subsequent Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Four Markov chains were
used and the dataset was run for 10,000,000 generations
to allow adequate time for convergence. Trees were
sampled every 500 generations, and the last 5,000 trees
were used to estimate the consensus tree and the Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). The overall sequence
pairwise divergence between mtgenome of Kentucky
A. barbouri and the unisexual was calculated using
MEGA (version 4.0) [53]. The mtgenomes were then
divided into 18 partitions according to genes and
regions (one concatenated tRNAs, two rRNAs, two noncoding regions and 13 protein-coding genes) and
sequence pairwise difference of each partition between
Kentucky A. barbouri and unisexual respectively, was
calculated. Pairwise differences of cyt-b and NCR
between the major lineages of interest were also calculated by MEGA.
Molecular dating

To infer the TMRCA for the unisexual lineage and its
closest relative, Kentucky A. barbouri, we incorporated
13 previously published mtgenome sequences to allow
the calibration points to be introduced to our analysis.
A combined DNA dataset including two rRNAs and 13
protein-coding genes without third codon positions
were used for dating analyses. Gaps in the DNA alignment were manually excluded. The ingroup root of the
tree (Salamandroidea and Cryptobranchoidea) was constrained to be 151 to 170 Ma. This constraint was based
on the oldest salamander fossil known to exist, the salamandroid-like Iridotriton hechti (151 Ma) [54] and a
proposed maximal bound for the origin of Caudata (170
Ma) [55]. The Taricha-Notophthalmus split was constrained to be at least 23 Ma (Taricha oligocenica from
the upper Oligocene) [56]. The Ambystoma-Dicamptodon split was set to at least 55.8 Ma (Dicamptodon antiquus from the late Paleocene) [57]; The Euproctus
-Triturus split was set to 20-30 Ma (disjunction of the
Corsica-Sardinia microplate from the Iberian Peninsula)
[46]; The Cynops-Paramesotriton split was constrained
to be greater than 15 Ma (Procynops miocenicus from
the upper Miocene) [56]. The split of A. tigrinumA. californiense was set to be around 5 Ma (the beginning of Sierran uplift) [24]. Because most of the fossil
record we used in this study only provided a minimum
age for the origin, when setting the priors we used the
fossil ages as the lower bounds.
Molecular dating was conducted by a Bayesian
MCMC approach in the program BEAST (version 1.5.1)
[58] and MultiDivTime [59]. Using BEAST, the topology

Page 12 of 14

and divergence times can be estimated simultaneously
from the data. BEAST input files were generated with
BEAUTi (version 1.5.1). A GTR+I+G was used to
describe the substitution model, a Yule process was
used to describe speciation, and an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) model was used to describe the relaxed
clock [23]. We used a lognormal distribution for fossil
calibrations, and a normal distribution for the biogeographic calibrations. BEAST was run for 80,000,000 generations with samples taken every 1,000 generations.
Five independent MCMC runs were conducted and the
log and time tree files were combined using LogCombiner (version 1.5.1). The results were examined by Tracer
(version 1.4.1) to confirm stationary distribution and
adequate effective sample sizes (ESS) that had been
obtained for all parameters. TreeAnnotator (version
1.5.1) was then used to summarize a best-supported tree
and annotate the tree with the mean age and posterior
probabilities of the nodes under investigation. FigTree
(version 1.2.3) was used to display the estimated tree
with node ages and the 95% confidence intervals. Programs BEAST, BEAUTi, LogCombiner, Tracer, TreeAnnotator and FigTree were downloaded from http://beast.
bio.ed.ac.uk. In the MultiDivTime analysis, parameters
of the substitution model were first estimated by program Baseml in the PAML package (version 4.3) [60].
The output from Baseml was then used in the Multidistribute package to estimate the maximum likelihood of
the branch lengths and a variance-covariance matrix,
and to perform a MCMC Bayesian analysis for estimating the posterior distributions of substitution rates and
divergence dates. The tree presented in Figure 3 was
used as the reference topology for molecular dating analysis. The priors for the ingroup root age mean (rttm)
and standard deviation (rttmsd) (Salamandroidea Cryptobranchoidea split, 151-170 Ma) were set to 1.60
and 0.1, respectively. The mean and standard deviation
of the prior distribution for the rate of molecular evolution at the ingroup root node (rtrate and rtratesd) were
both set to 0.12. The prior mean and standard deviation
for the Gamma distribution of the parameter controlling
rate variation over time (i.e. brownmean and brownsd)
were both set to 0.5. The Markov chain was run for
1,000,000 generations and sampled every 100 generations with an initial burn-in of 200,000 generations.
Three independent runs were performed to ensure the
convergence. The PAML package was downloaded from
http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html, and the
Multidistribute package from http://statgen.ncsu.edu/
thorne/multidivtime.html.
