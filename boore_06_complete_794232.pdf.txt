Abstract
Background: Mitochondria contain small genomes that are physically separate from those of nuclei. Their
comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution. Although
complete mitochondrial genome sequences have been reported for more than 600 animals, the taxonomic
sampling is highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods, leaving much of the diversity yet
uncharacterized.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of the bellybutton nautilus, Nautilus macromphalus, a cephalopod
mollusk, is 16,258 nts in length and 59.5% A+T, both values that are typical of animal mitochondrial
genomes. It contains the 37 genes that are almost universally found in animal mtDNAs, with 15 on one
DNA strand and 22 on the other. The arrangement of these genes can be derived from that of the distantly
related Katharina tunicata (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) by a switch in position of two large blocks of genes
and transpositions of four tRNA genes. There is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between
the two strands, and analysis of this yields insight into modes of transcription and replication. There is an
unusual number of non-coding regions and their function, if any, is not known; however, several of these
demark abrupt shifts in nucleotide skew, and there are several identical sequence elements at these
junctions, suggesting that they may play roles in transcription and/or replication. One of the non-coding
regions contains multiple repeats of a tRNA-like sequence. Some of the tRNA genes appear to overlap on
the same strand, but this could be resolved if the polycistron were cleaved at the beginning of the
downstream gene, followed by polyadenylation of the product of the upstream gene to form a fully paired
structure.
Conclusion: Nautilus macromphalus mtDNA contains an expected gene content that has experienced few
rearrangements since the evolutionary split between cephalopods and polyplacophorans. It contains an
unusual number of non-coding regions, especially considering that these otherwise often are generated by
the same processes that produce gene rearrangements. The skew in nucleotide composition between the
two strands is strong and associated with the direction of transcription in various parts of the genomes,
but a comparison with K. tunicata implies that mutational bias during replication also plays a role. This
appears to be yet another case where polyadenylation of mitochondrial tRNAs restores what would
otherwise be an incomplete structure.

Background
Animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is nearly always a
closed circular molecule and, with a few exceptions [e.g.
[1-4]], contains the same 37 genes, specifying 13 proteins,
two ribosomal RNAs, and 22 tRNAs [5]. Sequences of
these diminutive genomes have been broadly used to
address phylogenetic questions ranging from the population [6,7] to the interphylum [8-11] levels and to model
many processes of genome evolution [12,13]. Although
there are exceptions, most mtDNAs contain no introns
and are between 14 and 17 kb. Typically there are few
intergenic nucleotides except for a single large non-coding
region generally thought to contain elements that regulate
replication and transcription [14]. Occasionally non-coding regions have been found that contain repeated elements [15] or contain pseudogenes [12,16] or that may be
remnants of duplicated regions, perhaps those that mediate gene rearrangements [12,16,17]. Gene rearrangements
tend to be uncommon and to occur in a saltatory manner
[see [10]]. The "universal" genetic code has been modified
in many animal lineages, to include the use of alternative
start codons and abbreviated stop codons [18,19]. In
some mtDNAs there is pronounced skew in nucleotide
composition, often with one strand being rich in G and T
and the other in A and C [20]. Post-transcriptional modification of nucleotides has been observed for tRNAs
[21,22].
Little study has been done to date on mollusk mtDNAs
compared to those of vertebrates or arthropods [23], but
it is already apparent that mollusks exhibit much variation in the features of their mitochondrial genomes,
including losses and gains of genes [2], atypically large
amounts of duplicated or non-coding nucleotides
[15,24], highly rearranged genomes [2,25], and an unusual pattern of passage termed doubly uniparental inheritance [26,27]. This is furthered here by reporting and
comparing the features of the mitochondrial genome of
the first nautiloid to be so studied, N. macromphalus (Mollusca: Cephalopoda).
Nautiloids were once abundant and diverse in the Paleozoic seas, but only a handful of species remain. They are
part of the molluscan class Cephalopoda, which otherwise contains octopi, squid, and cuttlefish. They are the
earliest diverging lineage of this group and are often considered to be "living fossils" since living forms seem to
have changed little from their ancient ancestors. They live
in spiral-shaped shells which are filled with gas to control
buoyancy and they move about by squirting jets of water.
They are carnivorous, using their many grooved tentacles
to grasp prey and pass it to their mouth, where a beak-like
jaw tears it and passes it to the shredding radula. They live
throughout the Southwest Pacific Ocean, at depths as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/182

great as 610 meters, and traverse a great range, as shallow
as 90 meters, apparently in search of prey.
Complete mtDNA sequences have been determined for
23 mollusks (see Additional file 1), including a representative (Katharina tunicata) [28] of a basal group (Polyplacophora). This sampling includes seven other
cephalopods: Octopus vulgaris [29], Loligo bleekeri [30],
Todarodes pacificus [29,31], O. ocellatus, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, Watasenia scintillans, and Sepia officinalis [31]. Comparisons of the features of the N. macromphalus mtDNA
with those of some other mollusks are presented here.

Results and discussion
Gene content and organization
Complete mtDNA sequences have been determined 23
mollusks. The Nautilus macromphalus (sometimes called
the bellybutton nautilus) mitochondrial genome is
16,258 bp in length (GenBank accession number
DQ472026) and contains the set of 37 genes most commonly found for animal mtDNAs [5]. Fifteen genes are
located on one strand and 22 on the other (Fig. 1). There
are several substantial non-coding regions (see below),
the largest of which is 972 nts long and between trnQ and
trnT.

The mitochondrial gene arrangement of the distantly
related Katharina tunicata [28] (the only sampled representative of the Polyplacophora, an early diverging class
of the Mollusca) differs from that of another studied
cephalopod, Octopus vulgaris [29], by only the inversion of
trnP and a transposition of trnD, and differs from that of
N. macromphalus by these changes plus additional transpositions of trnF and trnT and the switch in position of
two large blocks of genes (Fig. 2). Therefore, each of these
lineages has experienced very few gene rearrangements
over several hundreds of millions of years. In order to
determine which of these differences were caused by
changes in the lineage leading to Polyphacophora versus
those leading to the cephalopods, it is useful to identify
more distantly related animals that share one or the other
arrangement; since it seems very unlikely that identical
rearrangements would occur in different lineages, one can
reasonably infer that any gene arrangement shared by this
outgroup taxon with either the polyplacophoran or a
cephalopod is the ancestral condition for the common
ancestor of the latter two groups. In this regard, the mitochondrial gene arrangement of a distantly related animal,
the phoronid Phoronis architecta [11], is very useful since it
has little diverged since these groups separated. From this
comparison (and confirmed by others not shown), we can
see that one of these tRNAs, trnD, remains in the ancestral
condition in these two cephalopods, with the transposition having occurred in the polyplacophoran, whereas all
other changes are derived for the cephalopods from that

Figure 2
Reconstruction of mitochondrial genome rearrangements for Nautilus macromphalus
Reconstruction of mitochondrial genome rearrangements for Nautilus macromphalus. At the top is the nearly
complete gene arrangement for Phoronis architecta [11], a presumed outgroup to the mollusks, shown to polarize two of the
cephalopod rearrangements: Having trnP in opposite orientation to nad6 and nad1 is the ancestral condition, as is having trnD
between cox2 and atp8. The only two differences between the chiton Katharina tunicata [28] and the two octopus species is the
inversion of trnP in the octopus and the transposition of trnD in the chiton. (No attempt is being made here to reconstruct all
of the rearrangements between the phoronid and the chiton.) The arrangement found in the N. macromphalus, then, can be
reconstructed by the additional switch in order of two large blocks of genes plus transpositions of trnF and trnT. Genes are not
drawn to scale and are abbreviated as in Fig. 1 except that underlining signifies right-to-left transcriptional orientation. All
genomes are circular and only graphically linearized at an arbitrarily chosen point. These genomes are chosen to illustrate the
paucity of rearrangements in these particular lineages. The cuttlefish and several squid with complete mtDNA sequences (see
text) have experienced many rearrangements unique to their lineages, and these patterns are reconstructed by Akasaki et al.
[31].

squids Loligo bleekeri [30], Todarodes pacificus [29,31],
Watasenia scintillans [31], and Sepioteuthis lessoniana [31],
the octopus O. ocellatus [31], and the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis [31]. O. ocellatus shares an identical gene arrangement with O. vulgaris. Two of the squids, L. bleekeri and S.
lessoniana, share a nearly identical gene arrangement (differing only by a transposition of one block of genes: trnI,
-rrnL, -trnV, -rrnS, -trnW [minus symbol indicates opposite transcriptional orientation]). This gene arrangement,

plus another separately rearranged in S. officinalis, are
highly derived and each shares only a few blocks of colinearity with the more conserved gene order of N. macromphalus mtDNA. All of these cephalopod mtDNAs have the
same gene content except for W. scintillans and T. pacificus,
the two representatives of the group Oegopsida. These two
mtDNAs have a nearly identical gene arrangement, differing only in the position of trnM, that is highly rearranged
from those of other mollusks, and contain duplicated

copies of cox1, cox2, cox3, atp6, atp8, and trnD, such that
they contain genes for a total of 18 proteins, 2 rRNAs, and
23 tRNAs. In all of these studied cephalopod mtDNAs, all
genes retain the same transcriptional orientation, that is,
all rearrangements are transpositions and none are inversions. Akasaki et al. [31] provide a comprehensive and
well reasoned review of this pattern of arrangements,
including proposals for mechanism of rearrangement, the
role of the many large, non-coding regions, and evidence
for concerted evolution of duplicated genes.
Gene initiation and termination
Mitochondrial genomes often use a variety of non-standard initiation codons [19], but N. macromphalus mtDNA
has only one type of deviation; three genes (nad3, nad4,
and nad5) start with GTG and all others use the standard
ATG (Additional file 4). Seven genes have unambiguous
termination codons, either TAG (atp6,cox1, nad5) or TAA
(atp8, cox3, nad1, nad2). In four cases (cox2, cob, nad3,
nad4) genes are probably abbreviated to a single T or to TA
such that the excision of the adjacent, downstream tRNA
from the polycistronic message leaves an mRNA that is
polyadenylated to complete a TAA stop codon. However,
in each of these cases, a complete stop codon is available
if there is, alternatively, overlap of only one or two nucleotides with the downstream tRNA. Perhaps these act as a
"backup" for cases where translation precedes message
cleavage. The other two cases are more ambiguous. nad4L
could have an abbreviated stop codon, but is inferred to
overlap nad4 by seven nucleotides to the first legitimate
stop codon, since overlap of this pair has been commonly
observed for other mtDNAs, where they are thought to be
translated as a bicistron. nad6 is inferred to overlap cob by
eight nucleotides, perhaps suggesting that these are processed also as a bicistron, but could instead end on an
abbreviated stop codon if there were some signal for message cleavage (i.e., other than a tRNA) that we do not recognize. Inferred in this way, all protein-encoding genes
have lengths nearly identical to those of K. tunicata
mtDNA (Additional file 2).
Transfer RNAs
Sequences were identified whose potential secondary
structures indicate that they encode the 22 tRNAs typically
found for animal mtDNA (Fig. 3). In general, these appear
well paired with only a few mismatches.

There are three cases where tRNA genes appear to overlap,
and these potential structures suggest how this is resolved.
trnL1(nag) appears to overlap trnL2(yaa) by only the
former's discriminator nucleotide (A). trnQ appears to
overlap trnW by two nucleotides. trnK appears to overlap
trnA by four nucleotides, GGCT. These are well-paired in
the potential structure of tRNA(A), but these four correspond to two G-T pairs, one mismatch, and the discrimi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/182

nator nucleotide of tRNA(K). It appears for each case that
cleavage to form a complete downstream tRNA followed
by (poly)adenylation of the upstream tRNA (as has been
demonstrated for some mitochondrial tRNAs [22]) would
yield fully formed, well-paired structures for all. This is
illustrated in Figure 3 by lower case, parenthetical letter
"a" appended to the genome-encoded nucleotide to indicate likely nucleotides in the actual transcript.
Usually T is in the first anticodon position for tRNAs that
recognize either four-fold degenerate codon families or to
specifically recognize NNR codons; G is usually in this
position only to specifically recognize NNY codons. (Due
to the convention of always drawing RNAs from 5' to 3' in
orientation, the first nucleotide listed for an anticodon
pairs with the last nucleotide of a codon.) All but two of
the N. macromphalus mitochondrial tRNAs follow this pattern. One exception is tRNA(M), which has the anticodon
CAT (to recognize both ATG and ATA), as is almost universally the case for all animal mitochondrial systems. In
some cases the C is known to be post-transcriptionally
modified to 5-formylcytidine to enable the necessary pairing with the ATA codon [32]. However, it is less common
that the tRNA(S) expected to recognize codon AGN has a
GCT anticodon, since this requires the G to pair with all
four nucleotides in the wobble position of AGN codons.
It is clear the AGA and AGG codons are being used and are
not stop codons (as is the case in vertebrate mtDNAs),
since they appear in the reading frames of protein encoding genes 117 times. GCT is used as the tRNA(S) anticodon for all of the cephalopods with complete mtDNA
sequences (above), and it is likely that this anticodon is
modified post-transcriptionally for all, as is known to
occur for the Loligo bleekeri tRNA(S), for which the G is
modified to 7-methylguanosine [33].
Non-coding regions
The mtDNA of N. macromphalus has 1,416 nucleotides
that are not assigned to genes. This is not an unusually
large number, but it is atypical that they are distributed
among so many regions of the genome (Table 1 and Additional file 3). It is particularly unusual to find this in a
mitochondrial genome that has not undergone significant
rearrangements, since intergenic non-coding regions
appear in some cases to be vestiges of pseudogenes generated by the gene duplication-random loss process of rearrangement [12,16,17,31].

In the largest non-coding region, between trnQ and trnT,
and beginning adjacent to a (CA)13 run (see below), there
are six repeats of a 62 nucleotide element followed by a
partial repeat of 39 nucleotides. Within this are five overlapping regions that have potential for forming tRNA-like
structures (Fig. 3). The anticodon portion of these structures is AGT, which would pair with codon ACT (or per-

haps ACN) to specify threonine. However, having A in
this anticodon position would be very unusual and there
is little sequence similarity to trnT (or any other tRNA).
Tandem repeats of CA are common, with (CA)3 in each of
the intergenic regions of trnA-trnR and trnG-atp6 and an
especially noteworthy (CA)13 in the region between trnQ
and trnT. Homopolymer runs of T10, nine C9, and A20 are
in the regions trnQ-trnT, trnG-atp6, and trnE-cox3, respectively. Non-coding, non-functional portions of mtDNA
are generally eliminated rapidly [34], presumably due to
selection for small size at the point of entry into the primordial germ plasm during embryogenesis [35], but
whether these or any particular motif plays any role in regulating replication of transcription awaits experimentation.
Base composition and codon usage
The N. macromphalus mtDNA is 59.6% A+T. The strand
that includes cox1, which we will arbitrarily designate as
the plus strand for the purpose of discussion, is 33.7% A,
25.8% T, 11.9% G, and 28.5% C. This strand is strongly
skewed (as calculated in [20]) away from both T (T-skew
= - 0.133) and G (G-skew = - 0.412) in favor of A and C
(Table 2). As can be seen in Table 3, this is strongly
reflected in the use of synonymous codons. For example,
while TTT and TTC are used with approximately equal frequency to specify phenylalanine in plus-strand genes, the
bias is 158 to 3 for their usage in minus-strand genes. The
use of G vs. A in UUR (leucine) codons is in the ratio of
16 to 89 for plus-strand genes but, even though the
mtDNA is A+T-rich, it is 195 to 60 for minus-strand genes.

Presumably the biased use of synonymous codons is
driven by strand-specific mutational propensity.
The minus-strand genes of N. macromphalus are organized
into three blocks: trnE through nad5; trnG individually;
and trnQ through trnF. As can be seen in Figure 4, each of
these is flanked by non-coding regions at least 20 nucleotides in length (Table 1, Additional file 3) and the two
largest are delimited by sharp transitions in the ratio of
A+C to G+T between the strands, with a strong bias
toward A+C in the reported strand for these three regions.
That bias is weaker for the region that is predominantly
composed of the ribosomal RNA genes, perhaps because
of the requirement for base pairing in the secondary structures of the products. There is no significant bias for the
plus-strand genes.
The mitochondrial genome of the chiton, K. tunicata, contrasts with this. Although the gene arrangement is quite
similar, here the pattern of bias is opposite in two different respects. First, it is the plus-strand genes that have
strong skew in nucleotide composition, with the minusstrand genes being nearly neutral for this bias. Secondly,
the bias for these is strongly toward G+T for the reported
strand. Here again, the sharp transitions in base composition are flanked by non-coding regions at least 20 nucleotides in length, which could potentially serve as
signaling elements for transcription or replication.
Such skews with one strand being rich in A+C and the
other rich in G+T are common for mitochondrial
genomes [20]. (See [36] for a review of the proposed
causes and an analysis specific to mtDNAs.) This is

thought to be due predominantly to the commonality of
deamination of adenine and cytosine nucleotides in single-stranded DNA [37-39] which appears transiently during replication and transcription. The relative
contribution of these two processes remains unclear [40],
as each accounts for one strand being displaced by the
nascent DNA or RNA, respectively. (Although this is not
without controversy in the case of mitochondrial replication [41-44]). Deaminated adenine forms hypoxanthine,
which pairs with cytosine (rather than thymine) and
deaminated cytosine forms uracil, which pairs with adenine (rather than guanine). Therefore, the displaced
strand, existing in single-stranded form for sometimes
protracted periods, tends to become rich in G+T (the analogs of hypoxanthine and uracil) and its complementary
strand, therefore, becomes rich in A+C.
Since N. macromphalus and K. tunicata mtDNAs each have
sharp boundaries in base compositional bias that correspond so precisely to shifts in transcriptional orientation,
it appears that lesions in the displaced strand during transcription are an important contribution. On the other
hand, the contrast in the bias being strong for the minusstrand genes of N. macromphalus and for the plus-strand
genes of K. tunicata shows that some other factor must be
at work.
According to the more long-standing and broadly
accepted model of mtDNA replication [41] (but see [4244]), and demonstrated for the few cases where it has
been studied, replication of mtDNA is very slow and very
asymmetrical, with one strand in single stranded form for
a protracted period, so this may be an important factor in
strand compositional bias. The nucleotide skew between
the two mitochondrial strands is expected to be a combination of various factors, and one could imagine a model

whereby a reversal between N. macromphalus and K. tunicata in which strand is leading during replication could
account for their differing skew patterns. If replication in
K. tunicata mtDNA were to proceed first in the rightward
direction according to Figure 4, then the bias introduced
during replication would make the reported strand rich in
G+T. This would be reinforced by biases introduced during transcription in the regions of the plus-strand genes,
causing especially high bias, and countered by the biases
introduced during transcription in the regions of the
minus-strand genes, causing them to approximately cancel out. If N. macromphalus mtDNA replication were to
proceed in the opposite direction, right-to-left as in Figure
4, then the effect would be the opposite, with skew generated by mutational bias during replication reinforcing
that from transcription of minus-strand genes and opposing that from transcription of plus-strand genes, and
accounting for the patterns shown in Figure 4.
It is not clear whether the isolated trnG is transcribed individually or is part of the transcription unit that otherwise
ends at nad5. Separating trnG and nad5 is a single plusstrand gene, atp6, and it is possible that this is transcribed
in reverse as part of the larger transcription unit, with this
antisense message excised and degraded. When considering only the composition of the third positions of fourfold degenerate codon families, G and T comprise 0.04
and 0.24 of atp6, values nearly identical to 0.08 and 0.26
for the other plus-strand genes collectively. However, A
and C are 0.24 and 0.48 for atp6 vs. 0.41 and 0.24, respectively, for the other plus-strand genes. Perhaps this indicates a modifying force for mutational bias, perhaps the
regular reverse transcription of the gene. On the other
hand, trnG is flanked by large blocks of non-coding
sequence which could potentially be signals for initiating
and terminating transcription for this individual gene.

Table 2 compares the mtDNA size, base composition,
A+T-richness, and strand skews for K. tunicata and the
eight cephalopod species with complete mtDNA
sequences. The other cephalopods all have strand skew
measures that are in the same direction, but of lesser magnitude, than N. macromphalus, and all of these cephalopods have strand skews in opposite direction from that of
the outgroup K. tunicata. There also appears to be a trend
for larger mtDNAs in the cephalopods and, for the octopus and squid lineages, for greater A+T-richness after the
split of that leading to the nautiloids.
Potential signaling elements
An attempt was made to find potential regulatory
sequence elements by comparing all pairs of non-coding
regions that are greater than 13 nucleotides in length
(Additional file 3) for any blocks 10 nucleotides or longer
with identity at least 80% while considering both strands.

repeats discussed above and underlined in Additional file
3, three elements were identified, all associated with
reversals in transcriptional orientation. In the largest noncoding region between the oppositely oriented trnQ and
trnT is the sequence TTAAAACAA, also found in the region
between atp6 and nad5. Although both are at a point
where transcriptional orientation reverses, the first case is
of genes arranged head-to-head but the second of genes
tail-to-tail. Also in the trnQ-trnT region is the sequence
CCNATTTTA which is also found in the region between
trnT and trnG; again in the first case the genes are head-tohead and in the second tail-to-tail. The sequence
ATAACAAAACTA occurs in the region between trnE and
cox3 and also between trnG and atp6, in each case pairs of
genes arranged head-to-head. (There are three cases total
where genes are arranged head-to-head, these two plus
trnQ-trnT. There are three cases total where genes are
arranged tail-to-tail, trnT-trnG, atp6-nad5, and atp8-trnF.)
None of these sequences are present in K. tunicata mtDNA

one that is the sense strand for cox1. Numbering of nucleotides begins at the arbitrarily chosen cox1 (as in Additional file 4 for
N. macromphalus). The scaled gene maps are also presented. tRNA genes are pictured but not labeled. Underlining and light
shading indicates opposite, i.e. right-to-left transcriptional orientation. Numerals label each non-coding region larger than 20
nts, which are then projected onto the plot by gray highlighting. Several of these correspond to positions where there is a shift
in nucleotide bias. Asterisks beside two of the numerals for K. tunicata indicate some ambiguity where these may instead be
supernumerary tRNA genes [28]. Red bars show the major transposition between the two genomes (see Fig. 2).

found, none were consistent across all (or even most) species. Lastly, a search was made for all available cephalopod mtDNAs for long stretches of alternating CA or TA,
suggested to play a role in regulation of replication and/or
transcription. Of note is that N. macromphalus has several
regions of alternating CA (Additional file 3), the longest
of which is (CA)13. Only two of the other cephalopods, L.
bleekeri and T. pacificus have any as long as (CA)4. In contrast, while N. macromphalus has no regions of alternating
TA longer than (TA)3 (which occurs in eight places), each
of the other cephalopods has many such regions at least
of length (TA)9 (T. pacificus and W. scintillans), and some
as long as (TA)22 (S. lessoniana). (The longest alternating
TA for L. bleekeri is (TA)14, for O. ocellatus is (TA)16, and for
both S. officinalis and O. vulgaris is (TA)12.) Of course, it is
possible that actual regulatory elements may be more
complex and difficult to identify.

Conclusion
To date, complete mtDNA sequences had been determined for 23 mollusks, a very small sampling compared
to those available for vertebrates or arthropods [23]. Even
these few studies have revealed that mollusks' mtDNAs
have much variation in their features, including losses and
gains of genes [2], unusually large amounts of duplicated
or non-coding nucleotides [15,24], numerous gene rearrangements [2,25], and doubly uniparental inheritance
[26,27]. By contrast, the mtDNA of the cephalopod Nautilus macromphalus is fairly typical in many respects, with a
size, gene content, and A+T-richness similar to those most
common for animal mtDNAs. There have been only a few
gene arrangements in this lineage even since its divergence
from the basal mollusk group Polyplacophora, and these
rearrangements can be confidently polarized among the
two lineages by comparing them to mtDNAs of less
related animals.
There is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides
between the two strands and it appears that biases in
mutational spectrum during both transcription and replication are responsible for this. Compared with most animal mtDNAs, there are a large number of non-coding
regions. Although their functions, if any, are not known,
the fact that several are at positions of abrupt shift in
nucleotide skew and that some contain identical sequence
elements suggests that they may contain regulatory signals
for transcription and/or replication. This appears to be
another example where polyadenylation of tRNAs creates
part of the amino-acyl acceptor stem. These, and other features can be interpreted in detail for the systems of these
diminutive genomes, and further sampling of complete
mtDNA sequences across the tree of life promises to provide insights into general aspects of genome evolution.

Methods
Molecular techniques
Testis tissue, stored for longer than a decade at -80Â°C, but
without any record of which species of Nautilus had been
sampled, was the gift of Wesley Brown. Fortunately, GenBank contains a short fragment of mitochondrial rRNA
for each of the six species of the genus, and this was used
for specific identification. The 401 nucleotides in common for this sample and the GenBank records were compared to determine that only two positions differ with the
record of N. macromphalus (this 0.5% difference is presumably due to intraspecies polymorphism), whereas all
others differ by from 16 to 24 positions; therefore, it
appears that this sample was from N. macromphalus.

Mitochondrial DNA was isolated from approximately 1 g
of this tissue by first grinding in liquid nitrogen using a
mortar and pestle. This powder was dissolved in 14 ml of
homogenization buffer (210 mM mannitol, 70 mM
sucrose, 50 mM Tris HCl-pH 75, 3 mM CaCl2) and processed using a Tissuemizer T-25 (Tekmar) with three
strokes of five seconds each. Membranes were lysed by
adding 1/10 volume of 20% SDS and incubating for 20
min at RT. A 1/6 volume of saturated CsCl in water was
added and this mixture incubated on ice for 15 min.
Debris was pelleted at 17,000 Ã G for 10 minutes at 4Â°C.
Propidium iodide was added to the collected supernatant
to a final concentration of 500 Î¼g/ml and the CsCl concentration was adjusted to a density of 1.57 g/ml. Nuclear
and mitochondrial DNA were separated by density gradient centrifugation in a VTi65 rotor at 55,000 Ã G for 15
hours at 21Â°C. Although no mitochondrial band was visible in the gradient, the region from about 2â10 mm
below the nuclear band was collected using a needle. This
was then extracted multiple times with water-saturated
butanol to remove the propidium iodide and dialyzed
against TE for 24 hours with three buffer changes to
remove the CsCl, leaving the sample in a 100 Î¼l volume.
This product was used in PCR as in [45] to amplify first
several short fragments of cox1, rrnL, and cob using primers found in [45-47]. The fragment of cox1 was cloned into
pBluescript (Stratagene) that had been digested with
EcoRV, T-tailed using Taq polymerase, and gel purified
using GeneClean (QBiogene). A successful recombinant
clone was selected and DNA prepared using standard
techniques. The other fragments were purified by three
serial passages through an Ultrafree (NMWL 30,000) spin
column (Millipore) and sequenced directly. The
sequences of these fragments were determined using an
ABI377 automated DNA sequencer with BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems) according to supplier's instructions.

Primers were designed to known sequences for use in long
PCR [48] with rTth-XL polymerase (Applied Biosystems)
according to supplier's instructions, sometimes combined
with primers to conserved mtDNA regions. Generously
overlapping fragments were amplified from cox1-nad1
(using conserved nad1 primer CCTGATACTAATTCAGATTCTCCTTC), nad1-cob, cob-rrnL, and rrnL â cox1 (using
conserved primer 16SARL [47]), jointly comprising the
entire mtDNA. Because there was no information available for the gene arrangement, many combinations of
primers were tried, but only these reactions gave bright,
singular bands during electrophoretic analysis. Sequence
was determined for each as above, then by primer walking
through each fragment. To ensure accuracy, all sequence
was determined from both strands. Sequencing reads were
assembled manually and quality verified by eye using
Sequence Navigator (Applied Biosystems).
Gene annotation and analysis
Genes encoding rRNAs and proteins were identified by
matching nucleotide or inferred amino acid sequences to
those of K. tunicata mtDNA [28] through the use of
MacVector (Accelrys). Since it is not possible to precisely
determine the ends of rRNA genes by sequence data alone,
they were assumed to extend to the boundaries of flanking
genes. Each protein gene was inferred to begin at an eligible initiation codon nearest to the beginning of its alignment with homologous genes that does not cause overlap
with the preceding gene. In five cases, an abbreviated stop
codon was inferred where cleavage of a downstream tRNA
from the transcript would leave a partial codon of T or TA,
such that subsequent mRNA polyadenylation could generate a TAA stop codon; however, in each of these cases, if
the reading frame extended through the first legitimate
stop codon there would be only a short overlap with the
downstream gene. Genes for tRNAs were identified by eye,
generically by their ability to fold into a cloverleaf structure and specifically by anticodon sequence. Subsequent
analyses, such as counting anticodon usage, calculating
nucleotide frequencies and strand skew values, and identifying repeated elements, were performed using MacVector (Accelrys).
