Abstract
Background: Determination of the prevalence and drug susceptibility of the M. tuberculosis strains is important in
tuberculosis control. We determined the genetic diversity and susceptibility profiles of mycobacteria isolated from
tuberculosis patients in Mbarara, South Western Uganda.
Methods: We enrolled, consecutively; all newly diagnosed and previously treated smear-positive TB patients aged
≥ 18 years. The isolates were characterized using regions of difference (RD) analysis and spoligotyping. Drug
resistance against rifampicin and isoniazid were tested using the Genotype® MDRTBplus assay and the indirect
proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen media. HIV-1 testing was performed using two rapid HIV tests.
Results: A total of 125 isolates from 167 TB suspects (60% males) with a mean age 33.7 years and HIV prevalence
of 67.9% (55/81) were analyzed. Majority (92.8%) were new cases while only 7.2% were retreatment cases. All the
125 isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis strict sense with the majority (92.8%) of the isolates being modern
strains while seven (7.2%) isolates were ancestral strains. Spoligotyping revealed 79 spoligotype patterns, with an
overall diversity of 63.2%. Sixty two (49.6%) of the isolates formed 16 clusters consisting of 2-15 isolates each.
A majority (59.2%) of the isolates belong to the Uganda genotype group of strains. The major shared spoligotypes
in our sample were SIT 135 (T2-Uganda) with 15 isolates and SIT 128 (T2) with 3 isolates. Sixty nine (87%) of the 79
patterns had not yet been defined in the SpolDB4.0.database. Resistance mutations to either RIF or INH were
detected in 6.4% of the isolates. Multidrug resistance, INH and RIF resistance was 1.6%, 3.2% and 4.8%, respectively.
The rpob gene mutations seen in the sample were D516V, S531L, H526Y H526D and D516V, while one strain had a
Δ1 mutation in the wild type probes. There were three strains with katG (codon 315) gene mutations only while
one strain showed the inhA promoter gene mutation.
Conclusion: The present study shows that the TB epidemic in Mbarara is caused by modern M. tuberculosis strains
mainly belonging to the Uganda genotype and anti-TB drug resistance rate in the region is low.

Background
Uganda ranks 16th among the world’s 22 countries with
the highest tuberculosis burden in the world [1]. The
country had more than 132,000 TB cases in 2007, with
an estimated incidence rate of 330 per 100,000 people
with greater Mbarara contributing about 26% of all TB
cases. This region has been heavily affected by the TB/
HIV epidemic. In 2005, the case notification for Mbarara
was 175/100,000 people compared to the 147/100,000

people for Uganda [2]. In 2008 the TB/HIV co-infection
rate for Mbarara was 65% [3]
To date, there are very limited data available pertaining
strains circulating in Mbarara yet evidence indicates that
M. tuberculosis’ ability to spread varies from strain to
strain and those different strains have different geographical and/or host specificities [4,5]. The presence of
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has caused an
increase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC)
infection [6] and rapid progression of the infection [7]
and is also known to increase MTC transmission rates at
the community level, further threatening the health and
survival of HIV sero-negative individuals as well [8].

Since the discovery of DNA polymorphisms in
M. tuberculosis, molecular typing of strains has become
an invaluable tool for the study of epidemiology of TB.
Some of the applications include; predicting transmission
rates and identifying dominant strains associated with
outbreak [9] severe disease [10] and drug resistance.
Comparative-genomics approaches greatly enhanced
our understanding of the mechanisms of insertion and
deletion of DNA and the resulting distribution of variable
regions around the genomes of tubercle bacilli [11-13].
There are 20 variable regions of which 14 regions of difference (RD1 to RD14) were found to be absent from
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Pasteur relative to
M. tuberculosis H37Rv [13-15]. Six regions, H37Rvrelated deletions (RvD1 to RvD5 and M. tuberculosis
specific deletion 1 (TbD1) are absent from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome relative to other members of the
M. tuberculosis complex. Based on the presence or
absence of the TbD1 region, M. tuberculosis strains can
be divided into “ancestral” and “modern” types. The Beijing, Haarlem, and African strains responsible for major
epidemics are modern types [11,16].
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPRs) are repetitive structures in bacteria and
archaea composed of exact repeat sequences 24 to 48
bases long separated by unique spacers of similar length
[17,18]. The CRISPR sequences appear to be among the
most rapidly evolving elements in the genome, to the
point that closely related species and strains, sometimes
more than 99% identical at the DNA level, differ in their
CRISPR composition [19,20]. Direct Repeat loci (DR) are
members of the CRISPR [21]. The Direct Repeat locus
consists of alternating identical DRs and variable spacers
can be assessed using the spoligotyping fingerprinting
methodology. Variability in the direct repeat locus of
M. tuberculosis [22] most likely occurs by one of three
mechanisms–homologous recombination between neighboring or distant direct variable repeats, IS-mediated
transposition, and DNA replication slippage [22].
Drug resistance among mycobacteria is a threat to the
treatment of tuberculosis globally and threatens to
reverse the gains made so far in the fight against tuberculosis. Several competing technologies have been proposed
for rapid detection of drug resistant tuberculosis. Some
commercial assays are currently available including
INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (Innogenetics N.V, Ghent, Belgium)
and GenoType ® MTBDR (HAIN Lifesciences GmbH,
Nehren, Germany) [23]. The new version of the latter
assay (GenoType® MTBDRplus), targeting the rpoB gene
associated with the resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and
both genes (katG and inhA) commonly associated with
the resistance to isoniazid (INH) has been evaluated
mainly on cultures and clinical specimens in various low
incidence settings, demonstrating excellent specificity

and good concordance with phenotypic drug susceptibility test (DST) results [24,25].
The current study was carried out in the Mbarara
region of South-Western Uganda between May 2007
and April 2008 in order to know the clones of M. tuberculosis and their drug resistance patterns.

Methods
Study setting

The study was conducted between May 2007 and April
2008 in the former greater Mbarara in the South- western
region of Uganda. Greater Mbarara is a rural region that
is currently made up of four districts namely Ibanda,
Isingiro, Kiruhura and Mbarara (Figure 1).
Study design

This was a cross sectional study in which we enrolled,
consecutively, all consenting smear-positive newly diagnosed and retreatment TB patients aged ≥ 18 years.
Three consecutive sputum samples (spot, early morning
and spot) were taken from each patient according the
Uganda National TB and Leprosy guidelines. Only the
sample with the highest ZN smear grade for each
patient was further processed and cultured. Samples
were stored at 4°C at the recruitment clinics, in any case
for not more than 48 hours, until transported in a cold
box to the National tuberculosis reference laboratory
(NTRL) in Kampala for processing and culture.
Sputum sample processing

Specimens (2.5-10 ml) were processed by the standard
N-acetyl L-cystein (NALC)-NaOH method [26] and
concentrated at 4000 × g for 15 minutes. The sediment
was reconstituted to 2.5 ml with phosphate buffer pH
6.8, to make the inoculum for the smears and cultures.
Culture and identification

Two Löwenstein-Jensenslants, one containing 0.75% glycerol and the other containing 0.6% pyruvate were
inoculated with the sediment and incubated at 37°C and
examined weekly for growth. Cultures were considered
negative when no colonies were seen after 8 weeks
incubation.
DNA Extraction

Isolates were harvested and DNA extracted using a standardized protocol [27].
RD analysis

RD analysis for 16SrRNAS, RD4, RD 9, RD12 and TbD1
was performed for speciation of the isolates was done
at the department of Medical Microbiology, Makerere
University College of Health Sciences as previously
described [28].

Spoligotyping

Standard spoligotyping was performed as previously
described [29] using a commercially available kit (Isogen
Bioscience BV, Maarssen, The Netherlands).

PCR and subsequent hybridization steps were performed
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Thereafter, strips were attached to the evaluation sheet, read
and interpreted. For quality control we included known
fully sensitive and resistance isolates in each run.

Conventional drug susceptibility testing

The indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen
media was performed by the NTLP for patient management at the following final drug concentrations: rifampicin, 40 μg/ml and isoniazid, 0.2 μg/ml. The NTLP
kindly provided the results for comparison with the kit
results.
GenoType® MTBDRplus assays

Identification of mutations in rpoB, katG, and inhA
genes associated with resistance to RIF and INH was
performed on the mycobacterial cultures according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, heat thermolysates of cultures were obtained by heating cultures
suspended in Tris-EDTA (TE) at 80°C for two hours followed by incubation in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes.

HIV testing

HIV-1 testing was performed using two rapid HIV tests,
Unigold Recombinant HIV (Trinity Biotech, Wicklow,
Ireland) and Determine HIV-1/2 (Abbott, Tokyo, Japan).
Samples were tested first with Abbot Determine. Positive
samples were confirmed with Unigold, while discordant
results were resolved by a third rapid test kit, HIV-1/2
Stat-Pak (ChemBio, Medford, NY). Pre and post test HIV
counseling was done for all consenting individuals.
Data analysis

Socio-demographic data was entered into the computer
using Microsoft Excel 2000 software and then exported
to SPSS version 10 for analysis. All spoligotyping data
were digitized and analyzed with the BioNumerics

Bazira et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/81

software, version 5.0 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium).
Spoligotype identification was carried out according to
SpolDB4 [30] and by the freely accessible MIRUVNTRplus web database [31]. The latter comprises spoligotyping data of a reference strain collection of validly
described Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)
genotypes. Labels for major phylogenetic families were
assigned according to signatures provided in SpolDB4.
Univariate analysis of categorical variables utilized percentages while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. The median and range
was presented whenever continuous data was skewed.
Chi squares were computed in STATA version 11 and a
P value of < 0.05 was considered evidence of significant
difference.
Ethical considerations

This study received ethical clearance from the faculty
research and ethics committee of the faculty of medicine
of Mbarara University of Science and Technology, the
institutional review board of Mbarara University of
Science and Technology and the Uganda National
Council for Science and Technology. Patients were identified and managed according to Uganda NTLP guidelines [32]. Informed consent to participate in the study
as well as permission to use isolates from samples provided were obtained from all enrolled participants.

Results
Study population and samples

We enrolled a total of 167 sputum smear positive tuberculosis suspects presenting at the various TB clinics in the
greater Mbarara during the study period. The samples
were graded depending on AFB count in the specimen
according to the WHO recommendations [33]. Of the 167
samples that were cultured 140 (84%) grew, 14 (8%) had
no growth and 13 (8%) were contaminated. Of the 140
cultures 15 (10.7%) did not have full demographic data
and were therefore not available for the study leaving 125
isolates. Of the 125 patients with viable isolates, majority
116 (92.8%) were newly diagnosed and 9 (7.2%) had previous history of TB treatment. Of these patients, 50 were
females and 75 were males with a mean age of 33.7 years.

(49.6%) isolates, were grouped into 16 clusters consisting of 2-15 isolates each, while the remaining 63 (51.4%)
isolates did not cluster. Among the 16 clusters, three
included five or more isolates each and were defined as
major spoligotypes in this study, while minor spoligotypes, on the other hand, were defined as spoligotype
international types (SITs) that contained less than five
isolates per cluster (Figure 2). Spoligotypes that neither
clustered nor matched any existing pattern in the
SpolDB4 database were defined as orphans. Of the 79
patterns observed in this study, 69 were true orphans.
The family assignment showed that 59.2% of the isolates belonged to the Uganda genotype, 7.2% to the
CAS_DELHI, 6.4% to the Latin American Mediterranean
(LAM), 5.6% to the East-African Indian (EAI) family, 4%
belonged to the Cameroon family, 2.4% to the Ghana
family and 13.6% were not assigned to any family.
Comparison of the spoligotypes in our study with
SpolDB4.0 allowed differentiation between ubiquitous
types (SIT 26-CAS_DELHI, SIT 52-T2, SIT 53- T1, SIT
54-MANU2, SIT 59- LAM11_ZWE, SIT356- CAS, SIT
358-T1, SIT 420-T2, SIT 815- LAM11_ZWE, SIT 1090 EAI5 and SIT 1572-T2) and those believed to be endemic
in Uganda (SIT 128- T2 and SIT 135 -T2).
A majority (59.2%) of the isolates lacked hybridization to
either spacer 40 alone (Uganda genotype II) or to both 40
and 43 (Uganda genotype I). These Uganda genotype
strains formed 8 clusters (ranging 2 to 15 isolates). Nine
strains were Uganda genotype I while seventy seven were
Uganda genotype II. Forty eight Uganda genotype strains
did not cluster.
HIV sero-status

RD analysis

All the 125 isolates that were available for RD analysis
were identified as M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. Seven isolates were found to have all the RD loci conserved including TbD1 and were therefore ancestral strains (Table 1).
Spoligotyping

All the isolates had spoligotypes characteristic of
M. tuberculosis. The isolates gave 79 different spoligopatterns, with an overall diversity of 63.2%. A total of 62

Fifty five patients were HIV sero-positive, twenty six
were HIV sero negative and forty four had unknown
sero-status because they did not consent to HIV testing.
There was no significant difference (P = 0.116) in serostatus between female and male patients in the study.
An analysis of the predominant spoligotypes in HIV
sero-positive and sero-negative patients showed that 28/
55 (50.9%) of sero-positive individuals carried strains of
the Uganda family, while only 12.7% carried the LAM
strains,3.2% Delhi/CAS strains, and 5.6% carried unique

strains. Furthermore, 19/26 (73.1%) of the HIV seronegative individuals carried strains of the Uganda family,
while only 3.8% carried the LAM strains,3.8% Delhi/
CAS strains, and 15.4% carried unique strains. Of those
who did not consent for HIV testing 27/44 (61.4%) carried the Uganda family of strains while only 2.3% carried
the LAM strains,11.4% Delhi/CAS strains, and 13.6%
carried unique strains.
Drug susceptibility patterns

Susceptibility testing showed that six isolates were resistant to rifampicin, and four to isoniazid, with two isoniazid resistant isolates being rifampicin resistant as well,
hence MDR. All the two MDR strains were isolated from
patients below 39 years of age, all being HIV sero-positive females. Surprisingly, the MDR strains were isolated
from newly presenting patients. Four of the 74 isolates of
Uganda family were resistant to at least one drug while
two of the Delhi/CAS family was resistant to at least one
drug. There were two MDR isolates, one belonging to the
Delhi/CAS family and the other to Uganda family. The
rifampicin resistant isolates displayed three types of
mutations: three isolates had a mutation at position
D516V, two had S531L, while one of the isolates with
D516V had a further two mutations, H526Y and H526D
in the rpob gene. Only one strain had a Δ1 mutaion in
the wild type probes and, according to the kit manufacturer’s recommendation, was considered resistant. There
was no significant association between drug resistance
and any lineage. A summary of drug susceptibility pattern of the isolates with the spoligotypes is shown in
Table 2.

Discussion
Deletion analysis using 16SrRNAS, RD4, RD 9, RD12
and TbD1 revealed that all the strains investigated were
M. tuberculosis. This finding is comparable to that of
the study by Byarugaba et al 2009 [34] which found no

M. bovis among the 75 MTC isolates from the mainly
cattle rearing communities of greater Mbarara. This
could be a result of improved animal husbandry in
Mbarara, or due to improved practices of the people
such as boiling of milk before consumption. On the
other hand, it may be due to the fact all of our samples
were pulmonary sputum, which might have limited the
chances of culturing M. bovis.
The diversity of the M. tuberculosis found in the present
study (63.2%) is high compared to 16.6% described from a
study in central Uganda [35], which may indicate geographical differences in the epidemiology of TB in Uganda.
Another hypothesis could be because of differences in the
population density. Central Uganda has the major cities of
the country and therefore has a high transmission rate,
hence limited diversity. Mbarara is a big district, sparsely
populated because of the main economic activity: cattle
keeping. In such an area, it is possible to have less transmission and a highly diverse bacterial population. This is
not easily determined using spoligotyping alone and would
therefore require more discriminatory techniques such as
MIRU and restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) to confirm this.
In this study 69 (87%) of the spoligopatterns could not
be typed on the basis of the existing SpolBD4 database.
This indicates the current absence of knowledge on the
genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains in from this
region. This therefore calls for more clinical epidemiological studies in different regions of not only Uganda but
Africa at large so as to clearly understand the genetic
diversity of the TB epidemic on the continent.
Majority (59.2%) of the strains in our sample were of the
Uganda genotype, a finding which is in keeping with those
of earlier studies in Uganda [36-38] as opposed to findings
from the surrounding East African countries[39,40]. For
example a study in Kenya [39] found only eight (11%) of
73 isolates to be of the Uganda family while in northern
Tanzania [40] only four (3%) of 130 strains were

T2-Uganda. Collectively these findings are in agreement
with those of other studies showing a tendency for local
genotypes to form a greater proportion of the circulating
strains in different parts of Africa [41-44]. These results
indicate that each of the major lineages of M. tuberculosis
have evolved to most efficiently transmit within an original
human population. These results are further in agreement
with other findings where it was noted that different
strains of M. tuberculosis have adapted to specific human
populations, and that such local strains are more likely to
transmit compared to others [4,45].
The relative frequencies of major M. tuberculosis spoligotype families were in range with the overall frequencies in
Uganda and other East African countries [35,36,39,40,46].
The largely predominant Uganda family identified in more
than 59% of the strains in our study is ubiquitous in this
country. Both its high degree of dissemination and its preponderance among the new (shared as well as orphan) patterns are manifestations of the current adaptive evolution
of the Uganda genotype in this setting. Other significant
spoligotypes in our study were LAM (7.2%), CAS (8%), EAI
(5.6%), Cameroon (4%) and Ghana (2.4%). A study by
Asiimwe et al 2008 from Kampala showed proportions of
CAS1-Kili (3.5%), LAM9 (2.6%), CAS1-Delhi (2.6%),
LAM3/S (1.7%), CAS1 (1.7%), and LAM11-ZWE (1.5%). In
comparison to other studies in the region, the CAS, LAM
and EAI families were reported at 37%, 22% and 17%
respectively of a total of 147 isolates in a study in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania [46]; while in northern Tanzania, the
most predominant families were CAS-Kili (30%), LAM11ZWE (14.6%), EAI (6.2%), Beijing (5.4%), and CAS1-Delhi,
T1 and LAM9 at 3.8% [40]. In Kenya, on the other hand,
35.6% of 73 isolates were of the CAS family, while 11%
were LAM [39]. These studies show more success of the
CAS, LAM and EAI families in the neighboring East African countries, while in Central and Western Uganda, the
Uganda family of strains predominates.
We found resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin to be
3.2% and 5.6% respectively, while MDR was 1.6% (2/125).
Our result show differences compared with findings that

0.46
0.076

were obtained in the last National anti-tuberculosis drug
resistance survey in Uganda of 1996-97 that indicated a
primary resistance to isoniazid of 6.7%, that to rifampicin
at 0.8%, and MDR of 0.5% [47]. More recently, a study in
peri-urban Kampala showed resistance to isoniazid of
8.1%, rifampicin resistance of 4.4% and MDR was found
to be 4.4% [35]. These differences may probably be due
to sampling strategy employed in each study and the
numbers involved. While the National survey randomly
sampled districts in Uganda, the peri-urban study in
Kampala looked at a single division known to be the second most TB burdened in the city, while the current
study sampled patients from various villages of a rural
district in western Uganda.
Studies from neighbouring East African countries show
varied results. In a study in Rwanda, resistance to isoniazid was found at 6.2%, that to rifampicin was 3.9% with
all rifampicin resistant isolates being multidrug-resistant
[48]. In northern Tanzania, on the other hand, a study of
111 isolates showed that 9.9% were resistant to isoniazid,
2.7% to rifampicin, while MDR was 2.7%[40]. Generally,
the drug resistance rates in the current study are fairly
within the range of those found in previous studies both
in-country and around the region. However there is evidence of an increase in the MDR rate in Uganda in the
last two studies compared to the first National survey
albeit on smaller samples. Although a number of patients
were not tested for HIV and could be dually infected,
two thirds of those tested for were infected by both HIV
and TB, a common trend in sub Saharan Africa [49].
Despite the high prevalence of the Uganda family there
was no significant association with anti-TB drug resistance
(P-value = 0.076) This finding in agreement with the finding by Asiimwe et al [35] who found that there was no
significant difference in the resistance pattern of the predominant T 2 Uganda genotype versus the Non T family.
This therefore implies that T2 Uganda might not be the
driving force of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in this
community Mutations in codon 315 of the katG gene
were the only ones found in our study. These mutations

Bazira et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/81

are found in the vast majority of isoniazid-resistant isolates
[50,51]. However, the frequency of codon 315 mutations
in isoniazid-resistant isolates in other populations has
been reported to range from 35% to 97% [52]. Mutations
in codon 315 do not significantly decrease the peroxidase
activity of the katG gene product, but do decrease its ability to activate isoniazid[53]. These features allow the
mutants to maintain the peroxidase activity required for
virulence, and to resist killing by isoniazid. Such isolates
often display resistance to only lower levels of isoniazid,
and resistance to higher levels appears to correlate with
loss of catalase activity or acquisition of mutations in multiple genes implicated in isoniazid resistance, e.g., inhA or
ahpC[54,55].
The most frequent mutation in the rpoB codons in
our study was 516 (43%). As opposed to mutation 531
which is the most commonly observed mutation in
rifampicin-resistant isolates in many parts of the world,
e.g., in Brazil (54%) [56], the USA (35%) [57], India
(38.7%) [58], Germany (65%) [59] and Australia (52%)
[60].
Differences in the frequencies of mutations in the 516,
526 and 531 codons of the rpoB gene among isolates of
the Beijing, Haarlem and LAM families may primarily
reflect differences in mutational frequencies or the relative fitness of the mutations in the strain families, as
opposed to a possible sampling bias caused by extensive
transmission of individual MDR strains.
Overall, the data indicate that the frequencies of individual mutations in the genes associated with rifampicin
and isoniazid resistance vary among isolates belonging
to different genotype families. Such variation may influence the performance of molecular diagnostic tests
designed to detect mutations associated with drug resistance in M. tuberculosis isolates. This emphasises the
importance of validating the performance of a diagnostic
test in the population being tested. The biological significance of the predominance of certain mutations in particular genotype families remains to be determined.

Conclusions
This study provides an insight into the M. tuberculosis
strains circulating in the rural district of Mbarara, South
Western Uganda. We have shown that the majority of
the Mycobacteria in Mbarara are modern M. tuberculosis with a wide diversity of spoligotypes and a predominance of the Uganda genotype. Additionally, strain types
in our sample were not associated with drug resistance.
