hypothermia

Abstract
Neuroinflammation is a key element in the ischemic cascade after cerebral ischemia that results in cell damage
and death in the subacute phase. However, anti-inflammatory drugs do not improve outcome in clinical settings
suggesting that the neuroinflammatory response after an ischemic stroke is not entirely detrimental. This review
describes the different key players in neuroinflammation and their possible detrimental and protective effects in
stroke. Because of its inhibitory influence on several pathways of the ischemic cascade, hypothermia has been
introduced as a promising neuroprotective strategy. This review also discusses the influence of hypothermia on the
neuroinflammatory response. We conclude that hypothermia exerts both stimulating and inhibiting effects on different aspects of neuroinflammation and hypothesize that these effects are key to neuroprotection.
Introduction
Inflammation is an essential tool to defend oneself
against infectious organisms. However, it becomes detrimental when it is prolonged or attacks self antigens [1].
Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease
are associated with a chronic inflammatory response
[2,3]. After ischemic stroke, the death of ischemic neurons and especially the release of necrotic cell debris
triggers inflammation resulting in strong activation of
phagocytic cells [1,4]. Over the past two decades, our
understanding of the inflammatory response after stroke
and in other diseases has increased due to extensive
research. Previously, it was thought that the inflammatory response in brain was beneficial and necessary for
repair. Later, it became clear that this “neuro” inflammatory response could be detrimental too, and that even
peripheral immune responses can be regulated by the
brain [5]. Furthermore, injury to the brain can make the
body more vulnerable to systemic infections. For example, a central nervous system injury-induced immunodepression syndrome has been identified in experimental

stroke models leading to spontaneous systemic bacterial
infections within 3 days after stroke [6-8].

Stroke
Stroke is a broad term that includes conditions caused by
occlusion of or hemorrhage from a blood vessel supplying the brain [7,9]. Its incidence remains high and the
number of approved therapies low. As our society ages,
the number of stroke patients continues to increase, and
will become an important socio-economic burden, as
80% of patients who survive their stroke remain permanently disabled. Ischemic strokes represent more than
80% of all cases and are characterized by the occlusion of
a blood vessel due to a thrombus or embolus [10,11].
The location and the size of the ischemic area of the
brain varies, depending on which artery is occluded,
thereby causing metabolic and functional dysregulations
[12,13]. Furthermore, the occlusion can be permanent or
transient, the latter meaning that reperfusion will occur.
After ischemic stroke, two main regions of damage can
be defined according to the remaining blood supply. The
area in the brain where complete abolishment of blood
supply occurred (blood flow reduced to less than 12 ml/
100g/min), is called the core of the insult. Complete, or
almost complete, energetic failure resulting in necrosis,
defines this region. The penumbra is the area surrounding the core which is hypoperfused during the occlusion

period. Collateral blood supply from surrounding arteries
ensures that a flow of approximately 30 ml/100g/min is
maintained. Some energetic metabolism persists in this
region and if reperfusion can be restored quickly, this
tissue can be salvaged [14-17]. Consequently, the penumbra is an attractive target to rescue brain tissue as this
region can remain potentially viable for 16 to 48 hours,
enabling clinicians to intervene and reduce post-stroke
disability [7,15].
There are excellent reviews elaborating extensively on
the complex ischemic cascade after stroke [5,7,14,17,18].
Briefly and much simplified, three phases can be characterized in infarct progression. The acute phase starts
within minutes to a few hours after stroke onset in which
the decrease in cerebral blood flow perturbs the ionic
homeostasis. This leads to increased intracellular calcium
concentrations and stimulation of glutamate release,
causing excitotoxicity and a spreading depression
throughout the ischemic region [14,18,19]. Water shifts
to the intracellular space due to osmotic gradients and
cells swell. The resulting vasogenic edema can influence
reperfusion negatively and causes intracranial pressure,
vascular compression and herniation [18]. Furthermore,
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially if
reperfusion takes place, can damage membranes, mitochondria and DNA, leading to misfolding of proteins and
enzyme dysfunctions. In the second, subacute phase (a
few hours to a few days after ischemia), an apoptotic and
neuroinflammatory response develops as a result of the
stimulatory influences of the acute phase [14,17,18]. The
high intracellular calcium concentrations built up during
the acute phase lead to an overactivation of several proteolytic enzyme systems. Finally, in the chronic phase,
which can last up to some months after the actual
ischemic stroke, repair and regeneration will determine
the ultimate extent of damage [19]. As contradictory as it
may appear, reperfusion following an occlusion may
exacerbate neuronal injury through increased production
of ROS and a stronger inflammatory response [16,20].
On the other hand, quickly re-establishing the blood supply is vital as it may allow salvation of neurons in the
penumbra from irreversible damage, as energy metabolites and cellular membrane ionic gradients would be
restored to normal levels [10]. Recanalization is the only
approved and effective therapy for stroke to date. Recombinant tissue plasminogen-activator (rt-PA) must be
administered within 4.5 hours after stroke onset to
restore reperfusion. Unfortunately, due to the short time
window and several risk factors, this treatment can only
be administered in 5-10% of cases [11,15]. This emphasizes the need for other neuroprotective therapies not
influencing revascularisation, but a strategy that antagonizes, interrupts or slows down injurious biochemical

Page 2 of 18

and molecular events in cases treatment with rt-PA is not
indicated [21]. Such neuroprotective strategies would primarily focus on reducing the extent of damage in the
penumbral region and thus the outcome after stroke
[15]. Combining quick reperfusion with the right neuroprotective strategy to address the downstream damaging
cascades induced by the occlusion could lead to a better
outcome. Nowadays, hypothermia seems to be the most
promising neuroprotective therapy that has been translated to clinical practice [22,23]. Many other proven neuroprotectants in experimental models have not improved
outcome after ischemic stroke in clinical settings. Several
reasons may explain this discrepancy. Firstly, research is
performed in many different stroke models ranging from
permanent occlusion models to transient ones. Furthermore, the duration of transient occlusion can range
between 30 minutes to 3 hours. Therefore, as functional
and structural damage after ischemia depends on its
severity and duration, it is important to stress which
experimental model was used [9]. Secondly, experiments
are generally performed in healthy young rodents. But in
reality, most patients who suffer stroke have several risk
factors (e.g. age, diabetes and hypertension) which negatively interfere with the ischemic cascade. Thirdly, the
adaptation mechanism of high phylogenic species such as
human beings is expected to be different from lower phylogenic ones. Most experimental approaches involve
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the same
artery that is most commonly occluded in clinical stroke
[11]. In order to improve the relevance of preclinical studies to clinical practice, STAIR (Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable) criteria were set up [10,22].
Neuroprotective agents that target the acute effects of
the ischemic cascade (e.g. glutamate release) do not produce any significant improvement in outcome in a clinical setting, partly due to the (too) short time window to
start such therapies. Modulation of later events, like
inflammation, could lead to successful neuroprotective
therapy [18]. However, in clinical trials, anti-inflammatory drugs have not yet shown the expected results
[20,21]. It is hypothesized that such discrepancies indicate that the neuroinflammatory response after stroke is
not entirely detrimental and that, without this response,
the damage would be even greater. Inflammation causes
cell death acutely, but in a later stage, it may help restore
body balance [24,25]. Or, vice versa, chronic inflammation can cause tissue damage as well. Therefore, it is
necessary to understand the detrimental and neuroprotective effects of each component of the neuroinflammatory response at different time points after ischemic
stroke. This will allow a more specific approach to
develop therapies targeting different aspects of neuroinflammation (see Table 1).

The neuroinflammatory response after ischemic
stroke
General

Cerebral ischemia leads to the activation of microglia and
astrocytes and subsequent production of inflammatory
mediators. Such molecules will increase the vulnerability
of neurons, cause blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption
and further stimulate gliosis. Consequently, more cell
damage and death will occur [7,26,27]. Furthermore,
cytokines stimulate the expression of adhesion molecules,

mediating the adherence and extravasation of neutrophils
and monocytes into the ischemic tissue [26]. Local production of chemokines attracts (via chemotaxis) extravasated leukocytes to the ischemic tissue (Figure 1)
[26,28,29].
Inflammatory mediators
Cytokines

Cytokines represent a family of pleiotropic polypeptides
(8-26 kDa) that regulate cell activation, proliferation and

differentiation [30,31]. Normally, cytokines in the brain
are hardly detectable. Their receptors are constitutively
expressed, albeit at very low levels. After brain injury,
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are quickly and
extensively upregulated [26,27,32]. However, the spatial
and temporal upregulation of cytokines and their receptors depends on the ischemic model used [33]. Proinflammatory cytokines stimulate and aggravate the
inflammatory response. The most prominent ones
after stroke are interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-6 [17,27,33]. On the other
hand, anti-inflammatory cytokines inhibit the expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce inflammation.
Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and IL-10
belong to this category and are most studied after
ischemic stroke [27,34]. Other cytokines contribute to
tissue damage or repair, but with less pronounced
effects than those mentioned. However, cytokines cannot unequivocally be divided into pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and may exert neurotoxic as well as
neuroprotective effects [12,30,34]. The balance between
deleterious and beneficial effects of cytokines will
depend on the physiological and biochemical context in
the brain [34].

Astrocyte

IL-1b A biphasic release pattern has been established
for this cytokine in transient as well as permanent MCA
occlusion (MCAo) models with a first peak 1 hour after
reperfusion and a second peak after 6-24 hours
[27,32,35]. Activated microglia account for the larger
part of the early production of IL-1b, followed by astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells [36]. Late expression
is due to an influx of inflammatory cells into the central
nervous system [35,37]. IL-1b is an endogenous pyrogen
which centrally will contribute to an exacerbation of
neuronal loss [1]. In the central nervous system, IL-1b
stimulates its own production and the expression of
other pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and
adhesion molecules. Secondly, IL-1b will contribute to
the activation and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes. Such a reaction will lead to the upregulation of
genes encoding for more neurotoxic mediators, creating
a spellbound damaging cycle. Thirdly, IL-1b will stimulate an influx of calcium into neurons, thereby increasing their vulnerability to ischemia. Finally, IL-1b induces
edema formation and primes the endothelium for leukocyte adherence [1,12,37-39]. But besides all these neurotoxic effects, even IL-1b can contribute to tissue
salvation. IL-1b stimulates the activation of astrocytes,

Figure 1 Schematic overview of the neuroinflammatory response after ischemic stroke. Microglia become activated after ischemia (grey
area) and release pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Astrocytes are activated as well and will neglect the maintenance of the neurons, which
are most vulnerable to ischemia, and produce neurotoxic and neurotrophic factors. In the ischemic core, neurons die due to necrosis and
release necrotic debris into the ischemic tissue, thereby stimulating further activation of glial cells. Astrocytes, together with the attachment of
astrocyte endfeet to endothelium and connection with neurons define the neurovascular unit. Neutrophils roll onto the endothelial surface
(which is primed by pro-inflammatory cytokines (blue and purple)) until they have slowed down to such a degree that they stick to the
endothelium. After binding of selectins to sialyl-Lewisx and CAMs to integrins, the neutrophils undergo conformational changes and flatten.
Subsequently, the neutrophils crawl on the endothelium to find an intercellular junction between the endothelial cells for extravasation to the
abluminal side and transmigration to the ischemic tissue under the influence of chemokines (red and yellow). Adapted from [26].

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74

which in their turn will produce survival-promoting factors [1,39]. Moreover, increases in IL-1b will lead to
increased levels of IL-1ra, an antagonist of IL-1b. The
temporal induction profile of IL-1ra after ischemia virtually parallels that of IL-1b which may suggest that the
balance between IL-1b and IL-1ra is more important
than the levels of IL-1b itself [18,39]. In permanent and
transient MCAo models, administration of IL-1ra
reduces tissue damage significantly [40-42]. Even if the
administration is delayed up to 3 hours after a 1-hour
MCAo, rats show a reduction of 60% in cortical lesion
volume [43]. A clinical phase II safety trial performed in
acute stroke patients with the recombinant methionylated form of human Il-1ra (Anakinra or Kineret®)
proved the product to be safe and improved functional
outcome [39,44]. Recently, a dose-ranging study has
been performed in stroke patients to assess if Anakinra
can easily cross the BBB and reach effective concentrations when administered intravenously. The results were
favorable and showed that IL-1ra can enter the CSF and
that the rate of entry can be modulated by altering the
administration regime [45]. If the right therapeutic window can now be determined in patients, this agent
might be a promising clinical effective neuroprotective
agent after stroke.
TNF-a Contrary to IL-1b, TNF-a is a more pleiotropic
cytokine with neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects
[46]. TNF-a also shows a biphasic release pattern with a
first peak 1-3 hours and a second peak 24-36 hours
after an ischemic insult [27,32,47]. However, it is important to make a distinction between soluble and membrane-bound TNF-a [48]. Activated microglia and
macrophages are major producers of soluble TNF-a
within the first 6 hours after cerebral ischemia [49-51].
Although IL-1b and TNF-a often work synergistically,
they are produced by non-overlapping subsets of microglia/macrophages. A maximum of 1.2% of microglia and
4.5% of macrophages co-express IL-1b and TNF-a
within the first day after a permanent MCAo [52].
Furthermore, TNF-a may show higher production rates
in certain regions (e.g. striatum) and, depending on the
region, TNF-a can either be detrimental or beneficial.
For example, TNF-a released in the striatum is considered to cause neurodegeneration, while release in the
hippocampus could promote neuroprotection [30].
TNF-a can potentiate excitotoxicity in vitro by inhibiting glutamate uptake [30,53,54]. It also activates glia,
thereby promoting its own production and that of other
neurotoxic mediators, leading to more oxidative outburst [50,53]. Such activation also boosts the production
of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, GDNF and
VEGF. Furthermore, TNF-a can increase neuronal vulnerability by stimulating intraneuronal calcium signaling
in vitro [55]. TNF-a also controls the (down-) regulation

Page 6 of 18

of extracellular calcium in astrocytes, thereby reducing
damage [30,56]. TNF-a stimulates apoptosis of endothelial cells and contributes to vasogenic edema and, due to
this BBB breakdown, infiltration of circulatory inflammatory cells are stimulated [57]. On the other hand,
TNF-a activates repair processes of the cerebral microvasculature and mediates neuronal plasticity [30]. Perhaps most importantly, TNF-a activates the NF-B
pathway that is involved in signaling cell death (apoptosis) as well as cell survival. NF-B will stimulate the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [30,53,58].
Ultimately, the balance between the two signals will
determine the toxic degree of TNF-a [12,30,54]. Several
hypotheses exist. One suggests that the detrimental
effects occur in the early phase of the inflammatory
response and the more beneficial effects in a later stage
[24]. Another hypothesis relates to the receptors to
which TNF-a binds. Soluble TNF-a (which binds to
TNF receptor 1) would cause primarily detrimental
effects whereas membrane bound TNF-a (which binds
to TNF receptor 2) would signal for neuroprotection
[33,59]. Other studies suggest that TNF-a can also be
neuroprotective by acting through TNF receptor 1
[48,50,60]. Whatever the case may be, research shows
that inhibition of TNF-a, using antibodies given at the
onset of reperfusion, reduces infarct volume after a 2hour MCAo, but only by 16% [41,47]. In contrast, mice
lacking both TNF receptors show increased infarct
volume after ischemic stroke [61], and administration of
TNF-a 48 hours prior to induction of MCAo results in
a neuroprotective effect. Thus, TNF-a can cause
ischemic tolerance and may stimulate tissue repair [41].
In conclusion, there is no consensus on the effect of
TNF-a after ischemic stroke. Neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects will depend on several factors such as the
extent of microglial activation in specific brain regions,
timing and threshold of TNF-a expression and of its
receptors and on the conditions that stimulate TNF-a
signaling [12,30]. It is important to know in which form
TNF-a is induced, in which cells, and on which receptor
it will act. For instance, TNF-a in neutrophils and
endothelial cells stimulate injury whereas in neurons it
is neuroprotective [62].
IL-6 IL-6 is detected 4 hours after stroke onset, with
peak concentrations after a day, and remains detectable
for up to 14 days [24,32,63]. Activated microglia, followed by astrocytes, neurons and invading cells of the
immune system, comprise the main source for IL-6
[24,35]. Like IL-1b, IL-6 is an endogenous pyrogen. It
helps to attract T-lymphocytes to the brain and will in
general contribute to an exacerbation of the inflammatory response. However, IL-6 can upregulate IL-1ra, and
IL-6-deficient mice do not show improved outcome
after stroke [12,26,64]. In clinical studies, IL-6 is often

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

suggested as a good marker to predict the severity of an
insult as high plasma levels correlate with the severity of
the stroke [65,66].
Anti-inflammatory cytokines Only two of the five different TGF-b cytokines are prominent after stroke; these
peak 6 hours after the onset of a lesion. TGF-b1 is primarily produced by activated microglia and macrophages, but some production is also visible in neurons
and T-cells [34,67]. TGF-b2 on the other hand is produced by astrocytes and neurons [68]. Generally, TGF-b
controls cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration [63,69]. More specifically
after stroke, it reduces glial activation, decreases the
expression and efficacy of other cytokines, suppresses
the release of harmful oxygen and nitrogen derived products, promotes angiogenesis in the penumbral area,
causes less brain edema with less neutrophil adherence
to endothelial cells, and stimulates the release of IL-1ra
[41,70]. However, as TGF-b1 can inhibit apoptosis of
neurons, but not necrosis, its possible protective influence is consequently limited to the penumbra. On the
other hand, TGF-b1 stimulates glial scar formation and
production of beta amyloid precursor, which can lead to
a higher risk of cognitive deficit. Although TGF-b works
on several inflammatory pathways simultaneously to
protect the brain, the endogenous concentration is too
low to inhibit serious damage after stroke. Administration of TGF-b before the induction of an ischemic insult
rescues neurons from cell death [33,69,71].
IL-10 is another constitutively expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine with peak levels 3 days after stroke
onset. The primary source is activated microglia and
astrocytes. IL-10 inhibits cytokine production and the
expression of their receptors and attenuates astrocytic
activation. IL-10 administration can reduce damage after
MCAo [12,27,34].
High-mobility group box (HMGB) protein family

Neuroinflammation can also be triggered by members of
the HMGB protein family, which are related to cytokines. They function as sentinels of cellular stress (e.g.
necrosis). HMGB proteins are ubiquitously expressed in
many cell types. Specific structures mediate their direct
binding to DNA and intracellular proteins (e.g. histones
and transcription factors) to regulate, among others,
DNA structure, repair and transcription [72,73].
HMGB1 is released in response to pathogen-associated
molecular patterns or cellular stress (e.g. stroke) and
functions as a pro-inflammatory cytokine [74,75]. It
translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or even
completely disappears from the cells within 1 hour after
induction of cerebral ischemia in mice [76,77]. HMGB1
is secreted by neurons and cells of the immune system
and passive release also occurs from necrotic cells [77].
Although apoptotic cells release only small amounts of

Page 7 of 18

HMGB1, the release of this compound by phagocytosis
of apoptotic cells cannot be underestimated [78]. The
effects of recombinant HMGB1 have been addressed in
vitro as well as in vivo. In glial cell cultures, HMGB1
induces the expression of iNOS, IL-1b and TNF-a; augments excitotoxicity-induced neuronal cell death and
induces microglial activation [79]. Microinjection of
HMGB1 into the cortex of mice results in increased
expression of iNOS and IL-1b [77]. Three cell surface
receptors can bind extracellular HMGB1 and activate
NF-B subsequently: Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4
and the receptor for advanced glycated end products
(RAGE). Binding of HMGB1 to RAGE also stimulates
chemotaxis [80-82]. A deficiency in these receptors
was observed in an MCAo model for cerebral stroke,
and this leads to increased infarct size [82]. A role for
HMGB1 in cerebral ischemia is indicated by the
observation that downregulation of HMGB1 by RNA
interference or by using neutralizing antibodies leads
to reduced infarct volume and suppression of microglial activation and neuroinflammation in rat and
mouse MCAo models [79,83]. In patients who suffer
cerebral ischemia, HMGB1 levels in the serum are
increased [84].
Chemokines

Chemokines are small (8-10 kDa), inducible molecules,
structurally and functionally related to cytokines, that
stand out because of their chemotactic activity for leukocytes [85-87]. There are 40 different known chemokines thus far, which all share a common structural
pattern with 4 cysteine residues, which leads to their
classification into 4 subfamilies of which 2 are important
after stroke: the C-X-C and C-C family [29,41,88]. The
C-X-C family attracts neutrophils and the C-C family
monocytes/macrophages [41,85]. Constitutively, chemokines and their receptors are expressed in very low concentrations [29,86]. Cytokines (especially IL-1b and
TNF-a) stimulate the production and release of specific
chemokines after cerebral ischemia, such as CINC (cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant), MCP-1
(monocyte chemoattractant 1), fractalkine, MRF-1
(microglial response factor-1) and MIP-1 (macrophage
inflammatory protein 1). These are upregulated in the
first 3 hours after ischemic stroke and remain high for
at least 6 hours [29]. The earliest part of the production
is ascribed to activated microglia, followed by astrocytes
and injured neurons [27,28]. However, depending on
cell type, other chemokines are upregulated. While neurons express fractalkine and MCP-1 after cerebral ischemia, microglia show increased expression of MIP-1-a,
MIP-2 and MRF-1 [33]. Furthermore, when reperfusion
is established, other chemokines, like IL-8, are upregulated as well [26,89]. Under normal conditions, chemokines control the positioning of cells in tissues and

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

recruit leukocytes to site of inflammation [87]. After
brain injury, chemokines serve as signals released into
the extracellular fluid and cerebrospinal fluid to recruit
microglia, neutrophils and monocytes (chemotaxis)
[7,29,33]. To achieve leukocyte recruitment, chemokines
co-operate with adhesion molecules and affect BBB permeability to ensure diapedesis through the vessel wall
[27-29]. Furthermore, chemokines stimulate apoptosis
and phagocytosis [28].
IL-8 is a major chemotactic cytokine in humans, but
has not been identified in rodents, only its equivalent
CINC. Inhibition of CINC, using antibodies, reduces
infarct size in a transient MCAo model when given
before (1 day) and upon reperfusion [89]. Blocking the
activity of MCP-1 with antibodies or MCP-1 deficiency
in mice reduces infarct size in transient and permanent
MCAo models [90,91]. Inhibiting the activity of MIP3-a reduces infarct size after transient MCAo [92].
Fractalkine-deficient mice provide neuroprotection in
transient (30 minutes to 2 hours) MCAo models
[33,93,94]. In general, transgenic mice overexpressing
chemokines show chronic neutrophil infiltration, continuous glial activation and BBB disruption. They ultimately die by a terminal wasting syndrome. Chemokine
knock-out mice, on the other hand, show deficiency in
leukocyte recruitment [29]. Therapy with a broad spectrum pan-chemokine inhibitor, given at the onset of
reperfusion, can reduce infarct volume by 50% after a
1-hour MCAo in rats [95]. These animals showed less
macrophage accumulation in the peri-infarct area, but
not in the core of the insult. This supports the hypothesis that inflammatory cells contribute to extended
damage to the penumbra [95].
Free oxygen radicals

Oxidative stress can damage the organism if the physiological balance between oxidants and anti-oxidants is
disrupted in favor of the former. Oxidative stress is
induced after cerebral ischemia by various pathways of
the ischemic cascade; especially inflammation and reperfusion increase the production of ROS [7]. The key radical after stroke is superoxide anion, produced by
xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase. OH• radicals are
increased 2 hours after stroke onset [96]. L-arginin is
transformed into nitric oxide (NO) via 3 types of NO
synthases: neuronal, endothelial and inducible (n-, e-,
iNOS respectively). These NOS are increased after brain
ischemia [7]. In rodents, eNOS is upregulated directly
whereas nNOS is upregulated a day after ischemia onset
and iNOS even later. In the core of the insult, production is seen in neutrophils and macrophages, while at
the margins of the infarct it is seen in microglia, blood
vessels and astrocytes [38,60,96]. NO has actually a dual
role. On the one hand, NO can reduce damage after
stroke by helping to restore blood supply to the

Page 8 of 18

ischemic area; on the other hand, NO can form radicals
by reacting, primarily with superoxide anion radical or
other molecules with free electrons, to form peroxynitrite [33]. These radicals contribute to lipid peroxidation
and protein biochemistry disruption by causing an
imbalance between signal transduction mechanisms and
cellular toxicity [33]. Furthermore, NO can stimulate
the expression of inflammatory mediators and adhesion
molecules, induce iron loss from cells, and inhibit
enzymes for DNA replication (causing DNA damage)
[97]. Which of these contradictory effects will prevail
depends on the concentration of NO, the sensitivity of
the cell type to NO and the difference between the
acute or chronic phase of inflammation [98]. Knock-out
mice for nNOS show reduced infarct volumes whereas
in knock-out mice for eNOS the injury after ischemic
stroke is increased [62,97]. This suggests that the early
production of NO from nNOS leads to tissue damage
while NO from eNOS has a protective function by dilating the vessels and thereby regulating blood flow to the
penumbra [99]. Depletion of iNOS has no effect on
infarct volume after 1 day, but it should be noted that
the increase in iNOS occurs at later time points
[62,96,97].
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)

MMPs are a group of at least 28 zinc-dependent endopeptidases that can proteolytically degrade a variety of
molecules that constitute the extracellular matrix components [100-102]. Physiologically, these proteases are
involved in tissue development, wound healing, bone
growth, ovulation and angiogenesis. After brain trauma,
MMPs are upregulated and activated after cleavage of
their pro-forms under influence of inflammatory mediators [103,104]. After a transient MCAo, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase-B) appear within 3
hours in the core and stay detectable up to 7 days
[16,100,101]. However, there are studies that report no
obvious increase of MMP-2 after ischemic stroke
compared to the observed constitutive expression
[24,38,62,104,105]. If MMP-2 is upregulated, it peaks
later. MMP-9 is first produced by endothelial cells and
neutrophils and later predominantly by macrophages
(after 5 days) [106]. Indeed, neutrophils contain and
degranulate gelatinase granules resulting in release of
pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 within a day after stroke onset
[107]. Although complete neutropenia can reduce the
increased levels of MMP-9 after transient MCAo, it cannot entirely abolish the upregulation after ischemic
stroke [108]. MMP-9 expression by endothelial cells
within and at the periphery of the ischemic lesion is
said to be the key mechanism by which the endothelial
wall is compromised [106]. The fact that MMP-2 and -9
degrade type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin,
which are major components of the basal lamina around

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

cerebral blood vessels and the extracellular matrix, will
certainly underpin this theory [10,38,101,106]. This
digestion starts as early as 2 hours after ischemia which
correlates with BBB breakdown 3 hours after ischemia
[16]. In patients, a correlation could be made between
the biphasic opening pattern of the BBB and the involvement of MMPs. In the early reversible opening (after
3 hours), there is an increase in plasma MMP-2. One to
2 days after ischemia, the severe and late opening of the
BBB correlates with increased MMP-9 [109]. However,
even such destructive molecules have some good qualities. It has been noticed that 7 days post-ischemia,
MMPs are involved in plasticity, recovery and repair
[109]. The late increase may aid in the migration of
macrophages into the ischemic lesion and contribute to
clearing of cellular debris [106,109]. Broad-spectrum
inhibitors of MMPs, such as BB-94 and KB-R7785,
administered after stroke onset, reduce damage after
permanent MCAo in mice by 26% [100,101]. This is
also combined with reduced BBB opening [110]. Such
treatments however, cause serious side effects due to
their low specificity and explain why these inhibitors
have not been used in clinical practice [47,103]. On that
account, more selective inhibitors or knock-out mice for
MMP-2 or -9 have been explored. MMP-2 knock-out
mice subjected to 2 hours occlusion show massive upregulation of MMP-9 and obviously no improvement
could be observed [111]. MMP-9 knock-out mice, on
the other hand, do show better outcome after ischemic
stroke [107,112,113], and inhibition of MMP-9 as late as
4 hours after ischemia onset decreases infarct size
[16,106]. A selective inhibitor for MMP-2 and -9 (SB3CT) in mice subjected to a 2-hour MCAo reduces
lesion size up to 6 hours after ischemia onset, and this
inhibitor is well tolerated in animals [103]. Additionally,
MMP levels in plasma could be a good biomarker to
predict the severity of stroke. In rats, levels of proMMP-9 and MMP-9 correlate with infarct volume [105].
Adhesion molecules

Adhesion molecules comprise three groups of molecules
that all serve one purpose: adherence and extravasation
of neutrophils and monocytes out of the blood vessel,
through the BBB into the ischemic tissue. Therefore,
some necessary bindings must occur: first selectins bind
to neutrophils and integrin receptors on neutrophils
bind to cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the
endothelial vessel wall [7,26,27].
Selectins

Selectins are membrane-bound glycoproteins [26]. There
are three selectins, characterized by a common sequence
and structural features, E- (endothelial), P- (platelet) and
L- (leukocyte) selectin [114]. Selectins bind to carbohydrate
residues (sialyl-Lewisx) on neutrophils and monocytes,

Page 9 of 18

thereby promoting a first binding to the endothelium
which is necessary to slow down neutrophils and monocytes and promote rolling over the endothelium during
the early stage of activation [26]. E-selectin is produced
by stimulated endothelium and leukocytes and P-selectin
also by platelets, hence the name. Stimulation occurs via
cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Four hours
after the onset of stroke and up to 70 hours after reperfusion, increased levels of E-selectin are noticed [26]. There
is a constitutive expression of P-selectin, although basal
levels almost escape routine detection. Due to preformed
pools of P-selectin in endothelial cells and platelets,
P-selectin can be upregulated quickly and faster than
E-selectin after stroke [26,115]. Looking at the temporal
profile of P-selectin, a biphasic release pattern can be distinguished with a first peak 15 minutes after the insult.
This then falls back to basal levels within 1 hour after the
insult. The second peak, at 6 hours after reperfusion in
transient MCAo models, is ascribed to new synthesis of
P-selectin protein [116,117]. Plasma levels of P-selectin
are often determined to assess the severity of an insult.
This is possible as there are actually 2 isoforms, one with
and one without a transmembrane region. The former is
expressed on the cell surface and will only be shed after
proteolysis while the latter is secreted directly into the
circulation from the preformed pools [115]. Inhibiting the
activity of P-selectin alone by treatment with monoclonal
antibodies (ARP 2-4, RMP-1) after the onset of the
insult, does not reduce the infarct volume significantly
[26,118-120]. This suggests that the involvement of
P-selectin in the inflammatory response after ischemic
injury starts early. The exact function of L-selectin is not
known. It is believed that it guides unstimulated leukocytes
to the endothelium to facilitate transmigration [26,27].
However, post-treatment with inhibitors of L-selectin
using monoclonal antibodies shows no improvement of
lesion size in rabbits subjected to 2 hours occlusion [121].
Inhibition of the binding of selectins to their ligands by
administration of a synthetic analogue of sialyl-Lewisx
reduced infarct volume after a transient MCAo, even
if it was given as late as 2 hours after onset of the
insult [119,122].
Cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs)

The CAMs belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily.
After stroke, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) -1
and -2, vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 will
contribute to the inflammatory response by attaching
neutrophils and monocytes more tightly to the endothelial wall for facilitating and even stimulating diapedesis
through the vessel wall to the site of injury [26,27,123].
These CAMs are constitutively expressed on cell membrane of endothelial cells, leukocytes, epithelial cells and
fibroblasts. Furthermore, higher levels are observed in

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

hypertensive than in normotensive rats [41]. After
trauma, inducible ICAM-1 is quickly upregulated, especially in the core of the insult [62]. The increases in
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 after stroke are influenced by IL1b and TNF-a [26,27,124]. ICAM-1 levels peak 12
hours after stroke onset and are maintained during 24
hours whereas VCAM-1 only peaks after a day in a 1hour MCAo model [24,27,123,124]. Soluble isoforms of
these adhesion molecules can be quantified in peripheral
blood after they have been shed from the surface of activated cells. In patients, VCAM-1 was increased up to 5
days after symptom onset while ICAM-2 and PECAM-1
were not increased after injury [123,124]. As these polypeptides contribute to aggravation of damage after
stroke, antibodies for these CAMs were evaluated.
Administration of a murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody (enlimomab) after a 2-hour MCAo resulted in a decrease in
infarct volume of 44% [125,126]. However, in permanent
occlusion models there was no such positive influence
of this treatment. Similar results were seen with antisense oligonucleotides for ICAM-1 [127]. These data
suggest that there is a need for reperfusion for activation
of the inflammatory response [126]. An anti-VCAM-1
monoclonal antibody was tested too, but showed no
reduction in infarct size after transient cerebral ischemia
in rodents [128]. In a phase III clinical trial, enlimomab
was given within 6 hours after symptom onset in cerebral ischemia and maintained over 4 days. Unfortunately, the treated group showed a 43% higher mortality,
possibly due to the murine origin of the antibody
[20,124,129]. Surprisingly, for PECAM-1, there is discussion about possible neuroprotective properties aside
from the neurotoxic ones. PECAM-1 knock-out mice
show facilitated leukocyte transendothelial migration
after histamine treatment which contradicts the current
hypothesis that PECAM-1 stimulates migration [123].
Integrins

CAMs bind to integrins on neutrophils and monocytes.
After stroke, CD18 or b2 integrins are activated; these
can be further divided into 3 different receptors with
the same b-chain, but 3 distinct different a-chains,
CD11a/CD18 (or LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (or Mac-1) and
CD11c/CD18. The first one primarily binds to ICAM-1
and -2, the second to ICAM-1 and the third to complement fragments [20,124,130]. LFA-1 or lymphocyte
function-associated antigen-1 is expressed on peripheral
blood lymphocytes [131]. Mac-1 or the leukocyte adhesion receptor macrophage-1 antigen is constitutively
expressed on leukocytes and is transformed into an activated conformation as well as quantitatively upregulated
on the endothelial cell surface after ischemia [130]. Physiologically, integrins connect endothelial cells to components of the underlying basal lamina [41,132]. CD18
integrin production can be influenced by cytokines

Page 10 of 18

(especially TNF-a), chemokines and the adhesion of
neutrophils to E-selectin [26,124,133]. Due to upregulation of LFA-1 and Mac-1 after stroke, more neutrophils
will adhere to the vessel wall and undergo the necessary
conformational changes to cross the BBB [133]. Therefore, research has focused on these integrins as potential
targets for stroke therapy. Mice with null mutations for
LFA-1, subjected to 1-hour occlusion, showed less leukocyte and platelet recruitment compared to their wild
types [129]. Mac-1-deficient mice or treatment with
monoclonal antibodies showed reduced infarct size after
a transient occlusion of 3 hours in mice, but this coincided with serious side effects including peripheral white
blood cell depletion [20,130]. A humanized anti-Mac-1
antibody (called Leukarrest) was evaluated in a phase III
clinical trial in which the agent was administered up to
12 hours after symptom onset. The trial showed no
improvement in treated subjects, possibly due to the
large time-window for treatment onset [20]. Research
was also performed with a humanized monoclonal antibody to all CD11/CD18 integrins. In rabbits, post-treatment with this antibody after a 2-hour occlusion
attenuates infarct size after the insult [20,134]. However,
no protection was observed in permanent occlusion
models [20,135].
Cellular inflammatory response

There is a hierarchy of vulnerability to ischemia. Unfortunately, neurons are the most vulnerable, followed by
astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells [38,136]. Not
only are other cells less vulnerable, they will also participate in and aggravate the inflammatory response,
thereby inducing mostly deleterious but also some beneficial effects [7,26,27].
Glia

Glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) are necessary to
support the central nervous system.
Microglia represent 5-20% of the total glial population
and are key modulators of the immune response in the
brain [137,138]. Their main characteristic is their sensitivity to changes. Quiescent resting microglia show a
ramified state characterized by a small cell soma and
extensive branches projecting out of the cell body
[2,33,139]. When a foreign aggressor occurs, microglia
change from this monitoring state to one of protection
and repair, characterized by an amoeboid form very
similar to macrophages and are therefore called “resident” macrophages. Using phagocytosis, microglia will
clear foreign organisms [27,33,137-140]. However, after
ischemia, this immune response turns on its own cells,
becomes destructive and will lead to cell damage. How
microglia become activated after ischemic stroke is still
not clear. A possible mechanism is rupture of necrotic
neurons in the core of the insult, leading to release of

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

their contents into the extracellular space and scavenging of these contents by microglia [4,141]. ROS play a
major part in the activation and proliferation of microglia [27]. The penumbra in particular is vulnerable to
microglial activation where this causes considerable secondary cell death [33]. Resident macrophages are
detected as soon as 2 hours after ischemia onset,
whereas blood-born macrophages do not enter the brain
before 10 hours. At 22-46 hours, blood-born as well as
resident macrophages are distributed over the entire
lesion and stay detectable up to 1 week after the insult
[13,14,32,52,137]. Microglia in the core of the insult survive the period of reduced blood flow if it does not
exceed 90 minutes of occlusion [142]. Nevertheless,
microglia/macrophages surrounding the ischemic tissue
will migrate toward the ischemic lesion and engage in
close contact with neurons ("capping”). As these neurons die later on, this capping ensures early recognition
and fast phagocytic removal of dying/dead neurons
[139,142]. Surprisingly, defective expression of LFA-1
eliminates the capacity of microglial cells to migrate
toward injured neurons [131]. In an activated state,
microglia will produce inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators contributing to cell damage and cell death. On
the other hand, microglia are a major producer of TGFb1 which supports the hypothesis that microglial activation is also neuroprotective [33]. There are some possible mechanisms supporting this theory. First of all,
microglia produce neurotrophic factors which stimulate
neurogenesis and plasticity. Secondly, phagocytosis of
neutrophils by activated microglia in the lesion prevents
the release of extra toxic mediators [2,143]. Finally, resident macrophages scavenge and remove necrotic debris
and harmful components. Indeed, these data suggest
that early activation is detrimental and later activation
beneficial [2]. Different subsets of microglia may have
different roles after ischemic stroke and thus improve or
reduce the chances of survival of ischemic neurons
[144]. Perhaps an ideal therapy should modulate the
microglial response in order to stimulate neurogenesis
[145]. Transgenic mice in which microglial proliferation
can be inhibited (eliminated) show increased infarct
volume (by 13%) after a 1-hour occlusion, which suggests that proliferating resident microglial cells exert a
neuroprotective role after ischemia [146].
Astrocytes are essential for the maintenance of the
central nervous system. They too will proliferate and
differentiate (astrogliosis) after stroke, which coincides
with increased production of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Astrogliosis can be potentially destructive
after an insult [12,27]. A massive astroglial response,
starting in the core of the lesion 4 hours after the
trauma, is observed up to 28 days after stroke onset in
the photothrombosis model [147]. However, 10 minutes

Page 11 of 18

of occlusion results in astrogliosis only after 1 day with
peak activity 4 days after the insult [69]. Astrocytes supply energy to neurons, produce precursors of neurotransmitters, form an anti-oxidative defense and secrete
neuroprotective and neurogenic factors. Their end-feet
form, together with the endothelial cells, the BBB and
thereby they contribute to the maintenance of the ionic
homeostasis [38,147,148]. Astrocytic activation leads to
the production of inflammatory mediators and cytotoxic
molecules (ROS, NOS, proteases, etc.) [138,147]. They
express high levels of chemokines and chemokine receptors, but it is not proven that astrocytes can migrate
toward these factors [86]. Glial scar tissue will replace
damaged tissue which has neurotoxic as well as neuroprotective effects. On the one hand, this barrier will prevent axonal ingrowth and reinnervation, thereby
impeding recovery. On the other hand, this barrier will
isolate the damaged tissue from viable tissue [147].
Endothelial cells and the blood-brain barrier (BBB)

The BBB comprises a ternary structure of endothelial
cells with tight junctions distinguishable from the more
fenestrated peripheral endothelium, followed by a basal
lamina, which is an extension of the extracellular matrix,
and finally the end-foot processes of astrocytes
[116,149]. The interconnection is mediated by integrins
[41]. This BBB is needed to maintain the fragile extracellular microenvironment via a twofold function. On
the one hand, it protects sensitive neurons from contact
with potentially toxic activated plasma proteases
[148,150]. On the other hand, the BBB ensures the supply of nutrients by specific transport systems [148]. To
improve understanding of the BBB and its effect on neurons, the hypothesis of a neurovascular unit was suggested. This consists of microvessels (with the above
mentioned ternary structure) that communicate with
astrocytes which in turn are connected to neurons and
their axons. Microglia contribute to the integrity of the
neurovascular unit. Adjacent neurovascular units communicate with each other [38,102]. After ischemia,
subtle or dynamical changes in BBB permeability occur
and can be transient or permanent depending on the
severity of the insult. The latter is characterized by
endothelial swelling, astrocyte detachment and blood
vessel rupture in the ischemic area while transient BBB
disruption shows endothelial hyperpermeability to
macromolecules in the peri-infarct area [151]. Transient
BBB disruption shows a biphasic pattern with an initial
opening 2-3 hours after the onset of the insult, while
24-48 hours after reperfusion a second opening occurs,
leading to vasogenic edema and increased intracranial
pressure [10,151]. Furthermore, production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules will be
stimulated. Such a disruption results in rapid but significant changes in the molecular relationship between

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

astrocytes and the microvascular extracellular matrix,
which has a feedback effect on the neurons they supply
and protect [132].
Leukocytes

Neutrophils invade ischemic tissue first, followed by
monocytes.
Five hours after reperfusion, neutrophils are already
present in damaged tissue [27,32]. In a permanent
MCAo model, neutrophils peak 12 hours after insult
onset [63]. Due to increased adhesion molecules after
stroke, neutrophils undergo conformational changes
(actually modifications in the cellular cytoskeleton) and
migrate through the endothelial vessel wall (diapedesis)
[26]. After this crossing, chemokines will attract neutrophils to ischemic tissue via a concentration gradient
(chemotaxis) [18,26,27,152]. Once there, neutrophils
contribute to secondary injury of potentially viable tissue by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and other
cytotoxic products (proteases, ROS, MMPs) [26,27,89].
The release of proteolytic enzymes damage endothelial
cell membranes and basal lamina, increases BBB permeability and contributes to post-ischemic edema.
Neutrophil activation can alter cerebral artery vasoreactivity [41]. Moreover, due to their adherence onto
the vessel wall, they create a secondary obstruction in
the cerebral microvasculature, called the no-reflow
phenomenon [18,26,153]. Inhibiting neutrophil infiltration does improve outcome, but only in transient
experimental stroke models [27,95]. Four to 6 hours
after invasion of neutrophils, monocytes adhere to vessel
walls as well and migrate into ischemic tissue with peak
activity 3-7 days after the onset of the insult [63,154].
These monocytes will replace the neutrophils [20,153].
When activated, they transform into blood-borne
macrophages. On the one hand, macrophages generate
superoxide anions, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines
and create a pro-thrombotic environment, while on
the other hand, phagocytosis will remove necrotic cell
debris and neutrophils [20].

Hypothermia
As stroke is a multi-faceted phenomenon, a neuroprotective approach of choice should act on several levels
of the ischemic cascade. With respect to inflammation,
toxic effects should be inhibited while the associated
repair mechanisms should be stimulated. Moderate (3032°C) to mild (32-34°C) hypothermia could be a good
option, as it acts on several pathways of the ischemic
cascade and exerts differential effects on the inflammatory response at different time points [23]. Indeed, data
from the literature indicate that stimulating and inhibiting effects may be involved in the neuroprotective
effects of hypothermia. In cardiac arrest, hypothermia
has already proven to be neuroprotective in a clinical

Page 12 of 18

setting [155]. Furthermore, in experimental models of
transient cerebral ischemia, moderate-to-mild hypothermia can reduce infarct volume by more than 50%
[156,157]. However, in permanent MCAo models the
effect is less clear.
Fever occurs often after ischemic stroke and increases
cell damage and cell death [158]. If hypothermia is
induced, more neurons survive the ischemic period
[159]. However, the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia is not yet fully elucidated. Hypothermia has no
effect on the cerebral blood flow in the penumbra during ischemia, but can block hyperperfusion after
ischemic insult [23,160]. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia cannot be explained by solely
a reduction in cerebral metabolic demand or glutamate
release as hypothermia still reduces infarct volume when
initiated in the subacute phase of the ischemic cascade,
when the initial increase in glutamate has already passed
[156,161,162]. Consequently, hypothermia affects several
pathways.
Hypothermia has effects on the neuroinflammatory
response. Unlike anti-inflammatory drugs, hypothermia
exerts both stimulating and inhibiting effects on the
inflammatory response (see table 1). Hypothermia
reduces the increase of IL-1b after stroke [153,162-164].
It would be interesting to know what a combination of
hypothermia with IL-1ra could accomplish. While there
is no consensus on the role of TNF-a after stroke, there
is also as of yet no consensus on the effect of hypothermia on TNF-a. Most studies show a reduction of TNFa after hypothermic treatment. More interesting is that
mild hypothermia can also influence the expression of
TNF-a receptors and the activation of NF-B [23,165].
Hypothermia can reduce the increased expression of
TNF receptor 1 as early as 15 minutes after traumatic
brain injury [165]. This receptor could be associated
with detrimental effects after brain injury. It would be
interesting to know if hypothermia also decreases the
expression of TNF receptor 2. A recent study using a
transient MCAo model showed that pre- as well as
post-ischemic hypothermia is able to attenuate HMGB1
protein levels in brain and plasma [166]. However, little
literature exists regarding the influence of hypothermia
on the expression of the main receptors of HMGB1.
TNF receptors and TLRs are known to primarily mediate activation of NF-B. Indeed, hypothermia has antiapoptotic effects that could also be mediated by affecting NF-B [96,153,157]. In normal conditions, NF-B is
present in the cytoplasm, but is bound to a family of
inhibiting proteins. To become activated, IB kinase
must phosphorylate these inhibiting proteins to liberate
NF-B and let it enter the nucleus and induce gene
expression [153,167]. In a 2-hour MCAo model,
increased NF-B binding was observed as early as 2

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/7/1/74

hours after ischemia. Intra- and post-ischemic hypothermia was able to reduce IB kinase expression, resulting
in less NFB translocation which could be the result of
two pathways [153,167,168]: (1) hypothermia may
directly influence the expression of IB kinase, or (2)
cells that are protected by hypothermia may influence
surrounding cells by releasing fewer inflammatory stimuli [167]. Inhibition of NF-B activation could be key
to the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia, but it
should be taken into account that NF-B also exerts
anti-apoptotic effects. Indeed, there are conflicting
reports on this subject as both increases and decreases
in ischemic injury have been observed when inhibiting
the activity of NF-B [167-169]. Ultimately, it will be
the balance between type I and type II TNF-a receptor
expression and the signaling pathways involved that will
determine the outcome [170]. Chemokines are reduced
by hypothermic treatment. Recently, a study showed
downregulation of MCP-1 after application of mild
hypothermia in vitro [92]. However, these results need
to be confirmed in vivo. Hypothermia can suppress oxidative stress after an insult. Superoxide anion radical
production is attenuated by a post-ischemic moderate
hypothermic treatment [166]. These results also confirm
earlier findings that hypothermia reduces the production
of hydroxyl radicals after a transient MCAo in rats [96].
Further research has shown that post- but not intraischemic hypothermia reduces the release of superoxide
anions, as most ROS are only produced in the reperfusion phase [171]. Concerning NOS, it has been shown
that hypothermia decreases nNOS by 50% in the
penumbra, while no effect is seen on iNOS [96]. Intraischemic mild hypothermia reduces expression of MMP9 in rats subjected to 2 hours of MCAo [104]. There is
no effect on MMP-2, neither after stroke nor after
hypothermic treatment up to 24 hours after the insult
[104]. Also, MMP-9 expression is low in patients after
hypothermia, which could suggest a temperature sensitivity of MMPs [172]. In vitro studies show that
hypothermia can reversibly inhibit E-selectin, without
affecting L-selectin [173,174]. Furthermore, 2 hours of
mild post-ischemic hypothermia reduces ICAM-1 levels
in brain and plasma for up to 7 days after 2 hours of
MCAo [162,166,175]. In vitro, as well as in patients with
cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia influences integrin expression. Hypothermia (27°C) delays upregulation
of Mac-1 and CD11c, but has no effect on LFA-1
[174,176]. Hypothermia can inhibit but possibly only
delay glial activation [177,178]. Hypothermia appears to
decrease tissue density of microglia/macrophages and to
inhibit microglial activation. This inhibition leads to a
54% reduction in microglial activation after 3 days if
intra- or early post-ischemic hypothermic treatment in
rats (subjected to a 2-hour MCAo) is maintained for

Page 13 of 18

2 hours [153,162,168,179]. However, as the phagocytic
activity of activated microglia and macrophages exerts
beneficial effects in the long term, such parameters
should be studied at later time points after the induction of hypothermia. Hypothermia also reduces BBB
disruption occurring after stroke, which especially has
implications for the passage of large molecules. Permeability to small molecules remains for at least 4 days
post-injury [180]. Infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes can be reduced after transient MCAo with postischemic mild hypothermic treatment at 3 and 7 days
post-injury [162]. This reduction can increase to
approximately 75% if the hypothermic treatment is
started 1-2 hours after a MCAo of 2 hours [157]. Similar results have been observed in other traumatic
injury models [181].
Mild-to-moderate intra-ischemic hypothermia has a
pan-inhibiting effect [23,182]. It reduces ATP depletion,
anoxic depolarization, glutamate release, and apoptosis;
maintains BBB integrity, inhibits white matter injury and
blocks necrosis (if started during ischemia itself)
[23,160,183]. The effects of hypothermia on inflammation show a more modulating response. However,
hypothermia has been suggested to only delay neuronal
damage rather than to provide permanent protection.
Seven hours after a hypothermic treatment, a hyperthermic episode has been described which may revive or reinitiate pathophysiological mediators which had been
quiet [159]. The challenge in hypothermic treatment is
thus to know when to start cooling, how long to maintain it and how deep to cool. Deep cooling has no
advantage over mild or moderate hypothermia, and
actually causes more side effects [157]. Furthermore, a
distinction has to be made between short and long cooling periods. It has been suggested that the disadvantages
of delayed cooling could be overcome by performing a
prolonged hypothermic protocol [22,182]. However, the
modulating influence of hypothermia on neuroinflammation could also differ depending on these parameters
and should be further investigated [184]. Depth, start of
cooling and duration all influence outcome in both
experimental and clinical settings, and make translation
to the clinic difficult [185].

Conclusions
The neuroinflammatory response after ischemic stroke
involves several parameters, all connected with each
other and connected to other pathways of the ischemic
cascade. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions
from research observations and to extrapolate them to
clinical settings, because a limited number of differences
between man and animal models may affect multiple
levels of the inflammatory response. Many inflammatory
components have neurotoxic as well as neuroprotective

Ceulemans et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:74

effects that may either stimulate or reduce cell damage
after ischemic stroke. Inhibition of only one part of the
neuroinflammatory response after ischemic stroke does
not induce sufficient protection to improve recovery in
patients. There is sufficient data that hypothermia acts
at multiple levels of the ischemic cascade and of the
neuroinflammatory response, and does not simply inhibit all processes induced by cerebral ischemia. It should
be noted that hypothermia influences the expression of
several inflammatory parameters at certain time points,
but more research is required to discern which positive
or negative effects contribute to neuroprotection. The
ability of hypothermia to modulate many aspects of
the inflammatory response may render translation to the
clinic feasible. Another advantage of hypothermia could
be the creation of a larger therapeutic time window to
administer other neuroprotective agents and thus
improve outcome after transient focal cerebral ischemia.
