Abstract
Background: The distribution of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) varies greatly across populations
and HPV surveys have been performed in different geographical regions in order to apply
appropriate vaccine strategies. Little information, however, exists regarding HPV genotypes
distribution in immigrant women from countries at high incidence for cervical cancer. The aim of
this study was to determine the spectrum of HPVs and their variants among HIV-positive and HIVnegative women immigrants in South Italy mainly from West Africa and with a history of
prostitution.
Results: Cervical cytological samples have been collected from 14 HIV-positive and 31 HIVnegative immigrants (38 out of 45 were born in Nigeria), attending a gynecological outpatient clinic
in the Campania region. Human papillomaviruses were detected by broad spectrum consensusprimer-pairs MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+-based polymerase chain reaction and characterized by
nucleotide sequence analysis. Altogether, 42.2% (19/45) of samples were HPV positive with
detection rates of 57.1% (8/14) in HIV-positive and 35.5% (11/31) in HIV-negative women. Among
the twelve different viral genotypes identified, HPV33, 58, 70 and 81 were the prevalent genotypes
with a frequency of 6.7% each, followed by HPV16, 35, 42, 54, 31, 52, 56 and 67, in descending
order of prevalence. Sequence homology studies performed on the L1 amplified fragments of
HPV16, 52 and 58 isolates allowed the identification of nucleotide changes distinctive of nonEuropean variants.
Conclusion: The overall HPV prevalence (42.2%) was high in this immigrant women group with
the most common viral types other than HPV16 and 18, against which current vaccine strategies
have been developed. The distribution of HPV genotypes and their variants in high-risk immigrants
reflects that of their original countries. The surveillance of risk groups that may act as viral
reservoirs of uncommon genotypes within different countries are necessary to determine the
severity of HPV infection with the different viral types and to monitor a possible shift of prevalent
strains following vaccination.

Background
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are common pathogens
associated with benign and malignant neoplasia of
mucosal and cutaneous epithelia [1,2]. To date more than
100 HPV genotypes have been identified and at least 50
are known to infect the female anogenital tract [3,4].
Among these thirteen mucosotropic HPVs (types 16, 18,
31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 66) have been
recently classified as class I carcinogens to human beings
[5]. Several others types, however, need further studies
being proposed as high risk viruses on the basis of 1)
molecular phylogenetic relatedness to carcinogenic genotypes [3,6]; 2) epidemiological studies on the association
with cervical cancer worldwide [7]; and 3) the in vitro biological properties [8]. The prevalence of HPV genotypes in
cervical cytological samples varies greatly in different geographical regions and show a strong correlation with cervical cancer incidence [9-12]. The population-based HPV
surveys coordinated by the International Agency for
research on Cancer (IARC) reported that Nigeria had the
highest prevalence of all HPV types and Europe the lowest, with nearly 20-fold variation between Nigeria
(22.6%) and Spain (1.4%) [9,13,14]. The HPV type 16,
although with different prevalence rates, is the most common viral type being present in 12.3%, 18.4%, 21.4% and
25.5% of HPV-positive cytological normal women from
Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria), Asia, South America, and
Europe, respectively [9]. Other mucosal HPVs are differently distributed in various geographical regions
[9,15,16]. Factors that influence the prevalence rate of
specific HPV types and eventually the outcome of cervical
cancers are not clearly understood. However, it is well
known that HPVs present well conserved genomic variants distinctive of geographical origin/population ethnicity [17]. The most extensively studied HPV16 variants
cluster within five phylogenetic branches classified as
European, Asian, Asian-American, African 1 and 2 variants [18-27], which differ in their biological properties
and in their oncogenic potential [8,25,26,28]. Similar
data have been described for HPV31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and
58, which can be grouped in several branches differing in
geographic distribution, and in relative prevalence within
different ethnical groups [29-31]. Genomic variants can
be considered markers of specific HPV genomes and
accordingly can be used in epidemiological and etiological studies to investigate transmission of HPV within and
between populations [32].
The recent success of HPV16 and 18-based prophylactic
vaccines in preventing persistent viral infections and HPVassociated cervical lesions is encouraging [33,34]. The vast
heterogeneity of HPV infections, however, would require
the development of vaccines targeting specific HPV types
prevalent in a given population. Thus, extended analyses
of type-specific HPVs in high risk populations will con-

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/1

tribute to design appropriate large-scale screening tests
and multivalent vaccine design strategies.
Several epidemiological studies have been performed
among Italian women reporting the HPV type prevalence
in cytological normal women, in low grade and high
grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, in cervical cancer
patients and in HIV-positive women [35-38]. All of them
indicate that HPV16 is the most prevalent genotype in all
analyzed patient's groups and that less common genotypes have an increased prevalence mainly in HIV-positive
women [37].
No studies have been performed in Italy on the prevalence
of HPV types in immigrant women with diverse risk profiles. The goal of the current study was to analyze HIV-positive and HIV-negative immigrant women, mainly from
sub-Saharan Africa and with a history of prostitution, and
to describe the prevalence of HPV genotypes and their variants in order to identify viral types that are spreading
trough population mobility.

Methods
Study population and samples
This study enrolled 45 women attending the outpatient
Unit of Obstetric and Gynecology Clinic of Pineta Grande
Hospital from January through October 2004. This Hospital serves the highest number of long and short term
immigrants in Campania region (Southern Italy). All
women with sufficient Italian or English language skills,
who voluntarily gave their consent to participate in the
study, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire
on reason for the visit, demographic characteristics and
sexual behaviors. Fifteen women attended the clinic for
prenatal care early in pregnancy, five for post-partum follow-up and 25 for routine gynecological care or various
gynecological disorders including sexual transmitted diseases (STDs).

The cervical cell scrapings were collected with a cytobrush
from the ecto- and endocervix of each woman. After
spreading of cells on slides (Pap smears), the remaining
cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) and
stored at -20°C until analysis. Cytological evaluation of
Pap smears, according to the 2001 Bethesda System,
revealed two low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(LSIL) and 43 normal samples.
The study protocol was approved by the local ethical
review board of authors' Institutions.
HPV PCR amplifications
Genomic DNA was extracted from cervical-scraping cell
lysates according to published procedures. In particular,

Page 2 of 9

Infectious Agents and Cancer 2007, 2:1

samples were digested with Proteinase K (150 μg per ml at
60°C for 30 min) in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS), followed by DNA purification by phenol and phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and Ethanol
precipitation in 0.3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 4.6).
DNA quality test, performed by amplification with specific oligoprimers targeting a fragment of the exon 7
within the TP53 gene [28,39], and DNA quantity analysis,
evaluated by spectro-photometric measurements, rendered all 45 samples suitable for viral DNA analysis.
HPV detection was performed by 1) single round PCR
using the degenerated oligoprimers MY09/MY11 as previously described [40]; and 2) nested PCR methodology
using as outer pair MY09/MY11 and as inner GP5+/GP6+
oligoprimers [41]. Both outer and inner PCR amplification reactions were performed in 50 μl reaction mixture
containing 20 pmoles of each primer, 50 mM KCl, 3.75
mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.1% Triton X-100,
50 mM of each dNTP and 1.8 units of thermostable AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applera, Courtaboeuf, France).
For the first-amplification step of nested PCR, 5 μl of DNA
(10 to 500 ng) was used as target DNA (outer reaction); in
the second step PCR, 5 μl of the first step was used as input
of amplified DNA (inner reaction). MY09/MY11 outer
amplification reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer
GeneAmp PCR System 9600 thermal cycler with the following steps: an initial 1-min denaturation at 94°C, followed by 32 cycles of 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min,
94°C for 30 s, and a final annealing at 55°C for 1 min
with 5-min elongation at 72°C. GP5+/GP6+ inner amplification reactions were performed with an initial 1-min
denaturation at 94°C followed by 40 cycles of 40°C for 1
min, 72°C for 1 min, 94°C for 1 min, and a final annealing of 40°C for 1 min followed by 4-min elongation at
72°C. A sample was considered HPV positive if one of the
two amplification methods was positive, and negative if
all tests were negative. Six plasmid clones containing
HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 have been used as positive
controls. To determine the sensitivity of both the single
round MY09/MY11 PCR and the MY09/MY11-GP5+/
GP6+ nested PCR, plasmid series of 10-fold dilutions
(from 1000 to 1 copy/reaction) were tested by PCR. The
detection limits of HPV16 and 31, were 1000 copies, with
single round PCR, and 100 copies with nested PCR. The
remaining four viral types were detected at 100 copies,
with single round PCR, and 10 copies with nested PCR.
These results are in agreement with the detection limits
observed for mucosal HPVs following PCR amplification
with the commonly used MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+
oligoprimers [42]. Reaction mixtures without template
DNA, included in every set of 5 clinical specimens, represented the negative controls.

HPV DNA sequence analysis
HPV genotypes were identified by direct sequence analyses of single round MY09/MY11 amplified DNA and/or
GP5+/GP6+ nested PCR amplified products obtained
from each HPV-positive sample as previously described
[38]. PCR products were extracted with phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and purified by precipitation at
37°C for 15 min in 1.25 M NaCl and 20% polyethylene
glycol (PEG 6000) [43]. Purified DNA samples were subjected to direct nucleotide sequencing using a rapid
method modified from Winship [44]. Briefly, DNA samples (30 ng to 100 ng) were denatured at 95°C, in presence of 10% DMSO, immediately cooled in liquid
nitrogen and subsequently sequenced with the Sequenase
2.0 kit according to manufacturer's instructions (GE
Healthcare) modified in the labeling step (3 min on ice).
HPV type identification was performed by alignments of
HPV sequences with those present in the GenBank database using the BLASTn software [45].

Two MY09/MY11 and three GP5+/GP6+ amplified DNA
samples showing sequence patterns compatible with multiple infections have been subcloned in SmaI pBS-minus
vector (Stratagene) and subjected to sequence analysis following procedures previously described [43].
HPV variants were searched by direct sequence analyses of
MY09/MY11 amplified products (>400 bp long) obtained
from each sample with a single HPV infection. The common sequence analysis limitation of low DNA amount
obtained in some samples(< 50 ng) with single round
MY09/MY11 PCR was circumvented by the use of AmpliCycle sequencing kit following the manufacturer's protocol of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applera, Courtaboeuf,
France), specific for 0.5 ng to 30 ng of PCR products. Two
viral variants, amplified from samples containing multiple infections, have been characterized following subcloning into pBS-minus vector.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by multiple
sequence alignments of the 5' region of L1 genes from different HPV isolates with MegAlign program of the Lasergene software (DNASTAR Inc., 1994).
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using χ2 test and, where appropriate, Fisher's exact test to calculate all P values related to the
differences between groups with Epi Info 6 Statistical
Analysis System Software (6.04b, 1997, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA). Differences were considered to be statistically significant when P values were
less than 0.05.

Results
Characteristics of study population
In this study 45 randomly selected immigrant women (38
out of 45 were born in Nigeria) attending the gynecological outpatient unit of Pineta Grande Hospital in the Campania region have been enrolled from January through
October 2004. Cervical cytological samples have been collected from all women consenting to the study after the
administration of a standardized questionnaire regarding
their life style and sexual activity. The selected demographic characteristics of the 14 HIV-positive and the 31
HIV-negative women have been reported in Table 1. The
mean age was 29.48 (+/- 3.63) years for the HIV-positive
and 28.85 (+/- 3.82) years for the HIV-negative women;
55.5% (25 out of 45) of the women reported past and/or
current sexual risk behavior (i.e. history of prostitution).
Prevalence of HPV infection and genotypes
All 45 samples have been analyzed by single round PCR
using MY09/MY11 oligoprimers and samples negative or
weakly positive for viral sequences have been subjected to
nested PCR, using GP5+/GP6+ as inner oligoprimers.
Overall, HPV sequences were amplified in 42.2% (19/45)
of the samples with detection rates of 57.1% (8/14) in
HIV-positive and 35.5% (11/31) in HIV-negative women
(P = 0.1732). Fifteen subjects (60%) among the 25 reporting to have had sexual risk behavior tested positive for
HPV sequences (P = 0.0165). Only 4 (20.0%) of the 20
women, without sexual risks behavior, were positive for
HPV (Table 2). Distinct HPV genotypes have been identified by sequence analysis of MY09/MY11 or GP5+/GP6+
amplified products and by alignments of HPV sequences
with those present in the GenBank database. Among the
twelve different HPV types identified seven (HPV16, 31,
33, 35, 52, 56, 58) belong to the HPV virus group recently
defined as class I carcinogenic to humans [5]. The HPV
types 33 (6.7%), 58 (6.7%), 70 (6.7%) and 81 (6.7%)
were the prevalent types as single infections followed by
HPV16, 35, 42, 54, 31, 52, 56 and 67, in descending order
of prevalence (Table 3). Multiple-type infections
accounted for 26.3% of the HPV-infected women with no
significant frequency difference between HIV-positive and
HIV-negative subjects.
Identification and analysis of HPV variants
Sequence homology studies performed on the MY09/
MY11 amplified regions of HPV16, 52 and 58 isolates
allowed the identification of nucleotide changes distinctive of non-European viral variants. Table 4 presents a
nucleotide comparison with the corresponding HPV reference sequences of six different viral isolates under study.
The HPV16 sequence obtained from the DF-23 Nigerian
sample is the only isolate 100% homologous to reference
clone (European variant). The HPV16 sequence of the isolate DF-124, instead, shows seven nucleotide changes at

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/1

positions 6695 (A to C), 6721 (G to A), 6853 (C to T),
6865 (C to T), 6970 (C to T), 6994 (G to A), and 7060 (G
to T) which characterize HPV16 African 2 phylogenetic
branch and have been previously identified in viral isolates from Africa [18,46], but not in the Italian population
[28].
The nucleotide sequence of one HPV52 viral isolate
amplified from an Uruguayan sample, compared to the
reference genome obtained from a North American
women [28,47], showed seven nucleotide changes at
nucleotide positions 6703 (A to C), 6711 (A to G), 6712
(G to A), 6917 (C to A), 6920 (T to G), 6935 T to A and
6941 (A to G), which have been previously reported in
one sample from Panama [48] and one from Brazil [29].
Although the total number of HPV52 variant lineages and
their geographical distribution has not yet been defined,
our observation together with previous reports allow to
postulate that the nucleotide changes common to isolates
from Uruguay, Panama and Brazil could define a South
American HPV52 lineage.
The sequence analysis of HPV58 isolates allowed the identification of four nucleotide changes at positions 6798 (G
to A), 6822 (G to A), 6827 (C to A), 6828 (A to G), common to all three analyzed viral isolates and previously
described in HPV58 samples from Mali and Brazil [4850]; the nucleotide change at position 6688 (C to A) was
present only in the Ethiopian sample DF-19 and has been
previously reported in one HPV58 isolate from Brazil
[50]; four nucleotide changes identified at positions 6692
(G to A) and 6711 (G to A), in the Nigerian samples DF03 and DF-9, and at positions 6697 (G to A) and 7016 (A
to G) identified only in the sample DF-09 have been previously reported in samples from Mali and Brazil [48,50];
the newly identified variations at position 6696 (G to A)
has been observed only in the sample DF-03 and was
present in all 5 plasmid clones selected for sequence analysis indicating that was not a PCR artifact. The pattern of
MY09/MY11 HPV58 nucleotide changes previously identified in samples from Mali and Brazil, and also found in
the African HPV58 isolates from this study, is compatible
with the co-existence of at least two variant lineages in
African and South American samples.

Discussion
The prevalence of type specific HPVs and their variants has
been analyzed in randomly selected immigrant women,
mostly from Nigeria, living in Campania region. Viral
infections have been detected by PCR using the MY09/
MY11 oligoprimers alone or followed by nested PCR with
GP5+/GP6+ primer pairs. Genotyping and variant characterization has been performed by direct sequencing analysis of PCR products. Samples which appeared to contain
multiple infections for a mixed-sequence pattern were

subcloned and nucleotide sequence has obtained from
individual clones. The nested PCR method, performed
with MY09/MY11, as outer primer pairs, and GP5+/GP6+,
as inner primer pairs, has been previously shown to be significantly more sensitive (P < 0.001) for detection of all
mucosal HPV genotypes and allows the identification of
some HPV types, such as HPV30 and 70, not detected by
either MY09/MY11 nor GP5+/GP6+ alone [38]. A total of
twelve viral genotypes were identified including viral
types (HPV16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 56 and 58) recently defined
as class I oncogenic agents to human beings, and five low
risk/undetermined risk viruses (HPV42, 54, 67, 70 and
81). The HPV prevalence of 35.5% observed among the
HIV-negative immigrants, with an overall 42.2% independent from the HIV status, is higher than the HPV prevalence of 26.3% in Nigeria [13], and comparable to the
prevalence of 40% in rural Mozambique [51], of 31% in
Harare, Zimbabwe [16], and of 44% in Nairobi, Kenya

[52]. As in most previous studies [13,16,51,52], also multiple HPV infections have been found in a substantial fraction of HPV positive women (11.1%).
Moreover, 31.1% of the women analyzed in this study
were HIV positive, and this value is much higher than HIV
prevalence of 22.6% among female sex workers in Ibadan
(Nigeria), as reported by the UNAIDS HIV Surveillance
[53].
Several reports pointed out the possibility of certain HPV
types being more common in sub-Saharan African
women than elsewhere. HPV35, for instance, was slightly
more common than HPV16 in Mozambique both in
women with normal cytology and in those with highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse [51].
HPV52 was found slightly more frequently than HPV16 or
HPV35 in Kenya [52] and in colposcopically normal

women in Zimbabwe [16]. In Nigeria HPV16 and 35 were
the most common high risk types detected in normal and
dysplatic lesions, followed by HPV31, 58, and 56 [13]. In
the present study when the frequency of HPV types both
in single and multiple infections were combined, HPV33,
58, 70 and 81 represented each 6.7% of infections followed by HPV16, 35, 42 and 54 (4.4% each type). The
HPV70, which was epidemiological classified as a low risk
type on the basis of its detection in two cases and two controls in a large study performed in nine countries [7], has
been previously reported as single infection in cervical carcinomas from Asia (China) [54], Japan [55] and Thailand
[56]), South America (Mexico [57], and Peru [58]); and in
high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in Italy [38].
Recently it has been shown by in vitro studies that HPV70
together with 53 and 82, which are phylogenetically
related to high risk viruses, are indistinguishable with
respect to their ability to degrade p53 and to immortalize
keratinocytes, suggesting the need to monitor this HPV
types in more extended epidemiological studies [8].

can be identified in different ethnic groups from different
geographical regions [29,48,50].

Phylogenetic studies of HPV16, 18, and the less prevalent
HPV types 31, 33, 35, 52, 58, and 67, obtained from different geographical regions, showed that specific variants

Although this study has the limitation to include a relatively low number of women, due to the low participation
rate, it clearly shows that migrant women carries the viral

In this study only one HPV isolate out of six, analyzed
within the MY09/MY11 region, presented homology with
the reference sequence of the corresponding genotype. A
second HPV16 isolate obtained from a Nigerian woman
showed nucleotide signatures distinctive of HPV16 African 2 lineage, which was never detected in the Italian population. The single HPV52 isolate obtained from an
Uruguayan woman, showed nucleotide changes specific
of viral variants previously identified in samples from
Panama and Brazil [28,29,48,48]. Furthermore, three
HPV58 isolates, one obtained from an Ethiopian and two
from Nigerian women, were homologous to two distinct
viral variants previously identified in Mali and Brazil [48].
The presence of similar multiple HPV variants in African
and South-American geographical regions can be
explained by the extensive African immigration to Brazil
during the colonization of the American continent.

HPV52

Nucleotide positions, written vertically across the top, refer to nucleotide changes detected within MY09/MY11 L1 regions of HPV16, 52 and 58.
Absence of genetic variations relative to the reference HPV type are marked with dashes, whereas presence of variant nucleotides are indicated by
the nucleotide corresponding letter. Within each panel, the first column lists the variants identified in the present study (DF-09; DF-19; DF-23; DF32; DF-124) and those previously described (Bsb-02 and Bsb-08 [44]; IS404, IS417 and IS464 [42]; BR0258 and HK1151 [26]; Z-1194 [59]) with the
GeneBank accession number given in parenthesis.

types and their variants present in their original countries,
with possible implications in the spreading of uncommon
HPV genotypes in the resident populations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the immigrant women analyzed in this
study, mainly of African origin and with sexual risk behavior, have a high HPV prevalence with the most common
viral types other than HPV16 and 18, against which current vaccine strategies have been developed. Wide popula-

tion based epidemiological studies, including the
surveillance of risk groups that may act as niches of
uncommon viral types and their variants, are necessary,
particularly in countries like Italy with high immigration
rates, to monitor eventual spreading of uncommon genotypes for vaccine considerations.
