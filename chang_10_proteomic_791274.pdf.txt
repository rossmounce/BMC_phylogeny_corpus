Abstract
Background: Restoration of rooting competence is important for rejuvenation in Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don)
Endl and is achieved by repeatedly grafting Sequoia shoots after 16 and 30 years of cultivation in vitro.
Results: Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis revealed three proteins that differentially accumulated in
different rejuvenation stages, including oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 2 (OEE2), glycine-rich RNA-binding
protein (RNP), and a thaumatin-like protein. OEE2 was found to be phosphorylated and a phosphopeptide
(YEDNFDGNSNVSVMVpTPpTDK) was identified. Specifically, the protein levels of OEE2 increased as a result of
grafting and displayed a higher abundance in plants during the juvenile and rejuvenated stages. Additionally,
SsOEE2 displayed the highest expression levels in Sequoia shoots during the juvenile stage and less expression
during the adult stage. The expression levels also steadily increased during grafting.
Conclusion: Our results indicate a positive correlation between the gene and protein expression patterns of
SsOEE2 and the rejuvenation process, suggesting that this gene is involved in the rejuvenation of Sequoia
sempervirens.

Background
Plant maturation involves sequential developmental stages
or phases that can be categorized as embryo, juvenile,
transitional, and adult. The development of reproductively
mature adult plants usually begins with a strictly vegetative
juvenile phase. Maturation or a phase change is completed
within weeks among annuals but can proceed for several
years among perennials. In trees, the process is frequently
accompanied by ancillary morphological and physiological
traits, most commonly a loss of competence for adventitious rooting and a loss of overall vigor. Because a plant’s
developmental phase is determined in its shoot apical
meristems, reversing the phase of the meristems should
result in the emergence of rejuvenated shoots [1]. Indeed,
new growths with reversed phases have been obtained by
applying gibberellin [2] and cytokinin [3,4], continuously

subculturing shoots, especially in cytokinin-containing
media [5-7], and repeatedly grafting shoot apices from
mature trees onto juvenile rootstocks in vivo [8,9] and
in vitro [10-15].
Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl, a coastal redwood, can be rejuvenated through repeatedly grafting its
adult-phase shoot tips onto juvenile rootstocks in vitro
[16], which can result without phytohormonal supplements. Adventitious rooting is notably depressed and
essentially absent in tissues of adult trees. The stability
of the rejuvenated state by restoring rooting competence
and other juvenile characteristics can be retained
in vitro even after 30 years. The reversion has been
associated with distinctive leaf proteins, including clearly
apparent changes in iso-esterase and iso-peroxidase [17],
different tyrosine phosphorylation patterns, and higher
total protein phosphorylation in juvenile shoots [18].
Juvenile and rejuvenated shoots also released more ethylene [19], had higher total nitrogen content, and were
more active in photosynthesis and respiration [20]. This
diversity of differences in physiology between juvenile

and adult Sequoia shoots reflect the complexity of the
developmental phase change.
In 1991, a 16 kDa protein was found to be only produced in juvenile or rejuvenated meristems [21]. In
1996, a 28 kDa protein was found to be expressed in
greater amounts in juvenile shoot tips than mature
shoot tips [22]. Moreover, Gil et al. (2003) identified a
cDNA clone termed Quercus robur crown preferentially
expressed (QRCPE) that was differentially expressed in
juvenile-like and mature shoots in Quercus robur.
QRCPE appeared to be a cell-wall protein [23]. However, the proteomic differences in adult, juvenile, and
rejuvenated tree species are not well known. Using a
proteomics approach, candidate regulatory components
of the rejuvenation of tree species may be identified. In
the present study, Sequoia was utilized as our rejuvenation system, and gel-based proteomic analysis was performed. Three proteins with differential abundance in
adult, juvenile, and rejuvenated Sequoia were identified
by mass spectrometry (MS), including oxygen-evolving
enhancer protein 2 (OEE2), glycine-rich RNA-binding
protein (RNP) and a thaumatin-like protein (TLP).
Results from the gene expression and protein accumulation pattern indicated a positive correlation between
OEE2 and the rejuvenation stages, suggesting that OEE2
may be involved in the rejuvenation of Sequoia.

Results
The restored rooting competence of repeatedly grafted
Sequoia shoots is retained after 30 years of culture in
vitro

Sequoia shoot cultures initiated in 1976 and 1994 had
retained their hallmark characteristics. Those in the
adult phase were rootless, had enervated shoots, and
grew very slowly compared with juvenile phase cultures
(Figure 1). These developmental stage-specific samples
included adult cultured shoots established in 1976
(Adult76) and 1994 (Adult94) and juvenile and rejuvenated (Rejuvenated) shoots. However, rooting was substantially restored among adult shoots that had been
grafted four times onto juvenile rootstocks in 1976 and
after three times in 1994.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis has
been widely used to identify differentially expressed proteins at different stages of plant development [24].
Huang et al. (1992) used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and discovered pattern differences among proteins extracted from adult, juvenile, and rejuvenated
shoot cultures, in which the rejuvenated cultures were
obtained by repeatedly grafting adult onto juvenile stock
[16]. However, the proteins were not identified. Thus,

Page 2 of 16

the present study identified some of the differentially
expressed proteins.
Total proteins were isolated from A cultured shoots
established in 1976 (Adult76) and 1994 (Adult94) and
juvenile and rejuvenated cultured shoots (Rejuvenated76
and Rejuvenated94). The protein extracts were subjected
to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with at least
three biological replicates analyzed for each type of tissue. The protein gel images are shown in Figure 2. At
least three distinctive protein spots with differential
intensity were detected. The relative intensity of each
protein spot was quantified using SameSpots software
(Progenesis, USA).
Identification of Sequoia proteins exhibiting up- or downregulated protein abundance during rejuvenation

Three protein spots that showed differential accumulation (labeled 1, 2, and 3) in each gel were excised and
subjected to in-gel digestion followed by MS (Figure 2).
Proteins were identified by a database search using inhouse Mascot software (Table 1). Protein identification
was validated using Scaffold software to provide confidence interval percentages (Additional file 1). Oxygenevolving enhancer protein2 (OEE2), glycine-rich RNA
binding protein (RNP) and thaumatin-like protein (TLP)
were consistently identified in the three biological replicates. Specifically, two identified proteins, RNP and
OEE2, showed increased protein abundance during the
rejuvenation stage (Figure 3), whereas TLP showed
decreased protein abundance during the rejuvenation
stage (Figure 3). In addition to spots 1, 2, and 3, three
other proteins from other spots were also identified.
The proteins included glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase, class I chitinase and a LRR-repeat protein (Additional file 2). However, these proteins were not
consistently identified in all five protein gel samples.
Our detailed studies were confined to OEE2, RNP and TLP.
The deduced amino acid sequences of OEE2, RNP and TLP
were shown in Figure 4A,F, Figure 5 and Figure 6A, respectively. These sequences were entered into the database, and
an additional database search was performed with in-house
Mascot software. More peptides were identified, and the
sequence coverage was greatly increased (Table 1 Figure 4
Figure 5 Figure 6). OEE2 was identified in spot 1, with a
predicted molecular mass of 27.7 kD. However, the apparent molecular mass of OEE2 on the protein gel was
approximately 21 kD, which was much smaller than
expected. Additionally, the N-terminus peptide fragments
of OEE2 were not discovered in this study (Table 1). Altogether, the results suggest that the identified OEE2 is a
chloroplast form without the transit peptide. The transit
peptide of OEE2 could be cleaved by a protease before
translocation into the chloroplast.

Adult94, adult shoots established in 1976 and 1994, respectively; Rejuvented76 and Rejuvented94, rejuvenated plants from adult shoots
established in 1976 and 1994, respectively. Spot numbers are labeled with white arrows pointing to each protein spot.

Without including the Sequoia OEE2 protein
sequence in the database, only two OEE2 peptides were
identified (Table 1). A Mascot protein score of 2017
was obtained when including Sequoia OEE2 in the database. Thirteen OEE2 peptides, including a phosphopeptide, were identified. The protein coverage was 52%.
The phosphopeptide of OEE2 was doubly phosphorylated (YEDNFDGNSNVSVMVpTPpTDK), and the MS/
MS spectrum of the phosphopeptide is shown in Figure
7. This phosphopeptide was validated by Scaffold, with
a confidence interval > 95% (Additional file 1).
RNP was identified in spot 3. Without including the
RNP protein sequence in the database, only one peptide
was identified (Table 1). The Mascot protein score was
67, and the protein coverage was 11%. The Mascot protein score was 1155 when including the Sequoia RNP
protein sequence in the database. Fourteen peptides
were identified, and the protein coverage was 61%. TLP
was identified in spot 2. The Mascot protein score was
833, and three peptides were identified.
Protein levels of OEE2, RNP, and TLP in repeatedly
grafted Sequoia shoots

All of the above three proteins were consistently identified
in the three biological replicates. OEE2 protein abundance

was found to be up-regulated in Rejuvenated76 and Rejuvenated94. The protein level in the adult specimen
(Adult76 and Adult94) was lower than the juvenile and
rejuvenated samples (Figure 3). Adult76 and Adult94 were
significantly different from Juvenile, Rejuvenated76 and
Rejuvenated94 (p < 0.05; one-way analysis of variance
[ANOVA] followed by Duncan’s multiple range test for
statistical analysis of means) (Additional file 3 &4). The
protein abundance of OEE2 through the steps of repeated
grafting showed a positive correlation between rejuvenation and protein abundance in Sequoia shoot cultures
initiated in both 1976 and 1994 (Figure 3).
By contrast, the protein abundance of RNP was found
to be up-regulated in Rejuvenated94 but not Rejuvenated76. The protein level of RNP in the adult plantlet
(Adult76 and Adult94) was lower than the Juvenile and
Rejuvenated94 samples (Figure 3). However, Adult76
and Adult94 were not significantly different from Juvenile, Rejuvenated76 and Rejuvenated94 (p < 0.05; oneway ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple range test
for statistical analysis of means) (Additional file 3, 4).
Therefore, the protein abundance of RNP through the
steps of repeated grafting showed no correlation
between rejuvenation and protein abundance in Sequoia
shoot cultures initiated in 1976 or 1994 (Figure 3).

TLP abundance was found to be down-regulated in
Rejuvenated76 and Rejuvenated94. The protein level in
the adult specimen (Adult76 and Adult94) was higher
than the Juvenile and Rejuvenated samples (Figure 3).
Adult76 and Adult94 were significantly different from
Juvenile, Rejuvenated76 and Rejuvenated94 (p < 0.05;
one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple range
test for statistical analysis of means) (Additional file 3,
4). The protein abundance of TLP through the steps of
repeated grafting showed a reverse correlation between
rejuvenation and protein abundance in Sequoia shoot
cultures initiated in both 1976 and 1994 (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of OEE2, TLP and RNP

The full-length cDNAs of the SsOEE2, SsTLP, and
SsRNP genes were cloned from Sequoia shoots in vitro
and further analyzed. The cDNA length of SsOEE2 was
981 bps and encoded a predicted 27.7 kDa protein. The
isoelectric point of SsOEE2 was 9.18. SsOEE2 contained

a signal peptide for chloroplast in the N-terminal. Phylogenetic analysis of OEE2 by the neighbor-joining
method revealed that the Sequoia sempervirens protein
had 49-71% homology in the amino acid sequence with
the protein of other species (Figure 4B). The peptide
sequence of OEE2, among gymnosperms, was conserved
and displayed diversity from those of algae and other
angiosperms. The cDNA length of SsTLP was 896 bps
and encoded a predicted 24.7 kDa protein. The isoelectric point of TLP was 8.62. It contained a secretory signal peptide in the N-terminal. The phylogenetic analysis
of TLP, based on calculations by the neighbor-joining
method, revealed that Sequoia sempervirens had 43-71%
homology in the amino acid sequence with the other
species (Figure 5B). The peptide sequence of TLP was
conserved among gymnosperms and angiosperms.
The cDNA length of SsRNP was 1123 bps and
encoded a predicted 18.5 kDa protein. The isoelectric
point of RNP was 8.05 and contained a nuclear

analysis of RNP, based on calculations by the neighborjoining method, revealed that Sequoia sempervirens
shared 49-79% homology in the amino acid sequence
with the other species (Figure 6B). The peptide sequence
of RNP, among gymnosperms, was conserved and displayed diversity from those of angiosperms.
Gene expression patterns of up- or down-regulated genes
in repeatedly grafted Sequoia shoots

To further explore the role of up- or down-regulated
genes in phase changes, the expression patterns of
SsOEE2, SsRNP, and SsTLP in the two adult shoot cultures, established in 1976 and 1994, respectively, were
monitored following repeated grafting (Figure 8). Both

SsOEE2 and SsRNP displayed higher expression levels in
the juvenile phase and a lower expression level in the
adult phase (Figure 8). Furthermore, their expression
levels also steadily increased with the number of repeated
grafts. Specifically, a higher expression level of SsOEE2
was present in the Sequoia shoots during the juvenile
and rejuvenated stages, which is consistent with the protein accumulation pattern (Figure 3). However, the
expression level of SsRNP displayed a similar pattern at
different stages in Sequoia shoots initiated in 1976 but
increased slightly with repeated grafting initiated in 1994.
By contrast, the expression level of SsTLP in adult
shoots was initially high but progressively decreased
with repeated grafting. The expression pattern of SsTLP
was opposite to SsOEE2 and decreased with repeated

SsTLP was present in Sequoia shoots during the adult
stage and significantly decreased with one-time Sequoia
grafting initiated in 1976 and the third Sequoia grafting
initiated in 1994.

Discussion
Plant maturation involves a sequence of developmental
stages or phases that can be categorized as embryo,
juvenile, transitional and adult. Aging in perennials is
very complex, and no consensus has been achieved in
the general concepts related to this topic [25]. A juvenile
phase occurs in all woody plants, which lasts up to
30-40 years in certain forest trees, during which flowering does not occur. The physiology and molecular biology aspects are then considered when listing
biochemical markers of maturation in woody plants.
These markers occur as part of primary and secondary
metabolism (e.g., mineral and carbon nutrition, growth
regulators, polyamines, phenolic compounds, and

peroxidase activity) and gene expression (e.g., nucleic
acids, transcription and proteic synthesis) [25-28].
The transition leading to adulthood is accompanied by
changes in morphological characteristics, such as a loss of
adventitious rooting, modification of leaf morphology, an
enervated growth rate, and a variation in phytohormone
levels [29-31]. The process of rejuvenation of the adult
shoot apex or inflorescence reversion was identical in
planta and well characterized by research that showed
some of the key genes involved in the reversion of determinate floral meristem to indeterminate shoot meristem
[32,33]. However, most species are less prone to maturational stage reversion because signals from the leaf are less
ephemeral even when its initiation is dependent on environmental cues. Several plants undergo rejuvenation when
exposed to optimal stimuli, such as gibberellins [34], cytokinin [35], ABA [36], and grafting [16]. Grafting is known
to cause phase reversion in woody perennials (e.g., citrus
[37], cupressus [38], eucalyptus [38], hedera [39], passiflora
[40], pseudotsuga [41], and avocado [14].

The factors triggering maturation and phase transition
and how this process is regulated in terms of changes in
gene expression, cellular signaling, and metabolism are
well known. Unfortunately, most of the established
knowledge on phase transition is based on annual Arabidopsis or rice. Much less genetic evidence has been
obtained regarding rejuvenation in perennials. We
focused on Sequoia proteins and genes that displayed an
identical pattern at different developmental stages, and
advances in proteomics has helped unravel some of the
particular features of rejuvenation in Sequoia.
Identification of OEE2 protein

OEE2 is a core component of the PSII complex in the
chloroplast in plants [42]. Evidence has shown that
OEE2 in higher plants can only associate with the PSII
core complex through OEE1 and OEE3. The oxygen-

evolving capacity of PSII decreased to as low as 5-10%
in the absence of OEE2 [42]. Based on the literature, the
accumulation of OEE2 can be regulated by plant hormones. The abundance of OEE2 increased in the cytokinin-treated moss Physcomitrella patens [43]. The
accumulation of OEE2 can also be regulated by abiotic
stress. Up-regulated OEE protein levels have also been
detected in E. elongatum and Norway spruce during
drought stress [44,45] and in rice undergoing salt stress
and metal treatment [46]. Furthermore, the accumulation of OEE2 can be regulated by development. The
photosynthetic rate and expression level of OEE
increased in leaves of maize which roots were colonized
by Trichoderma virens [47].
A decrease in photosynthesis with increased aging has
been shown to be a significant feature of several trees
[27]. Higher rates of photosynthesis and chlorophyll a/b

ratios were present during the juvenile and rejuvenate
stages, but quantum efficiencies of PSII indicated equivalent effectiveness in the juvenile, rejuvenate, and adult
stages. Recent studies have demonstrated RNA interference (RNAi) in PsbP protein, which has greater homology with SsOEE2, with similar results in tobacco [48].
Therefore, the increasing expression level of SsOEE2 is a
critical event for restoring the net photosynthesis rate.
Furthermore, the photosynthesis rate and expression
level of OEE were increased in maize leaves when the
roots were colonized by Trichoderma virens [47]. Moreover, the plant in the adult stage is much shorter in the
juvenile stage (Figure 1). With PsbP protein knockout in
tobacco, the transgenic plant phenotype displayed dramatic growth retardation and also decreases in the chlorophyll a/b ratio and oxygen evolution [49]. This
indicated the effect of roots on sink activity and in directing carbon partitioning toward the roots and promoting
their development. Therefore, this indicated that active
OEE2 is related to nutrient recomposition associated
with restoration of rooting and foliar morphology, which
were other significant features of Sequoia rejuvenation.
The protein accumulation and gene expression level of
SsOEE2 increased through successive grafts in the

present study (Figure 3 Figure 8). A positive correlation
was found between rejuvenation and protein and transcript abundance of the SsOEE2 gene. This suggested
that SsOEE2 may be involved in Sequoia rejuvenation.
Specifically, based on the molecular mass, the OEE2
identified in this study appeared to be localized in the
chloroplast. Altogether, these results suggest that the
chloroplast protein may be involved in Sequoia rejuvenation. Because only plants possess chloroplast, and the fact
that rejuvenation found only in plants implicates chloroplast may be one of the regulatory components in plant
rejuvenation. In addition, expression of a chlorophyll a/b
binding gene was also found to be greater in developing
juvenile than in mature foliage [50,51]. It is possible that
chloroplast proteins are a key of rejuvenation process in
plants. Whether photosynthesis efficiency is altered in
Sequoia rejuvenation requires further studies.
Identification of RNP protein

Plant RNP is a class of genes with diverse functions, and
the functions of many of these genes are still unknown.
The expression of RNP genes is regulated by abiotic
stress (e.g., cold, wounds, and hormones such as auxin
and abscisic acid [52]. In Arabidopsis, AtGRP7 has been

widely studied. AtGRP7 has been reported to promote
phase transition in Arabidopsis and is recognized as a
novel autonomous pathway component [53]. However,
transgenic plants overexpressing AtGRP7 and wildtypes
using the ATH1 GeneChip did not show significant
changes in FCA or FY under a long-day photoperiod.
FLC level was lowered in AtGRP7OX plants. This indicated that RNP may play a multifunctional role in different phase transitions in planta.
Many types of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play
diverse roles in regulating RNA metabolism in a variety
of cellular processes [54]. While analyzing the cellular
localization of two rice OsRZ2-GFP and OsRZ3-GFP
fusion proteins using a confocal microscope, strong GFP
signals were observed in the nuclei of roots of OsRZ2and OsRZ3-expressing Arabidopsis plants [55]. Moreover, the growth of roots in OsRZ2-overexpressing grp7
plants was higher than wildtype and grp7 plants,
demonstrating that RNPs influence root growth in Arabidopsis plants [56,57]. The restoration of rooting competence is an obvious correlative characteristic of
Sequoia rejuvenation (Figure 1). In Figure 6SsRNP displayed greater homology in the amino acid sequence
with AtGRP7 and demonstrated a potential role RNPs
in root growth.
Although the expression level of SsRNP in the steps of
repeated grafting in the present study suggested no

correlation between rejuvenation and protein/transcript
abundance of the SsRNP gene in Sequoia shoot cultures
initiated in 1976 or 1994, SsRNP still appeared to play a
possible role in the restoration of rooting competence
during rejuvenation. A previous study showed that
OEE2 can be phosphorylated by a RNP-mediated wallassociated kinase [58]. Additionally, a phosphopeptide of
OEE2 was identified in this study (Table 1). Whether
the phosphorylation of OEE2 is involved in the rejuvenation of Sequoia and whether RNP and OEE2 are coordinated during rejuvenation require further studies.
Glycine-rich protein (GRP) has been shown to be
abundant in the xylem cell wall and participate in wood
formation [59-63]. GRPS were also shown to play an
important role in cold adaptation in a biosphere
[57,60,62,64]. Therefore, a higher expression level of
GRP was present in the later wood, consisting of cells
with smaller lumens and thicker cell walls during the
chill season [59,60]. Glycine-rich RNA binding proteins
(RNP) belong to the Class IV GRPs and are involved in
stress adaptation [53,54,65,66]. The expression level of
SsRNP in Sequoia shoot cultures initiated in 1976 displayed a similar expression level during the adult, juvenile, and rejuvenile stages but exhibited slightly
increased levels during the juvenile and rejuvenile stages
compared with the adult stage in shoots initiated in
1994 (Figure 8).

Identification of thaumatin-like protein

Plant materials

Thaumatin-like proteins (TLP) are a class of superfamily
proteins participating in several biological processing
[67]. The expression level of SsTLP was higher in the
adult stage and decreased with successive grafts. The
expression level showed an opposite pattern with
SsOEE2. TLP is well known to belong to pathogenesisrelated (PR) protein family 5 (PR5) [68]. Most TLPs have
strong antifungal activity [69-71], but some TLPs have
little or no antifungal activity [72,73]. SsTLP displayed
high homology with two TLPs–Cryj 3.1 and Cryj 3.2
isolated from Cryptomeria japonica [74]. Several TLPs
isolated from Cryptomeria japonica have different
expression patterns in plant tissue, with a higher expression level of Cryj 3.1 in the reproductive organ. Furthermore, gSN-TLP isolated from elderberry trees (Sambucus
nigra L.) also displayed higher expression levels in older
leaves compared with younger leaves [75]. These studies
indicate that TLPs could be an adult trait and worthy of
future investigations of their function in rejuvenation.

Sequoia shoots at different developmental stages or
phases were cultured as previously described [16]. The
adult shoot stocks were established by culturing shoot
tips excised in 1976 and 1994. Cultures of juvenile shoot
cuttings maintained as shoot stocks were established
using fresh in vitro germinated seeding. Rejuvenated
shoots were obtained by grafting the shoot tips five
times from the two adult Sequoia shoots by grafting the
adult shoot tips onto juvenile rootstocks. After grafting,
shoots were severed and maintained in stocks by subculturing 2-3 cm terminal sections every 2 months in MSbased medium [76].

Conclusions
In the present study, three proteins differentially accumulated during different rejuvenation stages in Sequoia
sempervirens. These included OEE2, TLP and RNP. The
protein abundance and transcript abundance of a phosphoprotein SsOEE2 were consistently lower in Sequoia
shoots during the adult stage but increased with
repeated grafting. This correlation between rejuvenation
and protein and transcript abundance of the genes suggested that SsOEE2 is associated with rejuvenation, and
may be involved in Sequoia sempervirens rejuvenation.
Materials and methods
Tissue culture

Continuously cultured Sequioa sempervirens (D. Don)
Endl. shoots from freshly germinated seedlings served as
the juvenile rootstocks, and those from mature trees provided the adult shoot meristems. The continuous cultures
were initiated from terminals of juvenile and adult shoots
and from scion-growth remnants following regrafting of
shoot tips. One centimeter long terminals were subcultured at 6 week intervals in nutrient media containing
Murashige and Skoog salts [76], 3% sucrose, 0.2% gelrite,
555 μM myo-inositol, 3 μM thiamine HCl, 2.4 μM pyridoxine HCl, 4.1 μM nicotinic acid, and 26.6 μM glycine.
Grafting was performed by inserting the obliquely cut base
of a 1.5 cm long shoot terminal into a longitudinal incision
made in a rooted 1 cm tall juvenile stem segment. Regrafting was performed at 8 week intervals. Shoot cultures and
grafted plants were maintained at 27°C with 16 h daily
exposure to 22.5 μmol m-2 s-1 cool-white fluorescent light.

Protein extraction

This method was modified from a previous study [77].
Two grams of the plant sample were ground with a
mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. 0.15-0.2 g of the
sample was transferred to 10 Eppendorff centrifuge
tubes. Each tube was washed with a 10-fold volume of
cold 10% trichloroacetic acid/acetone containing, successively, 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol, cold 80% methanol
containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate and 0.07% 2mercaptoethanol, and cold 80% acetone containing
0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol and cold 100% acetone. After
each wash, all tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at
4°C for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded.
When all washes were finished, the pellets were air
dried at room temperature for at least 10 min, and
0.8 mL 0.1 g -1 of a starting sample of 1:1 phenol/
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer was added, mixed
thoroughly, incubated for 10 min, and centrifuged at
16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The phenol phase was
pipetted into a 50 ml falcon tube. At least 3-5 volumes
of cold methanol containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate
and 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol were added. The tube
was stored at -20°C overnight. The falcon tube was
centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min the next
day. The precipitates were washed twice with cold
methanol containing 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol and
twice with 80% cold acetone containing 0.07% 2mercaptoethanol. Following each washing step, the falcon tube was centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4°C for
10 min. Finally, the pellet was resuspended with 16 mL
cold 100% acetone and aliquoted into eight 2.0 mL
Eppendorff centrifuge tubes. These tubes were then
centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the
supernatant was discarded. The pellet was air dried at
room temperature for at least 10 min and dissolved in
200 μL rehydration buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea,
0.5% triton X-100, and a trace of bromophenol blue),
and the tubes were stored at -80°C overnight.

Isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis

A 1.5 mL Eppendorff centrifuge tube was prepared. An
appropriate volume of protein sample containing 800 μg
of protein was mixed with 3.8 mg dithiothreitol (DTT)
and 0.5 μL ampholyte in the tube. Rehydration buffer
was added to achieve a final volume of 500 μL. The protein sample was loaded onto the focusing tray and covered with a 17 cm, pH 3-10, immobilized pH gradient
(IPG) strip (linear). Active rehydration was performed
on a Bio-Rad Protean IEF cell under 50 voltage for 14 h.
Isoelectric focusing was performed on the same machine
using the following program: 250 V, linear ramp for
20 min; 10,000 V, linear ramp for 3 h; and 10,000 V for
a total of 60,000 Vh. Strips were stored at -80°C overnight. The strips were thawed, and equilibration began
with SDS equilibration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8,
6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and a trace of bromophenol blue) the following day. The strips were kept in
equilibration buffer 1 (SDS equilibration buffer containing 1% DTT) and shaken for 15-20 min. The strips were
moved into equilibration buffer 2 (SDS equilibration
buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide) for 15-20 min.
The strips were then layered on 12% acrylamide gel and
embedded in the place of agarose. Electrophoresis was
performed on a Bio-Rad Protean II xi Cell (step 1:
32 mA for 30 min; step 2: 90 mA for 270 min) and
stopped when the indicated blue line reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were then washed with distilled and
deionized water once for 5 min and fixed with fixative
buffer (50% methanol and 7% acetic acid) overnight.
Gels were washed three times with ddH 2 O (10 min
each), and then the stained gels were stained with Sypro
Ruby for 4-5 h. Stained gel images were scanned using a
GE Typhoon 9400. Gel images were compared using
SameSpots (Progenesis, UK) software.
In-gel digestion of proteins

Two-dimensional gel spots were excised with cut tips
individually. Cut gels were soaked in 50 mM dithioerythreitol (DTE)/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5)
at 37°C for 1 h and soaked in 100 mM iodoacetamide/
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Gel samples were then
soaked in 50% acetonitrile/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) three times (15 min each), followed
by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min each. Gel samples were soaked with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. After
removing acetonitrile, gel samples were dried in a Speed
Vac for approximately 10 min. One hundred nanograms
of trypsin and 40 μL 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate
were added to each gel sample and incubated at 37°C for
at least 16 h. Fifty μL of 50% acetonitrile/5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each gel sample and

Page 13 of 16

sonicated for 10 min. The above step was repeated,
combined peptide solutions was dried in a Speed Vac for
90 min. Dried peptide pellets were prepared for liquid
chromatography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS) using Mass Solutions Technology.
Mass spectrometry analyses and protein identification

Peptide samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using
Q-TOF (Waters, UK) or LTQ Velos (Thermo, US). Peak
list files were generated from RAW files. Protein identification was performed using in-house Mascot software
(Matrixscience, US) [78]. The mass peak list data were
searched against the National Center for Biotechnology
Information database using green plant taxonomy. For the
Q-TOF dataset, mass tolerance was set to 0.6 D. For the
LTQ dataset, mass tolerance was set to 1 D. The missed
cleavage site was set to 1. To validate the identified peptides or proteins, Scaffold software (Proteome Software,
US) was used to provide confidence interval percentages
for the identification of peptides and proteins.
Statistical analyses of gel spot intensity

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to compare the protein
abundance of the gel spots. Significant effects (p < 0.05)
in the one-way ANOVA were followed by Duncan’s
multiple range test.
RNA extraction

One gram of sample was ground in the mortar treated
with liquid nitrogen. The sample powder was mixed with
10 mL extraction buffer (10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone, 10 g
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, 4.653 g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 58.44 g sodium chloride,
0.25 g spermidine, and fresh 200 μl b-mercaptoethanol).
After heating the slurry at 65°C in a water bath for 10 min,
delaminating was performed by 13,000 rpm centrifugation
at 25°C for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed well with
chloroform and isoamylalcohol twice, and the total RNA
was collected after precipitation with a 1/4-fold volume of
10 M lithium chloride at 4°C overnight.
Rapid amplification of cDNA end and cloning of gene of
interest

Total RNA was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase and then decapped by acid pyrophosphatase. The
completed mRNA was ligated using a GeneRacer RNA
oligo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), and cDNA
was formed by reverse transcription. The cDNA was
used as the template for cloning the genes of interest
using the following steps: denaturation at 94°C for
2 min, followed by 20 cycles of amplification (i.e., 94°C
for 30 s for denaturation, 47-66°C for 30 s for annealing,
depending on the genes, 72°C for 30 s for elongation)

Chang et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:64

and extension at 72°C for 10 min. For cloning OEE2, the
primers were OEE25primer (5-CGCGCATAACACTCGGAGGA-3) and OEE25primer (5-CGAAA CCCTAA
AATGTGCTT-3). For cloning TLP, the primer are
TLP5-primer:5-CGTGGACTGAAGGAGTAGAA-3 and
TLP-3primer:5-AACAACTAACGATA GCATATTTTATTTTGTAA-3.For cloning RNP, the primers were
RNP5primer (5-GGAGTAGAAAGACTGGAGCA-3)
and RNP3primer (5-CTCAAATCATTCATTATCCA-3).
The amplified DNA fragments of each candidate gene
were cloned in pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA), and the sequences were identified. The confirmed gene sequences were deposited in GenBank with
the accession number assigned.
