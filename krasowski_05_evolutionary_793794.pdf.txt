Abstract
Background: The nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily complement in humans is
composed of 48 genes with diverse roles in metabolic homeostasis, development, and
detoxification. In general, NRs are strongly conserved between vertebrate species, and few
examples of molecular adaptation (positive selection) within this superfamily have been
demonstrated. Previous studies utilizing two-species comparisons reveal strong purifying (negative)
selection of most NR genes, with two possible exceptions being the ligand-binding domains (LBDs)
of the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3),
two proteins involved in the regulation of toxic compound metabolism and elimination. The aim of
this study was to apply detailed phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood methods to the
entire complement of genes in the vertebrate NR superfamily. Analyses were carried out both
across all vertebrates and limited to mammals and also separately for the two major domains of
NRs, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and LBD, in addition to the full-length sequences. Additional
functional data is also reported for activation of PXR and the vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) to
gain further insight into the evolution of the NR1I subfamily.
Results: The NR genes appear to be subject to strong purifying selection, particularly in the DBDs.
Estimates of the ratio of the non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (the ω
ratio) revealed that only the PXR LBD had a sub-population of codons with an estimated ω ratio
greater than 1. CAR was also unusual in showing high relative ω ratios in both the DBD and LBD,
a finding that may relate to the recent appearance of the CAR gene (presumably by duplication of
a pre-mammalian PXR gene) just prior to the evolution of mammals. Functional analyses of the
NR1I subfamily show that human and zebrafish PXRs show similar activation by steroid hormones
and early bile salts, properties not shared by sea lamprey, mouse, or human VDRs, or by Xenopus
laevis PXRs.
Conclusion: NR genes generally show strong sequence conservation and little evidence for
positive selection. The main exceptions are PXR and CAR, genes that may have adapted to crossspecies differences in toxic compound exposure.

Background
Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated
transcription factors that work in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate gene expression [1-3].
NRs share a modular domain structure, which includes,
from N-terminus to C-terminus, a modulatory A/B
domain, the DNA-binding domain (DBD; C domain), the
hinge D domain, the ligand-binding domain (LBD; E
domain) and a variable C-terminal F domain that is
absent in some NRs [3]. Examples of ligands for NRs
include a range of endogenous compounds such as steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and retinoids [3,4]. A
few NRs, such as the 'xenobiotic sensors' pregnane X
receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR or NR1I3), are activated by structurally diverse
exogenous ligands [5-7].
The NR superfamily in mammals is composed of approximately 50 functional genes, with 48 genes in humans, 47
in rats, and 49 in mice [8]. Bony fish have a somewhat
larger complement of NR genes due to gene duplication,
exemplified by the 68 NR genes found in the genome of
the pufferfish Fugu rubripes [9]. The current official
nomenclature for NRs divides the superfamily into 7 families (NR0-6) [10,11]. The NR0 family, represented in
humans by DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex and AHC critical
region on the X chromosome; NR0B1) and SHP (small
heterodimer partner; NR0B2) are unusual in essentially
being 'domain singletons' that lack a DBD [12,13]. NRs
have been the focus of a number of evolutionary studies
including detailed investigations into the origins of the
superfamily [11,14-16] and the development of ligand
selectivity by the sex and adrenocortical steroid hormone
receptors [17-20].
A major focus of molecular phylogenetics has been a
search for evidence of positive selection (molecular adaptation) [21]. A variety of computational techniques have
been developed over the last several decades to detect
nucleotide variation between different genes suggestive of
positive selection [21,22]. For comparisons within coding
regions, the most common approach is to compare nucleotide variation that is non-synonymous (i.e., changes
amino acid sequence encoded for by codons) or synonymous (does not changes amino acid sequence). Synonymous variation is considered to be neutral, an assumption
which is generally true although there are exceptions [23].
The ratio of the rate of non-synonymous versus the rate of
synonymous nucleotide variation (i.e., how many nonsynonymous or synonymous changes have occurred in
comparison to the total number of non-synonymous or
synonymous changes possible; dN/dS or ω) provides some
indication into selective forces acting on a given gene. For
most gene comparisons, ω is less than one, often less than
0.1, reflective of negative or purifying selection to main-

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

tain a conserved amino acid sequence. ω = 1 reflects neutral selection (a ratio that would be expected for a nonfunctional pseudogene) while ω > 1 suggests positive
selection. A large-scale comparison of 3,595 groups of
homologous genes revealed that less than 0.5% had ω
ratios greater than 1, with many of these genes being
found in microorganisms [24]. Given that comparisons
between full-length gene sequences rarely result in ω
ratios greater than 1, techniques have been developed to
detect sub-populations of codons that have elevated ω
ratios. Different mathematical approaches have been
applied to achieve this goal, including maximum likelihood [25,26] and Bayesian [27] methods. In this study,
we employed the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) software, developed by Yang and colleagues [28], as this methodology is robust and has an
extensive published literature associated with its application in biomedical research [21].
Most of the NR genes are strongly conserved between vertebrate species. Not surprisingly, previous studies utilizing
two-species comparisons between human, mouse, and rat
or humans, chimpanzee, and mouse genomes revealed
that the NR genes are in general subject to negative selection [8,29], with only a few possible exceptions such as
the LBDs of PXR and CAR [8,30]. A more detailed phylogenetic analysis of PXR, CAR, and the other member of the
NR1I subfamily, the 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 receptor
(VDR; NR1I1), within mammals and across vertebrates,
showed ω ratios for the CAR and PXR LBDs markedly
higher than that for the VDR LBD [30]. For the PXR LBD
analyses within mammals, the ω ratio exceeded one for a
sub-population of codons comprising approximately 5%
of the total codons in the LBD [30].
Given that a major function of PXR and CAR is to detect
toxic endogenous and xenobiotic compounds that likely
differ between species [5,6], these two genes may represent unusual examples of NR genes that have undergone
positive selection in their LBDs for functional advantage.
The aim of this study was to apply detailed phylogenetic
analysis to the entire superfamily of NR genes in vertebrates to detect possible signatures of positive selection.
This phylogenetic analysis, combined with functional
analyses of PXRs and VDRs, provides a detailed context
into how unusual the nucleotide variation of PXR and
CAR is to the rest of the superfamily.

Results
Sequences available for phylogenetic analysis
Data from genome sequencing projects (e.g., human,
chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, Xenopus tropicalis,
Fugu rubripes, and Tetraodon nigroviridis) has greatly
increased the number of NR coding sequences publicly
available for phylogenetic analysis across vertebrates. The

complete set of species and accession numbers for the NR
genes analyzed in this study is provided in Additional file
1: Genes used for phylogenetic analysis. Complete nucleotide sequences in PAML format are provided in Additional file 2: Sequences used for phylogenetic analysis by
PAML. To improve the power of accurately detecting positive selection and to minimize the risk of false positives,
PAML analyses were only performed if sequence data
from at least six species from at least six separate genera
were available [22,31-33]. Given that some of the
sequence data was partial and only contained complete
data for the DBD or LBD (and not full-length sequence in
those instances), the number of species available for the
various analyses for each gene (i.e., full-length, DBD only,
and LBD only) differs in some cases. The number of
sequences varies widely across the NR superfamily,
mainly because some receptors have been more intensively studied than others. For example, 33 full-length
sequences are available for analysis of the estrogen receptor-α (ERα, NR3A1), while only 6 are available for estrogen-related receptor-β (ERRβ, NR3B2).
PAML analyses of the NR superfamily
The PAML analyses used correspond to models M0, M3
(with ncatG = 2, 3, 4, where ncatG is the number of populations of codons with distinct ω ratios), M7, and M8
within the PAML software (see Materials and Methods)
[25,26]. Models M0 and M3 are 'discrete' in that they
assign codons to population(s) of distinct ω ratios. For
instance, an analysis of a particular gene may assign 95%
of codons to an ω ratio of 0.05 (consistent with purifying
selection) and the remaining 5% to an ω ratio exceeding
1 (suggestive of positive selection). For each M0/M3 analysis, the 'best minimum model' was determined. An M3
analysis was chosen only if it was statistically superior to
the closest simpler model (e.g., M3 with 2 ω ratios versus
M0). The ω ratios in the M0 or M3 analyses may be any
value 0 or greater. M7 assigns codons within a gene to ω
ratios along a β distribution function between 0 and 1
with parameters α and β. Depending on the parameters α
and β, the β distribution may have most ω ratios clustered
near 0 or be distributed more evenly between 0 and 1. M8
is a model where some codons have ω ratios that fall
along a β distribution but the remaining codons form a
separate population with a discrete ω ratio that may be
any value 0 or greater (including greater than 1). M8 can
detect the presence of positive selection (i.e., the extra ω
class can be greater than 1) whereas M7 cannot.
M0 and M3 analyses
The complete results for all PAML analyses are provided in
Additional file 3: Results of PAML analysis and treefiles.
The distribution of frequency and ω ratios for all NR genes
is plotted in Figure 1 (parts A, B, and C correspond to fulllength sequence, DBD only, and LBD only analyses,

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

respectively; the open circles are for analyses of all vertebrates while the closed circles are for analyses confined to
mammals only). Each point on the plots in Figure 1 corresponds to the frequency and ω ratios for the best minimum model that provides a statistically superior fit to the
data over the closest simpler model (see legend to Figure
1 for more details).
Overall, the M0/M3 analyses confirm original observations from two-species comparisons that the NR genes are
in general subject to strong negative selection, particularly
in the DBD [8,29]. The DBDs show lower ω ratios than the
LBD or full-length sequences (Figure 1B). Only NR1C1
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α; PPARα)
has a sub-population of codons within the DBD with an
estimated ω ratio of greater than 0.5, and this sub-population corresponds to only 1 codon out of 66 analyzed. A
number of genes, including NR1B1 (retinoic acid receptor-α; RARα), NR2B1 (retinoid X receptor-α; RXRα),
NR3B1 (ERRα), and NR3B2 (ERRβ), show virtually no
non-synonymous nucleotide differences between different species in the DBD and have ω ratios close to 0 (<
0.01). NR1A1 (TRα) and NR1I3 (CAR) are somewhat
unusual relative to the other NR genes in having at least
15% of codons with an estimated ω ratio of greater than
0.1.
The LBDs of the NR genes clearly show higher ω ratios
than the DBDs (Figure 1C). Yet, despite this, the majority
of receptors (41 of 48) have ω ratios for all sub-populations of codons less than 0.5. Only PXR genes, analyzed
for mammals only, have a sub-populations of codons
with an ω ratio greater than 1; this ω class corresponds to
5% of all analyzed codons in the PXR LBD. The analyses
for the full-length receptor sequences generally follow the
trends seen for the LBD only analysis with minor differences (compare Figure 1A and 1C). To provide another
comparison to PXR and CAR, PAML analysis was applied
to the LBD of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-1 (AHR), a
non-NR that has a similar function to CAR and PXR,
namely to respond to ligands (including xenobiotics) and
regulate expression of genes involved in metabolism and
elimination of potentially toxic compounds [34]. In contrast to PXR and CAR, the ω ratios associated with the AHR
LBD were more similar to the majority of NR genes than
to PXR or CAR (see red open and closed triangles in Figure
1C).
M7 and M8 analyses
For most analyses, M8 was not statistically superior to the
neutral model M7. Only 10 of 132 analyses of all vertebrate species and 3 of 65 analyses for mammals-only
revealed M8 results statistically superior to M7. None of
the M8 analyses identified a sub-population of codons
with an ω ratio exceeding 1. Once again, however, analysis

Summary of PAML discrete ω ratio variation models
Figure 1
Summary of PAML discrete ω ratio variation models. Each point on the plots in (A), (B), and (C) corresponds to the
frequency and ω ratios for the best minimum model (e.g., M0, M3/ncatG = 2, M3/ncatG = 3, etc.) that provides a statistically
superior fit to the data (i.e., a more complex model with additional codon ω ratio classes that does not provide a statistically
better fit to the next simplest model is rejected). For example, the analysis of the full-length sequence of NR1A1 (TRα) for all
available vertebrate species shows that M3/ncatG = 3 is superior to M3/ncatG = 2 but statistically equivalent to M3/ncatG = 4.
Consequently, plotted on Figure 1 are three points for the NR1A1 M3/ncatG = 3 analysis corresponding to frequency and ω
ratios for three classes of codons – 80.6% (frequency = 0.806) of codons have an estimated ω ratio of 0.004, 14.9% have an ω
ratio of 0.094, and 4.5% have an ω ratio of 0.259. An analysis that shows M0 is the best minimum model will have 100% of
codons (frequency = 1.0) with a particular ω ratio. (A), (B), and (C) apply to analyses of full-length sequences, DBD only, and
LBD only, respectively. The open circles are for analyses of all available vertebrate sequences while the closed circles are for
analyses of mammals only. For part (C), the red open and closed triangles represent data for the LBD of the AHR gene (a nonNR gene that encodes a protein with similar function to PXR and CAR).

did identify a sub-population of codons within the PXR
LBD with a high ω ratio relative to other NRs (e.g., for
analysis of the full-length PXR receptors for all vertebrates,
the M8 analysis found 3.4% of the PXR codons, all within
the LBD, with an ω ratio of 0.97).
Figure 2 shows plots derived from the estimated β-distribution parameters for the M7 (or M8, if statistically superior to M7) analyses for the NR genes. The β-distribution
is a continuous function that for the PAML analysis is
restricted to values between 0 and 1. Depending on the
parameters α and β for the β-distributions, the values may
be clustered more towards 0 or be more evenly distributed
between 0 and 1. Figure 2 plots for a particular gene how
many codons have estimated ω ratios equal to or less than
a particular ω ratio on the abscissa. For example, for analysis of the LBD of NR3B1 (ERRα), the M7 analysis produces a β-distribution where all variation in ω ratios
across codons is accounted for by ω ratios < 0.01 (see Figure 2C). In contrast, PAML analyses for the DBD and LBD
of CAR show β-distributions that span a range of ω ratios
greater than all other NR genes; the same analyses for PXR
are second only to CAR in the range of ω ratios spanned
(Figure 2B,C). The two LBD domain 'singletons', DAX-1
and SHP also show a wider span of ω ratios than most
other NR genes (Figure 2A,C; DBD analysis for DAX-1 and
SHP is not possible as these are domain singletons). Similar to the M0/M3 analyses described above, PAML M7/
M8 analysis was also applied to the LBD of the AHR LBD.
In contrast to PXR and CAR, the β-distribution of ω ratios
across codons in the AHR LBD was more similar to the
majority of NR genes than to PXR or CAR (see red line in
Figure 2C).
Individual variation among codons in selected NR genes
The M3 PAML analyses also provide estimates of the mean
ω ratio for each individual codon in a gene or gene
domain. This provides some indication of which specific
codons are potentially subject to positive selection. Figure
3 shows a plot of calculated mean ω ratios for the LBDs of
7 NR genes and the AHR gene. Comparison across the
LBDs of NR1I subfamily genes shows that PXR has very
diverse variation of ω ratios across codons with 5.1% of
codons in the mammals only analysis having estimated
mean ω ratios exceeding 1 (Figure 3C). In contrast, VDR,
whose major function is to respond to 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (calcitriol), a ligand conserved across all vertebrate
species, shows much lower inter-codon variation of ω
ratios than CAR or PXR (compare Figures 3A,C,E). The
pattern of ω variation across codons for CAR and the AHR
gene are descriptively similar (Figure 3E,H). For the mammals-only analysis, higher mean ω ratios are clearly associated with the Helix1-3 (H1-3) 'insert' region of PXR. The
H1-3 insert is very divergent across PXR genes and, similar
to the CAR genes, the two Xenopus laevis BXRs lack this

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

sequence entirely. This stretch of sequence was excluded
from the analyses of VDR and PXR for all vertebrate species due to extreme sequence divergence and difficulties in
alignment.
The analyses of other NR genes also show some variation
of nucleotide diversity across different receptors. RXRβ
(NR2B2) is illustrative of a group of NRs whose LBDs
show very low ω ratios across all codons (Figure 3B).
There are also differences between the LBDs of the sex and
adrenocortical steroid receptors with the androgen receptor (AR, NR3C4) showing low ω ratios, the estrogen receptor-β (ERβ, NR3A2) somewhat higher, and the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) the highest ω ratios
of the three (Figure 3D,F,G). The somewhat higher ω
ratios for select codons in the GR may relate to this receptor likely being one of the evolutionarily 'newer' classical
steroid receptors, the estrogen and progesterone receptors
being the most ancestral [17-20].
The receptors described above are all ligand-dependent. A
contrasting group of receptors are the 'ligand-independent' NRs, of which the estrogen-related receptors (ERRα,
NR3B1; ERRβ, NR3B2; ERRγ, NR3B3) [35], steroidogenic
factor 1 (SF-1; NR5A1) [36], and liver receptor homolog 1
(LRH-1, NR5A2) [36] are examples. These NRs are activated in the absence of ligand, although recent work has
shown that phosphatidyl inositols are likely endogenous
ligands for SF-1 and LRH-1 [36]. The evolutionary history
of ligand-independent NRs is incompletely understood
[11,20], with a proposal that ligand-binding is actually
the ancestral state for SF-1 and LRH-1 [36]. The ω ratios
for ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ, SF-1, and LRH-1 were all on the
lower end for the NR superfamily, both across all vertebrates and within mammals (Additional file 3: Results of
PAML analysis and treefiles), with patterns of ω ratio variation across codons very similar to that seen with the
androgen receptor (Figure 3G). While it is possible limited positive selection has occurred at a small number of
codons in the five ligand-independent receptors discussed
above, this was not detected by the PAML analysis.
Figure 4 shows ω ratio variation across the codons of the
DBDs of six NR genes. In general, the ω ratios are generally
much lower than 1, consistent with strong purifying of the
DBD. Overall, CAR and PXR show higher ω ratios across
codons than the other four NR genes, but the calculated ω
ratios are still less than 0.2 for all codons (Figure 4C,E).
Comparisons of the NR1I subfamily genes
The NR1I subfamily includes VDR, PXR, and CAR.
Sequence alignments of the LBDs of selected genes from
this subfamily are presented in Figure 5. Amino acid residues identified as directly interacting with ligands in highresolution crystal structures are indicated in bold type. As

Estimates of ω ratios for individual codons in the LBDs of 7 NR genes and the AHR gene
Estimates of ω ratios for individual codons in the LBDs of 7 NR genes and the AHR gene. The graphs in (A)
through (H) plot the estimated ω ratios for individual codons of the LBDs of 7 NR genes and the AHR gene derived from the
'best minimum' PAML discrete model. The location of the α-helices in the LBDs of the NR genes that correspond to codons
are indicated in the abscissas (e.g., 'H1' denotes α-helix-1; 'H1-H3 insert' denotes the insertion region in the NR1I subfamily
proteins between helix-1 and helix-3); the location of the PAS-B domain is also shown for the AHR gene. CAR lacks the H1-H3
insert but this region is plotted in (E) to keep the alignment consistent between (A) VDR, (C) PXR, and (E) CAR. Due to difficulties in alignment and extreme sequence divergence for VDR and PXR in the H1-H3 insertion region, PAML analysis for this
region could be performed for mammals only for the PXR genes. For NR1I1, NR2B2, and NR3C4, analysis restricted to mammals resulted in a best minimum PAML discrete model of only one ω ratio population (i.e., the M0 model); therefore, only data
for all vertebrate species is plotted for those three genes (note also that the CAR gene is only found in mammals). The plots in
(A), (C), and (E) show data for all three NR1I subfamily members and reveal that PXR has the widest variation of ω ratios
across codons both within this subfamily (with CAR intermediate between PXR and VDR) and compared to the other NR
genes.

Figure 5
Sequence alignment of the LBD of PXR, VDR, and CAR genes
Sequence alignment of the LBD of PXR, VDR, and CAR genes. The locations of the α-helices above the amino acid
sequences are based on the structures determined from x-ray crystallography of human PXR and human VDR [73, 88]. Amino
acid resides highlighted in bold type are residues in human PXR, human VDR, mouse CAR, and human CAR shown to directly
interact with structurally diverse ligands. These residues have been determined by x-ray crystallography and, in some cases, by
additional molecular modelling for human VDR [39, 88-90], rat VDR [91], human PXR [37, 38, 73], mouse CAR [40, 92], and
human CAR [81]. The ligands for the various receptors are: human VDR – calcitriol [39, 88, 89], 20-epi calcitriol analogs [89],
calcipotriol, seocalcitol [39], 1α,25-lumisterol [90]; rat VDR – 2-carbon substituted vitamin D3 analogs [91]; human PXR –
SR12813 [73], hyperforin [38], rifampicin [37]; mouse CAR – 5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol (androstenol) [92], TCPOBOP [40]; and
human CAR – 5β-pregnan-3,20-dione and 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO) [81]. The amino acid residues highlighted in red underlined boldin Xenopus laevis BXRα and BXRβ correspond to codons that show evidence of positive selection in a previously published phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide
variation in the BXRα and/or BXRβ lineages [30]. Note that of the 23 amino acid residue positions identified as having high
probability of having experienced positive selection in the BXRα and/or BXRβ lineages, 9 are orthologous to or adjacent to
residues that are orthologous to human PXR residues shown to directly interact with the ligands SR12813, hyperforin, and/or
rifampicin in x-ray crystallographic structures of the human PXR [37, 38, 73]; an additional two residues are orthologous to ligand-binding residues in human VDR [39, 88-90] and, also in one case, human and mouse CAR as well [40, 81, 92].

can be seen from inspection of Figure 5 and highlighting
the shared history of PXRs, CARs, and VDRs, a number of
orthologous amino acid residues are involved in ligand
binding at more than one receptor. For example, leucine240 of the human PXR directly interacts with the antibiotic rifampicin [37] and hyperforin (active component of
the herbal anti-depressant St. John's wort) [38]; the
orthologous residue in human VDR (L227) directly interacts with calcitriol analogs [39] while the same position in
mouse CAR (L168) binds the pesticide contaminant 1,4bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridoxyl)]benzene (TCPOBOP)
[40].
In a previous publication, the authors have determined
codon positions in the Xenopus laevis BXRs that show evidence for positive selection in the evolution of this unusual lineage of PXRs; 23 such codons were identified, and
all were located in the LBD of the BXRs [30]. The BXRs are
notable in the PXRs for having lost the ability to be activated (and presumably to bind) structurally diverse ligands. In addition, these receptors have a tissue expression
pattern markedly different than other PXRs, being found
at high levels in gonadal tissue but not xenobiotic-metabolizing organs such as liver or the intestines [41-43], and
are activated efficaciously only by benzoate compounds
that have a role in frog development [41,42,44]. Interestingly, 9 of the 23 amino acid residue positions in the BXR
lineages that have evidence of positive selection are
orthologous to or directly adjacent to residues that are
orthologous to human PXR residues shown to directly
interact with the ligands SR12813, hyperforin, and/or
rifampicin in x-ray crystallographic structures of the
human PXR (Figure 5); an additional two residues are
orthologous to ligand-binding residues in human VDR
and, also in one case, to ligand-binding residues in
human and mouse CAR as well. The evidence is consistent
with positive selection in the evolution of the BXRs being
directed at the LBD to alter ligand specificity, in large part
by targeting amino acid residues capable of directly interacting with ligands. This has presumably been a significant factor underlying the much narrower ligand
selectivity observed in the modern BXRs.
The NR1I subfamily members also differ markedly in conservation of ligand-binding residues across vertebrate species. Figure 6 shows for VDRs, PXRs, and CARs how many
species differ from the human receptor at the amino acid
residue positions known to interact directly with ligands.
VDRs show tight conservation of ligand-binding residues.
Only 4 of 22 amino acid residues show any variation at all
across species, ranging from jawless fish (sea lamprey),
teleost fish, reptiles, frog, birds, and mammals (Figure
6A). PXRs, on the other hand, show extensive amino acid
sequence divergence at ligand-binding residues with only
3 of 23 positions conserved across all 13 vertebrate PXRs

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

currently sequenced; for 9 of 23 positions, over half of the
non-human PXRs have an amino acid residue different
from the human sequence (Figure 6B). CARs also show
more divergence at ligand-binding positions than human
VDR but not as great as the PXRs, although the analysis is
limited due to the presence of CAR genes only in mammals (Figure 6C).
Functional studies of VDRs and PXRs and a proposed phylogeny of
the NR1I subfamily
Previous studies have revealed the broad ligand specificity
of mammalian and chicken PXRs; these receptors are activated by a structurally diverse array of xenobiotics and
endogenous compounds including bile salts, steroid hormones, and prescription drugs [30,44-50]. A recent study
has revealed that while zebrafish PXR does not respond to
mammalian 24-carbon (C24) bile acids such as cholic
acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, or lithocholic acid, this PXR
is activated well by the zebrafish 27-carbon (C27) bile
alcohol sulfate (cyprinol sulfate) [30], a biliary bile salt
typical of the earliest biliary detergents to evolve in
vertebrates [51]. VDRs, on the other hand, have a much
more restricted ligand specificity, having adapted to bind
calcitriol at nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity [52].
Mammalian VDRs do, however, have the ability to be activated by the toxic secondary bile salt lithocholic acid and
its metabolites, a function that confers a protective role in
the intestine against this toxic secondary bile acid [53].

Figure 7 examines the response of four PXRs and two
VDRs to pregnenolone (a pregnane steroid), scymnol sulfate (a C27 bile alcohol sulfate from cartilaginous fish),
petromyzonol sulfate (an unusual C24 bile alcohol sulfate
from the sea lamprey), 3-ketolithocholic acid (a metabolite of lithocholic acid), calcitriol, and a benzoate analog
(n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate). Human PXR is activated
by micromolar concentration of all 6 compounds except
calcitriol (Figure 7A). As previously proposed [30], activation of human PXR by 'early' bile salts such as petromyzonol sulfate and scymnol sulfate likely represents an
'ancestral' property retained in mammalian PXRs (in contrast, unconjugated scymnol, the precursor to the excreted
scymnol sulfate, was inactive at all receptors tested). Similar to human PXR, zebrafish PXR is activated by pregnenolone, scymnol sulfate, and the benzoate analog, but not
by the other compounds (Figure 7B). The lack of activation of zebrafish PXR by petromyzonol sulfate may be a
result of this compound being an unusual C24 bile alcohol
sulfate. The sea lamprey has apparently independently
evolved the ability to cleave the cholesterol side-chain
because C24 bile alcohol sulfates are not found in other
fish, and the peroxisomal mechanisms used to cleave the
cholesterol side-chain of C24 bile acids evolved more
recently than our last common ancestor with lampreys

Figure 6
Conservation of ligand-binding residues in VDR, PXR, and CAR
Conservation of ligand-binding residues in VDR, PXR, and CAR. From high-resolution, x-ray crystallographic structures of human VDR, rat VDR, human PXR, mouse CAR, and human CAR bound to various ligands, the amino acid residues
that directly interact with ligands are known (see Figure 5; also see Additional file 1: Genes used for phylogenetic analysis for
complete list of species available and their accession numbers). (A) Of the 22 amino acid residues shown to interact with ligands at human and/or rat VDRs, only 4 residues show any sequence variation across vertebrate species. The remaining 18 of
22 residues show complete conservation across all vertebrate VDRs (from sea lamprey to human VDRs). Eighteen VDRs were
used for the analysis. Due to partial sequence, data for the chimpanzee VDR was only available for the first two ligand-binding
residues (corresponding to human VDR Y143 and F150); in addition, data was missing for the four most C-terminal ligandbinding residues (corresponding to human VDR H397, L414, V418, and F422) for crocodile, snake, turtle, lizard, frog, and fuguβ VDRs. (B) In contrast to the VDRs, the PXRs show extensive amino acid sequence divergence at the residues shown to
interact with ligands at the human PXR. Only 3 of 23 positions are conserved throughout the 13 vertebrate PXRs while for 9
of 23 residues, over half of the PXRs have an amino acid residue that differs from that at the human PXR. Also indicated are
the 9 amino acid residues in the BXRα and/or BXRβ lineages that show evidence for positive selection (see Figure 5 legend for
more details; * indicates BXRα and/or BXRβ residue directly orthologous to human PXR ligand-binding residue; ** indicates
residue adjacent to such a ligand-binding residue). (C) CARs also show much more divergence at ligand-binding positions than
human VDR but not as great as the PXRs. The data is based on eight complete mammalian CAR sequences.

Concentration-response curves of activation of PXRs and VDRs by endogenous ligands or their analogs
Figure 7
Concentration-response curves of activation of PXRs and VDRs by endogenous ligands or their analogs. The
ordinate represents activation of the PXR or VDR, relative to vehicle control, and normalized to the maximal activator
(rifampicin for human PXR, 5α-androst-3α-ol for zebrafish PXR, n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate for Xenopus laevis BXRα, n-propyl-phydroxybenzoate for Xenopus laevis BXRβ, and calcitriol for human and sea lamprey VDRs; see Materials and Methods for
more details). The drugs tested were pregnenolone (●), petromyzonol sulfate (sea lamprey bile salt; ❍), scymnol sulfate (cartilaginous fish bile salt; ᮀ), 3-ketolithocholic acid (mammalian bile acid metabolite; ᭝), n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (▲), and
1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (calcitriol; ■). (A) Human PXR is activated by micromolar concentrations of the steroid pregenonolone, the early bile salts petromyzonol sulfate and scymnol sulfate, 3-ketolithocholic acid, and the benzoate analog. Calcitriol
does not activate human PXR. (B) Similar to human PXR, zebrafish PXR is activated by the steroid pregnenolone, the cartilaginous fish bile salt scymnol sulfate, and the benzoate analog, but not by the other compounds. (C, D) The Xenopus laevis BXRs
do not share any ligands with human and zebrafish PXRS other than the benzoate analog n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, which
activates BXRα and BXRβ robustly. (E, F) Human and sea lamprey VDRs are both activated robustly by nanomolar concentrations of calcitriol. Similar to human PXR, 3-ketolithocholic acid activates human VDR at micromolar concentrations, with an
efficacy of only 15% relative to calcitriol. Sea lamprey was not activated at all by 3-ketolithocholic acid. Weak concentrationdependent activation of sea lamprey VDR by petromyzonol sulfate (❍) was observed; however, the efficacy of this bile salt was
only ~5–6% relative to that of calcitriol. In panels (A, E, F), full-length receptors for human PXR, human VDR, and sea lamprey
VDR were used, with the reporter plasmid being CYP3A4-PXRE-Luc. In panels (B, C, D), GAL4-LBD fusion constructs were
used for zebrafish PXR and the Xenopus laevis BXRs, with the reporter plasmid being tk-UAS-Luc.

[51,54]. The Xenopus laevis BXRs do not share steroid or
bile salt ligands with human or zebrafish PXR, but are activated well by the benzoate analog (Figure 7C, D).
Despite over 500 million years since the last common
ancestor of humans and jawless fish, the human and sea
lamprey VDRs are activated very similarly by calcitriol
(Figure 7E, F). The major difference in ligands between
these two receptors is the activation of human VDR by
lithocholic acid and its metabolites (Figure 7E)[30,53]. Of
the six compounds tested, only calcitriol activated the sea
lamprey VDR efficaciously. The sea lamprey biliary surfactant petromyzonol sulfate produced a weak but concentration-dependent activation that had a maximal effect
only 5–6% that of calcitriol (Figure 7F). The possible
physiologic significance of this weak in vitro effect needs
to be correlated with in vivo experiments in sea lampreys.
Overall, VDRs are activated by nanomolar concentrations
of calcitriol, a ligand that does not activate PXRs. In contrast, zebrafish PXR and human PXR share similar activation by pregnane and androstane steroids along with early
bile salts, as indicated by other studies [30,44]. Recent
work has also revealed that activation of the zebrafish PXR
in vivo upregulates the expression of cytochrome P450
(CYP) 3A and multi drug resistance 1 (MDR1) genes [55],
properties shared by other PXRs (except in the frog)
[46,49,56,57].

Discussion
The search for genes that show evidence for positive Darwinian selection has been an important focus of molecular phylogenetics [21,22]. The genes in the NR
superfamily generally show nucleotide variation across
species consistent with strong purifying selection, particularly in the DBDs. This study applied phylogenetic
analysis by a maximum likelihood method to the entire
NR superfamily in vertebrates to analyze patterns of
nucleotide variation that may be suggestive of positive
selection. The results extend previous more limited phylogenetic analysis of PXR and CAR genes [8,29,30,58] and
clearly show that the LBDs of the PXR and CAR genes have
ω ratios at the extreme high end for the NR superfamily.
Two other genes that have similar variation in ω ratios are
DAX-1 and SHP, two NRs that lack a defined DBD and are
classified as LBD singletons [12,13]. The elevated ω ratios
in DAX-1 and SHP, relative to other NR genes, may be
related to the unique evolutionary pressures these two
genes face as domain singletons [8,11].
This possible signature of positive selection in the LBDs of
the PXR and CAR genes is consistent with the role of PXR
and CAR as sensors of toxic endogenous and exogenous
compounds that may vary across species [5,6]. For PXR
and CAR, evolutionary selection would be directed at fine-

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

tuning ligand specificity towards the most important toxic
compounds (or class of compounds) for a given species.
PXR and CAR clearly differ markedly in nucleotide variation from VDR, the other member of the NR1I subfamily;
in terms of nucleotide variation, VDR behaves like other
NRs and not PXR or CAR. The elevated ω ratios of PXR and
CAR are not simply a result of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions being increased in tandem. As
with two gene comparisons within mammals [8], synonymous substitutions rates for PXR and CAR genes across
vertebrates are average when compared to other NR genes
[30,58]. The estimated ω ratios for the codons of the LBDs
of CAR and PXR genes are also higher than those for the
AHR gene, a non-NR that qualitatively has very similar
functions to CAR and PXR, including the ability to
upregulate the expression of CYP genes involved in
detoxification of xenobiotics [34].
An additional finding with CAR was that the ω ratios for
the CAR DBD are on the higher end for the NR superfamily. This may be a reflection of the recent divergence of
the CAR gene following duplication of a pre-mammalian
PXR gene [59]. Functional diversification with higher rates
of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions is common in a gene that has recently duplicated [60,61]. Once
two copies of a gene exist, one of the two genes is free to
diversify function to evolutionary advantage although the
two genes still may share overlapping functions. The CAR
and PXR DBDs show considerable cross-reactivity with
one another in terms of interactions with target gene
response elements [62-67], extending even to the chicken
PXR [68]. This cross-reactivity highlights the close evolutionary history of PXR and CAR and may indicate that
CAR provides physiologically important redundancy to
important functions of PXR in mammals. (Note that even
PXR and VDR, which are more distantly related than CAR
and PXR, show considerable overlap in target gene regulation. VDR is able to upregulate expression of detoxifying
proteins such as CYP3A4 [53,69,70] while PXR has
recently been shown to regulate expression of proteins
involved in the metabolism of calcitriol and related
molecules [71,72]). The relatively high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions of the CAR DBD
(at least as compared to other NRs) suggests, however,
that the CAR DBD is not evolutionarily 'static' and is
diversifying to recognize other binding elements or to
interact differently than PXR with shared binding
elements.
The phylogenetic analyses presented here do have some
limitations. The number of sequences available for analysis varies markedly across the NR superfamily. For those
genes that have few sequences available, the phylogenetic
analysis will have more limited power to detect small subpopulations of codons with elevated ω ratios [22,32,33].

Page 13 of 20

Nuclear Receptor 2005, 3:2

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

On the other hand, analysis of too few genes runs the risk
of increasing false positives [22,31-33]; this was the reason a minimum of number of six genes from six different
genera was applied to the NR superfamily dataset. In
addition, difficulties in sequence alignment are a potential problem for some genes and necessitated the removal
of some codons from phylogenetic analysis. For the NR1I
subfamily, this was particularly an issue with the H1-H3
insert. This sequence was not analyzed for the PXR and
VDR genes when applied to all vertebrates. Interestingly,
the H1-H3 insert region of PXR genes within mammals
was identified as a region where a number of the codons
have estimated ω ratios greater than one. Given the role of
this region in expanding the ligand-binding pocket of
human PXR relative to other NRs [37,38,73], variation in
the H1-H3 insert region within mammalian PXRs may
have allowed for evolutionarily advantageous changes in
ligand specificity across species.

tive to other PXRs. The BXR lineage shows strong evidence
of positive selection [30], directed particularly at likely ligand-binding residues, based on comparison to known ligand-binding residues of human PXR, human VDR, mouse
CAR, and human CAR.

Figure 8 shows a proposed phylogeny of the NR1I subfamily, taking into account data from this study and others. The evolutionary history of PXR and CAR has not
been fully resolved. Experimental analysis and ongoing
genome sequencing projects have not revealed a CAR gene
in teleost fish, with zebrafish, Fugu rubripes, and Tetraodon
nigroviridis each possessing a single gene classified as a
PXR due to closer sequence and functional similarity to
mammalian PXR genes than CAR genes [9,44]. Similarly,
the chicken possesses only a single PXR/CAR-like gene
(the 'chicken X receptor' or CXR) with sequencing of the
chicken genome, extensive attempts to clone an additional NR1I receptor gene, and RNA interference of the
CXR gene coupled with functional assays failing to show
direct or indirect evidence of an additional NR1I subfamily gene member [59]. Unlike telost fish PXRs, the
CXR has equal sequence similarity to mammalian PXRs
and CARs and shares a number of properties with mammalian CARs, including high constitutive activity in in
vitro assays and lack of sequence in the H1-H3 insert
region, leading to the possibility that the CXR gene is actually a CAR gene and not a PXR gene as currently classified
[44,48,59]. The phylogeny in Figure 8 classifies the CXR as
a PXR and presents the parsimonious explanation that
fish, birds, and their ancestors possessed a single PXR gene
that duplicated in an ancestral mammal or pre-mammal.
One of the two resulting genes then diverged to the CAR
gene [59]. This hypothetical phylogeny will be strengthened or modified by analysis of PXR/CAR genes in reptiles
and additional mammals such as marsupials or
monotremes.

The presence of a high-affinity VDR in the sea lamprey, a
jawless fish with a non-calcified cartilaginous skeleton,
suggests that regulation of calcium and phosphate levels
was not a function (or a critical function) of the 'ancestral'
VDR [75]. The high concentrations of calcium in sea water
mean that maintaining adequate calcium levels in tissues
and body fluids is mainly a problem for terrestrial or fresh
water animals. In mammals, VDRs mediate a number of
functions other than regulation of calcium and phosphate
levels, with critical roles in the immune system and skin
development [76,77]. Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt), a urochordate that is the closest invertebrate relative to vertebrates for which relatively complete genome information
is available, has a single NR equally related to VDR/PXR/
CAR and a Drosophila melanogaster NR [78]. The properties
of this invertebrate gene remain uncharacterized. These
findings highlight how little is known of the physiology of
early fish and chordate invertebrates and of the role of
NRs in these animals.

As described above, the Xenopus laevis BXRs are an especially intriguing example of extensive divergence of a gene
from other vertebrate orthologs. The BXRs have dramatically altered ligand specificity and tissue expression rela-

An unanswered question in the NR1I subfamily is the
functional properties of the closest common ancestor to
PXR and VDR. Clues to this may be revealed if PXR can be
cloned and characterized from a jawless fish such as lampreys or hagfish or with exploration of invertebrate
ortholog(s) to these receptors. Sequencing of the genome
of the chordate Amphioxus, one of the closest invertebrate
relatives to vertebrates, and sea lamprey may be insightful
in this regard. There are suggestions that zebrafish PXR
may have important roles in early zebrafish development
[74], which, if true, would provide a functional link
between the zebrafish PXR and the frog BXRs [41,43].

The marked diversity of the PXR and CAR LBDs across vertebrates contrasts markedly with detailed resequencing
studies of the human PXR and CAR genes that reveal that
non-synonymous mutations in the LBDs of these genes
are rare. Resequencing of 70 individuals from three different ethnic groups for the CAR gene [58] and approximately 100 individuals from several different ethnic
groups for the PXR gene [79] showed very low nucleotide
diversity and no nonsynonymous substitutions in the
LBD of either gene. Sequencing of 253 Japanese subjects
revealed only a single non-synonymous substitution in
the CAR LBD [80]; the residue identified (valine-133) is
adjacent to a ligand-binding residue of human CAR [81]
and mouse CAR [40]. Sequencing of 205 Japanese subjects found two non-synonymous PXR substitutions
(R381W and I403V) as single alleles in separate individu-

Proposed phylogeny of the NR1I subfamily
Proposed phylogeny of the NR1I subfamily. The phylogenetic tree is based on known phylogenetic relationships between
the species combined with functional data from this study and others. Features included are activation by pregnane and androstane steroids, C27 bile alcohol sulfates (like cyprinol and scymnol sulfate), C24 bile acids (such as cholic and lithocholic acid),
benzoates, and calcitriol; ability to increase (upregulate) the expression of the CYP3A enzymes; and high constitutive (baseline)
activity. It is possible that activation of PXRs by benzoates is an ancestral property as all PXRs can be activated by at least some
benzoate compounds [44], although functional roles of these compounds have so far only been demonstrated in frogs [41, 42].
The study of ligand effects on CARs is complicated by the high constitutive activity of these receptors; many ligands act as
inverse agonists of CARs. The possible developmental role of zebrafish PXR is highlighted by its strong expression in early life
stages of zebrafish [74].

als [82]; these mutations caused modest reductions in
transactivation of a CYP3A4-based reporter [83]. Another
PXR re-sequencing study found a single D163G
substitution in 1/74 Africans and 0/418 Caucasians and a
single A370T substitution in 1/64 Africans and 0/312
Caucasians [84]. In addition, the nucleotide divergence of
the human and chimpanzee CAR and PXR genes are lower
than the average for other genes in the human genome
[29,58,85]. This suggests that important functions of the

LBDs of PXR and CAR, including ligand specificity, do not
vary significantly across human populations, and perhaps
not between chimpanzees and humans as well, but do
vary between humans and other mammals. Future studies
should identify the ligands that have shaped the variation
of PXR and CAR across species.

Conclusion
NR genes generally show strong sequence conservation
and little evidence for positive selection. The main
exceptions are PXR and CAR, genes that may have adapted
to cross-species differences in toxic compound exposure.
Future studies will be directed at precisely defining the
cross-species structural variation in CARs and PXRs and
relating this to evolutionarily relevant differences in toxic
compound exposure.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences for NR genes were downloaded from public
databases National Center for Biotechnology Information
and
(NCBI;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez)
Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org. Complete listing of all
genes, species, and accession numbers are provided in
Additional file 1: Genes used for phylogenetic analysis.
Fragmentary sequences missing 10 or more codons were
excluded from the analysis. In situations where
supporting functional data was not available, orthology
was confirmed by reciprocal BLAST searches. Sequences
were aligned with Clustal X. Regions of sequences that
could not be aligned between species were excluded from
analyses. This was primarily an issue when attempting to
align certain non-mammalian NRs with mammalian NRs,
a difficult problem especially for the PXRs [30,44]. Estimation of dN/dS (ω) ratios was carried out by maximum
likelihood using a codon-based substitution model in
PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood)
version 3.13 [25,26,28]. The input to PAML is a treefile of
the phylogeny of the sequences to be studied and a file
with aligned sequences (see Additional file 2: Sequences
used for phylogenetic analysis by PAML and Additional
file 3: Results of PAML analysis and treefiles). The phylogeny is based on known phylogenetic relationships
between the species to be studied, determined by a consensus of morphological and molecular data [86]. The
treefiles for all analyses are in Additional file 3: Results of
PAML analysis and treefiles.

PAML determines estimates of ω ratios for models of varying complexity. The most commonly applied models are
as follows (the PAML model numbers are shown in parestheses; the 'sites' refers to codons) [25,26]: model M0
(null model with a single ω ratio among all sites), M3
("discrete" model, with 2 or more categories of sites with
the ω ratio free to vary for each site at any value from 0 to
greater than 1). M7 ("β model", ten categories of sites,
with ten ω ratios in the range 0–1 taken from a discrete
approximate of the β distribution), and M8 ("β plus ω "
model, ten categories of sites from a β distribution as in
M7 plus an additional category of sites with an ω ratio that
is free to vary from 0 to greater than 1). PAML estimates

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

the ω ratios that are allowed to vary under these models,
as well as the proportion of sites (codons) with each ratio.
Of the PAML models listed above, M0, M3 and M8 can
detect positive selection (i.e., ω > 1), although it would be
unlikely that M0 would show ω > 1 for any NR gene given
the rarity of such high ω ratios across all codons of an
entire vertebrate gene or gene domain [24]. Each PAML
model generates a log-likelihood, indicating how well the
model fits the input data. Some PAML models are
"nested" within each other (e.g., M0 within M3, M7
within M8). In those cases, twice the log-likelihood difference between the two models is compared with a X2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference
in degrees of freedom between the two models [M0 has 1
degrees of freedom; M3 with two categories of ω sites
(defined in the PAML software as ncatG = 2) has 3 degrees
of freedom; M3, ncatG = 3, has 5 degrees of freedom; M3,
ncatG = 4, has 7 degrees of freedom; M7 has 2 degrees of
freedom; M8 has 4 degrees of freedom] [25,26]. P values
for sites potentially under positive selection are obtained
using a Bayesian approach in PAML [87]. The accuracy
and power of PAML models increases with more
sequences and longer length sequences [32,33]. Analyses
were only performed if at least six species from six separate genera were available. Below six taxa, the power of
PAML to detect positive selection is limited, and the risk
of false positives increases [22,31-33]. Simpler PAML
models are preferred unless a more complex model fits
the data significantly better. Data from a more complex
PAML model is presented only if twice the log-likelihood
difference between that model and the closest simpler
model (e.g., M0 compared with M3, ncatG = 2; M7 with
M8) differs significantly with a P < 0.05 according to a X2
distribution.
Functional assays of PXR and VDR
Ligand activation of PXRs and VDRs was determined by a
luciferase-based functional assay using methods previously described [30]. Briefly, HepG2 (human liver) cells
stably expressing human Na+-taurocholate cotransporter
(NTCP; SLC10A1) were used [30]. For experiments
involving sulfated bile salts, human OATP (OATP; SLC21)
was co-transfected at 10 ng/well to facilitate bile salt
uptake. Mouse VDR (IMAGE clone 3710866) and pCMVsport6 vectors were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The zebrafish RXRβ cDNA clone (IMAGE clone
5410111) was obtained from ATCC (Manassus, VA, USA).
The expression vectors were either full-length receptors
(i.e., containing both a DBD and LBD; human PXR,
human VDR, mouse VDR, sea lamprey VDR) or GAL4/
PXR chimeras that contain only the LBD of the PXR receptor (BXRα, BXRβ, and zebrafish PXR). For the full-length
expression vectors, the reporter plasmid was CYP3A4PXRE-Luc, a construct that contains a promoter element

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Nuclear Receptor 2005, 3:2

from CYP3A4 (recognized by PXR and VDR DBDs) driving luciferase expression. For the GAL4/LBD expression
constructs, the reporter plasmid was tk-UAS-Luc, which
contains GAL4 DNA binding elements driving luciferase
expression. The sea lamprey VDR cDNA was co-transfected with zebrafish RXRβ (15 ng/well) for more robust
expression [30,75].
It should be pointed out that cross-species differences in
the DBDs of various PXRs could impact the ability of a
particular PXR to activate the human CYP3A4-based promoter driving luciferase expression. However, this is
unlikely to affect the pharmacology of the various ligands
studied in this report, particularly as ligand activation of a
particular receptor was normalized to a specific maximal
activator. The most distantly related PXRs to the human
PXR, zebrafish PXR and frog BXRα and BXRβ, were studied using GAL4-LBD fusion constructs, so issues of crossspecies differences in the DBD do not affect those receptors in this study. Although the sea lamprey is evolutionarily distant from mammals, the full-length sea lamprey
VDR robustly activates the CYP3A4-PXRE-Luc reporter in
response to calcitriol.
Activation of receptor by ligand was compared to receptor
exposed to identical conditions without ligand ('vehicle
control'). In general, dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was used
as vehicle and was adjusted to be 1% (v/v) in all wells. A
control was also run with transfection of 'empty' vector
(i.e., lacking the receptor cDNA) and reporter vector to
control for activation of reporter vector by endogenous
receptor(s). In experiments with a variety of activators,
activation by endogenous receptors was not seen.
Experiments were performed in quadruplicate and
repeated for a total of at least three times. Concentrationresponse curves were fitted using Kaleidagraph software
(Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). Data are presented
throughout as mean ± S.E.M. In combining data from
multiple experiments, the pooled variance was calculated
by the formula spooled = {[(n1-1)s12 + (n2-1)s22 + ... + (nk1)sk2]/[N-k]}}-1/2, where there are N total data points
among k groups, with n replicates in the ith group.
Each PXR or VDR construct was tested with compounds
previously shown to be robust activators of the respective
receptors [30]. To facilitate more reliable cross-species
comparisons, complete concentration-response curves for
ligands were determined in the same microplate as determination of response to a maximal activator. This allows
for determination of relative efficacy, ε, defined as the
maximal response to test ligand divided by maximal
response to a reference maximal activator (note that ε can
exceed 1). Compounds with ε < 1 were considered 'inactive.' The maximal activators and their concentrations for
the PXRs and VDRs studied are as follows: human PXR –

http://www.nuclear-receptor.com/content/3/1/2

10 µM rifampicin; zebrafish PXR – 20 µM 5α-androstan3α-ol; Xenopus laevis BXRα – 30 µM n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate; Xenopus laevis BXRβ – 50 µM n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate; human VDR – 1 µM calcitriol; and sea lamprey
VDR – 0.3 µM calcitriol.
Scymnol sulfate was isolated from bile of the Spotted
eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) by extraction and Flash column chromatography. Scymnol sulfate was deconjugated
using a solution of 2,2-dimethoxypropane:1.0 N HCl, 7:1
v/v, and incubating 2 hours at 37°C, followed by the
addition of water and extraction into ether. Completeness
of deconjugation and assessment of purity was performed
by thin-layer chromatography using known standards.
Other bile salts and steroids were from Steraloids (Newport, RI, USA). All other chemicals were from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO, USA).
