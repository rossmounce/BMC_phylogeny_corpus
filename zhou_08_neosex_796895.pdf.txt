Abstract
Background: The regular mammalian X and Y chromosomes diverged from each other at least 166 to
148 million years ago, leaving few traces of their early evolution, including degeneration of the Y
chromosome and evolution of dosage compensation.
Results: We studied the intriguing case of black muntjac, in which a recent X-autosome fusion and a
subsequent large autosomal inversion within just the past 0.5 million years have led to inheritance patterns
identical to the traditional X-Y (neo-sex chromosomes). We compared patterns of genome evolution in
35-kilobase noncoding regions and 23 gene pairs on the homologous neo-sex chromosomes. We found
that neo-Y alleles have accumulated more mutations, comprising a wide variety of mutation types, which
indicates cessation of recombination and is consistent with an ongoing neo-Y degeneration process.
Putative deleterious mutations were observed in coding regions of eight investigated genes as well as cisregulatory regions of two housekeeping genes. In vivo assays characterized a neo-Y insertion in the
promoter of the CLTC gene that causes a significant reduction in allelic expression. A neo-Y-linked deletion
in the 3'-untranslated region of gene SNX22 abolished a microRNA target site. Finally, expression analyses
revealed complex patterns of expression divergence between neo-Y and neo-X alleles.
Conclusion: The nascent neo-sex chromosome system of black muntjacs is a valuable model in which to
study the evolution of sex chromosomes in mammals. Our results illustrate the degeneration scenarios in
various genomic regions. Of particular importance, we report - for the first time - that regulatory
mutations were probably able to accelerate the degeneration process of Y and contribute to further
evolution of dosage compensation.

Background

It is believed that in human and other eutherian mammals,
the heteromorphic sex chromosomes evolved from a pair of
ordinary autosomes between 166 and 148 million years ago
[1-4]. After the birth of the sex-determining gene, extensive
recombination suppression evolved between proto-X and
proto-Y to prevent the sexual reversal along the entirety of the
chromosome pair, with the exception of a short 'pseudoautosomal region' (PAR) [5]. Theoretical models predict that
proto-Y chromosomes would further suffer a rapid accumulation of deleterious mutations and be subjected to drastic gene
loss [6], consistent with only 45 genes surviving on the
human Y chromosome as compared with 1,000 functional
genes on the X [1,3,7]. Y degeneration is expected to be driven
by multiple forces, including Muller's ratchet, background
selection, the Hill-Robertson effect with weak selection, and
the 'hitchhiking' of deleterious alleles by favorable mutations
[5]. These factors can work on both ancient Y and heterosynaptic autosomes with suppressed recombination because of
the diminished efficiency of natural selection along them.
Newly evolved sex chromosome systems are required to test
hypotheses about Y degeneration because ancient Y chromosomes bear few remaining traceable ancestral sequences.
Such cases include the recently originated sex determination
system, like that of Silene [8], or 'neo-sex chromosomes',
formed through a recent fusion or translocation between an
autosome and a sex chromosome followed by extensive
recombination suppression, and thus showing inheritance
patterns like that of the better known ancient sex chromosomes [9,10].
Our current knowledge of neo-sex chromosome evolution is
primarily due to extensive work in Drosophila and plants
[8,10-12]. Most of them focused on degeneration patterns in
protein-coding regions of neo-Y alleles. However, given the
elaborate regulation of gene expression [13,14], the scenarios
of Y degeneration involving both gradual loss of functions of
protein products as well as regulatory disorders remain to be
elucidated. Furthermore, sex chromosome systems have
evolved independently in different phyla many times, creating a need to examine their evolution in different taxa [15].
Sex chromosomes in mammals, including our own, have different autosomal origins from those of other organisms,
involving entirely distinct gene sets in the process of sex
determination and dosage compensation [15,16]. The inhibition of recombination between the mammalian proto-X and
proto-Y was achieved through chromosomal inversions on
the Y chromosome, whereas it was achieved through zero
crossover in male germline cells in Drosophila [5,17]. Finally,
different generation time and population size between mammals and other species would have great impact on the rate
and patterns of mammalian Y-chromosome degeneration
[18].
Thus, direct investigation of a neo-sex chromosome system in
a mammal promises new insights into several fundamental

Volume 9, Issue 6, Article R98

issues, including both mode and tempo of mammalian Y
degeneration, and how mammals cope with degenerated Y
alleles before the creation of Xist-dependent dosage compensation [19]. In this study we sought to address these questions
using the black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons), an Asian
barking deer, as the model [20]. In this species, a male-specific extensive chromosome inversion on autosome 4 and
fusion of its homolog to the ancient X [21,22] has led to the
very recent creation (within the past approximately 0.5 million years) [23] of a neo-sex chromosome system, similar to
the inferred creation of the ancient mammalian X-Y system.
Such a rare nascent mammalian neo-sex chromosome system
provides an unprecedented opportunity to study sex chromosome evolution in mammals.

Results and discussion
Neo-sex chromosomes in the black muntjac
The black muntjac is endemic to a narrow region of southeastern China [20]. Habitat disruption in recent decades has
rendered the species one of the most endangered mammals in
the world. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a compact karyotype, with 2n = 8Ǩ/9ǩ, and half of the genome forms a pentavalent (Figure 1a) during male meiosis [24]. The
chromosome 4 pair has been shaped by several large chromosomal events. First, one copy experienced a centric fusion to
the regular X chromosome, forming a new 'X+4' (see Additional data file 1). In addition, the short arm of chromosome 1
has undergone a male-specific translocation to the homologous chromosome 4, creating a primitive '1p+4' chromosome
[21,22]. Surprisingly, subsequent inversions involving large
part of the primitive 1p+4 were proposed to take place in male
black muntjacs (regions from '22a' to '17a'; Additional data
file 1) [21,22]. We further confirmed this chromosomal rearrangement using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) with two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
of the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac vaginalis) as
probes (Figure 1b). The green signal in the middle of X+4 has
switched its location to the distal end of 1p+4 as a result of the
inversion (Figure 1b). Because no inversion loop has been
detected during meiosis of male black muntjacs [24], the
whole 1p+4 should remain heterosynaptic except for the two
distal ends, which are not involved in the inversion. These two
ends are analogous to those of ancient human Y chromosome,
which can still synapse with each other and can thus be
regarded new 'PAR's. The X+4 chromosome can thus be
regarded as a 'neo-X', and the 1p+4 as a 'neo-Y' chromosome,
because of probable lack of recombination in the inverted
region.
The black muntjac X+4:1p+4 neo-sex chromosome pair comprises approximately one-fifth of the entire genome and thus
bears thousands of neo-sex gene pairs [21,24]. Although Xautosome fusions were also detected in other muntjac species, such 1p+4 inversion is found exclusively in male black
muntjacs [25]. The absence of such a system within Muntia-

cus genus, from which black muntjac is estimated to have
diverged within the past 0.5 million years [23], indicates a
very recent origin, and makes this system the youngest known
mammalian neo-sex systems.

Variation pattern in neo-Y noncoding regions
To seek molecular evidence for inhibition of recombination
and to compare the evolutionary patterns of neo-X and neo-Y
chromosomes, we sequenced the intergenic and intronic fragments from the inverted region composing a total of 35.1 kilobases (kb), as well as 12.6 kb from the new 'PAR's and
autosomal regions for two male and one female black muntjacs, as well as the orthologous segments from one male
Indian muntjac, which is taken as the outgroup.
Under neutrality, intraspecific genetic diversity (θ) is
expected to be proportional to the effective population size
(Ne) times the mutation rate (μ; specifically, θ = 4Neμ) [26].
Therefore, if recombination has authentically ceased between
neo-Y and neo-X, then we would expect a reduced DNA polymorphism caused by reduced Ne for the neo-Y regions [6,27].
Otherwise, the polymorphism level of neo-Y should be similar
to that of 'PAR' regions or autosomes. Consistent with the
former expectation, we found a significantly lower number of
segregating sites (χ2 test, P < 0.01; see Materials and methods
[below]) and a lower polymorphism level of neo-Y regions
(0.00168 ± 0.00120 versus 0.00190 ± 0.00029) compared

with regions that undergo homologous meiotic pairing (Table
1), indicating suppression of recombination between neo-Y
and neo-X. Of course, other factors including the Hill-Robertson effect, background selection, hitchhiking effect, or
Muller's ratchet could have all reduced the polymorphism
level within the investigated noncoding regions [6]. In contrast, the 'male-driven evolution' effect, which proposes that
the neo-Y would undergo more rounds of cell division per
generation in male than in female germlines, would increase
the mutation rate and polymorphism level of neo-Y alleles
compared with those of neo-X and autosomes [28]. Our phylogenetic analysis of neo-X and neo-Y sequences in the male
black muntjac confirms that the neo-Y alleles have accumulated far more mutations than neo-X (Figure 2; statistically
significant, by Tajima's relative rate tests, P < 0.001).
A direct estimate of the degree of male-driven evolution effect
(α) on neo-Y can be derived from the comparison of branch
lengths of homologous neo-Y and neo-X. We calculated the
ratios of neo-Y to neo-X mutations separately from internal,
external, and summed branch lengths of neo-Y and neo-X,
and we further estimated the α values based on the method
proposed by Miyata and coworkers [29] (Table 2; see Materials and methods [below]). Because all of the ratios are higher
than 3, the α values estimated from different branches all
approach to infinity [29]. This indicates a strong male-driven
effect on the neo-Y chromosome in the male black muntjac,

and a small effect of ancestral polymorphism on the estimate
[29-31]. It has been reported that great variation in mutation
rates in different genomic regions greatly affect the estimation of α value [32]. However, such effects may be limited in
our case because the investigated regions are randomly sampled along the neo-Y chromosome and then concatenated
together to represent a chromosome-wide estimate (see
Materials and methods [below]). Male-specific methylation
effects in the germline may also make little contribution to
such differences in mutation rate between neo-X and neo-Y
alleles. It predicts a greater GC content on neo-X alleles and
an elevated rate of C → T transitions on neo-Y alleles [33].
However, we detected a similar GC content and an almost
identical ratio of GC → AT versus AT → GC substitutions
between the neo-Y and neo-X alleles (Additional data file 2).

Table 1
Segregating sites and polymorphism in noncoding sequences of
different genomic regions in two male black muntjacs

The net effect of all of these factors explains why the polymorphism of neo-Y region (0.00168) is one-quarter higher than
that of recombining regions (0.00190/4; Table 1). Finally,
other factors, including sexual selection and population subdivisions, could have effects on the polymorphism pattern
[34]. These findings indicate that it is highly likely that
recombination has ceased between the inverted neo-Y region
and its homolog.

Degeneration in coding regions of neo-Y-linked genes
Because of the limited sample size of neo-Y alleles, the polymorphism data exhibit a high degree of variance, and differences between recombining and nonrecombining noncoding
regions may only be indicative rather than statistically significant (Table 1). That stated, we continued to seek for other
typical evidence of recombination inhibition (accumulation
of deleterious mutations due to reduced efficiency of natural
selection) [6]. To evaluate the degeneration effects of such
mutations on neo-Y-linked genes, we characterized 23 gene

pairs that are located in the inverted region on the neo-Y
chromosome (Additional data file 1), one pair in the neo-Y
'PAR' region, and six pairs on autosomes. These genes were
selected based on the annotations of BAC sequences of the
Indian muntjac and cow genomic information in order to represent a diversity of regions across the neo-sex chromosomes
[35]. In total, we obtained about 25 kb cDNA sequences in the
inverted region and 6.3 kb in noninverted regions from two
male black muntjacs, one female black muntjac, and one male
Indian muntjac.
Among the 23 gene pairs located in the inverted region, we
observed 14 mutations in eight genes shared by the two males
in the protein-coding or untranslated regions (UTRs) of the
neo-Y alleles (Table 3). In contrast, we detected no variation
in genes located in the neo-Y 'PAR' region. For the autosomal
region, only one out of six genes is heterozygous at one site in
both the two male black muntjacs. Such an elevated rate of
gene evolution exhibited by neo-Y alleles relative to their neoX homologs and other autosomal genes is consistent with
reduced efficiency of natural selection against deleterious
mutations in the neo-Y. Combined with the variation patterns
in intronic and intergenic regions (see the section above),
these findings confirmed the recombination inhibition on the
neo-Y chromosome.
Specifically, four nonsynonymous substitutions shared by the
two male black muntjacs and two polymorphic nonsynonymous substitutions in one of the males were observed (Table
3). Of these six changes, four are highly conserved in amino
acids across six other eutherian mammals (human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, rat, and cow; Table 3). These four mutations
change the polarity or charge of the amino acid, which might
severely affect the protein function of the neo-Y copies. We
also detected a neo-Y-linked deletion in 3'-UTR of the gene
SNX22 in both males investigated. This deletion abolishes a

microRNA target site (see below) and thus may affect stability
of the neo-Y allele's mRNA [36,37]. By taking into account the
above-described four possible deleterious nonsynonymous
mutations and the deletion in the 3'-UTR of SNX22, we conservatively estimate the rate of accumulation of deleterious
mutations in exon regions of neo-Y genes to be approximately
0.4 mutations/kb per million years (5 mutations/25 kb per
0.5 million years). We also estimated that only about 1.3 nonsense mutations would be expected within 25 kb of investigated cDNA sequences, assuming equal chance of mutation at
each site (see Materials and methods [below]). Such a low
probability of nonsense mutation plus the effect of possible
purifying selection give credence to our observation that there
were no coding frame-disrupting mutations among the investigated muntjac neo-Y alleles.
This finding differs from that of a recent investigation conducted in the neo-sex system of Drosophila miranda [38],
which found that the neo-Y alleles of 24 out of 64 genes contain premature stop codons and/or frameshift mutations,
suggesting an average loss rate of 20 genes per million years
in the proto-Y of Drosophila. Such a drastic difference in the
degeneration rate between neo-Y chromosomes of mammals
and Drosophila could be attributable to the great differences
in their mutation rates (2.2 × 10-9 versus 3.1 × 10-7 per base
per year for mammal and Drosophila, respectively) [39,40],
generation time, DNA repair efficiencies [41], and effective
population size [18]. It also suggests that, during the nonlinear process of mammalian Y degeneration [3], the rate of gene
loss might be very slow in the early stage of mammalian Y
chromosome evolution.
Multiple factors can fix the above neo-Y specific mutations in
populations in both coding and noncoding regions, such as
Muller's ratchet, background selection, hitchhiking effects on
linked deleterious mutations, and faster mutation rate in

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R98

Genome Biology 2008,

males [6,28,42,43]. Muller's ratchet must have had strong
effect on accumulation of these mutations, given that the
number of mutant-free chromosomes in a population is positively correlated with the effective population size (Ne) [6,18].
Because of the usual small Ne values of mammals, mutantfree neo-Y alleles should be vulnerable to an irreversible loss
by random drift by the 'ratchet' process, which further leads
to accumulation of deleterious mutations. It is less likely that
the observed neo-Y variations were from either ancestral polymorphism or gene conversion between neo-X and neo-Y,
because we used both female black muntjac and Indian muntjac genes as the references to define neo-Y mutations [42]. It
is also less likely that there were recent selective sweeps on
the neo-Y of the black muntjac, based on the DNA polymorphism data. Recent strong positive selection would homogenize the neo-Y chromosomes among individuals [6], but we
observed many polymorphic sites existing in both noncoding
and coding regions of the muntjac neo-Y chromosome
(Tables 1 and 3). Regarding other processes, because of the
difficulty associated with collecting population data for such
a rare species, we cannot currently test the existence of either
a slower rate of adaptive evolution [44] or background selection [6], as previously proposed for D. miranda [10].

Degeneration in cis-regulatory regions of neo-Y-linked
genes
Recent studies have revealed that cis-regulatory regions more
often underlie the expression divergence between species and
evolution of morphologic diversity [14,45,46]. Apart from the
direct evidence of degeneration in coding regions presented
above, we sought to survey degeneration in regulatory regions
on the neo-Y chromosome. We analyzed putative promoters
expanding 1.5 kb around transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of
eight neo-Y genes, which have mutations shared by the two
male black muntjacs in their protein-coding/UTR regions
(Table 3).
We detected neo-Y specific mutations shared by both males
present in the investigated regions in three out of eight genes
(see Additional Data File 3). In order to assess the effect of
these mutations on gene expression, allelic promoters were
subsequently cloned into pGL3-Basic plasmid in front of a
firefly luciferase reporter gene. Each plasmid was mixed with
a plasmid (pRLs-TK) containing a constitutive promoter driving sea-pansy luciferase reporter gene and co-transfected into
Hela cells and male black muntjac fibroblast cells. The ratios
of firefly luciferase to sea-pansy luciferase, representing normalized promoter activity, were compared between neo-Ylinked promoters and neo-X-linked promoters. We found a
significant decrease in neo-Y promoter activity in both Hela
and black muntjac cell lines for the CLTC gene (Figure 3). We
did not detect promoter activities for the cloned fragments of
other two genes; specifically, there is no detectable expression
of the reporter genes using the cloned fragments as the promoters. The only detected neo-Y specific mutation is a 1 base
pair (bp) insertion 55 base pairs upstream of the putative TSS

of the CLTC gene shared by both males (Additional data file
3). It is probably the mutation responsible for reducing the
transcription level of neo-Y, given that this region was proposed to contribute positively to the core promoter activity by
a recent comprehensive analysis of 387 promoter structures
in humans [47].
In addition to mutations in promoter regions, we also
detected a neo-Y specific deletion shared by both male black
muntjacs in the 3'-UTR of the gene SNX22 as mentioned
above (Table 3). The abundance of microRNA targeted
sequences in this region drove us to investigate whether this
deletion would affect such motifs [36,37]. Using human
microRNA database as a reference, we found that the deleted
region on the neo-Y is in fact predicted to be a binding motif
targeted by the microRNA hsa-mir-210 [48], which also has
orthologs in cow and mouse with validated expression.
Intriguingly, we found evidence that this same microRNA targeted motif is also deleted because of male-specific RNA editing in intact neo-X alleles (see Additional data file 4); 23 bp
overlapping the target sequence are absent from transcripts
in males (the edited form is much less frequent in females; see
Additional data file 5). The diminutive size of the involved
sequence and lack of splicing boundaries suggest that it is a
true RNA editing event rather than a splicing event. It could
be a result of selection against allelic expression imbalance
between neo-X and neo-Y or a sign of degeneration of trans
factors on neo-Y in males, which control the RNA-editing
degree in the 3'-UTR of SNX22.
One of the fundamental issues in the process of Y-chromosome degeneration is whether it is mainly driven by direct
degradation of the protein products (for example, in D.
miranda) or reducing gene expression levels on an evolving Y

[6]. Our results suggest that these two processes may work in
concert after the immediate recombination suppression on
the neo-Y chromosome. It is proposed that deleterious mutations with mild fitness effects have a higher rate of fixation on
a degenerating Y [6], as illustrated in Table 3. After accumulation of such mutations in the protein coding regions, a subsequent reduced expression of Y would be favored by natural
selection to prevent the production of defective Y-linked
products [6,18]. Alternatively, reduced expression of Y may
take place before the accumulation of deleterious mutations
in protein products. In the case of CLTC and SNX22, both are
broadly expressed genes in most of the human tissues, with
orthologs present in all vertebrates whose genomes have been
sequenced. CLTC plays an critical role through coating membrane vesicles during endocytosis [49] and SNX22 is a member of the protein family responsible for protein trafficking
[50]. The protein coding regions of these housekeeping genes
must be under strong selective constraints, in which no amino
acid replacement substitution was detected (Table 3). On the
other hand, recent studies showed that cis-regulatory regions
- especially microRNA and transcription factor binding sites usually have lower interspecies sequence conservation compared with protein coding regions, suggesting that regulatory
mutations can be more easily fixed [46,51].
This suggests a scenario involving two independent steps of
degeneration. First, mutations in regulatory regions (for
example, the promoter of CLTC) would decrease or even turn
off the gene expression of the Y alleles. Second, decreased
expression could reduce selective constraints acting on the
protein products of proto/neo-Y-linked genes [52]. We note
that both these processes could in fact be favored to maintain
the optimal gene dose between males and females after the
establishment of dosage compensation in X [53]. Also, both
processes would further accelerate the degeneration process
in the Y-linked coding regions, which is supported by the
recent finding that lower expressed neo-Y genes appear to
have a faster accumulation rate of deleterious mutations in D.

Transcription divergence between neo-Y and neo-X
alleles
We semi-quantified and compared the mRNA abundance of
neo-Y and neo-X alleles in 11 genes with mutations listed in
Table 3. Consistent with our promoter assay, CLTC exhibits a
lower expression level on neo-Y. We found significant expression difference between neo-Y and neo-X allele only in the
gene SNX22 (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01). However, this gene
was further excluded from the result, together with SCN1A,
because of their effects of allelic-biased amplification (see
Materials and methods [below]). Eight of the remaining nine
genes exhibited differential expression; interestingly, as
many showed higher expression on neo-Y as on neo-X (4 versus 4; Figure 4). This finding suggests that neo-Y alleles can
be distorted from normal expression level, either downregulated or upregulated, as a result of degenerating control of
gene expression. Together with the mutation analysis results
presented above, the expression patterns of the nine investigated genes exhibit a similar random inactivation mode of
gene evolution on a degenerating Y chromosome proposed
for D. miranda [12]. This model predicts that neo-Y genes are
randomly inactivated, regardless of their level of adaptation.
As shown in Figure 4, the regulation direction of neo-Y genes
fluctuates along the neo-Y chromosome, and between some
adjacent genes it is even opposite, suggesting that there is no
large segment inactivation in the black muntjac's neo-Y chromosome. Two genes (CLTC and ZNF24) with only synonymous neo-Y mutations exhibited lower expression level,
whereas two genes (SYNE1 and AKAP7) with nonsynonymous neo-Y mutations exhibited higher expression level. In
addition, the human orthologs of all nine investigated genes
are widely expressed housekeeping genes. Therefore, whether
a neo-Y allele is subjected to expression alteration or the
direction of alteration may be not strongly correlated with the
characteristics of the gene.
This random inactivation pattern indicates that the Xistdependent dosage compensation[19] has not spread across
the whole neo-X chromosome in females within the past 0.5
million years. This could be attributed to a lack of sufficient
time for the establishment of action of Xist on neo-X regions.
Concordantly, there is also clear molecular evidence that neoX chromosome in male D. miranda is only partially dosage
compensated [55]. A recent study [56] showed that even in
the 'ancient' sex determination system, such as that of
human, 15% of X-linked genes would escape the X inactivation, suggesting that the mammalian dosage compensation
mechanism is leaky and its evolution process might be slow.
As suggested by our results in male black muntjacs described
above, not all the neo-Y alleles have been subjected to the
reduction of gene expression. A nonspecific whole-set dosage
compensation mechanism is likely to be seriously deleterious
for genes that are transcriptionally active or are undergoing
degeneration. It is also possible that a major regulator of dosage compensation, such as Tsix gene, counteracted Xist RNA
on neo-X regions to prevent such deleterious effects [57,58].

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R98

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/6/R98

Genome Biology 2008,

However, such delicate regulation is less likely to have been
established within such a short evolutionary time. Overall, we
propose here that in the early stages, dosage compensation in
males might have evolved gradually in a gene-by-gene fashion. This model is also consistent with the conjecture that
evolution is accomplished more through small steps than
large changes [59].
Charlesworth [18] has proposed two models to describe evolution of dosage compensation in manners similar to the two
paths of Y-chromosome degeneration mentioned above. The
common features of both models involve the upregulation of
gene expression from the proto-X chromosome at the initial
stage of Y degeneration [18], which has been suggested by
recent global expression analyses conducted in Drosophila,
worm, and mammals [60,61]. One model proposed by Charlesworth suggests that there would be selection promoting
upregulation of the transcription of X alleles to compensate
for defective products, with mutations accumulated in the
coding regions of Y alleles. Alternatively, mutations could
arise to make the Y alleles less responsive to the regulatory
molecules, as exemplified by the case of CLTC in this study. It
would consequently be a passive process, upregulating the X
alleles' expression as a result of the excess of regulatory molecules from the Y alleles [18]. Further study into the paths of
Y chromosome degeneration and comparison of neo-X
expression between males and females using more gene pairs
would be able to uncover which model mainly contributes to
the Y degeneration and evolution of dosage compensation.

Conclusion

Here we characterize the recently formed neo-sex system of
the black muntjac. This unprecedented system is valuable for
studying mammalian Y-chromosome degeneration and evolution of dosage compensation. Our results provided molecular evidence for recombination suppression in the neo-Y
chromosome. As a result, excess of putatively deleterious
mutations were observed in the coding regions of the investigated genes, probably because of the Muller's ratchet effect or
background selection. Most importantly, we report here the
first study of the role of regulatory mutations during the
degeneration process of mammalian Y, and we provide
empirical data showing their degenerative effect on gene
expression. Such mutations might further accelerate the
degeneration and give rise to the evolution of dosage compensation in a gene-by-gene manner. These results demonstrate
that mammalian Y degeneration is a complex gradual process
spanning diverse genomic structures.

jac (KCB81002E) were provided by Kunming Cell Bank of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Total genomic DNA was
extracted using the PURRGENE® DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra
Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN USA), and total RNA was
extracted using RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA
USA). Based on the syntenic relationship among black muntjac, Indian muntjac, and cow and annotation results of Indian
muntjac [35], we selected genes randomly distributed along
the neo-Y chromosome, PAR region, and autosomal regions
for primer designs (Table 3). The investigated noncoding
regions are introns or flanking intergenic regions of these
selected genes. We prepared cell suspensions of the male
black muntjac for further FISH and flow sorting of 1p+4 chromosomes. The sorting procedure using a FACStar Plus flow
sorter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) and FISH
analysis using Indian muntjac BAC clones (06G7 and 07B3)
as probes were performed as previously described [21].
We used two strategies to discriminate neo-X and neo-Y alleles. First, we compared genomic DNA PCR products of Indian
muntjac, and female and male black muntjacs, and we
inferred neo-Y-specific alleles. We also used flow-sorted 1p+4
chromosomes as PCR templates to confirm the neo-Y-specific
mutations. The products were subject to sequencing with
BigDye Terminators v3.0 (Applied Biosystems) after purification (QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA
USA). Trace data were manually trimmed and aligned from
both directions using Lasergene suite (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI USA). We concatenated sequences of noncoding
regions together for further analysis. Segregating sites in
these regions were counted and polymorphism data were
analyzed using DnaSP 4.0 [62]. Confidence intervals for polymorphisms were calculated by variance [63].
If we assume the 1p+4 chromosome can recombine with its
homologous chromosome, then its polymorphism level is
expected to be similar to that of other autosomes or 'PAR'
regions. Under such a null hypothesis, we test the significance
of difference for polymorphism between 1p+4 and other chromosome regions with χ2 test. Sequences of neo-Y and neo-X
alleles were subjected to construction of phylogenetic trees
and distance calculation with MEGA 3.1 [64]. After removing
regions with indels, gene tree was constructed using the
neighbour joining and maximum likelihood method, and
distances were calculated with Kimura's two-parameter and
HKY85 model, respectively [65].
We used internal, external, and summed branch lengths in
Figure 2a to estimate α. Comparison of α estimates from different branch lengths can be used to test whether the ancestral polymorphism have affected the calculation [31].
According to the method proposed by Miyata and coworkers
[29], Y/X = 3α/(2 +α), where Y and X stand for mutation rate
for Y-linked and X-linked sequences, respectively. The variance of Y is V(Y) = Y(1 - Y)/(L [1-4Y/3]2) and the variance of
X is V(X) = Y(1 - X)/(L [1-4X/3]2), where L is the length of the

sequence [31]. The variance of Y/X is V(Y/X) = V(Y)/E(X)2 +
E(Y)2V(X)/E(X)4. The 95% confidence interval of α was estimated, following the method proposed by Huang and coworkers [30]. Because Y/X(0.001189/0.000294, internal
branches) is greater than 3 based on branch lengths of neo-Y
and neo-X in this study, the α value approaches infinity. To
estimate expected stop condon number E(S) in the investigated coding regions, we assume that only one substitution
would arise per codon, given the extremely young age of this
neo-sex system. Assuming the chances of mutation are equal
across the sequences, E(S) would be given by the following:

E ( S ) = 3μt

n

∑ i =1 pi , where μ is the estimated mammalian

mutation rate measured per base [39], t is the age of the neosex system, n is the number of the codon in the investigated
region and pi is the probability of a certain codon becoming a
stop codon.

Promoter assay
We predicted the TSS information for black muntjac genes
with ClustalW [66], using orthologous human, mouse, and
cow sequence as reference. Regions expanding 1 kb upstream
and 500 bp downstream of the predicted TSS were amplified
as putative promoter regions in black muntjacs. The PCR
products were subject to TA cloning using pMD19-T vector
(TaKaRa, Dalian, Shangdong China) for screening products
without PCR artifacts and further enzyme digestion. The
digested PCR product was cloned into pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI USA) using T4 ligase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA USA). Then the vector was transformed into competent cell (TOP10; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA
USA) and purified by QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA USA).
Hela and male black muntjac fibroblast cell lines were respectively seeded into 24-well plates to reach densities of 104 to
105 cells per well 24 hours before transfection. Generally, 0.2
μg pGL3-Basic vector with cloned promoter and 0.04 μg
Renilla (sea-pansy) luciferase vector (pRL-TK; Promega,
Madison, WI USA) were mixed in Opti-MEM® I Reduced
Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA USA) and co-transfected into cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA USA). We used pGL-Basic vector as negative
control and assayed the luciferase signal with the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter 1000 Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI
USA). The ratios of firefly luciferase to sea pansy luciferase
were compared between neo-Y-linked promoters and neo-Xlinked promoters. All of the assays for each promoter were
done in triplicate.

we observed biased amplification for only two genes, namely
SCN1A and SNX22; the extent of the amplification bias is
similar to the copy abundance difference observed in the
mRNA assay. The reaction was done for 25 to 30 cycles, and
the PCR products were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa,
Dalian, Shangdong China). Twenty to 30 white clones were
randomly picked and were subject to further sequencing. The
expression ratio of neo-Y and neo-X alleles was determined
by counting the number of separate alleles. All assays were
conducted in duplicate and double checked in both male individuals. We further compared the mean expression ratio of
duplicates for different genes.
