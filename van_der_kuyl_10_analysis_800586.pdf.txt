Abstract
Background: Two HIV-1 positive patients, L and P, participating in the Amsterdam Cohort studies acquired an HIV1 superinfection within half a year from their primary HIV-1 infection (Jurriaans et al., JAIDS 2008, 47:69-73). The aim
of this study was to compare the replicative fitness of the primary and superinfecting HIV-1 strains of both patients.
The use of isolate-specific primer sets indicated that the primary and secondary strains co-exist in plasma at all
time points after the moment of superinfection.
Results: Biological HIV-1 clones were derived from peripheral blood CD4 + T cells at different time point, and
identified as the primary or secondary virus through sequence analysis. Replication competition assays were
performed with selected virus pairs in PHA/IL-2 activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC’s) and
analyzed with the Heteroduplex Tracking Assay (HTA) and isolate-specific PCR amplification. In both cases, we
found a replicative advantage of the secondary HIV-1 strain over the primary virus. Full-length HIV-1 genomes were
sequenced to find possible explanations for the difference in replication capacity. Mutations that could negatively
affect viral replication were identified in the primary infecting strains. In patient L, the primary strain has two
insertions in the LTR promoter, combined with a mutation in the tat gene that has been associated with
decreased replication capacity. The primary HIV-1 strain isolated from patient P has two mutations in the LTR that
have been associated with a reduced replication rate. In a luciferase assay, only the LTR from the primary virus of
patient P had lower transcriptional activity compared with the superinfecting virus.
Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest the interesting scenario that superinfection occurs preferentially in
patients infected with a relatively attenuated HIV-1 isolate.

Background
Viral fitness is the parameter that is defined by the
ability of an individual genotype to produce infectious
progeny in a specific environment [1,2], and it can be
divided into transmission fitness, replicative fitness or
immune-evasion fitness. In addition to viral genetics, the
host environment, i.e. type of target cells, immune
response, antiretroviral drug treatment, plays an important role in viral fitness [1,2]. To measure replication fitness of HIV-1 in vitro, three types of assays have been

developed: replication assays, single round infection
assays and dual infection/competition assays [1]. The
last is considered the ‘gold standard’ for replicative fitness determination and involves direct competition
between different viral strains in cell culture infections
[1,3]. For all assays, either molecular clones (virus gene
of interest cloned into standard viral backbone), biological clones (single virus isolate) or a virus pool (quasispecies) can be used [1]. Competition assays have been
used to determine the relative replicative fitness of
viruses belonging to HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O
and HIV-2 [4], to show that HIV-1 fitness increases during disease progression [5,6], to suggest that HIV-1
attenuates over time [7]. In contrast to the previous
study, we and others have reported that viral fitness is

increasing over time within the HIV-1 epidemic in The
Netherlands [8,9]. This was also the case in France in
1997-2005 [10], but HIV-1 virulence was not changed
over time in North America [11].
The description of HIV-1 superinfection in vivo is
relatively new [12]. It is likely that parasites, including
viruses, able to establish a productive superinfection
have increased fitness over the primary infecting strain
(see [13,14] and references therein). In line with this,
several reports have described superinfection with a
non-drug resistant HIV-1 strain in patients first infected
with a drug-resistant HIV-1 strain with presumed lower
fitness [15-17]. Two studies compared the relative fitness of the superinfecting strain with that of the primary
strain in replication assays, but the analysis was
restricted to the contribution of the pol gene [16,17]. In
both cases no differences were observed, suggesting that
fitness determining factors may be located elsewhere in
the viral genome, as the superinfecting strains appeared
to be more fit in vivo. In another superinfection case,
two multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains were involved, of
which the first appeared more fit in competition assays.
Not much is known about the relative fitness of the
viruses in superinfection cases with HIV-1 variants lacking drug-resistance mutations. Therefore we decided to
compare the replicative fitness of the primary and secondary strain in two HIV-1 superinfection cases. Biological clones were generated and ex vivo competition
assays were performed as described earlier [5]. The ex
vivo results were compared to the in vivo observations.
The competition results suggest that, even though none
of the strains exhibited a severe replication defect, the
superinfecting virus has a higher replicative capacity
than the primary strain. Analysis of the ratio of the two
strains in blood plasma confirmed this finding. Full genome sequences of the viral clones were investigated to
detect mutations that could explain the observed differences in replication capacity.

HIV-1 strain somewhere between December 2005 and
January 2006, coinciding with a marked increase of the
viral load (marked by a vertical arrow in Figure 1A).
Similar results were obtained for the gag sequences (not
shown).
Plasma samples from patient L were tested with
strain-specific primers designed to amplify either strain
B1 or B2. In December 2005 only the B1 strain was
detected in both env-V3 and gag assays (not shown). At
all later time-points, gag and env-V3 fragments of the
B1 and B2 strain were amplified concurrently.
Patient P

Figure 2A shows the plasma viral load and CD4 + T cell
count of patient P during follow up. The env-V3 and
gag fragments amplified from plasma samples were analysed by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of both gene
fragments was performed on samples from March 2006,
August 2006 and November 2006. Figure 2B shows a
neighbour-joining tree of representative plasma-derived
clones for the env-V3 fragment (gag data not shown).
The sample from March 2006 showed only a single
cluster - subtype B strain B3, whereas a new cluster,
subtype B strain B4, was additionally present in the
August 2006 sample. Three months later B3 and B4
strain sequences were amplified together. These results
suggested that patient P acquired an HIV-1 superinfection between June 2006 and August 2006, concomitant
with a large increase in the viral load (arrow in Figure
2B).
To estimate the ratio of strains B3 and B4 over time
in vivo, we performed PCR on plasma samples with
virus specific primers (results not shown). In a sample
from March 2006 (before superinfection) only strain B3
gag and env-V3 fragments could be amplified, as
expected. In plasma samples from August 2006 and
November 2006 strain B4 gag and env-V3 could always
be amplified, but strain B3 was probably present in
lower copy numbers as it could only be amplified for
gag (August 2006) or env-V3 (November 2006).

Patient L

Figure 1A shows the plasma viral load and CD4 + T cell
count of patient L during follow up. Phylogenetic analysis of the plasma-derived HIV-1 sequences for env-V3
(Figure 1B) and gag (data not shown) were carried out
on serial samples from 2005-2006. The subtype B viral
sequences from 2005 cluster together and were named
strain B1. A new subtype B cluster was formed by
sequences from January 2006, which was named strain
B2. At that time point, the new strain B2 dominated the
viral population even though strain B1 could still be
amplified. Three months later, in April 2006, both B1
and B2 strain sequences persisted. These observations
suggest that patient L was superinfected with a second

Fitness of biological clones

Biological HIV-1 clones were generated and typed by
amplifying and sequencing of gag, vpr, env-V3, and nef
fragments. This confirmed their identity as the primary
or secondary HIV-1 strain. Since antiretroviral drugresistance mutations can influence HIV-1 replicative
fitness we analysed the protease-reverse transcriptase
(PR/RT) coding regions of the pol gene in the Stanford
University HIV drug resistance database [18]. None of
the clones displayed any drug resistance mutations (data
not shown).
For patient L we generated approximately 200 biological clones from samples collected in November 2005

and January 2006. All clones from November 2005
appeared to contain complete strain B1 viruses (data not
shown). The January 2006 sample yielded biological
clones from both strain B1 and B2. We subsequently
sequenced the full-length genome of a single clone
(B1.1) from November 2005 and two clones (B1.3, and
B2.3) from January 2006. Clones B1.1 and B1.3 consist
of strain B1 sequences whereas clone B2.3 contains a
complete strain B2 virus (Table 1). No B1-B2 recombinant viral clones were identified at the second time
point.
Five clones from patient L were tested for their replication capacity, alone or in competition experiments, in
PHA/IL-2 activated donor PBMC’s. The ex vivo relative
fitness of HIV-1 isolates in PBMC cultures correlates
with in vivo disease progression [5,6], making it an
excellent model system with clinical relevance. The
growth kinetics of individual strains indicated the
absence of severe replication defects in PBMC’s,
although clone B1.3 replicated at a lower level compared
with the other clones (result not shown).
Table 2 presents the results obtained in competitions
between one of the early B1 clones (B1.1; B1.2; B1.3)
and one of the late B2 clones (B2.3 and B2.5). The B2
clones outcompeted the B1 clone in all six pair-wise

competitions. Clone B2.3 showed the highest relative fitness. Overall, the relative fitness of clone B2.5 was
slightly lower than that of clone B2.3, but higher than
that of the B1 strains. The ranking order of relative fitness is: B2.3 ≥ B2.5 > B1.1 ≥ B1.2 >> B1.3. The outcome
of the competition experiments was confirmed by
strain-specific PCR (data not shown).
From patient P, only one biological clone was generated (strain B3) from the March 2006 sample, and
twenty clones were obtained from the August 2006 sample. These 20 clones were roughly analysed by amplifying and sequencing gag, vpr, env-V3, and nef genome
regions, and appeared to contain complete strain B4
proviruses (data not shown). We exclusively found B4
viruses and no B3 or B3-B4 recombinant viruses
amongst the biological clones from the August 2006
time-point. The only clone generated from the March
2006 sample and two clones from the August 2006 sample were completely sequenced. The single clone (B3.1)
from March 2006 was confirmed to contain a strain B3
provirus and the two clones from August 2006 (B4.2
and B4.4) indeed encoded strain B4 proviruses. The fact
that only a single clone was obtained from the March
2006 sample can probably be attributed to the low
plasma viral load (around 103 copies/ml), which by itself

the viral quasispecies present at that time.
A total of five biological clones from patient P were
selected for the competition assays: the single clone
from the first time-point and four clones from the second time-point. Individual growth kinetics of selected
clones showed only modest differences between the
primary and superinfecting strains, and no clone
showed an obvious replication defect (not shown).

suggest that the expression of members of multiple
gene families can be changed within a few hours after
virus entry (reviewed by [19]). To assess whether the
ability to influence early gene expression patterns is
related to viral replicative fitness, we performed a realtime PCR analysis of inflammatory cytokine and receptor mRNA’s of PBMC cultures infected for 6 hours
with equal TCID50 of 6 biological clones. Inflammatory cytokine genes are the most significantly upregulated genes upon HIV-1 gp120 binding to primary
blood cells, and are thus a good marker of early events
after viral infection. Early gene expression patterns
were moderately related to the replicative fitness of the
clones established earlier, whereby patterns of virus
clones with lower replication capacity, e.g. B1.1 and
B4.2, clustered with the patterns of uninfected control
PBMC’s (Figure 3). The patterns induced by potently
replicating viruses, B3.1 and B4.4, clustered together
and away from uninfected PBMC’s (Figure 3). Clone
B1.3, demonstrating an intermediate replication

capacity, indeed clustered in the gene expression assay
between the low and high replicating clones (Figure 3).
The only exception was clone B2.5 that showed a good
replicative fitness, yet yielded an early gene expression
pattern that was more similar to uninfected cells.
There clearly is a difference between early events
(receptor binding and internalization) and virus replication, suggesting that clone B2.5 is somewhat delayed
early in infection, but then has an above average replicative capacity. Although expression levels varied at
the single gene level, a few mRNA’s, e.g. those for
CCL4, CCL5, CCL18, and IL9, were upregulated in all
infected cultures compared to uninfected PBMC’s.
HIV-1 sequence analysis

Complete genomes of the two virus strains from each
patient were sequenced to identify mutations. The most
interesting findings are discussed. For patient L, the LTR
promoter sequences revealed two insertions of 16 and 13
nucleotides (nt), respectively, in the low replicating B1

biological clones B1.1, B1.3, B2.5 (patient L) and B3.1, B4.2, and B4.4
(patient P), as well as uninfected PBMC’s were analysed with the
RT2Profiler™ PCR Array Human Inflammatory Cytokines and
Receptors (SABiosciences). Cultures were infected with HIV-1 at an
MOI of 0.05. After two hours, the inoculum was removed by
centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated 6 hours after infection.
Experiments were performed in triplicate. Expression profiles were
analysed with the GCNPro™ (Gene Network Central) software [68].

clone compared with B2 viruses and with the HXB2
reference sequence (Figure 4A). Moderate insertions in
the LTR are not uncommon in HIV-1 and have been
associated with disease attenuation [20]. The insertions
in the B1 LTR occur at the type I and type II insertion
sites described by Koken et al. [3], but are dissimilar in
nucleotide sequence. The LTR insertions do not affect
the nef open reading frame. Interestingly, the second
insertion together with upstream sequences creates a
novel NF-B/NFAT binding site whereas the downstream common NF-B/NFAT binding site is hypermutated at 4 nucleotides (Figure 4A). The type I insertion in
the B1 LTR is very similar to that described for a virus

Page 6 of 15

with decreased transcriptional activity that was isolated
from a long-term non-progressing patient (no. 4) [20].
Seven additional B1 biological clones contained identical
LTR sequences, indicating that the insertions in this
region are not unique to clones B1.1 and B1.3 (result not
shown). Clone B2.3 contains a T®C mutation in the
TAR region of the LTR that could destabilize the hairpin
secondary structure (Figure 4A). HIV-1 Tat protein activates transcription by binding to the TAR hairpin in the
LTR, thereby acting as a potent activator of viral gene
expression. Mutational analysis of four highly conserved
aromatic amino acid residues within the Tat activation
domain showed that the F32 L mutation greatly reduced
Tat activity and virus replication [21]. Interestingly, this
F32 L mutation is present in 15% of the subtype B tat
sequences from 2008 [22]. The same mutation is also
present in the B1 clones of patient L (Figure 4B), suggesting that the B1 strain encodes a Tat protein with
decreased transcription activation capacity. However, the
T23 N substitution in strain B1 Tat could possibly compensate for the F32 L mutation [23].
For patient P, the LTR promoter sequence of the first
infecting virus, strain B3, carried a characteristic
TT®CA mutation in the poly A hairpin region
(Figure 4A). Such a mutation destabilizes the structure
of this hairpin (Figure 5), which may trigger premature
polyadenylation in the 5′ LTR thus reducing viral gene
expression and replication [24,25]. Analysis of the
plasma viral quasispecies at the first time point (when
only the B3 strain is present) revealed that all 16 HIV-1
LTR clones analysed contained the TT®CA substitution
in the LTR (not shown). The Tat protein encoded by
the B3.1 virus clone has 86 amino acid residues, while
the B4 clones encode a Tat protein of 101 amino acid
residues (Figure 4B). As such a short tat gene was initially observed in laboratory strains, it was suggested that
a shorter Tat protein was sufficient only for ex vivo propagation of the virus (reviewed by [26]). A premature
stopcodon at position 86 of the tat gene occurs
occasionally in all subtypes, and regularly in almost all
subtype D isolates [22]. In addition, clone B3.1 has an
11-codon repeat of the ‘PTAP’ motif at the beginning of
the gag-p6 protein reading frame that is not present in
the B4 strain (Figure 6A). A sequence repeat of 3-9
amino acid residues at this location has been associated
with low CD4 + T cell counts, drug resistance and poor
prognosis [27-29]. Interestingly, gag-p6 PTAP repeats
have linked to the presence of positively charged amino
acid residues at certain positions in the env-V3 loop
that determine co-receptor usage [27]. The 11th position
in the V3 loop of the B3.1 clone encodes the positively

webserver for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction [69], the ΔG values are presented in kilocalories per mole. A box indicates the
UU®CA change in clone B3.1.

B3.1 infected MT-2 cell cultures with induction of syncytia, indicative of CXCR4 use (result not shown). We
were, however, unable to infect U87.CD4 cells expressing either CXCR4 or CCR5 [33] with this clone. The
V3-loop of clone B3.1 has remarkable similarity to that
of subtype D virus UG21 that can use the APJ and
CCR9 receptor in addition to CXCR4 [34], suggesting it
could be different from common CXCR4 using strains,
and possibly have less affinity for U87.CXCR4 cells. The
secondary virus strain B4 of patient P was predicted to
use the CCR5 coreceptor, as were both primary and secondary strains of patient L, but this was not tested in
culture. Analysis of viral RNA present in blood plasma
at the first time point confirmed that the env-V3
sequence of clone B3.1 is present in all viral genomes
analysed (result not shown). No apparent escape mutations were seen in Gag epitopes defined by the patients
HLA type, suggestive of low CTL pressure.

Another intriguing finding is the difference in replication capacity of clones B1.1 and B1.3, where the latter
clone exhibits a substantial ex vivo replication disadvantage in competition experiments. Yet relatively little
sequence variation was found that could account for
this. A single amino acid difference was noted in the
Vpu and Rev proteins, as well as 8 amino acid differences in Env (3 in gp120, 5 in gp41). The genetic difference between clones B4.2 and B4.4, of which the former
clone has a replicative disadvantage, was also modest. In
addition to a single amino acid difference in Vif and one
in Vpu, two amino acid changes were found in the env
gene, one in the signal peptide and one in the env-V5
domain, respectively. Also, an extra glycosylation site
was present in the env-V4 region of clone B4.4. The
HIV quasispecies in a host consist of many closely
related variants, and (modest) differences in replication
capacity are to be expected. Replication curves of single

PTAPP repeat in clone B3.1 in Gag-p6 has been boxed. The 11th and 25th amino acid residues in Env-V3, associated with CXCR4 coreceptor use

LTR promoter activity

The promoter activity of the LTR region of the primary
and superinfecting HIV strains was analysed by cloning
a fragment corresponding to nt 2-536 of the HXB2 genome before the luciferase gene and subsequently measuring luciferase activity in the presence of increasing
amounts of Tat (Figure 7). There is no obvious difference between the LTRs from the B1 and B2 strain from
patient L in the human embryonic kidney cell line used,
despite the occurrence of insertions in the B1 LTR.
However, the LTR from the primary virus B3 from
patient P has a lower promoter activity than the LTR
from the superinfecting virus B4 in these cells, despite
the absence of noticeable sequence variation. Using different cell types and/or activating the promoters with
homologous Tat protein instead of HIV(LAI) Tat could
influence the results, as promoter activity has not only
been shown to be cell-type specific, but there might also

be co-evolution between the LTR and tat gene of a particular HIV strain. For example, it would be very informative to analyse LTR activity in PMA and/or
ionomycin stimulated cells, preferentially in a T-cell
line, to determine the true effect of NF-B and NFAT
upon transcription.

clones, e.g. B4.2 and B4.4, did not show significant differences in replication when cultured alone (not shown).
However, competition experiments can expose and
enlarge relatively small differences in replication capacity
[3]. Therefore, that two out of four B4 clones lost in
competition experiments from the same clone, while
two other B4 clones won the competition does not
represent evidence that the former B4 clones are largely
deficient in replicative capacity.

Discussion
In the present study the relative fitness of viral strains
involved in two HIV-1 superinfection cases was analysed. Patients L and P were identified to have experienced an HIV-1 superinfection within half a year from
the seroconversion date by a sudden unexpected rise in
the plasma viral load [35]. Both virus strains in the two
patients are supposedly “wild-type” viruses, meaning
that no drug-resistance mutations in pol or deletions or
premature stopcodons in the nef gene were found.
Therefore, these HIV-1 strains are well suited to test the
hypothesis that productive superinfection requires a second virus with a higher relative fitness than the primary
infecting strain [13,14]. The presence of an initial virus
strain with drug-resistance mutations, likely causing a
replication disadvantage, has been reported repeatedly
[15-17].
To estimate the relative fitness of the virus variants
involved in two HIV-1 superinfections, replication competent viruses were obtained by biological cloning. An
initial genome analysis was performed by PCR amplification of gene fragments and subsequent sequence analysis. For patient L, around 200 clones were obtained in
line with the relatively high plasma viral load at the
time points sampled (> 105 copies/ml). Strain B1 clones
were isolated before and after the superinfection
moment, strain B2 only after superinfection. Both the in
vitro competition experiments with multiple pairs of B1
and B2 clones and the ratio of the two strains in blood
plasma samples indicated that the second strain B2 is
the better replicating strain, in line with the hypothesis
that a more virulent strain can infect a host that is
already infected with a less virulent strain [13,14]. For
patient P the situation turned out to be more complex.
A major restriction is that only a single clone of the
initial B3 virus was obtained. This is probably due to
the extremely low viral load. In fact, the viral load
remains low for many months before superinfection
occurs. In blood plasma, gag and env-V3 fragments from
the B3 strain could not be amplified from all samples,
confirming low copy numbers of this strain. In contrast,
strain B4 sequences were abundantly present in plasma
samples taken after the superinfection moment. This
observation, together with the sustained increased
plasma viral load, suggests a significantly higher level of
replication of the second strain. In ex vivo experiments,
the single and possibly unusual B3 clone was able to
outgrow two B4 clones in the replication assays,
although it appeared less fit than two other B4 clones.
Probably, the single B3 clone isolated is one of the better replicating variants of the quasispecies, and thus not
fully representative of the B3 quasispecies of patient P
in vivo. In a luciferase assay using human embryonic

Page 10 of 15

kidney cells, the B3.1 LTR was less active as a promoter
than an LTR from the B4 strain, which could suggest
that this could also be the case in the various cell types
infected in vivo. Alternatively, strain B3 may have an
average replication capacity, but is severely suppressed
in vivo by the immune system resulting in the low
plasma viral RNA levels observed. A second strain could
experience less immune pressure such that it can replicate to higher levels [17]. However, no primary or secondary clone possessed escape mutations in the major
gag or nef epitopes targeted by the HLA-A25, -B18 or
-B44 alleles carried by the patient [36-40], thus suggesting ineffective cytotoxic T cell responses (result not
shown). Both the env-V3 sequence and culture experiments using MT2 cells suggested that clone B3.1 uses
the CXCR4 coreceptor, although patient P does not
carry CCR5-Δ32 deletion alleles (not shown). Primary
infections with CXCR4-using viruses are not unusual, as
thought earlier, although they are usually negatively
selected during primary infection. Over 15% of patients
with a primary HIV infection in two European cohorts
were infected with CXCR4-using strains [41,42].
CXCR4-using viruses are not necessarily more fit than
CCR5-using viruses. Competition experiments with biological clones showed that the average fitness of
CXCR4- and CCR5-using viruses is similar [43]. In conclusion, the combined data suggest that overall the
superinfecting virus in patient P is also a better replicating strain than the primary virus.
HIV-1 superinfection has been associated with disease
progression, as exemplified by a permanent rise in the
plasma viral load and an accelerated decrease in CD4 +
T cell numbers (reviewed in [44]). Mathematical modelling suggests that, except for the direct negative effect of
accelerated disease progression, co- and super- infections can also have an impact on the virus as a species
in the epidemic, triggering an increased replication
capacity and possibly virulence of the pathogen [14]. In
vitro experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
show that the progeny of co- and super- infections, have
a higher fitness than that of single infections as the dual
infections allow for faster adaptation by to environmental changes [45]. Low viral fitness, measured as replicative capacity, is associated with lower virulence, e.g. in
nef-deleted HIV-1 or drug-resistant HIV-1 variants
[46,47]. Studies on HIV-1 fitness and evolution have
been contradictory. A initial study suggested attenuation
of HIV-1 over time in Belgium [7], but other studies
reported increasing fitness of HIV-1 in The Netherlands
in the period 1986-2003 [8,9] and in France in 19972005 [10]. A fourth study indicated that HIV-1 virulence
is not changing over time in North America [11]. As
HIV-1 co- and super- infections are much more

van der Kuyl et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:60
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/60

prevalent in Africa (reviewed in [44]), it will be of interest to study the evolution of viral fitness in this setting.

Conclusions
The results obtained from two HIV-1 superinfection
cases suggest that an HIV-1 re-infection that gives rise
to a systemic superinfection is facilitated by a primary
infection with a less fit strain that has a lower replication capacity than the superinfecting strain. It remains
important to examine the replication capacity of viruses
from other patients with an HIV-1 superinfection to see
if the suggestion of a better replicating second virus can
be confirmed.
Materials and methods
Patients

Two HIV-1 positive patients, L and P, were found to
have an HIV-1 superinfection in an earlier study analysing sudden plasma viral load rises in patients followed
at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands [35]. Both individuals initially presented
with primary HIV-1 subtype B infections; patient L with
Fiebig stage II (vRNA+ ) and patient P with Fiebig stage
V (Western blot+ p31-) [48]. Both experienced an HIV-1
superinfection with another subtype B strain within half
a year from their first presentation. The patients participated in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) on HIV
infection and AIDS among homosexual men. Written
informed consent was obtained. HLA-typing of ACS
patients with a primary HIV-1 infection is routinely performed at Sanquin Diagnostiek (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Patient L: HLA class I: A2, A24(9), B27, B60
(40), Cw 1 and 7; HLA class II: DR1, DR12(5), DR52,
DQ5(1), DQ7(3). Patient P: HLA class I: A2, A25(10),
B44(12), B18, Cw5; HLA class II: DR15(2), DR12(5),
DR51, DR52, DQ1 and DQ3. HIV-1 blood plasma viral
load measurements were done at the Laboratory of Clinical Virology at the AMC (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with the Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay (Bayer
Diagnostics Division Tarrytown, N.Y.).
Cloning and sequencing of molecular clones from plasma

RNA was isolated from plasma samples from both
patients with a method using silica and guanidium
thiocyanate [49]. HIV-1 env-V3 and gag fragments
were reverse transcribed, amplified, cloned with the
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.),
and sequenced with the BigDye Terminator cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.)
as described [50,51]. Electrophoresis and data collection were performed on an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic
analyser (also from Applied Biosystems). At least 16
clones were analysed for each patient per time point
and per strain.

Generation of biological clones

Freshly phytohemagglutinin (bioTRADING Benelux,
Mijdrecht, The Netherlands), glutamax and interleukin2 (Proleukin, Chiron, Emeryville, Calif.) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC’s), obtained
from four healthy (HIV-1 negative) human donors, were
combined and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with
antibiotics, L-glutamine and 15% heat-inactivated foetal
calf serum for 3 days. CD8 + T cells were depleted after
2 days using the Dynabeads M-450 CD8 kit (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.). Different concentrations
of PBMC’s from the HIV-1 infected patient (104, 2.5 ×
104, 4 × 104 6 × 104 cells/well) were cocultivated with 1
× 10 6 CD4 + T cells in the same medium in 96-wells
plates for 21 and 28 days, respectively. Each 7 days culture supernatants were tested for the presence of p24
with an in-house antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At the same time, to propagate
the culture, one-third of the cell culture was transferred
to new 96-well plates and fresh PHA, IL-2 stimulated
CD4 + T cells were added. Viruses were considered to
be clonal if less than one-third of the microcultures
became positive at a given cell number (Poisson distribution). HIV-1 clones were expanded by culturing and
harvested after 7 days [52]. PBMC’s and supernatant
were cryopreserved at -150°C [53].
Analysis of gag, env, vpr and nef

To characterize the biological clones, a 804 nucleotide
fragment of the gag gene, encompassing the entire p17
gene and the 5′ part of the p24 gene, and a 264 nucleotide HIV-1 V3 fragment of the env gene were amplified
by PCR as previously described [50,51,54]. The complete
vpr gene of the biological clones was amplified and
sequenced [55]. The nef gene was amplified using 5′
End-env-s primer (5′TAG AAG AAT AAG ACA GGG
CTT GG3′) and R-LTR3′FM (5′AGA CCC AGT ACA
GGC AAA AAG CAG CTG CTT ATA3′) using Amplitaq (Perkin Elmer 5 units/μl) in a final concentration of
1.8 mM MgCl2. Amplification was done for 40 cycles,
with each cycle involving three steps: 1 min at 95°C, 1
min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C, plus a final extension
of 10 min at 72°C.
Full genome sequencing

The complete genomes of three biological clones for
each patient were sequenced (for patient L clones: B1.1,
B1.3, and B2.3, for patient P clones: B3.1, B4.2 and B4.4;
Table 1). Overlapping fragments of about 600-1000 bp
in length, spanning the entire genome, were amplified
with different primer sets and sequenced. Sequences
were compiled with CodonCode Aligner version 2.0.3
[56]. Differences between the primary and superinfecting

van der Kuyl et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:60
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/60

strain, represented by clones B1.1 and B2.3 from patient
L and clones B3.1 and B4.2 from patient P is discussed
in the Results section. Differences observed between
clones of the same strain (B1.1 vs. B1.3 and B4.2 vs.
B4.4) are discussed in the Results section as well.
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were aligned with the CLUSTAL W sequence
alignment tool implemented in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Version 7.0.9 [57]. Reference sequences
were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database [22]. The alignments were manually adjusted to
preserve in-frame insertions and deletions. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed with the MEGA4 software
package distributed by Sudhir Kumar, Arizona State
University, Tempe [58]. Distances were estimated with
the Tamura-Nei method [59], using the gamma model
to correct for multiple hits and to account for excess
transitions, unequal nucleotide frequencies, and variation of substitution rate among different sites. For the
shape parameter alpha, which describes the variation
across sites by a gamma distribution, we used a = 0.38
for env-V3 and a = 0.25 for gag [60]. Phylogenetic trees
were generated with the neighbour-joining method and
bootstrap resampling with 1000 replicates. Phylogenetic
analyses of vpr and vpu genes were performed in a similar fashion.
Transcription factor binding sites were identified in
the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences with
TFSEARCH [61] and Alibaba 2.1 [62].
Virus replication assays

Replication kinetics of biological clones was measured by
infecting pooled PHA/IL-2 stimulated PBMC’s from at
least four healthy donors. Similar amounts of p24 were
used for each viral strain. After 4 hours of infection, the
inoculum was removed by centrifugation. PBMC’s were
resuspended in complete medium and cultured for 16
days. Virus production was analysed with an in-house
p24 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) at days 0, 2, 6, 9, 13 and 16.
Growth competition assays

Different HIV-1 biological clones generated as described
above were selected based on their env-V3 sequence and
the replicative fitness was assessed in growth competition assays. The infectivity of each virus was determined
with the Reed and Muench method which yields the tissue culture dose for 50% infectivity (TCID 50 ) [63].
Briefly, each stock of biological clone was serially diluted
in quadruple and then plated with 2 × 10 5 CD4 + T
cells in a 96-well plate. Virus production was tested in
each well with an in-house p24 antigen capture enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Page 12 of 15

The growth competition assays were performed in
PHA/IL-2 activated PBMC’s as described previously
[4,8]. Pooled PBMC’s from at least four healthy donors
were infected with two different viruses at equal multiplicity of infection (0.0005 MOI). Uninfected cultures
were used as HIV-1-negative controls and monoinfected
cell cultures of each virus provided the positive controls.
Virus mixtures were incubated with 2 × 105 PBMC’s at
37°C in 5% CO2 for 25 hours, then washed three times
with 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then
resuspended in complete medium [4,7,8,43]. Cell-free
supernatant was tested for p24 antigen detection 7 days
postinfection with an in-house ELISA [64]. Two aliquots
of supernatant and cells were harvested at day 7 after
infection and stored at -80°C for further analysis.
HTA analysis of dual infections

The viral DNA of all dual-infected and mono-infected
cultures was extracted from lysed cells with the
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia
Calif.). HIV-1 DNA was amplified by PCR using a set
of external primers (ED14: 5′-TCTTGCCTGGAGCT
GTTTGATGCCCCAGAC-3′ and EnvB: 5′-AGAAAGAGC AGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-3′), followed by
nested primers (E125 5′-CAATTTCTGGGTCCCC
TCCTGAGG-3′ and E80 5′-CCAATTCCCATACATTATTGTG-3′) [65]. Both the external and nested
PCRs were carried out in a 100 μl reaction mixture
under defined cycling conditions [4,5]. The nested products from env (C3 V3) were analyzed with a heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) to determine the
composition of the virus mixture in the competition
experiments as described earlier [4,5,7,43]. The radiolabelled DNA probes were amplified from the env region
using the set of primers described above. For this PCR
reaction, one of the primers was labelled with 2 μCi of
[g-32 P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PKN,
Roche Belgium) [4]. Subsequently, labelled probes were
separated on 1% agarose gel and purified with the
QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Benelux, Venlo,
The Netherlands). The HTA reaction mixtures containing DNA annealing buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA), 10 μl of amplified
DNA from the dual infection/competition culture and
0.1 pmol of radioactive probe were denatured at 95°C
for 3 min, incubated at 37°C for 5 min and transferred on wet ice for re-annealing. DNA heteroduplexes were resolved on Criterion 5% TBE
non-denaturated polyacrylamide gels (BIORAD Belgium) for 75 min at 200 V. Gels were dried at 80°C
for 45 min, exposed and scanned with a phosphor
imager (Cyclone, Perkin Elmer Inc., Boston, Mass.)
and analyzed with the PerkinElmer OptiQuant software package [5].

Viral fitness calculations

In the competition experiments, the ratio of two viruses
produced in a dual infection was analysed with HTA
and compared to the monoinfections [5,65]. The production of individual HIV clones in a dual infection (fo)
was divided by the initial proportion in the inoculum
(io). This quotient is referred to as relative fitness (W =
f o /i o ). The ratio of the relative fitness values of each
HIV variant in the competition is a measure of the fitness difference (WD) or ratio between two HIV strains
(WD = WM/WL), where WM corresponds to the relative
fitness of more fit virus and WL corresponds to the relative fitness of less fit virus [4].
Strain-specific PCR

The results of the competition experiments were confirmed with a virus strain-specific PCR. For this purpose, a
specific nested PCR primer set was designed for each virus
strain. Primers were located in different parts of env-V3 or
gag; amplified nested PCR products have a distinct length
for each strain. The strain specific primer sets were also
used for detecting viruses in plasma samples. The amount
of DNA was estimated by comparing the intensity of the
bands on agarose gels using TINA version 2.09 g.
Gene expression profile

Early gene expression events after HIV-1 infection of
PBMC’s were assessed with the RT2Profiler™ PCR Array:
Human Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Virus stocks were available for the following clones: B1.1, B1.3, B2.5, B3.1, B4.2
and B4.4. For each virus 4.10 5 PBMC’s, isolated and
pooled from 4 different healthy donors, were infected
with a MOI of 0.05. Cells were incubated for 2 hours,
spun down, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented
with L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum
and IL-2, and cultured for an additional 4 hours. Total
RNA was isolated from the PBMC cultures with the
RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN Benelux B.V., Venlo, The
Netherlands). cDNA was synthesized with the RT2 First
Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick MD, USA). Realtime PCR reactions were done with the RT2 SYBR
Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA), and were analysed with a Taqman 7000
system (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). Results were compiled with a program available from SABiosciences.
LTR-constructs and luciferase-assays

The LTR region of the viral genome from the biological
clones was amplified by nested PCR, amplifying nt 2560 of the HXB2 genome [GenBank: K03455]. The
outer primer set is located in the nef gene and in the
U5 region of the LTR. The 5′nested primer contains a

Page 13 of 15

Kpn I site and is located upstream of the U3 region. Primers were specially designed to amplify LTR’s from
clones B1-B4. PCR products were digested with Kpn I
and Hind III (a Hind III site is present at position 531536 in the LTR of HIV (HXB2 numbering) and cloned
into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI).
Because a Kpn I site is already present in the clone B3.1
LTR sequence, a nested primer with an added Mlu I
site was used to construct B3.1 LTR-luciferase constructs. Constructs were verified by sequencing.
Human Embryonic Kidney cells 293 T (HEK-293 T
cells) were used in all luciferase experiments. Cells were
grown at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
with 10% Fetal Calf Serum under 5% CO2 and transfected
using nanofectin (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching,
Austria). Mixtures contained 2 ng of different LTR-luciferase constructs (B1, B2, B3, B4 and B(LAI)), 1 ng of
pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) expressing
Renilla luciferase as an internal control for transfection
efficiency [66], and pBluescript in such a concentration
that the total amount of DNA would always be 200 ng.
To test the activation of the promoters by tat, constructs
were titrated with different concentrations of a tatexpressing plasmid (pTAT). Cells were cultured for two
days and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were
determined with the dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously [66]. The
activity of different constructs was calculated as the ratio
of the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, and
corrected for between-session variation [67].
