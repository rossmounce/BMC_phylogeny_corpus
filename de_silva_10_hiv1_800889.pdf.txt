Abstract
Background: Detailed local HIV-1 sequence data are essential for monitoring the HIV epidemic, for maintaining
sensitive sequence-based diagnostics, and to aid in designing vaccines.
Results: Reported here are full envelope sequences derived from 38 randomly selected HIV-1 infections identified
at a Gambian clinic between 1991 and 2009. Special care was taken to generate sequences from circulating viral
RNA as uncloned products, either by limiting dilution or single genome amplification polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Within these 38 isolates, eight were subtyped as A and 18 as CRF02_AG. A small number of subtype B, C, D
viruses were identified. Surprising, however, was the identification of six isolates with subtype J-like envelopes, a
subtype found normally in Central Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with gag p24 regions
that clustered with subtype A sequences. Near full-length sequence from three of these isolates confirmed that
these represent a novel circulating recombinant form of HIV-1, now named CRF49_cpx.
Conclusions: This study expands the HIV-1 sequence database from the Gambia and will provide important data
for HIV diagnostics, patient care, and vaccine development.

Background
Current data on the HIV epidemic in the Gambia are
lacking. The most recent published data on HIV prevalence in the general population are from a nationwide
perinatal clinic survey in 2000-2001 and indicate a low,
but possibly increasing prevalence of HIV-1 infection in
the country [1]. More recent data from the Medical
Research Council Laboratories Genitourinary medicine
(GUM) clinic indicate that although HIV-2 infection frequency is declining in patients attending the clinic, the
HIV-1 prevalence rose from 4.2% in 1988 to 17.5% in
2003 [2]. Information on the genetic diversity of the
local HIV-1 subtypes and genetic variety is also not
abundant. The Los Alamos HIV Database (LAHDB) [3]
currently lists only 31 sequence entries reporting subtype information from the Gambia, while the surrounding country Senegal has 840 reports, neighboring Mali

has 392, and Guinea Bissau has 290. Detailed sequence
data are required to correctly document the AIDS epidemic, to trace the infection history, monitor changes in
infection patterns and to maintain sensitive and accurate
viral diagnostics. Furthermore, whether future HIV-1
vaccine strategy is based on immunogens optimized for
local strains, or recently described ‘global’ mosaic vaccines that maximize coverage across HIV-1 strains
worldwide [4,5], ongoing documentation of HIV-1
sequence diversity is crucial. The current study was an
attempt to improve the local HIV-1 sequence database.
Reported here are the full envelope gene (env)
sequences derived from 38 HIV-1 infections identified
at a Gambian clinic between 1991 and 2009, as well as
three near full-genome sequences from a novel complex
circulating recombinant form (CRF) identified in the
study. The length of env sequence derived from each
patient (approximately 2500 bp) allowed a robust determination of HIV-1 subtype.

Methods
Patient selection

The viral sequences were obtained from patients attending the Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM) clinic in Fajara,
the Gambia, who had archived plasma samples available.
Patient selection was based on two criteria (see below)
and PCR was attempted on a total of 53 patient samples: the first group of 33 patients were selected at random from all those enrolled in the cohort with a CD4
count of ≥ 28% at diagnosis (these criteria were applied
in order to use the amplified products for a concurrent
study). The second group of five patients were selected
at random from individuals who had recently been diagnosed with advanced HIV infection and started on antiretroviral therapy (ART); these patients therefore had
lower CD4 counts (median CD4% of 13 for the ART
group, 35 for the non-ART group). Additional patient
details are given in Table 1. For this second group of
patients, the last blood sample before initiating ART
was used as the source of virus.
Viral RNA Extraction

Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl of plasma diluted
in 800 μl of RNase free water using the QIAamp Ultrasens Viral RNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) with final elution into 60 μl. Each sample was loaded on a single
column and washed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Amplification of full-length HIV-1 env

Reverse transcription and the first round of a nested
PCR reaction were performed in single reaction. Each
25 μl RT-PCR reaction contained the following mix: 1 ×
PCR buffer Titan One Tube System (Roche Applied
Science), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 400 nM dNTP mix, 0.1 μM of
primers O_envf and O_envr, 0.208 U/μl RNase inhibitor,
1 μl of the Titan One Tube enzyme mix and 5 μl of
extracted RNA. Reverse transcription proceed at 45°C
for 45 min. followed by 95°C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 94°
C (30 sec), 56°C (30 sec), 68°C (3 min), followed by 30
cycles of 94°C (30 sec), 56°C 30 sec), 68°C (3 min) plus
5 sec time extension at 68°C after each round and a
final extension of 7 min at 68°C. The inner (nested)
PCR reactions used 1 μl of the first-round RT-PCR product in 50 μl containing: 1 × Buffer (with 1.5 mM
MgCl2 final concentration), 0.05U/μl Expand HiFi Plus
polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 400 nM dNTP
mix, 0.25 μM of primers MO130 and MO147. Amplification was conducted at 95°C for 3 min followed by 40
cycles of 94°C (15 sec), 56°C (30 sec), 72°C (3 min), and
a final extension of 7 min at 72°C. The PCR products
were resolved on a 1% agarose (Tris-Borate EDTA,
TBE) gel, DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide

2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 nM dNTP mix, 0.5 μM of primers
MO042 or MO024 (alternate outer forward) and MO044,
0.208 U/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of the Titan One Tube
enzyme mix and 10 μl of extracted RNA. Reverse transcription proceed at 50°C for 30 min, followed by 95°C
for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94°C (30 sec), 54°C (30 sec), 72°C

were incubated at 42°C for 90 minutes followed by 85°C
for 5 minutes. Each 50 μl first round PCR contained the
following: 1× Expand Long Template (Roche Applied
Science) buffer 1 (with 1.75 mM MgCl2 final concentration), 400 nM dNTP mix, 0.3 μM of primers MO186 and
MO187, 0.75 μl of the Expand Long Template enzyme
mix and 5 μl of cDNA template. PCR conditions were as
follows: 94°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of 94°C (10 sec), 56°C
(30 sec), 68°C (4 min), followed by 30 cycles of 94°C
(10 sec), 56°C (30 sec), 68°C (4 min) plus 20 sec time
extension at 68°C after each round and a final extension
of 7 min at 68°C. The inner (nested) PCR used 1 μl of the
first round PCR product in 50 μl containing 1 × Expand
Long Template (Roche Applied Science) buffer 1 (with
1.75 mM MgCl2 final concentration), 400 nM dNTP
mix, 0.5 μM of primers MO188 and MO189 and 0.75 μl
of the Expand Long Template enzyme mix. Amplification
was conducted using the same conditions as described
above for the first round PCR.
Limiting dilution PCR and Single Genome Amplification

Amplfication of near full-length HIV-1 genomes

In addition to env and p24 fragments, near full-length
genome sequence was obtained by amplifying three
further fragments: (A) 5’ LTR to gag p24, (B) gag p24 to
env and (C) env to 3’ LTR. For fragment (A), reverse
transcription and the first round of a nested PCR reaction were performed in single reaction. Each 25 μl
RT-PCR reaction contained the following mix: 1 × PCR
buffer Titan One Tube System (Roche Applied Science),
2.5 mM MgCl2, 400 nM dNTP mix, 0.5 μM of primers
MO034 and MO191, 0.208 U/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of
the Titan One Tube enzyme mix and 5 μl of extracted
RNA. Reverse transcription proceed at 50°C for 30 min,
followed by 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94°C (30 sec),
54°C (30 sec), 72°C (1 min) and a final extension of 7 min
at 72°C. The inner (nested) PCR reactions used 1 μl
of the first-round RT-PCR product in 50 μl containing:
1 × Buffer (with 1.5 mM MgCl2 final concentration),
0.05U/μl Expand HiFi Plus polymerase (Roche Applied
Science), 400 nM dNTP mix, 0.5 μM of primers MO024
and MO192. Amplification was conducted at 95°C for
3 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C (30 sec), 56°C
(30 sec), 72°C (1 min), and a final extension of 7 min at
72°C. Fragment (C) was amplfied with a nested PCR on
products obtained with primers O_envf and O_envr as
described above. The inner (nested) PCR reactions and
conditions were identical to those used above for fragment (A), but using primers MO193 and MO194. For
fragment (B), reverse transcription was performed in a
20 μl reaction containing 1× Qiagen LongRange RT buffer, 1 mM mix of each dNTP, 1 μM of primer MO187,
0.04 U/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 μl LongRange Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen) and 10 μl of extracted RNA. Reactions

All env fragments were initially amplified using bulk PCR
conditions on undiluted template and sequencing was
carried out as described below for the highly variable
V1/V2 region, followed by the entire env fragment if no
double peaks were observed. In those samples showing
multiple peaks in the V1/V2 region, the cDNA was then
amplified using two different dilution methods in order
to obtain amplification from single genomes. Both methods involved diluting the cDNA and running a standard
PCR. First, three-fold limiting dilution of a single cDNA
sample (reverse transcribed using the Titan One Tube
RT-PCR reaction mix, for 45 min at 45°C) was carried
out (from 1:3 to 1:243), followed by the standard first
round and nest PCR conditions as described above. The
highest dilution at which the env fragment amplification
was successful was chosen for sequencing. If the V1/V2
region still contained multiple sequences, single genome
amplification was carried out with a modified protocol to
that described in the literature [6]. Briefly, three-fold
dilution of cDNA was carried out with nine replicates per
dilution (starting at the highest dilution at which the single sample limiting dilution PCR was successful), followed by the standard first round and nest PCR
conditions as described above. An amplified env from the
dilution where only one or two replicates yielded a positive PCR reaction (i.e. <30% of replicates positive [6]) was
selected for sequencing and purified using the MinElute
Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN).
Sequencing strategy

The full-length env products were sequenced using a set of
overlapping reactions. The internal nested primers,
MO130 and MO147, were used as the 5’ most and 3’ most

primers for sequencing. An additional six primers were
designed to generate eight contigs covering the full env
sequence (see Table 2 for details). Sequencing primers
were designed to hybridize to conserved regions ca. 600800 bp apart using a collection of 30 West African
sequences from the LAHDB plus the reference HIV-1
HXB2. The p24 PCR products were sequenced using
internal nested primers MO043 and MO045. Additional

fragments required to assemble near full-genome sequence
were sequenced as follows: fragments (A) and (C) were
sequenced with internal nested primers MO024/MO192
and MO193/MO194 respectively. For fragment (B), internal
nested primers, MO188 and MO189 were used as the 5’
most and 3’ most primers, along with 13 additional primers
designed as described above to span the entire region from
gag to env (see Table 2 for details). All primers for PCR and

sequencing were synthesized by Metabion (Metabion International AG, Lena-Christ-Str. 44/I, 82152 Martinsried, Germany, [7]). Sequencing reactions were carried out by
Macrogen [8].
Assembling full-length env, p24 and near full-genome
sequences

For all samples, the sequencing chromatograms were
carefully inspected for sites of ambiguous sequence. All
reliable sequence data were assembled using the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor [9,10] and aligned using the
Cap Contig Assembly program. For each assembled
sequence, the open reading frame (ORF) was established
using alignments with HXB2 env and the ORF finder in
the Sequence Manipulation Suite [11,12]. In areas where
premature stop codons appeared, the sequence chromatograms were re-examined to determine if miscalled
nucleotides in the region could account for the loss of
the open reading frame. Such errors were manually corrected to give full reads of the respective sequence.
All sequences described in this manuscript have been
deposited in GenBank with the following accession
numbers: Envelopes (n = 35): HQ385442 - HQ385476;
CRF49 genomes (n = 3): HQ385477 - HQ385479; 3
extra p24 sequences from presumed CRF49 isolates
(n = 3): HQ385480 - HQ385482.
HIV-1 subtyping and phylogenetic analyses

HIV-1 subtype was assigned to each completed
sequence in the following manner. Env DNA sequences
from each subject, along with the HIV-1 subtype reference set (2005) obtained from the LAHDB, additional
CRF02_AG sequences DJ263 (Djibouti), MP1211 (Senegal), MP1213 (Senegal) (accession numbers AB485634,
AJ251056 and AJ251057 respectively) and additional A3
env sequences from Senegal (DD1579, DDJ360, DDJ362
and DDJ364; accession numbers AY521629, AY521630,
AY521632 and AY521633 respectively) [13,14] were
aligned using CLUSTALW2 [15,16]. All alignments were
inspected and edited manually using Se-Al (Sequence
Alignment editor, v2.0a11, Rambaut, A. Department of
Zoology, University of Oxford, UK), and ambiguous
regions with multiple indels were deleted. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed with the program PAUP* version
4.0b10 [17] using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach
[18]. The trees were reconstructed under the General
Time Reversible model of nucleotide substitution [19],
with proportion of invariable sites and substitution rate
heterogeneity. The statistical robustness of the ML
topologies was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000
replicates using the neighbour-joining method. The software Inkscape [20] was used to color code and label the
trees.

Env fragments from six individuals designated as subtype J-like using the phylogenetic analyses described
above were further aligned with all available subtype J
env sequence of approximately 1200 bp or above in
length in the LAHDB: SE92809 (AF082394), SE9173
(AF082395), MBTB4 (AJ401046), KTB147 (AJ401041),
MBS41 (AJ4010145), VLGCJ1 (AY669766), VLGCJ2
(AY669767), 98BW21.17 (AF192135), GM4 (U33099),
GMB22 (AJ276694) and GMB24 (AJ276695). All
sequences were trimmed to the length of the shortest
sequence, thus an alignment containing 1125 bp fragments were used to build a subtype J env phylogenetic
tree using the methodology described above.
The p24 sequence from these six individuals were also
aligned with HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02_AG reference
isolates from the LAHDB (2005) subtype reference set [3],
additional gag sequence from three CRF02_AG isolates
SE7812 (AF107770), MP1211 (AJ251056), MP1213
(AJ251057), three A3 Senegalese isolates DDJ360
(AY521630), DDI579 (AY521629), DDJ369 (AY521631)
[13,14], additional subtype A1 isolates SE7535 (AF069671),
SE8891 (AF069673), SE8131 (AF107771), SE8538
(AF069669). and the DRC isolates MBTB4 (AJ404293),
KCC2 (AM000053), KTB13 (AM000054) and KTB035
(AM000055). A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with
the methodology described above.
Near full-genome sequences obtained from three of
these isolates were aligned with the 2008 LAHDB subtype reference set and isolates 98 BW21.17 (AF192135),
DDJ360 (AY521630), DDI579 (AY521629) and DDJ369
(AY521631). Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) phylogenies were estimated under the General
Time Reversible model of nucleotide substitution with
gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity, using the program MRBAYES version 3.1.2. [21]. The Bayesian
MCMC search was set to 1,500,000 iterations with trees
sampled every 100 th generations. A maximum clade
credibility tree (MCCT) was selected from the sampled
posterior distribution with the programTreeAnnotator
version 1.5.2 http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/, after discarding
trees corresponding to a 10% burnin. The MCCT Tree
was edited with the program FigTree version 1.1.2.
Characterization of subtype recombination in CRF49_cpx

Simplot and bootscan analyses of near full-genome isolates N18380_GM, N26677_GM and N28353_GM were
performed using Simplot [22]. Pure subtypes A through
K were included (and in a second analysis, isolate
98BW21.17 added) and the alignment was globally gap
stripped. Sliding window was set to 400 bp and increments set to 50 bp. Bootscanning was performed using

de Silva et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:82
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/82

the neighbour-joining method, using the Kimura (twoparameter) distance model and 100 bootstrap replicates
for each sliding window. The transition/traversion ratio
was set to 2.0. For each CRF49_cpx sequence, markers
were placed at breakpoints between subtypes and an
alignment of each fragment used to construct phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood methodology
(and bootstrapping with 1000 replicates using the neighjour-joining method) described above. The HIV
Sequence Locator tool at the LAHDB was used to assign
HXB2 numbering to each fragment and the Recombinant HIV-1 Drawing Tool (also at the LAHDB) utilised
to construct a recombinant map of CRF49_cpx representing a consensus of breakpoints across the three full
genomes.

Results and Discussion
Description of the Cohort

The majority of the subjects was female (n = 28, 74%); a
higher percentage of women attending the GUM clinic
in Gambia has been reported and may be due to
changes in referral policies and sex-specific differences
in health-care seeking behaviour [2]. The median age at
diagnosis was 29.5 years. The ethnic composition of the
cohort was largely similar to the Gambian general population with Mandinka 42% (42% in general population),
Fula 11 (18), Wolof 13 (16), Jola 18 (10), Serahuli 5 (9),
Manjago 8 (not listed) and other groups 3 (4). The
numbers in parentheses are from the 2003 census data
[23]. The number of Jola subjects (18.4%) was noticeably
higher than the general population (10%).
Virus subtyping

The subtype assignment of the 38 env sequences was
obtained by aligning the sequences with LAHDB HIV-1
(2005) subtype reference sequences (which includes
approximately four reference sequences from each relevant subtype), along with an additional three CRF02_AG
and four A3 sequences (two from A3/CRF02_AG
recombinants) as described above and constructing a
maximum likelihood tree. As none of the new Gambian
env sequences clustered with currently known recombinant forms other than CRF02_AG, for clarity Fig. 1 displays reference isolates from pure subtypes and
CRF02_AG only.
Five of the new Gambian sequences (N057856_GM,
N059096_GM, N9845_GM, N75698_GM and
N040736_GM) clustered with the Senegalese A3
(DDJ360, DD1579) and A3/CRF02_AG recombinant
(DDJ364, DDJ362) sequences [13,14] with a bootstrap
support of 81% (see Fig. 1 cluster denoted by ∞).
Given the regional frequency of A3-like viruses, their
occurrence in Gambia is not unexpected. Four isolates
(N59677_GM, N058521_GM, N22314_GM and

Page 6 of 14

N018622_GM) clustered with reference and Gambian
CRF02_AG sequences (bootstrap support 83%),
although it can be difficult to distinguish subtype A
(A1, A2, A3) from CRF02_AG isolates based in env
alone as this region is largely subtype A derived in
CRF02_AG [24]. An additional four isolates did not
form significant clusters (N32458_GM, N47046_GM,
N058628_GM and N006909_GM). Thus these data do
not support the existence of a Gambian-specific AG
sub-subtype. From this analysis, it appears that the
heterogeneity within the global CRF02_AG subgroup is
equally reflected within the Gambian AG viruses. It is
clear that the subtype A env sequences from circulating Gambian strains are distinct from both A1 and A2
reference isolates in the LAHDB, and more closely
related to Senegalese A3 or CRF02_AG isolates.
In addition to the A and AG like isolates, the novel
viruses include a single subtype B (N059733_GM), three
subtype C isolates (N005312_GM, N25667_GM,
N025015_GM) and two subtype D isolates
(N73603_GM, N001823_GM) clustering with high bootstrap values within the reference isolate clusters for
these subtypes (Fig. 1). Of special interest were six isolates (N18380_GM, N001605_GM, N24017_GM,
N28353_GM, N005284_GM and N26677_GM) forming
a monophyletic cluster within the subtype J branch
(bootstrap value of 100%, see Fig. 1 and below).
An additional consideration was raised by the recent
analysis concluding that CRF02_AG is more likely to be a
pure subtype and the precursor to subtype G, which may
in turn be a recombinant derived from subtypes
CRF02_AG and J [25]. This history could account for the
high prevalence of CRF02_AG in West Africa and may
account for local differences (for example between Senegal and Gambia) in the prevalence of subtype G and J
viruses. A more recent analysis has however questioned
these claims and suggested that CRF02_AG did indeed
arise as a result of recombination events that occurred
early in the divergence between subtype A and G [26].
Isolates with subtype J-like env have subtype A gag
regions

Three previous Gambian HIV-1 samples, GM4 (U33099),
GM5 and GM7, were reported to be distinct from the
pure HIV-1 subtypes A to G known at the time [27]
when the J subtype had not yet been defined. GM4 is
described in the LAHDB as a subtype CGJ mosaic,
although phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is subtype
J-like in env [28]. Since that time, two additional Gambian J-like env sequences were reported (GMB22,
GMB24 [28]). GenBank was searched for sequences with
genetic similarity to either the GMB22 or the N28353
sequences and additional subtype J env sequences were
identified: VLGC-J1 (env from a virus identified in

subtypes and additional subtype A sequences (CRF02_AG and Senegalese A3 variants). The full Los Alamos HIV Database (2005) subtype
reference set was initially used to construct the tree, but all CRFs other than CRF02_AG have been omitted here for clarity. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed using a maximum likelihood method [18], under the General Time Reversible model of nucleotide substitution [19], with
proportion of invariable sites and substitution rate heterogeneity. Bootstrap percentiles above 70% from 1000 replications (using the neighborjoining method) are shown at the corresponding branches defining major grouping of sequences. Five of the new Gambian sequences cluster
with the Senegalese A3 variant sequences with a bootstrap support of 81 (∞). Branch lengths represent the number of substitutions per
nucleotide sites.

Germany), VLGC-J2 (of unknown origin) [29], the 98
BW21.17 isolate from Botswana [30] and the MBTB4,
KTB147 and MBS41 isolates from DRC [31]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed as described above with these
isolates, along with the six subtype J-like env samples
from the current study (Fig. 2). All nine subtype J-like
env sequences from the Gambia form a monophyletic
cluster (with a bootstrap support of 92%) and are distinct
from the DRC isolates (Fig. 2).
The Botswana isolate was reported as a novel subtype
A/J recombinant [30], although it has since been reclassified by the LAHDB as an AGJ recombinant, as parts
of the genome are said to be more closely related to
CRF06_AJGK than to any one isolate of subtype A or J
[3]. The GMB22 and GMB24 isolates are also reported
as having subtype A gag regions, although only gag

Page 8 of 14

sequence from GMB22 is available [28]. To test the idea
that a novel recombinant is circulating in the Gambia,
the gag p24 regions from the six novel J-like env isolates
were sequenced and all were found to be subtype A.
Furthermore the gag regions from the Botswana isolate
98BW21.17, GMB22 and five of the new A/J isolates
form a monophyletic cluster with a bootstrap support of
94% (Fig. 3). These gag isolates are distinct from subsubtype A1, A2, A3 sequences, as well as those derived
from CRF02_AG isolates. One new recombinant isolate
(N5284_GM) gag region clustered with A3 [13,14] isolates reported in surrounding Senegal, which may indicate further recombination between the novel
recombinant with circulating local A3 strains. One additional isolate described in the literature, MBTB4 from
DRC, is reported to have a subtype A gag and subtype J

outgroups formed by subtype A1 and CRF02_AG env fragments from the Gambia (N75698A1_GM and N16805_GM). Branch lengths are
expressed as the number of substitutions per nucleotide sites.

J-like env regions. Gambian isolates are in red, which includes an older isolate GMB22. Sequence from the non-Gambian gagA/envJ
recombinants 98BW21.17 and MTBT4 are highlighted in purple. The cluster formed by gag A sequence from isolates with J-like env regions is

reference isolates from the Los Alamos HIV Database (2005) subtype reference set (SE7887 and 95IN21068). Branch lengths represent the number
of substitutions per nucleotide sites. The tree includes the DRC isolates MTBT4, KCC2, KTBT13 and KTB035 which required the sequences to be
trimmed to 623 bp. A similar tree lacking these sequences but reconstructed with a 951 bp length alignment confirmed the clustering (for the
remaining sequences) although with higher bootstrap support.

env region [31]. The subtype A gag phylogenetic tree
was re-built including this isolate, along with three
further DRC subtype A sequences (KCC2, KTB13 and
KTB035), which required use of a shorter fragment
length as described above. The MTBT4 isolate gag
appears to be more closely related to subtype A gag
regions from gag A/env J-like recombinants than other
subtype A sequences (with a bootstrap support of 76%),
including those from DRC (Fig. 3). Of note, the env
region from MTBT4 clusters with the two reference J
envs SE9173 (from an individual known to be infected
in DRC) and SE92809 (bootstrap support of 98), rather
than the other env J isolates with subtype A gag regions
(Fig. 2).

CRF49_cpx, a novel circulating recombinant form

Near full-genome sequences from three of the gag A/env
J-like isolates (N18380_GM, N28353_GM and
N26677_GM) were generated and a phylogenetic tree
constructed as described above (Fig. 4), which provided
confirmation that these viruses represent a novel CRF,
now named CRF49_cpx in the LAHDB. The three isolates clearly form a new cluster, separate from any currently known pure subtypes or recombinants (with a
posterior probability of 1) and appear to be closely
related to the Botswanan isolate 98BW21.17. Analyses
of subtype recombination (as described above) revealed
a complex, but consistent pattern across the three isolates (see Figs. 5, S1 and S2). In addition to the largely

subtype A gag region and J-like env, a significant subtype C fragment is present in a portion of pol, extending
through vif to vpr (which is absent in 98BW21.17),
where a breakpoint with the subtype J-like fragment is
found. The pol gene is mosaic and contains regions with
similarity to subtypes A, J, K and C, as well a fragment
which is not clearly defined by currently known pure
subtype sequences. A phylogenetic tree constructed with
this pol fragment (not resolved through Simplot bootscanning analysis), suggested that this region was subtype F-like (Fig. 5). Simplot and bootscan analysis [22]
clearly showed a similar pattern of subtype recombination across the three isolates, although there was variation in where the exact breakpoints are (Supplementary
Fig. S1 and S2), especially in the highly mosaic pol gene.
The diversity between the three CRF49_cpx sequences
may suggest that they are derived from a virus that
recombined decades ago and as a great deal of evolution
may have occurred since that time, many of the

recombination breakpoints cannot be clearly defined.
The Simplot and bootscan analysis [22] was repeated for
each sequence, with inclusion of the Botswanan isolate
98BW21.17 in the reference set. This suggested that
apart from the subtype C-like fragment, the CRF49_cpx
sequences are more similar to 98BW21.17 than to most
pure reference subtypes representing each recombinant
fragment (Supplementary Fig. S3). It is possible, therefore, that CRF49_cpx originated via further recombination between a 98BW21.17-like strain and a subtype C
isolate.
A careful examination of patient records was performed to determine social factors that might be associated with the CRF49_cpx viruses. There was no
evidence that any of these subjects were related and
there was no exclusive association with an ethnic group
in this set of subjects (two Mandinka, two Manjago, one
Jola and one Serahuli - see Table 1). None of these subjects were reported commercial sex workers (CSWs),

patients.
HIV-1 subtype distribution relative to Senegal

The most recent survey from Senegal show a high prevalence of subtype C (40%), followed by CRF 02_AG
(24.3%), then subtype B (18.6%) in a Senegalese cohort
of men who have sex with men [32]. This distribution
was different from female sex workers (FSWs) and from
the general population where CRF02_AG was reported
to predominate [33]. In the Senegalese FSW cohort,
despite large sample numbers (328), only 2 subtype J
isolates (in env) were reported. Because a small (385 bp)
C2-V3 env fragment was used for subtyping [32,33],
there is a concern that this might have missed detecting
subtypes Js. However when the Gambian 38 samples
plus the Los Alamos reference set are trimmed to the
385 bp C2-V3 region used in the Senegalese study, the

six new Gambian subtype J-like env sequences still cluster with the reference J sequences with high bootstrap
values (results not shown). If J subtypes or CRF49_cpx
isolates were present in the Senegalese cohort, they
would have been detected by the 385 bp C2-V3 analysis,
therefore the high frequency of CRF49_cpx isolates
observed in the Gambia may not extend to neighboring
Senegal.
The geographical and subtype information in the
LAHDB are gathered from investigator-supplied information. Different levels of rigor can be used to define
HIV-1 subtype (e.g. the REGA HIV subtyping algorithm
[34] requires a minimum of 800 bp of sequence whereas
many of the LAHDB subtype designations are provided
for sequences of less than 300 bp). Furthermore, of subtype designations, there can be multiple listings for the
same patient and this may result in over-reporting of
some subtypes. For example, for CRF02_AG, when the
840 Senegalese entries in LAHDB with reported subtype

de Silva et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:82
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/82

are screened for entries 800 bp or larger and the known
multiple patient entries are removed, a set of 183
sequence entries remain. These 183 sequences were analysed phylogenetically, using maximum likelihood methods as described above, to generate a more stringent
subtype distribution (Fig. 6, left pie). Similar criteria
were applied to the 38 novel Gambian sequences from
this study plus the four Gambian LAHDB entries >800
bp (Fig. 6, right pie). In this analysis, there are large differences in the frequency of the HIV-1 subtypes
between the two countries (Fig 6). This could be due to
cultural differences, or to differences in the age and
extent of the epidemic in each country. In addition, the
Senegalese data are dominated by sequences derived
from specific cohorts (MSM, CSW) while the Gambia
data (mostly derived from the current study) come from
random selection of patients attending a GUM clinic;
such differences in the patient composition could results
in the large differences in the subtype distribution.

Conclusions
Information on the diversity of HIV-1 in the Gambia is
currently lacking and the current study has attempted to
address this gap by generating full-length HIV-1 env
sequences from 38 local HIV-1 isolates. Documentation
of the ongoing HIV-1 epidemic and sequence data from
West Africa is important for several reasons. In a region
where HIV-1 diversity is higher than in many other
parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such information is
required to maintain accurate viral diagnostics and

Page 12 of 14

sensitive viral load assays. HIV-1 subtypes may differ
biologically in areas such as viral fitness [35,36] and
co-receptor usage (e.g. likelihood of switch from R5 to
X4 usage) [37,38]. These may in turn translate into
higher risk of disease progression in certain subtypes
and recombinant viruses could also have certain advantages over their parent strains. Studies in East Africa,
using both prevalent and incident infections, have
shown a higher risk of progression to AIDS and AIDSrelated death in subtype D (and inter-subtype recombinant) -infected individuals when compared to subtype
A-infected patients [39,40]; even following adjustment
for baseline viral load [41]. A Senegalese study supports
the notion that non-A subtype infections progress faster
than subtype A infections [42], although outcomes in
CRF02_AG infected individuals appear to be no worse
compared to non-AG infections [43]; despite the rise of
this circulating recombinant form (CRF) in West Africa
and in vitro data suggesting enhanced viral fitness [35].
With the increasing availability of anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) in West Africa, it is also important to consider
potential differences between HIV-1 subtypes in drug
resistance pathways and the ease with which resistance
appears due to naturally occurring polymorphisms (e.g.
the development of K65R in subtype C infections)
[44,45]. Such findings would clearly have implications
for local ART regimes and choice of 2 nd line drugs.
Finally, local sequence data are important in the design
of potential immunogens for future prophylactic and
therapeutic HIV-1 vaccines, although the greater

Figure 6 HIV-1 subtype distribution in Senegal compared to Gambia. The left chart shows the distribution in the 183 LAHDB sequences
from Senegal >800 bp. The right chart shows the distribution in all LAHDB subtyped HIV-1 sequences from Gambia >800 bp (4 entries) plus the
38 sequences from the current work (42 entries total). Note that the CRF49_cpx viruses identified in this study were included in the J category.
The frequency of selected subtypes with 95% confidence intervals (calculated using the modified Wald method) were Gambia J 21% (11.235.4%), Gambia CRF 02_AG 49% (34.6-63.3%); Senegal J 0.6% (< 0.01 to 3.3%), Senegal CRF 02_AG 31% (24-38%).

diversity in West Africa makes this daunting task even
more challenging in this subregion. Mosaic vaccine strategies [4,5] may overcome this barrier and documentation of new CRFs and accurate representation of global
sequence diversity is essential for these strategies.
While the majority prevalence of subtype A and
CRF02_AG in the new set of HIV-1 isolates is consistent
with data from other West African countries, the identification of 6 isolates of a novel recombinant, CRF49_cpx, in
the 38 isolates was surprising and unique to the Gambia.
These six infected individuals were epidemiologically
unlinked and env sequence from these viruses cluster with
three previously described Gambian subtype J-like env
sequences. Thus, all nine isolates are likely to represent
the novel HIV-1 CRF49_cpx. Full genome sequence from
the Botswanan isolate (98BW21.17) [30] is closely linked
to the Gambian isolates in phylogenetic analyses (more so
than to any other virus currently in the LAHDB). Due to
the limited number of patients examined, it is difficult to
predict the importance of CRF49_cpx in the Gambian
HIV-1 epidemic. Although some criteria were imposed in
sample selection, within both patient groups (CD4 >/=
28% at first presentation and recently diagnosed and commenced antiretroviral therapy) selection was randomized.
There is good reason to believe therefore, that CRF49_cpx
may represent a reasonable proportion of the HIV-1 infections in the Gambia. Further studies are important to clarify its prevalence (including changes over time), the
contribution to new infections in recent years and the disease potential relative to other local subtypes.
