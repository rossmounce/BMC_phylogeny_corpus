Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the
radiation of the land snail genus Xerocrassa on
Crete based on mitochondrial sequences and
AFLP markers
Jan Sauer1,2, Bernhard Hausdorf1*

Abstract
Background: A non-adaptive radiation triggered by sexual selection resulted in ten endemic land snail species of
the genus Xerocrassa on Crete. Only five of these species and a more widespread species are monophyletic in a
mitochondrial gene tree. The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of such closely related species can be
complicated by incomplete lineage sorting, introgression or inadequate taxonomy. To distinguish between the
reasons for the nonmonophyly of several species in the mitochondrial gene tree we analysed nuclear AFLP
markers.
Results: Whereas six of the eleven morphologically delimited Xerocrassa species from Crete are monophyletic in
the mitochondrial gene tree, nine of these species are monophyletic in the tree based on AFLP markers. Only two
morphologically delimited species could not be distinguished with the multilocus data and might have diverged
very recently or might represent extreme forms of a single species. The nonmonophyly of X. rhithymna with
respect to X. kydonia is probably the result of incomplete lineage sorting, because there is no evidence for
admixture in the AFLP data and the mitochondrial haplotype groups of these species coalesce deeply. The same is
true for the main haplotype groups of X. mesostena. The nonmonophyly of X. franciscoi might be the result of
mitochondrial introgression, because the coalescences of the haplotypes of this species with some X. mesostena
haplotypes are shallow and there is admixture with neighbouring X. mesostena.
Conclusion: The most likely causes for the nonmonophyly of species in the mitochondrial gene tree of the
Xerocrassa radiation on Crete could be inferred using AFLP data by a combination of several criteria, namely the
depth of the coalescences in the gene tree, the geographical distribution of shared genetic markers, and
concordance with results of admixture analyses of nuclear multilocus markers. The strongly subdivided population
structure increases the effective population size of land snail species and, thus, the likelihood of a long persistence
of ancestral polymorphisms. Our study suggests that ancestral polymorphisms are a frequent cause for
nonmonophyly of species with a strongly subdivided population structure in gene trees.

Background
The delimitation of closely related species and the
reconstruction of their evolutionary history can be complicated by shared ancestral polymorphisms, introgression or inadequate taxonomy [1]. These problems may
result in discrepancies between gene trees and a species

classification based on other data, which may became
apparent if the markers are sequenced from several individuals of each species. The probability that ancestral
polymorphisms are shared between species increases
with decreased time between speciation events [2-6].
The likelihood that isolation mechanisms are incomplete
and introgression happens is also higher if species originated in a short time span and, hence, were at least
initially genetically similar [1,7,8]. Inadequate taxonomy,

a species classification, is more likely, if several species
originated in a short period of time and are morphologically similar. Thus, the delimitation of species and the
reconstruction of their relationships are especially challenging in species radiations [9]. Species that are nonmonophyletic in gene trees have been found in diverse
groups, e.g., in radiations of East African cichlids
[10-12], Darwin’s finches [13], Moorean tree snails [14],
Hawaiian swordtail crickets [15], North American lycaenid butterflies [16], ambystomatid salamanders [17],
Argentinean liolaemid lizards [18], North American crotaphytid lizards [19], and barley [20].
We investigated the radiation of the land snail genus
Xerocrassa (Gastropoda: Helicoidea: Hygromiidae) on
Crete. Eleven native Xerocrassa species can be distinguished on Crete based on morphological characters of
the shell and the genitalia [21]. All native species living
on Crete are endemic (Figure 1) except the more widespread Xerocrassa cretica. It has been supposed that the
radiation of Xerocrassa on Crete was a non-adaptive
radiation probably triggered by sexual selection [22].
Only six of the morphologically defined species are
monophyletic in a mitochondrial gene tree [22]. We
checked the morphological species delimitation using a
tree and a network based on AFLP markers [23] and
tested the efficiency of several approaches for delimiting
genotypic clusters based on multilocus data without a
prior knowledge of the number of species. We used an
integrative approach combining several criteria to

discriminate between incomplete lineage sorting and
introgression as causes for the nonmonophyly of species
in the mitochondrial gene tree of the Xerocrassa radiation on Crete.

Results
Mitochondrial gene tree

Separate models for the three codon positions as determined by ModelTest based on the AIC were used for
the maximum likelihood analysis (1. codon positions:
TrN+I+G, 2. codon positions TrN+I, 3. codon positions
TVM+G), because the resulting tree had a lower AIC
value (-lnL = 9246.20; AIC = 18986.39) than the tree
based on a uniform model for the complete dataset
(TVM+I+G; -lnL = 9638.11; AIC = 19766.21). The maximum likelihood tree of 122 partial COI sequences (634
bps) of Cretan Xerocrassa species and two Trochoidea
species as outgroups is shown in Figure 2A (see also
[21]). COI GTR+G distances varied from 0.8% to 33.0%
(mean 18.7%) between Cretan Xerocrassa species and
from 0.0% to 25.0% (mean 13.6%) within Cretan Xerocrassa species.
According to chi-square tests the base composition
at the first and second codon positions of the used
COI sequences are not heterogeneous (p = 1.000), but
there is significant heterogeneity at the third codon
positions (p = 0.016). The results of the matched-pairs
tests of symmetry are compatible with these results.
According to the matched-pairs tests of symmetry

37.5% of the pairwise comparisons of the nucleotides
at the third codon positions indicate significant (p <
0.050) heterogeneity, whereas only 4.0% of the pairwise
comparisons of the nucleotides at the first codon positions and 0.0% of the pairwise comparisons of the
nucleotides at the second codon positions indicate significant heterogeneity.
To reduce the compositional heterogeneity at the
third codon positions we recoded the nucleotides at the
third codon positions as purines and pyrimidines. This
RY-recoding resulted in a loss of information so that the
resulting tree was poorly supported. The haplotype
group of X. mesostena that is sister to all other haplotypes of endemic species except X. subvariegata and
X. grabusana (Figure 2) became nested in X. siderensis
haplotypes from eastern Crete. This haplotype group of
X. mesostena is distributed in a region southwest of the

Psiloritis Mountains and will be called the ‘Psiloritis
haplotype group’ in the following.
The analysis with the nonstationary model implemented in nhPhyML-Discrete requires a starting tree. We
used the maximum likelihood tree obtained with the
unmodified dataset as well as the maximum likelihood
tree obtained with the RY-recoding of the third codon
positions as starting trees. The Psiloritis haplotype
group of X. mesostena has the same basal position as in
the maximum likelihood tree obtained with the unmodified dataset and the stationary model (Figure 2A) in
both resulting trees. According to the approximately
unbiased test, the tree obtained using the maximum
likelihood tree calculated based on the unmodified dataset as starting tree (Figure 2B) was significantly (p <
0.001) better than the tree obtained using the other
starting tree.

Both reconstructions of the mitochondrial gene tree
(Figure 2) show that the haplotypes of the morphologically delimited species X. cretica, X. subvariegata,
X. grabusana, X. lasithiensis, X. heraklea and X. kydonia
form monophyletic groups, but the haplotypes of the
other five morphologically delimited species do not. The
haplotypes of the widespread X. mesostena are paraphyletic with respect to all other endemic Xerocrassa species with the exception of X. subvariegata and
X. grabusana and form two deeply separated main
groups. Whereas the majority of the X. mesostena individuals have haplotypes that form a terminal bush-like
group, most individuals living in a region southwest of
the Psiloritis Mountains have mitochondrial haplotypes
that form a strongly supported early branch in the mitochondrial gene tree, the ‘Psiloritis haplotype group’. The
haplotypes of X. rhithymna are paraphyletic with respect
to X. kydonia. The haplotypes of X. franciscoi are nested
in the major X. mesostena group. In the tree calculated
with the stationary model (Figure 2A) most haplotypes
of X. amphiconus form a clade that is nested in some
haplotypes of X. siderensis, which together form the sister
group of the X. heraklea/rhithymna/kydonia clade. The
second group of X. siderensis haplotypes forms the sister
clade of the major X. mesostena group. In contrast, the
two haplotype clades of X. amphiconus and X. siderensis
form a single clade, which is the sister group of the
X. heraklea/rhithymna/kydonia clade, in the tree calculated with the nonstationary model (Figure 2B). In both
reconstructions, one haplotype of X. amphiconus is
nested in the major X. mesostena group.

Tree and network based on AFLP data

Using six primer combinations, we scored 1476 fragments of 70-322 bases length in 151 Xerocrassa specimens. The AFLP data can be found in Additional File 1.
A neighbor-joining tree based on Jaccard distances
between AFLP data of Cretan Xerocrassa is shown in
Figure 3 and a neighbor-net is shown in Figure 4. Nine
of the eleven morphologically defined species are monophyletic in the AFLP tree. This is also true for
X. rhithymna, X. franciscoi and X. mesostena, which are
nonmonophyletic in the mitochondrial gene tree. The
discordances between the mitochondrial gene tree and
the tree based on the AFLP data with regard to the
monophyly of these species and the relationships
between the species are not the result of a poor resolution of the mitochondrial gene tree according to an
approximately unbiased test (p < 0.001). Of the morphologically defined species, only X. amphiconus and
X. siderensis are polyphyletic in the mitochondrial gene
tree as well as in the neighbor-joining tree and the
neighbor-net based on the AFLP data. However,
X. amphiconus and X. siderensis together form a

this group is divided into distinct subgroups by deep
splits. These subgroups are geographically more or less
separated and might be considered cryptic species.
However, they are neither congruent with mitochondrial
haplotype groups nor are they correlated with morphological differences. For example, one of the AFLP based
subgroups is restricted to the region southwest of the
Psiloritis Mountains where also the Psiloritis haplotype
group occurs. Most of the X. mesostena individuals that
are characterized by Psiloritis haplotypes are concentrated in the geographically corresponding AFLP cluster
(Figs. 3 and 4). However, there are also individuals with
other haplotypes in this AFLP cluster and some individuals with Psiloritis haplotypes belong to other AFLP
clusters. This demonstrates that there is gene flow
between the metapopulations corresponding to the
AFLP clusters.

Species delimitation based on Gaussian clustering of
AFLP data

Gaussian clustering of the AFLP data resulted in a classification of the 151 Xerocrassa specimens into eleven
clusters if no noise component was used. These clusters
are shown in the first two dimensions of a four-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling of Jaccard
distances (stress 12.813%; Figure 5). This partitioning
differs from the morphological classification in combining the three morphologically differentiated species pairs
X. subvariegata and X. grabusana, X. kydonia and
X. rhithymna, and X. amphiconus and X. siderensis each
and in splitting the widespread species X. mesostena
into three groups and X. cretica into two clusters. If
Gaussian clustering with a noise component was used to
indicate outliers, 21 specimens were included into the
noise component and seven clusters were recognized.

Species delimitation based on STRUCTURE analyses

There was no distinct maximum of the mean estimates of
the posterior probabilities of the data calculated with
STRUCTURE for a given cluster number K for K
between 1 and 20, if the model without admixture (Figure 6A) was used. The statistic ΔK proposed by Evanno
et al. [24] to estimate the number of clusters K showed a
maximum at K = 2 (Figure 6B). However, ΔK for K = 1
can not be calculated. Thus, neither the mean estimates
of the posterior probabilities of the data for a given cluster number K nor the ΔK values gave a clear indication
how many Xerocrassa species can be distinguished on
Crete.
The mean estimates of the posterior probabilities of the
data had a maximum at K = 9, if the model with admixture (Figure 6C) was used. However, the highest likelihood has been obtained in a run with K = 13. ΔK showed
again a maximum at K = 2 (Figure 6D). In the run with K
= 9 that had the highest likelihood the clusters correspond to X. cretica, X. subvariegata + X. grabusana,
X. kydonia + X. rhithymna + X. heraklea + X. lasithiensis,

An admixture analysis with the AFLP data of
X. rhithymna and X. kydonia with K = 2 revealed that all
X. rhithymna individuals including the specimen with the
haplotype that is sister to the X. kydonia haplotypes had
an inferred ancestry of 99.5-99.8% in their own cluster.
That means that there is no evidence for introgression of
X. kydonia alleles into X. rhithymna individuals. The
inferred ancestry of five X. kydonia individuals was also
between 99.3-99.7% in their own cluster, but one individual had an inferred ancestry of only 86.5% in its own
cluster and 13.5% in the X. rhithymna cluster.
An admixture analyses with the AFLP data of X. franciscoi individuals and the geographically neighbouring
ten individuals of X. mesostena with K = 2 showed that
the X. franciscoi individuals had an inferred ancestry of
93.6-99.9% in their own cluster. Nine of the ten X. mesostena individuals had an inferred ancestry of 99.6-99.9% in
the X. mesostena cluster, but the one from Ano Kapetaniana 3.5 km towards Agios Ioannis, only a few hundred
meters from the boundary of the distribution area of X.
franciscoi, had an inferred ancestry of only 86.1% in the
X. mesostena cluster and 13.9% in the X. franciscoi cluster. This indicates that there might be some introgression
between X. mesostena and X. franciscoi.

Discussion
Species delimitation in a radiation

There are strong discrepancies between the mitochondrial gene tree of the radiation of the land snail genus
Xerocrassa on Crete based on COI sequences (Figure 2)
and the species classification based on morphological
characters of the shell and the genitalia [21]. In the
mitochondrial gene tree only six of the eleven morphologically defined Xerocrassa species living on Crete are
monophyletic. A topology test showed that the lack of
monophyly of the morphologically delimited species is
not the result of a poor resolution of the mitochondrial
gene tree [22]. We could also exclude the possibility
that the lack of monophyly of the morphologically
delimited species in the mitochondrial gene tree is an
artefact resulting from systematic errors in tree reconstruction due to compositional bias by using a

nonstationary model for the maximum likelihood analyses (Figure 2B).
We generated a multilocus dataset using AFLP markers to investigate whether the discrepancies between
the morphologically based species classification and the
mitochondrial gene tree are artefacts resulting from
inadequate taxonomy or whether they can be explained
by evolutionary processes. Nine of the eleven morphologically delimited Cretan Xerocrassa species form separate groups in the tree (Figure 3) and the neighbor-net
(Figure 4) based on 1476 AFLP markers. Thus, the
AFLP data corroborate the morphological species classification with the exception of the separation of
X. amphiconus and X. siderensis, which together form a
separate clade, but are intermingled within this clade.
This species pair is also exceptional with regard to morphology and distribution. Whereas most other Xerocrassa species can be distinguished by characters of the
genitalia, the genitalia of X. amphiconus and X. siderensis show no differences. These two species differ only in
shell characters. Whereas the other endemic species

have largely allopatric distribution areas, the ranges of
X. amphiconus and X. siderensis broadly overlap. Nevertheless, they usually do not occur together. They tend to
prefer different altitudinal zones [21], though there are
several populations of each species occurring in the
zone preferred by the other species. Only few individuals
show intermediate shell characters indicating possible
hybridization. The lack of clear genetic differentiation of
the two species might indicate that the species diverged
only very recently. At present, we cannot rule out the
possibility that the two forms actually represent only
extreme morphs of a single species.
We also applied three methods for delimiting provisional species based on dominant multilocus markers
without any a priori knowledge. We compared the performance of Gaussian clustering [25,26] with two Bayesian
approaches that are based on the assumption of approximate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within clusters, namely
STRUCTURE [27,28] and STRUCTURAMA [29], in delimiting species of the Cretan Xerocrassa radiation.

The classification of the Cretan Xerocrassa specimens
produced using Gaussian clustering based on the AFLP
data is most similar to the morphological classification,
but differs from it in combining three morphologically
differentiated species pairs and in splitting the two most
widespread species into two, respectively three groups.
The major disadvantage of STRUCTURE was its inability to determine the number of species that can be distinguished. Compared to STRUCTURE, the advantage
of STRUCTURAMA is that it directly estimates the
number of clusters into which a sample can be divided.
However, compared with Gaussian clustering the classification success of STRUCTURAMA was much lower.
Only three provisional species were delimited. Thus, this
approach failed to distinguish eight taxa that can be distinguished morphologically and form separate groups in
the tree (Figure 3) and the neighbor-net (Figure 4)
based on the AFLP data.
The problems in determining the appropriate number
of clusters with STRUCTURE and the low resolution
obtained with STRUCTURAMA confirmed former studies suggesting that with many dominant markers strategies coupling ordination and cluster analyses like
Gaussian clustering become more efficient in species
delimitation than Bayesian approaches that are based on
the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within
clusters [26,30]. However, none of the methods used
recognized all species that can be distinguished by morphological characters and that form separate groups in
the tree (Figure 3) and the neighbor-net (Figure 4)
based on the AFLP data. This failure is probably the
result of the low number of specimens sampled of the
regionally more restricted species. With few sampled
individuals separate clusters cannot be recognized and
specimens of the underrepresented species are included
in clusters of the most similar species, if no noise component is used in the analysis. The introduction of a
noise component to include outliers in Gaussian clustering is meaningful, because it indicates problems in the
data, in this case insufficient sampling of the regionally
restricted species, that might remain unrecognized
otherwise.
The problem in recognizing underrepresented species
has important consequences for DNA-based biodiversity
surveys. Because there are usually many rare species and
just a few common species [31], many rare species will
remain undiscovered, if all species are sampled randomly. Therefore, investing in a morphological prescreening to raise the representation of rare species in
DNA-based surveys might increase the effectiveness of
such surveys considerably.
The genotypic clusters determined with Gaussian clustering and the two Bayesian approaches correspond to
species in some cases (e.g., X. heraklea and X. lasithiensis

Page 8 of 13

in the solution found with Gaussian clustering or X. cretica in the solution found with STRUCTURAMA), but
they may also correspond to other groups like geographically isolated meta-populations (e.g., geographical subgroups of X. mesostena in the solution found with
Gaussian clustering) or groups of species (e.g., X. kydonia
+ X. rhithymna in the solution found with Gaussian clustering or X. subvariegata + X. grabusana in the solution
found with STRUCTURAMA). Thus, the determination
of the status of such groups should be corroborated by a
comparison with a classification based on other evidence.
We compare the partitions obtained with the multilocus
markers with the morphological classification that is
mainly based on differences in the genitalia that may
directly be involved in reproductive isolation.
Causes of the nonmonophyly of species in the
mitochondrial gene tree

The nonmonophyly of X. mesostena, X. franciscoi and
X. rhithymna in the mitochondrial gene tree (Figure 2)
are not likely explained by inadequate taxonomy, because
they form separate groups in the tree (Figure 3) and the
neighbor-net (Figure 4) based on AFLP markers. We analyzed the potential mechanisms resulting in the nonmonophyly of these species in the mitochondrial gene tree
by applying several criteria that have been proposed to
discriminate between incomplete lineage sorting and
introgression. These criteria are the depth of the coalescences in the mitochondrial tree [1,18-20,32,33], the geographical occurrence of the individuals of species that are
nonmonophyletic in the gene tree [1,16,18-20,34], and
concordance with results of admixture analyses of
nuclear multilocus markers [16,35].
The most remarkable pattern is seen in X. mesostena,
the most widespread of the endemic species. Whereas
individuals living in a region southwest of the Psiloritis
Mountains have mitochondrial haplotypes that form a
strongly supported early branch in the COI gene tree
(Figure 2), the individuals from other regions of the
island have haplotypes that form a terminal bush-like
group. In the tree (Figure 3) and the neighbor-net (Figure 4) based on AFLP markers individuals with Psiloritis
haplotypes are intermingled with individuals with other
haplotypes indicating that there is gene flow between
populations with different mitochondrial haplotype
groups. There is no indication that one of the two haplotype groups found in X. mesostena was introduced
into that species by introgression, because these haplotype groups were not found in other species, with the
exception of X. franciscoi and one X. amphiconus specimen that have haplotypes that are nested in the major
X. mesostena haplotype group. Thus, the Psiloritis
haplotype group represents probably an ancestral
polymorphism that was conserved in X. mesostena.

It can be considered a paradigm for one of the causes of
the high mitochondrial sequence diversity within land
snail species discussed by Thomaz et al. [36], namely
long-term persistence of ancient polymorphisms resulting from the strongly subdivided population structure of
land snails. The population structure of land snail species often consisting of many more or less isolated
populations [37-40] that sometimes can reach high densities in favourable patches of habitat in conducive to
the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms, because
such a population structure increases the effective population size [41]. A more detailed analysis of the phylogeographic structure within X. mesostena is in
preparation.
The second case of nonmonophyly in the mitochondrial gene tree (Figure 2) concerns X. rhithymna. In the
COI gene tree X. rhithymna is paraphyletic with respect
to X. kydonia. The two species are sister species according to the AFLP tree. The ranges of the two species are
separated by more than 40 km [21]. Thus, dispersal of
X. rhithymna individuals to the range of X. kydonia and
hybridization between the two species are rare events at
most. This is also confirmed by an admixture analysis of
the AFLP data that did not provide evidence for admixture, neither for the X. rhithymna individual with the
haplotype that is sister to the X. kydonia haplotypes nor
for any other X. rhithymna individual. A small amount
of admixture in one X. kydonia individual is not necessarily the result of introgression, but might be due to
shared ancestral polymorphisms. Thus, it is more likely
that the nonmonophyly of X. rhithymna in the mitochondrial gene tree is the result of incomplete lineage sorting
and not caused by an introgression of a X. kydonia haplotype into X. rhithymna. This is further supported by the
deep coalescence of the X. rhithymna haplotype which is
more closely related to the X. kydonia haplotypes than to
the other X. rhithymna haplotypes.
The last species that is monophyletic in the AFLP tree
(Figure 3), but not in the mitochondrial gene tree (Figure 2), is X. franciscoi. The small range of this endemic
species adjoins directly on the range of X. mesostena. Its
COI haplotypes are nested within the main COI haplotype group of X. mesostena and are separated from
X. mesostena haplotypes only by shallow distances. This
might indicate introgression. Actually, the STRUCTURE
analysis of the AFLP data shows admixture between
X. franciscoi and a representative of the neighbouring
X. mesostena population in agreement with the observation of a narrow hybrid zone between the two species [21].
However, the nonmonophyly of the mitochondrial haplotypes of X. franciscoi, the shallow distances between them
and X. mesostena haplotypes and the admixture of X. franciscoi and neighbouring X. mesostena can also be explained
by a recent origin of X. franciscoi from X. mesostena by

Page 9 of 13

peripatric speciation. It is difficult to determine the relative
roles of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization in
generating nonmonophyly of recently separated species in
gene trees.
The mitochondrial gene tree hints to the phylogenetic
origin of X. franciscoi from neighbouring populations of
the X. mesostena complex, whereas the AFLP tree
reflects the genetic cohesion of the individuals of each
of the species caused by intraspecific gene flow and
recombination that, on the other hand, obscured the
details of the relations between the species. Thus, both
marker types supply complementary information with
regard to the phylogenetic history of the Xerocrassa
radiation on Crete, similar to the situation concerning
the radiation of the cichlid genus Tropheus in Lake Tanganyika [12].
The discrimination of incomplete lineage sorting of
ancestral polymorphisms and introgression as causes of
nonmonophyly of species in gene trees is difficult
[1,16,18-20,32-35]. Our study showed that the most
likely cause of nonmonophyly can be inferred at least in
some cases by a combination of several criteria, namely
the depth of the coalescences in the gene tree, the geographical distribution of shared genetic markers, and
concordance with results of admixture analyses of
nuclear multilocus markers. However, all these criteria
have limitations. Randomly distributed genetic markers
shared with allopatric species with limited dispersal abilities might indicate incomplete lineage sorting. However,
the expectation that genetic markers that are concentrated geographically near species boundaries indicate
introgression (e.g., [1,19]) is not necessarily true, because
such a pattern might also be derived from a pre-existing
cline in the stem species. Likewise, introgression of
mitochondrial DNA cannot be completely excluded,
even if there is no evidence for admixture of multilocus
markers, because maternally inherited DNA like mitochondrial DNA may introgress much more rapidly
through prezygotic barriers than biparentally inherited
DNA [7,8]. Such shortcomings of individual criteria are
ameliorated by using several criteria in an integrative
approach. Gene trees of several additional genes would
provide more definitive evidence for discriminating
between incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization.

Conclusion
Most cases of nonmonophyly of species in the mitochondrial gene tree of the Xerocrassa radiation on Crete
are not caused by inappropriate morphological taxonomy, but are the result of evolutionary processes. By
using nuclear multilocus data and a combination of several criteria, namely the depth of the coalescences in the
gene tree, the geographical distribution of shared genetic
markers, and concordance with results of admixture

Sauer and Hausdorf BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/299

analyses of nuclear multilocus markers we could infer
that some of these cases are probably the result of
incomplete lineage sorting, whereas introgression might
have been involved in other cases. Although most
species are monophyletic in a tree based on the AFLP
data, methods for delimiting genotypic clusters based on
multilocus data alone did not recognize all these species.
This is at least partly the result of an unequal representation of the species in the dataset and highlights the
importance of a morphological prescreening to raise the
representation of rare species in DNA-based biodiversity
surveys.

Methods
Sampling

Snails were sampled on Crete in July/August and September/October 2004 and September/October 2005.
AFLP data were determined from 150 Xerocrassa specimens from 124 localities on Crete covering all morphotypes and all regions of Crete (Figure 1) and one
Xerocrassa cretica from Samos. The classification,
AFLPdata, locality and voucher data for the Xerocrassa
specimens used in this study can be found in Additional
File 1.
DNA extraction

Total genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples
of the foot preserved in 100% isopropanol following the
protocol proposed by Sokolov [42] with slight modifications as detailed in Sauer & Hausdorf [22].
Mitochondrial sequences

Fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
gene have been previously sequenced (Sauer & Hausdorf
2009). The sequences analyzed in this paper have been
deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers
FJ627054-FJ627177. The used alignment is available at
TreeBASE http://www.treebase.org, accession number
S2413.
AFLP

Approximately 100 ng genomic DNA were digested with
5 units EcoRI (Fermentas) at 37°C for 1 h followed by a
digestion with 5 units of MseI (Fermentas) at 65°C for 1
h. 12.5 pmol of the EcoRI-adapter, 125 pmol of the MseIadapter and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase and its buffer
(GeneCraft) were added to the digestion product and
incubated at 16°C for 8 h. The ligation products were
diluted 1:10 with sterile ddH2O, and stored at -20°C.
Preselective PCR was carried out with one selective
base on each primer (PA-MseI-C and PA-EcoRI-A,
Table 1). 5 μl of the diluted ligation product were added
to 20 μl of the preselective PCR mastermix, consisting
of 15.1 μl ddH2O, 2.5 μl 10× PCR-buffer, 1.75 μl MgCl2

(50 mM), 0.25 μl dNTP (each 2 mM), 0.15 μl preselective primer mix (50 μM each), and 0.25 μl Taq-DNA
polymerase (5U/μl). Preselective PCR conditions were
22 cycles of PCR (94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for
60 s), and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The
quality of the preselective PCR was checked on a 1.5%
agarose gel. Afterwards the products were diluted 1:20
with sterile H2O.
Five primers with two additional bases at the 3’ end
(Table 1) were used for selective amplifications. Six primer
combinations (SMseI/SEcoRIDYE) were run: AG/CAFAM,
AG/CCNED, AG/GGHEX, TG/CAFAM, TG/CCNED and TG/
GGHEX. 5 μl of the diluted preselective PCR product were
added to 20 μl of the selective PCR master mix consisting
of 15.05 μl ddH2O, 2.5 μl 10× PCR-buffer, 1.75 μl MgCl2
(50 mM), 0.25 μl dNTP (2 mM), 0.2 μl dye primer mix
(0.06 μM labelled selective EcoRI-Primer and 0.6 μM nonlabelled selective MseI-Primer), and 0.25 μl Taq DNA
polymerase (5U/μl). For the selective amplification a touch
down PCR with a temperature decrease of 0.6°C of the
annealing temperature each cycle was applied. The program starts with 94°C for 60 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for
60 s followed by 13 cycles of 0.6°C decrease of annealing
temperature and 1°C decrease of elongation temperature
per cycle and 23 cycles with 94°C for 60 s, 56°C for 30 s
and 72°C for 60 s.
1.2 μl of each of the three different primer labelled
samples were mixed with 6.2 μl Hi Dye Formamid
(Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 μl GS-500 ROX size standard (Applied Biosystems). The samples were denatured
at 94°C for 2 min and then cooled down on ice for
4 min. The selective PCR products were electrophoretically separated using pop4-polymer (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 3100 (Applied Biosystems)
capillary sequencer.
Signal detection was performed with GeneScan version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescent threshold was
set to 50 relative fluorescence units. The signal intensity
was normalized with Genotyper version 2.5 (Applied
Biosystems). Fixed fragment categories were created.
A presence/absence scoring was conducted between 70
and 322 bases with a threshold set to 50 normalized

units. Category spacing was set to 1 base and the category tolerance was adjusted to +/- 0.5 bases.
We exemplarily tested the reproducibility of the AFLP
by repeating the steps from DNA extraction to selective
PCR with one primer combination for three samples.
The banding patterns were very similar in all cases.
However, repeatability of fragments dropped distinctly
above a fragment length larger than 322 bp. Thus, we
did not score fragments above this size.

(with the exception of the X. amphiconus-siderensis complex, which was constraint to be a single clade) as in the
tree based on the AFLP data and that the relationships
between the species correspond with the relationships in
that tree, using the ‘resolve multifurcations’ option of
Treefinder. Then we investigated whether this constrained
tree can be rejected in comparison with the unconstrained
maximum-likelihood tree by applying the approximately
unbiased test [52] as implemented in Treefinder.

Phylogenetic analyses

Species delimitation

Models of sequence evolution for the maximum likelihood analyses were chosen using ModelTest version 3.7
[43] based on the Akaike Information Criterion. A partitioning of the dataset with separate models for the three
codon positions was evaluated in comparison with a
uniform model for the complete dataset. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with Treefinder [44,45].
Confidence values were computed by bootstrapping
(100 replications; [46]).
We checked the homogeneity of base frequencies
across taxa using the chi-square test implemented in
PAUP* 4.0 beta 10 [47]. However, this test ignores correlation due to phylogenetic structure. Therefore, we
also measured the probability that the base composition
of two sequences is homogeneous for each pair of
sequences using the matched-pairs test of symmetry as
implemented in SeqVis version 1.4 [48].
To reduce compositional heterogeneity at the third
codon positions we recoded these positions into 2-state
categories by pooling purines (adenine and guanine: R) and
pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine: Y) (RY-coding, see [49])
using the GTR2 model in Treefinder. In addition we analyzed the data set using the nonstationary model of evolution of Galtier & Gouy [50] as implemented in nhPhyMLDiscrete [51], limited to 5 base content frequency categories
and with 6 categories for a discrete gamma model of
among-site rate variation. Trees obtained by nhPhyMLDiscrete were then compared using the approximately
unbiased test [52] implemented in CONSEL [53].
Jaccard distances were calculated from the AFLP data
using PhylTools version 1.32 [54]. These distances were
used to reconstruct neighbor-joining trees with PHYLIP
version 3.66 [55] and phylogenetic networks with the
neighbor-net algorithm [56] implemented in SplitsTree4
version 4.6 [57]. Confidence values for the edges of the
neighbor-joining tree were computed by bootstrapping
(1000 replications).
To show that the discordances between the mitochondrial gene tree and the tree based on the AFLP data are
not the result of a poor resolution of the mitochondrial
gene tree, we calculated the maximum-likelihood tree
based on the mitochondrial sequences under the constraint that the sequences of each species form a clade

The delimitation of provisional species using genetic data
or (presumably) genetically inherited morphological
characters is based on the criterion that species are
groups of organisms with similar genotypes as suggested
in the genotypic cluster definition of species given by
Mallet [58]. This criterion will usually be compatible with
other criteria such as intrinsic reproductive isolation [59],
because the lack of gene flow between reproductively isolated groups of organisms will result in an accumulation
of differences due to differential adaptation and genetic
drift that make these groups recognizable as different
genotypic clusters. However, species in the earliest stages
of speciation might differ only in a few genes that are
responsible for differential adaptation or reproductive
isolation. Such emerging species will hardly be recognizable using the genotypic cluster criterion.
We applied two strategies for delimiting provisional species. The first is based on a comparison of three independent datasets, namely (1) morphological data of the
genitalia and the shell as summarized in the current species classification [21], (2) the structure of the mitochondrial gene tree and (3) the structure of the tree and the
network based on AFLP data. Congruence between morphologically delimited groups, clades in the mitochondrial
gene tree and/or in the tree or the network based on the
AFLP data corroborates that such groups are evolutionary
units that can be considered as provisional species.
The second strategy is to determine species boundaries based on the multilocus data without considering
the morphologically based species classification or the
mitochondrial sequence data. Hausdorf & Hennig [26]
compared three methods for delimiting species based on
dominant multilocus markers. We applied these methods to the AFLP data of the Cretan Xerocrassa.
Hausdorf & Hennig [26] proposed to use Gaussian
clustering [25] for the determination of clusters of specimens as provisional species. We used the implementation
of MCLUST [25] in the program package PRABCLUS
version 2.1-1 [60] that is an add-on package for R [61].
We performed the mixture estimation for 0 to 100 clusters with as well as without a noise component for outliers. Gaussian clustering operates on a dataset where the
cases are defined by variables of metric scale. Therefore

Sauer and Hausdorf BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/299

we performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling
[62] using four dimensions and Jaccard distances as
recommended by Link et al. [63] for dominant genetic
markers.
Shaffer & Thomson [9] proposed to use STRUCTURE
[27,28] to delimit the lower bound of potential species.
STRUCTURE is a model-based clustering method using
multilocus data to infer population structure and assign
individuals to populations under the assumption of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within populations. We
used STRUCTURE version 2.3.1 with the model without
admixture as well as with the model with admixture. 10
runs with 100,000 iterations after a burn-in of 10,000
iterations were carried out in order to quantify the
amount of variation of the posterior probabilities of the
data for each cluster number K for K between 1 and 20.
We used the mean estimates of the posterior probabilities of the data for a given cluster number L(K) and the
statistic ΔK proposed by Evanno et al. [24] to estimate
the number of clusters.
We also applied the program STRUCTURAMA [29]
that is also a Bayesian approach designed for inferring
population structure by clustering individuals such that
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is maximized within clusters. However, in contrast to STRUCTURE, the number
of clusters and assignment of individuals to clusters can
both be considered random variables that follow a
Dirichlet process prior. Thus, this method can directly
estimate the number of clusters in which a sample can
be divided. We allowed the number of populations to be
a random variable with a Dirichlet process prior, run
the Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis for 1,000,000
cycles, sampled every 100th cycle, and discarded the
first 4,000 samples as burn-in.
Admixture analysis for inferring introgression

We used admixture analyses of the AFLP data with
STRUCTURE also to investigate whether cases of nonmonophyly in the mitochondrial gene tree can be ascribed to
introgression. For that purpose the species were analysed
pairwise with K = 2. We carried out 5 separate runs with
100,000 iterations after a burn-in of 10,000 iterations and
analysed the run with the highest likelihood.
