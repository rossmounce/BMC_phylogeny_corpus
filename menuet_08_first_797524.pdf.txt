Abstract
Introduction: Cystic fibrosis afflicted lungs support the growth of many bacteria rarely implicated
in other cases of human infections.
Case presentation: We report the isolation and identification, by 16S rRNA amplification and
sequencing, of two emerging pathogens resistant to colistin, Brevundimonas diminuta and
Ochrobactrum anthropi, in a 17-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis and pneumonia. The patient
eventually responded well to a 2-week regime of imipenem and tobramycin.
Conclusion: Our results clearly re-emphasize the emergence of new colistin-resistant pathogens
in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal-recessive hereditary diseases in Europeans and is
characterized by disorders of the respiratory tract and pancreas, and exacerbations of pulmonary infections. A limited number of organisms are responsible for these
infections, with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being of primary importance. Recent studies,
using molecular approaches, have identified uncommon
bacteria and/or novel pathogens in patients with CF [1]
including strains resistant to colistin such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia
cepacia and Inquilinus limosus [2]. While the frequency of
infection with these species is believed to be relatively low

and their significance unclear, they present a real challenge to diagnostic laboratories, as they are difficult to
identify and often misidentified as belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex [1,3]. We report the isolation
and identification, by 16S rRNA sequencing, of two
emerging pathogens resistant to colistin, Brevundimonas
diminuta and Ochrobactrum anthropi in a 17-year-old
patient with cystic fibrosis and pneumonia. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee (IFR48).

Case presentation
A 17-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis, and with diabetes and persistent colonization of the respiratory tract with
Staphylococcus aureus since childhood was admitted in

October 2006 to our specialized centre for a respiratory
infection with dark sputum, asthenia, fever (38.5°C) and
a loss of weight of 4.5 kg. On examination, the patient had
shortness of breath and diffuse crepitations in both lungs.
The oxygen saturation on air was 92% and her chest X-ray
showed a diffuse bronchitis syndrome with bronchial distension in the right lung apex and left lung base. There was
no pleural effusion. Relevant laboratory findings included
a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18,380/mm3 with
82.8% polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), a platelet count
of 618,000/mm3, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 57 mg/litre,
fibrinogen of 5.17 g/litre and whole blood glucose of 9
mmol/litre. An admission sputum sample was plated
onto Columbia colistin-nalidixic acid (CNA) agar, chocolate Poly ViteX agar, MacConKey agar (bioMérieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France), CEPACIA agar, and SABOURAUD agar
(AES laboratory, Combourg, France). Direct Gram staining of the sputa showed numerous PMNs (>25 cells/
field), Gram-positive cocci, and infrequent epithelial cells
(<10 cells/field). Apart from 107 CFU/ml methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, two different Gram-negative rods (oxidase and catalase positive) were isolated from CEPACIA
agar at 103 CFU/ml after 3 days of incubation. Using API
20NE (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), two isolates
initially identified as Weeksella virosa /Empedobacter brevis
(Code 0010014, 84.5% probability) and Ochrobactrum
anthropi (code 1641344, 98.9% probability) were definitively identified as B. diminuta (100% homology with B.
diminuta strain DSM 1635, GenBank accession number
X87274) and O. anthropi (100% homology with O.
anthropi strain W24, GenBank accession number
EF198140), respectively, after amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene as previously described [4].
Although there is neither clear consensus nor guidelines
for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of these two bacteria, AST was performed using VITEK 2 Auto system
(bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and disc diffusion
methods. The B. diminuta was resistant to amoxicillin,
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin,
trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and colistin but
remained susceptible to ceftriaxone, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/
clavulanic acid, imipenem, amikacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, isepamicin, rifampicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The O. anthropi was resistant to amoxicillin,
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam and colistin but remained susceptible to
ciprofloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, isepamicin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole
and rifampicin. The patient was initially treated with
ceftazidime (2 g 4 times/day) and nebulized tobramycin
(300 mg/day) for 2 weeks. The treatment was switched to
intravenous imipenem (4 g/day) and tobramycin (320
mg/day) for 2 weeks with dramatic improvement. Two
weeks later, the patient was clinically well and sputum
culture yielded a mixed oral population. B. diminuta and

O. anthropi were not cultured again in 5 sputa investigated
during 7 months of follow-up.

Discussion
B. diminuta is a non-lactose-fermenting environmental
Gram-negative bacillus previously assigned to the genus
Pseudomonas (Figure 1) that has been occasionally implicated in clinical situations in immunocompetent and
immunocompromised hosts including bacteraemia, urinary infection and emphysema [5,6]. In a study by Kiska
et al. [3], B. diminuta was isolated in a patient with cystic
fibrosis, after being misidentified as B. cepacia, but the
identification was not performed using molecular methods and the patient's clinical condition was not reported
[3]. O. anthropi is a Gram-negative non-fermenting bacillus widely distributed in the environment that has rarely
been reported as a human pathogen. It has been implicated in several clinical situations in immunocompetent
and immunocompromised hosts including osteochondritis, necrotizing fasciitis, endophthalmitis, cellulitis, sepsis,
chest wall abscess, osteomyelitis, endocarditis and pelvic
abscess [7-9]. O. anthropi is characterized by a broad spectrum of antibiotic resistance and is believed to be naturally susceptible to colistin [10] whereas there are
currently no available data for AST of B. diminuta. It
should be noted that our patient received a course of colistin to treat a A. xylosoxidans colonization 10 months
before the onset of this pneumonia. This may have contributed to the selection of these two colistin-resistant bacteria in our patient. We believe that these two colistinresistant pathogens were the main cause of her acute
pneumonia. Although S. aureus may also partially participate in the pathogenic process, O. anthropi and B. diminuta
were isolated during this pneumonia. Moreover, the
patient did not improve initially with an effective antibiotherapy against S. aureus (ceftazidime) and improved
using an effective antibiotic treatment against the two colistin/ceftazidime-resistant strains suggesting a role of one
or both colistin-resistant strains as an agent of lower respiratory tract infection in this patient.

Conclusion
Our results clearly re-emphasize the emergence of new
colistin-resistant pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis
as recently reported for Inquilinus limosus [2]. The
increased clinical use of nebulized colistin in patients
with cystic fibrosis may select specific colistin-resistant
bacteria. Furthermore, the use of Burkholderia cepacia complex selective agar associated with molecular approaches
may allow the identification of emerging colistin-resistant
pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis.
