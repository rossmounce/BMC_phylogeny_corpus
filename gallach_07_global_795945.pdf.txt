Abstract
Background: Sequencing of the genomes of several Drosophila allows for the first precise analyses
of how global sequence patterns change among multiple, closely related animal species. A basic
question is whether there are characteristic features that differentiate chromosomes within a
species or between different species.
Results: We explored the euchromatin of the chromosomes of seven Drosophila species to
establish their global patterns of DNA sequence diversity. Between species, differences in the types
and amounts of simple sequence repeats were found. Within each species, the autosomes have
almost identical oligonucleotide profiles. However, X chromosomes and autosomes have, in all
species, a qualitatively different composition. The X chromosomes are less complex than the
autosomes, containing both a higher amount of simple DNA sequences and, in several cases,
chromosome-specific repetitive sequences. Moreover, we show that the right arm of the X
chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura, which evolved from an autosome 10 – 18 millions of
years ago, has a composition which is identical to that of the original, left arm of the X
chromosome.
Conclusion: The consistent differences among species, differences among X chromosomes and
autosomes and the convergent evolution of X and neo-X chromosomes demonstrate that strong
forces are acting on drosophilid genomes to generate peculiar chromosomal landscapes. We
discuss the relationships of the patterns observed with differential recombination and mutation
rates and with the process of dosage compensation.

Background
Drosophila melanogaster has been one of the most important animal models since the beginning of modern genetics. It was therefore obvious that its genome should be
one of the first to be sequenced. Genome projects of
eleven other Drosophila species are now almost finished
and this provides the first opportunity to establish the global patterns of short-term genome evolution, at both the
genic and chromosomal levels, in metazoans. These data

are contributing to a detailed view of gene evolution,
intron length evolution, selective constraints acting on
non-coding sequences and many other processes [1-6].
A classical problem in molecular genetics and evolution is
the characterization of the complex relationships that
exist between coding sequences and repetitive elements.
Changes in the repetitive component of a genome may
influence all kinds of significant phenomena, from gene

expression to genome size. Studies comparing Drosophila
species were among the first that demonstrated that both
the satellites and the middle repetitive component,
mostly mobile elements, of closely related species may be
very different (summarized in [7]). The available genomic
information for drosophilids may now contribute to
obtain a much more detailed picture of the impact of
repetitive sequences on genome and species evolution.
One of the most interesting aspects to explore is the effect
that changes in repetitive DNA content may have on chromosome structure and function. Until recently, this type
of study was based on conventional cytogenetic analyses
plus in situ hybridization with repetitive probes. The presence in drosophilids of high-quality polytene chromosomes allowed to obtain some of the most significant
results of the pre-genomic era. These included the localization of mobile elements and the determination of their
rates of transposition (reviewed in [8]), the localization of
satellite sequences, including some specifically dispersed
along the euchromatin of the X chromosome [9,10] or the
demonstration that several simple DNA repeats were preferentially concentrated on the euchromatin of some chromosomes [11-13]. Particularly, Lowenhaupt et al. [13]
used in situ hybridization with mono- and dinucleotides
to obtain four main conclusions. First, they found that
Drosophila subgenus species had consistently more
repeats than species of the Sophophora subgenus. Later,
this difference between subgenera was indirectly confirmed [14-17]. Second, they detected that three types of
simple DNA repeats (CA/TG, CT/AG and C/G) were more
abundant on the X chromosomes than on the autosomes
of all the examined species, a result also later confirmed
using different approaches [18-20]. Their third conclusion
was that a chromosomal arm in D. pseudoobscura and D.
miranda, which was involved in a translocation with the X
chromosome and thus became a second X chromosomal
arm (named XR), was also enriched for these repeats.
Finally, they found that the X2 chromosome of D. miranda
– originally an autosome but that now segregates as a second X chromosome because its homolog, called neo-Y, is
attached in this species to the Y chromosome – contained
also some regions with repeat enrichment. In Drosophila,
and due to the fact that the Y chromosome lacks most of
the genes present on the X, the single X chromosome of
males is hypertranscribed to generate roughly the same
amount of products that the two X chromosomes of the
females, a process known as dosage compensation
(reviewed in [21,22]). The fact that the homolog of the XR
arm of D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda degenerated and
disappeared, created a similar need for XR to be dosage
compensated. Finally, the neo-Y in D. miranda is partially
degenerated and, therefore, the X2 chromosome is also in
part dosage compensated. All these phenomena occur by
the action of a dosage compensation complex (or compensasome), which recognizes and binds all the chromo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/408

somes of drosophilids that require to be compensated
[23]. The enrichment of repeats found in the works indicated above [11-13], perfectly correlated with the need for
dosage compensation.
In this study, we use the information currently available
for multiple Drosophila genomes to pursue the research
initiated twenty years ago. We were interested in three
questions. First, are there species-specific patterns of simple DNA repeats in drosophilids?. Second, is the X chromosome of drosophilids characterized by particular
sequence patterns, different from those found in the autosomes?. Third, if indeed the X chromosome has peculiar
patterns, which are the forces that generate them?. Here,
we show that the characterization in an evolutionary context of oligonucleotide profiles (counts of overlapping
words of a given size) offers insights on the forces that
shape the sequences of whole chromosomes. Particularly,
by comparing oligonucleotide profiles of several drosophilid species, we have obtained a precise view of how
chromosomes diversify in the Drosophila genus.

Results
X chromosome and autosomes of D. melanogaster have
different compositions
The program UVWORD, which determines the types and
frequencies of overlapping words of DNA in any given
sequence, was used to generate oligonucleotide profiles of
the sequences described in Table 1 (see Methods). We logically used D. melanogaster as a starting point for our
research. First, the general profile of sequence similarity
between the X chromosome and the autosomes of this
species was established. In Figure 1A, we show a typical
result for a 2 Mb fragment of the X chromosome. This figure summarizes corrected X/2L ratios, that is, the number
of times that a sequence of the X chromosome (target) is
found along the X (source 1) divided by the number of
times that the same sequence is found on the 2L chromosomal arm (source 2) and corrected by the relative sizes of
those sequences (See the "Chromosomal comparisons"
section of Methods for the details). These corrected X/2L
ratios should be about 1 for chromosomes for identical
composition. However, we observed a very complex landscape, ratios with values up to 150, indicating regions that
contain sequences that are highly repeated on the X chromosome but virtually absent on the autosome. When we
analyzed several of the broadest peaks, we found them to
be formed by tandem repeats (Figure 1A, details). BLAST
analyses of these sequences demonstrated that they have
high similarity to the X chromosome-specific satellite
described by Waring and Pollack [9] and DiBartolomeis et
al. [10] (Accession number: X62939). When we compared
two autosomes, a qualitatively different picture was
obtained. In Figure 1B, ratios obtained in the comparison
between chromosomal arms 3R and 2L are detailed.

For each species, the names of the chromosomes and the amount of DNA analyzed per chromosome (in Mb) are indicated. Accession numbers for
D. melanogaster chromosomes: Chromosome X: NC_004354.1; Chromosome 2L: NT_033779.2; Chromosome 2R: NT_033778.1; Chromosome
3L: NT_037436.1; Chromosome 3R: NT_033777.1. Scaffolds used for D. grimshawi were as follows: chromosome X (24821, 25009, 25041);
chromosome 3 (24946, 24992, 25029, 25033); chromosome 2 (24999, 25044); chromosome 5 (24997, 25023, 25050); chromosome 2 (24940,
25013).

Results were identical in all the other autosomal comparisons. Peaks as those observed in the X/2L comparison
were never detected. When any region characterized by
somewhat higher ratios was observed in more detail (Figure 1B, top), we simply detected slight departures of the
background values. Therefore, we concluded that, in D.
melanogaster, the profiles of different autosomes are very
similar, and totally different from that of the X chromosome.
We then performed a more precise comparison by determining the average values of the ratios between two D.
melanogaster chromosomes for different k sizes. Results are
shown in Figure 2. Figure 2A shows the results for comparisons involving the X chromosome (target) when the two
sources are this same chromosome and, in turn, each one
of the major autosomal arms. Interestingly, for k ≤ 6
(small words from mono- to hexanucleotides), the ratios
are essentially equal to 1, that is, there is no obvious differentiation among the chromosomes. However, for k > 7,
the values start to grow, increasing up to about 2.3 – 2.5
when k = 13. This indicates that, when the size of the
words extracted from the X chromosome is sufficiently
large, these words are in average overrepresented on the X
respect to the autosomes. However, this could be due to
two different causes. First, the X chromosome could have
a qualitatively different composition than the autosomes.
Alternatively, the effect could be simply due to long word
size: it is obvious that, for words obtained from a particular chromosome, the likelihood of them being present in
a different chromosome diminishes with word size.
Therefore, the results shown in Figure 2A could be caused
by the effect of word size in comparisons of chromosomes
not significantly different in composition. That this is not
a tenable explanation is demonstrated by comparing Figure 2A with the three first panels of Figure 2B, in which
different autosomes are compared. Indeed, there is some
degree of specificity provided by the words being selected
from one of the autosomes (the 2L chromosomal arm)

and specificity tends to slightly increase with word size.
However, it never reaches values above 1.5. These results
thus confirm that the X chromosome contains sequences
that are scarce on the autosomes, while all autosomes
have very similar compositions.
The last comparison in Figure 2B (2L/X) provides significant additional information. In this comparison, the
sequences are obtained from the 2L chromosome, but it
turns out that they are proportionally more frequent on
the X chromosome that on 2L itself, an effect that
increases with word size. This means that the X chromosome not only includes X-specific sequences that are rare
or even absent on the autosomes, such as the X-specific
satellites that we detected before. It must also contain a
second type of sequences, which are present on the autosomes but still are proportionally more frequent on the X.
The sequences that explain this last peculiar result can be
deduced from data summarized in Figure 3. To generate
this figure, sets of 5 105 words of size k = 13 were randomly chosen from either the X chromosome or the 3R
autosomal arm. Then, the relative frequencies of those
words on the X or 3R respect to a different autosomal arm,
2L, were determined and plotted. On the top, we show the
results for each comparison independently. Two differences can be observed. First, very high ratios for sequences
found a limited number of times (up to 200–300) are
much more frequent on the X/2L comparison. These
words correspond to the X-specific satellites. The second
difference is less obvious. On the top panels, a line indicating a ratio of 2 has been traced to make clear that many
X/2L values for highly repeated words (some present more
than 10000 times) are above that line. On the contrary,
ratios higher than 2 for highly repeated words are almost
absent in the 3R/2L comparison. The superposition of the
two figures (bottom panel) allows for these qualitative
differences to be more easily observed. This result demonstrates that, apart from the X-specific satellites, there are
many different, highly repeated words that are 2 – 4 times

them, mostly simple DNA repeats, are more abundant on
the X, decreasing the 2L/X ratio. This effect becomes more
important with increases in the word size k due to the correlation between having more simple DNA and having
more long simple DNA-based words.

more frequent on the X than on the autosomes. In Additional file 1 (first column, D. melanogaster data), we have
included the 50 most frequent words found on the X, their
frequency in the X and an autosomal arm and their X/
Autosome (X/A) ratios. These results demonstrate that the
highly frequent, X-enriched words are simple repeats. We
thus conclude that the D. melanogaster X chromosome
contains more simple repeats (i. e. it is quantitatively less
complex) than the autosomes of this species, in good
agreement with the indirect, partial results obtained previously by other authors (see Background section). This
quantitatively more repetitious sequence easily explains
the results of the right panel of Figure 2B: even when the
sequences derive from the 2L autosomal arm, many of

X and autosomes show also differences in other
Drosophila species
The results presented in the previous section demonstrate
that oligonucleotide profiling may easily pinpoint global
differences in nucleotide composition among eukaryotic
chromosomes. Now the question we wanted to tackle was
whether the results found for D. melanogaster were a peculiarity of that species or the same patterns were also
present in other drosophilids. We therefore performed
similar analyses in other six species, covering all the phylogenetic range of the Drosophila genus. Results are shown
in Figures 4 and 5 and in Additional file 1. In Figure 4, we
show for each species three typical results in which comparisons of the type X/A, A/X and A1/A2, where A is an
autosome, are summarized for a set of homologous chromosomes. Three conclusions can be drawn from these
results. First, the high specificity of the X chromosome is a
general feature of drosophilid genomes. Second, the similarity among autosomes that we observed in D. melanogaster is confirmed in the rest of species. Third, subtle
differences among species exist. For example, the X/A
ratios are particularly high in species of the melanogaster
group, whereas D. pseudoobscura is the species with the
least X chromosome specificity. In Figure 5, we show a
general profile of the X/A ratios for 1 Mb of X chromosomes of these species. The presence of multiple, very high
peaks, corresponding to dispersed X-specific satellites,
occurs only in melanogaster group species. We detected
localized X-specific repeats in D. pseudoobscura and did not
find any X-specific satellite in D. virilis or D. grimshawi
(data not shown).

As in D. melanogaster, the presence of X-specific satellites
contributes but however does not fully explain the results
for average X/A ratios described in Figure 4. Comparing
the results of Additional file 1 (all species) with those
shown in Figure 4, it emerges a clear correlation between
the X:A ratio values for the most abundant words, often
simple DNA repeats, and the global results described in
that figure. To demonstrate that it is indeed a difference in
the general amount of simple DNA repeats what mostly
determines the elevated X/A ratios and also to characterize
whether different species have different types of simple
DNA sequences, we established the relative frequency of
loci containing strings of mononucleotides, dinucleotides
and the most common trinucleotides detected in the
seven species (Table 2; here only independent loci were
counted using UVCOUNT, see Methods). Three main
results became evident. First, we confirmed that there is a

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:408

strong correlation between the relative frequency of the
most common oligonucleotides and the general X/A ratio.
For example, this explains the difference detected between
D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura (Figure 4): the first
species has many more simple repeats on the X than on
the autosomes and that difference is much smaller in the
second species. The second main result is that, although
the most frequent sequences are quite similar among species, there are some species-specific differences. For example, while in D. virilis most repeats, and especially (AC/
GT)n, (AG/CT)n and (CG/GC)n, are more abundant than
in D. melanogaster, the opposite is true for the (C/G)n
repeat (Table 2). A final significant finding is that two species have very abundant, complex X-specific sequences (in
bold in Additional file 1). Thus, we have detected that 26
of the most abundant words in D. virilis can be assembled
to build a 36 bp sequence (GGAGTTATGTTTTGGAACGTCATATCTCCGCGC). This sequence was first discovered
as part of the putative mobile element pDv [24]. Similarly,
in D. ananassae, 25 of the 50 most abundant words in the
X do not correspond to simple sequences. Assembling several of those words, a sequence of 38 bp can be built:
AAATTTCATAAGGATCGGCCGACTATATCCTATAGCTG.
Many complete or partial copies of this sequence, often
with some mismatches, are detected in BLAST searches
against D. ananassae chromosomes. To our knowledge,
this sequence had not been hitherto described. The rest of
the words fit into a 8 bp repeat (CTGTCCGT) or a 13 bp
repeat (TATACCCTTGCAG). The impact of these complex
repeats in the genomes of D. ananassae and D. virilis is significant. In the particular case of D. ananassae, the fact that
the words derived from the 38 bp sequence are typically
8–10 times more abundant on the X that on the autosomes (see Additional file 1) contributes to explain why
this species has the highest ratios in the X/A comparisons
of all species examined (Figure 4).
Interspecific comparisons
If indeed each species has particular amounts and types of
simple repetitive sequences, this should leave a general
imprint on the chromosomes detectable by interspecific
comparisons. The panels in Figure 6 show some intra- and
interspecific comparisons. A total of 5 105 words (k = 13)
randomly derived from the chromosome specified on the
x-axis were counted in both that chromosome and a second chromosome. In the panels, we have plotted those
frequencies, once corrected for the relative sizes of the
chromosomes. If both chromosomes have identical
sequences, they should generate the dashed lines shown
in Figure 6, with equal x and y values. If the regression
lines traced with the frequencies of both chromosomes
(continuous lines in Figure 6) are below that expected
line, it means that the sequences are relatively more abundant on the chromosome plotted in the x-axis than in the
chromosome plotted in the y-axis, while the opposite is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/408

true for regression lines above the dashed line. In addition, correlation coefficients (r) provide an estimation of
how related are the compositions of both chromosomes.
Figures 6A and 6B confirm the intraspecific results for D.
melanogaster obtained above: the X chromosome has more
repeats than the autosomes while two autosomes are
almost identical. Moreover, the correlation coefficient values close to +1 indicate that the same sequences are
present in both X chromosomes and autosomes. Figures
6C and 6D compare homologous chromosomes of two
closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans. It
is obvious that D. melanogaster chromosomes have more
repeated sequences than D. simulans chromosomes, in
agreement with previous results (summarized in [5]; see
also our Table 2 and Additional file 1). Interestingly, comparisons of Figures 6A, 6C and 6D shows that the differentiation between the chromosomes of D. melanogaster
and D. simulans is quite similar to the differentiation
between the X chromosome and the autosomes of D. melanogaster. This result means that a substantial degree of
differentiation among chromosomes can be generated in
a relatively short time, because these two species have
diverged for only about 5 millions of years [25]. Moreover, the r ≈ 1 values in the analyses shown in Figures 6C
and 6D indicate that the words detected are still essentially identical in the chromosomes of these two species.
Finally, in Figures 6E and 6F, homologous chromosomes
of D. melanogaster and D. virilis, two species whose lineages split about 63 millions of years ago [25], are compared. Two results are noteworthy. First, D. virilis has
much more repeated sequences than D. melanogaster in
both their X chromosome and autosome. Second, composition of the chromosomes is, for these two species, somewhat different. The r values are quite smaller than those
obtained intraspecifically. These results thus globally confirm the differences described in Table 2.
We already commented in the Background section of this
work that there is evidence for species of the Drosophila
subgenus having more simple DNA repeats than those of
the Sophophora subgenus. Results summarized in Figures
6E and 6F and in Table 2 are compatible with this idea.
However, a more effective way to characterize whether
this is the case is to obtain global relative ratios for homologous chromosomes in different species. As an example,
Table 3 shows the X/X ratios for different species, that is,
the average values of the frequencies of words of size k =
13 found in the X chromosome of one species (indicated
with the name in the rows) divided by the average values
of the frequencies of those same words in the X chromosome of a second species (names indicated in the columns), once corrected by the respective sizes of both
chromosomes. Values above 1.00 indicate that the words
are more frequent in the species that gives name to the

row, while values below 1.00 indicate that the words are
more frequent in the species indicated in the column.
Results shown in Table 3 confirm those observed in Figures 6C and 6D. They also extend the results to demonstrate that the two species of the Drosophila subgenus (D.
virilis and D. grimshawi) contain qualitatively more
repeats than the five species of the Sophophora subgenus
analyzed. On the other hand, the results within subgenera
are more complex. Most significantly, in seven cases the
two reciprocal comparisons between two species are both
above 1, a result that can only be explained by both species having similar amounts of repeats, but those repeats
being, at least in part, species-specific.
Evolution of the neo-X chromosomal arm of D.
pseudoobscura
In D. pseudoobscura, Muller's element D, which is normally
autosomic (e. g. in D. melanogaster, it corresponds to the
3L arm), suffered a translocation that converted it into a
new X chromosome arm, called XR. This translocation has
been estimated to occur more than 10 but less than 18
millions of years ago [25,26]. The non-translocated
homologous chromosome degenerated and probably
became the current Y chromosome of this species [27].
The availability of essentially complete genomic data for
D. pseudoobscura allows to characterize whether chromosomal profile changes have occurred in association with
this conversion of an autosome into an X chromosomal
arm. Figures 7 and 8 show the results for comparisons of
the XR chromosomal arm with the XL arm or with an
autosome. As it can be seen in Figure 7, left panel, the general comparison for XR and XL arms indicates that they are
virtually identical. Inspection of Figures 4 and 7 allows to
see that the results for comparisons of XR or XL with an
autosome are also identical. In Figure 8, we again show
the results for 5 105 random words, this time obtained

from different D. pseudoobscura chromosomes. Figures 8A
and 8B show that XL and XR provide essentially indistinguishable results when compared with an autosome. Figures 8C shows that, as happens in other species, D.
pseudoobscura autosomes have the same composition.
More interesting is Figure 8D in which we show that the
XL and XR chromosomal arms contain patterns of words
that are also indistinguishable, with a correlation coefficient which is about 1.0. These global results are also confirmed by data shown in Table 2 and Additional file 1.
These are striking results, because they demonstrate not
only that the neo-X (XR) arm has greatly diverged from
the autosomes but also that it has converged to the XL arm.
We can conclude that both X chromosome arms have,
after 10–18 millions of years of being together, a peculiar
and essentially identical sequence pattern.

Discussion
We have shown that the X chromosomes and the autosomes of Drosophila species have different global compositions. The X chromosome is enriched in simple repeats
and also contains, in some species, complex X chromosome-specific sequences. On the other hand, all autosomes within a Drosophila species have identical
compositions. There is however variation among species,
with those in the melanogaster group being the ones with
the highest level of global X chromosome specificity and
D. pseudoobscura the one with the lowest (Figure 4). The
enrichment of simple DNA sequences on the X chromosome is not accompanied by a general modification of the
types of repeats. In all species tested, the words found on
the X and on the autosomes are the same, only their frequencies change. This is shown by the high correlations
observed for comparisons between X and autosomes (Figures 6, 8). A significant difference in chromosome composition is detected for comparisons between Drosophila

subgenus and Sophophora subgenus species. Sophophorans contain less simple repeated DNA (Tables 2, 3; Additional file 1). This result correlate with the fact that the
two species of the Drosophila subgenus have larger
euchromatic genomes (about 140 Mb) than the rest
(about 120 Mb; data from [28] at the DroSpeGe web page.
See [29]). In fact, simple DNA repeats could explain a substantial part of the differences in genome size. The repeats
detailed in Table 2 (a fraction of the total present in those
chromosomes) account for about 6 Mb of the 117 Mb
euchromatic genome of D. simulans and for about 12 Mb
of the 140 Mb euchromatic genome of D. grimshawi. This
means that they alone explain about 26% (6/23) of the
difference of euchromatic genome size between these two
species. Even after all these results, before concluding that
this difference between subgenera is general we must consider that the number of species examined is still small. In
fact, indirect results suggest that some species may not fit
this pattern. For example D. subobscura, a sophophoran
species quite closely related to D. pseudoobscura, seems to
have many repeats [30]. In addition, there is evidence for

significant differences among closely related species of the
Drosophila subgenus [31].

Again, values from k = 1 to k = 13 are shown for each comparison.

We may now ask which are the forces that are behind all
these patterns. In our opinion, the systematic finding of Xchromosome specificity in all species, the almost identical
results for autosomes within a species, the correlation
between evolutionary relatedness and differences in the
simple DNA components and the finding of convergence

The finding that D. melanogaster has many (AC/TG)n, (AT/
AT)n,(AG/CT)n and (A/T)n repeats was previously
described by other authors [13,18,32,33]. We have
detected also a considerable proportion of (AAC/GTT)n,
(AGC/GCT)n and (AAT/ATT)n simple sequences in this
species. These are also the predominant repeats in the rest
of melanogaster group species. In addition, all the species
of this group have considerable amounts of X chromosome-specific satellites, which are especially frequent in
D. ananassae (see Additional file 1). In general, the most
abundant simple repeats in melanogaster group species
are also the most abundant in the rest of drosophilids.
However, there are some differences. For example, melanogaster group species contain less (AG/CT)n repeats than
the rest (Table 2). These subtle differences, together in
some cases with the appearance of species-specific
sequences (D. virilis, D. ananassae), lead to global changes
when homologous chromosomes of distantly related species are compared (e. g. Figure 6; D. melanogaster – D. virilis comparisons). Modifications of the sequences of these
chromosomes occur at a relatively rapid timescale (see
also Figure 6; D. melanogaster – D. simulans comparisons).
A final significant result is that we have observed convergence in the global sequence pattern between the XL and
XR arms of D. pseudoobscura. The conversion of XR from
an autosome into a neo-X chromosomal arm has led to an
increment in its amount of simple DNA repeats up to levels which are identical to those in XL, the original arm of
the X chromosome (Figures 7 and 8). This process,
occurred in the last 10 to 18 millions of years, suggests
that the X chromosome in a given species has an optimal
composition, different from the autosomes, to which neoX chromosomes tend.

between the XL and XR chromosomal arms rule out that
these changes are due to chance alone. Systematic forces
must be operating that contribute to X chromosome differentiation from the autosomes and to autosome homogeneity within a species. Related forces must explain why
different species have different amounts and types of simple DNA repeats. Understanding the causes of these patterns may be of broad interest, because similar trends are
present in other animal species. For example, results in
primates are consistent with a rapid modification of
repeat content in closely related species and differences in

simple repeats between the X chromosome and the autosomes have been also observed [34-37].
A first interesting question is how to explain differences
between closely related species such as the ones that we
have studied. This is a classical problem. Several authors
have recently discussed the reasons why related organisms
have different amounts of non-coding and/or repetitive
DNA, often in the context of the impact that those
changes may cause on genome size [38-45]. The summary
is that there are many forces that influence the global

Page 13 of 18

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:408

composition of genomes. Some of them imply differences
in mutation rates while others are related to changes in
selective regimes. The problem is that the particular contributions of those forces are unknown. For example,
genome size tends to correlate with increases in simple
DNA and microsatellites [40,42,46], increases in intron
size (e. g. ref. [47]), increases in transposable element
number [41], etc, while a high rate of nucleotide deletion
tends to correlate also with a small genome size [48-50].
However, none of these forces fully determines genome
size, which leads to multilevel hypotheses involving many
different parameters (see discussions in [38,43,44,51]).
We can rule out some possible explanations for the
observed interspecific differences in the amounts of simple DNA sequences. For example, changes do not seem to
correlate with external features, such as the geographical
distribution of these species, which might be associated to
differences in life history traits. D. simulans and D. virilis,
which are in the extremes of the distribution of simple
DNA content, are both human commensals and thus
widely distributed [52]. Also, a weak correlate can be
obtained between size of the organisms and simple DNA
content (and genome size), because D. virilis and, especially, D. grimshawi individuals are bigger than the sophophoran species considered. However, organism size
obviously does not explain the differences observed for D.
melanogaster and D. simulans, two sibling species.
Agreement with internalist hypotheses is also difficult.
Some simple explanations can be probably dismissed. For
example, the rate of DNA deletion does not correlates well
with simple DNA content, because D. melanogaster and D.
virilis have similar rates [48]. The rate of point mutations
in unconstrained regions seems to be also similar in D.
virilis and melanogaster group species [53]. It is unclear
whether recombination contributes to explain the patterns observed. On one hand, increased recombination
may decrease genome complexity if recombination favors
the generation of repeats. On the other hand, selective
pressure to increase simple DNA repeats, for them to act
as recombinogenic sequences, could occur in some species (see Refs. [42,54-58]). In either case, we would expect
a strong correlation between recombination rates and
amounts of simple DNA repeats. However, in drosophilids, this correlation is not obvious. First, we would expect
a decrease in simple DNA repeats in species with low
chromosomal polymorphism, which lack inversions that
restrict recombination. However, this pattern is not
observed. For example, D. simulans is chromosomically
monomorphic (reviewed in [59]), but so is D. virilis [60].
In addition, the length of the chromosomes in map units,
an indication of the likelihood of recombination, correlates only partially with the amount of simple repeats. For
example, in reasonable agreement with their respective

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/408

amounts of simple DNA repeats, the X chromosome of D.
virilis has 170.5 map units, while the D. pseudoobscura XL
chromosome has 157.6 units and the D. simulans X chromosome only about 66 [61-63]. However, D. simulans has
total map distances which are about 30% longer than
those of D. melanogaster [62], while the amount of repeats
in all D. simulans chromosomes is smaller. In particular,
the X chromosome has about the same length in recombination units in those two species [62], in spite of their significant difference in repetitive DNA (Figure 6C). In
summary, although differential recombination rates may
contribute to generate the patterns observed, they cannot
explain them all.
Apart from recombination, there are three internal forces
able to increase repeatedness that may also contribute to
explain the interspecific differences obtained. First, differential intrinsic slippage rates among species, generating
more abundant and larger microsatellites in some of
them. Second, species-specific amplification of satellites.
Third, an increase in mobile element number in some species. These three forces may positively correlate. We have
obtained evidence for a relevant decrease in chromosome
complexity in some species to be associated to the amplification of relatively complex, repeated sequences (Xlinked satellite in melanogaster group species; complex
repeated sequences in D. ananassae and D. virilis). In the
case of the 36 bp sequence detected in D. virilis, it has been
described as included in a putative mobile element called
pDv [24]. It has been suggested that differential amplification of mobile elements may change in a short time the
global sequence pattern of a chromosome, especially if
the elements have simple internal sequences that contribute to the generation of new microsatellites [64]. So far,
evidence for this type of process is not strong, but we have
not found any result contradicting this hypothesis, so it
deserves further study.
A second pattern that requires explanation is why X and
autosomes are so different. This could be due to either
mutational or selective forces acting differentially in X
chromosomes vs. autosomes. In Drosophila, at least in
analyses involving closely related species, there is no evidence for strong differences in mutation or selective
regimes acting on coding regions of the X chromosome
versus those found in the autosomes (reviewed in [65]).
In our opinion, this leaves open two possible explanations. The first option is differential recombination rates
among chromosomes. Due to the fact that in Drosophila
males do not recombine, two thirds of the X chromosomes but only two fourths of the autosomes recombine
in each generation. Given a positive association between
recombination and generation of repeats, this could lead
to an increase of repeats on the X chromosomes. We think
however that recombination may again contribute but

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:408

does not fully explains our results. This hypothesis predicts a correlation between relative recombination rates
and relative amounts of repeats that it is not observed.
Thus, comparing D. melanogaster, a species with a high X/
A ratio, with D. pseudoobscura, the species with the lowest
X/A ratio (Table 2), we would expect the former to have
higher relative recombination rates in the X respect to the
autosomes. However, the opposite if found. For example,
the X/2L relative euchromatic recombination rate is 1.22
for D. melanogaster (data from Flybase.org) while the same
rate for the homologous chromosomes of D. pseudoobscura (X/4) is 1.94 [63]. Thus, recombination may influence but does not seem to determine the relative
proportion of repeats in X chromosomes and autosomes.
The second posible explanation is that the pattern
observed derives from a functional requirement for simple repeats on the X. Our favorite explanation is that it is
related to the need of dosage compensate the X chromosome. More precisely, the acquisition of dosage compensation might require a modification of the DNA of a
chromosome to make it more repetitious. This could be
caused by the dosage compensation complex using simple
sequences to recognize the X chromosome. Alternatively,
an increase in simple DNA might contribute to increased
transcriptional levels by allowing the complex to act on
appropriate chromatin domains (see discussion in [22]).
The idea that repeats in some way contribute to dosage
compensation is old, but always lacked empirical support
(e. g. see comment in [66]). Several recent analyses of the
dosage compensation complex binding sites do not really
confirm or refute this hypothesis, because no obvious
consensus sequence required for binding has emerged
[67-71]. However, results obtained by Peter Becker's
group [68,69,71] suggest that repetitious sequences, rich
in CA/TG and GA/TC dinucleotides, may cooperate to
facilitate the binding of the complex. If this is the case, X
chromosome-specific binding could be achieved by
increasing the density of simple DNA repeats on the X
respect to the autosomes. Interestingly, a related situation
seems to explain the recognition of the X chromosome by
the Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation complex
[72,73]. Dosage compensation in humans, associated to X
chromosome inactivation, may also be related to the
enrichment of repetitive sequences on regions of the X
chromosome [74-76].
As a final aside, we must point out that this work shows
how useful is to perform oligonucleotide profiling studies
of eukaryotic chromosomes using long words (e. g. k =
13). The subtle differences that exist among chromosomes or among species can be very simply uncovered by
analyses using long, rare, words, while they are difficult to
demonstrate when shorter, more unspecific sequences are
analyzed. For example, Stenberg et al. [77] characterized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/408

by multivariate analyses the differences between chromosomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. pseudoobscura, using short words (up to k = 6). With hexamers, they
found strong characteristic signatures of the Muller F elements (dot chromosomes) of these species and just a
weak differentiation of the X chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, but not D. pseudoobscura, respect
to their autosomes. With our approach, based on larger
words, we have detected clear differences for all three species.

Conclusion
Oligonucleotide profiling allows for a rapid characterization of the patterns of sequence evolution. We have
shown that chromosome profiles are quite similar among
Drosophila species, with the X chromosome being always
simpler than the autosomes. However, the particular
sequences that confer this simplicity to the X vary among
species. The differences observed among closely related
species and the identical profiles of X and neo-X chromosomes suggest that strong forces are acting on relatively
short periods of time to generate these patterns. We suggest that the combined effects of differential recombination, differential generation of simple DNA repeats and
natural selection caused by the need of dosage compensation may explain our results.

Methods
Genomic data
We used genomic data for five species of the Sophophora
subgenus and two species of the Drosophila subgenus.
Within the Sophophora subgenus, four species of the melanogaster group (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba
and D. ananassae) and one species from the obscura group
(D. pseudoobscura) were analyzed. The two Drosophila
subgenus species were D. virilis (virilis group) and D. grimshawi (hawaiian Drosophila). These species were chosen
for two reasons. First, to cover all the range of divergence
times within the genus, from perhaps 5 millions of years
of divergence (D. melanogaster – D. simulans) to about 63
millions of years (species of the Sophophora subgenus vs.
species of the Drosophila subgenus) [25]. Second,
because at the time we started our study (beginning 2006)
they were, among the eleven ongoing drosophilid
genome projects, the ones with the best available
sequences. Table 1 describes the sequences used in this
study – ordered according to the standard nomenclature
of Muller elements, which correspond to homologous
chromosomal arms – and their origin. We centered our
attention on the X chromosomes and the longest autosomes. The dot chromosomes (Muller F elements) were
not considered. All the analyzed sequences were euchromatic. For D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba, the
chromosomes were already assembled in the databases.
For D. pseudoobscura, we added together all the pieces of a

Page 15 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:408

same chromosome in a single file. Finally, for the other
three species we added together several scaffolds that corresponded to regions homologous to D. melanogaster
chromosomes. Sizes of the final files ranged from 10.7 to
29.7 megabases (Mb). According to the most recent data
(December 2006 assembly of the Drosophila genomes; see
[78] and the DroSpeGe database [28]), these files contained from about 71.1% (D. grimshawi) to 97.2% (D.
pseudoobscura) of the euchromatin of these species, with
the average being 85.2%. Therefore, an assuming no
extreme biases occurred in the sequencing projects, our
samples may be considered fully representative of their
euchromatic genomes.
Oligonucleotide profiling
Characterization of the chromosomal profiles was performed using a program called UVWORD [79]. This program characterizes, using a sliding-window approach, all
overlapping oligonucleotides of a particular size k present
in a particular sequence (target sequence) and then establishes their frequency in another sequence (source
sequence). The user may select a value of k such that 1 ≤ k
≤ 14. If source and target sequences are the same, for
example a particular chromosome, the program provides
the frequency of all oligonucleotides of the chosen size k
in that chromosome. If, on the other hand, source and target are two different chromosomes, the program counts
how many times each oligonucleotide in the target chromosome is present in the source chromosome. Comparison of the results for two different sources allows for a
rapid characterization of the similarity of two DNA
sequences (see below: Chromosomal comparisons; [79]).
Along this work, we have used values of k ranging from 1
to 13 nucleotides. Most of the analyses requiring long
words were performed using 13 nucleotides. In general,
we preferred k = 13 because 13 is a prime number, being
thus less affected by the presence of repeats based on
dinucleotides, trinucleotides, etc. In all analyses, results
for both chains of the DNA molecules were added
together. Complex repeats in D. ananassae and D. virilis
were manually assembled from results in Additional file
1.
Calculation of the number of sites containing simple DNA
sequences
Because UVWORD counts overlapping words, a microsatellite may generate adjacent identical sequences that will
be counted multiple times (e. g. with k = 13, a (CA)8 microsatellite will generate two CACACACACACAC and two
ACACACACACACA sequences). Therefore, this program
cannot count the number of independent sites in which a
particular perfect repeat is present along a chromosome.
To solve this problem, we generated a second program,
called UVCOUNT. This program searches for a given
sequence or arbitrary size establishing its frequency and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/408

positions in a DNA sequence. After UVCOUNT analyses
were completed, results were filtered, in order to count
just once the words that overlap. This combined analyses
provided the number of independent loci that contained
a sequence of interest and their positions. Only strings of
six or more nucleotides (i. e. at least six contiguous identical mononucleotides, three contiguous identical dinucleotides or two identical trinucleotides) have been
counted in the analyses shown in Table 2. In those analyses, again, results for both chains of a double helix were
counted together.
Chromosomal comparisons
To obtain a global value of similarity for two chromosomes, we first obtained the counts for all oligonucleotides present in the target sequence (one of the two
chromosomes) in each of the two source sequences (i. e.
each of the two chromosomes in which we were interested, which we called "source 1" and "source 2" above).
For each chromosome, the counts were summed and averages were obtained. Then, the averages of both sources
were divided one by the other. This final proportion was
corrected to account for differences in size between the
two sequences. In random sequences of long size, this
final corrected value would be about 1.
