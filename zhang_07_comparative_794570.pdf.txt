Abstract
Background: Widespread transcription activities in the human genome were recently observed
in high-resolution tiling array experiments, which revealed many novel transcripts that are outside
of the boundaries of known protein or RNA genes. Termed as "TARs" (Transcriptionally Active
Regions), these novel transcribed regions represent "dark matter" in the genome, and their origin
and functionality need to be explained. Many of these transcripts are thought to code for novel
proteins or non-protein-coding RNAs. We have applied an integrated bioinformatics approach to
investigate the properties of these TARs, including cross-species conservation, and the ability to
form stable secondary structures. The goal of this study is to identify a list of potential candidate
sequences that are likely to code for functional non-protein-coding RNAs. We are particularly
interested in the discovery of those functional RNA candidates that are primate-specific, i.e. those
that do not have homologs in the mouse or dog genomes but in rhesus.
Results: Using sequence conservation and the probability of forming stable secondary structures,
we have identified ~300 possible candidates for primate-specific noncoding RNAs. We are
currently in the process of sequencing the orthologous regions of these candidate sequences in
several other primate species. We will then be able to apply a "phylogenetic shadowing" approach
to analyze the functionality of these ncRNA candidates.
Conclusion: The existence of potential primate-specific functional transcripts has demonstrated
the limitation of previous genome comparison studies, which put too much emphasis on
conservation between human and rodents. It also argues for the necessity of sequencing additional
primate species to gain a better and more comprehensive understanding of the human genome.

Background
Whole genome tiling array experiments
The human genome is the blueprint that encodes most of
the functional components in the human body: proteins
and RNAs. With the completion of sequencing of the
human genome, the focus of the genomic research is shifting to identifying all the functional units encoded within
the genome. A new technology, the maskless oligonucleotide tiling array, has recently emerged as a powerful tool
to interrogate transcription activities on the whole
genomic scale and at unprecedented high resolution [1,2].
Using known genome sequence as blueprint, short oligonucleotides were synthesized to cover or "tile" each chromosome at regular intervals. Repetitive elements and
regions of low complexity are usually avoided in such tiling experiments. Biological samples such as mRNAs or
cDNAs are labelled with fluorescence and hybridized to
the microarray spotted with the probes. Just like regular
microarray experiments, the observed fluorescence intensities are interpreted as elevated transcription activity at
specific genome locations. The tiling array experiments
are most useful in verifying predicted exons and identify
novel exons and other transcribed sequence elements.

A number of tiling array studies on the human and other
genomes have been published since 2002 [3-6]. The
major differences among these studies are the resolution
of the tiles (length of the oligonucleotide probes and
intervals between them), and the coverage of the genome.
As of early 2006, the study by Bertone et al. (2005) is the
only one that covers the entire human genome. These
researchers designed ~51,000,000 probes of 36 mers,
positioned at every 46 nucleotide interval on average,
which cover ~1.5 GB of the non-repetitive genomic DNA
sequence from both strands of the human genome [4].
The biological sample used in this study was fluorescencelabelled cDNA, reverse-transcribed from triple-selected
polyadenylated RNAs [poly(A)+] from liver tissue. In
total, these researchers identified ~17,000 transcriptionally active regions (termed as TARs) in the entire genome.
There are strong correlations between the TARs and the
known gene annotations or predictions, e.g. 64% of the
genes annotated in RefSeq and 57% in Ensembl and 70%
in UniGene were observed in this study [4].
Widespread transcription activity in the human genome
The big surprise from the tiling array study is that transcription activities were observed in many genomic
regions that do not overlap with known gene annotations.
In fact, only about 40% of the TARs correspond to known
exons, and a significant fraction of the TARs (6,656 or
38.7%) are more than 10 kb away from any known exons.
Table 1 divides the TARs into groups according to their
distance to the nearest genes that are on the same strand
and also the opposite strand of the TAR. To estimate the

enrichment or depletion of the TARs in the different
regions, in Table 2 we break down the human genome
into 25 categories in the same way as for the TARs and list
the total length of these regions. Table 3 lists the density
of the TARs in these regions, for instance the upper-left
corner indicates that on average 574 base pairs per Mb in
the Distal/Distal category has evidence of transcription as
observed in the Bertone experiment. In contrast, on average 34,200 base pairs per Mb (3%) has evidence of transcription. It is likely that only a fraction of the human
genes are transcribed in the liver cell line, thus transcription activity is not observed for all the annotated exons in
the genome.
Such widespread transcription activities have also been
observed in other human tiling array experiments as well
[3-6]. There has not been a consensus opinion on the
exact nature and origin of these TARs (or called "transfrags" as in [6]), however, it has been pointed out that
many of these novel transcripts are not likely to code for
proteins as they do not have open reading frames of
longer than 300 nucleotides.
In addition to these microarray studies, widespread transcription activities outside of known human genes have
also been observed in other types of experiments. Long
serial analysis of gene expression experiments (LongSAGE) suggest that over 15,000 additional new exons
exist in the human genome, and over half of these may be
from new genes [7,8]. Ota et al. analyzed full-length
human cDNA library and discovered ~5,000 novel noncoding cDNA transcripts [9]. A large number of noncoding transcripts has also been reported to exist in the mouse
genome [10,11]. In addition to the mammalian genomes,
large number of intergenic transcripts were also observed
in plants and fruit fly [12-14]. Taking all these pieces of
evidences together, it was estimated that over half of the
human genome could potentially be transcribed [15], or
at least 90% of the transcription activity in the genome is
outside of well-characterized protein-coding exons [6].
Possible functional roles of the novel transcripts
There have been many theories proposed to account for
the origin, property, and possible functions of these novel
transcripts. It was suggested that some of these TARs may
be novel protein coding genes, novel RNA genes, antisense transcripts, alternative transcripts or just simply biological artefacts (please see [2] for a detailed discussion on
the possible hypotheses). Because of the prevalence of
such intergenic transcription activity (see above), it is
unlikely that these novel transcripts are experimental artefact or false positives. It is also unlikely that any single
mechanism can fully explain the observed novel transcripts, but perhaps the combination of explanations can
account for the bulk of the observed novel transcripts. For

example, it is possible that those TARs that are near the
known genes could represent previously unidentified
exons in the same gene structure, or represent alternative
transcripts caused by alternative promoters. Depending
on their degree of sequence conservation, some of the
"distal" transcripts, i.e. those that are far away from
known genes, are likely to be candidates for novel protein
coding genes or noncoding RNAs. This notion has been
suggested by many, including the researchers who conducted the tiling array experiments, as the most likely
explanation for the bulk of the novel transcripts [9,11,16].

ated as crucial components of cellular and organismal
complexity, which prompts some to ponder whether we
still live in an RNA world [20].
Many of the known ncRNAs in human and mouse were
discovered accidentally or from large-scale cloning experiments. The novel transcripts found in the tiling array
experiments offer a new resource to identify novel noncoding RNA transcripts. Kampa and colleagues have
screened the "transfrags" from Chromosomes 21 and 22
and identified 193 novel ncRNA candidates; they were
able to verify 126 or 65% of these ncRNAs by RT-PCR.
Remarkably, this extrapolates to ~4200 ncRNAs in the
entire human genome [16]. Several software tools have
been developed to predict ncRNAs by computational
approaches, especially on predicting miRNA, which have
defined secondary structures. These programs mostly
work by searching for conserved motifs, existence of secondary structure, cross-species conservation, or combination of above methods.

Some of the TARs may be functional noncoding RNAs
Mammalian genomes contain many RNA genes that do
not code for proteins; these are collectively called noncoding RNAs or ncRNAs [17,18]. The most well known noncoding RNAs include rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, Xist and
microRNAs (miRNAs). Table 4 lists some ncRNAs that
were recently discovered and also implicated in human
disorders. Some of these longer ncRNAs are sometimes
referred to as mRNA-like ncRNAs (mlncRNAs) because
they share properties with mRNAs such as splicing [19].
With the accumulating evidence on their prevalence and
importance, ncRNAs have become increasingly appreci-

In this paper, we describe our bioinformatics analysis of
these novel transcripts that were identified in the tiling
array experiment [4]. We will investigate their sequence

that they could code for functional noncoding RNAs. Figure 1 is a flowchart outlining the basic analysis steps.

Results
Large numbers of novel transcripts are conserved in other
vertebrates
We have BLASTed the TAR sequences against the genomic
sequences of a number of fully or partially sequenced vertebrates, including mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken, dog,
sea squirt, frog, and two kinds of pufferfish (Table 5). All
these sequences were downloaded from Ensembl website,
repetitive elements were removed by RepeatMasker [21].

Sequencing projects of two primates, Macaque (Macaca
mulatta) and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), are currently
under way. We downloaded the trace sequence files of
these two primates and included them in the homology
search as well. Because of the incompleteness of these
genomes, the existence or absence of homologs in these
libraries does not reflect the true level of conservation for
each TAR. We also searched for TAR homologs in mammalian cDNA and EST libraries, including H-Invitational
Database (H-InvDB) [22]), which contains 21,037 validated human full-length cDNA: mouse full-length cDNA
library (FANTOM) [10,23]); human and mouse EST
libraries from NCBI; and a macaque cDNA library from
[24].

Table 5 shows that 69% of the TARs have EST matches,
and 43% of the TARs have matches in the human cDNA
library, which further validated that the bulk of the novel
transcripts identified from tiling arrays are real transcripts
instead of experimental artefacts. As expected, more TARs
are conserved in the chimpanzee genome than in the
rodent genomes (90% vs. 50%), which is in line with
what would be expected for random genomic regions.
This is obviously the result of closer evolutionary relationship between the two primate species, but it also implies
that there must be many primate-specific transcripts that
are shared between human and chimpanzee but not
between human and rodents. A significant number of
TARs are also conserved in chicken (21%) and pufferfish
(16%).
TARs in noncoding RNA databases
We also searched for homologs of the TARs in several
sequence databases that contain known noncoding RNAs
(Table 5, bottom). We found that there are ~2,637 nonprotein-coding RNAs among the TARs, or about 15% of
the entire novel transcripts, which also include 138 miRNAs. Note that some of these databases such as RNAdb
also include hypothetical ncRNAs that are predicted from
cDNA libraries.

In addition to number of homologs in single organisms,
Table 6 further lists the number of TARs that are conserved
in more than one species, i.e. with different conservation

profiles. There are 4,806 transcripts (27%) that are only
present in human and chimpanzee but not in any other
genomes. Among these, 4,574 are not found in any
ncRNA databases.
Distal versus proximal TARs
Table 7 further divides these TARs according to their distance to the nearest annotated genes. It is intriguing to
note that the "Distal/Distal" category has more TARs than
any other category (highlighted by big bold fonts), even
for those TARs that are only found in chimpanzee. It is
likely that these are candidates for potential new protein
genes or noncoding RNAs. It is also clear that the TARs
that are far away from known genes tend to contain more
primate-specific transcripts than TARs near genes (2036
versus 1209 or 27.8% versus 14.3%). This may be because
the intergenic regions are less conserved between primate
and rodents, which consequently could be the places
where primate-specific transcripts are born.
Many TARs are predicted to have stable secondary
structures
It has been proposed that many of the transcripts identified in the tiling array or cloning experiments are novel
non-protein-coding RNAs that have potential regulatory
or catalytic functions. Okazaki and colleagues analyzed

the mouse full-length cDNA library, and estimated 15,000
or about half of the library are non-protein-coding and
functional RNA genes [10], but this number has been
debated [25]. A more thorough computational study of
the mouse transcriptom by Numata et al revealed a set of
~4,200 functional non-protein-coding RNA candidates
[11]. Kampa and colleagues analyzed the tiling array data
of human chromosome 21 and 22 [16]. They identified
193 novel RNA candidates and experimentally verified
126 of them. These researchers only used evidence of transcription in their predictions, which is powerful as demonstrated by the respectable 65% verification rate, but the
false-positive rates can be further reduced if additional
lines of evidence are incorporated. In this study, we utilize
2 lines of evidence: sequence conservation and RNA secondary structure, to make prediction on conserved novel
RNA transcripts hidden in the human genome.
Sequence conservation
Functional elements in the genomes are presumably
under selective pressure to maintain their sequence, therefore sequence conservation in other organisms are generally a good indication of functionality. However, we have
to be cautious when applying such principle onto RNA
sequences. It has been observed that except for structural
RNAs such as rRNAs, noncoding RNA genes are in general

less conserved than protein coding genes. This is particular true for regulatory RNAs [26], as some of the non-protein-coding RNAs, which have identical functions in
human and mouse, do not show obvious sequence
homologies. In addition, as pointed out earlier, too much
reliance on conservation can overlook lineage-specific
transcripts. Given the limitations of using sequence conservation alone in detecting ncRNAs, it is obvious that
additional approaches are needed to address these concerns, such as the probability of forming stable secondary
structure.
RNA secondary structure and thermodynamic stability
Functional ncRNAs usually form stable secondary structures, thus the potential of forming stable secondary structure are often considered as an indicator of functional
RNAs [27]. We evaluated a number of existing tools and
elected to use RNAZ in the analysis [28]. For every category of TARs that are listed in Table 7, we further filtered
them by running RNA structure prediction program
(RNAZ) on their sequences, the results are listed in Table
8. This filtering step reduced the number of ncRNA candidates by 6–7 folds; for example, only 1202 primate-specific TARs are predicted to have stable secondary
structures, and only 1073 of them are novel sequences
that do not have similar sequences in existing databases.
We are more interested in the "Distal" TARs since they are
at least 10 kb away from known genes and likely represent

new ncRNA transcripts. There are 353 of these novel
ncRNA candidates in the final set of candidates. Chromosomal coordinates and DNA sequences for these ncRNA
candidates can be found in Additional Files 1, 2 and 3.
Figure 2 shows the predicted structures of three possible
ncRNAs. Please see Additional Files 1, 2 and 3 for more
details.
It is interesting and encouraging that our analysis has discovered a large number of potential noncoding RNAs that
only exist in the primates. Conventional genome annotation efforts often limit the cross-species comparison to
human and mouse, such strategy likely have overlooked
many lineage-specific protein or RNA genes. As we discuss
below, special strategies are needed to uncover these lineage-specific sequences.

Discussion
Primate-specific noncoding RNAs in the human genome
It is important and fascinating to identify and characterize
the genes that are responsible for the primate or human
distinctiveness. In this paper, we discussed a bioinformatics analysis on the novel RNA transcripts discovered in our
previous tiling array work [4]. We are interested to identify
those functional novel transcripts that are primate-specific, i.e. they emerged only recently in the primate lineage
and thus have no obvious sequence homologs in other
mammalian genomes. This is a novel research area that

has been largely overlooked, and it potentially will have
great impact in the field of non-protein-coding RNAs,
comparative genomics, and also medicine.
Most of the current efforts in detecting novel coding or
noncoding transcripts require the transcript to be conserved in at least another mammalian genome, mostly in
rodent genomes since they were the only available mammalian genomes until the chimpanzee draft genome was
finished in 2005. Rodents and human last shared common ancestor at about 75–80 million years ago; their evolutionary distance from human is considered sufficiently
distant to be able to separate conserved functional
sequence that are under selective (purifying) pressure
from those background neutral DNA [29,30]. A potential
limitation of only using rodents as the yardstick in such
comparative studies is that it overlooks those genes that
have only emerged recently in the primate line-age, which
likely determine primate-specific traits. Three-way comparisons between human-mouse-rat genomes have
revealed 2302 rodent-specific exons, and similar number
of human-specific genes [30-32]. These new genes were
believed to have arisen through the following processes:

novo from non-coding DNA, and (iii) derived from retroposition or recombinations [33]. Similarly, lineage-specific ncRNAs must also be present in either rodents or
primates, which remain to be discovered.
Comparison with other predictions
Pedersen and colleagues recently developed a computational method called EvoFold, which utilizes the algorithm of phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammar
(Phylo-SCFG) to detect conserved structured RNAs in the
genome [34]. These researchers first aligned the whole
genome sequences of eight vertebrates (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish),
and applied the EvoFold program to derive 48,479
sequences in the human genome that are predicted to
have secondary structures. These predicted sequences can
be accessed at the UCSC genome browser.

We are interested to analyze the overlap between the Evofold predictions and the TARs. For each TAR, we identified
the closest ncRNA candidate as predicted by Evofold. Surprisingly these two datasets have very little overlap: 548
TARs overlap with an Evofold prediction, and 624 TARs
(including the overlapping ones) are within 100 bp of a

nearest Evofold prediction. Among the 548 TARs that
overlap with Evofold, only 16 were predicted by RNAZ to
be noncoding RNAs with P-value greater than 0.5. The
lack of overlap between TARs and the Evolfold predictions
is not really surprising, as the latter only looked at the
genomic regions that are conserved in eight vertebrate
species.
Phylogenetic Shadowing
As discussed above, the conventional phylogenetic and
comparative methods have their limitations in identification of lineage-specific transcripts. An alternative
approach, "phylogenetic shadowing", has been recently
used in a number of studies and is likely to be very useful
in this area. Phylogenetic shadowing is an alternative
method to phylogenetic footprinting, which is a more
commonly used comparative technique [35]. Both meth-

ods use comparative approach to identify functional elements hidden in a group of orthologous sequences, but
they work in different ways and are most suited in different situations. Phylogenetic footprinting is most useful in
searching for conserved elements that are present in
organisms that are very distantly related. As at such great
evolutionary distance, any conserved sequence would
have been the result of selective pressure, therefore must
be functionally important. In contrast, phylogenetic shadowing is best suited to study sequences from a group of
closely related species. It analyzes patterns of sequence
variations and mutations in a multiple sequence alignment, and separates the slowly evolving sites from the fast
evolving sites. The sites that evolve slower are inferred as
being under stronger selective pressure thus functionally
important. In order to rigorously calculate the sequence
variations without bias, phylogenetic relationships

Figure 2of secondary structures of three candidates for novel primate-specific non-protein-coding RNAs as predicted by program RNAZ
Example
Example of secondary structures of three candidates for novel primate-specific non-protein-coding RNAs as
predicted by program RNAZ. The genomic coordinates (NCBI build 34) of the three TARs are chromosome
2:10,415,689–10,415,908; chromosomes 11: 11,3423,510–113,423,729; and chromosome 7:56,614,161–56,614,382.

among the species is usually required. For closely related
species, such phylogeny information is normally easy to
obtain. Boffelli and Rubin were the first to employ phylogenetic shadowing, who used it on sequences from primates to discover regulatory elements and exon/intron
boundaries [35]. Phylogenetic shadowing was recently
used among a group of 9 primate species to identify conserved miRNA sequences [36].
Future directions
We have initiated a sequencing project to obtain orthologous sequences for the 353 candidate transcripts from several related primate species. Experimental details and
analysis will be reported in the future.

Methods
Searching for homologs in other genomes
For each TAR, we used Blastn to search for homologous
sequences in another fully sequenced genome or
sequence library. It is important to select the most optimal
Blastn e-value threshold, so that we will not miss any real
homologs, and also avoid too many false positive hits. To
select the e-value cut-off, we did the following control
experiments. We selected the experimentally verified
human miRNA hairpin sequences from the mirRegistry
database [37] as query sequences, and BLASTed them
against the mouse genome. We also included some negative sequences into the query set. All of these known
human miRNAs have homologs in the mouse genome, so

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 1):S14

the resulted e-values from this Blastn search should be the
optimal cutoff for selecting homologs in a different
genome. The results confirmed that e-value = 0.01 is sufficient to identify the homologs and separate the real
homologs from negative controls.
Predicting secondary structure in RNAs
Programs such as MiRscan, miRseeker and ProMiR are
dedicated to search for miRNAs [38-40] and programs
such as RNAZ, RNAFOLD, Mfold, ddbRNA, RANDFOLD,
MSARI, QRNA, FOLDALIGN were written to detect stable
RNA secondary structures [28,41-46]. A track (EvoFold)
was also implemented into the UCSC Genome Browser,
which indicates the potential of forming secondary structures for any give genomics locus. A number of databases
have been created to collect and categorize these ncRNA
sequences, which include Rfam [47], NONCODE [48],
microRNA Register [37], and RNAdb [49].

Among these RNA structure prediction tools, the RNAZ
program has been evaluated as the most effective [50],
and was used as the primary prediction tool [28]. The
effectiveness of the RNAZ program comes from its unique
approach in combining the predicted thermodynamic stability with the structure and sequence conservation index
[28]. The program has been tested on positive and negative control sequences. At the P value cutoff at 0.9, the program has the sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 98%
[28]. We are currently also testing other prediction software such as QRNA, we will compare these two prediction
results and investigate the possibility of using the intersection of the two predictions.
