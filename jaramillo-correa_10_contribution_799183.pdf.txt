The contribution of recombination to
heterozygosity differs among plant evolutionary
lineages and life-forms

Abstract
Background: Despite its role as a generator of haplotypic variation, little is known about how the rates of
recombination evolve across taxa. Recombination is a very labile force, susceptible to evolutionary and life trait
related processes, which have also been correlated with general levels of genetic diversity. For example, in plants,
it has been shown that long-lived outcrossing taxa, such as trees, have higher heterozygosity (He) at SSRs and
allozymes than selfing or annual species. However, some of these tree taxa have surprisingly low levels of
nucleotide diversity at the DNA sequence level, which points to recombination as a potential generator of genetic
diversity in these organisms. In this study, we examine how genome-wide and within-gene rates of recombination
evolve across plant taxa, determine whether such rates are influenced by the life-form adopted by species, and
evaluate if higher genome-wide rates of recombination translate into higher He values, especially in trees.
Results: Estimates of genome-wide (cM/Mb) recombination rates from 81 higher plants showed a significant
phylogenetic signal. The use of different comparative phylogenetic models demonstrated that there is a positive
correlation between recombination rate and He (0.83 ± 0.29), and that trees have higher rates of genome-wide
recombination than short-lived herbs and shrubs. A significant taxonomic component was further made evident by
our models, as conifers exhibited lower recombination rates than angiosperms. This trend was also found at the
within-gene level.
Conclusions: Altogether, our results illustrate how both common ancestry and life-history traits have to be taken
into account for understanding the evolution of genetic diversity and genomic rates of recombination across plant
species, and highlight the relevance of species life forms to explain general levels of diversity and recombination.

Background
Recombination, the re-assortment of genetic variation
into novel haplotypic arrangements by both homologous
crossover and gene conversion [1], is one of the main
sources of genetic diversity in Eukaryotes. It decouples
neutral variation from linked deleterious mutations that
are consistently eliminated by selection, and from beneficial variants, which would tend to be fixed [2]. Recombination can potentially increase haplotype variation and
expected heterozygosity (H e ) [3], either directly (for
instance, if mutagenic) or indirectly (through the effects
of selection). Thus, a higher recombination rate should

translate in higher genetic diversity within a given genomic region, population or even species.
At the within species level, recent evidence from DNA
sequence analyses has shown that recombination might
be as, if not more, frequent as mutation (e.g. [3] in wild
barley, [4] in Scots pine). These observations also hint
that there could be a positive correlation between the
rate of recombination and He. Although such as association is not always straightforward due to the labile nature of recombination and its susceptibility to selective,
stochastic and life trait related processes [e.g. [5-8]], a
direct and positive correlation between the rate of
recombination and heterozygosity is expected under
recurrent background selection regimes [9,10]. Indeed,
such a correlation has been observed in both animals
and plants [e.g. [11-15]], although balancing selection,

selective sweeps and/or higher mutation than recombination rates [e.g. [16,17]] could have the capability to
blur it within a few generations.
Across species, little is known about how the rate of
recombination evolves or how it is correlated with the
average levels of genetic diversity. In mammals, the
comparison of orthologous gene regions within and
across species has shown that a shared evolutionary history is a poor predictor of the rate of recombination
[18], which suggests that such a rate evolves at a rather
fast pace at short scales within the genome. However,
this pattern does not seem to be extended at the average
or genome-wide level, as the rates of recombination,
measured from genetic maps, showed a strong phylogenetic signal, with more closely related species having
more similar recombination rates [19]. Such results
might be due to the fact that broad-scale recombination
rates are constrained by meiotic mechanisms during the
disjunction of homologous chromosomes [e.g. [20,21]].
As a consequence, in mammals, the rate of evolution of
the genome-wide rate of recombination could be much
slower [19]. Such information is still missing in plants,
although a similar correlation between species relatedness and genome-wide recombination rate could be
expected given the fast speciation rates of some lineages,
especially angiosperms, and the fact that the disjunction
of plant homologous chromosomes is ruled by similar
constraints that in animals [20].
The average levels of H e are, on the other hand,
expected to change quickly and on short evolutionary
time scales due to their sensibility to stochastic forces
[22]. Among higher plants, the widespread, outcrossing
and perennial taxa have consistently higher He at allozymes and SSRs than their endemic, selfing or annual
counterparts, independently of any possible phylogenetic
relationship [22,23]. Nevertheless, sequencing
approaches in trees, most of them widespread, outcrossing and perennial, have surprisingly shown that these
taxa, in spite of their high average heterozygosities, bear
relatively low levels of nucleotide diversity at the DNA
sequence level when compared to plants with different
growth habits [reviewed by [24]]. These results could be
the product of a phylogenetic artefact, given that most
of the trees studied so far belong to particular clades (e.
g. conifers, Populus). However, this apparent contradiction could also suggest that recombination, instead of
mutation, might be more involved in maintaining or
generating the high levels of He observed in trees, than
in shrubs or herbs.
In this context, it follows then that three hypotheses
are worth testing: (i) whether the genome-wide rate of
recombination of higher plants shows a phylogenetic
signal; (ii) whether these rates differ between species
life-form (tree, shrub or herb), with trees having higher

Page 2 of 10

rates of recombination than other plant life-forms; and
(iii) whether higher rates of genome-wide recombination
translate into higher levels of He. In the present study,
we addressed these three key issues on higher plants by
using a comparative phylogenetic approach on a large
sample of average rates of recombination, estimated
from total genetic map lengths and physical genome
sizes, and mean values of He, calculated with SSR loci.
We provide a first insight into the evolution of the genome-wide recombination rate across plant lineages, and
show how this source of genetic variation is affected by
different life traits once the phylogenetic signals of all
parameters are accounted for. The control of such signals allowed us to discern whether species share similar
levels of recombination due to common ancestry and/or
to convergent life-history traits, such as growth habit,
that have arisen independently in different lineages [e.g.
[25-27]]. Finally, we made a preliminary survey on the
plant nucleotide sequences available on public databases,
in order to determine if the trends observed across species at the genome level can also be observed at the
within-gene scale.

Results
Estimates of genome-wide rate of recombination and He
at SSR loci were gathered for 81 higher plant species
(i.e. dicots, monocots and conifers) that were classified
according to their type of life-form (tree, shrub or herb).
A preliminary standard correlation analysis (i.e. uncorrected for the phylogenetic relationships among species)
revealed that these two traits were negatively correlated,
and that trees had higher recombination rates than
herbs but similar to shrubs (Table 1). However, the
examination of the phylogenetic distribution of our data
suggested that closely related species, such as conifers,
tended to have similar rates of recombination, as
revealed by their close location at the bottom-right corner of Fig. 1a, and by an analysis of residuals (not
shown). Such a trend was made further evident after
mapping the rates of recombination of our 81 species in
a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). A set of standardized phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) made at the
tips of this tree revealed a significant phylogenetic signal
for this trait (K = 0.35; P < 0.001), as the observed variance of the PICs for the recombination rate (0.0433)
was much lower than expected by chance (0.2469).
Following these results, a new GLM model was built
by taking the phylogenetic relationships of species into
account. This model revealed a positive and significant
correlation (0.83 ± 0.29) between the genome-wide rate
of recombination and He (Fig. 1b), and showed that lifeform explained a significant portion of the variation
found in the rate of recombination across taxa
(Table 1). The individual coefficients estimated for each

In these two models, all trees (conifers and angiosperms) were considered as a single life-form, which was fixed as baseline for the contrasts.
In this model, the conifer and angiosperm trees were considered as separate “life-forms”. The angiosperm trees were fixed as baseline for the contrasts.

particular trait integrated into this model further
revealed that the rate of recombination in trees was significantly higher (-1.52 ± 0.99) than in herbs (-2.38 ±
1.03; P = 0.023), and marginally superior than in shrubs
(-2.25 ± 1.06; P = 0.090; Fig. 3).
In order to avoid any potential bias due to the unusually large genome size of conifers (see ref. [28] and
Additional file 1), a second phylogeny-corrected model
was built after separating these taxa from the angiosperm trees. This model also revealed a positive and significant correlation between the genome-wide rate of
recombination and He, with a very similar value to the
one obtained with the previous model (0.84 ± 0.22).
Furthermore, an important effect of life form, with conifer trees having significantly lower recombination rates
than angiosperm trees and shrubs (Table 1, Fig. 3), was
also observed with this model.
Finally, in order to determine if the trends observed at
the genome-wide level could also be inferred at a finer
scale (i.e. within the gene space), a comparative analysis
was performed on within-gene recombination rates
recalculated from available nuclear gene DNA sequences
retrieved from public databases (see Additional file 2).
Briefly, only DNA sequences from single-copy nuclear
genes spanning at least 800 base pairs (bp), having a
minimum of 10 segregating sites, and sampled for more
than 20 chromosomes were taken into account. Shorter
sequences, sequences that were obtained from diploid,
and thus unphased material, or sequences obtained
from only a few (i.e. less than 20) individuals were deliberately excluded. This reduced dramatically the sample
size of the survey, but assured us the possibility of calculating the most accurate recombination rates possible
(see Materials & Methods for more details).
The patterns obtained roughly point in the same
direction than the trends observed at the genome-wide
level (Kruskal-Wallis test; P < 0.01; see Additional file
2). All the within-gene recombination rate estimates (i.e.

Rm, rMC, rT05, rMC/θMC and rT05/θT05) were lower in
conifers than in angiosperms, while most of the nonconifer trees exhibited higher values than the nondomesticated herbs and shrubs, with the possible exception of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis. These results are
obviously only exploratory, but they do open the door
for extended comparisons once enough genomic data
and physical genetic maps are available.

Discussion
The different models implemented in this study provide
evidence that the genome-wide rate of recombination
evolves slowly across higher plant lineages, with phylogenetically close species having more similar rates than
distantly related taxa. In addition, once phylogenetic
relatedness is accounted for, a positive and significant
correlation between the average rate of recombination
and He was observed, with life-form explaining a substantial part of the differences observed across taxa.
However, the significant taxonomic component made
evident by our models, particularly when the conifer
trees were considered separately from their angiosperm
counterparts, suggests that additional ancestral evolutionary features are also playing a key role modelling
both He and the genome-wide rate of recombination,
especially in long-lived taxa such as forest trees.
Phylogenetic signal of plant genome-wide rate of
recombination

The phylogenetically independent contrasts performed
herein demonstrate that the average rate of recombination is a relatively well conserved trait among closely
related plant lineages. Both the large number of species
(81) included, and the use of randomised datasets to
determine significance, provided enough power to detect
the presence (or absence) of a phylogenetic signal in our
recombination rate data. The distribution of values was
clearly non-random (Figs. 1a &2), which suggests that
the genome-wide rate of recombination of one species

could be used to predict the same measure in related
taxa for which no genetic map is still available [19].
Such a possibility is reinforced by the high levels of synteny and macro-colinearity observed in comparative
genetic mapping surveys among congeneric taxa (e.g.
[29] in the Rosacea, [30] in conifers). However, particular issues related to the selective or stochastic forces
that shape independently each particular species might
tend to blur these predictions. Indeed, different ecological and selective patterns might result in altered levels
of recombination [6-8]. For example, domesticated
plants tend to have higher rates of recombination than
their wild ancestors or relatives [7]. Nevertheless, our
comparative analyses pointed out that the putative differences between the genome-wide recombination rates
of domesticated taxa and their undomesticated relatives
were low when they were compared to the differences
observed between distantly related species (see Materials
& Methods for more details).
Plant life-form and genome-wide rate of recombination

The simultaneous presence of high He estimates at allozymes and SSRs [22,23] and high genome-wide rates of
recombination observed in trees when compared to

Page 5 of 10

other plant life-forms, suggests that recombination
might be playing a relevant role in generating genetic
diversity in these taxa. Common biological traits of
trees, such as their large population sizes, extensive gene
flow, outcrossing mating systems and long generation
times, point to common evolutionary forces that might
be shaping their amounts of genetic diversity in a similar way [22,31]. These common traits have been often
invoked to explain the differences observed in substitution and diversification rates between woody angiosperm
lineages and their herbaceous counterparts [e.g. [25-27]].
Further tree life-history features, such as their higher
basic number of chromosomes, have also hinted that
they might have higher genome-wide recombination
rates than herbs or shrubs [32,33]. This factor is
expected to promote diversity through its direct impact
on the number of crossing-overs and thus, in the rate of
genome-wide recombination. However, previous works
have shown, by correlating the number of chiasmata per
bivalent with different plant biological traits, that perennial and outcrossing angiosperms (including trees) had
lower recombination rates than their annual or selfing
counterparts [7]. The contradiction between these findings and our results might be explained by the important contribution of gene conversion to the mean rate of
recombination in higher plants. Such a contribution (as
estimated by f, the ratio of gene conversion to crossover) spans between 0.5 and 14 [e.g. [2,34,35]], and it is
not comprised in the direct count of chiasmata, while it
is included in the recombination rates derived from
total genetic map lengths [19], such as those estimated
herein. However, for this to be true, it is necessary that
the rate of gene conversion varies systematically
between perennials-outcrossers and annual-selfers.
Although so far there is no evidence for such a difference, it is expected that species with higher average He,
such as forest trees, will exhibit higher rates of gene
conversion because gene conversion can only be
detected in heterozygous sites [3,35,36]. In any case, the
growing number of surveys estimating the contribution
of gene conversion to recombination should eventually
allow testing for such eventual differences between trees
and other plant life-forms.
Correlation between recombination rates and
heterozygosity

The contribution of recombination to genetic diversity,
especially He, and the putative correlation of these two
factors has received increasing attention in the recent
years. Various theoretical works predict that, within a
genome, there should be a positive correlation between
the rate of recombination and genetic diversity at neutral loci under different regimes such as common selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking combined with low
mutation rates and/or background selection [9,10]. Such

a correlation has been indeed observed in different plant
and animal taxa [e.g. [11-15]]. However, such regimes
would hardly explain the correlation observed herein
across higher plants, unless the same selective forces
were acting in the same direction and determining, in
the very same way, the genetic variability across closely
related species. An alternative explanation would be that
differences in Ne or other life-trait related factors
observed across taxa, such as gene flow or generation
time length, were simultaneously affecting the rate of
genome-wide recombination and He [37]. On the other
hand, several authors have remarked the mutagenic
potential of recombination and its role in increasing
nucleotide diversity [e.g. [2,38,39]]. For instance, an
increased mutation rate has been observed during meiosis, and many of the newly detected mutations appeared
to be correlated with neighbouring crossover events
[38]. Such a correlation, if present across different species, might indeed explain the association observed
herein between the average rate of recombination and
He. Moreover, if the mutation rate is indeed higher in

regions with high recombination, then a correlation
between recombination rate and heterozygosity could
also be expected at a finer scale, for example among
orthologous genes across species.
Genome-wide vs. fine-scale recombination rates

Several studies have shown that the plant genome structure is highly heterogeneous and that recombination is
not randomly distributed, occurring primarily within
genes (reviewed by [2,40]). Such observation is reinforced by the similar gene-map lengths and the highly
variable physical genome sizes reported for plant species
(see Additional file 1), and thus raises the question of
whether the trends observed herein for the genomewide recombination rates can also be detected at a finer
scale. Although an exhaustive analysis such as the one
performed for the genome-wide estimates is out of
scope for this study, and is probably still not possible
due to the limited quantity of available data, this
hypothesis was preliminarily tested by recalculating
within-gene recombination rates on DNA sequences
retrieved from public databases (see Additional file 2).

Jaramillo-Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/22

Interestingly, trends were similar to those found for genome-wide recombination estimates, with conifers showing lower recombination than angiosperms and nonconifer trees (albeit very few data is available for this
group) having higher values than herb and shrubs.
These similar levels of conservation in recombination
rates inferred at different scales across plant species
strongly differ from what has been reported for mammals. In these taxa, the rates of recombination at short
scales appear to evolve faster than the rates at the genome-wide level [19], which suggest that different evolutionary forces might be operating at these scales. This
opens two new questions that can be answered only tentatively for higher plants: at which scale is the rate of
recombination evolving across-species? And, in consequence, what is the most evolutionary significant way of
measuring recombination? If recombination occurs more
often at the gene level, for example within gene hotspots,
then the rates displayed in Additional file 2 should be the
best way of measuring recombination. On the other
hand, if there is a substantial portion of the total recombination events taking place at intergenic regions, and
these events affect fitness, then the average genome
recombination rates (Additional file 1) would be the
most appropriate estimate. The answer to these questions
is particularly important for understanding the evolution
of conifers, which are in direct opposition to the general
trend observed for angiosperms, where species with larger genomes have higher rates of recombination [7].
Conifers vs. angiosperms

Among the surveyed tree species, conifers seemed to be
a remarkable exception. Most of the genome-wide
recombination estimates for these taxa were far lower
than those from angiosperms (Figs. 1 &3; Additional file
1). Indeed, conifers were one of the clades that contributed the most to the differences observed between the
non-phylogenetically and the phylogenetically-controlled
models (Table 1 and Fig. 1). These differences suggest
that the low rate of genome-wide recombination is an
ancestral trait in conifers, and highlight the importance
of considering phylogenetic relationships in comparative
analyses such as those performed herein.
Different features of the conifer genome, like its large
size, relatively small proportion of gene space and high
amount of repetitive elements [28,41], can explain their
low rates of genome-wide recombination. Previous
genomic and sequencing initiatives have shown that
conifers have a similar amount of genes, but within significantly larger genomes than angiosperms, a difference
that is mainly due to a more ancient and substantial
proliferation of repetitive and transposable elements
[41]. In model plants (i.e. maize, rice and Arabidopsis),
the genome regions where these elements occur have
reduced levels of recombination [e.g. [2,40,41]], which

Page 7 of 10

hints that whole genomes rich in these repetitive and
transposable elements, such as those from conifers,
could have lower average recombination rates, such as it
is shown in the present study. These elements have
been previously associated with important structural and
regulatory functions in model angiosperms [2,41], but
their roles are still to be determined in other taxa.
The patterns exhibited by conifers, high levels of H e
along with low amounts of nucleotide diversity at candidate genes (see [24] and Additional file 2) and low
recombination rates at both the genome and within-gene
scales, suggest that these species may have faced particular evolutionary forces that distinguish them from angiosperm trees. These forces could include frequent
balancing selection and variation of mutation rates
between coding genes and non-coding intergenic regions.
On the other hand, it is also worth mentioning that some
of the observed patterns could be due to imprecisions in
the estimation of genome-wide recombination rates in
conifers, prompted by the presence of large non-recombining regions or low gene density in large parts of the
genome [e.g. [10]]. This would allow for high levels of He
in low recombination regions, which could be maintained
by large ancestral population sizes and/or hybridization
among related species [42,43], such as has been observed
in Arabidopsis lyrata [44]. However, all these possibilities
could only be explored once large genome-wide molecular datasets that include regions outside the gene space,
pedigree surveys, and physical maps are available for a
good number of conifers.

Conclusions
Altogether, the results of the present study suggest that
recombination is correlated with genetic diversity in
higher plants, and that its effect is dependent on life-form,
being more important in trees than in herbs or shrubs.
This trend was observed at the genome-wide level, but
could also hold at the within-gene scale. In addition,
recombination not only appears to be conditioned by lifehistory traits, but also to rely on the evolutionary history
of species, as shown by the differences observed between
conifers and angiosperms at both genomic scales. These
differences might by due to the proliferation of large
amounts of non-recombining material, such as transposable elements, in the conifer genome.
Methods
Database assemblage

The average genome-wide recombination rate was calculated in cM/Mb for 81 plant species from 38 families
including dicots, monocots and conifers. It was determined based on published estimates of total genetic
map length and physical genome size as described elsewhere [19]. Diploid taxa were favoured and, whenever

Jaramillo-Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/22

possible, domesticated species were joined by at least a
wild relative of the same genus or family. After verifying
that the differences between the recombination rates of
domesticated plants and their wild relatives were not
significant (c29 = 5, P = 0.83), we pooled all the data.
Only those maps covering at least 60% of the genome
were included in the database. Estimates of genetic map
lengths (in cM) were corrected in order to account for
variation in marker density across studies, and for undetected crossovers at distal terminal markers, as suggested elsewhere [19,45,46]. Estimates of physical
genome size were either calculated from the haploid
genome weights available at the Kew Plant C value
Database [47], or retrieved directly from the primary literature. After classifying each species available according
to its life-form (tree, shrub or herb), the estimates of
mean He at SSR markers were also collected. Microsatellites were preferred to other codominant markers due
to their increasing availability in the literature, to their
putative neutrality and to their association with nonrepetitive DNA in plant genomes, including trees
[48,49]. Only those He values calculated from variation
in at least five microsatellite repeats were included. Estimates based on population studies were favoured, but in
some particular cases where such studies were not available (e.g. Coffea canephora, Macadamia integrifolia),
values determined from preliminary screen panels had
to be used. The complete database and references to the
primary literature are available in Additional file 1.
Phylogeny estimation, phylogenetic signal and
evolutionary correlations

Species were assembled in a phylogenetic tree with the
program Phylomatic as implemented in Phylocom 3.41
[50]. This program matched the genus and family
names of our 81 taxa with those included in the megatree (R20050610.new) built by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [51]. The resulting phylogeny was calibrated
using the age estimates from Wikstrom et al. [52] and
adjusted by evenly distributing undated nodes between
the nodes of known age [50].
The presence of a phylogenetic signal for the recombination rate was determined following the procedure of
Blomberg et al. [53,54]. Briefly, the K statistic and its
associated P-value were estimated from the variance of
standardized contrasts, and compared with those
obtained from a null model performed by reshuffling
the trait values across the tips of the phylogeny. A significant phylogenetic signal was inferred at a = 0.05
when the mean observed variance of the contrasts was
lower than 95% of the values produced by the null
model. The phylogenetic independent contrasts were
calculated for both the recombination rate and He by
using the APE package for R [55].

In order to determine the putative correlations
between species ancestry, He and life-form, three independent Generalized Linear Models were built. The first
model was a non-phylogenetic (i.e. without taking the
phylogenetic information of species into account) GLM
with a Gaussian distribution of errors, which was made
between the (log-transformed) recombination rate of
species as dependent variable, and their respective He
and life forms as dependent variables. In the second
model, the phylogenetic relationships of species were
incorporated as a correlating matrix, obtained from the
phylogenetic tree above, into the GLM by using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) procedure. Such a
procedure is generally used to fit the parameters of a
GLM when the observations are correlated or non-independent. In our particular case, the common ancestry of
species is a source of non-independence, which was
taken into account with the inclusion of the above-mentioned matrix. The third model was similar to the second one, but on it, it was assumed that conifers and
angiosperm trees were different “life-forms”. The GEE
procedure used in these last two models was the one
implemented in the APE package [55].
Estimation of recombination rates based on nuclear gene
DNA sequences

Original DNA sequences from nuclear genes of nondomesticated species were downloaded from GenBank
or obtained directly from the authors (totalling ~2.5
Mbp distributed in 43 genes from eight species), and
edited and aligned with Lasergen SeqMan vs. 7 (DNASTAR, Madison, USA). Domesticated taxa were deliberately excluded because most studies in these species
focused on genes related to domestication, which typically show low levels of polymorphism and have followed artificial selection. Only those sequences spanning
at least 800 base pairs (bp), having a minimum of 10
segregating sites, and sampled for more than 20 chromosomes were taken into account. Similarly, only DNA
sequences from regions with low genetic differentiation
or from single populations were used for those species
with known population structure. For example, only
sequences from Sweden were considered for Populus
tremula or from Balsas for Zea mays ssp. parviglumis.
The aligned contigs were then used to estimate different diversity and recombination parameters such as the
average number of nucleotide differences (θπ), the minimum number of recombination events (Rm) [56], the
population-scaled recombination rate (r), and the
recombination to mutation ratio (θ/r). The first two statistics were computed using DnaSP vs. 4.2 [57], while
two different estimates of r and θ/r were calculated
with the composite-likelihood method of Hudson [58]
implemented in LDhat [59], and with the summary statistics method available in the rhothetapost software

[60]. Contrary to the first approach, the summary statistics method allows the co-estimation of mutation and
recombination rates, and the computation of 95% confidence intervals based on the posterior distribution of
these parameters. These analyses were made exclusively
on parsimoniously informative sites, and disregarding
indels and polymorphisms with more than two states.
Raw estimates of nucleotide diversity and recombination
parameters were finally taken from the original references for other species such as Quercus crispula [61]
and Hordeum spontaneum [3] and included in the
comparisons.
