Abstract
Background: Grape powdery mildew is caused by the North American native pathogen Erysiphe necator. Eurasian Vitis
vinifera varieties were all believed to be susceptible. REN1 is the first resistance gene naturally found in cultivated plants
of Vitis vinifera.
Results: REN1 is present in 'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara', two grapevines documented in Central Asia since
the 1920's. These cultivars have a second-degree relationship (half sibs, grandparent-grandchild, or avuncular), and share
by descent the chromosome on which the resistance allele REN1 is located. The REN1 interval was restricted to 1.4 cM
using 38 SSR markers distributed across the locus and the segregation of the resistance phenotype in two progenies of
collectively 461 offspring, derived from either resistant parent. The boundary markers delimit a 1.4-Mbp sequence in the
PN40024 reference genome, which contains 27 genes with known functions, 2 full-length coiled-coil NBS-LRR genes, and
9 NBS-LRR pseudogenes. In the REN1 locus of PN40024, NBS genes have proliferated through a mixture of segmental
duplications, tandem gene duplications, and intragenic recombination between paralogues, indicating that the REN1 locus
has been inherently prone to producing genetic variation. Three SSR markers co-segregate with REN1, the outer ones
confining the 908-kb array of NBS-LRR genes. Kinship and clustering analyses based on genetic distances with susceptible
cultivars representative of Central Asian Vitis vinifera indicated that 'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' fit well into
local germplasm. 'Kishmish vatkana' also has a parent-offspring relationship with the seedless table grape 'Sultanina'. In
addition, the distant genetic relatedness to rootstocks, some of which are derived from North American species resistant
to powdery mildew and have been used worldwide to guard against phylloxera since the late 1800's, argues against REN1
being infused into Vitis vinifera from a recent interspecific hybridisation.
Conclusion: The REN1 gene resides in an NBS-LRR gene cluster tightly delimited by two flanking SSR markers, which
can assist in the selection of this DNA block in breeding between Vitis vinifera cultivars. The REN1 locus has multiple
layers of structural complexity compared with its two closely related paralogous NBS clusters, which are located some
5 Mbp upstream and 4 Mbp downstream of the REN1 interval on the same chromosome.

Background
The repertoire of grapevine resistance genes against fungal
diseases has recently embraced a novel member, the first
naturally present in a genome of the cultivated species
Vitis vinifera [1]. Grapevines were domesticated in the
Mediterranean basin, in Western and Central Asia, and
then cultivated in all temperate regions around the world
[2,3]. Western Eurasian cultivars all succumb to powdery
mildew outbreaks in unprotected vineyards, following the
worldwide spread of the pathogen from the American
continent since the second half of the 19th century [4].
Russian breeders sought after sources of resistance in Central Asian varieties, which kindled hopes of finding resistance genes in cultivated vines (reviewed in [5]). 'Kishmish
vatkana' is a seedless grape originally found at the beginning of the 20th century in the Uzbek oasis of Shakhrisabz,
about 70 km south of Samarqand, and then maintained
in local germplasm collections. 'Kishmish vatkana' is able
to mount a post-penetration reaction against Erysiphe
necator Schwein, a trait controlled by the dominant gene
REN1 [1]. REN1 is a novel resistance gene located on chromosome 13, different from those that had been previously found in wild North American grapes and their
interspecific hybrids [6-12].
REN1 or other resistance genes might be present in other
accessions of V. vinifera grown in Armenia, Moldova, Russia, Georgia, and Uzbekistan (reviewed in [5]). Another
cultivar called 'Dzhandzhal kara', also written as 'Djandjal
Kara', "Karadzhandal', and 'Janjal kara' in Western literature [13,14] and identified with the synonym 'Semiz kara',
has been utilised by breeders as a source of powdery mildew resistance [14,15]. 'Dzhandzhal kara' was first
reported in the Uzbek district of Urgut, about 40 km
southeast of Samarqand, and a few more stocks also
existed in Kitab, within a 10-km range from Shakhrisabz
where 'Kishmish vatkana' was also found. 'Dzhandzhal
kara' is cultivated for the production of table grapes.
'Dzhandzhal kara' has normal hermaphrodite flowers
that develop viable embryos and yield seeded fruit. 'Kishmish vatkana' is regarded as a stenospermocarpic cultivar,
because its ovules degenerate soon after fertilisation at the
initial stages of embryogenesis. 'Kishmish vatkana' and
'Dzhandzhal kara' survive natural powdery mildew infections better than any V. vinifera cultivar. Under high disease pressure, E. necator occasionally escapes the plant's
defence reaction, which leads to microcolony formation
and limited conidiation in both cultivars, with
'Dzhandzhal kara' allowing slightly more hyphal growth
than 'Kishmish vatkana' (P. Kozma, unpublished results).
Adaptive evolution of V. vinifera under the selective pressure of the pathogen was generally disregarded, because
this crop is vegetatively propagated, and plants in the wild
have probably undergone few mating generations since
the arrival of the pathogen to the Eurasian continent.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

Thus, one might suspect a recent hybridisation with a
resistant non-V. vinifera ancestor accidentally present in
the area of cultivation, such as a North American rootstock or a wild grape from East Asia brought to the fertile
oases of Central Asia along the ancient trade routes to the
west [16]. 'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' are
unique within the species V. vinifera in their resistance to
powdery mildew, but they are typical among domesticated varieties in all other respects, particularly when
compared with varieties grown in the Uzbek oases where
'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' were found,
such as 'Nimrang' and 'Katta kurgan'. 'Nimrang' and 'Katta
kurgan' have been imported, utilised, and documented in
Western and in Far Eastern literature since the middle of
the last century [17-21]. Their pure V. vinifera origin has
never been called into question: instead they are credited
with some of the most distinguishing features of the V.
vinifera subsp. sativa group orientalis subgroup antasiatica
[22,23]. Similarly, 'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal
kara' conform to many morphological descriptors that
differentiate V. vinifera varieties from wild relatives, and
thus do not appear to be the result of a recent genome
introgression from feral grapevines.
If the REN1 gene had not moved into the V. vinifera germplasm from outside, the questions remain as to which
functional class this gene belongs to and how it has
evolved into functionality. Histological analyses have
shown that REN1 does not prevent cell entry in 'Kishmish
vatkana' but it inhibits the progression of pathogen invasion once haustoria have penetrated the host cells [1].
This mode of action bears a strong resemblance to that of
host resistance genes. Many plant resistances to powdery
mildews are controlled by NBS-LRR genes, which all confer post penetration resistance [24], including Run1 in the
muscadine grape [9]. NBS-LRR genes have proliferated
through reiterate tandem duplication in plant genomes,
forming gene arrays prone to random shuffling of DNA
segments. Genes in this class evolve rapidly, with their
clustered organisation facilitating some mutated members to express novel receptors that may match the effectors of a virulent pathogen. In vegetatively propagated
crops, R-genes are more likely to develop in wild populations or at the outer margins of the field crops, where
plants sexually propagate and generate genetic novelty,
some of which might provide a competitive advantage.
In this paper, we show (1) the presence of REN1 in a second Central Asian variety named 'Dzhandzhal kara',
which has some distinctive viticultural traits with respect
to 'Kishmish vatkana' (e.g. seeded vs. seedless table
grape); (2) the precise location of the REN1 locus using
recombinants from 461 offspring in two separate groups
of progeny, one from each resistant variety crossed with
susceptible grapevines; (3) gene content, structural organ-

sequence was used to find further putative coding regions
outside of the GAZE models [29].

Plant material and evaluation of powdery mildew
resistance
'Kishmish vatkana' and the progeny derived from its cross
with 'Nimrang' (04-10/nnn, where nnn is the identifier of
each seedling) are described in [1]. 'Dzhandzhal kara' was
kindly provided by P. Cindric', University of Novi Sad,
Serbia. 'Dzhandzhal kara' is one of the grandparents of the
segregating population derived from the cross
('Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta') × ('Katta kurgan' × 'Perlette'),
coded 07-12/nnn. Lasta is a downy mildew resistant
descendent of 'Villard blanc'. The 'Dzhandzhal kara' ×
'Lasta' offspring named SK91-4/27, later used for further
crossing, was selected at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, with the aim of combining downy and powdery mildew resistances with table grape traits. The other
grandparents are the table varieties 'Katta kurgan' and
'Perlette', a traditional Central Asian grapevine and a
recently bred V. vinifera intraspecific hybrid, respectively.
Except for 'Dzhandzhal kara', all grandparents are susceptible to powdery mildew, and 'Villard blanc' is the only
non-V. vinifera ancestor in the pedigree of the 07-12 population. All grandparents were analysed in order to trace
the origin of each allele segregating in the progeny. The
07-12 progeny were evaluated for powdery mildew resistance using the same procedure previously adopted for the
04-10 progeny [1].

A representative set of NBS-LRR proteins from Arabidopsis
and rice [30,31] was used for a tBLASTn search of the
REN1 region in order to uncover gene fragments and
pseudogenes. The matching regions and the corresponding NBS models were numbered progressively based on
their genome position. Each sequence displaying similarity supported by an E value of < e-10 was extended on each
side until the next predicted gene, and manually annotated using a gene prediction consensus obtained with
GenScan, FGENESH, GENEMARK, and Geneid. Amino
acid alignments to other plant CC-NBS-LRR proteins
guided the choice of the most likely gene model when
gene finders provided conflicting predictions. The
deduced amino acid sequences were aligned to reference
plant CC-NBS-LRR proteins using the module Blast 2
Sequences. Protein motifs were predicted using Pfam,
SMART, and COILS. Paralogous NBS genes of the NBS
members found in the REN1 interval were identified by
the best reciprocal match, and retained at the thresholds
of E values < e-10 and significant identity over > 100 bp.
Amino acid alignments were carried out using ClustalX.
Similarity trees were constructed using the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm implemented in MEGA, with 1000
bootstrap replicates. Comparison of duplicated regions
and drawing of DNA dot plots were performed using Dotter. Global DNA alignments were done using LAGAN in a
window of 100 bp with a minimum identity of 70%, and
visualised with VISTA. Nucleotide positions along chr13
refer to the version of the grapevine genome assembly
deposited under the accession number FN597036.

Development and mapping of markers in the REN1 region
A search for microsatellites around the REN1 region was
performed within the homologous interval of the
PN40024 genome sequence using a modified version of
the Sputnik repeat-finder [25,26]. SSR primers were
designed using Primer 3. The uniqueness of their annealing sites was confirmed by a BlastN search of the primer
sequences against the PN40024 genome sequence.
Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves. Segregation analysis was performed as reported in [1]. Local linkage maps were constructed using CarthaGene [27].

Kinship and population analyses
Genotypic data were produced using a set of 24 SSR markers, covering all chromosomes and including a standard
set of 6 markers for homogenisation with the European
Vitis Database [32]. Genomic DNA was PCR-amplified
using 200 μM of each dNTP, 1 U of Taq polymerase, and
2.5 pmol of each primer at an annealing temperature of
55°C with 30 PCR cycles. PCR products were run on a
Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000 capillary sequencer and alleles were sized with the CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis software, Fragment Analysis Module.

Gene annotation and structural analyses of the REN1
locus
Gene models and repetitive elements were predicted using
GAZE, Repeat Masker, Tandem Repeats Finder, RepeatScout, and ReAS [28]. GAZE gene models were annotated
by a BlastX search of the NCBI protein database, and
assigned to the predicted function of their best match. The
alignment of RNA-Seq short reads to the genomic DNA

Kinship analysis was performed using KINGROUP v2
[33]. Allele frequencies at 19 unlinked SSR loci (one per
chromosome) were calculated from a sample of 16 cultivars representative of the gene pool of V. vinifera ssp. sativa
convarietas orientalis and pontica, which include grapes
from Central Asia and from regions around the Black Sea.
Pairwise relatedness (r), which is a measure of the proportion of alleles in common that are identical by descent,
and associated p-values were estimated for each possible

pair of cultivars using the algorithm from [34]. Then, a
likelihood ratio (LR), with associated p-values, was calculated for each possible relationship category between the
pairs, using a hypothesized relationship as the primary
hypothesis, and the next closest relationship category as
the null hypothesis.
Clustering was performed using NTSYS. For the 16 accessions used in the kinship analysis, genetic similarity was
calculated using a simple match coefficient and clustering
was performed with the unweighted pair-group method
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and NJ algorithms. For
the extended germplasm comparison, genotypic data at
six markers recommended by the European Vitis Database
were obtained from public databases [35,36] and literature. Similarity was calculated based on a distance coefficient (DIST) in order to handle the lack of harmonisation
of allelic sizes from different databases. Principal component analysis (PCA) was based on standardised covariance
of genetic distances between 'Kishmish vatkana',
'Dzhandzhal kara', and alleles of 216 other accessions.
PCA was performed using GenAlEx [37].

Results
Genetic determinant of PM resistance in 'Dzhandzhal
kara'
Powdery mildew resistance is transmitted by 'Dzhandzhal
kara' as a Mendelian trait. The inheritance of PM resistance was investigated using an available cross population,
hereafter referred to as the 07-12 population, where
'Dzhandzhal kara' is one of the grandparents, the parents
being ('Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta') × ('Katta kurgan' ×
'Perlette'). Each of the grandparents is heterogeneously
heterozygous and homozygous at a genome-wide level,
while they are Rr, rr, rr, and rr for the PM resistance phenotypic trait, respectively. The parents of the 07-12 population are Rr and rr, respectively. Thus, the 07-12
segregating population is formally an intercross or cross
population, according to the nomenclature given by pop-

ular mapping software such as Carthagene and JoinMap.
However, this kind of population is the best approximation for a classical testcross in the genetic analysis of a heterozygous Rr trait in outcrossing species, in the absence of
full homozygous lines.
The inheritance of PM resistance was studied in 151 offspring of the 07-12 population by scoring the presence or
absence of visible symptoms. Of these, 71 siblings
showed masses of conidiophores detectable to the naked
eye, while 80 siblings showed no symptoms during the
entire vegetative season. The observed segregation ratio
fits a monogenic control of the trait (1:1, χ2 = 0.12), as
previously observed for 'Kishmish vatkana' [1].
In order to prove that (i) the parent 'Dzhandzhal kara' ×
'Lasta' is heterozygous for the resistance allele that controls this trait, (ii) the resistance allele was inherited from
the grandparent 'Dzhandzhal kara', and (iii) to assess if
this allele is the same as in 'Kishmish vatkana', a test of
independence was performed in the 07-12 progeny with
markers linked to REN1 and the alleles were traced back
to the parents and grandparents. The SSR markers
UDV124, VMC9H4-2, and VMCNG4E10-1 that flank
REN1 [1], and three markers that co-segregate with the
resistance locus in 'Kishmish vatkana' (see below) were
used for this screening. Out of these markers, UDV124
was the only homozygous marker in 'Dzhandzhal kara' ×
'Lasta' and it was substituted with the heterozygous
marker sc147_2, which is located 180 kb away from
UDV124 on the PN40024 reference sequence. One allele
at each of these loci was found to be shared by 'Kishmish
vatkana', 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta', and 'Dzhandzhal
kara', and the same allele was associated with the resistant
half of the seedlings bred from 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta'
(Table 1). Thus, the same SSR alleles in coupling with
powdery mildew resistance in 'Kishmish vatkana' are
present only in 'Dzhandzhal kara' among the four grandparents of the 07-12 family, and are inherited only by the

resistant descendents, except for the few cases in which a
recombination between the markers and the REN1 gene
has occurred.
Marker saturation of the REN1 interval in 'Kishmish
vatkana'
Markers across the REN1interval between VMC3d12VVIC51 and VVIP10, previously identified on 'Kishmish
vatkana' chr13 [1], were projected onto the PN40024
genome sequence by a BlastN search of their primer
sequences. Other markers in the same interval were gathered from the reference genetic map used for anchoring
the PN40024 genome sequence (Figure 1). This twopronged approach enabled the identification of the
genome sequence scaffolds covering the REN1 interval.
All scaffolds lacking an anchor to the 'Kishmish vatkana'
local map were mapped using scaffold-specific SSR markers selected from a reference genetic map [38]. At least one
marker per scaffold was placed in the genetic map (Figure
1). New markers were developed using the reference
sequence in the region between UDV124 and VMC9H4-2/
VMCNG4E10-1 at regular physical intervals. The candidate interval around REN1 was then filled with 14 markers heterozygous in 'Kishmish vatkana'. REN1 was
previously placed 0.9 cM proximal to VMC9H4-2/
VMC4E10-1: the relative order between these markers and
the locus was based on three recombinants, but the surrounding genome landscape was highly repetitive, with
only multi-locus markers available [1]. Hence, outer
markers were also developed on scaffolds flanking the initial interval on the distal side, in order to confirm the
outer border with more recombinants and more markers.
The saturated local map of 'Kishmish vatkana' is shown in
Figure 1. For details of all markers [see Additional file 1].
Using the recombinations that occurred in 310 germ cells
of 'Kishmish vatkana', the genetic interval was restricted to
a region corresponding to a block of continuous DNA
sequence in PN40024, contained in scaffold_47. Markers
developed on scaffolds distal to VMC9H4-2/VMC4E10-1
provided further evidence for excluding the possibility of
the resistance locus being located in the repetitive region
outside of the pinpointed interval (Figure 1).
Restriction of the REN1 interval based on crossovers in
'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta'
SSR markers were developed along scaffold_47 at regular
physical intervals [see Additional file 1], and mapped in
'Kishmish vatkana' and/or 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta',
according to their heterozygous state. Local genetic maps
around the REN1 locus across scaffold_47 encompass 11
informative markers in 'Kishmish vatkana' and 17 informative markers in 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta' (Figure 2). In
'Kishmish vatkana', REN1 co-segregated with 5 markers:
sc47_14, SC8_0071_014, sc47_19, sc47_18, and sc47_20.
The closest flanking markers are sc47_7 and sc47_11

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

which are located 0.7 cM away on the upper side of REN1,
and sc47_22, VMC9H4-2, and VMCNG4E10-1 which are
placed at 1.0 cM on the opposite side. In 'Dzhandzhal
kara' × 'Lasta', REN1 co-segregated with 3 markers:
SC8_0071_014, sc47_19, and sc47_18. The border on the
upper side is defined by a group of 8 co-segregating markers 0.7 cM away from REN1, and the lower side of the
REN1 interval is bordered by a symmetric group of 6 cosegregating markers at a distance of 0.7 cM. The closest
flanking markers correspond to a physical distance of 1.4
Mbp in the PN40024 sequence.
The haplotypes of the recombinant individuals that progressively restricted the interval down to scaffold_47 and
to the 1.4 Mbp region within scaffold_47 were visually
inspected and compared with their corresponding phenotype [see Additional file 2]. Genotyping of 310 offspring
of 'Kishmish vatkana' revealed four recombination events
that occurred most closely to REN1 in the germ cells that
gave rise to the individuals 04-10/48 and 04-10/248,
which both have a one-point crossover between markers
s47_11 and s47_14, and in the germ cells that gave rise to
the individuals 04-10/3 and 04-10/337, whose chromosome (chr) 13 tetrads recombined between sc47_20 and
sc47_22, on the opposite side of REN1. The interval
between sc47_11 and sc47_22 corresponds to 1.7 cM in
the 'Kishmish vatkana' genetic map, and to a physical distance of 2.2 Mbp in PN40024. Despite being sampled
from a smaller family of 151 offspring, the most informative recombinants in the 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta'
descendents originated from crossovers closer to REN1 on
both sides of the gene. The two closest recombination
events occurred in the germ cells that gave rise to the offspring 07-12/82, which bore a crossover between the
markers sc47_14 and SC8_0071_014 on the upper side of
the gene, and the offspring 07-12/139, which bore a crossover between sc47_18 and sc47_20 downstream of the
gene. The interval between markers sc47_14 and sc47_20
is 1.4-cM long in the 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta' genetic
map, and corresponds to 1.4 Mbp in the PN40024
genome assembly.
The REN1 region in PN40024: genes and structural
features
The REN1 region from marker sc47_14 to sc47_20 spans
1,440,612 bp in the homologous interval of the PN40024
genome. Within this region there are 27 genes predicted
by GAZE and BlastX that putatively encompass 15 different functions, and 11 other gene models that encode fulllength or partial NBS-LRR disease resistance genes with a
coiled-coil domain in each N-terminus [see Additional
file 3 and Additional file 4]. The hypothetical protein
products of 11 other gene models had no significant
match in NCBI. The average gene density is one gene every
28.8 kb. Gene distribution is quite even and complemen-

while all other coding sequences are disrupted in
PN40024 by small frameshift indels or insertion of transposable elements [see Additional file 4]. COILS predicted
the presence of a coiled coil structure for all genes, except
for NBSd, for which the N terminus is missing. The NBS
domain was invariably present, and the LRR region varied
in length. The level of nucleotide identity between NBSLRR gene models and across the CC, NBS, and LRR
domains, and in the 5' and 3' non-coding regions is
shown in Figure 4.
As for other genes with putative functions that might be
physiologically relevant to disease resistance, the most
abundant gene category was represented by 9 cinnamyl
alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs) involved in lignin biosynthesis, two WD40-repeat proteins, a kinase-like protein, and a Rab1/RabD small GTPase [see Additional file
3 for the complete list of genes in the region]. Among
these, 6 CADs, 2 DNA gyrases, a dihydropyrimidinase, a
kinase-like protein, an NADH-dehydrogenase, a vacuolar
protein, and a tRNAval synthetase showed evidence of constitutive expression in plantlets of PN40024, as assessed
by deep RNA-Seq [29].

the interval.
The 11 NBS-LRR gene models contained in the REN1
interval are arrayed over a physical distance of 908 kb,
comprised between the markers SC8_0071_014 and
sc47_18 (Figure 3). Even though chr13 is the richest chromosome in NBS genes, with more than a hundred genes
and pseudogenes, no other NBS gene was found nearby in
the same scaffold. The closest NBS genes outside of this
interval are located 3.4 Mb upstream of REN1 on
scaffold_73, and downstream on scaffolds_112 and 84,
respectively (see Figure 1). The NBS genes in the REN1
interval showed the highest identity with CC-NBS-LRR
resistance genes from soybean (Rps1-k) and potato (R3a),
in the range of 34-38% amino acid identity averaged over
the CC, NBS, and LRR domains. Two NBS genes of the
region, named NBSj and NBSk, are predicted by
FGENESH and GENEMARK to encode full-length gene

NBS paralogues in the REN1 region: local and ectopic
duplications
In order to shed light on the structural organisation of the
REN1 locus, a BLAST search using the NBS genes in the
REN1 interval as a query was performed against the whole
genome of PN40024, and the best three matches were
retained for each query. The best matches were most frequently found between pairwise comparisons of NBS
genes within the REN1 locus (chr13:16.7..18.1 Mb), but
in some cases also between an NBS gene of the REN1
locus and an NBS gene residing in either of the two other
gene clusters dispersed along chr13, one composed of 3
members and located approximately 5 Mbp upstream of
the REN1 interval (chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb) and the other
composed of 11 members and located approximately 4
Mbp downstream of REN1 (chr13:21.5..21.9 Mb, Figure
3). The relationships between the NBS members in the
REN1 region and in the paralogous clusters are shown in
a NJ tree (Figure 5). The estimated average evolutionary
divergence (d) over NBS pairs within the REN1 interval is
0.30 (d = 0.24 if NBSg, the most divergent one and the
only one in opposite orientation with respect to all others,
is omitted from the analysis), which is lower than the values found within the upper cluster (d = 0.35) and within
the lower cluster (d = 0.40). NBS genes in the REN1 cluster
had a closer relatedness with those in the upper cluster,
based on the average estimated evolutionary divergence
among NBS pairs between the clusters (d = 0.28), in comparison with the lower cluster (d = 0.55). The distance
between NBS genes in the upper and the lower clusters

Conserved regions between chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb and REN1, as assessed by dotplot comparison [see Additional file 5], and identity of conserved nucleotide sequences (>70% identity in a sliding window of 100 bp) are indicated by horizontal coloured bars.
NBS and CAD gene-rich islands within the REN1 locus were identified by dotplot self-comparison [see Additional file 5] and
are indicated at the bottom of the figure by horizontal cyan bars (1 to 5). Connections between gene-rich islands are defined
based on the percentage of conserved non-coding sequence. NBS gene relationships within REN1 in segmentally duplicated
fragments and in single-gene duplications are defined based on the percentage of conserved sequence in blocks of 10 kb around
each gene (Figure 4). The fraction of transposable elements (TEs) in a sliding window of 5 kb along the REN1 locus is given

was also 0.55. If the connection between sequence similarity and physical proximity between NBS pairs is disregarded, the estimated divergence within NJ clades, some
including individual members that reside in different
physical clusters, is far lower (Figure 5). Overall, these
observations are indicative of the concomitant contribution of local and ectopic duplications in the evolution of
the present-day REN1 locus.
The role of segmental duplications and/or small-scale
gene duplication between and within gene clusters was
assessed through three complementary approaches: dot
plot analyses, global alignments of the entire paralogous
segments (from 400 kb to 1.4 Mb), and percentage of con-

served sequences in pairwise alignments of the 10-kb gene
environment around each NBS-LRR gene.
There are 261.7-kb of conserved non-coding sequences in
the chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster (65% of the total length)
that are shared with the REN1 interval, at an average identity of 93.9%. Physical expansion of the REN1 interval can
be largely attributed to segmental local duplications of
DNA blocks containing NBS and CAD genes and also by
colonisation of genic and intergenic space by TEs (Figure
3). Overall, these events caused an approximate three-fold
expansion of the REN1 region with respect to the paralogous locus chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb. Regions of extended
colinearity are evident by dot plot comparison in the dis-

between the REN1 interval and the lower NBS cluster
(chr13:21.5..21.9 Mb) is more limited: they share only
3.9% of non-coding sequences, but gene order and orientation of two progenitor NBS paralogues and a CAD gene
in chr13:21.5..21.9 Mb are conserved, including the para-

logue of NBSg, the only NBS with forward orientation in
the REN1 interval [see Additional file 5]. Similar levels of

matches, the most parsimonious model of evolution,
which explains the present-day organisation of the REN1
locus in PN40024, is as follows. Three progenitor NBSLRR genes, structured in a proto-cluster in an ancestral
genome, generated the current genomic structure of the
REN1 locus and its paralogous loci through several episodes of ectopic and local duplications (Figure 3, ancientNBS-1 to -3). A segment containing two progenitor NBS
sequences (ancientNBS-3 and the oppositely oriented
ancientNBS-2) and the intervening CAD, duplicated
ectopically, giving rise to the common ancestor of the
REN1 locus and the chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster. The third
progenitor NBS sequence, that is ancientNBS-1 or one of
its six locally duplicated copies, duplicated and moved
ectopically to the present-day location of NBS353
(chr13:7.4 Mb), where it has remained as a dispersed
gene. The founder array composed of ancientNBS-1, -2,
and -3 locally proliferated through tandem duplications,
involving small blocks of DNA (<10 kb) around each of
the three founder genes, and generated a somewhat
ordered pattern of gene distribution at the present-day
chr13:21.5..21.9 Mb cluster (Figure 3 on top) [see Additional file 5].
In the chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster, NBS358 and an LRR
gene remnant in the opposite orientation with respect to
NBS358 are the most closely related paralogues of
NBS427-428 and NBS424-426, which suggests their origin from the ancientNBS-3 and -2, respectively. NBS358
and NBS359 were derived from a common progenitor
after a local tandem duplication, and diverged extensively
throughout the CC, NBS, and LRR regions (the presentday NBS358 has its N terminus disrupted but its fulllength paralogue in the REN1 locus, which is NBSc, allows
an approximate prediction across the CC-NBS domains)
before giving rise to NBS360. NBS360 appears to have
originated from a sequence exchange which caused fusion
of the LRR of NBS359 and an N-terminal region (including the coiled coil and the NBS domains) highly similar to
that predicted for the intact NBS358 (Figure 6). With
respect to their paralogues in the REN1 locus, NBS358
underwent insertion by a Gypsy transposable element in
the LRR and degeneration in the N terminus, involving
the 5' half of its NBS; the paralogue of NBSg was disrupted
and a relict of its LRR is the only trace of its presence; and
the N terminus of NBS360 was invaded by a Gypsy-like
retrotransposon.
The DNA block containing an intact progenitor of
NBS358, an intact paralogue descended from the oppositely oriented ancientNBS-3, a CAD, intact progenitors of
NBS359 and NBS360, and distally the genes tRNAval synthetase and vacuolar-sorting-protein-family-36, were the
progenitor sequences that ectopically duplicated giving

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

rise to the chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster and to the segment
that subsequently evolved into the REN1 locus.
The founder NBS genes of the REN1 locus were NBSc
(which is paralogous to NBS358), NBSg, NBSj (which is
paralogous to NBS360), and NBSk (which is paralogous
to NBS359). Comparison between NBSc, NBSj, and NBSk
corroborated the hypothesis that NBSj (or its paralogue
NBS 360) originated by a sequence exchange, which
brought together the CC-NBS domains of NBSc (or
NBS358) and the LRR of NBSk (or NBS359), far beyond
the boundary of the coding region on either side. The
hybrid position of NBSj and NBS360 in the NJ tree of Figure 5, between the pairs NBSc/NBS358 and NBSk/
NBS359, provides additional support for NBSj and
NBS360 being chimeric copies generated by intergenic
recombination.
Five gene islands populated by duplicated NBS and CAD
sequences were distinguishable by dot plot self-comparison of the REN1 interval (Figure 3), [see Additional file 5].
In order to understand the relative role of single-gene tandem duplications and larger duplications in generating
this expansion, the percentage of conserved sequence
between each pair of 10-kb sequence around each NBSLRR (Figure 4) was compared in the context of the percentage of conserved sequence between gene islands,
which ranged in size between 118 and 186 kb. Gene
islands 2-5 share 63.8 kb with 93.8% nucleotide identity,
which represent 42.4% of the total length. Gene islands 34 share 48.5 kb (40.3% of the total length) with 94.3%
nucleotide identity. Gene island 1 is more similar to 2
than to any other (90.6% identity across 64.4 kb, 39% of
the total length of the pairwise comparison). The founder
NBS genes are localised in three of the five gene islands
(NBSc-1, NBSj-4, and NBSk-5). Gene island 2 appears to
have originated from a duplication of gene island 5,
which might have involved as much as 63.8 kb. Within
gene island 2, NBSf has the highest similarity with NBSk,
located in gene island 5, and their sequence conservation
extends several kilobases outside of the coding regions
(Figure 4). The other two NBS genes in gene island 2
(NBSd and NBSe) appear to have arisen in this region later
by small scale duplications (see below). Gene island 3
contains NBSi, which is the most similar paralogue of
NBSj, a founder NBS in gene island 4 (Figure 4). Gene
island 1 is the most heterogeneous, and it has been
shaped by independent small-scale duplications. NBSa is
the paralogue of NBSc within the same gene island. NBSb
shares the highest identity with NBSj in gene island 4, but
the overlapping region does not extend significantly
beyond their coding regions (Figure 4). NBSb appears to
have later generated NBSe by a gene duplication, which
invaded gene island 2 together with a further duplication
of NBSf into NBSd. NBSg is the only founder NBS that did

not undergo single gene duplication and did not remain
involved in larger segmental duplications.
CAD genes in the REN1 interval have proliferated in a
similar way [see Additional file 6]. CAD8 and CAD9 in
gene island 5 are the most similar paralogues of the two
CAD genes present in the chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster.
Within the REN1 interval, CAD1 and CAD2, upstream of
all NBS genes, originated from a duplication of CAD8 and
CAD9, after the insertion of a LINE in CAD8, in addition
to the LINE shared with the progenitor CAD in the
chr13:11.8..12.2 Mb cluster. CAD4 and CAD7 share high
identity with CAD8, while CAD 5 and 6 show partial overlap with CAD8 in their coding sequences.
Kinship and population analyses: genealogy of 'Kishmish
vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara'
A kinship analysis was performed using 19 unlinked SSR
markers that covered all chromosomes and a small population of 16 grapevine cultivars representative of the
genetic diversity in V. vinifera ssp. sativa convarietas orientalis and pontica. The sample included 'Kishmish
vatkana', 'Dzhandzhal kara', several known and unknown
varieties native to Central Asia, as well as some seedless
cultivars that are typically grown in the same geographic
region where the stenospermocarpic 'Kishmish vatkana'
was originally found [see Additional file 7]. 'Kishmish
vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' share at least one allele at
16 out of the 19 markers and have an estimated coefficient
of relatedness (r) of 0.30, which is close to the expected
value of r = 0.25 for individuals that share a second-degree
relationship, that is half-siblings, grandparent-grandchild,
or avuncular [39]. A likelihood ratio of 2.12 (p = 0.046)
supported the hypothesis of a second-degree relationship
versus the null hypothesis of being unrelated. 'Kishmish
vatkana' and 'Sultanina' likely share a parent-offspring
(PO) relationship, supported by an estimated coefficient
of relatedness of 0.45. They share one allele at each of the
19 chromosome-specific loci. The likelihood ratio (LR)
calculated for the PO hypothesis versus the hypothesis of
being full siblings is 21.06. The PO relationship between
'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Sultanina' is supported by a high
level of significance (p = 0.005). Following this analysis,
'Sultanina' was genotyped at 24 SSR markers evenly
spaced along chr13 from VVIN62 to SC8_0149_003,
including the marker SC8_0071_014, which co-segregates
with REN1. As expected, 'Sultanina' does not have the
SC8_0071_014 allele which is in coupling with REN1 in
'Kishmish vatkana', nor is it resistant to powdery mildew.
However, 'Sultanina' does share one allele with 'Kishmish
vatkana' at each locus for all markers along chr13 [see
Additional file 8]. All alleles of 'Kishmish vatkana' along
chr13 that are not shared with 'Sultanina' are shared with
'Dzhandzhal kara', except for SC8_0149_003 at the very
bottom of the chromosome. A recombination between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

VVIP10 and VMC8E6 has occurred in the 'Dzhandzhal
kara' chr13 tetrad of the germ cell that gave rise to the offspring 'Dzhandzhal kara' × 'Lasta'. Kinship analysis indicates that 'Sultanina' and an unknown parent carrying
REN1 gave rise to 'Kishmish vatkana'. It is likely that the
parent carrying REN1 is also one of the parents of
'Dzhandzhal kara', the offspring of 'Dzhandzhal kara', or
a full-sibling of 'Dzhandzhal kara' (Figure 7).

'Dzhandzhal kara' transmitting the resistance to 'Kishmish

Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Northern
Afghanistan was performed using genotypic data at 24
loci covering all grape chromosomes and also including 6
SSR markers recommended by the European Vitis Database [32]. For Central Asian genotypes of uncertain identity not collected in official repositories, the most likely
varietal assignment was attributed based on their morphological features, and the country of origin was
assumed according to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue [40]. Genetic similarity was calculated using the
Simple Match coefficient implemented in NTSYS, and
cluster analysis was performed using the UPGMA and NJ
algorithms. Neither method identified ties in the similarity matrix and each one resulted in a single tree. Both clustering methods confirmed a close relationship between
'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Sultanina', and they firmly placed
'Dzhandzhal kara' among other V. vinifera native to
Uzbekistan and other countries in Central Asia, such as
the well-known varieties 'Nimrang' and 'Katta kurgan',
both of which are susceptible to powdery mildew (Figure
8).
Clustering methods applied to outcrossing diploids result
in an average estimation of the two component haploid
genomes present in each individual, which might obscure
the contribution of outlying alleles in hybrids with a single feral parent. Utilising the parent-offspring information
for 'Kishmish vatkana', the haploid genome that contributed the resistant REN1 allele could be separated from the
haploid genome contributed by 'Sultanina'. This allowed
the in silico construction of a di-haploid genotype which
contained those alleles of 'Kishmish vatkana' that were
not inherited from 'Sultanina'. The resulting virtual genotype was used for clustering with the same grape varieties
as described above, in order to shed light on the phylogenetic relatedness of the resistant genotype (Figure 8).
Though the virtual di-haploid did not become separated
from the Central Asian group, it clustered more distantly
from the Uzbek susceptible cultivars, and more tightly to
grapevine varieties from Georgia and Armenia. Interestingly, this region is considered one of the centres of origin
for domesticated grapes and is home to the highest
genetic diversity of V. vinifera around the world. The gene
pool analysed in this study encompassed 134 alleles at 24
loci. Only 3 alleles in 'Dzhandzhal kara' (6.2%) and 4 in
'Kishmish vatkana' (8.3%), including one allele at the
REN1-linked locus SC8_0071_014, were not found in the
reference gene pool.
In order to more widely sample the genetic variability represented in the grape germplasm, a principal component
analysis was performed using the 6 markers recommended by the European Vitis Database and genotypes of
218 accessions including cultivars of V. vinifera, rootstocks, hybrids, and wild species [see Additional file 9].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

Twenty three accessions are included in Cluster 1 [see
Additional file 9], 21 of which are Western European cultivars, and two (Orion and Phönix) are interspecific
hybrids with large parts of their genomes inherited from
V. vinifera backcrosses. Cluster 2 encompasses 36 accessions: two (41B and Léon Millot) contain 50% of a nonV. vinifera genome, and seven are interspecific hybrids
with most of the genome inherited from V. vinifera, while
the remainder have a predominantly Western European
origin. Cluster 3 is composed of Western European V. vinifera with a few hybrids intermixed. Cluster 4 encompasses the broadest heterogeneity, including North
American species and hybrids used as rootstocks. 'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' grouped together in
Cluster 5, along with other V. vinifera varieties of the
proles orientalis and pontica. Cluster 6 includes only 11
varieties, including 'Katta kurgan', 'Sultanina', and
'Monukka'.

Discussion
In this paper, we present evidence that the REN1 resistance allele, originally identified in 'Kishmish vatkana' [1],
is also present in the genome of a second Central Asian
grapevine cultivar named 'Dzhandzhal kara'. 'Kishmish
vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' are estimated to share
30% of their genome by descent, in addition to sharing
the resistant haplotype at the REN1 locus. The presence of
'Kishmish vatkana' and 'Dzhandzhal kara' was documented by Russian breeders after World War I, within a
few kilometres in the Kitab-Shakhrisabz oasis, the fertile
northeastern corner of the Kashkadarya River basin, south
of Samarqand. 'Dzhandzhal kara' plants were also found
in the district of Urgut, about 50 km to the northeast of
the Kitab-Shakhrisabz oasis, on the western edges of the
Pamir Mountains. While 'Kishmish vatkana' has been
neglected by viticulturists and has been maintained only
in germplasm collections, 'Dzhandzhal kara' has gained a
wide reputation for fresh fruit production in several countries of the former Soviet Union, and it has been firmly
classified as a pure V. vinifera in the international scientific
literature.
By identifying two grapevines that share REN1 by descent,
more information has been gained about the genealogy of
these resistant grapevines. A likelihood-based kinship
analysis, which predicts parent-offspring and seconddegree relationships without prior knowledge of the parents [41], provided evidence that one of the parents of
'Kishmish vatkana' is 'Sultanina', also known as 'Thompson Seedless'. This parent-offspring relationship is not surprising, since both cultivars produce stenospermocarpic
fruit, and 'Sultanina' has been widely cultivated for centuries in Uzbekistan and Northern Afghanistan, with the
local synonym of 'Ak-Kishmish'. Since 'Kishmish vatkana'
but not 'Sultanina' has a second degree relationship with

based on 24 SSR markers covering all grape chromosomes including the 6 markers recommended by the European Vitis Database [32]. Cluster analysis was performed using the (A) Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and
(B) the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithms. Panels C and D display the clustering of the same varieties except 'Kishmish vatkana'
and 'Dzhandzhal kara', which were replaced with a virtual dihaploid of 'Kishmish vatkana' constructed with the alleles not
shared with 'Sultanina'.

'Dzhandzhal kara', and the resistant and seedless 'Kishmish vatkana' displays a combination of biological features that are uncoupled in the parents (the pollen parent
'Sultanina' does not produce viable embryos and it is susceptible to powdery mildew, the unknown resistant parent must have been able to produce seeds), the direction
of the relationship could also be established. It is not
known whether the cross was made deliberately or
occurred by chance in a promiscuous vineyard. However,
the fact that 'Kishmish vatkana' is poorly documented in

chronicles and historical records, in spite of its attractiveness as a seedless and powdery mildew resistant table
grape, suggests that this hybridisation occurred rather
recently.
'Dzhandzhal kara' has a longer recorded history and was
already disseminated worldwide by the early 1970's,
which might suggest that the seedling 'Dzhandzhal kara'
is more ancient than 'Kishmish vatkana'. A grape accession catalogued as Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera 'KaraPage 15 of 20

dzhandal' in a US collection in 1965 is currently
maintained at the USDA-ARS National Germplasm
Repository in Davis, California. A variety named 'Kara
dzandzal' was mentioned in a trial conducted in Japan in
1969 on 74 varieties imported from the former USSR, and
recommended for breeding in a strict list of five top cultivars, including the typical Central Asian table grapes
'Katta kurgan' and 'Nimrang' [18]. A variety spelled
'Djandjal Kara' was included in a privileged set of accessions collected in Australian germplasm repositories and
used in a seminal work on cultivar DNA fingerprinting in
the 1990's [13].
Second-degree relationships could not be identified
between 'Dzhandzhal kara' and any of the few other Central Asian grapes analysed in this paper, except for 'Kishmish vatkana'. However, the alleles carried by
'Dzhandzhal kara' at 19 SSR loci sampled over all chromosomes and the 'Kishmish vatkana' alleles at the same
loci not shared with 'Sultanina' seem not to be foreign to
the gene pool of V. vinifera ssp. sativa proles pontica and
orientalis, which include domesticated cultivars from
Central Asia and around the Caspian Sea. Thus, the kinship data, in addition to the phenotypic features of these
plants, argue against close relatedness to exotic germplasm and the introduction of REN1 from outside of V.
vinifera, such as East Asian genotypes or rootstocks of
North American origin. Populations of Vitis vinifera ssp.
sylvestris, the grapevines that climb trees in natural environments, extend far into Tajikistan and the Western
Himalayas. The possibility of an infusion of genes, including resistance alleles if they exist, from indigenous and
undomesticated grapevines into Central Asian varieties
can not be excluded. The existence of continuous gene
flow between natural and cultivated compartments of V.
vinifera and the frequency with which these grapevines
spontaneously hybridise has been recently estimated in a
few Western European sites [42].
An inquiry further back into the genealogy of the powdery
mildew-resistant genotypes could provide additional
information regarding the origin of REN1. This might be
accomplished by DNA analysis of more exhaustive collections of the Asian V. vinifera germplasm. Grape germplasm is very rich with indigenous and introduced
accessions in the geographical region where the REN1
resistant genotypes have been found. Viticulture in fertile
oases of northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan was
founded by Greek colonists in the fourth century B.C. and
had already flourished by the second century B.C., at the
time when General Zhang Qian brought viticulture back
to China from his expeditions in the far provinces of the
Western Han realm and in the modern-day Uzbekistan
[43]. The geographical location of Uzbek oases on the
harsh northern routes of the Silk Road accelerated the
introduction of varieties traded from commercial hubs in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

the eastern Mediterranean basin (such as 'Sultanina',
which is thought to have originated in Iran or Turkey),
varieties from the Black and Caspian Seas, and grapes collected in the Xinjiang province of modern China and the
Turfan depression where V. vinifera cultivars have been
cultivated for over 2,000 years [see Additional file 10]. All
of this transiting material might have mixed and crosspollinated with locally domesticated grapes or indigenous
forms of V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris. In particular, Samarqand and its surroundings, where 'Kishmish vatkana' and
'Dzhandzhal kara' were discovered, was an important hub
for caravans that headed south crossing the Kashkadarya
valley to Termez, the gate to northern Afghanistan, and to
the junctions with the southern trade routes [see Additional file 10].
The restriction of the genetic locus in the resistant genotypes and the investigation of the genes contained in the
homologous interval of the PN40024 reference sequence
provided clues to the possible molecular nature of the
REN1 gene and to the structural organisation of the locus.
Functional candidates in the interval belong to two gene
categories: NBS-LRR genes and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases. NBS-LRRs are by far the most abundant class
of plant resistance genes, in particular in the context of
host-resistance and in response to biotrophs. The presence of this gene category in the REN1 locus is in agreement with the type of histological responses observed in
inoculated leaves of 'Kishmish vatkana' [1]. The necrosis
of penetrated host cells resembles the hypersensitive
response (HR) triggered by a gene-for-gene type of plantpathogen recognition. By contrast, it is not known if the
presence of CAD genes in the REN1 locus is accidental or
if it might have some biological significance. Cinnamyl
alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of the monomeric precursors of lignin. Different
CAD classes are involved specifically in wood development or in responses to biotic stresses.
CAD inhibition partially suppresses papilla-associated
cell wall appositions and jeopardises penetration resistance in powdery mildew-cereal interactions [44,45].
CADs are also involved in post-penetration resistance.
Intact CAD activity is necessary for expressing an epidermal cell HR in several plant-pathogen interactions
[46,47]. This observation has been explained by the role
of CADs in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis products
derived from cinnamyl alcohol, such as phenolic compounds and free radicals, which are integral to oxidative
processes and lignin cell wall encrustations associated
with HR. In grapevines, CAD transcript levels were constitutively higher in the powdery mildew resistant V. aestivalis 'Norton' than in the susceptible 'Cabernet Sauvignon'
[48]. It is noteworthy that evolution has frequently
favoured physical clustering of genes belonging to widely
different pathways but with related or complementary
Page 16 of 20

BMC Genetics 2009, 10:89

functions in defence responses (reviewed in [49]). The
accumulation of favourable alleles of physically linked
NBS-LRR and CAD genes that trigger and contribute to
exerting HR, respectively, would provide an evolutionary
advantage to the individual that inherited that block of
DNA.
NBS-LRR and CAD genes and pseudogenes in the REN1
locus were generated through several rounds of duplication events, which appear more chaotic than duplications
in the most closely related paralogous loci of the grape
genome. This DNA block appears inherently prone to
structural rearrangements, which makes it somewhat similar to the powdery mildew Mla resistance locus in barley
[49], the Rps1-k locus in soybean [50], and Rp1 complex
in maize [51]. In addition to segmental duplications and
extensive invasion of transposable elements, NBS genes in
the REN1 interval also evolved through intragenic recombination. The gene NBSj displayed a sharp variation of
nucleotide identity immediately downstream of the
MHDV site, the 3' border of the NBS domain, when compared to its paralogues NBSc and NBSk. NBSj is highly
similar to the 5' end of NBSc and to the 3' end of NBSk,
but substantially dissimilar to these in the complementary
parts. The level of identity with either paralogue extends
homogeneously beyond each end of the coding region,
indicating that NBSj is more likely the result of intragenic
recombination between tandemly arrayed paralogues
rather than the result of domain-specific accumulation of
advantageous mutations. Unequal crossing-over and gene
conversion are events of nonreciprocal exchange between
similar sequences, which can generate hybrid genes with
novel functions by domain swapping (reviewed in [52]).
Intragenic recombination frequently occurs between NBSLRR genes and promotes diversification by reassorting
domains between functional paralogues and by recruiting
fragments from pseudogenes that may have accumulated
mutations in the absence of selective pressure [53,54].
Either intrachromosomal gene conversions or unequal
crossing-over rearranged NBS-LRR paralogues in Arabidopsis thaliana [53] and at the maize Rp1 locus [51], respectively. Both events are favoured by close physical vicinity
between the partners, by high sequence similarity, and by
direct orientation of the gene pair [55], all features that
occur in the REN1 locus. In some instances, it was proven
that reassortment of domains by unequal crossing over
generate chimeric NBS-LRR variants associated with novel
race specificities (reviewed in [51]).
The structural organisation of the 1.4-Mbp sequence
across the REN1 locus in PN40024 bears the marks of a
dynamic evolution, which suggests that this genomic
region has an inherent capacity to generate high DNA variation at the population level. To pinpoint the gene that
confers the REN1 phenotype and determine how the
structure of the resistant haplotype differs across the REN1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/89

locus from that in the PN40024 reference sequence, cloning and sequencing of large insert DNA BAC clones from
'Kishmish vatkana' will be initiated. The functional identification of the effective REN1 gene and its sequence
information will shed light on the precise DNA variation
that brought about the powdery mildew resistance phenotype in V. vinifera.

Conclusions
We have provided evidence that the resistance gene REN1,
which prevents grape powdery mildew, is shared by
descent between two varieties of V. vinifera, which have
been documented in Central Asia since the 1920's. In the
Eurasian continent, outbreaks of powdery mildew have
occurred since 1845, after the accidental introduction of
the pathogen into Western Europe. The discovery of two
resistant accessions that are unique in their powdery mildew resistance among the several thousands of susceptible
V. vinifera varieties provides a model for studying the
molecular evolution of a resistance gene, active against a
recently introduced pathogen, in a host plant species previously thought to be entirely susceptible.
The analysis of the structural organisation of the REN1
locus in the reference grapevine genome sequence has
provided clues to the functional categories of candidate
genes present in the genetic interval, and revealed a chaotic expansion of NBS-LRR genes within the REN1 locus,
compared to its most closely related paralogous loci in the
grapevine genome. Tandemly duplicated paralogues in
the REN1 locus and other repetitive features in the region
may have created a highly unstable region prone to meiotic mispairing, which has accelerated duplications and
reshuffling of domains between gene copies, as witnessed
by at least one case of a chimeric NBS-LRR generated by
intragenic recombination between adjacent paralogues.
These events are likely to generate new functional variants, in particular when they occur within or immediately
upstream of coding regions and recombine the promoter
regions or functional domains originally present in separated gene copies. This scenario may have occurred in
NBSj, which bears the marks of a sequence exchange that
brought together the 5' promoter region, the coiled-coil
domain, and the complete nucleotide-binding-site of the
paralogue NBSc with the LRR region of the paralogue
NBSk.
