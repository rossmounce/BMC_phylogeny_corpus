Sessile snails, dynamic genomes: gene
rearrangements within the mitochondrial
genome of a family of caenogastropod molluscs

Abstract
Background: Widespread sampling of vertebrates, which comprise the majority of published animal mitochondrial
genomes, has led to the view that mitochondrial gene rearrangements are relatively rare, and that gene orders are
typically stable across major taxonomic groups. In contrast, more limited sampling within the Phylum Mollusca has
revealed an unusually high number of gene order arrangements. Here we provide evidence that the lability of the
molluscan mitochondrial genome extends to the family level by describing extensive gene order changes that
have occurred within the Vermetidae, a family of sessile marine gastropods that radiated from a basal
caenogastropod stock during the Cenozoic Era.
Results: Major mitochondrial gene rearrangements have occurred within this family at a scale unexpected for such
an evolutionarily young group and unprecedented for any caenogastropod examined to date. We determined the
complete mitochondrial genomes of four species (Dendropoma maximum, D. gregarium, Eualetes tulipa, and
Thylacodes squamigerus) and the partial mitochondrial genomes of two others (Vermetus erectus and Thylaeodus
sp.). Each of the six vermetid gastropods assayed possessed a unique gene order. In addition to the typical
mitochondrial genome complement of 37 genes, additional tRNA genes were evident in D. gregarium (trnK) and
Thylacodes squamigerus (trnV, trnLUUR). Three pseudogenes and additional tRNAs found within the genome of
Thylacodes squamigerus provide evidence of a past duplication event in this taxon. Likewise, high sequence
similarities between isoaccepting leucine tRNAs in Thylacodes, Eualetes, and Thylaeodus suggest that tRNA
remolding has been rife within this family. While vermetids exhibit gene arrangements diagnostic of this family,
they also share arrangements with littorinimorph caenogastropods, with which they have been linked based on
sperm morphology and primary sequence-based phylogenies.
Conclusions: We have uncovered major changes in gene order within a family of caenogastropod molluscs that
are indicative of a highly dynamic mitochondrial genome. Studies of mitochondrial genomes at such low
taxonomic levels should help to illuminate the dynamics of gene order change, since the telltale vestiges of gene
duplication, translocation, and remolding have not yet been erased entirely. Likewise, gene order characters may
improve phylogenetic hypotheses at finer taxonomic levels than once anticipated and aid in investigating the
conditions under which sequence-based phylogenies lack resolution or prove misleading.

Background
Animal mitochondrial (mt) genomes typically consist of
a circular molecule of DNA encoding 37 genes (2 rRNA
genes, 13 protein-encoding genes, and 22 tRNA genes),
the arrangement of which is often highly conserved
within major taxonomic groups [1]. Consequently, when

gene rearrangements occur, they may provide compelling phylogenetic markers that can corroborate or contradict hypotheses based on primary sequence data and
provide resolution for deeper nodes that are often
weakly supported in sequence-based phylogenies [2-6].
With recent technological and methodological advances
(e.g., rolling circle amplification: [7,8]; next generation
sequencing technologies: [9]), and associated decreasing
costs of DNA sequencing, the amplification and

sequencing of whole mt genomes has become routine.
As a result, there has been a marked increase in the
sequencing of whole animal mt genomes over the past
decade as well as the development of computational
methods to extract phylogenetic information from these
genomes through inferences of past gene dynamics
[10-12]. To date, 1868 complete metazoan mt genomes
are available in the NCBI Genomes database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/genomes/; January 8, 2010),
the majority belonging to arthropods (293) and vertebrates (1292).
Compared to other major metazoan phyla, molluscan
mitochondrial genomes are poorly represented at
NCBI [13], with only 78 complete mt genomes available as of January, 2010. Despite this, molluscan mt
genomes are beginning to challenge the traditional
view that mitochondrial gene orders are stable over
long periods of evolutionary time [13-16], a view based
largely on the heavily sampled and highly conserved
mt genomes of vertebrates. Instead, mollusc mt genomes demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in length
and “architecture” [16], reflecting differences in gene
complement resulting from gene loss or duplication, as
well as changes in the position and strand specificity
of tRNA genes, protein-encoding genes, and rRNA
genes. Changes in gene arrangement within the Mollusca have been so dramatic that representatives of
four classes of molluscs (Gastropoda; Bivalvia; Cephalopoda; Scaphopoda) share remarkably few mitochondrial gene boundaries, with gene orders varying
extensively even across major lineages of bivalves as
well as gastropods [14]. Changes in gene arrangement
have also been observed within bivalve and gastropod
genera, based on changes in position of: 1) tRNAs and
an rRNA gene in the oyster, Crassostrea [17], and 2)
protein encoding and tRNA genes in the vermetid
marine gastropod genus, Dendropoma [18]. Differences
in gene order are also evident between paternally versus maternally inherited mitochondrial genomes of
bivalves exhibiting doubly uniparental inheritance [19],
including the unionid freshwater bivalve, Inversidens
japanensis [14], and the marine venerid clam, Venerupis (Ruditapes) philippinarum (NCBI, unpublished).
Similar intrageneric gene translocations have now been
described in 19 of 144 genera in which two or more
complete mt genomes have been sequenced [16],
including representatives of the Porifera, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Mollusca, Arthropoda and Chordata. Thus, growing evidence suggests that mt
genomes of many metazoan phyla may be considerably
more plastic than originally believed, with the conserved genome architecture of vertebrates reflecting a
derived stabilization of the mt genome and not an
ancestral feature [16].

The discovery of mt gene order changes at lower taxonomic levels, as found within the Mollusca, is exciting
for several reasons. First, gene dynamics involving translocations and inversions of genes offer the promise of
new and robust characters that can be used to support
phylogenetic hypotheses at the level of families, genera,
and species [18]. Given the comparatively low rate of
rearrangement and the astronomical number of possible
gene arrangements, convergence is likely to be rare
compared to four-state nucleotide sequence data [20].
Second, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the
application of mitochondrial sequences and gene order
data to questions of evolutionary history and phylogenetic relatedness requires a better understanding of the
evolutionary dynamics of mt genomes [21]. Basic
mechanisms of gene rearrangement associated with
slipped-strand mispairing [22], errors in replication origins or end points [23], and intramolecular recombination [24], remain poorly understood. Likewise, tRNA
remolding and tRNA recruitment events [25-28], gene
rearrangement “hotspots” [29,30], the non-random loss
of duplicated genes [31] and gene order homoplasy
[32-34], which can act to confound phylogenetic inferences based on mtDNA sequences and gene orders,
need to be explored more fully. Comparison of gene
arrangements at low taxonomic levels can help to elucidate the process of gene rearrangement. For instance,
the signature of specific processes such as tRNA
remolding or recruitment can be most easily recognized
when such events have occurred recently, since
remolded or recruited tRNAs can be identified through
high similarity scores and phylogenetic analyses [27,28].
Likewise, those taxonomic groupings with unusually
labile genomes offer the opportunity to investigate the
mechanics of gene rearrangement: telltale vestiges of
gene duplication and translocation, typically erased or
overwritten with time, may still be present within these
genomes [35] and such intermediate stages can be critical to reconstructing the processes through which such
gene rearrangements have occurred. Comparisons of mt
genomes at low taxonomic levels, even within families
and genera, can thus be extremely helpful in interpreting the evolutionary dynamics of these genomes and
exploiting the phylogenetic signal retained within these
DNA molecules [16].
Here we present further evidence of highly dynamic
molluscan mt genomes by revealing extensive gene
order changes within members of one caenogastropod
family: the Vermetidae. Vermetids are a group of sessile,
irregularly coiled, suspension-feeding gastropods found
in warm temperate to tropical oceans around the world
that radiated from a basal caenogastropod stock in the
early Cenozoic Era. They are currently classified as
members of the Hypsogastropoda [36,37], a large and

Rawlings et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:440

diverse group with a fossil record extending back to the
Permo-Triassic boundary that includes all extant caenogastropods, except for the Architaenioglossa, Cerithioidea and Campaniloidea. While relationships within the
Hypsogastropoda are not well resolved, vermetids are
typically positioned within the infraorder Littorinimorpha. More specifically, molecular analyses suggest that
vermetids are members of a largely asiphonate clade of
gastropods including the Littorinidae, Eatoniellidae, Rissoidae, Anabathridae, Hipponicidae, Pterotracheidae,
Epitoniidae, Cerithiopsidae, Eulimidae, and Naticidae
[37]. This association is also supported by morphological
similarities in euspermatozoa shared by many members
of this clade [38].
Gene order rearrangements have been recognized previously in this family [18] based on small (<3.5 kb) portions of the mt genome sequenced from several species
within the genus Dendropoma. In this paper, we expand
upon these earlier results by providing complete mt
genomes for two Dendropoma species as well as for
representatives of two other vermetid genera, Thylacodes and Eualetes. We also reveal additional gene rearrangements within this family through the partial
genomes of the vermetid genera Thylaeodus and Vermetus. The extent of gene rearrangement within the family
offers great potential for improving our phylogenetic
hypothesis for the enigmatic Vermetidae as well as for
understanding more fully the mechanics of gene order
change within metazoan mt genomes.

Methods
Amplification and sequencing

Selection of taxa was based on: 1) the discovery of novel
gene orders in these species following PCR amplifications spanning gene boundaries [18] and 2) those genomes that successfully amplified using long and accurate
PCR (LAPCR). The collecting locality, tissue source, and
Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) voucher
information for each specimen, are presented in Table
1, along with GenBank accession numbers, primer
sequences, and lengths of amplification products. Other
gene arrangements have been identified in additional
vermetids based on partial genome sequences (<3 kb),
but these results are not presented here (Rawlings et al.,
in prep).
DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved tissues
using a phenol chloroform extraction protocol as
described in [39]. Initially, an 1800 bp region of the
mitochondrial genome spanning the rrnS to nad1 region
was amplified as part of a phylogenetic analysis of Vermetidae [18]. This sequence was subsequently used to
design outwardly facing primers for LAPCR (Table 1:
rrnL-F; rrnL-R). Because attempts to amplify the genome in one piece were not successful, we amplified a

650 bp fragment of cox1 using modifications of Folmer’s
widely used cox1 primers [40]. This cox1 sequence was
then used as a template for designing a second pair of
primers (cox1-F; cox1-R). Successful amplifications were
associated with the primer combinations: rrnL-F/cox1-R
("A” fragment) and rrnL-R/cox1-F ("B” fragment).
LAPCR reactions were undertaken using GeneAmp XL
PCR kits (Applied Biosystems; N8080193). Typically, 25
μL reactions were set up in two parts separated by a
wax bead following the manufacturer’s recommendations, using a [Mg(OAc)2] of 1.2 mM and an annealing
temperature specific to the primer combination. Typical
conditions consisted of a 94°C denaturation period lasting 60 s, followed by: 16 cycles at 94°C for 25 s, 60°C
for 60 s, and 68°C for 10 min; 18 cycles at 94°C for 25
s, 60°C for 60 s, and 68°C for 12 min; and a final extension period at 72°C for 10 min. Amplifications were run
on a Stratagene Gradient Robocycler. PCR products
were cleaned by separating high molecular weight products from primers and sequencing reagents using Millipore Ultrafree filter columns [7]. Samples were added to
200 μL of sterile water and then spun in a picofuge for
15 min or until the filter membranes were dry. PCR
products were eluted from the membrane in 20 μL of
sterile distilled water, and 5 μL of this product was run
out on a 0.8% agarose gel to confirm the presence of a
band of the appropriate size. Typically, products from
several replicate PCR reactions were pooled prior to
quantitation. Once 3 ng of PCR product had been
obtained, samples were dried down in a vacuum centrifuge and sent to the Joint Genome Institute, Walnut
Creek, CA, where they were sequenced using standard
shotgun sequencing protocols [7,8].
Genome annotation and analysis
Genome annotation

The approximate locations of the rRNA and proteinencoding genes were determined by aligning each unannotated genome with genes from other caenogastropod
mt genomes. The precise boundaries of rRNA genes
could not be determined due to the lack of sequence
similarity at the 5′ and 3′ ends; therefore, the location of
each rRNA gene was assumed to extend from the
boundary of the upstream flanking gene to the boundary
of the downstream flanking gene, as in [41]. A standard
initiation codon was located at the beginning of each
protein-encoding gene (either ATG, ATA, or GTG), and
the derived amino acid sequence was aligned with
homologous protein sequences to ensure that this was a
suitable initiation codon (based on length). When possible, the first proper stop codon (TAG or TAA) downstream of the initiation codon was chosen to terminate
translation; however, to reduce overlap with downstream
genes, abbreviated stop codons (T or TA) were selected

for some genes. In these instances, polyadenylation of
the mRNA was assumed to restore a full TAA stop
codon [7]. Regardless, some genes appeared to overlap
based on the conservation of their open reading frame
sequences and the lack of a potential abbreviated stop
codon. Gene locations and secondary structures of
tRNAs were identified using tRNAscanSE [42] and
ARWEN [43]. On the rare occasion that these programs
did not find all of the expected tRNAs, the remaining
tRNAs were found by eye and folded manually. We produced tRNA drawings manually using Canvas (ACD
Systems). Using cox1 as the conventional starting point
for the four genomes, linear maps of the circular genomes were created to facilitate comparison of gene
orders amongst vermetids, across available caenogastropods, and between caenogastropods and other select
molluscs, including the abalone, Haliotis rubra (Class
Gastropoda,Superorder Vetigastropoda), the octopus,
Octopus vulgaris (Class Cephalopoda), and the chiton,
Katharina tunicata (Class Polyplacophora).
Nucleotide composition

The nucleotide composition of each complete and partial
genome was described by calculating the overall base composition, %AT content, AT-skew, and GC-skew for the
strand encoding cox1, hereafter referred to as the “+”
strand. Base composition and %AT content were determined using MacVector (MacVector, Inc.), and strand
skews (AT skew = (A-T)/(A+T); GC skew = (G-C)/G+C))
were calculated using the formulae of [44]. For complete
genomes, the %AT content, AT-skew, and GC-skew were
also calculated for rRNA genes, protein-encoding genes
(for all bases, third codon positions, and third positions of
four-fold degenerate (4FD) codons, as in [44]), tRNA
genes (separately for those coded for on the “+” and “-”
strand), and intergenic (unassigned) regions. Values were
compared across categories within each genome, and
within categories across genomes. In addition, we explored
the nucleotide composition at third positions of 4FD
codons in relation to the position of each protein-encoding gene within the genome [45]. Gene positions were
determined by calculating the distance (number of nucleotides) from the midpoint of each gene to a reference point
chosen here as the start of nad1.
A base composition plot (%A+C and %G+T along the
length of the genome) was created for each complete
genome using a sliding window of 100 nucleotides.
Typically, the leading strand is G+T rich associated with
its protracted single-stranded state during replication
and transcription; deviations from this pattern can signify switches in the assignments of these strands [41].
Plots were aligned with linear representations of the
matching genome to signify base composition trends for
protein and tRNA genes encoded on the “+” strand,
tRNA genes encoded on the “-” strand, and rRNA genes.

Genetic code

To ensure that all codons were being utilized, codon
usage frequencies were analyzed using MacVector (MacVector, Inc.); unused codons can potentially signal a
change in the genetic code [46]. Codons whose amino
acid identity has changed in the mt genetic code of
other metazoans (e.g. flatworms, echinoderms, and
hemichordates; [47]) were investigated using a procedure similar to [48]: the derived amino acids of five
codons (TGA, ATA, AGA, AGG, AAA) were examined
in the alignment of three highly conserved proteins
(cox1, cox2, and cox3) from the mt genomes of four vermetids, D. gregarium, D. maximum, E. tulipa and
T. squamigerus, and several other caenogastropods.
Within the vermetids, if the derived amino acid from
any of these five codons occurred in a conserved position (present at that location in >50% of caenogastropod
sequences examined) this was scored as a positive result.
Amino acids that occurred in a non-conserved position
(<50%) were scored as negative. The proportion of
appearances in conserved vs. non-conserved locations
was calculated for each codon across the vermetids
examined. High percentages in conserved locations
likely indicate the retention of amino acid identity by
the specific codon [48]; low percentages can be suggestive of a change in amino acid identity, although other
explanations are also possible.
Unassigned regions

As metazoan mt genomes are typically compact with
minimal non-coding DNA [49], unassigned stretches of
nucleotides often contain control elements for transcription or replication or remnants of duplicated protein,
rRNA or tRNA genes. We examined putative noncoding regions (> 20 bp) for gene remnants, repeat
sequences, inverted repeats, palindromes, and secondary
structure features, all of which can be associated with
signaling elements of the mt genome. Protein, rRNA
and tRNA remnants were identified by aligning unassigned regions with annotated genes from caenogastropod mitochondrial genomes. MEME [50] and M-Fold
[51] were used to identify potential sequence motifs and
structural features, respectively.
tRNA remolding/recruitment

To search for close matches between tRNA genes indicative of gene remolding/recruitment, each tRNA gene
sequence was aligned to tRNA genes from other available caenogastropod genomes (including new vermetid
tRNA sequences). Similarity scores were based on initial
tRNA alignments undertaken in MacVector that were
subsequently adjusted by eye according to secondary
structure features (stems vs. loops). As in [28], the third
base of the anticodon triplet was excluded in the calculation of % similarity between two tRNA genes, but gaps
were counted as mismatches.

Results and Discussion

Genome organization

Caenogastropod mitochondrial genomes

The mitochondrial genomes of D. gregarium, D. maximum, E. tulipa, and T. squamigerus varied in size from
15078 bp to 15641 bp, similar in length to other caenogastropods (range: 15182 - 16648 bp, n = 16) but considerably larger than most heterobranchs (range:
13670 - 14745 bp, n = 13). Each genome contained the
37 genes typical of most animal mitochondrial genomes
(Figure 1; Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5), with all 13 proteinencoding genes and 2 rRNA genes located on the “+”
strand along with either 14 or 15 tRNA genes depending
on the species. In each of the four genomes, the tRNA
genes, trnY, trnM, trnC, trnW, trnQ, trnG, and trnE,
were located on the “-” strand forming a cassette of
7 adjacent tRNAs. The only difference across genomes
in the strand specific coding of a gene was for trnT,
which was located on the “+” strand of E. tulipa, but on
the “-” strand of D. gregarium, D. maximum, and
T. squamigerus. The tendency for protein and rRNA
genes to be coded for on the same strand has been
found in all caenogastropod taxa examined so far, but
this is atypical for molluscs (excluding bivalves) and
other metazoan mt genomes described to date (137 of
1428 genomes as of Dec 17, 2008; [54]). The predominance of this single-strand-dependence for protein and
rRNA genes among sponges and cnidarians has led to
the proposition that this is the plesiomorphic metazoan
condition [54].
The tRNA genes identified within each genome and
their secondary structures are presented as additional
files (see Additional file 1, Figure S1; Additional file 2,
Figure S2; Additional file 3, Figure S3; Additional file 4,
Figure S4; Additional file 5, Figure S5; Additional file 6,
Figure S6). Extra tRNA genes were found in two vermetid genomes. D. gregarium had a second trnK located
between genes trnI and nad3 (see Figure 1). This second
trnK can be folded in to a typical tRNA cloverleaf structure (see Additional file 2, Figure S2), and thus may be
functional. The genome of T. squamigerus also contained additional trnV and trnLUUR genes (see Figure 1).
These genes were associated with two large stretches of
unassigned sequence positioned between the two copies
of trnV (see below).
Overlapping adjacent genes were common in vermetid
mt genomes. Two pairs of protein-encoding genes overlapped in all four species (atp8 and atp6; nad4L and
nad4); overlap of nad4L and nad4 was also evident in the
partial genome of Thylaeodus. These gene pairs commonly overlap in animal mt genomes. This phenomenon
was more variable between tRNA genes (see Tables 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 and 7 for specific examples). In addition, in three
instances tRNA genes overlapped with protein-encoding
genes (trnH and nad4 in E. tulipa; trnSAGN with cox3 and
trnR with nad2 in T. squamigerus). Similar comparisons

To date, comparisons across published caenogastropod mt genomes have suggested a model of gene
order conservation unusual for the Gastropoda
[15,48,52,53]. Among the 16 complete caenogastropod
genomes available at NCBI as of January 8, 2010,
gene order rearrangements within this clade appear
minor, involving only changes in position of trnLUUR,
trnL CUN , trnV and trnS2, and an inversion of trnT
([53]). Likewise, only two rearrangements, one inversion and one transposition, separate the reconstructed
ancestral gastropod gene order from that of most caenogastropods [15,53]. While this conservation in gene
order within the Caenogastropoda may be real, it
could also reflect a strong sampling bias for members
of the Neogastropoda (12 complete genomes) - a largely Cenozoic radiation of predatory snails - with
only four complete genomes from two genera (Cymatium and Oncomelania), examined from other caenogastropod groups. In contrast, wider sampling of mt
gene orders within the Heterobranchia, a sister clade
to the Caenogastropoda, has demonstrated highly
dynamic mt genomes [15]. Of 13 genomes sampled
across a disparate array of taxa, including 5 opisthobranchs (including an unpublished Elysia genome), 7
pulmonates (including a second Biomphalaria genome
not included in [15]), and 1 basal heterobranch [15],
numerous changes in gene order have been observed,
with few mt gene boundaries shared between heterobranchs and the hypothetical ancestral gastropod mt
genome inferred by [15].
Here, based on a detailed sampling of mt genomes
within one family of caenogastropods outside the Neogastropoda, we provide a new and very different picture
of gene order dynamics within the Caenogastropoda.
Our results increase the number of caenogastropod mt
genomes sequenced to 20, substantially increase the
sampling of mt genomes outside the Neogastropoda,
and present the first direct evidence of major gene order
rearrangements within the Littorinimorpha based on
complete genome sequences. Full mt genomes were successfully sequenced for the vermetids, Dendropoma gregarium, D. maximum, Eualetes tulipa, and Thylacodes
squamigerus (Figure 1; Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5). Amplifications of the “B” fragment (cox1-F/rrnL-R) were not successful for Thylaeodus sp. and V. erectus and
consequently only partial mt genomes are described for
these two taxa (Figure 1; Tables 6 and 7). Nevertheless,
extensive gene rearrangements were evident within
these species compared to other vermetids and caenogastropods. Characterization of the vermetid mt genomes presented below is based only on the four
complete genomes, except where noted otherwise.

labeled according to their standard abbreviations. For tRNA genes, green circles represent those genes located on the “+” strand and white
circles those located on the “-” strand. Regions of unassigned nucleotides (presumed non-coding sequences) are not identified on these maps.
As is the standard convention for metazoan mt genomes, cox1 has been designated the start point for the “+” strand. The asterisks (*) in
D. maximum and T. squamigerus denote stretches of sequences (presumed pseudogenes) with high similarity to portions of complete genes. For
exact locations of each gene, as well as unassigned regions, see Tables 2-7.

Gene initiation and termination

Nearly all protein-encoding genes (58/61) were initiated
by the canonical ATG start codon, although ATA
(twice) and GTG (once) also acted as start codons

(Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). These start codons are not
unusual in molluscan mt genomes, but their usage, as
found elsewhere, appears to be much less frequent than
ATG [7] (but see [15]). TAG was the most common termination codon (28/59), but TAA (15/59) and abbreviated stop codons (a single T or TA terminating the
open reading frame; 16/59) were used slightly more

frequently when considered together. The sequences for

incomplete so the termination codons for these genes

Unassigned regions

The number of nucleotides unassignable to any gene
ranged from 289 (1.9% of the genome) in Eualetes
tulipa to 625 (4.0% of the genome) in Thylacodes

squamigerus (Table 8). No unassigned stretch of
sequence was greater than 270 bp in length, although
intergenic regions ranging in size from 10 - 99 bp were
common (Table 8). There was little consistency in size
and position of unassigned regions across genomes, with
the position of the largest region found in different
areas for each species. Short (≤ 15 bp) AT-rich (>80%)
intergenic regions were evident within the genomes of

Dendropoma maximum, D. gregarium, and T. squamigerus, but not in E. tulipa (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5), and
again, the position of these sequences varied across taxa.
Stretches of unassigned sequence including inverted
repetitive elements are known to reside between trnF
and cox3 in the mt genomes of several caenogastropods,
likely representing the control region for replication and
transcription in these genomes [52,53]. In our comparisons across the four complete vermetid genomes, we

were unable to identify any similar regions associated
with repetitive sequence motifs or palindromes. As is
common in mt genomes, however, secondary structure
elements were found by MFOLD within many of these
intergenic regions, suggestive of a role in post-transcriptional modification of the polycistronic transcript.
Our analyses did uncover several interesting features
within large intergenic regions of Dendropoma
maximum and Thylacodes squamigerus (Figure 1). In

D. maximum, we identified a 121 bp stretch within an
unassigned region of 167 bp between trnR and trnY that
was a perfect match to the reverse complement of a
portion of rrnS. Likewise, in Thylacodes squamigerus, in
an unassigned region between trnV 1 and trnLCUN , we
found a 140 bp stretch of sequence that was identical to
a corresponding portion of rrnL. In addition, between
trnLCUN and trnV2, we discovered a 120 bp remnant of
nad1 (82% identical, with a 91 bp stretch differing only
in 6 bases) and a 114 bp remnant of rrnS (92% identical). These pseudogene fragments in Thylacodes, as well
as the extra tRNAs (trnV and trnLUUR) present in this
region, are likely the result of a duplication event spanning rrnS-trnV-rrnL-trnLUUR-trnLCUN-nad1, with subsequent overwriting of some gene duplicates (Rawlings
et al., in prep).
Nucleotide composition and skews

All four vermetid genomes were AT-rich, with these two
nucleotides accounting for 59 - 62% of the genome
(Figure 2; Additional file 7, Table S1); this trend was
consistent across regions of each genome associated
with protein-encoding genes, rRNA genes, tRNAs, and
non-coding regions. Interestingly, however, the ATbiases of vermetid genomes were noticeably lower than
those reported for other complete caenogastropod
genomes (range: 65.2-70.1%, n = 14; Additional file 7,
Table S1). Likewise, AT content was only moderately
higher at third-codon positions and 4FD sites of protein-encoding genes, a result unusual in comparison
with many other protostomes where %AT can often
exceed >80% at 4FD sites [44]. Skew analyses revealed
that the “+” strand was strongly biased against A (ATskew ranging from -0.148 to -0.238) and towards G
(GC-skew ranging from +0.065 to +0.251). This pattern
was similar to other caenogastropods (Additional file 7,
Table S1), heterobranchs [15], and the chiton, Katharina tunicata [55], but opposite to that found on the “+”
strand of the abalone Haliotis [56] and the cephalopods,
Nautilus and Octopus, suggestive of switches in the
assignments of leading and lagging strands within the
Mollusca [41].
Skew patterns were different between regions of the
genome depending on their function. For AT-skews, the
most strongly biased areas were found associated with
protein-encoding genes, but these were not necessarily
most pronounced at third positions or at 4FD sites
(except for D. maximum; Figure 2). The two rRNA
genes showed a marked difference from protein-encoding genes, with a slight positive AT-skew, on average.
Differences in skew patterns between rRNA and protein-encoding genes have been noted elsewhere [41,57],
and may reflect base-pairing constraints associated with
the secondary structures of these rRNAs [41]. Unassigned regions, assumed to be non-coding, were

Page 13 of 24

expected to experience similar selective pressures to
those of 4FD third codon positions; this correspondence
was not strong, however, with unassigned regions showing variation in AT-bias across taxa from slight positive
AT-skews to moderate negative skews. tRNA genes
regardless of whether they were coded for on the “+” or
“-” strand exhibited no consistent skew patterns, with an
average close to zero.
GC-skews were moderately positive for most regions
of the genome, including protein-encoding genes, rRNA
genes, unassigned regions, and tRNAs encoded on the
“+” strand. Skews were particularly strong, however, for
the third codon positions and 4FD third codon positions
in Dendropoma maximum and Eualetes tulipa. On average, neutral to negative GC-skews were associated with
regions of the “+” strand associated with tRNA genes
encoded on the “-” strand.
As predicted by skew patterns described above, G+T
composition varied across the length of the “+” strand
in all four complete genomes (Figure 3). Areas of weak
or no G+T bias were typically associated with rRNAs
and regions with tRNAs encoded on the “-” strand. Dendropoma maximum exhibited a particularly strong bias
for G+T (>65%) in the region from 10,000 to 14,000 bp.
Codon frequency

No evidence was found of changes to the standard
genetic code employed by other molluscs (Additional
file 8, Table S2). Each codon was used multiple times in
the protein-encoding genes of each species (Additional
file 9, Table S3), however, codon usage frequencies were
not equal. Codon usage strongly reflected skew patterns
at the third position for synonymous codons (both twofold and four-fold degenerate codons; see Additional file
9, Table S3): the most abundant base at the third codon
position across all four complete genomes was T (36.743.1%) and the least abundant base was C (9.4-17.9%).
The relative ranking of G (18.5-26.5%) and of A (21.029.8%), however, was less consistent across genomes.
Putative origins of replication

Locating the regions of the mt genomes associated with
the replication origins (ORs, also known as control
regions or A+T rich regions) for both “+” and “-”
strands can be challenging based on a knowledge of the
nucleotide sequence of mt genomes alone. Recognition
elements can be in the form of conserved sequence
blocks, regions rich in A+T, stable stem-loop structures
containing T-rich loops, or repetitive elements/palindromes [58]. ORs can also be identified by association
with rearrangement “hotspots” [23]. Such features are
not definitive evidence, however, and can differ in utility
across taxonomic groups. For instance, only 35% of tentatively identified molluscan control regions have been
found to have palindromes and the average %AT content of these regions is in the range of 65-70%, close to

Figure 2 Nucleotide composition of four complete vermetid genomes. For each species, the %AT content, AT-skew, and GC-skew are
shown for the “+” strand of the complete genome and its functional components, including: protein-encoding genes (complete protein, 3rd
codon positions only, and 3rd positions of 4-fold degenerate (4FD) codons only), rRNA genes, unassigned regions (UR), and tRNA genes
(including “+” and “-” strand encoded genes). Error bars refer to standard errors based on a sample size from each genome of: 13 protein
encoding genes, 14 -15 “+” strand tRNA genes, and 7-8 “-” strand tRNA genes.

Rawlings et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:440
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/440

the average genomic %AT content for molluscs (based
on 9 molluscan genomes analyzed) [59]. Consequently,
looking for palindromes or A+T rich regions may not
be helpful in identifying the OR of molluscs. In contrast,
85% of insect control regions have palindromes and CR
regions are associated with >80% AT [59].
Because none of the recognition elements described
above were useful in locating putative ORs within the
complete genomes of the four vermetids examined here,
we attempted to locate ORs by examining the relationship between nucleotide composition and the position
of protein-encoding genes within these genomes. Reyes
et al. [45] determined that the AT and GC-skews at
4FD sites of protein-encoding genes of 25 mammalian
mt genomes were significantly correlated with the duration of single stranded state of heavy-strand genes during replication, with increased duration reflecting, in
part, the proximity of protein encoding genes to the origin of replication of the heavy strand (ORH), as well as
their position relative to the OR of the light strand
(ORL). Longer durations in the single stranded condition
increase the vulnerability of DNAs to hydrolytic and
oxidative damage creating the compositional asymmetries between the heavy and light strands (or leading
and lagging strands). In vertebrates, the ORL is typically
located two-thirds of the way around the genome from
the ORH. In insects, the only protostomes examined in
detail, however, the replication origins for both strands
(leading and lagging) appear to be in close proximity,
near the ends of a conserved block within the A+T rich
region, with the lagging strand beginning after 95% of
the leading strand has been replicated [60]. Comparative
studies are lacking for molluscs.
If the ORs for both strands are located close to one
another in molluscs, then examining nucleotide composition in relation to the position of each protein-encoding gene could reveal putative sites for the OR. We
tested this by plotting nucleotide composition at 4FD
third codon positions as in [45] versus the midpoint
position of each protein-encoding gene (Figure 4). By
moving the putative OR between different proteinencoding genes, we found a compelling linear relationship, with a negative slope for %T and %G and a positive slope for %A and %C, when we positioned the OR
between nad2 and nad1 (or between nad2 and nad6 for
D. gregarium). This region generally encompasses the
cassette of 7 tRNA genes encoded on the “-” strand, two
rRNA genes, as well as additional tRNAs, albeit with
some notable differences amongst taxa (Figure 1). This
relationship is shown based on averaged values across
all four complete vermetid genomes (Figure 4: diamonds), and separately for the genome of Dendropoma
maximum (Figure 4: squares) which exhibited the strongest pattern across all four taxa. Reyes et al. [45] found

Page 15 of 24

an increase in the frequency of A and C at 4FD sites in
the light (sense) strand in direct relation to the singlestranded duration of the heavy strand. They speculated
that this was the result of spontaneous deamination of
adenine into hypoxanthine, which base pairs with C
rather than T, and cytosine into uracil, which base pairs
with A rather than G, along the heavy strand during its
single-stranded state in replication (with associated
increases in nucleotides A and C in the light, sense
strand). In vermetid genomes, where genes are encoded
on the opposite strand to vertebrates (i.e. the heavy
strand is the sense or “+” strand for all vermetid protein-encoding genes, see Figure 3), genes with lower frequencies of G and T (or higher frequencies of C and A)
at 4FD sites should be those experiencing shorter durations in the single-stranded condition. The marked difference in nucleotide composition of 4FD sites between
nad2 (low %G and %T) and nad1 (high %G and %T) is
thus suggestive of substantial differences in exposure of
these two genes to the single-stranded condition. Consequently, the OR may lie between these two proteinencoding genes. Comparisons of nucleotide composition
patterns along the genomes of protostome taxa with
well defined ORs are now necessary to confirm or refute
the predictive power of such analyses in identifying control regions.
Two other observations support the general location
for the OR between nad2 and nad1. First, this region is
associated with a major change in base compositional
bias reflecting the presence of rRNA genes and a cassette of tRNAs encoded on the “-” strand (Figure 3).
Such changes are thought to be associated with ORs
[41,58]. Second, this region of the mt genome appears
to be involved in a number of gene order rearrangements, possibly reflecting a rearrangement “hotspot”
(see Gene order rearrangements, below). Hotspots have
been associated with ORs in previous studies [23]. In
many other caenogastropods, however, ORs have been
tentatively identified in a different region of the genome,
despite the presence of a similar cassette of tRNA genes
located on the “-” strand [48,52,53]. In these taxa, the
OR is thought to be present between trnF and coxIII
within an unassigned stretch of sequence of variable
length (from 15 - 848 bp) associated with inverted
repeats and secondary structure elements. This gene
boundary is not present in the Vermetidae. Direct examination of mRNAs is now needed to demonstrate conclusively the presence of ORs within vermetid and other
caenogastropod mt genomes.
Gene order rearrangements

Each of the vermetid genomes examined here possessed
a unique gene arrangement (Figure 5). The four complete vermetid genomes differed primarily in the

highlighting regions corresponding to the presence of: 1) protein encoding genes and tRNA genes encoded on the “+” strand, 2) rRNA genes
encoded on the “+” strand, and 3) tRNA genes encoded on the “-” strand. See [41] for a comparison with Nautilus and Katharina. As is the
standard convention for metazoan mt genomes, cox1 has been designated the start point for the “+” strand.

position of tRNA genes, the most mobile elements
within the mt genome [16]. While the position of many
tRNA genes was conserved, the location of trnA, trnK,
trnP, trnT, trnLCUN, trnLUUR, and trnV was more variable across the four genomes. Only D. gregarium differed in the order of protein-encoding genes, with nad6

changing position relative to other protein encoding and
rRNA genes, as described in [18]. The two partial genomes of Vermetus erectus and Thylaeodus sp. provided
additional evidence of the extent of gene rearrangement
within this family, however, with novel arrangements
both tRNA and protein-encoding genes.

Figure 4 Variation in nucleotide composition at 4FD sites of protein-coding genes in relation to the position of each gene within the
genome. Data are presented for: 1) the mean of all four vermetid genomes (diamonds) and 2) Dendropoma maximum alone (squares). The
position of each protein encoding gene was calculated as the number of nucleotides from the beginning of nad1 (or nad6 for D. gregarium) to
the midpoint of the target gene. This different start point for D. gregarium was based on the derived translocation of nad6 to a position directly
upstream from nad1 in this taxon [18]. Regression equations are as follows. All four genomes: Y = -2.92 × 10-4 X + 40.20, r2 = 0.21[%T]; Y = 2.59
× 10-4 X + 24.47, r2 = 0.18 [%A]; Y = 4.84 × 10-4 X + 10.60, r2 = 0.79 [%C]; Y = -4.51 × 10-4 X + 24.73, r2 = 0.56 [%G]; D. maximum alone: Y =
-2.45 × 10-4 X + 44.22, r2 = 0.07 [%T]; Y = 8.66 × 10-4 X + 15.47, r2 = 0.78 [%A]; Y = 4.83 × 10-4 X + 6.63, r2 = 0.55 [%C]; Y = -1.10 × 10-3 X +
33.67, r2 = 0.65 [%G].

Given the extent of shared gene boundaries with
representatives of other molluscan classes, Grande et al.
[15] have suggested that the mt genome of the abalone,
Haliotis rubra [56], represents the ancestral gene order
of gastropods, albeit with two derived changes. The
position of trnD and trnN are likely autapomorphies of
Haliotis, since many caenogastropods share a different
(and presumed ancestral) position for trnD with Octopus
and trnN with Octopus and Katharina (Figure 5). Based
on this inferred plesiomorphic gastropod condition, vermetids exhibit a number of derived gene order changes,
some of which are shared with other caenogastropods.
All published caenogastropod mt genomes, and the four
complete vermetid genomes examined here, share an
inversion of a block of 23 genes spanning from trnF to
trnE in Haliotis, with a reversion (to the original strand)
of genes spanning trnM to trnE within this block. As
discussed by [48], this rearrangement must have

occurred before the divergence of caenogastropods, but
after their separation from the Vetigastropoda (Haliotis).
Vermetid mt genomes also shared an interesting gene
order change with two other members of the superfamily Littorinimorpha, Littorina saxatilis and Oncomelania
hupensis, associated with the position of the two leucine
tRNA genes, trnLUUR and trnL CUN (Figure 5). Within
the mt genome of Haliotis, Octopus, and Katharina,
these two leucine tRNAs are sandwiched between rrnL
and nad1 in the following arrangement: rrnL-trnLCUNtrnL UUR -nad1. This gene order is retained in all
caenogastropod mt genomes sampled to date, except for
Littorina, Oncomelania, Dendropoma maximum,
D. gregarium, and Vermetus erectus, where the relative
position of these two genes has switched, such that
trnL UUR is located directly upstream from trnL CUN .
(Note: this gene order is incorrectly annotated in [48]
(pg 40), and this gene order change is not recognized in

based on revised annotations listed in MitoZoa [63]. Abbreviations are as follows. GAST: Class Gastropoda; POLY: Class Polyplacophora; CEPH:
Class Cephalopoda; CA: Caenogastropoda; Li: Littorinimorpha; Ne: Neogastropoda; VE: Vetigastropoda.

[15](page 11) or [53](page 4), where it is stated that
there are no differences in gene order between the
partial genome of Littorina and complete genome of
neogastropods). This difference in the order of these
two tRNAs is also present in several other vermetid taxa
(data not shown), but is not present in two additional
members of the Littorinimorpha: Cymatium parthenopeum and Calyptraea chinensis [53]. While this shared
gene rearrangement may be a synapomorphy defining a
clade within the Littorinimorpha to which the Littorinidae (Littorina), Pomatiopsidae (Oncomelania) and Vermetidae belong, changes in tRNA positions involving

neighbouring leucine tRNA genes should be treated
with caution. Gene translocations among neighbouring
genes appear to occur with increased frequency in mt
genomes and thus may be more likely to arise independently [23]. Such “position switches” between neighbours may therefore be less reliable phylogenetic
characters for addressing deeper level phylogenetic questions. In addition, simple changes in position of these
two leucine tRNA genes can mask more complicated
dynamics that may involve gene duplications and tRNA
remolding events [28] (see Evidence for tRNA remolding
and recruitment, below). Uncovering the dynamics that

Rawlings et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:440
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/440

have occurred within this region of the genome can be
essential to interpreting gene identity correctly and
accurately reconstructing past gene rearrangement
events. The discovery of two trnLUUR genes side by side
between rrnL and nad1 of Thylacodes squamigerus
further suggests that such tRNA remolding events may
be at play within vermetid mt genomes.
Some gene order arrangements were unique to the
Vermetidae (Figure 5). All four complete vermetid genomes shared a block of three protein-encoding genes
and 3 - 4 tRNA genes: trnN-nad5-trnK-trnA-cox3-trnS1nad2, with trnA and trnK absent from this block in
Eualetes and D. gregarium, respectively. This gene rearrangement was associated with the movement of nad5
from its conserved position between trnF and trnH in
Katharina, Octopus, Haliotis, and other caenogastropods, and with the break-up of cox3, trnS1, and nad2
from their conserved association within a block of genes
including cox3 - 5 tRNAs - nad3 - trnS1 - nad2 in these
same taxa. TrnD also shared a unique derived position
between cox1 and atp8 in the Vermetidae. While trnD
in Haliotis has differing neighbouring genes, the gene
order cox1-trnD is shared with the chiton, Katharina,
and trnD-atp8 is shared with Octopus, as well as all
other caenogastropods. The derived vermetid arrangement thus appears to be associated with a switch in the
position of cox2 relative to cox1, trnD, and atp8, along a
lineage leading to the Vermetidae. In addition, the vermetids also shared a derived change in the relative positions of trnY and trnM within the cassette of 7 tRNA
genes encoded on the “-” strand. Such distinctions
between the mt genome of vermetids and other littorinimorphs are particularly relevant here given that there is
both molecular and morphological support for the
inclusion of littorines and vermetids in a clade of lower
caenogastropods [28,37,38]. Gene rearrangements shared
by vermetids to the exclusion of other Littorinimorpha
(Littorina, Oncomelania, Calyptraea, and Cymatium),
thus can be inferred to have occurred following the
divergence of the ancestral vermetid from the common
ancestor of these taxa.
Numerous gene order changes have also occurred
within the family Vermetidae (Figure 5). The Vermetidae has a fossil record extending to the Late Cretaceous,
suggesting that this gene reshuffling has happened
within the past 65 million years, and based on molecular
dating, perhaps within the past 38 million years [18].
Preliminary evidence suggests that the mt genome of
Dendropoma maximum represents the ancestral gene
order of the Vermetidae. The translocation of trnK1 and
trnP-nad6 found in Dendropoma gregarium has also
been shown to be a derived gene order change within
this genus [18]. Relative to D. maximum, most gene
rearrangements evident in the three other complete

Page 19 of 24

genomes have occurred between trnR and trnT. Eualetes
differs from D. maximum in the position of four tRNAs:
trnA, trnP, trnL UUR and trnT, with gene remolding
events between trnLCUN and trnLUUR likely associated
with gene order changes involving these two isoaccepting tRNA genes (see Evidence for tRNA remolding and
recruitment, below). Differences between the gene
arrangement of Dendropoma maximum and Thylacodes
appear related to a gene duplication event in Thylacodes
spanning rrnS to nad1, as inferred from gene vestiges of
rrnS, rrnL, and nad1 and extra tRNA genes (trnV,
trnLUUR). Details of this rearrangement will be examined
further in another paper (Rawlings et al. in prep). Many
of the conserved gene boundaries described above for
the four complete vermetid genomes sequenced, even
those shared with other caenogastropods, Haliotis,
Katharina, and Octopus, were not evident in the partial
genomes of V. erectus and Thylaeodus (Figures 1 &5).
The scale of these rearrangements is impressive given
that these changes have happened within a family of
gastropods, and suggests that further sampling of the
Vermetidae should uncover more changes and perhaps
intermediate stages that may reveal the dynamics underlying the gene rearrangements shown here. The genome
of Thylacodes squamigerus provides hope of this as vestiges of once functional genes discovered between annotated genes are helping to understand the mechanism of
gene order change and the appearance of duplicated
tRNAs. This expectation has also been borne out by
additional data collected as part of a phylogenetic analysis of the Vermetidae: numerous gene order changes
have now been uncovered within vermetid taxa based
on short sequences (<3.5 kb) extending from rrnS to
nad1 (Rawlings et al., in prep; data not shown). With
further sampling of the Vermetidae, we anticipate that
these gene order rearrangements will provide a suite of
robust characters that can be used, in addition to morphological and nucleotide sequence characters, to build
a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis for this family
and to firmly place the Vermetidae within the context
of caenogastropod evolution.
Evidence for tRNA remolding and recruitment

Implicit in the use of secondary structure characteristics
and anticodon triplets to recognize tRNAs is the
assumption that tRNA genes cannot change identity by
simple nucleotide substitutions in their anticodon. For
the most part this seems to be true within animal mt
genomes, likely because of the presence of specific
recognition elements that are required by tRNA synthetases to identify and correctly charge their associated
tRNAs. However, evidence is accumulating that tRNAs
do occasionally change identities. Through a process
known as tRNA remolding, identity change does occur

Rawlings et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:440
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/440

between the two isoaccepting leucine tRNA genes
[25,26,28] and possibly also between the two isoaccepting serine tRNA genes [61]. Cases of tRNA identity
change across non-isoaccepting tRNAs, referred to as
tRNA recruitment, are now also coming to light [27].
The strongest evidence of tRNA remolding is the discovery of unexpectedly high levels of sequence similarity
between two tRNA leucine genes [28]. Consequently,
these dynamics are most easily recognized when they
have happened recently, before mutational changes can
obscure the common history of the duplicated tRNAs.
Although gene remolding and recruitment events are
often associated with changes in gene order, the pattern
of duplicate loss may result in maintenance of the original gene order. In fact, recognizing gene remolding
events can often help to uncover genome dynamics that
are hidden at the level of gene order alone [28].
Given that leucine tRNAs seem particularly susceptible to remolding events [26,28], we investigated the
sequence similarity between both leucine tRNAs within
each vermetid taxon as well as other select caenogastropods, Haliotis, Octopus, and Katharina (Table 9). High
sequence similarities (80% or greater) between leucine
tRNA genes were found in five taxa (Table 9) suggesting
that one tRNA has taken over the role of the other
through a process of gene duplication, mutation in the
anticodon triplet and the eventual loss of the original
gene [26,28]. The T. squamigerus genome represents a
particularly interesting case of this. Within this genome,
the two copies of LUUR only share 67.6% sequence identity; in comparison there is 98.4% sequence similarity
between trnLCUN and trnLUUR2. Consequently, we can
assume that trnLUUR2 is a duplicated copy of trnLCUN
that has subsequently undergone a mutation in the third
position of the anticodon to assume the identity of
trnLUUR. Such events argue for the exclusion of tRNA
leucine genes in gene-order based phylogenetic analyses
at high taxonomic levels; at low taxonomic levels, such
as within the Vermetidae, however, they offer the promise of new phylogenetic characters and the discovery
of gene dynamics that may not be evident at the level of
gene order alone. Given the importance of identifying
remolding events, it is surprising that so little attention
is often paid to the dynamics of these two leucine tRNA
genes. Failure to distinguish between these two genes
correctly can also lead to mistakes in interpretation,
where two genomes are considered to have identical
gene orders, but differ in the position of these two leucine tRNAs (see comparisons between Littorina saxatilis
and other caenogastropods in [15,48,53]).
The presence of a second trnK within the genome of
Dendropoma gregarium is suggestive of a past duplication event within this genome, likely the result of
slipped-strand mispairing during replication. The

Conclusions
Here we have presented gene order and sequence characteristics for six gastropods within the family Vermetidae, including the complete mt genomes of four species
(Dendropoma maximum, D. gregarium, Eualetes tulipa,
and Thylacodes squamigerus) and the partial mt genomes of two others (Vermetus erectus and Thylaeodus
sp.). The publication of these genomes increases the
number of complete caenogastropod mt genomes
sequenced from 16 to 20 and presents the first direct

evidence of major gene order rearrangements within the
Littorinimorpha.
While molluscs have long been recognized as having
unusually dynamic mt genomes, preliminary sampling of
the Caenogastropoda represented by genomes from 16
species has suggested a model of highly conserved mt
gene order. Our results reverse this trend and provide
further evidence of the lability of the molluscan mt genome by describing extensive gene order changes that
have occurred within one family of caenogastropod molluscs, the Vermetidae. Based on these results, we anticipate that the mt genomes of caenogastropods exhibit a
variety of gene order arrangements, which, if explored
and exploited, could provide a wealth of phylogeneticallyinformative characters to enhance our understanding of

Rawlings et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:440
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/440

the evolutionary radiation of this diverse clade of
gastropods.
Despite the extent of mt gene rearrangement within
the Vermetidae, their genomes exhibit similar characteristics to other caenogastropods. Each complete genome
contained the full complement of 37 genes, although
additional tRNA genes were evident in the mt genomes
of D. gregarium (trnK) and Thylacodes squamigerus
(trnV, trnLUUR). Protein-encoding and rRNA genes were
all encoded on the same strand (i.e. the “+” strand), not
unusual for caenogastropods, whereas tRNA genes, the
most mobile mt genomic components, were distributed
between the “+” and “-” strands. Nucleotide skews patterns (i.e. AT and GC-skews) of vermetid genomes and
their various components were similar to those
described for other caenogastropods, although the AT
bias was less pronounced than other caenogastropods
described to date. Although no control regions were
definitively identified, a compelling trend in the relationship between nucleotide composition and position from
nad1 was uncovered, which appears worthy of further
investigation.
Our results also demonstrate that focused sampling of
mt genomes at low taxonomic levels can be extremely
productive, both in terms of uncovering characters useful in phylogeny and in understanding more fully the
evolutionary dynamics and mechanics of mt gene rearrangements. Each of the six vermetid mt genomes
examined had a unique gene order, with evidence of
gene rearrangements involving translocations of tRNA
and protein-encoding genes, and one gene inversion,
occurring within this family. Additional rearrangements
have also been uncovered amongst other representatives
of this family suggesting that further sampling of complete mt genomes within the Vermetidae will also prove
useful. The extent of gene rearrangement within such
an evolutionarily young group offers the opportunity to
explore gene dynamics such as tRNA remolding, which
appears to have been rife within this family, and to
investigate its consequences for phylogenetic analyses
based on gene orders. The sampling of mt genomes,
such as that of Thylacodes squamigerus, in the intermediate stages of a gene rearrangement, may also help
to illuminate mechanisms of gene translocation and
inversion and to interpret past events that have shaped
an organism’s current mt gene order. Continued studies
of the mt genome dynamics within the Vermetidae will
improve our understanding of this family’s phylogeny,
its phylogenetic placement within the Littorinimorpha,
and the mechanisms and processes that have acted
to shape the mt genomes of this family and other
metazoans.
