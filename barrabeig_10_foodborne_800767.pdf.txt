Abstract
Background: In July 2005 an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred on a residential summer camp in the
province of Barcelona (northeast of Spain). Forty-four people were affected among residents and employees. All of
them had in common a meal at lunch time on 13 July (paella, round of beef and fruit). The aim of this study was
to investigate a foodborne norovirus outbreak that occurred in the residential summer camp and in which the
implication of a food handler was demonstrated by laboratory tests.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was designed. Personal or telephone interview was carried out to collect
demographic, clinical and microbiological data of the exposed people, as well as food consumption in the
suspected lunch. Food handlers of the mentioned summer camp were interviewed.
Ten stool samples were requested from symptomatic exposed residents and the three food handlers that prepared
the suspected food. Stools were tested for bacteries and noroviruses. Norovirus was detected using RT-PCR and
sequence analysis.
Attack rate, relative risks (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the association
between food consumption and disease.
Results: The global attack rate of the outbreak was 55%. The main symptoms were abdominal pain (90%), nausea
(85%), vomiting (70%) and diarrhoea (42.5%). The disease remitted in 24-48 hours. Norovirus was detected in seven
faecal samples, one of them was from an asymptomatic food handler who had not eaten the suspected food
(round of beef), but cooked and served the lunch. Analysis of the two suspected foods isolated no pathogenic
bacteria and detected no viruses. Molecular analysis showed that the viral strain was the same in ill patients and in
the asymptomatic food handler (genotype GII.2 Melksham-like).
Conclusions: In outbreaks of foodborne disease, the search for viruses in affected patients and all food handlers,
even in those that are asymptomatic, is essential. Health education of food handlers with respect to hand washing
should be promoted.

Background
The consumption of food contaminated by microorganisms is a common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in
developed countries. Historically, bacteria have been the
most-frequent causal agents, although the causal microorganism is not identified on many occasions [1-3].
Norovirus, a member of the Caliciviridae family, is
considered the major cause of acute gastroenteritis in all

age groups worldwide [4]. The majority of human noroviruses can be classified into two genogroups, I (GI) and
II (GII), which are subdivided into genotypes (at least 15
GI and 18 GII). Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that a number of norovirus genotypes circulate in a
variety of settings. Genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) has
been the most prevalent genotype in many countries in
recent years [1,5].
Foods may be contaminated by contact with human
faecal matter at the source [6] or by unhygienic manipulation by a food handler excreting the virus [4], although
this second scenario is probably underestimated because
it is difficult to prove [1].

Unlike bacteria, which multiply very easily, viruses are
very difficult to detect in foods. Therefore, virological
study of stool samples and epidemiological analysis of
patients are the only ways of identifying the outbreak in
the majority of cases. The virus can be excreted in the
absence of symptoms [7], but incorrect manipulation by
a food handler is necessary to produce an outbreak in
which the food handler is involved.
The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of gastroenteritis due to norovirus that occurred in a residential
summer camp in July 2005 and in which the involvement of a food handler was demonstrated.

Methods
On 15 July 2005, an outbreak of infectious gastroenteritis was detected at a residential summer camp in the
province of Barcelona (Catalonia) in the northeast of
Spain. Eighty-nine people were in the summer camp: 72
children aged 9-13 years, 8 monitors, 6 employees and
3 food handlers.
During the night of 14/15 July, fifteen children presented acute gastroenteritis with a predominance of
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The existence of
cases in the community was discarded after consultation
with local physicians.
The water of the summer camp was supplied directly
from the municipal network. The free residual chlorine
level was 0.3 mg/l in samples taken from the summer
camp’s water pipes.
Preparation of the meals consumed was reviewed by
personal interview with the three food handlers who
had prepared them. One food handler (FH A) presented
symptoms of acute gastroenteritis around 16.30 hours
on 14 July, while the other two (FH B and C) were
asymptomatic. No family members of the food handlers
were affected.
The initial interview showed that the only meal eaten
by all persons affected was lunch on 13 July, which consisted of paella, round of beef and fruit. Two (FH A and
B) of the three food handlers had consumed some of
the suspected food: one had gastrointestinal symptoms
(FH A) and the other was asymptomatic (FH B). The
third (FH C) ate at her home.
Epidemiological investigation

It was hypothesized that the outbreak of gastroenteritis
was foodborne and a retrospective cohort study was
designed to verify the hypothesis.
An exposed person was defined as someone who ate
paella and/or round of beef for lunch on 13 July at the
summer camp; fresh fruit was not considered suspicious
as it was peeled by each consumer. A case was defined
as an exposed person who presented vomiting or

Page 2 of 7

diarrhoea (three or more loose stools within 24 h) and
at least two of the following symptoms: nausea, abdominal pain or fever measured by thermometer (≥37.8°C).
Personal or telephone interview was carried out to
collect information on: 1. individual demographic characteristics such as sex, age, occupation; 2. suspected
food consumed at lunch, 3. if ill, type, data of onset of
symptoms, clinical course of the disease and family
history of acute gastroenteritis.
Laboratory investigation

Stool samples were requested from symptomatic
exposed persons and the three food handlers.
Stool cultures were carried out to isolate enteropathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, Campylobacter, Aeromonas and Shiga toxin-producing strains of
Escherichia coli). Noroviruses were detected by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RT-PCR: Primers designed for partial RNA polymerase region (ORF1) amplification were used: NVp110 (5′ACD ATY TCA TCA TCA CCA TA-3′) for reverse
transcription and JV12 (5′-ATA CCA CTA TGA TGC
AGA TTA-3′) and JV13 (5′-TCA TCA TCA CCA TGA
AAA GAC-3′) for PCR. Norovirus genotyping was performed by sequencing the 326-nucleotide amplimers
with the JV12 and JV13 primers. Prior to phylogenetic
analyses, translated amino acid sequences were aligned
using the Clustal-X program with the default parameters. Using this alignment as a template, nucleotide
sequences were aligned with the GeneDoc program.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the UPGMA
clustering method of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA version 3.1).
A sample of each of the two suspected foods from the
lunch on 13 July (paella and round of beef) was sent to
the laboratory for analysis.
The data in this study is the result of the epidemiological and virological investigation performed by the
Department of Health’s corresponding to the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of the Costa de Ponent region
where the outbreak took place. Basic data (type of outbreak, date of outbreak onset, number of affected, attack
rate, confirmed agent responsible for the outbreak, food
vehicle) are publically available in the Outbreak summary
issue of the Epidemiological Butlletin of Catalonia (BEC)
[8]. This investigation was exempted from the ethical
committee approval because was part of the interventions
of the national public health to control outbreaks.
Statistical Analysis

Proportions were compared using the c2 test or Fisher’s
exact test (when indicated). Means were compared
using the Student’s t test. The level of statistical significance was established as an alpha error of 0.05.

Relative risks (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated to assess the association between
food consumption and disease.
Data collected were analyzed using Microsoft Access
and the statistical analysis was made with the Epidat
and SPSS/PC v.15 statistical packages.

Results
Of the 85 people exposed to lunch on 13 July 2005, 80
were interviewed: 67 children (5 children exposed could
not be located), 8 monitors and 5 camp workers, including two of the food handlers (FH A and B).
Forty-four people fulfilled the case definition, with a
median age of 11 years (range: 9 - 50 years): 29 (66%) were
male. The global attack rate was 55% (44/80), and was
48.5% in females and 59.2% in males, with no differences
according to age and sex. The onset of symptoms for children, monitors and camp workers occurred between 14
and 17 July 2005, with a peak on 14 July (59% of cases).
The epidemic curve of the first 42 cases corresponded
to a single, one-time exposure. When the incubation
period of norovirus was considered and the minimum
incubation period (10 hours) was subtracted from the
first cases and the maximum period (50 hours) from the
cases on the 15 July, this showed that the suspected
exposure was the lunch on 13 July (Figure 1).
The incubation period of the first cases, considering the
day and hour of the suspected exposure (14.00 hours

Page 3 of 7

on 13 July), was 25-44.5 hours (mean: 32 hours), which
was compatible with norovirus. If the source of infection
of the two last cases was the suspected food, the incubation period would be 78 and 83 hours, respectively; however these cases were probably due to person-to-person
transmission, and so were excluded from the food exposure analysis.
For all cases, the main symptoms were abdominal pain
(90%), nausea (85%), vomiting (70%) and diarrhoea
(42.5%). Of cases with fever (27.5%), none had a temperature >38°C. No difference was observed in the clinical pattern according to gender. No case required
hospital admission. The disease remitted in 24-48 hours.
In the ten stool samples analyzed (nine children and
one monitor), no bacterial enteropathogens were found,
but norovirus was detected by RT-PCR in six samples.
Norovirus was also detected in one food handler (FH B),
who had no gastroenteritis.
Of the two food handlers exposed to the suspected
foods, FH A had eaten round of beef and presented clinical symptoms around 16.30 hours on 14 July (Figure 1).
FH B had only eaten paella and did not present symptoms. When re-surveyed, FH B stated that there had
been no cases of gastroenteritis in her family and there
were no symptoms of gastroenteritis two months before
or after the suspected lunch.
The norovirus strain implicated in the outbreak was
identified as genotype GGII.2 Melksham-like by

sequencing a portion of the RNA polymerase gene of
the viral RNA extracted from specimens from patients
and the food handler B (Figure 2).
In the analysis of the two suspected food, pathogenic
bacteria was not isolated and virus were not detected.
Of the foods implicated, 73 people ate paella, 38 of
whom became ill (attack rate: 52%) and 76 people ate
round of beef, 42 of whom became ill (attack rate:
55.3%). Statistical analysis of the two suspected foods
showed that neither was significantly associated with the
disease (Table 1).

Discussion
The epidemiological and clinical features identified
(symptoms, incubation period, disease duration),
together with the laboratory results, were consistent
with the initial hypothesis of a foodborne norovirus outbreak, fulfilling Kaplan criteria [9].

As in other outbreaks [10], the statistical analysis did
not establish any food as the vehicle of infection,
because almost all diners had eaten all the foods. However, two facts suggest that the food vehicle was probably the round of beef (Table 1). Firstly, everyone with
symptoms of gastroenteritis had eaten round of beef
(both paella and round of beef or only beef). Secondly,
the four people who became ill after eating beef but
not paella were: a child in whom norovirus was
detected, the symptomatic food hander (FH A) and
two children from whom clinical samples could not be
obtained.
Although laboratory analysis of the suspected foods
did not find norovirus, this in no way discards the possible implication of the round of beef, since it is known
that, in foods other than shellfish, the sensitivity of the
analysis is very low due to the low levels of the virus
normally present in contaminated foods, but enough to

cause infection, and to the presence of RT-PCR inhibitors [2,6,11,12].
The most important finding of the investigation was
the presence of norovirus in stool samples from an
asymptomatic food handler (FH B), who denied having
had symptoms before or after the suspected lunch. She
had not consumed the suspected round of beef, but she
had prepared, cut and served it to the diners (including
FH A). Although vomiting may be a source of infection
[13,14], this possibility may be discarded, as very little
more than 24 hours had passed between the appearance
of the first cases and the taking of stool samples from
FH B. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the sequence
of the virus detected in FH B was identical to that
detected in cases (Genotype GII.2). The region of the
genome chosen for sequencing (the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase) is regarded as a good target to discriminate different norovirus genotypes, although it has
also been reported that the hypervariable region encoding the P2 domain in the capsid gene can be helpful in
tracking transmission events within outbreaks [15].
Unlike GII.4, GII.2 is not a prevalent genotype, meaning
that a possible chance association could be ruled out. In
addition, children and monitors lived in different towns
than FH B. Therefore, our results suggest that the
source of the infection was probably an asymptomatic
food handler.
Asymptomatic excretion of norovirus is recognized in
facilities with outbreaks [16,17] and without outbreaks
[18]. Ozawa et al. showed that the prevalence of norovirus detection in food handlers was 19% in different
food-catering settings in Japan, and that detection of
norovirus in asymptomatic food handlers associated
with outbreaks was 7%, a substantial proportion.
Transmission by a food handler may be difficult to
prove and there is little information about their implication in the transmission of the virus, even though it has
been shown that GII-norovirus infected asymptomatic
individuals have mean viral loads similar to those of
symptomatic subjects (3.31 × 10 8 versus 5.53 × 10 8
copies/g of stool), showing the importance of transmission by people who are infected but not ill [17-19]. In
addition, a very low dose of virus is needed to infect
(10-100 viral particles). Although there are not sufficient
studies to show the role of asymptomatic food handlers,
our study suggests that asymptomatic carriers may be
infectious.
Daniels et al. were the first authors to demonstrate
the implication of an asymptomatic food handler in an
outbreak [20], when they found the same genomic
sequence of norovirus in the implicated food and in
relatives of a food handler not exposed to the food.
Molecular analysis of the genomic sequences of the
virus detected in the food and in food handlers would

Page 5 of 7

be desirable in this kind of outbreak, but due to the difficulty in detecting the virus in foods the association is
usually established either by identifying the same viral
genome in the food handler and in affected people or
through analytical epidemiological studies. Therefore,
stool samples from affected people are essential since it
allows the common origin of the cases to be shown.
Simultaneously, stool samples from all food handlers
should be analyzed, together with the epidemiological
information available. Molecular epidemiology analysis
of norovirus detected in patients and food handlers
should be extended when epidemiological information
suggests that the source may be a food handler.
Monitoring of safe practices in the food chain
[9,12,21,22] and the recommendation that food handlers
with diarrhoea should not work until 48-72 hours after
becoming asymptomatic [7-23] are the current strategies
employed to prevent foodborne infections. Several studies have demonstrated that viral shedding of norovirus
may last longer [24-27]. In one study in which the virus
was inoculated in fifty volunteers, the results showed
that specimens collected 7 days after inoculation
remained positive [24]. In another human experimental
norovirus infection model, the virus was detected in
stool samples for a median of 4 weeks and for up to
8 weeks after virus inoculation [27]. Although virus
detection in faeces does not mean the virus is infectious,
the low infective dose and prolonged shedding of norovirus makes transmission almost certain. Therefore, the
recommendation of exclusion of workers for 48-72
hours after disappearance of symptoms may not be sufficient to avoid the transmission of infection.
Moreover, a recent study evaluating the effectiveness
of control measures during a norovirus outbreak showed
that the implementation of recommended strategies
reduced transmission of the virus by 85% (95% predictive interval: 81-87%), but could not contain the outbreak [28]. The use of protective barriers such as gloves,
aprons, facemasks and hairnets seems not to be effective
against norovirus.
In an investigation of a gastroenteritis outbreak, accurate diagnosis and early identification of the origin of
contaminated food is essential to prevent new cases,
since it enables control measures to be implemented.
However, it is not established which measures should be
introduced - hand washing, use of barriers or correct
cleaning of environmental surfaces [2,7]. At present, we
do not know how to stop norovirus transmission. Strategies focus on correct hand washing as a preventive
action and assessing the efficacy of disinfectants in eliminating the virus from the environment (water and
surfaces). Effective prevention strategies should be determined and implemented according to scientific
evidence.

Conclusions
The results of this study show that, in outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis, analysis of stool samples from all
food handlers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) is
necessary. Given the importance of food handlers in the
prevention of norovirus infections, all means should be
used to encourage health education on hand washing,
the hygienic manipulation of food, cleaning and
disinfection.
