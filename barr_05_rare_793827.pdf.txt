Abstract
For many years, the term 'specific cough' has been used as a clinical cough descriptor in children
to signify the likelihood of an underlying disease causing the cough. In this case study, we describe
a child with specific cough caused by a rare carcinoma, a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the
bronchus. The cough only totally resolved after the primary cause was successfully treated. This
report highlights the importance of following up children with cough, especially those with specific
cough.

Clinical Record
An 8-year-old girl from a remote Aboriginal community
approximately 2500 km from Brisbane was transferred to
our hospital for management of a bronchial lesion. She
had received 7-days of intravenous amoxicillin prior to
transfer. She had a 4-year history of daily wet and sometimes productive cough, which was worse on exertion.
There was no history of exertional dyspnoea, haemoptysis
or weight loss. She also had a history of recurrent admissions for pneumonia at the local hospital (3 in the past 6
months). In the child's community, two adults were
recently diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
On arrival, the child was thin (weight 5th percentile,
height 25th), appeared well and had a wet cough, reduced
air entry over the right side and inspiratory crepitations.
Spirometry values were invalid as she could not adequately perform maximum expiratory manoeuvres. Chest

x-ray (CXR) showed right upper lobe (RUL) collapse,
tram-tracks signs and increased peribronchial and interstitial markings of the right lower lobe. These CXR changes
were documented at least 4-months ago (figures 1 and 2).
Chest high resolution computerised tomography (CT)
scan revealed RUL collapse and severe cystic bronchiectasis and cylindrical bronchiectasis of the right middle and
lower lobes (figures 3 and 4). Sputum cultures grew
Moraxella catarrhalis, and the microscopy was negative for
acid-fast bacilli. Mantoux tests (M. tuberculum, M. Avium)
were negative, sweat test and immunological workup were
normal. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a large lesion at
the carina (Figure 5). Rigid bronchoscopy was then immediately performed during which the lesion was only partially removed piecemeal because of the presumed
diagnosis of tuberculosis and length of time required to
remove the bulk of the lesion (2-hours). Given the significant tuberculosis contact, anti-tuberculous medications

were commenced and later ceased when cultures and
Quantiferon test were negative. Histology showed a subepithelial neoplasm comprising glandular and solid areas
with no evidence of significant mitotic activity or atypia,
consistent with a low-grade muco-epidermoid carcinoma
(MEC). Cytogenetic investigation on the tumour was not
performed. Chest and abdomen CT scans revealed no
metastases. Bronchoscopy was repeated and the remaining small lesions were biopsied. Right upper lobectomy
and lymph node sampling was then performed and histological examination of the operative specimen demonstrated a small amount of residual tumour (with clear
resection margins) and bronchiectasis. No metastases
were found in the sampled lymph nodes. Postoperative
progress was uneventful and the child was discharged 9days later and was cough free. When reviewed 4 months
post-discharge, she remained cough free and a repeat flexible bronchoscopy then confirmed the absence of any
bronchial lesion or secretions.

Discussion
We have described a child with several features of chronic
specific cough caused by suppurative lung disease secondary to a rare life threatening lesion, a mucoepidermoid
carcinoma obstructing a major bronchus. The child's

cough only totally resolved upon removal of the tumour;
i.e. after the primary cause was successfully treated. This
report illustrates the importance of following-up children
with chronic cough. Cough was this child's only symptom
that was consistently present between the child's recurrent
hospitalisations.
Paediatric cough, unlike cough in adults, is generally classified for practical purposes into cough descriptors of
'non-specific' and 'specific' cough [1,2]. In children with
wet cough, airway secretions are always present [3]. Wet
cough is a feature of specific cough as children (especially
young children), unlike adults, do not often expectorate
sputum. Several features of specific cough were present in
this child; specifically, daily moist or productive cough,
recurrent pneumonia and abnormal auscultatory findings
[1] were present. Thus she had specific cough pointers
and, in ideal circumstances, clinicians would be cognisant
that the cough is likely associated with an underlying respiratory problem and hence requires further workup and
follow-up to define the aetiology. Also, in children, the
recommended minimum investigations for any child with
a chronic cough are a CXR and spirometry [4]. In this
child, the CXR was clearly abnormal – another indicator
that further follow-up and investigations are usually
required. This child had clinical features of bronchiectasis
for at least several months and most likely a few years

before eventual diagnosis of the underlying cause of her
cough and respiratory illness. Also, radiological evidence
of bronchiectasis was present and was secondary to a lowgrade MEC that caused obstructive bronchiectasis (hence
chronic wet cough from suppurative lung disease) and
recurrent pneumonia. Unfortunately, the bronchiectasis
was not restricted to the RUL; the delay in diagnosis
allowed growth of the tumour that was so large it
obstructed the entire right main bronchus and lead to
obstructive bronchiectasis of the right lung.
Lung carcinoma remains the most common cancer in
adults but is very rare in children [5]. Pulmonary MEC are
even more rare (only 53 paediatric reports) [6-8] and represent approximately 10% of paediatric pulmonary
tumours [7]. Macroscopically, MEC appear as a polypoid
mass extending into the lumen [6-9] which may appear
similar to bronchial mycobacteria lesions (Figure 6).
Definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy, usually taken
at bronchoscopy [6,7]. Because MEC are covered by normal respiratory epithelium bronchial brushings are usually not diagnostic [7,10]. MEC is thought to arise from
mucous glands in the submucosal layer of respiratory
walls [8,11] and is phylogenetically similar to salivary
gland tumours [10]. Cytogenetic analysis of MEC tumours
have described the presence of translocation t(11;19)
(q14-21;p12-13) [12]. MEC has an 'iceberg-like' tendency

to extend partially into the airway lumen but may extend
into surrounding lung parenchyma [7]. Histologically,
these tumours consist of a mixture of epidermoid,
mucous and intermediate cells and may be classified as
low, intermediate or high grade, reflecting differing compositions of cell types, extent of mitosis, anaplasia, and
morphological variance ranging from cystic through to
solid in nature [7,8,10]. Low grade tumours, more common in children, predominantly consist of mucous cells
with occasional intermediate cells, tend to be locally invasive and, are associated with long term survival [9]. Intermediate grade tumours are more solid with
predominance of intermediate cells and occasional
mucous cells [8]. High grade tumours, more common in
adults have a poorer prognosis [6-8,10,11]. with metastatic spread via blood or lymphatics to skin, bone and
pericardium [8]. In all but two of the reported paediatric
cases including ours, MEC was found to be low grade, and
these tumours were successfully resected with no recurrence on follow up [7,8]. Children with high grade
tumour succumb early, with one report of a child with a
high grade tumour who succumbed eight months after
diagnosis [7].

tigations that include radiology and, in selected children,
bronchoscopy should be promptly initiated [4].
Presentation of patients with MEC is unusual until some
obstruction of the involved airway occurs [6-9]. Common
presenting symptoms include cough, recurrent pneumonia, haemoptysis, wheeze, dyspnoea, fever, and chest pain
[7,8,13]. The rarity of these tumours contributes to delays
in diagnosis [7,8]. While a diagnostic delay of up to 20months has been reported [8], the likely several years
interval in this child seemed particularly noteworthy.
Deficiencies in health resources available in remote
regions are well documented [14]. Indigenous Australians
comprise a significant subset of this population and are
particularly afflicted by respiratory illness [15,16]. As
many of the presenting respiratory symptoms have an
infective cause, the diagnostic suspicion of carcinoma in
this setting is potentially further reduced. While adverse
outcomes may be minimal, delays in diagnosis could lead
to increased and prolonged morbidity. This report highlights the need to clinically follow-up all children with
chronic cough especially those with chronic specific
cough. After successful treatment of the underlying cause,
cough almost always resolves in children. In patients with
chronic specific cough and/or other respiratory symptoms
not responsive to standard medical therapy, further inves-
