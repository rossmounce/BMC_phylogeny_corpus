Abstract
Background: Although the presence of Asia 2 group of canine distemper virus (CDV) was known
by the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (H) gene, the fusion (F) protein gene
sequence of Asia 2 group had not been identified. So, the sequence analysis of F gene was carried
out to elucidate the genotypic varaitons among Asian isolates.
Results: The phylogenetic analysis of F and H gene sequences from fourteen CDV isolates
obtained from diseased dogs in Japan and Thailand indicated that the F genes had a new initiation
codon and extra 27 nucleotides upstream of the usual open reading frame (ORF) and the F proteins
had extra 9 amino acids at the N-terminal position only in Asia 2 isolates. On the contrary, the Asia
1 isolates had three extra putative N-glycosylation sites (two sites in the signal peptide region and
one site in the F1 region) except for two strains of Th12 and Ac96I (two sites in signal peptide
region) adding to four putative N-glycosylation sites that were conserved among all Asian isolates
and Onderstepoort strain. In addition to this difference in N-glycosylation sites, the signal peptide
region had a great diversity between Asia 1 and Asia 2 isolates. Also, characteristic amino acids
were detected for some strains.
Conclusion: Asia 2 isolates were distinguished from other CDV lineages by the extra 27
nucleotide sequence. The signal peptide region of F gene gives a remarkable differentiation between
Asia 1 and Asia 2 isolates. Strains Th12 and Ac96I were differentiated from other Asia 1 strains by
the F protein glycosylation sites.

Background
Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a single strand RNA virus
belonging to genus Morbillivirus within the family Para-

myxoviridae. The CDV genome encodes the following virion proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P),
matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (H) and polymer-

ase (L). The F protein mediates pH-independent fusion of
the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host
cell [1].
Paramyxovirus fusion proteins are synthesized as an inactive precursor F0 that is cleaved by a host-cell protease to
release the new N-terminus of the F1 [2]. Thus, forming
the biologically active protein consists of the disulfide
linked chain F1 and F2 [3]. The membrane anchored F1
subunit contains several regions important for promotion
of membrane fusion. At its C-terminus, a hydrophobic
trans-membrane domain (TM) anchors the protein in the
membrane leaving a short cytoplasmic tail (20-40 residues). The fusion peptide, locates at the F1 subunit N-terminus, has been demonstrated to insert into the target
membrane upon initiation of membrane fusion [4]. Also,
F1 contains two heptad repeat regions, one close to C-terminal of the fusion peptide (HRA) and the other adjacent
to the trans-membrane domain (HRB) [2,5,6]. To date,
intensive studies were carried out on the H gene sequencing and phylogenetic relationship analysis [7-14] but a little is known about the F gene variations. Two genotypes
of H gene, Asia 1 [9,15] and Asia 2 [12], have been recognized among Asian isolates of CDV and they were found
to differ from those of the European and American CDV
genomes. In this study the phylogenetic characterization
of F as well as H protein genes among Asian isolates of
CDV was carried out to know the genetic variations of F
genes.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acids of H genes
The phylogenetic relationship based on the deduced
amino acid sequences of the H protein of fourteen CDV
strains were analyzed as shown in Fig. 1. As a result,
strains 007Lm, 55L, 66L, 009L, M25CR, 011C, 50Con and
50Cbl were classified into Asia 2 group and strains Ac96I,
Th12, 50Sc, 81ND, 82Con and 83mLN were classified
into Asia 1 group. Among the Asia 2 strains, 007Lm, 66L,
009L, M25CR, and 011C had identical amino acid
sequences of the H gene, although strain 009L differed
from strains 007Lm, 66L, M25CR, and 011C in its nucleotide sequence of the H gene (99% identity). In addition,
these four strains differed from strains 55L, 50Con, and
50 Cb1 in both amino acid and nucleotide sequences
(99% identity of both amino acid and nucleotide
sequences). On the other hand, among the Asia 1 strains,
50Sc, 82Con, and 83mLN had identical amino acid
sequences of the H gene although strain 82Con differed
from strains 50Sc and 83mLN in the nucleotide sequences
of the H gene (99% identity). However, these three strains
differed from strains Ac96I, Th12, and 81ND in both
amino acid (identity 99% with Ac96I and 81ND, and
98% with Th12) and nucleotide sequence (identity 99%
with Ac96I and 81ND, and 98% with Th12).

and Onderstepoort (AF378705).
Extra 27 nucleotides upstream of the usual F gene
initiation codon characterized Asia 2 strains
Sequence analyses of the F gene revealed a new initiation
codon and extra 27 nucleotides upstream of the usual F
gene open reading frame (ORF) in all Asia 2 isolates. To
characterize this nucleotide sequence, which extended
from 4908 to 4934, various CDV strains as well as the
present fourteen strains were compared about the nucleotide sequences from 4901 to 4940 as shown in Fig. 2.
Interestingly, only Asia 2 isolates have a nucleotide
change from 4909G to 4909T which led to the expansion of
the F ORF. All Asia 2 isolates (007Lm, 55L, 66L, 009L,
M25CR, 011C, 50Con and 50Cbl) had an identical 27
nucleotide sequence. In addition, other nucleotide differences were found among Asia 2 isolates such as 4907T/
4907C that characterized 50Con and 50Cbl from other
strains, also 4920G/4920A and 4930T/4930G characterized all
Asia 2 strains although American and European as well as
Yanaka (Asia 1) strains have the same nucleotide at position 4920 as Asia 2 isolates. The 4926A and 4928A were
shared by all strains in compared to Onderstepoort strain
(Fig. 2).

and 011 C), (50Con and 50Cbl), Asia 1 strains (Th12, Ac96I,
50Sc, 81ND, 82Con and 83mLN) and American strains (982645, 00-2601 and 01-2689). Accession numbers as in Fig. 1.

Structure of the F gene product and cleavage sites stability
The F genes of fourteen Asian CDV isolates were
sequenced and the deduced amino acids were aligned to
detect the genetic variations among Asian isolates as
shown in Fig. 3. The F gene product is cleaved by cellular
proteases of signal peptidase and furin into three regions;
signal peptide, F2 and F1 [2]. The cleavage sites, AQIHW
in the C-terminus of signal peptide region and RRQRR in
the N-terminus of F1 region [16-18], were highly conserved in all Asian isolates as shown in Fig. 3.
Signal peptide region
The signal peptide region is an important region for location of the precursor F0 into golgi network to cleave into
F1 and F2 for fusion activity [19] and is a highly divergent
region [2]. As shown in Fig. 3 all Asia 2 isolates have extra
9 amino acids upstream of the N-terminus of this region
which is a characteristic for Asia 2 isolates. The amino acid
variations were 30 - 32 % and 34 - 35 % while the nucleotide differences were 15 - 16 % and 18 - 19 % for Asia 2
and Asia 1, respectively in comparison with the Onderstepoort strain in the signal peptide region. Both Asia 1 and
Asia 2 isolates have common amino acids which differ
from Ondestepoort. Moreover, each group has its specific
amino acids. However, within the same group there is
amino acid(s) characteristic to individual strain as in
007Lm 116Y/116C and inTh12 9T/9S and 26R/26K (Fig. 3).
F2 and F1 regions
In the F2 region (aa136-224), amino acid differences were
found as 208N/208K and 216V/216L in Asia 1 isolates,
whereas 186D/186G, 193S/193N, 195V/195I and 216V/216L in
Asia 2 isolates but strains 50Con and 50Cbl have the same
amino acid at positions 193 and 195 as Onderstepoort
strain (Fig. 3).

The membrane anchored F1 subunit contains the fusion
peptide (FP) domain (hydrophobic) at the N-terminus,
trans-membrane (TM) domain (hydrophobic) and the
cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain at the C-terminus. The
fusion peptide domain was highly conserved among all
CDV strains. On the other hand, amino acid changes were
found in the TM domain as 616I/616S in all Asia 1 isolates
and 627C/627Y in all Asia 2 isolates. In the CT domain, six
amino acid changes were observed within a span of 33
amino acid sequence. Common amino acid changes in all
Asian isolates were found as 640N/640H and 646T/646A. Specific amino acid changes to all Asia 1 isolates were found
as 634R/634Q, 637F/637L and 639H/639Q while those specific
to Asia 2 isolates were found as 637H/637L and 656R/656K.
Strains 50Con and 50Cbl had the same amino acids at
positions 637 and 656 as Onderstepoort strain.
Adjacent to these domains, heptad repeats were designated as HRA (aa 250-307), HB (aa 328-374) and HRB
(aa 557- 601), respectively [6,20,21] as shown in Fig. 3.
Amino acid changes were found in HB domain as 366N/
366G in all Asian isolates and as 600K/600R in HRB domain
in Asia 1 isolates except for Yanaka strain while HRA
domain was conserved
In other regions than the above described domains, common amino acid changes in all Asian isolates but different
from Onderstepoort strain were found as 317K/317R, 431V/
431I and 556S/556G. Group specific change(s) was found as
395V/395I in Asia 2 isolates while those were found as 309L/
390F, 429K/429R, 466I/466L and 607S/607G in Asia 1 isolates,
but strains Ac96I and Th12 have no amino acid difference
at position 607 in compare to Onderstepoort strain. However, an unique amino acid to one or more strains in the
same group was detected such as 546S/546G for M25CR and
011C, 478G/478C for 81ND and 482W/482L for 50Sc strains
as shown in Fig 3.
N-linked glycosylation sites and cysteine residues
The F protein of Asian isolates had seven potential glycosylation sites (Fig. 3). Four of them were recognized at
positions 141-143, 173-175, 179-181 in the F2 region and
517-519 in the F1 region as reported previously [1618,21]. Interestingly, the extra three potential glycosylation sites according to the consensus amino acid sequence
for N-glycosylation site (N-X-S/T) were found in Asia 1
but not Asia 2 isolates, two at positions 62-64 and 108110 in the signal peptide region were conserved in all Asia
1 strains while the site 605-607 in F1 region was found in
some Asia 1 strains (50Sc, 81ND, 82Con and 83mLN).
These seven glycosylation sites are shared by Taiwanese
field isolates [22].

Cysteine amino acids are an important factor for the intra
molecular disulfide bond and the steric structure of protein. As a result, a total 18 cysteine residues were detected

in the F gene product; among them, fourteen residues
were located at identical positions in all CDV strains (Fig.
3). Characteristic cysteine residues were located at positions 67, 116, 478 and 627.
Phylogenetic analysis of amino acids of F genes
The identities between the amino acid and nucleotide
sequences of Asia 2 and these of Onderstepoort were 91 %
except for 50Con and 50Cbl (92 %), whereas identities
between the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of
Asia1 and Onderstepoort were 90 % and 91 %, respectively as shown in Table 1. Strains 66L and 009L, 011C
and M25CR as well as strains 82Con and 83mLN showed
100 % identities in both amino acid and nucleotide
sequences. The similarity of strain Th12 was 99 and 98 %
to other Asia 1 strains in amino acids and nucleotides,
respectively. While the similarity was 91 and 93 % to all
Asia 2 isolates in amino acids and nucleotide sequences
except for strains 50Con and 50Cbl amino acid identity
was 92 % (Table 1).

The Phylogenetic analysis of F genes revealed that Asia 2
strains clustered into four clades; clade 50Con and 50 Cbl,
clade 007Lm, clade 011C and M25CR, clade 66L, 55L and
009L as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, Asia 1 isolates
have five clades including clade Ac96I, clade Th12, clade
81ND, clade 50Sc, clade 82Con and 83mLN. Interestingly, Asia 1 isolates were appeared to be closer to the
European (5804) strain than American strains (A75/17,
98-2645, 00-2601, and 01-2689) when the phylogenetic
relationship of F gene (Fig. 4) was compared with that of
H gene (Fig. 1). In addition to this, the identical strains in
H gene sequences such as 66L, 009L, M25CR, 011C and
007Lm could be distinguished into three distant clades of
Asia 2, and strains 82Con, 50Sc and 83meLN into two dis-

tant clades of Asia 1 by F gene sequences analysis as
shown in Fig. 4.
The phylogenetic relationship among various CDV strains
based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the signal
peptide region (Fig. 5) showed similar but not identical
classification to that of F gene (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Although the presence of Asia 2 group of CDV was known
previously by the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of
H gene [12], the characteristion of F gene or F protein of
Asia 2 group had not been identified. In this study, the
characteristic extra 27 nucleotides encoding extra 9 amino
acids adding to the usual ORF of F gene and the usual 662
amino acids of F protein, respectively, were found for the
first time in all Asia 2 isolates by sequencing analysis of F
genes (Fig. 2 and 3). The extra 27 nucleotide sequences
were identical and highly conserved among Asia 2 isolates. This fact indicates that Asia 2 isolates are easily distinguished from other CDV strains including Asia 1,
American and European isolates, by this sequence.
The nucleotide change from 4909G to 4909T led to the
appearance of new initiation codon from position 4908
upstream of the usual F gene ORF (Fig. 2). Previous studies have suggested that translation of F protein starts at the
first initiation codon, AUG1, or at the second codon,
AUG61, that locates in the signal peptide region [2,23].
Adding to these in-frame AUGs, a new AUG appeared in
Asia 2 isolates. Thus, producing an unusual long signal
peptide, depending on the translation initiation codon
used in the case of Asia 2 isolates.
The signal peptide region cleavage is necessary for the F
gene activation and expression on the cell surface [2].

However, many reports have indicated that the potential
function of this region is indirectly affecting the fusion
activity of F protein and thus potentially contributing to
neurovirulence, although this function was different for
CDV strains [2,6]. So, the frequent variation observed in
signal peptide region among Asian isolates may account
for viral pathogenesis. In addition to the four conserved
N-linked glycosylation sites, three were found only in Asia
1 isolates. Previous studies suggested that N-linked glyco-

the virus life cycle and in virulence mechanisms such as
binding to cell surface receptors and protecting against
antibody neutralization [24-28], also the glycosylation
might play an important role in the cleavage dependent

activation of the precursor F0 protein or in its transport to
the sub-cellular region where the proteolytic cleavage
occurs [29]. Our finding of different glycosylation sites of
the F proteins suggested that these F proteins have different characters.
When compared to Asian isolates, European 5804 strain
shared all N-glycosaltion sites with Asia 1 except for that
at position 605-607; in contrast American strains have the
common four glycosylation sites as Asian isolates in addition to one site 108-110 shared by strains A75/17 and 012689.
Interestingly, strains Ac96I and Th12 have the same
amino acids as Asia 2 at position 23H and Th12 has
unique amino acids at 7K and 26R. Also, Yanaka strain,
Asia 1 isolate [9] has similar amino acids to Asia 2 isolates
such as 19L, 23H, 84D and 101R as well as unique amino
acids at positions 57F, 67G, 94F, 95I, 98V, 104K, 116R, 126M,
130L, 151N and 513G.
The genetic relationships shown in Fig 1 and 4 indicate
that the field isolates form two separated lineages based
on the deduced amino acids of F or H gene. Surprisingly,
Asia 1 isolates appeared to be more closely related to
European 5804 strain than to any other American strains
by comparing the full F gene, while by H gene analysis,
Asia 1 isolates were clearly distinguishable from European
strain (Fig 1 and Fig. 4). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acids of the signal peptide
region of F genes is helpful for CDV classification giving a
similar overview to that of the full F gene as shown in Fig
4 and 5.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis of F gene gives clear picture for
the H gene identical CDV strains and the signal peptide

region gives a remarkable differentiation between Asia 1
and Asia 2 isolates.

Materials and methods
Cells and Viruses
Vero.DogSLAMtag cells were established as described previously [30]. Cells were passaged and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-MEM; autoclavable;
Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum in a CO2 incubator
at 37°C.

Fourteen CDV strains; 007Lm, 55L, 66L, 009L, M25CR,
011C, 50Con, 50Cbl, Ac96I, Th12, 50Sc, 81ND, 82Con
and 83mLN, were isolated and propagated, one or a few
times, in Vero.dogSLAMtag cells and stored at -80°C until
use. Specimens were collected from diseased dogs as summarized in Table 2.
Sequencing of F and H genes of CDV and phylogenetic
analysis
Vero.DogSLAMtag cells were infected with virus suspensions at MOI = 0.01 and incubated for 18 - 24 hours.
When the CPE almost covered the cultures, total RNA was
extracted using a MagExtractor™ RNA Extraction Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and PCR
amplification (RT-PCR) were carried out using a ReverTraPlus-™-RT-PCR Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan). The
primers used were as follows: 5'ACTTGCCCGATCTCAAGCTA 3' and 5' ATGCTGGAGATGGTTT AATTCAATCG 3'. The forward represents nucleotides 4754 4773 of the M-F region in the positive sense and the
reverse represents nucleotides 8969 - 8994 of the H-L
region in the negative sense. The amplified PCR products
(4240 bp) were purified by using a Gene Clean II kit (Biogene, Inc., USA) after agarose gel (0.7 %) electrophoresis,
and sequenced directly using a Big Dye® Terminator v.3.1
