Abstract
Background: On 26 December 2004, a tsunami struck the coast of the state of Tamil Nadu, India,
where one-dose measles coverage exceeded 95%. On 29 December, supplemental measles
immunization activities targeted children 6 to 60 months of age in affected villages. On 30
December, Cuddalore, a tsunami-affected district in Tamil Nadu reported a cluster of measles
cases. We investigated this cluster to estimate the magnitude of the problem and to propose
recommendations for control.
Methods: We received notification of WHO-defined measles cases through stimulated passive
surveillance. We collected information regarding date of onset, age, sex, vaccination status and
residence. We collected samples for IgM antibodies and genotype studies. We modeled the
accumulation of susceptible individuals over the time on the basis of vaccination coverage, vaccine
efficacy and birth rate.
Results: We identified 101 measles cases and detected IgM antibodies against measles virus in eight
of 11 sera. Cases were reported from tsunami-affected (n = 71) and unaffected villages (n = 30)
with attack rates of 1.3 and 1.7 per 1000, respectively. 42% of cases in tsunami-affected villages had
an onset date within 14 days of the tsunami. The median ages of case-patients in tsunami-affected
and un-affected areas were 54 months and 60 months respectively (p = 0.471). 36% of cases from
tsunami-affected areas were above 60 months of age. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the
sequences of virus belonged to genotype D8 that circulated in Tamil Nadu.
Conclusion: Measles virus circulated in Cuddalore district following the tsunami, although there
was no association between the two events. Transmission despite high one-dose vaccination
coverage pointed to the limitations of this vaccination strategy. A second opportunity for measles
immunization may help reducing measles mortality and morbidity in such areas. Children from 6
month to 14 years of age must be targeted for supplemental immunization during complex
emergencies.

Background
Measles remains an important cause of childhood mortality, especially in developing countries. In 2000, measles
killed 770,000 children worldwide, accounting for nearly
half of vaccine preventable deaths [1]. Failure to deliver at
least one dose of measles vaccine to all infants remains the
primary reason for high measles mortality and morbidity
in developing countries [2]. Measles vaccination coverage
among infants in Southeast Asia and Africa is still low,
ranging between 54–55% in 1999 to 65–67% in 2003 [3].
However, Sri Lanka [4], Latin America [5], Romania [6]
and South Korea [7], experienced outbreaks of measles in
spite of sustained high coverage with single-dose vaccination strategy. Thus, the 2001–2005 WHO/UNICEF strategic plan for measles mortality reduction and regional
elimination recommended achieving high routine vaccination coverage (>90%) in every district and ensuring that
all children receive a second opportunity for measles
immunization [2].
Population movement and high population densities
facilitate transmission of the measles virus. Thus, outbreaks of measles are common among refugees and displaced populations [8-11]. Poor nutritional status, also
common in these settings, has been associated with an
increased risk of death following measles [11,12]. As a
result, measles outbreaks are a major killer during complex emergencies. Immunization of children against measles is considered a highly cost-effective priority among
displaced populations housed in camps [13]. WHO and
UNICEF recommend vaccinating all children from six
months through 14 years of age along with vitamin A supplementation during emergencies [14]. At the minimum,
children from six months through 4 years must be vaccinated, while vaccine availability, funding, human
resources and local measles epidemiology may influence
the choice of the age groups covered [14].
On 26 December 2004, a tsunami struck the coast of the
state of Tamil Nadu, India, affecting more than 896,000
individuals and resulting in 7,983 deaths [15]. Affected
individuals were provided with shelter in temporary
camps. On 28 December 2004, the Field Epidemiology
Training Programme of the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, sent three teams to the districts of Cuddalore, Nagapatinam and Kanyakumari that
had been affected by the tsunami to assist district health
authorities in (1) stimulating the routine surveillance system so that it would meet the needs of the emergency and
(2) responding to outbreaks. On 29 December 2004,
health authorities initiated supplemental measles immunization targeting children aged six to 60 months in all
tsunami-affected villages in Tamil Nadu. On 30 December
2004, the emergency surveillance system set-up by the
Indian Field Epidemiology Training Programme detected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/143

a cluster of measles in one of the relief camps in the district of Cuddalore. The estimated measles vaccine coverage exceeded 95% since 1988 in Tamil Nadu. (Director of
Public Health, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, unpublished data).
We investigated this cluster to estimate the magnitude of
the problem and to propose recommendations for control.

Methods
Descriptive epidemiology
We defined a case of measles as per WHO guidelines as
the occurrence of fever with maculo-papular rash and at
least one of the following: cough, coryza or conjunctivitis
in a resident of the Cuddalore district from 26 December
2004 [16]. We received notification of measles cases
through the routine passive surveillance system that we
stimulated following tsunami by requesting health care
facilities in the district to report occurrences of measles
and other diseases of epidemic potential [17]. For each
case, we collected information regarding date of onset,
age, sex, vaccination status and place of residence. We
sorted places of residence to determine whether the case
occurred in any of the 58 coastal villages declared as tsunami affected (2005 population = 87,284) by the Government of Tamil Nadu [18]. In the absence of reported
major measles outbreak since 1988, we modeled the accumulation of children susceptible to measles since 1988,
according to census data, population growth rate, birth
rate, administrative vaccination coverage for the state of
Tamil Nadu and the expected vaccine efficacy of 85% for
measles vaccine administered at 9 months of age [19]
according to the method proposed by de Quadros [20].
We calculated the coverage of supplementary measles
immunization in tsunami-affected areas using the administrative method by dividing the number of doses of vaccine administered during the campaign by the number of
children aged six to sixty months in this area. We applied
the proportion of population aged 6–60 months in the
district to the size of the affected population to calculate
number of children in this age group in tsunami-affected
area. The administrative coverage may exceed 100%
because of census inaccuracies, population movements
and vaccination of children beyond the recommended
age group.
Laboratory confirmation
We collected blood samples from randomly selected case
patients with active clinical measles and examined sera for
IgM antibodies against measles virus (Behring, Germany).
We collected throat swabs from case patients with active
clinical measles and performed RT PCR using N gene
primers [21]. We performed the sequence alignment and
phylogenetic tree analysis using Clustal X (version 1.83)
and MEGA (version, 2.1) software and built a phyloge-

netic tree with standard WHO sequences of each genotype.
Ethical clearance
We conducted this investigation under the responsibility
of the National Institute of Epidemiology, according to
the ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human
subjects of Indian council of Medical Research. The
National Institute of Epidemiology has its own Ethical
Committee. However, this investigation was conducted in
the context of a public health response to an outbreak and
therefore ethical committee review was not indicated.
Data analysis
We entered and analyzed the data using Epi Info software
(Version 3.3). We calculated the attack rates for measles in
areas affected and un-affected by the tsunami in Cuddalore district using population data obtained from the
district health authorities. As the age distribution was not
available at the village level, we applied the age distribution of the district to calculate the age-group specific
attack rates in affected and unaffected areas. The median
ages of measles cases in tsunami affected and un-affected
population was compared using non-parametric test.

Results
We identified 101 cases that met the WHO case definition
for measles. There were no deaths. We collected eleven
blood samples from the case-patients for serological testing. Of these, eight were positive for IgM antibodies
against measles virus. We took throat swabs from two
children with active measles for the isolation of the virus.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both the sequences of
measles virus belonged to genotype D8.
Cases were reported with dates of onset between December 2004 and January 2005 (Figure 1) from tsunamiaffected and unaffected areas. In both areas, the number

of cases reported peaked during the second week following the first case. In tsunami-affected areas, 30 of the 71
cases (42%) occurred within 14 days of the tsunami. 71
measles cases were reported from 20 tsunami-affected villages (2005 population: 53,104) while the remaining 30
cases were from nine unaffected villages (2005 population: 17,357). The attack rate in tsunami-affected areas
was lower than in tsunami un-affected areas, although the
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). The
median ages of case-patients in tsunami-affected and unaffected areas were 54 months (range: 4 months-12 years)
and 60 months (range: 6 months-21 years), respectively
(p = 0.471). There was no major difference in the age-specific attack rates in tsunami-affected and unaffected areas
(Table-1). 26 of the 71 case patients (36.2%) from tsunami-affected areas and 14 of 30 (46.7%) cases in tsunami unaffected areas were above 60 months of age.
Among the 101 cases, three (3%) had vaccination records
indicating they had received measles vaccine, three (3%)
had vaccination records indicated that they had not
received measles vaccine and 95 (94%) had no vaccination records.
The supplementary measles immunization initiated on 29
December 2004 lasted till 9 January 2005 (second week
after tsunami). The estimated population of children aged
6 to 60 months in tsunami-affected area was 8803. A total
of 10, 319 children were administered measles vaccine
(Director of Public Health, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, unpublished data). The coverage for the supplementary campaign calculated using the administrative method was
117.2%. The results of our modeled estimate of population size of susceptible children suggested that between
1988 and 2004, the population of susceptible children in
the district was 97,401 exceeding the size of two birth
cohorts (Table 2).

Discussion
Measles virus circulated between December 2004 and
February 2005 in tsunami-affected and un-affected areas
of the district of Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu. Transmission
occurred despite high one-dose measles vaccine coverage
in the state. Active surveillance in tsunami affected areas
with early case detection and management might have
contributed to the absence of fatality. In addition, supplemental measles immunization targeting children between
six and sixty months might have decreased the population
of susceptible children in tsunami affected areas which
might have limited the spread of this cluster.

The findings of the present investigation suggest that measles transmission in the affected area was unrelated to the
tsunami for a number of reasons. First, attack rates were
not statistically different in tsunami affected and unaffected areas. Second, the attack rate over time showed a

similar pattern in both areas. Third, a large proportion of
cases occurred within one incubation period after the
occurrence of the tsunami. Fourth, the age distribution of
the cases did not differ in tsunami affected and unaffected
areas. Finally, the size of shelters in tsunami affected areas
in Cuddalore ranged from 115 to 2500 (average:
656)[17]. It was much smaller than the major population
concentration usually leading to outbreaks in refugee setting [22].
This cluster of measles occurred despite a high one-dose
measles vaccine coverage in Tamil Nadu (Director of
Health Services, unpublished data). An independent

LQAS vaccine coverage survey conducted in one primary
health care center area also confirmed high one-dose coverage in the state [23]. The results of the phylogenetic
analysis indicated that both the sequences of measles
virus belonged to genotype D8. Genotype D4 and D8
have been isolated from different districts of Tamil Nadu
over the last four years from sporadic cases as well as during outbreaks (National Institute of Virology, unpublished data). The absence of importation of a new
genotype further supports the hypothesis that a measles
virus of that genotype circulates in the area despite high
one-dose vaccination coverage. Measles transmission in
areas with high one-dose vaccination coverage points to

the limitation of the one dose measles vaccination strategy in measles control. Our model suggested that even
with a high coverage scenario, the one-dose measles
immunization strategy in place in Tamil Nadu allowed an
accumulation of a population of susceptible children that
exceeded the size of two birth cohort, thereby allowing
transmission. Outbreaks of measles may occur when the
population of susceptible in a community exceeds one
birth cohort [20]. Measles outbreaks in areas with high
coverage with a single-dose strategy have been reported in
Sri Lanka [4], Latin American countries [5] and in Romania [6]. A second opportunity for measles immunization
in areas with high one-dose coverage may provide additional immunity needed for effective measles control [24].
Our model also suggested that children in the district
could have benefited from a second opportunity for measles vaccination. To reduce the measles mortality in India,
the Government of India developed a strategic plan in
2005 with the objective of (1) reducing the measles mortality by two-thirds by 2010, compared to 2000 estimates
and (2) achieving at least 90% coverage with measles vaccine in 80% of the districts of the country by 2009 [25]. In
addition, states like Tamil Nadu where one-dose coverage
exceeds 90%, the existing network of the national polio
surveillance project will be used to collect good quality
epidemiological data through active surveillance and outbreak investigations.
During this cluster, the number of cases increased and
decreased sharply over time. When measles affects more
than one village, transmission is expected to last for
number of incubation periods. The decrease of incidence
observed in the present investigation is unlikely to be due
to surveillance bias. The passive surveillance system continued to be stimulated for a number of weeks following
the tsunami and was progressively included as a pilot
project in the Integrated Disease Surveillance project
(IDSP), the new national surveillance initiative. Supplemental immunization activities that took place at the time
of the outbreak might have contributed to the rapid
decrease of incidence. These included (1) the post-tsunami immunization campaign that targeted children of
6–60 months between 29 December 2004 and 9 January
2005 in the affected areas and (2) a practice referred to as
'ring immunization' under which children aged 6–60
months of age living within a radius of 5 kilometers of the
case of measles. Our investigation however was not able
to document any age shift in the cases following the campaign as the outbreak ended rapidly. More generally, we
were not able to quantify the impact of supplementary
immunization activities on the dynamic of the outbreak.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/143

to increase immunization coverage [26]. As a consequence, we were unable to propose specific recommendations to eliminate them. However, the high one-dose
measles coverage in the state of Tamil Nadu suggests that
addressing the need of a second opportunity for measles
vaccination is of higher priority that preventing missed
opportunities in this specific setting.
The results of our investigation suggested that measles
virus transmission continued despite high one-dose measles vaccine coverage and that the cluster was unrelated to
the tsunami. The World Health Organization recommends vaccinating children aged six months to 14 years in
refugee and internally displaced persons camps [14] but
also mentions that age group to be targeted during such
campaigns depends on the local epidemiology of the disease. In Tamil Nadu, the high one-dose coverage may
have contributed to the decision to restrict the target age
group to children 6 to 60 month of age after the tsunami
emergency. However, vaccinating children only up to five
years of age might have left some children susceptible to
measles as more than 36% of the cases were older than
five years of age. The results of our investigation support
the recommendation to vaccinate children up to 14 years
of age during complex emergencies, even if the one-dose
coverage is high. It is also necessary that information, education and communication activities targeting mothers as
well as health care workers emphasize the importance of
vaccination cards to allow appropriate evaluation of vaccination coverage in Tamil Nadu. In the longer term, the
ministry of health of the government of India will be
examining how best to address measles as a public health
problem given the heterogeneity of the country with
respect to measles vaccination coverage. While some
states will need to focus on increasing the one-dose vaccination coverage, a number of southern states might be
considered for second opportunity of measles vaccination.

Conclusion
The present cluster of measles was unrelated to accumulation of susceptible population on account of tsunami.
Measles transmission despite high one-dose vaccination
coverage points towards the need of second opportunity
of measles immunization. During complex emergencies,
measles immunization should be offered to children from
6 month to 14 years of age.
