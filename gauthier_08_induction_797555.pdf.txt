Abstract
Background: Cell-free Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I) virions are poorly infectious
and cell-to-cell contact is often required to achieve infection. Other factors might thus importantly
contribute in increasing infection by HTLV-I. Galectin-1 is a galactoside-binding lectin which is
secreted by activated T lymphocytes. Several functions have been attributed to this protein
including its capacity to increase cell-to-cell adhesion. Based on previous studies, we postulated that
this protein could also accentuate HTLV-I infection.
Results: Herein, we demonstrate that galectin-1 expression and release are higher in HTLV-Iinfected T cells in comparison to uninfected T cells. Furthermore, galectin-1 expression was
activated in various cell lines expressing the wild type viral Tax protein while this induction was
minimal upon expression of NF-κB activation-defective TaxM22. Cotransfection of these Tax
expression vectors with galectin-1 promoter-driven luciferase constructs confirmed that Tax
upregulated galectin-1 promoter activity. However, a NF-κB-independent mechanism was strongly
favoured in this induction of galectin-1 expression as no activation of the promoter was apparent
in Jurkat cells treated with known NF-κB activators. Using HTLV-I envelope pseudotyped HIV-1
virions, galectin-1 was shown to increase infectivity. In addition, a co-culture assay with HTLV-Iinfected cells also indicated an increase in cell fusion upon addition of galectin-1. This effect was not
mediated by factors present in the supernatant of the HTLV-I-infected cells.
Conclusion: These data suggest that HTLV-I Tax increases galectin-1 expression and that this
modulation could play an important role in HTLV-I infection by stabilizing both cell-to-cell and
virus-cell interactions.

Background
Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-Iassociated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis

(HAM/TSP) [1-3]. It has been estimated that 20 million
individuals are infected worldwide [4]. The in vivo target
cells are mature CD4+CD45RO T lymphocytes and CD8+
T lymphocytes [5], although other cell types have been

Retrovirology 2008, 5:105

suggested to be potential target including lung epithelial
cells, as recently demonstrated [6]. HTLV-I is transmitted
between individuals by the transfer of infected lymphocytes and is thought to require repeated contacts as
only one out of 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 viruses is infectious [79]. During viral transmission, a contact is established
between an uninfected and an infected T cell by the interaction of the gp46 viral protein with its cellular receptor
subsequently followed by the polarization of the infected
cell cytoskeleton at the site of cell-to-cell contact and the
accumulation of viruses at the cell junction [7]. GLUT-1
has been reported to be part of this receptor and to be
involved in the first step of viral entry, although its exact
role is still ill-defined [10,11]. Although the cellular
ICAM-1 protein has been established as a potential
inducer of microtubule reorganization, the viral Tax protein has also been shown to be active in this process
[12,13].
Tax is the viral transactivator of HTLV-I allowing transcription through the three Tax-responsive elements (TRE1)
present in the U3 region of the Long Terminal Repeat
(LTR) [14-16]. This viral protein also promotes transcription of many cellular genes. To activate transcription, Tax
does not bind directly to the different cellular and viral
promoters but forms complexes with transcription factors, such as the cAMP Response Element Binding transcription factor (CREB). In uninfected cells, CREB
phosphorylation leads to its interaction with CBP (CREBbinding protein) and the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery to CRE elements. In HTLV-I infected
cells, Tax binds simultaneously to CBP and CREB and
recruits the complex to viral TRE1 allowing constitutive
LTR-dependent transcription [17]. Several studies have
also provided detailed analysis on the mechanism of Taxmediated activation of NF-κB by its association to IKK and
upstream kinases [18]. Modulation of cellular genes by
Tax has been extensively studied and has been shown to
involve various transcription factors. In a previous study,
using high-density gene arrays, 763 genes were shown to
have differential gene expression profiles in HTLV-I-transformed and immortalized cell lines compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [19]. One of the
genes from which the expression was upregulated corresponded to the mammalian soluble β-galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-1 (LGALS1).
Galectins are a phylogenetically conserved family of proteins, present from invertebrates to mammals [20-22].
This family is constituted of at least 14 different galectins,
most of which have an affinity for β-galactoside containing glycoconjugates, such as lactosamine residues [20,23].
The galectin family is further subdivided into three subfamilies: the prototype, the tandem repeat and the chimera groups [20]. Galectin-1 is a member of the prototype

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/105

subfamily. While galectin-1 is primarily synthesized as a
monomer that has one carbohydrate recognition domain
(CRD), it also forms a dimer, which thus has the capacity
to bind to two different β-galactoside-containing ligands.
Galectin-1 is present in the cytoplasm of many cell types
but can also be secreted [24-26]. Indeed, although nascent
galectin-1 does not contain any signal sequence or hydrophobic domain necessary for usage of the secretory pathway, it has been well established that certain type of cells,
such as activated T cells and thymus epithelial cells,
secrete this lectin through a leaderless secretion pathway
without compromising membrane integrity [22,24-28].
The expression of the galectin-1 gene is modulated during
cellular differentiation and transformation [22,29]. Its
expression is controlled by DNA methylation [30,31],
known to restrict the access of transcription factors to
binding sites [32]. The +1/+30 region of the galectin-1
gene is well preserved between different species [33] and
the upstream (-57/-31) and downstream elements (+10/
+57) of the initiation site account for the majority of the
basal promoter activity [34]. However, little information
is available on the transcription factor(s) involved in the
modulation of the expression of this gene.
Being a dimer, galectin-1 could mediate cell-cell or cellpathogen interactions. Indeed, our recent report suggests
that galectin-1 stabilizes HIV-1 binding to its target, activating CD4+ T lymphocytes and therefore promoting
HIV-1 infectivity [35,36]. Since an early report has suggested that HTLV-I-infected cells express galectin-1 [19]
and HTLV-I infection requires cell-cell contact for several
cell types, we investigated the pattern of expression of
galectin-1 in infected cells and its possible impact on
HTLV-I transmission. Our data show that Tax significantly
induces transcription from the galectin-1 promoter in an
NF-κB-, SRF- and CREB-independent manner. In fact, cell
lines chronically infected by HTLV-I release more galectin1 when compared to non-infected T cell lines. Furthermore, soluble galectin-1 increases HTLV-I cellular infection by HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. In
addition, our data suggest that soluble galectin-1
enhances HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion between chronically infected cells and uninfected cells.

tion (ATCC) (Manassas, CA) and the S1T cell line was
obtained from Dr. D. Branch (University of Toronto,
Toronto, Canada). The 293T cell line [48] derives from
human embryonic kidney cells and was obtained from
the ATCC. PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors
using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation.
PBMCs were stimulated for 72 h with PHA-L (1 μg/ml)
(Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) and IL-2 (30 U/ml)
and subsequently maintained in the presence of IL-2. All
cell lines were maintained in complete medium (RPMI1640 or DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine
serum (Wisent, St-Jean-Baptiste de Rouville, Canada), Lglutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Wisent, St-Jean-Baptiste de Rouville,
Canada). The following reagent was obtained through the
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division
AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Human rIL-2 from Dr. Maurice
Gately, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc [49].
Plasmids
Expression vectors for wild-type and mutant Tax proteins
(i.e. Tax 703, Tax Δ3 and Tax M22) were obtained from
Dr. K. Matsumoto (Osaka Red Cross Blood Center, Osaka,
Japan) and cloned into phβPr.1neo under the control of
the β-actin promoter [50]. The K30 proviral DNA was
obtained from the NIH AIDS Repository Reagent Program. The pHTLV-Luc vector (kindly provided by Dr. W.C.
Greene, University of California of San Francisco; San
Francisco, CA) contains the luciferase gene under the control of HTLV-I LTR. The pNF-κB-Luc and pSRE-Luc luciferase expression vectors were purchased from Clontech
(Mountain View CA). The pNL4.3Luc+Env-Vpr+ vector
(kindly provided by Dr. N.R. Landau; The Salk Institute
for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) encodes a complete
HIV-1 genome in which the envelope gene has been inactivated and the luciferase gene inserted in the region coding for the Nef viral protein. The pSV HTLV-I env vector
(kindly provided by Dr. R. Sutton, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) harbours the HTLV-I gp46 cDNA
under the control of the SV40 promoter. The pActin-LacZ
vector contains the β-galactosidase gene under the control
of the actin promoter. The pLTRX-Luc construct was
kindly provided by O. Schwartz (Unité d'oncologie virale,
Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and contains the HIV-1 LTR
from the HIV-1 LAI strain positioned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene [51].
Construction of the human galectin-1 promoter vector
A PCR-based approach was used to insert the luciferase
gene under the control of the galectin-1 promoter.
Genomic DNA was isolated from 293T cells with the
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga,
Canada). Two fragments of the galectin-1 promoter
region (0.5 kb or 1.2 kb) were amplified from 200 ng of
genomic DNA by PCR with the forward primers gal-0.5 kb

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/105

(5'-GTTAAGTCAGTGGCCCTCTGCAG-3') or gal-1.2 kb
(5'-CAGAGGAGATGTTAAGAGAGCAGAC-3') and the
reverse primer gal-as1 (5'-CGCACCAGCTGTCAGAAGACTCC-3'). PCR amplifications were then performed in
the presence of 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer, 1 U
of Vent polymerase (New England Biolab, Pickering, Canada) through 35 cycles (denaturing at 95°C for 1 min,
annealing at 63°C for 1 min and polymerizing at 72°C for
1 min). The PCR products were purified with the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and ligated into the pBluescript SK (pBSK) vector in
SmaI. Positive clones were sequenced and compared to
the human galectin-1 promoter sequence (Genbank
Accession no [Z83844.5]). The 0.5 kb and 1.2 kb galectin1 promoter fragments were cut out of pBSK with SacI and
NdeI enzymes and ligated into pGL3-Basic (Promega;
Neapean, Canada) digested by SacI and SmaI.
Preparation of galectin-1
Recombinant human galectin-1 was purified as previously
described [35]. Purified galectin-1 was passed through
Detoxi-gel endotoxin-removing gels (Pierce; Rockford,
IL). The activity of galectin-1 to bind to glycan and to
cross-link neighbouring cells was weekly tested by performing a hemagglutination assay with concentrations
ranging from 1 to 4 μM.
RT-PCR
Total RNA from A2.01, HSB-2, Jurkat (clone E6.1), Molt4, CEM-T4, PM1, Sup T1, C8166-45, C91-PL, MJ, MT2
and S1T cell lines or from transfected 293T cells was
extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Burlington,
Canada). Extracted RNA (5 μg) was then reverse transcripted with the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (1 U) (Invitrogen; Burlington, Canada) and oligo dT primers. Next,
PCR amplification was performed on the resulting cDNA
with primers act-s (5'-CGTGACATTAAGGAGAAGCTGTGC-3') and act-as (5'-TCTAGGAGGAGCAATGATCTTGAT-3')
for
β-actin
mRNA;
gal-s
(5'GACTCAATCATGGCTTGTGGTCTG-3') and gal-as (5'GCTGATTTCAGTCAAAGGCCACAC-3') for galectin-1
mRNA; or tax-s (5'-ATGGCCCACTTCCCAGGGTTTGGAC-3') and tax-as (5'-TCAGACTTCTGTTTCGAGGAAATG-3') for Tax mRNA. PCR amplifications were
performed in the presence of 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 μM of each
primer, 1 U Vent polymerase and 30 amplification cycles
(denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for
galectin, 58°C for β-actin and 65°C for Tax for 1 min and
polymerization at 72°C for 1 min). The PCR products
were then migrated on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Real-time RT-PCR
RNA was first isolated from 293T transfected cells, by the
RNeasy® Plus mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time

RT-PCR reactions were then performed in the presence of
each specific primer. Briefly, RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcripted with the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (1 U) (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primers. PCR reactions were then
initiated in a final volume of 10 μl containing 1 μl of
cDNA, 0.5 μM of each primer, and 1× reaction mix,
including Taq DNA polymerase, the reaction buffer, and
SYBR green (SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ Perfect Real Time,
Fisher Scientific Canada, Montréal, Canada). All primer
sequences were generated using the Light Cycler Probe
Design Software 2.0 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and
checked for specificity using GenBank Blast analysis. The
galectin-1 primers were the following: 5'-GACTCAATCATGGCTTGTGGTCTG-3' (reverse) and 5'-GCTGATTTCAGTCAAAGGCCACAC-3' (forward). In all PCR reactions,
negative controls consisting of a RT-like reaction step with
no added reverse transcriptase in addition to a blank sample were carried out and showed no PCR amplification
(data not shown). Thermal cycling for quantification of
both transcripts was initiated with a denaturation step of
95°C for 10 seconds, followed by 50 cycles (denaturation
at 94°C for 3 seconds, 57°C for annealing during 15 seconds, and elongation at 72°C for 12 seconds). Amplification
of
the
human
HPRT-1
(Hypoxanthine
Phosphoribosyl Transferase 1) cDNA with forward and
reverse primers (5'-AAGCTTGCGACCTTGACC-3' and 5'GACCAGTCAACAGGGGACATAA-3', respectively) was
used as a reference gene for normalisation. To verify the
amplification of each single product with its suitable
melting temperature, and to provide an accurate quantification with the Rel Quant Software, dissociation curves
were run for all reactions and amplified products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Transient transfections
Jurkat, CEM-T4 and SupT1 cells (1 × 107) were transiently
transfected by electroporation as previously described
[52]. Briefly, cells were electroporated with 15–20 μg of
DNA in complete medium containing 10 μg/ml DEAEDEXTRAN in a 0.4 cm electroporation cuvette with the
Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II system (250 V, 950 μF). In transfection experiments assessing NF-κB activation, 24 hours
after transfection, cells were either untreated or treated
with PMA (20 ng/ml) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) (SigmaAldrich, St-Louis MO) for a period of 8 hours. For the Sup
T1 cell line, DMSO was also added at a final concentration
of 1.25%. For certain experiments, extracted RNA were
analysed by RT-PCR, while luciferase activity was evaluated in other transfection experiments as previously
described [53]. In these latter experiments, β-galactosidase activity was also measured through the GalactoLight™ commercial kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments
were conducted in triplicates and both luciferase and βgalactosidase activities are represented as the average

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/105

value +/- standard deviation. Transfection of 293T cells
with the various Tax expression vectors (40 μg) were performed as previously described [54].
Quantification of extracellular galectin-1 levels
A2.01, HSB-2, Jurkat (clone E6.1), Molt-4, PM1, CEM-T4,
SupT1, C8166-45, C91-PL, MJ, MT2 and S1T cell lines
were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml, and incubated for 48
hours. The supernatants were passed through a 0.22 μm
filter, and lysed with a 5× disruption buffer (PBS 1×,
0.05% Tween-20, 2.5% Triton X-100 and 1% Trypan
blue). Galectin-1 concentration was determined by an in
house ELISA assay specific for galectin-1.
Virus production and infection assay
HIV-1-based viruses pseudotyped with the HTLV-I envelope protein were prepared as previously described [54].
Briefly, 293T cells were cotransfected with 13 μg of the
envelope-defective luciferase-expressing HIV-1 proviral
clone pNL4.3L+E-Vpr+ and 26 μg of pSV HTLV-I env by
calcium phosphate coprecipitation. The cells were washed
with PBS 1× 16 hours after transfection and incubated
another 24 hours. Supernatants were then filtered
through a 0.22 μm-pore-size filter to remove cells and cellular debris. Viral preparations were stored at -85°C until
needed. Virus particles were titrated through the use of a
sandwich ELISA specific for the HIV-1 p24 capsid protein
[55]. Pseudotyped virions were subsequently used in
infection experiments of Jurkat and PBMCs. Cells were
initially incubated with various concentrations of galectin-1 (ranging from 0 to 4 μM) for 30 minutes in the
absence or presence of 50 mM lactose and then infected
with luciferase-encoding HTLV-I env-pseudotyped viruses
(10 ng of p24 per 1 × 105 cells) for 48 hours at 37°C
before lysis. In certain experiments, 24 hours after transfection, TNF-α was added at a concentration of 10 ng/ml.
Luciferase activity was next measured as previously
described [53]. Experiments were conducted in triplicates
and luciferase activity represents the average value +/standard deviation.
Co-culture assays
Jurkat cells were transfected with pHTLV-Luc by electroporation as described above. HTLV-I-infected C91-PL cells (1
× 105) were then added to an equal number of transfected
Jurkat cells in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. Galectin-1 was
added in various concentrations (ranging from 0 to 4 μM)
in the absence or presence of 50 mM lactose for 24 hours
at 37°C before lysis and quantification of luciferase activity. As a control, transfected cells were similarly incubated
with supernatant of C91-PL cells harvested after a 24 hour
incubation at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and filtered through a 0.22 μM filter. Values are expressed as the
average luciferase activity +/- standard deviation calculated from triplicates.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out according to the methods outlined in Zar (1984) [56]. Homoscedasticity were
determined using Fmax. When homoscedasticity assumptions were met, means were compared using Student's t
test, or a single factor ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons when more that two means were considered. When homoscedasticity assumptions were not
met, means were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis single
factor ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons when more than two means were considered. P values of less than 0.05 were deemed statistically significant,
whereas p values lower than 0.01 were considered highly
significant. Computations were carried out using GraphPad PRISM version 3.03 statistical software.

Results
Galectin-1 is more strongly expressed in HTLV-I-infected T
cells than in non-infected T cells
Previous studies have suggested that expression of various
genes are positively modulated in HTLV-I-infected cells
[19,57]. In order to determine whether galectin-1 expression is indeed altered in HTLV-I-infected cells, RT-PCR
experiments were performed to compare the level of
galectin-1 gene expression between non infected human T
cells and HTLV-I-infected human T cells. Sequence-specific primers were derived from two different exons to
insure that amplified products were derived from cDNA
and not contaminating genomic DNA. As presented in
Figure 1, results showed that galectin-1 was expressed in
all HTLV-I-infected cell lines studied in contrast to noninfected T cell lines in which galectin-1 mRNA expression
was either undetectable or slightly expressed. These results
hence suggested a possible association between HTLV-I
infection of T cells and increased expression of galectin-1.
Tax induces galectin-1 expression
As some of the tested HTLV-I-infected cells have been
reported to only express the viral Tax protein, we then
looked if Tax expression indeed could modulate galectin
mRNA levels. 293T cells were transfected with either a vector containing a complete HTLV-I proviral genome (i.e.
K30), or expression vectors coding for Tax WT or Tax
mutants defective in their ability to activate transcription
factors NF-κB, SRF and/or CREB. Galectin-1 expression
was then analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2A,
transfection of the K30 proviral DNA led to an induction
in the expression of galectin-1. In addition, comparable
induced levels of galectin-1 mRNA were observed in 293T
cells expressing wild-type Tax and both Tax mutants defective for CREB and SRF activation (Tax 703 and Tax Δ3). In
contrast, cells that were transfected with the Tax M22
(deficient in NF-κB activation) expression vector did not
demonstrate a significant difference in galectin-1 mRNA
levels when compared to cells transfected with the control

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/105

vector (Figure 2A). As RT-PCR experiments further show
that cells expressed similar levels of Tax, this difference in
upregulation of galectin-1 mRNA level was not due to differences in the expression level of the different Tax proteins in transfected 293T cells. In order to confirm these
results, RNA from 293T cells transfected with the various
Tax expression vectors were quantitatively analysed for
galectin-1 expression by real-time RT-PCR. Results presented in Figure 2B again revealed an important decrease
in Tax M22-mediated activation of galectin-1 expression
while other Tax mutants demonstrated a comparable
upregulation to the one measured with wild-type Tax.
Next, RT-PCR analyses were performed in a more representative context, i.e T cell lines. Hence, the wild-type Tax
expression vector was transfected in CEM-T4 and SupT1 T
cell lines and analysed by RT-PCR for galectin-1 expression. As denoted in Figure 2C, Tax expression indeed
increased the expression of galectin-1 in both T cell lines.
As the data suggest that HTLV-I Tax induces the expression
of galectin-1 in non-T and T cell lines, it is likely that Tax
plays a role in the modulation of galectin-1 mRNA levels
in HTLV-I-infected cell lines.
Tax induces transcription from the galectin-1 promoter
To determine whether the effect of Tax on galectin-1 expression resulted from direct activation of transcription from the
galectin-1 promoter, two different luciferase-encoding vectors driven by the human galectin-1 promoter were constructed. Two fragments of 0.5 kbp and 1.2 kbp containing
the transcription initiation site deduced from sequence
homology with the mouse galectin-1 gene were derived from
the human galectin-1 promoter region. Both fragments were
cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene of the pGL3Basic vector. Before determining the effect of Tax on these
constructs, the Tax M22 expression vector was first tested in
the context of Jurkat cells to see if it was specifically deficient
in activating NF-κB (Figure 3A). These results indeed confirmed previous studies in Jurkat cells: Tax M22 was only
defective in activating NF-κB unlike Tax 703, which was
comparable to wild-type Tax for NF-κB activation but greatly
affected in its capacity to activate both SRF and CREB (the latter being tested with the HTLV-I LTR-driven reporter construct mainly responsive to CREB activation). As Tax M22
was behaving as expected in the Jurkat T cell line, the two
galectin-1 promoter constructs were next cotransfected with
Tax WT or Tax M22 expression vectors along with pActinLacZ into CEM-T4, Jurkat E6.1 and SupT1 T cell lines and
promoter activity was then evaluated by luciferase activity
after normalisation (Figure 3B, C). When compared to cells
transfected with the control vector, the 0.5 kb galectin-1 promoter construct demonstrated an increase of 10- to 15-fold
following expression of Tax WT while Tax M22 expression
led to a modest 2 to 4-fold induction (Figure 3B). For the 1.2

Comparative analysis of galectin-1 expression in different uninfected T cell lines and HTLV-I chronically-infected cell lines
Comparative analysis of galectin-1 expression in different uninfected T cell lines and HTLV-I chronicallyinfected cell lines. Galectin-1 mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR analyses on total RNA isolated from non-infected
(A2.01, CEM-T4, HSB-2, JurkatE6.1, Molt-4, PM1, and Sup T1) and chronically HTLV-I-infected cells (C8166-45, C91-PL, MJ,
MT2 and S1T). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Expression of β-actin mRNA served as
an internal control for normalization.

kb galectin-1 promoter construct, expression of TaxWT led to
a 10- to 35-fold increase in promoter activity compared to 2
to 6 fold activation when the TaxM22 expression vector was
transfected (Figure 3C). These results suggested that the viral
protein Tax upregulates transcription from the galectin-1
promoter region, which likely accounts for the observed
increase in galectin-1 mRNA levels in both HTLV-I-infected
cells and cells transfected with the Tax expression vector.
Lower induction of the galectin-1 promoter by TaxM22,
which is deficient for NF-κB activation, raised the possibility that this transcription factor was crucial for Taxmediated increase in galectin-1 expression. However, Jurkat cells transfected with the 1.2 kb galectin-1 promoter
construct did not show higher luciferase activity upon
stimulation with two known potent NF-κB activating
agents, PMA and TNF-α, thereby strongly suggesting that
NF-κB was not involved in the modulation of galectin-1
promoter activity by Tax (Figure 3D). As no known NFκB-binding sites have been identified from galectin-1 promoter sequence analyses, these results strongly hint on the
involvement of a Tax-activated transcription factor different from NF-κB in galectin-1 expression.
Galectin-1 is more abundant in the supernatant of HTLV-I
chronically infected T cell lines than in the supernatant of
non-infected cells
As we have demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected cell lines
express higher levels of galectin-1 mRNA, we next studied
whether these cells produced more extracellular galectin-

1. Figure 4 indeed shows that HTLV-I-infected T cell lines
released 13 to 50 times higher levels of extracellular galectin-1 than the average level produced by uninfected T cell
lines. Interestingly, the S1T T cell line demonstrated the
lowest level of extracellular galectin-1 and is known to
poorly express Tax.
Together, the data suggest that mRNA and secretion of
galectin-1 were both upregulated in cells chronically
infected with HTLV-I.
Galectin-1 increases the infectivity of pseudotyped viruses
As galectin-1 can stabilize cell-to-cell and cell-virus interactions by cross-linking different entities, we studied
whether extracellular galectin-1 could facilitate HTLV-I
infection. To initiate this study, Jurkat E6.1 cells were first
infected with luciferase-expressing HIV virions pseudotyped with the HTLV-I gp46 envelope in the presence of
various concentrations of purified galectin-1 (0–4 μM) for
48 hours; luciferase activity was then measured. The use of
HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped virions that can express luciferase allows us to detect a single round of infection and
although different from wild-type HTLV-I virions, it
should be representative of the type of interactions and
fusogenic activities of gp46 occurring on the surface of
HTLV-I virions upon infection. Infection of Jurkat E6.1
cells by the pseudotyped virions was increased by 1.6 fold
in the presence of 2 μM of galectin-1, an increase which
was statistically significant (F = 6.764, p = 0.0138) (Figure
5A). Lactose, an inhibitor of galectin-1, inhibited this

galectin-1-promoting effect on HTLV-I infectivity, suggesting that the carbohydrate binding activity of this protein
is involved in this increase. In order to increase the luciferase signal, infection of Jurkat cells were also conducted
in the presence of the LTR activating agent TNF-α. Results
depicted in Figure 5B again demonstrated a highly significant (t = 5, p = 0.0069) positive effect of galectin-1 on
infectivity of gp46-pseudotyped virions.
A more physiological model was also used to study the
impact of soluble galectin-1 on infection by HTLV-I pseudotyped virus. PBMCs isolated from a healthy donor were
stimulated with IL-2 and PHA-L for 72 hours and, after
washing, were then similarly treated upon infection by the
HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped virions. The infection of

PBMCs by pseudotyped virions was increased by 1.8 fold
in the presence of 4 μM of galectin-1 (Figure 5C). The positive modulation on virus infection was determined to be
statistically significant (F = 4.364, p = 0.0425).
To eliminate the possibility that galectin-1 was positively
modulating LTR activity of the integrated proviral DNA of
our gp46-pseudotyped virions, Jurkat cells were transfected with a vector containing the luciferase reporter gene
under the control of the HIV-1 LTR, after which different
concentrations of galectin-1 (0–4 μM) was added. Measurement of luciferase activity demonstrated that the presence of galectin-1 had no impact on the transcription
levels dependent on the HIV-1 LTR (data not shown).

with either pNF-κB-Luc, pHTLV-Luc or pSRE-Luc (7.5 μg) along with pHβPr.1neo (control vector) or expression vectors for
Tax WT, Tax M22 or Tax 703 (7.5 μg) and pActin-LacZ (5 μg). B,C. Jurkat, CEM-T4 and Sup T1 T cell lines were co-transfected with pHβPr.1neo (control vector) or expression vectors for Tax WT or Tax M22 (7.5 μg), the galectin-1 promoter
reporter constructs pGL3-gal-1 0.5 kb (B) or pGL3-gal-1 1.2 kb (C) (7.5 μg) and pActin-LacZ (5 μg). D. Jurkat cells were
transfected with pNF-κB-Luc or pGL3-gal-1 1.2 kb (15 μg). After transfection (24 hours), cells were either left untreated or
stimulated with PMA or TNF-α for 8 hours. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined 48 hours after transfection as described in Materials and Methods. In panels A, B and C, luciferase activity was normalized on the basis of the β-galactosidase activity. The results represent the mean of three independent transfections +/- standard deviations (*p < 0.05; **p <
0.01).

Hence, these results show that extracellular galectin-1
increases infection of a T cell line and PBMCs by free
HTLV-I gp46-pseudotyped viruses and that this increase
relies on the binding of cell/virus surface carbohydrates by
the galectin-1 CRD.
Effect of galectin-1 on gp46-mediated cell fusion in a coculture assay
To study whether galectin-1 can possibly facilitate cell
fusion events, a co-culture system allowing a quantitative
evaluation of cell fusion by luciferase assay was used [58].
This cell line model provided another useful system to

assess the gp46-mediated fusion and was thus used to further confirm the results obtained with the gp46-pseudotyped virions. Our results had previously strongly
suggested that this induction of luciferase activity could
not be attributed to HTLV-I infection following cell-to-cell
contact, but was rather involving cytoplasmic exchange
likely mediated by the fusogenic capacity of gp46. Briefly,
Jurkat E6.1 cells were transfected with pHTLV-Luc containing the HTLV-I LTR upstream of the luciferase gene
and were subsequently co-cultured with the HTLV-Iinfected cell line, C91-PL. Cytoplasmic exchange can then
be estimated by assessing luciferase activity as Tax present

in infected C91-PL cells should, upon cellular fusion, activate HTLV-I LTR activity in transfected Jurkat cells. This
assay was thus tested in the presence of different amounts
of galectin-1 (0–4 μM) for 24 hours, after which luciferase
activity was measured. A dose-dependent (and statistically
significant at 4 μM; F = 4.192, p = 0.0466) increase in luciferase activity mediated by galectin-1 was noted (Figure
6A). Again, this induction was lactose-sensitive. Of note,
a small but non-significant effect of lactose was apparent
in co-cultured cells which were not treated with galectin1, suggesting a possible impact of endogenous galectin-1
in cell fusion affecting luciferase activity. As a control,
supernatant from C91-PL cells incubated in the presence
of transfected Jurkat cells did not lead to any significant
increase in luciferase activity either in the absence or presence of galectin-1, thereby ruling out the effect of extracellular factors acting on HTLV-I LTR activity (Figure 6B). In

addition, although we cannot rule out a contribution in
this signal from infection events by HTLV-I particles on
Jurkat cells, which would similarly induce luciferase
expression, previous experiments have suggested that the
first 24-hour time course preferentially involves HTLV-Idriven syncytium formation in the modulation of luciferase assay [58].
These results show that soluble galectin-1 can also
increase cytoplasmic cell exchange likely occurring
though gp46-dependent cell fusion events between an
HTLV-I-infected cells and uninfected T cells, again being
inhibited by the addition of lactose.

Discussion
HTLV-I is a poorly infectious virus and, in this regard, the
presence of various molecules that facilitate infection may

Jurkat cells (A, B) or PBMCs (C) (1 × 105 cells) were infected with 10 ng (p24) of HTLV-I envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses in the presence of different concentrations of purified galectin-1 (0–4 μM), with or without lactose (50

be important for viral transmission. Several studies have
been conducted on the implication of adhesion molecules incorporated by retroviruses (especially for HIV-1)
and their positive impact on viral replication [59]. Similar
studies have revealed that cell surface adhesion molecules
could affect the infection and syncytium formation
related to HTLV-I [8,13,60-63]. In addition, certain studies have also indicated that soluble factors were also possible modulators of the HTLV-I infection process [64,65].
Galectins are a family of proteins involved in cell adhesion but few studies have been conducted on their possible involvement in viral infection [66]. In the present
study, we have focused on galectin-1, mainly because of
its capacity to mediate cell-to-cell contact but also because

this protein is expressed by activated T cells and cells from
lymphoid tissue, a major site of infection by HTLV-I.
In this study, we have demonstrated that galectin-1 is
more strongly expressed and secreted in chronically
HTLV-I-infected T cell lines compared to uninfected T
cells. These results agree with the study of Pise-Masison
and colleagues, which showed through DNA microarray
experiments that galectin-1 gene expression is upregulated
in HTLV-I-transformed and immortalized cell lines [19].
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the viral Tax protein could be involved in the upregulation of galectin-1
expression. Generally, Tax directly activates gene transcription by the activation of CREB, NF-κB and/or SRF
transcription factor [67]. Using Tax mutants and known

NF-κB activators, we have shown that CREB, SRF and NFκB are not involved in Tax-induced galectin-1 expression.
This was surprising given that the Tax mutant TaxM22,
which is deficient for the activation of NF-κB, was less efficient in activating galectin-1 expression when compared
to wild-type Tax. However, no typical NF-κB binding consensus sequences have been identified in the galectin-1
promoter region tested in this study. In this regard, it
should be noted that Tax M22 has been demonstrated to
be deficient for the activation of another transcription factor namely NFAT [68,69]. In addition, as the galectin-1
promoter has eight Sp1-potential sites in its 1.2 kbp
region, six of which are shared with the 0.5 kbp region,
Sp1 might be such a potential transcription factor. Indeed,
it has been shown that Tax can interact with Sp1 and the
resulting complex is important for the transactivation of
PTHrP P3 and GATA3 promoters [70,71]. Alternatively,
Tax may indirectly induce galectin-1 expression by maintaining a chronic activation of infected cells. In HTLV-Iinfected cells, the constitutive expression of the LTR
allows a weak expression of Tax. Since activated T lymphocytes express galectin-1, it may be possible that this
chronic activation of HTLV-I-infected cells by Tax indirectly induces galectin-1 expression. Finally, although our
results argue for an implication of Tax, it should be stated
that other HTLV-I proteins might also participate in the
modulation of galectin-1 expression in infected cells as
elevated galectin-1 mRNA levels were detected in the S1T
cell line, which poorly expresses Tax.
As cell-free virus has very low infectivity, it is assumed that
HTLV-I infection is mediated by the interaction between
non-infected and infected cells, although recent evidence
has demonstrated that cell-free virus can infect isolated
dendritic cells [72-74]. We have previously demonstrated
that galectin-1 increases HIV-1 infectivity through stabilizing the virus adsorption step [35]. In addition, galectin-1
may mediate cell-cell interaction as galectin-1 can crosslink cells. Using pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, which harbour HTLV-I gp46 envelope protein and express the luciferase reporter gene, we showed that, in both Jurkat and
PBMCs, virion infection was significantly promoted in the
presence of galectin-1 in a glycan binding-dependent
manner, suggesting that galectin-1 increases the infectivity
of HTLV-I virus particles in this system. We also used a
quantitative system which mimics the mechanism involving gp46-mediated fusion in a cell-to-cell fashion. Again,
galectin-1 increased this HTLV-I-induced gp46-mediated
cell fusion showing that galectin-1 might also stabilize the
interaction between infected and non-infected cells. Of
note, no extracellular factors seemed to act upon galectin1-mediated induction of HTLV-I LTR activity in this coculture system as judged by results obtained with C91-PL
supernatant. However, at this point, it cannot be dismissed that other possible gp46-independent cytoplasmic

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/105

exchange modulated by galectin-1 might be taking place
and lead to this upregulation of luciferase activity. Further
experiments will be needed to assess this issue.
Although galectin-1 concentrations in our infection experiments were higher than the measured levels from the
supernatant of infected cells, in vivo conditions are likely
to differ from our cell culture settings. Previous studies
have demonstrated that lymphoid organ tissues are sites
where an important number of infected T lymphocytes are
located [75-77]. Given that these tissues represent a more
confined space, the concentration of galectin-1 secreted
by surrounding infected cells may represent a more appropriate environment and increase the concentration of
galectin-1 to effective levels. Indeed, we have previously
reported that the tonsil tissue contains 10 to 20 μM galectin-1 [35]. Moreover, the transmission of HTLV-I to target
cells has been shown to require the formation of a virological synapse following a cell-cell contact [7]. This synapse
is formed by the binding of host molecules between the
HTLV-I-infected T cells and the uninfected T lymphocytes,
thereby facilitating virus transmission. Galectin-1 may be
concentrated in the vicinity of this virological synapse and
more favourably act upon infection. A final issue which
needs to be taken into consideration in the current study
relates to breast feeding, an important route for HTLV-I
transmission. Lactose is an important constituent of
breast milk and therefore could be suggested to hinder the
action of galectin-1 during this route of HTLV-I transmission. Although one might then argue that galectin-1 is less
important for this mode of transmission, it remains to be
determined whether high lactose concentrations are also
present at sites where initial HTLV-I infection does occur
following HTLV-I transmission during breast feeding and
where galectin-1 could modulate HTLV-I binding.

Conclusion
In summary, our study demonstrates a bidirectional interaction between HTLV-I and galectin-1. The data demonstrated that expression of galectin-1 was increased in
chronically HTLV-I-infected cells and that this modulation of galectin-1 expression was largely attributed to the
viral transactivator Tax in NF-κB- and CREB-independent
manners. In addition, this study showed that HTLV-Iinfected cells secrete galectin-1 at a higher level than the
uninfected cells and that extracellular galectin-1 facilitates
HTLV-I infection and promotes higher levels of gp46dependent cell fusion. Given that our previous studies
had demonstrated that HIV-1 is also enhanced in its infectivity by galectin-1 [35,36], other retroviruses (or even
other enveloped viruses) could potentially be more infectious in the presence of galectin-1. Further studies will be
needed to assess the possible universal action of this βgalactoside-binding protein on the replicative cycle of various pathogens.
