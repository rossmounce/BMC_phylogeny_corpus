Abstract
Background: SNP data of goats of three Mediterranean countries were used for population
studies and reconstruction of geographical patterning. 496 individuals belonging to Italian, Albanian
and Greek breeds were genotyped to assess the basic population parameters.
Results: A total of 26 SNPs were used, for a total of 12,896 genotypes assayed. Statistical analysis
revealed that breeds are not so similar in terms of genetic variability, as reported in studies
performed using different markers. The Mantel test showed a strongly significant correlation
between genetic and geographic distance. Also, PCA analysis revealed that breeds are grouped
according to geographical origin, with the exception of the Greek Skopelos breed.
Conclusion: Our data point out that the use of SNP markers to analyze a wider breed sample
could help in understanding the recent evolutionary history of domestic goats. We found
correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. Also PCA analysis shows that the
breeds are well differentiated, with good correspondence to geographical locations, thus
confirming the correlation between geographical and genetic distances. This suggests that migration
history of the species played a pivotal role in the present-day structure of the breeds and a scenario
in which coastal routes were easier for migrating in comparison with inland routes. A westward
coastal route to Italy through Greece could have led to gene flow along the Northern
Mediterranean.

Background
The domestic goat (Capra hircus) has been an important
livestock resource since its domestication [1-3].
Even now, goats are of great importance in many developing countries, to exploit marginal agricultural resources,
and in developed countries, for the production of high

quality products and the achievement of sustainable
development of rural areas. However, breeding programs
and selection schemes in goats are less advanced than in
other livestock.
Archaeological evidence indicates a probable migration of
the Neolithic farmers out of the Near East and across

Europe following two main routes, through the continental heartland up the Danube valley or along the Mediterranean coast [4-7] crossing the sea to the major islands.
Archaeological data and radiocarbon dates on seeds or
bones provide support for an earlier arrival in western
Europe via the Mediterranean route rather than the "Danubian" route [8]. In addition, genetic data revealed a
weaker degree of phylogeographic structuring in domestic
goats compared to other livestock species [9,10], which
probably results from high gene flow at the intercontinental level, suggesting that goats have been extensively
transported [2,11]. This led to initial settlement in the Balkans and southern Italy [12]. A decrease of genetic diversity likely occurred during this colonization process in
Europe [13].
The Mediterranean Sea had a key role in the history of
livestock also in post-Neolithic times, when civilisations
like Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans and Berbers probably
introduced new species of animals and new breeds of livestock in southwest Europe arriving by sea. Some colonists
may have improved local livestock importing stock from
overseas [14,15], explaining the unexpectedly high diversity in breeds of domestic goats [16], the differential cattle
migration along the Mediterranean coast [14] and the
close genetic relationship between Tuscan cattle breeds
and Near Eastern breeds [17]. The role of the Mediterranean Sea as a natural corridor connecting the peninsula to
the Near East, North Africa, and southern Europe is particularly plausible for domestic sheep and goat, species
adaptable to various environments and easy to transport
[15].
A relative lack of breed standardization, herdbook breeding, parentage control and rigorous management may
have facilitated gene flow between geographically nearby
breeds in south-eastern Europe [18]. Gene flow may also
have a historical background as goats were actively traded
all over the Mediterranean basin during the Phoenician,
Greek and Roman periods. However, in some circumstances, gene flow is limited by distance and local management, which reduces the effective population size as a
result of genetic isolation.
So far, studies on genetic diversity of goats have focused
on Swiss [19] and Asian breeds [20-26]. Only a few were
relative to Mediterranean breeds [27-29], but all of these
employed mitochondrial markers. A wide-range analysis
of goat diversity in Europe and the Middle East has been
conducted using microsatellites [18]. The use of microsatellites, the most common method used today to estimate
neutral genetic diversity [30,31], presents disadvantages
such as null alleles, interpretation difficulty of allele calling and size homoplasy [32]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for estimating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/20

parameters such as population history and inference of
relationships [33,34] and they could potentially become
the marker of choice in ecological and conservation studies [35,36]. The use of these markers is promoted also by
a rapid development of genotyping techniques
[32,37,38].
We applied SNP genotyping to the study of goat breeds
from Italy, Albania and Greece to analyse genetic diversity
of goats in these areas.

Results
Population Genetics
A total of 26 SNPs identified as polymorphic on a panel
of European goat breeds [39] were used to genotype 496
individuals belonging to 6 Albanian, 2 Greek and 8 Italian
breeds, for a total of 12,896 genotypes assayed. Loci were
analysed to identify SNPs under selection in a separated
study [40]. Analysis were then performed excluding the
three SNPs in two loci identified as outliers, even if the use
of all the 26 SNPs did not lead to substantial differences
in the results.

Expected heterozygosity of the loci ranged from 0.016
(FABP4) to 0.495 (GHR), with a mean of 0.300. FIS per
population ranged from 0.017 (Liquenasi) to 0.197
(Capore) (Table 1). Observed heterozygosity of the loci
determined from SNP frequencies (Table 2) ranged from
0.012 (FABP4) to 0.463 (GHR), with a mean of 0.272.

*: Highly significant

The frequencies of the major alleles are reported in table 2
and ranged from 0.508 for the locus IL4 to 0.992 for the
locus FABP4. Except for IL2-1 and FABP4, showing frequencies of the rare alleles of 0.017 and 0.008, respectively, all other SNPs have a frequency of the rare allele
greater than 5%, as observed for the same loci on a different European breeds panel [39]. Also mean observed and
expected heterozygosity showed similar values to those
reported in the same paper. The frequencies of the major
alleles per SNP and per population are presented in Additional file 1. Some populations presented fixed alleles in a
number of SNPs. Particularly, Skopelos and Girgentana
showed the highest number of fixed alleles (5). SNPs
FABP4 and IL2_1 are fixed in 12 and 8 populations,
respectively (Additional file 1).
Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
over all populations (p-value < 0.005) were observed in
three loci (Table 2). Significant deviations from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each locus and population were observed for five loci. Locus CSN3 was not in
HWE in Muzake population. Locus HLA-DQA_1 was not
in HWE in Hasi, Skopelos and Argentata dell'Etna populations. HLA-DQA_ 2 was not in HWE in seven populations, five of which are Italian: Capore, Argentata
dell'Etna, Bionda dell'Adamello, Camosciata, Sarda, Valdostana. Locus HLA-DRB is not in HWE in two popula-

tions: Capore and Greek Goat. Locus TLR4 was not in
HWE in Camosciata population only.
Significant deviations from linkage equilibrium (p-value
< 0.01) were observed for two of the analysed locus pairs:
HLA-DQA_2 and GDF9 loci, PRP_1 and PRP_2. Loci have
not yet been mapped in the goat; HLA-DQA_2 and GDF9
are located on Bos taurus chromosome 23 and 7, respectively; the two SNPs on PRP are 458 bp apart on B. taurus
chromosome 13 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The loglikelihood based test of genotypic differentiation for all
populations showed statistically significant values (pvalue < 0.01) except for GHR, IL2_1 and FABP4 loci which
have very little informativeness.
The analysis revealed an overall FST of 0.063. That is, 6.3%
of allelic variation was accounted across breeds and
93.7% within breeds. Weir and Cockerham's [41] estimate of FST per locus ranged from 0.008 (IL2_1) to 0.144
(IL4), with a mean of 0.059 (Table 2). Pairwise FST values
are given in Table 3. FST estimates, between Skopelos and
Valdostana (0.19), Orobica (0.19), Camosciata (0.22),
Girgentana (0.18) e Argentata dell'Etna (0.15) populations, were higher than all other pairwise comparisons
suggesting the Skopelos as the most diverse population.

The Mantel test showed a strongly significant correlation
between genetic and geographic distances (0.40, p-value <
0.001, over 1000 permutations).
PCA analysis
Genetic relationships were also explored by means of
principal component analysis. The coefficients of the linear combinations reveal which SNPs most affect the component value. As for the first component, SNP IL4
presents extreme positive and SNP LGB extreme negative
values, respectively. Likewise, the second component is
mostly affected by the SNPs ACVR2B and MTNR1A, with
positive sign, and by the SNPs HLA-DQA_2, IL4 and LGB
with negative sign. To examine the overall pattern of population differentiation, PCA was conducted with the first
two axes, which cumulatively explained 52% of the total
inertia contained in the data set (Figure 1). Breeds are
grouped according to geographical origin, with the exception of the Greek Skopelos breed.
Genetic distance
Distance-based phylogenetic analysis was used to describe
the relationships between breeds. Table 3 presents the Nei
[42] genetic distance relating the 16 goat breeds studied.
The lowest distance values are observed between Muzhake
and Mati (0.017) and Sarda and Argentata dell'Etna
(0.018). The Greek Skopelos breed results the most distant one, very distant from all the 4 breeds of northern
Italy and from Argentata dell'Etna and Girgentana.

Discussion
Archaeological evidence showed that two main colonization routes took place in Europe after the initial domestication events in the Fertile Crescent: the Mediterranean
route and the Danubian route. Cañon et al. [18], using
microsatellites, report a decrease in genetic diversity as

well as an increase in the level of differentiation at the
breed level from south-east to north-west in European
goat breeds, supporting the hypothesis of migration of
domestic livestock from the Middle East towards western
and northern Europe.
Our results indicate that a highly significant correlation
between genetic and geographic distance exists. The pres-

ence of a geographic component in genetic diversity was
already reported in breeds of Northern and Southern Italy
in a previous study using SNPs [43] and it is confirmed
here in a larger area. Such a geographic component is generally not observed when using mitochondrial markers.
As reported by Luikart et al. [11] only 10% of the variance
assessed by mtDNA is partitioned among continents. This
could be due to the nature of the markers used for the
analysis, as suggested by Naderi et al. [44]. In fact, mtDNA
informativeness is limited because it does not detect malemediated gene flow and does not predict the nuclear
genomic diversity [45]. In the paper by Naderi et al. [44]
the breeds cannot be distinguished on the basis of
mtDNA, even if authors report that more than 77% of the
mtDNA variation is found within breeds, while there is a
low regional differentiations of haplotypes. At a regional
scale, the lack of geographic structure has been reported
using mtDNA in different regions [16,25,28] with the
exception of one paper [24].
From PCA analysis the breeds appear well differentiated
with 52% of the variance explained by the first two principal components. There is also a good correspondence to
geographical locations, thus confirming the correlation
between geographical and genetic distances identified by
the Mantel test. PCA indicates a westward route to southern Italy through Greece, that may suggest contacts
between Albania and Italian peninsula and between
Greece and Italian Islands (Sardinia and Sicily). In postNeolithic times, some colonists may have improved local
livestock as well as importing stock from overseas. The
transport of animals made by sea has been already proposed for cattle [14,17] and goats [15,18]. The role of the
Mediterranean Sea as a natural corridor connecting the
Italian peninsula to the Near East, North Africa, and
southern Europe is particularly plausible for small sized
species, as sheep and goats species adaptable to various
environments and easy to transport during human migration and commercial trade [4,11,45].
The Greek Skopelos breed results the most distant one,
reflecting the fact that it has been raised only in a island
and on the mainland of Magnisia. The distance is not due
to inbreeding as FIS = 0.122, not the highest value in our
breeds (max FIS = 0.197 in Capore), but to the lack of
admixture with other populations since long time and
possibly a natural selection versus local environment. The
Skopelos breed is largely differentiated from the other
goat populations in Greece, both morphologically and in
terms of performance. According to the inhabitants of the
Skopelos island, the goat used to live in an uninhabited
small island of Northern Sporades, and it was recently
domesticated. The breed is also said to have some relationship with the wild goat of the Gioura island, originated from the homonymous island [46]. Breeders, due to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/20

the favourable characteristics of the breed (high prolificacy and high milk production), established a breeders
association and applied a genetic improvement programme since 1981. Also the Orobica is very far apart
from the other breeds. Again the distance is not attributable to inbreeding (FIS = 0.030), but to isolation of this
breed in a very secluded valley of Italian Alps.
Among the Italian southern breeds, it is interesting that
the lowest distance is seen between Argentata dell'Etna,
from Sicily, and Sarda, original from Sardinia. The two
islands, although quite far apart, were important trade
posts of Phoenician, Punic and Roman traders.
The analysis carried so far excluded SNPs that were proven
under selection [40]. If we include these SNPs
(CSN1S1_1, CSN1S1_2 and LIPE, [39]) we find that the
overall distance pattern remains unchanged but for two
breeds of Northern Italy, Bionda and particularly Valdostana, that become closer to Orobica (Figure 2). This is due
to casein and LIPE allele frequency that are almost fixed in
these breeds for the same allele, while the average allele
frequency for the other breeds is 50% (Additional file 1).
Caseins have been the first genes to be associated to milk
production, characteristics and curding properties [4749]. It is noteworthy that milk production and cheese
making is a primary agricultural activity in North Italy

since historical times as demonstrated by the high frequency of lactase persistence in humans [50]. We hypothesize that converged selection for caseins and LIPE (an
enzyme important for cheese making as well [51])
occurred in Orobica, Valdostana and Bionda
dell'Adamello breeds making them "similar" for what
concerns their exploitation objectives.

Conclusion
Our data point out that the use of SNP markers to analyze
a wider breed sample, until now scarcely employed for
genetic population studies in livestock, could help in
understanding the recent evolutionary history of domestic
goats.
We found correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. Also PCA analysis shows that the breeds
are well differentiated, with good correspondence to geographical locations, thus confirming the correlation
between geographical and genetic distances. This suggests
that migration history of the species played a pivotal role
in the present-day structure of the breeds. Instead, the limited genetic similarity within main geographical areas suggests that breed differentiation could have occurred in
more recent times, after the main migrations.
On the basis of the observed gradient of genetic diversity
decreasing from south-east to north-west, and of the signals of the northward dispersal of populations from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/20

domestication centre, we hypothesize that coastal routes
from the domestication centre to Italy through Greece
could be a likely explanation for the observed gene flow
along the Northern Mediterranean.

Methods
Material
Blood samples of a total of 496 goats, about one third
male, were collected in farms spread over the traditional
rearing area of each breed (Figure 3). No more than 3
unrelated individuals per flock, from an average of 10
farms per breed, were sampled to reduce the relationship
among animals and to increase the breed representativeness. Samples were obtained following the rules of each of
the countries involved in sampling. Wherever possible, we
used part of samples taken by public veterinaries within
national animal health plans. A total of 16 breeds were
analysed. The breed names, their acronyms, countries of
origin, and the sample sizes are given in Table 1. DNA,
extracted by phenol-clorophorm or commercial kits in the
relative sampling laboratory, was tested for quality and
concentration by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide and compared to a commercial standard.
SNP analysis
SNPs characterization has been described elsewhere [39].
SNP ascertainment bias was minimised by sequencing target DNA in at least 8 individuals from different popula-

tions [39]. Large scale genotyping of all animals was
performed by outsourcing to a commercial genotyping
company http://www.Kbioscience.co.uk. Generally, accuracy greater than 99% was achieved. Quality control criteria were adopted (water as negative control, inter plate
duplicate testing of a known DNA, intra plate testing of a
known DNA). All the SNPs described in [39] were genotyped on our samples. In this investigation 23 SNPs in 19
genes and in one microsatellite were used (Table 2),
excluding SNPs showing a frequency >0.05 on our samples.
Data analysis
Allele frequencies were calculated using FSTAT 2.93[52].
Observed and expected heterozygosities (HO and HE,
respectively), Weir and Cockerham's [41] estimate of FIS
per population, of FST per locus and population pairs were
calculated for each locus using GENEPOP 4.0 [53]. The
same software was used to test deviations from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each locus and population and for locus over all populations using a Markov
chain of 100 000 steps and 1000 dememorization steps
and to assess deviations from genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) for each pair of loci using the same Markov
chain parameters as for the HWE test. We performed the
Probability-test (the "exact HW test").

Isolation by distance (IBD, [54]) has been assessed by
plotting the genetic distance among population pairs as a
function of the geographic distance between those pairs to
check whether more distant population pairs are more
different genetically, providing information on the
genetic structure of the populations and [55]. We applied
the Mantel test [56,57] implemented in the ade4 library of
R 2.6.0 open source software (publicly available at http://
www.r-project.org) to estimate the correlation between
pairwise FST values and pairwise geographic distance
using 1000 replicates to test significance. The matrix of the
geographic distance was computed using the coordinates
obtained with a global positioning system (GPS).
A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on
the covariance matrix of SNP frequency data to investigate
spatial patterns of genetic variation using the R 2.6.0 open
source software.
Nei [42] genetic distances between populations pairs were
calculated to obtain relative estimates of the time that has
passed since the populations were established using
POWERMARKER[58].
