Bacteriophage-encoded shiga toxin gene in
atypical bacterial host

Abstract
Background: Contamination from fecal bacteria in recreational waters is a major health concern since bacteria
capable of causing human disease can be found in animal feces. The Dog Beach area of Ocean Beach in San
Diego, California is a beach prone to closures due to high levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). A potential source
of these FIB could be the canine feces left behind by owners who do not clean up after their pets. We tested this
hypothesis by screening the DNA isolated from canine feces for the bacteriophage-encoded stx gene normally
found in the virulent strains of the fecal bacterium Escherichia coli.
Results: Twenty canine fecal samples were collected, processed for total and bacterial fraction DNA, and screened
by PCR for the stx gene. The stx gene was detected in the total and bacterial fraction DNA of one fecal sample.
Bacterial isolates were then cultivated from the stx-positive fecal sample. Eighty nine of these canine fecal bacterial
isolates were screened by PCR for the stx gene. The stx gene was detected in five of these isolates. Sequencing
and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene PCR products from the canine fecal bacterial isolates indicated that
they were Enterococcus and not E. coli.
Conclusions: The bacteriophage-encoded stx gene was found in multiple species of bacteria cultivated from
canine fecal samples gathered at the shoreline of the Dog Beach area of Ocean Beach in San Diego, California. The
canine fecal bacteria carrying the stx gene were not the typical E. coli host and were instead identified through
phylogenetic analyses as Enterococcus. This suggests a large degree of horizontal gene transfer of exotoxin genes
in recreational waters.

Background
Each year millions of people flock to the beaches of San
Diego County for fun in the sun, sand, and surf. Monitoring water quality at these beaches is therefore extremely
important to limit the possibility of illness from contact
with these recreational waterways. Through San Diego
County’s Department of Health (DEH), the Ocean and
Bay Recreational Water Program (OBRWP) is responsible
for monitoring the water quality of San Diego’s recreational waterways [1]. Most beaches in San Diego County
are relatively clean, with little to no advisories or beach
closures, but there are also areas prone to advisories and/
or beach closures because of known sources of pollution
[1,2]. Posted warning signs, a daily water quality report
hotline, and an internet podcast are some of the ways the

OBRWP informs the public about general advisories or
beach closures they have issued as a result of elevated bacterial levels in the water [1]. Typical sources of bacterial
contamination at San Diego County beaches include
urban runoff from storm drains and rivers, animal waste,
human activities, and sewage.
Contamination from human and animal feces is of particular concern because infectious disease agents like
bacteria, viruses, and protozoa are shed in the feces of
infected individuals [3]. Vibrio cholera (cholera), Salmonella spp. (typhoid fever, gastroenteritis), and Shigella spp.
(shigellosis) are bacteria found in feces and cause gastrointestinal disease [3]. Some pathogenic viruses that can be
transmitted through use of recreational waterways include
enteroviruses, hepatitis A viruses (HAV), polioviruses, coxsackie viruses, echoviruses, rotaviruses, and Norwalk
viruses [4-9]. They cause a broad range of disease, not
necessarily gut related, from hepatitis to polio to acute
viral gastroenteritis [5,9]. Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and

transduction frequencies in the World’s oceans has been
estimated to be as high as 20 million billion transduction
events per second [25]. It is therefore important to
understand the interactions between bacteria and bacteriophage in recreational waters and the potential for evolution of novel pathogens within these environments, to
be able to better understand the risk to the public’s
health when using these waters.

Materials and Methods
Canine feces sampling strategy

Twenty canine fecal samples were gathered at the
water’s edge at the Ocean Beach Dog Beach in San
Diego, California (Figure 1). The fecal samples were
identified visually in the sand and gathered carefully
with gloved hands using new disposable sandwich bags.
The samples varied in size, color, consistency, and
dampness. Samples were gathered and immediately
returned to the lab for processing.
Extraction of DNA from canine fecal samples

Total DNA was extracted from 1.0 g canine fecal samples
using the MoBio UltraClean Soil DNA kit (Carlsbad, CA)
maximum yield protocol. A previously described method
was modified and used to extract bacterial fraction DNA

Entamoeba are common protozoan pathogens that cause
cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and amoebic dysentery,
respectively [3,4,9-13].
Though these organisms are common sources of
waterborne diseases, their presence in these waters is
not easily determined. As a result, presence of fecal indicator organisms has been accepted as the factor in
determining water quality. Ideally, fecal indicator organisms would be good predictors of fecal contamination,
and therefore good predictors of the potential for
human illness. These fecal indicator organisms would be
present whenever the pathogens were present, would
survive in the environment as long as the pathogen was
present, and would be easily detectable and cultivable
from environmental samples [3]. Unfortunately, the relationship between presence of fecal indicator organisms,
bacterial and viral pathogens, and actual fecal contamination is poorly understood. This leaves public health
agencies at a disadvantage in determining the potential
risk to the public’s health when using recreational
waterways.
The various San Diego County water quality monitoring
laboratories currently use culturing assays (membrane
filtration, multiple-tube fermentation, Colilert 18®, Enterolert®) to assess presence of fecal indicator organisms–
namely coliforms [1,14]. These assays take advantage of
metabolic and enzymatic properties common to coliform
bacteria [3]. Many studies have been performed to evaluate if fecal indicator organisms serve as a good proxy for
monitoring water quality. Comparing cultivation tests for
coliforms to molecular tests for other pathogenic bacteria
and viruses, the studies showed mixed results–mostly indicating that relationships depend upon the water type,
exposed population, and weather conditions (see [15] for a
review) [7,15-19].
It is important to be able to have a broader view of the
bacterial and viral community present in recreational
waters because of their potential to cause human disease.
This environment may provide selection for new virulence traits that could be missed by current methods.
One mechanism for acquiring new virulence traits is
through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Bacteriophage
are common mediators of this genetic exchange and they
often carry genes that code for virulence factors. Since
the discovery that phage b from Corynebacteria
diphtheria carried the gene for diphtheria toxin and was
responsible for the virulence traits of C. diphtheria, many
more bacteriophage-encoded virulence genes have been
discovered [20,21]. Some of these include the shiga toxin
(stx) gene of Escherichia coli O157:H7 species, the cholera toxin gene (ctx) carried by ctxj of Vibrio cholera,
and the Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (sea) gene of
Staphylococcus aureus [22-24]. Considering the high concentrations of bacteriophage and bacteria in the ocean,

from the canine fecal samples [26,27]. Briefly, fecal samples were suspended in 1:1 (w/v) 1X storage media (SM)
buffer in a 50 ml conical vial and mixed overnight on an
orbital shaker set at 100 rpm [27]. The samples were
then centrifuged at 11,000 × g to pellet the biosolids. The
supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2 μm Sterivex®
filter to capture the bacteria. The filter was then aseptically removed from its housing and DNA was extracted
from the bacteria trapped on the filter using the MoBio
UltraClean Soil DNA kit (Carlsbad, CA) maximum yield
protocol.
Exotoxin and 16S rRNA gene PCRs and sequencing of
PCR products

Exotoxin-specific PCR was performed on the total and
bacterial fraction DNA of the canine fecal samples. The
primers and PCR conditions used in this study are as
described previously [26]. Exotoxin-specific and 16S
rRNA gene colony PCRs were performed on 89 canine
fecal bacterial isolates, as described previously [26]. Five
microliters of the bacterial isolate suspension cultivated
from the canine feces was used as template in the PCRs.
To control against contamination by PCR products,
amplification and all subsequent downstream procedures
were carried out in an entirely separate laboratory in a
separate building from where DNA extraction and PCR
assay set up procedures were performed. Separate and
dedicated equipment and reagents were maintained in
each laboratory. Also a negative control was included in
each PCR assay performed.
The stx and 16S rRNA gene PCR products from the
canine fecal bacterial isolates were gel purified using the
MoBio UltraClean GelSpin kit (Carlsbad, CA) to prepare
for sequencing. Sequencing of the stx and 16S rRNA
gene PCR products was performed by the SDSU MicroChemical Core facility using the ABI Prism® 3100 capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencer.
Cultivation of bacterial isolates from canine fecal samples

Canine fecal samples were re-suspended 1:1 (w/v) in 1X
SM buffer in a 50 ml conical vial. The samples were
mixed overnight on an orbital shaker set at 100 rpm. The
samples were then centrifuged at 11,000 × g to pellet the
biosolids. One hundred microliters of serial 10-fold dilutions of the supernatant were plated onto Luria Bertani
(LB) agar plates to allow for isolation of single colonies.
All plates were incubated at room temperature for 2-3
days until colonies were visible. Isolates were then subcultured into 96-well plates containing 150 μl LB broth
with 15% glycerol. These sub-cultured isolates were then
grown for another 2-3 days with aeration. Isolates were
stored in the 96-well plates at 4°C until tested in the exotoxin-specific and 16S rRNA gene PCRs. Isolates were
then placed at -80°C for permanent storage.

Bioinformatic analyses of stx and 16S rRNA gene
sequences

The stx PCR product sequences were identified by
BLASTN alignment against the GenBank non-redundant
nucleotide database [28,29]. The 16S rRNA gene
sequences were de-replicated using FastGroup II [30].
The representative 16S rRNA gene FastGroup II
sequences were used for the subsequent phylogenetic
analyses. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified
taxonomically by using the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) Classifier [31] and phylogenetic trees were also
generated as a means of classifying the canine fecal bacterial isolates. The stx sequences were also grouped
according to the FastGroup II analyses and analyzed phylogenetically to visualize their relationship to other
known stx sequences. The DNAPARS DNA parsimony
program was used to generate the phylogenetic trees of
both the 16S rRNA gene and stx PCR product sequences
[32]. The bootstrap method with 1000 replicates, 989
steps, at 580 sites was performed for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence analyses. For the stx gene sequence analyses,
the bootstrap method with 1000 replicates, 2822 steps, at
1278 sites was performed. Consensus trees were used to
represent the data and those groups at a relative frequency less than 10% were not shown.

Results
Shiga toxin (stx) gene detected in total and bacterial
fraction DNA and bacterial isolate cultivated from canine
feces

Twenty canine fecal samples were gathered from the
shoreline at the Ocean Beach Dog Beach in San Diego,
California. Total and bacterial fraction DNA was
extracted from the fecal samples and screened for the
stx gene by stx-specific PCR. The stx gene was detected
in both the total and bacterial fraction DNA (Figure 2A
and 2B, respectively). Bacterial isolates were cultivated
from the canine fecal sample where the stx gene was
detected. Eighty nine bacterial isolates were screened for
the stx gene and it was detected in five of these isolates
(Figure 2C). No PCR products were detected in the
negative controls.
Phylogenetic analyses of stx PCR product

The stx PCR products generated from the three FastGroup
II representative canine fecal bacterial isolate groups were
purified and sequenced (designated group 1-3, see 16S
rRNA gene sequence results below for description). A
BLASTN alignment of the sequences to the GenBank
non-redundant nucleotide database was performed and
they were confirmed to be the stx gene. A phylogenetic
analysis of the stx sequences was also performed [28,29].
The three representative stx gene sequences were grouped
with known E. coli O157:H7 stx gene sequences (Figure 3).

Conclusions
The beaches of San Diego, California are a popular destination for residents and tourists alike. Some of these beaches are designated as canine-friendly where people and
their canine pets are allowed to enjoy the recreational
waters together. One of these beaches is the Ocean Beach
Dog Beach. This location is unique because not only is it a
dog beach, but it is also an outlet into the Pacific Ocean
for the San Diego River and the Mission Bay recreational
waterways. As a result, this area is impacted by pollution
and often closed for exceeding bacterial standards levels
[1,2]. Important for water quality monitoring agencies is
keeping the possibility of spread of infectious disease from
bacteria and viruses relatively low. A paramount concern
is pollution by human and animal waste because it carries
disease-causing bacteria and viruses. With the close interaction of humans and animals at locations like Dog Beach,
a potential reservoir for novel infectious disease pathogens
may exist.
Exactly what kind of impact does the close interaction
of humans and canines have on this environment and the
microorganisms inhabiting it? Bacteria and their viruses
(bacteriophage) are abundant in aquatic environments
[33-37] and genetic exchange between these microorganisms occurs at a high frequency [25]. Some bacteriophage
carry exotoxin genes that, when integrated into the bacterial chromosome, can transduce an avirulent bacterium
to virulence. The influx of human- and animal-associated
microorganisms to this environment may be providing a
selective niche for the evolution of novel pathogens.
Many enteropathogenic microorganisms are found in
animal feces and examples of the bacterial pathogens
include Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholera,
and Escherichia coli. Certain strains of Shigella spp. and
E. coli cause gastrointestinal illnesses and can carry the
bacteriophage-encoded shiga toxin (stx) gene [38]. We
hypothesized that bacteria cultivated from canine fecal
samples collected from the Ocean Beach Dog Beach may
contain the stx gene normally found in the fecal Shigella
spp. or E. coli.
Canine fecal samples were collected from the shoreline
of the Ocean Beach Dog Beach in San Diego, California
and screened for the stx gene. The stx gene was detected
in one of the 20 fecal samples. Bacterial isolates were cultivated from this fecal sample and the stx gene was
detected in five of these isolates. Phylogenetic analyses of
the 16S rRNA gene sequences from these isolates determined these isolates belonged to the Enterococcus genus
and not the typical E. coli or Shigella spp. host. These

results suggest a unique horizontal gene transfer event
has occurred. One possibility for this event is that bacteriophage carrying the stx gene has a broad host range that
allows it to infect Enterococcus spp. as well as E. coli and
Shigella spp., or a genetic exchange has occurred between
the stx-carrying-bacteriophage and a bacteriophage that
infects Enterococcus spp.
Our results suggest that canine feces may be a reservoir for the bacteriophage-encoded stx gene and that
this gene can be transferred to new bacterial hosts. This
has implications in the development of new infectious
diseases. A further, in depth assessment of the genomics
of the bacterial and bacteriophage communities present
in these recreational waterways and the potential fecal
sources of contamination would shed more light on the

extent to which horizontal gene transfer is occurring in
these environments. Our study presents a first step in
examining the reservoir of bacteriophage-encoded virulence genes present in animal waste and the potential
impact exchange of these genes between atypical hosts
may be having on the evolution of novel human
pathogens.
