Why small males have big sperm: dimorphic
squid sperm linked to alternative mating
behaviours

Abstract
Background: Sperm cells are the target of strong sexual selection that may drive changes in sperm structure and
function to maximize fertilisation success. Sperm evolution is regarded to be one of the major consequences of
sperm competition in polyandrous species, however it can also be driven by adaptation to the environmental
conditions at the site of fertilization. Strong stabilizing selection limits intra-specific variation, and therefore
polymorphism, among fertile sperm (eusperm). Here we analyzed reproductive morphology differences among
males employing characteristic alternative mating behaviours, and so potentially different conditions of sperm
competition and fertilization environment, in the squid Loligo bleekeri.
Results: Large consort males transfer smaller (average total length = 73 μm) sperm to a female’s internal sperm
storage location, inside the oviduct; whereas small sneaker males transfer larger (99 μm) sperm to an external
location around the seminal receptacle near the mouth. No significant difference in swimming speed was
observed between consort and sneaker sperm. Furthermore, sperm precedence in the seminal receptacle was not
biased toward longer sperm, suggesting no evidence for large sperm being favoured in competition for space in
the sperm storage organ among sneaker males.
Conclusions: Here we report the first case, in the squid Loligo bleekeri, where distinctly dimorphic eusperm are
produced by different sized males that employ alternative mating behaviours. Our results found no evidence that
the distinct sperm dimorphism was driven by between- and within-tactic sperm competition. We propose that
presence of alternative fertilization environments with distinct characteristics (i.e. internal or external), whether or
not in combination with the effects of sperm competition, can drive the disruptive evolution of sperm size.

Background
Postcopulatory sexual selection can occur in situations
where females mate with more than one male and ejaculated spermatozoa compete for fertilization [1].
Because sperm traits have a direct impact on fertilization success, they are subject to strong postcopulatory
sexual selection forces in polyandrous species [2]. Theoretical models suggest that the pressures of sperm competition and cryptic female choice will drive sperm
evolution towards an optimal morphology [3]. In

support of this prediction inter-male variation of sperm
morphology in birds is negatively associated with the
level of sperm competition [4]. Similarly, in Drosophila
sperm length coevolves with the length of the female
reproductive tract as paternity bias is selected by female
morphology [5], and so an optimal sperm morphology
that fits with the majority of female reproductive
morphologies would be selected, resulting in reduced
intra-specific diversity in sperm morphology.
Sperm competition theory predicts that sperm size is
influenced by the intensity of sperm competition among
males [reviewed in [6]], with either larger or smaller
sperm favoured depending on the underlying assumptions [3]. Empirical studies support this prediction in a
range of taxa including insects [7], amphibians [8], fish
[9,10], birds [11] and mammals [12,13], although recent

studies have found no clear link between sperm size and
sperm competition intensity, when considered the phylogenetic relationships [14-16]. However, definitive tests
of the predictions from sperm competition theory using
empirical data have been mostly restricted to comparisons between related species with different levels of
polyandry or gonadosomatic index. Intra-specific tests
are possible where alternative male reproductive tactics,
in which consort males guard females and sneaker
males steal fertilizations from consort males, result in
biased sperm competition risk among males [17]. Previous studies have tested if differing sperm competition
risk leads to different sperm size between tactics, but
only one study supported the prediction that sneaker
males have longer sperm than consort males [18]. However, even in this study the difference in sperm sizes is
thought to be attributable to more variable sperm length
within consort males and due to a few consort individuals having unusually short sperm [19].
Aside from the effects of sperm competition, adaptation to fertilization environments can be predicted to
have an impact on the evolution of sperm traits. Species
displaying internal or external fertilization will employ
quite different mating strategies, and therefore sperm
traits. Differing physiological conditions in fertilization
site in terrestrial or aquatic mating habitats have been
shown to influence the evolution of sperm size in frogs
[8]. As sperm evolution theory has mainly been driven
by comparative analysis among related species, the
effects of differences in fertilization environments in
driving sperm trait evolution have been often overlooked
in previous studies.
The squid Loligo bleekeri is an ideal species to examine the evolution of sperm morphology under sexual
selection within a species, because it exhibits alternative
reproductive tactics that create discretely different fertilization conditions among males within a single spawning episode [20]. Females store spermatozoa in two
separate locations in/on their bodies, whereas individual
males transfer spermatozoa to one or other of these
sites according to a mating tactic related to their body
size, similar to that observed in other Loligo species
[21,22]; Figure 1a]. Larger “consort” males compete with
other males and court females using body colouring displays. Successful consorts mate with females in a parallel
position, place spermatophores inside the female’s oviduct opening, and guard the female until she spawns
egg strings. Smaller “sneaker” males show few malecompetition and courtship behaviours, but instead rush
into an established consort male and female pair, mate
in a head-to-head position and place their spermatophores on to the female’s external body surface near the
sperm storage organ (the seminal receptacle) located
below the mouth. Both consort and sneaker males can

achieve fertilization during a spawning event, although
fertilization success is higher for consort males [23].
Adult males show discrete spermatophore dimorphism,
where larger males produce significantly longer spermatophores than smaller males [24], spermatophore size
variation is small within individuals, and no individual
has both types of spermatophore simultaneously. Spermatophore dimorphism is linked also to female sperm
storage sites (large within the oviduct, small around the
seminal receptacle), confirming a tight association with
alternative male mating tactics. The life span of this species is one year, with a single and short terminal reproductive period [25]. Although it is not known to what
extent either genetic or environmental factors determine
male morphology or mating tactic, individuals are
thought to be specialized for one mating tactic and
ontogenetic transition from small sneaker to large consort is unlikely.
Due to the process of egg laying in L. bleekeri, insemination and fertilization can therefore occur in two sites
under different environmental conditions: a string of
eggs is extruded from the oviduct (inside the mantle
cavity) where it is exposed to consort sperm inside the
oviduct (i.e. internal fertilization conditions), and the
female pulls the egg string through her siphon and into
position within her arm crown around the mouth,
where it is exposed to sneaker sperm (i.e. external fertilization conditions), before she deposits the egg string
onto the sea bed. The different fertilization environments can be predicted to lead to different optimal outcomes for sperm size evolution. Here we investigate the
first example of dimorphic fertile sperm within a species, which is associated with alternative male mating
tactics and alternative fertilisation environments.

Results
Sperm size

To assess differences in sperm morphology among
males, we collected and measured the size of spermatozoa from males defined as consorts or sneakers. We
found that sneaker males produce sperm with a longer
head and flagellum than those of consort males (sneaker: head length = 8.47 ± 0.60 μm, flagellum length =
90.5 ± 7.20 μm, n = 600. consort: head length = 7.67 ±
0.59 μm, flagellum length = 64.9 ± 3.22 μm, n = 600.
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs): head c2 = 55.41, P <
0.01; flagellum c2 = 93.38, P < 0.01. Figures 1b, 2). The
size distribution of sperm stored in the seminal receptacle (head length = 8.56 ± 0.50 μm, flagellum length =
91.7 ± 6.95 μm, n = 400) and in sperm masses attached
around the female’s mouth (head length = 8.54 ± 0.67
μm, flagellum length = 91.8 ± 6.49 μm, n = 400) were
statistically indistinguishable from sperm in sneaker
spermatophores (head length = 8.47 ± 0.60 μm,

head: c2 = 1.68, P = 0.43; LMMs flagellum: c2 = 1.35, P
= 0.51; Figure 2). The size distribution of sperm stored
in oviduct (head length = 7.50 ± 0.68 μm, flagellum
length = 64.3 ± 6.55 μm, n = 400) was statistically indistinguishable from sperm in consort spermatophores
(head length = 7.67 ± 0.59 μm, flagellum length = 64.9

LMMs flagellum: c2 = 0.30, P = 0.58; Figure 2), suggesting that the sperm dimorphism is closely related with
the alternative sperm storage sites.
Fertility

To examine if both types of sperm are competent for
fertilization, we carried out an in vitro fertilization assay

using ovulated fresh oocytes retrieved from the oviduct
(Figure 3). Control oocytes that were not inseminated
(Figure 3a) showed no sign of embryo development
after 24 hours, whereas oocytes inseminated with sperm
collected from consort spermatophores (Figure 3b),
sneaker spermatophores (Figure 3c), and from sperm
masses (spermatangia) retrieved from the female’s oviduct or seminal receptacle (data not shown) showed
multinuclear staining as a result of discoidal cleavage at
the animal pole (Figure 3d). Success rates of in vitro fertilization reached 41-98% in combinations between the
same 8 females and either 3 consort or 3 sneaker males
(Figure 3e, f), suggesting that sperm from both male
types were capable of fertilization and genetically compatible with the females.

Motility and number of sperm

We measured swimming velocity of both type of sperm
and found no difference between sneakers and consorts
(consort curvilinear velocity = 167.7 ± 36.9 μm/s, n = 6,
1421 cells; sneaker velocity = 167.1 ± 33.5 μm/s, n = 3,
619 cells; Mean ± SE, Student’s t-test, P = 0.745).
The number of spermatozoa within a single spermatophore was different between consorts and sneakers: 1.46
± 0.12 × 1011 cells in consorts and 3.09 ± 0.13 × 1010
cells in sneakers (consort, n = 4; sneaker, n = 5; Mean ±
SE, Figure 4).

Discussion
This is the first reported case of discrete dimorphism of
fertile sperm (eusperm) exhibited between individuals
within a species. A few previous studies have suggested
that sperm morphology is influenced by different sperm
competition risks associated with different male mating
tactics [18,26], although the observed differences in
sperm morphology between tactics are small compared
to large variation within a tactic. Why is much greater

(and highly significant) divergent evolution of sperm
morphology evident among males of the squid L. bleekeri? First, it is possible that sperm competition does
not operate under a “fair raffle” system [27] between
consort and sneaker males due to storage site-dependent
sperm precedence towards consorts (between-tactic
sperm competition). As consort sperm, released in the
oviduct, have access to the oocytes earlier than sneaker
sperm, stored in the external location, sneaker sperm
might be predicted to possess increased swimming
speed (and so size) to offset the consort sperm advantage. Increased motility can be an effective strategy as
time from insemination until sperm-egg fusion may be
sufficiently long to allow sneaker sperm to compete, as
observed in the frog Rana temporaria in which sneaker
(pirate) males ejaculate onto a deposited egg mass after
it has already been inseminated by a guarding male, but
still achieve a mean fertilization success of 24.1% [28]. A
positive relationship between sperm size and swimming
velocity has been found in many animals [9,29],
although there are a few exceptions [10,14], and sperm

swimming velocity is positively related to fertilization
success in species both with internal and external fertilization [30,31]. We tested L. bleekeri sperm swimming
velocity and found no difference between sneakers and
consorts, suggesting that this factor is unlikely to explain
the size dimorphism.
A second possible explanation for dimorphic sperm
would be strong selection among sperm from sneaker
males competing for space in the seminal receptacle
(within-tactic sperm competition). Larger sperm would
have an advantage in occupying spaces within the seminal receptacle to exclude, and so outcompete, smaller
sperm [5,32]. In this case, the size distribution of sperm
stored in the seminal receptacle would be expected to
be biased upwards compared to that found in the original sperm populations. Contrary to this prediction, the
size distribution of sperm stored in the seminal receptacle was not different from that in sneaker spermatophores or in sperm masses attached around the female’s
mouth, suggesting that this factor also is unlikely to
explain the size dimorphism
A third explanation for dimorphic sperm would be
divergent selection pressures on sperm from different
male mating types as a consequence of adaptation to different fertilization environments (internal versus

external). Males adopting different mating tactics are
expected to maximize fitness in different ways, in the
context of reproductive energy expenditure as a trade-off
between sperm size and number. In some examples of
consort versus sneaker male strategies, sneaker males
produce relatively larger numbers of sperm than consorts
to offset the positional mating advantage of consorts
[17,18]. Contrary to this expectation, in L. bleekeri the
number of spermatozoa within a single spermatophore
was estimated to be ~5-fold greater in consorts than in
sneakers (Figure 4). The different sperm size versus number strategies employed by sneakers and consorts, running contrary to expectations under simple sperm
competition, suggests that fertilization environment (the
other major difference between sneaker and consort strategies) may be an important factor in determining the
sperm size/number trade-off in this species. Aside from
the obvious factor of water movement (i.e. risk of sperm
dilution), there may be many differences between external and internal fertilization environments (such as salinity, viscosity, pH and concentrations of gases and
nutrients) that may affect fertilization success by different
sized sperm. Although there have been a number of cases
reported, across diverse taxa, of species exhibiting alternative male mating tactics, there has been no clear

evidence of sperm dimorphism between sneaker and consort males [18,33,34]. The common factor among these
previous studies is that despite sperm from each tactic
facing different sperm competition conditions arising
from different male competition behaviours, courtship
behaviours, mating order, mating duration and sperm
expenditure [33], how and where released sperm meet
with eggs (i.e. fertilization environments) are basically the
same among competing males. Given the accepted
importance of sperm competition in the evolution of

male mating strategies (including individual and sperm
morphology, physiology and behaviour), it is likely that
sperm competition is also a strong selective agent in the
evolution of sperm and ejaculate characteristics in L.
bleekeri, perhaps in optimizing these characteristics for
each insemination/fertilization site. However, viewing
previous observations together with the data presented
here, it can be proposed that fertilization environment
has a predominant adaptive significance for sperm size
diversification in L. bleekeri and other species.

Conclusions
In conclusion, postcopulatory sexual selection under
strong constraints associated with alternative mating
tactics can drive discrete sperm polymorphism.
Although alternative mating tactics can create differences in sperm competition risk, in the squid L. bleekeri
they also produce different fertilization opportunities
conditioned by the internal versus external environment.
At the moment the mechanisms by which sperm polymorphism has evolved remain elusive. However, our
study illustrates that L. bleekeri constitutes a fascinating
and suitable model system for answering such questions
in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and sexual
reproduction.

200× magnification using a CCD camera (Keyence). DIC
images were analyzed with NIH ImageJ to measure head
and flagellar length. We measured 20 sperm per individual from 30 consort and 30 sneaker males. During the
breeding season, females often carry the sperm masses
attached by males to specific sites on their body. The
sperm masses found in different parts of the female
body (inside the oviduct, and inside and outside of the
seminal receptacle below the mouth) were isolated surgically, minced in a 1.5 ml test tube containing 200 μl
seawater and subjected to the same procedure described
above. Twenty samples were collected from each sperm
storage site, and 20 sperm were measured per sample.
Sperm fertility test by in vitro artificial insemination

Methods
Handling of animals

For sperm size measurements and bioassays, mature
Loligo bleekeri were collected at Miura (Sagami-bay,
Kanagawa) or Matsumae (southeast Hokkaido Island),
Japan, and transported to the laboratory at 4°C within
48 h. Adult males produce spermatophores, which are
cylindrical capsules containing mature sperm. Consort
males and sneaker males can be distinguished by measuring the mantle and spermatophore lengths. Spermatophore length shows discrete dimorphism associated
with mating tactics [[24]; Figure 4a]. To allay the suggestion that the two types of males may represent a
cryptic species complex, we sequenced a 776 base pair
region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene (Additional file 1). Haplotype frequencies and genetic distances among 27 consort and 29
sneaker males, sampled from both study populations at
Miura and Matsumae, show no significant genetic differences, suggesting no reproductive isolation between
consort and sneaker male populations.
For artificial fertilization experiments, we used live
mature squid commercially fished at Miura, Japan, in
April and May. Each female was put in a plastic bag
filled with fresh seawater, saturated with O2 and transported to the laboratory within 30 min. Squid were
maintained at 15°C in aquaria at the Misaki Marine Biological Station, University of Tokyo.
Sperm length measurements

Spermatozoa were released from spermatophores in a
1.5 ml tube containing 200 μl of seawater, followed by
1-h incubation on ice to recover the concentrated sperm
suspension. A volume of 100 μl of the upper layer,
which contained enriched swim-up sperm and less cell
debris, was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml tube and fixed
with an equal volume of 4% formaldehyde-containing
seawater. The samples were observed by DIC microscopy (Nikon) and photomicrographs were taken at

We tested fertilization competence in combinations
between 3 females and 8 consort and 8 sneaker males
collected at Miura. The following method was developed
by modifying a protocol previously reported for other
squid species [35]. Spermatophores were removed from
the male’s Needham’s sac (male reproductive accessory
organ, where mature spermatophores are stored) and
were stimulated to ejaculate the sperm mass. Spermatozoa released naturally from the sperm mass were motile,
and were used for in vitro fertilization assays. Mature
oocytes were obtained from the oviduct and placed in a
35-mm diameter Petri dish in the absence of seawater.
Approximately 200 oocytes per dish were inseminated
with 100~200 μl of sperm suspension followed by gentle
stirring with a plastic spatula. Five minutes after insemination, the dishes were filled with seawater and kept at
15°C. After 30 min, excess sperm were removed and
replaced with fresh seawater several times as a washing
step, and then incubated at 15°C. Fertilization success
was determined by the presence or absence of cleavage
planes in the animal hemisphere of the egg after 12-h
incubation. At least 50 eggs were scored using a stereomicroscope. Normal embryonic development was confirmed by Hoechst 33342 stain (5 μg/ml) of 4%
formaldeyde-fixed specimens after 24-h culture and
photographed under a UV fluorescent microscope.
Sperm motility

Sperm swimming velocity was measured by SMAS
(Sperm Motility Analysis System, Ditect, Tokyo, Japan),
which automatically tracks mobile sperm under the
microscope and calculates motility parameters (curvilinear velocity along sperm swimming path per sec).
Sperm number in a spermatophore

We measured sperm number contained within the spermatophores using fluorescence intensity of stained
sperm lysates. To examine the integrity and heterogeneity of nuclear DNA in the sperm population,

Iwata et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/236

microscopic and flow-cytometric analyses were performed. Spermatozoa released from spermatophores
were fixed with an equal volume of 4% formaldehydecontaining seawater (pH 7.9), rinsed twice with seawater
after 30-min incubation, and stained with propidium
iodide (PI) in seawater at a final concentration of 50 μg/
ml for 30 min. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that
PI-staining was specific to the sperm head and homogenous within the population. PI-stained spermatozoa
were then suspended in 300 μl of PBS and flow-cytometric analysis was performed by acquiring at least
15,000 gated events per sample obtained from consort
(n = 10) and sneaker (n = 9) males (Ex. 488 nm, Em.
607 nm; Cell Lab Quanta SC, Beckman Coulter, Tokyo,
Japan).
The sperm masses discharged from single spermatophores, by cutting the center of the amber ejaculatory
apparatus, were recovered in 1.5-ml tubes. Thereafter,
they were dissolved in 1 ml lysis buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 9.5, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 37°C with vigorous shaking for 12 h. The lysates were then diluted
(2- to 10-fold) with lysis buffer to obtain a series of different sperm concentrations and a standard calibration
curve between the fluorescence intensity versus sperm
concentrations. Analysis of DNA content in 100 μl aliquots of the sperm lysate was performed with a genomic
DNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, FluoReporter
Blue Fluorometric dsDNA Quantitation kit) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. A standard curve was
made using a series of lysate dilutions and calibrated
against the original sperm suspensions using a
hemocytometer.
Statistical analyses

Linear mixed models (LMMs) are used when analyzing
hierarchical data assuming normally distributed errors,
for example to account for repeat sampling of the same
individuals [36]. We constructed LMMs using sperm
size as dependent variable and category of sperm populations (consort vs. sneaker) as fixed effect. We also constructed separate LMMs using categories (consort vs.
sperm stored in oviduct, and sneaker vs. sperm stored
in seminal receptacle vs. sperm in masses attached
around seminal receptacle) as fixed effect, to confirm if
the sperm in each storage site on the female is associated with the alternative male mating tactics. Sample
identity (male individual or sperm mass attached to
female) was set as a random effect in the models. The
significance of the fixed effects on dependent variables,
such as mating tactic or sperm storage site, was assessed
with the likelihood ratio test, using the log-likelihood of
the test model (including fixed effect) and the null
model (without fixed effect). We used the ‘’lme4’’ package in R® 2.7.1 software [37] to run the LMMs analyses.
