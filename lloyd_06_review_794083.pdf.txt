Since the late 80s of the last century, I've been earning a
crust teaching and researching in the field of bioinformatics and molecular evolution. Recently, I have tentatively
and with trepidation crossed the fence between that familiar territory and the rolling unknown prairies of immunology. It is frightening out there: immune cells are
named for but one of the molecules that they express;
molecules with similar names have no phylogenetic relationship; the same molecule will have different names;
and the subtleties of self and non-self have me in an existential crisis. So I was delighted to get this book. I thought
that it would give an overview of my new cross-disciplinary field of interest, suggest all sorts of avenues to investigate, point me to the relevant tools, give some
background to their effective application and empower
me to stride confidently forward. Immunology can be
viewed, as the authors point out, as being as big as the rest
of biology put together; you cannot cover everything in
300 pages and we must allow editors and authors discretion to cover what they know best or what they feel is most
important. But it is idiosyncratic to give as much space to
the analysis of DNA microarrays (a technique that any
molecular biologist or immunologist would consider
using and which requires a good level of statistical competence to do effectively) as to explaining the mechanics of
alignment by dynamic programming (which could easily
be left comfortably within the black box of whatever
alignment tools that same biologist uses to compare
sequences). And sadly, my own area of particular interest,
the whole immunological dark side of innate immunity,
is essential untouched.

On the other hand, there is a workmanlike introduction
to information content in sequences, how this is calculated, how such data can be represented and how sample
size impinges critically on the accuracy of estimates. That
chapter moves on to explain, at an appropriate and
informative level of detail, Gibbs Sampling, Hidden
Markov Models and Artificial Neural Networks. Much of
the rest of the book looks at how to predict and classify
epitopes and other sequence recognition motifs and the
book is illustrated with hundreds of Logo representations
of this variability. The final chapter draws the rest together
to describe an integrated approach for using bioinformatic tools to predict antigenicity. Wherever possible, an
explicit connexion is made between the theory and algorithms and the research that has been carried out using
these techniques on real, and important, biomedical
problems. Accordingly, this is a good overview of how
computational techniques can inform our understanding
of adaptive immunity.
