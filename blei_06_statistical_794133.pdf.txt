Abstract
Background: The statistical modeling of biomedical corpora could yield integrated, coarse-to-fine
views of biological phenomena that complement discoveries made from analysis of molecular
sequence and profiling data. Here, the potential of such modeling is demonstrated by examining the
5,225 free-text items in the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (CGC) Bibliography using techniques
from statistical information retrieval. Items in the CGC biomedical text corpus were modeled using
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian model which
represents a document as a random mixture over latent topics; each topic is characterized by a
distribution over words.
Results: An LDA model estimated from CGC items had better predictive performance than two
standard models (unigram and mixture of unigrams) trained using the same data. To illustrate the
practical utility of LDA models of biomedical corpora, a trained CGC LDA model was used for a
retrospective study of nematode genes known to be associated with life span modification. Corpus, document-, and word-level LDA parameters were combined with terms from the Gene Ontology
to enhance the explanatory value of the CGC LDA model, and to suggest additional candidates for
age-related genes. A novel, pairwise document similarity measure based on the posterior
distribution on the topic simplex was formulated and used to search the CGC database for
"homologs" of a "query" document discussing the life span-modifying clk-2 gene. Inspection of these
document homologs enabled and facilitated the production of hypotheses about the function and
role of clk-2.
Conclusion: Like other graphical models for genetic, genomic and other types of biological data,
LDA provides a method for extracting unanticipated insights and generating predictions amenable
to subsequent experimental validation.

Background
In the design, analysis and interpretation of experiments,

biomedical and clinical researchers encounter the problem of evaluating and summarizing prior knowledge on

the subject under investigation. Traditional solutions
include examining articles in scientific journals, primarily
via PubMed access to MEDLINE, and interrogating WWWbased sources such as Entrez Gene [1] and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [2]. Consider a scenario
in which a researcher seeks enhanced knowledge about a
protein implicated in aging. Typically, the steps involved
in addressing this problem include interrogating structured data resources: searching protein sequence databases to identify homologs in other species, querying
warehouses of genomic information to determine key
non-coding regions and polymorphisms, examining collections of high-throughput molecular profiling data sets
to ascertain genes with similar patterns of expression,
probing ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) [3]
to uncover other genes with similar patterns of annotation, and so on. The entire procedure is accompanied by
examination of the literature to determine, for example,
classes of proteins mentioned in the same article as the
putative gerontogene.
Advanced techniques and sophisticated tools for interacting with structured data are well known, widely available
and include BLAST [4] for sequence databases, Ensembl
[5] and the UCSC Browser [6] for genomes, GEO [7] for
transcript profiles, and tools available from the GO that
allow navigation of terms in the ontology. This is less true
for the scientific literature. Given the time-consuming yet
critical importance of synthesizing information in text
corpora such as MEDLINE, the problem of making data
interpretation a more systematic and automated endeavor
is emerging as an important topic of research (see, for
example, [8-10]). The development of strategies capable
of providing a user the ability to assimilate and act upon
information present in resources of structured and
unstructured data remains an important goal.
The primary aim of biomedical text mining is the systematic analysis of document collections such as MEDLINE
abstracts and full-text journal articles with the goal of generating useful and unanticipated scientific discoveries (for
recent reviews of current methods and illustrative applications, see [11-13]). Examples of tasks addressed by text
mining methods include identifying literature relevant to
specific molecules, finding associations between genes
and diseases, determining putative functions for proteins,
and predicting regulatory networks.
A common approach to text mining is to treat the problem as one of natural language processing (NLP) [14].
NLP methods concentrate on the linguistic structure of
documents and make explicit use of syntactic, relational,
and ontological knowledge. In biology, such approaches
[15] have been employed for information extraction: the
task of ascertaining facts, relations, and entities in unstruc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/250

tured written language such as protein-protein interactions, protein subcellular location, and gene names. Tools
based on these ideas include Textpresso [16] and Telemakus [17]. Elsewhere, NLP has been used in conjunction
with LocusLink and GO to compare OMIM to MEDLINE
[18].
Recently, nouns extracted from MEDLINE abstracts tagged
with parts of speech were combined with knowledge from
other sources, Principal Component Analysis, and means
linkage clustering to find associations between genes and
phenotypes [19]. In general, NLP can be effective in circumscribed domains where linguistic knowledge is available and the terminology evolves slowly, is consistent,
largely unambiguous, and relatively simple. However, the
paucity and incomplete nature of such information for
biomedical corpora suggests that the full potential of text
mining in biology remains unrealized.
An alternative to NLP is to frame the problem from the
perspective of information retrieval (IR) [20]. Statistical IR
methods explore large quantities of information and
often involve capabilities for clustering, classifying, categorizing, summarizing, and detecting novel, similar and
relevant objects. The most successful testaments to the
real-world utility of IR techniques are Internet search
engines. Thus, statistical IR models of biological document collections could reveal rich, complex, and previously unappreciated relationships. Such results would
complement insights derived from analysis of molecular
profiling, protein-protein interaction, gene knock-out,
and similar types of data. With systematic deployment of
IR tools, the interrogation of biomedical corpora could
become as routine and indispensable a part of research as
analyzing genomic and genetic data is today. The analogy
is more than superficial and extends to the direct use of IR
techniques such as singular value decomposition in bioinformatics (see for example [21]). Thus, the common
mathematical foundations for algorithms that underpin
IR and genome analysis make it possible to envision integrated procedures that combine primary biological data
with biological corpora.
This work describes an application of statistical IR methodology to the analysis of a biomedical text corpus, the
Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (CGC) Bibliography (Figure 1). The specific model at the heart of this study is the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [22], a hierarchical Bayesian model employed previously to analyze text
corpora and to annotate images [23]. Recently, LDA has
been used to extract and analyze the topics present in a
document corpus consisting of articles published in the
journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [24].

C. elegans clk-2, a gene that limits life span, encodes a
telomere length regulator similar to yeast telomere binding
protein Tel2p.
Current Biology 11: 1706-1710 2001
ARTICLE
clk-2
An important quest in modern biology is to identify genes
involved in aging. Model organisms such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans are particularly useful in this
regard. The C. elegans genome has been sequenced [1], and
single gene mutations that extend adult life span have been
identified [2]. Among these longevity-controlling loci are
four apparently unrelated genes that belong to the clk
family [3-5]. In mammals, telomere length and structure can
influence cellular, and possibly organismal, aging [6].
Here, we show that clk-2 encodes a regulator of telomere
length in C. elegans.

In general, IR methods assume that the order of words in
a document can be neglected and view documents as
"bags of words." The loss of information incurred by
ignoring word order is offset by the ability to devise efficient computational algorithms that are viable for large
corpora. Although there is no theoretical justification for
casting a document in this manner, the practical benefits
and utility of doing so are considerable. The LDA model
considered here is a model for a corpus viewed as a collection of bags of words. It assumes that each word of each
document is generated by one of several "topics"; each
topic is associated with a different conditional distribution over a fixed vocabulary. The same set of topics is used
to generate the entire set of documents in a collection but
each document reflects these topics with different relative
proportions. Thus, LDA is a mixture of mixtures model,
i.e., the mixture components are shared across all documents but each document exhibits different mixture proportions. As a generative probabilistic model, the LDA can
handle unseen or novel data, i.e., a document that was not
one of the bag of words used to estimate the model.
The fundamental entities in LDA, random variables representing topics and words, are grouped together in such a
way to form a corpus, i.e., a group of groups of words. The

hierarchical nature of the model stems from the fact that
documents are modeled as probability distributions
across topics, and topics are modeled as probability distributions across words. A notable virtue of LDA is that a
given topic can occur with high probability in multiple
documents, and that a given word can occur with high
probability in multiple topics. Topics are treated as latent
variables, namely entities that are not present explicitly in
the data (a set of sequences of words), but are presumed
to be present implicitly and are to be inferred by statistical
analysis.
To analyze the CGC Bibliography, each item in the corpus
was recast as a bag of words and the resultant data set of
documents was used to estimate the parameters of three
different statistical IR models. The predictive performance
of the LDA model was better than that of two simpler bag
of words models, a unigram model and a mixture of unigrams model, trained on the same data set. The potential
of LDA in assisting biological studies was illustrated by
considering the phenomenon of nematode aging. In order
to illuminate the hidden factors permeating a corpus and
captured by the topics discovered by a trained CGC LDA
model, LDA topics were labeled via an automated process
that assigned words from the CGC vocabulary (corpus-

based labels) and GO terms (ontology-based labels) to
each topic. Examination of these labels indicated that the
CGC topics captured meaningful and plausible facets of
nematode biology. To investigate aging, topics whose corpus-based labels included many CGC words corresponding to the names of genes known to influence life span
were identified. For the two topics with the greatest
number of such CGC-based topic labels, novel candidates
for age-related genes were equated with other CGC-based
topic labels that corresponded to gene names (guilt-byassociation). Finally, an LDA-based measure of pairwise
document similarity was devised and used to address the
problem of searching a database of documents to determine topic-space homologs of a query document. Inspection of the "document homologs" of the CGC item shown
in Figure 1 resulted in enhanced understanding of the
biology of the clk-2 gene.
This work highlights the potential and utility of LDA in
organizing and exploiting one type of widely available
information resource, a collection of documents in the
form of free or unstructured text. However, researchers are
faced with a plethora of resources including images and
structured data such as molecular sequences, transcript
profiles, disease information, and so on. Thus, there is a
compelling need for techniques and systems able to condense, integrate and present large amounts of disparate
data to a user. This paper concludes with a discussion of
how the family of probabilistic graphical models, of
which LDA is a specific example, provides a framework for
integrating heterogeneous data and thus meets this challenge.

Results
LDA outperforms mixture of unigrams, unigram and
random models
In order to compare different models of text, a data set of
C. elegans related documents was created. In particular,
each CGC Bibliography free-text item was transformed
into a bag of words yielding a corpus of M = 5, 225 documents and a V = 28, 971 word vocabulary.

The generalization performance of three statistical models
was assessed: an LDA model (Figure 2), a mixture of unigrams model (right, Figure 3), and a "baseline" unigram
model (left, Figure 3). A model was trained using 90% of
the 5,225 documents in the CGC corpus and tested on the
remaining 10%. LDA and mixture of unigrams models
with K = 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 latent topics were estimated; a single unigram model was estimated because
such models harbor no notion of topic. The perplexity
(inverse of the per-word likelihood) of the held-out test
set of J = 525 documents (Equation 6) was computed for
each trained model. Figure 4 shows the generalization
performance of each model as a function of the number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/250

of latent topics. LDA has consistently smaller perplexity
scores than the two extant models indicating better performance on unseen documents. Since the perplexity of
50- and 100-topic LDA's is low and similar, a latent space
with 50 topics appears to provide a parsimonious description of the CGC corpus.
The ability of three specific models to retrieve a set of 842
aging-related documents in the collection of 5,225 CGC
documents was assessed: a 50-topic LDA model estimated
using all documents in the corpus, a 50-topic mixture of
unigrams model estimated using all documents, and a
model which ordered all documents randomly. For each
model, an average precision/recall (PR) curve was constructed by computing the ranking of other documents
given each aging-related document as a query, and the
average F1 measure was computed. Figure 5 shows average PR curves for the three models. The average F1 measure (standard error) for the LDA model, the mixture of
unigrams model and a random model is 0.30(2.86e – 06),
0.22(7.85e – 06), and 0.29(3.02e – 05) respectively.
Although the F1 values for the LDA and random models
are similar, the smaller standard error of the LDA model
indicates its superiority to the random model. In addition,
the average PR curves indicate that the LDA places more of
the age-related documents higher up its rankings than the
random model. Thus, of the three models investigated,
LDA is best able to retrieve the set of related documents.
Overfitting by the mixture of unigrams model results in a
performance worse than the random model.
All subsequent discussion of an LDA model and/or a mixture of unigrams model pertain to a K = 50 topic model
estimated using all M = 5, 225 CGC documents in the corpus.
LDA latent topics embody concepts associated with
nematode biology
A systematic strategy for clarifying the nature of the hidden factors permeating a corpus was devised and applied
to a CGC LDA. Topic annotation (topic labeling) is
defined as an automated process that creates a verbose
(compact) description of an LDA topic. The method
designed to annotate and label topics exploited the corpus-level parameter β (Figure 2). The K × V topic-word
matrix β collates the multinomial distributions over the V
words in the vocabulary that characterize the K topics. For
a given LDA model of a particular corpus, the kth row
specifies the topic-specific word distribution for topic k
and an element, βkv, denotes the likelihood of the vth
word given the kth topic. For each of the K = 50 topics in
the CGC LDA model, the V = 28, 971 βkv values were
ordered and used to generate a word rank versus topicspecific word probability plot. In every case, the 500 topranked words accounted for most of the probability mass.

Graphical model representation of the LDA model (left) and the variational distribution used to approximate the posterior in
LDA (right) [22]. LDA defines a distribution on a collection of documents in much the same manner that a profile hidden
Markov model yields a distribution on a set of (biological) sequences [31]. The corpus depicted contains M documents and
each is a sequence of N words. Open circles are parameters (α, β, γ, φ) or latent variables (θ, z). The shaded circle is the
observed word variable (w) and boxes (plates) represent replicates. The Dirichlet parameter, α, and topic-word matrix, β, are
corpus-level parameters sampled once in the process of generating a corpus. The topic proportions, θ, is a document-level variable sampled from αonce per document. The topic, z, is a word-level variable sampled from θ once for each word in a document. Formally, a K-topic LDA specifies a two-level probabilistic process that generates a document as follows, (i) a Kdimensional vector, θ, is chosen from the distribution p(θ|α), and (ii) words are sampled repeatedly from the document-specific mixture distribution, p(w|θ). Exact inference and parameter estimation involve calculating the posterior distribution on a
document p(θ, z|w, α, β). This is intractable because the latent variables are coupled via the edge between θ and z. The posterior can be approximated by computing the variational Dirichlet parameter γ and the variational multinomial parameter φ for
each word in the document. The subscripts m, n, and k on a parameter (β, γ, φ) or variable (θ, z, w) donate the m th document,
nth word and kth topic respectively. Note that the Dirichlet variable α is a distinct component of the probability model and not
merely an expression of uncertainty about a parameter. This differs from profile hidden Markov models where a mixture of
Dirichlet distributions is used as a prior for amino acid/nucleotide probability distributions.

Thus, these 500 high probability CGC words were designated topic annotation words (the same word from the Vwordvocabulary could annotate multiple topics).

applicable to only one topic. CGC-based topic labels were
equated with topic annotation words that were not
assigned to any of the other 49 topics, i.e., the 50 sets of
CGC-based topic labels formed disjoint subsets of words
from the CGC vocabulary. Ontology-based topic labels
are the outcome of filtering topic annotation words using
an external knowledge source and represent descriptors
applicable to one or more topic. The ontology exploited
here was the GO. The relationship between GO controlled
vocabulary terms can be depicted as a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). Each node corresponds to a term from one
of three aspects, for example, "exodeoxyribonuclease,"
"mitochondrial derivative" and "ethylene mediated signaling pathway" are exemplars of GO terms from the
"Molecular Function," "Cellular Component" and "Biological Function" aspects respectively. The structure of the
DAG underpinning the GO vocabulary defines semantic
relationships amongst terms so that, for example, the

node for the GO term "intracellular" is a parent of the
node for the more specific GO term "nucleus." Recall that
the topic annotation words for topic k are the 500 words
from the CGC vocabulary that best characterize the topic.
These 500 words were mapped to nodes in the GO DAG.
A node where a topic annotation word coincided with a
GO term was designated an explicit node. GO-based topic
labels were equated with the GO terms for both explicit
nodes and the children and grandchildren of explicit
nodes.
Examination of the automatically generated CGC- and
GO-based labels suggests that LDA topics capture meaningful and coherent facets of the molecular, cellular, and
behavioral biology of C. elegans. Figure 6 shows results for
four selected CGC topics (the results for all 50 topics are
available in Additional file 1). The hidden factors permeating the CGC corpus include one pertaining to sexual

(Topic 27).
Ontology-based topic labels derived from structured
knowledge for domains other than molecular and cellular
biology are needed to clarify the nature of some CGC hidden factors. Figure 7 shows topics that have CGG- but no
GO-based labels. Inspection of the CGC-based labels for
Topics 3, 29, 38, and 41 suggest the presence of hidden
factors that are concerned with scientific protocols and
procedures that are independent of any biological question, and that allude to evolution.
Interrogation of LDA topics provides insights into genes
influencing life span
A guilt-by-association approach was devised to identify
genes that may be involved in a phenomenon of interest
and the procedure illustrated using genes implicated in
modifying life span. A "gene word" is a word in the
28,971 word CGC vocabulary that corresponds to the

name of a C. elegans gene. CGC-based topic labels are the
≤ 500 words in the vocabulary that best characterize a
topic. If a number of the topic labels are gene words and
most of the genes are known to be associated with a specific phenomenon, then the other gene words can be
equated with genes likely to be involved in the same phenomenon. One factor influencing the biological insights
that can be derived from this approach is the human curation component of the process used to create the CGC
Bibliography, i.e., the individual who defined the set of
genes in the Genes record believed to be discussed in the
Abstract record. In addition to limitations in the data used
to estimate a statistical model of text, the LDA remains a
model based on the simple bag of words representation of
a document. While this LDA-based approach is not an
automated method for formulating sophisticated and
detailed hypotheses, it does highlight how a model that
ignores syntax and semantics can organize information in
a manner that provides a user the ability to exploit their
background knowledge and enhance understanding of
the subject in hand.
Table 1 lists the names of genes known to extend or
shorten life span and designated aging-related gene
words. Inspection of the two CGC LDA topics with the
greatest number of CGC-based labels that are agingrelated gene words suggests that akt-1, akt-2 and ges-1 may
be associated with aging. Figure 8 shows these two topics,
Topic 9 and Topic 12. In decreasing topic-specific word
probability and with genes listed in Table 1 in bold, the
Topic 9 CGC-based labels that are gene words are age-1,
clk-1, mev-1, daf-18, fer-15, clk-2, gro-1, daf-23, akt-1,
akt-2, clk-3, pdk-1, rad-8, sod-3, old-1, ctl-1, tkr-1, daf28, sod-2, sir-2, daf-9, cln-3, ins-1, age-2, and spe-10. The
genes depicted in a normal font have properties similar to
known life span modifying genes such as dauer (daf) phenotypes (Table 1). For example, the Wormbase [25] annotations for akt-1 and akt-2 include "protein serine/
threonine kinase" and "inhibition of both akt-1 and akt-2
leads to dauer-constitutive phenotype."
The mechanisms of action of putative gerontogenes suggested by different topics may not be identical. For Topic
12, the CGC-based labels that are gene words are ges-1,
osm-3, osm-5, che-2, osm-1, lov-1, pkd-2, daf-19, che11, unc-116, che-13, che-10, osm-10, che-1, che-14, pho1, dyf-1, che-12, and pkd-1. ges-1 is a gut-specific carboxylesterase, a molecular function not ascribed by Wormbase to life span modifying genes. Since many topic labels
are associated with the osm phenotype, osmoregulation
may be a feature that differentiates Topic 12 aging-related
genes from those of Topic 9.

Figure for four illustrative latent words

Results for four illustrative latent topics specified by a 50-topic CGC LDA model estimated from a corpus with 5,225 documents and a vocabulary of 28,971 words. Each panel shows results for a particular topic. The y-axis of the graph is topic-specific word probability (βkv)and words are arranged along the x-axis according to this likelihood. Only the 500 topic annotation
words are plotted since the remaining words in the vocabulary have negligible probabilities. The words displayed explicitly are
unigrams in the CGC vocabulary, including the names of C. elegans genes, and GO terms. The position of a word along the xaxis represents its rank; the staggering of words along the y-axis is not significant and is designed only to improve legibility. The
graph legend lists two types of automatically-generated topic labels. CGC-based topic labels are a subset of the 50 × 500 topic
annotation words that are unique to a topic and are words from the CGC vocabulary; these labels are ordered according to
decreasing βkv values. GO-based topic labels are the parents and grandparents GO terms of GO terms that are also topic
annotation words. Only GO terms that occur four or more times are given and are listed in decreasing frequency (MF: molecular function; CC: cellular component, BP: biological process). A CGC-based label is unique to a topic whereas a GO-based
label can be applied to one or more topic.

Exhibition of multiple latent topics by an LDA document
reflects the complexity of issues discussed in documents
By virtue of its superior generalization performance and
retrieval ability, an LDA model of the CGC corpus is a better statistical model of text than a mixture of unigrams
model. A distinct advantage of LDA is that although both
models are generative, an LDA document is the manifestation of many topics whereas a mixture of unigrams document is the product of only one topic. The subject matter
of (biological) documents is rarely limited to a single area
so the benefit of a CGC LDA is that words in a single document could come from, for example, a combination of
Topic 6 (sexual reproduction) and Topic 14 (chromosome structure and function). The mixing of LDA topics in
a CGC item was investigated by examining the documentspecific, word-level parameter φ (Figure 2). The variational posterior topic probability φn(zn= k) indicates the
extent to which the nth word is associated with the kth
topic. A value that is both large and significant is an indicator of the topic most likely to have generated the word.

The CGC item shown in Figure 1 is primarily a mixture of
two topics. Figure 9 shows the topics most likely to have
produced words in the document discussing the life span
modifying clk-2 gene (Table 1). Of the assigned words, 34
have posterior probabilities peaked on the aging-related
Topic 9 (Figure 8) and 23 on the general purpose Topic 38
(Figure 7). Three words are allocated to Topic 7, two to
Topic 19, two to Topic 13, and one to Topic 34.
Utility of LDA in formulating hypotheses: insights into clk2 function
Searching a document database to identify homologs of a
query document yields insights that can complement
those obtained from sequence-, structure- and functionbased analysis of genes and proteins. Prior studies of clk-2
revealed that it encodes a sequence homolog of Tel2, a
protein required for normal telomere length regulation in
yeast (reviewed in [26]). To enhance knowledge of how
clk-2 might influence life span, homologs of a document
discussing clk-2 (Figure 1) were identified by computing
the topic-space pairwise similarity score between this
query q and every CGC document t (Equations 2 and 3).
Although a given gene may appear in the Genes record of
many CGC items, the results described below are based
on analysis of document homologs of the single CGC
item shown in Figure 1. Figure 10 shows the three most

related items, CGC documents with the three largest  (q,
t) values. Figure 11 shows the three topics most associated
with them. The third best homolog is relatively uninformative: the text indicates a general review of aging
mutants and Topic 7 labels are general words pertaining
to life span.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/250

LDA-based analysis leads to the hypothesis that clk-2 may
have a role in coordinating signals between the outside
and inside of cells. Since the top two topic-space document homologs discuss nuclear receptors, clk-2 may have
a direct or indirect involvement in receptor biology. Topics 44 and 45 include the GO-derived labels "host cell
plasma membrane," "regulation of fgf receptor signaling
pathway" and "regulation of beta 2 integrin biosynthesis."
Circumstantial evidence supports a possible role for clk-2
in signal transduction and tissue biology. FGF-2 regulates
telomerase activity in human endothelial cells [27].
Integrins are cell surface receptors important in communication between the extracellular environment and the
nucleus [28]. The suggestion that clk-2 may influence telomere length via a mechanism not involving direct physical association with telomeres is plausible since a recent
genome-wide screen for Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion
mutants that affect telomere length identified genes with
very diverse functions (overrepresented categories
included DNA and RNA metabolism, chromatin modification, and vacuolar traffic) [29]. Recent experimental
results support a connection between vacuolar proteinsorting genes and telomere length homeostasis [30].

Discussion
This study demonstrates how a specific statistical IR
model, an LDA model, can be employed to infer the hidden factors permeating a biomedical text corpus and
exploited to synthesize and organize information about
complex biological phenomena. The results indicate that
despite being estimated from a simple bag of words representation of items in the CGC Bibliography, the intra-document statistical structure captured by an LDA model is
sufficient for the model to be used to enhance understanding of C. elegans biology. For example, analysis of the
corpus-, document- and word-level parameters of a
trained LDA model enabled the exploration and creation
of hypotheses about known and putative nematode
aging-related genes.
The CGC corpus studied here had M = 5, 225 documents
and a V = 28, 971 word vocabulary. Estimating a 50-topic
LDA model from such training data took 3 hours on a
Macintosh Powerbook G4. It should be straightforward to
estimate a model for larger corpora such as MEDLINE
where the number of documents is many orders of magnitude greater (M ~ 107) and the vocabulary size is only
one order of magnitude larger (V ~ 105). In estimating an
LDA, the computational bottleneck is the variational Estep, i.e., computing the posterior topic Dirichlet distribution for each document. Fortunately, this procedure can
be parallelized because given a model, the posterior for
each document can be assessed independently. Thus, it is
feasible for the techniques described in this study to be

applied to other corpora and to address questions other
than life span modification.
From an applications perspective, it is possible to envisage
a scenario involving the creation of a library of LDA models where each constituent model was estimated from a
user- and/or computationally-defined corpus of documents focused on a specific area such as "aging," "cancer,"
"yeast biology," "response to stress," "antibiotics," "HIV,"
"Parkinson's disease," "kinases," and so on. A query document would be compared to each subject-specific LDA in
the collection as opposed to a single model as described
here. This approach seeks to mirror a common strategy in
sequence analysis whereby a query sequence is rated
against a library of hidden Markov models (HMMs) [31]
estimated for domains of interest, for example, the Pfam

database of protein families [32]. Since seaching a database of probabilistic models of proteins in order to identify "remote" sequence homologs is known to be effective,
an analogous approach could prove useful in retrieving
distant document homologs.
The ideas discussed in this work can be extended and
improved in a variety of ways. Currently, the number of
latent topics in an LDA model K is a user-defined parameter but recent research has examined the task of choosing
K [33]. In particular, if the LDA is augmented with a nonparametric Bayesian prior known as a hierarchical
Dirichlet process, both topic probabilities and the
number of topics can be estimated from data. Under the
hierarchical Dirichlet process prior, the number of topics
grows as data are added to a collection []. The significance

The two CGC LDA topics with the greatest numbers of aging-related gene words (CGC-based topic labels corresponding to
the names of genes implicated in modifying life span). Each topic is represented the same manner as Figure 6. In the graph,
words in bold are the gerontogenes listed in Table 1.

and practical importance of this feature is that when modeling scientific documents, the nature and size of the corpus is evolving constantly meaning that discovering topics
is an ongoing task. Further studies are required to devise
rigorous methods for determining a set of words best able
to characterize a topic: the current approach is somewhat
arbitary in that corpus-based topic labels were defined as
the 500 words in CGC vocabulary with the highest values
for the likelihood of the word given the topic.

In the LDA model, topics represent entities that are presumed to permeate a corpus and these latent variables are
to be inferred by statistical analysis. These implicit concepts are assumed to be equally related to one another,
i.e., the topics are not organized in any way and form a
"flat structure." It seems reasonble to believe that, for
example, topics embodying the concepts of "DNA repair"
and "chromosome structure and function" should be
more related to each other than to a topic focused on

Genes: clk-2(9)
Abstract: An important(38) quest(9) in modern(9) biology(7) is to identify(38) genes(38) involved(9) in aging.(9) Model(7)
organisms(7) such as the nematode(38) Caenorhabditis(9) elegans(38) are particularly useful in this regard.(9) The C. elegans(38)
genome(38) has been sequenced(38) [1], and single(38) gene(38) mutations(9) that extend(9) adult(9) life(9) span(9) have been
identiﬁed(38) [2]. Among these longevity-controlling(9) loci(34) are four apparently(38) unrelated(38) genes(38) that belong(38) to the
clk(9) family(38) [3-5]. In mammals,(38) telomere(9) length(9) and structure(38) can inﬂuence(9) cellular,(9) and possibly(9)
organismal,(9) aging(9) [6]. Here, we show(9) that clk-2(9) encodes(38) a regulator(19) of telomere(9) length(9) in C. elegans.(38)

parenthesis when the document-specific, variational posterior topic probability exceeds a threshold, φn(zn= k) > 0.9. As illustrated by "telomere (9)", identical words within a document are generated by the same topic. Note that only the Title, Genes
and Abstract records were concatenated and processed to generate the bag-of-words document used to estimate the LDA.

Abstract: The genetic(7)
analysis(7) of aging(9)
processes(7) has matured(9) in the last ten(17)
years(7) with reports(34) that
long-lived(9)
strains(34) of both fruit(7)
ﬂies(7) and nematodes(7) have been developed.(7) Several attempts(7) to identify(17)
mutants(17) in the fruit(7)
ﬂy(7) with increased(9)
longevity(9) have failed(30) and the reasons(7) for these failures(9) are
analyzed.(17) A major(7)
problem(7) in obligate(9)
sexual(34)
species,(29) such as the fruit(7)
ﬂy(7) is the presence(30) of
inbreeding(34)
depression(34) that makes(9) the analysis(7) of life-history(34)
traits(34) in homozygotes(34) very diﬃcult.(7)
Nevertheless, several successful(7)
genetic(7)
analyses(7) of aging(9) in Drosophila(7)
suggest(9) that with careful(9)
design,(7)
fruitful(39)
analysis(7) of induced(30)
mutants(17)
aﬀecting(17)
life(9)
span(9) is possible. In the nematode(7)
Caenorhabditis(9)
elegans,(7)
mutations(17) in the age-1(9)
gene(17)
result(9) in a life(9)
extension(9) of some 70%; thus age-1(9) clearly speciﬁes(34)
senescence.(9) This gene(17)
maps(34) to chromosome(34) II, well separated(34) from a
a process(7)
involved(7) in organismic(9)
locus(34) (fer-15) which is responsible(7) for a large(7)
fertility(34)
deﬁcit(9) in the original(7)
stocks.(34) There is no trade-oﬀ(29)
between either rate(9) of development(7) or fertility(34)
versus(30)
life(9)
span(9) associated with the age-1(9)
mutation.(17)
Transgenic(30)
analyses(7)
conﬁrm(30) that the fertility(34)
deﬁcit(9) can be corrected(30) by a wild-type(17)
fer-15(9)
transformant(30) (transgene); however, the life(9)
span(9) of these transformed(30)
stocks(34) is aﬀected(17) by the transgenic(30)
array(30) in an unpredictable(9)
fashion.(9) The molecular(7)
nature(7) of the age-1(9)

remains(7)
unknown(9) and we

"locomotion." Thus, a model in which topics were themselves arranged as a hierarchy could prove useful and
inspection of the relationship(s) between topics might be
informative. The current LDA model represents a model
for a particular instantiation of a corpus. It might be interesting to formulate dynamic models of corpora which
sought to capture how a collection such as the CGC or
MEDLINE changes over time. In addition to theoretical
studies of their properties and behavior, such models
might be useful not only for biomedical researchers and
clinicians, but also policy makers, historians, and sociologists interested in the evolution of biology and its disciplines.

Statistical IR models are applicable not only to "traditional" document collections, but also to genome-scale
biological data. In one example of such an LDA model,
"documents" could correspond to genes, "topics" to regulatory networks and "words" to motifs. Since LDA does
not require mutually exclusive clustering, a given gene can
participate in several networks and a given motif can
appear in several genes. Merging this type of analysis with
that described here would result in evidential support for
the functional behavior and role of a gene being derived
both from primary biological data and from corpus-based
analysis. This capacity to fuse support from disparate
sources has been illustrated using a variant of LDA known
as "correspondence LDA" and in the context of automated
image annotation [23].

Conclusion

Methods

LDA is a special case of the family of probabilistic graphical models. This family includes a wide variety of other
models that have proved useful in biology such as HMMs,
phylogenetic trees, and pedigrees [34]. The graphical
model formalism allows such graphical components to be
combined into heterogenous, large-scale statistical models that integrate evidence from multiple sources. Doing
so would yield a system for facilitating the formulation of
ideas that could be interrogated and verified experimentally.

CGC document corpus
The CGC Bibliography (October 2002 release) was downloaded [35] and included abstracts from the published literature, "worm meetings," and the "Worm Breeder's
Gazette." Each CGC item is a series of defined records
(Key, Medline, Authors, Title, Citation, Type, Genes,
Abstract) and associated free-text (see Figure 1 for an
exemplar). In an item, the Genes record associated with
an Abstract record was added by a curator and so reflects
the personnel interest(s) and background of the individ-

ual, i.e., the list of genes discussed in the abstract was not
derived in a systematic, automated manner and according
to a fixed scheme and/or philosophy. For each item, the
Genes, Title, and Abstract records were concatenated. The
resultant text was tokenized by partitioning on the basis of
white spaces and punctuation. Variants of the same word
were stemmed to produce a single word by removing the
suffixes s, ss, ies and sses. A word was discarded if it was in
a set of 619 generic stop words that included ii, iii, iv, iv,
a, a., yourselves, z, and zero. The ensuing text was not
tagged, i.e., words were not annotated in terms of syntax
(parts of speech) or semantics (pre-defined class such as
"gene name").

(b) Choose a word wn from the multinomial distribution

A CGC document is the bag of words (vector space representation) obtained after tokenizing, stemming, and
removing suffixes from a CGC item. The CGC vocabulary
is the non-redundant set of discrete objects produced after
application of the preceeding processing steps to all items
in the corpus. Words in this vocabulary are unigrams
because phrases such as "DNA repair" are considered to be
two objects rather than one. The final CGC corpus had M
= 5, 225 documents and a vocabulary of V = 28, 971
words. The shortest and longest documents had N = 9 and
N = 261 words respectively. It should be noted that words
originating from the Genes record were not marked in any
way so neither the vocabulary constructed for the corpus
nor the bag of words representation of a particular document contained explicit knowledge of, or information
about the curation effort.

of β. The document-specific topic proportions θ lie in the
(K - 1)-dimensional simplex, θ = [θ1, ..., θk] where θk =

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model
A detailed description of the LDA model and attendant
algorithms can be found elsewhere [22,36]. Figure 2 gives
a graphical model representation of LDA. Consider a corpus of M documents, {w1, ..., wM}, based on a vocabulary
of words indexed by [1, ..., V]. A document is a sequence
of N words, w = [w1, ..., wN]. Each word in a document is
represented by a V-dimensional unit-basis vector in which
only one component is equal to one, i.e., a word that is the
vth word in the vocabulary is described by a vector where
wv = 1 and wu = 0 for all u ≠ v.

LDA generates a document according to the following
process,
1. Choose a point θ from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by α: θ ~ Dirichlet (α).
2. For each word wn in turn,
(a) Choose a topic zn from a multinomial distribution
parameterized by θ: zn ~ Multinomial(θ).

associated with the selected topic and parameterized by
β zn : wn ~ Multinomial ( β zn ).
The parameters of a K-iopic LDA are the Dirichlet parameter, α, and the topic-word matrix, β. α is a K-dimensional
Dirichlet parameter that determines the distribution over
topic proportions, α = [α1, ..., αK] where αk> 0. β is a K ×
V matrix that determines the likelihood of the vth word in
the vocabulary given the kth topic, βkv= p(wv = 1 | zk = 1).
The topic-specific word distribution βk β zn is the kth row

p(zk= 1 | θ), θk> 0, and

∑ k=1θ k = 1 .
K

The likelihood of an LDA document is obtained by marginalizing over the latent variables,
N ⎛ K
⎞
p(w | α , β ) = ∫ p(θ | α )∏ ⎜ ∑ p( zn | θ )p(wn | zn , β ) ⎟dθ .
⎜
⎟
n=1 ⎝ zn =1
⎠

(1)

The probability of a corpus is the product of the marginal
probabilites of single documents.
Inference and parameter estimation
Estimating the parameters of an LDA from data and calculating the probability of a document both involve inference or computing the posterior distribution of latent
variables given a document,

p(θ , z | w,α , β ) =

p(θ , z, w | α , β )
.
p(w | α , β )

The denominator of this expression, the likelihood of a
document, cannot be computed exactly because of the
coupling between θ and z (left, Figure 2). Instead, approximate inference methods are required for the LDA model.
Such methods include the convexity-based variational
approach used here [22], Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling [37] and expectation propagation [38].
Variational inference approximates the posterior by finding a lower bound on the likelihood of a document [22].
The family of graphical models obtained by uncoupling θ
and z (right, Figure 2) is characterized by the following
variational distribution,
N

q(θ , z | γ ,φ ) = q(θ | γ )∏ q( zn | φn ),
n=1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/250

where the Dirichlet parameter γ and the multinomial
parameters {φ1, ..., φN} are the free variational parameters
for document w. For the nth word, φn(zn = k) is the (variational) posterior topic probability for the kth topic. Optimal document-specific values can be found by
minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between
the variational distribution and the true posterior,

where θ dk > 0 ,

(γ *(w),φ *(w)) = arg min KL(q(θ , z | γ (w),φ (w)) || p(θ , z | w,α , β )).

approximate the true, but intractable distributions
p(zn|w).

The similarity between two documents i and j can be
quantified by computing the KL divergence between their
corresponding Dirichlet distributions as follows

(γ ,φ )

Estimating an LDA from data involves finding the Dirichlet parameter α* and topic-word matrix β* which maximize the log marginal likelihood of a corpus. A variational
Expectation-Maximization procedure results in parameter
estimates that are a (possibly local) maximum of a lower
bound of the log marginal likelihood. This alternates
between maximizing a lower bound with respect to the
variational parameters for each document, and maximizing the lower bound with respect to the model parameters.
An LDA-based measure of pairwise document similarity
The transformation of bags of words into bags of topics by
LDA provides a means to address the task of searching a
corpus to retrieve similar and/or relevant items. Wordspace representations of documents (high-dimensional,
variable length, vectors of discrete-valued features) are
converted into topic-space representations (low-dimensional, fixed length, vectors of real-valued features). In
particular, the variational posterior Dirichlet parameter γ*
(w) indicates the degree to which each of the K topics is
referenced by document w.

A new measure of pairwise document similarity was formulated using the Dirichlet probability distribution specified by the document-level LDA parameter γ (Figure 2).
Recall that the variational posterior Dirichlet distribution
for document d is Dirichlet(γd) where γ d = [γ d1 ,… ,γ dK ]
and γ dk denotes the extent to which document d refers to
the kth topic. A random variable θ drawn from Dirichlet(γd) has the probability density

where γi and γj are the parameters for the two documents.
ψ (·) is the digamma function and arises when taking
expectations of log θ.
Let  (q, t) be the topic-space pairwise similarity score
between a query document q and a target document t.
Here, this score is defined as the symmetrized KL divergence between the variational posterior Dirichlet distributions,

(q , t ) =

KL(γ q || γ t ) + KL(γ t || γ q ),

where the component KL terms are computed using Equation 2.
An alternative definition of the topic-space pairwise similarity score is the Jensen-Shannon divergence

(q , t ) =

KL(γ q || γ x ) + KL(γ t || γ x )
2

where γx = (γq + γt)/2 so that γxkis the average degree to
which documents q and t refer to topic k.
Given a database of D documents, t1, ..., tD, the task of
retrieving documents related to a query q was addressed
by computing the score between q and each document in

the collection,  (q, t1), ...,  (q, tD) (cf. searching a protein or nucleic acid sequence database to find homologous sequences). For simplicity, a "homolog" of a
document q is a CGC document td that has a high topicspace pairwise similarity score  (q, td).
Mixture of unigrams model and unigram model
Figure 3 shows graphical model representations of two
existing models of text. Like the graphical model representation of the LDA model (left, Figure 2), the open circles
represent parameters for the mixture of unigrams model
(mixing weights θ; word distribution βk)and unigram
model (word distribution β).

The unigram model contains no latent variables and each
word in every document is assumed to have been drawn
from the same multinomial distribution. Denoting this
word distribution as β, the likelihood of a unigram document is
N

p(w | β ) = ∏ p(wn | β ).
n=1

The three different bag of words models described above
were assessed by determining their respective perplexity
on the same set of test documents. The likelihood of a test
document p(wj) was computed using Equation 1 for an
LDA model (left, Figure 2), Equation 4 for a unigram
model (left, Figure 3), and Equation 5 for a mixture of
unigrams model (right, Figure 3). A model was trained
using 90% of the CGC corpus (4,700 documents) and the
remaining 10% (J = 525) used to compute perplexity. A
single unigram model was estimated and evaluated
whereas LDA and mixture of unigram models with varying numbers of latent topics were estimated and evaluated
(K = 5,10, 20, 50,100).
Precision/recall (PR) curves and F1 measure: retrieval capability
The ability of a statistical model to retrieve a set of related
documents was evaluated using a language modeling
approach [20,40]. Let ND be the number of "relevant"

documents in a collection of D documents, documents
that are related according to some criterion. Let NP be the

(4)

The mixture of unigrams model [39] assumes that each
document is generated by first choosing one of K topics,
and then drawing words independently, conditioned on
that topic. As in LDA, the K multinomial distributions represent an underlying semantic structure in the corpus but
a mixture of unigrams document is a manifestation of
only one of these topics. Denoting the mixing weights as
θ and the word distributions as β, the likelihood of a mixture of unigrams document is

⎛ N
⎞
p( z | θ ) ⎜ ∏ p(wn | z , β ) ⎟.
( 5)
∑
⎜
⎟
z =1
⎝ n=1
⎠
The LDA model builds upon the mixture of unigrams in
that documents are able to manifest multiple topics.
Overall, the estimated LDA word distributions are better
reflections of the underlying topics in a corpus, particularly in light of heterogenous documents.

number of these relevant documents that are present in a
list of P of these documents (P ≤ D). Precision,  , is the
fraction of documents in the list that are relevant and is
defined as NP/P. Recall,  , is the fraction of relevant documents in the list and is defined as NP/ND (  = 1 when
the list of documents and collection of documents are
identical, NP = ND). The F1 measure is the harmonic mean
of these two statistics,

F1 =

Given a ranking of the documents in the collection, D lists
of documents are produced by selecting the top P-ranked
documents where P = 1, ... ,D. For the dth list, the precision,  d, recall,  d, and F1 measure, F1d are computed.
The average of the D Fl measures for the collection, F1, ...,

Three different models were assessed by determining their
respective retrieval capability on the same set of relevant

the CGC documents from most (highest score) to least
similar. This process was repeated for each relevant document in turn, q1, ..., qND , resulting in ND rankings of the
CGC documents. Let Pi be the P top-ranked CGC documents for query qi. The number of known aging-related
documents in this list was determined and used to calculate precision and recall. The average precision (average
recall) is the mean of the precision (recall) value computed for each list P1,..., PND . A series of such average precision and average recall values were computed by varying
the number of top-ranked documents used to create lists,
P = 1, ..., D. A PR curve was constructed from these D pairs
of average precision and average recall values. The average
F1 measure is the mean of the F1 measure computed for
each of the ND relevant documents.
A K = 50 topic mixture of unigrams model was trained
using all D CGC documents. Given this model, the symmetrized KL divergence between an aging-related document wq and a CGC document wt was computed using
