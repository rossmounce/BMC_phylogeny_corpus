Abstract
Background: Social insects (ants, bees, wasps and termites) are considered as prime examples of
altruism in which individuals (workers) forego their own reproduction to help other individuals
reproduce. Such a behaviour is favoured by natural selection because the workers rear close kin and in
doing so enhance their inclusive fitness.
Results: Here I show, however, that this does not generally apply to termite workers which are
scarcely investigated. In the basal drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus the 'workers', which form the
large majority of a colony, did not stay to raise relatives. There is no brood caring behaviour and they
do not engage in costly help. They are large immature offspring that develop into either winged
(dispersing) or unwinged (replacement) reproductives and the probability that they did so was
unaffected by the number of brood in the nest as a brood addition experiment showed.
Conclusion: Thus, in contrast to general perception where termite workers are considered equivalent
to workers in Hymenoptera, the 'large immatures' of C. secundus did not behave as workers that help
in raising younger siblings. This apparently is not necessary as the colony lives inside its food. These
results, which are likely to be typical for wood-dwelling termites, open the possibility that large complex
group living can evolve without altruistic helping and that costly altruistic helping by workers in termites
evolved only as a second step.

Background
One of the most intriguing problems in evolutionary biology is the evolution of cooperation, and in particular of
altruism (i.e. helping others at own costs). How can such
behaviours evolve under competition-driven Darwinian
selection? Social insects in which individuals (workers)
forego at least some of their own reproduction to help
other individuals reproduce are prime examples to investigate this question. In social insects, worker behaviour is
generally associated with costs in direct reproduction
[1,2]. Even in species such as paper wasps, in which workers and queens are not morphologically different, workers
have lower direct reproduction because they probably
cannot do both carry out the risky tasks of foraging and

laying eggs (e.g. [3-5]). Such altruistic behaviour is
favoured by natural selection because in most social
insects, the workers rear close kin and in doing so enhance
their inclusive fitness [6]. However, these conclusions are
mainly based on social Hymenoptera (ants, some bees,
and wasps), while few studies exist on the oldest social
insects, the termites, that independently evolved sociality
[7,8].
Wood-dwelling termites, such as Cryptotermes secundus
(Kalotermitidae) live in a single piece of wood that is both
nest and food [9]. This lifestyle is considered the ancestral
state in termite evolution [7,10]. It is associated with a
flexible development in which the immature individuals

of both sexes (normally called workers, pseudergates, or
helpers; see [7]; in this study I refer to them as 'large
immatures' to separate function from developmental
stage) have the possibility of developing into all possible
castes, including sterile soldiers and reproductives [7]. In
the drywood termite C. secundus, a few individuals per
nest (1–10; median: 2) are sterile soldiers (Figure 1) and
this is undoubtedly a case in which inclusive fitness benefits are involved [11]. The remaining 'large immatures'
(individuals above 4th instar in C. secundus; [12]), which
form the largest group in the colony (c. 95 % of the individuals when excluding small larval instars and eggs), can
either stay in the natal colony or can leave by developing
into a winged sexual (alate) and found a new colony (Figure 1) [12]. The latter they do, for example, if the amount
of food in the nest declines [12]. If they stay in the nest
they could gain indirect fitness benefits as workers by rais-

ing offspring or/and direct fitness as a neotenic replacement reproductive when the king or the queen of the
colony dies (Figure 1).
I investigated the importance of indirect fitness benefits
for 'large immatures' who stay as supposed workers at the
nest instead of leaving as winged sexuals. First, I tested the
hypothesis that 'large immatures' stay in the colony in
order to help raise young offspring by experimentally
increasing the opportunity to help through boosting the
proportion of young individuals in the colony. If these
'large immatures' are actually staying in order to raise
young then the presence of young should increase the
value of helping and fewer should develop into dispersing
reproductives. These 'add young' colonies had roughly 20
% more young instars and eggs than they had originally.
They were compared to colonies with an unaltered colony

composition (control). To control for handling effect (i.e.
addition of individuals per se), in a third trial individuals
were added, but the age composition was not changed
('add all'). Second, I performed behavioural observations
to test the hypothesis that 'large immatures' help in raising
young. The results showed that contrary to current perceptions, these supposed termite workers (i.e. the 'large
immatures') neither seem to stay in the colony to gain
indirect benefits by helping to raise young offspring nor
did they help in raising young at all.

tests: control: r2 = 0.072; F1,8 = 0.54; p = 0.485; add all: r2
= 0.352; F1,8 = 3.79; p = 0.092; add young: r2 = 0.094; F1,8
= 0.73; p = 0.422) (Figure 2) as would have been expected
when 'large immatures' stay to raise young offspring. On
the contrary, when all trials were combined, the number
of individuals leaving the nest increased with the number
of young instars present in the nest at that time (Pearson's
test: r2 = 0.391; F2,24 = 14.11; p = 0.001) (Figure 2). These
results strongly suggest that indirect benefits derived from
helping are not the driving force for 'large immatures'
staying at the nest.

Results
Do 'large immatures' stay when the number of young
offspring is increased?
There was no significant interaction between colony size
and experiment showing that the regression slopes of the
three treatments ('control', 'add all', 'add young') did not
differ significantly (Table 1). In contrast to what we would
expect if 'large immatures' stay to gain indirect fitness benefits by raising young, there was no effect of adding young,
and the addition of individuals per se ('add all') also did
not have an effect: The number of 'large immatures' leaving the nest did not differ significantly between the three
trials, 'control', 'add all', and 'add young' (control: 15.5 ±
10.4; add young: 9.6 ± 4.8; add all: 14.2 ± 6.7; Table 1),
while colony size had a significant effect (Table 1). The
effect size f was 0.20 and the partial eta2 showed that trial
accounted for only 4 % of the total variability in number
of 'large immatures' leaving the colony, while 62 % of the
variability was explained by colony size.

Do 'large immatures' help?
Contrary to current perceptions, the supposed C. secundus
'workers' (i.e. large immatures) did not really help to raise
their siblings. In particular, they provided no specialised
brood care or defence. Foraging, an important and risky
task normally carried out by worker insects, is unnecessary
as the colony lives within its food, a piece of wood. The
only two behaviours that might be categorised as altruistic
helping are proctodeal feeding and allogrooming. However, these behaviours are not costly to the actor. Behavioural observations of 'large immatures' showed that for
each individual the frequency of feeding or allogrooming
others did not differ from that of being fed or allogroomed (Wilcoxon tests: for each of the 10 individuals:
proctodeal feeding: p > 0.05, n = 6 observation periods;
allogrooming: p > 0.05, n = 6 observation periods; Figure
3). So called 'dependent' larval instars (i.e. ≤ 3rd instar)
were not observed to be fed or allogroomed during this
experiment nor during any other observation since the

The result that the number of dispersing sexuals did not
decline when the number of young instars in a colony was
increased also cannot be explained by the death of the
added young. At the end of the experiment the total
number of individuals did not differ between the control
and 'add young' colonies (control: 88.7 ± 25.7; add
young: 77.6 ± 21.6; t-test: t14 = -0.33, p = 0.745) showing
that they did survive despite the fact that the 'large immatures' were leaving as winged sexuals (see also Methods).
The effect size f was 0.15. There was also no significant
negative correlation in any of the trials between the
number of 'large immatures' leaving the colony and the
number of young instars present in the nest (Pearson's

project started, covering more than 300 observation hours
of more than 600 individuals from more than 40 colonies
during all seasons. From the second instar larvae onward
(including reproductives) individuals were seen to feed
themselves. Eggs and first instar larvae were not cared for,
they are not carried around, piled up or licked; but also
they did not grow obviously until the next moult, which
might suggest that they utilize body reserves. The only
individuals that needed to be fed were the soldiers. However, this presents a minor cost as less than 5 % of the individuals (median: 2) were soldiers. On a per capita basis
each 'large immature' fed a soldiers less frequently than
once per day. Furthermore, it is difficult to classify this
feeding of soldiers as truly altruistic as the soldiers are the
'true' altruists that defend the colony and thereby increase
directly the survival of the feeding individuals.

Discussion
Contrary to current perceptions, these supposed termite
workers (i.e. the 'large immatures') do not seem to stay in
the colony to gain indirect benefits by helping to raise
young offspring. They were not less likely to leave the colony as winged sexuals when the potential to help was
increased by boosting the proportion of young instars.
The effect size was medium and addition of young
accounted for only 4 % of the variability in the number of
dispersing 'large immatures', while more than 50 % of the
variability was explained by colony size. On the contrary,
the number of 'large immatures' leaving the colony correlated positively with the number of young instars. Furthermore, despite the dispersal of the 'large immatures' in the
'add young' experiment, the young instars survived. These
results are explained by a general lack of helping behaviour directed at young. As in other basal termites [13,14],
no brood care occurred. It is not necessary in C. secundus
because of the termites' hemimetabolous development
and the fact that the colony lives inside its food. Thus, in
contrast to the holometabolous social Hymenoptera,
young are relatively independent and no costly foraging
exists. Therefore, exactly those conditions are absent in
wood-dwelling termites that Queller and Strassmann [15]
identified as the most important factors selecting for the
evolution of workers: care of young and food provisioning. In termites, this changes with the transition to nonwood nesting species, in which the nest and the foraging
area are separate (so-called 'multiple life type termites';
[9]). Correspondingly, in these termites true workers
occur which feed the brood and have a reduced capability
to reproduce [7]. Among 'large immatures' in C. secundus,
all individuals performed all tasks and supposedly altruistic behaviours, i.e. proctodeal feeding and allogrooming,
were none costly reciprocal interactions. The interactions
among nestmates should therefore not be regarded as
costly altruistic helping which supports the conclusion of

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/7

the experiment that these 'large immatures' do not stay in
the colony for kin's sake.
This conclusion is also supported by other features of
social life in this species. In particular, reduction to zero
relatedness between 'large immatures' and newborn offspring, does not lead to more individuals leaving the nest
[16]. Such a reduction in relatedness naturally occurs in
about 25 % of all field colonies, namely when colonies
that were founded in the same piece of wood fuse during
colony expansion and both reproductives of one colony
are killed. In such situations the 'large unrelated immatures' do not respond by leaving the nest, although they
do adaptively adjust development in other situations, for
example, when food availability declines [12,17].
Although these results were derived specifically for C.
secundus, the conclusions probably apply in general to termites that nest in one piece of wood (about 17 % of all
described species; [10]) as they share the characteristics of
totipotent 'workers' (large immatures) that do not engage
in costly foraging behaviour (reviewed in [7]). As such
wood-nesting species are supposed to present the ancestral state in termite evolution (reviewed in [7,10]), this
opens the possibility that in termites costly altruistic helping by workers evolved as a second step. Preliminary data
for C. secundus indicate that 'large immatures' stay at the
natal nest, which presents a safe heaven with plenty of
food, to gain direct fitness by inheriting the breeding position. Thus they resemble philopatric offspring in some
vertebrate societies that apparently do little or no work,
but wait to become the next breeder (e.g. [18,19]).

Conclusion
In contrast to general perception where termite workers
are considered equivalent to workers in Hymenoptera, the
'large immatures' of C. secundus did not behave as workers
that help in raising younger siblings. These results, which
are to my knowledge the first on the ultimate function of
'workers' in a phylogenetical basal termite, suggest that
costly altruistic helping in termites only evolved after staying for direct benefits had evolved. Such altruistic castes
are nowadays represented by the soldiers and the 'true
workers' of non-wood nesting termites.

Methods
Do 'large immatures' stay when the number of young
offspring is increased?
In 2003, colonies of C. secundus were collected from dead
Ceriops tagal trees from a mangrove area near PalmerstonChannel Island in Darwin Harbour (Northern Territory,
Australia; 12°30' S, 131°0' E) [17]. For the experiment I
used twenty-four monogamous field-collected colonies,
forming eight triplets each of the same final colony size to
control for colony size effects. The relative composition of

the original colonies (i.e. the relative proportions of larval
instars, large immatures and soldiers) did not differ significantly between the triplets (MANOVA: total: F6,40 = 1.29,
p = 0.283). Each triplet consisted of one colony that had
its natural colony composition (control), one colony
where the composition was manipulated by adding
around 20 % more young instars (1st- and 2nd-instar) and
eggs than it had originally ('add young'), and one colony
where individuals were added, but the age composition
was not changed ('add all'). The third trial served as control to check for handling artifacts of adding individuals.
The added individuals stemmed from further colonies
that had been collected at the same time and place in the
field. The colony size and relative composition of the
donor colonies did not differ significantly from those of
the experimental colonies (control, add young, add all)
before the manipulation (colony size: ANOVA: F3,28 =
1.85, p = 0.162; relative composition: MANOVA: total:
F9,84 = 1.65, p = 0.101). Addition of individuals is possible; no aggression occurs and mixing does not affect colony- or individual development [16]. This was further
confirmed by this study. The total number of individuals
at the end of the experiment did not differ between the
three trials (mean ± S.D.: control: 88.7 ± 25.7; add all:
66.1 ± 22.8; add young: 77.6 ± 21.6; ANOVA: F2,21 = 0.23,
p = 0.794).
Furthermore, no differences were found in the number of
'large immatures' leaving the nest (see Results). Thus,
there was no effect of adding individuals that could have
masked an effect of having more young to help. The addition occurred at the limited crucial time of the year, after
the nuptial flight in August, when developmental 'decisions' about dispersal are reached [12]. Colonies were set
up in Pinus radiata wood blocks providing abundant food
conditions (1 termite : 10 cm3 wood) [17]. The use of P.
radiata wood does not affect the termites [12,17]. No
more than two weeks after the colonies had been collected, they were placed back in the field to the site where
they came from. During the set-up of the experimental
colonies in the laboratory in Darwin the colonies where
kept under conditions similar to the field and appropriate
for C. secundus [17]. Prior to the swarming period of the
next year they were sampled to determine colony composition and the number of dispersing individuals. The latter
consisted of winged individuals (alates) as well as last
nymphal instars that are known to disperse during the following swarming period [12].
Data analysis
The number of dispersing individuals were analysed with
a one-way ANCOVA using the three trials as factors and
colony size as covariate. For non-significant results the
effect size index f for an ANCOVA design [20] was calculated using the computer program GPOWER [21]. Addi-

tionally, partial eta2 scores were provided as implemented
in SPSS to show the effect size of non-significant trial
effects relative to other effects (colony size). To compare
the total number of individuals at the end of the experiment between control and 'add young' colonies a t-test
was applied. The correlation between the number of dispersing 'large immatures' and the number of young in the
nest was analysed using Pearson correlation.
Do 'large immatures' help?
To test whether 'large immatures' help to raise siblings,
behavioural observations were performed. Five complete
monogamous colonies were collected from the field and
were set up in wood blocks with an observation chamber
as described elsewhere [22]. Colonies were allowed to
resettle for one day. Two 'large immatures' in each colony
were marked and focal observations were done six times
for 15 minutes during the following three weeks (each
individual was observed twice per week; for details see
[22]). The following potentially 'altruistic' behaviours
were analysed; they constituted the only behaviours that
were interactive and that might be altruistic in the sense
that they might provide benefits to the recipient at a cost
to the donor [22]:

Allogrooming: the individual grooms another individual
by moving the mouth parts over the others body.
Proctodeal feeding: the individual feeds another individual by donating substances via the anus; anus-mouth contact.
We distinguished whether an individual actively performed a behaviour or whether it was the passive recipient
of a behaviour that had been initiated by another individual.
Additionally, we performed systematic behavioural observations of more than 600 marked individuals from more
than 40 colonies during all seasons since this project
started in 1999, covering more than 300 observation
hours. These observations were done as described above,
but individuals were observed only once [16,22].
