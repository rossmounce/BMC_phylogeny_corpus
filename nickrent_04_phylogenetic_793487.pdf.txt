Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic relationships among the holoparasites of Rafflesiales have
remained enigmatic for over a century. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies using the
mitochondrial matR gene placed Rafflesia, Rhizanthes and Sapria (Rafflesiaceae s. str.) in the
angiosperm order Malpighiales and Mitrastema (Mitrastemonaceae) in Ericales. These phylogenetic
studies did not, however, sample two additional groups traditionally classified within Rafflesiales
(Apodantheaceae and Cytinaceae). Here we provide molecular phylogenetic evidence using DNA
sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear genes for representatives of all genera in Rafflesiales.
Results: Our analyses indicate that the phylogenetic affinities of the large-flowered clade and
Mitrastema, ascertained using mitochondrial matR, are congruent with results from nuclear SSU
rDNA when these data are analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The
relationship of Cytinaceae to Malvales was recovered in all analyses. Relationships between
Apodanthaceae and photosynthetic angiosperms varied depending upon the data partition: Malvales
(3-gene), Cucurbitales (matR) or Fabales (atp1). The latter incongruencies suggest that horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) may be affecting the mitochondrial gene topologies. The lack of association
between Mitrastema and Ericales using atp1 is suggestive of HGT, but greater sampling within
eudicots is needed to test this hypothesis further.
Conclusions: Rafflesiales are not monophyletic but composed of three or four independent
lineages (families): Rafflesiaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Apodanthaceae and Cytinaceae. Long-branch
attraction appears to be misleading parsimony analyses of nuclear small-subunit rDNA data, but
model-based methods (maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses) recover a topology that is
congruent with the mitochondrial matR gene tree, thus providing compelling evidence for
organismal relationships. Horizontal gene transfer appears to be influencing only some taxa and
some mitochondrial genes, thus indicating that the process is acting at the single gene (not whole
genome) level.

Background
Combining gene sequences from multiple subcellular
compartments continues to provide increasingly wellresolved flowering plant phylogenies [1] and these have
precipitated a new classification for angiosperms [2].
Whereas most groups have been placed at the ordinal
level, seven of the 18 "taxa of uncertain position" are holoparasitic, nonphotosynthetic flowering plants. These
parasites have been difficult to ally with green plants
owing to extreme reduction and/or loss of morphological
features [3]. Chloroplast genes commonly used to infer
land plant phylogenetic relationships either show elevated substitution rates or are absent in these holoparasites [3-5]. Moreover, nuclear ribosomal genes also show
greatly increased rates [6], thus analytical methods that
accommodate such among-lineage rate heterogeneity
must be used.
Rafflesiales are a fascinating and enigmatic group of holoparasitic plants that includes Rafflesia, whose meter-wide
flowers are the largest among all angiosperms, and Pilostyles, whose flowers are less than a centimeter in diameter. Such wide morphological variation has resulted in
classifications that comprise four families: 1) the "smallflowered clade" (Apodanthaceae) with Apodanthes, Berlinianche, and Pilostyles, 2) the "large-flowered clade" (Rafflesiaceae s. str.) with Rafflesia, Rhizanthes, and Sapria, 3) the
"inflorescence clade" (Cytinaceae) with Bdallophyton and
Cytinus, and 4) the "hypogynous clade" (Mitrastemonaceae) with Mitrastema [7,8].
Recently, Barkman et al. [9] used DNA sequences of the
mitochondrial gene matR to identify the closest photosynthetic relatives of two clades within Rafflesiales. Three
genera, representing two of the four families in the order,
were used in that study: Rafflesia and Rhizanthes (Rafflesiaceae s. str.) and Mitrastema (Mitrastemonaceae). Analyses of the matR data placed Rafflesiaceae s. str. within
Malpighiales, an order that includes passionflowers (Passiflora), willow (Salix), and violet (Viola). Mitrastemonaceae was placed within Ericales, an order containing
blueberries (Vaccinium), primroses (Primula), and tea
(Camellia). The authors argued that these results were
robust because they were congruent using different analytical methods (parsimony, neighbor-joining, Bayesian)
and were not affected by long-branch attraction artifacts
[10]. Moreover, because sequences from host plant lineages were included, and the parasites did not emerge as
sister to these lineages, contamination and horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) were discounted.
In this study we expand upon the previous analysis [9] by
including representatives of all Rafflesiales genera and
families, thus allowing us to address the question of
monophyly of the order. Moreover, parsimony, likeli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

hood and Bayesian analyses were conducted on genes
derived from all three subcellular compartments. These
results were compared to assess the impact of artifacts
such as long-branch attraction and HGT on various relationships. The data sets used were 1) mitochondrial matR,
2) mitochondrial atp1 and 3) a "3-gene" data set consisting of nuclear SSU rDNA plus two chloroplast genes: rbcL
and atpB (the latter two only from nonparasites).

Results
Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP)
and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses of mitochondrial
matR resulted in trees congruent with each other and with
those previously generated [9] (Figure 1 and additional
data file 1). As shown on the ML tree (Figure 1), Rafflesia,
Rhizanthes, and Sapria were placed with strong support in
Malpighiales. Mitrastema was placed in Ericales sister to
Vaccinium. The Cytinus and Bdallophyton clade (Cytinaceae) was strongly supported and this clade was sister to
one composed of four genera of Malvales, an order that
contains cotton (Gossypium), rockrose (Cistus) and chocolate (Theobroma). For Apodanthaceae, Apodanthes and Pilostyles were sister taxa and derived from within
Cucurbitales, an order that contains squash/pumpkin
(Cucurbita) and Begonia. For Berlinianche, sequences
homologous to matR could not be obtained using several
primer combinations.
All three analytical methods of the atp1 data produced
trees that were generally congruent, thus the ML tree is
illustrative (Figure 2, additional data file 2). Clades
among the monosulcates generally follow previously
reported relationships, whereas the topology of the eudicot portion of the tree does not clearly reflect accepted
clades, possibly owing to poor sampling within rosids and
asterids (sequences for these taxa were not available from
GenBank). Despite these shortcomings, this gene provides
additional evidence useful in assessing the phylogeny and
molecular evolution of Rafflesiales. With all three analytical methods, Mitrastema forms a clade with Beta (Caryophyllales), although this relationship does not receive
strong support. This is remarkable given that 15 taxa from
Ericales were included, yet a relationship with this order
(as seen with matR) was not obtained with atp1. The largeflowered clade was strongly supported as monophyletic in
all analyses, however, its position within the eudicots did
not receive strong support. Parsimony analysis placed
Pilostyles as sister to Pisum (Fabales) and this clade was sister to Berlinianche, but both with low bootstrap support.
Apodanthes was strongly suported (90% bootstrap) as sister to Polemonium (Ericales) with MP but with ML this
long-branch clade received lower support (Figure 2). The
two genera of Cytinaceae, Cytinus and Bdallophyton, were
sister to Malvales, with moderate (MP) to strong (BI)
support.

Maximum parsimony analyses of the full-length (103
taxon) and reduced (77 taxon) 3-gene matrices were generally congruent and both resulted in all taxa of Rafflesiales being associated with Malvales (Figure 3), although
with low bootstrap support for the monophyly of this
clade. The two accessions of Pilostyles were sister to a clade
composed of Pavonia and Gossypium, also with low bootstrap support. In constrast, BI analysis of the 3-gene matrix
placed Mitrastema with Ericales and the large-flowered
clade was a component of Malpighiales, the latter with
strong support. The inflorescence clade (Cytinus and Bdallophyton) and the small-flowered clade (Pilostyles) were
allied with Malvales (see additional data file 3), although
posterior probablilities of this association were lower.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

MP analyses of SSU data sets from which all but one parasite group had been removed resulted in phylogenetic
placements that matched those found in the ML tree. MP
analysis of a data set from which all Rafflesiales except
Mitrastema had been removed resulted in trees that placed
Mitrastema in Ericales. Removal of all parasites except Pilostyles or Bdallophyton + Cytinus individually placed both of
these groups in Malvales. Finally, removal of all parasites
except the large-flowered clade (Rafflesia, Rhizanthes and
Sapria) placed this clade in Malpighiales. Thus, the positions of the parasite clades inferred in four separate MP
analyses matched the positions found for these clades in
the single ML tree.

Discussion
Parsimony analysis of the nuclear SSU rDNA matrix, constrained to an accepted topology for nonparasites, showed
the same pattern of relationships as the unconstrained 3gene MP analysis, i.e., all Rafflesiales taxa were associated
with Malvales (see additional data file 4). In contrast, the
tree (Figure 4) resulting from ML analysis using the same
constraint tree showed the same relationships as the BI
tree for the 3-gene data set.
None of the consensus trees generated from MP analysis
of the 100 nuclear SSU rDNA data sets simulated on 20taxon trees matched the topology of the model tree. 58 of
the 100 MP consensus trees showed a Mitrastema + Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/Sapria clade and 17 showed a Bdallophyton/Cytinus + Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/Sapria clade (Figure 5).
Two other combinations, Bdallophyton/Cytinus + Pilostyles
and Bdallophyton/Cytinus + Mitrastema + Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/Sapria accounted for 6% and 2% of the MP consensus
trees, respectively. Thus, 83% of the MP trees contained
incorrect clades, and most of these can be attributed to the
long-branch Rafflesia clade. However, only two of the 100
MP trees showed all six long-branch taxa as monophyletic, a result seen on the original MP tree for the full
77-taxon data set. Results of parsimony analyses of data
sets simulated on the full 77-taxon tree showed a similar
pattern – 58 of the MP consensus trees showed a
Mitrastema + Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/Sapria clade, 7 showed a
Bdallophyton/Cytinus + Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/Sapria clade,
and 14 showed a Bdallophyton/Cytinus + Pilostyles clade
(Figure 5). In other words, MP returned an incorrect
"long-branch" clade for 79% of the data sets simulated on
the full 77-taxon model tree. In contrast, far fewer incorrect long-branch clades were recovered by ML for the 20taxon simulations, and most (56%) ML trees matched the
model tree in that the Rafflesia clade was sister to Passiflora, Mitrastema was sister to Helianthus/Nicotiana, and
Pilostyles, Bdallophyton and Cytinus were associated with
Gossypium.

Rate heterogeneity and long-branch attraction artifacts
Determining the photosynthetic relatives of Rafflesiales
has long presented a challenge owing to the extreme
reduction and/or modification of morphological structures that have accompanied the evolution of this lineage
[3,11]. Molecular phylogenetic approaches, although providing great promise in resolving such questions, also
come with their own set of challenges that includes losses
of some genes, substitution rate increases in other genes,
and horizontal gene transfer. Examples of the first process
can be seen in chloroplast genes such as rbcL that are typically used to infer phylogenetic relationships among
angiosperms but have not yet been amplified from any
Rafflesiales and are presumed lost [5]. Increased substitution rates in the normally conservative plastid rDNA has
been demonstrated in these holoparasites [4,12]. Similarly, accelerated rates in mitochondrial SSU rDNA, typically very conservative in many photosynthetic
angiosperms, occur in Rafflesia and Cytinus [13]. Despite
these complications, molecular phylogenetic analyses of
some holoparasite lineages with comparatively lower
rates have been tractable. For example, the mitochondrial
genes atp1 and matR were used, in combination with
nuclear rDNA and chloroplast genes, to reliably place
Hydnoraceae with Aristolochiaceae [11].

Long-branch attraction, a bias in certain phylogenetic
inference methods in which similarity due to convergent
or parallel changes produces an erroneous phylogenetic
grouping of taxa [10], is often implicated as the reason for
anomalous phylogenetic groupings [14]. It has been suggested that some data sets with marked among-lineage
rate heterogeneity cannot be applied to particular phylogenetic problems owing to hypothesized long-branch
attraction artifacts [15]. In their unconstrained parsimony
analysis of several angiosperm SSU rDNA sequences,
Barkman et al. [9] found that the branch leading to Rafflesia was several times longer than any other branch, and
that this branch was attracted to the second-longest
branch in the tree – the one between gymnosperms and

angiosperms. For these reasons, they argued that nuclear
SSU rDNA sequences are of limited utility for assessing the
phylogenetic position of Rafflesia.
Barkman et al. [9] analyzed their SSU rDNA data using
only parsimony, not model-based methods (e.g., ML or BI
methods) that are less likely to be misled by long-branch
attraction [16]. Our ML analysis of the SSU rDNA data
recovers a topology that closely matches the matR topology presented by Barkman et al. [9] in which Rafflesia is
closely related to Malpighiales and Mitrastema is a member of Ericales (Figure 4). These results highlight the
requirement to analyze SSU rDNA data with methods less
biased by long-branch attraction than parsimony, as well

as the advantage gained by independent confirmation of
results obtained from a single gene.
Several authors have suggested that adding taxa can
"break up" long branches and allow parsimony to recover
the correct topology [17-19]. Our parsimony analysis of
the 103- and 77-taxon SSU rDNA data sets, in which we
included representatives of all genera of Rafflesiales (i.e.,
sequences that could potentially break the Rafflesia long
branch), recovers a nearly monophyletic Rafflesiales containing all of the longest terminal branches in the tree (see
additional data file 3). Based on our simulation study and
MP analyses of data sets from which all but one parasite
group was removed, we believe that this topology

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:40

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

represents a case of long-branch attraction. These simulation results support the contention that the branches leading to the parasitic taxa are long enough to attract one
another (Figure 5), a result in agreement with previous
work [3,6].
Taxon sampling is not a cure-all for long-branch attraction
problems [20]. Even for the data sets simulated on the full
77-taxon tree, MP returned incorrect long-branch clades
nearly 80% of the time. MP did nearly as poorly with data
sets simulated on a 77-taxon tree as it did on data sets simulated on a 20-taxon tree. Evaluation of the ML tree for the
SSU data (Figure 4) shows that increasing the number of
taxa from 20 to 77 did not improve the result because the
long parasite branches were not broken. Instead, shorter
(nonparasite) branches were broken which did not help
MP recover the true topology for the simulated data sets.
MP analyses of the full 77-taxon SSU data set that
included all parasite clades resulted in a worse estimate of
the phylogeny than MP analyses of smaller data sets in
which only single parasite clades were included. Thus, the
frequently stated view that increased taxon sampling can

help MP avoid long-branch attraction problems may only
be true if the added taxa are not distantly related longbranch clades themselves.
Phylogenetic relationships of the four Rafflesiales clades
Rafflesiaceae (the large-flowered clade)
The results from analyses of Rafflesiales using independent data sets are summarized in Table 1. For Rafflesiaceae
s. str., placement in Malpighiales is supported by ML and
BI analyses of the 3-gene and nuclear SSU rDNA data sets
as well as mitochondrial matR. This placement in Malpighiales is also supported by a molecular phylogenetic
study that used a single copy nuclear gene phytochrome C
[21]. These authors proposed that Rafflesiaceae are most
closely related to Ochnaceae or Clusiaceae which contrasts with presumed synapomorphies with Passiflora
given by Barkman et al. [9]. Within Malpighiales, tremendous morphological diversity exists among the 27 families and 16,000 species. Moreover, relationships among
the major clades are still poorly resolved [22]. Although
the evidence for a malpighialean affinity of Rafflesiaceae
appears strong, it is possible that the molecular data have

only identified the stem group that represents the sister to
the parasitic lineage.
Barkman et al. [9] suggested that the floral similarities
between Rafflesia and Passiflora, first noted by Robert
Brown [23] represent morphological synapomorphies
that support the results obtained from the matR gene tree.
Arguments in favor of a number of other, equally credible
relationships within eudicots could be made based on

hypothetical evolutionary transformation series of morphological characters. Indeed Brown concluded that Rafflesia may have affinity with Passifloraceae (Malpighiales)
but he also considered other groups such as Aristolochiaceae ("Asarinae", Piperales), Sterculiaceae (Malvales)
and Cucurbitaceae (Cucurbitales). In general, different
characters supported relationships with one or another
group and therefore he left the subject as unresolved.
Three proposed synapomorphies between Passifloraceae

and Rafflesia were cited by Barkman et al. [9]: a
hypanthium (perigone tube in Rafflesia), an androgynophore (gynostemium or column in Rafflesia), and an
annular corona (diaphragm in Rafflesia). Whether these
structures are homologous is not clear and will likely
require further morphological studies, possibly examining the floral development genes themselves. These
hypotheses require scrutiny because the apparent similarities in structure are not clear when examined in detail.
For example, the androgynophore of Passiflora is composed of a stalk that bears the androecium and gynoecium. In Rafflesia, the ovary is inferior (with no stalk),
hence the central column must involve other gynoecial
parts. The corona of Passiflora is very different in structure
and function from the diaphragm of Rafflesia [24]. The
observation of a physical union between Passiflora caerulea
and Euonymus [25] was discussed by Barkman et al. [9] as
a possible clue to the origin of parasitism in Rafflesia.
Whether this association represents parasitism or not is a
matter of semantics [26], for other similar associations
exist such as Cissus and Opuntia growing on Yucca and
Opuntia on Cercidium and Idria. In all of these cases, a true
haustorium does not form and more likely these represent
forms of grafting. It is difficult to state whether such rare
occurrences have any bearing on the origin of parasitism
in Rafflesiales or other parasitic flowering plants.
Mitrastemonaceae (the hypogynous clade)
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the 3-gene
and nuclear SSU rDNA data partitions placed Mitrastema
in Ericales, a result congruent with that obtained using
mitochondrial matR. As noted by Barkman et al. [9], this
relationship within the asterids had not previously been
proposed. Mitrastema has bisexual, protandrous flowers
with a collar-shaped, four-merous perianth tube. The stamens are connate into a tube (androphore) crowned by a
fertile zone of pollen-bearing locules. The staminal tube,
open at the top by a small hole, circumscissally separates
from the flower as it is pushed up by the growing gynoecium. The apical portion of the staminal tube is sterile,
but below this is a series of vertical rings of ca. ten minute,
pollen sacs each. The gynoecium is hypogynous, one-locular, with a thick, conical stigma. Placentation is parietal
with 8–15 (-20) unequal placental lobes filling the locule.
The numerous ovules are small (190 by 120 µm), anatropous, unitegmic (but with two cell layers), and tenuinucellar. Although some floral morphological features of
Mitrastema are not in conflict with those seen in Ericales,
such as extrorse anthers and cellular endosperm, features
such as decussate leaves, circumscissile fruit dehiscence,
and parietal placentation are too general to draw specific
associations. Given that Mitrastema is an achlorophyllous
holoparasite and that one clade of Ericaceae (Monotropoideae) contains achlorophyllous mycotrophs, it is
intriguing to ask whether these groups share a common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

ancestor or evolved independently. The most specialized
morphological feature found in Mitrastemonaceae, the
athecal androecium, is not found in Ericales but in Malvaceae, the only angiosperm family that shows the entire
gamut from taxa with normal stamens, to taxa with stamens deviating only slightly from the common pattern
[27,28], to athecal androecia [29].
Cytinaceae (the inflorescence clade)
The most consistent phylogenetic signal that is seen across
all data sets and types of analyses is a relationship
between Cytinaceae and Malvales (Table 1). Because the
relationship between Cytinaceae and Malvales is the
strongest among all four Rafflesiales clades, it is possible
that this clade acts as an "attracter" for the other three Rafflesiales clades in some analyses. This is seen when using
nuclear SSU rDNA sequences, either alone or with the
topology of the tree stabilized through the addition of two
chloroplast genes. In both cases, parsimony produces a
monophyletic Rafflesiales within Malvales which contrasts with the result seen with the constrained ML SSU
rDNA and the matR results. These results and those
obtained from the simulation study indicate that the
large-flowered clade and Mitrastema are artifactually
attracted to Cytinaceae when parsimony is utilized.

Unlike other Rafflesiales, members of Cytinaceae have
multiple flowers arranged in an inflorescence. The floral
structure called the diaphragm, seen in Rafflesia and Sapria
(but not Rhizanthes), is lacking in Cytinaceae. Bdallophyton
is dioecious and Cytinus is either dioecious (C. capensis, C.
sanguineus) or monoecious (C. hypocistis). The perianth is
tubular, composed of four to nine imbricate organs. The
androecium is connate, forming a compact synandrium
with extrorse anthers and the pollen is 2-, 3-, or 4-porate.
The female flower is epigynous with a columnar style terminated by a globose or capitate, viscous stigma with
commissural lobes [30]. The ovary is unilocular with 8–
14 deeply intrusive, discrete parietal placentae that bear
numerous, orthotropous, tenuinucellate ovules.
Apodanthaceae (the small-flowered clade)
Maximum parsimony and likelihood analyses of the 3gene data set and nuclear SSU rDNA sequences alone also
place Pilostyles (the only Apodanthaceae for which SSU
rDNA sequences are available) within Malvales, however,
a sister relationship with Cytinaceae is not consistently
obtained. A 3-gene alignment that included additional
representatives of Malvales (16 taxa) gave similar results
as shown in Figure 3 (i.e., Pilostyles on a clade separate
from other Rafflesiales). These data, in conjunction with
the results from the mitochondrial genes, support an evolution of Apodanthaceae independent from Rafflesiaceae
s. str. The well-supported relationship between Pilostyles
and Apodanthes using matR is expected given their very

similar floral morphology [31], yet this clade is sister to
two representatives of Cucurbitales (Begonia and Cucurbita). Contamination with host tissue is excluded because
neither parasite is known to currently occur on a member
of Cucurbitales. Apodanthaceae are grouped with Pisum
(Fabales) and Polemonium (Ericales) on the atp1 tree, but
no atp1 sequences from representatives of Cucurbitales
were available from GenBank to test the matR result. The
sister relationship between Apodanthes and Polemonium is
strongly supported on the MP tree (bootstrap support
value = 90%; additional data file 3), but this pairing must
be viewed with caution given the low Bayesian posterior
probability of the clade (0.54) and that both taxa are very
long branches (Figure 2). Although ML is less susceptible
to long-branch attraction artifacts than MP, it is not
immune to it; thus, it remains unclear whether or not this
relationship is artifactual. Moreover, the Polemonium
sequence is separate from the clade containing 12 other
members of this order, thus raising the possibility that the
sequence results from contamination or HGT (see below).
Additional sampling within the eudicots will be required
to better understand the atp1 gene tree topology.
Morphological features shared between Apodanthaceae
and Cytinaceae are: unisexual flowers, a connate androecium, an inferior ovary, and a unilocular ovary with
four parietal placentae bearing numerous, anatropous,
tenuinucellate ovules [30,31]. Floral morphological features that might link Apodanthaceae and Cytinaceae with
Malvales [31] include an androecial tube (e.g., Malvaceae), a trend toward synandria without anthers and
thecae (e.g., Malvaceae) [29], tri- to hexamerous flowers
(e.g., Thymelaeaceae), and parietal placentae (e.g., Cistaceae). The floral conditions of unisexuality and epigyny
do occur in Malvales, albeit rarely. Unisexual flowers pose
some difficulties for interpreting the morphological
homologies of various floral organs. For Pilostyles and Apodanthes male flowers, a tubular synandrium surrounds
and fuses with a central structure that could be interpreted
as a sterile gynoecium. Support for the concept that such
a central structure is a pistillode comes from Berlinianche
where the upper portion of the synandrium is free from
the central part. In female flowers of Apodanthaceae,
there is no rudiment of an androecium, hence the central
tissue is apparently entirely gynoecial.
In contrast to the above discussion, the matR data indicate
Apodanthaceae are related to Cucurbitales, an order with
seven families, 129 genera and 2300 species. Hosts for
Apodanthaceae are generally legumes, although Apodanthes occurs most frequently on Casearia (Salicaceae, Malpighiales). Thus, neither recent HGT nor contamination
explains this result. Apodanthaceae shares some morphological features with members of Cucurbitaceae, subfamily Cucurbitoideae: unisexual, five-merous flowers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

(Berlinianche); carpellate flower with a unilocular, inferior
ovary with parietal placentation; anatropous, bitegmic
ovules; staminate flower with connate filaments (monadelphous) and a rudimentary gynoecium (pistillode)
[32]. Conflicting characters also occur, such as a three-carpellate gynoecium in Cucurbitoideae (vs. four-carpellate
in Apodanthaceae) and a valvate perianth (vs. imbricate).
All of these characters, however, are less specialized than
those shared between Apodanthaceae and Malvales.
Background on horizontal gene transfer
A requirement of the molecular phylogenetic approach to
inferring evolutionary histories of organisms is vertical
transmission of genetic material from parent to offspring.
In contrast, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) describes the
movement of genetic material between organisms of no
direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Although the frequency of HGT is currently not well understood among
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, it is clear that HGT
can compromise accurate inference of genealogical history. In plants, lateral movement of genetic material has
been documented for mobile genetic elements such as
introns [33-37] but only recently has convincing evidence
emerged documenting HGT of mitochondrial genes
[38,39]. Genes of the mitochondrion are extensively used
to infer evolutionary relationships in plants [40-42], thus
highlighting the importance of characterizing the frequency of HGT across genes and taxa.

Incongruence among gene trees derived from different
data sets can derive from a number of factors such as technical causes (insufficient data, gene choice, sequencing
error, taxon sampling and identification), gene/genomelevel processes, and organism-level processes (e.g.,
hybridization/introgression, lineage sorting, and HGT)
[43]. HGT has only recently been recognized as a potentially important force in the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes and detecting HGT is highly dependent
upon the presence of multiple gene data sets with robust
taxon sampling [38,39].
Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in parasitic plants
We believe that incongruence between the the mitochondrial and the nuclear gene trees (Table 1) stem not just
from long-branch attraction artifacts but also from cases
of HGT. The placement of Apodanthes and Pilostyles on the
atp1 tree as sister to Pisum (a legume, the family of hosts
for Pilostyles) represents a likely case of HGT. The atp1 data
conflict with those from matR that associates Apodanthaceae with Cucurbitales. Moreover, we infer that the
SSU rDNA tree better represents the organismal phylogeny because it seems less likely that nuclear genes would
be influenced by HGT [44,45]. The main rationale for this
is that nuclear rDNA cistrons are repeated hundreds to
thousands of times in tandem arrays at nucleolar

organizing regions of the chromosomes. Although it can
be envisioned that concerted evolution could homogenize all rDNAs in the parasite with a form obtained via
HGT, the probability of this happening is small given the
vastly different number of starting copies.
In their study of Rafflesiaceae s. str. and Mitrastemonaceae, Barkman et al. [9] discounted HGT as a possible explanation for their results because they state the
phenomenon is rare and the overall topology of the matR
tree closely matched results from other molecular phylogenetic investigations of angiosperms. The present study
confirms that HGT is not implicated for the two lineages
studied by Barkman as well as Cytinaceae, but this process
could be invoked for Apodanthaceae. More recent work
by these authors [46] identified several cases of HGT from
host to parasite for atp1. These included Dalea to Pilostyles,
Tetrastigma to Rafflesia, and Lithocarpus to Mitrastema. In
addition, HGT of another mitochondrial gene, nad1, has
been reported for Rafflesia and Sapria, both of which occur
on the same clade as their hosts (Tetrastigma) on a gene
tree [20]. These examples demonstrating the presence of
host genes in parasitic plants provide the most compelling
evidence for HGT. This form of transfer is intuitively logical given the intimate contact between cells of the two
organisms via the endophytic haustorium. However, parasitic plants exist in complex ecosystems where they are in
physical contact with many other organisms (bacteria,
fungi, phytophagous and pollinating animals, etc.) that
could potentially affect HGT. That such nonhost HGT
may also be occurring is evidenced by the presence of an
apparent cucurbitalean matR gene in Pilostyles and Apodanthes. Moreover, present-day hosts of parasitic angiosperms
do not represent the only conduit for HGT if host choice
has shifted through time as the parasite lineage evolves.
For example, Barkman et al. [9] state that Mitrastema only
parasitizes Fagales (e.g., Lithocarpus and Castanopsis, both
Fagaceae) but this parasite has also been recorded from
Aquifoliaceae, Asteraceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Juglandaceae,
and Myrtaceae [47]. Host latitude for this species would
be broader if rare hosts and hosts of parasite ancestors
were fully known, thus expanding the taxonomic spectrum of potential HGT sources.
Formidable contamination issues
Contamination of parasite DNA with DNA from the host
plant is an issue that must be given serious attention.
Indeed, two sequences shown on the matR tree (Figure 1),
Tetrastigma2 and Julbernardia are hosts for Rafflesia tuanmudae and Berlinianche, respectively. These sequences
were obtained by PCR amplification and sequencing from
what was originally thought to be pure parasite genomic
DNA. Sequences of the host (obtained from separate samples) were found to be identical to these "parasite"
sequences, strongly suggesting contamination. In the case

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

of Rafflesia, the DNA was obtained from a bud still
attached to the host vine, both of which had been sectioned longitudinally. Disruption of these tissues likely
resulted in transfer of host sap to the bud region where the
tissue was sampled. Other samples of R. tuan-mudae from
the same population, obtained as floral bracts with no
host tissue, resulted in matR sequences that were similar to
the other two Rafflesia species.
For Berlinianche, whose flowers are much smaller than
those of Rafflesia (5 mm in diameter), extreme care (using
a stereo microscope) was exercised to remove floral parts
devoid of any host tissue. Despite this, the matR sequence
obtained from the first sample was that of the host, Julbernardia. Later, silica gel dried samples of other populations
of the parasite were extracted, again using extreme care in
avoiding host contamination. PCR products were
obtained using several mitochondrial matR primers, but
none were found to be homologous to this gene following
BLAST searches. This result shows that host DNA was not
present in this sample in sufficient amounts to amplify
and that the parasite matR gene, if present, is highly divergent at the priming sites used.
For all three Apodanthaceae genera, the conical style in
female flowers is papillate and heavily secretory [31]. This
sticky surface tends to capture a variety of environmental
debris, likely including extraneous pollen, fungal spores,
and host tissues that have been disrupted upon collecting.
Obtaining a proper nuclear SSU rDNA sequence for Pilostyles was extremely difficult. Despite PCR products of the
correct sizes using a variety of primer combinations, the
sequences obtained from genomic DNA derived from
flowers were deemed contaminants following BLAST
searches that showed them to be most similar to monocots, fungi, etc. Only when sequences from two accessions
of Pilostyles (Texas and California) both were most similar
to Malvales was this considered good evidence for their
true phylogenetic affiliation. Retrospectively, it is likely
that the sticky flowers had accumulated wind-dispersed
pollen (e.g., grasses) and that this DNA, despite being in
low concentration, had less divergent priming sites than
the parasite target DNA, allowing PCR to preferentially
amplify the contaminant DNA.
The mechanism of horizontal gene transfer: some
considerations
Given the accumulating molecular evidence for HGT from
host to parasitic plant, it is worthwhile to consider potential mechanisms, along with their constraints, that may
suggest further research. Relatively little information
exists on the structure of the endophyte of Rafflesiales.
Ultrastructural studies have been conducted on two species of Pilostyles: P. hamiltonii [48] and P. thurberi [49].
These authors conflict, however, as to whether there exists

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:40

symplastic continuity between host and parasite via
plasmodesmata; the former indicated that such connections are the major path of nutrient uptake by the parasite
whereas the latter rejected this idea. Despite this controversy, heteroplastic plasmodesmatal connections have
been documented in another parasitic plant, Cuscuta [50]
and indeed such connections can even form in heterografts between distantly related plant taxa [51]. Given this,
we assume that host-parasite plasmodesmatal connections exist in the endophytes of Rafflesiales. Transmission
electron micrographs of Pilostyles suggest that intact,
mature mitochondria are too large to pass through heteroplastic plasmodesmata, however, mitochondrial
genomes or portions of the genome are certainly small
enough for transmission. Once inside the parasite cell,
there are various fates for the host gene. It could become
incorporated into the parasite mitochondrial genome,
and then either replace the parasite copy or exist as a
duplicate, or the host gene could reside in the parasite
nuclear genome. For the latter case, the gene would likely
become a pseudogene given the requirement of mitochondrial-specific patterns of RNA editing. Two forms of
atp1 are present in the primitive angiosperm Amborella trichopoda [38], one of which is derived from a HGT event
from a eudicot. It is not known whether both forms of the
gene exist in a single mitochondrial genome, in different
mitochondrial genomes within the cell (i.e., heteroplasmy), or if one is nuclear and the other mitochondrial.
Future work to address these questions would involve
sequencing flanking regions of purported horizontally
transferred genes to determine their subcellular location.
Additionally, cDNA sequences obtained from matR
mRNA would be useful to determine whether the gene is
expressed and whether mitochondrial-specific RNA editing patterns are present.

Conclusions
In this study we have used data derived from nuclear,
mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA and a variety of analytical approaches to address long-standing questions
about the holoparasitic flowering plant order Rafflesiales.
We show that Rafflesiales are not monophyletic but composed of at least three and possibly four independent lineages. Rafflesiaceae (Rafflesia, Rhizanthes, and Sapria)
representing the large-flowered clade are monophyletic
and are related to Malpighiales. The monogeneric family
Mitrastemonaceae, the only member of the order with a
superior ovary, is related to Ericales. The first of the
remaining two families that have previously not been
sampled is Cytinaceae (Bdallophyton and Cytinus) which is
strongly supported as a member of Malvales. The last
remaining unsampled family, Apodanthaceae (Apodanthes, Berlinianche, and Pilostyles) is either related to Malvales or Cucurbitales. Our simulation studies indicate that
Mitrastema, Bdallophyton/Cytinus, and Rafflesia/Rhizanthes/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

Sapria have branches that are long enough to mislead parsimony. All of these relatively long branches appear to be
attracted toward the Cytinaceae clade within Malvales.
When nuclear SSU rDNA sequences are analyzed with ML,
results fully congruent with those previously reported for
two Rafflesiales clades using mitochondrial matR are
obtained. If the phylogenetic affinityof Apodanthaceae
are with Malvales, the results from the mitochondrial
matR gene must represent a case of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Cucurbitales. If this proves to be the case,
this provides an example of HGT from a nonhost plant to
a parasitic angiosperm.
To properly discern phylogenetic relationships in enigmatic parasitic taxa, our results demonstrate the need for
robust taxon sampling, gene sequences from multiple
subcellular compartments, and the use of analytical methods that accommodate rate heterogeneity and avoid the
pitfalls of long-branch attraction. When the phylogenetic
relationships among such holoparasitic taxa are poorly
known, the strongest phylogenetic signal that can be
obtained is congruence among results derived from independent sources (i.e., genes from different subcellular
compartments). Comparisons among gene trees allows
for the identification of HGT, a phenomenon that
requires further investigation to determine its modes of
action and frequency among taxa and through evolutionary time.

Methods
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing
DNA was extracted, amplified, cloned, and sequenced by
using methods formerly reported [52-54]. The nuclear
and mitochondrial sequences were PCR-amplified using
primers reported elsewhere [6,55,56] and are also given
on the first author's web site [57]. Sequencing was conducted using manual and automated methods (ABI
Prism® 377 automated DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's protocols.
DNA alignments
The initial matR alignment incorporated all of the Rafflesiales parasites and the nonparasite sequences previously
published [9] as well as our newly generated sequences.
The 106-taxon matrix represented over 40 orders and contained three gymnosperm outgroup taxa (Ginkgo, Pinus,
and Zamia), 28 monosulcates, 63 nonparasitic eudicots,
and 15 Rafflesiales. For two taxa (Mitrastema and Rhizanthes), our sequences, as well as those previously published, were from the same species but different accessions
to test for consistency. Taking into account codon information, an alignment of 2177 sites was constructed manually using SeAl version 2.0 [58]. The full matrix was used
for parsimony analyses whereas another, truncated to 77
taxa by removing all but three monosulcate taxa (Laurales

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:40

used as outgroup), was constructed to facilitate likelihood
analyses. This operation was justified because monosulcates were never implicated as relatives of Rafflesiales in
any analyses. A 71-taxon, 1265-site atp1 alignment was
similarly constructed and included the same gymnosperm
outgroup genera as above, 24 monosulcates, 32 nonparasitic eudicots and 12 Rafflesiales. All of the monosulcate
genera in the atp1 alignment were also represented in the
matR data set, whereas eudicot sampling for atp1 was constrained by sequences available on GenBank (12 of the
same genera as with matR or placeholders from same
family).
To test the position obtained for Rafflesiales taxa using
mitochondrial genes with an independent data set derived
from different compartments, a 4646-site "3-gene" matrix
combining sequences from nuclear SSU rDNA and chloroplast rbcL and atpB was constructed that included 103
taxa (3 gymnosperms, 28 monosulcates, 58 nonparasitic
eudicots, and 14 Rafflesiales). Sampling across
angiosperm orders was very similar to the matR matrix,
differing only by the presence of 11 placeholders and a
second accession of Pilostyles. For the holoparasites, only
nuclear SSU rDNA sequences were included; the chloroplast gene data for these taxa were coded as missing. The
two chloroplast genes were included to add stability to the
tree topology given that nuclear SSU has been shown to
contain lower phylogenetic signal when used alone [15].
As with matR, the 103-taxon matrix was truncated to 77
taxa by removing all but five monosulcate taxa to facilitate
likelihood analyses. All alignments reported in this paper
have been deposited with TreeBASE [59]: study accession
number S1177, matrix accession numbers = M2034–
M2037.
Data analysis
All three data sets were analyzed using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods in
PAUP* 4.0b10 [60] and Bayesian inference (BI) methods
in MrBayes 3.0b4 [61].
Maximum parsimony
All MP searches were performed using 100 random addition sequence replicates with tree-bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping, holding ten trees at each addition step, with all sites equally weighted. For the 77-taxon
SSU data set, a series of four MP analyses were performed
in which all but one parasite group (Bdallophyton + Cytinus, Mitrastema, Pilostyles or the large-flowered clade comprising Rafflesia, Rhizanthes and Sapria) was removed to
determine the position of each parasite group in the
absence of other long-branch parasite taxa in the analysis.
This is a form of the test proposed by Siddall and Whiting
[62].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

Maximum likelihood
For ML analyses, a MP tree was used in PAUP* to evaluate
56 nucleotide substitution models. ModelTest 3.06 [63]
was used to select an appropriate model from the PAUP*
output using hierarchical likelihood-ratio tests (hLRT's)
and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The general
time-reversible (GTR) substitution model with amongsite rate heterogeneity modeled with a "gamma + invariant sites distribution" (Γ + I) was chosen via the AIC as the
best-fitting model for the atp1 data set. Investigation of
the likelihood score output from PAUP* suggested that a
simpler model not evaluated by ModelTest was not significantly worse than the GTR+Γ + I model (LRT; p =
0.520824). This submodel employed four (rather than
six) relative rate parameters: one for A-C transversions and
A-G transitions, one for A-T and C-G transversions, one
for C-T transitions, and one for G-T transversions; the
PAUP* LSET option used for analysis was "RCLASS = (a a
b b c d)". Likewise, the models chosen by ModelTest for
the matR data set were TVM+Γ (hLRT) and TIM+Γ (AIC),
but a simpler statistically equal model (LRT; p =
0.583393) was used for analysis. This model employed
three relative rate parameters: one for A-C, A-G, and G-T
substitutions; one for A-T and C-G substitutions; and one
for C-T substitutions; "RCLASS = (a a b b c a)", with
among-site rate heterogeneity modeled with a gamma distribution. These simplified models were chosen to reduce
computational time and to avoid estimation of unnecessary parameters, which can lead to greater variance in
parameter estimates and higher topological uncertainty.

A successive approximations approach was used for all ML
analyses [19,64]. Substitution model parameters were
estimated from the data on a MP tree. With parameter estimates fixed, starting trees for ML analyses were produced
via random stepwise addition using five starting seeds,
with each tree subjected to a round of tree bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Substitution model
parameters were then re-estimated on all resulting trees,
followed by another round of random stepwise addition
and TBR swapping. The tree with the highest likelihood
was accepted as the ML tree.
Nodal support
Nodal support for all data sets was estimated using one or
more of the following methods: equal-weights MP bootstrap analysis (100 pseudoreplicates, each consisting of a
heuristic search using 100 random sequence addition replicates), ML bootstrap analysis (100 pseudoreplicates generated with SEQBOOT in PHYLIP and analyzed using
successive approximations in PAUP*) [65,66], and Bayesian analysis (10 million generations, with the first one or
two million discarded as burn-in and trees sampled every
500 generations for the matR and atp1 data sets; 10 million generations, with the first 5 million discarded as

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:40

burn-in and trees sampled every 500 generations for the 3gene data set) [61]. The GTR+Γ + I submodels used in
PAUP* are not available in MrBayes; a standard GTR+Γ +
I model was used for the matR and atp1 data sets instead.
A partitioned model was used for the 3-gene data set (see
below). Two Bayesian runs were performed for all analyses in an attempt to determine if stationarity was reached,
and plots of log likelihood and parameter convergence
were also evaluated; log-likelihood plots alone are insufficient for monitoring chain mixing and convergence
[67,68].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/40

more than one MP or ML tree was recovered for a given
simulated data set) were then inspected to determine the
presence of "incorrect" clades (containing two or more
"long-branch" Rafflesiales taxa) that were not present on
the model tree. We do not expect to recover such clades at
high frequencies unless long-branch attraction is biasing
the analyses.

Partitioned analyses
The 3-gene data set was also analyzed in MrBayes 3.0. A
"fully partitioned" analysis was used in which the 3-gene
data set was divided into seven partitions: nuclear SSU;
atpB first, second and third codon positions; rbcL first, second and third codon positions. Appropriate substitution
models for each data partition were chosen by computing
likelihood scores for each partition on a MP tree for the 3gene data set under 56 substitution models in PAUP* and
comparing the scores in ModelTest. The GTR+Γ + I model
was the best-fitting model for all partitions. The Bayesian
analysis was performed with all model parameters (except
branch lengths) unlinked across partitions.

atpB– ATP synthase beta subunit
BI – Bayesian inference
GTR – general time reversible model
HGT – horizontal gene transfer
matK – maturase K
matR – maturase R

Constraints
For the nuclear SSU rDNA data, constrained analyses were
also performed. A constraint tree for 63 nonparasitic taxa
was constructed using the MP topology of the "B series"
tree from Soltis et al. [1] with relationships for poorly supported clades left unresolved. This tree was used as a backbone constraint for MP and ML analyses of 77 taxa
including Rafflesiales. MP analyses were performed as
described above. ML analyses followed a successive
approximations approach similar to that described above.

MP – maximum parsimony
rbcL – ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, large
subunit
SSU – small subunit
TBR – tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping

Authors' contributions
Simulations
To investigate possible long-branch attraction in parsimony analyses of the SSU rDNA data set, two sets of simulations were performed. For the first set of simulations, a
reduced data set of SSU rDNA sequences for 20 taxa (13
nonparasites and 7 Rafflesiales) was constructed and analyzed under ML (GTR+Γ + I model) in PAUP*. The tree
resulting from this analysis, with its associated ML branch
lengths and model parameters, was used as the model tree
on which 100 data sets of length 1766 (the length of the
original SSU rDNA data set) were simulated in Seq-Gen
1.2.7 [69]. For the second set of simulations, the ML tree
for the full 77-taxon data set, with associated branch
lengths and model parameters, was used as a model tree
to simulate 100 data sets of length 1766 in Seq-Gen 1.2.7.
Either MP and ML trees (20-taxon simulation) or just MP
trees (77-taxon simulation) were estimated for all 100
simulated data sets. The trees (or strict consensus trees, if

DLN coordinated all aspects of the study, obtained many
of the genomic DNAs, generated all the nuclear SSU
rDNA, conducted the sequence alignments, and drafted
the manuscript. AB conducted the majority of the mitochondrial atp1 and matR sequencing and revised the text
regarding morphological character comparisons. YQ provided primers, introduced AB to the field of molecular systematics, and supervised his Ph.D thesis. RVR conducted
the PCR experiments showing host contamination of Rafflesia DNA and generated the matR sequences for several
taxa. FEA performed the phylogenetic analyses. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
