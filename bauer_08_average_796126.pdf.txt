Abstract
Background: Occult organizational structures in DNA sequences may hold the key to
understanding functional and evolutionary aspects of the DNA molecule. Such structures can also
provide the means for identifying and discriminating organisms using genomic data. Species specific
genomic signatures are useful in a variety of contexts such as evolutionary analysis, assembly and
classification of genomic sequences from large uncultivated microbial communities and a rapid
identification system in health hazard situations.
Results: We have analyzed genomic sequences of eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes as
well as various subtypes of viruses using an information theoretic framework. We confirm the
existence of a species specific average mutual information (AMI) profile. We use these profiles to
define a very simple, computationally efficient, alignment free, distance measure that reflects the
evolutionary relationships between genomic sequences. We use this distance measure to classify
chromosomes according to species of origin, to separate and cluster subtypes of the HIV-1 virus,
and classify DNA fragments to species of origin.
Conclusion: AMI profiles of DNA sequences prove to be species specific and easy to compute.
The structure of AMI profiles are conserved, even in short subsequences of a species' genome,
rendering a pervasive signature. This signature can be used to classify relatively short DNA
fragments to species of origin.

Background
The existence of patterns that can be used as a signature of
data is indicative of statistical or deterministic structures
in the data. In DNA sequences this structure can be due to
biological processes which involve the DNA or they may
appear because of events and processes in the evolutionary history of the DNA. There have been significant efforts
in understanding the sequential structure and complexity
of DNA using various approaches, information theoretic
measures or other mathematical models.

The standard approach to studying statistical relationships in a sequence is the use of correlation profiles or
spectral profiles such as periodograms and power spectrums. To translate the sequence of letters that form the
DNA sequence into a sequence of numbers, which can
then be easily analyzed using autocorrelation or spectral
techniques, different mappings have been proposed by
Gates [1], Voss [2] and Peng et al. [3]. The power spectral
densities obtained from these approaches show a power
law relationship, which points to the existence of long

range correlations. A number of models have been proposed to account for these long range correlations [4,5].
Somewhat distinct from statistical models, several
researchers have used information theoretic measures to
study the characteristics of the DNA sequence. A description of the use of information measures to study DNA
sequences can be found in Gatlin [6] and Roman-Roldan
et al. [7]. Schneider et al. [8-10] have used information
theoretic measures in a number of interesting ways from
studying the information content at nucleotide binding
sites to expediting alignment. However, most of the applications of information theory has been to the study of the
correlation properties of DNA sequences [7,11-14]. A significant portion of these are directed toward obtaining a
mechanism for the long range correlation properties of
the DNA sequence, while others study the ability of information theoretic measures to differentiate between coding and non-coding regions or to demonstrate a close
relationship between sequence compositional complexity
of the DNA sequence and the biological complexity of the
organism to which the sequence belongs [15,16].
Another line of approach to understand the compositional structure of DNA sequences has focused on frequency profiles of short oligonucleotides. Karlin and coworkers [17-19] have shown that there is a compositional
bias in bacterial genomic sequences. Blaisdell and coworkers have shown the same for viral sequences [20].
Karlin et al. [21] have used this compositional bias in bacterial genomes to infer evolutionary relationships. The
compositional biases of DNA sequences have also been
studied from the point of view of linguistics. Brendel et al.
[22,23] provide a technique to identify possible short oligonucleotide sequences within DNA sequences based on
the deviation of the frequency of occurrence of these
sequences from their expected value. Bultrini et al. [24]
propose the existence of a pentamer vocabulary characterizing intron and intron-like intergenic tracts. This
approach has been used for intron/exon discrimination as
well as for gene finding.
One important implication of different approaches to
characterize the structure and complexity of DNA
sequences has been the interest in discovering patterns in
genomic sequences that can be used as signatures of species. Such signatures can be useful in a wide variety of contexts. If differences between signatures can be related to
evolutionary distance they can be used for developing
phylogenetic relationships and for understanding evolutionary processes [18,20,21,25].
The existence of reliable genomic species signatures would
have significant implications in developing a rapid identification system using DNA sequences. Bacterially trans-

mitted diseases continue to be a major threat to health
with increasing threat from previously unknown variants,
which have antibiotic resistance. The threat of bioterrorism adds to this potentially lethal mix. In order to respond
to a disease outbreak, whether initiated by natural or artificial means, there is an urgent need for rapid identification of infectious agents to limit exposure and initiate
treatment. Therefore, it is important to identify and
understand structures within the genome of organisms
which differentiate them from each other and from more
benign organisms.
The recent presentation of the genomic sequences of large
microbial populations presents yet another application
for a species signature [26,27]. Tyson et al. used random
shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic
biofilm to identify the structure of the uncultivated microbial community [26]. In a similar approach Venter et al.
targeted a much more complex microbial population collected from the Sargasso Sea region [27]. In this latter
study, approximately 3 million reads yielding about 1.6
billion base pairs of DNA sequences were generated. It is
believed that these sequences belong to at least 1,800
genomic species. These approaches present a very complicated problem of identification and assembling shotgun
reads coming from an unknown number of species. Signatures which can be used to identify and distinguish
between fragments based on their species of origin would
be useful in this process.
Most existing approaches to defining species specific signatures are based on frequency distribution of oligonucleotides, also referred to as "words" [28-30]. However, the
choice of the length of the words and the DNA sequence
window in which the frequency profiles of the words are
observed not only result in data explosion but also change
the composition of the resulting signature. In this paper
we present AMI profile of DNA sequences as a candidate
for species signature. AMI profiles are pervasive in the
sense that they can be detected in small fragments of the
DNA sequence. The proposed genomic signature is a vector where the kth entry is the AMI between nucleotides that
are k locations apart. AMI profiles are generated virtually
free form any parameters resulting in an automated unbiased calculation. We also use this signature to develop a
simple, computationally inexpensive measure of distance
between genomic sequences. We validate this distance
measure by using it with standard phylogenetic algorithms to perform unsupervised clustering.
AMI was first introduced for studying the communication
of signals under noisy channel conditions [31]. In communication theory it is interpreted as a measure of the
information contained in one event X about another
event Y (or vice versa). In the bioinformatics area the aver-

Berryman et al. [37] have used the average mutual information profile to demonstrate long-range correlation in
DNA sequences. More important, from the perspective of
this work, they show that the long-range structures evident in the profile of a sequence results from evolutionary
events such as additions, deletions, and insertions of
repetitive elements. This view is further validated by the
work of Holste et al. [38] which focuses on two specific
peaks at k = 135 and k = 160 in the average mutual information profile of Human Chromosomes 20, 21, and 22.
When they replace Alu repeats in the chromosomes with
random sequences these peaks disappear validating their
contention that the peaks occur due to the presence of Alu
repeats. The discrimination property of AMI was also
demonstrated by Dehnert et al. [39,40] for eukaryotic
chromosomes. Dehnert et al. [39] use the Euclidean distance between AMI profiles and coefficients of autoregressive models to discriminate between various eukaryotic
genomes. Hummel et al. [41] use average mutual information to analyze protein sequence motifs. In the work of
Hmmel et al., as in earlier works [13,42] the different
sequences are first aligned using a multiple sequence
alignment and treated as realizations of a random process.
The probabilities needed to compute the average mutual
information are then obtained from this ensemble.
These results indicate that on some level the AMI profile
can be viewed as a representation of the evolutionary history of the organism. As the AMI profile is an average
measure the structure evinced by the profile is likely to be
pervasive. That is, this history should be reflected to some
extent in all parts of the genome and sufficiently long fragments of the genome should have similar profiles. Organisms that are evolutionarily related have an extensive
common history. If the AMI profile reflects evolutionary
history, this common history should be reflected in similarity of their AMI profiles. In the following we present
evidence to support this hypothesis, based upon which we
suggest that the AMI profile is an excellent candidate for a
species signature.

Results
The AMI profile of chromosomes
We begin with the largest fragments of available DNA
sequences, the chromosomes of eukaryotes. Consider the
AMI profile shown in Figure 1 corresponding to Human
chromosome 1. The abscissa corresponds to the distance
between two bases in the sequence, while the ordinate is
the value of the average mutual information. A larger
value of the average mutual information for a particular
value of k corresponds to higher dependence between
bases k apart. Clearly we would expect higher dependence
between bases closer than between bases further apart.
The various peaks may be the result of a number of factors
including the ratio of coding to noncoding regions and
the existence of various kinds of repeats.

If we now plot the AMI profile for different chromosomes
as shown in Figure 2a, we see that the peaks and valleys
occur at identical locations. This is true of all chromosomes in spite of the significant differences in size and
gene content. We have plotted the AMI profile for values
of k between 5 and 50 to better show the similarities. The
same holds true for other values of k. Note that we have
not tried to align the chromosomes which, given their
diversity, would not have been feasible. Plotting the same
chromosomes for mouse (mus musculus) in Figure 2b, we
see again the similarity between the AMI profiles for the
various chromosomes. We can also see that these profiles
are distinct from those of the human chromosomes.

Average Mutual Information

age mutual information has been used to detect correlated
mutations at noncontiguous sites in a sequence [13], for
secondary structure prediction [32,33] to investigate correlations between sites in protein sequences [7,11,12],
and to differentiate between coding and noncoding
regions [34]. Slonim et al. [35] use average mutual information to formulate the clustering problem in a variety of
settings including gene expression, stock prices, and
movie ratings. Slonim et al. [36] also use average mutual
information to study the relationships between genes and
their phenotypes.

If we repeat this experiment for the chromosomes of C.
elegans we get the same result. Again, when we plot the
profile we see a pattern of peaks and valleys which occur
at the identical locations for all chromosomes of C. elegans. We demonstrate this with five chromosomes of C.
elegans in Figure 3a. Again, while the pattern of peaks and
valleys in the AMI profile is the same for all chromosomes
of C. elegans, this pattern is distinctly different from the
pattern of peaks and valleys in the human and mouse AMI
profiles.
Finally we repeat the experiment for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results are shown in Figure 3b (note the peaks at
multiples of three reflecting a larger proportion of coding
regions compared to the previous examples). Once more
we obtain a sequence of peaks and valleys in the AMI profile which are the same for all chromosomes of S. cerevisiae, and this pattern of peaks and valleys is different from
the patterns in the profiles of the other species.

We then plot AMI profiles for the complete E. coli
sequence (accession number NC_000913) and a 0.5%
fragment of the sequence in Figure 4 to check for pervasiveness. The striking similarity between the profile suggests that AMI profiles can be used to identify random
fragments of a DNA sequence with their species of origin.
We test this hypothesis by computing the correlation coefficient of the AMI profile of 100,000 5 kb long fragments
of the E. coli genome with the AMI profile of the entire
sequence. We also compute the correlation coefficient of
100,000 random fragments from the S. aureus genome
(accession number NC_002758) with the AMI profile of
the E. coli genome. The histograms of the correlation coefficient are shown in Figure 5. The results clearly demonstrate both the pervasiveness of the AMI signature as well
as its specificity.
Finally, to investigate the length of fragment required to
compute a genomic signature we plot the average correla-

tion of profiles of 1000 fragments of genomic DNA with
a reference profile obtained from the entire genome in
Figure 6. The size of the fragments are varied from 200
nucleotides to 10,000 nucleotides. In these experiments
we have restricted the size of the AMI profile to sixteen in
order to easily compute the profiles of short segments. The
reference AMI profile is that of E. coli and the fragments
are from E. coli and S. aureus. As was to be expected, the
plot shows that the correlation between the profiles of the
fragments and the reference profile of the genome
increases with increasing fragment length. While this is
true for profiles of both E. coli and S. aureus fragments,
the profiles of the E. coli fragments are consistently more
correlated with the reference profile than the profiles of
the S. aureus fragments. This is true for all fragment sizes.
This suggests that the AMI profile could be useful in classifying relatively short fragments. All these figures indicate
the existence of a profile specific to a species. Using this as
our motivation we develop a distance measure which can
be used to classify genomic sequences to species of origin.
We verify the utility of this metric by classifying retroviruses based on their host species and by classifying subtypes of the HIV-1 virus.

between less closely related species such as mouse and
yeast. For the species for which we have sequences available the pattern holds for other chromosomes as well.

A distance measure
Noting that genomic sequences from the same species
have similar pattern of peaks and valleys a numerical
measure of the closeness of their AMI profiles can be
obtained by looking at the correlation coefficient between
the AMI profiles. As the larger values of the AMI profile for
small values of k tend to mask the differences between
AMI profiles we evaluate the correlation coefficient for
values of k greater than 5. In our simulations the upper
limit for k was 512. Using values of k greater than 512 did
not effect the results. We define the distance dij between
AMI profiles of the ith and jth sequences to be one minus
the correlation coefficient. Note that to compute distances
between sets of sequences we do not need to align these
sequences. This is especially useful when we look at distances between chromosomes as multiple sequence alignment for whole genomes or chromosomes is an unsolved
problem. The availability of an alignment-free approach
to finding the distance between genomic sequences may
considerably simplify the investigation of genomic relatedness of species based on their sequence information.

Grouping HIV subtypes
The Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) represent a
group of retroviruses that are distinct from endogenous
retroviruses and are not presumed to have originated from
human cellular DNA sequences. However, the life cycle of
these viruses and their genome are essentially the same as
that of all other retroviruses – reverse transcription of the
RNA genome into proviral DNA followed by integration
into host cell chromosomal DNA and the formation of
progeny viral RNA genome by transcription from the proviral DNA. Of the two major types of the HIV virus, HIV1 is the more virulent and is the predominant strain. There
are multiple subtypes of the HIV-1 virus with some degree
of geographic segregation between the various subtypes.
This geographic segregation argues for evolutionary differences between the different subtypes. As such, it should be
feasible to differentiate between the different subtypes
using the AMI profile. The results of our analysis of AMI
profiles of the genomes of twenty one independent viral
isolates listed in Table 3 are shown in Figure 8. The clustering approach used is described in the Methods section.
We also show clustering by plotting three coefficients
from the singular value decomposition of the AMI profiles
in Figure 9. The UPGMA tree, constructed using the distance measure described earlier, corresponding to these
isolates is shown in Figure 10.

We apply this distance measure to three chromosomes
from four species. The particular chromosomes are listed
in Table 1. The distances between these chromosomes are
shown in Table 2. Clearly, the distances between chromosomes from the same species are substantially smaller
than the distances between chromosomes of different species. Furthermore the distances between the AMI profile of
chromosomes of more closely related species such as
mouse and human is substantially less than the distance

It is difficult to show the data for all the chromosomes in
tabular form. We have developed a visualization program
(described in Methods), which gives a visual representation of the distances between AMI profiles. One representation of the distances of the chromosomes of the four
species used in this experiment is shown in Figure 7. Note
that as we are projecting from a multi-dimensional space
into a two-dimensional space the representation is not
unique. However, in order to show that a population can
be separated into different classes all we need to show is
clustering in a single representation. That all the genomic
sequences can be assigned to their particular species is
clear from the figure. The program provides a means of
visualizing the distances between AMI profiles and qualitative evidence for clustering. We can also show visual evidence of clustering using a singular value decomposition.
In the next section we show that these distances can be
used in a quantitative manner with the UPGMA algorithm
to provide unsupervised clustering.

The distance between members of each subgroup is relatively high as compared to DNAs of different chromosomes of the same species. However, the distance between
AMI profiles from different subgroups is higher than

between members of the same subgroup. This is clear
from the clustering evident in Figure 8, Figure 9 and from
the UPGMA tree shown in Figure 10. The AMI profile and
the proposed distance measure may, therefore, allow
functional distinction between genomes that are evolutionarily comparable but have acquired new biological
characteristics.

Discussion
The observations reported here suggest that the average
mutual information analysis of long range genomic structure can yield new insight into the nature of the genome.
The data reported here indicate that entire genomic
sequences can be analyzed (without the need for multiple
alignments) in efforts to gain an understanding of the evolutionary relationship between various species, and
among chromosomes within a single species.
As described here, the average mutual information profile
of genomic structure reveals a great deal of fine structure

in the various sequences available. This structure might
possibly have been ignored, except for the fact that so
much is highly reproducible among the various chromosomes. Based on the fact that the distances between AMI
profiles seem to correlate with evolutionary relationship
we speculate that the structure revealed by the average
mutual information profiles is closely related to the evolution of various species and their genomes. Finally, as the
AMI profile for each sequence is obtained without reference to other sequences there is no need for a multiple
sequence alignment when comparing sequences.

Conclusion
The AMI profile provides a simple, easily computable,
species signature. The signature can be used in applications where evolutionary relationships need to be
deduced using relatively short fragments of DNA as well
as where evolutionary relationships between organisms
are to be studied using large genomic sequence. Distances
between sets of genomic sequences can be obtained with-

be useful, either by itself or in conjunction with other signatures, to discriminate between fragments of DNA from
different species and to identify fragments of genomic
DNA with the species of origin.

Methods
AMI profile for DNA sequences
In this work we examine a particular information theoretic measure, average mutual information, as a candidate
for species signature. If we have two events X and Y which
are independent of each other then the joint probability
of occurrence of the two events, p(X, Y) is simply the product of the probability of occurrence of each event, p(X, Y)
= p(X)p(Y). Thus, the deviation from unity of the ratio p(X,
Y)/[p(X)p(Y)], or the deviation from zero of the logarithm
of this ratio, can be used as a measure of dependence. If
we take X to be the base at some location and Y to be the
base at location k downstream from it we can define an
average measure of dependence as:

Distance between the profiles of Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. elegans, and Human chromosomes

p ( X ,Y )

p k( X , Y ) =

X∈ Y ∈

where  is the set of nucleotides {A, G, C, T}. We have
added the subscript k to the joint probability to show that
the nucleotides occur k bases apart. By plotting the average mutual information for different values of k we can
arrive at a profile for a particular sequence. We refer to this
profile as the average mutual information (AMI) profile.
We compute the average mutual information for bases k
apart by estimating the probabilities using the relative frequencies of occurrence. Let nk(X, Y) be the number of
times two bases k apart take on the values X and Y, where
X and Y can be A, C, G, and T . The joint probabilities pk(X,
Y) are estimated by

∑ I∈ ∑ J∈ n k (I , J )

The marginal probabilities p(X) can similarly be estimated
by dividing the total number of times the nucleotide X
occurs divided by the total number of bases in the
sequence.
The visualization program
The visualization program was developed in order to visualize the distances between a large number of multidimensional vectors. The particular application was to
visualize the distance between AMI profiles of a large
number of DNA sequences.

The program requires as its input a list of the sequences
{si} and their distances {di,j} from each other. The user
can also input just the AMI profile of the sequences. The
program then calculates the distances. These distances are
defined earlier in the paper. Each sequence is treated as a
point in a two or three dimensional free space which is
operated on by "forces" exerted upon it by the points representing all other sequences.
The points corresponding to the sequences are initially
assigned a random locations li in the unit square or cube
and a random velocity vi. For each sequence si a vector
"force" fi,j due to all other sequences sj is calculated. The
force is defined as

This force is calculated for each of the sequences. The vector velocities of the sequences are then updated by displacing them by an amount proportional to the vector
force on them. The update equation for sequence si at time

The constants α, β, and γ were experimentally determined
to provide a good tradeoff between rate of convergence
and jitter. A larger value for these constant will permit a
faster convergence with considerable jitter around the
final configuration, and vice versa. We picked the con-

stants to be 0.7, 0.1, and 0.1. After the locations are
updated the process is repeated until the sequences have
stabilized in their locations. Our observation is that it
requires about fifty iterations for the configuration to stabilize. Keeping in mind that there are multiple stable configurations and to prevent the system from settling into a
local minimum, we randomly perturb the configuration
every 50 updates. The size of the random perturbations is
uniformly distributed in the interval [-.5,.5] and is multiplied by 0.95m where m is the number of random perturbations applied to this point. The 2D version of the
program is available for use at [43].
