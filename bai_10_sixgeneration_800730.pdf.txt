Abstract
Background: The 1555A > G mutation is the most common cause of aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic
deafness. However, the variable clinical phenotype and incomplete penetrance of A1555G-induced hearing loss
complicate our understanding of this mutation. Environmental factors, nuclear genes, mitochondrial haplotypes/
variants and a possible threshold effect have been reported to may be involved in its manifestation.
Methods: Here, we performed a clinical, molecular, genetic and phylogenic analysis in a six-generation Chinese
family.
Results: A clinical evaluation revealed that affected individuals without aminoglycoside exposure developed
hearing loss extending gradually from 12000 Hz to 8000 Hz and then to 4000 Hz. Using pyrosequencing, we
detected an identical homoplasmic 1555A > G mutation in all individuals except one. We did not find any
correlation between the mutation load and the severity of hearing loss. T123N coexisted with the 1555A > G
mutation in six affected subjects in our pedigree. Analysis of the complete mtDNA genome of this family revealed
that this family belonged to haplotype B4C1C and exhibited high penetrance. Upon the inclusion of subjects that
had been exposed to aminoglycosides, the penetrance of the hearing loss was 63.6%.; without exposure to
aminoglycosides, it was 51.5%. This pedigree and another reported Chinese pedigree share the same haplotype
(B4C1C) and lack functionally significant mitochondrial tRNA variants, but nevertheless they exhibit a different
penetrance of hearing loss.
Conclusions: Our results imply that the factors responsible for the higher penetrance and variable expression of
the deafness associated with the 1555A > G mutation in this pedigree may not be mtDNA haplotype/variants, but
rather nuclear genes and/or aminoglycosides.

Background
A number of mitochondrial mutations have been
described to be associated with non-syndromic and syndromic hearing loss. The 1555A > G mutation is the
most common mutation attributed to aminoglycosideinduced and non-syndromic deafness. It was first
described in a large Arab-Israeli family that exhibited
maternally inherited non-syndromic deafness [1].

The first family with aminoglycoside-induced hearing
impairment was reported by Higashi K [2]. Aminoglycosides exert their antibacterial effect by specifically binding to the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting protein
synthesis or inducing mistranslation of messenger RNAs
[3]. In 1993 Prezant et al. [1] first determined that the
1555A > G mutation causes the structure of the mitochondrial 12sRNA to be more similar to that of bacterial
rRNA, thus rendering the mitochondrial ribosomal
decoding site more available to aminoglycoside antibiotics. This strengthens the binding of aminoglycosides to
mitochondrial RNA and causes hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside ototoxicity [4-6]. Clinical phenotypes due to

1555A > G mutation may vary among maternal relatives
within families or among different families, ranging
from severe pre-lingual hearing loss to moderate progressive hearing loss of later onset to no hearing loss at
all in some individuals. However, many studies have
suggested that the 1555A > G mutation leads to only
mild dysfunction and sensitivity to aminoglycosides, as
it alone was insufficient to produce the variable phenotypes of deafness. In contrast, patients carrying the
1555A > G mutation can also suffer from hearing
loss without any aminoglycoside exposure [1,7,8].
Thus the genotype-phenotype relationship between the
1555A > G mutation and deafness is very complicated.
Phenotypic heterogeneity is an unsolved problem of
mitochondrial disorders. Owing to the presence of heteroplasmy, the proportion of mutant mtDNA might be
one of the causes of the variable penetrance and severity
of mitochondrial disorders. There may be a threshold
effect for both the clinical expression and biochemical
defects [8]. In addition, many modifiers are suspected to
be involved, including environmental factors (e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotics), nuclear genes and mitochondrial haplotype/variants [9,10]. Mutations in the nuclear
genes GJB2 and TRMU are reported to influence the
degree of hearing loss in patients with the 1555A > G
mutation [11,12]. Recently, many mitochondrial tRNA
variants have been reported to modulate the penetrance
of the 1555A > G mutation [12-14]. However, the
mechanisms of the phenotype variation and the incomplete penetrance of hearing loss in subjects harboring
the 1555A > G mutation have remained unclear.
Here, we investigated a six-generation Han Chinese
family with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic
hearing loss. An identical 1555A > G mutation was

found in all members of this pedigree. We then performed an evaluation of the possible modifiers mentioned above by 1) quantification of the 1555A > G
mutation load by pyrosequencing (Biotage AB,
PSQ96MA) and 2) analysis of mutations in the nuclear
gene GJB2 and TRMU and 3) phylogenetic tree analysis
to identify the mitochondrial haplogroup.

Methods
Participants and audiologic evaluation

This study was conducted in accordance with the policies of the Ethics Committee of Eye & ENT Hospital,
Fudan University. A six-generation Han Chinese family
with 103 members is shown in Figure 1. Thirty three of
them were examined at the Eye & ENT Hospital of
Fudan University after written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. A comprehensive history
interview was conducted with all participants and a
detailed physical examination by professional otolaryngologists was performed to ensure that there were no
other abnormalities except for deafness. Appropriate
audiological examinations were carried out, including
otoscopic examination, pure-tone audiometry (PTA),
otoacoustic emissions, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes,
auditory brainstem response (ABR). PTA was calculated
from the average of audiometric thresholds at 500, 1000,
2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. The severity of hearing impairment was classified as follows: normal < 26 decibel (dB)
hearing level (HL); mild: 26-40 dBHL; moderate: 41-70
dBHL; severe: 71-90 dBHL; profound: > 90 dBHL.
mtDNA genome analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
using a Paxgene blood DNA kit (Qiagen, Hongkong,

Germany). The entire mitochondrial genomes of the
two probands(IV44, IV45) and one maternal member
in this pedigree were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) in 24 overlapping fragments as
described elsewhere[15]. The PCR products were purified and subsequently analyzed by direct sequencing
analysis in an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer.
Sequences were compared with the revised Cambridge
reference sequence (rCRS) of the human mitochondrial
DNA (Accession No. AC_000021. 2). Oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to 12SrRNA and tRNA were
also used.

Analysis of mitochondrial haplotype and statistical
analysis

Quantification of the mtDNA 1555A > G mutation load

Results

DNAs samples from an unrelated person with normal
hearing (PTA <26 dB) and a person identified as having the 1555A > G mutation were amplified using the
following pair of primers: Forward 5′-CGATCAACCTCACCACCTCT-3′ and Reverse 5′-TGGACAACC
AGCTATCACCA-3′. PCR products were cloned into a
pGEM-T vector and plasmids of all colonies were
sequenced. Two clones were identified, one with the
wild-type genotype and the other with the 1555A > G
mutation. The wild-type and mutated DNA were then
mixed to generate samples with the 1555A > G mutation present at gradient levels ranging from 0%-100%.
Specific SNP assays were performed by pyrosequencing
with the following primers: Forward 5′-ACATTTAACTAAAACCCCTACGCA-3′, Reverse 5′-AGTTGGG
TGCTTTGTGTTAAGCT-3′ and Sequencing 5′CACTTACCATGTTACGACT-3′. Each sample was
analyzed in triplicate by pyrosequencing assays to
determine the detection threshold. Sequencing identification was performed automatically by the SQA
software.

Clinical features and auditory findings

Mutational analysis of the GJB2 gene

Mutations in the GJB2 nuclear gene were analyzed. The
primers used for screening the entire coding region of
GJB2 mutation have been described elsewhere (Forward
5′-TTGGTGTTTGCTCAGGAAGA-3′ Reverse 5′GGCCTACAGGGGTTTCAAAT-3′) [16]. PCR products
were sequenced and compared with the wild-type GJB2
sequence (Accession No. NM_004004.5).

Phylogenetic trees were used to analyze the haplogroups, including mtDB Http://www.genpat.uu.se/
mtDB and the recently updated East Asian mtDNA phylogeny [18]. A logistic procedure and odds ratio estimate
were used to assess the correlation between age and
deafness. The analysis of covariance was used to assess
the factors. The hearing thresholds per frequency was
used as dependent variable, the presence of 1555A < G
mutation, T123N variant in GJB2 gene, age, aminoglycoside exposure as covariates.

All patients came from a large Han Chinese family living in Zhejiang Province (Figure 1). Computed tomography scans of the temporal bones of the two probands
(IV44, IV45) ruled out congenital ear malformations.
Hearing loss was the only symptom and was ascertained
at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University. The
pattern of inheritance was typical maternal transmission.
After a comprehensive clinical review and audiological
and molecular biological examination, we found that 21
out of 33 maternal members carrying the 1555A > G
mutation exhibited bilateral and symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, which was especially severe at high
frequencies. Four of the affected matrilineal relatives in
the fourth generation had a history of aminoglycoside
injection. Subjects V-17 and V28, who displayed normal
hearing and mild deafness, respectively, shared similar
audiograms. There was a slope of hearing loss at high
frequency (8000 Hz) and more severe loss at extended
high frequency (12000 Hz), while the hearing at frequencies 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz was
normal. In the third generation, III7 and III9 showed
mild-to-moderate hearing loss, with normal hearing at
500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz, but an obvious loss at
high frequencies (4000 Hz, 8000 Hz) and no response at
12000 Hz (Figure 2). The exact timing of aminoglycoside exposure, audiometric configuration, severity of
deafness and age of onset are shown in Table 1. The
penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree was 63.6%
(included aminoglycosides received) and 51.5%
(excluded aminoglycosides received).

Mutational analysis of the TRMU gene

The forward and reverse primers for the A10 S variant
in the TRMU gene are 5′-ACAGCGCAGAAGAAGAGCAGT-3′ and 5′-ACAACGCCACGACGGACG-3′,
repectively. The PCR segments were subsequently analyzed and compared with the TRMU genomic sequence
(Accession No. AF_448221) [17].

Mitochondrial DNA and haplogroup analysis

We sequenced the mitochondrial 12SrRNA and tRNA
genes of all participants in this pedigree (GFX). By
direct sequencing, the 1555A > G mutation was the
only detected pathogenic mutation. To assess the association of the mitochondrial haplotype with the

penetrance and phenotypic expression of the 1555A > G
mutation, the two probands (IV44, IV45) and another
affected relative received a complete mitochondrial genomes spanning and sequencing. Many variants were
detected (Table 2). According to the recently updated
East Asian mtDNA phylogeny and mtDB, this pedigree
thus can be grouped into haplotype B4C1C (Figure 3)
[14].
Mutational analysis of the nuclear gene GJB2 and TRMU

To explore the role of the GJB2 gene and the A10 S
variant in the TRMU gene in the hearing loss phenotype
of this pedigree, we screened GJB2 and A10 S variant in
maternal individuals. The V27I (79G > A) and I203T
(608T > C) in the GJB2 gene were detected as homozygous status in maternal relatives. Seven maternal relatives, six of whom suffered from hearing loss were
found to be heterozygous for the T123N (368T > C)

SNP (Table 1). We failed to detect any variant in
TRMU in affected maternal relatives who did not have a
history of exposure to aminoglycosides.
Detection of the threshold of the 1555A > G mutation

Using pyrosequencing, we examined all maternal relatives, one spouse in this pedigree and one unrelated
individual. All matrilineal relatives of this family were
found to be homoplasmic for the 1555A > G mutation
except for subject II2 who was heteroplasmic. The exact
load of the mutation in each subject is shown (Table 1,
Figure 4).

Discussion
The hereditary pattern of aminoglycoside hypersensitivity is usually consistent with maternal transmission,
implying mitochondrial genome involvement. In our
study, we found that in six generations of a Han family

affected with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss, the mode of inheritance was strictly
maternal. Therefore, we performed a series of tests for
mitochondrial disease, including clinical examination,
molecular biological investigationl, genetic analysis, pyrosequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis for this pedigree. The mtDNA analysis indicated that the 1555A > G
mutation was the only pathogenic mutation. Furthermore, we detected the identical homoplasmic 1555A >
G mutation in all members of this pedigree except II2,
who was heteroplasmic for the mutation. In addition,
the pedigree exhibited a high penetrance and phenotypic
expression of hearing loss carrying 1555A > G mutation
with 63.6% of the family members suffering from hearing loss.
Pyrosequencing technology is an accurate, sensitive
and specific way to detect heteroplasmy and to quantify
the mutation load [19]. Pyrosequencing was used by
Ballana et al [19] to detect unrecognized low-level
mtDNA heteroplasmy in a three-generation heteroplasmic family harboring the 1555A > G mutation. Similar
to Castillo, they found a slight correlation between the

heteroplasmic mutation load and the severity of hearing
loss [19,20]. Interestingly, we did not find such a correlation in the present study.
It has been suggested that mtDNA haplotypes could
modulate the penetrance and phenotype of mtDNA
mutations. The phylogenetic tree can be a very helpful
approach to assessing the origin of an mtDNA mutation
[21,22]. Phylogenetic analyses of a family with Leber’s
hereditary optic neurophy (LHON) suggested that the
mtDNA haplotype J increased the penetrance of a disease-causing LHON mutation in Europe [23]. In contrast, Torroni et al [24] concluded that the specific
European haplotype had no effect on the clinical phenotype of the mtDNA A3243G mutation. To assess the
effect of haplotype on disease penetrance, we performed
a complete mitochondrial genomic analysis in this pedigree (GFX). In addition to the identical 1555A > G
mutation, we found a set of mtDNA polymorphisms.
According to the recently updated East Asian mtDNA
phylogenetic tree and mtDB, we were able to classify
this pedigree as haplotype B4C1C based on the observed
variants (A16183C, T16189C, 9-bpdel, T16217C,

another Chinese pedigree (WZD1), which is known to
be associated with 1555A > G-induced hearing loss,
turned out to be haplotype B4C1C rather than haplotype B4C1C1, according to the haplotype system

developed by Tanaka et al [25]. This pedigree showed a
strikingly low penetrance of hearing loss (5.9%). Thus,
with the effect of aminoglycosiders included, the penetrance of hearing loss in these two Chinese families was
63.6% and 5.9%, respectively. Without the effect of aminoglycosides, the penetrance in the two pedigrees was

51.5% and 0%, respectively. Interestingly, the two pedigrees shared the same mitochondrial haplotype (B4C1C)
in the same racial background and yet exhibited different penetrances. Thus, the mtDNA haplotype may not
have any effect on penetrance. Torroni et al [26] used a
phylogenetic tree to analyze 50 Spanish families and 4
Cuban families carrying the 1555A > G mutation, and
they found that different mtDNA haplotypes are not
responsible for the variable phenotype of the 1555A > G

mutation. This finding was further strengthened by
Casano et al. in their studies of an Italian family [27].
However, the effect of mtDNA haplotype on penetrance
could differ between regional groups, as the mtDNA of
European and East Asians occupy different branches of
the world phylogeny, In their reappraisal of the complete mtDNA of Chinese and Japanese families suffering
from deafness, Yao et al [21]concluded that the mtDNA
background may not play a decisive role in modulating

Bai et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2010, 11:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/11/129

the phenotypic expression of the 1555A > G mutation in
an East Asian background. While sharing the same ethnic and haplotypic background, both the pedigree in our
study and pedigree WZD1 exhibited strikingly different
clinical phenotypes and penetrances. This finding as
well as those of Yao, Torroni and Casano, indicates that
haplotype B4C1C may not play a substantial role in the
penetrance and expression of the 1555A > G mutation
associated with deafness. Given the mounting evidence
that haplotype (whether in different racial groups or in a
similar racial background) does not have a major effect
on penetrance, there may be other factors. Recently,
Guan et al [12-14] reported that mitochondrial tRNAGlu

tRNA G5821A, ND5T12338C and ND4G11696A
seemed to account for the higher penetrance and
expressivities in many Chinese pedigrees associated with
the 1555A > G mutation and deafness. Conversely, they
postulated that the absence of those functionally significant mutations in tRNA and rRNAs or a secondary
LHON mutation in these Chinese pedigrees might
account for the very low penetrance of hearing loss.
However, the pedigree that we studied which did not
have a secondary mtDNA mutation or the above functionally significant mutations, nevertheless exhibited
high levels of penetrance and phenotype of hearing loss.
Thus, the role of the mitochondrial haplotype or functional variants in the penetrance and expression of hearing loss seems to be questionable based on our
pedigree. Nuclear genes and aminoglycosides may be
responsible for the higher penetrance and more variable
clinic phenotypes.
To better understand the role of nuclear genes in phenotype variation, we analyzed GJB2 in this pedigree and
identified homozygous V27I (79G > A) and I203T
(608T > C) and heterozygous T123N (368C > A). Six of
the maternal subjects harboring heterozygous T123N
had hearing loss except subject V18 (Tab. 1). T123N
was absent in other maternally related family members
with the 1555A > G mutation. Subject III7, who carried
T123N, had the worst hearing in the third generation
without any aminoglycoside exposure. In the fourth generation, we found T123N in five affected subjects, of
which one(IV21) had moderate hearing loss without a
history of aminoglycoside exposure, while the others
four, all of whom had aminoglycoside exposure, exhibited severe or profound deafness. It appears that the
coexistence of T123N and aminoglicoside use led to
more severe deafness. In the fifth generation, T123N
was found in subject V18, who had a normal hearing.
As V18 was only 6 years old and son of IV21, we performed a logistic procedure and odds ratio estimate to
assess the correlation between age and deafness. We

found age to be a high risk factor in this pedigree (OR
= 1.206). It will be interesting to find out whether IV18
dose experience hearing lose in the future. Based on
results above, there may be a slight correlation between
hearing loss and T123N (except in the case V18).
T123N is located in CL functional domain of GJB2.
This mutation was reported to be an unknown diseasecausing mutation in the Connexin-deafness mutations
database at http://davinci.crg.es/deafness [28] and it was
identified in Japanese and Chinese patients. Nevertheless, T123N is not highly conserved at position 123 and
this mutation was found in both the control group and
the patient group. In addition, was counted as a mutation in a Japanese group but as a neutral variant in a
Chinese study [16,29]. Overall T123N was an unclassified mutation in GJB2. Due to its unclear clinical implication and coexistence with the 1555A > G mutation in
six affected subjects in our pedigree, we suspect that the
heterozygous T123N may be relevant of the phenotype
expression and penetrance of hearing loss in this
pedigree. However, this interpretation should be taken
with caution, as determining the exact pathogenic role
of T123n will require further investigation and functional tests.
It was reported that the A10 S mutation in TRMU
gene modulated the phenotypic expression of the 1555
A> G mutation in the Israeli/European pedigrees [17].
To assess the role of the A10 S variant in this pedigree,
we carried out a mutational screening of exon 1 in
TRMU gene, We failed to detect any variant in TRMU
exon 1 in affected maternal subjects of this pedigree. So,
the absence of A10 S variant in gene TRMU ruled out it
involvement in the phenotypic expression of the 1555
A> G mutation in this Chinese family.
In our clinical evaluation, we noticed that the degree
of the deafness in fourth generation was worse than in
the third and fifth generations. Almost of all the affected
subjects in the fourth generation presented severe or
profound hearing loss with a clear history of aminoglycoside exposure or uncertain history of aminoglycoside,
while those in the fourth and fifth generations without
histories of aminoglycoside exposure showed normal or
mild hearing loss. As II-2 was a 102-year-old woman
with severe hearing loss, her hearing loss might be a
consequence of age-related hearing impairment combined with the specific genetic defect. Meanwhile, we
noted that IV-25 began suffering hearing loss after only
two streptomycin injections at age 4. This is consistent
with previous findings that Chinese patients with the
1555A > G mutation suffer severe hearing loss with
immediate onset after exposure to a very small dose of
aminoglycosides. In contrast, in American patients, the
hearing loss is mild and progressive over many years
after aminoglycoside administration [10]. Some studies

Bai et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2010, 11:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/11/129

have implicated the cochlear neuroepithelia as the major
vulnerable site to aminoglycoside ototoxicity. In general,
irreversible cochlear damage is first seen in the outer
hair cells of the cochlear basal turn and then in the
upper cochlear turns and inner hair cells [30]. The
outer hair cells in the basal turn are reported to contain
more mitochondria, which suggest that the ability to
discern high frequencies is more easily affected than
that of low frequencies [31]. Because hearing loss in the
affected individual without aminoglycoside exposure is
too mild to be discerned by other family members,
audiometry is required to diagnose high-frequency hearing loss in these affected relatives. We used highfrequency audiometry to test the affected subjects with
mild-moderate hearing loss at extended high frequency
(12000 Hz). After analyzing the audiograms of the
affected subjects without a history of aminoglycoside
exposure, we found the hearing loss of these subjects
gradually extended from 12000 Hz to 8000 Hz and then
to 4000 Hz (Figure. 2). All subjects were not aware of
their hearing loss. Using the high-frequency audiometry,
we could detect hearing loss at the 12000 Hz frequency
early, particularly in hypersensitive subjects harboring
the 1555A > G mutation without histories of aminoglycoside exposure or clinical syndrome. As hearing loss
due to the 1555A > G mutation is permanent, early
identification could help hypersensitive subjects avoid
using amiloglycosides, thus reducing the risk of irreversible cochlear damage.

Conclusions
In summary, we have analyzed possible modifiers associated with hearing loss due to the 1555A > G mutation.
First, we found that the load of the 1555A > G mutation is
not correlated with phenotype expression or penetrance in
this family. Second, our pedigree exhibits a statistically different penetrance from another reported Chinese pedigree,
both of which share haplotype B4C1C and lack functionally significant mitochondrial tRNA or rRNA variants. Our
data further strengthen the idea that haplotype background and functional variants may not play a substantial
role in the penetrance and expression of the deafness associated with the 1555A > G mutation. Rather nuclear genes
and/or aminoglycoside exposure may be responsible for
the higher penetrance and variability of hearing loss with
the 1555A > G mutation in our pedigree. Third, the covariance analysis showed that m.1555A > G and aminoglycoside exposure are main influence factors, but no frequency
specificity. The m.1555A > G places the individual at risk
for hearing loss, but the severity and penetrance of hearing
lossis based on the interplay of mutation with other factors
such as unknown nuclear genes and/or aminoglycoside
exposure.
