Abstract
Background: Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is a zoonotic pathogen, which
can be found in many sources including animals and the environment. However, little is known
about the molecular relatedness among S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources. We have
applied multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) to study the genetic
diversity of S. Enteritidis isolates from human and non-human sources.
Results: We identified 38 unique MLVA types using nine VNTR loci markers for discrimination
between 145 S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources including humans (n = 41), chickens (n =
45), and eggs (n = 40). There were 20 distinct MLVA types identified from human isolates, 17
distinct MLVA types from chicken isolates, and 5 from egg isolates. We compared allele distribution
and frequency for each VNTR marker and measured allelic polymorphism within each VNTR locus
of S. Enteritidis isolates from the sources using Nei's diversity index (D). Differences in allele
distribution and frequency were detected in most loci of study isolates. Different genetic diversity
for certain loci was identified in isolates from different sources. The average of genetic diversity (D)
was lower in egg isolates (0.16) compared to human (0.41) and chicken (0.30). However, for loci
SE3, SE7, and SE9, human isolates showed significantly higher diversity than both chicken and egg
isolates. Whereas for loci SE5 and SE10, chicken isolates had significantly higher diversity than both
human and egg isolates. Minimum-spanning tree (MST) comprised one major cluster, a minor
cluster, and four clonal expansions. MLVA application enabled a cluster analysis by the MST of the
S. Enteritidis isolates by sources, which allows a great insight into the genetic relatedness and the
possible flow of these organisms between different reservoirs and humans.
Conclusion: Differences in allele distribution and genetic diversity of VNTR loci in S. Enteritidis
isolates from different sources were found. Polymorphism in most of the VNTR loci was more
frequent among human S. Enteritidis isolates than isolates from chickens or eggs. Therefore, VNTR
profiles of S. Enteritidis isolates from a specific source should be further evaluated as potential
markers in epidemiologic investigations to trace S. Enteritidis to their probable source.

Background
Salmonella serotypes are estimated to cause 1.4 million
cases, more than 500 deaths, and cause severe economic
losses which approach from $0.5 to 2.3 billion per year in
the United States [1]. Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) emerged during the last three decades,
currently ranking 2nd most common serotypes in the
United States. Furthermore, S. Enteritidis is the most common serotype in Europe and other parts of the worlds
[2,3].
Ecologically, S. Enteritidis is a zoonotic pathogen that is
harbored by many reservoirs and is transmissible to
humans largely through contaminated foods. Several epidemiologic studies indicated the important role of eggs
and poultry meat as major vehicles in the transmission of
the organisms to human consumers [3-5]. S. Enteritidis
can contaminate eggs through transovarian transmission
during egg development in the infected chickens [6,7].
Genetically, S. Enteritidis probably originated from an
ancestral clone that led to the evolution of several minor
clones based on a phylogenetic analyses of a large groups
of isolates [8]. However, little is known about the molecular relatedness among S. Enteritidis isolates from different reservoirs (or sources). While some reports described
the existence of specific molecular attributes among S.
Enteritidis associated with outbreak cases, the homogeneity of the S. Enteritidis genome renders typing tools such
as PFGE insufficient for molecular characterization to
establish relatedness among isolates from cases and probable sources for infection [9,10].
PFGE and phage typing have been combined to characterize S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources [10,11].
Although phage typing is still commonly used for the epidemiologic investigation of S. Enteritidis infections
worldwide, this method has several shortcomings including the occurrence of non-typeable strains and the possible phage conversion among S. Enteritidis isolates [12].
Therefore, more efficient subtyping methods may be
needed to relate disease-causing pathogens to their probable sources.
We have recently described an optimized MLVA technique
using a single multiplex PCR followed by multicolor capillary gel electrophoresis and demonstrated that it has a
higher discriminatory power than PFGE and phage typing
in limited samples [13]. In that report, we suggested that
MLVA subtyping together with PFGE would enhance the
effectiveness of epidemiologic investigation of S. Enteritidis infections. The utility of VNTR analysis in characterizing Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from human, pig,
and poultry was reported. The most frequent alleles at
each locus were compared and it was concluded that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/146

VNTR analysis might be potentially used for source attribution. [14].
In the present report we have updated the MLVA system
using two panels of multiplex PCR and analyzed larger
number of S. Enteritidis from different sources, including
humans, chickens, and eggs. The objective of this study
was to characterize S. Enteritidis isolates from human and
non-human sources by 1) comparing the allele distribution of VNTR loci, 2) comparing genetic diversity of VNTR
loci, and 3) describing the relationship between VNTR
profiles and sources of isolates.

Results
Distribution of MLVA types by phage types among S.
Enteritidis from different sources
The 145 S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources
included 14 different phage types and 38 different MLVA
types (Additional file 1). There were 20 distinct MLVA
types identified from human isolates, 17 distinct MLVA
types from chicken isolates, 5 from egg isolates, and 8
from other sources The most common MLVA type among
isolates from humans was "A0". It was found in 9 (22%)
of 41 human isolates. MLVA type "A9" was the most common (20%) among 17 distinct MLVA types found in 45
chicken isolates. MLVA type A4 was the most common
(53%) among 5 different MLVA types found in 40 egg isolates.

Characterization of the most common S. Enteritidis phage
types including PT8 (n = 46), PT13a (n = 45), PT28 (n =
25), and PT4 (n = 10) by specific MLVA types resulted in
the following subgroups: Out of 46 S. Enteritidis isolates
belonging to PT8, 15 isolates (32.6%) were MLVA type
"A0" (χ2, p < 0.001) and15 isolates (32.6%) were MLVA
type "A4" (χ2, p = 0.003).
The isolates with type "A0" and PT8 were significantly
associated with humans (Fisher's exact, p < 0.05) whereas
isolates with type "A4" and PT8 was significantly associated with egg source (χ2, p < 0.0001).
No significant associations were found between PT13a
and specific MLVA types. Among 25 isolates of PT28, 4
belonged to MLVA type "A9", and 5 belonged to MLVA
type "AM" (Fisher's exact, p < 0.05). The isolates with type
"A9" and PT28 were significantly associated with chickens
(Fisher's exact, p < 0.05) whereas isolates with type "AM"
and PT28 were significantly associated with eggs. (Fisher's
exact, p < 0.005). Among 10 isolates of PT4, 4 belonged to
MLVA type "A6" (Fisher's exact, p < 0.01).

Tandem repeats and allele distribution of VNTR loci
among S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources
Most of the VNTR loci markers had different allele distribution among isolates from human chicken, and egg
sources (Table 1). Significant differences in allele frequency at VNTR locus SE1 were found in isolates from
chickens and eggs compared to isolates from humans
(human vs. chicken; human vs. egg, p < 0.01). Significant
differences in allele distribution were observed at the following VNTR loci: locus SE2 from the isolates (human vs.
chicken, p < 0.05; human vs. egg, p < 0.01), locus SE3
(human vs. chicken; p = 0.05; human vs. egg, Fisher's
exact, p < 0.01), locus SE5 (human vs. egg, p < 0.05), locus
SE7 (human vs. chicken; human vs. egg, p < 0.01), locus
SE8 (human vs. chicken; chicken vs. egg, p < 0.01), and
locus SE9 (human vs. chicken; human vs. egg, Fisher's
exact, p < 0.01).
Genetic Diversity of VNTR loci markers among isolates
from different sources
The genetic diversity based on Nei's index of diversity (D)
for nine VNTR loci ranged from 0.05 to 0.70 (Median:
0.28, Mean: 0.34). VNTR loci SE5 and SE2 were identified
to be the most polymorphic loci (diversity indices of 0.70
and 0.65, respectively, Table 1) while loci SE6 and SE10
were less polymorphic with indices of less than 0.1.

The genetic diversity ranged from 0 to 0.68 (Median: 0.48;
Mean: 0.41) for human isolates, 0 to 0.76 (Median: 0.17;
Mean: 0.30) for chicken isolates, 0 to 0.45 (Median: 0.0;
Mean: 0.16) for egg isolates, and 0 to 0.83 (Median: 0.45;
Mean: 0.42) for others (Table 1). There were significant
differences in the means of the diversity values (D) for
seven polymorphic loci between isolates from human and
egg sources (p < 0.001) and for eight polymorphic loci
between isolates from chicken and egg sources (p = 0.01)
while differences in the means for nine polymorphic loci
between human and chicken isolates were not significant
(p = 0.16).
Genetic diversity for each locus was compared between
isolates from different sources (Additional file 2). Diversity for loci SE1, SE3, SE7, SE8, and SE9 was significantly
higher in human isolates than in chicken isolates (p <
0.05) while the diversity for loci SE5 and SE10 was significantly higher in chicken isolates than in human isolates
(p < 0.05). The genetic diversity values (D) for loci SE1,
SE2, SE3, SE5, SE7, and SE9 were significantly higher in
human isolates than in egg isolates (p < 0.05). The genetic
diversity values (D) for loci SE2, SE3, SE5, SE7, and SE10
were significantly higher in chicken isolates than in egg
isolates (p < 0.05).
Overall genotype diversity (based on Simpson's index of
diversity) was significantly higher in MLVA (0.92, 95% CI:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/146

0.90–0.95) compared to phage typing (0.77, 95%CI:
0.73–0.81). The MLVA genotype diversity was significantly higher in isolates from humans (0.93, 95% CI:
0.88–0.97) and isolates from chickens (0.91, 95% CI:
0.87–0.95), compared to isolates from eggs (0.68, 95%CI:
0.55–0.80).
MLVA clusters by Minimum-spanning tree (MST)
Minimum-spanning tree (MST) was created based on 38
distinct MLVA types of 145 isolates from four different
sources as described in Figure 1. The MST yielded a major
cluster, a minor cluster, and four clonal expansions from
the clusters. Many source-specific clones were identified.
In the major cluster, clone A4 primarily consisted of isolates from eggs [21/27 (78%)] and clone A9 comprised
only isolates from chickens [9/9 (100%)]. A big clone A0
in the major cluster includes isolates from all four sources.
A small cluster, which is genetically distant from the
major cluster, consisted mostly of isolates from humans.

Source-specific MLVA type is defined as a single MLVA
type of S. Enteritidis isolate from a specific source. Of 38
MLVA types, 31 (81.6%) were source-specific and the
other 7 MLVA types (18.4%) were associated with isolates
from multiple sources. Among a total of 126 isolates from
human, chicken, and egg sources, 60 isolates were classified into 29 source-specific MLVA types (Figure 2).
Twenty-four (58.5 %) of 41 human S. Enteritidis isolates
belonged to 15 source-specific MLVA types. The other 17
human isolates belonged to 5 MLVA types that were identified among isolates from non-human sources. However,
there was no significant difference in the proportion of
isolates belonging to specific MLVA types from humans
compared to chickens and eggs (χ2, p = 0.09). Among the
45 chicken S. Enteritidis isolates, 30 (66.7%) isolates were
classified into 13 source-specific MLVA types. These specific MLVA types were significantly associated with isolates from chickens compared to isolates from humans
and eggs (χ2, p = 0.001). Six (15%) of 40 egg isolates
belonged to one egg-specific MLVA type. Therefore, these
findings suggest that specific MLVA types are more commonly associated with isolates from humans and chickens
than isolates from eggs.

Discussion
Salmonella Enteritidis circulates among several animal reservoirs particularly poultry, other animals and the environment. Human infections are frequently acquired from
consumption of contaminated eggs and poultry meat as
well as foods contaminated with the organism.
Prevention and control of the disease caused by S. Enteritidis in human and animal populations require sensitive
and specific molecular epidemiologic tools. However,

Minimum-spanning tree of MLVA
Minimum-spanning tree of MLVA. Each MLVA type is indicated by one node or branch tip, displayed as circles that are
connected by branches of minimum-spanning tree. A two-letter code within each circle uniquely identifies each MLVA type,
which is coded in a combination of the first letter ("A" or "B") and the second letter (any of alphabetical "A-Z" or a numerical
"1–9 "). Clonal complexes were created based on maximum neighbor distance of changes at two loci and minimum size of two
types. The length of the branches represents genetic distances (changes in loci) between two neighboring types. The sizes of
the different color-circles depend on their population size. Wedges in circles indicate the proportion of isolates from respective sources with a particular MLVA type. In case of equivalent solutions in terms of calculated distance, the highest number of
single locus variants (SLVs; in case two types have an equal distance to a linkage position in the tree, the type that has the highest number of SLVs is linked first) associated was used as the priority rule for linking types in the tree.

Distribution of MLVA type with sources of isolates and VNTR profiles
Distribution of MLVA type with sources of isolates and VNTR profiles. The categorical coefficients and UPGMA
(unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages) were used to generate a dendrogram. Null: No amplification of the
allele. Bold type represents specific sources of S. Enteritidis (human, chicken, or egg).

molecular relatedness among S. Enteritidis isolates from
different reservoirs is not well studied.
Liebana et al [10] used genetic fingerprinting methods
(ribotyping, PFGE, and plasmid profiling) for the assessment of diversity within S. Enteritidis isolates from poultry farms. They concluded that a single typing method was
not sufficient for discrimination and that a more sensitive
method is needed to discriminate between strains from
the different geographical and animal origins [10].

Multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA), which has been recently developed for subtyping
of S. Enteritidis isolates from human sporadic cases,
showed high epidemiological concordance in outbreak
strains [15].
We have recently optimized and evaluated MLVA using a
multiplex PCR and demonstrated sufficient allelic variation that subdivided the S. Enteritidis strains from human
and non-human sources into numerous multilocus geno-

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:146

types that constituted major clonal groups. Therefore,
MLVA with high discriminatory power may be used to
enhance the effectiveness of molecular epidemiologic
investigation of S. Enteritidis infections [13].
In this study, we identified different allele distribution at
most VNTR loci among S. Enteritidis isolates from different sources which suggests that patterns of allele distribution at some of the loci might be unique to isolates from
specific sources. Therefore, the VNTR loci of unique allele
distribution pattern can be used as potential markers for
source tracking in the investigation of sporadic or outbreak cases.
Among the nine loci, SE2 and SE5 had a wide range of
alleles per locus (higher variation of tandem repeats numbers) and their genetic diversity values (D) were also
higher than other loci, resolving more frequent variation
of these loci among isolates from humans and chickens
than isolates from eggs (Table 1). Since these two loci may
be hyper-mutatable, these findings are in support of the
possible role of reservoir on the mutational rate or genetic
variation of the S. Enteritidis isolates.
Variation in the number of repeat sequences at a given
locus or sequence heterogeneity among individual units
may be due to slipped-strand mispairing (SSM) which can
occur in combination with inadequate DNA mismatch
repair pathways during replication [16,17]. This instability can occur at a frequency of 10-4 event per bacterial cell
division and allows for a high frequency of genetic switching. Bacteria can use this random event to adapt their
genetic repertoire in response to selective environmental
pressure [17].
In this study, bacterial-host interaction could have contributed to broad genetic diversity of S. Enteritidis isolates
from humans and chickens as compared to isolates from
eggs that had significantly lesser genetic diversity. This
may be explained in part by the fact that egg isolates represent lineage of specific clones of S. Enteritidis that are
capable of causing transovarian transmission in the laying
hens. A recent study suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in the genomic fragment of
S. enterica was linked to genetic drift within S. Enteritidis
that is associated with egg contamination [18]. Furthermore, a differentially regulated gene that is responsible for
persistence or survival of the S. Enteritidis in egg albumin
was identified [19]. Whether SNPs variations or the differentially regulated genes have a modulating effect on the
VNTR diversity in isolates from eggs, more focused investigation including virulence profiling and VNTR analyses
of isolates from different sources may be needed. Additionally, it is conceivable that humans may be more likely
exposed to multiple strains of S. Enteritidis due perhaps to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/146

frequent travel or consumption of contaminated foods
that may be originated from diverse locations or sources
[15]. Therefore, it is conceivable that multiple infection
sources and the high multiplication rate of S. Enteritidis in
humans and chickens could have resulted in higher
genetic diversity of these isolates compared to egg isolates
in which the lower genetic diversity may be due to their
clonal selection as invasive strains and their low multiplication inside eggs.
Stability of VNTR markers for S. Enteritidis has been previously reported [15] and in another study, VNTR markers
for S. Typhimurium (including STTR3 and STTR5) were
found to be stable during the course of outbreak [20].
Additionally, we have demonstrated the stability of VNTR
loci in S. Enteritidis before and during experimental infection of a group of egg laying hens. VNTR profiles were
studied on isolates from internal organs from a subgroup
of the infected birds at two week-intervals during the one
months experiment (unpublished data). Therefore, the
stability of the VNTR markers in this study has been well
documented.
We have included in this study, groups of isolates from
human and nonhuman sources within the same time
frame (1990s) for comparison using MLVA. Application
of the same MLVA protocol on recent isolates from 245
human clinical cases of Salmonella Enteritidis that took
place (between 2000–2007) produced similar useful
MLVA-based groups (to be published elsewhere).
In comparing isolates from different sources for genetic
diversity for each locus, different allelic diversity for certain loci was identified in isolates from different sources;
human isolates showed significantly higher diversity in
SE3, SE7, and SE9 loci than both chicken and egg isolates.
Chicken isolates at loci SE5 and SE10 loci had significantly higher diversity than both human and egg isolates.
These data may suggest an important role for the host in
the genetic variation that can be encountered among S.
Enteritidis isolates from different sources.
In this study, MLVA application enabled the MST cluster
analysis of the S. Enteritidis isolates by source allowing a
great insight into the possible flow of these organisms
between different reservoirs and humans as the most
important accidental host. The clusters show a close relatedness among egg isolates. The isolates in the minor cluster appeared to be genetically far distant from isolates in
the major cluster. A minor cluster consists mostly of PT4like isolates (PT4 and PT1) whereas most PT8-like isolates
(including PT8, PT13a, and PT23) belonged to the major
cluster. Most of the PT4 isolates from humans clustered
together in the upper part of the dendrogram (Figure 2).
These results are consistent with previous studies in which

Page 7 of 11

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:146

two separate lineages of serotype Enteritidis phage types
were suggested based on difference in the LPS [21] and
based on presence of a subset of phage regions [22].
For epidemiologic purposes, MLVA subtyping can be
promising in that it is of high discriminatory power,
reproducibility, is less labor-intensive than PFGE analysis,
more easy to interpret and enables comparison of data
between laboratories [23].
One of the advantages of MLVA over PFGE is that the variation that is resolved can be interpreted as allelic variation at specific chromosomal loci, thus opening the door
for population genetic analyses and phylogenetic inference. Moreover, from a foodborne surveillance perspective, MLVA is more discriminatory than PFGE for S.
Enteritidis strains and provides better epidemiological
concordance [15]. Due to the ease and practical comparison of the profiles, MLVA can be used as a powerful subtyping tool for S. Enteritidis isolates in addition to current
methods used to report molecular types of foodborne
pathogens to central laboratories.

Conclusion
We found that there are differences in allele distribution
and genetic diversity of VNTR loci in S. Enteritidis isolates
from different sources. Polymorphism in most of the
VNTR loci was more frequent among human S. Enteritidis
isolates than isolates from chickens or eggs. Multiple
infection sources and rate of multiplication of S. Enteritidis in humans and chickens may lead to a higher genetic
diversity whereas isolates from contaminated eggs have
lower genetic diversity due to the fact that they may represent a select invasive clones of the organisms associated
with a low multiplication inside the eggs. Therefore,
VNTR profiles of S. Enteritidis isolates from a specific
source should be further evaluated as potential markers
for epidemiologic studies for tracing S. Enteritidis to their
probable source.

Methods
Bacterial strains and sources
A total of 145 strains of S. Enteritidis (Additional file 3)
were selected from a previously reported source pool (n =
1,273) of S. Enteritidis that were preserved at -80°C in
Tryptic Soy Broth with 15 % glycerol [8]. Three main
sources of strains consisted of humans (clinical isolates
from human patients, n = 41), eggs (recovered from the
internal contents of chicken eggs, n = 40), and chickens
(cecal isolates representing the diversity of intestinally carried S. Enteritidis from chickens, n = 45). Most of the S.
Enteritidis strains from human sources were isolated
between 1990 and 1999 from sporadic cases of human S.
Enteritidis infections in Indiana based on a collaborative
effort with Indiana State Department of Health. Whereas,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/146

the egg isolates were from surveys we conducted in Pennsylvania and Indiana, two of the top five egg producing
states in the nation during 1991–1994. Most of the
chicken isolates were from cecal samples we cultured, as
USDA-contractor for the National Spent Hen Surveys
(1991–1995) to process the cecal samples from spent
hens from 13 poultry farms in the Midwest [24].
Isolates from other sources included: mouse (n = 4), mink
(n = 4), bovine (n = 2), mule deer (n = 1), sea lion (n = 1),
canine (n = 1), and chicken farm environment (n = 6).
The 145 strains were selected to make a representative
sample collection for this study using selection by random
digit numbers and using exclusion by consideration of
phenotypic (phage type and attachment & invasiveness
pattern to Hep2 cell), genotypic characteristics (MLEE),
and year of isolation.
Purity of each isolate was confirmed with biochemical
and serological testing and phage typing. Human S. Enteritidis isolates were phage typed at Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and isolates from animal sources
were phage typed at the National Veterinary Service Laboratory (NVSL, Ames, IA) using phage typing scheme
described by Ward et al (1987)[25].
DNA isolation and multiplex PCR
DNA was extracted from each strain grown on tryptic soy
agar plates overnight and then prepared as previously
described [13]. Nine VNTR loci were amplified with two
reaction sets of multiple primer mix (set A containing
primer SE1, SE3, SE8, and SE10; set B containing primer
SE2, SE5, SE6, SE7, and SE9) using fluorescently labeled
forward primers (Sigma-Proligo, Boulder, CO) and nonlabeled reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Coralville, IA) as described in Table 2. Tandem repeats
sequences and their primers were described previously
[13,15]. Primer sets for loci SE6 and SE10 were redesigned
in this study to remove non-specific PCR amplicons when
multiplex PCR is applied.

A master mix was made with components for 15 μl reactions containing 7.5 μl of 2× Qiagen multiplex PCR Master mix, 1.8 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM; in a reaction set B), 1.5
μl of 10× primer mix (0.3–1.0 μM per each primer), 3 μl
of the dilute DNA template, and RNase-free water to a volume of 15 μl. Samples were put on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were
95°C for 15 min of pre-denature, then 35 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 58°C for 90 s, 72°C for 90 s followed by a final
elongation of 60°C for 30 min. The fragment size for each
locus was determined by multicolor capillary gel separation as described in a previous study [13].

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:146

VNTR analysis
Each locus for an S. Enteritidis isolate was assigned an
allele score based on the fragment size. The allele scores
were converted into repeats numbers of the nine loci and
entered into BioNumerics software (Applied-Maths, StMartens-Latem, Belgium) as character data for cluster
analysis. Minimum-spanning tree and dendrogram were
generated using the categorical coefficient of the software
(version 4.61) as shown in Figure 1 and 2. This categorical
parameter implies that the same weight is given to any
multistate character at each locus, whatever the repeat
number is. Hypothetical types (missing links) were introduced as branches of the MST, causing the total spanning
of the tree to decrease significantly. In case of equivalent
solutions in terms of calculated distance, the highest
number of single locus variants was used as the priority
rule for linking types in the tree as previously described
[13].
DNA sequencing
To verify the results from the Multi-Locus variable
Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) of S. Enteritidis, the copy number variation of tandem repeats for distinct alleles at all nine VNTR loci were analyzed. At least
two different S. Enteritidis strains representing the same
allele at each of nine VNTR loci were selected from different clusters of MLVA for sequencing. Sequence alignments
were created using SeqMan (DNASTAR, Madison, WI)
and the numbers of tandem repeats sequence for each
locus were measured using Tandem Repeats Finder software (accessible at http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html)
[26]. The copy numbers were rounded to the nearest integer (For example, 7.5 is rounded up to 8.0) and entered
into the VNTR profiles.
Genetic diversity
Nei's diversity index (D) was calculated for the measurement of genetic (allelic) diversity at each VNTR locus as 1
- Σ(allele frequency)2. The diversity indices were classified
into four source-based groups: humans, chickens, eggs,
and others (isolates from environment and other animals) to see if source-specific VNTR loci exist.

Simpson's index of diversity and its confidence interval
were calculated to measure genotype diversity among isolates from different sources and the discriminatory power
between MLVA subtyping and phage typing as previously
stated [13].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses for comparisons were performed
using PC SAS system for Windows version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test
were performed to test for an association of dichotomous
tabular data using PROC FREQ procedure while t-test was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/146

performed to compare the difference in the means of the
polymorphic loci from groups of isolates using PROC
TTEST. Comparisons with p-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
