Abstract
Background: A theoretical model of genetic redundancy has proposed that the fates of redundant
genes depend on the degree of functional redundancy, and that functionally redundant genes will
not be inherited together. However, no example of actual gene evolution has been reported that
can be used to test this model. Here, we analyzed the molecular evolution of the ribonuclease H
(RNase H) family in prokaryotes and used the results to examine the implications of functional
redundancy for gene evolution.
Results: In prokaryotes, RNase H has been classified into RNase HI, HII, and HIII on the basis of
amino acid sequences. Using 353 prokaryotic genomes, we identified the genes encoding the RNase
H group and examined combinations of these genes in individual genomes. We found that the
RNase H group may have evolved in such a way that the RNase HI and HIII genes will not coexist
within a single genome – in other words, these genes are inherited in a mutually exclusive manner.
Avoiding the simultaneous inheritance of the RNase HI and HIII genes is remarkable when RNase
HI contains an additional non-RNase H domain, double-stranded RNA, and an RNA-DNA hybridbinding domain, which is often observed in eukaryotic RNase H1. This evolutionary process may
have resulted from functional redundancy of these genes, because the substrate preferences of
RNase HI and RNase HIII are similar.
Conclusion: We provide two possible evolutionary models for RNase H genes in which functional
redundancy contributes to the exclusion of redundant genes from the genome of a species. This is
the first empirical study to show the effect of functional redundancy on changes in gene constitution
during the course of evolution.

Background
The science of molecular evolution has paved the way for
understanding evolutionary processes in which genetic
redundancy (the presence of two or more genes capable of
serving the same functional role in an organism) is a
major source of genetic novelty and robustness. In fact, a
recent analysis of 106 bacterial genomes revealed that a

significant number of genetic redundancies have persisted
in individual genomes [1], and systematic gene deletion
experiments have demonstrated that approximately 300
out of 4000 genes are indispensable for two bacterial species, Escherichia coli [2] and Bacillus subtilis [3], suggesting
the presence of considerable redundancy in the bacterial
genome. However, these findings also raise the question

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:128

of how genetic redundancy is maintained within a
genome, because functionally redundant genes are likely
to be eliminated by selective pressure as shown in a largescale analysis of protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the redundant interactions due
to duplicated genes generally are not persisted long after
gene duplication [4]. In order to explain the process, a theoretical model has been developed to provide insight into
the retention of redundant genes, which is hypothesized
to depend on their degree of functional redundancy [5],
there have been no empirical studies of gene evolution to
support this theoretical model directly. The study
described here aimed to substantiate the model of evolution of genetic redundancy on the basis of the analysis of
a ribonuclease family that has contributed to our understanding of some aspects of molecular evolution, such as
adaptive evolution [6,7], positive Darwinian selection [8],
and the origin of retroviruses with long terminal repeats
(LTR) [9].
Ribonuclease H (RNase H; EC 3.1.26.4), one member of
the ribonuclease family, is an enzyme that specifically
degrades the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA hybrids [10].
Because various studies have revealed the presence of
RNase H in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and retroviruses, this
compound is considered to be one of the most widely
conserved enzymes [11]. Although the physiological functions of RNase H are not fully understood, this enzyme is
thought to play several roles in DNA replication [12-14],
DNA repair [15,16], and RNA transcription [17,18]. In
terms of its medical importance, RNase H activity in retroviruses (including HIV-1) is necessary for their replication, and the enzyme has thus been regarded as one of the
drug targets for AIDS chemotherapy [19]. This enzyme is
also suggested to be related to the antiviral immune
response in humans, because mutations of the RNase Hencoding gene have been found in individuals affected by
a human neurological disease, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome [20]. Therefore, the accumulation of experimental
data on the secondary structures and enzymatic features of
RNase H from many studies of its biological significance
has provided us with an opportunity to use this knowledge in the field of molecular evolution.
Unlike retroviruses, which possess a single RNase H gene,
most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. According to the nomenclature for
these enzymes, prokaryotic RNase H is generally classified
into three groups: RNase HI, HII, and HIII. Eukaryotic
RNase H is divided into RNase H1 and H2 [21]. Phylogenetic analyses using RNase H sequences have proposed
the following classification: Type 1 (prokaryotic RNase
HI, eukaryotic RNase H1, and viral RNase H) and Type 2
(prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase
H2), and it is important to note that no prokaryotic spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/128

cies with a combination of RNase HI and HIII genes has
yet been identified [11]. Additionally, in contrast to
eukaryotes, which tend to contain both RNase H1 and H2
genes, the combination of RNase H genes in prokaryotes
varies among species, and the overall nature of this variation is poorly understood. Therefore, further study is
required to clarify the presence or absence of RNase H
genes in these species.
We conducted a comparative analysis of the complete
genomes of 353 prokaryotes (326 bacteria and 27
archaea) and examined the combination of RNase H
genes and the potential evolutionary processes that could
explain the effects of functional redundancy on gene evolution, as described by a theoretical model of genetic
redundancy [5]. Our findings suggest that the RNase HI
and HIII genes have evolved in a mutually exclusive manner owing to their functional similarities. This molecular
evolution of RNase H genes is the first actual example of
how the degree of functional redundancy has implications for changes in gene constitution during the course of
evolution.

Results
Genome-wide identification of RNase H genes
To identify RNase HI, HII, and HIII coding sequences in a
genome, two strategies (a remote homology search and a
protein domain search) were applied to ensure maximum
coverage of the genes (See Methods). Using the complete
genomes for 326 strains from 235 bacterial species and 27
strains from 27 archaeal species, we retrieved 342 RNase
HI genes, 333 RNase HII genes, and 76 RNase HIII genes
(see Additional file 1). Almost all genomes contained one
or more RNase H genes, and there was little difference in
the types and numbers of RNase H genes among several
strains of a given species, with the exception of Buchnera
aphidicola and Xanthomonas campestris. The RNase HIrelated gene of B. aphidicola str. APS (Acyrthosiphon pisum)
contained a frameshift mutation that resulted in a loss of
RNase H activity (Dr. Naoto Ohtani, Keio University, personal communication), whereas non-frameshifted RNase
HI genes were identified in B. aphidicola str. Bp (Baizongia
pistaciae) and B. aphidicola str. Sg (Schizaphis graminum). A
frameshift mutation was also found in the RNase HIIrelated gene of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria str.
85-10. In contrast, other strains of X. campestris pv. campestris (str. 8004 and str. ATCC 33913) had a nonframeshifted RNase HII. Therefore, we assumed that B.
aphidicola had an RNase HI gene and X. campestris had an
RNase HII gene at the species level. Accordingly, we
counted the number of RNase H genes in the 27 archaeal
and 235 bacterial species listed in Table 1. The RNase HI
gene was present in 33% (9/27) of the archaeal species
and 89% (210/235) of the bacterial species, the RNase HII
gene was present in all archaeal species and in 94% (220/

235) of the bacterial species, and the RNase HIII gene was
identified in 4% (1/27) of the archaeal species and in 17%
(40/235) of the bacterial species. This result is consistent
with a previous report that RNase HII is the more universal gene in prokaryotes [11]. Most species had a single
copy of a given gene, but multiple genes encoding RNase
HI were found in 11% (3/27) of the archaeal species and
16% (37/235) of the bacterial species.
Alteration of RNase H combinations in closely related
species
Contrary to the situation in eukaryotes, in which both
RNase H1 and RNase H2 tend to coexist, various combinations of RNase H genes have been found in prokaryotes
[11]. To compare the presence and absence of RNase H
genes among prokaryotes, we examined the combinations
of RNase H genes in individual genomes. Three types of
RNase H genes can theoretically produce eight combinations of genes, as shown in the Venn diagram in Figure 1.
Because, in practice, we found no species that lacked all
three genes (Group H), all species were classified on the
basis of the remaining seven RNase H combinations
(Table 2). No prokaryotic genome contained the combination of only RNase HI and HIII (Group D); this supports the results of a previous study [11] at the genomewide level. Although many archaeal species contained
only the RNase HII gene (Group F) or a combination of
RNase HI and HII genes (Group B) – a finding in agreement with previous reports [22,23] – one of the euryarchaeota, Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSM 3091,
combined RNase HII with RNase HIII (Group C) instead.
On the other hand, 189 of the 235 bacterial species (80%)
had combinations of the RNase HI and HII genes (Group
B) and 16 of the 235 species (7%) had combinations of
the RNase HII and HIII genes (Group C). At the same
time, the RNase H combinations in bacteria exhibited
more variety than those in the archaea and seemed to differ even among related species, especially in the firmicutes. Interestingly, species that had all three RNase H
genes (Group A) were limited to the firmicutes.

bacterial species.

Figure 1
Potential combinations of the three RNase H genes
Potential combinations of the three RNase H genes.
The Venn diagram consists of three circles (HI, RNase HI;
HII, RNase HII; HIII, RNase HIII) that represent the possible
combinations of RNase H genes as Groups A to H. The 353
prokaryotic genomes were classified according to this system, and the results are presented in Additional File 1. The
numbers under Groups A to H indicate the number of
archaeal (left) and bacterial (right) species identified in each
of the groups.

To elucidate the relationship between RNase HI and HIII,
the evolutionary genomic constitution of the RNase H
genes was examined in 49 species of firmicutes, because
RNase HIII is especially common in this group (classes A,
C, D, and G in Table 2). First, we constructed a Bayesian
tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the DNA gyrase
subunit B (gyrB) genes of the firmicutes, which have been
used to infer phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotes [24], and displayed the RNase H combinations of each
species (Figure 2). The results of our phylogenetic analysis
indicate that RNase H combinations differed even among
closely related species. For example, the species in the
mollicutes were classified into Groups B (RNase HI and
HII), C (RNase HII and HIII), and G (only RNase HIII),
showing that the RNase HIII gene is not found in the mollicutes that retain the RNase HI gene. In addition, species
with all three RNase H genes (Group A) were found only
in the bacillales and lactobacillales, because this combination is not found in species other than firmicutes (see
Table 2).

More noteworthy is the fact that the RNase HI genes of the
species that also have RNase HII genes (Group B) often
encode additional conserved protein domains, as represented by the presence of Group B' in Figure 2. This nonRNase H domain was first identified in the N-terminal
portion of eukaryotic RNase H1 [25] and was designated
as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and an RNA-DNA
hybrid-binding domain (dsRHbd) because of its ability to
bind to dsRNA as well as RNA-DNA hybrids [26-28]. In

All species were classified on the basis of the RNase H combinations shown in the Venn diagram in Figure 1.

prokaryotes, it has been reported that RNases HI of Bacillus halodurans [29] and of Shewanella sp. SIB1 [30] that
have dsRHbd in the N-terminus possess RNase H activity.
In contrast, no such domain was identified in RNase HI of
the species that had all three types of RNase H (Group A).
Interestingly, RNase HI of B. subtilis [REFSEQ:
NP_390082], a member of Group A, exhibited neither
RNase H activity nor other nuclease activity, even though
RNase HII and HIII possess RNase H activity [22,31]. This
may indicate a difference of RNase H activity between
RNase HI without dsRHbd (Group A) and RNase HI with
dsRHbd (Group B').
To identify differences in the primary and secondary structures between RNase HI without dsRHbd (Group A) and
RNase HI with dsRHbd (Group B'), multiple alignments
were performed using the amino acid sequences of each
RNase HI domain in the bacillales and lactobacillales and
the E. coli RNase HI domain. If the species had multiple
RNase HI genes, one gene that was more similar to E. coli
RNase HI than to any other gene was selected; these are
described in Additional file 2. As a result, the RNase HI
sequences were divided into three groups (Figure 3). The
amino acid sequences of RNase HI in Group A were simi-

lar to that of B. subtilis RNase HI, which exhibited no
nuclease activity. In contrast, the primary structures of
RNase HI with dsRHbd formed two groups: Group B'1, in
which the primary structures of lactobacillales RNase HI
were similar to that of E. coli RNase HI, whose nuclease
activity has been demonstrated [32], and Group B'2, in
which B. halodurans and B. clausii RNase HI had little similarity to other RNase HI but showed RNase H activity
[29]. There is also a marked difference in the secondary
structure. RNase HI in Group A lacked the basic protrusion handle (alpha-helix 3) involved in substrate binding
of E. coli RNase HI [33,34]. On the other hand, all of the
lactobacillales RNase HI with dsRHbd in Group B'1 had
the basic protrusion handle. Although the basic protrusion handle is not observed in B. halodurans and B. clausii
(Group B'2), it has been proposed that dsRHbd could
functionally compensate for this basic protrusion [29].
From the relationship between structural similarity and
RNase H activity, it can be inferred that RNase HI with
dsRHbd in Group B' exhibits RNase H activity but it is
unclear whether RNase HI in Group A exhibits RNase H
activity or not, because the archaeal RNase HI of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [22] and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 [23] exhibited weak RNase H activity despite the absence of the basic

protrusion handle. However, the fact that a double knockout of RNase HII and HIII genes in B. subtilis yields a lethal
phenotype [31] indicates that Group A RNase HI genes
encoded in the B. subtilis genome do not have the ability
to compensate for functions of RNase HII and HIII. Therefore, our results (that RNase HIII is not present in Group
B but is present in Group A) suggest that there is some sort
of relationship between protein functions and gene constitutions.
Phylogenetic distribution of dsRHbd sequences
Our results (Table 2) clearly showed that the combination
of RNase HI and HIII genes (Group D) was not found in
the prokaryotes and that most bacterial species had combinations of RNase HI and HII (Group B) or RNase HII
and HIII (Group C). Moreover, the combination of RNase
H genes has been altered even among closely related species in such a way that functional RNase HI and HIII genes
do not coexist in a single genome; in other words, our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/128

results provide evidence that RNase HI and HIII tend to
evolve in a mutually exclusive manner. Avoiding the
simultaneous inheritance of the RNase HI and HIII genes
is remarkable when RNase HI contains dsRHbd in the firmicutes, because dsRHbd sequences were found in 15 out
of 18 species that combined the RNase HI and HII genes
(Group B) and were not found in any of the 15 species
that had all three RNase H genes (group A) (see Figure 2).
Therefore, dsRHbd appears to be a key domain in the evolutionary process that has led to the current distribution of
RNase H genes. Although the characteristics of dsRHbd,
such as its enzymatic features [25,27] and its secondary
structure, have been compared with those of eukaryotic
RNase HI [35], little is known about the number and
types of dsRHbd in prokaryotes. Therefore, we searched
for dsRHbd sequences in the complete genomes of 326
strains from 235 bacterial species and 27 strains from 27
archaeal species in the same way that we searched for the
RNase H sequences (See Methods).
The results revealed that the genomes of 30 bacterial species (one of which had two strains) and 1 archaeal species
encoded dsRHbd (Table 3), and that the distribution pattern of dsRHbd in prokaryotes did not appear to be correlated with the phylogenetic pattern. Most dsRHbds are
fused with the RNase HI domain, but Lactobacillus delbrueckii has two genes encoding dsRHbd; one is associated
with the RNase HI domain and the other is associated
with the resolvase domain. In addition, it is interesting
that the dsRHbds of Gloeobacter violaceus, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, and Myxococcus xanthus were identified in the Cterminus of RNase HI even though many dsRHbds were in
the N-terminus, as in the eukaryotes. Multiple alignments
of the amino acid sequences of prokaryotic dsRHbds
showed that the sequences of dsRHbd located in the C-terminus were similar (Figure 4). The process of dsRHbd
acquisition can be inferred from the fact that almost half
of the RNase HI with dsRHbd was found in firmicutes that
have the abilities to acquire new genes through lateral
gene transfer [36]. In addition, RNase HIII genes were not
found in any genomes of the 31 species that encoded
RNase HI with dsRHbd (Additional file 3), supporting the
hypothesis of mutually exclusive evolution of RNase HI
and HIII.
Redundant RNase HI genes in a single genome
We also found that 10 of the 31 species listed in Table 3
had multiple RNase HI genes (see Additional file 3). If
RNase HI with a dsRHbd gene influences the existence of
the RNase HIII gene in a genome, how is the effect exerted
on other RNase HI genes? To address this question, we
examined the amino acid sequences of RNase HI without
dsRHbd in these 10 species. The RNase HI without
dsRHbd that were found in five species in the firmicutes
and one species in the deltaproteobacteria, with the excep-

Amino acid sequence alignments for the RNase HI domains
Amino acid sequence alignments for the RNase HI domains. RNase HI protein sequences were derived from the
bacillales and lactobacillales listed in Additional File 2 and were aligned by using the Clustal method. Arrows and rectangles
indicate beta-strands and alpha-helices, respectively. The upper and lower secondary structures were generated on the basis of
the RNase HI domains of E. coli [33] and B. halodurans [29]. Dark and light shadings indicate highly conserved and similar amino
acid residues, respectively. Asterisks denote amino acid residues that are involved in the catalytic function of RNase HI. The
boxed region below the label for alpha-helix 3 forms a basic protrusion handle in the E. coli RNase HI structure. The combinations of RNase H genes are represented to the right of the sequences (see the text for details). The symbols † and § indicate
active and inactive RNase H, respectively.

Amino acid sequence alignments of dsRHbds from prokaryoAmino acid sequence alignments of dsRHbds from
prokaryotes. Arrows and rectangles indicate beta-strands
and alpha-helices, respectively. These secondary structures
were generated on the basis of the N-terminus domain of S.
cerevisiae RNase H1 [35]. Arrows and rectangles indicate
beta-strands and alpha-helices, respectively. Dark and light

tion of B. bacteriovorus, were similar in structure (e.g.,
lacked the basic protrusion) to that of the Group A RNase
HI (see Figure 3). On the other hand, the primary structures of RNase HI without dsRHbd in three species of
gammaproteobacteria resembled that of E. coli, and there
were few differences in their amino acid sequences.
Because the primary structures of RNase HI with dsRHbd
in the same species in the gammaproteobacteria were also
similar to that of E. coli, it is difficult to distinguish redundant RNase HI genes on the basis of their amino acid similarities.
To identify the differences among redundant RNase HI
sequences of the gammaproteobacteria (see Additional
file 4), we constructed a Bayesian tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the RNase HI domains from 12 species
in the gammaproteobacteria (Figure 5). This analysis
divided the RNase HI domains into four gene clusters:
orthologous RNase HI, including E. coli RNase HI (Group
I); RNase HI with dsRHbd (Group II); and other two
groups of additional RNase HI (Groups III and IV).
Because RNase HI genes in Group I appear to have been
inherited by vertical descent from a common ancestor, we
defined them as orthologous RNase HI genes. On the
other hand, RNase HI genes of Group II to IV seem to have
been provided by gene duplication or lateral gene transfer

in addition to the original RNase HI genes. Interestingly,
orthologous RNase HI was not found in Saccharophagus
degradans that contains RNase HI with dsRHbd (Group
II). In contrast, Pseudoalteromonas atlantica contains
orthologous RNase HI (Group I) instead of RNase HI with
dsRHbd, though the presence of Group III RNase HI is
common to S. degradans and P. atlantica. In addition,
orthologous RNase HI was not found in the genome of
Colwellia psychrerythraea, which contains only RNase HI
with a dsRHbd gene (Group II). The same statement
applies to 21 other prokaryotic species that have only
RNase HI with dsRHbd (see Additional file 3). On the
other hand, we also found that orthologous RNase HI
(Group I) and RNase HI with dsRHbd (Group II) had
both been retained in two genomes of Photobacterium profundum and Shewanella denitrificans. These results suggest
that RNase HI with dsRHbd may be capable of replacing
the original RNase HI. A lineage-specific characterization
such as the mapping of gene trees onto species trees using
a soft parsimony algorithm [37] is necessary for more precise analysis of the transition of RNase HI genes during
the course of evolution.

Discussion
Using genome-wide and phylogenetic analyses of RNase
H genes, we obtained the following findings: (1) most
bacterial species had combinations of RNase HI and HII
(80%, 189 out of 235 species) or RNase HII and HIII (7%,
16 out of 235 species); (2) the combination of RNase HI
and HIII genes was not found in any species (0% in Group
D) unless RNase HII was also present (Group A; 15 species
in the firmicutes); (3) the combination of RNase H genes
has been altered, even in closely related species, in such a
way that the functional RNase HI and HIII genes do not
coexist in a single genome; (4) dsRHbd was found in
RNase HI in 31 out of 189 species (16%) that contain the
RNase HI and HII genes; (5) dsRHbd was not found in the
RNase HI in all 15 species that contained all three types of
RNase H genes; and (6) RNase HI with dsRHbd may have
replaced the orthologous RNase HI without dsRHbd in 21
out of 31 species (68%) that have RNase HI with dsRHbd.
To ascertain the cause of the mutually exclusive evolution
of RNase HI and RNase HIII, we focused on their enzymatic properties. Previous reports have indicated that
RNase HI and HIII digest the RNA moiety of RNA-DNA
hybrids such as Okazaki fragments more effectively than
is the case for RNase HII [38], whereas only RNase HII is
capable of removing a single ribonucleotide of DNARNA-DNA/DNA hybrids such as an RNA that has been
misincorporated into DNA [15,16]. In addition, mutagenesis analyses of B. subtilis RNase H genes have shown that
single-gene knockout mutants targeting the RNase HII or
HIII genes exhibit normal growth, but that double-knockout mutants for both genes are unable to form viable col-

they are equally effective at performing their functions
(Model 1). On the other hand, redundant genes are evolutionarily stable in two situations: when both genes perform the same function but one is less efficient than the
other gene (Model 2), and when the main functions of the
two genes differ but one of the genes functions similarly
to the other gene, but with lower efficiency (Model 3). The
insights from this simulation can be applied to the molecular evolution of RNase H genes in prokaryotes. At first
glance, the reason why most bacterial species have combinations of RNase HI with RNase HII or RNase HII with
RNase HIII can be explained by Model 3; that is, these
combinations are evolutionarily stable because both
genes in each combination have independent functions
but with an unknown degree of functional overlap. Likewise, the combination of RNase HI and HIII genes is evolutionarily unstable owing to their functional redundancy
(Model 1), and this may explain why no species has both
functional genes in its genome and why the combination
of RNase H genes has been altered even in closely related
species in such a way that RNase HI and HIII genes will
not coexist in a single genome.

Bayesian phylogenetic tree for the RNase HI
domains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by using
Bayesian inference on the basis of the alignments of RNase
HI domain sequences from 12 species in the gammaproteobacteria, as listed in Additional File 4. Species names followed
by Arabic numerals are used to distinguish multiple forms of
RNase HI in a genome; names not followed by Arabic numerals indicate the presence of a single RNase HI in a genome.

onies; this suggests that a functional overlap exists
between RNase HII and HIII [31]. On the other hand, the
existence of functional redundancy between RNase HI
and HII is not clear, although double-knockout mutants
of E. coli RNase HI and HII exhibit a temperature-sensitive
phenotype (Dr. Mitsuhiro Itaya, Keio University, personal
communication). We hypothesize that the functional
similarities and differences among the three RNase H
genes may explain this evolutionary process, because a
theoretical model of genetic redundancy suggests that the
fates of redundant genes are likely to depend on the extent
of their functional redundancy [5].
According to computer simulations using a genetic redundancy model [5], redundant genes do not persist when

It seems that the effect of functional redundancy is more
severe for RNase HI with dsRHbd in firmicutes, because
RNase HIII was found in all 15 species whose genomes
encode RNase HI without dsRHbd but was not found in
any of the 31 species containing RNase HI with dsRHbd.
Given the distribution pattern of RNase HI with dsRHbd
in prokaryotes, we proposed the following process: once
RNase HI with dsRHbd is acquired (for example, by lateral gene transfer [39]), the combination of RNase HI with
dsRHbd and RNase HIII may become evolutionarily
unstable owing to their functional redundancy, and one
of them is subsequently removed during the course of
evolution. We propose this evolutionary process as Model
A in Figure 6A. In particular, it is interesting that the RNase
H combinations of two species that are regarded as the
deepest branching organisms are different: Thermotoga
maritima has a combination of RNase HI with dsRHbd
and RNase HII, whereas Aquifex aeolicus retains a combination of RNase HII and HIII [31]. This may reflect the
ancient status of these RNase H combinations in bacteria,
and RNase HIII might have been altered along with RNase
HI with dsRHbd in T. maritima in accordance with our
model. Also, the fact that RNase HIII genes are less abundant than those of RNase HI and HII (Table 1) suggests
the possibility that RNase HIII genes have been replaced
in genomes by other RNase H genes during the course of
evolution.
A similar scenario might have occurred in the case of
redundant RNase HI genes, because our findings also suggest that RNase HI with dsRHbd may have replaced the
existing RNase HI without dsRHbd in 21 species. As

work, more detailed analysis of eukaryotic RNase H1
genes is required to show the effect of functional redundancy on the evolution of redundant genes in eukaryotes.

Figure evolutionary models for the three RNase H genes

Possible evolutionary models for the three RNase H
genes. Two models that can explain the mutually exclusive
evolution of RNase HIII and RNase HI with dsRHbd (Model
A) and of RNase HI with and without dsRHbd (Model B). Fa

shown in Model B (Figure 6B), once RNase HI with
dsRHbd is obtained, it competes with RNase HI without
dsRHbd because of their functional redundancy, and one
of them is excluded. It is also noteworthy that RNase HI
with dsRHbd is encoded as a single-copy gene in prokaryotic genomes (Table 3). Interestingly, human genome
contains one RNase H1 with dsRHbd and at least three
pseudogenes related to RNase H1 with dsRHbd [40].
Although we previously showed that four RNase H1encoding genes in Caenorhabditis elegans exhibited genespecific expression patterns during development; one
gene encodes RNase H1 with dsRHbd and other three
gene encode RNase H1 without dsRHbd [41], it was also
found that most of the eukaryotic genomes contained single-copy genes encoding RNase H1 with dsRHbd but
RNase H1 without dsRHbd had rarely been identified in
the same genome (data not shown). Functional characteristic of RNase H1 with dsRHbd seems to depend on
eukaryotic species because disruptions of RNase H1 with
dsRHbd resulted in lethal phenotype of fly [42] and mice
[13] but showed normal growth in yeast [43] and
trypanosoma [44]. However, it appears that prokaryotic
and eukaryotic genomes have single-copy RNase H1 with

We also discovered that several RNase HI genes could exist
in a single genome (Table 1) and that there are some cases
in which orthologous RNase HI is retained in the presence
of RNase HI with dsRHbd (Figure 5). This raises the question of how multiple RNase HI genes can be retained in a
single genome. This is difficult to explain using the genetic
evolution models described in Figure 6, because multiple
RNase HI genes should also have the same function and
should be subject to the same mechanisms that govern the
fate of redundant genes. In the case of duplicated genes,
the usual fate of redundant genes is that one is silenced
through a strong purifying selection after a brief period of
relaxed selection [45]. The number of RNase HI genes differed among species even within the same lineages, suggesting that gene duplication or gene transfer might have
occurred relatively recently and that redundant genes may
have arisen during a period of relaxed selection. An alternative possible explanation for multiple RNase HI is that
neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization have been
shown by computer simulation to increase the retention
rate of duplicated genes [46,47]. Although it is not known
whether the retention of multiple RNase HI genes resulted
from subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization,
RNase HI appears to represent the acquisition of a new
function based on the example of Streptomyces coelicolor
A3(2), which encodes a bifunctional enzyme consisting of
an RNase H domain and an acid phosphatase domain
[48]. In addition to subfunctionalization, it is also possible that some of the RNase HI genes identified in this
study might be in the process of nonfunctionalization
(pseudogenization) and can be expected to become pseudogenes [49]. Actually, genomic sequences encoding truncated RNase HI domains have been found in some species
during genome-wide identification of RNase H genes
(data not shown), suggesting the existence of one or more
nonfunctionalized RNase HI gene in our dataset. Moreover, even if the coding sequences seem not to have been
nonfunctionalized, the regulatory regions might have
mutations because duplicated genes are considered to be
under active selection pressure owing to energy constraints on gene expression [50]. Further investigations
will be necessary to reveal the effect of each functionalization on multiple RNase HI genes in prokaryotes.
In this study, two possible models were provided to
explain the evolution of RNase H combinations in
prokaryotic genomes. We believe that our models are the
first example of the effects of functional redundancy on
changes in gene constitution during the course of gene

evolution. Experimental evolution of bacterial species
constructed to have mutually exclusive genes by means of
genetic engineering may be effective in verification of our
models. For example, RNase HI and RNase HIII genes
tagged with different drug resistances are inserted into the
RNase HI-knockout mutants of E. coli and repeated subcultures of the recombinants allow us to detect the
mutated RNase H gene using specific drug resistances as
markers. This experimental approach would certainly be
worthwhile to explore the fate of redundant RNase H
genes in future research.

Conclusion
We identified three genes that encode RNase H enzymes
and examined the combinations of these genes in 353
prokaryotic genomes. Our results showed that RNase H
combinations might have evolved in such a way that the
RNase HI and HIII genes will not be inherited together
within an individual genome and that this tendency is
prominent when RNase HI contains dsRHbd. This mutually exclusive evolution of RNase H genes seems to be
related to functional redundancy, because previous
reports have suggested that the substrate preferences of
RNase HI and HIII are similar. Taken together, these
results suggest possible evolutionary models for the
RNase H genes in which functional redundancy contributes to the exclusion of redundant genes. Our findings
thus provide a good example of the effects of functional
redundancy on gene evolution, confirming certain theoretical predictions.

Methods
Genome-wide identification of genes encoding RNase H
and dsRHbd
Complete genomes of 326 strains from 235 bacterial species and 27 strains from 27 archaeal species and the corresponding GenBank files were downloaded from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
GenBank FTP site [51]; their accession numbers are summarized in Additional file 1. Two strategies were applied
to identify sequences of RNase H and double-stranded
RNA and RNA-DNA hybrid-binding domains (dsRHbd)
in the complete genomes. One was a remote homology
search with the PSI-BLAST software [52] and the other was
a protein domain search based on Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) profiles [53].

For the PSI-BLAST search, a non-redundant peptide
sequence database was downloaded from the NCBI
BLAST FTP site [54]. From this database, peptide
sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes were extracted
by using taxonomy information obtained from the NCBI
Taxonomy FTP site [55]. To construct a position-specific
scoring matrix, a PGP-BLAST search was carried out
against 3 506 454 extracted peptide sequences, with an E-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/128

value threshold of 0.002 and four iterations. The amino
acid and nucleotide sequences corresponding to the
RNase HI domain of E. coli K12 [GenBank: AAC73319],
the RNase HII domain of E. coli K12 [GenBank:
AAC73294], the RNase HIII domain of B. subtilis subsp.
subtilis str. 168 [Swissprot: P94541], and the dsRHbd of
B. halodurans C-125 [Swissprot: Q9KEI9] were used as
queries. Using the resulting matrix, PSI-TBLASTN searches
were conducted against the 353 complete genomes by
using an E-value threshold of 0.2.
For the HMM profile analysis, the profiles of RNase HI
and RNase HII were downloaded from the Sanger Institute's Pfam Web site [56] and the HMM profile of dsRHbd
was newly built by using the hmmbuild module of the
HMMER 2.3.2 software [53] on the basis of the results of
the PSI-BLAST search. The 353 complete genomes were
translated into six-frame amino acid sequences. Using
these HMM profiles as queries, protein domain searches
were performed with the hmmpfam module of the
HMMER 2.3.2 software against translated complete
genomes with an E-value threshold of 1× 10-6.
On the basis of the outputs of the PSI-BLAST and HMM
searches, coding sequences including homologous
regions of RNase H or dsRHbd were obtained from GenBank files by using G-language Perl modules [57]. When
the search revealed unannotated genomic regions, we
manually checked for the existence of an open reading
frame (ORF) near the genomic region. In order to distinguish genes encoding RNase HII and RNase HIII in the
datasets, a PGPBLAST search was conducted against the
Conserved Domain Database (a subset of domains from
SMART, Pfam, COG, and CD) [58] downloaded from the
NCBI CDD FTP site [59].
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the DNA
gyrase subunit B gene (gyrB) were retrieved in a similar
way. The CodonAlign 2.0 software (Barry G. Hall, Rochester, NY, USA) was used to align the nucleotide sequences
on the basis of alignments of the corresponding amino
acid sequences performed with the ClustalW 1.8.3 software [60]. The Modeltest 3.7 software [61] was applied to
select an appropriate model from the output of the
PAUP* Version 4.0 software [62] by using hierarchical
likelihood-ratio tests and the Akaike Information Criterion [63]. Phylogenetic trees were estimated by Bayesian
methods with MRBAYES Version 3.1.2 software [64]
under the General Time Reversible model with gamma
correction and a proportion of invariable sites [65]. In the
Bayesian analysis, the Markov chain Monte Carlo search
used 1 000 000 generations run with four chains, with
trees being sampled every 100 generations, and a consensus tree was estimated by a burn-in of 2500 trees.
