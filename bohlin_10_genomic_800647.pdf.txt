Abstract
Background: Classification of bacteria within the genus Brucella has been difficult due in part to considerable
genomic homogeneity between the different species and biovars, in spite of clear differences in phenotypes.
Therefore, many different methods have been used to assess Brucella taxonomy. In the current work, we examine
32 sequenced genomes from genus Brucella representing the six classical species, as well as more recently
described species, using bioinformatical methods. Comparisons were made at the level of genomic DNA using
oligonucleotide based methods (Markov chain based genomic signatures, genomic codon and amino acid
frequencies based comparisons) and proteomes (all-against-all BLAST protein comparisons and pan-genomic
analyses).
Results: We found that the oligonucleotide based methods gave different results compared to that of the
proteome based methods. Differences were also found between the oligonucleotide based methods used. Whilst
the Markov chain based genomic signatures grouped the different species in genus Brucella according to host
preference, the codon and amino acid frequencies based methods reflected small differences between the Brucella
species. Only minor differences could be detected between all genera included in this study using the codon and
amino acid frequencies based methods.
Proteome comparisons were found to be in strong accordance with current Brucella taxonomy indicating a remarkable association between gene gain or loss on one hand and mutations in marker genes on the other. The proteome based methods found greater similarity between Brucella species and Ochrobactrum species than between
species within genus Agrobacterium compared to each other. In other words, proteome comparisons of species
within genus Agrobacterium were found to be more diverse than proteome comparisons between species in
genus Brucella and genus Ochrobactrum. Pan-genomic analyses indicated that uptake of DNA from outside genus
Brucella appears to be limited.
Conclusions: While both the proteome based methods and the Markov chain based genomic signatures were
able to reflect environmental diversity between the different species and strains of genus Brucella, the genomic
codon and amino acid frequencies based comparisons were not found adequate for such comparisons. The
proteome comparison based phylogenies of the species in genus Brucella showed a surprising consistency with
current Brucella taxonomy.

Background
The genus Brucella belongs to the a-Proteobacteria
order and consists of mostly intra-cellular bacteria that
are known to be pathogenic in a wide range of mammal
hosts [1]. The ailments caused by the different species
and strains from genus Brucella are known collectively
as brucellosis [1]. Brucellosis is a contagious zoonotic
disease known to affect many different mammals ranging from livestock and humans to a wide variety of
marine mammals. Each species or strain, however, has a
narrow host range [1].
The Brucella genus has traditionally been classified
into six species: B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. neotomae, B. ovis, and B. canis, which are reflective of host
preference. In 1985, it was proposed that the six Brucella species should be grouped as biovars of a single
species based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies [2].
The Brucella Taxonomic Subcommittee of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes adopted
this proposition. However, the international community
of Brucella researchers has never accepted this change
and a return to the pre-1986 taxonomy was advocated
and eventually adopted by the Brucella Taxonomic Subcommittee [3]. Genus Brucella has been further
expanded with a set of recently discovered species. Such
species include B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis that have
been isolated from cetaceans and pinnipeds [4]. B.
microti has been isolated from the common vole [5],
and B. inopinata was isolated from a breast implant
infection in an woman with clinical signs of brucellosis
[6].
The genomes sequenced from genus Brucella are also
known to be very similar in terms of both base composition and genome size [1]. All sequenced species have a
GC content of approximately 57%, and most genomes
consist of approximately 3.3 Mbp divided on two chromosomes (see Table 1). None of the sequenced members of the Brucella genus have any plasmids reported
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi].
The first Brucella species to be sequenced was B.
melitensis 16M (biovar 1) [7] followed closely by B. suis
1330 (biovar 1) [8]. As more genomes are being
sequenced, taxonomic classification of the Brucella
genus is becoming more difficult, and many different
methods have been applied [9]. The challenges involved
in taxonomical classification of Brucella spp. are largely
linked to the fact that marker genes typically used for
phylogenetic classification are either missing or too
similar to give any meaningful results [9,10]. Additionally, marker gene based methods like MLST and 16S
rRNA do not directly reflect changes in gene content
and may therefore fail to reproduce a broader view of
the differences between species, strains, and biovars

Page 2 of 16

[10,11]. SNP analysis gives a better overview of changes
happening at the genome level, but does not directly
reflect changes in gene content [10]. Hence, taxonomic
classification of Brucella spp. is a challenging task
touching on difficult taxonomic and phylogenetic issues
in prokaryotic species definition as a whole [9].
The aim of this study was to examine the strength and
weaknesses of a set of methods for phylogenetic classification based on whole genome comparisons. This was
carried out using a number of sequenced genomes from
species and strains taken from genus Brucella and the
closely related genus Agrobacterium and genus Ochrobactrum. This study was motivated by the genomic
homogeneity and the difficult phylogenetic assessment
of genus Brucella. Genomic comparisons were performed using a number of different methods that reflect
changes at both the proteome level and the base composition level.
The comparison methods reflecting DNA composition
used in this study include oligonucleotide based 0th, 1st,
and 2nd order Markov chain genomic signature models
(ZOM, FOM, SOM, respectively) [12], and codon and
amino acid frequencies analyses [13].
For the proteome based comparisons of the genomes,
the Prodigal gene finder [14] was used to predict open
reading frames (ORFs) in all genomes used in the study
(See Table 1). Whole genome BLAST comparisons were
subsequently performed between all proteomes, i.e. allagainst-all gene comparisons between all genomes
according to the guidelines given by Ussery et al. [15].
In addition, pan- and core genome analyses [16,17] were
carried out to map gene exchange in sequenced members of genus Brucella and the closely related phylogenetic genera such as Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum
[18].
Scholz and co-workers [18] have carried out a thorough 16S rRNA analysis and we refer to that article for
these results.
Of the methods described above, the Markov chain
models and codon and amino acid frequencies based
analyses best reflect base compositional differences and
whole genome mutational bias [12,19]. The oligonucleotide based methods are sensitive to mutations at the
genome level, and therefore share certain similarities
with the whole genome SNP analyses conducted by Foster et al. [10]. The BLAST comparisons and pan-genomic analyses focus on gene content comparisons and
gene exchange and may thus be considered as complementary to the oligonucleotide frequencies based methods that mirror base compositional differences. To the
best of our knowledge, recent whole genome based gene
comparisons of Brucella species, similar to the work
conducted here, have only been carried out for 5

16M (biovar 1) and B. abortus 2308 (biovar 1)) by Tsolis
et al. [20]. In the present work however, we perform
whole genome comparisons of 32 Brucella genomes
(Table 1) using a variety of different genomic methods
to obtain deeper insight into the obscure evolution of
genus Brucella. In addition to the 32 Brucella genomes,
we also include three sequenced genomes from genus
Agrobacterium, A. radiobacter K84, A. tumefaciens C58,
A. vitis S4, and two from genus Ochrobactrum, O.
anthropi ATCC 49188 and O. intermedium LMG 3301,

to examine the relative difference between these closely
related microbes [18].

Results
Markov chain analyses

The outcomes of the Markov chain model based genomic signatures analyses are shown in figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1 shows a set of cluster groups obtained using
the ZOM based heatmap. Table 1 describes these cluster
groups in more detail. The ZOM, FOM and SOM based
genomic signatures, which were used to produce the
phylogenetic trees seen in Figure 2, are based on

Figure 1 ZOM based heatmap. The ZOM Based heatmap shows all genomes compared using cluster analysis based on 0th order Markov chain
model predicted tetranucleotide frequencies. It can be seen that the sequenced species from genus Brucella are very similar in terms of
tetranucleotide usage patterns, with larger differences found in the more distantly related genera of Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum. Although
all species in genus Brucella are very similar in terms of base composition, as measured using the ZOM based method, several subgroups can be
observed. For instance, marine associated (Groups 2 and 4) and terrestrial mammal associated (Groups 1, 3 and 5) species of genus Brucella are
segregated into different groups.

comparisons using the Pearson correlation method. The
ZOM based heatmap seen in Figure 1 however, applies
hierarchical clustering directly on vectors of the relative
abundances of tetranucleotide frequencies (see the
methods section for more details on these methods). In
general, all Markov chain based models produced similar clusters, as can be seen from the color-coding in figures 1 and 2.
From Table 1 it can be seen that the ZOM based
heatmap (Figure 1) was divided into 6 groups. Groups 1
and 3 consist of Brucella species associated with terrestrial mammals, while groups 2 and 4 contain exclusively

marine mammal associated species. Figure 1 shows that
the only species in group 4, B. pinnipedialis strain 163/
99/10 isolated from a hooded seal (Cystophora cristata),
shares many of the same tetranucleotide patterns with
the species in group 2. Group 5 consists entirely of B.
abortus strains; although similar in base composition to
groups 1 and 3, group 5 appears to constitute a separate
group. Group 6 is the most diverse group in terms of
genome size, base composition, and GC content, and
consists exclusively of non-Brucella species. Figure 2
shows that the species in the defined groups described
in Table 1 were, for all Markov chain based genomic

Figure 2 Phylogenetic trees based on ZOM, FOM and SOM based genomic signatures. The ZOM, FOM and SOM based trees (panels A, B,
C, respectively) all show genomes compared using 0th, 1st and 2nd order Markov chain model based genomic signatures and clustered using
average linkage with Euclidean distance. It can be seen that there is large agreement between the different Markov chain based genomic
signatures. For all models, marine and terrestrial host based species of genus Brucella appear in distinctive groups, except for the SOM based
tree (C) where the marine mammal associated strain B. sp. F5/99 is grouped with terrestrial mammal associated species. The more distantly
related genera of Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum appear in separate groups than the species of genus Brucella for all genomic signature based
models.

signatures, found in similar cluster groups with the
exception of B. sp. F5/99 in group 2, which was isolated
from a Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)
[21]. Although both ZOM- and FOM based methods
cluster B. sp. F5/99 in the same group, the SOM
method found the bacterium more closely related to
cluster group 3.
All Markov chain based models placed B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10 in a separate group indicating relatively
large genomic base compositional differences with the
other Brucella species and strains (see Figure 1). B.
abortus 2308 (biovar 1) clustered more closely to the B.
abortus 9-941 (biovar 1) and B. abortus S19 (biovar 1)
than the B. melitensis strains, implying that the Markov
chain based models support the return to the pre-1986
taxonomy discussed above. In general, the Markov chain
based genomic signatures found all members of cluster
group 1 to be very similar in terms of base composition.
From the viewpoint of genomic signatures, this implies
that group 1 can in fact be considered as one

phylogenetically coherent group. The same might be
said for group 2. All Markov chain based models group
the species from group 2 correspondingly; with B. ceti
M490/95/1, isolated from harbour seal (Phoca vitulina),
having a somewhat larger base compositional difference
than the other genomes in the group. A notable exception is B. sp. F5/99 that was found more similar to
group 3 (rather than group 2) for the SOM based comparison method. All Markov chain based genomic signatures group the strains in cluster group 5 similarly and
the species from the genera Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum cluster separately from genus Brucella. Group
6 is thus entirely made up of species from the genera
Ochrobactrum and Agrobacterium, and contains no species from genus Brucella. In Figure 2, the species from
Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum are not found in one
coherent group as in Figure 1. However, a closer inspection of Figure 2 reveals that all non-Brucella species
clustered separately from the Brucella species. The cluster groups were found to be so different that no reliable

Bohlin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:249
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/249

conclusion could be made as to whether the species in
genus Agrobacterium or genus Ochrobactrum were
more similar to the species in genus Brucella as measured with the Markov chain based models.
The ZOM based heatmap (Figure 1) shows that there
are relatively large base compositional differences
between genus Brucella and the genera Agrobacterium
and Ochrobactrum. However, the groups resulting from
the ZOM based heatmap indicate that there are large
similarities between the groups containing species from
genus Brucella. The genomes found in cluster group 1
appear to be very similar in terms of base composition,
with only negligible differences detected between some
of the genomes. The heatmap in Figure 1 also indicates
that B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10 may have diverged
from cluster group 2. Additionally, the tetranucleotide
patterns taken from the B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10
genome resemble the other species in cluster group 2,
but are more pronounced. Cluster group 5 appears to
be similar to cluster group 3 in terms of tetranucleotide
relative abundance patterns although some subtle differences can be observed between the different species in
the group.
Codon and amino acid frequencies

The codon and amino acid frequencies based comparison methods (Figure 3 and 4) are similar to the Markov
chain based models in that they are also based on oligonucleotide frequencies data. However, genomic codon
and amino acid frequencies are more influenced by GC
content than the Markov chain model based genomic
signatures described above since no GC content or
smaller oligonucleotide normalization is performed.
From Figure 3 it can be seen that the organisms making up genus Brucella form one homogeneous group
with only minor frequency changes in a few of the
codons. No distinction is made between terrestrial- and
marine mammal associated Brucella species. The group
of species not belonging to genus Brucella consists of
more heterogeneous genomes in terms of codon frequencies. Figure 4 show the amino acid frequencies
from the translated codon frequencies taken from the
genomes of all organisms in the study. This heatmap
appears to be more diverse than the codon frequencies
based heatmap. However, the overall topology appears
to be similar to that of Figure 3, with no distinction
made between marine- and terrestrial mammal associated Brucella species. Hence, the general topology of
the amino acid frequencies based heatmap appears to
resemble the codon frequencies based heatmap. The
resulting heatmaps from the amino acid and codon frequencies based comparisons stand in contrast to the
ZOM based heatmap where a clear distinction between
marine and terrestrial mammal host associated species

Page 6 of 16

from genus Brucella can be observed. The ZOM based
heatmap appears to give a more detailed distinction
between the different organisms as compared to the
heatmaps based on both amino acid and codon frequencies. This is especially apparent in closely related species
and strains, which are hardly distinguishable from the
codon and amino acid frequencies based heatmaps.
However, the codon and amino acid frequencies based
cluster diagrams reinforce the impression obtained from
the Markov chain models that the genomes of the species in genus Brucella have a somewhat different base
composition from the species in genus Agrobacterium
and genus Ochrobactrum.
Proteome comparisons and the BLAST matrix

The BLAST matrix in Figure 5 is based on all-against-all
comparisons between the proteomes of all genomes discussed in the present work. More consistency, in terms
of current Brucella taxonomy, was found in the BLAST
matrix as compared to both the clusters based on the
Markov chain based genomic signatures and codon and
amino acid frequencies. This indicates that phylogenetic
classification of genus Brucella based on marker genes,
for instance multi locus sequence typing [22], show a
surprising similarity to the organism’s total gene content. Thus, at least for Brucella spp., there appears to be
an association between mutations in marker genes and
gene content.
The most similar species in genus Brucella in terms of
gene content (or proteomes) were found to be B. abortus 9-941 (biovar 1) and the vaccine strain B. abortus
S19 (biovar 1) (99.8%, see additional file 1). O. anthropi
ATCC 49188 was found to have a 48.3% proteome similarity with B. suis 1330 (biovar 1), and was the closest
match between a Brucella species and a non-Brucella
species. The two species from genus Ochrobactrum
shared 57% of their proteins, while the most similar proteomes between two species from genus Agrobacterium,
A. vitis S4 and A. tumefaciens C58, shared only 35% of
their genes. For the species in genus Brucella, the poorest match based on proteome comparisons was between
B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10 and B. inopinata BO1
(70%). The most dissimilar proteomes all together, were
A. radiobacter K8 and B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10
sharing only 21% of their genes. The most similar proteomes from the genera Agrobacterium and Brucella
were A. tumefaciens C58 and B. suis 1330 (biovar 1),
respectively, sharing 29% of their proteomes.
Pan-genome

Pan-genomic analysis is concerned with mapping genes
that are conserved (shell) and variable (cloud) among
closely related organisms, usually within a genus or species [17].

Figure 3 Codon frequencies based heatmap. The codon frequencies based heatmap is made from all the trinucleotide (codon) frequencies
found in all predicted genes from the genomes of all species in the genera: Brucella, Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum. It can be seen that there
are small differences among the species in genus Brucella and only slightly more variance between the species found in the other genera.

Two Brucella pan-genome trees are shown in figures 6
and 7. One emphasizing the shared shell genes (Figure
6) and the other the less conserved cloud genes (Figure
7). The shell genes are frequently observed in the pangenome, and differences in shell-gene content most
likely reflect an evolution over a longer time span [17].
The slow divergences of orthologs have for some strains
led to the complete loss of gene families. This is manifested as the bigger differences in the shell-weighted
pan-genome tree. The shell tree also shows that three

strains: B. sp. BO2, B. inopinata BO1 and B. sp. 83/13
differ significantly from the others. Additionally, both
trees show a remarkable difference in gene content
between B. pinnipedalis M163/99/10 and the other
strains of the same species. The B. suis 513 (biovar 5)
appears to be separated from the other B. suis strains,
which may be indicative of a substantial difference in
gene content. However, bootstrap support is low for
most branches, which implies that the detected difference in gene content is negligible.

Figure 4 Amino acid cluster diagram. The amino acid frequencies based cluster diagram is made from the amino acid usage found in the
predicted genes of the genomes in question. Amino acid frequencies correlate strongly with codon usage frequencies, but at a lower
resolution. It can be seen that only small differences can be detected between species in genus Brucella.

The cloud weighted tree (Figure 7), which is based
on promiscuous genes, shows the same overall trend
that is observed for the shell tree discussed above,
even though the distances between genomes have
changed. The cloud genes occur rarely and may be
enriched with mobile elements such as inverted
repeats, insertion sequences, and transposons making
them difficult to isolate as distinctive genes. The fact
that the cloud tree and the shell tree show the same
topology can be seen as an indication that gene uptake

from more distantly related organisms is rare in genus
Brucella.
The pan-genomic analyses conducted here (figures 6, 7
and 8) reveal that there appears to be little genetic
exchange within the sequenced species from genus Brucella. Compared to other bacteria, the present analyses of
Brucella spp. uncovers greater homogeneity in terms of
shared gene content than other species, such as Streptococcus spp. [16], E. coli spp.[23] and Burkholderia spp.
[15]. In line with the BLAST matrix, the shell and cloud

trees (figures 6 and 7, respectively) showed a remarkable
consistency to current Brucella taxonomy. Only minor
rearrangements were detected between the shell and cloud
trees, with the departing of B. sp. F5/99 from the group of
marine mammal associated species as the most notable
exception. This may indicate that the sequenced genomes
from genus Brucella are strongly conserved since differences in the potentially mobile genes described by the
cloud tree are in accordance with the shell tree consisting
of more conserved genes shared by all members in genus
Brucella. Although DNA uptake from the environment

and distantly related organisms occur in genus Brucella
[24,25], it may be relatively rare otherwise it is expected
that larger rearrangements would have been observed in
the cloud tree [23].

Discussion
Markov chain based genomic signatures

The oligonucleotide frequencies based models discussed
in the present work are not affected by genomic rearrangements since estimations are based on oligonucleotide frequencies from all DNA sequences available.

Figure 6 Pan-genomic shell tree. The Figure shows a pan-genomic tree based on a weighting strategy emphasizing ‘shell’ genes. The red
numbers are bootstrap-values, in percentage, based on 100 bootstrap samples.

Differences between organisms, as measured using the
oligonucleotide frequencies based methods, are therefore
due to changes in base composition at the genome level
caused first and foremost by mutational bias and to a
lesser degree by possible horizontal transfer or DNA
uptake [12]. Since the Markov chain based genomic signatures are normalized with respect to GC content and
smaller oligonucleotides, they reflect a stronger degree
of ‘inertia’ than the amino acid and codon frequencies
based methods.
Our results, obtained using the Markov chain based
genomic signatures, differ from the taxonomic assessments based on singular marker genes from multi locus
sequencing [22]. This could be due to the low resolution
of the Markov chain models or, alternatively, due to the
genomic properties reflected by these methods. The
ZOM based clusters have been shown to be sensitive to

environmental conditions as well as phylogeny [26]. The
reliability of methods based on equal probability of
mutations throughout an entire genome, like all oligonucleotide based methods discussed here, must also be
questioned. As sequencing of the genomes of organisms
is increasing, more information is gained casting doubts
about the validity of the molecular clock hypothesis [27].
Comparisons based on codon and amino acid frequencies

The ZOM, codon frequencies and amino acid frequencies based cluster diagrams (figures 1,3 and 4) group the
species in genus Brucella different than the gene based
methods (figures 5, 6 and 7). This may indicate that
conflicting evolutionary forces are driving mutational
bias and gene content in genus Brucella. Codon and
amino acid frequencies are remarkably similar for Brucella spp. compared to the species in the genera

(left-wing bars) are called cloud genes, and those found in most genomes (right-wing bars) are called shell genes. The core genes are those that
are found in all genomes (rightmost bar). The right panel indicates two different weighting strategies for computing the pan-genome tree. The
red bars give more weight to cloud genes when comparing two genomes, while the blue bars emphasize the shell genes.

Agrobacterium and Ochrobactrum. The lack of consistency between the codon and amino acid frequencies
based heatmaps on one side and the ZOM based heatmap on the other, may be due to a stronger phylogenetic signal found in the 0th order Markov chain based
model [28,29]. While the species in genus Brucella isolated from marine mammals formed one homogeneous
group in the dendrograms produced by the Markov
chain based genomic signatures, no such clustering
could be detected with the codon and amino acid frequencies based heatmaps. Codon frequencies, which are
highly affected by genomic GC content, will in turn
affect amino acid frequencies [13].
Evolutionary indications

Studies show that bacteria, which conform to an intracellular lifestyle, tend to become more AT rich [30,31].
Mutations have a tendency to go from G and C to A
and T [32]. Mutations in genes will lead to genes that
are non-expressible and eventually lost resulting in a
reduced genome size [30]. AT content is associated with
genome size in bacteria, where AT rich genomes tend
to be smaller than GC rich genomes [33-35]. Table 1
shows that the marine mammal associated Brucella spp.
are more GC rich than their terrestrial mammal based
counterparts. In addition, assuming that the sizes of the
non-assembled genomes are approximately correct, the
marine mammal associated species in genus Brucella
appear to have, on average, slightly larger genomes than
the terrestrial mammal associated species. A possible
scenario therefore, assuming a hypothetical ancestor X
for both marine and terrestrial mammal Brucella spp., is
that the marine mammal species of genus Brucella are
closer to X than the terrestrial mammal associated species. One possible explanation for this is that the terrestrial mammal associated species have been living longer
with their hosts than their marine mammal based relatives. The most GC rich genome of all Brucella spp. is
the genome of B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the hypothetical ancestor
X could have a genome that is more similar to the marine mammal associated strain. The most AT rich genome from genus Brucella examined in this study is B.
ovis ATCC 25840. From the perspective that intracellular bacteria tend to become more AT rich [30], it is possible that the genome of B. ovis ATCC 25840 is the least
similar, in terms of base composition, to the hypothetical ancestor X of all species in genus Brucella examined
here. It should be noted that the idea that B. pinnipedialis M163/99/10 is the last descendant from X rests on
the assumption that genomes from intracellular bacteria
become progressively smaller and more AT rich [25].
Buchnera aphidicola, Mycobacterium leprae and Sodalis
glossinidius are examples of microbes all presumed to

Page 12 of 16

have adapted to an intra-cellular environment with the
consequences of increased AT richness and genome
reduction [30,36,37]. The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus MED4 provides an interesting example of a
free-living bacterium, not associated with any host,
becoming more AT rich and having undergone genome
reduction possibly due to adaption to an environment
with less nutrients available [38].
We emphasize again that the scenario described above
is only one possible explanation. An alternative assertion
to the genome reduction hypothesis is that species
found in similar environments tend to have genomes
with similar AT content regardless of phylogenetic relationship [39,40]. Therefore, the difference in AT content
between the marine and terrestrial mammal Brucella
strains may be a consequence of environmental
differences.
Gene based comparisons

The remarkable consistency between the proteome
based comparisons and current Brucella taxonomy differs from the DNA based methods. Therefore, the congruent shell and cloud trees suggest that DNA uptake
from species outside genus Brucella is an infrequent
event, at least for the sequenced genomes included in
this study. This is also supported by SNP analysis,
which indicate that DNA exchange is fairly uncommon
in genus Brucella [10]. Since the phylogeny recreated by
the pan-genomic analyses resemble the pair-wise
BLAST comparisons, it appears that gene similarity in
the species of genus Brucella is concordant to current
taxonomy based on marker genes and similar methods
[9]. This implies that any mutation in the marker genes
may be indirectly linked to gene gain or loss in genus
Brucella. The difference in results obtained using the
oligonucleotide based methods and the gene based
methods suggest that the genomic properties reflected
by the respective methods represent different perspectives. In previous work, we found that the ZOM based
method is associated with a set of genomic properties
including environment and phylogeny [26]. The ZOM
based method is therefore a more composed method
than the marker gene based comparison methods, in the
sense that the ZOM heatmap topology is determined
from a multitude of genomic properties.
The close resemblance found between the marker
gene based phylogeny on one hand and the proteome
based phylogeny on the other may thus be an indication
that the mutations in the marker genes are somehow
connected to gene loss or gain. In contrast to the result
obtained with the Markov chain based genomic signatures, the differences in gene content in genus Brucella
seem to be in accordance with a genome-wide molecular clock [41].

Bohlin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:249
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/249

All species in genus Agrobacterium and genus Ochrobactrum are, in general, different from the species in
genus Brucella both in terms of the oligonucleotide
based methods and the gene based methods. The closest
match in terms of gene content between a genome of a
species from genus Brucella and a non-Brucella species
was found to be between B. suis 1330 (biovar 1) and O.
anthropi ATCC 49188, having a gene similarity of 48%.
All genomes of the species in genus Brucella showed a
gene content similarity of more than 70%. This raises
again the question whether the genomes of the species
in genus Brucella discussed in the present work should
be divided into different species rather than strains.
Such a scenario would imply that the members of genus
Ochrobactrum would join genus Brucella, while the present species in genus Brucella would all be one species,
but different subspecies or strains. For instance, the two
genomes of the two species in genus Ochrobactrum discussed here were found to share only 57% of their
genes, and the most similar genomes of genus Agrobacterium shared only 35% of their genes. Thus, based on
the methods described in this work, there are many
aspects that must be taken into consideration when taxonomy and phylogeny is to be decided.

Conclusions
We find that the ZOM based heatmap is superior to
both the codon and amino acid frequencies based heatmaps at distinguishing between closely related species
and strains. The Markov chain based genomic signatures
appear to have a higher resolution than the codon frequencies. The codon frequencies have a higher resolution than the amino acid frequencies. The amino acid
frequencies between the genomes however, appear to be
more diverse than the codon frequencies. Figure 2
shows that the differences between the different Markov
chain models is small.
The proteome based comparisons, i.e. the BLAST
matrix and pan-genomic analyses, differ somewhat from
the base composition based methods, i.e. Markov chain
based genomic signatures and codon and amino acid
frequencies based methods, in terms of species classification. The BLAST matrix, based on pair-wise gene
comparisons between the genomes of all microbes support the present Brucella taxonomy remarkably well
suggesting a correlation between marker gene based
phylogeny and the proteomes in genus Brucella. The
pan-genomic analyses, including both shell and cloud
weighted trees, also support the present Brucella taxonomy suggesting, in addition, infrequent horizontal transfer between species from genus Brucella and organisms
belonging to other genera.
Comparing the pan-genomic trees to the base compositional based Markov chain models and codon and amino

Page 13 of 16

acid frequencies based methods, it can be concluded that
subtle differences can be found below protein level.
While there appears to be a fairly conserved gene pool in
genus Brucella, more differences can also be found at the
nucleotide level using the Markov chain based genomic
signatures, which appeared to group the different species
more strongly according to environment.

Methods
All genomes were downloaded from Genbank [http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi], the PATRIC
website [42] [http://patric.vbi.vt.edu/] and the Broad
Institute [http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/brucella_group/MultiHome.html]. All genomes
consisting of two chromosomes were concatenated into
one file for each genome. All oligonucleotide based analyses were carried out in the 5’-3’ direction for each genome (see [43,44] for justification of this). All statistical
and mathematical analyses were carried out using the
program R [45].
Genomic signatures based on the 0th, 1st and 2nd order
Markov chain models

The 0th, 1st and 2nd order Markov chain model based
genomic signatures, referred to here respectively as
ZOM, FOM and SOM based models, are different methods used to compare genomes by estimating the total
difference between observed and approximated tetranucleotide frequencies. A thorough explanation of the different Markov chain model based genomic signatures
can be found in [12]. Therefore, only a brief explanation
of the notation used and a superficial introduction will
be given below.
The heatmap based on the 0th order Markov chain model

This heatmap (Figure 1), referred to as the ZOM-heatmap, is based on pair-wise comparisons using the 0 th
order Markov chain model ([12,26,44]). Tetranucleotide
frequencies are estimated for all genomes and normalized
with respect to the corresponding nucleotide frequencies:

 XYZW ( f ) =

f XYZW
f X fY f Z fW

(1)

A vector, consisting of the relative abundances found
using Equation (1) from all possible tetranucleotide
combinations (44 = 256), is created for each genome.
These vectors were clustered using average linkage hierarchical clustering with the Euclidean distance measure.
Dendrograms based on 0th, 1st and 2nd order Markov
property based genomic signatures

Tetranucleotide frequencies are approximated from
genomic data according to the Markov chain based

genomic signature model used. ZOM based genomic
signatures approximate genomic tetranucleotide frequencies using genomic mononucleotide frequencies as
described by Equation (1) above. FOM based signatures
approximate genomic tetranucleotide frequencies using
a combination of both genomic mono- and dinucleotide
frequencies.
f Y f Z f XYZW
f XY f YZ f ZW

 XYZW ( f ) =

(2)

SOM based genomic signatures approximate genomic
tetranucleotide frequencies using genomic di- and trinucleotide frequencies:
f XYZW f YZ
f XYZ f YZW

 XYZW ( f ) =

(3)

Instead of the average absolute distance measure used
by Karlin and others [46-48] for pair-wise comparisons,
we use the Pearson correlation measure for all signature
based methods discussed above to compare two DNA
sequences:

Cor ( f , g) =

∑ ⎡⎣ (
∑ (

XYZW ( f ) −  XYZW ( f ))

XYZW

XYZW ( f ) −  XYZW ( f ))

XYZW

×

2

×

(4)

( XYZW ( g) −  XYZW ( g)) ⎤
⎦

∑ (

XYZW ( g ) −  XYZW ( g ))

2

XYZW

This formula gives the standard Pearson correlation
coefficient between two DNA sequences f and g, using
the FOM based genomic signature, i.e. ξXYZW. Two identical sequences will result in a value of 1, while two completely different sequences will result in a value of 0. For
instance, by comparing the DNA sequence of a bacterial
genome to a completely random DNA sequence, with
similar GC content, will result in a value very close to 0.
To create the phylogenetic trees, all genomes were
compared pair-wise using the Pearson correlation measure (Equation (4)) with the ZOM, FOM and SOM
based methods. The resulting ZOM, FOM and SOM
correlation matrices, obtained from the pair-wise comparisons, are then clustered using hierarchical clustering.
Average linkage was used as the clustering method to
make the clustering as unbiased as possible. Because the
difference between genomes, as measured using the
Markov chain model based genomic signatures, was specified using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the
Manhattan method was used as the distance measure.

The codon and amino acid frequencies based heatmaps

The codon frequencies are based on overlapping trinucleotide frequencies in open reading frames predicted
for all genomes. The open reading frames were predicted using the Prodigal gene finder [14]. Vectors of
codon and amino acid frequencies, similar to the 0 th
order Markov chain model discussed above, were calculated for every genome. The amino acid based heatmap
was created using vectors containing amino acid frequencies from all converted open reading frames in
each genome. The clustering method used for the frequency vectors of both codons and amino acids was
identical to the clustering method used to generate the
ZOM based heatmap, i.e. hierarchical clustering based
on Manhattan distance and average linkage.
The BLAST matrix proteome comparisons

Genes were predicted from the selected genomes using
the Prodigal gene finder [14]. A BLAST matrix was constructed by performing pair-wise gene comparisons
using BLAST for all genomes [15,49]. Based on these
results, sequences were clustered into gene families
according to the ‘fifty-fifty’ rule, i.e. two sequences are
in the same family if the best local alignment between
them cover at least 50% of the length of both sequences
and also contain at least 50% identities ([16]). When a
genome is compared to itself using BLAST paralogs are
excluded. Thus, a genome compared to it self will seldom match 100% since the paralogs are not included.
Pan-genomics

Gene families were computed as described above for the
BLAST matrix. The presence or absence of gene families
was stored as a pan-matrix M, where each row i corresponds to a gene family and each column j a genome.
Then, if gene family i is present in genome j, Mij = 1, if
not Mij = 0.
The presence or absence of pan-genome gene families
can be used to give a high-resolution clustering of genomes. We have constructed a pan-genome tree based on
relative Manhattan distances between genomes, computed from the pan-matrix. The distance between the
genomes l and k is simply the fraction of gene families
where their presence or absence status differs [50].
When computing this distance, some genes may be
given less weight than others, i.e. disagreement in presence or absence status is more important for some
types of genes [51]. When considering pan-genomes we
propose the weightings shown in Figure 8. The shell
genes are the gene families often observed among the
genomes, while the cloud genes are rarely observed [52].
Both shell and cloud type of genes can be emphasized
by the weighting strategies shown in Figure 8.
