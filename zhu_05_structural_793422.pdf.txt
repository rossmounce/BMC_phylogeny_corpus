Abstract
Background: There has been tremendous interest in the study of biological network structure.
An array of measurements has been conceived to assess the topological properties of these
networks. In this study, we compared the metabolic network structures of eleven single cell
organisms representing the three domains of life using these measurements, hoping to find out
whether the intrinsic network design principle(s), reflected by these measurements, are different
among species in the three domains of life.
Results: Three groups of topological properties were used in this study: network indices, degree
distribution measures and motif profile measure. All of which are higher-level topological
properties except for the marginal degree distribution. Metabolic networks in Archaeal species are
found to be different from those in S. cerevisiae and the six Bacterial species in almost all measured
higher-level topological properties. Our findings also indicate that the metabolic network in
Archaeal species is similar to the exponential random network.
Conclusion: If these metabolic network properties of the organisms studied can be extended to
other species in their respective domains (which is likely), then the design principle(s) of Archaea
are fundamentally different from those of Bacteria and Eukaryote. Furthermore, the functional
mechanisms of Archaeal metabolic networks revealed in this study differentiate significantly from
those of Bacterial and Eukaryotic organisms, which warrant further investigation.

Background
Classification of biological organisms is of fundamental
importance to evolutionary studies. It is commonly
believed that there are three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryote. Currently, the most popular classification method is the so called "molecular approach", in
which polymorphism information in DNA or protein
sequence is exploited to assess the phylogenetic relationships among species [1,2]. To a large extent, this is a
"local" approach since the choice of sequence for compar-

ison greatly affects the final result, "lateral gene transfer"
(LGT) and thus the resulting "genome chimerism" further
complicates the situation [3]. A new "system" approach
that takes "global" properties of each organism into consideration serves as a potential alternative to overcome
this shortcoming. Indeed, recent advances in system biology and increasingly available genomic databases have
made it possible to rebuild biological networks from
genomic data and have offered opportunity for such a
"system" approach [4].

Podani and co-workers [5] proposed classifying organisms based on two kinds of network indices: the Jaccard
index, which measures proportions of common sets of
nodes in two networks, and Goodman-Kruskal γ function,
which measures the similarity between rankings of nodes
in two networks. They studied metabolic and information
network structures of 43 organisms using these two measures under the hypothesis that network structure and the
network design principle(s) behind them contain phylogenetic information. Ma and Zeng [6] conducted a more
extensive phylogenetic classification study on 82 fully
sequenced organisms based on different cellular function
systems (enzyme, reaction, and genes) at the genomic
level. They constructed phylogenetic tree based on Jaccard
index and Korbel's definition, and concluded that in general, the classification based on network indices are in
good agreement with the one obtained by analyzing the
16S rRNA using molecular approach. These studies seem
to support the notion that significant differences in the
network design principle(s) exist among the three
domains of life [7]. These differences may reflect on the
different approaches that organisms take to organize their
entire systems to serve their special needs in the environment they live during the evolutionary history. Motivated
by these encouraging results, in this manuscript, we went
on to conduct a thorough comparison of network structural properties which provide further and more compelling evidences that significant differences exist among the
network design principle(s) in organisms from the three
domains of life.
Restricted by the theoretical network structural studies,
there are not many deterministic and informative topological measurements available [8-11]. The established
measurements can be roughly divided into two categories:
higher-level (global) properties and low-level (local)
properties. The difference between the two is that one
needs to know the whole network in order to calculate the
higher-level property measures (e.g. average path length)
while the low-level properties can be worked out locally
(e.g. marginal degree of individual node) [9]. We use
three groups of topological measurements (both low and
higher-level) that address different aspects of the network
structure. The first group contains network indices such as
average clustering coefficient, average path length [12].
The second group is composed of degree distributions
(both marginal and bivariate joint degree distributions)
[8-11,13]. The third group is composed of network motif
profiles that are recently shown to represent the network
design principle(s) and global statistical properties of the
network when aggregating together [14-16]. These measurements have been well studied in the network literatures, and are able to capture most aspects of network
degree information.

Single cell model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae
have been studied intensively in biochemistry, cell biology and genetics; hence the rebuilt networks in those
organisms present the best chance to approximate the true
underlying network. Moreover, single cell organisms are
less likely to have experienced the Whole Genome Duplication (WGD), which might drastically change the network structure [17,18]. As a result, we selected eleven
single cell organisms to study their network structural
properties: one Eukaryote: S. cerevisiae; six Bacteria: E. coli,
V. cholerae, R. solanacearum, B. subtilis, L. lactis, S. coelicolor;
and four Archaea: S. solfataricus, S. tokodaii, M. acetivorans,
T. acidophilum.
There are three main types of intracellular networks: the
protein-protein interaction network, the transcriptional
regulation network and the metabolic network. The first
two are rebuilt by using high throughput techniques such
as yeast two-hybrid system, in vivo pull down assay or
DNA microarray, which are subject to high uncertainties,
and the resulting networks may not be good approximation to biological complexity [19-22]. On the other hand,
the metabolic network is derived from metabolic pathways, many of which are inferred from biochemical experiment-defined stoichiometries of many reactions [23]. It
is well known that central pathways contain "hub nodes"
of the whole metabolic network [24,25] and are also main
building blocks of the so-called Giant Strongly Connected
Component (GSCC) and Giant Weakly Connected Components (GWCC) [26]. The former is defined as the largest
cluster of nodes within which any pair of nodes is mutually reachable from each other, and the latter is defined as
the largest cluster of nodes within which each pair of
nodes is connected in the underlying undirected graph
[10]. Therefore, our high confidence in the structure of
GSCC and GWCC, based on experimentally verified pathways, guarantees high confidence in whole network structure. The long history of biochemical studies of enzymes
ensures relatively low false positive and low false negative
rates of connections. Therefore, we decided to use metabolic networks in single cell organisms to compare network topological properties in the three domains of life.

Results
In constructing metabolic networks, Ma and Zeng [28]
argued that connections through "current metabolites",
which is referred to as cofactors in biochemistry such as
ATP, ADP, H2O, should be removed from metabolic networks. We followed their suggestions by removing such
"current metabolites" before conducting the following
analysis.
Group I measures: network indices
Before checking different types of network topological
measurements, we visually compared different metabolic

networks (Fig. 1). Metabolic networks in S. cerevisiae and
the six Bacterial species appear much more heterogeneous
than Archaeal metabolic networks. It is well known that
the so-called exponential random network (marginal
degree distribution follows a Poisson distribution, see
Methods for details) appears homogeneous while scalefree network (marginal degree distribution follows a
power-law distribution, see Methods for details) appears
more heterogeneous and modular [9].
Calculations of the two classic network indices, average
clustering coefficient and average betweenness (see Methods for definition) also indicate that the metabolic networks in S. cerevisiae andthe six Bacterial species are more
clustered and modular than those in the four Archaeal
species (Table 1, Fig. 2). From Table 1 and Fig. 2, it is evi-

dent that the Clustering Coefficient (C) and Betweenness
(B) did a better job in separating Archaeal species from
non-Archaeal species than Average Path Length (L) and
Diameter (D). Note that since we removed connections
through "current metabolites" when constructing metabolic networks, our average path lengths are much longer
than those reported in Jeong et al. [25] but similar to those
reported in Ma and Zeng [28].
To avoid the confounding effects stemming from different
network sizes, we calculated the so-called concentrations
(number of appearances of subgraphs divided by the
number of nodes with edges or arcs (directed edges), see
Methods for details) of three-node subgraphs and fournode subgraphs. The concentration of subgraphs is an
objective measure of the extent of clustering and

tion follows a power-law distribution [25,29-31]. Our
analysis demonstrates that the outgoing and incoming
marginal degree distributions in metabolic networks also
follow the power-law distribution. A simple linear model
fits the log-transformed data well (except for the incoming
degree distributions for most of the Archaea) which indicates that in general, the power-law model is appropriate
to capture the structure of degree data (Fig. 4). Parameters
were estimated using the Least Square method. The results
together with goodness of fit measure R2 and 95% individual confidence intervals are summarized in Table 2 and
Table 3. The estimated power-law index γ is around -0.3 in
all cases and the estimated log-transformed scaling
parameter α ranges within 2.0 to 2.5. These indicate that
marginal degree distribution, which is a low-level (local)
topological property measure, although showed some distinction, is not enough to effectively differentiate networks from different domains. Overall, metabolic
networks in most of the species we studied seem to follow
the power-law distributions and thus are "scale-free". The
fact that the incoming degree distributions of most
Archaeal species we studied do not follow power-law well
(Fig. 4B) suggests that networks in Archaeal species tend
to be less "scale-free" and more "random-like" compared
to those of the non-Archaeal species.

As we have shown, marginal degree distribution alone
does not reveal the fundamental network structural differences between the Archaeal species and the non-Archaeal
species. Simulation studies have shown that randomized
networks preserving marginal degree distribution can be
quite different in terms of global (higher level) topological properties such as average clustering coefficient [9]. In
metabolic networks, we are unable to determine the preferred types of reactions based on just marginal substrate
or product degree distributions. Since the metabolic network is rebuilt from chemical reactions, joint behavior of
substrate and product in reactions should be more
informative than disjoint behavior of metabolites. Therefore, we calculate the joint degree distributions hoping to
gain more insight into the network organization.
Joint degree distributions
Joint degree distribution measures and describes correlation between connectivities of neighboring nodes. N(K0,
K1) is defined as the number of edges connecting nodes of
connectivity K0 to those of connectivity K1. For metabolic
networks, which are directed, N(Kout, Kin) is used to measure the number of arches where substrate (node) with
out-connectivity Kout transforms to product with in-connectivity Kin. This quantity reflects intrinsic properties of
the network and can be used to distinguish different types

obtained by compare Z to a standard normal distribution.
Comparing with "properly" randomized network
ensembles allows us to concentrate on those statistically
significant patterns of the complex network that are likely
to reflect the design principle(s) [13].
We calculated statistically significant correlation profiles
(Z-score profiles, see Methods for details) for the metabolic network in each organism (Fig. 5). The Z-score profiles of the four Archaeal species are similar to each other
but quite different from those in S. cerevisiae and the six
Bacterial species. Although the dark red regions of the Zscore profiles in Archaeal species are quite different in
scale, they all seem to differ significantly from the random
network preserving the corresponding marginal degree
distribution in a similar way (p-value < 0.1). Looking into
the correlation profiles more carefully, we found that the
number
of
statistically
significant
positive

Z kout ,kin > = 2 (Kout, Kin) increases in the order of S. cerevisiae,
the six Bacterial species and the four Archaeal species. The
significant Z-score of certain observation N(Kout, Kin)
implies that the chemical reaction between substrates
with out-degree Kout and products with in-degree Kin are
statistically significant. We define substrates whose Kout >=
2 or products whose Kin >= 2 as versatile metabolites.
Thus, the above trend implies that the preference to
employ reactions involving versatile metabolites increases
in the order of S. cerevisiae, the six Bacterial species and the
four Archaeal species. Correspondingly, the variety of
metabolites decreases in the above order and so does the
number of distinct enzymes or variety of enzymes because
of the high specific binding of metabolites and enzyme.
This is consistent with the biological facts that S. cerevisiae
(Eukaryote) encodes a greater variety of enzymes than
Bacterial and Archaeal species.

Group III measure: Network Motif
The network motif is defined to be recurring and non-random building blocks of the network [14,15]. Just like
sequence motif, which is an over-represented and biologically meaningful DNA or protein sub-sequence, network
motif is an over-represented and biologically meaningful
subgraph.

Network motif has been shown to be informative of network design principle(s) and network structure. It was
found that over 80% of the nodes in the E. coli transcription regulation network are covered by network motifs
[14]. Dobrin et al. [16] recently discovered that in the E.
coli transcriptional regulatory network, "individual motifs
aggregate into homologous motif clusters and a
supercluster forming the backbone of the network and
play a central role in defining its global topological organization." More importantly, network motifs capture the
information that is likely to be missed by the correlation
profiles because motif actually describes the number of
appearances of certain configurations of multiple nodes,
and therefore nicely complement with the correlation
profiles [9]. One might argue that there are certain
amount of overlaps between the information they capture
but the motif profile does not capture the degree information of the connecting nodes, which may be the most
powerful feature of the correlation profiles.
We searched for all of the 13 three-node subgraphs and all
of the 199 four-node subgraphs in the metabolic networks
of eleven species. The results showed that the three-node
motif profiles found in S. cerevisiae and the six Bacterial
species are identical while there is no three-node motif

there is no common four-node motif shared by Archaeal
species and S. cerevisiae/Bacterial species while two fournode motifs (id4702, id4950) are shared by the latter

(Additional file 1). Among all the 13 possible three-node
subgraphs, six of them have one pair of nodes not directly
connected. Abundance of such subgraphs will lower the
extent of clustering and modularity of the network. As
expected, we found that all three-node motifs identified in
S. cerevisiae and the six Bacterial species form triangles
(Fig. 6). It may explain our main finding that metabolic
networks in non-Archaeal species are more clustered and
modular than those in Archaeal species.

Discussion
Based on our comparison of network structural properties
beyond network indices, we were able to gain more
insight into the structural differences across the three
domains of life. Having shown that the metabolic
network is "scale-free", we further showed that metabolic
networks in the four Archaeal species are closer to "exponential random network" [9:Ch2, [11]] than those in S.

cerevisiae and the six Bacterial species. The reasons are the
following:
First, the Archaeal metabolic networks are visually more
homogeneous among themselves compared to their
counterparts in the non-Archaeal species. In random networks, any pair of nodes is equally likely to be connected.
The network topology should look homogeneous given
that the size of network is large enough. The "scale-free"
network, on the other hand, features a highly modular
and heterogeneous topology since the marginal degree is
power-law distributed [8,9]. Moreover, the marginal
degree distributions of the metabolic networks in nonArchaeal species fit the power-law model better than
Archaeal species (Table 2 and Table 3).
Second, the average clustering coefficient and average
betweenness of Archaeal metabolic networks are much

Three-node motifs found in the metabolic networks in different species. The number of connecting nodes for each
network is shown. For each motif, the numbers of appearances in real networks (Nreal) and in randomized networks (Nrand ±
SD, all values rounded) are shown. The p-values of all motifs are less than 0.01, as determined by comparing to 1000 randomized networks. Each motif occurs at least four times in one network. Motifs were detected and generated using program
developed by Milo et al. (2002) and the motif dictionary therein [15].

smaller than those in S. cerevisiae and the six Bacterial species. The same is true for the concentrations of three-node
and four-node subgraphs. As pointed out by Watts and
Strogatz, real-life networks show strong clustering or network transitivity while exponential random network does
not [12].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/8

tially explained by the fact that significantly less extensive
metabolic pathway studies have been conducted in
Archaeal species [32]. Robustness of topological profiles
against random perturbations can alleviate the impact to
a certain extent but is unable to eradicate it [9].

Conclusions
Third, there is no three-node motif and fewer four-node
motifs found in Archaeal metabolic networks compared
to non-Archaeal metabolic networks. In particular, the
ubiquitous feed-forward loop (FFL) motif found in networks from biology (including metabolic networks in S.
cerevisiae and the six Bacteria species in this study) to neurology and engineering fields was not found in any of the
four Archaeal metabolic networks (Fig. 6). Since motifs
are statistically significant subgraphs compared to "properly" randomized network ensembles, no motif or fewer
than usual motifs found in a real-life network indicates
that the network structure is closer to that of a random
network. It has been shown by Milo et al. [15] that concentration of FFL motif is insensitive to the network size
within E. coli transcription regulation network, but diminishes to zero in increasingly larger random networks. This
also supports that Archaeal metabolic networks are closer
to randomized network ensembles than other real-life
networks.
The metabolic networks in Archaea are both "randomlike" and "scale-free", which might exert profound
influences on their adaptability to the hostile environment. Archaeal species are typically restricted to marginal
habitats such as hot springs or areas of low oxygen concentration and can assimilate different kinds of inorganic
carbon and nitrogen sources. Indeed, the chemical structure and component of the macromolecules such as protein and lipid make significant contributions to the
organism's adaptability to the environment. The seemingly ad hoc network organization (both "random-like"
and "scale-free") in Archaeal species might also enabled
them to survive in those extreme physiological conditions. Archaeal species might employ some biologically
significant subgraphs (rather than statistically significant
motifs) which can not be detected by current motif searching algorithm [15]. This makes the Archaeal metabolic
networks appear random in statistical sense (not statistically significantly different from random networks) but
not in biological sense.
Our comparison results showed that many network structural properties measured in Archaeal species are different
from those of non-Archaeal species. However, the hidden
anthropomorphic factors might account for some of the
differences observed. Specifically, the drastic differences
of topological profiles between the metabolic networks of
Archaeal species and non-Archaeal species may be par-

Our network analysis results showed that in most of
higher-level (global) topological properties measured,
metabolic networks in the four Archaeal species are similar to each other but significantly different from those in
S. cerevisiae and the six Bacterial species. This provides
further evidence that the metabolic network structures
and consequently the design principle(s) in the four
Archaeal species are very different from those in S. cerevisiae (Eukaryote) and the six Bacterial species. Our finding
that the metabolic networks in Archaeal species possess
many properties of the exponential random network begs
for better understanding of the design principle(s) in biological networks, which may be revealed by further systematic analyses. For example, locate and align
conservative pathways such as glycosis between E. coli or
S. cerevisiae and Archaeal species to understand the functional mechanisms of Archaeal metabolic networks.

Methods
Data source
Chemical reaction data was obtained from metabolic
database in Ma and Zeng [28], which consists of five
related tables: reaction, enzyme, react, connect and organism.
We compiled a new table from this database excluding
any inconsistent or redundant connections between
metabolites (details below). SQL was used to query the
database.
Identify and remove inconsistency
Inconsistent connections refer to pairs of metabolites that
have conflicting reversibility annotation. It is caused by
the fact that a pair of metabolites can be in more than one
reaction and the reversibility of these reactions can be different. For example, NAD+ and Nicotinamide is a pair of
metabolites in two reactions: 1) NAD+ + L-Arginine =
Nicotinamide + N2 (ADP-D-ribosyl)-L-arginine 2) NAD+
+ H2O ->Nicotinamide + ADPribose. (Note that here the
role of NAD+ is NOT "current" metabolite, and hence connections established through it should NOT be removed).
Reaction 1 is a reversible reaction while reaction 2 is not.
We annotated an edge between the two metabolites as
long as there was at least one reversible reaction that both
of them were involved. For example, the type of
connection between NAD+ and Nicotinamide is edge
(undirected connection). This step could be summarized
as "edge ← edge + arc".

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:8

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/8

Identify and remove redundancy
There are also numerous redundant connections where
the same pair of metabolites switch their roles between
substrate and product in two or more different irreversible
reactions. For example: 1) UDPglucose + N-Acylsphingosine = UDP + Glucosylceramide 2) Glucosylceramide +
H2O = D-Glucose + N-Acylsphingosine. (N-Acylsphingosine and Glucosylceramide is a pair of metabolites that
switch their roles in two irreversible reactions). In case of
redundancy, we annotated an edge between the pair of
metabolites rather than the two arcs because they could be
converted to each other through two reactions. This step
could be summarized as "edge ← arc + arc".
Definitions of some network topological measurements
Clustering coefficient (C)
We define two kinds of clustering coefficients for each
node in the directed metabolic networks, i.e. Cin and Cout.
Cin measures the average clustering coefficient of the node
representing the product that can be generated from its
first-order "nearest neighbors" through chemical reactions. Cout measures the average clustering coefficient of
the node that generate its first-order "nearest neighbors"
through chemical reactions. The larger the coefficients, the
more clustered and modular the network appears to be.
Betweenness (B)
The betweenness for any node ni in the network is defined

shortest path between a pair of nodes. Pajek [33] was used
to calculate the average betweenness, average path length
and diameter.
Concentration of subgraphs (S)
Wasserman and Katherine [27] defined the subgraph as
follows: A graph Gs is a subgraph of G if the set of nodes
of Gs is a subset of the set of nodes of G, and the set of lines
in Gs is a subset of the lines in the graph G. Let M be the
number of subgraphs, and N be the number of nodes with
edges or arcs. Then the "concentration of subgraph" is
defined as C = M/N. A high value of C indicates the
network is more clustered and modular. Mfinder1.1 [15]
was used to calculate both M and N.
Marginal degree distribution calculations
The marginal degree distribution of each network is calculated from the Boolean adjacency matrix A, a matrix of 0
or 1. Zero means there is no connection between nodes,
and 1 the opposite. The outgoing degree of the node i,

gjk(ni) is the number of shortest path between node j and

Motif profiles calculations
According to Milo et al.[15] , a subgraph is referred to as a
motif if the following criteria are met: 1) Its empirical pvalue is smaller than a pre-specified threshold, e.g. 0.01.
2) The number of appearances in real networks with
distinct sets of nodes is larger than another pre-specified
cut-off value, e.g. 4. 3) The number of appearances in real
networks is significantly larger than that in randomized
