Abstract
Background: Members of the disintegrin metalloproteinase (ADAM) family play important roles in cellular and
developmental processes through their functions as proteases and/or binding partners for other proteins. The
amphibian Xenopus has long been used as a model for early vertebrate development, but genome-wide analyses for
large gene families were not possible until the recent completion of the X. tropicalis genome sequence and the
availability of large scale expression sequence tag (EST) databases. In this study we carried out a systematic analysis of
the X. tropicalis genome and uncovered several interesting features of ADAM genes in this species.
Results: Based on the X. tropicalis genome sequence and EST databases, we identified Xenopus orthologues of
mammalian ADAMs and obtained full-length cDNA clones for these genes. The deduced protein sequences, synteny
and exon-intron boundaries are conserved between most human and X. tropicalis orthologues. The alternative splicing
patterns of certain Xenopus ADAM genes, such as adams 22 and 28, are similar to those of their mammalian
orthologues. However, we were unable to identify an orthologue for ADAM7 or 8. The Xenopus orthologue of ADAM15,
an active metalloproteinase in mammals, does not contain the conserved zinc-binding motif and is hence considered
proteolytically inactive. We also found evidence for gain of ADAM genes in Xenopus as compared to other species.
There is a homologue of ADAM10 in Xenopus that is missing in most mammals. Furthermore, a single scaffold of X.
tropicalis genome contains four genes encoding ADAM28 homologues, suggesting genome duplication in this region.
Conclusions: Our genome-wide analysis of ADAM genes in X. tropicalis revealed both conservation and evolutionary
divergence of these genes in this amphibian species. On the one hand, all ADAMs implicated in normal development
and health in other species are conserved in X. tropicalis. On the other hand, some ADAM genes and ADAM protease
activities are absent, while other novel ADAM proteins in this species are predicted by this study. The conservation and
unique divergence of ADAM genes in Xenopus probably reflect the particular selective pressures these amphibian
species faced during evolution.
Background
ADAMs belong to the M12B subfamily of metalloproteinases and metalloproteinase-like proteins [1]. A prototype ADAM is a type I transmembrane protein, but some
ADAMs are also present as soluble forms, either due to
alternative splicing or protease-mediated cleavage ("shedding") from the cell surface [2,3]. ADAMs are multidomain proteins with an extracellular metalloproteinase
domain, a disintegrin domain and a cysteine-rich domain;
therefore they are also called MDC (metalloproteinase/

disintegrin/cysteine-rich) proteins. Some but not all
ADAMs contain a canonical zinc-binding motif within
the metalloproteinase domain, which is required for protease activity [2,3]. The disintegrin domain can selectively
interact with different integrins [4]; together with the
cysteine-rich domain, it may modulate cell-cell and cellmatrix adhesion [4-6], as well as substrate recognition by
the metalloproteinase domain [7,8]. The cytoplasmic tail
contains binding sites for a variety of cellular proteins,
and may be involved in inside-out signaling that regulates
the activity of the ectodomain [9-11].
A phylogenetic tree of ADAMs identified in different
species can be found in the tree families database TreeFam [12]. About half of the ADAMs are solely or predom-

inantly expressed in the testis of mammals (i.e. testisspecific), with no orthologue found in nonmammalian
species [12,13]. Functions of these ADAMs are thus
mainly related to mammalian reproduction. The other
ADAMs are expressed widely in tissues and organs other
than the testis. Many of these ADAMs are implicated in
embryonic development. Mice lacking or carrying defective ADAM genes often display developmental abnormalities that vary from defects in adipogenesis and
myogenesis [14] and mild dysfuctions in the central nervous system (CNS)[15,16], to more severe defects such as
early embryonic and perinatal lethality [17-19]. The
activities of ADAMs are also linked to a variety of human
diseases, such as cancer [20] and cardiovascular diseases
[21], as well as rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases [22]. However, the molecular bases for the
functions of ADAMs are largely unappreciated, and identifying the in vivo substrates and binding partners for
ADAMs remains a major challenge [2,23]. Furthermore,
functional redundancy between two or more ADAMs
seems to be a common phenomenon [24,25], posing an
additional difficulty for understanding the roles of
ADAMs in development and diseases.
One area that has drawn increasing interest concerns
the roles of ADAMs in cell signaling, mainly via shedding
of cell surface proteins by ADAM metalloproteinase
activities. Through this process, ADAMs release key
extracellular signaling proteins (e.g. growth factors such
as EGF and cytokines such as TNF-α) from the cell surface [3,22]. ADAMs also participate in the generation of
key intracellular signals (e.g. Notch and ErbB4 intracellular domain) by performing an obligate ectodomain cleavage event prior to a regulated intramembraneous
proteolytic cleavage [26,27]. Recently, a subgroup of nonproteolytic ADAMs, ADAMs 11, 22 and 23, were shown
to function as receptors for the secreted Leucine-rich
glioma inactivated (LGI) proteins, which are required for
proper synaptic transmission in the brain [28,29]. Regulation of cell adhesion and migration is another major function of ADAMs. A large body of evidence suggests that
ADAM disintegrin domains can interact with integrins,
although most ADAMs do not contain the conserved
RGD integrin binding sequence [30,31]. The cysteinerich domain of ADAM12 can also mediate cell adhesion
by binding cell surface syndecans [6,32]. Furthermore,
ADAM metalloproteinase activities are also involved in
remodeling extracellular matrix and regulating cell-cell
adhesion through cleavage of extracellular matrix components (e.g. type IV collagen and fibronectin) [33-35] and
adhesion molecules (e.g. cadherins) [36-40].
The amphibian Xenopus laevis has been used for
decades as a model system for studying early vertebrate
development. The easy availability of large numbers of

Page 2 of 13

fertilized eggs, the ability of the embryos to develop and
be manipulated in vitro, and the transparent epidermis of
the tadpoles provide some practical advantages over
mammalian and other models. However, the pseudo-tetraploid genome and long generation time of this species
prevented it from being widely used for genetic and
genomic research. These difficulties were overcome in
large part by the adoption of Xenopus tropicalis, a closely
related species with a true diploid genome and a relatively
short generation time. The genome sequence of X. tropicalis is now complete, and large collections of EST clones
from both X. tropicalis and X. laevis are available, providing useful tools for systematic prediction and characterization of large families of genes. A recently published
genome-wide analysis of the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), another family of extracellular metalloproteinases that is related to the ADAMs, revealed evolutionary
conservation and distinct duplication patterns of MMPs
in X. tropicalis as compared to humans and other mammals [41]. Several ADAM genes have been cloned previously from X. laevis and characterized for their functions
in fertilization and development [34,42-45]. Given the
key roles of these ADAMs in vivo, it is important to
establish their orthologues in mammals and to identify
their paralogues in the Xenopus genome.
As an initial step for systematic studies of all ADAM
family proteins in the frog species, we started out to identify the homologues of known vertebrate ADAMs that
are expressed in X. tropicalis. Our study shows that most
non-testis specific ADAMs are conserved between frogs
and mammals. However, some potential loss or gain of
ADAM genes (and possibly functions) in X. tropicalis as
compared to mammals suggests evolutionary divergence
of ADAMs in this amphibian species.

Results and discussion
ADAM genes in the X. tropicalis genome

Searches of the current version (v4.1) of the X. tropicalis
genome assembly yielded homologues for most known
vertebrate non-testis specific ADAMs. Sequences of
these predicted ADAM genes were then used to search
against the EST databases (or to design primers for experimental cloning) to obtain full-length cDNA clones from
X. tropicalis and, where possible, X. laevis. No orthologues of the mammalian testis-specific ADAMs have
been found in any nonmammalian species [12,13]; similarly, we were unable to identify a Xenopus orthologue for
any of these ADAMs. A predicted gene encoding the
orthologue of X. laevis ADAM16 (previously known as
xMDC16), an ADAM expressed only in testis with a
potential role in fertilization [42], was localized to
Scaffold_40 of X. tropicalis genome. No orthologue of
ADAM16 was found in any other species examined,

Wei et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/211

including mammals, fish and chicken. Therefore it is
likely that ADAM16 function is limited to reproduction
of the frogs and related species.
A phylogenetic tree of X. tropicalis and human non-testis specific ADAMs is shown in Figure 1A, in which these
ADAMs are divided into several subfamilies ("clades").
Results of this analysis are consistent with an expanded
tree including other representative vertebrate species
(Additional File 1), and with previously published phylogenetic studies of ADAMs from various species
[12,30,46]. Comparison of the exon-intron structures of
X. tropicalis ADAM genes with those of human ADAM
genes [46] reveals conservation of most of the splice sites
between orthologues (Figure 1B). ADAMs can also be
divided into clades based on their splicing patterns, as
suggested by Kleino et al. ([46] and Figure 1B). While this
subgrouping method places emphasis on conservation
and divergence in gene structure, the method used in Figure 1A is based on sequence similarity and probably better reflects the conservation and evolution in gene
function. In general the phylogeny-based subgrouping
(Figure 1A) agrees well with the splicing-based method
([46] and Figure 1B), but it also differs from the latter in
two aspects: the exclusion of ADAM9 from the meltrin
clade (ADAMs 12, 13/33 and 19) and the inclusion of
ADAMs 10 and 17 into the same clade. We believe that
the former (Figure 1A) better indicates the functional
relationship among ADAM paralogues (as discussed in
the following sections). The phylogeny-based subgrouping is the method of choice here because sequence
homology and gene functions are the primary focus of
this study.
Sequence information and expression patterns of identified Xenopus ADAM genes are summarized in Table 1.
Several ADAMs, including ADAMs 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19,
22 and 23, are known to be required for normal development and health in mice [14-19,47-50]. As expected, all of
these essential ADAMs are conserved in frogs, with >50%
identities in protein sequence between X. tropicalis and
human orthologues; the other ADAMs are more divergent (Table 1). In cases where full-length sequence information of X. laevis cDNA is also available, the similarities
between X. tropicalis and X. laevis orthologues are high
(>80% identities in protein sequence), consistent with the
close relationship between these two species (Table 1).
The orthologous relationship between human and X.
tropicalis ADAMs is further supported by synteny analyses, which show the conservation of genetic linkages
between most adams and nearby genes in these two species (Figure 2). However, we were unable to identify any
likely orthologue for ADAM7 or 8 in the X. tropicalis
genome or in X. tropicalis/X. laevis EST databases.
ADAM7 is mainly expressed in the testis [51], but limited
expression is also detected in muscles and kidney [52].

* Expression patterns were estimated by the presence of ESTs (full or partial) in different organs and/or developmental stages, as deposited in

entries are present in a single organ at a single developmental stage and account for >50% of all ESTs found in GenBank.

This ADAM seems to be mammal-specific and no orthologue has been identified to date in other animals [12].
Therefore it is perhaps not surprising that it is also absent
in frogs. In the human genome adam7 lies next to
adam28 and adamdec1, whereas in X. tropicalis this metalloproteinase gene "cluster" is replaced by four homologues of adam28 in tandem (Figure 2K; see further
discussion below). ADAM8 is one of the most widely

studied ADAMs, with potential roles in cancer and
inflammatory diseases [53]. However, mice with targeted
deletion of the ADAM8 gene do not display any apparent
developmental or pathological phenotypes [54], indicating that this gene is dispensable for normal development
and health. The human adam8 gene was mapped to chromosome 10, with tubgcp2 and znf511 on one side and
kndc1 and gpr123 on the other side (Figure 2L). Although

znf511 and spfh1/chuk, and the other by tubgcp2 and an
additional homologue of chuk (Figure 2L), suggesting
possible genome duplication associated with gene loss in
this region. In the X. tropicalis genome, tubgcp2 and
znf511 were localized to scaffold_598, whereas kndc1 and
gpr123 were localized to a different scaffold, scaffold_266
(Figure 2L), and spfh1 and chuk lie separately on two
other scaffolds (not shown). No adam8 homologue was
found on any of these scaffolds. These results suggest that
this genomic region has undergone extensive rearrangement during evolution, and that the adam8 gene was
probably lost in the frogs. The possible absence of an
ADAM8 orthologue in the X. tropicalis genome may
reflect a poor conservation of this ADAM metalloproteinase during evolution. We also cannot rule out the possibility that the available genome sequence data may be
incomplete.
In addition to potential loss of ADAM genes as compared to the mammalian genomes, there is also evidence
for additional ADAM genes in the X. tropicalis genome.
A homologue of ADAM10, which we named ADAM10like, was found in Xenopus but absent in most placental
mammals. We also identified four homologues of
ADAM28 on Scaffold_30 of the X. tropicalis genome
assembly. Features of X. tropicalis ADAMs identified in
this study are discussed in the following sections in terms
of different ADAM clades as indicated in Figure 1A.

genes are shown in grey, and orthologues are connected with a vertical line. Orthologues of other genes are shown in the same colors, and

the loci of adam8, tubgcp2 and znf511 are also conserved
in the chicken genome, kndc1 and gpr123 genes are not
localized in the vicinity; instead two other genes, spfh1
and chuk, are found in this region (Figure 2L). There are
two adam8 homologues in fish (takifugu), one flanked by

We previously identified X. laevis ADAM13 as a proteolytically active ADAM expressed predominantly in cranial neural crest (CNC) cells [44], an embryonic cell
population that gives rise to craniofacial structures in
vertebrates [55,56]. Ectopic expression of a protease-dead
mutant of ADAM13, as well as antisense morpholino
mediated knockdown of ADAM13, inhibits CNC migration in neurula stage embryos [34,40]. A closely related
ADAM, ADAM19, was recently found to be required for
CNC induction and migration in X. laevis [45]. The similarity between the in vivo functions of ADAMs 13 and 19
raises the possibility that these two ADAM metalloproteinases may act through similar mechanisms (e.g. by
cleaving the same physiologically relevant substrates).
Furthermore, there may be additional paralogues with
similar roles in CNC development encoded by the frog
genome. To address these questions we performed a
search for closely related homologues of X. laevis
ADAMs 13 and 19 in X. tropicalis.
Analysis of the X. tropicalis genome indicates that there
are three ADAMs closely related to X. laevis ADAM13: X.
tropicalis ADAMs 12, 13 and 19. We obtained full-length
cDNA constructs for these ADAMs by direct cloning. As
shown in Figure 3A, sequence comparison with other
ADAM family members suggests that these three pro-

Wei et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/211

teins constitute an ADAM subfamily with clear orthologous relationships between Xenopus and mammalian
ADAMs 12 and 19. Although the relationship is not as
clear, the most parsimonious explanation is that Xenopus
ADAM13 and mammalian ADAM33 are orthologues.
This is further supported by the synteny analysis, which
shows a conserved genetic linkage between adam13/33
and spef1, hspa12b and an unknown gene (Figure 2E).
ADAM12, 13/33, and 19 orthologs are detectable in
zebrafish, suggesting that this ADAM subfamily was
present in the ancestral vertebrate (Figure 3A). RT-PCR
analyses showed that ADAMs 12, 13 and 19 are each
expressed by neurula stage in X. tropicalis (Figure 3B;
PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing).
Functions of these ADAMs in CNC and neural develop-

ment will be discussed separately (Wei et al., manuscript
submitted).
ADAM15

Human ADAM15 was originally named metargidin (metalloprotease-RGD-disintegrin protein), because it was the
first cellular disintegrin protein (and to date the only
human ADAM) found to contain the consensus RGD
integrin binding site in the disintegrin domain [57]. However, this RGD sequence is not conserved in mouse
ADAM15 [58]. The mammalian ADAM15 gene encodes
an active metalloproteinase, and several substrates have
been identified for this enzyme [59-61]. Mice lacking
ADAM15 do not show any apparent deficiencies, but
they are more resistant to pathological neovascularization [62].
We searched the X. tropicalis genome and EST databases and identified an ADAM15 homologue that is 44%
identical to the human protein. Similar to human
adam15 [46], the gene encoding this homologue was
localized next to efna4 in the X. tropicalis genome (Figure
2F), suggesting that it is the orthologue of ADAM15. A
cDNA clone encoding the X. laevis orthologue of this
protein was also found in the EST databases (BC146626).
Surprisingly, unlike the mammalian ADAM15 proteins,
which contain the consensus zinc-binding motif HEXGH
in the catalytic domain, both X. tropicalis ADAM15 and
its X. laevis orthologue have the sequence HQXGH in
this position (Figure 4). An E to Q mutation in the same
motif has been shown to result in loss of proteolytic activity in ADAM12 [63], hence it is likely that frogs do not
have an active ADAM15 metalloproteinase. Mammalian
ADAM15 contains a proline-rich cytoplasmic tail with
several potential Src homology-3 (SH3) domain binding
sites [64]. As shown in Figure 4, many of these prolines
are conserved in mammals and frogs. In contrast, while
the mammalian ADAM15 proteins share a strikingly similar signal peptide, this peptide is less conserved in Xenopus ADAM15 (Additional File 2). Finally, primate, canine
and bovine ADAM15 proteins have a consensus RGD
integrin binding site in the disintegrin domain; this
sequence is not conserved in rodent or frog ADAM15.
Instead Xenopus ADAM15 proteins contain an RGD
sequence within the cysteine-rich domain (Figure 4).
Interestingly, this second RGD sequence is also present in
canine and bovine ADAM15, whereas in the primate and
rodent orthologues it is replaced by the sequence RGN
(Figure 4). A possible explanation is that the ancestor of
vertebrate ADAM15 might have two RGD integrin binding sites, one in the disintegrin domain and the other in
the cysteine-rich domain. Both of these RGD sequences
were maintained in the canine and bovine lineages (both
belong to Laurasiatheria) but lost in rodents, while primates and frogs each retained a different RGD sequence.

Figure 4 Sequence comparison of mammalian and Xenopus
ADAM15. Sequence alignment of human, chimpanzee (PANTR), canine (CANFA), bovine (BOVIN), mouse, rat, X. laevis (XENLA) and X. tropicalis ADAM15 was generated using ClustalX. Domain organization of
ADAM15 is shown with insets displaying alignments of the zinc-binding motif (the Gln in Xenopus ADAM15 is highlighted in bold and underscored), the RGD integrin-binding sites, and the conserved proline
residues in the cytoplasmic tail. Conserved residues are highlighted in
grey. See Figure 1 legend for abbreviations of domain names and Additional File 2 for a complete sequence alignment that also includes zebrafish ADAM15 proteins.

The conservation of the synteny, the SH3 binding motifs
and the RGD sequences indicates that these Xenopus
homologues are real orthologues of mammalian
ADAM15, although the metalloproteinase consensus
sequence was lost during evolution. In contrast, the two
zebrafish ADAM15 homologues both contain the conserved zinc-binding motif but lack either RGD site (Additional File 2).
ADAM28

ADAM28 (also known as MDC-L or eMDC II) is a proteolytically active ADAM that is highly expressed in the
epididymis and in lymphocytes [65-67]. Several alternatively spliced forms of ADAM28 have been detected in
vivo, including a soluble form without a transmembrane
region or cytoplasimc tail [66,67]. ADAM7, although proteolytically inactive, is closely related to ADAM28 (Figure
1). Genes encoding ADAM7, ADAM28, and
ADAMDEC1 (Decysin) form a metalloproteinase gene
cluster on human chromosome 8p12, presumably as a
result of gene duplication [68]. ADAMDEC1 is a soluble
ADAM-like protein lacking part of the disintegrin
domain and the entire cycteine-rich domain; a conserved
histidine residue in the zinc-binding motif is replaced by
aspartate, but such a replacement was thought to have no
negative effect on the metalloproteinase activity [68].
Expression of ADAMDEC1 is restricted to the immune
system and is regulated by various stimuli during monocyte differentiation [69].
As discussed above, no Xenopus orthologue of ADAM7
was identified in this analysis. ADAMDEC1 seems to

Page 7 of 13

exist only in mammals [12], and we were unable to identify any likely orthologue in the X. tropicalis genome or in
X. tropicalis/X. laevis EST databases. However, a BLAST
search against the X. tropicalis genome assembly yielded
four potential genes possibly encoding ADAM28 homologues on Scaffold_30 (Figure 2K). Although these potential genes have only slightly higher sequence similarities
to ADAM28 than to ADAM7, the deduced protein
sequences all contain a conserved zinc-binding motif
(Additional File 3 and data not shown). Therefore they
are considered homologues of adam28 (as ADAM7 is
proteolytically inactive and seems to be restricted to
mammals), and were assigned the names adams 28a-d.
We obtained full-length cDNA clones for adams 28a and
28b, and found two partial clones for adam28c
(CX934006 and CF377167). In addition, we identified a
full-length cDNA encoding a soluble form of ADAM28b
(ADAM28bs) in X. laevis EST databases (Additional File
3). The presence of soluble ADAM28 in both humans and
frogs indicates a potentially conserved function of a diffusible ADAM28 metalloproteinase in vivo. A sequence
alignment for frog and mammalian ADAM28 (including
the soluble forms) is shown in Additional File 3. As in the
case of human chromosome 8, the cluster of adam28
homologue genes on Scaffold_30 of the X. tropicalis
genome may also represent gene duplication events in
this region. Sequence comparison of the four X. tropicalis
ADAM28 homologues with human ADAM7 and
ADAMDEC1 nevertheless indicates no orthologous relationship between them (not shown). Therefore these
duplication events in the frog and human genomes may
have happened separately after the divergence of amphibians from mammals. Consistent with this hypothesis,
both chicken and fish genomes lack such duplication in
this region (Figure 2K).
ADAM9

ADAM9 (MDC9) was among the three active ADAM
metalloproteinases (the other two were ADAMs 12 and
19) first identified in myoblasts. Because one of these
ADAMs, ADAM12, is required for myotube formation in
a myoblast cell line and in certain muscle tissues in vivo,
these three ADAMs were also called the meltrins [14,70].
However, ADAM9 is not the most closely related paralogue of ADAMs 12 and 19 (Figure 1), and no apparent
phenotype in muscle development was observed in
adam9-/- mice, although a recent report showed that they
eventually develop retinal degeneration [47]. These findings suggest that ADAM9 does not belong to the meltrin
clade.
An X. laevis orthologue of ADAM9 (xMDC9) was
cloned in a previous study and, like its mouse orthologue,
was found to be ubiquitously expressed at different developmental stages [43]. In this study we identified a fulllength EST clone encoding the putative X. tropicalis

Wei et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:211
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/211

orthologue of ADAM9. Like their mammalian and
zebrafish orthologues, both X. tropicalis and X. laevis
ADAM9 proteins contain a proline-rich cytoplasmic tail
(Figure 5 and Additional File 4). Two SH3 binding motifs
have been identified previously in the cytoplasmic tails of
human and mouse ADAM9, of which the C-terminal
proximal one is also conserved in all the tetrapod species
examined, including both X. tropicalis and X. laevis (Figure 5).
ADAMs 11, 22 and 23

Three proteolytically inactive ADAMs, ADAMs 11, 22
and 23 (also known as MDC, MDC2 and MDC3, respectively), form an ADAM clade that is highly expressed in
the brain [71]. Studies with knockout mice revealed that
each of these ADAMs is required for normal neuronal
function [15,16,49,50]. It was recently shown that
ADAM22 functions as a receptor for the secreted protein
LGI1. Mutations in LGI1 cause heritable epilepsies in
humans, and one of these mutated forms of LGI1 fails to
bind ADAM22 [29,72]. In a separate study, ADAMs 11,
22 and 23 were all shown to interact with LGI1 and the
closely related LGI4 [28], suggesting that there may be a
common mechanism for these ADAMs in maintaining
normal brain function. Two X. laevis cDNA clones
encoding different ADAMs, one partial (for xMDC11a)
and one full-length (for xMDC11b), were described previously [43]. Our sequence comparison with the X. tropicalis and human genomes indicates that they are
orthologues of mammalian ADAMs 11 and 22, respectively (not shown). X. laevis ADAM11 is highly expressed

in CNC cells [43], but no functional study for this ADAM
has been reported to date.
Here we report the full-length cDNA sequences for X.
tropicalis ADAMs 11, 22 and 23. As shown in Table 1,
these three X. tropicalis ADAMs resemble their human
orthologues in both the deduced protein sequence and
the high expression level in the brain [71]. ADAM11 is
dispensable for survival in mice, but has important roles
in spatial learning, motor coordination and nociceptive
response [15,16]. Like its mammalian orthologues, X.
tropicalis ADAM11 also has a very short cytoplasmic tail
(Additional File 5). However, it lacks a large portion of the
propeptide that is present in human, mouse and zebrafish
ADAM11 (Figure 6A and Additional File 5). A survey of
the exon-intron boundaries suggests that this difference
arises from adoption of different splice sites, as exons 3, 4,
6, 7 and part of exon 5 in human adam11 (and mouse and
zebrafish adam11; data not shown) are absent in the X.
tropicalis adam11 transcript, while the other exons are
conserved between these two species (Figures. 1B and
6B). Because ADAM11 does not have the zinc-binding
motif that is required for metalloproteinase activity, it is
conceivable that part of the ADAM11 propeptide may
have been lost in frogs during evolution.
Mice lacking either ADAM22 or 23 develop severe
ataxia and die shortly after birth, and the similarity in
phenotype has led to the speculation that these two
ADAMs may act together in a nonredundant way [49,50].
Because of the similar abilities of ADAMs 11, 22 and 23
to interact with LGIs, it was also proposed that distinct
functions of these ADAMs may depend on their expression in different cell types [28]. Interestingly, both human
and mouse adam22 transcripts have multiple alternatively spliced forms, and mouse cDNA libraries obtained
from different types of cells contain different splice variants of adam22 [49,73]. We identified three differently
spliced isoforms of ADAM22 in X. tropicalis, and
sequence comparisons revealed that the previously published X. laevis ADAM22 (xMDC11b; O42596) represents yet another isoform (Figure 7A). In mammals,
alternative splicing results in multiple transmembrane
ADAM22 variants with different cytoplasmic tails; however, no soluble form has been reported to date [49,73].
Among the four Xenopus ADAM22 isoforms identified in
this study, three (ISOs 1, 2 and 4) are transmembrane
forms that differ in their cytoplasmic tails. Interestingly,
the other isoform (ISO3) is a truncated variant that lacks
a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail (Figure
7B). Given the potential physiological role of ADAM22 as
a cell surface receptor, this soluble form may provide a
possible regulatory mechanism to control the functions
of the transmembrane forms of ADAM22. It will be of
interest to determine if the splicing of adam22 mRNA in
Xenopus is also cell-type specific.

ADAMs 10, 10-like and 17

ADAMs 10 and 17 are probably the most extensively
studied ADAMs because of their important roles in
development and disease. ADAM10 (also known as Kuzbanian or KUZ) was originally discovered in Drosophila
as an essential component of the Notch signaling pathway
[74], while ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme or TACE) was first cloned in
mice as the major enzyme required for shedding of the
cytokine TNF-α [75,76]. ADAMs 10 and 17 share many
substrates, and it is still a subject of debate as to which of
these two enzymes is required for cleaving Notch receptors [77,78]. The Xenopus system has long been used to
study Notch signaling, and ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of mouse ADAM10 was shown to
cause a Notch phenotype in X. laevis embryos [26].
Therefore it is important to identify the Xenopus homologues of ADAMs 10 and 17 and understand their respective roles in early development.
We identified cDNA clones for both X. tropicalis and X.
laevis ADAM17 from Xenopus EST collections using

BLAST searches. Although it is not clear if the X. tropicalis genome contains a true TNF-α gene, these Xenopus
ADAM17 proteases may still be involved in cleavage of
other members of the TNF superfamily and/or ligands of
the epidermal growth factor receptor, as their mammalian orthologues do [79]. In addition to our previous identification of X. laevis ADAM10 [7], we obtained a fulllength clone encoding X. tropicalis ADAM10. A pair-wise
sequence comparison shows 82% identity between X.
tropicalis and human ADAM10, the highest among all
ADAMs identified in this study (Table 1), indicating that
functions of this enzyme are likely conserved in frogs. In
the Drosophila genome there exist two ADAM10 homologues, Kuzbanian (KUZ) and Kuz-like (KUL), both of
which are required for Notch signaling in certain cells
and tissues [74,80]. We also found an actively transcribed
paralogue of ADAM10 in X. tropicalis, which we named
ADAM10-like (Table 1). However, sequence comparisons
suggest that ADAM10-like is not the orthologue of Drosophila KUL (Figure 8). Therefore these two ADAM10
paralogues in different species may have been derived by
two independent gene duplication events. Homologues of
ADAM10-like were found in some other animals, including X. laevis, zebrafish and a few mammalian species.
Detailed sequence analysis and functional studies of

ADAMs 10, 10-like and 17 will be reported elsewhere (Xu
et al., manuscript in preparation). A phylogenetic tree
estimating the evolution of ADAMs 10 and 17 (as well as
KUL and X. tropicalis ADAM10-like) is shown in Figure
8.

Conclusions
ADAMs are widely involved in developmental and pathological processes through their activities as proteases and
binding partners for other proteins. The recent emergence of Xenopus tropicalis as a powerful new vertebrate
model for developmental and genetic studies prompted
us to take a genome-wide approach to identify ADAM
genes existing in this species. Using bioinformatics tools,
we were able to obtain full-length sequence information
for putative X. tropicalis orthologues of most mammalian
non-testis specific ADAMs. The orthology between X.
tropicalis and human ADAMs were further supported by
conserved splicing patterns and synteny. The high
sequence similarities between mammalian and Xenopus
ADAMs 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 22 and 23 are in good agreement with their essential roles in vivo, as demonstrated by
previous studies with knockout mice. Our sequence analyses also revealed the conservation of certain features,
such as alternative splicing and cytoplasmic SH3 binding

motifs, in some ADAMs. Functional characterization of
these ADAMs (and specific motifs) in X. tropicalis may
provide useful information to guide future research on
human development and diseases. Evolutionary divergence is also evident by the potential loss of some ADAM
genes and ADAM domains/motifs in Xenopus. Orthologues of ADAMs 7 and 8 were not detected in the current version of X. tropicalis genome sequence, and
ADAM15 protease activity and part of the ADAM11 propeptide seem to be absent in X. tropicalis. These findings
suggest that functions of these ADAMs or ADAM
domains are likely not conserved. In contrast, the additional ADAM10- and ADAM28-like metalloproteinases,
which presumably arose as results of gene duplication,
may have conferred selective advantages during the evolution of amphibians. The sequence information
described in this study provides the basis for understanding the evolution of ADAM functions in vertebrates.

Methods
Bioinformatics

Homologues of known human or X. laevis ADAM genes
were identified by using sequence-based searches of the
Joint Genome Institute (JGI) X. tropicalis genome assembly v4.1 [81], and cDNA constructs were obtained from
IMAGE Consortium distributor (OpenBiosystems) or by
experimental cloning as described below. All new X. tropicalis ADAM cDNAs reported here have been sequenced
by the Biomolecular Research Facility at the University of
Virginia, and assembled to give the final full-length
sequences. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed with ClustalX 2.0 [82]. Phylogenetic trees were
generated using ClustalX (neighbor joining), Phylip
neighbor, Phylip protpars (maximum parsimony) and
Phylip proml (maximum likelyhood) [83]. Trees were displayed using the Phylip application Drawtree. Because
phylogenetic trees generated using different methods are
consistent with each other, only those generated with
ClustalX are shown in the main figures (see Additional
File 6 for trees generated using the other models). For
bootstrap analyses, bootstrap replicate groups were created using Phylip application Seqboot, and bootstrap values were calculated using Phylip Neighbor, Protpars, and
Proml analyses (bootstrap values calculated with ClustalX are very similar to those calculated with Phylip
Neighbor, therefore only the latter are shown). Synteny
analyses were carried out using Metazome [84]. Exonintron structures were estimated by comparing the cDNA
sequences with X. tropicalis genome sequence using
BLAT searching from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
Site [85]. Signal peptidase cleavage sites were assigned
according to available sequence annotations (for known
ADAMs) or predictions by SignalP (for new ADAMs
identified in this study) [86]. Domain structure predic-

tions were carried out using the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) [87].
The following human ADAM protein sequences were
used to identify their X. tropicalis homologues: ADAM9
(Q13443), ADAM10 (O14672), ADAM11 (O75078),
ADAM12 (O43184), ADAM15 (Q13444), ADAM17
(P78536), ADAM19 (Q9H013), ADAM22 (Q9P0K1),
ADAM23 (O75077), ADAM28 (Q9UKQ2), and
ADAM33 (Q9BZ11). Previously reported X. laevis
ADAMs used in this study are: ADAM9/xMDC9
(NP_001079073), ADAM10 (Q8JIY1), ADAM11/
xMDC11a (Q9PSZ3), ADAM13 (AAI69959), ADAM19
(ACE82293), and ADAM22/xMDC11b (O42596).

(8916700), ADAM22 isoform 3 (7650959), ADAM23
(7649052), ADAM28a (7716115), and ADAM28b
(8898681); X. laevis ADAM15 (7978429; GenBank accession # BC146626), ADAM17 (3199617; GenBank accession # DQ287907), and ADAM28bs (5513111; GenBank
accession #BC091726).
Cloning and RT-PCR

Total RNA from X. tropicalis embryos at desired stages
was prepared as described [88]. X. tropicalis orthologues
of X. laevis adam13 and mammalian adams 12 and 19,
and X. tropicalis adam10-like gene were identified by
searching against the X. tropicalis genome assembly, and
the predicted sequences were used to design primers for
RT-PCR to obtain partial clones. 5'- and 3'- RACE was
then performed using BD Smart RACE kit (BD Biosciences), and full-length cDNA sequences were assembled
into pCR2.1. RT-PCR experiments for expression of
adams 12, 13, and 19 were carried out using total RNA
purified from X. tropicalis embryos at different developmental stages. Primer sequences are shown in Additional
File 7.
