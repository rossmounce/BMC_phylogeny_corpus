Abstract
Introduction Interleukin (IL)-18 is a key modulator of the
cytokine response that leads to organ dysfunction and
prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay after cardiopulmonary
bypass surgery. We hypothesised that variation in the proinflammatory gene IL-18 is associated with adverse clinical
outcome because of a more intense inflammatory response.
Methods Haplotypes of the IL-18 gene were inferred from
genotypes of 23 Coriell Registry subjects. Four haplotype tag
single nucleotide polymorphisms (-607 C/A, -137 G/C, 8148
C/T and 9545 T/G) identified four major haplotype clades.
These polymorphisms were genotyped in 658 Caucasian
patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Clinical
phenotypes were collected by retrospective chart review.
Results Patients homozygous for the T allele of the 9545 T/G
polymorphism had an increased occurrence of prolonged ICU

Introduction
The balance of pro-inflammatory (e.g. tumour necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α)) and anti-inflammatory (e.g. interleukin (IL)-10)
cytokine gene expression is highly correlated with organ dysfunction and adverse outcome after cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB) surgery [1]. IL-18 is a key cytokine regulator of this balance that, among other clinical and cytokine measures, stands
out as predictive of organ dysfunction and adverse outcomes
after CPB [2]. IL-18 acts with IL-12 in a synergistic fashion to
stimulate the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) from lymphocytes [3]. High serum levels of IL-18 are associated with
increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
[4] and decreased production of the anti-inflammatory

stay (6.8% for TT genotype versus 2.7% for GG or GT
genotype; p = 0.015). Patients homozygous for the T allele also
had increased occurrence of low systemic vascular resistance
index (62%) compared with the GG and GT genotypes (53%;
p = 0.045). Patients homozygous for the T allele had increased
serum IL-18 concentrations 24 hours post-surgery (p = 0.018),
increased pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor alpha
concentrations (p = 0.014) and decreased anti-inflammatory
serum IL-10 concentrations (p = 0.018) 24 hours post-surgery.

Conclusions The TT genotype of the IL-18 9545 T/G
polymorphism is associated with an increased occurrence of
prolonged ICU stay post-surgery and greater post-surgical
inflammation. These results may be explained by greater serum
IL-18, leading to greater pro-versus anti-inflammatory cytokine
expression.

cytokine IL-10 [5]. Serum levels of IL-18 increase in response
to CPB surgery [2] and in other inflammatory conditions such
as sepsis [6] and type 1 diabetes [7].
Inflammatory gene polymorphisms have been linked to the
intensity of the post-operative inflammatory response and to
clinical outcomes after CPB surgery [8]. Therefore, we postulated that IL-18 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
may be important in recovery from CPB surgery. Two polymorphic loci within the IL-18 gene have been investigated for
associations between genotype and serum concentrations of
IL-18 (intermediate phenotype) as well as associations
between genotype and clinical outcome (phenotype). The -

607 C/A and -137 G/C SNPs were initially discovered to influence promoter activity of the IL-18 gene [9]. The -137 C allele
has been associated with adverse outcomes and higher serum
IL-18 cytokine levels, and the -607 A allele has been associated with improved outcomes and lower serum IL-18 levels in
type 1 diabetes [3].
Our study design was based on the above observation that
increased serum IL-18 is associated with adverse outcomes
after CPB, including cardiovascular dysfunction [2], associated with increased serum TNF-α and decreased serum IL-10
[10]. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that IL-18 gene polymorphisms are associated with adverse outcome, as measured by prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU)
(primary clinical outcome) and cardiovascular dysfunction
(secondary clinical outcome). We then confirmed that the polymorphism is associated with increased serum concentrations
of IL-18 and altered serum concentrations of TNF-α and IL-10
post-CPB, thus providing a possible explanation for our clinical results.

Materials and methods
Patient cohort
All patients admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU of St Paul's
Hospital in Vancouver having elective CPB surgery between
February 2001 and December 2003 were eligible for entry
into this study. For inclusion, 890 were screened, of which
815 had CPB pump-driven circulation of blood during firsttime elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Of these, we
restricted our analyses to the 658 patients who were Caucasian in order to decrease the potentially confounding influence
of population admixture secondary to ethnic diversity on associations between genotype and phenotype. All 658 patients
were successfully genotyped for four polymorphisms in the IL18 gene and made up our final cohort for analysis.

Our Research Ethics Board approved analysis of fully anonymous data and, for DNA samples, collection of blood that was
being discarded as part of routine clinical care in a consecutive cohort of all patients meeting inclusion criteria and admitted to our cardiac surgical ICU. Using this fully anonymous
study design the Research Ethics Board of Providence Health
Care and the University of British Columbia approved this
study and waived informed consent.
Primary clinical phenotype
This cohort was confined to patients undergoing first-time
elective coronary artery bypass surgery, so a mortality rate
endpoint would be ineffective unless sample sizes were very
large. Many authors, therefore, use prolonged ICU stay as a
measure of adverse outcome [11,12]. Most recently, Nakasuji
and colleagues found that prolonged ICU stay of more than
three days was a sensitive and specific measure of adverse
outcome that reflected measures of cardiovascular and pulmonary organ failure [11]. Lawrence and colleagues found that

Page 2 of 8

the Parsonnet score with a maximum predictive efficiency was
a score of 10. Patients having a Parsonnet score of 0 to 9 had
a mean ICU stay of about 1.5 days, while those having a score
of 10 or more had a mean ICU stay of about three days [12].
Therefore, we used the proportion of patient having a postoperative ICU stay of greater than or equal to three days (72
hours) as our primary outcome variable. In our institution, the
decision to discharge patients from the ICU after CPB surgery
is protocol driven and genotype was unknown to care providers, making this measurement an unbiased outcome measurement for this study, particularly because genotype was fully
blinded and not measured until after complete clinical data
had been collected.
Secondary clinical phenotype
Kristof and Magder [13] identified low post-CPB systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) as a clinical manifestation of systemic inflammation. This vasodilatory syndrome is associated
with related parameters such as longer cross-clamp times and
lower post-CPB platelet count [13]. We used Kristof and
Magder's definition of two consecutive SVRI measurements
less than 1800 dyne.s/cm5/m2 (SVRI = ((MAP-CVP) × 80)/CI,
where MAP is the mean arterial pressure, CVP is the central
venous pressure and CI is the cardiac index) as a secondary
clinical phenotype.
Intermediate phenotype
Serum concentrations of cytokines are useful intermediate
phenotypes to test for biologically plausible explanations for
genotype – clinical phenotype associations. We measured
serum IL-18, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations in an overlapping subset of patients (n = 44) within the current cohort for
whom serum was available from a related observational study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort were identical.
In our own preliminary time course experiments we found that
serum IL-18 concentrations peaked at 24 hours post-CPB.
Therefore, we measured serum IL-18, TNF-α and IL-10 at this
post-operative time point. Serum IL-18 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN for IL-18; BD
PharMingen, San Diego, CA for TNF-α). Serum IL-10 was
measured using the Luminex bead-based bioassay system
(Luminex Corp, Austin, TX).
Tag single nucleotide polymorphism selection
To determine IL-18 gene haplotypes we used unphased genotype data from the University of Arizona's Innate Immunity
Program in Genomics Application website. We used PHASE
v 2.0 [14] to infer haplotype from unphased genotype data.
The resulting haplotypes were clustered into four groups of
similar haplotypes (clades) using the molecular evolutionary
genetic analysis software package MEGA2 [15]. The program
LDSelect [16] was used to select a set of maximally informative haplotype tag (ht) SNPs with the restriction that the literature SNPs -607 C/A and -137 G/C be included. Four htSNPs
were chosen to differentiate the four haplotype clades: -607

C/A (rs1946518), -137 G/C (rs187238), 8148 C/T
(rs360722) and 9545 T/G (rs5744249) (Figure 1).
Genotyping
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using a
QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc. Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada). SNP genotypes were determined using
the 5' nuclease, or Taqman PCR method (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA, USA) [17]. These htSNPs were then
genotyped in the 658 patients of our cohort undergoing CPB.

Statistics
Differences in continuous variables were assessed using Student's t-test for two groups or an analysis of variance for more
than two groups for normally distributed data, and a MannWhitney U Test or Kruskal-Wallis H Test for non-normally distributed data. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significant differences in discrete variables. Data are reported as
mean ± standard error (SE). A p ≤ 0.05 was taken to indicate
a significant difference. Analysis was performed using SPSS
v11.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Allele frequencies were
tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the test of Guo

and Thompson [18] and were all found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Work by Long and Langley [19] indicates that on the order of
500 individuals are sufficient to detect the presence of causative polymorphisms having small effect on outcomes. Thus, we
have included 658 individuals in our study population.

Results
Selection of the 9545 T/G SNP
Using PHASE, we found four main haplotypes occurring at a
frequency greater than 5% in our patient cohort based on the
four chosen htSNPs (Figure 1b). As an initial screen, we examined the occurrence of our primary clinical outcome (prolonged ICU stay) by PHASE-inferred haplotype in our study
cohort. We found haplotypes 1 to 3 were associated with
greater occurrence of prolonged ICU stay (Figure 2). Haplotypes 1 to 3 are uniquely tagged by the T allele of the 9545 T/
G polymorphism, so we focused on the 9545 T/G genotype
for further analyses. These data were best fit using a recessive
model (TT genotype compared to TG plus GG genotypes),
which was therefore used as the statistical analytic model
throughout the study. The TT genotype occurred in 58% of
patients. Genotypes of the 9545 T/G SNP were in Hardy
Weinberg equilibrium. No significant associations between
genotype and any clinical or intermediate phenotype were
observed for any of the three other htSNPs (data not shown).

homozygous for the T allele of the IL-18 9545 T/G SNP versus

patients with TT genotype, 28 kg/m2 for patients with GT genotype, 26 kg/m2 for patients with GG genotype, p = 0.022).
There were no significant differences by genotype in peri-operative management, including use of aprotinin (TT 15%,
GT+GG 10%, p = 0.10), amicar (TT 39%, GT+GG 38%, p =
0.99), or protamine (TT 0%, GT+GG 1%, p = 0.18) in our
study cohort. Similarly, there were no differences by genotype
in the use of vasodilators dobutamine (TT 71%, GT+GG 75%,
p = 0.25) or milrinone (TT 11%, GT+GG 13%, p = 0.47) in
the perioperative period. In addition there was no difference in
vasopressor use (receiving norepinephrine at 4, 12 and 24
hours: TT 7.8%, 5.2%, 2.1%, GT+GG 7.2%, 5.4%, 1.1%,
respectively).
Primary clinical phenotype
In our cohort of Caucasian patients who had CPB surgery,
patients homozygous for the T allele of the IL-18 9545 T/G
SNP had increased occurrence of prolonged ICU stay
(greater than 72 hours) after CPB surgery: 32 of 383 (8.4%)
for TT versus 10 of 275 (3.6%) for TG or GG (p = 0.015; Figure 3). The overall occurrence of prolonged ICU stay was 42
out of 658 patients (6.4%). These differences remained significant (p = 0.012) using logistic regression adjusted for age,
gender, duration of bypass and baseline organ function (ejection fraction, diabetes, renal dysfunction; Table 2). The sensitivity of the TT genotype to predict prolonged ICU stay is (or
true positive rate) 76% and the specificity (or true negative
rate) is 43%.
Secondary clinical phenotype
In these Caucasian patients undergoing elective on-pump coronary bypass graft surgery (CPB), those patients homozygous
for the T allele of the IL-18 9545 T/G SNP had increased frequency of two consecutive SVRI measurements less than
1800 dyne.s/cm5/m2. The TT genotype was associated with
the increased frequency of two SVRI measurements less than
1800 (62%) compared with the GT+GG genotypes (53%)
(Figure 3). These differences remained significant (p = 0.045)
using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender and duration of bypass (Table 3). The difference in SVRI was not
accounted for by differences in post-operative use of vasodilating inotropes or the vasopressor norepinephrine (above).
The fraction of patients having two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria at 24 hours was
24% in TT patients and 20.7% in GT+GG patients. The heart
rate component of SIRS scoring was significantly different
with TT patients having a heart rate at 24 hours of 78.4 ± 0.7
compared with 75.8 ± 0.7 for GT+GG patients (p = 0.016).
A trend to increased numbers of TT patients remaining on the
ventilator at 24 hours (TT 10.2%, GT+GG 8.3%), increased
numbers of patients having a rise in creatinine of more than 50
μmol/L at 24 hours (TT 4.1%, GT+GG 2.5%) and increased
mortality (TT 1.8%, GT+GG 1.1%) was observed, although

Discussion
We have identified an association between the TT genotype of
the novel 9545 T/G polymorphism of the IL-18 gene and
adverse outcome after CPB surgery. The TT genotype was
found to be associated with increased occurrence of prolonged ICU stay and of two consecutive SVRI measurements
less than 1800 dyne.s/cm5/m2. A biologically plausible explanation for these findings is that the TT genotype of the 9545
T/G htSNP was also associated with higher serum concentration of IL-18, higher serum TNF-α concentration and lower
serum concentration of IL-10 in our cardiac surgical population. Prolonged ICU stay is reported to be correlated with risk
factors for poor outcome after CPB surgery [11]. Low systemic vascular resistance, defined as two consecutive SVRI
measurements less that 1800 dyne.s/cm5/m2, is a marker of
poor vascular tone after CPB, related to the systemic inflammatory response [13]. Greater serum concentrations of IL-18
[2] and TNF-α [1] and lower serum levels of IL-10 [1] have
been associated with increased prevalence of complications
after CPB, and may be indicative of a prominent pro-inflammatory state.

Production of humoral inflammatory mediators and priming of
neutrophils by exposure to the CPB apparatus enables a
'post-pump' syndrome characterised by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and its anti-inflammatory counterpart,
termed the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome [20]. IL-18 plays a central role in regulating and balancing these responses. IL-18 regulates the expression of the
potent pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators TNF-α [4] and IL10 [5]. In accord with this, we found that the TT genotype was
associated with an increased serum IL-18 concentration and
also with increased serum TNF-α and decreased serum IL-10.
The increased serum TNF-α and decreased serum IL-10 levels
are associated with increased organ dysfunction [10]. Therefore, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the IL18 9545 TT genotype leads to increased production of serum
IL-18, subsequently leading to increased serum TNF-α and
decreased serum IL-10, causing increased organ dysfunction
and increased occurrence of prolonged ICU stay.
Polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene have been studied for association with inflammatory conditions such as type 1 diabetes
[3] and sepsis [21]. The -607 C/A and -137 G/C promoter

SNPs have been found to be associated with a susceptibility
to type 1 diabetes such that the C allele of -137 was found to
be a risk allele and the A allele of -607 was found to be a protective allele [3]. Polymorphisms in the IL-18 gene have also
been associated with alterations in serum concentrations of IL18 [22]. None of the previous literature reports an association
between the 9545 T/G SNP and outcomes, or between this
SNP and serum cytokine levels. The previous SNPs, -607 C/
A and -137 G/C are not in significant linkage disequilibrium
with the 9545 T/G SNP (Figure 1). Neither of these previously
reported SNPs were in association with our primary or secondary clinical or intermediate phenotypes.
The 9545 T/G SNP of the IL-18 gene is located within intron
2 and therefore may not be the causal SNP with regard to clinical outcomes or intermediate phenotypes. Strong linkage disequilibrium exists between the 9545 T/G SNP and several
other SNPs within the IL-18 gene (Figure 1): -2163 C/A
(rs5744222) in the promoter; 790 G/T (n/a) and 8936 A/G
(rs4988359) in intron 1; 11024 G/C (rs1834481), 12003 T/
C (rs5744256) and 13084 G/C (rs5744258) in intron 3; and
17980 G/C (rs5744276) in intron 5. Promoter SNPs are likely
to have an effect by disrupting or creating binding sites for
transcription factors, thus altering levels of intracellular transcript and/or extracellular protein [23]. The -2163 C/A SNP,
however, is not found to be located within a putative transcription factor binding site, nor does the rare allele create one,
based on a scan of the promoter region of the IL-18 gene
using TESS (transcriptional element search software). Intronic
SNPs can affect splicing of the pre-mRNA, resulting in alternative splice variants of proteins; however, most intronic SNPs
thought to have these effects are observed to lie within about
20 bp of intron/exon boundaries [24]. The 9545 T/G SNP

itself does not lie so close to such a boundary, nor do any of
the SNPs in LD with 9545 mentioned above. Linkage disequilibrium can carry over the putative gene boundary, and may
allow the 9545 T/G SNP to be tightly correlated with a causal
SNP up- or downstream of the IL-18 gene, one which may
have a causal effect on clinical and intermediate phenotypes.
Haplotypes represent a powerful method of selecting SNPs
for genotyping based on linkage disequilibrium. The IL-18
gene has 56 polymorphic loci in Caucasians according to
sequencing data from the University of Arizona's Innate Immunity Program in Genomic Applications website. The SNPs at
positions -607 and -137 relative to the start of translation are
literature SNPs, and so make good choices for genotyping in
an inflammatory-related population such as CPB patients. The
positions 8148 and 9545 are not previously reported SNPs,
however, and so would not have been chosen for genotyping
without some method of selecting SNPs. By selecting htSNPs
to maximise information while minimising the number of SNPs
to be genotyped, we have queried the underlying haplotype
structure while using relatively few polymorphic loci. Although
this marker-style approach to disease association is useful, it
does not address mechanism or functionality of the polymorphism itself.
Our study has several strengths. The use of haplotypes to
choose htSNPs has the benefit of not being restricted to literature SNPs for disease association studies. The large sample
size allows for statistical power to detect associations of modest effect and the limitation of sampling to Caucasians patients
reduces the likelihood of type I error due to population admixture.
One of the main weaknesses of our study design is that we do
not identify the causative SNP for worse clinical outcome after
CPB. Linkage disequilibrium existing within and possibly
beyond the IL-18 gene suggests that polymorphic loci in linkage disequilibrium with the T allele of the 9545 T/G SNP could
contribute to detrimental effects after CPB surgery. We have
limited our study to a single cohort; therefore this arising
hypothesis should be tested in other cohorts to ensure reproducibility.

Conclusions
In the present study the TT genotype of a novel polymorphism
of the IL-18 gene, 9545 T/G, was associated with greater
occurrence of prolonged ICU stay after CPB surgery, greater
frequency of low SVRI (two consecutive SVRI measurements
< 1800 dyne.s/cm5/m2), higher serum concentrations of
cytokine IL-18, higher serum concentrations of the cytokine
TNF-α and lower serum concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These widely varied markers of intensity of
recovery post-CPB indicate this genotype is potentially a risk
factor for patients undergoing CPB surgery.

Key messages

7.

•

The TT genotype of the IL-18 9545 T/G polymorphism
is associated with an increased occurrence of prolonged stay in the ICU post-surgery.

8.

•

The same genotype was associated with increased IL18 levels.

•

The increase in IL-18 levels associated with the TT genotype appeared to result in increased pro-inflammatory
TNF-α levels and decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels; TNF-α and IL-10 having previously been shown to
be regulated by IL-18 in this way.

•

The pro-inflammatory balance (as indicated by
increased TNF-α and decreased IL-10) may account for
the adverse clinical outcomes associated with the TT
genotype post surgery.
