Abstract
Background: Comparative sequencing studies among a wide range of taxonomic groups, including
fungi, have led to the discovery that reproductive genes evolve more rapidly than other genes.
However, for fungal reproductive genes the question has remained whether the rapid evolution is
a result of stochastic or deterministic processes. The mating-type (mat) genes constitute the
master regulators of sexual reproduction in filamentous ascomycetes and here we present a study
of the molecular evolution of the four mat-genes (mat a-1, mat A-1, mat A-2 and mat A-3) of 20
Neurospora taxa.
Results: We estimated nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates of genes to infer their
evolutionary rate, and confirmed that the mat-genes evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the evolutionary
trajectories are related to the reproductive modes of the taxa; likelihood methods revealed that
positive selection acting on specific codons drives the diversity in heterothallic taxa, while among
homothallic taxa the rapid evolution is due to a lack of selective constraint. The latter finding is
supported by presence of stop codons and frame shift mutations disrupting the open reading
frames of mat a-1, mat A-2 and mat A-3 in homothallic taxa. Lower selective constraints of matgenes was found among homothallic than heterothallic taxa, and comparisons with nonreproductive genes argue that this disparity is not a nonspecific, genome-wide phenomenon.
Conclusion: Our data show that the mat-genes evolve rapidly in Neurospora. The rapid divergence
is due to either adaptive evolution or lack of selective constraints, depending on the reproductive
mode of the taxa. This is the first instance of positive selection acting on reproductive genes in the
fungal kingdom, and illustrates how the evolutionary trajectory of reproductive genes can change
after a switch in reproductive behaviour of an organism.

Background
Rapidly evolving genes are those with a higher than average percentage of amino-acid substitutions between species. Rapid evolution may be due to adaptive evolution,

which occurs when natural selection promotes aminoacid divergence. Alternatively, rapid evolution may be due
to a lack of functional constraint; for example, a pseudog-

ene rapidly accumulates mutations because of an absence
of purifying selection.
Comparative sequencing studies among a wide range of
taxonomic groups have led to the discovery that reproductive genes evolve more rapidly than other genes. In animals, essentially all steps in fertilization where the genes
have been identified there is evidence of rapid divergence,
and numerous reports of positively selected animal reproductive genes exist [1]. In contrast, in plants and fungi the
selective forces driving reproductive gene diversity, and
the functional consequences of reproductive gene evolution, are just beginning to be understood. In filamentous
ascomycetes, comparatively low levels of between species
nucleotide identity have been observed for mating-type
genes, which constitute the master-regulators of sexual
reproduction in this group of fungi [2]. Consequently
these genes have been suggested to evolve at a faster rate
than genes coding for e.g. metabolic enzymes [2-4],
although the question has remained whether the rapid
evolution is a result of stochastic or deterministic processes.
Many fungi have both asexual and sexual stages as a part
of their life cycle. Their sexual mating systems are classified as either heterothallic or homothallic. In heterothallic
fungi, strains must be of opposite mating type for sexual
reproduction and morphogenesis, while homothallic species, generally thought to evolve from heterothallic ancestors [[5] and references therein], reproduce sexually
without a mating partner. In all heterothallic filamentous
ascomycetes examined to date, the mat locus is the sole
determinant of mating type, and sexual development in
heterothallic taxa is regulated by alternative mat A or mat
a genes at this locus. Alternate sequences at mat, denoted
idiomorphs [6], lack significant sequence similarity and
encode different transcriptional regulators [7-10]. Genetic
analyses of the model species Neurospora crassa have identified one open reading frame (ORF) in the mat a idiomorph (mat a-1) as the major mating regulator in mat a
strains [8]. The mat A idiomorph contains three genes, one
of which is the main regulator of sexual development in
mat A strains (mat A-1) [7,11]. While MAT A-1 and MAT
a-1 constitute the critical factors for both mating and sexual development in N. crassa, MAT A-2 and MAT A-3 are
suggested to increase the efficiency of the process [12].
In contrast to many yeast species [13], filamentous ascomycetes of either mating type are unable to switch to the
opposite mating type. Nevertheless, it has been suggested
that conversion from heterothallic to homothallic mode
in filamentous ascomycetes resides within the mat locus,
and that homothallic species carry both idiomorphs in a
single thallus [14]. In so called pseudohomothallic species, represented in this study by Neurospora tetrasperma,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

two haploid nuclei of opposite mating-type (mat a and
mat A) are maintained in each heterokaryotic ascospore
progeny and vegetative cell, while in true homothallic
species mat-genes from both idiomorphs are found within
a single haploid genome. The structure of the mating type
genes in homothallic Neurospora has not been determined
in detail; however, hybridizations using cloned portions
of the idiomorphs of N. crassa to the genome of related
homothallic taxa have revealed three classes of homothallic taxa (Figure 1). The haploid genomes of one group
contain both mat a and mat A sequences [15]. Another distinct group consists of taxa containing the entire mat A
sequence, while the mat a-1 gene is absent [16,17].
Finally, the hybridization patterns of the homothallic N.
terricola provide evidence for the presence of mat a-1, mat
A-1 and mat A-2 sequences, but it appears to lack parts of
the A-idiomorphic region corresponding to the mat A-3
region [15].
Here we present the first, to our knowledge, extensive
study of molecular evolution of fungal mating-type genes
in relation to reproductive strategy. We sequenced the
four mat-genes of Neurospora and Gelasinospora taxa, which
we for simplicity refer to as Neurospora in this study. In
addition, for comparative purposes we sequenced parts of
three genes with function assumed to be independent of
reproductive mode of fungi; encoding actin (act), translational elongation factor EF-1 alpha (tef-1) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ccg-7). We confirm
that the mat-genes evolve rapidly in this group of fungi
and show that the evolutionary trajectory of each of the
mat-genes is specifically related to the reproductive modes
of the taxa; positive selection drives mat-gene diversity in
heterothallic taxa, while the rapid evolution is due to a
lack of selective constraint among homothallic taxa.

Results
Sequence analysis of mat a-1
Amplification products and sequences of mat a-1, originally described by Staben and Yanofsky [8], were successfully obtained from all investigated heterothallic strains of
mating type a (mat a strains), and from all homothallic
strains except N. africana, N. galapagosensis, N. dodgei and
N. lineolata, thus confirming a previous report [17], suggesting that these four homothallic taxa lack the mat a-1
ORF. Taken together, mat a-1 was sequenced from twelve
heterothallic and five homothallic strains, and the alignments of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene
are shown in Supplemental Figure S1 (Additional file 1).
Several differences were found when comparing genomic
and cDNA sequences of strain FGSC #4200 with the originally published N. crassa sequence of the same strain [8].
The most striking difference was an additional cytosine
found downstream from the conserved, DNA binding
domain of the high mobility group (HMG), at nucleotide

position 1074, resulting in a shift in the ORF at amino
acid position 359. Reading the resulting sequence until
the first stop-codon results in a 438 amino acid MAT a-1
polypeptide in N. crassa instead of 381, as was originally
suggested by Staben and Yanofsky [8]. Consequently, the
C-terminal part of the protein is different from that of the
previously reported MAT a-1 protein. This feature of FGSC
#4200 was consistently found in all strains analyzed, supporting our revised description of mat a-1.
The size of the ORF of mat a-1 was found to be identical
in all heterothallic taxa included in this study, and only a
few amino acid substitutions were found. However, this
was not the case among the six homothallic taxa, especially in the C-terminal part in which insertions and deletions of amino acids were found. In three of the
homothallic taxa, N. pannonica, N. terricola and G.
calospora, sequencing of both genomic and cDNA revealed
disrupted mat a-1 ORFs (Figure 1). First, N. pannonica was
found to lack a 125 bp region in the third exon (nucleotide position 826 to 965, Supplemental Figure S1 (Additional file 1)) located between two stretches of cytosine
nucleotides conserved in the other taxa. This deletion in
N. pannonica results in a frame shift introducing a premature stop codon 25 amino acids downstream of the deletion. In N. terricola, a stop codon was found at position
308 and in G. calospora an inserted adenosine that results
in a frame shift at amino acid position 438 was found,
although the HMG-box remained intact. Taken together,
these data show that only two of the homothallic taxa
included in this study possess a mat a-1 gene that is not
modified.
Sequence analyses of mat A-1
Amplification products and sequences of mat A-1 were
successfully obtained from the 12 heterothallic mat A and
the nine homothallic strains investigated here. The alignments of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mat A-1
are shown in Supplemental Figure S1 (Additional file 1).
We confirmed the 293 amino-acid mat A-1 sequence of
reference strain FGSC# 2489 of N. crassa, originally published by Glass et al. 1990 [7], including a DNA-binding
α1 domain showing similarity to the α1 transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [7]. All other strains
included here, however, differed from strain FGSC# 2489
in that amino acids at positions 32 and 33 were found to
be lacking. With the exception of this difference, and a
premature stop codon found in the heterothallic taxon
phylogenetic species 1 (PS1) resulting in a truncated protein lacking the last three amino acids, the length of the
ORF of mat A-1 was identical among all heterothallic and
homothallic strains investigated here.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

Sequence analysis of mat A-2
The mat A-2 ORF was successfully amplified and
sequenced from all investigated heterothallic mat A strains
and the homothallic strains. The nucleotide and amino
acid alignments of the gene are shown in Supplemental
Figure S1 (Additional file 1), and confirmed the presence
of a DNA-binding, acidic amphipathic α-helix (HPGdomain) [11]. A number of differences were found when
comparing the sequence of genomic DNA and cDNA from
strain FGSC #2489 with the originally published sequence
of the same strain [11], and these were also found in all
the other strains analyzed, indicating sequencing errors in
the original submission.

N. intermedia (both subgroups NiA and NiB) and N. crassa
(NcC) were found to lack the start codon of mat A-2. No
alternative start-codon was found when investigating 40
bp of the upstream sequence, but another methionine was
found at aa-position 6 in both these taxa, which may serve
as an alternative start-codon. This pattern was confirmed
for additional strains of N. intermedia (NiA: FGSC# 8844)
and N. crassa (NcC: FGSC#8865) (data not shown). With
these exceptions, the size of the mat A-2 ORF is identical
among the heterothallic taxa. However, among the
homothallic taxa, the size of the mat A-2 ORF is not conserved. Deletions of up to 6 amino acids are found in G.
cerealis, G. calospora and N. sublineolata, and, more importantly, in N. dodgei, N. africana, and N. galapagosensis the
mat A-2 ORF is disrupted by a stop codon (Figure 1). In N.
dodgei, the stop occurred at codon 39, while in N. africana
and N. galapagosensis, the stop was found at codon 288. By
sequencing mat A-2 from cDNA of N. dodgei and N. galapagosensis we confirmed the structure of the ORF in these
strains. However, in spite of several independent trials, we
failed to amplify mat A-2 from cDNA of N. africana (data
not shown).
Sequence analysis of mat A-3
We successfully amplified and sequenced mat A-3 from all
investigated mat A and homothallic strains, except N. terricola, in which this gene previously has been indicated to
be absent [15]. The nucleotide and amino acid alignment
of mat A-3 is shown in Supplemental Figure S1 (Additional file 1), and shows the presence of an HMG-box.
When comparing our DNA sequence obtained from
genomic and cDNA of strain FGSC# 2489 of N. crassa with
the original published mat A-3 sequence of this strain
[11], we found only one silent nucleotide difference. This
difference was found in all other strains analyzed here,
supporting our revised description of mat A-3.

The length of the ORF was found to be intact in all taxa
studied here, except for the homothallic taxa N. africana,
N. galapagosensis, N. dodgei and N. lineolata. Sequencing of
both genomic and cDNA from these four taxa revealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

that amino acids 100–177 have been deleted in N. africana and N. galapagosensis, a region spanning the first half
of the HMG-box. In N. dodgei, no start codon was found,
although a methionine was found after 30 amino acids,
which might serve as a start codon for mat A-3 in this
taxon. Finally, N. lineolata has a stop-codon at position
215 (Supplemental Figure S1, Additional file 1).

1) lists likelihood ratio statistics and parameter estimates
for the four mat-genes, and three genes which function is
assumed to be independent of reproductive mode of a
fungus; act, tef-1 and ccg-7 [20-22]. The Bayes Empirical
Bayes (BEB) probabilities for each codon of the mat-genes
to fit into one of the three classes of sites obtained by running the positive-selection model are shown in Figure 3.

Evolutionary pattern among sites
Figure 2 shows the synonymous substitution rate (dS) for
mat- and non-reproductive genes of the heterothallic and
homothallic datasets, obtained through pairwise comparisons between taxa in all possible combinations. We
found that dS did not differ significantly between mat- and
non-reproductive genes within each reproductive class.
Furthermore, we found that the synonymous substitution
rate of the mat-genes did not differ between heterothallic
and homothallic taxa, while for the non-reproductive
genes we found a significantly higher dS in the homothallic as compared to the heterothallic dataset (P = 0.05,
Mann-Whitney U-test).

We found a higher ω among mat-genes than among nonreproductive genes (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). Given an
equal synonymous substitution rate between mat and
non-reproductive genes within each reproductive class
(Figure 2), this finding indicates that mat-genes evolve
faster than the non-reproductive genes. Furthermore, all
four mat-genes were found to evolve faster among the
homothallic than the heterothallic taxa; although the synonymous substitution rate of the mat-genes was equal
among these groups, the averaged value of ω for each matgene, obtained using the one-ratio model implemented in
PAML version 3.14, was higher in the homothallic compared to the heterothallic dataset (0.385 versus 0.144 for
mat a-1, 0.487 versus 0.233 for mat A-1, 0.581 versus
0.386 for mat A-2 and 0.427 versus 0.316 for mat A-3; P <
0.001, Fisher exact tests). This pattern was also found for
the tef-1 gene, for which we found a ω of 0.133 in the
homothallic dataset as compared to 0.017 for the heterothallics. In contrast, the ω between homothallic and heterothallic dataset did not differ for the act or the ccg-7
genes. For the act-gene we estimated ω of 0 for both datasets and for ccg-7 we found ω of 0.102 versus 0.097 for the
heterothallic and homothallic datasets, respectively.

Six models of variable ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) to
synonymous substitution rates (dS), ω, among gene
codons (site models outlined by Nielsen and Yang [18]
and implemented in PAML version 3.14 [19]) were used
to investigate the evolutionary constraints acting on each
gene. Detailed descriptions of the models are given in the
Methods section. Supplemental Table S1 (Additional file

Mat a-1 was found to be the most conserved mat-gene in
both datasets, with lowest average ω ratios. Although ω
was smaller in the heterothallic than the homothallic
dataset, mat a-1 was found to evolve under positive selection among the heterothallic taxa (i.e. both models allowing for sites with ω > 1 fitted the data significantly better
than the corresponding neutral model, P < 0.05). Bayes
empirical Bayes (BEB) calculations for posterior probabilities of sites belonging to site classes revealed two codons,
codon 7 and 43, with a posterior probability > 0.95 to
belong to the class with ω > 1, using both the positiveselection and the beta&ω model (Figure 3a).

each other (P = 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test).

The sites of mat a-1 showing an elevated ω were not identical between the heterothallic and homothallic datasets
(Figure 3a, b). The second exon was found to be extremely
conserved among the heterothallic taxa, and codes for a
DNA binding HMG-domain. The PRPPNAYILYRK motif
suggested by Staben & Yanofsky [8] to be functionally
important for mating, based on conservation between
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and N. crassa, was found to be
completely conserved in both heterothallic and homothallic taxa possessing this gene, but variation was found

within the other part of the HMG-box for both groups of
taxa (Figure 3a, b).
For mat A-1, the neutral models of evolution fitted the
data equally well as the models of positive selection. The
rapidly evolving sites in the heterothallic dataset were
clustered into domains, e.g. in the C-terminal end of mat
A-1 we found a stretch of adjacent rapidly evolving sites,
including one site with a BEB posterior probability of P >
0.95 to belong to a class with ω > 1, while the α1-box was
found to be conserved (Figure 3c). This was in contrast to
the homothallic dataset in which the rapidly evolving
sites are more evenly distributed along the gene (Figure
3d).
In mat A-2 we found the most pronounced difference
between the heterothallic and homothallic dataset. In the
heterothallic dataset, mat A-2 was found to evolve under
positive selection. BEB calculations of posterior probabilities revealed seven sites with P > 0.95 to belong to the
class with ω > 1 using the positive-selection and the
beta&ω model (Figure 3e). This was very different from
the homothallics in which a large proportion of sites were
found to evolve neutrally; more than half of the codons
were found in a class with ω = 1.011 using the discrete
model. Noteworthy, the discrete model fitted the data significantly better than the one-ratio model for all datasets
except the mat A-2 of the homothallics, for which the oneratio model with a ω of all codons of 0.581 fitted equally
well. The HPG-domain that was previously suggested to
be conserved among euascomycetes [14] was found to be
conserved in our heterothallic dataset, except for three
rapidly evolving sites. However, the HPG-domain is not
conserved in the homothallic dataset (Figure 3e, f).
In mat A-3, the smallest difference in average ω between
the heterothallics and the homothallics was observed.
Similarly to mat a-1, and in contrast to the observations at
mat A-1 and mat A-2, when using the discrete model no
codons were found in a class with ω ≈ 1 in the homothallic dataset for mat A-3. The HMG domain was more conserved in the heterothallic than in the homothallic taxa.
However, the one site found to be in a class with P > 0.95
of positive selection (site 205) in the heterothallics was
located within this domain.
The investigated region of the act-gene was found to be
extremely conserved in both datasets. This was also the
case for all codons of tef-1 for the heterothallic dataset,
while a small proportion (3.3%) of the sites of this gene
was found to evolve under positive selection among
homothallic taxa (i.e. found in a class with ω of 6.062
using both the discrete and positive selection model: Supplemental Table S1 (Additional file 1)). For both of these
genes, no neutrally evolving codons were identified in any

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

of the datasets. For the ccg-7 gene the majority (> 90%) of
the sequenced codons are conserved in both datasets,
however, a small proportion of the codons was found in
a class with ω of 1.6 in the heterothallic dataset and 1.175
in the homothallic dataset, under the discrete model
(Supplemental Table S1, Additional file 1).

Discussion
In this study we confirm that the mat-genes evolve rapidly
in Neurospora, and show that the rapid divergence is due
to either adaptive evolution or lack of selective constraint,
depending on the reproductive mode of taxa.
A lower overall value of ω was found for the mat-genes
among heterothallic as compared to homothallic taxa.
Nevertheless, the two mating type genes mat a-1 and mat
A-2 were found to evolve under positive selection in heterothallic taxa. Although a high between-taxa nucleotide
divergence of reproductive genes in fungi has been
observed previously [2-4], this is the first evidence of positive selection of reproductive genes in this kingdom. The
finding fits directly with patterns observed for animal
reproductive genes, in which essentially all identified
genes are characterized by high levels of nonsynonymous
divergence and positive selection [1,23,24]. None of the
positively selected sites were found within the regions
encoding known functional domains of the genes, and
the biological significance of alterations at the positively
selected sites is unknown. MAT a-1 and its orthologs in
other filamentous ascomycetes are characterized by a conserved region similar to motifs found in several DNA
binding proteins of the high mobility group (HMG), and
has been shown to bind to DNA in in vitro assays [25]. Mat
a-1 is one of the master genes regulating fertilization in
mat a strains of Neurospora, as well as in other species [14].
During the initial phase of mating in heterothallic Neurospora, the trichogynes (female receptive hyphae) grow
toward and fuse with male cells of the opposite mating
type, and the directed growth is mediated by chemotropic
communication between mat-regulated pheromones diffused from male cells and their corresponding receptors
on the trichogynes. Competition between individuals
could potentially drive adaptation of mat-genes, as indirectly involved in localization of, binding to and fusion
between trichogyne and conidia of opposite mating types.
An alternative hypothesis would be that the signature of
positive selection observed in heterothallic mat a-1 and
mat A-2 could be related to mating type associated vegetative incompatibility, rather than sexual development. Vegetative incompatibility genes are highly variable, and
some have been shown to evolve in a diversifying manner
[26].
Our result of mat a-1 in heterothallic taxa confirms previous reports suggesting that an intact HMG domain and

the presence of a C-terminal tail, although non-specific,
are required for mating [25,27]; at least the first part of the
HMG-domain is under strong purifying selection among
heterothallic taxa, while lower levels of conservation are
found in the C-terminal tail (Figure 3a). The finding that
a group of closely related homothallic taxa lack mat a-1
indicate that this gene is not essential for completion of
the homothallic sexual cycle, and it is possible that this
function of mat a-1 is redundant with another gene in the
genomes of this group of taxa. The premature stop codons
in mat a-1 in the homothallic N. pannonica and N. terricola
indicate that this gene may not be required for completing
the sexual cycle in a wider range of homothallic taxa.
However, in these two taxa the stop codons are found distal to the HMG box, and functional assays have to be performed to verify this hypothesis.
The MAT A-1 protein is characterized by the presence of an
α1 domain showing similarity to the α1 transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [7]. Mat A-1 is present in all
homothallic taxa investigated here, and the only gene in
which the ORF is intact in all homothallic taxa, suggesting
the possibility that only the α1 transcription factor is
essential to promote sexual development. This scenario
would mimic the situation in Cryptococcus neoformans,
where recent findings show sexual reproduction between
isolates with the same mating type [28]. The allele from N.
africana has been shown previously to function as a mating activator and to confer mating type-associated vegetative incompatibility in N. crassa [29] indicating
conservation of both these functions in mat A-1 also in
homothallic Neurospora. Nevertheless, we found a large
proportion of evenly distributed neutrally evolving sites
in the homothallic taxa, even in the α1-box that is conserved among the heterothallic taxa, indicating lower
selective constraints on this gene in homothallic taxa.
Mat A-2 encodes a protein containing an acidic amphipathic α-helix and is unique to filamentous ascomycetes. It
is suggested to not be involved in fertilization, but to function in concert with the other MAT A polypeptides to regulate the expression of genes necessary for postfertilization events [11,12], and the positive selection at
this gene among heterothallic taxa could possibly be coupled to its role in recognition of opposite mating-type
nuclei during sexual development.
The MAT A-3 (and MAT a-1) HMG-domain is a DNAbinding motif found in non-histone chromosomal proteins and transcription factors. In Neurospora, examples of
homothallic taxa lacking either mat A-3 or mat a-1 are
found, and although the structure of the HMG-domain
differ between the genes [14] it has been proposed that
the loss of mat a-1 or mat A-3 is compensated by the
remaining HMG encoding gene [30]. N. terricola, which is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

the only homothallic taxa included here that lacks mat A3, has a stop codon disrupting the ORF in mat a-1, suggesting that this protein does not function correctly in this
taxon, and we have no indications of directional selection
in the N. terricola mat a-1 gene to change function. Furthermore, two of the four taxa lacking the mat a-1 gene, N.
africana and N. galapagosensis, also lack the first half of the
MAT A-3 HMG-domain. Thus, we are not able to provide
any support for the hypothesis that the essential functions
of the lost mat A-3 or mat a-1 are compensated by the
remaining HMG encoding gene in Neurospora.
In addition to the mat-genes, tef-1 also shows a higher ω
among homothallic taxa as compared to heterothallic,
and this result implies that the evolution of this gene is
also dependent of reproductive mode of the fungi. Interestingly, this elevated ω is due to a small proportion of
positively selected sites among the homothallic taxa. At
this point, we have no explanation for the observation,
but it implies that tef-1 is involved in sexual development
in Neurospora, or that it is affected by genetic linkage
through a close physical proximity to the mat locus [31].
In contrast to the heterothallic taxa, rapid evolution of
mat-genes in homothallic Neurospora is caused by genetic
decay. Instead of being conserved, the mat-genes in
homothallic Neurospora evolve under relaxed selective
constraints. This is evident from a higher proportion of
neutrally evolving codons among the homothallics as
well as observations of a disrupted ORF in three of the
four mat-genes in homothallic taxa. Comparisons with
non-reproductive genes argue that this disparity is matspecific, and not a nonspecific, genome-wide, phenomenon. The observations here provide a parallel to the observations of ecotypes with additional loss-of-function
mutations at one or more SI-modifier genes after the evolutionary switch to autogamy in the Arabidopsis thaliana
lineage [32], but is the first time low selective constraints
of reproductive proteins associated with the switch to
homothallism has been reported from fungi.
Our results indicate that we observe an early stage of
degeneration of mat-genes in homothallic Neurospora.
With the exception of mat A-2 in N. africana, we found
that all genes are expressed in homothallic taxa despite
frame shifts and stop codons, and the DNA sequences
downstream of the disruptions are relatively conserved.
This short degeneration time of the mat-genes in homothallic taxa might explain the results where the alterations in
the N. africana mat A-1 are not sufficient to abolish its
functions when assayed in a heterothallic relative [29].
Furthermore, the observation that they have not yet
become pseudogenes, in the sense that they do not exhibit
degenerative features that prevent their expression [33],
indicates a low cost associated with their expression.

The results presented here indicate that once a Neurospora
switches reproductive mode from heterothallic to
homothallic, it expresses low selective pressure for maintenance of functional mat-genes. This finding, together
with the observation that both heterothallic counterparts
of the mat-genes are not required for sexual development
in certain taxa [15,17], implies that within homothallic
Neurospora, activation of sexual reproduction can be independent of mat a/A interaction. In other filamentous ascomycetes conversion from heterothallic to homothallic
mode evidently resides within the mat locus [5] and both
idiomorphic counterparts of heterothallic mat-genes are
required for homothallic sexual development. In these
taxa, the function of mat-genes has been conserved [34].
This study indicates that the transition to homothallism
in Neurospora may represent a different paradigm. The
exact nature of this difference is not known, but it would
involve differences downstream of mat a/A interaction.
If functional mating-type genes are essential for outcrossing in the homothallics, the observed genetic decay may
lead to a progressive loss of outcrossing functions and
ultimately, to asexuality. However, alternative ways of
outcrossing, independent of mat-genes may be possible,
as expression of pheromones and receptors can be
detected in some strains deleted for the mat locus [35].
Furthermore, it is possible for strains to bypass the need
for fertilization by the formation of heterokaryons, which
may lead to outcrossing, as done routinely in the laboratory with the homothallic Aspergillus nidulans [36].

Conclusion
In this study we show that the mat-genes evolve rapidly in
Neurospora, and that the rapid divergence is due to either
adaptive evolution or lack of selective constraint, depending on the reproductive mode of taxa. In heterothallic
Neurospora, the mat-genes evolve in an adaptive manner
while once a Neurospora switches reproductive mode from
heterothallic to homothallic there is a low selective advantage for maintenance of functional mat-genes. To our
knowledge, this is the first example showing that the evolutionary trajectory of reproductive proteins changes after
a switch in reproductive behaviour of an organism.

Methods
Fungal material
Thirty-four strains belonging to 21 taxa of Neurospora and
Gelasinospora were used in this study (Table 1). Recent
studies show that these two genera are closely related and
not reciprocally monophyletic [37-39]. Therefore we
include homothallic taxa of both genera in this study, and
for simplicity refer to all of them as Neurospora. The strains
were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center
(University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/109

Nucleic acid extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA)
construction
Strains were grown in minimal medium broth [40] with
1% sucrose for 3 days at 37°C, after which nucleic acids
were extracted as described previously [41]. Total RNA
was treated with DNase I according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada). cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription using
an oligo(dT) primer (5'-T25VN-3') and Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers instructions.
Selection of loci
The entire coding regions of the four mat-genes, and partial coding regions of three additional genes; encoding
actin (act: 767 bp) [22], translational elongation factor
EF-1 alpha (tef-1: 834 bp) [20] and glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (ccg-7: 753 bp) [21], were
investigated in this study. Act, tef-1 and ccg-7 were
included for comparative purposes, and selected to represent genes which function is independent of reproductive
mode of a fungus. As both physical proximity and expression levels can have an effect on evolutionary rate [42,43],
these genes were selected to be located on different chromosomes, and expression levels of tef-1 and ccg-7 have
been shown to vary between different treatments [20,21].
PCR amplification
All included loci were amplified from one selected strain
per taxa. Published sequences for mat a, mat A, act, tef-1
and ccg-7 of N. crassa were used as templates for each gene
when designing primers. For isolates where amplification
of mat A-3 was not possible using primers based on the N.
crassa gene sequence, a primer walking sequencing strategy was used for searching the N. crassa genome sequence
[31] for conserved region upstream from mat A-3. All
primer sequences and GenBank accession numbers of reference sequences are given as Supplemental Table S2
(Additional file 1). PCR was performed with 1.55 U ThermoWhite Taq DNA polymerase (Saveen & Werner, Limhamn, Sweden) on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
DNA sequencing
The PCR products were purified using a PCR purification
kit (QIAquick, Qiagen) and sequencing was performed by
Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea, utilizing ABI 3730 XL automated sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Raw sequence data was analyzed using the Sequencher
4.1.4 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI)
and BioEdit version 7.0.5.2 [44].

3Analyzed

Codon-based likelihood analyses
Likelihood-based tests were used to investigate the nature
of evolutionary pressure acting on the mat-genes in Neurospora, using the CODEML program of the PAML version
3.14 package [19,45]. All analyses were carried out using
separate datasets consisting of the heterothallic or
homothallic taxa, as well as a dataset containing both hetero- and homothallics. For each model, equilibrium
codon frequencies were estimated from the average nucleotide frequencies at each codon position, amino acid distances were assumed to be equal, and the transition/
transversion ratio (κ) was estimated from the data. For all
other parameters, we use the default settings provided by
Yang et al. [46]. We assumed linkage between collinear
sites. The tree structure file used as input file in PAML was:

(((G_calospora,
N_sublineolata),
G_tetrasperma),((N_africana,
N_galapagosensis),
N_dodgei,
N_lineolata),
G_cerealis,
N_terricola,
N_pannonica,((((((((N_crassaA, N_crassaB), N_crassaC),

N_sitophila),

N_discreta)); shown in Figure 1 and constructed based on
the topology obtained from previous reports where neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony and bayesian methods
were used to construct species-phylogenies based on multiple loci [37-39,47]. We assume the true evolutionary history of the genes under study is the same as the history of
the species. When only a subset of the taxa was used in the
analyses, the corresponding subset of the topology was
used. Sequences downstream of stop codons and

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:109

frameshift mutations were omitted from the analyses. We
verified that including the sequence downstream of the
disruption did not affect the result by performing parallel
runs, in which stop codons and frameshift mutations were
omitted form the sequences.
We estimated the synonymous substitution rate (dS) for
each gene by comparing rates between taxa in all possible
combinations (runmode = -2 in PAML 3.14 [19]). A
Mann-Whitney U-test (Statistica 7.1, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK)
was utilized to examine whether the synonymous substitution pattern differs between mat- and non-reproductive
genes in heterothallic and homothallic taxa.
Models of variable ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous substitution rates (dS), ω, among sites were used
to test for the presence of sites under different evolutionary constraints, and to identify them. We used six models
outlined by Nielsen and Yang [18] and implemented in
PAML version 3.14 [19]. The one-ratio model (Nssites 0)
assumes one ω for all sites, while the discrete model
(Nssites 3) uses a general discrete distribution with three
site classes estimated from the data. The nearly-neutral
model (Nssites 1a) assumes two classes of sites in the protein, with ω < 1 and ω = 1. The positive-selection model
(Nssites 2a) adds a third class of sites to the neutral model,
in which ω > 1. The beta model (Nssites 7) uses a β distribution of ω over sites: β (p, q), which, depending on the
parameters p and q, can take various shapes in the interval
(0,1). The beta&ω model (Nssites 8) adds an extra class of
sites to the beta model, with a proportion of ω estimated
from the data.
To verify which of the models best fits the data, likelihood
ratio tests (LRTs) were performed by comparing twice the
difference in log-likelihood values (-2ln∆) between two
models using a χ2 distribution, with the number of
degrees of freedom equal to the differences in the number
of parameters between the models. For each dataset, we
made three comparisons: first, the one-ratio model
(Nssites 0) was compared to the discrete model (Nssites
3), to test for a variation of ω among codons within the
gene. To test whether a gene evolve under positive selection, the two models including a class of codons with positively selected sites (i.e. ω > 1; models Nssites 2a and
Nssites 8) were compared to their corresponding neutral
models (Nssites 1a and Nssites 7, respectively) using 4, 2
and 2 degrees of freedom, respectively [45].
We identified particular sites in the genes that were likely
to have evolved under positive selection by using the
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) calculation of posterior probabilities for site classes implemented in the positive-selection- and beta&ω models [48].
