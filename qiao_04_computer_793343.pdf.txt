Abstract
Background: Determination of genetic relatedness among microorganisms provides information
necessary for making inferences regarding phylogeny. However, there is little information available
on how well the genetic relationships inferred from different genotyping methods agree with true
genetic relationships. In this report, two genotyping methods – restriction fragment analysis (RFA)
and partial genome DNA sequencing – were each compared to complete DNA sequencing as the
definitive standard for classification.
Results: Using the Genbank database, 16 different types or subtypes of papillomavirus were
selected as study samples, because numerous complete genome sequences were available. RFA was
achieved by computer-simulated digestion. The genetic similarity of samples, based on RFA, was
determined from the proportion of fragments that matched in size. DNA sequences of four specific
genes (E1, E6, E7, and L1), representing partial genome sequencing, were also selected for
comparison to complete genome sequencing. Laboratory error was not taken into account.
Evaluation of the correlation between genetic similarity matrices (Mantel's r) and comparisons of
the structure of the derived dendrograms (partition metric) indicated that partial genome
sequencing (for single genes) had higher agreement with complete genome sequencing, achieving a
maximum Mantel's r = 0.97 and a minimum partition metric = 10. RFA had lower agreement, with
a maximum Mantel's r = 0.60 and a minimum partition metric = 18.
Conclusions: This simulation indicated that for smaller genomes, such as papillomavirus, partial
genome sequencing is superior to restriction fragment analysis in representing genetic relatedness
among isolates. The generalizability of these results to larger genomes, as well as the impact of
laboratory error, remains to be demonstrated.

Background
Precise estimation of genetic relatedness between isolates
of a microorganism is important for determination of
phylogenetic relationships, which has important applications in studies of disease transmission [1,2]. The defini-

tive standard for assessing genetic relatedness among
organisms is the complete genome sequence of nucleotide
bases [3]. However, nucleotide sequencing is expensive
and time-consuming, thus, generally it is impractical for

use in most investigations, particularly when a large
number of samples is analyzed.
Currently, one genotyping technique used frequently as
an alternative to complete genome sequencing is restriction fragment analysis (RFA), in which restriction endonuclease enzymes cleave the genome at specific sites,
producing DNA fragments that are then separated by size
using electrophoresis [4]. The percentage of fragments
matching in size has been commonly used as an index to
represent the genetic similarity between samples [5,6].
The accuracy of RFA in determining the true genetic relationships can be influenced by several factors, including
the number of restriction enzymes used, the specific
enzymes selected for DNA digestion, and laboratory conditions [7-9].
Another common alternative to complete genome
sequencing is partial genome sequencing, i.e., the nucleotide sequencing of a particular gene or segment of the
genome [8,10]. The gene or genome segment is often targeted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Selection of an
appropriate gene or region for analysis is critical for accurately representing phylogenetic relationships [11,12].
In a comparison of RFA and partial genome sequencing
with respect to their similarity in interpreting a disease
outbreak caused by pseudorbabies virus in a swine producing region in Illinois, USA, both genotyping methods
generated similar conclusions about patterns of spread of
the virus [13]. However, the accuracy of each genotyping
method in representing the complete genome was not
evaluated.
Restriction fragment analysis detects genetic variation by
surveying specific endonuclease restriction sites over the
entire genome; in contrast, partial genome sequencing
detects genetic variation by comparing nucleotide bases
from a specific region of the genome. Each method detects
a different dimension of genetic variation, and each can
detect only a proportion of the genetic variation present in
the entire genome. Therefore, it is important to determine
which method, using partial information, provides a
more accurate estimation of genetic relatedness.
The primary purpose of this study was to compare both
restriction fragment analysis and partial genome sequencing to complete genome sequencing, with regard to their
agreement in estimating genetic relationships and in
reconstructing phylogenies under the ideal conditions of
absence of laboratory error. Computer simulation of the
genotyping analysis was conducted, using completely
sequenced papillomavirus isolates obtained from
Genbank.

Results
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on fragment size distributions for RFA (using the MaeI enzyme as an example)
showing that a moderate number of fragments (mean >
20) were produced by simulated digestion. Fragment sizes
were large (median ≈ 280 bps for example enzyme), with
only 4 samples having one fragment each ≤ 20 bps. Table
2 shows that with an increase in the number of restriction
enzymes, the correlation between the RFA and the complete genome sequencing genetic distance matrices
increased slightly and the partition metric measuring dendrogram topological dissimilarity decreased slightly. The
highest agreement with complete genome sequencing
obtained for RFA was for a 4-enzyme combination, which
achieved a maximum Mantel's r = 0.60 and minimum
partition metric = 18. Table 3 shows that the similarity
with complete genome sequencing in estimating genetic
relatedness was much higher for partial genome sequencing, particularly for the E1 and L1 genes, which had the
relatively longer sequences (averaging 24.2% and 19.6%
of genome, respectively), although all genes selected had
Mantel's r ≥ 0.88. The minimum value of the partition
metric was 10, and the maximum value was 14, compared
to a minimum of 18 for RFA. Phylogenetic trees are presented for complete genome sequencing (Fig. 1), RFA (the
4-enzyme condition with the highest agreement with
complete genome sequencing) (Fig. 2), and sequencing of
the E1 gene (the longest gene) (Fig. 3). Tree stability, as
indicated by bootstrap values, was higher for complete
genome sequencing (Fig. 1: all bootstrap values > 0.90)
than for partial genome sequencing of the E1 gene (highest Mantel's r). However, the E1 gene tree structure for the
most closely related samples was stable and nearly identical to complete genome sequencing. In contrast to the
RFA example given (Fig. 2), which did not clearly differentiate the papillomavirus samples into subgroups, partial
genome sequencing of the E1 gene identified 2 subgroups
with the same composition (and BPV2 as an outlier) as
did complete genome sequencing.

Discussion
Sequencing entire genomes is impractical in most investigations of genetic relationships. The computer simulation
conducted here determined that compared to restriction
fragment analysis, partial genome sequencing had higher
agreement with complete genome sequencing in estimating genetic relatedness and greater similarity in the topology of the dendrograms of phylogenetic relationships
derived from these estimates. These results using papallomavirus sequences with a genome length averaging less
than 8 kb, indicate that for microorganisms with small
genomes, partial genome sequencing targeting genes
comprising approximately 20–25% of the total genome
length can provide a very good estimate of genetic relatedness. The topological structure of phylogenetic trees was

also stable for partial genome sequencing, particularly for
the most closely related samples. The degree to which
these results generalize to larger genomes is unknown, in
part because microorganisms with large genomes are
rarely, if ever, sequenced in their entirety. There are also
other considerations in selecting partial genome sequencing as a genotyping method, such as presence of the gene
in all isolates, and sufficient variability to differentiate isolates [12]. In addition, whether genetic variation is ran-

dom or due to natural selection needs to be taken into
account [14], because in the latter case genetic dissimilarity may not reflect time since divergence, thus making it
more difficult to infer evolutionary relationships, which
are important for making inferences about pathogen
transmission. These limitations should be considered as
well for restriction fragment analysis.

One might expect that increasing genome size would
diminish the advantage of partial genome sequencing
compared to restriction fragment analysis. As total
genome size increases, the number of restriction sites cut
by restriction enzymes is expected to increase, providing
more fragments and more genetic information for estimating genetic relatedness at no increased cost. This also
needs to be taken into account in the selection of a genotyping method. However, it has been argued that if a gene
is selectively neutral (i.e., variations are not subject to natural selection), it is only the length of the gene sequenced,
not the ratio of sequenced gene length to genome size,
that is important for determining the degree of divergence
from a common ancestor [14]. To the extent that these
conditions are satisfied, the results of this study indicate
that specific gene sequencing is likely to provide a better
estimate of genetic relationships than restriction fragment
analysis of the complete genome under a wider variety of
genome sizes.
The general conditions under which partial genome
sequencing is more accurate than restriction fragment
analysis in representing true genetic relatedness have not
been addressed in the analysis conducted here. However,
another study from our laboratory [15], using simulated
genomes of various size with different nucleotide substitution rates, and varying degrees of genetic diversity
among samples, found that only under conditions of both
short partial genome sequence length and low rates of
nucleotide substitution did RFA provide a more accurate
topological reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships
than did partial genome sequencing; the degree of genetic
diversity among samples did not affect the advantage partial genome sequencing had in accurately depicting phylogenetic relationships. Thus, whether one is investigating
the genetic relatedness among samples collected from a
single disease outbreak or a diverse collection of samples
from different times and geographic regions, under most
conditions partial genome sequencing will represent
genetic relationships more accurately than does RFA. Genotyping using partial genome sequencing and phyloge-

netic reconstruction (using the neighbor-joining
algorithm) have become standard for several virus species,
including not only papillomavirus [16,17], but also
human immunodeficiency virus [18], classical swine fever
virus [19], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus [20], and foot-and-mouth disease virus [21].
The simulated genotyping conducted here assumed no
error of measurement. The sources of error in restriction
fragment analysis are well known [22-24]. Fragments of
similar size in the same lane of a gel may be indistinguishable, thus appearing to form one fragment. Fragments of
small size may be undetectable. The relationship between
migration distances and fragment size may be affected by
variation in gel density both between and within gels.
There are also differences in measurement error between
laboratories [25,26]. These deficiencies are accounted for
by use of marker DNA fragments of known nucleotide
base pair length to assist in estimating cleaved DNA fragment sizes; however, acknowledgement of remaining
error of measurement of the size of detectable fragments
is inherent in the application of a tolerance range for considering fragments of similar but different sizes as a
"match" [27]. Laboratory error is also inherent in partial
genome sequencing [28]. With the commonly used
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology for detection and amplification of genes for sequencing, there can
be error in primer development because primer sites may
not be specific to the gene sequences or too specific to
demarcate all occurrences of the gene. Heterogeneity of
amplified DNA, due to replication error, recombination,
low primer specificity, or impurity of the template can
result in a failure to produce consistent sequencing
results. In the comparison of the degree of similarity of
DNA sequences between samples, alignment of sequences
with unequal sequence lengths due to deletion or duplication, or the management of inverted sequences presents
additional challenges for estimating genetic similarity and
phylogenetic affinity [14]. The relative magnitude of
sources of error in RFA versus partial genome sequencing
is unknown and, thus, the conclusions presented here are
those based upon the assumption of the absence or minimization of laboratory error.
In practical terms, laboratory error and cost need to be
taken into account in the selection of a genotyping
method. However, when the impact of these factors is
minimized, the computer simulation analysis conducted
here indicates that partial genome sequence becomes the
preferred
alternative
for
representing
genetic
relationships.

Conclusions
For small genomes, partial genome sequencing of target
genes comprising 20–25% of the total genome provides a

is indicated to be the preferred genotyping method for

degree to which these results are generalizable to larger

12 samples were selected at random: HPV 4, 6a, 6b, 20,
24, 49, 63, 13, 29, 32, 54, and 26. For bovine papilloma-

virus (BPV), complete genome sequences were available
for BPV1, BPV2, and BPV4. Because the E1 gene of BPV1
(of interest for partial genome sequencing) could not be

located, only BPV2 and BPV4 were chosen and included
in the study. One type of canine oral papillomavirus
(caninePV) and one type of common chimpanzee papillomavirus (chimPV) were available in the database, and
these were chosen. Thus, a total of 16 types or subtypes of
papillomaviruses that have been completely sequenced
and stored in Genbank were used (Table 1).
The complete DNA sequences of the 16 papillomavirus
samples were aligned using ClustalW software [30]. The
genetic distances among these sequences were then calculated using the Kimura correction [31,32].
Computer simulated restriction fragment analysis
Restriction endonuclease enzymes
Commonly used restriction endonuclease enzymes were
selected [33], based on the following criteria: (1) Only
enzymes with 4-base pair recognition sites were selected,
in order to produce a sufficient number of fragments for
analysis. (2) Among enzymes having the same recognition site, only one was selected. (3) For simplicity,
enzymes with multiple recognition sites were excluded.
Using these criteria, 15 restriction enzymes were included
(AccII, AciI, AluI, BsuRI, CviRI, HapII, HhaI, MaeI, MaeI,
MboI, MseI, NlaIII, RsaI, TaqI, TspEI).

Agreement between genotyping methods
Correlation between distance matrices
The matrix of genetic distances based on complete DNA
sequences was considered the definitive standard. The
genetic distance matrices based on RFA and partial
genome sequencing were compared to complete genome
sequencing by calculating Mantel's coefficient of correlation between matrices (Mantel's r) [36].
Comparison of phylogenetic trees
The genetic distance matrices for RFA, partial genome
sequencing, and complete genome sequencing were used
to construct phylogenetic trees, using the Neighboringjoining algorithm [37], as implemented by MEGA software [38]. Trees were rooted at the midpoint between the
most distantly related samples [39]. Bootstrap values indicating stability of tree topology were added to trees based
on partial and complete genome sequencing [14]. The
trees based on RFA and specific gene sequences were compared to the tree for complete genome sequencing, by
using the COMPONENT software [40] to calculate the
partition metric, which measures the difference in tree
topology [41,42]. A lower value of partition metric indicates greater topological similarity.

Digestion
Simulated digestion of each papillomavirus DNA sample

DIGEST program [34]. The resulting restriction fragments
for each sample were sorted by size (number of nucleotide
base pairs).

Calculation of genetic distances
Based on the distribution of restriction fragment sizes, the
genetic similarity between any two papillomavirus samples was calculated for each restriction enzyme using the
Dice coefficient [5,6]: Sxy = 2nxy/(nx+ny), where nxy is the
number of fragments matching in size for samples x and
y, and nx and ny are the number of fragments in samples x
and y, respectively. Then, Dxy = 1-Sxy was calculated as a
distance measure. Pairwise distances between samples
were computed for each individual enzyme. Also, pairwise distances were obtained for up to 4 enzymes, by
using for each condition (2, 3, and 4 enzymes) the fragment size distributions for 30 randomly selected combinations of enzymes, and calculating the composite
distance [35].
Partial genome sequence analysis
The E1, E6, E7, and L1 genes, which have been of interest
in studies of papillomavirus, were used for estimating
genetic relatedness. The ClustalW program [30] was used
for sequence alignment, and the genetic distances (with
the Kimura correction) were calculated for each gene.
