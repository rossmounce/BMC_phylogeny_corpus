SARS-CoV complete genomeisolatesgenome sequence variationSNPclassificationphylogenetics

Abstract
Background: We have compared 38 isolates of the SARS-CoV complete genome. The main goal
was twofold: first, to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences and to identify positions of single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertions and deletions, and second, to group them according to
sequence similarity, eventually pointing to phylogeny of SARS-CoV isolates. The comparison is
based on genome polymorphism such as insertions or deletions and the number and positions of
SNPs.
Results: The nucleotide structure of all 38 isolates is presented. Based on insertions and deletions
and dissimilarity due to SNPs, the dataset of all the isolates has been qualitatively classified into
three groups each having their own subgroups. These are the A-group with "regular" isolates (no
insertions / deletions except for 5' and 3' ends), the B-group of isolates with "long insertions", and
the C-group of isolates with "many individual" insertions and deletions. The isolate with the
smallest average number of SNPs, compared to other isolates, has been identified (TWH). The
density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions for each group or subgroup, as well as
cumulatively for all the isolates is also presented, along with the gene map for TWH.
Since individual SNPs may have occurred at random, positions corresponding to multiple SNPs
(occurring in two or more isolates) are identified and presented. This result revises some previous
results of a similar type. Amino acid changes caused by multiple SNPs are also identified (for the
annotated sequences, as well as presupposed amino acid changes for non-annotated ones). Exact
SNP positions for the isolates in each group or subgroup are presented. Finally, a phylogenetic tree
for the SARS-CoV isolates has been produced using the CLUSTALW program, showing high
compatibility with former qualitative classification.
Conclusions: The comparative study of SARS-CoV isolates provides essential information for
genome polymorphism, indication of strain differences and variants evolution. It may help with the
development of effective treatment.

Background
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease reported first in the autumn of 2002 and
diagnosed for the first time in March 2003 [1]. It is still a
serious threat to human health and SARS coronavirus
(CoV) has been associated with the pathogenesis of SARS
according to Koch's postulate [2].
Significant research efforts have been made into investigation of the SARS-CoV genome sequence, aimed at establishing its origin and evolution to help eventually in
preventing or curing the disease it causes. Although the
task is a hard one, it opens up the opportunity, amongst

others, for comparative investigation of different SARSCoV isolates aimed at identification of genome regions
properties expressing different levels of sequence polymorphism [3-8].
The genome of SARS-CoV consists of a single positive
RNA strand approximately 30 Kb in length, consisting of
about 10 open reading frames (ORF), and about 10 intergenic regions (IGRs). The first two overlapping ORFs at
the 5' end encompass two-thirds of the genome, while the
rest of the ORFs at the 3' end account for the remaining
third.

Figure 1
Comparison of nucleotide structures of SARS-CoV complete genome isolates
Comparison of nucleotide structures of SARS-CoV complete genome isolates. Insertions are denoted as emphasized (italic) and , deletions by minus sign ("-"). Positions are given in relation to the TWH isolate. The two isolates with a
large number of individual insertions (ZJ01, ZMY 1) are given separately, with exact positions of insertions and deletions.

We investigated 38 isolates of the SARS-CoV complete
genome (two pairs of which were identical), sequenced
and published by October 31st 2003 (with updated revisions up to February 20th, 2004). Sequences were taken
from the PubMed NCBI Entrez site [9] in gbk and fasta
formats (Table 1). The main goal was twofold: first, to
analyze and compare nucleotide sequences, to identify
SNPs positions, insertions and deletions, and second, to
group them according to sequence similarity, eventually
pointing to phylogeny of SARS-CoV isolates.
According to the length of isolates (insertions and deletions) and the presence of SNPs, we classified them into
three main groups with subgroups: "regular" isolates with
no insertions or deletions (with different numbers of
SNPs), isolates with "long insertions" and isolates with
"many individual" insertions and deletions (with different positions of SNPs), which is close to phylogenetic
analysis results.

Results and discussion
Genome polymorphism
All the sequences are between 29573 and 29757 in length
(Table 1), with a high degree of similarity (>99% pairwise). Still, they can be differentiated on the basis of
sequence polymorphism (insertions and deletions),
number and sites of SNPs [8]. Results of the comparison
of genome primary structure of the analyzed isolates are
given in Figure 1.

Analysis of genomic polymorphism of the isolates
resulted in the following facts
I) Some of the isolates are nucleotide-identical or almost
identical. There are two pairs of nucleotide-identical isolate sequences: (TWH, TWC2) and Tor2 (with accession
numbers Ay274119, Nc_004718). Therefore, instead of
38, we consider the dataset to contain 36 isolates. Further,
the isolate TWC3 differs in just one position with TWH
(see table in additional file 1), which is about randomly
expected [11]. Isolates Frankfurt 1 and FRA are identical

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5

up to the poly-"a" of length 13 present at the 3' end of FRA
(Figure 1).
II) Similarity analysis showed that a significant number of
isolates have the same length (29727 bases), the same
beginning and ending subsequences (that seem to be
exact starts and ends of the complete SARS-CoV genome
up to the poly-"a" at the 3' end), thus forming a kind of
referent group; these are the isolates TWH, TWC3, TWK,
TWS, TWY, Urbani, Frankfurt 1 (Figure 1). The fully
sequenced isolate TWH then has been chosen as the referent isolate for sequence comparisons since its average
number of SNPs compared to other isolates is the smallest. For example, TWH and Urbani have an average
number of SNPs 15.7 and 17.6 respectively for all the isolates, and 5.7 and 10.5 respectively for the referent group.
For SNPs see the tables in the additional files 1 and 2.
III) Most isolates, compared to TWH, are shorter at the
5'end (e.g., Sin2500, Sin2679, Sin2774, Sin2677,
Sin2748, AS), have various length poly-"a" strings at the
3' end (e.g., Tor2, HSR1, FRA, BJ02, TW1, HKU-39489,
WHU), or both (BJ01, BJ03, BJ04, CUHK-W1, CUHKSu10). Three of the isolates, Taiwan TC1, Taiwan TC2, Taiwan TC3, have both starting and ending deletions (at the
5' end 69, at the 3' end 85 nucleotides). Several isolates
(e.g. TWJ, TWC, Sin2677, Sin2748) have some short deletions inside the sequence (Figure 1).
IV) There is a group of isolates that have significant length
insertions (29 nucleotides) inside the sequence. These are
the isolates GD01, SZ3, SZ16. A significant number of
individual insertions have been identified in ZJ01 and
ZMY 1 isolates (Figure 1, additional files 3,4,5).
Among the SNP contents of isolates, there is a significant
difference in the number of SNPs for different pairs of isolates. For TWH as the referent isolate, this number varies
from 1 to 80 SNPs. Isolates may be classified into three
groups based on the number of SNPs with TWH (Figure
2):
1. with less than 15 (TWC3, TWK, TWS, TWY, Urbani,
TWJ, TWC, TW1, Tor2, HSR1, CUHK-Su10, AS, Sin2500,
Sin2679, Sin2774, Sin2677, Sin2748, Taiwan TC1, Taiwan TC2, Taiwan TC3, Frankfurt1, FRA, HKU-39849,
CUHK-W1),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/65

nucleotide changes that probably arose during propagation of the virus in cell culture and sequencing, Figure 3
represents positions (on the relative scale of all isolates
and on TWH scale) where two or more SNPs occurred, not
taking into consideration isolates with long insertions
(GD01, SZ3 and SZ16). The positions of multiple SNPs of
these three isolates, similar as far as these three are concerned, are highly different from all the others and are represented in Figure 4. These results coincide with those
published in Marra et al's paper [4] for Urbani and Tor2
isolates, but differ from those published in Ruan's paper
[8] for the 14 isolates therein analyzed (Sin-group, BJgroup, Tor2, Urbani, CUHK-W1, HKU-39849, GD01),
which were obviously based on different revisions of the
PubMed NCBI Entrez database [9]; lengths of the
sequences Tor2, CUHK-W1, GD01, BJ01-BJ04 differ from
the revisions we analyzed and consequently in some
nucleotides and the number of base changes at given positions. Differences include the following positions (based
upon Urbani and TWH SARS-CoV): 2601 (Tor2 T instead
of C, BJ04 T instead of missing base), 7919 (BJ03 C
instead of T), 8559 (BJ04 T instead of A), 8572 (BJ01 T
instead of G, GD01 G instead of T), 9404 (BJ04 T instead
of missing base), 9479 (BJ04 T instead of missing base),
9854 (BJ04 T instead of missing base), 19838 (GD01 G
instead of A), 21721 (GD01, BJ01, A instead of missing
base, BJ04 G instead of missing base), 22222 (BJ04 C
instead of N), 27243 (GD01 T instead of C, BJ03 T instead
of N), 29279 (all A's). The results obtained also differ
from Hsueh et al. [12] regarding nucleotides in HKU39849 isolate on positions 7746, 9404, 9479, 17564,
17846, 19064, 21721, 22222, 27827.
Additional file 1,2,3,4,5 represent SNPs for all the isolates
in all five groups, whether they occur in ORFs or IGR (for
annotated isolates), as well as the number of SNPs in
ORFs and SNPs in IGR, per isolate. The total number of
SNPs is 312 (only 2 in IGRs: TWH positions 27812 for the
isolate Taiwan TC3 and 27827 for the isolates BJ01 and
CUHK-W1). The average number of SNPs per isolate is
15.7 and significant difference from the average shows
TWC3 (just 1 SNP) and ZMY 1 (even 80).
Grouping of isolates
The isolates from the dataset considered may be classified
according to their sequence polymorphism and SNP contents properties just described. At first, properties (III, IV)
may result in three different groups (Figure 2):

2. between 15 and 30 (WHU, GZ50, BJ01-BJ04, ZJ01),
3. with equal to or greater than 30 SNPs (GD01, SZ3,
SZ16, ZMY 1).
Finally, besides the number, there are differences in positions of SNPs (potential mutation sites). In order to avoid

A. "regular isolates" whose nucleotide structure is close to
the referent group (different 5' and 3' ends, short deletion,
individual insertion): TWH, TWC3, TWK, TWS, TWY,
Urbani, TWJ, TWC, TW1, Tor2, HSR1, CUHK-Su10, AS,

Positions with two or more SNPs in A and C groups with amino acid changes. Positions are represented on the relative scale of all the isolates and on the TWH scale. Isolates from group B have not been counted, since their positions of SNPs
while coordinated among them, are highly different from all the others. SNPs are in bold type. Proteins associated with SNPs
are represented based on TWH annotation. IDs of annotated isolates are in grey boxes. Positions of SNPs causing amino acid
changes, together with amino acid and their properties' change [16] are in grey. Legend of A. Ac. properties: Hp:hydrophobic,

Figure distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions in the isolates of A1 group
Density 5
Density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions in the isolates of A1 group. SNPs are represented above the
line, insertions below the line, upward oriented, and deletions below the line, downward oriented. The TWH scale is used.
The same holds for Figures 6,7,8.

A2. WHU, BJ01-BJ04 and GZ50 (Figure 6a)

A2. CUHK-W1, GZ50 and BJ01-BJ04 (Figure 6a and the
additional file 2)

C1: ZJ01 (Figure 7a)
C2: ZMY 1 (Figure 7b)
Finally, the positions of SNPs will move CUHK-W1 from
A1 into A2 group (more than 50% of common SNP positions) while WHU will move from A2 into A1 (less than
30% of common SNP positions), giving the final grouping of isolates presented as a structural tree (Figure 2):

3)
C1. ZJ01 (Figure 7a and the additional file 4)
C2. ZMY 1 (Figure 7b and the additional file 5).
Although qualitative in nature, the structural tree turns
out to be close to the quantitative grouping which is a
basis for (computational) phylogenetic classification.
Tables in additional files 1,2,3,4,5 represent SNPs, insertions and deletions in groups A-C (see additional files 1
for isolates of A1 group, on the relative and TWH scale,

additional files 2 for isolates of A2 group and TWH, on the
TWH scale, additional files 3 for isolates of group B with
TWH, and additional files 4,5 for isolates of C1, C2
groups, respectively). Figures 5,6,7 represent density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions on the TWH
scale, for the same groups of isolates. Figure 8 represents
the overall density distribution of SNPs, insertions and
deletions for all the 36 isolates, along with the gene map
for TWH (which is quite similar to gene maps of other isolates). Density distributions do not show regularities yet
(with respect to the number of available sequences) that
could provide for precise statistical characterization. Still,
they exhibit crowding regions close to the 3' end which is
also characterized by the presence of a number of proteins
of unknown function.

Figure 9). The two sequence variants correspond to the
epidemiological spread, so that those that originated in
the Hotel M in Hong Kong have the T-T-T-T configuration
– covering A1, C groups in our classification – Canada
(Tor2), Singapore (all Sins), Frankfurt, Taiwan, Hong
Kong (HKU39849), Hanoi (Urbani), Italy (HSR1), China
(ZJ01), etc, and others having C-G-C-C configuration (A2,
B in our classification) which originated in Guangdong,
China (GD01 and GZ50), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1, SZ3
and SZ16), Beijing (BJ01-BJ04). The fact that the enlarged
number of isolates exhibits the same properties relating to
the four loci supports the assumption that the mutations
could not have arisen by chance base substitution during
propagation in cell culture and the sequencing procedure
[8].

It can also be noted that the proposed grouping of 36 isolates, based on different criteria, still conserves the previous classification T-T-T-T / C-G-C-C [8]. All the isolates
from groups A1 and C have T-T-T-T configuration, while
all the isolates from groups A2 and B have C-G-C-C configuration, except for GZ50, BJ04 being TGCC (Figure 2,

Changes in amino acids
We analyzed amino acid changes in proteins for the annotated isolates (19 out of 36), and presumed proteins in
non-annotated ones for multiple SNPs in all the isolates.
Results of the analysis are represented in Figures 3 and 4.

Phylogenetic tree of 36 SARS-CoV complete genome isolates
Phylogenetic tree of 36 SARS-CoV complete genome isolates. Distances represent degree of sequence variation. The
largest distance is associated with ZMY 1, followed by ZJ01 isolate (groups C1, C2). Groups A1, A2 and B are clearly distinguished. The tree has been obtained using CLUSTALW and PhyloDraw programs.

protein E, while nucleotide changes resulted in amino
acid changes in spike (S), membrane (M) and
nucleocapside (N) proteins. All three SNPs in the spike
protein are situated in the outer membrane region and not
within the potential epitope region (amino acid position
469–882) as proposed by Ren Y. et al. [13]. Amino acid

changes occurred in two multiple SNPs in M protein, one
multiple SNPs in N protein and 7 (out of 13) multiple
SNPs of the polyprotein 1ab, as well as in one multiple
SNP of a hypothetical protein, while the silent mutations
occurred in three hypothetical proteins. Figure 3 also represents properties of the corresponding amino acids

resulted by SNPs. The only significant change in amino
acid properties is in S protein Gly→Asp (A2, B groups, i.e.,
in CUHK-W1, GZ50, BJ01-BJ03, GD01, SZ3 and SZ16 isolates) and hypothetical protein Cys→Arg (the same isolates, BJ04 in addition). The only addition in nonannotated sequences is in hypothetical protein following
S protein in TWH, exhibiting silent change, and in nonannotated BJ02 and BJ03, corresponding to the hypothetical protein, Gly→Glu. Similar analysis can be done for
amino acid changes corresponding to SNPs at positions
specific for B group isolates (Figure 4). Taking into
account the only annotated isolate GD01, there are five
amino acid changes in polyprotein 1ab, two amino acid
properties changes in S protein (Ser→Leu and Tyr→Asp,
the second being within the epitope region), one amino
acid change in M protein and one amino acid property
change (Cis→Arg) in BGI-PUP.

3. Two of the isolates have a large number of individual
insertions / deletions, exhibiting different SNP positions;

Phylogenetic analysis
The SARS-CoV isolates have been multialigned using the
CLUSTALW program [10] as the very first step in
obtaining a phylogenetic tree. The aligned sequences have
been submitted then to CLUSTALW for bootstrapping
and phylogenetic tree production. Enlargement of the
sequence set resulted in the refinement of the phylogenetic tree produced, as compared to previous results such
as Ruan [8] and Zhang&Zheng [14], obtained for 14 and
16 isolates, respectively. The phylogenetic tree obtained,
drawn using the PhyloDraw program [15], is represented
in Figure 9. It is similar to our structural tree based on
qualitative analysis of the isolates (Figure 2).

6. Since S protein is of special interest regarding its receptor affinity and antigenecity, it is interesting to notice that
all amino acid properties' changes are located in its outer
membrane region, one for A, C groups and two for B
group.

The results of the analysis of dissimilarities, described in
previous paragraphs, are in accordance with the
alignment obtained by CLUSTALW, but regrouped and
formatted in a way that facilitates further interpretation
and application.

Conclusion
Comparative analysis of genome sequence variations of
38 SARS-CoV isolates resulted in some conclusions that
might be of interest in further investigation of the SARSCoV genome:

4. All the isolates may be grouped according to sequence
polymorphism into three groups (with up to two subgroups), reflecting their similarities / dissimilarities. Since
the isolate sequences have a high degree of homology,
different properties of groups are represented in a more
transparent way in the classification tree obtained by such
a qualitative analysis, than in a bootstrapped phylogenetic
tree obtained from multialigned sequences using the
CLUSTALW program [10].
5. The total number of amino acid changes caused by multiple SNPs is 15 (in isolates of A, C groups) and 34 in
isolates of B group. The total number of silent mutations
is 10 (for A, C groups) and 7 (for B group).

7. The results obtained may be useful in further investigation aiming at identification of SARS-CoV genome regions
responsible for its infectious nature.

Methods
Dataset
We investigated the complete genomes of 38 SARS-CoV
isolates. Nucleotide sequences are taken from the PubMed
NCBI Entrez database [9] in gbk and fasta formats (Table
1).

The coverage included all the isolates published by October 31st 2003 (with updated revisions). The identifiers,
accession numbers, genomic size (in nucleotides), revision dates and country or source of the isolates considered
are included in the table, together with labels as referred
in this paper. The fully sequenced isolate TWH has been
chosen as the referent isolate, since its average number of
SNPs was the lowest as compared to all other isolates.

1. All of the SARS-CoV isolates are highly homologous
(more than 99% pairwise). Most of them have similar
nucleotide structure, with the same 5' and 3' ends and
poly-"a" at the 3' end of different length (0–24), some of
them with a single short deletion close to the 3' end of the
sequence; out of 312 SNPs in total, only two are in IGRs.

Methods for similarity analysis
For similarity analysis of isolates, the following procedure
has been applied consisting of two steps:

2. Three of the 38 isolates have long insertions within the
sequence;

2. identification of SNPs in structurally identical parts.

1. identification of structurally identical parts of isolates,
i.e., insertion and deletion sites

Step 1 has been carried out by a function performing similarity analysis of subsequences of a given length (e.g., 100

bps), and identifying significantly non-matching strings
as being inserted in the corresponding sequence (i.e.
deleted from the other). Since significant number of isolates have the same length (29727 bases) and starting and
ending subsequences (that seem to be the exact starts and
ends of the complete SARS-CoV genome up to the poly"a" at the 3' end), they may be considered as forming a
representative group. The nucleotide structure of all other
isolates was analyzed with respect to this representative
group. For each pair of isolates (x,y) (x from the representative group), a file InsDelx-y has been produced containing positions and lengths of each of the insertions or
deletions in the isolate y.

scales (TWH, GD01, SZ3 and SZ16) are given. ID of the only annotated
isolate (GD01) is in grey box; SNPs in ORFs (or corresponding to those
in ORFs, for non-annotated isolates) are in red bold. The total number of
SNPs per isolate is given at the bottom, as well as the number of SNPs in

We also used the CLUSTALW program [10] for multialignment as a control process, as well as for phylogenetic
investigations.
Methods for phylogenetic investigation
In order to use similarity analysis results for drawing any
phylogenetic conclusions about the SARS-CoV genome
dataset, a CLUSTALW [10] multialigned output has been
generated and a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree has been
produced and drawn using the PhyloDraw program [15].
