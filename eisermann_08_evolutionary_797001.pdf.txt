Abstract
Background: Gene expression analyses have led to a better understanding of growth control of prostate
cancer cells. We and others have identified the presence of several zinc finger transcription factors in the
neoplastic prostate, suggesting a potential role for these genes in the regulation of the prostate cancer
transcriptome. One of the transcription factors (TFs) identified in the prostate cancer epithelial cells was
the Wilms tumor gene (WT1). To rapidly identify coordinately expressed prostate cancer growth control
genes that may be regulated by WT1, we used an in silico approach.
Results: Evolutionary conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) recognized by WT1, EGR1, SP1,
SP2, AP2 and GATA1 were identified in the promoters of 24 differentially expressed prostate cancer genes
from eight mammalian species. To test the relationship between sequence conservation and function,
chromatin of LNCaP prostate cancer and kidney 293 cells were tested for TF binding using chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Multiple putative TFBS in gene promoters of placental mammals were found
to be shared with those in human gene promoters and some were conserved between genomes that
diverged about 170 million years ago (i.e., primates and marsupials), therefore implicating these sites as
candidate binding sites. Among those genes coordinately expressed with WT1 was the kallikrein-related
peptidase 3 (KLK3) gene commonly known as the prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene. This analysis located
several potential WT1 TFBS in the PSA gene promoter and led to the rapid identification of a novel putative
binding site confirmed in vivo by ChIP. Conversely for two prostate growth control genes, androgen
receptor (AR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), known to be transcriptionally regulated by
WT1, regulatory sequence conservation was observed and TF binding in vivo was confirmed by ChIP.
Conclusion: Overall, this targeted approach rapidly identified important candidate WT1-binding
elements in genes coordinately expressed with WT1 in prostate cancer cells, thus enabling a more focused
functional analysis of the most likely target genes in prostate cancer progression. Identifying these genes
will help to better understand how gene regulation is altered in these tumor cells.

Background
In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common
form of cancer in men and is the second most deadly cancer in men killing more than 27,000 annually [1]. Nearly
one in six men will develop prostate cancer at some point
in their life, with the majority of incidences occurring after
the age of 50. The major biomarker for prostate cancer
diagnosis is prostate specific antigen (PSA), however, the
sensitivity and specificity of the PSA assay is limited [2].
Improved biomarkers will result from a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate this disease.

identify TFBS that are likely to be functional. Our
approach was to identify regions (and TFBS) evolutionary
conserved across multiple mammalian genomes, including those separated by 170 million years (human and
opossum) [21]. Overall, this targeted approach identified
important candidate binding elements in genes coordinately expressed with WT1 in prostate cancer epithelial
cells. Identifying genes regulated by zinc finger TFs
expressed in prostate cancer cells will enhance understanding of the altered pathways in these tumor cells and
provide useful biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.

Results
Global gene expression analyses have led to a better
understanding of growth control of prostate cancer cells
[3-5]. Ongoing studies identified more than 200 genes
predominantly expressed in prostate cancer epithelial
cells [6] and included genes likely to influence growth of
prostate cancer cells, such as growth factors, growth factor
receptors and TFs (as identified by Gene Ontology and
KEGG pathway analyses). Two of the TFs identified in the
prostate cancer epithelial cells were the Wilms tumor gene
(WT1) and the early growth response gene (EGR1), zinc
finger transcription factors that bind at G-rich promoters
of genes that regulate growth. In fact, the WT1 TF binds at
several G-rich sites (GNGNGGGNG), including the EGR1
consensus binding site GCGGGGGCG [7-9]. Both WT1
and EGR1 have been identified in prostate cancer cells,
although their function in prostate epithelium is
unknown [10-12]. WT1 has an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system and has been
shown to suppress transcription of the promoters of many
important growth factors [13].
While identifying prostate growth control pathways
potentially regulated by WT1, we have focused our studies
on candidate genes belonging to known growth regulatory pathways. We have previously described WT1 regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene promoters
[14,15]. To go beyond the candidate genes approach and
identify novel gene targets coordinately expressed with
WT1 in tumor epithelial cells, a more systematic and
unbiased high-throughput computational approach was
used. These in silico analyses were based on 24 genes
expressed in prostate cancer epithelium that were likely to
influence growth of prostate cancer cells. Putative TFBS
were computationally predicted; however, the identification of functional TFBS is a challenge and requires an
alternative approach. Availability of complete genomic
sequence from multiple species allows identification of
evolutionary conserved elements, e.g. cis-regulatory elements. Functionally important elements are likely to
experience purifying selection pressure [16-20], thus, we
can utilize the degree of evolutionary conservation to

Evolutionary conservation analysis: TFBS conserved in
prostate cancer growth genes
Genomic sequences of proximal promoter regions of 24
genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells (Additional file 1) were analyzed to determine the degree of
evolutionary conservation and to identify potentially
important regulatory regions. Binding sites for six TFs
(WT1, EGR1, SP1, SP2, AP2, and GATA1) were investigated for evolutionary conservation over a range of eight
different mammalian species (human, chimpanzee,
macaque, cow, dog, mouse, rat and opossum) (Table 1).
Tables 2 and 3 highlight 11 of these genes whose promoter sequences could be aligned in at least five mammalian species (human, chimpanzee, macaque, rat and
mouse) and were found to have at least one evolutionary
conserved TFBS.

Among the TFBS investigated, WT1, EGR1 and SP1 sites
showed the highest frequency of evolutionary conservation in the gene promoters surveyed. For example, the
promoters of EGR1, GATA2 and WT1 were found to have
multiple WT1, EGR1 and SP1 candidate binding sites that
were conserved through multiple species (Table 3). In the
EGR1 promoter, 50% of WT1 sites are conserved between
human and primates. Additionally, in the GATA2 gene
promoter, 94% of WT1 sites, 70% of SP1 sites, and 100%
of EGR1 sites are conserved between human and other
primates (Table 3). Similarly, in the WT1 gene promoter
50% of SP1, 43% of WT1 and 100% of EGR1 sites are conserved between human and other primates (Table 3).
WT1, EGR1, and SP1 TFBS within the promoters of
IGFBP2, KLK3, NPY, SOX4, SOX9, and TFAP2C are also
conserved between human and other primates (Table 3).
Importantly, for the WT1 and EGR1 gene promoters this
conservation extended into the marsupials (Table 4). The
EGR1 gene promoter is relatively conserved between
human and opossum with 20% of predicted EGR1, 12%
of predicted WT1 and 14% of predicted SP1 sites conserved between human and opossum. Similarly, the WT1
gene promoter exhibited conservation between human
and opossum, with 33% of predicted SP1 and 14% of pre-

dicted WT1 sites shared between human and opossum. In
the GATA2 promoter only 12% of predicted WT1 sites are
shared between human and opossum (Table 4). Overall,
TFBS for the three TF (WT1, EGR1, and SP1) were evolutionary conserved between human and the distantly
related species, opossum, in seven different promoters
(WT1, EGR1, GATA2, IGFBP2, SOX4, SOX9, and
TFAP2C).

Tables 3 and 4 show that there were fewer SP2, AP2 and
GATA1 than WT1, EGR1 and SP1 TFBS in the 11 gene promoters analyzed. While evolutionary conservation
between primates was similar for all six TFBS, conservation between human and rodents diminished for SP2 and
AP2 TFBS. AP2 sites in the promoters of the GATA2, WT1,
and NPY genes showed 25% to 100% conservation
between human and other primates. Conservation of AP2
sites was the strongest in the NPY gene promoter as these
sites are also conserved between human and opossum
(Table 4). In addition to conservation of GC-rich TFBS,
the AT-rich GATA1 binding sites were shown to be highly
conserved in several gene promoters including SOX4,
EGR1, IGFBP2 and NPY (Table 3). All of the GATA1 sites
in these four promoters are conserved between human
and chimpanzee, and for the SOX4 gene promoter this
strong conservation extends to rodents as well.

TFBS decreased as species became more evolutionarily

amount of conservation was found between human and
opossum. Of the 47 predicted WT1 sites in the 11 genes
analyzed, primates had 68% of these sites conserved

decreasing conservation of these sites with evolutionary
divergence. Thus, with this approach of identifying evolutionary conserved sequences we were able to pinpoint
specific candidate binding sites that could be tested for
functional relevance.
Conservation of overlapping WT1, EGR1, and SP1 TFBS
Several of the genes investigated have multiple overlapping WT1, EGR1, and SP1 binding sites in their proximal
promoter regions. For example, the promoter of the
human EGR1 gene has evolutionary conserved overlapping WT1/SP1 binding sites (one of which is shown in
Figure 1A). Both the overlapping WT1 (human 565–581)
and SP1 (human 563–577) sites are conserved between
seven of eight species compared, and the SP1 site is also
conserved between human and opossum. A second WT1
site (human 614–630) located 33 bp downstream overlaps an EGR1 site (human 608–624) and both sites are
conserved among all eight species, including opossum
(Figure 1A). The promoter of the GATA2 gene also contained overlapping SP1 and WT1 TFBS (located in human
positions 1125–1139 and 1127–1145, respectively) that
are conserved among several mammalian genomes (Figure 1B). The WT1 gene promoter also has overlapping
WT1/SP1 binding sites and when aligned with multiple
species, one 3' WT1 site (human 1444–1468) was conserved between all primates, rodents, and opossum, thus,
depicting millions of years of conservation of this particu-

lar site (Figure 1C). The SP1 site (human 1420–1434) is
conserved between all primates and rodents tested, and
overlaps with a WT1 site (human 1409–1425) that is conserved between human and chimpanzee (Figure 1C).
Interestingly, the sequence similarity is so great between
human and chimpanzee for this WT1 promoter region
that no insertions or deletions were observed in either
genomic sequence; thus, these TFBS were located in
exactly the same positions relative to the start ATG codon.
Identification of overlapping TFBS in the gene promoters
indicated that WT1 and EGR1 may compete for binding.
Analyses of the promoter regions of 11 genes expressed in
prostate cancer epithelial cells showed that WT1 TFBS
overlapped SP1 and EGR1 TFBS, either separately or
together. Overall, it was found that there were 25 overlapping sites in the promoter regions of these genes. There
were 12 WT1/SP1, seven SP1/EGR1, three WT1/EGR1,
and three WT1/SP1/EGR1 overlapping sites (Table 6).
These overlapping sites were found in 10 of the 11 gene
promoters analyzed. Seven overlapping sites were identified in the promoter region of the EGR1 gene, and three of
these seven overlapping sites are conserved between
human and other species. Three other gene promoters,
GATA2, IGFBP2, and TFAP2C, have three overlapping
sites each, with one SP1/EGR1 site conserved between
human and opossum for both the TFAP2C and IGFBP2
promoters. The WT1 and KLK3 promoters have overlapping WT1/SP1 and SP1/EGR1 sites, respectively. All of

between all eight species, the WT1 site is conserved between all but opossum and the EGR1 site is conserved between primates. Negative numbers in the chimpanzee EGR1 promoter sequence indicate that the orthologous region was located 1,668

(human 1127–1143 and human 1129–1145) overlap an SP1 site (human 1125–1139) in the GATA2 gene promoter region. The
WT1 sites are conserved between human, chimpanzee, and macaque, while the SP1 site is conserved between human, chimpanzee, macaque, and cow. (C) Two WT1 and an SP1 TFBS in the WT1 promoter are conserved. The WT1 site (human 1444–
1468) is conserved between human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, and opossum. The WT1 site (human 1409–1425) that
overlaps an SP1 site is conserved between human and chimpanzee only, while the SP1 site (human 1420–1434) is conserved
between human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, and rat.

these overlapping TFBS are excellent candidates for functional testing to determine whether competition for TF
binding at these sites results in activation or suppression
of the genes they are regulating.
Sequence conservation of TFBS indicates a potentially
functional WT1 binding site in the KLK3 (PSA) promoter
One of the 24 genes differentially expressed in prostate
cancer epithelial cells was KLK3 (PSA), an important diagnostic marker. Sequence alignment of the KLK3 promoter
revealed three WT1 sites and two SP1 sites, with twothirds of the WT1 and one-half of the SP1 sites conserved
between human and other primates (Table 3). Given the
premise that evolutionary conserved sites are more likely
to be functionally relevant, we tested these conserved sites
for their ability to bind TF in vivo. PCR primers were

designed to flank the region where adjacent conserved
WT1 (human 1332–1352) and the SP1 sites (human
1404–1418) were identified (Figure 2A). Both of these
binding sites in the PSA promoter were tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in hormone responsive
LNCaP prostate cancer cells (Figure 2B). Since LNCaP cells
express little WT1 [22], they were transfected with a green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged WT1 expression construct 48 hours prior to the ChIP assay. After crosslinking,
the chromatin and TF complexes were immunoprecipitated by both WT1 and SP1antibodies, as demonstrated
by PCR amplification of the promoter region. WT1 and
SP1 may bind at adjacent sites within the PSA promoter or
at overlapping sites, since the SP1 site overlaps the EGR1
site, to which WT1 may also bind [7-9]. The importance

of these WT1 and SP1 TFBS as candidate binding sites was
confirmed by the in vivo ChIP assay.
Functional WT1 and SP1 binding sites in the VEGF
promoter are conserved between human and other
primates
Having tested the significance of identified evolutionary
conserved sites, we then asked whether TFBS known to
mediate transcriptional regulation would also be conserved. Two genes that regulate prostate cancer progression by enhancing growth and blood supply, AR and
VEGF, have multiple WT1 and SP1 binding sites in their
proximal promoter regions [14,15,23-25]. We have previously identified an EGR1 site in the VEGF promoter that
binds both WT1 and SP1 protein in vitro [15], and here
demonstrate by ChIP assay that this promoter region
binds WT1 and SP1 in vivo (Figure 3). Chromatin from
both embryonic kidney 293 cells and LNCaP cells expressing a GFP-tagged WT1 expression construct was immunoprecipitated by WT1 and SP1 antibodies and amplified by
PCR. Using primers specific for the VEGF proximal promoter region, products ~140 bp in size were amplified
from chromatin of both 293 and LNCaP cells (Figure 3A
and 3B). These ChIP assays also demonstrated selective
WT1 binding, since an adjacent site 190 nucleotides
downstream failed to bind WT1 in the same assay (data
not shown). These sites were validated as being transcriptionally regulated in several different assays, including
luciferase reporter assays [15], so we asked whether they
were evolutionary conserved in different species. In silico

analyses predicted that an overlapping EGR1 (human
1717–1733) and SP1 (human 1721–1735) site and a
WT1 site (human 1755–1771) were conserved between
primates and dogs, but not in rodents (Figure 3C). Furthermore, as seen with the PSA promoter region, WT1 and
SP1 may bind at adjacent sites or potentially at overlapping sites since WT1 also binds at EGR1 sites [7-9]. Both
PSA and VEGF promoter regions contain evolutionary
conserved WT1 sites adjacent to overlapping EGR1/SP1
TFBS, to which WT1 is also likely to bind, thus facilitating
either cooperation or competition between TFs.
Similarly, WT1 binding sites previously identified in the
AR proximal promoter region by EMSA analysis and verified to mediate transcriptional regulation in luciferase
reporter assays [14,23] were confirmed by ChIP using PCR
primers flanking the WT1 and SP1 TFBS (Figure 4A). Since
these binding sites were tested in vivo, evidence of
sequence conservation was sought, as described. As
shown in Figure 4B, both a WT1 site (human 1434–1450)
and an EGR1 site (human 1524–1537) were identified
within the region amplified by ChIP. This less common
pyrimidine-rich EGR1 TFBS, consisting of TCC repeats,
has been shown to bind both WT1 and SP1 [7,14,26],
thus all three zinc finger TFs could compete for binding at
this site. Evidence for evolutionary conservation between
human and other primates was limited by the lack of
genomic sequence information available for chimpanzee
(and lack of conservation between human and macaque).

Discussion
Identification of evolutionary conserved sequences
derived from comparisons of multiple genomes (so-called
"phylogenetic footprints") has been successful in identifying functionally important regions, including those
regions that regulate gene expression [19,27-34]. However, some regulatory genomic sequences do not appear
to be conserved or the level of evolutionary conservation
varies between different genomic comparisons [35,36].
Importantly, some functional regions have been reported
to experience a relatively fast rate of turnover, where the
functional significance of the element is retained despite
changes at the nucleotide sequence level (e.g., transcription start sites, [37]). Thus, it is likely that gene expression
in mammalian genomes is controlled by both types of

regulatory elements, i.e., those elements that exhibit evolutionary and functional conservation and those that
exhibit functional conservation only. Moreover, while
numerous algorithms are available to computationally
predict potential regulatory elements, it is often challenging to narrow down the list of those that are likely to be
functional, particularly for relatively short elements such
as TFBS. One of the approaches that utilizes evolutionary
conservation as a predictor of TFBS functionality is the
rVISTA tool that uses pairwise sequence alignments to
identify the most highly conserved TFBS between the pair
of genomic sequences [38]. Another set of tools, the
Mulan, takes advantage of evolutionary conservation
information obtained from multi-sequence alignments of
several genomes [39]. However, the latter requires the

tiple genomes are likely to be truly functional. Our identification of evolutionary conserved WT1 and SP1 binding
sites in the PSA promoter indeed supports this notion
(Figure 2). As expected, conservation of TFBS decreased as
species became more evolutionarily divergent [40], so
those TFBS that were conserved between multiple species
including opossum are more likely to be functionally
important in the regulation of gene expression.

TFBS to be shared among all genomes present in the alignment [39] and may potentially miss the lineage-specific
regulatory elements that are absent from some subsets of
genomes. Therefore, in this work we used TFBS elements
shared between some but not necessarily all of the available genomes.
We used evolutionary sequence conservation, as determined by both the multi-species sequence alignments and
the in silico TFBS predictions, to identify those sites most
likely to regulate expression of target genes that influence
growth of prostate cancer cells. Regulatory regions with
functional importance can be expected to exhibit
sequence conservation due to selection. Thus, predicted
TFBS that are located in the orthologous positions in mul-

The abundance of overlapping zinc finger TFBS also supported the functional importance of these regulatory
regions. Thus, we identified many TFBS in potential target
genes that were co-expressed with WT1 in prostate cancer
epithelial cells. Evolutionary conserved WT1 and SP1 sites
in the PSA promoter were confirmed by ChIP to bind both
WT1 and SP1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells chromatin.
Although it is a novel discovery that both SP1 and WT1
bind the PSA promoter and may play a role in its regulation, reporter assays are needed to confirm their contribution to transcription. In addition, a WT1 binding site
known to transcriptionally regulate the VEGF promoter
[15] was confirmed by ChIP and found to be in an evolutionary conserved region. Interestingly, transcriptionally
active WT1 and EGR1 binding sites in the AR promoter
[12] were not conserved between human and macaque,
although adjacent genomic regions could be aligned
between multiple species (Figure 4). This suggests that the
AR promoter may have experienced faster turn-over than
the VEGF promoter, yet remained functionally conserved
despite sequence changes at the nucleotide level.
Many of the genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelial
cells have previously been reported to interact and regulate each other, suggesting multiple potential targets for
altered pathways that may lead to prostate cancer progression. We and others have identified gene interactions
[8,14,15,23,41-47] that are consistent with WT1 regulating the progression and/or growth of tumors in the prostate. However, PSA was a candidate gene target identified
by our in silico evolutionary conservation approach and
confirmed by in vivo chromatin binding assays. PSA is a
member of the kallikrein family of serine proteases and is
a marker of epithelial differentiation in the prostate [48].
It is up-regulated in prostate cancer cells when compared
to normal adjacent tissue [49] and its expression is regulated by the ligand bound androgen receptor (AR) [48].
Since WT1 activates the AR promoter in prostate cancer
cells [23], this suggests that WT1 may directly or indirectly
regulate PSA gene expression.
In addition to PSA, genes that were co-expressed with
WT1 in prostate cancer epithelial cells and that could
potentially interact with, or be regulated by, WT1
included GATA2, ECAD, EGR1, and NDRG1 [6]. GATA
binding proteins are zinc finger transcription factors that

Page 9 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:337

bind the WGATAR consensus motif and are expressed in
multiple tissues, including endocrine glands [50-52].
Interestingly, GATA TFs regulate WT1 expression, as multiple GATA TFBS are found within the WT1 promoter and
enhancer regions [53-55]. GATA binding protein 2
(GATA2) has been shown to be one of the main GATA
family members expressed in the prostate of human and
mouse [56]. It has been suggested that GATA2 plays a role
in androgen mediated regulation of PSA expression, possibly through interaction with AR, as GATA sites are adjacent to AR TFBS in the PSA promoter [56]. WT1 could
contribute to GATA2 mediated regulation of target genes
in prostate cancer cells, if WT1 also physically interacts
with GATA2. This notion is consistent with the observation that WT1 interacts with GATA4 to regulate SRY gene
expression [57]. This complex pattern of zinc finger-protein interaction between WT1 and GATA, along with regulation of WT1 expression by GATA TF, suggests a
potential for WT1 feedback control of GATA activity.
The WT1 promoter is itself a target of autoregulation by
WT1 [47]. WT1 is a multifunctional transcription factor;
its four major isoforms are formed by alternative splicing
at two sites resulting in the inclusion or exclusion of (1)
exon V and/or (2) a tripeptide (KTS) in exon 9 that alters
the zinc finger DNA binding structure [58]. While the
functions of the various isoforms of WT1 are still being
discovered, the -KTS isoform is a transcriptional regulator
with G-rich recognition sequence [58]. The +KTS isoform
is also likely to be present in prostate cancer cells but
would contribute to gene regulation via splicing and posttranscriptional gene regulation [59,60]. Here we have
identified potential target genes with well-described DNA
binding sites recognized by the -KTS isoform and have not
assessed the less well understood RNA binding sites recognized by the +KTS isoform [60].
The early growth response 1 gene (EGR1) is a homolog of
WT1 [7]. Although it has only three zinc-fingers, it shares
some TFBS with WT1. EGR1 has been implicated as a cancer suppressor gene and activates genes required for differentiation [7]. In human prostate cancer, EGR1 is overexpressed [11,12] and in a mouse model of prostate cancer, EGR1 regulates genes essential for progression of
tumor growth [61]. Since WT1 regulates the EGR1 promoter in vitro [8] it may indirectly regulate other EGR1 target genes, such as the N-myc downstream regulated gene
1 (NDRG1), an α/β hydrolase. In many cancer cell lines it
has been shown to be up-regulated by both hypoxia and
hormone treatment suggesting that it could be linked to
androgen induced differentiation and signaling in the
prostate [62,63]. Since EGR1 regulates NDRG1, WT1
could either directly or indirectly regulate NDRG1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/337

While analyzing the homologous sequences of the different gene promoters, numerous overlapping TFBS were
found, suggesting competition for binding and differential regulation of these gene promoters. Several studies
have shown that EGR1 and SP1 TFBS often overlap
[7,64,65]. When EGR1 binds to a site also bound by SP1,
it displaces the SP1 "activator" from the binding site and
represses transcription of these genes [7]. For example, the
promoter of NDRG1 was shown to be regulated by an
overlapping EGR1/SP1 binding site [65] (located outside
of the surveyed region of our study). It was shown that
this evolutionary conserved site was vital in positively regulating expression of NDRG1 [65]. Similarly, our results
showed evolutionary conserved overlapping EGR1/SP1
sites in several other gene promoters, including VEGF and
PSA. In the latter, overlapping EGR1/SP1 sites were found
to be conserved between human and two other primate
species (chimpanzee and macaque).
Additionally, WT1 and EGR1 compete for binding at
shared TFBS. WT1 recognizes and binds to EGR1 sites on
the promoters of many different genes [7,9,66-68]. WT1
generally functions as a transcriptional repressor when
bound to EGR1 TFBS in the transforming growth factorbeta 1 (TGFβ1) and EGR1 promoters, while EGR1 functions as an activator [8,9]. Many gene promoters with
overlapping WT1, EGR1, and SP1 binding sites have been
identified (reviewed in [7]). For example, three-way competition occurs between EGR1, SP1 and WT1 for binding
and regulation of superoxide dismutase expression [66].
However, the mechanisms of gene regulation at overlapping sites, including TF competition, are not well understood.
Combinations of adjacent and overlapping EGR1, WT1
and SP1 TFBS conserved between multiple species were
found in multiple gene promoters. Adjacent sites were
found in the PSA promoter where an overlapping EGR1/
SP1 site is 50 base pairs downstream of a WT1 site and in
the VEGF promoter where an EGR1/SP1 overlapping site
is 20 base pairs away from a WT1 site. Such sites can facilitate synergistic interactions or may be required for inducible expression, as described for AR and GATA2
interactions in the PSA promoter [56]. Additionally, in the
VEGF promoter an SP1 site adjacent to a non-canonical
estrogen receptor (ER) TFBS contributes to hormone
induction of VEGF expression [69]. Similarly, WT1
appears to interact with ER at neighboring sites in the
insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) promoter
[70]. These complex arrangements of EGR1, WT1 and SP1
TFBS could facilitate cooperative or competitive binding
by these TFs and would have pleiotropic effects on the regulation of these genes. Genes with evolutionary conserved
overlapping TFBS could be part of a prostate epithelial cell
transcriptome regulated by WT1.

Conclusion
Genes coordinately expressed in prostate cancer epithelial
cells have conserved regulatory elements and an abundance of overlapping zinc finger TFBS. Potential WT1 gene
targets were identified based on TFBS sequence conservation, and the significance of the WT1 TFBS in the PSA promoter was verified in vivo by ChIP assays. Similarly, a
transcriptionally active WT1 binding site in the VEGF promoter was confirmed by ChIP and found to be in a region
conserved amongst primates. Thus, these genes could be
part of a novel network of regulatory pathways initiated
by WT1 and have important implications in the progression of prostate cancer.

Methods
Promoter sequence compilation
For each of the 24 prostate cancer growth regulatory genes
differentially expressed, the complete or draft genomes of
eight different mammalian species were downloaded
from the Ensembl Genome Browser [71,72]. The following genome assemblies were used: the NCBI 36 assembly
of human (Homo sapiens) genome, the NCBI m36 assembly of mouse (Mus musculus) genome, the Pan Tro 2.1
assembly of chimp (Pan troglodytes) genome, a whole
genome shotgun (WGS) preliminary assembly Btau_3.1
of cow (Bos Taurus) genome, a WGS assembly Can Fam2.0
of dog (Canis familiaris) genome, a WGS preliminary
assembly Mmul_1 of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)
genome, the Mon Dom5 assembly of opossum (Monodelphis domestica) genome, and the RGSC3.4 assembly of rat
(Rattus noregicus) genome. Since major regulatory elements are located within several hundred base pairs of
transcription start sites [73], 1.5 kb of human nucleotide
sequence 5' of the translational start site (that is, 5' of the
first exon as defined in Ensembl [72]) was collected.
Orthologous sequences from other mammalian genomes
were obtained from respective genome assemblies. In the
case of the EGR1 promoter this extended beyond 1.5 kb,
so was assigned a negative number. The genome viewer
and annotation program Artemis was used to ensure the
correct context of genomic sequences [74]. In each
sequence, the nucleotide positions were numbered
sequentially, with the targeted promoter region occupying
positions 1 through 1500 (5' to 3' direction) of the forward strand, and ATG start codon located at positions
1501–1503 of the genomic sequence analyzed.

AR and VEGF promoter sequences containing the functional WT1 TFBS for the human AR and VEGF promoters
were obtained from Ensembl (ENSG00000169083 and
ENSG00000112715, respectively). For alignment analyses of known functional sites [14,15], an orthologous promoter region (3 kb) was then collected from eight
mammalian genomes as described above.

TFBS predictions, evolutionary conservation and multiple
sequence alignments
TFBS of WT1, EGR1, SP1, SP2, AP2 and GATA1 were predicted for each gene by the program MatInspector [75]
that utilizes the TRANSFAC libraries of TF binding motifs
[75,76]. The default parameters of similarity thresholds
were used for all examined genes, and they were as follows: core similarity > 0.75 and optimized matrix similarity thresholds (i.e., those that minimize false positives for
each individual matrix as available in the library) [75]. In
MatInspector, core similarity is one of the built-in program parameters that determines whether the observed
sequence match will be analyzed further. It refers to the
four most conserved consecutive nucleotides of the
matrix, usually the most critical sites for protein binding,
and reaches 1.0 only when there is a perfect match
[75,77]. Sequence matches with low core similarity (less
than 0.75) are not, by default, reported to the user. Vertebrate matrices of the Matrix Family Library Version 6.2
(October 2006) that included 464 matrices were used
[78]. Multiple sequence alignments of the promoter
sequences were reconstructed with the program blastZ
using MultiPipMaker [79], and predicted human TFBS
were mapped onto the alignments.

Regions that are conserved in multiple genomes are often
found to correspond to functionally important ones [80].
However, because of the species-specific differences in
gene regulation due to underlying differences in morphogenesis and development, such as those between different
segments of human and rodent prostate [81], it can be
expected that some functionally important regions will be
conserved only in a limited set of genomes where they
play a critical role. Thus, we used a flexible definition of
"evolutionary conservation" to accommodate such potential differences between genes and/or TFBS: here a TFBS
was considered evolutionary conserved if it was predicted
as a respective TFBS in orthologous position in at least
three of eight surveyed genomes. In other words, the same
genomic region was predicted to function as a candidate
binding site for a particular TF in at least 3 surveyed
genomes. Further, because differences in presence/
absence of particular TFB sites between genomes may also
be attributed to differences in the role of respective genes
in each of the organisms, we examined evolutionary conserved sites at different levels of resolution: Human-Primates, Human-Rodents, and Human-Opossum, thereby,
allowing us to identify genes and TFB sites that are functionally relevant to each of these comparisons.
Cell culture and chromatin immunoprecipitation
LNCaP prostate cancer cells (ATCC-CRL 1740) and
human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC-CRL 1573)
were cultured in RPMI or DEM/F12 (HyClone Laboratories, Utah) media, respectively, as described [15]. The

The Farnham ChIP protocol [83] was used with some
modifications. Two million cells were treated with formaldehyde to crosslink proteins to DNA and lysed in PBS-PI
as recommended for the EZ ChIP Assay (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). Lysates were centrifuged and DNA sheared by
sonication (Biosonik III, Bronwill Scientific, Rochester,
NY) to fragments of 100–400 bp in length. The supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with Protein G Agarose
and incubated overnight at 4°C with either SP1 antibody
(Upstate Biotechnology Inc) or WT1 antibody (a mixture
of C19 and N18 polyclonal Abs, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or non-immune IgG. The antibody/protein/DNA

TE as recommended (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). The
complexes were recovered from agarose beads with an
elution buffer, crosslinks were reversed and DNA was

cycles of: 1) 20 sec denaturation at 95°C, 2) 30 sec annealing at either 58°C (for VEGF primers) or 59°C (for AR
and PSA primers) and 3) 30 sec extension at 72°C; amplification was completed with a 2 min final extension at
72°C. PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose gel,
and ethidium bromide stained DNA was visualized by a
gel doc system (BIORAD, CA). Specificity controls are
