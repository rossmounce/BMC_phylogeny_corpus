Abstract
Background: The membranes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 play a central role in photosynthesis,
respiration and other important metabolic pathways. Comprehensive identification of the
membrane proteins is of importance for a better understanding of the diverse functions of its
unique membrane structures. Up to date, approximately 900 known or predicted membrane
proteins, consisting 24.5% of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 proteome, have been indentified by largescale proteomic studies.
Results: To resolve more membrane proteins on 2-D gels for mass spectrometry identification,
we separated integral proteins from membrane associated proteins and collected them as the
integral and peripheral fractions, respectively. In total, 95 proteins in the peripheral fraction and 29
proteins in the integral fraction were identified, including the 5 unique proteins that were not
identified by any previous studies. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the identified proteins can
be functionally classified into 14 distinct groups according to the cellular functions annotated by
Cyanobase, including the two largest groups hypothetical and unknown, and photosynthesis and
respiration. Homology analysis indicates that the identified membrane proteins are more
conserved than the rest of the proteome.
Conclusion: The proteins identified in this study combined with other published proteomic data
provide the most comprehensive Synechocystis proteome catalog, which will serve as a useful
reference for further detailed studies to address protein functions through both traditional geneby-gene and systems biology approaches.

Background
The membrane system of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
(thereafter referred as Synechocystis) is one of the best systems for performing functional membrane proteomic
analysis because of its unique membrane organization.
Synechocystis, a widely used model strain of gram-negative

unicellular cyanobacterium for the studies of photosynthesis and other metabolic processes, has the outer and
plasma membranes as well as an intracellular membrane
system, called the thylakoid [1,2]. The outer and plasma
membranes of Synechocystis contain important proteins
involved in a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake,

Proteome Science 2009, 7:11

secretion, and multidrug efflux pumps and energy transduction while the thylakoid membrane enriches photosynthetic and respiratory proteins [3-6]. A large-scale
functional proteomic analysis can help to identify novel
proteins involved in photosynthesis, respiration and
other cellular processes to extend the current understanding of the fundamental signal transduction and metabolic
pathways. In addition, the 3.57 Mb-genome of Synechocystis was completely sequenced [7] and a total of
3,673 genes including 3,168 genomic genes and 505 plasmid genes were annotated in Cyanobase http://bacte
ria.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/, making it feasible for the
large scale proteomic analysis. Furthermore, Synechocystis
can be easily transformed and has a homologous recombination system, enabling the further functional study of
proteins identified by proteome using reverse genetics
approaches. Although multiple studies have been performed to catalog Synechocystis membrane proteome [36,8-10], it is still a challenge to identify all the membrane
proteins due to their low abundance and low solubility.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with
mass spectrometry has been widely used for global analysis of proteins. However, membrane proteins, especially
integral membrane proteins, remain as difficult for 2-DE
analysis due to their insolubility, high hydrophobicity,
low abundance and/or aggregation during IEF [4,11-13].
Use of different combinations of strong nonionic detergents and chaotropes can increase the solubility of membrane proteins [14,15], whereas separation of membrane
proteins into different compartments can help to enrich
low-abundance membrane proteins [3-5,8]. In addition,
protein prefractionation that reduces sample complexity
and enriches low abundant proteins, combined with the
use of stronger denaturing and reducing reagents compatible for 2-DE running conditions, could be an effective
method to resolve membrane proteins on 2-D gels.
Previously, we identified 51 proteins from the membranes
of Synechocystis by TCA/acetone precipitation and 2-DE,
most of which are membrane associated proteins [6].
Here, we describe a different approach to separate and
enrich integral proteins from membrane associated proteins using high concentration of urea. This approach has
been reported to improve identification of integral proteins from the purified Synechocystis plasma membrane [4]
and thylakoid membrane [5]. Proteins from each fraction
were resolved by 2-DE with multiple pH ranges in the first
dimension and were identified by matrix-assisted laserdesorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry. The results along with other published
proteome data serve as a reference for further studies to
address detailed functions of membrane proteins in a specific physiological context. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the identified proteins are more evolutionally

conserved than the rest of the proteins in the Synechocystis
proteome. Functional classification of these proteins
revealed that the identified membrane proteins are implicated in a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including
the highly represented process, i.e., photosynthesis and
respiration.

Methods
Growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and preparation
of membranes
The wild-type strain of Synechocystis was cultured in BG-11
medium [16] with 5.0 mM glucose under ~40 μmol·m2·s-1 light intensity at 30°C. For membrane preparation,
cells at a late exponential phase were harvested and resuspended in a buffer containing 0.4 M sucrose, 50 mM
MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM
PMSF. Cells were broken using a bead beater and the
membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation
[17,18]. The chlorophyll concentration of each membrane preparation was measured in 80% acetone using a
UV-160 U spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific
Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) [19,20].
Isolation of integral and membrane associated proteins
The membranes were further purified through washing
with 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mM EDTA for 5 times to
remove cytoplasmic proteins. The purified membranes
were first extracted with 8.0 M urea to release the membrane associated proteins, and then centrifuged at 75,600
× g to pellet the insoluble fraction that was enriched with
the integral membrane proteins. The supernatant and the
pellet were collected, respectively. The pellet was further
extracted with 8.0 M urea, and the supernatant of this
extraction was combined with the supernatant from the
first extraction and labeled as the peripheral fraction. Similarly, the insoluble pellet from the second extraction was
labeled as the integral fraction. The peripheral fraction
was diluted four times with deionized water and centrifuged at 75,600 × g to collect the carry-over insoluble fraction; the latter was combined with the previously
collected integral fraction. The proteins in the peripheral
fraction were precipitated by 10% TCA for 30 minutes on
ice. The precipitated proteins were spun down and subsequently extracted with 100% ice-cold acetone to remove
lipids and pigments. The integral fraction was also washed
with ice-cold acetone multiple times until the wash acetone was colorless. Both fractions were dried under a vacuum, solubilized with the multiple surfactant solution
(5.0 M urea, 2.0 M thiourea, 2.0 mM TBP, 2% CHAPS, 2%
sulfobetaine 3–10, 0.5% carrier ampholytes, 40 mM Tris,
0.001% orange G dye), and sonicated for 15 minutes in a
waterbath at 4°C. During this step, nearly all proteins in
the peripheral fraction were dissolved, whereas the integral proteins were only partially solubilized. The insoluble parts in both fractions were removed by centrifugation

at 75,600 × g. Protein concentration of both fractions was
measured with Bio-Rad Dc Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Richmond, CA, USA).
2-DE of membrane proteins
The immobilized pH gradient strips with different pH
ranges (18 cm, pH 3–10, non-linear, pH 4–7, pH 4–5, pH
5–6, Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were rehydrated by 320 μl sample solutions containing approximately 500 μg of proteins from the corresponding
fractions. Active rehydration was accomplished by applying low voltage [21] for 10 hours after 2-hour rehydration
without voltage at 20°C. The first-dimensional IEF for pH
3–10 and pH 4–7 was performed with an IPGphor instrument (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) using the
following voltage settings: 100 V for 0.5 h, 300 V for 0.5
h, 1,000 V for 0.5 h, 2,500 V for 0.5 h, 5,000 V for 0.5 h,
and then 8,000 V until a total of 80,000 Vh was reached.
For narrow pH range IPG (pH 4–5 and pH 5–6), the settings were the same except that a total of 12,000 Vh was
reached. Upon electrophoresis, the proteins on the strips
were denatured and cysteinyl residues were reduced by
equilibrating the IPG strips with a buffer containing 6.0 M
urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol,
5.0 mM TBP, and 2.5% acrylamide monomer for 20 minutes. The second-dimensional electrophoresis was performed using 12–18% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Upon
electrophoresis, the protein spots on the SDS-PAGE gel
were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue
(CBB) and the gels were scanned using GS-800 Calibrated
Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) to
obtain images for analysis by Melanie II software [22,23].
Mass spectrometry
Protein spots that were visualized with CBB were excised
manually and incubated at 37°C with 2.5 mM Tris HCl
(pH 8.5) in 50% acetonitrile to remove the dye bound to
the proteins. The gel pieces were dried under a vacuum
followed by incubation with 10 μl of 10 μg/ml trypsin in
2.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 at 37°C for 18 h. The resulting
tryptic fragments were eluted by diffusion into 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Diffusion of
peptide fragments was facilitated by ultrasonication in a
waterbath at 4°C. One microliter of the tryptic peptides of
each sample was mixed with 1.0 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix prior to be transferred to a 100-well
plate for MALDI-TOF. A Voyager-DE PRO Biospectrometry Workstation was used to acquire mass spectra in a
reflection-delayed extraction mode over a mass range of
600–4,000 Da. The final mass spectra were the accumulation of the spectra obtained from 3–6 positions with 64
shots (total 192–384 shots). If high resolved mass spectra
could not be obtained for a spot, the sample would be
concentrated by drying again using a vacuum followed by
resuspension in 2.5 μl of elution buffer and 2.5 μl of 2.5
mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5). The increased peptide concentra-

tions allowed mass spectral detection of any protein spots
that could be visualized with CBB. Some proteins had
fewer tryptic sites and did not produce enough tryptic
peptides within the mass range 600–4,000 Da for the
identification. For such proteins, spectra within the mass
range 3,000–6,000 Da were also acquired to ensure good
resolution for the spectra between 3,000–5,000 Da. Subsequently, the peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) generated
from the two mass ranges were combined as one PMF file
to search the database. The peptide ions generated by
autolysis of trypsin (with m/z 832.33+, 842.51+, 1045.56+,
2211.10+) were used as the internal standard peaks for
mass calibration. The mass spectra were analyzed and the
PMF for each sample was generated with the Data
Explorer software.
Data analysis
Peptide masses were used to search NCBInr databases
with the MS-Fit program http://prospector.ucsf.edu using
the following parameters: mass tolerance of 25 ppm, a
minimum of two peptides match with one missed cleavage. The identity of proteins with high scores in the MS-Fit
analysis was further validated by three other criteria: mass,
pI and amino acid sequence coverage. The deduced mass
of the putatively identified proteins should match the
apparent mass estimated from the corresponding spots on
the 2-D gel. In the mass comparisons, we considered possible post-translational modifications (PTMs) which
could increase or decrease the mass. The second criterion
is the deduced pI of proteins, which should be close to the
pI estimated from the 2-D gel. Again, the possibility of
PTMs that may change pI was considered. The last criterion is the amino acid sequence coverage which delineates
the ratio of the number of identified amino acid residues
to the total number of amino acid residues for each individual protein. Generally the higher the sequence coverage, the more confident the identification is. However, it
should be noted that the sequence coverage of a protein
strongly depends on the chemophysical property of its
amino acid sequence and the abundance. Sequence coverage information is particularly important for the identification of low molecular weight proteins, e.g. photosystem
I PsaE subunit [82% coverage, see additional file 1],
because their MOWSE scores are usually lower compared
with those of high molecular weight proteins due to the
smaller number of distinct tryptic peptides. In addition to
these criteria, correspondence to each of the identified
proteins in the Cyano2Dbase was also used as a positive
control. If a protein spot is identified as the same protein
represented by a spot in Cyano2Dbase and their coordinates (apparent protein mass and pI) are also matched,
then the identification for this particular protein is considered to be further confirmed.

The motif and domain of hypothetical proteins were predicted by InterPro program http://www.expasy.ch.

Hydropathy analysis for deduced protein sequences was
performed by predicting transmembrane (TM) helices
using TopPred program http://www.expasy.ch. The cut-off
for TopPred scores was set to 0.6 to include only high confident TM prediction [24].
Conservative analysis of Synechocystis proteins
The amino acid sequences of Synechocystis proteins were
retrieved from Cyanobase automatically and saved into a
file in fasta format using an in-house software. The entire
proteome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (thereafter
Arabidopsis) were retrieved from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org). Synechocystis proteins and their Arabidopsis homologs were
analyzed using the software Blastpro [25], which automatically searches the Arabidopsis proteome for the
homolog of each Synechocystis protein.

Results
Prefractionation of membrane proteins
The low abundance of some membrane proteins is one of
the major hindrances to their identification and functional characterization. To analyze the membrane proteome of Synechocystis, we first enriched low abundant
proteins by separating membranes into the peripheral and
integral fractions. The peripheral fraction mainly contains
the membrane associated proteins that were released from
the lipid-bilayer by 8.0 M urea extraction, whereas the
integral fraction mainly contains the integral membrane
proteins that are refractory to the urea extraction. The fractionated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
stained with CBB. The result revealed that the protein
migration patterns of the two fractions are not only different from each other, but also different from those of the
total membrane proteins (Figure 1). The difference of the
protein patterns was exhibited by the different dominant
protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel that are specific to
either fraction, but not both (Figure 1), indicating that the
fractionation is an efficient way to separate membrane
associated proteins from integral proteins, which is in
agree with the literature [4,5]. The 68 kDa major bands
representing high abundant integral proteins PsaA and
PsaB were present only in the lane for the total membrane
proteins but not in the other two lanes, indicating that
these two 11-TM containing highly hydrophobic proteins
were not solubilized by the extraction buffer. In fact, no
report has shown that these proteins can be solubilized in
a buffer compatible for 2-DE. Both the peripheral and
integral fractions contain many high molecular weight
proteins that were not detected in our previous study
using TCA/acetone precipitation of total membranes (Figure 1) [6]. Although the multiple surfactant solution used
here is stronger than the rehydration buffer used in our
previous study [6], detection of more high molecular
weight proteins is more likely due to enrichment of low
abundant proteins by serial extraction rather than the dif-

Separation of integral and membrane associated proteins
Separation of integral and membrane associated proteins. The total Synechocystis membranes were treated with
8.0 M urea to release the membrane associated proteins.
The supernatants containing the released membrane associated proteins were collected as the peripheral fraction after
centrifugation, and the insoluble pellet was collected as the
integral fraction. The proteins in the peripheral fraction were
further precipitated with 10% TCA, washed with ice-cold
acetone, and re-solubilized by the multi-surfactant solution.
The integral proteins were directly washed with acetone and
solubilized with the same volume of multi-surfactant solution.
Equal volume of samples from the peripheral fraction (Lane
P) and the integral fraction (Lane I) were separated by SDSPAGE. Total membranes containing 10 μg of chlorophyll
were used as the loading control (Lane T). All the samples
were incubated with denaturing dye (2% SDS and 0.1 M
DTT) at room temperature for 4 h before separated by SDSPAGE.
ference of solubilizing solution. This is supported by the
observation that the serial extraction resolved more high
molecular weight proteins than TCA/acetone precipitation did even we used the same solution for protein solubilization (unpublished data). Therefore, the serial
extraction is an effective way for enriching low abundant
membrane proteins.
2-D separation and identification of the fractionated
proteins
To further enrich low abundant membrane proteins for
the identification, we separated proteins on 2-D gels with
multiple pH ranges. For the peripheral fraction, we used
four 2-D gels covering pH ranges 3–10, 4–7, 4–5 and 5–6
Page 4 of 12

Proteome Science 2009, 7:11

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/11

(Figure 2). For the integral fraction, we used only two 2-D
gels with pH range 3–10 and 4–7 (Figure 3) because the
sample complexity in this fraction was relatively low compared with the peripheral fraction (Figure 1). Each gel had
three replicates and only the protein spots presented in all
replicates were chosen for PMF identification. In total,
more than 600 protein spots were observed on 2-D gels
for the peripheral fraction, and more than 200 protein
spots were observed on 2-D gels for the integral fraction.
Proteins were identified as previously described [6]. A
total of 112 proteins were identified from 312 spots,
including 95 proteins represented by 249 spots in the
peripheral fraction, and 29 proteins represented by 63
spots in the integral fraction [see additional file 1]. It is
notable that 12 proteins were present in both the fractions. These proteins may contain differential PTMs that
allow different subpopulations of these proteins to differentially associate with the membranes, because PTM
appears to be common for membrane proteins as evidenced by many proteins with multiple isoforms [Figure
2 and 3; see additional file 1]. Nevertheless, the majority
of the identified proteins in the integral fraction were not
found in the peripheral fraction or vice versa, indicating
that the fractionation method is effective. Forty of these
proteins contain multi-isoforms that appeared as multiple-spots with equal mass but different pI values on 2-D

dimension, and then separated by 12–18% gradient SDSPAGE gels for the second dimension. Each gel shown is a
representative of the three replicates that has the best resolution. All the labeled protein spots in the 2-D gels were analyzed by mass spectrometry and identified using peptide mass
fingerprinting.

gels, an indicative of PTMs causing the protein pI shift.
The topology analysis using the software TopPred [6,24]
revealed that 20 out of 29 (69.0%) proteins in the integral
fraction contain at least one TM [see additional file 2],
including the 4-TM containing protein Slr0891. The 9 predicted non-TM containing proteins may either tightly
interact with the membrane embedded proteins, or may
associate with the membranes through post-translationally attached lipid components. For example, the protein
Sll1450 was predicted to be a lipoprotein by the algorithm
LipoP, which correctly predicts 96.8% of lipoproteins in
Gram-negative bacteria [26]. In contrast, 16 out of 95
(16.8%) proteins in the peripheral fraction were predicted
to contain one TM (data not shown). The presence of TM
containing proteins in the peripheral fraction is possibly
due to the cross contamination caused by incompletely
spinning down of insoluble fraction during fractionation.
However, the higher ratio of TM-containing proteins in
the integral fraction strongly suggests that integral membrane proteins were specifically enriched by the serial
extraction approach. The majority of the proteins (77 out
of 112) identified here were not identified in our previous
study, where 51 proteins were identified from the total
membranes without prefractionation [6]. Among the 128
proteins identified by these two studies, 41 proteins were
also described in Cyano2Dbase [27,28]. It should be mentioned that only 5 proteins were exclusively identified by
this study, and the rest of the proteins have been previously identified by others using either 2-DE based proteomic approach or shotgun proteomic approach (see the
discussion).

membrane proteins

photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. Seventy-two, 29,
and 76 proteins have been identified from each purified
membrane by several consecutive studies [3-5,8], respectively. Because we did not separate the membranes into
such three fractions, an identified protein in additional
file 1 may come from any of the three distinct membrane
fractions mentioned above. It should be mentioned that
the proteins identified from our previously work might
come from any of the three distinct membrane fractions
as well [6]. Comparisons of the proteins in additional file
1 and those identified by the above studies revealed that
34 proteins were matched as the thylakoid membrane
proteins [5], 33 proteins were matched as the plasma
membrane proteins [4,8], and 15 proteins were matched
as the outer membrane proteins [3]. Several interesting
observations were also obtained from the comparisons.
First, 11 proteins were matched as both the thylakoid and
plasma membrane proteins, e.g., the subunits of the photosystem I/II complexes and the subunits of ATP synthase
[see additional file 1]. This is not surprising because accumulating evidence suggested that the plasma membrane is
involved in the early steps of the biogenesis of the photosystem [8,29]. Furthermore, membrane vesicles transport
from the plasma membrane to the thylakoid membrane
or vice versa could also facilitate the exchange of the protein components between the two membrane systems
[8,30,31]. Second, 6 proteins were matched as both the
plasma membrane and outer membrane proteins, including two porins (Slr1841, Slr1908) and four hypothetical
proteins (Slr1506, Sll1835, Slr0431 and Slr1270). Finally,
2 proteins were present in all of the three membrane systems, including photosystem II subunit PsbQ (Sll1638)
[32-34] and the iron transport system substrate-binding
protein Slr1295. Both are lipoproteins predicted by LipoP
[26]. The last two observations are intriguing and cannot
simply be explained by the cross contamination of distinct membrane fractions because the data used for the
comparison were generated from the completely separated membrane fractions [3-5,8]. A more reasonable
explanation is that there are interactions or transport
processes between these membrane systems causing the
exchange of the protein components, yet the type and
function of the interactions and transport processes
remain to be further characterized [3,5,8].
In addition to the overlapping proteins whose cellular
locations were determined by aforementioned studies, 54
proteins identified by the current study were not assigned
a subcellular location because they were not identified by
the above studies. Some of these proteins are known to be
the thylakoid membrane associated proteins including
multiple photosystem I and II related proteins, e.g., the
photosystem II subunit PsbU (Sll1194), photosystem II
oxygen-evolving complex 23 K protein PsbP homolog
(Sll1418), and photosystem I assembly related protein

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/11

(Slr0823) [see additional file 1]. The data suggest that the
serial extraction of membrane proteins combined with
narrow pH range 2-DE separation helped to resolve and
identify more Synechocystis membrane proteins.
Functions of the identified membrane proteins
To better understand the functional diversity and importance of the membrane proteins, we analyzed the cellular
function of each identified protein by searching the gene
annotations in Cyanobase [35]. The identified proteins
can be categorized into 14 different functional groups,
which is 87.5% (14 out of 16) of all functional categories
of Synechocystis proteins described in Cyanobase [35].
Except the hypothetical and unknown proteins, the largest
group of the identified proteins is photosynthesis and respiration (Figure 4), which consists of 26.56% (34 out of
128) of the total identified proteins. In this functional
group, some components of the major functional protein
complexes in photosynthetic and respiratory electron
transport chains were identified. For example, in the photosynthetic process, proteins from photosystem I
(Ssl0563, Ssr2831, and Slr0737), photosystem II
(Slr2034, Sll0427, Sll1418, Sll1194, Sll1398, and
Sll1638), cytochrome b6f complex (Sll136, Ssr2998), and
ATP synthase subunits (Sll1326, Sll1325, Sll1324,
Sll1323, and Slr1330) were identified [32-34,36,37],
whereas in the respiratory process, NADH dehydrogenase
subunits (Slr0261, Slr1280, Slr1281, Slr1623, and
Ssl1690) were also identified [21,38-40]. Moreover, multiple phycobilisome subunits were identified, including
the proteins Sll1580, Sll1577, Slr2067, and Slr1986.
These proteins are known to be the thylakoid membrane
associated proteins involved in photosynthesis [41].
Conservative analysis of the identified membrane proteins
Cyanobacteria are considered to be the ancestor of chloroplast in higher plants [42]. In this context, many proteins
are expected to be conserved between Synechocystis and
higher plants, e.g., Arabidopsis, for performing conserved
functions. However, Synechocystis is an independent
organism requiring diversified functions to support life
cycles, whereas the chloroplast of Arabidopsis is a subcellular organelle specialized for a certain type of functions,
e.g., photosynthesis. Therefore, some proteins that are
essential in Synechocystis may not be necessary for the
proper functioning of chloroplast in plants. This functional redundancy may facilitate the release of the selection pressure that favors the conservation of these
proteins, which will gain diversified functions and amino
acid sequences through evolution. To investigate which
proteins are more phylogenically conserved between Synechocystis and Arabidopsis, we performed the conservative
analysis for all Synechocystis proteins by automatically
searching the Arabidopsis proteome using Blastpro, an
automatic Blast software for the analysis of the homology

additional file 1 are grouped into 14 major categories by their functions assigned in Cyanobase. The total number of proteins in
each group and its ratio (percent) to the total number of identified proteins are indicted in the parenthesis.

between two lists of proteins [25,43]. In total, 393
(12.0%), 206 (6.3%), and 81 (2.5%) Synechocystis proteins have homologs in Arabidopsis with minimal
sequence similarity 40%, 50%, and 60% respectively (Figure 5). To investigate the conservation of the membrane
proteins, we performed a similar analysis for the membrane proteins using Blastpro [25]. Of the identified 128
proteins, 30 (23.4%), 17 (13.3%), and 9 (7.0%) proteins
have homologs in Arabidopsis with minimal sequence similarity 40%, 50%, and 60%, respectively (Figure 5). Interestingly, the ratio of the highly conserved proteins, that is,
proteins with minimal sequence similarity 40%, 50% or
60% in the membranes, is much higher than that in the
total proteins (Figure 5). This result suggests that the identified membrane proteins are more evolutionally conserved than the rest of the proteins in the Synechocystis
proteome, probably due to the necessity of the functional
conservation of the corresponding proteins.
Products of the identified hypothetical genes
The genome of Synechocystis contains approximately 50%
hypothetical or unknown genes that encode proteins with
unknown functions. From our current and previous studies [6], we identified a total of 35 (27.34%) hypothetical

and unknown proteins based on the information in
Cyanobase and the literature (Figure 4). The majority of
hypothetical proteins identified are low abundant
because they were shown as weakly-stained spots on 2-D
gels. The low abundance might prevent the previous discovery and functional analysis of these proteins. Several
hypothetical proteins were present as major spots in 2-D
gels with multiple isoforms, for example, the hypothetical
protein encoded by the ORF slr1506, which was shown as
the dominant spots at 68 kDa with 4 isoforms in the 2-D
gel with pH 3–10 [see additional file 1 and Figure 3]. The
unknown functions of these abundant hypothetical proteins may be due to their insolubility in normal aqueous
solutions, which hampers their functional analysis.
To gain preliminary functional information of these
hypothetical proteins, we performed the functional
domain and motif analysis using the computational software InterProScan http://www.expasy.ch. The results
revealed that 12 hypothetical proteins contain one or
more domains and motifs [see additional file 3]. For
examples, the protein encoded by ORF slr1506 has two
domains, including the esterase/lipase/thioesterase
domain and the ATP/GTP-binding site motif A. The este-

Homology analyses for theArabidopsis membrane proteins
Homology analyses for the identified membrane proteins between Synechocystis and Arabidopsis. For the
comparison, the amino acid sequences of the 128 identified
membrane proteins and the entire Synechocystis proteome
were blasted against the entire Arabidopsis proteome using
Blastpro, respectively. The bars represent the ratio (percent)
of the number of Synechocystis proteins that have Arabidopsis
homologs with sequence similarity higher than or equal to
40%, 50%, and 60% relative to the total number of Synechocystis proteins for each comparison.
rase/lipase/thioesterase domain indicates that the protein
has the hydrolase activity whereas the ATP/GTP-binding
site motif A suggests that the activity is driven by the
energy from ATP or GTP. The protein encoded by ORF
slr0038 belongs to the mitochondrial energy transfer protein (carrier proteins) family that are found in the inner
mitochondrial membrane [44-48]. In Synechocystis, the
thylakoid membrane contains the machinery for energy
metabolism such as the photosynthesis and respiration
electron transport chains [38]. Therefore, it is highly possible that the hypothetical protein encoded by slr0038 is a
substrate carrier protein functionally related with the thylakoids.
Functional characterization of these proteins remains a
challenge. Although computational prediction of functional domains of these proteins could partially alleviate
this problem by gaining functional information from the
domains themselves and the proteins that they may interact with, reverse genetic approach to generate gene knockout mutants and relevant biochemical and physiological
characterizations are necessary to understand the detailed
functions of these hypothetical proteins.

Discussion
Membrane proteins contain integral proteins as well as
membrane associated proteins linked to the lipid bilayer

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/11

through direct protein-protein interactions or PTMs (e.g.,
lipid-anchored proteins). The membrane associated proteins can be released using organic solvents [49], high pH
solutions [11,50], or chaotropes [51,52]. Here we used a
high concentration of urea to separate the Synechocystis
membranes into the integral and peripheral fractions; the
latter mainly contains membrane associated proteins.
Detection and identification of many proteins that are
weakly stained on 2-D gels suggest that the fractionation
of the membranes effectively enriched low abundant
membrane proteins [Figure 1, 2, and 3; see additional file
1] probably because these proteins were unable to be
detected in our previous study [6]. Furthermore, the ratio
of TM-containing proteins in the integral fraction is much
higher than in the peripheral fraction, indicating that the
fractionation approach specifically enriched integral
membrane proteins. As stated previously, high concentration of urea has been successfully used to enrich integral
membrane proteins in other studies [4,5]. Collectively,
the data suggest that the high concentration of urea is an
effective way to separate membrane associated proteins
and integral proteins for proteomic studies.
Synechocystis has its unique membrane and soluble compartments. The membrane compartments can be separated
into the outer, plasma and thylakoid membranes whereas
the soluble compartments can be separated into the periplasm, cytoplasm and lumen [53]. All the membrane and
lumenal spaces have their unique protein compositions,
which are related to their specific functions in each subcellular location. It is of importance to precisely identify the
subcellular locations of proteins, where their functions can
be predicted. A number of studies have been recently
reported to analyze the Synechocystis proteome. These studies were focused on proteins either in specific subcellular
locations including the outer membrane [3,53], plasma
membrane [4,8,10,53,54], thylakoid membrane [5,53],
periplasm [53,55,56], or cytoplasm [56], or in the more
general locations [57] such as membrane fraction
[6,58,59], soluble fraction [60-62], or both [27,28,63-67].
To summarize these works and catalog the proteins with
known or predicted subcellular locations, we generated a
table [see additional file 4] that contains all the Synechocystis proteins identified based on the references above
and the proteins identified in this study. In total, about
47.3% of Synechocystis proteome (1,738 proteins) have
been identified [see additional file 4]. Specific subcellular
locations of 173 identified proteins (10.0%) are determined (outer membrane: 10 proteins; plasma membrane:
75 proteins; periplasm: 52 proteins; thylakoid membrane:
36). For the rest of 1,565 proteins, they either have more
than one locations in a cell or their exact location(s) has
(have) not been determined by experiments. The proteins
with undetermined cellular localizations were assigned as
predicted membrane (PM)- or predicted soluble (PS)-proteins based on the TM prediction by TopPred [see addiPage 8 of 12

Proteome Science 2009, 7:11

tional file 4] [24]. Among the 1,738 proteins, 1,291
proteins (74.3%) were uniquely identified by LC-MS/MS
based shotgun proteomic approach [63-67]. The remaining
447 proteins were identified either uniquely by 2-DE based
proteomic approach, or by both. Shotgun proteomic
approach provides unprecedented power in protein identification and the majority of the proteins in additional file 1
were also identified by this approach. However, five new
proteins identified in the current study have never been
identified in any previous proteomic studies, including
phosphate transport ATP-binding protein PstB (Sll0684),
transcriptional repressor SmtB (Sll0792), and three hypothetical proteins (Sll1630, Sll1862, and Slr1053) [see additional file 1]. Identification of these new proteins is more
likely due to the protein prefractionation that reduces sample complexity and enriches low abundant proteins. Therefore, we expect that sample prefractionation combined
with LC-MS/MS based shotgun proteomics would provide
higher coverage in proteome identification in the future.
In spite of the collective efforts in cataloging the Synechocystis proteome, 52.7% of the proteome (1,935 proteins) has not been identified so far [see additional file 5].
Multiple possibilities could account for the failure of
identification for these proteins (i) some proteins are transiently expressed responding to a specific internal or external signal; (ii) proteins with high hydrophobicity or low
abundance are generally difficult to be identified (iii)
some proteins may not even express. The identified Synechocystis proteome contains 38.7% hypothetical and
unknown proteins (673/1,738) [see additional file 6]. In
contrast, the unidentified Synechocystis proteome contains
much higher percent of hypothetical and unknown proteins (1,284/1,935 = 66.4%) [see additional file 7], suggesting that some of hypothetical and unknown proteins
might not express. However, experimental evidences are
still needed to verify their expression.
Collectively, the information on these identified proteins
can be used as a reference for any studies targeting at
mechanisms of important biological processes of Synechocystis, such as signal transduction cascades stimulated
by a specific stimulus. In fact, some proteins were identified from Synechocystis under such physiological conditions including heat shock [62], salt stress [10,64], acid
stress [56], or heterotrophic condition [60]. In addition,
this information can be used for bioinformatic and computational analyses of Synechocystis proteome. For example, N-terminal features have been predicted for the outer
and plasma membranes, the periplasm, and the thylakoid
lumenal proteins using a combined proteomic and multivariate sequence analysis [53].
As mentioned earlier, the purified membranes in the current study contain the thylakoid membrane as well as the
plasma membrane and outer membrane since we did not

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/11

specifically isolate each type of the membrane. However,
the abundance of the thylakoid membrane is orders of
magnitude higher than that of the plasma membrane and
outer membrane [68]. Therefore, the majority of the
membrane proteins are predicted to be associated with
the thylakoid membrane instead of the plasma or outer
membranes. In fact, more than 50% of the proteins with
the assigned subcellular locations [3-5,8] in additional file
1 are specific to the thylakoid membrane. This ratio allows
us to deduce that the majority of the proteins in additional file 1 without the assigned subcellular locations
may be also specific to the thylakoid membrane.
Among the proteins in additional file 1, 34 identified proteins are involved in the processes of photosynthesis and
respiration. This group consists of 26.56% of the total
identified membrane proteins, whereas only 3.89% of the
whole Synechocystis proteome belong to this group. The
data suggest that these proteins are highly abundant in the
Synechocystis membranes, indicating that one of the major
functions of the Synechocystis membranes is photosynthesis and respiration. Besides these proteins, the proteins
involved in the process of translation are also highly represented, including the elongation factor EF-Tu and ribosomal proteins [see additional file 1 and Figure 4]. This is
not surprising because ribosomes target to the thylakoid
membrane when membrane-targeting proteins are synthesized in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher
plants [69,70].
One of the interesting findings from our study is that the
identified membrane proteins are more conserved than
the other proteins in Synechocystis, suggesting that the
membrane proteome is more conserved than the rest of
the proteome. The protein sequence conservation through
evolution ensured the conservation of one of the major
functions of the membranes, photosynthesis, between
Synechocystis and the chloroplasts of higher plants that
shares the nearly identical mechanism for the photosynthetic electron transport on the thylakoid membrane [71].

Conclusion
By using the serial extraction approach to separate membranes into the peripheral and integral fractions, we identified 112 membrane proteins from Synechocystis. The
identified proteins are involved in 14 distinct groups of
functions, which is an indicative of the diversified functions of the Synechocystis membrane system. Conserved
analysis revealed that membrane proteins are evolutionally more conserved than soluble proteins, suggesting that
membranes may perform more conserved functions
through evolution.
Although the 2-DE based proteomic approach used here
is less robust compared with the LC-MS/MS based shotgun proteomic approach, five of the proteins identified in
Page 9 of 12

Proteome Science 2009, 7:11

this study were not identified previously by any shotgun
proteomic studies, indicating that sample prefractionation is important for the identification of low abundant
proteins. Therefore, we suggest that sample prefractionation combined with LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomic
approach would achieve higher proteome coverage in
protein identification.
The proteins identified in this study, together with previously identified proteins by others [3-5,8,10,27,28,5367], will provide the most comprehensive database to
date for the identified Synechocystis proteins. This database
will serve as a useful reference for future studies to understand the mechanisms of basic biological processes of this
photosynthetic organism.
