Abstract
Background: Although cis-regulatory changes play an important role in evolution, it remains
difficult to establish the contribution of natural selection to regulatory differences between species.
For protein coding regions, powerful tests of natural selection have been developed based on
comparisons of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, and analogous tests for regulatory
regions would be of great utility.
Results: Here, tests for natural selection on regulatory regions are proposed based on nucleotide
substitutions that occur in characterized transcription factor binding sites (an important type
functional element within regulatory regions). In the absence of selection, these substitutions will
tend to reduce the strength of existing binding sites. On the other hand, purifying selection will act
to preserve the binding sites in regulatory regions, while positive selection can act to create or
destroy binding sites, as well as change their strength. Using standard models of binding site
strength and molecular evolution in the absence of selection, this intuition can be used to develop
statistical tests for natural selection. Application of these tests to two well-characterized regulatory
regions in Drosophila provides evidence for purifying selection.
Conclusion: This demonstrates that it is possible to develop tests for selection on regulatory
regions based on the specific functional constrains on these sequences.

Background
The importance of cis-regulatory regions in the evolution
of complex organisms is increasingly appreciated
(reviewed in [1] and [2]), and general understanding of
the molecular evolution of these sequences has grown
rapidly [3-13]. An important outstanding question is
whether natural selection has driven evolutionary
changes in cis-regulatory regions, or whether these result
from non-adaptive processes [14].
Many tests for natural selection can be applied to noncoding DNA and several important studies have identified

signatures of natural selection in well-characterized
regulatory regions (reviewed in [15]). Tests for selection
on differences between species often compare the ratio of
substitutions in transcription factor binding sites (an
important class of functional element within cis-regulatory
regions) to the surrounding non-coding DNA [16]. These
tests are modelled after tests on coding regions that
compare the patterns of amino acid changing differences
to synonymous differences, which are amongst the most
widely used and most powerful tests to detect the effects of
natural selection on individual protein coding genes [17].
However, in applying these tests to binding sites, several

important caveats must be considered [15]. In particular, it
must be assumed that all of the functional elements in a
regulatory region have been characterized, and that these
remain constant in all species considered.
Here I develop a new approach to detect selection on
individual cis-regulatory regions that takes advantage of
the specificity of transcription factors to assign functional impact to nucleotide changes in binding sites.
Recently, evolutionary analyses of large sets of transcription factor binding sites have highlighted the importance
of considering the binding affinity or strength of the
binding sites for their appropriate transcription factor
[10,11,13,18]. Specifically, sequence differences in transcription factor binding sites can increase protein-DNA
affinity, decrease it, or have no effect. In the absence of
selection, fixation of random mutations will tend to
decrease the strength of binding sties [19,20], whereas
purifying selection will tend to preserve binding sites,
such that the effects of subsequent fixations will cancel
out [18]. On the other hand, though binding sites can
arise in regulatory sequences as a result of the action of
positive selection [19-21] or through genetic drift alone
[22], I show that an increase in binding affinity on
average is not expected in the absence of selection. I
therefore propose to use the distribution of changes in
strength of transcription factor binding sites to develop
tests for natural selection on regulatory regions where
the binding sites have been identified.
I analyze the fixed differences in two well-characterized
regulatory regions in Drosophila (the hb anterior activator
and the eve stripe 2 enhancer). These tests reveal
statistical evidence for conservation of cis-regulatory
information, which is consistent with the known
conservation of function of these regulatory sequences.

Results
Quantifying the effects of substitutions in regulatory
regions
Motivated by the power of tests for natural selection that
exploit the constraints imposed on coding sequences by
the genetic code, I sought to develop a test for natural
selection on regulatory regions that takes into account
the specific constraints on these regions: binding by
transcription factors. Using standard matrix models for
DNA binding specificity (known as Position Weight
Matrices or Position Specific Scoring Matrices [23]), the
binding energy of the interaction between a transcription
factor and DNA is given by a sum of independent
contributions from each residue at each position [23].
An estimate of the relative affinity or ‘strength’ a
transcription factor binding site X of length w for its
binding protein can be quantified using

Where Xib = 1 if the sequence X is nucleotide b at position
i and 0 otherwise, fib is the probability of observing
nucleotide b at position i in a binding site for a
transcription factor (from the specificity matrix), and gb
is the probability of observing nucleotide b in the
genomic background distribution [23].
Alternatively, the strength of the transcription factor
binding sites in a region can be considered the regulatory
information in that region, and the formula above can
be motivated by information theoretic arguments [23].
Note that the framework and tests for selection presented
here can equally be applied to information contained in
the cis-regulatory region as to binding affinity. However,
because recent work has focused on binding affinity
(e.g., [11,13]) this work is presented from that perspective.
In order to quantify the effects of evolutionary changes
in binding sites, I consider the effect of a single
nucleotide change. In this case I define

⎛ f ⎞

ΔS iab = log ⎜ ib ⎟ − log ⎜ ia ⎟
⎝ gb ⎠
⎝ ga ⎠

associated with a change from base a to base b (a, b in
{A, C, G, T}) where, once again, i is the position in the
motif, g are background probabilities, and f are the
probabilities in the specificity matrix model. Extending
these methods to the general case of arbitrary numbers
of substitutions is an area for further research (see
Discussion).
The effect of substitutions on binding sites in
the absence of selection
Most random mutations will decrease the strength of a
transcription factor binding site, and therefore substitutions in the absence of selection will tend to decrease the
affinity [19,20]. This follows from the fact that high
affinity binding sites represent a small fraction of the
possible sequences of a particular length. Since a
substitution process that operates independently at
each position in the sequence will tend to explore the
majority sequence space, sequences that currently
represent binding sites are much more likely to move
away from these regions of sequence space than to
remain in the relatively small regions of sequence space
that represent binding sites. This implies that on average
ΔS should be negative in the absence of selection. To
illustrate this, I simulated the evolution of a binding site
for Bcd (a developmental transcription factor in Drosophila whose specificity is well-characterized) under an

Figure 1
Changes in binding site strength in the absence of
selection. a) shows time courses for the strength of a
transcription factor binding site (S) in a simulation of
evolution without selection. The strength of a real binding
site (dotted trace) usually decreases from the strength
expected for real binding sites (E[S|motif]) to that expected
under background residue frequencies (E[S|bg]). An example
of a binding site created from background sequence in the
absence of selection (solid trace) is also shown. b) shows the
probability (p) of observing a change in score of size ΔS given

HKY model (dotted trace in Figure 1a). The strength (S)
of the binding site begins high (near the expected value
of S for binding sites) and decays as substitutions
eventually hit the critical residues. Consistent with this,
the distribution of the changes in score (ΔS) is
concentrated on values less than zero (dotted trace in
Figure 1b).
The effect of substitutions in binding sites under selection
In contrast, in functionally constrained regulatory
regions, purifying selection will preferentially remove
nucleotide changes that greatly alter the affinity of the
binding sites [6,13]. When these substitutions do
become fixed (albeit rarely), positive selection will
tend to fix additional nucleotide changes that restore
the binding affinity [18]. This process will tend to
preserve the binding affinity, and ΔS will therefore tend
to be zero if the regulatory region is under functional
constraint.

Finally, consider adaptive evolution, which could have
arbitrary effects on ΔS. For example, new transcription
factor binding sites could be created from background
sequence through successive adaptive fixations that
increase binding site strength; this would lead to an
increase in S, and therefore ΔS would be greater than zero
on average. However, because new binding sites can also
appear by genetic drift [21,22] it is possible that ΔS can be
greater than zero in the absence of selection. To illustrate
this, I simulated a background sequence of length equal
to the Bcd binding site under the same HKY model as
above, and found examples where binding sites arose in
the absence of selection (Figure 1a solid trace). I argue
that, although arbitrarily strong binding sites (high values
of S) can be generated in the absence of selection, the
distribution of changes in score (ΔS) is specified by the
substitution process. Interestingly, since evolution in
the absence of selection is unbiased with respect to the
strength of the binding site, the distribution of changes in
score is symmetric, with mean equal to zero (Figure 1b
solid trace). This indicates that in the absence of selection,
in background sequences we expect changes in score to
cancel out. Therefore, while the creation of binding sites
from background sequence cannot be considered evidence for positive selection, if the distribution of ΔS
observed is statistically different from the pattern
expected in the absence of natural selection, this can
only be consistent with adaptive evolution.
Creation of new binding sites in regulatory regions is an
intuitive case of adaptive regulatory evolution. However,
depending on the situation, natural selection could also
favour mutations that remove functional binding sites
within a regulatory region, thus leading to an average ΔS
of less than zero. Therefore, although a decrease in S on
average is expected in the absence of selection, it could
also occur in the presence of selection. Nevertheless, if ΔS
is more negative than expected in the absence of
selection, we have evidence that natural selection must
be acting to remove binding sites.
In summary, for substitutions in a set of characterized
binding sites we expect:
ΔS < 0 in the absence of constraint or adaptive
destruction of binding sites
ΔS = 0 in the presence of functional constraint
ΔS > 0 during the creation of new binding sites (due to
selection or genetic drift)
Statistical tests for natural selection in regulatory regions
An attractive feature of using ΔS for a single substitution

regulatory regions is that its distribution can be
computed exactly under standard models of molecular
evolution in the absence of selection (see Methods,
Figure 1b). I therefore propose to use the distribution of
ΔS to test for the presence of natural selection on
regulatory regions. If the distribution of ΔS is significantly different from that expected in the absence of
selection, we can rule out the null hypothesis of
evolution in the absence of selection.
Here I consider the tests for selection in the following
cases.
1. If the observed ΔS in real binding sites is greater on
average than ΔS expected for binding sites in the
absence of selection, this indicates purifying selection
to retain binding sites.
2. If the observed ΔS in real binding sites is less on
average than ΔS expected for binding sites in the
absence of selection, this indicates adaptive destruction of binding sites.
3. If the observed ΔS in real binding sites is greater on
average than the ΔS expected for binding sites arising
from background sequence in the absence of selection, this indicates adaptive creation of new sites.
Case 1: Here the pattern of evolution is consistent with
purifying selection to preserve the function of the
binding sites in the regulatory region. To rule out the
null hypothesis of no constraint, we must compare
the observed values of ΔS to the distribution of ΔS in
sequences we know to be transcription factor binding
sites, but in the absence of selection.
In the case of binding sites evolving in the absence of
constraint:

and Pab is the probability of substitution between bases a
and b (i.e., a, b in {A, C, G, T}), computed under a
standard model of molecular evolution, such that P = eRt
where R are the instantaneous rates of substitution and t

is time (see Methods). The dotted trace in Figure 1b
shows the distribution of ΔS for binding sites evolving in
the absence of constraint.
In a practical setting, we expect to have observed some
relatively modest number (N) of substitutions in
characterized binding sites. Therefore, in order to test
the significance of a set of observed ΔS values, I propose
the statistic:

1 N
ΔS k − E[ΔS]
∑
N k =1
Z=
V [ΔS]
N

(6)

where k indexes N observed values of ΔS.
Since we can compute the mean and variance of ΔS
under standard models of evolution (see Methods),
according to the central limit theorem this statistic
should be normally distributed with mean = 0 and
variance = 1(the standard normal) under the hypothesis
that the model of evolution is correct. We can therefore
perform a one-tailed test that the observed mean is
greater than that expected in the absence of selection.
I sought to confirm that the distribution of this statistic
was as expected, particularly in the case of small N (few
observed substitutions in binding sites) which is typical
of real datasets. To simulate the null hypothesis of
binding sites evolving in the absence of constraint,
I simulated molecular evolution of the 6 real Bcd sites
in the hb anterior activator under an HKY model with
the transition-transversion rate ratio estimated from the
alignment of the hb anterior activator (see methods)
and evolutionary distance scaled so that we would
observe approximately 5 substitutions in the 6 binding
sites. I computed Z using E[ΔS] and V[ΔS] either under
this model, and I observed good agreement with
the expected standard normal behavior (Figure 2,
‘exact’).
Case 2: If we wish to test for adaptive destruction of
transcription factor binding sites in a regulatory region,
the average of ΔS should be significantly less than
expected in the absence of selection. To test for this, we
can perform a one tailed test using the statistic defined
above, but in the opposite direction.
Case 3: If the average ΔS in a regulatory region is greater
than 0, we wish to test whether the average ΔS is greater
than we would expect to observe in the absence of
selection. Now the null hypothesis is that the average
increase in binding affinity we have observed is due

adaptive evolution. For example, for the 20 substitutions
shown in Figure 1a (solid trace) the average ΔS is 0.45,
which gives Z = 0.97 and is not significant. Thus,
although there is a large change in S, the pattern of
changes is consistent with the absence of selection.
An approximation to the distribution of ΔS
Under substitution models with no transition-transversion bias [24], the distribution of ΔS does not depend on
evolutionary distance. For example, I can show (see
Methods) that for binding sites evolving in the absence
of selection,

hypothesis. In a simulation of molecular evolution under
the null hypothesis (see text for details) the statistic
proposed shows good agreement with the expected

mean and variance of ΔS computed exactly (unfilled bars) or
in the long-time limit (filled bars). Inset is a comparison of the
P-value as computed under the standard normal assumption

observed in 1000 simulations, using either the exact (Xs) or

exactly, and the mean and variance are:

A similar, albeit more complicated expression is available for the variance (see Methods). These expressions
depend only on the equilibrium probabilities of the four
nucleotides and the probabilities in the specificity matrix
model for the transcription factor.
In the general case, the distribution of ΔS depends very
weakly on the evolutionary distance (Figure 3a) and only
somewhat more strongly on the transition-transversion
bias (Figure 3b). It is therefore possible to obtain a good
approximation of the distribution of ΔS using the
formulas obtained under the simpler substitution
models. I refer to this approximation of the distribution
of ΔS as the ‘long-time limit’ because it becomes exact in
the limit of long evolutionary time even in the presence
of transition-transversion bias (Figure 3). As expected,
using the long-time limit E[ΔS] and V[ΔS] when
calculating the Z statistic described above also gives the
standard normal behaviour (Figure 2, ‘Long time limit’).
Thus, this approximation allows application of tests
based on the distribution of ΔS without estimates or
assumptions about the evolutionary process in the
absence of selection.

b≠a

The solid trace in Figure 1b shows this distribution. This
distribution is symmetric, and the expectation is zero.
This follows from the fact that the substitution processes
in the absence of selection is unbiased with respect to the
binding site strength, and that the residue frequencies in
background genomic sequence are assumed to be drawn
from the equilibrium of the substitution process. The
means and variances can be used to form a Z-statistic as
illustrated above, and simulations again confirm the
expected distribution of the statistic (data not shown). If
the observed average ΔS is significantly greater than
expected in the absence of selection, we find evidence for

Application to the hb anterior activator
The hb anterior activator (Figure 4a) responds to the Bcd
gradient in the early D. melanogaster embryo [25]. It is
thought to have been conserved since the divergence of D.
melanogaster and D. virilis [26] and contains well-defined
binding sites for Bcd [27]. We therefore expect to see
evidence of functional constraint on this regulatory region.

Using D. virilis and D. pseudoobscura as outgroups, I
identified 10 substitutions in the alignment of the 6
well-characterized Bcd binding sites (Figure 4b) and used
equation 2 above to compute ΔS for each substitution
(Table 1). The average ΔS for these substitutions was

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:286

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/286

I noted that 3 substitutions had occurred in a single
binding site on a single lineage (A3, Table 1) and was
concerned that this might indicate that the assumption
of single substitutions at each site was invalid on this
lineage. I therefore performed the test excluding these
substitutions and found similar results (Table 2). I also
found evidence for constraint when excluding substitutions along the relatively long branch leading to the
melanogaster group. Noting that removing the substitutions led to an average ΔS for the region greater than 0, I
tested for evidence for adaptive creation of binding sites
in this regulatory region (case 3). However, performing
the test above (equations 7-9) yielded Z = 0.22, which is
not significant, indicating that the observed increase in
binding strength could have been observed in the
absence of selection.
More complex regulatory regions
The hb anterior activator serves as a good test case for this
method because it contains multiple binding sites for the
same transcription factor. However, in general regulatory
regions contain multiple binding sites for multiple
different transcription factors. Note that the arguments
above regarding the expected ΔS in regulatory regions
apply regardless of whether the binding sites are for a
single transcription factor or many different transcription
factors.

Figure 3
Dependence of the distribution of ΔS on evolutionary
parameters. a) shows the probability distribution of ΔS as
evolutionary distance varies (coloured solid traces) for the
Bcd matrix under an HKY model with transitiontransversion rate ratio set to 2. The distribution rapidly
converges to the long-time limit distribution (dotted trace).
b) shows the probability distribution of ΔS as the transitiontransversion rate ratio (kappa) varies (coloured solid traces)
for the Bcd matrix under an HKY model with evolutionary
distance set equal to 0.3 substitutions per site. Once again,
the distribution converges to the long-time limit (dotted
trace). Inset in both is the convergence of the mean of ΔS
(squares) to the long-time limit (dotted trace). Distributions
are for real binding sites evolving in the absence of selection.
-0.31(s.d. = 1.07). To test for functional constraint (case 1),
I used equations 3-5 above to compute E[ΔS] = -1.61
and V[ΔS] = 2.77 for the Bcd matrix, using as the null
hypothesis an HKY model with parameters (kappa = 2.26
and total evolutionary distance = 0.36 subs) estimated
from an alignment of the entire regulatory region (see
Methods). The test above yields Z = 2.48, which is significant
with P-value < 0.01 (Table 2). As expected, similar results
are obtained using the long-time limit distribution of ΔS
(Table 2).

To extend the statistical test to regulatory regions with
multiple binding sites for different factors, two
approaches are possible. If enough substitutions in
each type of binding site are present, the test above can
be performed for each type, and then their results can be
combined. However, in the case of few substitutions, it
may be preferable to pool the substitutions first. To do
so, we must compute the distribution of ΔS expected
from a mixture of transcription factor binding sites. ΔS is
now drawn from a v component mixture model,
v

p(ΔS) =

where v is the number of types of transcription factor
binding sites, πi is the probability that the substitution
occurred in the j-th type, and p(ΔS)j is the distribution of
ΔS for the j-th type of binding motif. We can compute
these πj for any regulatory region given the numbers of
each type of binding site in a characterized regulatory
region (see Methods):

we can apply the test suggested above in the mixture case
as well. Once again, we can obtain a good approximation to this distribution using the long-time limit. To
confirm the distribution of the test statistic proposed
above in the case of mixtures of binding sites, I again
performed simulations under the null hypothesis of no
constraint, this time using the 6 Kr sites and 5 Bcd sites
in the eve stripe 2 enhancer, and once again found the
expected standard normal behavior (data not shown).
Application to the eve stripe 2 enhancer
The individual binding sites in the eve stripe 2 enhancer
are well-characterized [28,29] and this enhancer exemplifies complex cis-regulatory sequences in that it contains
multiple binding sites for multiple transcription factors
[30]. Here I consider the 5 Bcd binding sites and 6 Kr
binding sites to illustrate the application of the test for
selection to a complex regulatory region (see Additional
file 1 for alignments of these binding sites). Two of the Kr
and Bcd binding sites the eve stripe 2 enhancer overlap,

associated ΔS values (Table 3). The average ΔS for all the
substitutions was -0.23, and I performed the test described
above with evolutionary distance and transition-transversion rate ratio estimated from the alignment of the eve
stripe 2 enhancer (see methods). Using equations 11-14,
I computed the distribution of ΔS for 6 Kr sites and 5 Bcd
sites evolving in the absence of constraint. This yields
E[ΔS] = -1.56 and V[ΔS] = 2.53, and provides evidence for
constraint (case 1) on the regulatory sequence with Z =
2.53 and P-value = 0.0004 (Table 4).

and I excluded two substitutions that affect the strength of
more than one binding site (Table 3).
This left 16 substitutions (9 in bcd binding sites and 7 in Kr
binding sites) for which I used equation 2 to compute

Although its function has been conserved over evolution
[31], the eve stripe 2 enhancer has undergone some
linage specific evolution [32], as well as gained and lost
individual binding sites; its evolution is characterized by
rapid sequence divergence [31,33]. Consistent with this,
the alignments of D. pseudoobscura for BC-3 were not
possible, as this site seems to have appeared recently
[32]. Within the closely related species in the melanogaster subgroup, BC-3 contains seven inferred substitutions, four of which are inferred to occur along the
lineage leading to D. yakuba. In addition to the rapid
divergence of BC-3, I again found cases where more than
one substitution had occurred along the D. ananassae
lineage in a single binding site. In addition, I therefore
performed the tests excluding lineages with multiple
substitutions, or excluding BC-3 entirely. In all cases
there is still sufficient power to provide statistical
evidence against the null hypothesis of no constraint
(table 4). In no case could I find evidence for adaptive
evolution (case 2 or case 3, data not shown).

Discussion and Conclusion
A new test for natural selection on regulatory regions
One of the difficulties in many current evolutionary
analyses of cis-regulatory regions is that it is difficult to
choose an appropriate set of unconstrained sites to which to
compare the functional regulatory sites. In general, studies
either choose the rate of substitution in surrounding

non-coding sequence [16] or in synonymous sites in
adjacent protein coding regions [34]. Both assumptions
may be problematic. The former assumes that the surrounding DNA is under no functional constraint (as opposed to
some unknown constraints). In the latter case, because noncoding sequences show larger numbers of insertions and
deletions than coding regions, it is not always clear that rate
estimates based on alignments of coding and non-coding
regions can be directly compared.
Tests based on the distribution of ΔS, such as those
proposed here, do not rely on these assumptions, as they
consider only substitutions that occur in binding sites.
Practically, this is an attractive feature of these tests, as
they only require accurate alignments of the binding
sites, which are generally more reliable than alignments
of unconstrained non-coding DNA [35].
Another attractive feature of tests based on the distribution of ΔS in the absence of selection is that they make
few assumptions about the nature of selection on
binding sites. For example, it is not assumed that
binding sites are all under the same strength of selection,
or that they all have the same binding affinity - only the
changes in strength of binding are important. Further,
even under a stabilizing selection model, where binding
sites for a given transcription factor are gained and lost
over evolution [33], ΔS will be zero on average if the
total output of the regulatory sequence is preserved: the
negative ΔS associated with the binding site loss will be
compensated by positive ΔS associated with the binding
site gain. However, if binding sites for one transcription
factor are replaced by binding sites for another, ΔS may
no longer be zero on average and testing for selection in
this case is an area for further research.
Practical considerations, limitations and future
improvements
Application of these tests to two well-characterized
regions demonstrates that they have enough power to

detect constraint on individual regulatory regions with
~ 10 substitutions in binding sites, and perhaps even as
few as 5 or 6 substitutions (tables 2 and 4). However,
application to the eve stripe 2 enhancer illustrates several
practical difficulties: First, I didn’t include the Hb
binding sites in this enhancer [36] because these binding
sites contain homopolymeric runs, and it is difficult to
assign a ‘position’ to a substitution; ΔS cannot be reliably
computed for each substitution in this case. Second,
although the eve stripe 2 enhancer has characterized sites
for Gt, I did not include these because the sequence
specificity of this transcription factor is poorly characterized. Third, the eve stripe 2 enhancer contains substitutions in overlapping binding sites, for which it is not
clear how to calculate ΔS; these were therefore excluded
from the analysis. Finally, the distribution of ΔS is
sensitive to the estimation of the frequency parameters
in the specificity matrix. For example, I excluded the Bcd
binding sites in the eve stripe 2 enhancer and reconstructed the Bcd matrix for analysis of that regulatory
region. If the binding sites in the regulatory region of
interest are included in the estimation of the specificity
matrix, there is a potential for circularity in the analysis.
Thus, the tests require (i) well-characterized transcription
factor binding specificity and (ii) confident alignment of
a binding site to a single specificity matrix. None of these
constraints are present for tests that compare binding
sites to surrounding regions or synonymous sites [16,34]
or for tests of natural selection based on spacing between
conserved blocks [35-37]. However, rapid advances in
methods to characterize DNA-protein interactions are
making specificity information available for large numbers of transcription factors [38-40]. Among these are
methods that yield information about binding to each
sequence, such that the assumption of independent
contributions to binding of each DNA base in the
binding site could in principle be relaxed [38,41].
In addition, the tests I have proposed assume that only a
single substitution has occurred at any position in
binding sites. Although for most of the data analyzed

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:286

here this assumption seems valid, I noted several cases
were multiple substitutions occurred on a single lineage,
suggesting the possibility of ‘multiple hits’ at a single
site. Furthermore, there is clear evidence of insertions
and deletions occurring near or within the binding sites
considered here. These are likely to affect their binding
affinity, but are not included in the null model of
molecular evolution in the absence of selection. More
sophisticated models of molecular evolution [42] may
be able to account for these effects, and these could be
applied in this framework. Similarly, the evolutionary
models here do not account for di-nucleotide substitution bias, particularly the elevated rate of CpG to TpG
found in mammals; these could be included using an
improved null model [43,44].
Finally, I note that I have suggested one simple statistical
test based on the observed average ΔS, however many
tests based on distribution of ΔS are possible. For
example, purifying selection might also be expected to
reduce the variance of ΔS. Indeed, in the case of the Bcd
sites in the hb anterior enhancer, the observed variance of
ΔS is less than expected, though this difference is not
significant (e.g., 1.15 vs. 2.86, n = 10, chi-square test P =
0.089). Determining what tests have the most power to
detect various types of selection in regulatory regions is
an area for further research. In general, however, it seems
very likely that tests that consider the effects of
substitutions on transcription factor binding site affinity
will facilitate the detection of adaptive evolution in
regulatory regions.

Methods
Construction of motif matrices
I used publically available compilations of characterized
binding sites for Bcd and Kr [33,45] to construct
specificity matrices using a pseudocount of 1 per position.
Throughout this study, I use as the background distribution (gA, gC, gG, gT) = (0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3) which is close to
the observed nucleotide probabilities in drosophila noncoding DNA. In order to avoid the possibility of
circularity, for analysis of each regulatory region I
excluded the characterized sites from that region and
reconstructed the matrix, such that (for example) Bcd sites
from the hb anterior activator were not included in the
matrix used for analysis of the hb anterior activator. These
matrices were used to compute ΔS for each substitution
(Tables 1 and 3) and E[ΔS] and V[ΔS] (Tables 2 and 4).
Alignments and phylogenetic analysis of regulatory
sequences
I obtained homologous regions for each regulatory
region from the UCSC genome-browser alignments
[46]. The sequences were then realigned using mLAGAN

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/286

[47]. Using these alignments and the known species
relationships for these species [48], I estimated the
evolutionary distance and transition-transversion rate
ratio bias under an HKY model [24] using paml [49]. The
parameters estimated using paml for each regulatory
region were then used to compute the exact E[ΔS] and
V[ΔS] shown in Tables 2 and 4.
Simulations of molecular evolution
To confirm that the test statistic had a standard normal
distribution under the null hypothesis, I simulated the
evolution of the 6 known binding sites in the hb anterior
activator. To do so, I inferred the ancestral sequences
using maximum parsimony [50], and then simulated
their evolution by introducing substitutions using an
HKY model with kappa estimated from the alignment,
60% AT content for the equilibrium distribution of
nucleotides, and evolutionary distance scaled to observe
an average of 5 substitutions over the 6 binding sites. I
then computed the average ΔS for the substitutions we
observed, and calculated the Z statistic using E[ΔS] and V
[ΔS] computed exactly using the evolutionary model or
using the long-time limit approximation. I repeated this
simulation until I observed 1000 cases with at least 3
substitutions in total. Simulations for the eve stripe 2
enhancer were similar, except I used the actual D.
melanogaster binding sites (because reliable inference of
the ancestral sites was difficult) and that the evolutionary
distance was scaled so that the 5 substitutions were
distributed over the 5 Bcd and 6 Kr sites.
Distribution of ΔS
I sought to compute the distribution of ΔS in the absence
of selection. Because the number of observed evolutionary differences in any particular binding site is
typically small, I make the assumption that each DNA
difference in a transcription factor binding site occurs
independently, and presence of a single change has no
effect on the probability of other changes. Under this
assumption, the probability of observing the particular
change from base a to base b (a, b in {A, C, G, T}) at
position i is

p(a → b at i | one subs.) =

Since I am considering the conditional probability that
one particular substitution occurs out of all the possible
substitutions that could have occurred, under some
substitution models such as F81 [51], or in the limit of
long evolutionary time, this probability does not depend
on time and mutation rate (evolutionary distance). I
refer to this time independent approximation as the
‘long time limit’ distribution, and derive formulas under
this assumption. Under the F81 [51] substitution model
Pab = gb(1 − e-ut), where u is the mutation rate and t is
time. We have

As computed here, the distribution of ΔS is exact only for
the first substitution at each site in a particular sequence.
Therefore it is important to apply the tests described here
to cases where only small numbers of substitutions have
occurred on each lineage. For the regulatory sequences
considered here, this assumption seems appropriate.
However, if enough substitutions have occurred such
that multiple subsequent substitutions occur at the same
position, the distribution of ΔS computed based on the
sequence of a reference species or inferred ancestral
sequence will no longer be exact. Computing the
distribution of ΔS under more relaxed assumptions is
area for further research.
