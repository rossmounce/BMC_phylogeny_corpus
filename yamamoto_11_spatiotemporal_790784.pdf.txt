The spatiotemporal expression of multiple coho
salmon ovarian connexin genes and their
hormonal regulation in vitro during oogenesis
Yoji Yamamoto1,2*, J Adam Luckenbach2, Mollie A Middleton1,2 and Penny Swanson2

Abstract
Background: Throughout oogenesis, cell-cell communication via gap junctions (GJs) between oocytes and
surrounding follicle cells (theca and granulosa cells), and/or amongst follicle cells is required for successful follicular
development. To gain a fundamental understanding of ovarian GJs in teleosts, gene transcripts encoding GJ
proteins, connexins (cx), were identified in the coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, ovary. The spatiotemporal
expression of four ovarian cx transcripts was assessed, as well as their potential regulation by follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1).
Methods: Salmonid ovarian transcriptomes were mined for cx genes. Four gene transcripts designated cx30.9,
cx34.3, cx43.2, and cx44.9 were identified. Changes in gene expression across major stages of oogenesis were
determined with real-time, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and cx transcripts were localized to specific ovary cell-types
by in situ hybridization. Further, salmon ovarian follicles were cultured with various concentrations of FSH, LH and
IGF1 and effects of each hormone on cx gene expression were determined by qPCR.
Results: Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 were highly expressed at the perinucleolus (PN)-stage and decreased
thereafter. In contrast, transcripts for cx34.3 and cx43.2 were low at the PN-stage and increased during later stages
of oogenesis, peaking at the mid vitellogenic (VIT)-stage and maturing (MAT)-stage, respectively. In situ
hybridization revealed that transcripts for cx34.3 were only detected in granulosa cells, but other cx transcripts were
detected in both oocytes and follicle cells. Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 were down-regulated by FSH and IGF1
at the lipid droplet (LD)-stage, whereas transcripts for cx34.3 were up-regulated by FSH and IGF1 at the LD-stage,
and LH and IGF1 at the late VIT-stage. Transcripts for cx43.2 were down-regulated by IGF1 at the late VIT-stage and
showed no response to gonadotropins.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the presence and hormonal regulation of four different cx transcripts in the
salmon ovary. Differences in the spatiotemporal expression profile and hormonal regulation of these cx transcripts
likely relate to their different roles during ovarian follicle differentiation and development.

Background
The growth and development of oocytes and surrounding follicle cells (i.e., granulosa and theca cells) occurs in
a highly orchestrated and mutually dependent manner.
Communication between these different ovarian celltypes is dependent on direct signaling mediated by gap
junctions (GJs), in addition to signaling via endocrine
and/or paracrine pathways [1,2]. Gap junctions are

composed of an aggregate of intercellular membrane
channels that allow the passage of molecules with a
molecular weight of up to 1 kDa, including various second messengers such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and inositol trisphosphate, and ions [3]. Each GJ channel is
formed by two hemichannels (connexons), both of
which are hexamers of connexin (Cx) protein subunits
[4,5]. Two connexons from adjacent cells dock to form
a GJ channel. In mammals, numerous studies indicate
that ovarian GJ communication is involved in regulation
of the meiotic arrest of oocytes, steroidogenesis, and
apoptosis [6-9]. In fishes, by contrast, detailed

information on the distribution, expression, and functions of ovarian GJs is largely unknown.
The few studies of ovarian GJs and cx gene transcripts
in fishes were performed during late stages of maturation, prior to ovulation. Final maturation of the fish
ovarian follicle involves a number of events including
luteinizing hormone (LH)-dependent acquisition of
oocyte maturational competence (OMC), LH induction
of maturation-inducing hormone (MIH; typically either
17,20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one or 17,20b,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one) synthesis, and MIH-dependent
meiotic resumption [10]. Previous studies with Atlantic
croaker, Micropogonias undulates, and red seabream,
Pagrus major, used electron microscopy to show that
the number of ovarian GJs (between granulosa cells and
oocytes, and amongst granulosa cells) increased during
LH-dependent acquisition of OMC [11-13]. Increases in
ovarian GJs were also induced by insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF1) treatment in red seabream [12]. Further,
Yamamoto et al. [14,15] found that culturing ovarian
fragments with common GJ inhibitors prevented LHinduced acquisition of OMC in ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, suggesting that ovarian GJ communication is essential for the LH-induced acquisition of OMC in this
species. Thus, some ovarian GJs appear to be hormonally regulated and to have important roles during final
maturation of the follicle in fishes. However, the function(s) and regulation of ovarian GJs during earlier
stages of oogenesis, such as previtellogenic and vitellogenic stages, has not been studied.
So far, 21 human genes and 20 mouse cx genes have
been identified [16]. In addition, 37 putative cx genes
have been identified in the zebrafish genome [17]. Many
cx genes show tissue- or cell-type-specific expression
patterns and most organs express more than one cx
[18]. According to Eastman’s phylogenetic analysis,
which was performed with the entire Cx family including human, mouse, and zebrafish Cx, cx genes can be
classified into a, b, and g groups, and potentially a
fourth group containing human Cx62, mouse Cx57, and
zebrafish Cx52.6 for example [17]. Studies in mammals
have indicated that endocrine regulators of oogenesis
such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH also
regulate levels of cx gene transcripts in the ovary [9].
For example, up-regulation of cx43 transcripts in
response to FSH was reported in a rat granulosa cell
line [19], while LH had an inhibitory effect on the
expression of cx43 in rat ovarian follicles in vitro [20].
Such gonadotropic regulation of cx gene transcripts has
also been reported in teleosts. In red seabream, purified
native FSH increased cx32.3, while LH increased cx31.5
and cx32.3 transcripts during acquisition of OMC
[21,22]. In addition, human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) elevated cx32.2, but not cx32.7 transcripts in

Atlantic croaker during acquisition of OMC [23-25].
Thus, gonadotropins appear to regulate some ovarian cx
gene transcripts during oocyte maturation in teleosts.
Meanwhile, the regulation of ovarian cx gene transcripts
by FSH, LH or IGF1 at earlier stages of oogenesis has
not been examined.
The goals of this study were to identify and characterize ovarian cx gene transcripts in coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, determine whether levels of cx
transcripts in the ovary change across stages of oogenesis, and to determine the subfollicular distribution of cx
transcripts in the ovary. Finally, we determined whether
FSH, LH or IGF1 regulate cx gene expression in previtellogenic and vitellogenic ovarian follicles. We used
coho salmon as a model for this work because it is a
semelparous species (spawns only once in its life and
then dies) that exhibits synchronous follicle development. This unique reproductive trait allows for stagespecific analysis of a relatively homogenous clutch of
ovarian follicles, which is not possible in iteroparous
species. Furthermore, developmental profiles of FSH,
LH, and IGF1 in the plasma are well characterized in
salmon [26-29], giving biological relevance to any effects
of these hormones on cx gene expression during a specific stage of ovarian development.

Methods
Animals and sampling

Coho salmon were reared at the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center (Seattle, WA, USA) in 10-15°C recirculated fresh water and fed a standard ration (0.6-1.0%
body weight/day) of a commercial diet (Skretting Feeds,
Vancouver, BC, Canada). Lighting above the tanks was
continually adjusted to match the natural photoperiod
of Seattle (48°N). Stages of oogenesis were determined
and confirmed by histological analyses using Campbell
et al. [27] and Nagahama [30] as guides.
Perinucleolus (PN)-stage follicles were sampled from
age-1+ salmon in August. Cortical alveolus (CA)-stage,
lipid droplet (LD)-stage, early vitellogenic (VIT)-stage
(with oocytes containing yolk granules), mid VIT-stage
(with oocytes containing yolk globules), and preovulatory, maturing (MAT)-stage follicles were sampled from
age-2+ salmon in March, June, July, August and December, respectively. The germinal vesicles of oocytes in the
MAT-stage were migrating (just before germinal vesicle
break down). Prior to tissue sampling, fish were euthanized in buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (0.05% MS222, Argent Chemical, Redmond, WA) and body and
ovary weight were recorded. A piece of ovary was collected for histological analysis, and other pieces were
frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation and mRNA
analyses. Fish used in the experiments were reared and
handled according to the policies and guidelines of the

University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #2313-09).
RNA isolation

For the across-stage comparisons of transcript levels,
approximately 40-100 mg (wet wt.) pieces of ovarian tissue were homogenized in 1 ml Tri-Reagent/sample
(Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) using a
TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and total RNA
was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Because of the large size of MAT-stage follicles
(130-140 mg/follicle), 5 follicles/fish were homogenized
in 7 ml of Tri-Reagent. For culture experiment 1 (see
below), 40-70 mg of cultured ovarian tissue from each
well was homogenized with 1 ml of Tri-Reagent. For
culture experiment 2, one cultured follicle (late VITstage, 40-80 mg/follicle) from each well was homogenized in 1 ml of Tri-Reagent. Isolated total RNA samples were then diluted to ~250 ng RNA/ml in nucleasefree water.
Total RNA samples were then DNase treated using
the Turbo DNA-Free kit’s “rigorous” protocol (Applied
Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX) where the amount of
DNase enzyme and treatment time were doubled. RNA
yields and quality were assessed by NanoDrop (ND1000 Spectrophotometer; NanoDrop Technologies,
Rockland, DE) and gel electrophoresis.
For the across-stage comparisons, mRNA was further
isolated from total RNA samples to mitigate issues associated with comparing ovarian follicles during different
stages of oogenesis, which may be dramatically different
in size and RNA composition [31]. mRNA was isolated
from 200 mg of total RNA/sample using the MicroPoly
(A)Purist kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). As in vitro culture
experiments were done with ovarian follicles of the
same stage, total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis
(see below).
cDNA synthesis

For each sample, 500 ng of total RNA (for culture
experiments) or 50 ng of mRNA (for across-stage comparisons of cx transcripts) was reverse transcribed in a
10-μl reaction with the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Other necessary components for reverse
transcription (RT), such as random primers and RNase
inhibitor, were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).
Negative control reactions were performed without the
addition of the RT enzyme for a subset of the RNA
samples.
Identification of coho salmon connexins

To identify coho salmon ovarian cx gene transcripts, we
conducted searches within our previous coho salmon
ovarian cDNA libraries (Luckenbach et al. unpublished

data) and located partial cDNAs for gene transcripts we
later named cx30.9, cx34.3, and cx44.9. Partial cDNAs
for cx30.9 and cx44.9 showed high homology to Atlantic
salmon, Salmo salar, gap junction beta 6 protein (Gjb6,
GenBank accession number; NM_001140280.1) and
rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, cx sequences
(Accession numbers: TC152456 and TC137376) in the
DFCI R. trout gene index database [32], respectively.
Primers to amplify the complete coding sequence (CDS)
of these two cx genes were designed within these salmonid fish sequences. The complete CDS for coho salmon
cx34.3 was determined by constructing a contig from
several coho salmon expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
and then the entire sequence was confirmed by PCR.
Although we did not find cx43.2 in our salmon ovarian
cDNA libraries, rainbow trout cx43 (GenBank accession
number DQ204869.1), which is a homologue of coho
salmon cx43.2, had been previously studied in the trout
ovary [33]. Thus, we cloned cx43.2 from the coho salmon ovary using primers designed from the trout cDNA
sequence.
The primers for cloning each salmon cx are shown in
Table 1. The RT-PCRs for cloning were carried out for
35 cycles as follows: 94°C for 30 s for denaturing, 52°C
for 30 s for annealing and 72°C for 90 s for extension.
The RT-PCR reactions consisted of 18 ng cDNA template (based on the mRNA loaded into the RT reactions), which was synthesized using mRNA of MATstage ovary. We used SuperTaq™ Polymerase (Ambion)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant PCR products of expected size were inserted into a
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) or pCR®XL-TOPO ® vector (Invitrogen), and completely
sequenced on both DNA strands with an ABI PRISM
3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer.
Quantitative PCR

For cx gene transcript analyses, we performed real-time
quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The qPCR procedure was
similar to that previously reported by Luckenbach et al
[31,34]. The sequences of gene-specific primers (GSP) for
qPCR are listed in Table 1. Reactions consisted of
1×Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABI), 150 nM of
each gene-specific forward and reverse primer and 0.05 ng
(based on the mRNA loaded into the RT reactions, for the
across-stage comparisons of cx transcripts) or 0.5 ng
(based on the total RNA loaded into the RT reactions, for
culture experiment 1 and 2) of cDNA templates. Triplicate
standard curve samples generated from a serial dilution of
pooled mRNA from ovaries of six randomly selected previtellogenic coho salmon (for the across-stage comparisons
of cx transcripts), or pooled total RNA from six randomly
selected ovaries after being cultured 36 h with hormones
(for culture experiment 1 and 2) were included in each

plate. Results were analyzed using the relative standard
curve method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative controls were included in each plate and
consisted of either no RNA template (no template control,
NTC) or RNA template that was not reverse transcribed
(no amplification control, NAC). NACs reveal possible
genomic DNA contamination in the RNA preparations.
Negative control samples showed either no detectability or
negligible values (>10 cycle separation from experimental
samples). A melt curve analysis was included for each target gene to ensure that a single product was amplified,
and in addition, a qPCR product was sequenced to verify
that the target was successfully amplified.
Previous work in coho salmon showed that normalization of qPCR data to elongation factor-1 alpha (ef1a)
generated results that best reflected transcript abundance on a per follicle basis in coho salmon follicle
when comparing across different stages of oogenesis
[31]. Therefore expression data for the cx transcripts
were normalized to ef1a in this study. The levels of ef1a
transcripts were stable (i.e., not significantly different)
for the in vitro experiments and across four of the five
stages (PN- to VIT-stage) of oogenesis included in the
across-stage comparison (see Figure 2A inset). Due to
the observed increase in ef1a at the MAT-stage, data for
the cx genes were assessed both normalized to ef1a and
un-normalized. Results overall for the two approaches
were statistically very similar and therefore ef1a normalized data are shown for the cx transcripts. The primers
for ef1a were the same as previously reported [31].
In situ hybridization

Transcripts for all four cx gene transcripts were localized by in situ hybridization (ISH) in PN-, CA-, LD-,

early VIT- and MAT-stage ovarian follicles. However,
ISH was technically difficult to perform with MAT-stage
follicles due to the large amount of yolk present in the
oocytes, and results are therefore not shown for this
stage.
The cDNA fragments containing the entire CDS –
that is, nucleotides 1- 1,088, 1-1,038, 1-1,278, and 11,273 for cx30.9, cx34.3, cx43.2, and cx44.9, respectively
– were used as templates for the synthesis of RNA
probes. Sense and antisense RNA probes for each cx
were transcribed in vitro using digoxigenin-labeled UTP
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and T7 RNA
polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). To
prepare tissues for ISH, ovarian samples were fragmented into several pieces and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) with gentle
shaking at room temperature for 16-36 h. Fixed ovaries
were rinsed three times with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) over 45 min, sequentially dehydrated through a
methanol series (25%, 50%, and 75% methanol/PBS),
and stored in 100% methanol at - 20°C until use.
A portion of each sample was embedded in paraffin
wax and cut into 5-μm serial sections using a microtome. Paraffin sections were mounted on SUPERFROST ® Plus microscope slides (Thermo Scientific,
Portsmouth, NH), dewaxed, and dehydrated by immersion in a xylene-ethanol series. Slides were either stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (VECTOR LABORATORIES, Burlingame, CA) or processed for ISH with
DIG-labeled RNA probes. Sections for ISH were permeabilized, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for 20 min, and treated with 5 mg/ml
proteinase K at 37°C for 10 min. The sections were subsequently acetylated, and then incubated with a

Yamamoto et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:52
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/52

hybridization mixture of 0.0125-0.2 mg/ml RNA probe,
50% formamide, 2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) (pH
4.5), 50 mg/ml transfer RNA (tRNA), 50 mg/ml heparin,
1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10% dextran sulfate. After hybridization at 65°C for 16 h, the sections
were washed as follows: twice in 5× SSC/50% formamide at 65°C for 30 min, three times in 2× SSC/50%
formamide at 65°C for 30 min, and once in 1× SSC/25%
formamide:1× Tris buffered saline containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature for 30 min.
Unbound probes were digested using 20 mg/ml RNase
A to reduce background signals. After RNase digestion
at 37°C for 30 min, the sections were placed in NTE
buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) at 37°C for 5 min
before being washed three times in 0.5× SSC at 65°C for
20 min, three times in 1× TBST at room temperature
for 5 min, and in blocking solution (1×TBST and 2%
Blocking Reagent; Roche Diagnostics) at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the sections were incubated
with the Fab fragment of an anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Roche Diagnostics) diluted
1:2000 with blocking solution at 8°C for 16 h. Finally,
each section was rinsed three times in TBST containing
1 mM Levamisole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5
min. The sections were then incubated in a NTMT
solution (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 50
mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM Levamisole) containing 0.0035% nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT; Roche Diagnostics) and 0.0018% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (BCIP; Roche Diagnostics) at room temperature in the dark. After the color reaction had occurred,
the slides were sealed with CYTOSEAL™ XYL (Thermo
Scientific).
Ovarian cultures

Culture experiments were conducted as described previously [34,35] to assess the effects of various hormones
on ovarian cx gene expression. Animals were anaesthetized as above and the ovaries were removed, weighed,
and held in chilled Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) prior to dissection of follicles. Highlypurified coho salmon FSH and LH used in the experiments were obtained according to Swanson et al. [36].
Human recombinant IGF1 was purchased from Bachem
(Torrance, CA). All hormones were solubilized in 20
mM phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 0.2%
bovine serum albumin (BSA, RIA grade; Sigma-Aldrich)
and then dissolved directly in the culture medium.
Ovarian tissue fragments from a fish were distributed
into 24-well polystyrene culture plates so that each
treatment received one tissue fragment from each of the
fish. Each treatment therefore included ovarian follicles
from 6 different fish. Culture wells contained 1 ml of L-

Page 5 of 16

15 medium supplemented with 0.2% BSA and tissues
were pre-incubated at 14°C for 2 h with gentle orbital
shaking at 100 rpm. After the pre-incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh L-15 medium
containing either no hormone or hormone as described
below. Time 0 h ovaries (initial) were collected and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen just after the pre-incubation
for later RNA isolation.
Culture experiment 1; FSH and IGF1 effects on ovarian cx
genes

This experiment was conducted in mid-June 2010 with
LD-stage ovaries, because previous studies with coho
salmon showed that levels of plasma FSH begin to
increase in early spring (generally, Feb-May) and reach
peak levels in late summer (Aug-Sept) [26]. The mean
fish body weight (± SEM) was 595.9 ± 29.0 g, fork
length was 36.2 ± 0.7 cm, paired ovary weight was 6.42
± 0.62 g, and gonadosomatic index (GSI; gonad weight/
body weight*100) was 1.07 ± 0.06%. Approximately 4070 mg of ovarian tissue/well was incubated with or
without hormones. FSH concentrations were 0 (control),
10, 50, 100, or 500 ng/ml and IGF1 concentrations were
0 (control), 1, 10, or 100 nM. Cultures were maintained
for 36 h based on results of a previous time course
study [34], which demonstrated that several ovarian
genes affected by FSH showed a difference from controls at this time point. After the experiment, ovarian
tissues were dabbed on lens paper to remove excess
liquid, weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for
later RNA isolation.
Culture experiment 2; LH and IGF1 effects on ovarian cx
genes

This experiment was conducted in early October 2010
with late VIT-stage ovaries, because previous studies
with coho salmon showed that plasma LH levels begin
to increase slightly in fall (generally Oct/Nov in our
hatchery), prior to the ovulatory surge [26]. The mean
fish body weight (± SEM) was 1152.8 ± 90.9 g, fork
length was 44.0 ± 0.6 cm, paired ovary weight was 110.3
± 20.3 g, and GSI was 9.1 ± 1.1%. Because of the large
size of late VIT-stage follicles (40-80 mg/follicle), three
follicles/well were cultured with or without hormones
for 36 h. The LH concentrations were 0 (control), 10,
50, 100, or 500 ng/ml and IGF1 concentrations were the
same as in experiment 1.
Measurement of medium E2 levels

In salmon, both gonadotropins have been shown to stimulate production of estradiol-17b (E2) by ovarian follicles in vitro [34,37] and E2 had a biphasic effect on
transcripts for ovarian cx genes in Atlantic croaker [25].
Furthermore, IGF1 can modulate aromatase activity
[38]. Thus, it is informative to know how these hormones affected ovarian E2 production, which in turn

Yamamoto et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:52
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/52

may have influenced cx gene expression. After the 36-h
cultures, the medium from each well was collected and
stored at -80°C until later E2 measurement. Samples
were heat treated at 80°C for 1 h, centrifuged at 15,700
× g for 7 min, and supernatants were transferred to a
fresh tube [34]. Medium E2 levels were then determined
by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described [39].
Statistical analysis

The across-stage cx gene expression data and in vitro
ovarian incubation data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple mean comparison tests. Data were log 10 transformed when
necessary to meet normality and equal variance assumptions and reported as means ± SEM. Results for initial
and control samples from the ovarian incubation experiments were compared by unpaired t-tests. All statistical
analyses were conducted using the SPSS 11.0 microcomputer software package (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Results
Isolation and characterization of coho salmon cx cDNAs

cDNAs encoding 4 salmon cx genes were obtained with
GSPs (Table 1). The cx30.9 cDNA (GenBank Accession
No. HQ315553) was 1,088 bp and 272 aa, cx34.3
(HQ315554) was 1,038 bp and 298 aa, cx43.2
(HQ315555) was 1,278 bp and 383 aa, and cx44.9
(HQ315556) was 1,273 bp and 399 aa. From the predicted Cx amino acids sequences, the expected molecular weights of the proteins would be 30.9, 34.3, 43.2, and
44.9 kDa. Therefore, following the nomenclature system
proposed by Beyer et al. [40], we named the genes
accordingly. The homologies of amino acid sequences
among the coho salmon cx genes were less than 55%.
NCBI protein BLAST [41] searches revealed that coho
salmon cx30.9, cx34.3, cx43.2 and cx44.9 sequences had
the highest homology with Atlantic salmon Gjb6
(94.5%), zebrafish, Danio rerio, Cx34.5 (76.5%; GenBank
accession number; NP_001025371.1), rainbow trout
Cx43 (99.7%), and ayu Cx44.2 (72.5%; GenBank accession number; DQ487732.1), respectively. The amino
acid sequences obtained for the four cx gene transcripts
included all the characteristic features of Cx family proteins, including two cx consensus sequences, C(D, N)
TXQPGCX2VCYD and CX3or4PCX3(L, I, V, M)(D, E, N)
C(F, Y)(L, I, V, M)(S, A)(K, R)P, in the predicted extracellular loops (data not shown). Hydropathy analysis
revealed that the coho salmon Cx proteins encoded by
these genes would contain four hydrophilic domains
and five hydrophobic domains that are typical of known
Cx proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis, was performed by the neighbor-joining
method with ClustalX multiple alignment algorithm
using NJPLOT software [42,43]. This revealed that

Cx34.3 and Cx43.2 are a-type, Cx30.9 is a b-type, and
Cx44.9 is a g- type cx (Figure 1). The zebrafish and
mouse Cxs in our analysis were classified in the same
groups as previously reported [17].
Ovarian cx transcript levels during oogenesis

The levels of transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 showed a
similar profile across-stages of oogenesis where levels
were highest at the PN-stage and steadily declined
thereafter (Figure 2A and 2D). Levels of transcripts for
cx34.3 were lowest at the PN-stage, increased leading up
to vitellogenesis, and reached peak levels by the mid
VIT-stage (Figure 2B). Levels of cx43.2 transcripts
remained low during previtellogenic stages, increased
during vitellogenesis and peaked by the MAT-stage
(Figure 2C).
Intraovarian distribution of cx mRNAs

The results of ISH for each cx are shown in Table 2 and
Figure 3. ISH using PN-stage ovaries indicated that
cx30.9 (Table 2 and Figure 3B) and cx44.9 (Table 2 and
Figure 3E) transcripts were present in oocytes and follicle cells. As follicle cell layers at the PN-stage were very
thin, it was not possible to distinguish whether both the
theca and granulosa cells expressed these cx transcripts
(Figure 3B and 3E). The signals for cx30.9 and cx44.9
transcripts were also detected in oocytes from the CAto VIT-stage, however the signals in follicle cells were
not detected in the CA-stage or thereafter (Table 2).
ISH indicated that cx34.3 mRNA was only expressed in
the follicle cells (only granulosa cells through the CAto the VIT-stage, Table 2 and Figure 3H). Transcripts
for cx43.4 were localized to follicle cells (both theca and
granulosa cells at the CA-, LD- and early VIT-stages)
and within oocytes (Table 2 and Figure 3K).
Culture experiment 1: Effects of FSH and IGF1 on ovarian
cx gene expression

In LD-stage follicles, FSH significantly reduced transcript levels for cx30.9 and cx44.9 in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 4A and 4D). In contrast,
transcripts for cx34.3 increased in a concentrationdependent manner, reaching a more than 8-fold maximum elevation relative to control when treated with 500
ng FSH/ml (Figure 4B). FSH did not affect cx43.2 levels
at any concentration (Figure 4C). IGF1 had effects similar to FSH on ovarian cx expression. Transcripts for
cx30.9 and cx44.9 were suppressed in a concentrationdependent manner, but were only significantly downregulated relative to controls at the highest concentration, 100 nM IGF1 (Figure 4E and 4H). Transcripts for
cx43.2 were significantly suppressed by 100 nM IGF1
relative to controls (Figure 4G). In contrast, IGF1 elevated transcripts for cx34.3 in a concentration-

Culture experiment 2: Effects of LH and IGF1 on ovarian
cx gene expression

In late VIT-stage follicles, LH increased the level of
transcripts for cx34.3 in a concentration-dependent
manner, reaching a more than 11-fold increase relative
to control when treated with 500 ng LH/ml (Figure 5A).
In contrast, LH did not affect transcripts for cx43.2 at
any concentration tested (Figure 5B). IGF1 elevated
transcripts for cx34.3 in a concentration-dependent
manner reaching a more than 8-fold maximum increase
relative to control when treated with 100 nM IGF1 (Figure 5C). In contrast, IGF1 suppressed transcripts for
cx43.2 in a concentration-dependent manner, but this
was only significant with 100 nM IGF1 (Figure 5D).
Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 were very low at the
late-VIT stage, and neither LH nor IGF1 altered levels
of these transcripts at any concentration tested (data not
shown).
Levels of transcripts for each cx gene in late VIT-stage
ovaries cultured in control medium for 0 h (initial) and
36 h showed different patterns. Notably, transcripts for
cx34.3 decreased more than 10-fold after 36 h in culture
(Figure 5A or 5C), while transcripts for cx43.2 increased
after the 36-h incubation, but this was not significant
(Figure 5B or 5D). Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9
were very low in the initial sample and did not change
after 36 h culture (data not shown).
In vitro ovarian E2 production

Medium E2 levels increased in a concentration-dependent manner in response to FSH (culture experiment 1,
Figure 6A) and LH (culture experiment 2, Figure 6C). In
contrast, IGF1 had no effect on E2 production at any
concentration in both experiments (Figure 6B and 6D).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that multiple cx gene transcripts, designated cx30.9, cx34.3, cx43.2 and cx44.9, are

Page 9 of 16

expressed in coho salmon ovaries, have distinct developmental expression patterns, and differ in their hormonal
regulation. The sequence homologies, consensus
sequences, and predicted topologies of the four deduced
proteins are in strong agreement with the predicted
structural traits of Cx family proteins [4]. Such multiple
expression of cx gene transcripts in the ovary is well
known in mammals [9]; however, interrelationships
between various cx isoforms to form a connexon and
ultimately GJs are poorly understood. GJs are composed
of two connexons, both of which are hexamers of Cx
proteins. As most cell types express more than one cx
isoform, a connexon could potentially be composed of
either one type of Cx (homomeric) or more than one
type of Cx (heteromeric) [44]. When two identical connexons dock, they form a homotypic GJ, while when
two different connexons dock, they form a heterotypic
GJ [44]. We did not examine the functional aspects of
the four different Cx proteins in coho salmon; however,
previous studies in two Perciform fishes suggest that
heterotypic GJs have much lower functional activity
than homotypic GJs [45,46]. To determine the compatibility between four different Cx proteins in coho salmon, further analyses using an in vitro cell expression
system and dye transfer assay [47,48] will be needed.
Although our phylogenetic analysis showed that cx30.9
and cx44.9 were classified in the b group and g group,
respectively, the results of spatiotemporal analyses and
hormone effects on these genes were similar. Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 were highly expressed at
the PN-stage, however these transcripts decreased dramatically by the LD-stage and remained low thereafter.
Further, these genes were expressed in follicle cells
(theca and/or granulosa cells) and oocytes only at the
PN-stage. These data suggest that GJs composed of
cx30.9 and cx44.9 could have important roles during
early oogenesis and could form GJs between follicle cells
and the oocyte, and amongst follicle cells at the PNstage. To date, there are no cx isoforms identified in
fishes that show the exact spatiotemporal expression
pattern as coho salmon cx30.9 and cx44.9. However, in
ayu, two cx isoforms designated cx44.1 and cx44.2, that
have the highest homology to coho salmon cx44.9, were
similarly expressed at the highest levels during early
oogenesis [49], but were only expressed in the oocyte
and levels did not decline at more advanced stages of
oogenesis as seen in salmon. Although coho salmon
cx30.9 and cx44.9 share some similarities to ayu cx44.1
and cx44.2, the difference in localization of the cx transcripts and the low levels of these two coho salmon cx
transcripts during the LD-through MAT- stage suggest
they are unlikely to have the same function as the ayu
cx genes.

The gene encoding cx34.3 was classified in the a

revealed that cx34.3 was localized only in granulosa
cells. These data suggest that cx34.3 may compose

homotypic GJs, only between granulosa cells, which
could have important roles in vitellogenesis and final
maturation. In teleosts, it is generally accepted that
granulosa cells produce steroid hormones such as E2
and MIH from their respective precursors [50]. In mammals, it is well known that the hormone-producing cells

are also connected by functional GJs and are needed for
the cells to biosynthesize, store and release hormone
effectively [51,52]. Gap junctional communication
amongst granulosa cells may have an important role in
steroidogenesis [12,53]. Thus, in coho salmon, GJs composed of cx34.3 between granulosa cells may have an

important role in ovarian steroidogenesis, but further
research will be needed to establish this.
In contrast to cx34.3, transcripts for cx43.2 increased
later in vitellogenesis, reached maximum levels in the
preovulatory follicles, and were localized in both follicle
cells (theca and granulosa cells at CA-, LD- and early

VIT-stages) and oocytes. These data suggest that cx43.2
could compose homotypic GJs, between the follicle cells
and the oocyte, and between the follicle cells, and that
GJs formed by cx43.2 may be involved in late vitellogenesis and final maturation. The observed increase in
cx43.2 at the MAT-stage was consistent with a previous
report of rainbow trout cx43 [33], a homologue of coho
salmon cx43.2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that coho
salmon cx43.2 and trout cx43 were both classified in the

a group. The temporal expression pattern and follicular
localization of coho salmon cx43.2 showed a similar pattern to that of ayu cx34.9 [49]. In ayu, cx34.9 appears to
contribute to formation of GJs between the oocyte and
the granulosa cells, and may have an important role in
transmitting the LH-signal received in the follicle cells
to the oocyte via a second messenger such as cAMP
during acquisition of OMC [14,15,49]. Although we
have no empirical data on the function of coho salmon

Yamamoto et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:52
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/52

cx43.2, it may have a similar role to ayu cx34.9 given the
similarity of their spatiotemporal expression patterns.
Hormonal regulation of cx gene transcripts has been
reported in several fishes. However, previous studies of
the hormonal regulation of ovarian cx gene transcripts
mainly focused on MAT-stage follicles [21-25]. To
assess hormonal regulation of cx gene transcripts during
various stages of oogenesis, we performed two ovarian
culture experiments using previtellogenic (LD-stage; culture experiment 1) and late VIT-stage (culture experiment 2) follicles. At the LD-stage, both FSH and IGF1
increased transcript levels for cx34.3, but decreased
transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9. In late VIT-stage follicles, LH and IGF1 had a stimulatory effect on transcripts for cx34.3. While LH had no effect on levels of
transcripts for cx43.2, IGF1 showed a clear inhibitory
effect. These data suggest that gonadotropins and IGF1
regulate ovarian cx trancripts in a cx- and stage-specific
manner, and may influence GJ formation and therefore
communication within the ovary. Although the stimulatory effect of IGF1 on the number of GJs has been
reported in red seabream ovary [12], to our knowledge
this is the first report of IGF1 regulation of ovarian cx
gene expression. As IGF1 receptors were found in granulosa cells of coho salmon [38], it is possible that IGF1
(either endocrine or paracrine IGF) regulates cx34.3
gene expression in granulosa cells. The up- and downregulation of specific cx genes by gonadotropins shown
in the present study is consistent with previous studies
in Atlantic croaker [23-25]. Although the mechanisms
of ovarian cx activation by hormones were not
addressed in the present study, studies of Atlantic croaker revealed that gonadotopic regulation of cx genes was
mediated by the cAMP-protein kinase A transduction
pathway [24,54]. Obviously, further promoter studies are
needed to elucidate the role of second messenger systems or other transcription factors in the regulation of
cx gene expression by gonadotropins and IGF1 in the
ovary of coho salmon.
Our results show that both FSH and LH, but not
IGF1, stimulated in vitro production of ovarian E2, thus
we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed
effects of gonadotropins were mediated by steroids. In
mammals, many studies indicated that steroid hormones
regulate cx gene expression [55-57]. For example, in the
ovariectomized rat endometrium, a high amount of progesterone in combination with low E2 levels suppressed
transcripts for cx26 and cx43, but higher E2 levels had
no effect on cx26 expression [57]. In Atlantic croaker,
E2 had a biphasic effect on cx32.7 [25]. At a low concentration, E2 had no effect on cx32.7 transcripts, but at
high concentrations, it inhibited expression [25]. Thus,
E2 appears to regulate cx gene expression in teleosts as
well. To clarify the involvement of steroid hormones in

Page 14 of 16

the regulation of ovarian cx gene expression, further in
vitro culture experiments using inhibitors of E2 synthesis or other steroid hormones such as progesterone
and testosterone will be needed.
The developmental patterns and hormonal regulation
of cx gene expression were consistent with what is
known about plasma levels of FSH, LH, and IGF1 during the reproductive cycle of salmon. For example, transcripts for cx34.3 began to increase at the CA- to LDstage and peaked during mid vitellogenesis. This expression profile is consistent with plasma FSH [26,27] and
IGF1 profiles in female coho salmon [27,29] and our
results indicate that both of these hormones stimulate
ovarian cx34.3 expression in vitro. Plasma levels of FSH
[26] and IGF1 [28] in salmon decrease at final oocyte
maturation, while plasma LH levels increase during this
period [26]. Our results indicate that at this stage, LH
increased expression of cx34.3. Taken together, high
expression of cx34.3 at the LD - to VIT-stage could be
regulated by FSH and IGF1, and then at the MAT-stage,
LH could maintain high expression of cx34.3. Interestingly, incubation of LD-stage ovarian follicles in control
medium without any hormones for 36 h reduced transcripts for cx34.3 more than 64-fold relative to the
initial levels, and this reduction did not fully recover by
incubation with FSH and IGF1, even at the highest hormone concentrations. These data suggest that cx34.3 is
regulated by a number of factors in vivo, including FSH
and IGF1, and perhaps other unidentified factors at this
stage. Since we did not test any combination of hormones in our experiments, we do not yet know if there
are additive or synergistic effects of gonadotropins and
IGF1.
In contrast to cx34.3, FSH and LH did not have any
effect on levels of cx43.2 transcripts. It was somewhat
surprising that LH, in particular, did not show any effect
on this gene, despite the expression profile of cx43.2
being similar to that of plasma LH [26]. Although the
existence of other regulators of cx43.2 remains a possibility, one potential scenario to explain ovarian cx43.2
regulation in coho salmon is inhibitory regulation by
IGF1. Both culture experiments revealed that only IGF1
inhibited cx43.2 expression. In salmon, plasma IGF1
levels typically increase during early secondary oocyte
growth and decrease at the preovulatory stage [27-29].
Temporal expression analyses revealed that transcripts
for cx43.2 were relatively low until the mid VIT-stage,
but significantly increased by the MAT-stage. Thus,
IGF1 may inhibit cx43.2 expression through most of
oogenesis, and the natural decrease in plasma IGF1
prior to final oocyte maturation may induce elevations
in cx43.2 expression. Notably, incubation of ovarian follicles in control medium for 36 h induced more than a
3-fold increase in this gene relative to initial samples in

culture experiment 1. These in vitro data as well as the
developmental pattern in vivo support the idea that in
vivo factors negatively regulate cx43.2 expression, and
that one of these factors may be IGF1.
At the LD-stage, transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9
were down-regulated by both FSH and IGF1 in vitro.
Temporal expression analyses of these transcripts
revealed that their expression decreased at the LD-stage.
Thus, the decrease in these transcripts in our acrossstage comparison could be due to increases in FSH
[26,27] and IGF1 [27,29] that occur naturally in this species. Further research will be needed to identify factors
that may up-regulate cx30.9 and cx44.9 gene expression
during early oogenesis.

Conclusion
In this study, we show that at least four different cx
genes, designated cx30.9, cx34.3, cx43.2, and cx44.9, are
expressed in the coho salmon ovarian follicle. Transcripts for cx30.9 and cx44.9 were highly expressed in
PN-stage follicles and localized to the follicle cells and
oocytes. Transcripts for cx34.3 were highly expressed at
the mid VIT-stage and were localized only to granulosa
cells. Transcripts for cx43.2 were highly expressed at the
MAT-stage in theca and granulosa cells, and oocytes.
Thus, the results of spatiotemporal analyses revealed
that cx30.9, cx34.3, cx43.2, and cx44.9 were under ovarian stage and cell-type specific control during oogenesis.
Further, FSH, LH, and IGF1 differentially regulated
these ovarian cx gene transcripts in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first report of IGF1 regulation of ovarian cx gene expression. These data indicate that the
differences in spatiotemporal expression profiles and
hormone-mediated regulation of these four cx transcripts may be related to the function of ovarian GJs
during different stages of ovarian cellular differentiation.
Future studies on the cell-cell communication permitted
by GJs formed by these Cx proteins will be important to
understanding development of the ovarian follicle in
teleosts.
