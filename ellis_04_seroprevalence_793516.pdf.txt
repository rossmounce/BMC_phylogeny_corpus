Abstract
Background: The Sykes' monkey and related forms (Cercopithecus mitis) make up an abundant,
widespread and morphologically diverse species complex in eastern Africa that naturally harbors a
distinct simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsyk). We carried out a retrospective serological survey
of SIV infection from both wild and captive Sykes' monkeys from Kenya. We compared two
commercially available, cross-reactive ELISA tests using HIV antigens with a novel SIVsyk antigenspecific Western blot assay and analyzed the data by origin, subspecies, age and sex.
Results: The SIVsyk antigen-specific Western blot assay detected more serum samples as positive
than either of the cross-reactive ELISA assays. Using this assay, we found that seroprevalence is
higher than previously reported, but extremely variable in wild populations (from 0.0 to 90.9%).
Females were infected more often than males in both wild and captive populations. Seropositive
infants were common. However, no seropositive juveniles were identified.
Conclusion: We have developed a specific and sensitive Western blot assay for anti-SIVsyk
antibody detection. Sykes' monkeys are commonly infected with SIVsyk, but with extremely
variable prevalence in the wild. Higher infection prevalence in females suggests predominantly
sexual transmission. High infection prevalence in infants, but none in juveniles, suggests maternal
antibodies, but little or no vertical transmission.

Background
Both human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and
human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) have been
evolutionarily linked to zoonotic transmissions of naturally occurring simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs)
from Central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and West African sooty mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys), respectively [1,2]. In addition, the SIVsmm

from sooty mangabeys has been transmitted in captivity
to Asian macaques (Macaca mulatta) and is pathogenic in
that species, producing an acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome-like condition [3-6]. Evidence of infection by
naturally occurring SIVs has been documented in a variety
of different non-human African primate species [7-9] and
additional types of SIV are likely to exist in other African
primates as well [9].

Despite the importance of naturally occurring SIVs as reservoirs for human disease as well as infections in other
primate species, few studies have addressed the distribution or prevalence of these viruses in wild host populations [10]. Research in this area has been limited by the
fact that many primate species are endangered in the wild
and therefore samples used for SIV studies have often
been acquired from research centers and zoos, not wild
animals. The patterns of transmission in captive animals
may have been influenced by altered contacts or behaviors in captivity and may not reflect natural transmission
patterns. Furthermore, not all SIVs grow well in cell culture and it has consequently been difficult to generate specific reagents for their study.
The Sykes' monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) belongs to an
abundant, widespread and morphologically diverse species complex found throughout East Africa [11-13]. Previous investigations have indicated that these monkeys are
infected with a unique virus: SIVsyk. Both wild and captive C. mitis have previously been shown to have antibodies that cross-reacted with SIVsmm and SIVagm [14]. A
virus isolate (SIVsyk173) was made from one SIVsyk
infected animal and an infectious clone was produced,
sequenced and shown to form a distinct phylogenetic
group from other known SIVs [15]. Very recently, several
additional, related SIVsyk sequences have also been
reported [16]. These viruses apparently do not grow well
in human or rhesus macaque PBMCs, but have been
shown to replicate to some degree in immortalized
human lymphoid cell lines [17]. SIVsyk also does not produce detectable disease in either the natural host or in rhesus macaques [15,17] (personal observation M. G.
Otsyula), consistent with other observations that infection of many natural host species with their specific SIV is
non-pathogenic [15].
Here we report the results of a retrospective serosurvey for
the prevalence of SIVsyk in wild Sykes' monkey populations in comparison to captive animals. We compare the
use of two different cross-reactive ELISA assays with a
novel SIVsyk-specific Western blot assay based on the isolate SIVsyk173. We provide a breakdown of seroprevalence results between captive and geographically isolated
wild populations, subspecies, sexes and age groups. These
data support the utility of using an antigen-specific assay
rather than a cross-reactive assay and indicate that the
prevalence of SIVsyk infection is highly variable in wild
populations and higher in adult animals than previously
reported.

Results
Comparison of SIVsyk Western blot assay to cross-reactive
ELISAs
Two hundred and seventy six serum samples from both
wild and captive C. mitis were screened for the presence of
antibodies cross-reactive to HIV-1 and HIV-2 using two
commercial ELISA tests. The 276 samples included 100
sequential (duplicate or triplicate) serum samples from
the same animals taken at different times. From these sera,
the Innotest HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies test (Innogenetics,
Belgium) detected a total of 132 positive samples and 144
negative samples. The Genescreen HIV-1/2 version 2 test
(Biorad, Japan). detected 129 positive samples and 147
negative samples. Five samples gave disparate results
using these two tests, four of these samples were positive
using the Innotest kit, but negative using the Genscreen
test and one sample was positive using the Genscreen test,
but negative using the Innotest kit.

To confirm these results and compare the sensitivity and
specificity of these assays, all 276 samples were screened
by an SIVsyk viral antigen-specific Western blot assay.
Serum samples were considered positive by SIVsyk Western blot assay if they showed reactivity to ENV, GAG or CA
proteins. The SIVsyk Western assay identified a total of
138 samples as positive and 138 as negative. Ten samples
that were negative by the Genscreen assay and seven samples that were negative by the Innotest assay were identified as positive by the SIVsyk Western assay (Figure 1).
One sample that was identified as positive by both ELISA
tests was consistently negative by SIVsyk Western. Using
the SIVsyk Western assay as the standard, this results in a
99.3% specificity for both ELISA assays and 93.9% and
95.8% sensitivity for the Genscreen and Innotest assays,
respectively, for detection of anti-SIVsyk serum antibodies. Using McNemar's repeated measures test, the difference between the Western and the Innotest is just under
the 95% confidence limit (p = 0.0703) and the difference
between the Western and the Genescreen test is statistically significant (p = 0.0117).
Serosurvey of wild animals
The results from the SIVsyk Western assay were analyzed
according to geographic origin, subspecies, age and sex.
Figure 2 shows a map of Kenya indicating the locations of
the wild collection sites as well as the approximate ranges
of the three Sykes' monkey subspecies. Sequential serum
samples were excluded from this analysis, reducing the
number of samples considered to 176 (109 wild and 67
captive). Of the 109 individual samples from wild populations, 51 positives were detected, for a total wild seroprevalence of 46.8%. This includes both sexes and all age
classes from all locations. Between individual wild populations, the seroprevalence level was quite variable, with a
high of 90.9% on the coast at Lamu, to 0% at Kwale, also

Sykes', 11 of 13 adult lowland Sykes' and 1 of 2 adult blue
Sykes' were positive, yielding prevalences of 65.8%,
84.6% and 50.0%, respectively for adults of each subspecies. Among the wild born adult animals, 17 of 26
(65.4%) males and 20 of 27 (74.1%) females were positive. Although 1 of 2 (50.0%) wild born infant males and
1 of 1 (100.0%) wild born infant females were positive, 0
of 3 (0.0%) wild born juvenile males were positive. No

some of the samples violates the assumptions of this test.
Repeating this test using only adult animals is also statistically significant (p = 0.0293), however, the further
decrease in sample size using only the data from adult animals further violates the assumptions of this test.
Serosurvey of captive animals
Sixty seven individual serum samples were available from
captive animals. The overall seroprevalence in captivity
was 35.8% (24/67). This includes both sexes and all age
classes. Ten of 17 captive adult highland Sykes' and 3 of 4
captive adult lowland Sykes' were positive, yielding prevalences of 59.0% and 75.0%, respectively for these two
subspecies. No known captive Blue Sykes' were available
for testing. Among captive adult animals, 4 of 8 (50.0%)
males and 9 of 13 (69.2%) females were positive. Four of
16 (25.0%) captive infant males and 7 of 19 (36.8%) captive infant females were positive. However, no captive
juveniles (0 of 6 (0.0%) males and 0 of 5 (0.0%) females)
were positive. Tables 2 and 3 provide a breakdown of captive animal seroprevalence according to subspecies, and
age and sex, respectively. A Fisher's exact (2 × 2) contingency test for sex-related differences in the captive population yielded a p value of 0.646, indicating that sexrelated differences in captivity are not statistically significant. An exact 3 × 2 contingency test for age-related differences yielded a p value of 0.001, indicating that agerelated differences in captivity are statistically significant.
Serosurvey comparisons
The overall captive seroprevalence was 35.8%, which is
slightly lower than the overall wild seroprevalence of
46.8%. Infection prevalence was highest in adults at
69.8% for wild populations and 61.9% in captive populations. Adult females were infected at a higher prevalence
than adult males in both the wild (74.1% (20/27) for wild
adult females and 65.4% (17/26) for wild adult males)
and captive populations (69.2% (9/13) for captive adult
females and 50.0% (4/8) for captive adult males). Infants
were also found to have a high seroprevalence at 66.7%
(2/3) from wild populations and 31.4% (11/35) from
captivity, although few wild infants were surveyed. No
seropositive juveniles were identified from either wild (0/
3) or captive (0/11) populations. A Fisher's exact (2 × 2)
contingency test for sex-related differences in the combined wild and captive populations yielded a p value of
0.455. This indicates that while the there is a clear trend in
each data set showing higher prevalence among females,
the small numbers of samples do not show a statistically
significant difference between infection in males and
females. An exact 3 × 2 contingency test for age-related differences in the combined wild and captive populations
yielded a p value of 0.00001, indicating that age-related
differences in the combined populations are highly statistically significant.

Discussion
Previous SIV serosurveys of Cercopithecus mitis have used
assays relying on cross-reactivity between antibodies
against SIVsyk and other HIVs or SIVs. To assess the relative effectiveness of the use of cross-reactive tests, we compared serological results using two commercially available
HIV-1/HIV-2 ELISA kits with an authentic SIVsyk antigen
Western blot assay. The cross-reactive ELISA assays were
very specific and in only one out of 276 samples gave a
false positive result compared to the SIVsyk antigen Western assay. Curiously, this one particular captive juvenile
female was repeatedly positive by both ELISAs but repeatedly negative by Western. This animal may possibly have
been infected in captivity with a different SIV that produces cross-reactive antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, but
not to SIVsyk. On the other hand, the cross-reactive ELISAs failed to detect between 4.2 to 6.1% of the animals
that were positive by the SIVsyk antigen Western assay.
This result may be due to increased sensitivity using a
Western blot format, but is also possibly due to increased
sensitivity to the authentic SIVsyk viral antigens.
Variable SIV infection prevalences have previously been
reported in this species. However, information on age, sex
and captive or wild status was not provided in any previous survey. Lowenstine et al, 1986 [18] found no evidence
of infection in two captive Sykes' monkeys at US zoos
using an HIV-1 antigen based ELISA. Ohta, et al, 1988
[19], found 4 out of 18 (22%) Sykes' monkeys from East
Africa with evidence of infection, presumably by Western
using SIVagm antigen, but no further details were given.
Three other reports specifically tested Sykes' monkeys at
the Institute for Primate Research in Kenya, but it is
unknown which of the samples tested in this survey are
from the same animals. Emau, et al, 1991 [17], reported
59 out of 100 (59%) positive using a radioimmuno-precipitation assay cross-reactive with SIVsmm and SIVagm.
Tomonaga, et al, 1993 [20], reported 9 out of 35 (25%)
lowland Sykes', 13 out of 24 (54%) highland Sykes', and
1 out of 14 (7%) blue Sykes' positive using an immunofluorescence assay with SIVagm antigen. Otsyula et al,
1996 [14], reported 12 out of 35 (34%) positive by Western blot using SIVagm antigen and 8 out of 35 (23%) positive by Western blot using SIVsmm antigen. The low
incidence of infection reported by Otsyula, et al 1996 [14]
using Western blots with SIVagm as well as SIVsmm antigens supports the hypothesis that the increased sensitivity
in the present study is due to the use of SIVsyk antigens
and is not likely to be simply due to the use of Western
blot assay vs. ELISA.
To avoid age-related bias, a comparison between captive
and wild populations should be made using only adult
animals because the captive population contained many
more samples from infants and juveniles than did the

wild population (see Table 3). Both captive and wild
adults showed a much higher prevalence than previous
reports. Just over 60% of captive adults and nearly 70% of
wild adults were seropositive. However, in wild populations, seroprevalence varied greatly according to location
(from 0 to 90.9%) and this variability was statistically significant. The differences in seroprevalence may be due to
small sample sizes, however, the average troop size in this
species is approximately 10 animals [12] and we have
sampled between 4 and 34 animals from each individual
site (some sites have more than one troop present). Alternatively, host immunological parameters, genetic differences in virus strains, troop size, individual or troop
behavior, and habitat may all affect the seroprevalence of
these viruses among certain populations.

gated SIVsyk strain 173 in a human CEMx174 lymphoid
cell line expressing human CCR5. Comparisons between
the cross-reactive ELISAs and the SIVsyk Western assay
indicate that the antigen-specific Western assay is more
specific and sensitive, supporting the utility of using antigen-specific assays in this and other SIV serosurveys. We
report that using this Western assay, infection prevalence
is higher on average than previously reported, but that the
prevalence in wild populations is variable. In captivity
and in the wild, females are more commonly infected
than males, although these differences are not statistically
significant. Positive serology is also common in infants,
but no positive juveniles were identified. We interpret this
as evidence of maternal antibodies infants, but a low incidence of maternal-fetal transmission.

Although the small sample sizes did not provide statistical
significance, in both captive and wild animals, a higher
infection prevalence was seen in females than in males.
This possibly indicates a predominantly sexual transmission route, rather than transmission by aggressive behavior between males as has been shown in mandrills [21].
Sykes' monkeys usually live in a harem arrangement
where a dominant male controls sexual access to the
females in the troop. This may explain the variability in
seroprevalence among wild populations, since the infection status of a dominant male would heavily influence
the status of the entire troop. However, other breeding
strategies exist in this species and influxes of multiple solitary males into troops have been documented during
periods when multiple females are sexually receptive [22].
Unfortunately, we have no data on the breeding situations
in the sampled groups or which samples came from dominant versus lower status males.

Methods

In addition to the adults, a high seroprevalence was also
observed in infants. However, no seropositive juveniles
were identified, even though 14 juvenile animals were
sampled from both wild and captive populations. A possible explanation is that infants are seropositive due to the
presence of maternal antibodies in breast milk, but little
or no actual maternal-fetal transmission occurs either in
utero, during birth or through breastfeeding. An alternative possibility to consider is that SIVsyk infections could
be cleared by infants and that adult seroprevalence is due
to later exposure.

Conclusions
In order to investigate the infection prevalence of SIVsyk
in the common and widespread Sykes' monkey in East
Africa, we used two commercially available ELISA assays
and a novel SIVsyk antigen-specific Western blot assay to
perform a retrospective serosurvey of 276 previously collected serum samples from both wild and captive animals.
To develop the antigen-specific Western assay, we propa-

Specimens
The sera used in this study were obtained between 1981
and 1996 from animals that had been previously trapped
in the wild or from previously sampled captive animals
housed at the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi,
Kenya. Serum samples were stored continuously at -20°C.
All animals were captured, housed and sampled in
accordance with humane animal use guidelines established by the Kenya Institute of Primate Research. Wild
born monkey samples used in this study were derived
from eight locations. In general, these sites were rural or
suburban areas that bordered forested areas with natural
flowing water. These sites are typical of areas in which
humans have encroached on natural habitats and now
may come in contact with these monkeys as they forage
for food. The geography of the sites varied considerably
from heavily forested areas in the highlands of Kenya to
drier forests along the lowland coast of Kenya. The range
of the lowland Sykes' (C. mitis kibonotensis Lonnberg)
includes coastal and eastern regions of Kenya [11,13]. The
range of the highland Sykes' (C. mitis kolbi Neumann)
includes the upland central portion of the country
[11,13]. The range of the blue Sykes' (C. mitis stuhlmannii
Matschie) includes western Kenya and the border with
Uganda [11,13]. Some specimens from the wild came
from unknown locations and these are noted as such.
Captive animals used for breeding were housed in an area
composed of nine outdoor enclosures. Typically, breeding
groups were composed of approximately ten individuals.
Each breeding group consisted of a harem of one male
and four to six females, plus several infants. Infants were
left with mothers for a period of time and were usually
moved to another group between the age of six months
and two years to prevent inbreeding. Individuals not
involved in breeding were kept in groups composed of
approximately ten juvenile males and females in larger
outdoor enclosures. Animals were aged according to dental inspection and according to sexual maturity. Animals

ELISA Analysis
Serum samples were tested using the Innotest HIV-1/HIV2 Antibodies test (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and
Genscreen HIV1/2 version 2 (Biorad, Tokyo, Japan). The
Innotest ELISA kit uses synthetic peptides representing
HIV-1 subtype M envelope, HIV-2 envelope, and HIV-1
group O envelope antigens. The Genscreen uses purified
gp160 envelope and p25 nucleocapsid recombinant protein of HIV-1 and a peptide that mimics the immunodominant epitope of HIV-2 envelope. Each kit was used
according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Photometric measurements were performed with a Dynatech
MRX plate reader at 450 and 650 nm wavelengths. Positive and negative determinations were based upon cutoff
values as determined by the manufacturers' protocols.

Authors' contributions

Cells and Virus
CD4+ CEMx174 cells were transduced with a CCR5encoding vector (pBABE-puro-CCR5, a gift of David Dorsky, University of Connecticut) as previously described
[23]. The resulting CCR5 expressing cell line, designated
CEM-R5, was maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS
and 1 ug/ml puromycin. The SIVsyk-1.2 isolate (obtained
from the AIDS Reference and Reagents Program) was
inoculated into CEM-R5 and the CEMx174 parent cell
lines. After 7–14 days in culture, widespread syncytia formation was observed in CEM-R5 cells while few syncytia
were observed in the parental CEMx174 cells. Cell associated viral proteins were extracted from SIVsyk-1.2 infected
CEM-R5 cells grown for 7–10 days post-inoculation.
Western Blot Analysis
Serum samples were screened by Western blot using
SIVsyk-specific viral antigens. SIVsyk-1.2 infected cells
were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g and resuspended
in lysis buffer containing 1% triton, 50 mM tris pH 7.5, 2
mM EDTA. Cell debris was pelleted for 2 min. at 12,000 ×
g and the supernatant was added to loading buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS,
10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue. Viral antigens
were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membrane
strips were blocked with a solution of PBS-T containing
5% dry milk. Serum samples were diluted 1:500 and incubated for one hour at room temperature with individual
membrane strips. Primary serum antibodies were detected
with a 1:4,000 dilution of goat-anti-rhesus HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg,
Netherlands). Colorimetric detection was performed
using the Immunopure Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate
