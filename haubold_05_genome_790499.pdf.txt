Abstract
Background: Sequence comparison by alignment is a fundamental tool of molecular biology. In
this paper we show how a number of sequence comparison tasks, including the detection of unique
genomic regions, can be accomplished efficiently without an alignment step. Our procedure for
nucleotide sequence comparison is based on shortest unique substrings. These are substrings
which occur only once within the sequence or set of sequences analysed and which cannot be
further reduced in length without losing the property of uniqueness. Such substrings can be
detected using generalized suffix trees.
Results: We find that the shortest unique substrings in Caenorhabditis elegans, human and mouse
are no longer than 11 bp in the autosomes of these organisms. In mouse and human these unique
substrings are significantly clustered in upstream regions of known genes. Moreover, the probability
of finding such short unique substrings in the genomes of human or mouse by chance is extremely
small. We derive an analytical expression for the null distribution of shortest unique substrings,
given the GC-content of the query sequences. Furthermore, we apply our method to rapidly detect
unique genomic regions in the genome of Staphylococcus aureus strain MSSA476 compared to four
other staphylococcal genomes.
Conclusion: We combine a method to rapidly search for shortest unique substrings in DNA
sequences and a derivation of their null distribution. We show that unique regions in an arbitrary
sample of genomes can be efficiently detected with this method. The corresponding programs
shustring (SHortest Unique subSTRING) and shulen are written in C and available at http://
adenine.biz.fh-weihenstephan.de/shustring/.

Background
Sequence comparison is traditionally carried out using
alignments. The alignment procedure ensures that only
homologous positions are compared and corresponding
algorithms form the classical core of bioinformatics [1-3].

Once a sequence alignment has been computed, it can be
used to determine, for example, signature oligonucleotides or unique genomic regions among a group of
closely related organisms.

Shustrings on forward and backward strands
Shustrings on forward and backward strands. Global and local shortest unique substrings ('shustrings') in the DNAsequence ACCG. A: The global shustrings are A and G, and have length 1 (black numbers above the sequence). The numbers
above the sequence indicate the length of the four local shustrings A, CC, CG and G present on the forward strand. B: In the
presence of the reverse strand global as well as local shustrings may change. For some positions at the 3'end of the sequence
shustrings may not be defined (here, position 3 and 4 on the forward strand). Notice that the complement of a local shortest
unique substring is also unique, however not necessarily a shortest unique substring (for example the pair GT on the reverse
strand and AC on the forward strand). The complement of a global shortest unique substring is again a global shortest unique
substring (here the two global shustrings A and T).

Perhaps surprisingly, the applications of alignments just
mentioned – signature oligos and detection of unique
genomic regions – do not necessarily involve an alignment step. Since the computation of alignments tends to
take time proportional to the product of the lengths of the
sampled sequences, elimination of this step often leads to
dramatic increases in the speed of sequence analysis algorithms [4].
Our method of alignment-free sequence comparison is
based on the idea of "shortest unique substrings", that is,
the shortest substrings of a sequence which are not found
elsewhere. Consider for example the sequence S = ACCG.

 4 +1
It contains 
 = 10 substrings, of which the follow 2 

ing eight are unique: {A, AC, ACC, ACCG, CC, CCG, CG,
G}. Two of these are shortest unique substrings: {A, G}.
Such global shortest unique substrings can occur anywhere
in S. In contrast, we define local shortest unique substrings
to be tied to a specific position in S. More formally, we
determine for every position i in S the length x of the substring S[i..i + x - 1] such that it is unique while S[i..i + x 2] is not. In the case of our example string, the result is x
= 1 for the first position, x = 2 for the second, x = 2 for the
third, and x = 1 for the last. Figure 1A gives a graphical representation of these local shortest unique substrings.
So far we have only considered the forward strand of a
given DNA sequence. In the presence of the reverse strand,
the set of x-values changes to x = 1 for the first and x = 2
for the second position. No well-defined unique

substrings start at the third or the last position of the
sequence. Figure 1B illustrates the shortest unique substrings found on the forward and reverse strands of our
example sequence. It is important to realize that when
dealing with double-stranded DNA, the set of shortest
unique substrings is different from that found in singlestranded DNA. However, complementarity of DNA
ensures that the complement of a local shortest unique
substring is again a unique substring, though not necessarily a shortest unique substring (cf. Figure 1B). In contrast, the complement of a global shortest unique
substring is also a global shortest unique substring.
Application of shortest unique substrings to biological
problems requires both their efficient detection and
knowledge of their probability distribution. The latter is
derived in this paper. As to the detection of shortest
unique substrings, a data structure known as the suffix tree
can readily be used for this purpose [4]. We demonstrate
the utility of shortest unique substrings for sequence analysis by applying them to three tasks: (i) identification of
signature oligo nucleotide sequences, (ii) detection of
unique as well as repeat regions in the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, and (iii) detection of unique genomic
regions in strain MSSA476 of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus when compared to four other staphylococcal genomes.

on chromosome 1 of C. elegans – the shortest unique substrings in humans had the same length (11) as those
found in C. elegans, even though the human genome is 28
times larger than that of the nematode. When repeating
the search for global shortest unique substrings in the
mouse genome, whose size is similar to that of human
(2.49 Gb), we found a matching result: there were 255
shortest unique substring pairs of length 11 distributed
among the autosomes and the X-chromosome. On the Ychromosome there were 38 unique substring pairs of
length 12. The fact that the highly repetitive Y chromosome contained global unique substrings of length 12 as
compared to length 11 on autosomes suggested that the
length of shortest unique substrings is inversely related to
genome information content. In order to further explore
whether particularly short unique substrings are associated with functional regions of the genome, we investigated the distribution of globally shortest unique
substrings among 1 kb upstream regions of annotated
genes.
A total of 29 out of 2 × 350 shortest unique substrings
were located among a non-redundant set of 16,286
human 1 kb upstream regions. The probability of observing a single hit in an upstream region with one shortest
unique substring is equal to the fraction of the published
genome (considering again forward and backward
strands) covered by upstream regions. This is

Global shortest unique substrings in Caenorhabditis
elegans, human, and mouse
The genome of C. elegans is one of the smallest metazoan
genomes sequenced to date. It consists of five autosomes
and one sex chromosome, amounting to 100.29 Mb of
sequence information [5]. When searching for global
shortest unique substrings in this genome, we found a single complementary pair of unique motifs of length 10
located on chromosome 1. Considering the next shortest
unique substrings (length 11) we found a total of 10,509
such motif pairs distributed among the five chromosomes. Note that the search for these globally unique substrings was done with respect to the forward and
backward strands of the complete genome.

fh = 16286 × 1000/(2 × 2.84 × 109) ≈ 0.003.

We repeated this analysis for the human genome, which is
the largest genome sequenced to date. It consists of 22
autosomes and two sex chromosomes totalling 2.84 Gb
published sequence data [6]. We found 215 pairs of global shortest unique substrings of length 11 distributed on
the autosomes and the X-chromosome. The Y chromosome contained no unique sequences of length 11 but
135 globally unique sequence pairs of length 12.

fm = 13985 × 1000/(2 × 2.49 × 109) ≈ 0.003.

We were puzzled by the fact that – with the exception of
the single instance of a unique substring pair of length 10

The probability of observing 29 or more hits to upstream
regions under the null hypothesis of equal distribution is

A similar result was obtained for the mouse genome. Here
a total of 13,985 non-redundant upstream regions contained 22 of the 2 × 293 shortest unique substrings. The
probability of finding a single hit with one shortest
unique substring is again equal to the fraction of the published genome covered by the upstream regions:

with hits to upstream regions is available as supplementary material (see Additional file 1).
So far we have concentrated on the overall, i.e. global,
shortest unique substrings. In the following sections we
extend this analysis to include all local shortest unique
substrings.
Empirical distribution of local shortest unique substring
lengths
The pathogenic bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium has one
of the smallest genomes known for any free-living organism [11]. The 580,074 bp of its genome encode 480 open
reading frames and would be expected to be void of
redundant, that is repetitive, sequences. However, when
plotting the length of all local shortest unique substrings
contained in its genome, we detected 26 non-overlapping
shortest unique sequences longer than 100 bp, the longest
of which spanned 244 bp (Figure 2A). In other words, the
genome of M. genitalium contains a perfectly conserved
repeat sequence that is 244 - 1 = 243 bp long. The statistical significance of these repeats is illustrated in Figure 2B,
which displays the lengths of the shortest unique substrings in a shuffled version of M. genitalium's genome. In
such a scrambled sequence devoid of biological meaning
no shortest unique substring is longer than 21 bp. Having
found surprisingly short, as well as surprisingly long
shortest unique substrings, we proceed by deriving the
null distribution of shortest unique substring lengths.
Distribution of local shortest unique substring lengths
As explained further in the Methods section, the probabil-

ity of finding shortest unique substrings of length x, Plsu ,
,x
is the number of unique substrings of length x, Nlux ,
,
minus the number of unique substrings of length x - 1,

and 2p represents the GC-content of the genome (p ∈ [0,
1/2]). Figure 3 demonstrates that the fit between equation
(1) and the empirical distribution of local shortest unique
substrings (cf. Figure 2B) is excellent. Equation (1) provides an efficient method for establishing the statistical
significance of any given length of a local shortest unique
substring. Using equation (1) and knowing that the GCcontent of the genome of C. elegans is 0.3544, one expects
Nlux ≈

to find by chance alone 1.6 unique substrings of length
and 10 and 20,441 unique substrings of length 11. These
values agree with what we have found in the actual
genome of C. elegans (one pair of unique substrings of
length 10, and 10,509 pairs of length 11). However, again
based on equation (1), the probability of finding in the
human genome (GC-content = 0.4088) a unique substring of length 11 is less than 10-100. This is equivalent to
an expected number of only 2.4 × 10-94 of such unique
substrings and in sharp contrast to the observed value of
215 pairs of unique substrings of this length. The same
holds for mouse. Clearly, the lengths of the shortest
unique substrings found in mouse and human cannot be
explained by chance.
In addition to quantifying the probability of finding
shortest unique substrings, equation (1) also allows us to
estimate the lengths of unique oligos for arbitrary
genomes. In the case of the human genome the length distribution is shown in Figure 4. Notice that this distribution is strongly skewed to the right with 30 being the
highest length with an expected occupancy of ≥ 1.
Since equation (1) describes the length distribution of
shortest unique substrings in random sequences, it is also
the null-distribution for multiple, but phylogenetically
unrelated, sequences. This fact can be exploited for comparative genome analysis.
Comparing five strains of Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen notorious for
its resistance to multiple antibiotics [7]. Five genomes of
this bacterium are publicly available, which makes it one
of the best characterized bacterial species. Our aim was to
take strain MSSA476 [7] and identify the regions unique
to its genome when compared to the four other strains
available. Given the GC-content of Staphylococcus aureus
and the combined length of the five genomes analyzed,
we calculated the expected distribution of shortest unique
substring lengths using equation (1). Figure 5 shows that
for unrelated S. aureus sequences of the same combined
length (14.21 × 106) and composition (GC-content 0.33)
as the strains investigated, the lengths of shortest unique
substrings are expected to range from 9 to 27. We decided
to analyze the local shortest unique substrings of length ≤
10 in strain MSSA476 in the presence of the genomes of
the four other strains. Figure 6 displays the cumulative distribution of the local shortest unique substrings of length
≤ 10 along the genome of strain MSSA476. Regions
unique to MSSA476 contain a high density of such substrings and hence stand out as jumps in the cumulative
plot. Figure 6 shows two such jumps. These correspond
exactly to the two unique regions ΦSa4 and SCC476
recently annotated as the only two unique regions in
MSSA476 [7].

Discussion
The search for unique substrings has a long tradition in
molecular biology. It is fundamental for many sequencebased identification techniques, and affects PCR primer
design as well as the development of specific antibodies.
A DNA or protein sequence of length n contains

 n +1

 = n(n + 1) / 2 substrings, which is also an upper
 2 
limit for the number of unique substrings. This means
that in most real world situations there is in an excess of
unique substrings to choose from. Since a given unique
substring remains unique upon extension, we decided to
concentrate on the shortest unique substrings. In their
global version they have minimal length with respect to
the entire sample of sequences investigated. In contrast,
their local version is defined for substrings starting from a

specific position in the genome. There are of the order of
n such local shortest unique substrings from which all the
remaining unique substrings can be generated. Shortest
unique substrings therefore lead to considerable space
reduction when dealing with unique substrings.
Our technique for detecting such unique substrings is
applicable to protein as well as to DNA sequence data.
Antibodies are widely used in basic biomedical research;
in addition, there is growing interest in applying them as
therapeutics. A major design goal in generating antibodies
to a given protein in all of these contexts is to maximize
their specificity. Since the entire proteome of important
biomedical model organisms, including human, is
known, epitope selection might be guided not only by
considerations of antigenicity, but also of uniqueness. In
a preliminary study of the human proteome we found

that 88% of the 27,175 human proteins we looked at contain at least one unique hexapeptide. Given that a typical
epitope consists of 6 to 12 amino acids, this suggests that
our method of detecting shortest unique substrings coupled with epitope prediction programs might also be useful for antibody development.

that genomes contain a core of high-complexity
sequences which determine the length of global shortest
unique substrings. The size of this high-complexity core is
apparently much less variable across metazoan genomes
than raw genome size, hence the observed constancy of
global shortest unique substring lengths.

However, in this paper we have concentrated on shortest
unique substrings in genomes. The fact that the length of
global shortest unique substrings does not exceed 11 in
autosomes of both C. elegans and humans is intriguing
given the widely differing sizes of the two genomes and
the extremely small probability of observing unique
sequences of length 11 by chance in the human genome.
Since the length of global shortest unique substrings
remained constant after we had removed repetitive elements from the genomes, we take this as an indication

These global shortest unique substrings can be used as
starting points for developing signature oligos. Such oligos are widely used in biotechnology and taxonomy. A
typical application in biotechnology is PCR-primers that
should be unique to the target sequence. In taxonomy a
recent initiative for the "Barcoding of Life" http://barcod
ing.si.edu/ attempts to "label" all extant species by assigning a short unique DNA-sequence to them.

Figure 5 probability distribution in five randomized strains of Staphylococcus aureus
Shustring
Shustring probability distribution in five randomized strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Observed and expected distributions of the lengths x of local shortest unique substrings. Parameters l = 1.42·107 and 2p = 0.330 correspond to the combined length and average GC-content of five strains of Staphylococcus aureus.

The probability of finding a shortest unique substring of
some length can be readily computed using equation (1).
However, this equation is highly sensitive to the value of
the parameter p, which describes the sequence composition. Hence, local variation in sequence composition will
strongly affect the expected length of both local and global shortest unique substrings. This fact may also have
contributed to our observation that shortest unique substrings cluster in upstream regions of genes in both the
mouse and the human genomes. The euchromatic part of
the human genome has an average GC-content of 0.41
(http://genome.ucsc.edu, Human genome assembly
hg16), which is similar to the value of 0.42 for the mouse
(http://genome.ucsc.edu, Mouse genome assembly
mm4). In contrast, the global shortest unique substrings
we found in humans have a GC-content of 0.59 and those
found in mouse have a GC-content of 0.61. The upstream

regions of genes tend to be GC-rich in human (GC-content = 0.53) as well as mouse (GC-content = 0.50), which
might account for the clustering of global shortest unique
substrings in these regions.
Detection of unique genomic regions is traditionally done
by alignment-based approaches. However, the run-time
of these algorithms depends non-linearly on the number
and lengths of the input sequences and also on the degree
of relatedness of the input sequences. In contrast, the
scheme for detecting unique genomic regions proposed in
this paper has a run time that is strictly linear in the combined lengths of the input sequences.

Conclusion
There is currently a lot of interest in comparative genomics [8]. In many of these projects detection of regions

unique to a genome is one of the first steps towards functional annotation (e. g. [7]). Given equation (1), the size
distribution of shortest unique substrings in random, i.e.
unrelated, sequences can be predicted. This leads to our
method of detecting unique genomic regions from an
arbitrary set of input sequences without the need for alignment. Its usefulness for comparative genomics is clearly
demonstrated in the case of the genomes of S. aureus,
where we could rapidly detect the two unique regions previously annotated in one strain [7] (Figure 5).

Methods
Detection of shortest unique substrings
Two methods borrowed from computer science were used
for the detection of shortest unique substrings: suffix tree
construction and hashing. Suffix trees are well described
by Gusfield [4] and we follow his nomenclature. To use
suffix trees for detecting unique substrings, notice that the
path label of any leaf is a unique substring. The set of
shortest unique substrings at every position can therefore
be discovered by traversing the tree once and looking up

Page 9 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:123

the string depth of the parent node of every leaf. This value
plus one is the desired length of the shortest unique string
that starts at the position indicated by the leaf.
Hashing is described, for example, by Cormen et al. [[9],
ch. [11]] and we used it for detecting global shortest
unique substrings in large genomes.
Unless stated otherwise, all computations presented in
this paper consider both strands of the DNA sequences
concerned. Note that in this case, and due to complementarity of DNA, a single parameter (p) suffices to describe
nucleotide composition.
The probability distribution of local shortest unique
substring lengths in nucleotide sequences
Consider a nucleotide sequence S and let 2p denote the
GC-content of S (p ∈ [0, 1/2]). A shortest unique substring
of length x of this nucleotide sequence is defined as a
unique substring S[i..i + x - 1] where S[i..i + x - 2] is not
unique. We wish to derive the probability distribution of
values of x under the assumption of random sequence
composition.

We start by considering a particular substring of length x
consisting of k positions occupied by either G or C each.
We refer to such a substring as being of type (x, k). The
probability of finding a substring of type (x, k) is
Px,k = (1/2 - p)x - k pk.
Assuming that l independent trials each having a success
probability of Px,k are performed, the probability of finding a particular sequence of type (x, k) exactly once is then

Plux ,k ≈ lPx ,k (1 − Px ,k )l −1.
,
This expression is only approximately valid, since the
nucleotide compositions of any two overlapping subtrings are not independent. Still, from now on we assume
independence. The error introduced by this assumption is
negligible, if the genome size, l, is large compared to the
length of the considered substrings (l >> x) - which is the
case we have in mind. Thus, we replace the ≈-sign in the
above and following expressions by = and define

Plux ,k = lPx ,k (1 − Px ,k )l −1.
,
x
For each sequence of type (x, k), there are   2x permuk
tations of k "G|C" s and (x - k) "A|T" s. Some of these permutations occur zero times in S, some occur multiple
times and some occur exactly once. We are interested in
the latter: the number of unique substrings of type (x, k) is

x
Nlux ,k =   2x Plux ,k .
,
,
k
In order to determine the number of unique substrings
irrespective of their sequence composition, we need to
sum over all possible values of k:

Nlux =
,

x

∑ Nlu,x,k

k =0

The number of shortest unique substrings of length x,

Nlsu , is then simply the number of unique substrings of
,x
length x minus the number of unique substrings of length
x - 1. In order to see this, notice that all unique substrings
of length x - 1 are contained in the set of unique substrings
of length x. Those that are gained by adding the extra
nucleotide are precisely the substrings that lose their
uniqueness when reduced in length by one as required by
the definition of shortest unique substring:
su
u
u
Nl,x = Nl,x − Nl,x-1.

Finally, the probability of finding such a shortest unique
substring of length x, Plsu , is the number of unique short,x
est substrings of length x divided by the genome length:

Plsu =
,x

Nlsu

l

Implementation
The search for shortest unique substrings is implemented
in our program shustring (SHortest Unique subSTRING).
The distribution of shortest unique substring lengths in
genomic sequences as embodied in equation (1) is implemented in our program shulen. Both pieces of software
are
available
from
http://adenine.biz.fh-weihen
stephan.de/shustring/.
Data
Genome sequences of the nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) [5], mouse (Mus musculus) [10], and human (Homo
sapiens) [6] as well as 1 kb upstream regions for genes in
the genomes of human and mouse were obtained from
the University of California Santa Cruz genome website at
the following URLs:
