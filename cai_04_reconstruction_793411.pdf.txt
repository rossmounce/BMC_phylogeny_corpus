Abstract
Background: Modern-day proteins were selected during long evolutionary history as descendants
of ancient life forms. In silico reconstruction of such ancestral protein sequences facilitates our
understanding of evolutionary processes, protein classification and biological function. Additionally,
reconstructed ancestral protein sequences could serve to fill in sequence space thus aiding remote
homology inference.
Results: We developed ANCESCON, a package for distance-based phylogenetic inference and
reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences that takes into account the observed variation of
evolutionary rates between positions that more precisely describes the evolution of protein
families. To improve the accuracy of evolutionary distance estimation and ancestral sequence
reconstruction, two approaches are proposed to estimate position-specific evolutionary rates.
Comparisons show that at large evolutionary distances our method gives more accurate ancestral
sequence reconstruction than PAML, PHYLIP and PAUP*. We apply the reconstructed ancestral
sequences to homology inference and functional site prediction. We show that the usage of
hypothetical ancestors together with the present day sequences improves profile-based sequence
similarity searches; and that ancestral sequence reconstruction methods can be used to predict
positions with functional specificity.
Conclusions: As a computational tool to reconstruct ancestral protein sequences from a given
multiple sequence alignment, ANCESCON shows high accuracy in tests and helps detection of
remote homologs and prediction of functional sites. ANCESCON is freely available for noncommercial use. Pre-compiled versions for several platforms can be downloaded from ftp://

Background
Present-day protein sequences can be used to reconstruct
ancestral sequences based on a model of sequence evolution. Such knowledge about ancestral sequences is helpful
for understanding the evolutionary processes as well as
the functional aspects of a protein family. Existing meth-

ods of ancestral sequence reconstruction can be divided
into two main categories: Maximum Parsimony (MP)
methods [1,2] and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods
[3-5]. MP methods do not take into account biased substitution patterns between amino acids or different tree
branch lengths, and cannot distinguish those equally

parsimonious reconstructions [3]. ML methods do not
have these limitations and generally give more reliable
results than the MP methods [6]. Yang et al. [3] first developed a ML method for ancestral sequence reconstruction.
Yang [7] also made a distinction between "joint" reconstruction and "marginal" reconstruction. Joint reconstruction methods intend to find the most likely set of amino
acids for all internal nodes at a site, which yields the maximum joint likelihood of the tree [5]. Marginal reconstruction compares the probabilities of different amino
acids at an internal node at a site and selects the amino
acid that yields the maximum likelihood for the tree at
that site. Marginal reconstruction can also compute probabilities of all other amino acids for that node [4]. Koshi
and Goldstein [4] developed a fast dynamic programming
algorithm for marginal reconstruction in the framework
of Bayesian statistics, while Pupko et al. [5] proposed a
fast algorithm for joint reconstruction. The computational
complexities for both algorithms scale linearly with the
number of sequences. Both marginal and joint reconstruction algorithms are implemented in our program.
All reconstruction methods require a phylogenetic tree
inferred from a given alignment. The quality of the tree is
crucial for the reliability of reconstruction. A number of
methods exist for phylogenetic inference, such as maximum likelihood [8], distance-based [9] and parsimony
[1]. Distance-based methods have the advantage of being
simple and are able to handle a large set of sequences.
They require evolutionary distances estimated for all the
sequence pairs. The most common method to infer phylogeny from distances is based on the neighbor-joining
algorithm [9]. Bruno et al. [10] introduced a distancebased phylogeny reconstruction method called "Weighbor", i.e. "weighted neighbor joining", which takes into
account the fact that errors in distance estimates are larger
for longer distances. Giving similar results, Weighbor is
much faster than ML phylogeny reconstruction. It is also
better than other methods such as BIONJ [11] and parsimony [1], in aspects of "long branches attract" and "long
branch distracts" problems [10]. Weighbor is used in our
program for phylogenetic inference.
Overwhelming evidence exists for substitution rate variation across sites [12-15]. For a protein family, rate heterogeneity reflects the selective pressure imposed by folding,
stability and function. Gamma distribution is widely used
to model the rate variation among sites [13,16,17]
because of its simplicity. Nielsen [18] suggested a method
for site-by-site estimation of rate factors by a Maximum
Likelihood approach. Rate variation among sites has not
been taken into account in the early work of ML reconstruction of ancestral sequences [4,5]. Recently, Pupko et
al. [19] introduced rate variation into joint reconstruction
by a branch-and-bound algorithm, assuming a gamma

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/33

distribution of rates among sites. In our package, two
methods are proposed to estimate a rate factor for each
site. The first one is based on our observation that the substitution rate at a site is correlated with the conservation
of the site. The more conserved the site is in a multiple
sequence alignment, the smaller its substitution rate is.
This empirical method, the result of which we call Alignment-Based rate factors or αAB, relies only on a multiple
sequence alignment and a general model of amino acid
exchange. The other one is a maximum likelihood
method (αML), which requires a tree. In our implementation, we incorporate αAB or αML in the joint and marginal
reconstruction algorithms [4,5]. αAB is also used in the
Maximum Likelihood estimation of evolutionary distances [20] for tree inference.
We implement a method of evolutionary simulation that
introduces site-specific rate variations in a natural way by
imposing structural and functional constraints [21]. We
show by simulations that the reconstruction methods can
give reasonable results and that the problem of evolutionary distance underestimation [22] is alleviated by considering rate variation across sites.
Background (or equilibrium) amino acid frequencies (π)
are usually estimated from the target set of sequences or
from large databases of protein families. Background
amino acid frequencies estimated from a small dataset
tend to have bias, while amino acid frequencies from large
databases may not be suitable for the specific protein family under analysis. Here, we propose a ML method to optimize the amino acid frequency vector π. The optimized π
vector can give significant improvement over the likelihood of a alignment.
Information obtained from ancestral sequence reconstruction is used for two applications: homology detection and prediction of functional sites. For homology
detection, ancestral sequences represent an enlargement
of the sequence space around native sequences. We demonstrate that adding reconstructed ancestral sequences to
a native alignment improves the detection of homologs in
database searches.
A number of methods have been developed to predict
functional sites from amino acid sequences [23,24]. One
simple way to infer functional sites is by positional conservation of a multiple sequence alignment [25]. Lichtarge
et al. [26] proposed a method called evolutionary trace to
predict functional sites by analyzing the conservation of
sequence subgroups. Functional divergence during the
evolutionary process can be reflected in the variation of
amino acid usage across different functional subgroups.
We propose a new approach that uses information from
ancestral sequence reconstruction to identify sites that are

well conserved within individual sub-trees but exhibit variability among different sub-trees. By several examples, we
show that these sites frequently contribute to the functional specificity of a protein family.

Results and discussion
We developed a package (ANCESCON) to reconstruct
ancestral protein sequences considering rate variation
among sites. Rate factors can be estimated either by an
empirical method or by a maximum likelihood method.
Consideration of rate variation among sites not only
improves evolutionary distance estimation, but also gives
more accurate ancestral sequence reconstruction. Ancestral sequences are used to improve profile-based sequence
similarity searches. We also propose a new approach to
predict positions with functional specificity based on the
reconstruction of ancestral sequences.
Observed α, Alignment Based Rate Factor α (αAB) and
Rate Factor α estimated by Maximum Likelihood (αML)
Evolutionary simulations based on a Z-score model introduce rate variation across sites in a natural way by incorporating structural and functional constraints specific for
a protein family [21]. The simulation procedure is a
Monte Carlo simulation of the amino acid substitution
process. The fixation of substitutions is dictated by a simple scoring function, which is derived from the template
structure and an alignment of its homologs. The number
of substitutions occurring at each site can be recorded during the simulation process and the observed α at a site
equals the number of recorded substitutions at that site
divided by the average substitution number for all sites.
To reduce sampling variance, an average observed α vector is calculated from 100 simulations.

For the alignment consisting of all the leaf node sequences
generated by the simulation process, an αAB vector was calculated according to equation (11) (for details see Methods). An average αAB vector was derived from 100
simulations. Correlation coefficient between the average
αAB vector and the average observed α vector was high
(data not shown). However, we found that for large
observed α values, the corresponding αAB values were
smaller. A constant β was introduced to correct this underestimation in equation (11).

Here, αi is Alignment-Based rate factor at site i. K is the
number of sites in a given alignment. Ci is the value
assigned to site i (for details see Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/33

We optimized the β value by fitting the average αAB vector
and average observed α vector to y = x line. Alignments for
three different protein families (trypsin, carboxypeptidase
and pdz domain) gave a good empirical estimation for β
of about 1.3. The relation between this corrected average
αAB vector and average observed α vector is shown in Figure 1a for a typical example, the pdz domain (correlation
coefficient 0.973).
We also estimated an αML vector for each alignment generated from the simulation (for details see Methods). The
average αML vector shows good correlation with the average observed α vector (Figure 1b) (correlation coefficient
0.945). αAB or αML can be incorporated in likelihood calculation in marginal or joint reconstruction. Table 1
shows that improvement of logarithm likelihood of the
alignment is significant when αAB or αML is used.
Rate variation across sites can be modeled by assuming
that the rate factors follow a certain type of statistical distribution. Gamma distribution [13,27] and its discrete
approximations [28] are frequently used for DNA or protein sequences. Rate variation for a protein family reflects
different selective pressure at different sites to maintain
structure and function. Fewer substitutions are expected
to occur in more conserved sites. This hypothesis has
prompted us to estimate rate factors (αAB) based on
sequence conservation in an empirical way. The αAB is
compared and calibrated using the observed α as standards. Our method of estimating αML is similar to the one
proposed by Nielson [18]. One problem with site-by-site
rate factor estimation is the small sample size at each site,
especially with a small alignment. We have used αAB to
eliminate outliers with very large αML estimates (for details
see Methods).
Site-specific rate factors improve distance estimation
Evolutionary distances tend to be underestimated when
rate homogeneity among sites is assumed [22]. This was
tested using the simulation with structural and functional
constraints. For the arbitrarily selected tree shown in Figure 2, we obtained leaf node sequences in the simulation
and estimated an evolutionary distance for each sequence
pair by Maximum Likelihood, either incorporating αAB or
setting α equal to 1.0 (equation (16)). Evolutionary distances were severely underestimated (average underestimation: 0.894) without considering rate variation among
sites (Figure 3a). Introducing αAB in the maximum likelihood method gave more accurate distance estimation
(Figure 3b), although the distances were still underestimated, especially for small distances (average underestimation: 0.286). We believe that more accurate distances
will give more accurate phylogeny reconstruction using
"Weighbor" [10]. Since a tree is required to estimate αML,

αML is not incorporated in estimating evolutionary
distance.
Optimization of equilibrium frequencies
A continuous minimization method by simulated annealing was used to optimize the equilibrium frequency vector
π, with the objective function being the logarithm likelihood of the alignment. Our π vector optimization program was tested on four alignments, which were taken
from the SH2 and SH3 superfamilies in Pfam database
(version 7.3) [29]. Two alignments from the SH2 superfamily have 44 and 87 sequences respectively and both
alignment lengths are 83 amino acids (including gaps).
The other two alignments from SH3 superfamily have 39
and 94 sequences respectively and both alignment lengths
are 57 amino acids (including gaps). For each alignment,
we ran optimization 3 times starting from different random initial points. The optimized π vectors did not converge to exactly the same point, but they had a high
correlation with each other (always > 0.95) and the difference of logarithm likelihood function values was small
(less than 0.1%). The logarithm likelihood of the alignment, using optimized π vector, increased slightly, but significantly (Table 2), compared with the logarithm
likelihood using the π vector calculated from the
alignment.

Optimization of the π vector is time consuming. The running time for reconstruction with or without optimizing π
vector is 14,902 seconds and 213 seconds for SH2 alignment (44 sequences), respectively, on a Dell PowerEdge
8450 server (CPU 700MHz, RAM 8G) (Table 2). In our
program, the default π vector is calculated from the alignment while the user has the option to optimize the π vector for ancestral sequence reconstruction.

Testing reconstruction
Two different methods for simulations of the evolutionary process were used, as described in Methods, to test the
reliability of the reconstruction results. In the first simulation method, starting from a randomly generated root
sequence, we simulated the evolutionary process to
obtain leaf node sequences based on a tree and a rate
matrix. This process was repeated 100 times for a given
root sequence R to produce 100 alignments consisting of
all leaf node sequences. For each of the 100 alignments,
we used the marginal reconstruction method to obtain an
amino acid probability vector for each site at the root. To
reduce sampling variance, the amino acid probability vector was averaged over the 100 simulation trials. At each
site, the amino acid with the highest average probability
was chosen as our result of the "reconstructed amino acid"
at that site. All "reconstructed amino acids" formed the
reconstructed sequences R'. There is no difference
between R and R', that is, the accuracy of reconstruction is
100% for the tree shown in Figure 2. For each individual
simulation and its reconstruction, we checked the amino
acid with the highest probability in the reconstructed
probability vector of the root. If it is indeed the "reconstructed amino acid", the prediction for that simulation is
correct according to the average reconstructed results. The
fraction of individual predictions that are correct
according to the average reconstructed results is almost
always higher than the average probability of the "reconstructed amino acid", suggesting that the average
probability of the "reconstructed amino acid" gives a
lower estimation of the reconstruction reliability (Figure
4a).

For the second simulation method, we introduced rate
heterogeneity across sites with structural and functional
constraints [21]. For the same tree, the accuracy of reconstruction was about 90%. Sites with larger substitution
rates are expected to have less reliable reconstructions. Figure 4b shows the relationship between the average αAB
and the fraction of individual predictions that are correct
according to the "reconstructed amino acid". Sites with
incorrect "reconstructed amino acids" all have large αAB
values. These values reflect the difficulty of reconstructing
sites with large numbers of substitutions. The probabilities of the "reconstructed amino acids" are all small for
sites with incorrect reconstructions (less than 0.15),
suggesting that the information content of the reconstruction is low.
The second simulation method was also used to test ANCESCON along with the reconstruction programs from
PAML [30], PHYLIP [31] and PAUP* [32]. All tree topologies used in reconstruction tests were inferred from real
alignments. All original root sequences were taken from
PDB database [33]. We had three different types of

alignment testing sets. The first testing set used the same
tree topology but different root sequences to generate 100
alignments (for details see Methods). The second testing
set used the same root sequence but different tree topologies. The third testing set randomly selected a root
sequence and a tree topology to generate 100 alignments.
After 100 alignments were generated, we reconstructed
the root sequence for each alignment and found the consensus root sequence for the 100 reconstructed root
sequences. Finally, the consensus root sequence was compared with the original root sequence to calculate the
reconstruction accuracy, i.e. the fraction of correctly
reconstructed sites for the root sequence. In addition, for
the third test, the paired t-test was used to calculate the
one-tail probability between ANCESCON and other three
methods. In order to make different tree topologies comparable, those trees were scaled to make the average distance from root to all leaf nodes (da) the same for all trees
and equal to the tree of pii1 (a signal transduction protein) (da = 4.23). If da was too small (e.g. 0.5), the
reconstruction accuracy was always close to 1 for all reconstruction methods used. The value da = 4.23 was large
enough to generate diverse sequences to differentiate 4
different ancestral sequence reconstruction methods.
For ANCESCON we had 3 different parameter settings,
which included site-specific rate factors estimated by maximum likelihood method (αML), Alignment-Based rate
factors (αAB) and no rate factors (equal rates among sites).
Different parameters were also used for the reconstruction
programs from PAML and PHYLIP to find their best
reconstructions. For PAML, reconstruction was tested with
parameter α (rate factor) estimated from alignment and
without α. For PHYLIP, 4 different parameter settings
were tried, which were combinations of with/without α
estimated from alignment by PAML and with/without
branch length dwelling in input tree topology. For
PAUP*, default settings were used.
Table 3 shows a comparison of the reconstruction accuracy for these 4 methods. The reconstruction accuracy of
ANCESCON with αML is higher than the other three methods in almost every test. Also the reconstruction accuracy
of ANCESCON with αAB and without α is comparable
with PAML and PHYLIP methods and is much better than
PAUP*. For the first testing set, the best average accuracy
for ANCESCON is about 0.5, while the best average reconstruction accuracies for PAML, PHYLIP and PAUP* are
0.45, 0.39 and 0.32 respectively. Testing set 2 and 3
produce similar results. Using the paired t-test in the third
testing set, we show that ANCESCON method with αML
gives significantly better reconstruction than the other 3
methods. Because the site-specific αML is very close to the
true mutation rate at a site (Figure 1b), using the site-specific αML can improve our ability to reconstruct the amino

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/33

acids for ancestral sequences correctly. These reconstruction tests suggest that ANSCESCON may be a better tool
to reconstruct ancestral sequences compared to PAML,
PHYLIP and PAUP* if the given alignment contains more
diverse sequences.
Ancestral sequences used in homology detection
Thirty-eight OB (Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold [34] proteins and ten other alignments (adenylyl kinase, gef, globin, pdz, ph, ptb, ras, sh2, sh3 and
subtilase) from the Pfam database (version 7.3) [29] were
chosen to perform homology detection tests.

Given an alignment with N sequences, we had four different methods, "BEST", "SECOND BEST", "SHUFFLE" and
"RANDOM", to generate another N-1 sequences (for
details see Methods). For each combined alignment (2N1 sequences), PSI-BLAST [35] searches were performed
starting from each sequence and seeded with the combined alignment (-B option in the program BLASTPGP, evalue cutoff 0.01), and all found hits were pooled
together.
The benchmark experiment was PSI-BLAST seeded with
the native alignment (N sequences). For each type of the
four combined alignments, we checked hits not found by
the native alignments. New hits were verified to be true
positives or false positives by running PSI-BLAST or
HMMER [36], followed by manual inspections.
Using the 48 native alignments, a total of 13973 hits were
found by the benchmark. Compared to the benchmark,
the "BEST" method detected 120 new homologs and the
other three methods found 69, 74 and 9 new homologs,
respectively (Figure 5). Among those new homologs,
"BEST", "SECOND BEST", "SHUFFLE" and "RANDOM"
methods had 3, 2, 6 and 3 false positives, respectively
(Figure 5). Also, "BEST", "SECOND BEST", "SHUFFLE"
and "RANDOM" methods missed 61, 1070, 60 and 7811
homologs as compared to the benchmark.
Adding non-native sequences to the native alignment
results in a change of sequence profile for PSI-BLAST
searches. Random sequences can dilute the position-specific amino acid exchange characteristics of native alignments. This effect should not improve the profile. Indeed,
few new homologs are found by the "RANDOM" method.
However, sequences generated by shuffling each position
of the native alignment have the same conservation properties as the native alignment, and the "SHUFFLE"
method detects a total of 74 new homologs. Two effects
may account for this finding. First, addition of shuffled
sequences to the native alignment can slightly change the
estimates of pseudocount frequencies of amino acids and
thus the position specific scoring matrix [35]. Second, the

All root sequences are taken from PDB database and the names listed in the table are PDB IDs.
Tree topologies for gef (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), LacI (PurR/LacI family of bacterial transcription factors), pdz, ph, pii1 (a signal
transduction protein), ptb, sh2, sh3 and GST (glutathione S-transferase) are inferred from multiple sequence alignments chosen from Pfam database
(version 7.3).
All tree topologies are generated from real alignments and the distances are rescaled in order to make the trees comparable.
The value in this table represents the accuracy of reconstruction, i.e. the fraction of correctly reconstructed sites for the root sequence. The best
reconstruction accuracy in each test is shown in bold.
αML means that the site-specific rate factors were estimated by maximum likelihood method.
αAB means that the site-specific rate factors were estimated by our empirical equation based on the given alignment (for details see Methods).
-α means that the rate factors were not considered in reconstruction.
+α means that the rate factors were considered in reconstruction.
+L means that branch lengths of the input tree were used in reconstruction, while -L means that branch lengths were estimated by the
reconstruction program itself.
@: tree topology for GST had 140 leaf nodes that were too many for PAML to run through.
$: rate factors estimated by PAML were used by PHYLIP in ancestral sequence reconstruction.
#: tree topology for GST had 140 leaf nodes, which were too many for PAML to estimate rate factors for GST.
&:GST is excluded in calculation of the average.
∆: paired t-test method [40] was used to estimate the one-tail probability between ANCESCON and the other three reconstruction methods.

new version of PSI-BLAST program uses compositionbased statistics with e-value estimation related to the composition of the query sequence [37]. Each shuffled
sequence has its own amino acid composition that is
different from the native sequences. This difference can
affect the e-values of hits. The "BEST" method detects the

most number of new homologs, suggesting that the reconstructed ancestral sequences resemble the native
sequences. Ancestral sequences may therefore be more
similar to some remote homologs than to the native
sequences. The "SECOND BEST" method detects less new
homologs than the "BEST" method but more than the

among sub-trees. These sites are likely to contribute to
functional specificity. Based on a tree partition and the
reconstructions at the cutting nodes (details see Methods),
we have developed a measure called specificity score
(equation (27)). We expect that both highly variable sites
and highly conserved sites tend to score low in our
method. Ten top-ranking sites were selected as our predicted functional sites for each family. For comparison,
we also implemented a simple conservation (SC) method
[25], the evolutionary trace (ET) method [26] and the
conservation difference (CD) method [21] on the 10 protein families. The results are shown in Table 5. Here, the
results from these three methods tend to include invariant
or highly conserved sites while the result from our
method scores those sites low. Still, the number of true
positives of our method is comparable to other methods
for several families. For some protein families, such as gef,
pdz and subtilase, our method predicts no fewer functional residues than the other three methods.

Prediction of functional sites
Ten well-studied protein families (adenylyl kinase, gef,
globin, pdz, ph, ptb, ras, sh2, sh3 and subtilase) from the
Pfam database (version 7.3) [29] were selected to test the
prediction of functional sites. To define functional sites,
we considered residues falling within 5Å of any ligand to
be functionally important (i.e. AP5 for adenylyl kinase).
As a simple quantification of prediction accuracy, we
counted the number of predictions that lie within 5Å from
the ligands and consider these sites to be true positives.

Our method intends to identify those sites with high similarity within individual sub-trees and high variation

Mapping6top 10 predictions by ANCESCON to PDZ domain (PDB ID: 1be9) [50]
Mapping top 10 predictions by ANCESCON to PDZ domain (PDB ID: 1be9) [50]. The color code scheme: ligand is
shown in green and the predicted functional residues are shown in red.

Figure 6 shows the mapping of our predictions on the
structure for the PDZ domain family. In green color is the
ligand and in red color are the functional residues predicted by our method. Six of the predicted residues are
within 5Å to the peptide ligand. Nine of the predicted residues are around the ligand binding area. Only one is distant from the ligand (Figure 6).
Another example is the family of adenylyl kinases. Our
method identified 3 residues within 5 Å to the ligand
while the other 3 methods identified more such residues,
most of which are in highly conserved positions such as
the catalytic residues. Highly conserved residues,
however, are not selected by our method since our meas-

ure is designed to emphasize on sites contributing to
specificity. Figure 7 shows the N-terminal part of the
alignment of adenylyl kinases, with our predictions highlighted in red and orange colors. The evolutionary tree for
the alignment is shown in Figure 8. The first cutting layer
(for details see Methods) results in two well-separated
sub-trees. Functional annotations suggest that they contain enzymes with different substrate preferences: adenylyl kinases and uridylate kinases, respectively. Three
residues (27, 54 and 89) from our predictions (red
colored in Figure 9) contribute to substrate-binding specificity, as have been noted before in the structural studies
of the UMP kinases [38]. Figure 9 highlights our predicted
functional residues on the adenylyl kinase protein

Conclusions
We developed a package (ANCESCON) to reconstruct
ancestral protein sequences that takes into account the
variation of substitution rates among sites. Two methods
were proposed to estimate site-specific evolutionary rates
(α), namely Alignment-Based rate factor (αAB) and rate
factor α estimated by maximum likelihood (αML).
Consideration of rate variation among sites can alleviate
the underestimation of evolutionary distances. Accuracy
of ancestral sequence reconstruction by our method is
higher than that of PAML, PHYLIP and PAUP* when the

given alignment contains more diverse sequences. We
show that reconstructed ancestral sequences help to
improve detection of distant homologs and prediction of
functional sites with specificity.

Methods
Transition probability and likelihood calculations
For all models discussed in this paper, we assume all sites
in an alignment evolve independently and according to a
homogeneous, stationary and time reversible Markov
process. The probability of an amino acid i to be replaced
by amino acid j after a time interval t is Pij(t). The transition probability matrix of 20 amino acids is written as
P(t), which can be calculated as

Here, Q is the rate matrix. The non-diagonal elements qij
are the instantaneous rates of change from amino acid i to

S is the matrix of amino acid exchangeability parameters
[39]. πi is the equilibrium frequency for amino acid i.
Time reversibility implies that S is a symmetric matrix. In
our program, the S matrix is taken from Whelan and

Goldman [39] and the default π vector is estimated from
the given alignment.

Alignment-Based Rate Factor α (αAB) and Rate factor α
estimated by Maximum Likelihood (αML)
Our program supports two methods to estimate a rate factor for each site: Alignment-Based rate factor α (αAB) and
Maximum Likelihood-estimated rate factor α (αML).

The estimation of αAB is empirical and based on the observation that the substitution rate at a site is correlated with
the conservation of the site, which, in turn, is correlated
with the average transition probability among the amino
acids at that site. Conserved sites are dominated by highly
similar amino acids and thus have high average transition
probabilities among the amino acids. The algorithm to
calculate αAB is as follows:
1. Set t equal to 1.0 and use equation (6) to calculate a
transition probability matrix P for 20 amino acids.
’
’
Equation, Pij = Pji = (Pij + Pji )/ 2 , is used to compute a

symmetric matrix P'.
2. Calculate the average transition probability for each site
’
and take the reciprocal: Ci = N p / ∑ Pjk , where N p is
(i )

(i )

j≠k

the number of non-gapped amino acid pairs in site i and
the denominator is the sum over the transition probabilities between all amino acid pairs (j,k) at a site i.
3. For invariant sites, Ci is set to 0 to make it consistent
with the Maximum Likelihood estimation.
4. Equation (11) is used to calculate αAB, so that equation
(10) holds.

αi = K *

Ci
∑ Ci

(11)

i

If an evolutionary tree is assumed for the alignment, we
can estimate the αML factors by maximizing the likelihood
(equation (8)) for each site:

dLi
= 0
dα i

(12)

If some sites are highly variable, the αML at those sites can
be very large, as has been previously noticed [18]. We
consider these rate factors to be outliers. For these sites, we
have observed that likelihood changes very little over a
wide range of the α values. An empirical method is used
to reduce the values of αML outliers, guided by the αAB values. a Z-score of the ratio of αML to αAB is calculated for
each site except invariant sites:

αi =

ˆ
Here, α i is the ratio of α ML to α AB for site i; K is the
number of sites excluding the invariant sites. If Zi is greater
i
than 3, it is reduced to 3 by decreasing the value of α ML .
We repeat this procedure until no Zi for any site i is greater
i
than 3. After removing the outliers, we scale the α ML values so that equation (10) holds.

Amino acid frequency vector π optimization
Two methods are implemented to estimate the equilibrium frequency vector π, one derived directly from the
given alignment (Alignment-Based π or πAB) and the other
estimated by Maximum Likelihood (πML). The likelihood
for the entire alignment is a function of π with 19 variables. A continuous minimization method by simulated
annealing [40] is used to optimize π, with the objective
function being the logarithm likelihood of the alignment.
The simulated annealing is computationally intensive and
is the major reason for the long CPU time given in Table 2.
Distance matrix calculation and tree inference
A Maximum Likelihood approach is used to estimate the
evolutionary distances among sequences, either considering rate variation across sites or not. The logarithm likelihood for replacing one protein sequence (A) with another
protein sequence (B) after an evolutionary distance d can
be written as:

(

ln L = ∑ ln π A j ⋅ PA j B j ( α j ⋅ d)
j

)

(15)

Here, π A j is the equilibrium frequency for the amino acid

(

)

at site j in sequence A. PA j B j α j ⋅ d is the transition
probability from amino acid at site j in sequence A to
amino acid at site j in sequence B after an evolutionary
distance α j·d. αj is 1 if all sites are assumed to evolve at
the same rate; otherwise the αAB at site j is used for αj.
An estimate of the evolutionary distance between two
sequences is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function of equation (15):

(16)

Equation (16) can be solved by the bisection root-finding
method [40].
After the distance matrix is calculated, the "Weighbor"
method, i.e. weighted neighbor joining, is used to infer an
evolutionary tree [10].
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
Two methods are implemented to reconstruct ancestral
sequences. One is a marginal reconstruction method [4],
and the other is a joint reconstruction method [5]. Below
are their brief descriptions.
The marginal reconstruction method [4]
We calculate P(Ar|{Al}T), which is the conditional probability of amino acid Ar at the root, given leaf node amino
acid set {Al} and a tree T. Since time reversibility is
assumed, any internal node can serve as a root. Using
Bayes' theorem, we have:

P( Ar | { Al } , T ) =

P ( { Al } | Ar , T ) P ( Ar
P ( { Al } | T )

)

(17)

Here, P(Ar) is used here instead of P(Ar|T) because the frequency of the root amino acid Ar, i.e. πr, does not depend
on tree T. P({Al}|ArT) is the conditional probability of the
known amino acids at the leaf nodes, given T and Ar.
P({Al}|T) does not depend on Ar, so it is calculated as a
normalization constant for P(Ar|{Al},T) terms over all 20
possible values of Ar to make the sum equal to 1.
For Figure 10, P({Al}|ArT) can be expanded as:
P ( AC , AD , AE , AF | AA , T ) =
∑ PAA AB (dAB )PAB AC (dBC )PAB AD (dBD )PAA AE (dAE )PAA AF (dAF )

(18)

AB

Here, PAA AB ( dAB ) is the transition probability from
amino acid at node A to amino acid at node B after an evolutionary distance dAB. Equation (18) can be calculated
using a recursive method suggested by Felsenstein [8].
If rate factors are used in the reconstruction of the root
sequence, we have:
P ( AC , AD , AE , AF | AA , T )i =

∑ PA
AB

A AB

(α i dAB )PAB AC (α i dBC )PAB AD (α i dBD )PAA AE (α i dAE )PAA AF (α i dAF )

(19)

Here, αi could be either αAB or αML at site i. P(AC,AD,AE,AF
| AA,T)i is the conditional probability P(AC,AD,AE,AF |
AA,T) at site i.
The joint reconstruction method [5]
The objective of a joint reconstruction method is to find
the combination of amino acids for an internal node set
{Ai} that maximize the conditional probability of this
amino acid combination, given the leaf node amino acid
set {Al} and a tree T, P({Ai}|{Al},T). Using the Bayes' theorem, we have:
P ( { Ai } | { Al } , T ) =

P ( { Al } | { Ai } , T ) * P ( { Ai } )
P ( { Al } | T )

(20)

Because P({Al}|T) is the same for all amino acid combination at internal node set {Ai} this problem becomes finding the maximum of P({Al}|{Ai},T) *P({Ai}).
The details of a fast algorithm to solve equation (20) can
be found in Pupko et al. [5]. We also incorporated sitespecific rate factors in this algorithm, in a similar way as
equation (19)
Gaps
Due to difficulties with the probabilistic models of gaps, a
simplified empirical approach is used to alleviate the
problem. We assume that gaps are "supersede" letters.
Gaps are considered for each site independently. If a leaf
node has a gap instead of an amino acid at a site, this node
will be deleted from the tree for this site. After dealing
with leaves, we check all internal nodes for children. If an
internal node has no children or only one child due to the
leaf removal because of gaps, it will be removed from the
tree and a gap will be assumed as its reconstructed state.
Simulations of evolutionary process
Two methods of simulating amino acid substitution process were used to test the reliability of reconstruction, rate
factors and evolutionary distance estimation. The first
simulation method was based on a homogeneous time
reversible Markov model. The parameters from Whelan
and Goldman [39] were chosen for our model, including
the equilibrium frequency vector π and the S matrix.
Given the length of a branch from a parent node to one of
its child nodes and the amino acid for the parent node, we
simulated the substitution process to generate an amino
acid for the child node based on the transition probabilities that were calculated using equation (6). For the
arbitrarily selected tree shown in Figure 2, we first generated a random sequence of 100 amino acids as the root
sequence based on the amino acid frequencies from Whelan and Goldman [39]. We then simulated the random
substitution process to obtain all leaf node sequences.
This simulation was repeated 100 times. The resulting 100

Page 19 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:33

alignments were used to test the reliability of the reconstruction result. In this simulation, each site evolved independently according to the same tree topology and branch
lengths, thus there was no rate heterogeneity across sites.
The second simulation method, based on a Z-score
model, introduced rate variation across sites by using
structural and functional information for a specific protein family [21]. We selected three protein families for the
Z-score simulations under structural and functional constraints: pdz domain (Protein DataBank (PDB) ID: 1g9o)
[41], trypsin (PDB ID: 1sgt) [42] and carboxypeptidase A
(PDB ID: 2ctb) [43]. Given a rooted tree, the native
sequence with known structure was used as the root
sequence. Simulations were made along the tree to
generate sequences at any internal node or leaf node. If
the evolutionary distance from a parent node to a child
node was d, the child sequence was obtained after l*d
accepted substitutions starting from the parent sequence,
where l is protein sequence length. Simulations of the substitution process were repeated 100 times. For each site,
the number of accepted substitutions was recorded and
averaged over 100 simulations. Rate factors (observed α),
representing site mutability, were calculated from these
average substitution numbers, such that the average of
rate factors is 1 (equation (10)). 100 simulated alignments were used to test the rate factor estimators (αAB and
αML), distance calculation methods and ancestral
sequence reconstruction.
Homology detection
Testing dataset
38 OB (Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold
[34] proteins with known structures were selected for
homology detection test. OB-fold has a 5-stranded β-barrel structure. In the SCOP (Structure Classification of
Proteins) database (version 1.55) [44], there are 7 OBfold superfamilies. The superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins is the most populated. Diversity of many OBfold homologs extends beyond detection by automatic
PSI-BLAST searches. Multiple sequence alignments of
native sequences were obtained from PSI-BLAST searches
starting from the 38 OB-fold sequences with known
structures. We also selected 10 alignments (adenylyl
kinase, gef, globin, pdz, ph, ptb, ras, sh2, sh3 and subtilase) from the Pfam database (version 7.3) [29] for
homology detection test.
Four different methods
For each alignment with N sequences, ancestral sequences
for the N-1 internal nodes were reconstructed. The idea is
to test whether adding more sequences to a native alignment can help homology detection. Four types of combined alignments were generated, adding different sets of
N-1 sequences to the native alignment. In the first case,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/33

the added sequence at each internal node consisted of
amino acids with the largest probability at each position.
In the second case, the added sequences were made up of
amino acids with the second largest probability. In the
third case, we shuffled the native alignment at each position while keeping the gap pattern as in the native alignment. After shuffling, we added N-1 sequences resulted
from the shuffling to the native alignment. In the fourth
case, N-1 random sequences were generated with the overall amino acid frequencies of the native alignment. These
four methods are named "BEST", "SECOND BEST",
"SHUFFLE" and "RANDOM", respectively.
Prediction of functional sites
Our objective is to find sites that are well conserved within
each sub-tree, but show high variability between different
sub-trees. These sites are likely to contribute to functional
specificity [26,45,46].
Sequence datasets
Multiple sequence alignments of ten protein families were
chosen from the Pfam database (version 7.3) [29]. These
families are: adenylyl kinase (adkinase) (representing
structure PDB ID: 1aky; its ligand or substrate: AP5) [47],
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (gef) (1bkd; H-Ras)
[48], globin (1a6g; HEM) [49], pdz domain (1be9; C-terminal peptide of protein CRIPT) [50], ph domain (1mai;
I3P) [51], ptb domain (1shc; PTR) [52], ras (821p; GTN)
[53], sh2 domain (1a09; ACE) [54], sh3 domain (1nlo;
ACE) [55] and subtilase (1av7; SBL) [56]. Most of these
alignments contain many sequences. We pruned and clustered the sequences in each alignment according to the
length and diversity. Representative sequences were kept
and used for tree inference and ancestral sequence reconstruction. This procedure was done in three steps: 1)
removing fragments, 2) single-linkage clustering and 3)
complete-linkage clustering, as described below.

1. For each family, there is a template sequence with
known structure. The sequences, which cover less than
75% of the non-gapped positions in the template
sequence with amino acids, were considered to be fragments and discarded.
2. A sequence identity matrix was calculated for the
remaining sequences. A single linkage clustering was done
to form sequence groups at sequence identity threshold
0.8. For each group, we chose the longest sequence as a
representative, discarding other members. This step
reduced redundancy in the dataset.
3. An average sequence identity was calculated for the
remaining sequences. We used this average identity as a
threshold for complete linkage clustering to form new
sequence groups. Four groups with the largest sequence

distance from the root to all leaf nodes is dr, then the distance between adjacent layers is dr/5 (Figure 11). Each
place of a "cut" between the layers corresponds to a certain ancestral sequence. We term the location of a "cut" as
a "cutting" node. The marginal reconstruction method
was used to reconstruct amino acid probability vectors for
all the cutting nodes (Figure 11). The reconstructed
probability vector of a cutting node reflects the amino acid
usages of the sub-tree under it.
Calculating specificity score for each site
We use {LK} to represent the set of cutting nodes for layer
LK, K = 0,1,5. {L0} is the root and L1 is the closest layer to
the root, etc.

A dissimilarity score between any neighboring cutting
node pair is calculated. The definition of a neighboring
cutting node pair (i, j) (Figure 11) is:

Root

1. i ∈ {LK}

Cutting node at Layer 1

2. j ∈ {LK+1}

Cutting node at Layer 2

3. Node i is an ancestor of node j (all points on the path
from j to root node are ancestors of node j), so that the

numbers were chosen to form our new alignment. Any
group with the same number of sequences as the fourth
group was also included in the new alignment. The purpose of this step is to keep the major sequence subgroups
of a family while leaving out highly divergent sequences
that might be deleterious for tree inference.
Rooting
The "Weighbor" method gives an unrooted tree. For our
purpose of predicting functional sites, we need to find a
point on the tree that serves as the root. We used a leastsquares modification of the midpoint rooting procedure
to define the root [57].
Tree partitioning
The tree was partitioned into sub-trees at several levels and
compared the amino acid usages within each sub-tree and
among the sub-trees. For this partitioning, we "cut" the
tree into a fixed number of equal-distanced layers, using
the midpoint as the root (Figure 11). Several criteria were
tried for selecting the distance between adjacent layers.
Empirically we found that a simple partition of the tree
into 5 layers usually gave the best results. If the average

Comparison with other methods
We compared our method with three other methods for
prediction of functional sites. The first method (Simple
Conservation or SC) is based on sequence conservation.
Highly conserved sites are considered to be functional. For
each family, we sorted the sites by positional conservation
[25] and chose the 10 top-ranking sites as the predictions.
There might be ties for sites. For example, if there were 5
sites tied at the tenth conservation value and only one of
them was within 5Å from the ligand(s), then its
contribution to the total number of "correct predictions"
was 1/5. The second method is the evolutionary trace (ET)
method [26], which partitions a sequence identity dendrogram into sub-trees at varying sequence identity
thresholds. Sites that are invariant within each individual
sub-tree are picked as functional sites. A higher identity
threshold gives rise to more sub-trees and, since conserved
sites are more frequent in the sub-trees with smaller sizes,
lead to more predicted sites. ET analysis was performed
from a low identity threshold to higher thresholds until
the number of predicted sites was 10 or just above 10 (in
the cases of ties). Ties were resolved similarly to the simple
conservation method. The third method (conservation
difference or CD) is based on the conservation differences
between a native alignment and an alignment derived
from the Z-score sequence design [21]. The basic idea was
to differentiate sites conserved due to structural stability
and sites conserved due to function. Since the pairwise
potential in the Z-score design tends to weaken the conservation caused by function, functionally conserved sites
tend to have a large conservation difference between the
native alignment and the alignment of designed
sequences. We chose 10 top ranking sites sorted by conservation difference as predictions by CD.
