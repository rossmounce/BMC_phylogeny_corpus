Abstract
Background: Carbohydrates are a primary source of carbon and energy for many bacteria. Accurate projection of
known carbohydrate catabolic pathways across diverse bacteria with complete genomes constitutes a substantial
challenge due to frequent variations in components of these pathways. To address a practically and fundamentally
important challenge of reconstruction of carbohydrate utilization machinery in any microorganism directly from its
genomic sequence, we combined a subsystems-based comparative genomic approach with experimental
validation of selected bioinformatic predictions by a combination of biochemical, genetic and physiological
experiments.
Results: We applied this integrated approach to systematically map carbohydrate utilization pathways in
19 genomes from the Shewanella genus. The obtained genomic encyclopedia of sugar utilization includes
~170 protein families (mostly metabolic enzymes, transporters and transcriptional regulators) spanning 17 distinct
pathways with a mosaic distribution across Shewanella species providing insights into their ecophysiology and
adaptive evolution. Phenotypic assays revealed a remarkable consistency between predicted and observed
phenotype, an ability to utilize an individual sugar as a sole source of carbon and energy, over the entire matrix of
tested strains and sugars.
Comparison of the reconstructed catabolic pathways with E. coli identified multiple differences that are manifested
at various levels, from the presence or absence of certain sugar catabolic pathways, nonorthologous gene replacements and alternative biochemical routes to a different organization of transcription regulatory networks.
Conclusions: The reconstructed sugar catabolome in Shewanella spp includes 62 novel isofunctional families of
enzymes, transporters, and regulators. In addition to improving our knowledge of genomics and functional
organization of carbohydrate utilization in Shewanella, this study led to a substantial expansion of our current
version of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Carbohydrate Utilization. A systematic and iterative application of this
approach to multiple taxonomic groups of bacteria will further enhance it, creating a knowledge base adequate for
the efficient analysis of any newly sequenced genome as well as of the emerging metagenomic data.

Background
Carbohydrates comprise a key natural source of carbon
and energy for a variety of heterotrophic microbes. The
diversity of carbohydrates (polymers, oligo- and monosaccharides) in various ecosystems as well as the diversity of microbial lifestyles is reflected in substantial variations of sugar catabolic machinery even between

phylogenetically closely-related microorganisms. An ability to confidently reconstruct this machinery directly
from genomic sequence is crucial to an understanding
of microbial ecophysiology, evolution, adaptation, and
even interactions between microorganisms and their
animal, insect, or plant hosts. However, despite many
studies, the bulk of our knowledge about sugar utilization pathways is limited to a handful of model bacteria
such as E. coli. An accurate projection of this knowledge
across the growing variety of divergent bacteria with
completely sequenced genomes constitutes a substantial

challenge. This is largely due to the aforementioned variations including numerous cases of non-orthologous
gene replacements, families of paralogous proteins with
varying substrate specificity as well as alternative and
presently unknown biochemical routes. Due to this
complexity, genomic annotations of carbohydrate utilization genes derived solely from sequence similarity
analysis are often imprecise and incomplete, especially
for relatively distant and poorly studied bacteria.
Shewanellaceae are a versatile family of Gram-negative
g-proteobacteria that have adapted for survival in highly
varied aquatic and sedimentary environments that exhibit
extremes in salinity, temperature, redox chemistry, and
hydrostatic pressure [1]. Although Shewanella can
respire with a diverse array of electron acceptors that
include organic compounds and metal oxides [2], they
were thought to possess a relatively narrow capacity for
utilizing electron donors, preferring simple carbon compounds such as formate, lactate, and acetate. The recent
results from comparative and functional genomic analysis
[3], physiological experiments [4] and microarray analysis
[5] demonstrated that S. oneidensis MR-1 can use a wide
array of complex carbon compounds including nucleotides, amino acids, mono- and polysaccharides.
A subsystems-based approach to genome analysis
allows us to substantially improve the accuracy of
genomic annotations and to predict functions of previously unknown gene families [6,7]. This approach
includes a combination of comparative genomic techniques such as the analysis of conserved operons and
regulons, with pathway reconstruction across a large
variety of genomes. Recently, we used a subsystemsbased approach to predict and experimentally verify
novel pathways of N-acetylglucosamine and lactate
utilization in Shewanella [8,9]. In the current study we
have expanded this analysis towards genomic reconstruction of the entire repertoire of carbohydrate utilization pathways in a group of 19 species from the
genus Shewanella with completely sequenced
genomes.

Results
Reconstruction of carbohydrate utilization machinery in
Shewanella spp

To address the challenge of genomic reconstruction of
the carbohydrate utilization machinery we took advantage of several features characteristic of many sugar utilization pathways, such as:
Uniform functional organization

A typical sugar utilization pathway includes a transport
system for sugar uptake and a set of intracellular
enzymes that perform biochemical transformations.
Although the latter processes vary from sugar to sugar
(and, to a degree, from organism to organism), most of

Page 2 of 19

them are performed by a rather narrow spectrum of
enzymatic activities such as kinases, isomerases, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, and aldolases. Sugar kinases or
phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systems
(PTS) catalyze an essential phosphorylation step (as all
intermediates of central carbon pathways to the point of
pyruvate are anchored by one or two phosphates). We
also included in this analysis associated transcriptional
regulators of sugar utilization pathways that mediate
specific induction of a catabolic pathway. For utilization
of various natural polysaccharides, many pathways are
equipped by upstream hydrolytic enzymes producing
oligo-, di- or mono-saccharides that are then transported into the cell and further metabolized. These and
other upstream and auxiliary (e.g. involved in sensing
and chemotaxis) components of the carbohydrate utilization machinery were typically excluded from our analysis, except for those that share genomic context with
other sugar utilization components.
Ubiquitousprotein families

Despite their functional diversity, many characterized
components of sugar utilization pathways occur in a
limited number of protein families containing multiple
paralogs with varying substrate specificities. Representatives of these families can be recognized by homologybased genomic searches, thus providing a source of gene
candidates for pathway reconstruction. On the other
hand, homology-based methods, taken alone, often fail
to reliably identify the exact substrate specificity. This
can be accomplished by additional reasoning based on
the analysis of functional and genomic context (functional coupling) [10].
Strong functional coupling

Bacterial genes involved in sugar catabolism are often
organized in compact operons and/or regulated by committed transcription factors. Therefore, genome context
analysis techniques [6] based on the identification of
conserved chromosomal clusters (operons) and shared
regulatory sites (regulons) are particularly efficient for
accurate functional assignment of previously uncharacterized genes of sugar utilization pathways.
Based on the above considerations we developed the
bioinformatic workflow that was applied for the analysis
of 19 complete Shewanella genomes (Fig. 1). The key
starting point of this workflow was a collection of
manually curated subsystems in the SEED genomic
database [7] capturing a substantial fraction of known
sugar utilization pathways projected across many bacterial species. A compilation of ~480 groups of isofunctional homologs from this collection (see additional data
file 1) was used as a source of queries for homologybased scanning of 19 Shewanella genomes integrated in
the SEED database. The underlying assumption was that
any sugar utilization pathway, even extremely divergent

or fully unknown, should contain at least one protein
recognizably homologous to some of the query
sequences from this collection. Therefore, all of the
revealed homologs would be considered potential

Page 3 of 19

âkernelsâ of sugar utilization pathways, even though a
specific function of some of them might be unclear (and
distinct from the query). During further analysis many
of the initially identified gene candidates whose functional roles were deemed unrelated to sugar utilization
(e.g. involved in biosynthetic pathways) or remained
dubious (lacking any evidence for functional assignment)
were rejected.
By applying this workflow we tentatively defined the
first draft of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Sugar Utilization (or, shortly, sugar catabolome) in 19 Shewanella
spp as comprised of 170 isofunctional protein families
(FIGfams) [11]. The complete list and some statistics of
the analyzed genomes are provided in Table 1. The
detailed results of this analysis are captured in the SEED
subsystem âSugar catabolome in Shewanella speciesâ
available online http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/subsys.
cgi and summarized in additional files 2 and 3. Functional annotation of the identified protein families was
conducted using simultaneous genome context analyses,
and homology searches combined with the metabolic
reconstruction and identification of missing steps in the
putative catabolic pathway.
Specific functional assignments have been proposed for
157 FIGfams comprising 17 peripheral sugar utilization
pathways and the key components of the central carbon
metabolism (CCM) pathways (Table 2, Fig. 2). A total of
21 FIGfams involved in CCM upstream of pyruvate are
conserved in all analyzed Shewanella spp. They comprise
complete canonical pentose phosphate (PP) and EntnerDoudoroff (ED) pathways. However, an essential enzyme
of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructokinase (Pfk), is missing in
all of these species suggesting that sugar utilization in
Shewanella can proceed only through the ED or PP pathways. This is in agreement with previous metabolic
reconstruction reports [1,3] and biochemical studies of
CCM enzymes in cell extracts of certain Shewanella
strains [12]. All other canonical enzymes of glycolysis/
gluconeogenesis are present in all analyzed Shewanella
genomes pointing to the presence of intact gluconeogenetic route. The peripheral pathways are comprised of
136 FIGfams showing a mosaic distribution among 19
compared species. The total number of proteins that
comprise the peripheral sugar utilization machinery of
individual species varies broadly, from 18 proteins comprising 3 pathways in S. sediminis up to 74 proteins comprising 10 pathways in S. baltica OS223.
13 FIGfams have not been assigned a specific function
in any sugar utilization pathway due to the lack of any
suggestive genomic context (see additional data files 2
and 3). Among them there are three genes encoding
putative sugar kinases of unknown specificity, and genes
from a hypothetical sugar utilization gene cluster (for
more details see additional data file 4).

Figure 2 Reconstructed pathways of carbohydrate utilization in Shewanella pan-genome. Abbreviations for carbohydrates are listed in
Table 2. Functional roles implicated in the same catabolic pathway are shown by matching background colors. Novel functional roles predicted
in this work are in red boxes. Enzymatic and transport routes are shown by solid and dotted lines, respectively. Transcriptional factors predicted
to control sugar utilization pathways are shown in ovals of matching colors. Reactions and enzymes of the central carbohydrate metabolism are
shown in magenta. Note that none of the individual Shewanella species contain all (or even most) of the shown pathways.

Using the genome context analysis combined with
metabolic reconstruction we inferred specific functional
assignments for 62 families of isofunctional homologs
whose functions were previously unknown or defined
only at the level of general class (Table 2, see also additional file 5). The novel functional assignments, including 34 components of transport systems, 11
transcriptional regulators (and corresponding DNA
motifs), 12 metabolic enzymes, and 5 auxiliary proteins,
are supported by the overall internal consistency of the
entire reconstruction where all of the pathways are complete (no gaps or missing genes), and all of the annotated genes are associated with complete pathways (no

genes out of context). Selected functional assignments
mostly for novel sugar transporters from those pathways
that are present in most of the analyzed Shewanella species were tested by targeted biochemical and genetic
experiments (for details see next section and additional
file 6). An ultimate validation of the entire reconstruction was attained by the experimental testing of growth
phenotypes (an ability of a given strain to grow on a
specific sugar substrate as a sole source of carbon and
energy) predicted by the presence or absence of respective reconstructed pathways. The pathway presence was
defined based on the presence of all components of the
pathway in a particular genome. This phenotype

profiling was performed using a âmatrixâ approach
where 14 representative Shewanella species were profiled against a panel of 18 diagnostic sugar substrates
(Table 3).
Peripheral sugar utilization pathways

In this section we describe the key novel aspects of eight
reconstructed sugar utilization pathways that were found
to be relatively widely distributed in Shewanella genus.
The âcoreâ subset includes pathways for utilization of
D-glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, D-glycerate, b-glucosides (present in 14 or more species). The âintermediateâ
subset includes the sucrose, maltodextrins, D-galactose,
and L-arabinose catabolic pathways (conserved in 6 or
more species). We also provide the results of experimental validation of selected novel functional roles in
five sugar catabolic pathways. The details of the other
nine reconstructed pathways for utilization of alginate,
gluconate, mannitol, mannosides, N-acetylgalactosamine,
ribose, sialic acids, trehalose, and xylitol that were found
only in one to four Shewanella strains ("rareâ pathways)
are described in the additional file 4. We also report the
results of growth phenotype characterization for most of
the respective sugar substrates.
D-glucose

(Glc) is utilized by bacteria using either (i) hexose permease and glucokinase, or (ii) PTS Glc system. The
inability to ferment glucose as a carbon source under
aerobic conditions was originally attributed to the Shewanella genus, whereas later studies have identified several species that were able to utilize glucose such as S.
baltica and S. frigidimarina [13-15]. In this study we

have tentatively identified respective genes, glucose
transporters glcPBgl and glcP Mal and glucokinase glkII,
that are conserved in most Shewanella genomes, where
they are clustered on the chromosome with the genes
from b-glucoside (Bgl) and maltodextrin (Mal) utilization pathways, respectively (Fig. 3A). These catabolic
pathways include several secreted glucosidases (e.g.
BglAII, CgA, SusB) generating extracytoplasmic glucose
that can be utilized via associated glucose transporters
and the glucokinase (see below). The predicted glucose
transporters belong to the glucose-galactose permease
(GGP) family, and are most similar to the glucose and
galactose transporter GluP from Brucella abortus [16]
and fucose permease FucP from E. coli. The predicted
glucokinase GlkII belongs to the ROK family of sugar
kinases [17], and is similar to fructokinase Mak, D-allose
kinase AlsK, and N-acetylglucosamine kinase NagK from
E. coli, and glucokinase GlcK from B. subtilis. Orthologs
of both glcPMal/glcPBgl and glkII are absent from E. coli
and other Enterobacteria. The GlcP Bgl and GlcP Mal
transporters in Shewanella were found only in the context of the Bgl and Mal pathways, whereas GlkII seems
to play a general housekeeping role being conserved in
all analyzed Shewanella genomes (see additional data
files 2 and 3). In 9 of 19 genomes glkII was also found
within the Bgl utilization gene cluster, and in 6 of these
cases it is a second copy of the gene in the genome.
To confirm the functional assignment of GlcP, we
constructed the ÎglcP Mal knockout mutant in Shewanella sp. ANA-3, and tested it for glucose-dependent
growth. In contrast to the wild-type ANA-3, the
ÎglcPMal strain was unable to grow on D-glucose as a

utilization phenotype. The ability of Shewanella species to grow on a panel of sugar substrates was predicted based on the presence (+) or absence (-) of the
respective reconstructed pathways in their genomes. The experimental results of growth experiments from this study (see additional data files 7 and 8) are: âpâ,
positive growth; âwâ, weak growth; ânâ, no growth. Inconsistencies between the predicted and experimentally determined growth phenotypes are in bold and

sole carbon and energy source, confirming the glucose
transporter functional assignment (see additional data
file 6 for original experimental data). A representative of
the predicted glucokinase subfamily (GlkII) from S. baltica OS155 was experimentally characterized as a part
of our analysis of the Bgl pathway (see below). To assess
the functionality of the predicted glucose catabolic pathway we performed phenotypic characterization of Shewanella for growth on D-glucose as a sole carbon and
energy source (see additional data files 7 and 8 for the
original physiological growth data). Among 14 Shewanella strains tested only S. oneidensis and two S. putrefaciens strains were unable to grow on glucose. These
results are consistent with the distribution of glcP transporters in these Shewanella genomes (Table 3, see also
additional file 2). The inability of S. oneidensis MR-1 to
grow on glucose is most likely due to a frameshift in the
glcPMal gene[18].
The second (PTS-driven) route of glucose utilization is
not expected to support the growth of bacteria (such as
Shewanella spp) with the incomplete glycolytic pathway
due to the inability of the ED or PP pathways to generate enough phosphoenolpyruvate to compensate for its
consumption in the phosphotransferase reaction. This
assertion is supported by the observed impaired growth
of the E. coli pfk mutant on glucose using PTSGlc [19].
Therefore, the actual physiological role of Shewanella
genes orthologous to the components of the E. coli
PTSGlc system (ptsHI-crr and ptsG) remains a mystery.
It would be tempting to speculate that this PTS system
is used by Shewanella for glucose consumption in the
presence of other substrates contributing to nonglycolytic phosphoenolpyruvate generation. However, our
attempts to grow MR-1 on the mixture of lactate and
glucose did not confirm this conjecture (data not
shown).
N-acetylglucosamine

(Nag) and chitin catabolic pathway (Fig. 2, see also
additional file 9) conserved in most Shewanella spp
contains several novel functional roles (Table 2). Previously we have experimentally confirmed the predicted
enzymatic activities of novel Nag kinase (NagK) and
glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB II ) and
reconstituted the entire three-step biochemical conversion of Nag to fructose-6-phosphate in vitro [9]. We
have also confirmed that all of the tested Shewanella
strains can grow on Nag as a single source of carbon
and energy with the exception of S. frigidimarina,
which does not contain these genes (Table 3). Here we
present additional experimental results supporting functional assignments of the predicted transporter NagP in
S. oneidensis MR-1. NagP belongs to the GGP family of
transporters and has a limited similarity to the glucose
permeases GlcP Bgl and GlcPMal. We have constructed

Page 8 of 19

the S. oneidensis ÎnagP targeted deletion mutant and
demonstrated the loss of its ability to grow on Nag (see
additional data file 6).
The Nag catabolic genes shows their wide distribution
in the Alteromonadales lineage, suggesting the presence
of the Nag pathway in the common ancestor of this
lineage. The absence of Nag pathway in S. frigidimarina
is attributed to a loss of the entire chromosomal gene
cluster. The observed wide distribution of Nag utilization pathway in Shewanella could be related to their
ability to utilize chitin, a highly abundant constituent of
aquatic invertebral exoskeleton.
D-glycerate

(Grt) utilization pathway in Shewanella species involves
D-glycerate kinase GarK, transcriptional regulator SdaR,
and a novel D-glycerate permease termed here GrtP
(Fig. 2, see also additional file 9). In E. coli, GarK is
involved in the glucarate/galactarate catabolic pathway,
generating 2-phosphoglycerate as product, and SdaR is a
common transcriptional regulator of this pathway [20].
Most of the glucarate/galactarate utilization genes are
absent in Shewanella species. The only exception is a
garK gene ortholog, which was found in 17 Shewanella
strains in a conserved operon with a hypothetical gene
encoding the predicted D-glycerate transporter GrtP
(see additional data files 2 and 3). The grtP-garK operon
is clustered on the chromosome with an sdaR gene
ortholog. A comparative genomic reconstruction of the
SdaR regulon in g-proteobacteria allowed us to predict a
candidate SdaR-binding site located upstream of the
grtP-garK operon in Shewanella genomes (Fig. 3A).
The predicted D-glycerate uptake transporter GrtP
belongs to the gluconate permease family and has orthologs in Pseudomonadales and Vibrionales but not in
E. coli or other Enterobacteria. The predicted function
of GrtP was confirmed by the loss of ability of the
S. oneidensis ÎgrtP strain to grow on D-glycerate as a
sole carbon and energy source (see additional data file
6). Of the 14 Shewanella strains, all but 2 (S. denitrificans and S. amazonensis) could grow on D-glycerate
(see additional data files 7 and 8), which is fully consistent with the distribution of the grtP-garK operon
among the analyzed Shewanella genomes (Table 3). The
natural source of D-glycerate in aquatic environments is
yet to be elucidated.
b-glucoside

âBglâ utilization pathway revealed in 9 Shewanella species
involves b-glucanase LamA, two b-glucosidases BglA I
and BglAII, two novel b-glucoside transporters BglT and
OmpBgl, a novel LacI-type transcriptional regulator BglR,
glucose permease GlcP Bgl and ROK-type glucokinase
GlkII (Fig. 2, see additional data files 2, 3 and 9). The previously described Bgl catabolic pathways use PTS-type
transport systems and 6-phospho-b-glucosidases (as in

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

B. subtilis and E. coli) or ABC-type transport systems and
b-glucosidases (as in Streptomyces spp and Archaea) [21].
The predicted b-glucoside uptake transporter BglT is a
member of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide (GPH)
transporter family, and has orthologs in other Alteromonadales species. Homologs of BglT in Enterobacteria (e.g.
YicJ and YagG from E. coli that show 40-44% sequence
similarity to BglT) are predicted xyloside transporters
regulated by the xylose activator XylR [22]. Omp Bgl
belongs to the TonB-dependent outer membrane transporter (TBDT) family, which includes proteins involved
in high-affinity binding and energy-dependent uptake of
various substrates (including oligosaccharides) into the
periplasm [23]. The predicted Bgl-specific transporter
OmpBgl is a nonorthologous replacement of the Bgl-specific outer membrane porin BglH from E. coli. Comparative genomic reconstruction of the BglR regulon allowed
us to predict candidate BglR-binding sites located
upstream of the divergently transcribed bglAI-bglT-bglR
and glcP Bgl -bglA II operons, and upstream of the ompBgl
gene (Fig. 3A). Thus the predicted novel transporters are
positionally clustered and co-regulated with other Bgl
catabolic genes.
The reconstructed Bgl pathway in Shewanella involves
three glucosidases, two of which, LamA and BglAII, are
predicted to be secreted outside of the cell and to the
periplasm, respectively, whereas BglA I is likely a
cytoplasmic enzyme. We propose that b-glucoside-containing glucans are first degraded by extracellular endob-1,3-glucanase LamA, the resulting oligo-b-glucosides
are transported to the periplasm by OmpBgl, and subsequently utilized by BglA II to produce D-glucose and
shorter b-glucosides (e.g., cellobiose, gentibiose). The
latter products are taken up by the predicted BglT
transporter into the cytoplasm where they are finally
hydrolyzed by the BglAI enzyme. D-glucose is taken up
by the predicted glucose transporter GlcPBgl and phosphorylated by the GlkII glucokinase (Fig. 2).
The newly predicted b-glucoside BglT transporter was
experimentally confirmed by genetic complementation
in E. coli ÎbglF mutant (a knockout of cellobiose PTS
system). This strain, when transformed by an expression
vector containing an operon bglAI- bglT cloned from S.
baltica OS155 gained the ability to grow on minimal
medium with cellobiose as the sole carbon and energy
source. In the same conditions, no growth was observed
for this strain transformed by vector only or by the plasmids containing single genes, bglAI or bglT (see additional data file 6).
The predicted glucokinase activity of the S. baltica
OS155 glkII gene product was confirmed by an in vitro
enzyme assay. Recombinant purified GlkII exhibited a
broad substrate specificity at 37Â°C with the highest
activity with D-glucose (22 Î¼mol/mg/min), and an

Page 9 of 19

appreciable activity with some other tested hexoses
including D-mannose, D-fructose, D-glucosamine, and
D-mannosamine (see additional data file 6).
The results of the phenotype profiling of 14 Shewanella strains showed that only half of them (four S. baltica species, S. amazonensis, S. frigidimarina, and
S. denitrificans) were able to grow on cellobiose as a
sole carbon and energy source (see additional data files
7 and 3). This result is consistent with the distribution
of the respective genes in the analyzed Shewanella genomes (Table 3).
The Bgl catabolic genes are sparsely distributed among
Shewanella species (Fig. 4) and many other species from
the Alteromonadales lineage. Therefore, it might be an
ancestral pathway predating the speciation of Alteromonadales that could have been independently lost several
times within the Shewanella genus. The species-specific
loss of Bgl pathway by many Shewanella could be linked
to a particular ecophysiology of their habitat. For example, S. pealeana which colonizes the accessory nidamental gland of the squid may not have access to Bgl
substrate and thus lost the respective gene cluster from
its chromosome [15].
Sucrose

(Scr) utilization pathway in 8 Shewanella species
involves sucrose phosphorylase ScrP, fructokinase ScrK,
two novel sucrose transporters (ScrTII and OmpScr), and
a novel LacI-type transcriptional regulator ScrRII (Fig. 2;
see also see additional data files 2, 3 and 9). This pathway variant is quite different from the canonical pathway known in Enterobacteria, which includes the
sucrose-specific PTS-driven uptake and phosphorylation
followed by sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase [24]. An
alternative variant of the Scr pathway previously
described in Bifidobacterium spp includes sucrose permease ScrT from the MelB melibiose transporter family
and sucrose phosphorylase [25]. The major disctinction
in Shewanella is a nonorthologous replacement of ScrT
by a predicted transporter ScrTII of the GGP family of
sugar transporters. The novel sucrose regulator ScrRII in
Shewanella is another nonorthologous replacement of
the previously characterized ScrR repressor from other
bacteria. A genomic reconstruction of the ScrRII regulon
allowed us to predict its candidate binding sites
upstream of the divergently transcribed scrP and scrTII
genes, as well as upstream of the omp Scr -scrK operon
(Fig. 3A). The predicted Scr-specific TBDT OmpScr is
functionally equivalent to the Scr-specific outer membrane porin ScrY from Enterobacteria, and is presumably involved in the uptake of sucrose into the
periplasm[26].
The ScrTII transporter was validated by complementation in E. coli K-12, which lacks the Scr pathway and is
unable to utilize sucrose (see additional data file 6). Two

Figure 4 Distribution of 17 sugar utilization pathways encoded in 19 Shewanella genomes. Shewanella species abbreviations are as
described in Table 1. Asterisks indicate cases when a pathway is impaired by the presence of an insertion sequence element or a frameshift
mutation and, thus, deemed nonfunctional.

divergently transcribed genes from S. frigidimarina,
scrTII and scrP, were expressed in E. coli under the control of an endogenous promoter in their common intergenic region. As a negative control, we used an empty
vector as well as single scrTII or scrP genes expressed in
the same strain. The cell growth was monitored in a
minimal medium with sucrose as the only carbon and
energy source. We have found that only the cells carrying both scrTII and scrP were able to grow on sucrose
providing an experimental verification of the reconstructed Scr utilization pathway.
The growth phenotype profiling of 14 Shewanella species demonstrated that eight of them (Shewanella sp.
ANA-3, MR-4, MR-7, four S. baltica strains, S. frigidimarina) are able to grow on sucrose (see additional data
files 7 and 8). These results are in agreement with the
presence of the respective genes in these 8 Shewanella
genomes (Table 3).
The Scr catabolic genes are present in a large group of
Shewanella species (Fig. 4) and in some other species
from the Alteromonadales lineage. The most parsimonious scenario suggests that the Scr pathway was present in a common ancestor of the Shewanella genus and

that it has been independently lost several times in the
evolutionary history of Shewanella. Distribution of the
Scr pathway among the Shewanella species provides
another possible link to their ecophysiology, the availability of plant-derived sucrose in their respective ecologic niches.
Maltodextrin

(Mal) utilization gene locus identified in 14 Shewanella
species contains the amy, cga, susA, susB, and malZ
genes encoding orthologs of previously characterized
starch and maltodextrin hydrolytic enzymes, as well as
genes encoding novel transporters termed MalT,
GlcPMal and OmpMal, and a novel LacI-type transcriptional regulator MalR (see additional data file 2). The
reconstructed Mal catabolic pathway in Shewanella (Fig.
2) uses a predicted novel sodium:solute symporter MalT
(a homolog of the melibiose permease MelB of E. coli)
instead of the maltose ABC transporter MalEFGK previously described in E. coli [27]. The outer membrane
maltose/maltodextrin uptake in Shewanella is presumably mediated by a novel TBDT OmpMal, the functional
equivalent of E. coli maltoporin LamB[26]. The novel
glucose transporter GlcP Mal is a close paralog (67%

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

identity) of the predicted glucose transporter GlcP Bgl
from the Bgl utilization pathway in Shewanella. We propose that D-glucose is produced in the periplasm by the
action of maltodextrin a-glucosidases and transported
into the cytoplasm by GlcPMal. A comparative genomic
reconstruction of the MalR regulon allowed us to predict candidate MalR-binding sites located upstream of
the divergently transcribed omp Mal and malZ-glcP Mal
operons, as well as upstream of the susB and malT-cga
operons (Fig. 3A).
The growth phenotype characterization of 14 Shewanella species demonstrated that 11 of them (all except
MR-1 and two S. putrefaciens strains) are able to grow
on maltodextrin as a sole carbon and energy source (see
additional data files 7 and 8). These phenotypic results
are in agreement with the genomic reconstruction of
the Mal pathway (Table 3). The inability of S. oneidensis
MR-1 to grow on maltodextrin is attributed to significant genetic perturbations within the Mal utilization
gene loci (e.g. glcP Mal and susA are pseudogenes with
frameshifts, whereas ompMal is interrupted by an insertion element [18]).
The Mal catabolic genes are widely distributed among
Shewanella species (Fig. 4) and several other species
from the Alteromonadales lineage. Such phyletic pattern
suggests the presence of an ancestral pathway in the
common ancestor of the Shewanella genus and independent species-specific pathway losses. Interestingly, while
the Mal pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 demonstrates
genetic signs of decay (see above), two closely related S.
putrefaciens strains have completely lost the Mal pathway genes. The loss of the Mal catabolic genes in some
Shewanella spp. is most likely caused by a significant
shift in available nutrient composition in their habitat,
e.g. the absence of plant materials as a source of
maltodexrins.
L-arabinose

(Ara) and arabinoside utilization gene locus identified in
six Shewanella species contains more than 20 genes.
Nearly half of these genes are similar to previously characterized Ara catabolic genes whereas others are novel
(see additional data files 2 and 9). The reconstructed
Ara catabolic pathway in Shewanella involves the following predicted functional roles: arabinose ABC transporter AraUVWZ, two arabinoside transporters AraT
and OmpAra, a novel GntR-type transcriptional regulator
AraRII, L-arabinose mutarotase AraM, and Ara 1-dehydrogenase AraY (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Two alternative routes of Ara utilization are known in
bacteria. The major one present in E. coli and B. subtilis
depends on L-arabinose isomerase AraA, L-ribulokinase
AraB, and L-ribulose-phosphate epimerase AraD,
whereas the alternative Ara pathway characterized in
Azospirillum brasiliense proceeds through L-arabinose

Page 11 of 19

dehydrogenase, arabinolactonase, and L-arabonate dehydratase [28]. In addition to the araBAD genes encoding
the conventional Ara utilization pathway through Lribulose, the Ara metabolic locus in Shewanella contains
two genes from the alternative Ara pathway, namely Larabonate dehydratase araC and arabinolactonase araL,
although other genes from the alternative pathway are
missing (see additional data file 9). Based on genome
context and distant homology analysis we have
predicted the gene araY, which is similar to D-xylose 1dehydrogenase from Caulobacter crescentus (45%
similarity), to be the missing L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase. A member of aldose 1-epimerase family encoded in
the Ara gene cluster was tentatively assigned the functional role Ara mutarotase (AraM), which interconverts
alpha and beta anomers of L-arabinose.
The predicted ABC-type arabinose uptake transporter
system AraUVWZ is similar to the hypothetical sugar
transporter YtfQRST from E. coli (58% similarity) and to
the ribose transport systems in E. coli and B. subtilis.
The predicted TBDT Omp Ara and the GPH-family
transporter AraT are presumably involved in the uptake
of arabinosides through the outer and inner membrane,
respectively. Comparative genomic reconstruction of the
AraRII regulon allowed us to predict its candidate binding sites located in the likely regulatory regions of most
operons in the ara locus (Fig. 3A). Thus, the predicted
novel transporters are both positionally clustered and
co-regulated with the other Ara catabolic genes (see
additional data files 2 and 3).
The functionality of the predicted arabinose utilization
pathway is supported by the growth phenotype profile
of Shewanella spp on L-arabinose (see additional data
files 7 and 8), which correlates perfectly with the presence/absence of the Ara catabolic genes (Table 3).
The Ara catabolic genes are present in a large group
of Shewanella species (Fig. 4), among which MR-1 and
three S. baltica strains have lost the complete ara gene
cluster. Outside of the Shewanella genus the most similar ara catabolic gene clusters were found in two other
g-proteobacteria, the polysaccharide-degrading marine
bacterium Saccharophagus degradans and the plant cell
wall-degrading soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus. Arabinose is an important component of plant cell wall.
Therefore, the distribution of the Ara catabolic pathway
among Shewanella species may also reflect differences in
the availability of plant-derived arabinose in their
environments.
D-galactose

(Gal) metabolism genes encoding galactokinase GalK,
mutarotase GalM, UDP-glucose epimerase GalE, and
UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase GalU are
conserved in all Shewanella genomes (see additional
data file 2). Utilization of extracellular galactose or

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

galactosides requires specific transport systems and
sugar hydrolases. The galKM locus in S. halifaxensis, S.
loihica, S. pealeana, S. piezotolerans, and S. sediminis
involves two additional genes, galPII and lacZ, that are
presumably involved in galactose and lactose catabolism.
The predicted galactose permease GalPII belongs to the
SSF superfamily and is similar to the myo-inositol and
glucose transporters from mammals (34% identity). The
b-galactosidase LacZ has a candidate signal peptide cleavage site and is presumably a secreted enzyme. We propose that b-galactosides are degraded in the periplasm
by LacZ, and the resulting D-galactose residues are
taken up by GalP II transporter (Fig. 2). The omp Gal lacZ-galTK-galPII-galE operon in two S. baltica strains
(OS185 and OS223) encodes an additional novel transporter from TBDT family, named Omp Gal , which is
likely involved in lactose uptake through the outer
membrane.
The galTKPII operon identified in S. woodyi is presumably involved in D-galactose monosaccharide utilization, because of the absence of candidate galactoside
hydrolase genes in this genome. An ortholog of the
transcriptional regulator gene galR from E. coli is clustered with the galTKPII operon in S. woodyi and with
the ompGal-lacZ-galTK-galPII-galE operon in two S. baltica strains, and candidate GalR-binding sites were identified in their corresponding upstream regions (Fig. 3).
The growth phenotype characterization of 14 Shewanella species demonstrated that only three strains (S. loihica PV-4, and two S.batica strains) are able to grow on
D-galactose (see additional data files 7 and 8). This pattern is consistent with the distribution of the predicted
galactose permease gene galPII in the analyzed Shewanella genomes (Table 3).
A mosaic distribution of the galP II genes in two
groups of the Shewanella spp., and the presence of
their orthologs in several other marine bacteria from
the Alteromonadales lineage suggest multiple gene
loss events in the evolutionary history of the Gal catabolic pathway in the Shewanella genus. The Gal utilization genes could have been lost in those Shewanella
species that do not share the same ecological niche
with some of the marine animals that are thought
to provide a natural source of galactose and bgalactosides.
Novel sugar utilization pathway variants in Shewanella

The reconstructed peripheral pathways in Shewanella
spp contain 62 variations distinguishing them from
those previously described in model species, thus providing a vivid illustration of the aforementioned intrinsic
variability of the sugar utilization machinery (see additional data file 5). Most common are numerous cases of
nonorthologous gene replacements (corresponding to

Page 12 of 19

novel FIGfams), when a functional role is encoded by a
gene that is not orthologous (and, in many cases, not
homologous) to any of the previously known genes of
the same function [29]. In our analysis, such deviations
as well as a few cases of alternative biochemical routes
were initially recognized as inconsistencies or gaps
(missing genes) in reconstructed pathways. Such gaps
were filled-in by the most likely gene candidates
revealed by genome context analysis (e.g. those functionally coupled with canonical genes of the respective
pathways via operons and/or regulons). This analysis
also allowed us to extend some of the pathways by adding components that would not be commonly perceived
as genuine gaps, such as transcriptional regulators and
transporters.
Althogh this study is restricted to Shewanella spp.,
most of the newly assigned protein families contain
multiple representatives outside the Shewanella genus,
thus contributing to the reconstruction of respective
pathways in a variety of species. It is worth noting that
the addition of 62 novel FIGfams led to an appreciable
(> 12%) expansion of our original collection of 480
FIGfams associated with sugar utilization subsystems
(Fig. 1). Similar analysis applied to new groups of species may reveal additional FIGfams and their combinations involved in the carbohydrate utilization
machinery, thus iteratively expanding the entire collection. Of no less importance is the fact that nearly all
of the newly assigned genes were originally identified
as distant homologs of previously characterized genes
with distinct but related functions. For example, a
novel Aga kinase was identified as a distant homolog
of other known sugar kinases; the novel D-glycerate
transporter - as a homolog of E. coli D-gluconate permease; the novel BglR repressor - as a homolog of
many sugar-specific regulators from the LacI family.
Although this observation obviously reflects intrinsic
limitations of homology-based predictions, it also delivers a more important message that our knowledge of
protein families involved in the carbohydrate utilization is close to saturation at the level of general class
functions recognized by homology-based methods.
Otherwise, at least some of the gap-filling gene candidates predicted by genome context analysis would have
shared no homology with previously known components from the collection. Not a single example of that
kind was observed in this study. Moreover, not a single
gap has remained in any of the 17 reconstructed sugar
utilization pathways clearly supporting the above
interpretation.
Characteristic features of the Shewanella sugar catabolome contrasted with E. coli and other Enterobacteria
are described below.

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

Carbohydrate uptake

strategies appear to be strikingly different between Shewanella and Enterobacteria. Overall, 34 gene families
encoding novel versions of sugar uptake systems were
identified in Shewanella spp. Most notably, in contrast
to an extensive repertoire of 21 PTS systems actively
used by E. coli for the uptake of various sugars [30],
most Shewanella species contain only one PTS system
of unclear physiological role. As already discussed, the
lack of Pfk genes blocks the conventional glycolytic
route in Shewanella making the ED pathway the only
feasible way of hexose utilization. The inability of the
latter pathway to sustain energy requirements of PTS
systems (due to phosphoenolpyruvate regeneration balance) provides a rationale for their absence in Shewanella spp. Thus, the uptake of Glc, Man, Scr, Tre, Nag,
and Aga in E. coli is mediated by dedicated PTS systems, whereas in Shewanella species these sugars are
transported by predicted novel permeases of the GGP
family, GlcP, ManP, ScrTII, TreT, NagP, AgaPII, respectively. A combination of inner membrane transporters
from the GGP and several other sugar permease families
with committed outer membrane transporters of the
TBDT family appears to be the predominant strategy of
sugar uptake in Shewanella (Fig. 2). Committed TBDT
outer membrane transporters were mapped for 10 of
the 17 reconstructed sugar utilization pathways in Shewanella species based on their occurrence within
respective operons and regulons (Table 2). The predicted Shewanella TBDT transporters are functionally
equivalent to sugar-specific outer membrane porins of
Enterobacteria (e.g. BglH, ScrY, LamB, NanC). However,
in contrast to porins mediating transport across the
outer membrane by passive diffusion, TBDT transporters employ a unique energizing mechanism utilizing
the TonB complex and the proton-motive force of the
cytoplasmic membrane. It is tempting to speculate that
a relative abundance of TBDT transporters in Shewanella and some other environmental Proteobacteria
reflects their rather limited access to carbohydrates as
compared to Enterobacteria.

ROK family. Therefore, a functional repertoire of coregulated genes appears to be generally better conserved
between species than the respective transcription factors
and their DNA binding motifs [31]. Members of the
LacI family are most abundant among the regulators of
sugar catabolism in Shewanella. They control 10 of the
17 reconstructed pathways, whereas the remaining pathways are regulated by the members of GntR and DeoR
families (Fig. 3). The majority of genes from sugar catabolic pathways were identified as candidate members of
respective sugar catabolic regulons in Shewanella genomes (see additional data file 3).
Sugar catabolic enzymes

are far less variable between species than associated
transporters or regulators. In case of Shewanella, the
most notable variations are associated with sugar phosphorylation, which is at least partially due to a functional
replacement
of
the
uptake-coupled
phosphorylation (characterstic of PTS) by a combination
of permease and kinase or, less frequently, phopshorylase (for disaccharides). Thus, in the aforementioned
Nag and Aga pathways, novel sugar kinases NagK and
AgaK combined with respective permeases (NagP and
AgaP) are employed in Shewanella spp rather than
canonical PTS systems. In a novel variant of Scr utilization pathway predicted and experimentally validated in
S. frigidimarina (see additional data file 6), the hydrolysis of sucrose upon ScrT-mediated uptake and phosphorylation of its glucose moiety is performed by the
sucrose phosphorylase (ScrP). This single-enzyme transformation is a functional replacement of two consecutive enzymatic reactions, phosphotransferase by PTS
(ScrA) followed by sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase
(ScrB), in a canonical version of the pathway described
in Enterobacteria [24]. Nonorthologous replacements
appear to be quite common for sugar kinases that are
known to occur in a number of distinct protein families.
For example, the glucokinase Glk II of Shewanella
belongs to the ROK family, whereas its functional counterpart in E. coli and other Enterobacteria belongs to
the bacterial glucokinase family.

Transcriptional regulation

is another highly variable aspect of the sugar utilization
machinery. Indeed, 11 of the 17 transcriptional regulators tentatively associated with Shewanella sugar utilization pathways are nonorthologous to their counterparts
previously characterized in E. coli and other species
(Table 2). Moreover, 9 of these transcription factors
were recruited from structurally unrelated protein
families, and they are predicted to bind to completely
distinct DNA motifs. For example, the transcriptional
repressor NagR of the Nag utilization pathway in Shewanella belongs to the LacI family, whereas a functionally equivalent NagC regulator of E. coli belongs to the

Discussion
Most heterotrophic bacteria are capable of utilizing at
least some carbohydrates as a source of carbon and
energy via a matching repertoire of sugar catabolic pathways. Such pathways that include specialized transporters and intracellular enzymes catalyzing biochemical
transformations of a particular sugar into one of the
common CCM intermediates often form operons controlled by committed transcription factors. Despite our
advanced understanding of sugar catabolic pathways in
a few model bacteria, their genomics-based projection
across a variety of species from other taxonomic groups

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

is quite challenging due to the intrinsic variability of the
carbohydrate utilization machinery. To address this
challenge we have established a subsystems-based comparative genomic approach (Fig. 1), and assessed its utility by building a genomic encyclopedia of carbohydrate
catabolism (sugar catabolome) in the Shewanella genus.
This analysis covered 19 complete genomes of diverse
Shewanella species isolated from various aquatic habitats. The key components of our approach include: (i)
using a collection of protein families capturing the current knowledge of the microbial carbohydrate utilization
machinery for homology scanning of target genomes
and preliminary identification of gene candidates; (ii)
analyzing genomic and functional contexts to recognize
functional equivalents of previously characterized genes
and to predict novel genes and pathway variants; (iii)
validating selected bioinformatic predictions by a combination of biochemical, genetic and physiological
experiments.
One of the critical factors that contributed to the successful outcome of this analysis was the availability of a
large set of completely sequenced genomes (largely due
to the DOE Joint Genome Institute, http://www.jgi.doe.
gov/) representing a substantial phylogenetic, geographic
and ecophysiological diversity within an otherwise compact taxonomic group â Shewanella genus [1]. This was
particularly instrumental for mapping and prediction of
regulons as well as for reliably establishing orthology
relationships within protein families containing multiple
paralogs. In addition to improving our knowledge of
genomics, functional organization and evolution of the
sugar catabolome, this study confirmed the efficiency of
the established approach, which is scalable and applicable to other groups of microorganisms. A systematic
application of this approach to a growing number of
divergent bacterial lineages would allow us to rapidly
expand the current genomic knowledgebase and establish the capability of highly accurate automated annotation and assertion of sugar catabolic pathways in all
bacteria with completely sequenced genomes. Moreover,
a fine-grain functional annotation of all protein families
(including those with multiple branches and paralogs)
that comprise carbohydrate utilization machinery in
complete genomes will enable accurate recognition of
the corresponding functions and pathway variants in
metagenomic samples.
An overall internal consistency of the reconstructed
catabolic machinery confirmed the efficiency of the
bioinformatic workflow used in this study. The current
version of the genomic encyclopedia of carbohydrate
utilization pathways of the Shewanella genus has neither
obvious gaps such as âmissing genesâ (required by functional context but not identified in the genomes), nor
inconsistencies such as âdisconnected genesâ (those that

Page 14 of 19

were functionally assigned but lack any functional context). The only notable exception is an already mentioned putative PTS system whose function remains
obscure despite its high similarity with E. coli glucose
PTS. Additional support of the developed genomic
reconstruction was provided by direct experimental testing of selected bioinformatic predictions using both in
vitro assays of purified recombinant enzymes and in vivo
phenotype assessment of gene knockouts in Shewanella
and genetic complementation in E. coli. Despite the
overall successful outcome and utility of these experiments, the scale of this reconstruction makes a traditional targeted verification of individual conjectures
rather impractical. On the other hand, a predicted pattern of presence/absence of certain sugar utilization
pathways within a representative group of species may
be seamlessly translated to a predicted testable phenotype, the ability/inability of these species to metabolize
respective sugars.
We assessed the panel of 14 Shewanella species for
the aerobic growth on a series of 18 sugars used as a
single source of carbon and energy (see additional data
files 7 and 8). The results of the extended growth profiling in this study revealed a remarkable consistency
between predicted and observed phenotypes for the
entire matrix of tested strains and sugars despite some
strain-to-strain variations in the growth rate and efficiency (Table 3). In addition, the absence of the Dxylose and D-fructose catabolic pathways in the entire
Shewanella group was also confirmed by their inability
to grow on either of these sugars as a carbon and energy
source. The only two observed inconsistencies, the
inability of S. oneidensis to grow on maltodextrin and of
S. frigidimarina to grow on mannitol, can be rationalized by genetic rearrangements. Among the genes in
the mal locus of S. oneidensis disrupted by insertion elements and frameshifts is an already mentioned transporter GlcP Mal . This observation also provided an
explanation of the intrinsic inability of S. oneidensis to
grow on Glc, in contrast to many other Shewanella spp,
including ANA-3, where the role of this transporter in
Glc utilization was experimentally confirmed. It is worth
mentioning that our phenotype predictions are largely
consistent with the results of earlier growth studies published for a limited set of strains and sugar substrates
[13,15,32-35].
Analysis of the distribution of sugar utilization pathways within the Shewanella genus and a comparison with
E. coli and other bacteria with different life-styles and
natural environments yields interesting observations and
conjectures about their adaptive evolution (Fig. 4). A
clear distinction between the core and the rare pathways
reflects an apparent difference in their evolutionary history. As mentioned above, the former group probably

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

existed in a common ancestor of Shewanella spp. Moreover, some of these pathways appear to remain essential
in most of the diverse Shewanella habitats as they were
lost in only a few rare cases. Thus, the Nag pathway is
preserved in 18 and the Grt pathway in 17 of the 19 compared species. This is reminiscent of the distribution of a
recently described lactate utilization machinery [8],
which is present in all but one species consistent with its
proposed role of the main natural supplier of carbon and
energy characteristic of the entire Shewanella genus. On
the other hand, rare pathways (present in 1-4 species)
have more likely originated via lateral gene transfer
events, possibly from species sharing the same ecological
niche. This may be illustrated by the example of the Gnt
utilization pathway that is present in all 4 sequenced
strains of S. baltica but not in any other Shewanella spp.
A conservation of sequence and genomic arrangement
within the Gnt and Rbs gene loci between some closely
related Shewanella strains and distant members of Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae points to
their likely acquisition via a relatively recent lateral gene
transfer event (see additional data file 10).

Conclusions
Overall, the results of this study revealed elements of
conservation and variation that appear to be characteristic of the sugar utilization machinery. All reconstructed
pathways show a strong tendency to be encoded within
compact operons and regulons, and nearly all of the
newly identified individual genes are at least distantly
homologous (and functionally related) to those previously characterized in other species and included in
our original collection of sugar utilization subsystems.
The reconstructed sugar catabolome in Shewanella
spp utilizes 170 distinct proteins forming 17 peripheral
sugar catabolic pathways and CCM (Table 2, Fig. 1). An
apparent âcoreâ subset of peripheral pathways for the
utilization of Nag, Grt, Mal and Glc is conserved in
>70% of compared Shewanella genomes. This level of
conservation not only points to their ancestral origin
but to an apparent importance of these pathways (and
respective sugars) for the physiology of Shewanella spp
in various ecosystems. All other peripheral pathways are
present in <50% of the compared genomes, and among
them, 9 pathways are present only in 1-4 species. The
latter group seemingly originates from the lateral gene
transfer and likely reflects adaptation to specific environmental conditions, which is particularly notable in S.
frigidimarina and S. pealeana, each containing nonoverlapping sets of 3 ârareâ pathways (Fig. 4). Even the most
versatile Shewanella species implement only a fraction
of the entire pan-Shewanella sugar catabolome reflective
of their relatively âlean sugar dietâ.

Methods
The subsystems approach and the SEED platform

Our approach to the reconstruction of sugar catabolic
pathways in a selected group of genomes was based on
functional gene annotation and prediction using two
principal comparative genomics techniques: (i) homology-based methods and (ii) genome context analysis.
Both these methods are implemented in the SEED genomic platform http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/ that
combines a large and rapidly growing integration of
>700 complete annotated genomes (mostly bacterial)
with advanced tools for comparative analysis, gene
annotation, genome context analysis and functional
reconstruction based on subsystems technology [7]. New
genomes are automatically annotated by the RAST server http://rast.nmpdr.org/, a new generation of subsystem-based genome annotation tools [36]. Subsystems in
the SEED provide the framework for further improvement of these annotations and functional predictions.
They are sets of functional roles that capture the current
knowledge of cellular processes and metabolic pathways
including interspecific variation. Each functional role is
typically associated with a set of homologous genes that
implement this role in specific organisms. In addition to
homology-based analysis suggesting at least general class
gene functional assignments, genome context analysis
provides evidence of functional coupling between genes
of known and unknown functions [10]. The most common type of functional coupling evidence comes from
the tendency of functionally related genes (e.g., members
of the same pathway) to be clustered on the chromosome. Other important types of evidence are domain
fusion events, conservation of upstream regulatory sites
(i.e., reg-ulons) and co-occurrence profiles of genes
across a range of genomes. We used the tools in SEED
and other public servers to compute and analyze all
types of functional coupling evidence for each gene
family in our analysis.
Reconstruction of regulons

For identification of a candidate regulatory motif for a
particular sugar catabolic pathway we started from a
training set of potentially co-regulated genes participating in the pathway. Upstream regions of genes from the
training set and their orthologs from multiple Shewanella genomes were used as an input for a DNA motif
detection algorithm. A simple iterative procedure implemented in the program SignalX (as described previously
in [31]) was used for construction of a common transcription factor-binding motif in sets of upstream gene
fragments. Each genome encoding the studied transcription factor was scanned with the constructed profile
using the GenomeExplorer software [37], and genes

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

with candidate regulatory sites in the upstream regions
were selected [38]. The threshold for the site search was
defined as the lowest score observed in the training set.
Among new candidate members of a regulon, only
genes having candidate sites conserved in at least two
other genomes were retained for further analysis. We
also included new candidate regulon members that are
functionally related to the reconstructed sugar catabolic
pathways. Sequence logos for derived regulatory motifs
were drawn using the WebLogo package http://weblogo.
berkeley.edu[39]. The details of reconstructed regulons
are captured and displayed in the specialized database
RegPrecise http://regprecise.lbl.gov[40].
Workflow

Reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory pathways
involved in the carbohydrates utilization was performed
for 19 species of the Shewanella genus with completely
sequenced genomes uploaded from Genbank and integrated in the SEED genomic platform. The overall workflow is illustrated by Fig. 1. First we performed a survey
of all prokaryotic genes known to be involved or potentially involved in utilization of mono- and di-saccharides. A collection of ~480 FIGfams from 35 SEED sugar
metabolic subsystems were classified by their general
functional role (i.e. sugar transport, transcriptional regulation, biochemical transformation, and upstream/auxiliary) (see additional data file 1). Each FIGfam comprises
a functionally uniform group of orthologous proteins in
related organisms. This extensive collection was then
used for homology searches against 19 Shewanella genomes resulting in identification of numerous FIGfams
potentially implicated in sugar metabolism. Manual
curation of the identified Shewanella FIGfams using the
SEED and other genomic resources and tools (see
below) rejected many of them as well as identified some
additional candidate FIGfams based on genome context
analysis. As a result of this iterative process we have
identified ~170 FIGfams present in at least one Shewanella genome and tentatively assigned a role in utilization of a paticular sugar substrate (see additional data
file 2). The identified FIGfams were used for metabolic
reconstruction of Shewanella sugar catabolic pathways
using the subsystems-based approach. The refined functional annotations were combined in the aggregated
SEED subsystem âSugar catabolome in Shewanella speciesâ. Besides SEED, we routinely use other bioinformatic
tools and databases featuring: genomes (Genbank), gene
annotations (UniProt, IMG), primary literature
(PubMed), reactions and pathways (KEGG, BioCyc),
conserved domains and motifs (COG, PFAM, ProDom),
distant homology searches and alignments (PsiBlast,
FFAS, T-Coffee), genome context and occurence profiles
(STRING, Microbes on Line), transcriptional regulation

(RegTransBase, RegulonDB), protein localization prediction (TMPRED, SignalP).
Experimental validation of functional predictions
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and reagents

E. coli strains DH5a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the
knockout mutant ÎbglF from the KEIO collection
(a kind gift from Dr. Mori) [41], were used for complementation analyses. E. coli BL21/DE3 (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD) was used for protein overexpression and
purification. For expression of genes in E. coli, a pBADTOPO vector containing the arabinose promoter
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or a pET-derived vector containing the T7 promoter, His 6 tag, and tobacco etch
virus-protease cleavage site were used. Enzymes for PCR
and DNA manipulations were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Plasmid purification kits were
from Promega (Madison, WI). PCR purification kits and
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin were from
QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). Oligonucleotides for PCR
and sequencing were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys
(Woodlands, TX). All other chemicals, including
sucrose, cellobiose, NADH, ATP, phosphenolpyruvate,
lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, D-glucose,
2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-allose,
D-fructose, L-sorbose, D-tagatose, D-glucosamine, Dmannosamine, D-galactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine,
N-acetylmannosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
PCR amplification and cloning

The 2.9-kb fragment from Shewanella frigidimarina
NCIMB400, which contains two divergently transcribed
genes, scrTII and scrP (Sfri_3989 and Sfri_3990, respectively) and the intergenic region, was amplified using
the primers: 5â²-gcgTTATTTAGCGTCTGCGGTCAACAAATG (forward-1) and 5â²-gagTTATCCGCTGTGTTTAGCCAGTAAATC (reverse-1). For cloning the
fragment containing scrT II only and the intergenic
region, the primers of forward-1 and 5â²-CGCTATACGATCTACGTAAGTGATCAGCTG were used. For
cloning the fragment containing scrP only and the intergenic region, the primers of 5â²-CTCATTATCCTTCATATGGTTAACCATAC and reverse-1 were used.
The 2.7-kb fragment from Shewanella baltica OS155,
which contains the bglAIand bglT genes (Sbal_0544 and
Sbal_0545, repectively), was amplified using the primers:
5â²-gaggaataataaATGAAAATATCTTTACCAAAG (forward-2) and 5â²-cacTTAGCTGGCTCTATTTAATTCCAG (reverse-2). For cloning Sbal_0544 only, the
primers of forward-2 and 5â²-gccTTATTTATTATTGTTATTAGTAAAGTGAGC were used. For cloning
Sbal_0545 only, the primers of 5â²-gaggaataataaATGATTAGCATAAAAGAAAAAATAG and reverse-2 were
used. Nucleotides not present in the original sequence

are shown in lowercase. PCR amplification was performed using the genomic DNAs of S. frigidimarina
NCIMB400 and S. baltica OS155. The PCR fragments
as describe above were cloned into the pBAD-TOPO
expression vector.
The glk II gene from S. baltica OS155 (Sbal_1134)
was amplified using the primers: 5â²-ggcgcacATGTTACGAATTGGTATCGATCTTG (forward-3) and 5â²gcaacgtcgacTTAGCGTCCCCACAACCAAGC (reverse3). Introduced restriction sites (PciI for forward-3 primer and SalI for reverse-3 primer) are shown in boldface. PCR fragment was cloned into the pET-derived
expression vector cleaved by NcoI and SalI. Selected
clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.
Protein purification

Recombinant protein of glkII (Sbal_1134) from S. baltica OS155 was overexpressed as N-terminal fusion
with a His6 tag in E. coli strain BL21/DE3. Cells were
grown on LB media to OD 600 = 0.8 at 37Â°C, induced
by 0.2 mM IPTG, and harvested after 12 h shaking at
20Â°C. Protein purification was performed using rapid
Ni-NTA agarose minicolumn. Briefly, harvested cells
were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 7
containing 100 mM NaCl, 0.03% Brij 35, and 2 mM bmercaptoethanol supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysozyme was added to
1 mg/mL, and the cells were lyzed by freezing-thawing
followed by sonication. After centrifugation at 18,000
rpm, the Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) was added to the
supernatant (50 mM, final concentration), and it was
loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (0.2 ml). After
washing with the starting buffer containing 1 M NaCl
and 0.3% Brij-35, bound proteins were eluted with 0.3
ml of the starting buffer containing 250 mM imidazole.
Protein size, expression level, distribution between
soluble and insoluble forms, and extent of purification
were monitored by SDS-PAGE.
Complementation analyses

In all complementation analyses, cells were pre-cultured
on LB media to exponential growth phase, harvested by
centrifugation, and washed for three times with M9
minimal media without any carbon sources. All cultures
were started with the same optical density at 600 nm
(OD600 nm = 0.03), and performed at 37Â°C in triplicates
in 200 Î¼l of the respective media. The cell growth was
monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm using a
microplate reader (ELx808, BioTek Inc., Winnoski,
Vermont).
Recombinant proteins of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400
ScrT II (Sfri_3989) only, ScrP (Sfri_3990) only, and
ScrTII-ScrP were expressed in E. coli K-12 strain DH5a
under the control of endogenous promoter in the intergenic region. The empty pBAD-TOPO vector was

Page 17 of 19

expressed in the same strain and used as a negative control. The complementation analysis was performed on
M9 minimal media supplemented with 50 Î¼g/ml of thiamine and 20 mM of sucrose.
Recombinant proteins of S. baltica OS155 BglA I
(Sbal_0544) only, BglT (Sbal_0545) only, and BglA I BglT were expressed under the control of arabinose promoter in E. coli ÎbglF mutant. The empty pBAD-TOPO
vector was expressed in the same strain and used as a
negative control. The complementation analysis was
performed on M9 minimal media supplemented with
0.15% of L-arabinose and 20 mM of cellobiose.
In vitro enzyme assays

Glucokinase activity was assayed by coupling the formation of ADP to the oxidation of NADH to NAD + via
pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and monitored at 340 nm. Briefly, 0.1-0.2 Î¼g of purified glucokinase was added to 200 Î¼L of reaction mixture
containing 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgSO4,
1.2 mM ATP, 1.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mM
NADH, 1.2 U of pyruvate kinase, 1.2 U of lactate dehydrogenase, and 5 mM D-glucose at 37Â°C. No activity
was detected in a control experiment, in which an unrelated gene (SO3505) was expressed in the same vector
and purified in parallel. The substrate specificities were
examined by using the same assay method and exchanging glucose for 5 mM of other potential substrates:
2-deoxyglucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-allose,
D-fructose, L-sorbose, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine,
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine,
D-galactosamine, D-glucosamine, D-mannosamine. In
the coupled assays, the change in NADH absorbance was
monitored at 340 nm using a Beckman DTX-880 multimode microplate reader. An NADH extinction coefficient
of 6.22 mM-1cm-1 was used for rate calculation.
Phenotypic analysis of Shewanella spp

Total 14 Shewanella strains were tested for their ability
to grow on 20 different carbon sources as a sole carbon
and energy source. D-/L-lactate mixture was used as a
control. Growth conditions and other details of two different experimental techniques used for growth phenotype analysis are provided in additional files 7 and 8.
In-frame deletion mutagenesis

In-frame deletion mutagenesis of glyT (SO1771) or nagP
(SO3503) was performed using previously published
method [42] with minor modifications. Upstream and
downstream fragments flanking the target locus were
PCR amplified using S. oneidensis MR-1 genomic DNA
and fused via overlap extension PCR. The fusion PCR
amplicon was ligated into XcmI-digested pDS3.0. The
resulting recombinant plasmids were used to transform
E. coli Ã-2155 or WM3063 and subsequently transferred
to S. oneidensis strain MR-1 by conjugation. The primary integrants were selected by plating on LB medium

Rodionov et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:494
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/494

containing 7.5 Î¼g/ml gentamycin. The screening for a
second round of homologous recombination to remove
the plasmid sequence was accomplished by counterselection on LB medium with 5% sucrose. Colonies
growing in the presence of sucrose were screened for
sensitivity to gentamycin (7.5 Î¼g/ml) and then screened
for deletion of the gene of interest using PCR. The
resulting PCR amplicon was then used as the template
for DNA sequencing of the deleted and flanking regions
involved in the recombination events (ACGT, Inc.
Wheeling, IL). In order to validate that the observed
phenotype could be attributed to the targeted deletion,
complementing plasmids were constructed by inserting
appropriate genes downstream to the lac promoter
encoded in pBBR1MCS-5.
