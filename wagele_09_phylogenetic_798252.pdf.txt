Abstract
Background: Molecular phylogenies are being published increasingly and many biologists rely on
the most recent topologies. However, different phylogenetic trees often contain conflicting results
and contradict significant background data. Not knowing how reliable traditional knowledge is, a
crucial question concerns the quality of newly produced molecular data. The information content
of DNA alignments is rarely discussed, as quality statements are mostly restricted to the statistical
support of clades. Here we present a case study of a recently published mollusk phylogeny that
contains surprising groupings, based on five genes and 108 species, and we apply new or rarely used
tools for the analysis of the information content of alignments and for the filtering of noise (masking
of random-like alignment regions, split decomposition, phylogenetic networks, quartet mapping).
Results: The data are very fragmentary and contain contaminations. We show that that signal-like
patterns in the data set are conflicting and partly not distinct and that the reported strong support
for a "rather surprising result" (monoplacophorans and chitons form a monophylum Serialia) does
not exist at the level of primary homologies. Split-decomposition, quartet mapping and neighbornet
analyses reveal conflicting nucleotide patterns and lack of distinct phylogenetic signal for the deeper
phylogeny of mollusks.
Conclusion: Even though currently a majority of molecular phylogenies are being justified with
reference to the 'statistical' support of clades in tree topologies, this confidence seems to be
unfounded. Contradictions between phylogenies based on different analyses are already a strong
indication of unnoticed pitfalls. The use of tree-independent tools for exploratory analyses of data
quality is highly recommended. Concerning the new mollusk phylogeny more convincing evidence
is needed.

Background
The fact that a clade has a high support in phylogenetic
trees does not necessarily imply that (a) the clade is a real
monophylum and (b) that the support for the clade is
really phylogenetic signal. There are many causes of error.
In theory, bootstrap values give no indication of whether
there is a systematic problem within the data set [1]. Bayesian support values may be too optimistic, and a bias may
cause convergence to an incorrect tree. A "bootstrap support of 100% is not enough, the tree must also be correct"
[2]. Furthermore, tree topologies and support values do
not show the large differences in information content of
data sets, so that practically randomized data may be represented by a well resolved and well supported binary tree
[3].
The surprising result obtained by Giribet et al. [4] concerning mollusk phylogeny is essentially a topology for
which the information content of the underlying data
remained unknown. This is not the only recent publication with this problem (see other examples in [3]), but it
is a prominent and interesting case. The analysis was
based on sequences from five genes and 108 species,
including seven outgroup taxa, suggesting sufficient information was available. Here we show that this is not necessarily the case. A general problem is that despite being
available and informative, topology-independent tools
for estimation of data quality (e.g. quartet mapping, split
decomposition, phylogenetic networks) are not much
used.
The tree published by Giribet et al. [4] constitutes a strict
consensus topology based on the parsimony criterion and
implied alignments obtained by direct optimization [5].
This topology, if accepted as a phylogenetic hypothesis,
implies relationships that are highly implausible considering mollusk anatomy and biology. The main dubious
inference is the polyphyly of Bivalvia and Gastropoda.
Bivalves are highly specialized mollusks with a large
number of unique characters such as the laterally compressed body, the bivalved shell with a hinge and ligaments, the loss of the buccal apparatus with radula,
acquisition of two special adductor muscles for the shells,
special pallial muscles, and a spade-like foot adapted for
burrowing [6-10]. Similarly, gastropods are found in two
different clades in the published topology, and as in the
case of Bivalvia, there are many reasons why this
polyphyly is highly improbable [e.g., [6,11-13]]. Another
highly improbable grouping is the sister taxon relationship of Caudovofeata and Cephalopoda. This combination has never been suggested before and no apomorphies
which would support this monophylum are known to us.
Most of the idiosyncrasies of the published topology are
not discussed by Giribet et al. [4]. They focus mainly upon

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/12

only the "Serialia" clade, composed of Polyplacophora
and the monoplacophoran species Laevipilina antarctica,
and present a new hypothesis for the origin of Monoplacophora. The quality of the data was never discussed,
although the single "monoplacophoran DNA was highly
degraded" [4] and only an incomplete sequence of L. antarctica was obtained (1280 bp of the 28S rRNA). One
wonders why only one of the clades in that tree was considered worthy of discussion whereas most parts of the
topology are highly implausible, and whether the implied
alignments used by Giribet et al. [4] are informative
enough to support this hypothesis.
Using methods independent of tree reconstruction, we
show that the signal-like patterns in this "largest data set
of mollusks ever assembled" are weak, that application of
alternative tree-reconstruction methods partly results in
alternative hypotheses, and that morphological evidence
contradicts the Serialia hypothesis.

Methods
Alignments
Complete alignment
The multigene data set provided by Dr. Giribet (based on
an implied alignment obtained after a POY analysis [5,14]
is a multifragment alignment of 108 taxa with many missing data. From the total length of the alignment (9378 bp)
more than 30% of the base positions are unsequenced.
Additionally, 29% of the base positions are represented by
alignment gaps resulting in an alignment with 60% missing data or gaps. For re-analysis of the complete data set,
we did not alter the original alignment in the first step. As
a second step, this alignment was purified from ambiguous sites after identification of ambiguous and randomlike regions with the help of ALISCORE [15], and an additional data set was obtained after elimination of positions
with gaps or missing data.
28S rRNA fragment
Since the only information relevant for the placement of
the monoplacophoran species is contained within the
analyzed 28S rRNA fragment (positions 2959–4254 of the
original alignment), we extracted from the original alignment those sequence fragments covering this region. Eight
of the 108 species had to be excluded, since no sequence
fragments of that area were available for them (see table 1
in [4]). The alignment is 1280 bp long, consisting of 56%
missing data (33% non sequenced regions, 23% alignment gaps). Our original intention to use novel software
in order to fold the RNAs, align them according to the calculated secondary structure, and apply RNA-models for
helical regions was not feasible due to the incompleteness
of the available 28S fragments. Sequences were realigned
with the Mafft v6.240 program [16,17], which offers various multiple-alignment strategies. For our analysis, we

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:12

employed the E-INS-i method and default settings for gap
opening and gap extension. The length of the resulting
alignment was 986 bp. Similar to the procedure for the
complete alignment, the 28Sr RNA fragment was also subjected to an analysis with ALISCORE (see below).
Identification of ambiguous sites
Identification of ambiguous and noisy alignment positions of the complete alignment and of the 28S partition
was achieved with ALISCORE[15]. Noisy positions contain
nucleotide patterns that cannot be distinguished from
randomized ones. The software identifies ambiguously
aligned and random-like regions in multiple sequence
alignments, and has certain advantages in comparison to
G-Blocks [[18]; see also [15]]. The Monte Carlo resampling compares the score of the originally aligned
sequences in a given window position with scores of randomly drawn sequences of similar character composition.
Hence, ALISCORE provides a formal approach to evaluating
sequence alignments and to identifying sections of random similarity caused by saturated sequence divergence,
lack of data, and/or alignment ambiguity. The following
settings of ALISCORE were used for both alignments: window size was six positions, gaps were treated as ambiguous characters, and pair-wise comparisons were guided by
a neighbor joining tree, representing the p-distances of the
included taxa.
Signal-like patterns in alignments and conflict
We subjected the original complete alignment, as well as
the original alignment of the 28S rRNA partition to a splitdecomposition analysis using SplitsTree Vers. 4.6 [19,20].
Split graphs show more clades than those depicted in a
binary tree graph and visualize conflicting evidence. Since
we were mainly interested in the structure of the raw data,
the neighbornet network [21,22] based on uncorrected
distances was most relevant. We also compared graphs
based on application of different substitution models,
(HKY model: [23]; GTR model: [24]), with uncorrected
data, and compared results based on masking of problematic character sets (e. g. gap rich regions). The longest
branches visualized in neighbornet graphs were excluded
in order to study noise effects that are introduced by long
branches.

Split-supporting nucleotide patterns with putative
synapomorphies [25,26] were visualised with the SAMS
program [3], which allows identification of conserved
split-supporting positions without reference to a tree and
is therefore independent of model assumptions. This software is not used to construct trees but for exploratory
analyses of alignments, especially for visualizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Patterns of supporting positions were
identified in the 28Sr RNA fragment of the original align-

ment, which is the only relevant fragment supporting the
Serialia hypothesis.
Quartet mapping
We used the quartet mapping technique [27] as implemented in quartm2 [28] to asses relationships of the Laevipilina sequence with four predefined groups of sequences:
groups B: Bivalvia, G: Gastropoda, P: Polyplacophora, and
S: Scaphopoda. Laevipilina as the query sequence is compared to all possible combinations of these three groups
of sequences in the way that in each case two predefined
groups of sequences, for example B + G, are combined
into one. Quartets of sequences are randomly drawn, and
support for each of the three possible unrooted topologies
of these quartets is calculated. For all analyzed quartets, a
unit simplex can be drawn to visualize support for the
three different topologies among the four groups of
sequences [27,28]. This method has the advantage that
quartet mapping directly tests support for an interior
branch without any reference to phylogenetic structure
within predefined groups. This effectively leads to a reduction of noise.

The analyses were conducted three times based on the
original alignment: (A) with all characters, (B) without
columns containing gaps and (C) with the data after
application of ALISCORE masking. In all three analyses it
was apparent that Laevipilina fits best the Scaphopoda and
Polyplacophora sequences, albeit without strong support.
Red circles indicate the mean fraction of simplex points
and radius the standard deviation. In all three groups, the
mean center of simplex points is within the star like tree
area, indicating only weak, if any, signal for a single preferred topology. Exclusion of gap-containing columns
and masking the alignment with the ALISCORE approach
enhanced signal, but not beyond the star tree like area.
Bayesian analysis
We used the MrBayes 3.1.2 program [29,30] to infer a posterior probability distribution of topologies and branch
lengths of the original alignment and the 28S rRNA partial
gene of the original alignment. We applied the substitution model and parameters chosen by Giribet et al. [4],
and determined burn-in by inspecting time-series plots of
the log posterior to identify the stationary phase. For each
run, 10,000 trees were discarded as "burn-in" trees separately, equivalent to 1 million generations. Posterior
probabilities were calculated using a 50% majority-rule
consensus tree from the set of trees generated in all
MCMC runs.
Maximum likelihood analysis
Maximum Likelihood analyses of the original alignment
and the 28S rRNA partial gene alignment were conducted
with the parallel Pthreads-based version of RAxML 7.0.4

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:12

[31]. Nucleotide substitution was displayed by the GTR
model with all model parameters estimated from the data
and four categories of gamma distributed rates across
sites. Using this model, Maximum Likelihood bootstrap
percentages were obtained after 1000 replications.

Results
Data quality
Some of the sequences currently deposited in GenBank
are mislabelled or based on contamination. Of major
importance for the present study is the 28S rRNA Chaetoderma sp. AY145397 (Caudofoveata) sequence, which was
named Chaetoderma nitidulum in Giribet et al. [4]. This
sequence is identical to that of the vestimentiferan polychaete Riftia (e-value 0.0), hence, Caudofoveata or Solenogastres are not represented at all in the 28S rRNA data
set. Where Chaetoderma appears in our graphs, this is
probably a polychaete sequence.
Ambiguous sites
Alignment columns with a nucleotide pattern that cannot
be distinguished from randomized patterns were filtered
out with ALISCORE, leaving only the more conserved sites.
In the evaluation of the alignment we consequently
treated gaps as ambiguous characters. Due to the large
number of missing data and the variability of some gene
areas in the complete alignment, only few positions survived the procedure. ALISCORE detected 6303 sites as putative, randomly similar (67,21%). For the 28Sr RNA
fragment, 187 positions (19,32%) are putative, randomly
similar. Using only conserved sites in phylogenetic analyses does not exclude misleading effects caused by parallelisms and symplesiomorphies [3], but some of the
background noise is filtered out.
Nonparametric split-supporting patterns
Complete alignment
For exploratory data analyses we first used the original,
complete alignment[4]. Neighbornet graphs constructed
from uncorrected distances (Fig. 1: all 9378 positions, 108
taxa, fit value = 93,08) had only few splits supported by
distinct edges. The clade Serialia as proposed by Giribet et
al. (2006) does not exist in this inference. The monoplacophoran sequence (Laevipilina antarctica) is found
amidst a cluster of bivalves. The most prominent split separates all cephalopods except the Nautilus sequences,
which branch off more basally from the cephalopod clade
and is also supported as a whole by a set of parallel edges
(Fig. 1: taxa and separating edges in orange). The remaining network is dominated by parallelograms, hence it is
obvious that the alignment contained many conflicting
nucleotide patterns. The signal for monophyly of the Mollusca was not distinct. The Caudofoveata (Chaetoderma
nitidulum and Scutopus ventrolineatus in mauve) are clearly
separated from the remaining sequences, and there are

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/12

short parallel edges for the two clades Scaphopoda and
Polyplacophora (Fig. 1, brown and green, respectively).
The Gastropoda are scattered over the graph (blue). Two
long-branched gastropod sequences (Cellana sp., Eulepetopsis vitrea) are attracted to the long cephalopod branch.
Non-monophyly of Gastropoda and Bivalvia together
with a lack of jackknife-support values for the deeper
nodes were also attributes of the tree published by Giribet
et al. [4]. The lack of support for deeper clades in Figure 1
indicates the absence of a distinct phylogenetic signal for
most of the larger species groups.
To reduce the noise in the original data set, we excluded
the most conspicuous long branches identified visually in
network analyses (cephalopods, and the three gastropods
Cellana sp., Eulepetopsis vitrea and Peltodoris atromaculata,
see Figs. 1 and Five). This selection (Fig. 2) does not
improve the network, treeness is still missing, and there is
a set of parallel edges separating a clade composed of the
only monoplacophoran species and several Bivalvia species, the latter belonging to the highly derived Euheterodonta clade. Additional exclusion of gaps or application
of substitution models altered the length of branches but
not the general topology. Obviously, long branches are
not the only cause for conflicts in this data set.
28S rRNA fragment
In the network analysis of the original 28S rRNA fragment
alignment we do find the Serialia group, at least at first
sight, although the polyplacophoran Lepidopleurus cajetanus is not part of this clade (star in Fig. 3: placed at base of
Brachiopod-Bivalvia 2 split). Exclusion of long-branch
taxa (Cellana sp., Eulepetopsis vitrea, Creseis sp. and Cephalopoda) does not alter the network (Fig. 3), but the conflict in the data becomes more obvious. It is important to
note that in this analysis, the support for a Serialia clade
(excluding Lepidopleurus) is comparable to that of {Laevipilina and a subgroup of bivalves}, indicated by the length
of the edges (green vs. red in Fig. 3). The weight (corresponding to branch length: [21]) for the first split is
0.0049, for the second split 0.0056.

Application of SAMS was performed in order to identify
conserved clade-supporting positions (= putative homologies) for Serialia within the 28S fragment of the original
alignment. Note that SAMS does not need a tree. This
application represents all splits in an alignment and identifies putative primary homologies. Fig. 4 shows the first
50 splits with the highest support. There are only few
splits with distinct underlying nucleotide patterns. The
best split contains a clade composed of the two patellogastropods Cellana sp. and Eulepetopsis vitrea (17 asymmetrical positions and 14 noisy positions), which is also
the longest branch in Fig. 5. The next column represents
the split between the cephalopod group Coleoida vs. all

nodes of the mollusk tree no conserved nucleotide patterns can be detected (see also Fig. 6). No split with conserved

{Polyplacophora + Laevipilina antarctica} is present.
Quartet mapping for the 28S rRNA fragment
The analyses of the 28S region of the original alignment
were executed three times: (A) with all characters, (B)
without gap-containing columns, and (C) with the data
after application of ALISCORE masking. Accumulation of
dots in triangle corners and absence of dots in the central
region of triangles are indications for phylogenetic struc-

ture of the data set. In all three analyses (Fig. 7) it is apparent that Laevipilina fits best the Scaphopoda and
Polyplacophora sequences (triangle corners with groups
{(L)(S)} and {(L)(P)}), albeit without strong support.
Red circles indicate the mean fraction of simplex points
and the radius represents the standard deviation. In all
three groups the mean center of simplex points (red dot)
is within the star like tree area, indicating only weak if any
signal for a single preferred topology. Excluding of gapcontaining columns and masking the alignment with the
ALISCORE approach enhanced signal, but not beyond the
star tree area.
Note that exclusion of positions with gaps or missing data
eliminates most of the informative sequence positions – a

nor Gastropoda are monophyletic. The Serialia are not supported.

consequence of the large unsequenced regions in many
sequences of this data set. Exclusion of random-like positions with ALISCORE retains more information.
Tree reconstruction
Complete alignment
Reanalysing the original alignment under maximum likelihood and Bayesian assumptions, gave similar results as
those of Giribet et al [4], with similar high support values
(not shown). However, because many regions of the
alignment contained a high proportion of missing data
and many regions could not be aligned unambiguously,
we repeated the phylogenetic analyses with a purified and
necessarily smaller data set by excluding all positions
identified by ALISCORE as random-like. As seen in Fig. 7,
ALISCORE conserves more structure in the data (quartet
series C) than a flat deletion of all sequence positions containing gaps (quartet series B).

This resulted in different topologies in both the Bayesian
and the maximum likelihood analyses (Fig. 5); in contrast
to previously published trees [4,32,33], but in agreement
with the neighbornet analysis, all bivalve taxa clustered
together, with only Laevipilina antarctica nested within
that clade.
28S rRNA fragment
Phylogenetic analyses of the 28S rRNA fragment of the
original alignment exhibited incongruent results: Serialia
has been recovered by applying Bayesian inference (Fig. 6)
but with a low posterior probability (0.61) and the polyplacophoran Lepidopleurus cajetanus was not a part of the
Seralia clade (in agreement with Neighbornet analyses).
In the Maximum Likelihood analysis, the gastropods Cellana sp. and Eulepetopsis vitrea nested within the Serialia
clade (no bootstrap support), but again, Lepidopleurus
cajetanus was not included in this group.

Spectrum of split-supporting positions as estimated with SAMS. Column height represents the number of clade-supporting positions, i.e. putative primary homologies. Column parts above the y axis represent the best supported of the two

state only in functional ingroup); yellow: noisy positions (more than one character state in functional in- and outgroup; see
Wägele and Rödding 1998a, b). The first ten columns represent the best supported splits and contain the following groupings:
1: Cellana sp.+ Eulepetopsis vitrea; 2: Coleoida; 3 Coleoida + Creseis sp; 4: Nautilus pompilius + Nautilus scrobiculatus; 5: Cephalopoda; 6: Cephalopoda + Creseis sp.; 7: Paranerilla limicola + Chaetoderma nitidulum; 8: Chamelea striatula + Corbicula spp + Mercenaria mercenaria; 9: Cellana sp.+ Eulepetopsis vitrea + Coleoida; 10: Cellana sp. + Eulepetopsis vitrea + Creseis sp. + Laevipilina
antarctica. No split was detected that unites Laevipilina and Polyplacophora.

After implementation of ALISCORE and exclusion of
ambiguous sites, additional analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference) were performed with the
shorter fragment. Serialia in the sense of Giribet et al. [4]
were recovered applying the Bayesian inference, albeit
with a posterior probability of only 0.75 and without
bootstrap support. In the Maximum Likelihood analysis,
the gastropod Peltodoris atromaculata was nested within
the Serialia.
It is noteworthy that all analyses of the 28S rRNA fragment, irrespective of exclusion or inclusion of ambiguous
sites, resulted in highly unresolved consensus trees, indicating lack of phylogenetic signal in this particular fragment (see Fig. 6).

Discussion
Data quality and phylogeny inference
The notable incongruence among trees in the published
literature clearly indicates that good resolution of and
support for clades in published topologies are no proof of
the reliability of the data and methods of analysis. For
example, crustaceans are polyphyletic in [34] but paraphyletic in [35]. Tardigrades are the sister taxon of Nematoda in [36], but the sister group of Onychophora and
Euarthropoda in [37]. Since, in each case, at least one of
these pairwise incompatible inferences must be incorrect,
it is legitimate to ask which data have a better signal-tonoise ratio. It has also been demonstrated in simulations
that false clades with high support may be found in
inferred trees that do not correspond to the original topology [e.g. [38,39]]. Therefore, the fact that the Serialia clade

Visualizing phylogenetic structure of alignments via quartet mapping (Nieselt-Struwe and von Haeseler, 2001).
Dots in a corner of a triangle represent high support for only one of the three topologies that can be constructed for a quartet
of taxa. Dots in the centre represent a star-like topology, and the rest of the triangle stands for intermediate situations. Red
circles indicate placement of the mean fraction of points. In all cases the majority of quartets are near the star-tree region, indicating little or no phylogenetic signal. The studied combinations are: A1–6: Original alignment of Giribet et al. (2006) with all
characters. B1–6: Same alignment after exclusion of columns with gaps or missing data. C1–6: Same alignment after masking
with the ALISCORE approach. For each alignment, the association of Laevipilina with all six possible variants of pairs of higher
mollusc taxa were examined (see text). B = Bivalvia, G = Gastropoda, L = Laevipilina, P = Polyplacophora, S = Scaphopoda.

of Giribet et al. [4] had a jackknife support of 95 in the
parsimony analysis is not necessarily evidence for the discovery of a new and distinct phylogenetic signal.
In the case of the mollusk phylogeny discussed here, the
original alignment seems to be rich in data at first glance
(five genes and 108 species were used), however, the quality of these data is very difficult to estimate if one only
reads the publication. Since Giribet et al. obtained only a
partial sequence (about 1.2 kb of 28SrRNA) of the monoplacophoran Laevipilina antarctica, and the placement of
the monoplacophoran can only be the result of similarities shared in the 28S partition of the data set, the relevant
information is limited.
One may argue that gaps and missing data do not bias
phylogenies, but this depends on the patterns of missing
characters. Hartmann and Vision [40] showed by simulation studies with incomplete alignments that parsimony
algorithms in particular, as applied in POY, had the lowest
accuracy in finding the correct tree and the highest sensitivity for patterns of missing data. Topological disagreement with the original tree of the simulation (range from
0 showing complete agreement to 1 showing complete
disagreement) approached the median value of 0.4 in
alignments with 60% missing data (similar to the alignments in [4]), but 1.0 only in correctly aligned simulated
data (very unlikely in the alignments in question).
Giribet [41] argued that a primary homology (positional
homology in the starting alignment) is irrelevant if it does
not comply with the congruence test (fit of characters to a
tree), hence Giribet et al. [4] rely on phylogenies inferred
with POY. Using POY means that criteria for primary
homology are not separated from optimality criteria used
for tree inference (co-optimizing topology and homology), or, in other words, that homology hypotheses are
adapted with the method to optimize results, which leads
to circular reasoning. Quality criteria based on empirical
and topology-independent evidence, such as variability
and similarity of sequence regions and fit of positions to
a secondary structure model, are not considered. This is a
fundamental difference from our approach: In any empirical science, data quality can and should be evaluated
prior to analyses that aim at hypotheses testing. It should
be stressed that evaluation of data quality and the use of
alignments to infer an hypothesis can be usefully treated
as two independent steps [e.g. [20,39,42]], although a discussion of this point is beyond the scope of the present
study. For the relevance of primary homologies see [4350]. For problems with POY see [51-53].
The key question raised by Giribet et al.[4] – the position
of Monoplacophora within Mollusca,- was based only on
a fragment of the 28S rRNA gene (1280 bp). Moreover, a

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/12

rather high proportion of taxa is represented by short
sequences, 18% of which are represented by less than 350
bp. This raises the question of whether the available information is really sufficient to support radically new ideas
such as the Serialia hypothesis. To answer this we used different tools for an a priori data exploration (= prior to traditional tree inference).
A priori analyses
Phylogenetic networks are derived from the split decomposition method originally described by Bandelt and
Dress [54]. Networks show support for groups of
sequences even when they are mutually incompatible and
visualize edge-lengths for signal-like patterns and contradictions [3,21,22,55-59]. If networks are tree-like, one can
assume that phylogenetic signal dominates in the data set
[42]. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show long terminal branches connected by networks with short edges, thus indicating conflict and lack of distinct split-supporting nucleotide
patterns for deeper nodes of the phylogeny.

In Fig. 1, some clades with distinct elongate stems are
present (certain gastropod groups, cephalopods, Caudofoveata, Solenogastres), but these are not relevant to the
discussion of the deeper mollusk phylogeny. Interestingly, the monoplacophoran sequence shares character
states with bivalves (Figs. 1, 2, 5) and Polyplacophora
(Figs. 3, 6).
Few of the groupings are separated by distinct splits, i.e. by
sets of parallel edges that are longer than those of conflicting splits. This observation is congruent with the spectrum
of split-supporting patterns (Fig. 4), which is obtained
with a different method but nevertheless shows the same
signal-to-noise relation: cephalopods conserve shared
character states, but the Serialia do not appear among the
50 best supported splits. The third method we used, quartet mapping, is an entirely different tool but the results it
gave are similar (Fig. 7): there is no phylogenetic structure
that allows an unequivocal placement of Laevipilina.
Although all of these tools can be improved to refine their
ability to identify signal-like patterns, it is evident that
their use shows congruent results. The large number of
conflicting patterns, which are not visible when analyses
are restricted to conventional tree inference, call for caution in propagation of new hypotheses.
The Serialia in tree topologies
Our tree-reconstruction analyses of the original dataset
supported a Serialia clade only with the complete alignment, as was done in the original publication [4]. However, a priori network analyses as well as tree
reconstruction with the purified alignment (after masking
problematic regions with ALISCORE, Fig. 5) contradicted

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:12

this hypothesis because Laevipilina antarctica is nested
within the bivalves. Moreover, monophyly of Serialia is
only achieved when analysing the 28S rRNA partition
after exclusion of ambiguous sites and with very low Bayesian support (Fig. 6), which is unacceptable as clear phylogenetic signal. One also has to keep in mind that
Bayesian support may be too optimistic [60]
Biologists often assume that it is sufficient to use correct
substitution models for phylogenetic reconstruction.
However, missing signals cannot be compensated for even
with the best model. Missing signals due to signal erosion
have been documented in older radiations of the metazoan tree [61-63] and data transformation using models
may even increase the level of noise when deep phylogenies are studied [42].
Morphological characters
A cladistic analysis of morphological characters is beyond
the scope of the present study, but documented homologies can contradict hypotheses even without inferring a
tree. For example, the fine structure of feathers (as evidence for homology of the plumage) would obviously not
be compatible with polyphyly of feathered organisms
(birds). We therefore briefly review morphological characters as additional sources of information. For discussion
of homology of morphological characters we refer to the
malacological literature (see below).

Giribet et al. [4] stated that "the disparity of mollusk body
plans is so great that it is quite difficult to find a single trait
shared by all seven classes of mollusks" and that "preconceived ideas on mollusk relationships ...rely almost
entirely on shell morphology". This argument implies
that morphology is useless for establishing the monophyly of mollusks, yet many unique traits are shared by all
larger mollusk taxa in their basic pattern. Some of these
attributes were mentioned in the introduction and additional examples are discussed below. The monophyly of
Mollusca is supported by homology of mantle and a mantle cavity containing at least one pair of gills, the ventral
"foot", the presence of a dorsal heart with paired auricles,
a bilateral nervous system with two pairs of conspicuous
longitudinal nerve cords with major commissures only
anteriorly, and the presence of rhogocytes. The radula is a
unique mollusk character and its secondary absence in
particle- or filter-feeding species is easily explained [6]
(see latest review of Haszprunar et al. [64]).
The idea that Monoplacophora might be derived from
Polyplacophora conflicts with the Conchifera hypothesis,
which places extant Monoplacophora (Neopilinida) at
the base of the Conchifera, whereas Polyplacophora are
usually regarded as the sister group of Conchifera [6,6468]. In the few morphologically based phylogenetic anal-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/12

yses available to date, this position is confirmed or at least
not contradicted [6,68].
Giribet et al. [4] contend that serially repeated gills and
the eight sets of dorsoventral retractor muscles are a
synapomorphy of Monoplacophora + Polyplacophora.
They do not discuss the characters shared by Conchifera,
although these cannot be ignored: Conchifera (comprising Monoplacophora, Gastropoda, Cephalopoda,
Bivalvia and Scaphopoda) have a massive shell that protects the dorsal visceral mass and covers a larger dorsal
area than the serial shells of Polyplacophora. In addition,
the outer mantle surface protected only by cuticle and single calcareous spiculae in non-conchiferans is covered by
the single massive shell in conchiferans. The suprarectal
commissure of the nervous system seen in non-conchiferans is replaced by a subrectal commissure in Conchifera.
Conchifera are further characterized by typical statocysts
near the pedal ganglion. Haszprunar [64] names another
synapomorphy of the Conchifera, namely, the cilia with a
single ciliary root, rather than two ciliary rootlets typical
of metazoans, including Solenogastres, Caudofoveata and
Polyplacophora.
The presence of eight dorsoventral retractor muscles in
extant Monoplacophora, regarded by Giribet et al.[4] as a
synapomorphy shared with Polyplacophora, can be interpreted as a plesiomorphic homology inherited from the
common ancestor of all Conchifera and Polyplacophora
(the Testaria or Eumollusca hypothesis [e.g. [65,69,70]]).
Some fossil bivalves with eight pairs are known [71,72]
and less derived bivalves still show six pedal retractor
muscles. The Polyplacophora retain a mobile dorsal
exoskeleton composed of eight small shells. According to
this view, after fusion of these single shells in the stemline
of Conchifera, the eight pairs of rectractor muscles were
retained in the most primitive Conchifera, of which the
Neopilinida survive. Giribet et al. [4] did not mention that
the dorsoventral muscles of Neopilina already show signs
of simplification: Polyplacophora have two pairs of muscles arranged in tandem for each dorsal shell, whereas in
the well studied Neopilina these are fused – a probable
consequence of the simpler shell configuration. It can be
assumed that this simplification continued during conchiferan evolution and led to muscle reductions in higher
evolved Conchifera [6,65,66,73].
This hypothesis resolves the conflict between homologies
shared by Monoplacophora and Polyplacophora on one
hand, and homologies present only in Conchifera on the
other hand. The first set of homologies consists of plesiomorphies, whereas the second consists of apomorphies of
Conchifera. Some similarities of the pharyngeal area of
Monoplacophora to the pharynx of chitons as described
by Wingstrand [74] are probably homologous (glandular

epithelium of subradular sac, similarity of salivary glands,
radular vesicles), but it is not clear if these are plesiomorphies or apomorphies and which variations occur in other
Conchifera. Giribet et al. [4] mentioned traces of seriality
that are seen in different mollusk taxa but did not offer an
explanation for this observation. In the traditional understanding of mollusk phylogeny these characters are not
enigmatic; some are independent of the shell-adductor
system (spicules on caudofoveate larvae) and offer no
motive to search for segmentation, whereas others (gills
and nephridia in primitive cephalopods) can be interpreted as remnants of the seriality inferred for the last
common ancestor of Polyplacophora and Conchifera.

References

Giribet et al [4] pointed out that shell formation of
Neopilinida differs from other Conchifera and concluded
that this indicates non-homology. Haszprunar and
Schäfer [75] indicated that the foliated layer of nacre is not
homologous to the nacre of gastropods. However, these
authors also referred to Poulicek and Jeuniaux [76], who
considered the microstructure and the composition of the
chitinous organic matrix of the neopilinid shell to be
more similar to other conchiferans than to polyplacophorans.

Conclusion
All our analyses indicate that the rejection of the traditional views about mollusk phylogeny by Giribet et al [4]
was premature and support in their data set for Serialia is
not higher than for alternative hypotheses. We encourage
a more critical investigation of molecular data prior to tree
reconstruction and the use of analytical methods that
detect incongruencies. Problems created by missing data
on a large scale have to be addressed in much greater
detail, which is especially called for in view of the oncoming floods of EST analyses and other genomic data sets. In
order to avoid premature conclusions it is also important
to discuss evidence available from other sources, in this
case – from comparative anatomy of mollusks. Above all,
data quality and completeness should be transparent.
