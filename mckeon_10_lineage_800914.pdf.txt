Abstract
Background: Cryptic species complexes are common among anophelines. Previous phylogenetic analysis based
on the complete mtDNA COI gene sequences detected paraphyly in the Neotropical malaria vector Anopheles
marajoara. The “Folmer region” detects a single taxon using a 3% divergence threshold.
Methods: To test the paraphyletic hypothesis and examine the utility of the Folmer region, genealogical trees
based on a concatenated (white + 3’ COI sequences) dataset and pairwise differentiation of COI fragments were
examined. The population structure and demographic history were based on partial COI sequences for 294
individuals from 14 localities in Amazonian Brazil. 109 individuals from 12 localities were sequenced for the nDNA
white gene, and 57 individuals from 11 localities were sequenced for the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2).
Results: Distinct A. marajoara lineages were detected by combined genealogical analysis and were also supported
among COI haplotypes using a median joining network and AMOVA, with time since divergence during the
Pleistocene (<100,000 ya). COI sequences at the 3’ end were more variable, demonstrating significant pairwise
differentiation (3.82%) compared to the more moderate 2.92% detected by the Folmer region. Lineage 1 was
present in all localities, whereas lineage 2 was restricted mainly to the west. Mismatch distributions for both
lineages were bimodal, likely due to multiple colonization events and spatial expansion (~798 - 81,045 ya). There
appears to be gene flow within, not between lineages, and a partial barrier was detected near Rio Jari in Amapá
state, separating western and eastern populations. In contrast, both nDNA data sets (white gene sequences with or
without the retention of the 4th intron, and ITS2 sequences and length) detected a single A. marajoara lineage.
Conclusions: Strong support for combined data with significant differentiation detected in the COI and absent in
the nDNA suggest that the divergence is recent, and detectable only by the faster evolving mtDNA. A within
subgenus threshold of >2% may be more appropriate among sister taxa in cryptic anopheline complexes than the
standard 3%. Differences in demographic history and climatic changes may have contributed to mtDNA lineage
divergence in A. marajoara.

Background
About 1.8 million species are known on Earth, including more than 1 million insects, 250,000 higher plants
and 69,000 fungi [1]. The Amazon comprises much of
this biodiversity and is considered the largest gene

reserve in the world, with an estimated 14% of all
plant and animal species within its boundaries [2].
Because speciation is not always accompanied by morphological change [3], the true number of biological
species is likely to be greater than current estimates
[4]. Genetic analysis plays an increasingly important
role in identifying changes in population structure
and elucidating taxonomic status and phylogenetic
relationships.

Genetically divergent but morphologically cryptic species have been described in many aquatic organisms [5],
birds [6,7] and insects [8,9], particularly among mosquitoes in the Dipteran genus Anopheles [10-12]. The Neotropical Albitarsis Complex contains at least six species,
only some of which are documented malaria vectors:
Anopheles marajoara, a local and regionally important
vector in lowland rainforest [13-15], Anopheles janconnae (previously Anopheles albitarsis E) implicated in
local transmission in Amazonian savannah [16]; and
Anopheles deaneorum, which appears to consist of multiple species [17], and is a potential vector, as demonstrated by comparative susceptibility laboratory studies
[18,19].
Various methods have been used to investigate species
delimitation and identifications in the Albitarsis Complex [11,20,21], culminating, most recently, in the recognition of six species [22], but see Bourke et al [17].
Genealogical analyses of complete mtDNA COI (Cytochrome oxidase I) sequences found that A. marajoara is
paraphyletic, and may consist of at least two phylogenetic species [10] or lineages [3,23], one of which may
be A. janconnae.
The mitochondrial genome has been used extensively
in studies of molecular evolution [24] and the COI gene
has resolved evolutionary relationships among closely
related species for a wide range of taxa [25,26], including
insects [27,28] and cryptic species complexes [29,30]. The
Folmer region, 648-bp at the 5’ end of the COI mitochondrial gene, has emerged as the standard barcode
region [31,32]. Interspecific divergence within insects
almost always exceeds 3% and this value has been used
as a speciation threshold [33]. The true test of DNA barcode precision would include comparisons with sister
species [34]. The utility of DNA barcoding among insects
is still being debated, because of success in revealing
cryptic species [31,35,36] on one hand, and the inability
to reliably detect species boundaries on the other [36-38].
An estimated 20% failure rate has been noted at the species level due to non-monophyly [39], which increases
among insects due to overlapping ranges of intra- and
interspecific sequence divergences [40]. Together these
findings suggest that the threshold level could be set
lower than 3% to minimize false negatives [36].
Accurate morphological identification of the adult
females of species within the Albitarsis Complex is virtually impossible, and the ITS2 has become a recognized
molecular tool for identification [21,41,42]. ITS2 variation is low within a species due to homogenization and
fixation while the overall fragment length is generally
variable between species [20,43-45]. As such it can
usually resolve phylogenetic relationships at different
taxonomic levels, and detect recently diverged taxa such
as sibling species of mosquitoes [46].

Members of a species are rarely distributed homogeneously in space, and population subdivision can occur
in response to geographical boundaries, social behaviour
and genetic variation [47]. Patterns in biological
sequence data that arise from ancestry can be useful in
determining the structure and boundaries of a given
species [48]. The objective of this study was to test the
hypothesis of paraphyly [10] using a combined data set
(white gene + COI) and to evaluate the population
structure of A. marajoara to address the following questions: 1) is the proposed paraphyletic status supported;
2) what is the level of genetic differentiation between
populations; 3) can lineages of A. marajoara be distinguished by the Barcode of Life (BOLD) 3% species
threshold; and 4) can genetic differentiation be
explained by demographic phenomena, geographic
boundaries and (or) natural selection.

Methods
Mosquito collection

Adult female mosquitoes from seven localities spanning
roughly 890 kilometers of a transect along the Amazon
River were collected using Shannon traps adjacent to
breeding habitats between Amazonas state near Urucara
along the Amazon river and the tributary of Rio Paru
entering the Amazon river. They were also collected
from Itaituba, south of the Amazon River, Pará State, in
2005 (collection protocol approved by the New York
State Department of Health IRB and Brazilian Instituto
Evandro Chagas, Belém, Pará state Ethical Committee).
Mosquitoes were identified morphologically using the
key of Deane et al. [49] as A. albitarsis s.l. Previously
extracted specimens collected between 1995 and 2001,
using a human landing catch protocol approved by the
University of Vermont and the Brazilian Instituto Evandro Chagas, Belém, Pará state Ethical Committee, from
seven localities in northeastern Pará and Amapá states
of Brazil and from Itaituba, south of the Amazon River
in Pará State, were also included [50]. Genomic DNA
was extracted using the Puregene DNA isolation kit
(Gentra Systems) and maintained at Griffin Laboratory
at -80°C. Ten to 27 mosquitoes per site were selected
for DNA amplification and sequencing of the COI
(Table 1). A subset of four to 15 samples for the white
gene and four to seven samples for ITS2 were amplified
and sequenced (Table 1).
Amplification and sequencing

A 1200-bp fragment of the COI gene was amplified using
the forward primer UEA3 and the reverse primer UEA10
[28]. An 822-bp fragment from the 3’ end using PCR primers: 2195D (5’-TGATTYTTTGGTCATCCNGAAGT-3’;
a modification of C1-J-2195 for amplification in Collembola [51]) and FLY10A (5’-AATGCACTAATCTGCCA

TATTAG-3’; a modification of TL2-N-3014 for amplification in Simuliid flies [52]) was previously amplified for the
northeastern collection samples [50]. Individual PCR reactions were preformed using Ready-To-Go-PCR bead
(Amersham Pharmacia/Biotech, NJ, USA) and run on a
PTC 100 or 200 series thermal cycler (Biorad, Inc.), or a
PTC-100 (MJ Research, Inc.), using the conditions stipulated in Mirabello and Conn [53]. The Applied Genomics
Technology Core (Wadsworth Center) carried out the
sequencing. The forward and reverse COI sequences were
aligned using Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corps, MI,
USA), grouped together by sight and trimmed in PAUP*,
version 4.0 [54]. The complete overlap of both COI primer
sets created a 488-bp fragment (Additional file 1).
An 800-bp fragment of the white gene was amplified
using the W2R and WF primers, with the PCR conditions as reported in Mirabello and Conn [55]. A 500-bp
fragment of the ribosomal ITS2 was amplified using the
primers 18S and 28S with the parameters in Li and
Wilkerson [20]. The PCR products were cleaned,
sequenced and aligned creating a 496-bp fragment of
the white gene and 361-bp of the ITS2 with complete
forward and reverse overlap for each marker. Unique
sequences for all markers are available in GenBank
[GenBank: HQ026025-HQ026113].
Phylogenetic relationship

All A. albitarsis s.l. sequences were identified to species
by multiple gene (COI, white, ITS2) comparisons to
those deposited in GenBank: A. albitarsis [DQ076207/
DQ076208;
AY956299/AY956300;
AF462386/
AF462387], A. oryzalimnetes, formerly A. albitarsis B

[DQ076210-DQ076215; AY956297/AY956298; U92333],
A. marajoara [DQ076216/DQ076217-DQ076221/
DQ076225; AY956295/AY956296; U92334], A. deaneorum [DQ076226/DQ076229; AY956301/AY956302;
AF461751/AF461752], A. janconnae, [DQ076231/
DQ076232] and A. albitarsis F [DQ228314/DQ228315].
Genealogical trees were estimated using the concatenated (white + COI) data set. ITS2 sequences were
excluded from these analyses because of relatively limited sample size. Maximum Parsimony trees were generated in PAUP*, with one hundred replicates of a
heuristic search performed with an initial random stepwise addition of sequences and TBR branch swapping.
Branch support was estimated from 1,000 replicates of a
bootstrap search. Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was
performed with Mr. Bayes version 3.1 [56,57], partitioned by gene, using the model of nucleotide substitution (TPM3uf+G and TIM1+I) that best fit the white
gene and COI respectively, determined with jModelTest
[58,59]. The settings were two simultaneous, independent runs of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
for 4 million generations, sampling every 1,000 generations with a ‘burnin’ of 25%. The outgroup A. albimanus
in the Albimanus Section of Nyssorhynchus (unpublished sequence) was chosen based upon its phylogenetic
position in Sallum et al [60]. Estimates of time to coalescence were calculated for the COI fragment only and
compared using θS values [61] and BEAST [62].
Genetic variation

Genetic structure of two lineages was examined by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), a method of estimating population variance directly from molecular data,
using Arlequin version 3.1.1 [63]. In addition, spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), version 1.0 [64]
was used to cluster the 488-bp COI sequence data into
genetically and geographically homogeneous populations.
SAMOVA generates F statistics (FSC, FST, FCT) using the
AMOVA approach, into K groups to maximize the
between group variation. SAMOVA estimates were computed for K = 2-13 with 1,000 simulated annealing steps
from each of 100 sets of initial starting conditions.
A comparison of the pairwise divergences calculated
by DnaSP between COI lineages using the 648-bp 5’ end
and the 488-bp 3’ end tested the utility of the Folmer
region and the 3% species threshold using 10 to 13 individuals from each lineage, three closely related taxa and
an outgroup (Anopheles darlingi). Anopheles darlingi is
more appropriate than A. albimanus for sister taxa comparisons as both it, and A. marajoara, are in the Argyritarsis Section [65]. A species screening threshold (SST)
[66] may be more appropriate and can be calculated as
10× the mean intraspecific variation for a group [67].
The standard sequence threshold was calculated and

McKeon et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:271
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/271

examined for Nyssorhynchus using 4-58 archived GenBank sequences for known species.
Population structure and demographic history

A statistical parsimony network estimated genealogical
relationships among COI haplotypes with a 93% sequence
identity and 95% identity for each of the nuclear markers
using TCS 1.13 [68]. Homoplasy in all networks was
resolved using the algorithm estimation rules in Crandall
and Templeton [69].
The differentiation and polymorphism statistics for
COI sequences by species or lineage and locality were
computed in DnaSP, Version 4.0 [70], and the hypothesis of strict neutrality was examined using the statistics
DT [71], D and F [72], and R2 [73] which are based on
the frequencies of segregating sites, and Fu’s F S [74],
based on the haplotype distribution. Tajima’s D and
both Fu and Li’s D* and F* are the most effective tests
to detect background selection, whereas Fu’s FS and R2
are among the most powerful tests to detect population
expansion [73]. All neutrality tests were calculated using
DnaSP, Version 4.0 or MEGA version 3.1 [75].
The mismatch distribution (simulated in Arlequin) is a
frequency distribution of the observed number of

Page 4 of 13

pairwise nucleotide differences. The shape of the distribution is highly informative and able to differentiate
between a population expansion and equilibrium [76],
whereas the smoothness (raggedness statistic) distinguishes the fit of the empirical data to the model [77].
Statistically significant differences between observed and
simulated distributions were evaluated with the sum of
square deviations (SSD) to reject the hypothesis of
demographic expansion [78].

Results
Phylogenetic relationship

The estimated MP and BI trees, each with 42 parsimoniously informative sites, indicated two distinct lineages
of A. marajoara with varying levels of support (Figure 1).
The more derived lineage 1 remains ambiguous (only
moderate support, 0.66 and 52%); however it does have
the broadest distribution and contains samples from near
(~56 km) the type locality on Marajó Island, Pará state,
Brazil [79]. Lineage 2, in contrast, is more restricted
geographically and has higher support (1.00 and 89%,
Figure 1). The relatively low BI branch support (0.66) for
A. marajoara lineage 1 coupled with the moderate support among some of the subdivisions suggests this lineage

is paraphyletic and that haplotypes that would otherwise
increase lineage support are missing (extinct or not
sampled). Within both lineages, smaller subdivisions, not
related to geography, were apparent between the haplotypes that are separated by seven mutations in lineage 1
(between haplotypes 11 and 13) and 10 mutations in lineage 2 (haplotypes 48 and 49), illustrated in the network
(Figure 2).
The estimated time to coalescence for the two COI
lineages was obtained using the equations, θs = 2Neμ,
[29] and 4Ne = years since coalescence [80]. Based upon

Page 5 of 13

the 488-bp fragment, θs is 7.530 (SD = 1.857). Therefore, the estimate of the time to coalescence is 232,476 384,716 years ago, in the Pleistocene. A similar estimate
using BEAST, the standard arthropod mtDNA mutation
rate of 2.3% per million years [81], an applied HKY
model with gamma distribution assuming constant size
and a relaxed molecular clock, yielded an estimate of
3.07 mya. The discrepancy between coalescent estimates
is likely due to the 10 generations per year that is factored into the Walton equation [29]. Although the
incorporation of fossil calibration points can generate

more reliable divergence estimates [82], no data were
available because the mosquito fossil record is too
recent and rare [83].
Genetic variation

The between lineage variance for the Folmer region of
the two lineages of A. marajoara (2.94%) is marginally
below the 3% BOLD threshold. However, it is comparable to among species comparisons within the Albitarsis
Complex (e.g., A. albitarsis s.s. vs. A. oryzalimnetes,
2.64%; Additional file 2). The 3’ end of the COI (above
diagonal, Additional file 2) is less conserved, resulting in
higher estimates of divergence. Among closely related
Nyssorhynchus spp. (Table 2), the average intraspecific
variation is 0.0116, and suggests that a SST of 11.6%
might suffice within this subgenus. However, this estimate is limited as only 7 out of 32 currently recognized
species [65] were available. Intraspecific nucleotide differences among Nyssorhynchus species were consistently
less than 2%, indicating that the higher estimate (0.021)
of combined A. marajoara lineages likely represents an
overlooked species complex.
AMOVA indicated that 61.94% (p = 0.0000) of the variance was explained by between-group variation of A.
marajoara lineages 1 and 2. SAMOVA analysis, providing resolution for lineage 1 only, defined two groups
that correspond to northeastern and western Amazonia,
with 61.36% regional variation (Figure 3). Several COI
haplotypes were found in both the northeastern and
western populations of lineage 1 indicating at least some
gene flow across the geographic barrier. High variation,
especially between lineages 1 and 2, and between geographic populations in both COI and white genes, is
strongly supported by population differentiation statistics, although the GST values were not significantly different (Table 3). Furthermore, the Kt values were much
greater for the COI gene (11.9 and 6.96), compared with
the white gene (1.0).

Population structure and demographic history

Analysis of mitochondrial data from 294 samples among
seven riverine and seven non-riverine localities in Amazonas, Pará, and Amapá states, Brazil (Figure 3) led to
the discovery of two co-occuring, but distinct A. marajoara lineages that are unable to be connected using statistical parsimony (Figure 2). Therefore, a median
joining network that uses alternate algorithms to remove
homoplasy was conducted and indicated that a minimum of 13 mutational steps separate the lineages,
shown in Figure 2. Seven fixed mutations were estimated between lineages based on DnaSP. Additionally,
A. oryzalimenetes was identified from Itaituba and from
Macapá, a new record (Figure 3).
COI haplotypes were detected (Figure 2). Of the A.
marajoara haplotypes, 26 (44.8%) were shared among
localities, and 32 (55.2%) were unique (Additional file
3). The most common haplotypes were 1 (n = 16), 2 (n
= 26), 3 (n = 20) and 5 (n = 78) of A. marajoara lineage
1, and haplotypes 43 (n = 9) and 46 (n = 9), 50 (n =
32), and 56 (n = 11) of A. marajoara lineage 2 (Figure
2). There was a relatively high proportion of singletons
(32, 55.17%) in the A. marajoara lineages combined,
with 24/42 for lineage 1, and 9/16 for lineage 2. Overall,
both A. marajoara lineages were indicative of a category
II pattern [26] characterized by pronounced genetic
gaps between some branches and the co-distribution of
principle lineages over a wide area, which could theoretically arise in a species with large evolutionary N e
(effective population size) and high gene flow. Lineage 1
contains a star shaped node surrounding haplotype 5,
with short branches and an excess of singleton mutations, predominantly from the northeastern localities,
which suggests a demographic expansion, background
selection or selective sweep [74,84]. In contrast, lineage
2 indicates balancing selection with its longer branches,
missing haplotypes and near equal distribution of shared
haplotypes and single mutations, consistent with a signal

gene and ITS2) containing comparative numbers of specimens of both COI-defined lineages identified a single
A. marajoara lineage (Figure 4A, B). Haplotype clusters
(Figure 4A) correspond primarily to northeastern and
western populations with a few outliers including haplotype L and two individuals in haplotype A. Both lineages
retained the 4 th intron in the white gene, which is
absent from all other Albitarsis Complex members [11].
Additionally, the ITS2 length was identical (361-bp) in
all sequences, independent of the lineage. Copy number
in microsatellite regions at positions 118 (GT) and 273
(GA) and the 2-bp indel at position 271 were not congruent with either lineage or geography, but consistent

with findings by Li and Wilkerson [20,42]. Genetic polymorphism analyses of the COI sequences indicated that
haplotype diversity was greater among lineage 1 populations, whereas lineage 2 localities exhibited slightly
higher nucleotide diversity (Additional file 3). In lineage
1, there was greater diversity among the western localities (1-8), compared to northeastern Amazon (9-14).
The white gene exhibited lower nucleotide diversities
overall compared to COI, and some differences in diversity between populations, particularly in Tartarugalzinho
(locality 12), where haplotypes D and T are present,
separated by 11 mutation steps (Additional file 4). Moderate nucleotide diversity in the COI data coupled with
the single A. marajoara lineage detected with the white
gene may reflect ancestral polymorphism as a result of
co-occurence and haplotype mixing [85].
The high COI haplotype diversity combined with relatively low nucleotide diversity in both lineages (Additional file 3) suggests a population bottleneck followed

by an expansion. The negative values for three neutrality
tests in lineage 1 (Table 4) may reflect an excess of rare
polymorphisms consistent with either positive selection
or an increase in population size, although only one of
these tests (Fs) was significant. In contrast, the positive
values in lineage 2 indicate an excess of intermediatefrequency alleles in a population, which can result from
either balancing selection or population bottlenecks
[86]. Only the northeastern subdivision of lineage 1
revealed strong support for a population expansion
event. The comparison between the northeastern and
western populations within lineage 1 supports the
SAMOVA findings of a geographic barrier, depicted in
Figure 3.
The mismatch distribution model for sudden expansion was marginally significant for both lineages. Both
exhibited a bi-modal distribution (Figure 5) with a complete separation and significant raggedness values, suggesting constant population size [87]. However, an
alternative interpretation would be that there were two
expansions [88] dated to the Pleistocene (lineages 1 and
2, 142,203 (3,678-220,163) and 114,713 (8,545-230,635)
ybp, respectively). The lineage 1 northeastern population
(Figure 2) expanded more recently, approximately 5,000
years ago, during the Holocene.

Discussion
The combined sequence results support divergence in
A. marajoara depicting separate lineages, distinct from
A. janconnae. The more ancestral lineage 2 appears
monophyletic, whereas moderate substructure within
lineage 1 suggests paraphyly. Nuclear markers, however,
consistently depict a single A. marajoara lineage.

Discrepancies between mtDNA and nDNA are not
enough to refute speciation, for example the newly
recognized species A. janconnae and A. marajoara form
a single lineage using the protein coding nuclear white
gene and ITS2 sequences [20,21], but complete COI
sequences [10] indicate monophyly of each taxon, and
morphometrics analysis depicts A. janconnae as a separate taxon in the complex [22]. Nuclear mutation rates
are generally slower than mitochondrial ones [89], but
see Hellberg [90], thus the lack of divergence detected
in the nuclear sequences in A. marajoara in the present
study suggests either the differentiation is restricted to
the mitochondrial genome, or it is recent and not yet
visible in the nuclear genome. Given that lineage 1 has a
broader distribution and includes samples from near the
type locality, lineage 1 would be more appropriately
named A. marajoara s.s. The status of lineage 2 is not
yet resolved; it may be a new cryptic species belonging
to the complex as suggested by Wilkerson et al. (2005)
from Manaus, Brazil [41] and confirmed by JF Ruiz
(personal communication) using the COI barcode region
of the Albitarsis subgroup across South America.
Genetic variation between lineages was explained by
61.94% between group differences. Pairwise divergence
estimates based on the 488-bp fragment confirmed
3.82% divergence between lineages (Table 3), which is
comparable to the values observed among well-known
Albitarsis Complex species (for example, 3.52% between
A. albitarsis s.s and A. oryzalimnetes). These data may
support cryptic or incipient speciation [91]. The effectiveness of the Folmer region and the BOLD threshold
of 3% are questionable for at least some species of Nyssorhynchus because there is only moderate support
between known species A. oryzalminetes and A. albitarsis s.s. If the average intraspecific variation of the Folmer
region for the subgenus (11.6%) is used as a species
threshold, the pairwise divergences of all sister taxa
(including A. darlingi and A. albimanus) do not exceed
this standard. Such a high SST is likely to result in false
negatives even among recognized species, therefore
separate intraspecific values and interspecific divergences were examined for resolution, where intraspecific
COI variation was <2% and interspecific variation was
between 6-10%, comparable to other anopheline species
differences [[92,93], unpublished data].
Pleistocene divergence in mtDNA has also been
detected for a wide range of insect taxa across Central
and South America, including L. longipalpis [94], H.
erato [81], R. prolixus [95], and mosquitoes A. darlingi
[53] and A. albimanus [85] suggesting climatic changes
may be a common force driving Neotropical speciation.
Pleistocene divergence coupled with paleoclimate
records of the Miocene describing the world as warmer
and exhibiting greater humidity and precipitation [96];

[97] support the more ancestral depiction of lineage 2.
Pleistocene climatic changes, including lower temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide levels than those
exhibited today, may have contributed to the divergence
of lineage 1 [98,99].
Lineages co-occur along the Amazon River with no
obvious species diversity gradients, although data indicate several “high diversity localities” including Santarém, which is a recognized hotspot. However, this may
be an artefact resulting from the relative logistical ease

of access to these localities and the many studies that
have been conducted there [100]. The geographic barrier detected within A. marajoara lineage 1 is in the
same region as the mtDNA divisions between northeastern and central western Amazon populations in A. darlingi [101], A. nuneztovari [102] and Atta species ants
[103]. With similar distributions and geographic boundaries noted in both mosquitoes and ants, it seems unlikely that the boundary is the result of dispersal abilities.
The detection of shared haplotypes in the present study
on both sides of the barrier indicates a permeable
boundary, suggesting the more geographically restricted
lineage 2 may be an artefact of incomplete sampling, or
perhaps a result of climate variation.

Page 10 of 13

Climate, particularly rainfall, is a strong descriptor of
broad-scale species-richness patterns in the tropics [104].
Vasconcelos et al [105] noted a restricted geographic
distribution of ants in the western part of the basin, which
to a great extent reflected a west to east gradient
of decreasing rainfall. Additionally, Sombroek [106]
explained an intricate pattern of continuous rainfall in the
western interior of the Amazon, in contrast to the coasts,
with a pronounced dry season containing a dry belt or
corridor occurring near Rio Jari, Amapá state (near the
SAMOVA barrier for A. marajoara lineage 1). Miocene
flooding [103] and subsequent Pleistocene climatic events
may explain the porous nature of the barrier.
Recent deforestation and habitat fragmentation resulting from the 1967 initiation of the single largest forest
plantation in Latin America, an agro-forestry venture
known as the Jari project [107] in northern Brazil could
have contributed to an increase in A. marajoara abundance in this region. Clearing of forest, in combination
with an increase in human and domestic animal host
abundance, may have led to an A. marajoara population
increase in Macapá, the capital of Amapá -state, in
northeastern Amazonian Brazil [15].
Among the riverine localities, the hypothesis of sudden population expansion could not be rejected,
although the mismatch distributions were smooth and
bimodal for both lineages. The reduced genetic variation
of A. marajoara lineage 1 in the northeastern Amazon
region coupled with the unimodal distribution and the
star-like pattern of the haplotype network are consistent
with a rapid population expansion in the northeast.
A. marajoara tends to breed in marshy sunlit pools and
may have expanded into the northeast where savannah
and agricultural habitats would be favorable. The population expansion occurred during the Holocene, possibly
indicating a recent colonization. This explanation is supported by the expansion of savannah during periods of
fire-associated drought and extinction-recolonization of
rainforest tree populations in lowland areas during the
Holocene [108-110]. Moderate gene flow in lineage 1
may hamper local vector control in Amazonas, Pará and
Amapá states because of potential reinvasion and the
spread of insecticide resistant genes [111].

Conclusions
Anopheles marajoara is an important vector in the
savannah areas of South America [13], and with some of
the highest incidences of malaria occurring in the states
of Pará and Amapá [14,15,112] it is likely that A. marajoara will continue to increase its regional importance
in malaria transmission. Additional studies will be
needed to determine whether the subdivision resulting
in the two co-occurring lineages in A. marajoara is
strictly the product of genetic variation and evolutionary

processes impacted by geographical barriers, or variations in ecology and behaviour that may have lead to
niche divergences and microallopatry [113-116]. If both
lineages are implicated as vectors, the characteristics of
their breeding sites, their behaviours and their migration
history could be used to predict changes in malaria
transmission patterns in the Amazon basin [15] and
other endemic regions, and provide useful information
for targeted vector control strategies.
