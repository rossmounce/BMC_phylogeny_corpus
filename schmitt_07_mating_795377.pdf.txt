Abstract
Background: In simultaneous hermaphrodites with copulation and internal fertilization it is often
unclear whether reciprocal sperm exchange results from the unconditional willingness of both
partners to donate and receive sperm, or whether it follows from a more controlled process such
as conditional reciprocal sperm exchange, i.e. sperm trading. While in some sea slugs mating is
assumed to be based on sperm trading, it seems to be unconditional in others. Here, we describe
the unusual mating behaviour of Elysia timida, a small sacoglossan, focussing on indications for
conditional reciprocity.
Results: E. timida shows an as yet unique combination of a long series of hypodermic transfers
followed by a short phase with standard insemination into a female genital aperture. Hypodermic
transfer takes place in the form of repeated small injections into the dorsal surface of the partner,
interrupted by synchronised circling movements. In the final mating phase sperm is transferred into
the female genital aperture in a short period. In both phases the two mating individuals show a high
degree of transfer symmetry and synchrony. While total duration and number of transfers were
balanced within pairs, they varied significantly between pairs. Furthermore, looking at individual
hypodermic transfers within pairs, reciprocal transfers lasted longer than unilateral transfers. Final
sperm transfers were always reciprocal except for two cases which also diverted from the usual
pattern in ways that were suggestive of a conflict over reciprocity.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that individual mating decisions in E. timida depend on what the
partner does, indicating conditional reciprocity. If hypodermic transfers also involve the transfer of
sperm (which remains to be confirmed), this system represents an up to now unique transition
stage between hypodermic and standard insemination, both of which are widespread in this group
of sea slugs, but never have been observed to co-occur within the same species.

Background
Mating conflicts in hermaphrodites
Ad hoc flexibility in sex roles and sex allocation is unique
to simultaneous hermaphrodites. Possessing two sexes,
however, potentially generates conflicts of interests
between mating partners since both might prefer to mate
either in the male role or in the female role [1-9]. This may
in turn lead to different degrees of interest compatibility
[9,10].

In gonochoric species, male reproductive success is typically limited by access to unfertilised eggs while female
reproductive success is limited by resources to produce
eggs (Bateman's principle). This principle is assumed to
apply likewise to male and female functions in hermaphrodites [1,11,12]. If the reproductive success of the female
function is limited by the availability of resources for egg
production and not by the availability of allosperm
(sperm received from a donor), this may lead to a conflict
of interest between the sperm donor and the sperm
receiver regarding the use of sperm [1]. For example, most
if not all received sperm might be digested rather than be
used for fertilization [10]. In addition, if individuals mate
repeatedly as a female before egg fertilization, sperm from
different donors will compete for fertilization [6,12-15].
Under these conditions, individuals should on the one
hand persuade their partners to mate with them, but on
the other hand suppress their willingness to remate later,
adding to the mating conflict.
Repeated mating and sperm competition in combination
with sperm digestion have been predicted to lead to
increased male investment [16], at least under certain conditions [17]. The resulting high costs associated with
sperm donation may explain why many internally fertilising hermaphrodites apparently hesitate to donate sperm
and prefer mutual insemination [18]. Conditional reciprocity of sperm transfer, i.e. sperm trading, was first
described for the opisthobranch Navanax inermis [19,20].
In N. inermis mating partners repeatedly alternate the
female and the male role [19,20]. This results in balanced
overall durations of sperm transfer between partners during a mating sequence, consistent with sperm trading
[21]. The only experimental evidence for sperm trading
thus far has been obtained from the sea slug Chelidonura
hirundinina by controlling a slugs' ability to donate sperm
without affecting other aspects of mating behaviour [22].
Here, focal animals more rapidly abandoned partners that
did not transfer sperm.
Observing bilateral insemination does not suffice to infer
conditionality since reciprocity can also result from a
mutual, but unconditional willingness to donate sperm
[5]. Several studies concluded against sperm trading
despite explicit reciprocal insemination [23-25]. In a

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/17

study of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis reciprocal sex role
alternation only occurred when both mating partners had
been isolated, which led the authors to question conditional reciprocity as a per se explanation for reciprocal
mating patterns [26]. In addition, body size influences
insemination durations and the degree of reciprocity in at
least three different sea slug species [15,27,28] which
makes the question of conditional reciprocity even more
complicated.
The present study first describes the as yet unique mating
behaviour of Elysia timida. We then examine whether
exchange between partners is balanced and if there are
indications for conditional reciprocity.
Mating behaviour in opisthobranchs
Opisthobranch sea slugs are simultaneous hermaphrodites and possess complex reproductive systems for internal cross-fertilization [29-33]. Allosperm resorption has
been shown to occur in several species [29,34] and can be
assumed to be widespread due to the presence of a gametolytic gland in most groups [31]. Sea slugs typically
donate and receive sperm reciprocally in a head-to-tail
cross position. Partners face in opposite directions with
their genital apertures on the front right body sides
opposed and their penes mutually inserted [31,35]. In
addition to this standard insemination mode a variety of
alternatives exist. Some species form mating chains
[31,35-37], alternate sex roles [19-22], or transfer sperm
via externally attached spermatophores [31,38]. Hypodermic insemination, in which sperm is injected through the
partner's body surface, is also widespread, particularly
among the Sacoglossa [15,34,39-43]. Many species with
hypodermic insemination have developed special penis
armature, such as a sharp stylet [41]. In some species,
sperm is injected through the body surface directly into
the receptive organs while in others injection can take
place anywhere into the partner's body [15,39-43]. Hypodermic insemination can be unilateral or bilateral in the
same species [15,39,42]. Hypodermic insemination may
also occur in species without penial armature [39,42,43].
Thus far, sea slugs have been observed to mate either by
hypodermic injections or by standard insemination into
the female aperture. The mating behaviour of E. timida is
very unusual in that it combines standard insemination
with a preceding phase of hypodermic injections, of
which the function is as yet unclear. The only currently
known example of such a combination stems from the
gastropterid sea slug Siphopteron quadrispinosum, which
uses a bipartite penis to hypodermically inject prostate
secretions using its stylet-bearing branch before using its
other branch for regular insemination [44].

Study organism
E. timida is a small (< 2 cm) sea slug (Sacoglossa, Elysiidae) that lives in shallow, protected Mediterranean bays
on rock surfaces that are covered with its food alga Acetabularia acetabulum [45-47]. Animals are opaque white with
green lateral stripes and a mostly green colouration of the
parapodia's upper surfaces stemming from endosymbiontic chloroplasts. Head, pericardial prominence and the
parapodia's lower sides show a variable pattern of bright
red spots, which allows individual recognition. E. timida
has spatially separated male and female genital openings.
The penis is positioned on the right side of the head,
directly underneath the right eye. It is transparent and
elongated during mating, allowing observation of sperm
or fluid transfer with a stereo-microscope. The female
aperture is located at the frontal base of the right parapodium. Transfers are predominantly reciprocal, sometimes
unilateral.

Results
Description of mating sequences
The observed E. timida individuals initiated mating after
meeting head-to-head (N = 24 pairs). In one additional
pair, individuals met sideways, but instantly moved into a
head-to-head position. Subsequently, individuals
stopped gliding and touched each other with their head
and elongated rhinophores (Fig. 1A). These first contacts
lasted 21.1 ± 33.2 s (range: 1 – 155 s, N = 25, data per
pair). From this position the two slugs bent their heads
slightly to the left and slowly moved forward along the
right side of the partner until reaching the base of the partner's right parapodium. In this way mating partners took
up the typical head-to-tail mating position (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2)

A

Twenty-two out of 25 pairs started penis protrusion
immediately and simultaneously during initial head-tohead contact or first copulation position. The remaining
pairs everted their penis soon after initial contact. In
twenty pairs both partners kept their penis everted
throughout the complete mating sequence.
When partners had taken up copulation position, they
either stayed in position for a hypodermic transfer
attempt (Fig. 1C, Video 2) or they started to circle (Fig.
1D, Fig. 3, see below).
If starting a hypodermic transfer attempt, partners
stretched their penis up to one third of their body length
to reach the dorsal surface of their partner (Fig. 1C). The
movable penis tip touched the partner's dorsal surface in

an attempt to insert. In 25.9% of insertion attempts the
penis transmitted a white substance on or into the dorsal
surface of the partner. Substance transfer by hypodermic
injection lasted from 3 s to 32.25 min ( x = 6.47 ± 7.63
min, N = 44 individuals). Several such hypodermic transfers occurred per mating sequence ( x = 2.68 ± 2.30,
range: 0 – 9, N = 50 individuals).
After each hypodermic injection the penis was withdrawn
from the partner (but as a rule not fully retracted) and
individuals started a synchronous, stereotypic circling
movement in a counter-clockwise direction (Fig. 1D, Fig.
3, Video 1). If only one individual started circling, its partner usually responded by circling as well (Fig. 1E and Fig.
3, Video 1). Most (81%) circling phases involved a single
circle only (1.06 ± 3.04 min, N = 50 individuals). In the
other cases individuals kept circling, in one case up to
40.8 min. After resuming copulation position, a new
hypodermic transfer attempt was started (Fig. 1B–C).
Transfer attempts and circling movements were alternated
1 to 34 times during a single mating sequence ( x = 12.7
± 6.6, N = 25 pairs).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/17

Hypodermic injections
The main injection area was the anterior part of the partner's inner parapodial dorsal surface including the posterior part of the pericardial prominence and its
surroundings up to the frontal third of the dorsal surface
(Fig. 4). In 123 out of 132 cases transfer by hypodermic
injection occurred in this area. In four cases transfer region
was the partner's head and in another four the anterior lateral side of the partner's right parapodium. The substance
transferred by hypodermic injections could not be isolated as it was either injected directly or dispersed into the
water.

Although E. timida shows hypodermic injection, no special penis armature in the form of a stylet or hook(s) was
found on inspection with SEM and stereo-microscopy.
One animal that had received four hypodermic transfers
notum was fixed 5 h after copulation. On inspection with
SEM four bumps were identified in the main insertion
area. An individual kept in isolation had a very smooth
notum without bumps. These observations confirm our
assumption that hypodermic injection results in the transfer of a substance.

The hypodermic injection and circling phase described
above represented the longer part of the mating sequence.
It was followed by a short final phase in 21 out of 25 matings. Here, individuals took up copulation position again,
but inserted their penis into the partner's female aperture
(Fig. 1G, Video 3). Mates inserted mutually and almost
simultaneously and transferred sperm in a short time
period ( x = 1.61 ± 0.75 min, range: 0.57 – 4.12 min,
measurements available for N = 41 individuals). Out of
the 21 matings with a final insemination phase 20 mating
sequences ended with a reciprocal final insemination.
Only one single mating ended with a unilateral final
insemination.
After reciprocal final sperm transfer slugs withdrew and
separated simultaneously, gliding off into opposite directions. Complete mating sequences lasted 42.9 ± 14.7 min
(range: 10.8 to 79.5 min, N = 25). After insemination and
separation a white blob of semen remained attached to
the outside of the female aperture. Investigation under a
microscope revealed that sperm had a simple thread-like
shape without a prominent head and showed vigorous
spiralling movement of the middle section. In structure
and movement the sperm of E. timida correspond strongly
to that described for E. patina [42].

The duration of final sperm transfer was also balanced
between partners but differed significantly between pairs
(Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 45.1, d.f. = 24, P = 0.006; Fig. 7), coinciding with the synchrony with which these transfers were
performed by both partners. The four matings in which
partners did not transfer sperm into the female aperture
occurred in pairs in which only one partner had transferred hypodermically while the other had not.
Conditional reciprocity?
As already indicated by within-pair symmetry in total
injection duration, individuals performed longer (or
shorter) single hypodermic injections when they received
more (or less) from their partner. To illustrate this effect,
unilateral and reciprocal hypodermic transfers were com-

Reciprocity
Fifty-two out of 80 hypodermic transfers were performed
reciprocally. Although not all hypodermic transfers were
reciprocal, the total duration of all hypodermic transfers
during a mating session was balanced between mates but
significantly different between pairs (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 =
46.4, d.f. = 24, P = 0.004; Fig. 5; see methods for rationale
behind this analysis). The same applies to the number of
hypodermic transfers (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 42.7, d.f. = 24,
P = 0.011; Fig. 6). Direct observation suggested that individuals transferred fluid at a constant rate; therefore the
amount received should be similar to the amount
donated.

pared within those 11 mating sequences where at least
one partner performed both a unilateral and a bilateral
transfer. From each of those pairs only one partner was
considered. In cases where both partners had at least one
unilateral transfer, we always used the individual with the
longest unilateral donation to obtain a conservative estimate. We then compared how long these individuals
donated hypodermically by unilateral versus bilateral
transfers during a mating sequence (Fig. 8). In all but one
case the average duration of single bilateral hypodermic
transfers per individual during a mating sequence was
higher than the average duration of single unilateral transfers (Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, z = -2.49, P = 0.013).
This suggests a preference for reciprocal transfers as well as
the presence of a control mechanism to check what the
partner does.
There are also possible indications for conditional reciprocity in the final mating phase. Individuals often
touched the partner's female aperture with their penis several times before final sperm transfer and seemed to
"wait" for the partner to react reciprocally. Final sperm
transfer was reciprocal and approximately simultaneous
except for two cases. Here, only one partner transferred
sperm, which was followed by an exceptionally long circling phase of about 30 min. This is in contrast to the
immediate separation after reciprocal sperm transfer. In
one of these two cases, partners finally transferred recipro-

Discussion
Penial armature
Although E. timida performs hypodermic injections, special penial armature could not be detected externally. In a
comparative study on penial armature in different
sacoglossans it has been reported that penial stylets –
when not in use – are completely housed in a pocket at the
tip of the penis [41]. Although a penis stylet is common
among sacoglossans, it is considered an apomorphy [48]
and to be absent from species of the genus Elysia [45,4850]. At least three species of Elysia perform exclusively
hypodermic insemination despite the fact that their penis
is unarmed [39,42,43]. The only exception is E. patina,
which possesses a very small and thin cuticular stylet at
the tip of the penis and also inseminates hypodermically
[42]. Given that we have never seen any indication of a
stylet, we assume for now that the penis in E. timida is
indeed unarmed as is typical for Elysia spp. It is not known
how hypodermic transfer is achieved without the aid of
penial armature. Possibilities considered are enzymatic
attack [51] or turgor pressure [39].
Why hypodermic transfers?
Assuming that the hypodermic transfers are functional
and not a phylogenetic relic, we suppose that the injected
substance induces an effect in the receiver that is in the
interest of the sperm donor. For the time being, we must
consider two alternatives regarding the composition of
the fluid that is injected: (1) male prostate fluid only, or
(2) semen, consisting of sperm and prostate fluid.

cally and then separated immediately. Additionally, both
pairs displayed repeated, alternating penis retractions and
protrusions while circling, which was never the case in
other matings. This aberrant behaviour suggests a conflict
over failed reciprocity.

than by unilateral transfers.

From the perspective of the sperm donor, prostate fluids
can represent a manipulating or stimulating cocktail that
changes the physiology of the receiver in the interest of the
sperm donor [5,52-54]. In a pre-insemination context, the
injections might serve to manipulate the partner to accept
the less desirable sex role, as seems to be the case in the
gastropterid sea slug Siphopteron quadrispinosum [44]. In E.
timida, pre-insemination manipulation may be required
as a part of a ritualised courtship aiming at synchrony and
reciprocity. In a post-insemination context, prostate secretions can possibly influence sperm usage and increase the
relative paternity of the sperm donor as is achieved by the
love dart in Helicid snails [55,56]. Similar mechanisms
are likely to exist in other hermaphrodites [5,33]. It is
important to stress that – even if hypodermic injection
may have evolved from a donor-specific benefit, we do
not exclude that receivers may receive some form of ben-

efit from being injected – as suggested by the "cooperative" and ritualised behaviour lacking signs of avoidance.
Hypodermic transfer may, however, also involve sperm
transfer. Support for this comes from the observation that
hypodermic insemination is widespread among sacoglossans [15,34,39-43], but transfer of fluid without sperm
has never been reported. In Alderia modesta it was shown
that hypodermic insemination anywhere in the body
leads to successful egg fertilization [15]. The copulation
position and insertion area described for Elysiasubornata,
which inseminates exclusively hypodermically [42], are
very similar to what we describe for the hypodermic transfers in E. timida. This similarity includes the position and
appearance of the bumps seen after hypodermic injection.
These observations lend further support to the possibility
that E. timida is unique in that it combines standard with
hypodermic sperm transfer. All the possibilities for stimulation and manipulation before and after sperm transfer
discussed above remain in effect under this scenario.
Conditional reciprocity
In opisthobranchs with one common genital papilla with
both female and male apertures that are crosswise
inserted, the anatomical conditions facilitate reciprocity.
A separation of the male and female aperture, as in
sacoglossans, may provide more scope for non-reciprocal
behaviour as genital contact at one "meeting point" does
not require genital contact at the other. Hypodermic copulation in E. maoria is reported to be sometimes reciprocal, sometimes non-reciprocal, which in non-reciprocal
cases often means that both partners have extended their
penis, but only one actually inserts and transfers [39]. This
is very similar to the hypodermic transfers in E. timida. The
hypodermic transfers in E. patina and E. subornata are also
sometimes non-reciprocal [42] and the same applies to
several other sacoglossans (e.g. [15,43]). Despite the possibility of unilateral transfers, E. timida showed extreme
synchrony and reciprocity between mating partners, with
much variation between pairs, but little within pairs.
These findings suggest that mating in E. timida follows a
form of conditional reciprocity. An experimental
approach, such as used by [22,24] is required to prove this
proposition.

If it is sperm that is injected hypodermically, it is important to stress that the pattern of sperm exchange is not
based upon alternating insemination as in Navanaxinermis [21] or Chelidonura hirundinina [22], but on repeated,
mostly simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfer is
one possible type of sperm trading [18], but has never
been described as a repeated process. Other unusual characteristics of E. timida mating behaviour such as slow
movement and circling may facilitate reciprocity. Altogether the mating behaviour of E. timida is the exact oppo-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/17

site of that of the "hit-and-run" species in which mating
individuals attempt to inseminate a partner quickly and
unilaterally [57]. E. timida partners rather seem to "sitand-wait" to assess the degree of synchrony and reciprocity they receive from their partner. A measure indicating
this hesitance is the long duration of the whole mating
sequence.

Conclusion
The mating behaviour of E. timida represents a hitherto
undescribed combination of repeated hypodermic injections and standard sperm transfer into a female genital
aperture. If the hypodermic injections transfer sperm, this
mating system could represent a transition between the
two insemination types and a key system to analyse the
evolution of insemination mechanisms.
Sexual behaviour was very synchronised and balanced
between partners, leading to a high degree of reciprocity.
The synchrony within pairs versus the differences between
pairs indicates that mates adapt their behaviour in
response to that of their partner. Hypodermic injections
were significantly shorter when performed unilaterally
than bilaterally. The final sperm transfers were always
reciprocal except for only two non-reciprocal cases in
which individuals reacted with aberrant behaviour indicating a conflict over non-reciprocity. Combined, our
findings suggest that mating in E. timida is likely to be
based on conditional reciprocity or sperm trading.

Methods
Collection and maintenance
E. timida was collected while SCUBA diving and snorkelling in 1–6 m depth at three sites in Banyuls sûr Mer,
France, in spring 2003. Slugs were kept in a 160 × 60 × 15
cm basin with running sea water and an ad libitum supply
of their food alga Acetabularia acetabulum. The basin was
enriched with stones and other algae. It was exposed to
natural sunlight through a window enabling animals to
photosynthesize by means of their endosymbiontic chloroplasts. Individuals were kept for up to 48 h before observation. Each pair was observed only once in order to
obtain independent data.
Behavioural observations
For each observation session two individuals were paired
in a 100 ml glass bowl and observed continuously
through a stereo-microscope. By choosing a partner of
approximately the same size, confounding effects resulting from size differences were minimized. Previously,
size-differences between mating partners have been
shown to influence mating behaviour in various opisthobranchs [14,15,28,58-62]. But since effects of relative size
were not the main focus of this study, we decided to

reduce potentially influencing factors by using sizeassorted pairs as in [24].

Each pair was observed until partners had separated completely after a successful mating sequence. From the first
five complete mating sequences an ethogram of the species specific mating behaviour was defined and a code for
behavioural elements was developed. The occurrence and
duration of these behavioural elements were recorded.
Data were obtained for 25 complete mating sequences
involving 50 different individuals.
Scanning electron microscopy
For morphological examination, individuals were fixed
with Bouin's solution and transferred after at least 24
hours in 70% ethanol. The fixed specimens were criticalpoint-dried with a Balzers CPD 020 critical-point drying
apparatus, prepared with gold in a Leitz-contrasting
device and scanned with a Hitachi S 530 scanning electron
microscope.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 10.0
and 11.5. Vreys & Michiels [63] discussed the difficulties
of analysing correlations of two hermaphroditic partners
by the application of regular correlation coefficients.
Instead they used a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) which tests for similarity within pairs relative to
between pairs [12,18,21]. Since the Levene test showed a
significant deviation from homogeneity of variances for
the variables that should be analysed, we used the
Kruskal-Wallis test in this study to compare variance
within pairs versus between pairs. Means are presented ±
standard deviation with number of cases and range.
Where necessary, data were averaged per pair prior to
analysis to avoid pseudoreplication. Data of behavioural
patterns varying in the two mating partners were analysed
per individual and labelled as such.

Authors' contributions
The present study was a part of VS's diploma project. VS
carried out the behavioural studies in Banyuls sûr mer,
performed the statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript. NA carried out histological analyses and assisted in
data interpretation and manuscript editing. NKM supervised the study, participated in its design and coordination and helped to analyze the data and draft the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
