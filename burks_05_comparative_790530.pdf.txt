Abstract
Background: Trans-translation releases stalled ribosomes from truncated mRNAs and tags
defective proteins for proteolytic degradation using transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). This small
stable RNA represents a hybrid of tRNA- and mRNA-like domains connected by a variable number
of pseudoknots. Comparative sequence analysis of tmRNAs found in bacteria, plastids, and
mitochondria provides considerable insights into their secondary structures. Progress toward
understanding the molecular mechanism of template switching, which constitutes an essential step
in trans-translation, is hampered by our limited knowledge about the three-dimensional folding of
tmRNA.
Results: To facilitate experimental testing of the molecular intricacies of trans-translation, which
often require appropriately modified tmRNA derivatives, we developed a procedure for building
three-dimensional models of tmRNA. Using comparative sequence analysis, phylogeneticallysupported 2-D structures were obtained to serve as input for the program ERNA-3D. Motifs
containing loops and turns were extracted from the known structures of other RNAs and used to
improve the tmRNA models. Biologically feasible 3-D models for the entire tmRNA molecule could
be obtained. The models were characterized by a functionally significant close proximity between
the tRNA-like domain and the resume codon. Potential conformational changes which might lead
to a more open structure of tmRNA upon binding to the ribosome are discussed. The method,
described in detail for the tmRNAs of Escherichia coli, Bacillus anthracis, and Caulobacter crescentus,
is applicable to every tmRNA.
Conclusion: Improved molecular models of biological significance were obtained. These models
will guide in the design of experiments and provide a better understanding of trans-translation. The
comparative procedure described here for tmRNA is easily adopted for the modeling the members
of other RNA families.

Background
Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), also known as 10Sa
RNA or ssrA RNA, is a hybrid of a tRNA-like domain
(TLD) and a mRNA-like domain (MLD) connected by a
variable number of pseudoknots [1]. TmRNA is a stable
and essential component of trans-translation, a qualitycontrol process that rescues ribosomes stalled on mRNAs
lacking stop codons. During trans-translation, ribosomes
switch from a defective mRNA (lacking its translation-termination signal) to the MLD of tmRNA. Because a stop
codon is provided by the tmRNA, the ribosomes can dissociate and recycle [2]. As an additional advantage, the
tandem translation of the two templates generates a
tagged polypeptide which is degraded by housekeeping
proteases [3,4].
For tagging, tmRNA has to be charged by aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases [5]. Assisted by protein SmpB, the charged
tmRNA is delivered to stalled ribosomes as a quaternary
complex with EF-Tu and GTP. Binding of tmRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by ribosomal protein S1, which interacts with the MLD and pseudoknots but not with the TLD
[6-9]. Recently, cryo-EM revealed the shape of the tmRNA
associated with SmpB and EF-Tu in its ribosome-bound
form [10]. Despite this significant progress, high-resolution structures as obtained by NMR and X-ray crystallography are unavailable and expected to be difficult to
obtain in the foreseeable future due to the relatively large
size and flexibility of the tmRNA.
In the present work we used a stepwise procedure for
arriving at high-resolution models for the entire tmRNA
molecule. First, 2-D structures were obtained by covariation analysis of a large number of tmRNA sequences. The
basepairing information was submitted to the ERNA-3D
modeling program [11] to build the helical sections.
Structural motifs of the loops and turns were identified in
SCOR [12], high-resolution data were extracted from
known structures, and these data were incorporated into
the models. Overall, significantly improved 3-D models
were obtained which will be useful to understand the role
of tmRNA in trans-translation. The described approach
can be adapted to obtain high-resolution models of the
members of other RNA families.

Results
Identification of tmRNA sequences
The tmRNA sequences were identified previously and subjected to comparative sequence analysis (CSA) as
described [1,13]. New tmRNA sequences were obtained
from the tmRNA website [14], through keyword searches
of the literature and GenBank [15], or BLAST [16,17], and
various genome sequencing projects. The new sequences
were examined iteratively as described in Materials and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/14

Methods to confirm tmRNA identity, remove sequence
duplications, and create a meaningful alignment.
New potential tmRNA sequences were maintained as a
preliminary alignment in BioEdit [18], separate EMBLformatted sequence files, and a HTML-formatted phylogenetic list. The sequences were ordered phylogenetically
using the information in the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) [19]. If the organism name was not listed in the
RDP, the sequence was placed next to its closest relative
using the NCBI Taxonomy resource [20].
Selection of tmRNA sequences
The new sequences were confirmed individually as tmRNAs by comparison with the closest relative using the
pairwise alignment feature of BioEdit [18]. If there was a
lack of obvious similarity, the sequence was inspected for
evidence of biological features such as the ability to form
a TLD and an open reading frame. Furthermore, the possibility of a two-part tmRNA was considered. A sequence
suspected to be a new tmRNA was investigated further by
CSA [13] as described in Materials and Methods.

Potential new sequences of the alpha-Proteobacteria and
some Cyanobacteria that were encoded in two separate
sections of their genes [21], were compared to the twopart tmRNA sequence from a closest relative for effective
comparison with the one-part tmRNAs. The 3'- and 5'ends of each section were determined by pairwise alignment to generate a single sequence. Each of the 20 new
two-part tmRNAs (14 sequences from alpha-Proteobacteria and six from Cyanobacteria) was subjected to this
rearrangement.
Comparative Sequence Analysis
Sequences were ordered phylogenetically using the RDP
[19] as a guide or by alignment with the closest relative.
Identical regions were aligned first. Subsequently, similar
regions were aligned using invariant positions as signposts. Regions of biological significance, such as the
resume and stop codons, were then considered. Finally,
common secondary structure features were used to align
regions that lacked primary structure similarity or biological features. Supported Watson-Crick basepairs and G-U
interactions were indicated in the alignment by uppercase
letters. Gaps were introduced to account for differences in
sequence length and to avoid the alignment of dissimilar
regions.

Secondary structure was determined using covariation
analysis as described [13] (see also Materials and Methods). The alignment was examined to identify compensatory base changes (CBCs) and other covariations. The
numbers of CBCs and mismatches between the alignment
columns were counted. CBCs provided positive evidence

The tRNA-like domain (TLD), mRNA-like domain (MLD), and the four pseudoknots pk1 to pk4 are shown on the top. Other features peculiar to a
phylogenetic group are in the right column. White fields indicate the presence, dashes the absence of a feature. Numbers suggest the following
structural features: (1) certain Cyanobacteria lack these pseudoknots. (2) One-chain cyanobacterial tmRNAs contain two smaller tandem
pseudoknots named pk4a and 4b. (3) The tmRNAs of some species in this group consist of two basepaired molecules [14, 21]. (4) The genus
Ricketsia and its relatives lack pk2. (5) pk4 of the alpha-Proteobacteria has been reduced to a single helix (named helix 11). (6) Some species in this
group contain an additional helix (helix 6d).

for the existence of a basepair; mismatches provided negative evidence. If the number of compensatory base
changes was two times or greater than the number of mismatches, the basepair was considered supported. If a basepair was invariant, no evidence for or against its existence
could be gained from CSA. A basepair was considered specific to a particular phylogenetic group if it was proven
only in that group.
Quality control
To check for the proper assignment of basepairs, the alignment was sent through an automated pipeline of programs from RNAdbTools [22]. The output was inspected
visually and corrections were made manually using the
BioEdit program [18]. The revised alignment was resubmitted to RNAdbTools, and the review process was
repeated until a satisfactory alignment was produced.
TmRNA alignment
The final alignment contained a total of 274 tmRNA
sequences in 16 bacterial phylogenetic groups. A complete phylogenetic list is available at the tmRDB [23].
There was a substantial increase in the number of two-part
tmRNAs for a total of 27 sequences: 20 from alpha-Proteobacteria (20 tmRNAs), one mitochondrial tmRNA, and
six cyanobacterial tmRNAs. The nine organelle sequences
included one from a cyanelle, six from chloroplasts, one

from a plastid, and one from the Reclinomonas americana
mitochondrion. The typical tmRNA was about 350 nucleotides long. The R. americana mitochondrion tmRNA contained only 189 nucleotides and, since it appeared to lack
an ORF, may not be functional. Excluding this exception
and any partial tmRNAs, the tmRNA of Synechococcus species PCC7009 was the shortest (250 nucleotides), and the
longest was from Chlamydophila psittaci (425 nucleotides).
The tmRNA alignment is provided as additional files 1:

Secondary structure of tmRNA
The tmRNA secondary structure features were extracted
from the alignment and are listed in phylogenetic order in
Table 1. The representative secondary structure of
Escherichia coli tmRNA is shown in Figure 1. Secondary
structures of Bacillus anthracis and Caulobacter crescentus
are presented in as additional file 5: Banthracis2D.pdf and
additional file 6: Ccrescentus2D.pdf, respectively.
TLD (helices 1, 2a and 12)
Although a prominent feature of each tmRNA, the TLD
was relatively weakly supported by CSA due to a high
degree of sequence conservation. However, the structure

of this region is well established by experimental evidence
[24-26].
Helix 1 contained seven basepairs and was usually continuous with the exception of the Anabaena species tmRNA,
which contained an insertion in the 3'-portion of helix 1.
The first pair (1G-C359 in E. coli tmRNA) was conserved
with one exception in Alcaligenes eutrophus where there
was a 1U-C345 mismatch possibly due to a sequencing
error. The second (2G-C358,E. coli numbering, Figure 1)
and third pair (3G-U357) of helix 1 were invariant and
therefore neither supported nor disproved by CSA. The
identities of the bases involved in the fourth (4G-C356)
and fifth pair varied. The closing pair of helix 1 (7G-C353)
was conserved with the exception of a 7U-A388 pair the
Trichodesmium erythraeum tmRNA. The single-stranded
region between helices 1 and 2a ranged from ten in
Dehalococcoides ethenogenes to 13 nucleotides in one
Clostridium acetobutylicum sequence. A U-A basepair (U6
in chain A with A88 in chain B) was possible in the R.
americana mitochondrion tmRNA.
Helix 2a was equivalent to the anticodon stem of tRNA
and contained eight supported basepairs as well as a short
variable internal loop in the 5'half of the helix that
occurred in a few sequences (e.g. Caulobacter crescentus, see
additional file 6: Ccrescentus2D.pdf). The first position in
the helix was a conserved cytosine (C21 in E. coli) which
formed a weakly-supported basepair with the conserved
G333. The partial tmRNA from the chloroplast of Pavlova
lutheri contained a uracil in the first position, but no information regarding the 3'portion of helix 2a was available.
The T-loop and helix 12 were highly conserved, although
many sequences lacked information about helix 12 due to
primer annealing during PCR amplification. Helix 12 contained four strongly supported basepairs and a fifth conserved G-C pair (340G-C348 in E. coli; Figure 1). The
Dehalococcoides ethenogenes tmRNA had the potential to
form a sixth basepair in helix 12. Helix 12 was almost
always continuous, except for the tmRNA of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans which possessed four basepairs
and a mismatched U333 and C347. A 331-GG-332 preceded U333 in C. hydrogenoformans and followed the conserved 328-GAC-330. Therefore, U333 was unlikely to
pair. In the T-loop, the U341 and U342 (E. coli tmRNA)
seen in most sequences were replaced by two guanines in
the tmRNA from the R. americana mitochondrion (G79
and G80 in chainB) [21]. In the tmRNA from Caulobacter
crescentus, the nucleotide corresponding to U342 in E. coli
tmRNA was changed to G62 in chainB (see additional file
6: Ccrescentus2D.pdf).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/14

Helical sections 2b, 2c and 2d
Overall, sections 2b, 2c, and 2d were well supported. Sections 2a and 2b were separated by a variable loop ranging
from one to seven nucleotides in the 5'portion and from
one to nine nucleotides in the 3'portion. Sections 2b and
2c had the potential to form a continuously stacked helix
(e.g. in Chlamydophila psittaci tmRNA). Usually, a bulge of
two to six nucleotides separated helical sections 2c and 2d
(residues 309–311 in E. coli tmRNA, Figure 1). An
asymmetrical loop was present in some sequences (for
example, residues 40–41 in chainA, and 27–31 in chainB
of Caulobacter crescentus tmRNA, see additional file 6:
Ccrescentus2D.pdf). Helix 2d was the most conserved of
the three helical sections. The G43-U308 basepair (E. coli
numbering) in helix 2d was only weakly supported, conserved in most phylogenetic groups, but altered in the
Thermatogales, Cyanobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and
Gram-positive bacteria. A 46A-U334 pair was possible in
the Synechocystis species PCC6803 tmRNA.
Pseudoknot 1 (helices 3 and 4)
Pseudoknot 1 (pk1) was well supported. Of the three connecting regions, the two 5'-regions were very short (no or
only one residue) while the third was relatively long (one
to 11 residues). All pseudoknots in tmRNA followed the
same general design [27]. Most sequences contained helices 3 and 4, with the exception of the tmRNA from Oenococcus oeni and the partial sequence from the chloroplast
of Pavlova lutheri, both of which lacked helix 4 and thus
did not form a pseudoknot. Helix 3 usually contained five
basepairs. However, a sixth pair was possible in some
bacteria.

Helix 4 could be split into helicalsections 4a and 4b by a
bulge seen in 46 sequences (position57 in B. anthracis
tmRNA; see additional file 5: Banthracis2D.pdf) or an
internal loop seen in 52 tmRNA sequences. The adeninerich terminal loop between the downstream halves of helices 3 and 4 ranged in length from twoto13 nucleotides.
The mRNA-like region (MLD)
The MLD consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) preceding helix 5 and varied from 48 (Heliobacillus mobilis) to
126 nucleotides (Odontella sinensis chloroplast). The
resume codon usually coded for alanine, but for glycine in
30 sequences (e.g. Bacillus anthracis), aspartic acid in three
sequences (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis), arginine in two
uncultured species (FS1 and LEM2), serine in the uncultured species RCA1, and glutamic acid in Mycoplasma
pulmonis.

Although helix 5 was only weakly supported by CBCs,
recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments combined
with functional studies in vivo and in vitro [28] provide
strong evidence for its existence. One to three stop codons

Page 5 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2005, 6:14

were located within the helix 5 loop. A single UAA stop
codon was present in 157 sequences. UAG (17 sequences)
or UGA (10 sequences) were used less frequently. In 85
sequences there were two in-frame stop codons, where
UAA was always the first codon, followed by another UAA
(73 sequences), UAG (10 sequences) or UGA (2
sequences). Curiously, two sequences (Bacillus megaterium
and Chloroflexus aurantiacu) were found to contain three
tandem in-frame stop codons.
Pseudoknot 2 (helices 6 and 7)
Pseudoknot 2 was well supported and similar in overall
design to pk1. Helical sections 6b and 6c showed a potential to form a continuous helix in Thermotoga maritima. In
beta-Proteobacteria, 6b was replaced by a short hairpin6d
[1]. Helix 6d was observed also in three tmRNAs of the
gamma-Proteobacteria Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and
Francisella tularensis.
Pseudoknot 3 (helices 8 and 9)
Pseudoknot 3 was well supported but missing in Cyanobacteria and the organelles (Table 1). Helical sections 8a
and 8b were likely to be continuously stacked because a
single helix was present in some species such as Aquifex
aeolicus. The unusual purine-rich internal loop between
helical sections 8a and 8b was present in most gammaProteobacteria suggesting a special function.
Pseudoknot 4 (helices 10 and 11)
This feature was well supported and was similar in design
to the other tmRNA pseudoknots. Helical sections 10a
and 10b had the potential to stack because a single helix
was present in Prevotella intermedia. In some Cyanobacteria sequences, however, pk4 was replaced with two
smaller tandem pseudoknots.
Secondary structure prediction of the MLD
Because CSA was unable to determine secondary structure
for a large portion of the MLD, energy calculations were
carried out aimed to predict structure for the singlestranded portion of the open reading frame. The region
corresponding to residues 79–107 of E. coli tmRNA
(Figure 1) was extracted from the alignment. A representative alignment of 197 sequences was submitted to Mfold
[29]. Each sequence had the potential to form at least one
helix, designated "m" (see Figure 1, additional file 5:
Banthracis2D.pdf,
and
additional
file
6:
Ccrescentus2D.pdf). Two or more adjacent helices were
predicted for 17 sequences. The number of basepairs varied from two in Chloroflexus aurantiacus to ten in Mycoplasma pulmonis.

Secondary structures of three representative tmRNA
molecules
Secondary structures were determined for all sequences in
the alignment but only three were extracted, diagrammed,
and processed for 3-D modeling.
Secondary structure of E. coli tmRNA
The 363-nucleotide tmRNA of the gamma-Proteobacterium Escherichia coli represented the typical tmRNA containing the TLD, the MLD, and four pseudoknots (pk1 to
pk4) encompassing the pseudoknot domain (PKD). The
90-GCA-92 resume triplet coded for alanine. Two inframe UAA stop codons (positions 120–125) were located
within the terminal loop of helix 5 (Figure 1). Three basepaired regions (shown boxed) were only weakly supported by CSA. Helixm (residues 87–98) was predicted
only by energy calculations. A slightly different helix
involving residues 88–100 has been suggested by footprinting of E. coli tmRNA [30]. The evidence for the 112UA133 basepair was weak, but was included due to the possibility of extending helix 5 (Materials and Methods). Helical section 5a (residues 108–113 and 134–137) was
enlarged by the weakly supported 108G-C137, 110UA135 and 111U-G134. The 109C-G136 pair was disproved. In helix 10ab, the basepair between 256G-C275
was only weakly supported. Helix 10ab (residues 248–
256 and 274–283) could be extended by the boxed 257UG274 pair.
Secondary structure of Bacillus anthracis tmRNA
Overall, the secondary structure of Bacillus anthracis
tmRNA (see additional file 5: Banthracis2D.pdf) was similar to that of E. coli. One notabledifference was a bulged
uridine (U57) between helical sections 4a and 4b in pk1.
A three-basepair helixm was predicted. The resume triplet
(residues 89–91) coded for glycine, and the UAA stop
codon was located at residues 119–121. Two weakly-supported pairs (108C-G132 and 109U-A131) extended helical section 5a.
Secondary structure of Caulobacter crescentus tmRNA
Caulobacter crescentus tmRNA (additional file 6:
Ccrescentus2D.pdf) consisted of two chains, A and B, of
213 and 83 residues, respectively. The resume codon (82GCG-84 of chainA) coded for alanine and was followed
by a UAA stop codon at residues 121–123. Helical
sectionsm1 and m2 were predicted by energy calculations.
There was weak support for 5a (G109-U135 and 111CG133 in chainA), and the 106U-A138, 107U-A137, 108CG136, and 110C-G134 in chainA were disproved. The
pseudoknots were relatively small. Helix 11 corresponded
to the absent pk4 (residues 1–18 in chain B).

selected because this tmRNA is the subject of extensive
research. B. anthracis tmRNA was chosen as an example of
a tmRNA from a Gram-positive bacterium, and C. crescentus tmRNA was selected it represents a two-part tmRNA.
In order to create the initial models, the sequence and
basepairing information were entered into an ERNA-3D
input file to automatically generate A-form RNA for the
helices sections and specify the single-stranded regions
using ERNA-3D's algorithm [11]. Since ERNA-3D avoided
an XYZ coordinate system as reference for the user, the
manipulation of the model from the viewer's perspective
was simple and intuitive. The coordinates of each model
were saved in PDB format [31] for compatibility with
other molecular modeling programs. Motifs (listed in
Tables 2 to 4) were selected to model the loops and turns
of a particular tmRNA. ERNA-3D selection files were generated to define clusters and place the motif in 3-D without disturbance to the rest of the model. The 3-D cursor
box was used to manipulate a cluster in three-dimensional space, similar to the manipulation of a section of a
physical model.
Numerous high-resolution structures determined by NMR
or X-ray crystallography represented a rich source of
detailed information for defining biologically meaningful
motifs. The SCOR database [12] provided a way to find
suitabletemplates. In rare cases when a SCOR search for a

motif did not result in an acceptable match (e.g. motif 9,
Table 2), the nucleotides were positioned manually in
ERNA-3D. Otherwise, the coordinates were obtained
from the Protein Data Bank PDB [32], extracted using the
program Swiss-PDBViewer [33], and imported into
ERNA-3D. The source motif and the region to be modeled
were selected as separate clusters and aligned in three
dimensions using common features (usually a shared
basepair). Once superimposed, the coordinates of the residues in the source motif were copied onto the corresponding residues in the model. The template was then
deleted, leaving a biologically meaningful structure. The
backbone connections between the motif and the rest of
the model were inspected visually and, if needed, manual
adjustments were made to correct bond lengths and
tetrahedral angles involving the phosphorous atom at the
joint between the extracted motif and the helical structures generated by ERNA-3D.
As an example of the motif modeling process, the purinerich loop in E. coli pk3 (positions 204–206 and 223–225)
was constructed using a similar loop in the 30S ribosomal
subunit. First, the purine-rich loop was defined as motif
11a (Table 2), and used to search the SCOR database.
Positions 780–782 and 800–802 in the structure of the
Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit [34] were
found to conform to the motif. The 30S ribosomal subunit coordinates (1J5E.pdb in this case) were downloaded

from the PDB and displayed using Swiss-PDBViewer. The
coordinates of the loop and the closing basepairs were
extracted and inspected to confirm that the structure was
compatible. The clustered regions were aligned with the
ends of helical sections 8a and 8b at the basepairs 203UG226 and 207A-U222 of the E. coli model and 779CG803 and 783C-G799 of the template. Template positions 780-AAA-782 and 800-GUA-802 were then copied
onto 204-GGA-206 and 223-GAA-225 of the model. The
template was deleted and the bond lengths and angles
involving the atoms of the phosphates of residuesU203,
G222, A206, and U222 were adjusted.
In some instances, the tmRNA sequence alignment was
reinvestigated using ideas derived from the 3-D model.
For example, the alignments of pk1 in Bacillus anthracis
tmRNA and relatives was changed from a two nucleotide
bulge (56-AU-57) between helical sections 4a and 4b to a
more feasible and equally well supported one-nucleotide
bulge (U57, see additional file 5: Banthracis2D.pdf). The

alignment of helix 10 in pk3 in B. anthracis tmRNA and
relatives was altered from a 237C-A269 mismatch and an
asymmetrical loop (C239 and 266-GU-267) to a single
looped-out C269. The alignment of pk3 of Caulobacter
crescentus and relatives was changed from four basepairs
and a weakly supported fifth pair in helix 8 (between
174G-C196 of chainA) to the four basepair structure seen
in additional file 6: Ccrescentus2D.pdf. Information
about spatial neighborhoods as obtained from cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional testing of E.
coli tmRNA was introduced and is described in detail
below. All models were inspected visually for correct bond
angles and distances around the phosphorous atoms at
the joints between the extracted motifs and the helical
regions generated by ERNA-3D. The coordinates are provided as additional file 7: Ecoli-closed.pdb, 8: Ecoliopen.pdb, 9: Banthracis-closed.pdb, and 10: Ccrescentusclosed.pdb.

Motif numbers in bold, their SCOR classification [12], residue positions in the tmRNA model and the source structure are shown in columns one to
four. Column five lists the filenames containing the atomic coordinates that were derived from the PDB [31], the E. coli or B. anthracis models (see
Tables 2 and 3), or were generated by ERNA-3D [11].

3-D model of E. coli tmRNA
The model shown as a ribbon diagram in Figure 3 consists
of a compacted MLD and PKD with the TLD extending
from the body of the molecule due to the near-coaxial
stacking of the helix 2 sections. The coordinates for the
TLD were taken from a previous model [35] which is
based on two cross-linked sites, one formed between
nucleotides U9/U10 near the 5' end and nucleotides
C346/U347 in the T loop, the other involving residues at
positions 25–28 and 326–329 within helix 2a (motif 2 in
Table 2). Important features of the TLD include the nonWatson-Crick base pairs formed by 19-GA-20 and 333GA-334 which have been confirmed by site-directed
mutagenesis [36].

A very efficient UV-induced cross-link observed between
the stop codon loop of helix 5 and pk2 of E. coli tmRNA
(Wower et al., unpublished) introduced a considerable
constraint of helices 5, 6, and 7, and, as has been shown
recently, is consistent with the cryo-EM structure of ribosome-bound tmRNA of the initial stage of trans-translation
[10]. Also considered was the previously-discovered covariation [37] between C44 and C66 (E. coli numbering,
Figure 1) which determines the orientation of helix 2 in

relation to helix 3 and thus the approximate angle by
which the TLD protrudes. The 44/66 covariation is
strongly supported (26 covariations versus four mismatches) in an alignment of 143 representative sequences
(not shown). Since this is a non-Watson-Crick covariation, it is difficult to propose a precise structure in this
region. More extensive studies will be required to better
understand the nature of the 44/66 covariation.
Overall, the distance between the 3'end and A231 in pk3
was 180 Å, and 70 Å between the outside edges of pk1 and
pk4. Helix 5 and pk2 were positioned in a parallel fashion. The nucleotides in the bulge between helical sections
6a and 6b (motif 9, Table 2) were adjusted manually to
allow for a close fit of helix 5 and pk2. This model is supported by the finding that mutations that destroy base
pairing in helix 5 substantially decrease tmRNA tagging
activity (Wower et al, in press) and abolish the long-distance interaction between helix 5 and pk2 as judged by the
absence of a cross-link between the stop codon loop of
helix 5 and pk2 (Wower, unpublished data). Evidence for
the existence of helix 5 has been provided by the analysis
of compensatory mutations which completely restore tagging [28]. Each of the four pseudoknots displayed the

previously determined structural properties characterized
by extensive helical stacking [27]. The MLD and pseudoknots were arranged in a central loop with the resume
codon positioned near the junction between helices 2a
and 2b (motif 3a, Table 2). Our model reflects the finding
that the pseudoknots are functionally interchangeable
[38] and thus are likely to retain a considerable level of
structural independence. Furthermore, data derived from
cross-linking experiments showing that pk2 and pk3 are
in close proximity whereas helix 5 and pk4 are further
apart (Wower, unpublished data) agree with the presented model.

3-D model of B. anthracis tmRNA
The 3-D model of the B. anthracis tmRNA (Figure 4) was
similar to the E. coli model. A sharper angle was modeled
between helix 2 axis and the PKD. The dimensions were
150 Å from the 3'end to the distant edge of pk2, and
approximately 80 Å between the outer edges of pk2 and
pk4, respectively.

Compared to the other two tmRNA models, the two-part

slightly more elongated. It measured 195 Å from the 3'-

Discussion
We have compared a growing number of tmRNA
sequences from all groups of bacteria to produce an alignment from which the secondary structure of any tmRNA
could be easily extracted. Most basepairs were supported
by phylogenetic evidence, whereas only a few helical sections required energy calculations. Uncertainties in
assignment of basepairs, such as the pseudoknot region of
chloroplasts and one-piece cyanobacterial tmRNAs, may
be eliminated in the future when more sequences will
become available.
The common layout of the secondary structures indicated
a similar function in all bacteria. The number and size of
the pseudoknots varied, supporting the idea that the pseudoknots may only enhance the essential functions carried
by the TLD and the MLD [28]. Differences in the
secondary structure features were usually not random but
occurred between groups of related organisms. For example, helix 6d was present only in the beta- and three close
relatives of the gamma-Proteobacteria. Whether these
group-specific features are responsible for differences in
the trans-translation mechanism remains to be determined. However, strategies that exploit these differences,
for example for developing new antibiotics targeted at a
specific group of bacteria, can now be envisioned.
In principle, tertiary structure models of any tmRNA in the
alignment could be built using the described procedures.
Here, we have shown how to generate a biologically more
meaningful model of E. coli tmRNA which represents a
significant progress from a previous model [27]. We also
constructed 3-D model of the tmRNAs of B. anthracis and
C. crescentus. Overall, the three models were similar in
shape and size confirming that all tmRNAs have the
potential to function similarly in trans-translation. The
TLD mimicked the L-shape of canonical tRNA [39] and
may be necessary for proper association tmRNA with the
EF-Tu, SmpB, and subsequent binding to the ribosomal Asite. The lack of a D-stem has been suggested to confer
flexibility [40], but SmpB may be responsible for stabilizing this region [41,42].
Differences in the shapes of the three tmRNA models (e.g.
the angle between helix 2 and the main body of the molecule) may be due to the difficulty in determining the
precise arrangement of the pseudoknots. Considering that
the pseudoknots are likely to constitute relatively independent structural units, conformational changes might
occur around the connecting single strands, as well as in
the MLD and the weakly-supported helix m. TmRNA may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/14

become less flexible when bound to proteins such as
SmpB and ribosomal protein S1. EF-Tu, however, likely
binds to the coaxially-stacked helices 1 and 12 [43], and
therefore appears to have little effect on the conformation
of the TLD. Protein SmpB was found to bind near helix 2a
[41,44], has two RNA binding sites [45], and thus could
make additional contacts with other regions. Protein S1 is
the largest ribosomal protein, has been shown to be close
to numerous sites, and to be required for the binding of
tmRNA to the ribosome [7]. Since S1 is a flexible, beadlike
protein [46] it may not restrict the conformational potential of the tmRNA molecule. Instead, the protein may
instill some constraint to the large central loop formed by
the PKD and the MLD. Because S1 is known to melt helices in mRNAs [47], it is also possible that it unwinds helix
m and exposes the resume codon and the preceding
nucleotides U85 and A86 for efficient trans-translation
[48,49].
The tmRNA models show the resume codon in close proximity to the internal loop formed between helical sections
2a and 2b. This arrangement would allow the ribosome to
"jump" a relatively short distance from the end of the broken mRNA onto the ORF of tmRNA. In a recent cryo-EM
study of the initial stage of trans-translation [10], the
tRNA-like region, SmpB, EF-Tu, and part of pk4 were
located in the A-site of the ribosome. We suggest that this
more open arrangement is made possible due to the flexibility of tmRNA, the melting of helix m, and/or a change
in conformation induced by the binding of tmRNA to the
ribosome (Figure 6). The opening of the central loop
seems to be accompanied by a rotation of the TLD around
the helix 2 axis (compare Figure 6A and 6B) and thus
might properly align the resume codon with the 3'-end of
broken mRNA in the ribosomal decoding centre. At the
later stages of the transit of tmRNA across the ribosome
even more dramatic conformational changes were shown
to disrupt helix 5 and the pseudoknotted regions (Wower
et al, in press). These downstream alterations are likely
mediated not by protein S1 but by the intrinsic helicase
activity of the ribosome [50] and are required to maintain
the ribosomal subunits in close proximity to the unfolded
tmRNA in order to monitor trans-translation.

Conclusion
This study significantly advances our understanding of
trans-translation by providing biologically feasible 3-D
models for the entire tmRNA molecule. Although the
modeling of only three tmRNAs has been described here,
3-D models of every tmRNA can be extracted from the
alignment. The models are characterized by a functionally
significant features, including biologically relevant structures for the single-stranded regions and the close proximity between the TLD and the resume codon.

Figure 5 of Caulobacter crescentus tmRNA
3-D model
3-D model of Caulobacter crescentus tmRNA. The 3-D model of Caulobacter crescentus s tmRNA is viewed as a ribbon
diagram from the side in panel A, the top in panel B, and in panel C turned by approximately 90° around the y-axis in relation
to A. Panel D shows a representation of the corresponding 2-D structure using the identical coloring scheme. Labeled are the
5' and 3' ends, the resume (R) and stop codons (S), and the three domains (TLD, MLD, PKD). The figure was produced with
iMol [53] and the PDB coordinates of additional file 10: Ccrescentus-closed.pdb.

Conformational changes in Escherichia coli tmRNA
Conformational changes in Escherichia coli tmRNA. Panel A: closed form of the E. coli model as shown in Figure 3. Panel
B: open conformation adjusted to more closely resemble the ribosome-bound form as determined by cryo-EM [10] using additional file 8: Ecoli-open.pdb. Panel C: coordinates extracted from the cryo-EM model [10]. The TLD is shown in dark purple,
helix 2 in green, pk1 in yellow, helix 5 in pink, pk2 in turquoise, pk3 in red, and pk4 in dark blue. Panel D: Electron density map
of the 50S subunit in light blue, the 30S subunit in yellow, and the bound tmRNA (in the absence of ribosomal protein S1) in
dark blue (from [10]).

to SmpB, ribosomal protein S1, and the ribosome suggest
a transformation of a free compact tmRNA to a more open
ribosome-bound structure. The comparative modeling
approach described here for tmRNA is easily adapted for
other RNA classes.

Methods
Comparative sequence analysis
The tmRNA sequences were arranged in phylogenetic
order using information available in the RDP [19]. When
the phylogenetic order could not be determined, the
sequence was placed next to the closest relative as determined by the ClustalW plug-in of BioEdit [18,51]. The
sequences were made available at the tmRDB [52].

Aligning was done manually using BioEdit [18] with
details described previously [13]. Briefly, closely related
sequences were aligned first. Then, invariant positions
were used as guides to align the dissimilar regions. Next,
common secondary structure elements were identified by
observing covariations and find support for basepairs, tertiary interactions, or other structural features.
Compensatory base changes (CBCs) were observed if a
change in one residue of a Watson-Crick or G-U pair was
compensated by a second change to maintain basepairing. Two residues were mismatched if they did not form a
Watson-Crick or G-U pair. CBCs and mismatches were
counted to determine positive and negative evidence in

order to prove or disprove the existence of a particular
pair. A basepair was considered proven if there was at least
twice as much positive than negative evidence. Invariant
pairs provided neither positive nor negative evidence. If a
basepair was proven in one phylogenetic group and disproved in another group, the basepair was considered to
be specific to that group.
The alignment and suggested CBCs were checked using
RNAdbTools [22] to eliminate incorrectly-paired nucleotides, suggest extensions of helices, and determine the
phylogenetic support for each basepair. Weakly supported
basepairs adjacent to supported basepairs were considered an extension of the helix and usually included in the
secondary structures (Figure 1, additional file 5:
Banthracis2D.pdf and 6: Ccrescentus2D.pdf).
3-D model building
The secondary structure information was used as input for
ERNA-3D [11] installed on an SGI workstation running
IRIX 6.5. ERNA-3D generated A-form RNA for each helix
and calculated the conformations of single-stranded
regions. The models were examined using CrystalEyes
stereovision goggles and an StereoGraphics infrared emitter. Structural motifs were identified using SCOR [12], the
coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [32], extracted using Swiss-PDBViewer [33], and
superimposed onto the model. Data obtained from site-

directed mutagenesis, cross-linking experiments, or the
literature were incorporated, and bond lengths and angles
were adjusted manually to produce biologically feasible
models. The final models were saved in PDB format
(additional files 7: Ecoli-closed.pdb, 8: Ecoli-open.pdb, 9:
Banthracis-closed.pdb, and 10: Ccrescentus-closed.pdb
and viewed in iMol [53] to create the ribbon diagrams
shown in Figures 3 to 5.

Authors' contributions
JB identified and aligned a large number of the tmRNA
sequences, carried out the 3-D modeling experiments, and
drafted portions of the text. CZ conceived the study, participated in all of its aspects, and wrote the final manuscript. FM developed the ERNA-3D program and
incorporated new functions to allow comparative
modeling of RNA. IW developed assays which allowed to
test the biological significance of the Escherichia coli
tmRNA model. JW participated in the coordination of the
study and provided RNA-RNA cross-link data which were
crucial for constraining the models in 3-D. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
