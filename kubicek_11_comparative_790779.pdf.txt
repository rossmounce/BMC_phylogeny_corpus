Abstract
Background: Mycoparasitism, a lifestyle where one fungus is parasitic on another fungus, has special relevance
when the prey is a plant pathogen, providing a strategy for biological control of pests for plant protection.
Probably, the most studied biocontrol agents are species of the genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma.
Results: Here we report an analysis of the genome sequences of the two biocontrol species Trichoderma atroviride
(teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis) and Trichoderma virens (formerly Gliocladium virens, teleomorph Hypocrea virens),
and a comparison with Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina). These three Trichoderma species display
a remarkable conservation of gene order (78 to 96%), and a lack of active mobile elements probably due to
repeat-induced point mutation. Several gene families are expanded in the two mycoparasitic species relative to T.
reesei or other ascomycetes, and are overrepresented in non-syntenic genome regions. A phylogenetic analysis
shows that T. reesei and T. virens are derived relative to T. atroviride. The mycoparasitism-specific genes thus arose
in a common Trichoderma ancestor but were subsequently lost in T. reesei.
Conclusions: The data offer a better understanding of mycoparasitism, and thus enforce the development of
improved biocontrol strains for efficient and environmentally friendly protection of plants.

Background
Mycoparasitism is the phenomenon whereby one fungus
is parasitic on another fungus, a lifestyle that can be
dated to at least 400 million years ago by fossil evidence
[1]. This has special relevance when the prey is a plant
pathogen, providing a strategy for biological control of
pests for plant protection (’biocontrol’). The movement
toward environmentally friendly agricultural practices
over the past two decades has thus accelerated research
in the use of biocontrol fungi [2]. Probably the most studied biocontrol agents are species of the genus Hypocrea/
Trichoderma, Trichoderma atroviride (Ta) and Trichoderma virens (Tv) - teleomorphs Hypocrea atroviridis
and Hypocrea virens, respectively - being among the best
mycoparasitic biocontrol agents used in agriculture [3].
The beneficial effects of Trichoderma spp. on plants
comprise traits such as the ability to antagonize soilborne pathogens by a combination of enzymatic lysis,
secretion of antibiotics, and competition for space and
substrates [4,5]. In addition, it is now known that some
Trichoderma biocontrol strains also interact intimately
with plant roots, colonizing the outer epidermis layers,
and acting as opportunistic, avirulent plant symbionts [6].
Science-based improvement of biocontrol agents for
agricultural applications requires an understanding of
the biological principles of their actions. So far, some of
the molecular aspects - such as the regulation and role
of cell wall hydrolytic enzymes and antagonistic secondary metabolites - have been studied in Trichoderma
[3-5]. More comprehensive analyses (for example, by
the use of subtractive hybridization techniques, proteomics or EST approaches) have also been performed
with different Trichoderma species, but the interpretation of the data obtained is complicated by the lack of
genome sequence information for the species used
(reviewed in [7]).

Recently, the genome of another Trichoderma, Trichoderma reesei (Tr, teleomorph H. jecorina), which has a
saprotrophic lifestyle and is an industrial producer of
plant biomass hydrolyzing enzymes, has been sequenced
and analyzed [8]. Here we report the genome sequencing and comparative analysis of two widely used biocontrol species of Trichoderma, that is, Ta and Tv.
These two were chosen because they are distantly
related to Tr [9] and represent well defined phylogenetic
species [10,11], in contrast to Trichoderma harzianum
sensu lato, which is also commonly used in biocontrol
but constitutes a complex of several cryptic species [12].

Results
Properties of the T. atroviride and T. virens genomes

The genomes of Ta IMI 206040 and Tv Gv29-8 were
sequenced using a whole genome shotgun approach to
approximately eight-fold coverage and further improved
using finishing reactions and gap closing. Their genome
sizes were 36.1 (Ta) and 38.8 Mbp (Tv), and thus larger
than the 34 Mbp determined for the genome of Tr [8].
Gene modeling, using a combination of homology and
ab initio methods, yielded 11,865 gene models for Ta
and 12,428 gene models for Tv, respectively (Table 1),
both greater than the estimate for Tr (9,143). As shown
in Figure 1, the vast majority of the genes (7,915) occur
in all three Trichoderma species. Yet Tv and Ta contain
about 2,756 and 2,510 genes, respectively, that have no
true orthologue in any of the other species, whereas Tr
has only 577 unique genes. Tv and Ta share 1,273
orthologues that are not present in Tr, which could thus
be part of the factors that make Ta and Tv mycoparasites (for analysis, see below).
With respect to other ascomycetes, Tr, Ta and Tv
share 6,306/7,091, 6,515/7,549, and 6,564/7,733 orthologues with N. crassa and Gibberella zeae, respectively.

series of three or more genes (Table 2); a global visual
survey can be obtained at the genome websites of the
three Trichoderma species (see Materials and methods)
by clicking ‘Synteny’ and ‘Dot Plot’). As observed for
other fungal genomes [13-15], extensive rearrangements
have occurred since the separation of these three fungi
but with the prevalence of small inversions [16]. The
numbers of the synteny blocks increased with their
decreased size, compatible with the random breakage
model [14] as in aspergilli [15,17]. Sequence identity
between syntenic orthologs was 70% (Tr versus Ta),
78% (Tr versus Tv), and 74% (Tv versus Ta), values that
are similar to those calculated for aspergilli (for example, Aspergillus fumigatus versus Aspergillus niger (69%)
and versus Aspergillus nidulans (68%) and comparable
to those between fish and man [17,18].

Thus, approximately a third of the genes in the three
Trichoderma species are not shared in even the relatively close relative G. zeae and are thus unique to
Trichoderma.
Genome synteny

A comparison of the genomic organization of genes in
Ta, Tv and Tr showed that most genes are in synteny:
only 367 (4%) genes of Tr, but 2,515 (22%) of genes of
Tv and 2,690 (21%) genes of Ta are located in nonTable 2 Occurrence of orthologues, paralogues and

A scan of the genome sequences with the de novo
repeat finding program ‘Piler’ [19] - which can detect
repetitive elements that are least 400 bp in length, have
more than 92% identity and are present in at least three
copies - was unsuccessful at detecting repetitive elements. The lack of repetitive elements detected in this
analysis is unusual in filamentous fungi and suggests
that, like the Tr genome [8], but unlike most other filamentous fungi, the Ta and Tv genomes lack a significant repetitive DNA component.
Because of the paucity of transposable elements (TEs)
in the Trichoderma genomes, we wondered whether
simple sequence repeats and minisatellite sequences
may also be rare. To this end, we surveyed the genomes
of the Trichoderma species using the program Tandem
Repeat Finder [20]. We also included the genomes of
three additional members of the Sordariomycetes and
one of the Eurotiomycetes as reference (Table S1 in
Additional file 1). Satellite DNA content varied from as
little as 2,371 loci (0.53% of the genome) in A. nidulans
to 9,893 (1.46% of the genome) in Neurospora crassa.
Satellite DNA content of the Trichoderma genomes ranged from 5,249 (0.94%) in Ta to 7,743 (1.54%) in Tr.
Since these values are within the range that we found in
the reference species, we conclude that there is no unusual variation in the satellite DNA content of the Trichoderma genomes.
We also scanned the genomes with RepeatMasker and
RepeatProteinMask [21] to identify sequences with similarity to known TEs from other organisms. Thereby,
sequences with significant similarity to known TEs from
other eukaryotes were identified (Table 3). In most
cases, the TE families that we detected were fragmented
and highly divergent from one another, suggesting that
they did not arise from recent transposition events.

Based on these results, we conclude that no extant,
functional TEs exist in the Trichoderma genomes. The
presence of ancient, degenerate TE copies suggests that
Trichoderma species are occasionally subject to infection, or invasion by TEs, but that the TEs are rapidly
rendered unable to replicate and rapidly accumulate
mutations.
Evidence for the operation of repeat-induced point
mutation in Trichoderma

The paucity of transposons in Trichoderma could be
due to repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a gene
silencing mechanism. In N. crassa and many other filamentous fungi, RIP preferentially acts on CA dinucleotides, changing them to TA [22]. Thus, in sequences
that have been subject to RIP, one should expect to find
a decrease in the proportion of CA dinucleotides and its
complement dinucleotide TG as well as a corresponding

increase in the proportion of TA dinucleotides. The RIP
indices TA/AT and (CA + TG)/(AC + GT) developed
by Margolin et al. [22] can be used to detect sequences
that have been subject to RIP. Sequences that have been
subjected to RIP are expected to have a high TA/AT
ratio and low (CA + TG)/(AC + GT) ratio, with values
>0.89 and <1.03, respectively, being indicative of RIP
[22,23].
To identify evidence for RIP in the TE sequences, we
computed RIP indices for four of the most prevalent
TE families in each of the three species (Table 4).
Since many of the sequences are very short, we computed the sum of the dinucleotide values within each
TE family within each species, and used the sums to
compute the RIP ratios. In only one of the 12 families
did we find that both RIP indices were within the
ranges that are typically used as criteria for RIP. Most
of the TE sequences that we identified in the Trichoderma genomes are highly degenerate and have likely
continued to accumulate mutations after the RIP process has acted on them. We suspect that these mutations have masked the underlying bias in dinucleotide
frequencies, making the RIP indices ineffective at identifying the presence of RIP. To overcome this, we also
prepared manually curated multiple sequence alignments of the TE families, selecting only sequences that
had the highest sequence similarity, and thus should
represent the most recent transposon insertion events
in the genomes. We were able to prepare curated
alignments for all four of the test TE families of Tr
and Tv only for the long terminal repeat element
Gypsy and the long interpersed nuclear element R1 in
Ta (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Among DNA
sequences that make up these ten alignments, we
detected RIP indices within the parameters that are
indicative of RIP in seven alignments. In addition, all
seven alignments have high transition/transversion
ratios, as is expected in sequences that are subject to
RIP.
Finally, screening of the genome sequences of Tr, Ta
and Tv identified orthologues of all genes required for
RIP in N. crassa (Table 5).

Paralogous gene expansion in T. atroviride and T. virens

We used Marcov cluster algorithm (MCL) analysis [24]
and included ten additional ascomycete genomes present in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) genome database (including Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes and
Dothidiomycetes) to identify paralogous gene families
that have become expanded either in all three Trichoderma species or only in the two mycoparasitic Trichoderma species. Forty-six such families were identified
for all three species, of which 26 were expanded only in
Ta and Tv. The largest paralogous expansions in all
three Trichoderma species have occurred with genes
encoding Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors, solute transporters of the major facilitator superfamily, short chain
alcohol dehydrogenases, S8 peptidases and proteins
bearing ankyrin domains (Table 6). The most expanded
protein sets, however, were those that were considerably
smaller in Tr (P < 0.05). These included ankyrin proteins with CCHC zinc finger domains, proteins with
WD40, heteroincompatibility (HET) and NACHT
domains, NAD-dependent epimerases, and sugar
transporters.
Genes with possible relevance for mycoparasitism are
expanded in Trichoderma

Mycoparasitism depends on a combination of events
that include lysis of the prey’s cell walls [3,4,7]. The
necessity to degrade the carbohydrate armor of the
prey’s hyphae is reflected in an abundance of chitinolytic
enzymes (composing most of the CAZy (CarbohydrateActive enZYmes database) glycoside hydrolase (GH)
family GH18 fungal proteins along with more rare
endo-b-N-acetylglucosaminidases) and b-1,3-glucanases
(families GH17, GH55, GH64, and GH81) in

Trichoderma relative to other fungi. Family GH18, containing enzymes involved in chitin degradation, is also
strongly expanded in Trichoderma, but particularly in
Tv and Ta, which contain the highest number of chitinolytic enzymes of all described fungi (Table 7). Chitin
is a substantial component of fungal cell walls and chitinases are therefore an integral part of the mycoparasitic
attack [3,25]. It is conspicuous that not only was the
number of chitinolytic enzymes elevated but that many
of these chitinases contain carbohydrate binding
domains (CBMs). Mycoparasitic Trichoderma species
are particularly rich in subgroup B chitinases that contain CBM1 modules, historically described as cellulose
binding modules, but binding to chitin has also been
demonstrated [26]. Tv and Ta each have a total of five
CBM1-containing GH18 enzymes. Subgroup C chitinases possess CBM18 (chitin-binding) and CBM50 modules (also known as LysM modules; described as
peptidoglycan- and chitin-binding modules). Interestingly, CBM50 modules in Trichoderma are found not
only in chitinases but also frequently as multiple copies
in proteins containing a signal peptide, but with no
identifiable hydrolase domain. In most cases these genes
can be found adjacent to chitinases in the genome.
Together with the expanded presence of chitinases,
the number of GH75 chitosanases is also significantly
expanded in all three analyzed Trichoderma species. As
with plant pathogenic fungi [27,28], we have also
observed an expansion of plant cell wall degrading
enzyme gene families. A full account of all the carbohydrate active enzymes is presented in Tables S3 to S8 in
Additional file 1. Additional details about the Trichoderma CAZome (the genome-wide inventory of CAZy)
are given in Chapter 1 of Additional file 2.

Results are from MCL analysis of the three Trichoderma species (Tr, Ta, Tv) and mean values from ten other ascomycetes whose genomes are present in the JGI
database [63]. Eurotiomycetes: Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger. Sordariomycetes: Thielavia terrerstris, Chaetomium globosum, Cryphonectria parasitica,
Neurospora discreta, Neurospora tetrasperma. Dothidiomycetes: Mycospherella graminicola, Mycospherella fijiensis, Cochliobolus heterostrophus. The number of genes
present in the “other fungi” is averaged. Data were selected from a total of 28,919 clusters, average cluster number 5.8 (standard deviation 15.73). PFAM
categories printed in bold specify those that are significantly (P < 0.05) expanded in all three Trichoderma species; numbers in bold and italics specify genes that
are significantly more abundant in Ta and Tv versus Tr (P < 0.05). GH, glycosyl hydrolase family; GST, glutahionine-S transferase; SSCP, small secreted cystein-rich
protein.

Another class of genes of possible relevance to mycoparasitism are those involved in the formation of secondary metabolites (Chapter 2 of Additional file 2).
With respect to these, the three Trichoderma species
contained a varying assortment of non-ribosomal

peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases
(PKS) (Table 8; see also Tables S9 and S10 in Additional
file 1). While Tr (10 NRPS, 11 PKS and 2 NRPS/PKS
fusion genes [8]) ranked at the lower end when compared to other ascomycetes, Tv exhibited the highest

synthase-like proteins, and NRPS-hybrid proteins (Figure S1 in Additional file 3). Most of the secondary
metabolite gene clusters present in Tr were also found
in Tv and Ta, but about half of the genes remaining in
the latter two are unique for the respective species, and
are localized on non-syntenic islands of the genome (see
below). Within the NRPS, all three Trichoderma species
contained two peptaibol synthases, one for short (10 to
14 amino acids) and one for long (18 to 25 amino acids)
peptaibols. The genes encoding long peptaibol synthetase lack introns and produce an mRNA that is 60 to 80
kb long that encodes proteins of approximately 25,000
amino acids, the largest fungal proteins known.
Besides PKS and NRPS, Ta and Tv have further augmented their antibiotic arsenal with genes for cytolytic
peptides such as aegerolysins, pore-forming cytolysins
typically present in bacteria, fungi and plants, yeast-like
killer toxins and cyanovirins (Chapter 2 of Additional
file 2). In addition, we found two high molecular weight
toxins in Ta and Tv that bear high similarity (E-value 0
for 97% coverage) to the Tc (’toxin complex’) toxins of
Photorhabdus luminescens, a bacterium that is mutualistic with entomophagous nematodes [29] (Table S11 in
Additional file 1). Apart from Trichoderma, they are

Kubicek et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R40
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/4/R40

also present in G. zeae and Podospora anserina. Yet
there may be several more secondary metabolite genes
to be detected: Trichoderma species contain expanded
arrays of cytochrome P450 CYP4/CYP19/CYP26 subfamilies (Table S12 in Additional file 1), and of soluble
epoxide hydrolases that could act on the epoxides produced by the latter (Figure S2 in Additional file 3).
The Hypocrea/Trichoderma genomes also contain an
abundant arsenal of putatively secreted proteins of 300
amino acids or less that contain at least four cysteine
residues (small secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCPs);
Chapter 3 of Additional file 2). They contained both
unique and shared sets of SSCPs, with a higher complexity in Tv and Ta than in Tr (Table S13 in Additional file 1).

Table 9 Number of PFAM domains that are enriched
among paralogous genes in non-syntenic areas

As mentioned above, 1,273 orthologous genes were
shared between Ta and Tv but absent from Tr. When
the encoded proteins were classified according to their
PFAM domains, fungal specific Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors (PF00172, PF04082) and solute transporters
(PF07690, PF00083), all of unknown function, were
most abundant (Table S14 in Additional file 1). However, the presence of several PFAM groups of oxidoreductases and monooxygenases, and of enzymes for AMP
activation of acids, phosphopathetheine attachment and
synthesis of isoquinoline alkaloids was also intriguing.
This suggests that Ta and Tv may contain an as yet
undiscovered reservoir of secondary metabolites that
may contribute to their success as mycoparasites.
We also annotated the 577 genes that are unique in T.
reesei: the vast majority of them (465; 80.6%) encoded
proteins of unknown function or proteins with no
homologues in other fungi. The remaining identified
112 genes exhibited no significant abundance in particular groups, except for four Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors, four ankyrins, four HET-domain proteins and three
WD40-domain containing proteins.
Evolution of the non-syntenic regions

A search for overrepresentation of PFAM domains and
Gene Ontology terms in the non-syntenic regions
described above revealed that all retroposon hot spot
repeat domains [30] are found in the non-syntenic
regions. In most eukaryotes, these regions are located in
subtelomeric areas that exhibit a high recombination
frequency [31]. In addition, the genes for the protein
families in Tv and Ta that were significantly more abundant compared to Tr were enriched in the non-syntenic
areas (Table 9). In addition, the number of paralogous
genes was significantly increased in the non-syntenic
regions. We considered three possible explanations for

this: the non-syntenic genes were present in the last
common ancestor of all three Trichoderma species but
were then selectively and independently lost; the nonsyntenic areas arose from the core genome by duplication and divergence during evolution of the genus Trichoderma; and the non-syntenic genes were acquired by
horizontal transfer. To distinguish among these hypotheses for their origin, we compared the sequence characteristics of the genes in the non-syntenic regions to
those present in the syntenic regions in Trichoderma
and genes in other filamentous fungi. We found that the
majority (>78%) of the syntenic as well as non-syntenic
encoded proteins have their best BLAST hit to other
ascomycete fungi, indicating that the non-syntenic
regions are also of fungal origin. Also, a high number of
proteins encoded in the non-syntenic regions of Ta and
Tv have paralogs in the syntenic region. Finally, codon
usage tables and codon adaptation index analysis [32]
indicate that the non-syntenic genes exhibit a similar
codon usage (Figure S3 in Additional file 3). Taken
together, the most parsimonious explanation for the
presence of the paralogous genes in Ta and Tv is that
the non-syntenic genes arose by gene duplication within
a Trichoderma ancestor, followed by gene loss in the
three lineages, which was much stronger in Tr.
Tr, Ta and Tv each occupy very diverse phylogenetic
positions in the genus Trichoderma, as shown by a
Bayesian rpb2 tree of 110 Trichoderma taxa (Figure 2).
In order to determine which of the three species more
likely resembles the ancestral state of Trichoderma, we
performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis [33] using a

concatenated set of 100 proteins that were encoded by
orthologous genes in syntenic areas in the three Trichoderma species and also G. zeae and Chaetomium globosum. The result (Figure 2) shows that Ta occurs in a
well-supported basal position to Tv and Tr. These data
indicate that Ta resembles the more ancient state of
Trichoderma and that both Tv and Tr evolved later. The
lineage to Tr thus appears to have lost a significant
number of genes present in Ta and maintained in Tv.
The long genetic distance of Tr further suggests that it
was apparently evolving faster then Ta and Tv since the
time of divergence.
To test this assumption, we compared the evolutionary rates of the 100 orthologous and syntenic gene
families between the three Trichoderma species. The
median values of the evolutionary rates (Ks and Ka) of
Ta-Tr and Tv-Tr were all significantly higher (1.77 and
1.47, and 1.33 and 1.19, respectively) than those of TaTv (1.13 and 0.96; all P values <0.05 by the two-tailed
Wilcoxon rank sum test). This result supports the above
suggestion that Tr has been evolving faster than Ta and
Tv.

Discussion
Comparison of the genomes of two mycoparasitic and
one saprotrophic Trichoderma species revealed remarkable differences: in contrast to the genomes of other
multicellular ascomycetes, such as aspergilli [15,17],
those of Trichoderma appear to be have the highest
level of synteny of all genomes investigated (96% for Tr
and still 78/79% for Tv and Ta, respectively, versus 68
to 75% in aspergilli), and most of the differences
between Ta and Tv versus Tr or other ascomycetes
occur in the non-syntenic areas. Nevertheless, at a molecular level the three species are as distant from each
other as apes from Pices (fishes) or Aves (birds) [17],
suggesting a mechanism maintaining this high genomic
synteny. Espagne et al. [13] proposed that a discrepancy
of genome evolution between P. anserina, N. crassa and
the aspergilli and saccharomycotina yeasts is based on
the difference between heterothallic and homothallic
fungi: in heterothallics the presence of interchromosomal translocation could result in chromosome breakage
during meiosis and reduced fertility, whereas homothallism allows translocations to be present in both partners
and thus have fewer consequences on fertility. Since Trichoderma is heterothallic [34], this explanation is also
applicable to it. However, another mechanism, meiotic
silencing of unpaired DNA [35] - which has also been
proposed for P. anserina [13], and which eliminates progeny in crosses involving rearranged chromosomes in
one of the partners - may not function in Trichoderma
because one of the essential genes (SAD2 [36]) is
missing.

Page 10 of 15

Our data also suggest that the ancestral state of Hypocrea/Trichoderma was mycoparasitic. This supports an
earlier speculation [37] that the ancestors of Trichoderma were mycoparasites on wood-degrading basidiomycetes and acquired saprotrophic characteristics to
follow their prey into their substrate. Indirect evidence
for this habitat shift in Tr was also presented by Slot
and Hibbett [38], who demonstrated that Tr - after
switching to a specialization on a nitrogen-poor habitat
(decaying wood) - has acquired a nitrate reductase gene
(which was apparently lost earlier somewhere in the
Sordariomycetes lineage) by horizontal gene transfer
from basidiomycetes.
Furthermore, the three Trichoderma species have the
lowest number of transposons reported so far. This is
unusual for filamentous fungi, as most species contain
approximately 10 to 15% repetitive DNA, primarily
composed of TEs. A notable exception is Fusarium graminearum [27], which, like the Trichoderma species,
contains less than 1% repetitive DNA [8]. The paucity of
repetitive DNA may be attributed to RIP, which has
been suggested to occur in Tr [8] and for which we
have here provided evidence that it also occurs in Ta
and Tv. It is likely that this process also contributes to
prevent the accumulation of repetitive elements.
The gene inventory detected in the three Trichoderma
species reveals new insights into the physiology of this fungal genus: the strong expansion of genes for solute transport, oxidoreduction, and ankyrins (a family of adaptor
proteins that mediate the anchoring of ion channels or
transporters in the plasma membrane [39]) could render
Trichoderma more compatible in its habitat (for example,
to successfully compete with the other saprotrophs for limiting substrates). In addition, the expansion of WD40
domains acting as hubs in cellular networks [40] could aid
in more versatile metabolism or response to stimuli. These
features correlate well with a saprotrophic lifestyle that
makes use of plant biomass that has been pre-degraded by
earlier colonizers. The expansion of HET proteins (proteins
involved in vegetative incompatibility specificity) on the
other hand suggests that Trichoderma species may frequently encounter related yet genetically distinct individuals. In fact, the presence of several different Trichoderma
species can be detected in a single soil sample [41]. Unfortunately, vegetative incompatibility has not yet been investigated in any Trichoderma species, and based on the
current data, should be a topic of future research.
Finally, the abundance of SSCPs in Trichoderma may
be involved in rhizosphere competence: the genome of
the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor also
encodes a large set of SSCPs, which accumulate in the
hyphae that colonize the host root [42].
Gene expansions in Tv and Ta that do not occur in
Tr may comprise genes specific for mycoparasitism.

As a prominent example, proteases have expanded in Ta
and Tv, supporting the hypothesis that the degradation
of proteins is a major trait of mycoparasites [43]. Likewise, the increase in chitinolytic enzymes and some ßglucanase-containing GH families is remarkable and
illustrates the importance of destruction of the prey’s
cell wall in this process. With respect to the chitinases,
the expansion of those bearing CBM50 modules was
particularly remarkable: proteins containing these modules were recently classified into several different groups
by de Jonge and Thomma [44]. Proteins that consist
solely of CBM50 modules are type-A LysM proteins,
and there is evidence for the role of these as virulence
factors in plant pathogenic fungi. The high numbers of
LysM proteins that are found in Trichoderma, however,
indicate other/additional roles for these proteins in fungal biology that are not understood yet. Also, the expansion of the GH75 chitosanases was intriguing: chitosan
is a partially deacetylated derivative of chitin and,
depending on the fungal species and the growth conditions, in mature fungal cell walls chitin is partially deacetylated. It has also been reported that fungi
deacetylate chitin as a defense mechanism [45,46]. Chitosan degradation may therefore be a relevant aspect of
mycoparasitism and fungal cell wall degradation that has
also not been regarded yet. Overall, the carbohydrateactive enzyme machinery present in Trichoderma is
compatible with saprophytic behavior but, interestingly,
the set of enzymes involved in the degradation of ‘softer’
plant cell wall components, such as pectin, is reduced.
A possible plant symbiotic relationship [3] might rely on
a mycoparasitic capacity along with a reduced specificity
for pectin, minimizing the plant defense reaction.
Although the genes encoding proteins for the synthesis of typical fungal secondary metabolites (PKS, NRPS,
PKS-NRPS) are also abundant, they are not significantly
more expanded than in some other fungi. An exception
is Tv and its 28 NRPS genes. However, our genome analysis revealed also a high number of oxidoreductases,
cytochrome P450 oxidases, and other enzymes that
could be part of as yet unknown pathways for the synthesis of further secondary metabolites. In support of this,
several of these genes were found to be clustered in the
genome (data not shown), and were more abundant in
the two mycoparasitic species Ta and Tv. Together with
the expanded set of oxidoreductases, monooxygenases,
and enzymes for AMP activation of acids, phosphopathetheine attachment, and synthesis of isoquinoline
alkaloids in Ta and Tv, these genes may define new secondary metabolite biosynthetic routes.

development of improved and research-driven strategies
to select and improve Trichoderma species as biocontrol
agents. The availability of the genome sequences published in this study, as well as of several pathogenic
fungi and their potential host plants (for example, [47])
provides a challenging opportunity to develop a deeper
understanding of the underlying processes by which Trichoderma interacts with plant pathogens in the presence
of living plants within their ecosystem.

Conclusions
Our comparative genome analysis of the three Trichoderma species now opens new opportunities for the

Genome similarity analysis and genomic synteny

Materials and methods
Genome sequencing and assembly

The genomes of T. virens and T. atroviride each were
assembled from shotgun reads using the JGI (USA Department of Energy) assembler Jazz (see Table S15 in Additional file 1 for summary of assembly statistics). Each
genome was annotated using the JGI Annotation pipeline,
which combines several gene prediction, annotation and
analysis tools. Genes were predicted using Fgenesh [48],
Fgenesh+ [49], and Genewise programs [50]. ESTs from
each species (Chapter 4 of Additional file 2) were clustered
and either assembled and converted into putative fulllength genes directly mapped to genomic sequence or
used to extend predicted gene models into full-length
genes by adding 5’ and/or 3’ untranslated regions to the
models. From multiple gene models predicted at each
locus, a single representative model was chosen based on
homology and EST support and used for further analysis.
Gene model characteristics and support are summarized
in Tables S16 and S17 in Additional file 1.
All predicted gene models were functionally annotated
by homology to annotated genes from a NCBI nonredundant set and classified according to Gene Ontology
[51], eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) [52], and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
metabolic pathways [53]. See Tables S18 and S19 in
Additional file 1 for a summary of the functional annotation. Automatically predicted genes and functions
were further refined by user community-wide manual
curation efforts using web-based tools at [54,55]. The
latest version gene set containing manually curated
genes is called GeneCatalog.
Assembly and annotation data for Tv and Ta are
available through JGI Genome Portals homepage at
[54,55]. The genome assemblies, predicted gene models,
and annotations were deposited at GenBank under project accessions [GenBank: ABDF00000000 and
ABDG00000000], respectively. GenBank public release
of the data described in this paper should coincide with
the manuscript publication date.

Orthologous genes, as originally defined, imply a reflection of the history of species. In recent years, many

Kubicek et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R40
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/4/R40

studies have examined the concordance between orthologous gene trees and species trees in bacteria. With the
purpose of identifying all the orthologous gene pairs for
the three Trichoderma species, a best bidirectional blast
hit approach as described elsewhere [56,57] was performed, using the predicted translated gene models for
each of the three species as pairwise comparison sets.
The areas of relationship known as syntenic regions or
syntenic blocks are anchored with orthologs (calculated
as mutual best hits or bi-directional best hits) between
the two genomes in question, and are built by controlling for the minimum number of genes, minimum density, and maximum gap (genes not from the same
genome area) compared with randomized data as
described in [56]. While this technique may cause artificial breaks, it highlights regions that are dynamic and
picking up a large number of insertions or duplications.
Orthologous and paralogous gene models were identified by first using BLAST to find all pairwise matches
between the resulting proteins from the gene models.
The pairwise matches from BLAST were then clustered
into groups of paralogs using MCL [58]. In parallel we
applied orthoMCL [59] to the same pairwise matches to
identify the proteins that were orthologous in all of the
three genomes. By subtracting all the proteins that were
identified as orthologs from the groups of paralogs and
unique genes, we were left with only the protein products of gene models that have expanded since the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the three Trichoderma genomes. We then calculated the P-value under
the null hypothesis that the number of non-orthologous
genes that are non-syntenic is less than the number of
non-orthologous genes that are syntenic.
Identification of transposable elements

We scanned the Trichoderma genomes with the de novo
repeat finding program Piler [19]. Next, we searched for
sequences with similarity to known repetitive elements
from other eukaryotes with the program RepeatMasker
[21] using all eukaryotic repetitive elements in the
RepBase (version 13.09) database. After masking repetitive sequences that matched the DNA sequence of
known repetitive elements, we scanned the masked genome sequences with RepeatProteinMask (a component
of the RepeatMasker application). This search located
additional degenerate repetitive sequences with similarity to proteins encoded by TEs in the RepBase database.
CAZome identification and analysis

All protein models for Ta and Tv were compared
against the set of libraries of modules derived from
CAZy [60,61]. The identified proteins were subjected to
manual analysis for correction of the protein models, for
full modular annotation and for functional inference

Page 12 of 15

against a library of experimentally characterized
enzymes. Comparative analysis was made by the enumeration of all modules identified in the three Trichoderma species and 14 other published fungal genomes.
Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses

One-hundred genes were randomly selected from Ta,
Tv, Tr and C. globosum based on their property to fulfill
two requirements: they were in synteny in all four genomes, and they were true orthologues (no other gene
encoding a protein with amino acid similarity >50% present). After alignment, the concatenated 10,449 amino
acids were subjected to Bayesian analysis [33] using 1
million generations. The respective cDNA sequences
(31,347 nucleotides) were also concatenated, and Ks/Ka
ratios determined using DNASp5 [62]. The same file
was also used to determine the codon adaptation index
[32]. In addition, 80 non-syntenic genes were also
selected randomly for this purpose.
The species phylogram of Trichoderma/Hypocrea was
constructed by Bayesian analysis of partial exon nucleotide sequences (824 total characters from which 332
were parsimony-informative) of the rpb2 gene (encoding
RNA polymerase B II) from 110 ex-type strains, thereby
spanning the biodiversity of the whole genus. The tree
was obtained after 5 million MCMC generations
sampled for every 100 trees, using burnin = 1200 and
applying the general time reversible model of nucleotide
substitution. The NCBI ENTREZ accession numbers
