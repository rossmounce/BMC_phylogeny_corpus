Abstract
Background: Baboons of the genus Papio are distributed over wide ranges of Africa and even colonized
parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Traditionally, five phenotypically distinct species are recognized, but recent
molecular studies were not able to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, these studies
revealed para- and polyphyletic (hereafter paraphyletic) mitochondrial clades for baboons from eastern
Africa, and it was hypothesized that introgressive hybridization might have contributed substantially to
their evolutionary history. To further elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among baboons, we
extended earlier studies by analysing the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the 'Brown
region' from 67 specimens collected at 53 sites, which represent all species and which cover most of the
baboons' range.
Results: Based on phylogenetic tree reconstructions seven well supported major haplogroups were
detected, which reflect geographic populations and discordance between mitochondrial phylogeny and
baboon morphology. Our divergence age estimates indicate an initial separation into southern and
northern baboon clades 2.09 (1.54–2.71) million years ago (mya). We found deep divergences between
haplogroups within several species (~2 mya, northern and southern yellow baboons, western and eastern
olive baboons and northern and southern chacma baboons), but also recent divergence ages among
species (< 0.7 mya, yellow, olive and hamadryas baboons in eastern Africa).
Conclusion: Our study confirms earlier findings for eastern Africa, but shows that baboon species from
other parts of the continent are also mitochondrially paraphyletic. The phylogenetic patterns suggest a
complex evolutionary history with multiple phases of isolation and reconnection of populations. Most
likely all these biogeographic events were triggered by multiple cycles of expansion and retreat of savannah
biomes during Pleistocene glacial and inter-glacial periods. During contact phases of populations reticulate
events (i.e. introgressive hybridization) were highly likely, similar to ongoing hybridization, which is
observed between East African baboon populations. Defining the extent of the introgressive hybridization
will require further molecular studies that incorporate additional sampling sites and nuclear loci.

Background
The contribution of reticulate evolution, in particular natural and introgressive hybridization to the origin and
development of humans and primates in general has
recently gained much attention [1-7]. One primate species
complex that turned out to be of particular interest in this
respect are baboons (Papio spp.). They diverged on a time
scale analogous to that of Homo in similar, if not the same
habitats in southern and eastern Africa, and it has been
proposed to use them as an analogous model, when
exploring the evolution of the hominin lineages [8,9]. It
was estimated that they have radiated across Africa
approximately 1.8 million years ago (mya) [10]. Baboons
are now distributed all over sub-Saharan Africa, excluding
most parts of the west and central African rainforest, and
have even colonized parts of the Arabian Peninsula [1113] (Figure 1). They form morphologically and geographically distinct populations but demonstrate no pre- or
postzygotic reproductive isolation [8,14-16]. Additionally, baboons are known to produce fertile hybrid offspring with geladas (Theropithecus gelada) [17,18]. The
divergence between these sister genera is estimated at 3.5–
4 mya [[19,20] and references therein]. The five generally
acknowledged baboon types are the Guinea baboon (P.
(hamadryas) papio) from West Africa, the olive baboon (P.
(h.) anubis) from the northern savannah belt, the hamadryas baboon (P. (h.) hamadryas) from north-east Africa
and the south-western Arabian Peninsula, the yellow
baboon (P. (h.) cynocephalus) from the East African coastal
lowlands, Zambia and Angola and the chacma baboon (P.
(h.) ursinus) from southern Africa (Figure 1).
The taxonomic status of the five baboon types has been
debated for more than 50 years without reaching a consensus [for reviews see [21,22]]. They are either classified
as (allopatric) subspecies of the superspecies Papio hamadryas [22,23] or as distinct species [24-26]. In addition to
the five traditional types several other geographic variants
have been described [21], of which at least some deserve
the same taxonomic level as the five basic types [8,22,23].
Here we follow Groves [24], Grubb et al. [25] and Jolly
[26] and recognize baboon allotaxa as phylogenetic species. Since the question regarding the appropriate taxonomic level is more a matter of philosophy, depending
largely on the underlying species concept [27], an accurate
and well-supported phylogeny is crucial for understanding the evolution of the genus. This is of particular relevance for all studies where phylogenies have to be
correlated such as in co-evolution studies, for example,
the evolution of primates and their pathogens [28]. Similarly, in studies concerning the evolution of certain traits,
such as particular heritable social behaviours, it is important to distinguish between ancestral (plesiomorphic) and
derived (apomorphic) states. If, for example, hamadryas
baboons are the most basal baboons, as in the phylogeny

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/83

proposed by Purvis [29], their peculiar social organization
with its one-male units [30] could be regarded as the
ancestral social organization of the baboon clade and not
the multi-male organization of other baboon taxa [31].
Hence, incorrect phylogenies will inevitably lead to incorrect inferences about the evolution of species.
The origin of Papio is suggested to be in southern Africa
[fossil evidence: [32-34]] and the oldest mitochondrial
haplotypes so far were found in chacma baboons which
live in southern Africa [10]. Apart from its origin, the evolutionary course of different baboon taxa is a subject of
great debate and speculation. Based on morphological
and behavioural characters several contradictory intrageneric phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed [for
a review see [10]]. In molecular studies discordance
between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogenies and
morphology-based taxonomy became obvious, suggesting that reticulation events affected the evolutionary history of baboons [10,15,35,36].
In this study, we determined the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Papio and estimated the dates of
divergence events between lineages. Our analyses are
based on complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
(cytb) and 'Brown region' [37] sequences. We expanded
geographic and taxon sampling to make our phylogenetic
analysis more robust [38], because taxon sampling is particularly important in paraphyletic species [38,39].
Thus, our sampling covered most of the range of Papio and
included previously unsampled regions and taxa, and
does not include samples from captive animals with the
exception of one sample from a confiscated animal in
Cameroon. Therefore only samples of clear provenance
are present in the analysed data set. This enabled us to
extend previous analyses substantially and to refine the
phylogenetic resolution among mtDNA haplotypes.
Comparisons of the biogeographic distribution of
mtDNA haplotypes and morphotypes allowed us to detect
indications for introgressive hybridization and reticulate
evolution.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships
We successfully amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial 'Brown region' and the complete cytb gene from 67
individuals from 53 localities (Additional file 1). Concatenated 'Brown region' and cytb sequences (2,036 bp)
resulted in 54 haplotypes (excluding outgroup), which
were defined by 435 variable sites, of which 338 were parsimony-informative. Identical haplotypes were found
mainly in animals, that came from the same locality
(same social group), but were also found from sites
located more than 1,100 km apart (Figures 1, 2; Addi-

tional file 1). When examining each locus separately, 47
haplotypes were detected in the 'Brown region' (896 bp),
defined by 182 variable sites, of which 140 were parsimony-informative. In baboons from the southern part of
the Republic of South Africa (RSA), southern and western
Namibia and western Angola, a triplet deletion in the
ND5 gene of the 'Brown region' was detected. The complete cytb sequence (1,140 bp) contained 252 variable
sites, of which 198 were parsimony-informative defining
50 haplotypes.
According to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the
'Brown region' was found to best fit the Tamura-Nei

model (TrN), while for both the cytb gene alone and the
concatenated data set a Transition model (TIM) was
selected. For all data sets a model with both gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (Γ) and a proportion of invariant sites (I) was proposed.
Simple neighbor-joining reconstructions based on uncorrected distances for both data sets (cytb and 'Brown
region') revealed identical tree topologies and similar
branch lengths (data not shown), indicating that both
data sets contain solely mitochondrial fragments and no
nuclear pseudogenes. Moreover, no inconsistent nucle-

otides were detected in overlapping regions of both studied loci.
Detailed phylogenetic relationships were estimated with
Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML; -lnL =
7359.8389 – 7360.1104) approaches, which both led to
identical topologies and similar support values (Figure 2).
Several well-supported clades were detected which however, do not concur with the five baboon species. The only
exception are Guinea baboons, which form a monophyletic group. All other species were mitochondrially
paraphyletic. In contrast, we found a strong geographical
signal with local populations forming monophyletic
groups irrespective of their species affiliations, which
clearly showed the discordance between mtDNA phylogeny and morphology (Figure 2).
In total, seven larger haplogroups were detected (clade AG; Figure 2), which are distributed in two major clades, a
southern and a northern one. However, respective monophylies of the southern and northern clades are only
weakly supported, suggesting that the divergence of the
two clades most likely happened within a short time
period. The major southern clade further divides into
three clades, the southern chacma clade (A), representing
haplotypes from the Drakensberg, the Cape, western RSA,
southern and western Namibia and south-western
Angola, the northern mixed chacma and yellow baboon
clade (B), which includes chacma haplotypes from
Mozambique, northern RSA, Zimbabwe, Botswana,
south-central Zambia and north-eastern Namibia, and
yellow baboon haplotypes from Malawi, eastern Zambia
and south-eastern Tanzania, and finally, (C) a clade of
baboons that originated from central Zambia, which morphologically represent Kinda baboons. The triplet deletion in the ND5 region is an autapomorphy of clade (A)
since it was not found in any other papionin.
The major northern clade divides into a western and an
eastern clade. The western clade consists of one clade of
olive baboon haplotypes found in Ivory Coast and western Nigeria (D, west1), a second clade of olive baboon
haplotypes mainly from central and eastern Nigeria and
northern Cameroon (F, west2), and a well-defined clade
of Guinea baboon haplotypes covering the area from
Guinea to Senegal (E). The eastern clade is comprised of a
mixture of different species. The first separation concerns
yellow baboons from the Kenyan coast, whereas the second includes olive baboons (central olives) from western
Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). Furthermore, we found two more clades, one
comprised of yellow and olive baboon haplotypes from
northern Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia while the other
represents a mixture of olive and hamadryas baboon haplotypes from Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Arabian Peninsula.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/83

In total, ten well-supported terminal clades/lineages
became apparent in our study, which represent geographic populations or demes. The only exceptions are
southern yellow baboons, which are paraphyletic. The
approximate geographical distribution of the respective
haplogroups is shown in Figure 3.
Estimation of divergence times
The data set used to estimate divergence times contains
2,023 bp of sequence information from 27 primate individuals. Over half of the characters (1,071 bp) were variable and 787 were parsimony-informative. The coding
regions were found to best fit a TrN model with both
gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (Γ) and a proportion of invariant sites (I), and non-coding regions were
found to best fit a TVM + Γ + I model.

Using three divergence dates as calibrations (C1: PanHomo, C2: Pongo-African apes and C3: Macaca-Papio in
Table 1 and Figure 4), the Papio-Theropithecus divergence
(N2) was dated at 3.99 million years ago (mya) (95%
confidence limits [CI]: 2.92–5.09 mya), which is in the
same range as both, the estimate given by Newman et al.
[10] and the divergence date suggested by fossil evidence
(3.5–4.0 mya) [[19,20] and references therein]. The subsequent divergences within Papio are considerably
younger (~2 mya) and started in the Late Pliocene. The
divergence of the ancestral Papio stem into a southern and
a northern lineage (N3) was inferred to have occurred at
2.09 (1.54–2.71) mya. Shortly afterwards, the respective
northern lineage diverged further into a western and an
eastern clade (N4, 1.89 [1.33–2.48] mya) and the respective southern lineage into a southern and a northern
proto-chacma baboon clade (N5, 1.80 [1.28–2.36] mya).
Within the lineage leading to northern chacma baboons,
Kinda baboons diverged 1.49 (1.03–1.98) mya (N6), followed by the separation of southern yellow baboons 0.94
(0.58–1.30) mya (N7). The age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the north-western lineage leading to Guinea and western olive baboons was estimated at
1.50 (1.02–2.02) mya (N11). In this lineage, the earliest
divergence was between olive baboons of clade w1 and a
common clade of Guinea/olive w2. The separation
between the latter was estimated at 1.36 (0.91–1.86) mya
(N12).
In the north-eastern clade, coastal yellow baboons
diverged first 0.68 (0.40–0.97) mya (N17), followed by
central olive baboons 0.54 (0.32–0.78) mya (N18). Eastern olive and northern yellow were mitochondrially separated from north-eastern olive and hamadryas baboons
0.32 (0.16–0.51) mya (N19). The divergence ages for the
north-eastern clade fall in the same range as found in earlier studies. Newman et al. [10] estimated separations
within the north-eastern clade of less than 0.62 (0.58–

Discussion

phylogeny and baboon morphology, which is most likely
equivalent to a discordance between mitochondrial and
nuclear phylogeny, results in mitochondrial paraphyly,
which is common among animal taxa including primates
[36,41-44].

Our phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that baboon
populations can be diagnosed through mtDNA and are
sorted into several coherent and reasonably well-supported haplogroups that do not match with recognized
baboon species. The discordance between mitochondrial

The observed discordance might be explained by introgressive hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting since
both can result in similar phylogenetic patterns and

structions [45,46]. Although we can not rule out completely that incomplete lineage sorting may have had an
effect, the strict geographical pattern of the baboon haplogroups provides some evidence against incomplete lineage sorting, because lineage sorting is a random process
and the paraphyletic relationships that result from the
failure of haplotypes to sort during speciation events
should be random with respect to geography [47]. In contrast, in our mitochondrial phylogeny geographic close
populations cluster together, which is often a strong indication of reticulation [41]. Thus, we conclude that introgressive hybridization rather than incomplete lineage
sorting has resulted in the discordance between mitochondrial and morphological phylogeny present in
baboons.
The introgression hypothesis becomes even more likely by
the fact that baboons and other papionins show a strong
tendency for intra- and intergeneric hybridization.
Generic hybridization was observed between Papio and
Theropithecus and between Papio and Rungwecebus
[17,18,48]. For baboons, intrageneric hybrid zones are
known for olive and northern yellow baboons [10,16,4951], olive and hamadryas baboons [35,36,40,52] and
Kinda and southern yellow baboons [15].

Male dispersal and female philopatry are the norm in
baboons and other papionins [53] and one can assume
that this is the ancestral state. Therefore male introgression would be the most likely introgression scenario,
where males from one taxon invade groups of a neighbouring taxon and reproduce successfully. Extensive backcrossing of the hybrid offspring over generations with
more invading males of the first taxon would result in
nuclear swamping. This process can lead to the extinction
of the introgressed taxon and only their mitochondrial
genomes would remain as vestiges of their former existence in a population which morphologically would be the
same as the introgressing taxon.
Together with a recurrent isolation and reconnection of
local baboon populations in many parts of their range
due to climate changes the male introgression and nuclear
swamping hypothesis can explain the striking discordance
between mitochondrial phylogeny and baboon morphology.
Phylogeography
The paraphyletic pattern suggests a complicated biogeographic history of baboon species. Multiple phases of isolation, hybridization and introgression are highly
probable, most likely triggered by the multiple cycles of

expansion and retreat of savannah biomes during Pleistocene glacial and inter-glacial periods [54-56]. During
the last 2.5 million years there have been about 20 glacial
cycles of major forest expansions and retreats in Africa
[57,58]. Environments during glacial periods were characterized by dry, tropical scrub and grassland with limited
gallery forest along drainages, and thus, with the retreat of
dense forest into high altitude and large river refugia,
savannah corridors opened and provided pioneering and
recurrent dispersal possibilities for savannah adapted
mammal populations, such as baboons. Evidence for the
multiple savannah and forest cycles come from pollen
core data and the current distribution patterns of forest
organisms [58-63]. The divergence of the Papio lineage
accompanied by the dispersal from southern Africa to the

north (~2.1 mya) and the further division into several distinct southern (~1.8 mya) and northern lineages (~1.9
mya) appears to be temporally in accordance with the
expansion of savannah habitats and a major radiation of
antelopes (Bovidae) and the diversification of hominins
[64], all as a result of the onset and recurrence of the
northern hemisphere glaciations since ~2.5 mya.
A similar phylogeographic pattern of an early north-south
division and the subsequent division of the northern
clade into an eastern and western clade have also been
shown for other large African savannah mammals, such as
hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus [65,66], topi Damaliscus
lunatus and wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus[65], roan
antelope Hippotragus equinus [67], warthog Phacochoerus

africanus [68], giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis [69] and lion
Panthera leo [70]. Within several of these taxa paraphyletic
relationships were detected, similar to the pattern found
in baboons [65]. These biogeographic patterns have been
interpreted as results of Plio-Pleistocene climate cycles
when the expansion of savannah habitats supported the
dispersal of these taxa, although not for all taxa on the
same time scale. However, a detailed analysis of these
processes and a comparison with detailed data on climate
and habitat change in Africa during the last 2.5 mya is far
beyond the scope of our paper.
Our findings are almost consistent with the scenario for
the mitochondrial population structure of Papio laid out
by C.J. Jolly in his "North-south Split" and "Philopatry at
the Frontier" hypotheses [C.J. Jolly pers. comm., [22,71]].
From our data the following scenario can be developed.
Baboons dispersed to the south and north from a southern African origin at times when climate and habitat conditions were suitable (~2.1 mya), that is if during dry
conditions dense forests were replaced by savannah and
savannah woodland. There is evidence from various
sources that two savannah corridors existed during arid
periods in the Plio-Pleistocene, which baboons could
have followed on their way north [58,72-75]. One migration route lead through a savannah corridor in eastern
Africa and a second through a savannah corridor in eastern DRC west of the Pleistocene forest refuge in the Rift
Mountains.
Baboons migrating to the north subsequently dispersed
over the complete northern savannah belt, from Eritrea to
Senegal. Changes of the climate to more humid condition
with expanding forests probably led to the isolation of
local baboon populations, because for most baboons
dense forests constitute biogeographical barriers. These
allopatric populations evolved for certain periods of time
independently. Subsequent climate changes to more arid
conditions again opened savannah corridors so that isolated populations were able to reconnect, with the chance
of gene flow. As an extreme outcome, some of the historical baboon populations might have been "swallowed" by
invading populations and became extinct. Male olive
baboons, for example, reproduced with females from
neighbouring populations, with subsequent nuclear
swamping. Olive baboons, thus, most likely absorbed
these local baboon forms, such as w1 and w2, from which
we can still find the mitochondrial genome (clade 4 and
5) in western olive baboons. A similar process occurred in
east and north-east Africa where olive baboons from
Kenya and northern Tanzania carry mitochondria derived
from a neighbouring yellow or proto-yellow baboon
stock or in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where they carry hamadryas or proto-hamadryas mitochondria. In the latter cases,
parts of the original populations still exist, as northern

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/83

yellow and hamadryas baboons. However, hybridization
between olive and yellow baboons and olive and hamadryas baboons (hybrid zones in Awash, Ethiopia [14] and
Amboseli, Kenya [16]) is still going on. It is also likely that
hybridization occurs at the western end of the olive
baboon range, where olive and Guinea baboons meet.
Similarly, introgression and nuclear swamping can
explain why yellow baboons of Zambia carry mitochondria only distantly related to those of northern Tanzanian
and Kenyan yellow baboons, and chacma baboons from
Botswana and Zambia are mitochondrially very distant
from those living in South Africa. In case of southern and
northern yellow baboons a possible scenario could be
that yellow baboons introgressed from the south into a
neighbouring northern population (possibly protohamadryas) after the retreat of an East African forest barrier. Complete nuclear swamping would lead to a replacement of the local northern population with yellow
baboons, which, however, would carry the mitochondria
of the northern population. In case of chacma baboons
we assume that they introgressed into parts of the southern yellow baboon population, thus replaced the yellow
baboon nuclear genome, but retained the yellow baboon
mitochondria. These events most likely took place early in
the speciation process so that there was time for resulting
chacma baboon population to evolve further into greyfooted chacmas. Interestingly, Zinner et al. [48] found
that the recently described genus Rungwecebus [76,77] also
carries mitochondria of the northern chacma – southern
yellow baboon haplogroup, suggesting that also on this
intergeneric level introgression events occurred. Our
introgression hypothesis is partly built on similar sexually-differentiated introgression scenarios envisioned by
Wildman et al. [36].
Taxonomic implications
Our study shows that mtDNA does not constitute a useful
marker for the identification of the five traditionally recognized Papio species. If terminal clades in our phylogeny
would be regarded as phylogenetic species, one would
have to split haplogroups of the same morphotype into
different species (e.g. various olive baboon haplogroups,
which most likely are not only similar in their morphology but also in their behaviour and ecology) or one would
have to lump members of different morphotypes as one
species, e.g. hamadryas and eastern olive baboons which
are different not only in their morphology but even more
in their social system [14,78,79]. Guinea baboons, which
morphologically and genetically constitute a monophyletic clade seem to be the only exception. However,
there are indications for introgression also from western
olive baboons into Guinea baboons [80].

Despite these limitations, our data, in combination with
morphological [23,81], behavioural [82] and additional

Page 9 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:83

genetic data [15] support the recognition of Kinda
baboons as a distinct species (P. kindae). In our sample,
we did not find any overlap between Kinda and either
southern yellow or northern chacma baboons. In contrast, in a more detailed study of the Kinda baboons and
neighbouring baboon populations, Burrell [15] found
some evidence for gene flow between Kinda and yellow
baboons in a narrow contact zone in eastern Zambia. Similarly, Clifford Jolly (pers. comm.) found some intermediate morphotypes between grey-footed and Kinda baboons
where they meet.
Baboons of the southern chacma haplogroup possibly
represent Cape chacmas (P. (u.) ursinus) and those of the
northern chacma haplogroup grey-footed chacmas (P.
(u.). griseipes), as was proposed by Jolly [8,22]. However,
it remains to be explored, whether various haplogroups of
yellow and olive baboons from eastern and western Africa
may represent formerly described, but now synonymised
taxa [21,83].

Conclusion
The present study shows paraphyly in the genus Papio and
discordance between baboon morphology and mitochondrial phylogeny. Accordingly, a classification of baboons
based on mitochondrial sequence data is inappropriate.
However, the geographic distribution of haplogroups provides insights into the evolutionary history of baboons
and emphasizes the possible role of introgressive hybridization. Periodical isolation of populations and subsequent range overlap, most likely triggered by climatic
changes, might have led to a gradual hybridization influencing baboon diversification and speciation [6]. The
extent of introgression reaches from ongoing introgression of male olive baboon into yellow baboon population in Amboseli to the complete extinction of historical
populations or taxa in west or south-east Africa by introgression where only the former mitochondrial genome
remained as a trace in the current olive or grey-footed
chacma baboon populations. Since the evolutionary history of baboons shows some similarities with that of the
human lineage, it seems plausible that the introgression
scenario depicted herein might also be an extended model
for reconstructing the evolution of Homo.
Defining the extent of the reticulate (i.e. introgressive
hybridization) events will require further molecular studies that incorporate additional samples and in particular
nuclear loci. Our study showed that collecting samples
from all over the baboon range with known provenances
is indispensable, but samples from further locations as
indicated in Figure 3, should be included in ongoing studies. The analysis of nuclear loci, however, might be hampered by the fact that nuclear sequence variation is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/83

expected to be relatively low in baboons as shown for
parts of the Y-chromosome [84].

Methods
Sample collection
Faecal material from 64 individuals representing all five
Papio species was collected from free ranging populations
at 51 sites in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula between
1995 and 2007. One additional sample (No. 559) was
provided by the Limbe Wildlife Centre, Cameroon.
Although this specimen originated from northern Cameroon, its exact provenance is not traceable. Two other
samples consisted of dry tissue from museum specimens
(No. 404: Papio cynocephalus, north-east bank of Lake
Rukwa, Tanzania, coll. no. 03-74959 Humboldt Museum,
Berlin, Germany) or of tissue preserved in ethanol (No.
507: Papio (ruhei) cynocephalus, 40 km NW of Mogadishu
at Webi Shebelli, Somalia, Zoologische Staatssammlung
München, Germany). To obtain adequate geographical
sampling, our sampling pattern covered most of the
baboon range (Figure 1) with one major gap between
Cameroon and Ethiopia, an area where only one baboon
taxon is known to occur (Papio a. anubis) [21]. The geographic coordinates of the sampling sites were determined
with GPS or, in the case of the two museum specimens,
estimated from maps (Additional file 1). One Theropithecus gelada faecal sample was collected from a zoo animal (Zoo Duisburg, Germany). Either fresh or dry faecal
material was collected. Fresh samples were preserved in
75% ethanol and dry samples in plastic tubes without any
additive. Samples were stored at ambient temperature for
up to six months before further processing.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
DNA from tissue and faecal material was extracted using
the DNeasy Blood & Tissue or QiAamp DNA Stool Mini
Kits from Qiagen. To prevent contaminations, laboratory
procedures followed described standard protocols [44,8587]. DNA extraction, PCR, gel extraction and sequencing
were performed in separate laboratories and repeated randomly after several months, in which case only one individual per species or location was tested. All PCR reactions
were performed with negative (HPLC-purified water) controls.

We amplified and sequenced two parts of the mtDNA
genome, 1) the 'Brown region' [88], which, in baboons,
comprises 457 bp of the 3' end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit IV (ND4) gene, the tRNA genes for histidine
(His), serine (Ser), and leucine (Leu), and 239 of the 5'
end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit V (ND5) gene
[36], and 2) the complete cytb gene.
The 'Brown region' (896 bp) was amplified via two overlapping fragments according to PCR conditions and prim-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:83

ers as described in Newman et al. [10]. The complete cytb
gene (1,140 bp) was also amplified via two overlapping
PCR products, each with a size of 600–700 bp. To exclude
miss-amplification of nuclear pseudogenes, primers were
selected which amplify mitochondrial fragments only in
papionins and not in any other primate group. The 5' end
portion was generated with the oligonucleotide primers
cytb1F (5'-GATACGAAAAACCATCGCTGT-3') and cytb1R
(5'-AGTAGGGATGGAAGGTGATTT-3'). For the 3' end
portion, the two primer pairs cytb2aF (5'-TTCGGCATCGTCACCCTCAC-3')/cytb2aR (5'-ATTTCTGGTTTACAAGACCAGT-3')
and
cytb2F
(5'CCTACCATTCGGCATCGTCG-3')/cytb2R
(5'-GCTCCATTTCTGGTTTACAAG-3') were used to amplify the
fragment in southern chacma baboons and in all other
papionins, respectively. PCR conditions for all cytb amplifications were identical and comprised a pre-denaturation
step at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for
1 min, 60°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and a final
extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The results of the PCR
amplifications were checked on agarose gels. PCR products were cleaned with the Qiagen PCR Purification Kit
and subsequently sequenced on an ABI 3100-Avant
sequencer using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems). All sequences were deposited at
GenBank (for accession numbers see Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
Sequences were edited and aligned using BioEdit v7.5.0.2
[89], and manually checked by eye. For further analyses,
identical sequences were removed. To exclude contaminations of the data set with pseudogenes, neighbor-joining
trees based on uncorrected distances were reconstructed
in PAUP* v4.0b10 [90] for both data sets separately, and
the depicted relationships and branch lengths compared
with each other. For all Bayesian and ML analyses, both
data sets were combined and outgroup rooted with Theropithecus gelada. After the exclusion of a 3 bp-deletion in the
ND5 gene of southern chacma baboons, the final alignment comprised 2,033 bp. Optimal nucleotide substitution models for each locus were chosen using AIC as
implemented in MODELTEST v3.7 [91]. All ML analyses
were conducted using a genetic algorithm approach
implemented in GARLI v0.951 [92]. In GARLI only the
model specifications settings were adjusted according to
the data set; all other settings were left at their default
value. Ten replicates were run to verify consistency in log
likelihood (lnL) scores and tree topologies. ML bootstrap
percentages (BP) were estimated in GARLI by performing
500 pseudoreplicate runs. PAUP* v4.0b10 [90] was then
used to calculate a majority-rule consensus tree in order to
obtain bootstrap percentages. Bayesian analyses were conducted on the concatenated data set using MrBayes v3.1.2
[93,94]. A partitioned analysis was performed treating the
cytb and 'Brown region' as separate partitions, each with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/83

their own DNA substitution models. We used four Monte
Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) with the default temperature of 0.1. Four repetitions were run for ten million generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every
100 generations. Flat priors were assumed for the model
parameters including the proportion of invariable sites
and the gamma shape parameter of rate variation among
sites. The first 25% of samples were discarded as burnin,
leaving 75,001 trees per run. The adequacy of this burnin
and convergence of all parameters were assessed by examining the uncorrected potential scale reduction factor
(PSRF) [95] as calculated by MrBayes v3.1.2 [93,94],
which should approach 1 as runs converge and by visual
inspection of the trace of the parameters across generations using the software TRACER v1.3 [96]. Posterior
probabilities (PP) for each split and a phylogram with
mean branch lengths were calculated from the posterior
density of trees using MrBayes v3.1.2 [93,94]. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using TreeEdit v1.0a10 [97]
and FigTree v1.1 [98]. For the description of the tree
topology we defined clade as a group of at least three haplotypes with a common ancestor. For single terminal haplotypes or terminal haplogroups consisting of only two
haplotypes we employed the term lineage.
Estimation of divergence time
A Bayesian MCMC method, which employs a relaxed
molecular clock approach [99], as implemented in BEAST
v1.5beta2 [100], was used to estimate divergence times. A
relaxed lognormal model of lineage variation and a Yule
prior for branching rates was assumed. For the calculation
we used the combined cytb and 'Brown region' sequences.
To reduce the computational burden during analyses we
included a subset of 18 specimens, because individuals
either shared identical mitochondrial haplotypes or were
relatively weakly differentiated. Nevertheless, we secured
that the data set comprised representative sequences of all
haplogroups. Additionally, we included our Theropithecus
gelada sequence and 8 orthologous sequences from other
primate taxa obtained from GenBank (see Additional file
1). After removing additional indels, which were present
in outgroup taxa, the final alignment for divergence age
estimations comprised 2,023 bp. The data set was partitioned into coding vs non-coding regions. The coding
regions were then further partitioned according to 1+2
and 3 codon positions and the substitution model, rate
heterogeneity and base frequencies were unlinked across
codon positions ((1+2), 3). An optimal nucleotide substitution model was chosen using AIC as implemented in
MODELTEST 3.7 [91].

As calibrations we used the divergence between human
and chimpanzee, which has been dated at 6–7 mya
[[101,102] in [103]], the divergence between orang-utan
and African ape lineages, which is estimated at 14 mya

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:83

[[104] in [105]], and the spilt between macaques and
baboons, which is conservatively estimated at 7–8 mya
[[106] in [103]].
Instead of hardbounded calibration points, we used the
published dates as a normal distribution prior for the
respective node (calibration points C1 and C2 are not
shown in Figure 4). For C1 (Pan/Homo) this translates into
a normal distribution with a mean of 6.5 mya and a standard deviation of 0.3 mya, for C2 (Ponginae/Homininae)
into a mean of 14.0 mya and a standard deviation of 0.6
mya (95% credibility interval: 13.0–15.0 mya) and for C3
(Figure 4) into a mean of 7.5 mya and a standard deviation of 0.55 mya. Since the estimation of a tree topology
was not the main aim of the analysis, we placed a monophyly constraint on the northern and southern Papio
clade, respectively, thus attaining the same general topology as assessed by the full phylogenetic analyses.
Two replicates were run for 25 million generations with
tree and parameter sampling occurring every 1,000 generations. The adequacy of a 10% burnin and convergence of
all parameters were assessed by visual inspection of the
trace of the parameters across generations using the softwares TRACER v1.4.1 [96] and AWTY [107]. Subsequently, the sampling distributions of two independent
replicates were combined using the software LogCombiner v1.5beta2 and the resulting 45,002 samples summarized and visualized using the software TreeAnnotator
v1.5beta2 and FigTree v1.2 [98]. The first two programs
are part of the BEAST package [100].
