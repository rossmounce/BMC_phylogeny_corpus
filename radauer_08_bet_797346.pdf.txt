Abstract
Background: The major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, is a member of the ubiquitous PR-10 family
of plant pathogenesis-related proteins. In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low
sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. In addition, determination of the Bet v 1 structure
revealed the existence of a large superfamily of structurally related proteins. In this study, we aimed
to identify and classify all Bet v 1-related structures from the Protein Data Bank and all Bet v 1related sequences from the Uniprot database.
Results: Structural comparisons of representative members of already known protein families
structurally related to Bet v 1 with all entries of the Protein Data Bank yielded 47 structures with
non-identical sequences. They were classified into eleven families, five of which were newly
identified and not included in the Structural Classification of Proteins database release 1.71. The
taxonomic distribution of these families extracted from the Pfam protein family database showed
that members of the polyketide cyclase family and the activator of Hsp90 ATPase homologue 1
family were distributed among all three superkingdoms, while members of some bacterial families
were confined to a small number of species. Comparison of ligand binding activities of Bet v 1-like
superfamily members revealed that their functions were related to binding and metabolism of large,
hydrophobic compounds such as lipids, hormones, and antibiotics. Phylogenetic relationships
within the Bet v 1 family, defined as the group of proteins with significant sequence similarity to Bet
v 1, were determined by aligning 264 Bet v 1-related sequences. A distance-based phylogenetic tree
yielded a classification into 11 subfamilies, nine exclusively containing plant sequences and two
subfamilies of bacterial proteins. Plant sequences included the pathogenesis-related proteins 10, the
major latex proteins/ripening-related proteins subfamily, and polyketide cyclase-like sequences.
Conclusion: The ubiquitous distribution of Bet v 1-related proteins among all superkingdoms
suggests that a Bet v 1-like protein was already present in the last universal common ancestor.
During evolution, this protein diversified into numerous families with low sequence similarity but
with a common fold that succeeded as a versatile scaffold for binding of bulky ligands.

Background
Plants are continuously challenged by pathogens, herbivores and adverse environmental conditions. Although
they lack an adaptive immune system, they have evolved
numerous other mechanisms of stress response and
defence. These include developmental plasticity, mechanical barriers, low molecular weight anti-microbial compounds named phytoalexins, pathogen-specific resistance
genes and inducible pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins.
PR-proteins were first discovered as proteins present in
tobacco plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus [1].
They were defined as proteins absent in the non-infected
plant and induced after pathogen infection or other
adverse conditions. PR-proteins are today classified into
17 families based on sequence similarity and biochemical
function [2].
An unusual PR family was designated PR-10 or intracellular PR-proteins as they are, in contrast to most PR families,
expressed in the cytoplasm. They are acidic proteins of
15–18 kDa and were first discovered in parsley and peas
in the late 1980s [3,4]. Since then, PR-10 family members
have been found in many species of higher plants ranging
from conifers to monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
angiosperms [5]. In 1989, this protein family became a
target of research in a completely different area when the
major pollen allergen of white birch (Betula verrucosa), Bet
v 1, was cloned and its sequence revealed to be similar to
PR-10 proteins (55% identity and 70% similarity to a pea
disease resistance protein) [6]. In subsequent years,
homologous allergens from pollen of related trees such as
alder and hazel as well as food allergens from fruits and
vegetables such as apple and celery were identified.
Immunoglobulin E cross-reactivity among these allergens
is responsible for the frequent occurrence of plant food
allergy among birch pollen allergic individuals, an association termed the birch-fruit syndrome [7].
In 1998, the finding that a group of proteins abundantly
expressed in the latex of opium poppy was homologous to
PR-10 proteins despite sequence identities below 25%
revealed that the PR-10 family was part of a much larger
family of plant proteins [8]. Since then, several other proteins distantly related to PR-10 proteins were described.
(S)-Norcoclaurine synthases (NCS), enzymes involved in
benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, from poppy [9]
and meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum) [10] showed
sequence identities to PR-10 proteins between 28% and
38% [10]. The sequence of a cytokinin-specific binding
protein (CSBP) from mung bean displayed 31% identity
and 45% similarity to Bet v 1 [11].
The most striking feature of the three-dimensional structure of Bet v 1 is the presence of a large hydrophobic cavity, which is open to the exterior and probably functions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

as a ligand binding site [12]. The surprising similarity of
the structure of the Bet v 1-related major cherry allergen,
Pru av 1, to that of the lipid binding domain of the human
cholesterol-binding metastatic lymph node protein 64
(MLN64) revealed the existence of a large superfamily of
mostly lipid-binding proteins with a common fold [13].
This superfamily was classified as Bet v 1-like clan in the
Pfam protein family database [PfamC:CL0209] and as Bet
v 1-like superfamily in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database [SCOP:d.129.3].
In this study, we aimed, on the one hand, to classify all
available sequences with significant similarity to Bet v 1
into subfamilies and, on the other hand, to determine all
structural Bet v 1 homologues in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) using a sensitive structural alignment tool. These
structures were classified into eleven families adding five
families to the six families included in SCOP release 1.71.
The ubiquitous taxonomic distribution of Bet v 1-like
superfamily members and their ligand binding activities
suggest that the Bet v 1 fold can be traced back to the last
universal common ancestor and that the primordial Bet v
1-like protein probably functioned as a lipid carrier.

Results and discussion
Protein families structurally related to Bet v 1
In order to expand the knowledge of Bet v 1-related structures beyond those already classified in SCOP, we performed structural alignments of representative members
of all Bet v 1-related families to all PDB entries. This search
yielded 47 structures with non-identical sequences including isoforms and engineered mutants that were classified
into 11 families (Tables 1 and 2, Additional file 1). The
structures were classified by structural similarity (defined
as the number of aligned residues) and sequence similarity by performing sequence similarity searched against the
Uniprot and Pfam databases. In addition to the six SCOP
families included in SCOP release 1.71, five new families
that contained only one or two structures were defined as
members of the Bet v 1-like superfamily.
Bet v 1 family
The family containing the highest number of structures
was the Bet v 1 family [SCOP:d.127.3.1] with 15 structures with non-identical sequences. Members of this family fold into the prototypic Bet v 1 structure with the
secondary structure arrangement β-α2-β6-α with an antiparallel β-sheet (topology 1765432) wrapped around a
long C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1A). Subfamilies of the Bet v
1 family [Pfam:PF00407] are discussed in detail below.
The PDB contained 12 structures of PR-10 subfamily
members and one structure each of a major latex protein
(MLP) and a CSBP (Additional file 1). In addition, the
structure of an uncharacterized protein from Arabidopsis
thaliana [PDB:1vjh] with distant sequence similarity to

MLPs (36% identity, 50% similarity to a Bet v 1 family
member from Brassica campestris [Uniprot:A8IXG5]) can
be classified as Bet v 1-related, although it has a large
sequence deletion resulting in the lack of two β-strands.
START family
Three structures were classified into the START family
[SCOP:d.127.3.2], named after the steroidogenic acute
regulatory (STAR) protein-related lipid transfer (START)
domain: the START domain of the human STAR-related
lipid transfer protein 3, also termed MLN64, mouse STARrelated lipid transfer protein 4, and human phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Additional file 1). The structure
of the START domain differs from the Bet v 1 structure by
an N-terminal extension consisting of an α-helix on the
outer face of the β-sheet and two additional β-strands adding to the β-sheet on the side of the N-terminal strand
(Fig. 1B). START domains occur in a wide range of diverse,

lipid-binding proteins. Pfam contained 522 sequences
from bacteria and eukaryotes matching the START family
signature [Pfam:PF01852]. The prototypic member of this
family, STAR, stimulates the transport of cholesterol from
the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it
is required as a substrate for steroidogenic enzymes [14].
Other family members include ceramide transfer proteins
[15] and phosphatidylcholine transfer proteins [16].
Multi-domain proteins that contain a START domain are
mammalian cytosolic acetyl-CoA hydrolases [17] and
some members of the HD-ZIP family of homeodomain
transcription factors from plants [18].
Ring hydroxylases α-chain
The PDB contained structures of 9 different wild-type or
mutant enzymes from the aromatic ring hydroxylase family ([SCOP:d.129.3.3]; Additional file 1). This family of
bacterial enzymes catalyses the first step in the degrada-

tion of polycyclic aromatic compounds by converting
their substrates into non-aromatic cis-dioles [19]. These
multi-component protein complexes consist of a ferredoxin reductase, a ferredoxin, and a hexameric hydroxylase with the subunit composition α3β3. The catalytic αsubunit contains an N-terminal Rieske domain with a
2Fe-2S-cluster and a C-terminal Bet v 1-like domain that
binds a ferrous ion. Their Bet v 1-like domains contain a
β-sheet extended to 9 strands and several additional helices inserted at the N and C-termini and at an internal site
(Fig. 1C). The hydroxylases are the largest family within
the Bet v 1-like superfamily with 1156 sequences recorded
in Pfam [Pfam:PF00848].
Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins
Four structures were classified into the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family ([SCOP:d.129.3.4],
Additional file 1). These eukaryotic proteins transfer
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between
membranes. Their structures differ from that of Bet v 1 by
an internal extension containing several short helices and
a β-strand parallel to the first strand of the Bet v 1-like
sheet and a C-terminal extension that comprises a second
long helix and a short stretch that closes the ligand-binding cavity in the ligand-bound conformation (Fig. 1D).
The hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket is formed by the
Bet v 1-like core. The α-helical region, known as the regu-

latory loop, contains a protein kinase C phosphorylation
site. The C-terminus can undergo large conformational
changes between a closed, ligand-bound structure, and an
open, membrane bound structure that enables phospholipid binding and release [20]. Pfam contained 104 PITP
sequences [Pfam:PF02121], most of them from animals.
Mammalian PITPs were classified by sequence similarity
into five subfamilies, three (PITPα, PITPβ, RdgBβ) containing soluble single-domain proteins and two (RdgBαI,
RdgBαII) containing large multi-domain proteins with a
PITP domain at the N-terminus [20].
AHA1 family
The activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1, p38)
interacts with the middle domain of heat shock protein 90
and stimulates its ATPase activity [21]. Its C-terminal
domain is structurally related to Bet v 1. The PDB contained structures of eight members of the AHA1 family
[SCOP:d.129.3.5], the C-terminal domain of human
AHA1 as well as one archaeal and six bacterial proteins of
unknown function (Additional file 1). The fold of the
AHA1-like domain is identical to the Bet v 1 fold except an
additional N-terminal strand present in some family
members, which pairs with the strand homologous to
strand 1 in Bet v 1 (Fig. 1E). Proteins from the AHA1 Pfam
family [Pfam:PF08327] were found in eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea with 617 sequences recorded in Pfam.

structure elements homologous to Bet v 1. L was coloured by chain position from blue (N-terminus) to red (C-terminus).
Images were generated with UCSF Chimera [61].

While the domain organisation of most eukaryotic homologues matches that of AHA1 suggesting a similar function, a wide range of diverse prokaryotic proteins with
AHA1-related domains were found in Pfam. Among those
were members of the ArsR family, a group of metallosensitive transcription repressors [22].
Polyketide cyclases
The polyketide cyclase family [SCOP:d.129.3.6] was
named after family members with polyketide cyclase and
dehydrase activity found in Streptomyces species [23]. The

PDB contained two structures of bacterial polyketide
cyclase-like predicted proteins from Caulobacter crescentus
and Thermus thermophilus (Additional file 1). Their folds
are identical to the Bet v 1 fold (Fig. 1F) despite low
sequence identities to Bet v 1 in a global alignment (16%
and 20% identity, 30% and 35% similarity). Polyketide
cyclases catalyse the cyclisation of polyketides (poly-βketo adducts of short-chain carboxylic acids) in the biosynthesis of a diverse group of compounds including pigments, antibiotics and anti-tumour drugs [24]. There are
several unrelated families of polyketide cyclases of which

Page 5 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:286

one is a member of the Bet v 1-like superfamily
[Pfam:PF03364]. Proteins from this family are ubiquitously found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes forming
the second largest family within the Bet v 1-like superfamily with 908 sequences from 449 species, most of
them proteins of unknown function, annotated in the
Pfam database. The majority of the members of this family most likely possess functions other than polyketide
synthesis as exemplified by the CoQ10 family of coenzyme Q binding proteins from yeast and mammals (e. g.
[Uniprot:Q08058], [Uniprot:Q96MF6]).
SMU440-related proteins
The structure of the predicted protein of unknown function SMU440 from Streptococcus mutans [PDB:2b79]
closely matches that of Bet v 1 (Fig. 1G), but shows only
low sequence similarity (19% identity, 33% similarity in
a global alignment). It shares 23–46% sequence identity
(38–69% similarity) with a small family of uncharacterized bacterial proteins and is classified in Pfam into a nonannotated PfamB family [PfamB:PB094079].
PA1206-related proteins
Another uncharacterized bacterial protein with a fold
identical to Bet v 1 is PA1206 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
([PDB:2ffs], Fig. 1H). It is a member of a Pfam family
[Pfam:PF08982] of proteins with unknown functions that
contained 36 sequences from bacteria and fungi.
Homotrimeric ring hydroxylases
A group of aromatic hydrocarbon hydroxylating enzymes
that includes 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida and carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase from Janthinobacterium was classified into its own
family (Additional file 1). These enzymes are homotrimers with subunits similar to the α-subunits of typical ring
hydroxylating oxygenases composed of an N-terminal
Rieske domain that binds an iron-sulphur cluster, and a
C-terminal Bet v 1-like domain [25]. In contrast to the typical oxygenases, they lack a β-subunit. Sequences of their
C-terminal domains are only distantly related to typical
oxygenases (0–17% identity, 0–31% similarity in a global
alignment of partial sequences that match the Pfam family signatures). They do not match the Ring_hydroxyl_A
family signature [Pfam:PF00848], but a non-annotated
PfamB domain [PfamB:PB024837]. Despite similar enzymatic functions, structures of members of these families
show considerable differences (compare Figs. 1C and 1I).
While the position of insertions to the Bet v 1-like core is
identical for both families (between β-strands 1 and 2,
between strands 3 and 4, and at the C-terminus), the
lengths and secondary structure contents of the insertions
differ. The C-terminal extension of regular hydroxylases
contains two β-strands that extend the sheet to a ninestranded one. In contrast, homotrimeric hydroxylases

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

contain two additional two-stranded sheets formed by the
first and second insertion.
CalC-related proteins
The protein CalC from Micromonospora echinospora confers
resistance to the enediyne antibiotic calicheamicin [26].
Enediynes are cytotoxic compounds whose binding to
DNA results in activation and oxidative cleavage of the
DNA strands. CalC was shown to bind calicheamicin with
high affinity thereby being cleaved at a specific glycine residue, a mechanism termed self-sacrifice resistance [26]. A
BLAST search yielded 86% identity (90% similarity) to a
predicted protein from the closely-related actinomycete
Salinispora arenicola and 25–36% identity (43–55% similarity) to uncharacterised bacterial members of the AHA1
family. The fold of CalC differs from the Bet v 1 fold by an
unstructured N-terminus of 30 residues and the disruption of the C-terminal helix by a non-helical region of five
residues in length (Fig. 1J).
CoxG family
The genomes of aerobic autotrophic bacteria that utilise
carbon monoxide as a carbon source contain the Cox gene
cluster that contains the genes encoding the subunits of
the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and several accessory genes. One of these, CoxG, is a member of the Bet v
1-like superfamily. The PDB contained two structures classified into the CoxG family: predicted proteins from the
bacterium Geobacillus kaustophilus and the archaeon Aeropyrum pernix (Additional file 1; Fig. 1K). Their folds are
identical to the Bet v 1 fold despite the lack of significant
sequence similarity (13% and 14% identity, 25% similarity in a global alignment). The function of the CoxG gene
product was determined by gene disruption in Oligotropha
carboxidovorans as anchoring the CO dehydrogenase to the
cytoplasmic membrane [27]. The Pfam database
[Pfam:PF06240] contained 176 sequences from bacteria
and archaea, most of them predicted proteins of unknown
function.
Sequence similarities between members of different Bet v
1-related families
Members of the Bet v 1-like superfamily from families
other than the Bet v 1-family showed sequence identities
to Bet v 1 below 25% and similarities below 40% in a global alignment (Table 2). An all-against-all comparison of
representative sequences from all Bet v 1-related families
yielded median sequence identities below 15% and
median similarities below 20% for most pairs of families
(data not shown). The families whose members showed
the highest degree of sequence similarity were the AHA1
and CalC families (18% median identity, 29% median
similarity) and the Polyketide cylcase and CoxG families
(16% median identity, 28% median similarity).

Oxysterol binding proteins – a case of convergent
evolution
The structural similarity search among all PDB entries
yielded three structures of an oxysterol-binding protein
from yeast ([PDB:1zht], [PDB:1zhy], [PDB:1zhz], Fig. 1L).
Similarly to Bet v 1-like superfamily members, this protein contains a binding pocket for steroid ligands formed
by a long α-helix and an anti-parallel β-sheet. However,
the topology of this structure is different with its α-helix at
the N-terminus and the β-strands connected in sequential
order. The existence of this fold suggests that the structural
motif of an anti-parallel β-sheet wrapped around a long αhelix is a structurally stable solution of the evolutionary
challenge of developing a large, hydrophobic pocket for
lipid binding.
Taxonomic distribution of Bet v 1-related families
Table 3 summarises the taxonomic distribution of Pfam
families determined to be members of the Bet v 1-like
superfamily. The two most widely distributed families are
the polyketide cyclase family with 908 sequences from
449 species and the AHA1 family with 617 sequences
from 252 species. These families are the only ones distributed in all three superkingdoms. Other widely distributed
families are the ring hydroxylases and the CoxG family in
bacteria and archaea and the START family in bacteria and
eukaryotes. Two large families are confined to eukaryotes,
the Bet v 1 family, whose members are found exclusively
in plants, and the phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins.
Several bacterial families are distributed only among a
small number of species which suggests that these proteins developed from a primordial Bet v 1-like gene by
adopting a specialised function as exemplified by the antibiotic resistance protein CalC.
Ligand binding activities
The most distinctive feature of the Bet v 1 fold is a large
solvent accessible hydrophobic cavity, which may function as a ligand binding site. In Table 4, experimentally
determined ligands of Bet v 1-like superfamily members
are shown. Most ligands can be classified as bulky and
hydrophobic.

The highest diversity of ligand binding activities was
shown for members of the Bet v 1 family. The first biochemical activity proposed for PR-10 proteins was as ribonuclease. RNase activity was first shown for PR-10
proteins from ginseng [28] and later demonstrated for a
number of PR-10 family members including Bet v 1 [2932]. A possible nucleic acid binding function was supported by the fact that the most conserved part in the
sequences of PR-10 proteins is a glycine-rich loop
between strands 2 and 3 [12], a so-called P-loop that is frequently found in nucleotide-binding proteins [33]. However, the conformation of the glycine-rich loop differs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

from the canonical P-loop structure and the biological significance of the in vitro RNase activity remains controversial [34].
The determination of the crystal structures of PR-10 proteins and their similarities with the START domain
prompted researchers to search for ligands fitting into the
hydrophobic cavity. A binding activity to the plant steroid
hormones brassinosteroids was experimentally determined for Bet v 1 and Pru av 1 [13,35]. A different group
of plant hormones, the cytokinins, was shown to bind to
Bet v 1 [36,37] as well as to a cytokinin-binding protein
from mung bean distantly related to PR-10 [11] and a Bet
v 1 homologue from the moss Physcomitrella patens [38].
Ligand binding activities of Bet v 1 were extensively examined. In addition to brassinosteroids and cytokinins, the
protein was shown to bind flavonoids and fatty acids
[36,37]. The Bet v 1 family also contains two groups of
enzymes. Hyp-1, a PR-10 from St. John's wort (Hypericum
perforatum), catalyses the condensation of two molecules
of emodin to the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin
[39]. (S)-Norcoclaurine synthases catalyse the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to
(S)-norcoclaurine, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as morphine
[9,10].
The types of ligands most frequently determined to bind
other Bet v 1-like superfamily members were membrane
lipids (Table 4). Binding of cholesterol, phospholipids
and ceramide was shown for members of the START and
PITP families. A group of uncharacterised eukaryotic proteins from the polyketide cyclase family were annotated in
the Uniprot database as binding to coenzyme Q. A function related to membrane lipid binding is binding to
membranes, which is part of the biological activity of
START and PITP family members, but was also shown for
Bet v 1 [40]. CoxG from Oligotropha carboxidovorans
anchors the CO dehydrogenase to the cytoplasmic membrane [27].
Many bacterial Bet v 1-related proteins exert highly specialised functions such as biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites, degradation of aromatic compounds, and
antibiotic resistance (Table 4). The structures of several
Bet v 1-related prokaryotic proteins were determined in
the course of structural genomics project. Hence the biologic function of these proteins remains to be elucidated.
Collection of a set of non-redundant Bet v 1-related
sequences
In order to gain a deeper insight into evolutionary relationships within the Bet v 1 family, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences with significant
similarity to Bet v 1. The Pfam database (version 22.0, July

Table 3: Taxonomic distribution of Bet v 1-related Pfam families.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:286

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

2007) listed 383 non-fragment sequences as members of
the Pathogenesis-related protein Bet v I family
[Pfam:PF00407]. BLAST database searches with representative members of already known subfamilies yielded 42
additional entries not listed in Pfam adding up to 425 different Bet v 1-related sequences. This data set contained a
large number of groups of highly similar isoforms and
variants from the same species. Thus, the redundancy of
the data set was reduced by deleting all sequences with
more than 90% identity to any other sequence leaving
221 entries.
Among those, a PR-10-like protein from the moss Physcomitrella patens [Uniprot:Q9AXI3] and two genomic
sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana [Uniprot:Q9SSK9],
[Uniprot:Q0WLG8] contained two and one Arabidopsis
sequence [Uniprot:Q9LQT7] contained four Bet v 1related domains. These proteins were split into their constituting domains. Seventeen sequences that contained
large deletions were removed from the data set. The final
dataset contained 210 sequences or domains.
The data set contained a single sequence from outside the
plant kingdom, the genomic sequence Mlr1698 from the
bacterium Rhizobium loti [Uniprot:Q98K03]. In order to
identify further bacterial Bet v 1 homologues, a BLAST
search with this sequence was performed, which yielded
96 hits before and 58 sequences after reduction of redundancy using a sequence identity threshold of 90%. This
data set included three plant sequences. Due to the low
sequence identity between bacterial and plant sequences
(3–23% identity, 5–43% similarity to Bet v 1; Table 5),

both the plant and the bacterial data set were aligned separately.
Identification of subfamilies in the Bet v 1 family
Two data sets containing 210 and 58 sequences or
domains were aligned and distance-based phylogenetic
trees were constructed (Figs. 2, 3, 4). No bootstrap analysis could be performed due to the fact that about one third
of the bootstrapped data sets resulted in infinite distances
for some sequence pairs while the original alignment did
not. However, the branches that connected different subfamilies in the tree were generally much longer than the
branches within each subfamily, thus rendering the identification of subfamilies straightforward (Figs. 2 and 4).

Eleven subfamilies of the Bet v 1 family were identified
(Table 5, Additional file 2). Plant sequences were classified into nine, bacterial sequences into two subfamilies.
The only sequence outside these taxa was the genomic
sequence DDBDRAFT_0168344 from the slime mould
Dictyostelium discoideum [Uniprot:Q550X0], which clustered with bacterial sequences (bold in Fig. 4). Members
of all plant subfamilies but the polyketide cyclase-like
subfamily matched the Bet v 1 family signature
[Pfam:PF00407]. The bacterial polyketide cyclase/Bet v 1
subfamily showed no clear match with any Pfam family:
some members were related to the Bet v 1 family, others
could be aligned with the polyketide cyclase family signature [Pfam:PF03367] or the signature of a domain of
unknown function [Pfam:PF05079]. However, the alignment scores were in most cases below the Pfam gathering
thresholds.

Dicot PR-10 subfamily
The largest subfamily was the dicot PR-10 subfamily with
97 members in the non-redundant data set (Fig. 3A). This
group contained two types of proteins: genuine PR-proteins whose expression is upregulated upon pathogen
infection, wounding or by abiotic stress, and PR-like proteins whose expression is developmentally regulated
(reviewed in [5]). Many proteins from the latter group are
expressed in high amounts in pollen, seeds, fruits, or vegetative storage organs. A striking example for this type of
PR-like proteins is ocatin [Uniprot:Q8W2B4], the major
storage protein of the tubers of the South American crop
oca (Oxalis tuberosa), which accounts for 40–60% of the
total soluble protein content of the tubers [41]. PR-10
proteins are members of small multigene families. However, most PR-10 isoforms cluster exclusively with homologues from the same plant family (Fig. 3A), which can be
explained either by proposing multiple independent
duplication events in the common ancestors of these

plant families or, more probably, by the assumption of a
strong concerted evolution of PR-10 loci within each species. A similar conclusion was drawn in a previous publication based on phylogenetic analysis of the much
smaller number of PR-10 sequences known at that time
[42].
PR-10 from monocots and conifers
PR-10 proteins from monocots and conifers are closely
related to dicot PR-10 proteins, both with respect to
sequence similarity and function. Sequences from monocots were divided into two protein subfamilies, one
restricted to cereals and one that contained members from
Poaceae and from other plant families such as Asparagaceae and Liliaceae (Fig. 2).
Subfamilies related to PR-10
Two small subfamilies were more distantly related to PR10 (Table 5): the cytokinin-specific binding proteins

(CSBP) and the (S)-norcoclaurine synthases (NCS). Members of the CSBP subfamily, which is restricted to legumes,
bind the plant hormone cytokinin [43], an activity that
has also been shown for some members of the PR-10 subfamily [36]. Proteins with NCS activity were found in
Thalictrum flavum [10] and in opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) [9]. Two additional poppy proteins [Uniprot:Q4QTI9], [Uniprot:Q4QTJ0] as well as a protein
from Coptis japonica [Uniprot:A2A1A1], a plant closely
related to T. flavum, have been designated PR-10 but
showed close similarities with NCS.
MLP/RRP subfamily
The second largest subfamily among plant proteins is the
major latex protein/ripening-related protein (MLP/RRP)
subfamily with 60 members, 31 of them from Arabidopsis
thaliana (Fig. 3B). The other 29 sequences distribute into
only 21 species from dicots (26 sequences from 18 species) and monocots (3 sequences from 3 species). Members of this subfamily were first described as proteins
abundantly expressed in the latex of opium poppy
(Papaver somniferum) [44]. Most members of the MLP/RRP
subfamily are expressed in fruits with their expression
upregulated during ripening. Examples are a ripeninginduced protein from wild strawberry [45], Csf-2 from
cucumber [46] and Sn-1 from bell pepper, whose expression can also be induced by wounding in unripe fruits
[47]. A wound-induced transcript from Mesembryanthemum crystallinum [Uniprot:O65178] also belongs to this
subfamily. The expression of the tobacco cDNA FB7-4 is
induced during flower formation [48]. The biological
function of the MLP/RRP proteins is still unknown, but
the expression patterns suggest a role in defence or stress
response.
Moss PR-10
The only Bet v 1-related protein found in plants other
than Spermatophyta, a protein from the moss Physcomitrella patents containing two Bet v 1 domains [38]
shows highest similarity to the MLP/RRP subfamily (Fig.
2). Three divergent angiosperm MLP-like sequences cluster with the P. patens domains, but contain only a single
domain.
Polyketide cyclase-like subfamily
A group of plant proteins distantly related to PR-10 as well
as MLPs (10–17% identity, 21–32% similarity to Bet v 1;
12–20% identity, 23–33% similarity with poppy MLP-15)
matched the Pfam Polyketide cyclase family signature
[Pfam:PF03364]. This subfamily contains uncharacterized
genomic sequences from tobacco, Arabidopsis thaliana and
Medicago trunculata (Fig. 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

Bacterial Bet v 1-like subfamilies
Bacterial Bet v 1-related sequences were grouped into two
subfamilies (Fig. 4), the major one distantly related to the
Pfam Bet v 1 as well as Polyketide cyclase families, the
minor group, which comprised only two sequences, not
matching any Pfam family. Most of the bacterial
sequences were derived from uncharacterized genomic
clones. One exception is the periplasmic 17 kDa protein
MxaD from the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens. This protein enhances the rate of methanol oxidation by stimulating the interaction between
methanol oxidase and its electron acceptor, cytochrome cL
[49].

The distant sequence similarity between plant and bacterial members of the ubiquitous polyketide cyclase family
and Bet v 1 family members suggests that the Bet v 1 family evolved from the polyketide cyclases in plants as a
response to specialized needs of higher plants with respect
to development, stress response, defence, and secondary
metabolism. No clear connection between sequence and
function was detected with the exception of the NCS subfamily whose members show a common function. In contrast, hormone binding activity was found for members of
the PR-10 and CSBP families as well as for a MLP-like
moss protein. Similarly, developmentally regulated, pathogen-induced and tissue-specific constitutive expression
patterns are equally distributed among members of the
PR-10 and MPL/RRP subfamilies with no correlation
between phylogenetic relationship and function. Thus,
the elucidation of the evolution of the Bet v 1 family will
require the identification and functional characterisation
of additional Bet v 1-related proteins from plants outside
the Spermatophyta.

Conclusion
A comparison of the structures, functions and taxonomic
distributions of members of the Bet v 1-like superfamily
leads to the suggestion of the following evolutionary scenario (Fig. 5). A protein possessing the Bet v 1 fold most
likely already existed in the last universal common ancestor. The biological function of this protein was probably
related to lipid binding, such as trafficking of membrane
components. This primordial gene subsequently diverged
into the multitude of Bet v 1-related protein families
present today, some of which retained the original fold,
while others gained novel function by insertion of additional structural elements (Fig. 5, bottom half). The ubiquitous distribution of the polyketide cyclase family and
the fact that the structures of its members comprise the
minimal Bet v 1 fold without insertion of additional structural elements (Fig. 5) suggest that these proteins are most
closely related to the primordial Bet v 1-like protein. Functional diversity within the Bet v 1-like superfamily was
also accomplished by fusion to other domains such as

DNA binding modules of transcription regulators found
as members of several Bet v 1-related families.
During evolution, sequence similarity between members
of different families decreased to values that make the prediction of homology unreliable. However, it is unlikely
that this fold with the distinctive topology of the β-sheet
has evolved more than once. Nevertheless, an architecture

characterised by an anti-parallel β-sheet wrapped around
a long α-helix forming a large cavity was invented at least
twice during evolution of lipid binding proteins. Our
structural similarity search showed that a family of oxysterol binding proteins adopts a fold similar to Bet v 1 at
first sight, but with a different topology.

An intriguing aspect of the evolution of the Bet v 1-like
superfamily is the evolution of allergenicity. Bet v 1 from
birch pollen and possibly its close homologues from
other Fagales tree pollen are the only proteins within this
ubiquitously distributed superfamily known to be capable of initiating an allergic immune response in humans
[50]. This rare occurrence of allergenicity is in sharp contrast to the distribution of allergens within the most
important superfamily of allergens, the prolamins, in
which numerous families of allergens were identified,
such as the 2S albumins, prolamin storage proteins, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins, bifunctional inhibitors,
indolines, and α-globulins [50,51]. Among the still
unknown factors that render a protein allergenic, structural features are frequently discussed. Hence, the comparison of Bet v 1 with its non-allergenic structural
homologues offers the possibility to shed light on such
features, thus paving the way for a deeper understanding
of the allergic sensitisation process and the development
of novel concepts for prevention and treatment of allergy.

Methods
Search for structural homologues of Bet v 1
The structural superfamily of which Bet v 1 is a member
has been defined in the SCOP database version 1.71 [52]
as the Bet v 1-like superfamily [SCOP:d.129.3]. Its member families were used as a starting point for the search for
Bet v 1-related structures. An all against all structural
alignment within each family yielded a representative
structure for each family. Subsequently, each representative structure was compared to the complete PDB database. All structural comparisons were performed with
psc++, an improved version of the ProSup structural alignment programme [53]. During the structural alignment,
the programme maximises the number of aligned backbone atoms while confining the root mean square distance (RMSD) of the aligned residues to values below 3.0
Å. The results of the PDB searches were sorted by the
number of aligned residues.

All structures with more than half of their residues aligned
with one of the query structures were manually classified
into structural families using a combination of several criteria. (1) A Bet v 1-like topology of the structure was confirmed by visual inspection. (2) The structural similarities
to the query structures were compared with respect to the
number of aligned residues. (3) Sequence similarity to
members of known protein families was checked using a
BLAST search against the PDB with an expect value threshold of 10-3. If the BLAST search yielded no significant
result, the sequence was compared with the Pfam database (version 22.0, July 2007) using the sequence search
tool provided on the Pfam website [54]. Alignment scores
above the Pfam gathering thresholds were counted significant.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/286

Sequence comparison among Bet v 1-like superfamily
members
Sequence identities and similarities of Bet v 1-like superfamily members to Bet v 1 were determined using the global sequence alignment programme Needle from the
EMBOSS package provided by the Center of Integrative
Bioinformatics, University of Vienna, Austria. After
matching structural families with sequence-based families
of the Pfam database (version 22.0, July 2007, [55]), partial sequences matching the Pfam hidden Markov models
(HMMs) were downloaded from the Pfam website and
aligned with partial sequence 1–155 of Bet v 1 [Uniprot:P15494]. For an all-against-all comparison of
sequences from different Bet v 1-related families, HMMmatching partial sequences of representative members of
each family (those sequences that were used to construct
the Pfam family seed alignment) were downloaded from
the Pfam website. For each pair of families the median
sequence identities and similarities were calculated.
Compilation of Bet v 1-related sequences
The starting point for the collection of Bet v 1-related
sequences were the non-fragment Uniprot entries that
were classified as members of the Pathogenesis-related
protein Bet v I family [Pfam:PF00407] in the Pfam database (version 22.0, July 2007, [55]). A provisional alignment and a neighbour-joining tree were generated using
ClustalX 1.83 [56] and visualised using MEGA 4 [57].
Representative sequences from different subfamilies identified in this tree were used as queries for BLASTP similarity searches within non-fragment sequences from the
Uniprot database [58] in order to find additional
sequences not included in Pfam. An expect value threshold of 10-3 was used.

Redundancy within the resulting sequence set was
reduced by removing all sequences with identity above
90% to any other sequence using the remove redundancy
tool located at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics [59].
Long sequences were compared to the Pfam database and
split into single domains if they contained multiple Bet v
1-related domains. Short sequences that matched only
one of the Bet v 1 fragment HMMs provided by the Pfam
database were removed from the list. A second provisional
alignment of the remaining sequences was manually
inspected and sequences that contained large (> 10 residues) deletions compared to the majority of closelyrelated sequences were removed.
Bacterial homologues of Bet v 1 were identified by a
BLASTP search with the genomic sequence Mlr1698 from
Rhizobium loti [Uniprot:Q98K03], the only bacterial
sequence found by BLASTP searches with plant sequences.
Redundancy reduction was performed as described above.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
building
Plant and bacterial sequences were aligned separately
using ClustalX with default parameters. The resulting
alignments were truncated on the N and C-terminal ends
up to the first columns in which the majority of the
sequences contained a residue. Pairwise distance matrices
applying the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid
replacement were calculated using the programme Protdist from the PHYLIP 3.67 package [60]. Distance-based
trees using the method of Fitch and Margoliash were calculated using the PHYLIP programme Fitch with the global search option activated. The trees were visualised
using MEGA 4 [57].

Sequence identities and similarities of Bet v 1 family
members to Bet v 1 [Uniprot:P15494] were determined
using the global sequence alignment programme Needle
from the EMBOSS package provided by the Center of Integrative Bioinformatics, University of Vienna, Austria.
