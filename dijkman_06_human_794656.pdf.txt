Abstract
Background: The genome of coronaviruses contains structural and non-structural genes,
including several so-called accessory genes. All group 1b coronaviruses encode a single accessory
protein between the spike and envelope genes, except for human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. The
prototype virus has a split gene, encoding the putative ORF4a and ORF4b proteins. To determine
whether primary HCoV-229E isolates exhibit this unusual genome organization, we analyzed the
ORF4a/b region of five current clinical isolates from The Netherlands and three early isolates
collected at the Common Cold Unit (CCU) in Salisbury, UK.
Results: All Dutch isolates were identical in the ORF4a/b region at amino acid level. All CCU
isolates are only 98% identical to the Dutch isolates at the nucleotide level, but more closely related
to the prototype HCoV-229E (>98%). Remarkably, our analyses revealed that the laboratory
adapted, prototype HCoV-229E has a 2-nucleotide deletion in the ORF4a/b region, whereas all
clinical isolates carry a single ORF, 660 nt in size, encoding a single protein of 219 amino acids,
which is a homologue of the ORF3 proteins encoded by HCoV-NL63 and PEDV.
Conclusion: Thus, the genome organization of the group 1b coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, PEDV
and HCoV-229E is identical. It is possible that extensive culturing of the HCoV-229E laboratory
strain resulted in truncation of ORF4. This may indicate that the protein is not essential in cell
culture, but the highly conserved amino acid sequence of the ORF4 protein among clinical isolates
suggests that the protein plays an important role in vivo.

Background
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA
viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae [1]. The
genomic RNA is 27 – 32 Kb in size, capped and polyadenylated. The virions are 80 – 150 nm in diameter and have
a unique morphology, with extended, petal-shaped spikes
that give the virus a crown-like projection (Latin; corona)
under the electron microscope [1]. CoVs are classified into
three groups based on phylogenetic and serological relationships. Group 1 and 2 consist of different mammalian
coronaviruses, whereas bird viruses dominate group 3. All
coronaviruses employ a common genome organization
where the replicase gene encompasses the 5'-two thirds of
the genome and is comprised of two overlapping open
reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. The structural
gene region, which covers the 3'-third of the genome,
encodes the canonical set of structural protein genes in the
order 5'-spike (S) – envelope (E) – membrane (M) and
nucleocapsid (N) – 3'. Expression of the replicase gene is
mediated by translation of the genomic RNA that gives
rise to the biosynthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a
(encoded by ORF1a) and pp1ab (encoded by ORF1a and
ORF1b using a ribosomal frameshift at the ORF1a/1b
junction). Expression of the structural gene region is
mediated via discontinuous transcription of subgenomic
(sg) mRNAs, a hallmark of coronavirus gene expression.
The number of sg mRNAs produced by a particular coronavirus usually exceeds the number of encoded structural
proteins and, consequently, coronaviruses are able to
express additional, so-called – accessory – genes (formerly
called group-specific genes). These genes are interspersed
between the structural genes and their number and location varies within coronavirus genomes. The functions of
coronavirus accessory proteins are largely unknown, however, reverse genetic analyses of Mouse Hepatits Virus
(MHV) and Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) suggest that they are not required for virus replication [2-4].
Moreover, deletion of MHV and FIPV accessory genes
results in attenuation in their respective hosts, indicating
that accessory genes represent pathogenicity factors [2-4].
The group 1 coronaviruses can be divided into the two
genetic subgroups 1a and 1b [5]. Members of group 1a
include canine coronavirus, FIPV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and ferret enteric coronavirus. Group
1b includes porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV),
human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human
coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). All members of group
1b encode one or two accessory proteins between the S
and E gene, ORF3 protein for PEDV and HCoV-NL63, and
ORF4a and ORF4b proteins for HCoV-229E (Figure 1).
The numbering of the ORFs in HCoV-229E is based on
Northern blot analysis of sg RNAs [6]. The presence of an
additional sg mRNA in HCoV-229E-infected cells (i.e. sg
mRNA3) shifts the numbering from ORF3 to ORF4a/b.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/106

However, the location of HCoV-229E ORFs 4a and 4b
genes in the genome (i.e. between S and E) and sequence
similarities to the group 1b ORF3 genes strongly support
the notion that they are homologous. Unfortunately, very
little information is currently available about the structure
and function of the ORF3 proteins. Several studies have
linked the ORF3 protein of PEDV and TGEV to viral infectivity and pathogenicity [7,8]. PEDV and TGEV acquire
truncated forms of their accessory proteins after extensively passaging in cell culture, and these laboratoryadapted strains, encoding truncated forms of ORF3-proteins, are less pathogenic than the corresponding wildtype strains (Figure 1) [7,8].
HCoV-229E contains two ORFs, ORF4a and ORF4b
between the S and E genes (Figure 1). Since both genes
share the same sg mRNA (i.e. sg mRNA4), the expression
of gene 4b would require alternative mechanisms of translation, such as internal entry, leaky scanning, or translational reinitiation of ribosomes. However, comparison of
the hydrophobic domains of both ORF4 parts with the
single ORF3 homologs indicates that they encode a similar protein [9], suggesting a scenario in which HCoV-229E
acquired an out-of-frame insertion or deletion. It should
be noted that the origin of full-length genomic sequences
of the group 1b coronaviruses PEDV and HCoV-NL63 are
derived from clinical isolates, CV777 and Amsterdam-1,
Amsterdam-057 and Amsterdam-496, respectively. In
contrast, the HCoV-229E ORF4a/b sequence [10] and the
HCoV-229E full-length genomic sequence [6] has been
determined from a cell culture-adapted virus more than
30 years after the initial isolation of HCoV-229E by
Hamre and Procknow [11]. We, therefore, hypothesized
that HCoV-229E ORFs 4a/b might actually had been a single ORF that was truncated upon adaptation of HCoV229E to cell culture.

Results
Analysis of HCoV-229E cell culture adapted virus
We first analyzed the ORF 4a/b region of VR-740™, a cell
culture-adapted virus that also originates from the initial
HCoV-229E clinical isolate and which was deposited at
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 1973.
The ORF4a/b sequence of VR-740™ showed an overall
99% similarity at the nucleotide level with the published
sequence of the cell culture-adapted HCoV-229E, and we
detected only one single amino acid substitution in each
protein (ORF4a protein; aa 94 Y>D, ORF4b protein; aa 36
F>L). Still, like the cell culture-adapted HCoV-229E, VR740™ encodes two ORFs between the S and E genes (Figure 2).
Analysis of current clinical HCoV-229E isolates
The apparent identity of the ORF4a/b region in both cell
culture-adapted viruses prompted us to elucidate this

region in clinical HCoV-229E isolates, of which no
ORF4a/b sequence data is available thus far. We therefore
studied nose/throat swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate
materials from 5 patients that were tested positive for
HCoV-229E. The clinical symptoms of the HCoV-229Einfected patients were similar to those that are commonly
observed for HCoV-229E infections, with symptoms like
rhinorrhoea, fever and malaise (Table 1) [12]. RT-PCR
sequencing analysis of the ORF4a/b region revealed an
overall nucleotide similarity of 97% of the Dutch clinical
isolates to that of the cell culture-adapted viruses. Of most
interest is the presence of a 2-nucleotide deletion, within
the ORF4a gene of the cell culture-adapted viruses when
aligned to the Dutch isolates. Strikingly, this Thymidine
and Guanosine deletion at position 395–396 is absent in
all clinical isolates. Deduced protein sequences encoded
by ORF4a and ORF4b from the published HCoV-229E
sequence, the sequence of VR-740™, determined in this
study, and the sequences of the 5 clinical isolates were
aligned. This reveals that clinical isolates encode a single,
uninterrupted ORF between the S and E genes (Figure 2).
This single accessory gene is 660 nucleotides in length and
encodes an ORF4 protein that is 219 amino acids in size,

with a high similarity of the N- and C-terminal domains
with ORF4a (93%) and ORF4b (96%), respectively. All
Dutch sequences have the same amino acid sequence (Figure 2), but some silent mutations were observed at the
nucleotide level, excluding the possibility of PCR contamination.
Analysis of early HCoV-229E isolates
Although our data suggest that the deletion in the laboratory HCoV-229E strain and VR-740™ is the result of cell
culture-adaptation, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the deletion might represent natural variation between
different HCoV-229E isolates. Since the VR-740™ virus
was deposited at the ATCC in 1973, HCoV-229E might
have evolved over the years and current clinical isolates
may thus differ from the prototype. Alternatively, the
Dutch clinical isolates may represent a subgroup of
HCoV-229E, and VR-740™-like clinical isolates may exist
as a second HCoV-229E subgroup. To investigate whether
the 2-nucleotide deletion is also present in isolates that
are more related to VR-740™, we searched for other early
HCoV-229E isolates. We were able to retrieve three early
isolates that were originally collected at the common cold

unit (CCU), Salisbury, UK. Two of these are laboratoryadapted viruses of which it is unknown in which extend
they were passaged. HC-LP was initially isolated in 1965
[13] and HC-Killick in the eighties [14]. The third sample,
CCU-T935, was obtained from an infected person that
participated trial T935 in 1986, of which unfortunately all
data were lost. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the
sequences of ORF4a/b from the three early isolates were
indeed more related to the cell culture-adapted, prototype
viruses (98 – 99%) than to the current Dutch isolates
(98%) (Figure 2 and 3). Most importantly, however, the
early isolate sequences of CCU-T935 and HC-Killick, like
those derived from the clinical isolates, do not contain the
2-nucleotide deletion, but carry the uninterrupted ORF
between S and E. Interestingly, HC-LP does not have this
particlar 2-nucleotide deletion, instead, a larger (118 nt)

deletion was observed that is located halfway the ORF4a
region (Figure 2).

Discussion
Hypothetically, an ORF4b protein could be translated via
alternative translation mechanisms, as described for some
other coronavirus proteins [15,16], but those mechanisms have not been described for this region, nor has any
evidence for the expression of HCoV-229E ORF4b protein
ever been reported. In addition, our results show that a
large fragment is deleted in the cell-culture adapted HCLP virus, which corresponds with the ORF4b region of the
prototype virus. As mentioned previously, it has been
shown for MHV and FIPV that accessory genes are dispensable for virus growth in cell culture. Moreover, the deletion of accessory genes resulted in these cases in viruses
that are attenuated in vivo. Similarly, attenuation of in

vivo viral infectivity and pathogenicity has been linked to
ORF3 truncation upon in vitro culturing of other group 1b
coronaviruses. For a virulent PEDV strain this occurred
after 40 passages, and more severe truncation and attenuation was observed after 60 or more passages [7]. Similar
results have been reported for TGEV after at least 35 passages [8]. Unfortunately, no detailed information is available about the in vitro passaging of the cell cultureadapted HCoV-229E strains. It is tempting to speculate
that ORF4 of HCoV-229E, like ORF3 of PEDV, is vital for
efficient in vivo replication. The fact that VR-740™ contains a truncated ORF4 may explain why this virus replicates in vitro in murine cells expressing HCoV-229E
receptor (human CD13), but not in vivo in the human
CD13 transgenic animals [17,18]. It is of interest to investigate whether an HCoV-229E strain with a more severe
truncated or a non-truncated ORF4 gene can replicate in
these mice.
Accompanied with the deletions, we also observed several
non-silent nucleotide differences between the cell cultureadapted viruses and the clinical isolates. In our Dutch isolates the ORF4 is highly conserved on the protein level.
The CCU T935 isolate that was collected in 1986 at the
CCU, Salisbury, is a clinical isolate with high ORF4 similarity to the cell culture-adapted viruses. Since we cannot
reconstruct the experimental setting performed during the
clinical trail T935 at the CCU in 1986, we cannot exclude
the possibility that the CCU T935 sample was obtained
from a volunteer inoculated with an HCoV-229E laboratory strain. This strain might even have the same origin as
the cell culture-adapted viruses [11]. In any case, the CCU
T935 sample is derived from an "in vivo" infection, be it
experimental or natural, and this further supports a relevant in vivo function of HCoV-229E full-length ORF4
protein. We believe that the divergence between the current Dutch isolates and the early CCU T935 strain most

likely represents genetic drift over 20 – 30 years of evolution [19]. Molecular clock analysis with the average mutation rate of coronaviruses [20,21] supports this idea (data
not shown). Given the long time of evolution the differences between the CCU T935 and Dutch isolates are
remarkably small. For HCoV-NL63 we also observed a
highly conserved ORF3 among different clinical isolates
[22], and although for PEDV limited sequence data are
available, Song et al. found only one nucleotide difference
in ORF3 between two PEDV field isolates [7].
Recently, Tang et al. reported on novel bat coronaviruses
(Bt-CoVs), of which several cluster with group 1b coronaviruses. They determined the full-length genomic
sequence of one of these wild-type Bt-CoVs (Bt-CoV/512/
2005) [23]. The genome organization of this Bt-CoV
strain is similar to that of the other group 1b members,
with the exception of one putative gene at the 3'end of the
genome. However, only one accessory protein, encoded
by ORF3, is identified between the structural genes S and
E. The ORF3 protein of Bt-CoV/512/2005 is homologous
to ORF3 proteins of PEDV, HCoV-NL63 and the ORF4
protein from our clinical HCoV-229E isolates. These data
show that all currently sequenced group 1b coronaviruses
contain one homologous accessory gene between the S
and E genes.

Conclusion
We report the first sequences of the ORF4a/b region of
clinical HCoV-229E isolates. The experimental data
strongly support the hypothesis that a separation of a formerly single ORF4 had taken place upon adaptation of
HCoV-229E to cell culture. We observed two different
types of deletions, 2 or 118 nucleotides, of the ORF4 gene
only in cell culture-adapted viruses whereas all clinical
isolates, including CCU T935, encoded a single ORF4
gene. Both types of nucleotide deletion within the ORF4a/

b region of cell culture-adapted HCoV-229E viruses creates a frame shift that introduces an early termination
codon, which either separates ORF4 to ORF4a and ORF4b
or results in a truncated ORF4(a) fragment (HC-LP). Most
likely, the two types of deletion occurred independently
and are not site specific. Therefore the genome organization for the group 1b coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, PEDV,
Bt-CoV and HCoV-229E) is identical. The amino acid
sequence of the HCoV-229E ORF4 protein is highly conserved among clinical isolates suggesting that the protein
plays an important role during in vivo infection.

Methods
