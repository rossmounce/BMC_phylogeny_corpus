Abstract
Background: In Drosophila melanogaster dosage compensation of most X-linked genes is mediated
by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which includes MOF. MOF acetylates histone H4 at
lysine 16 (H4K16ac). The X-linked Larval serum protein one α (Lsp1α) gene has long been known to
be not dosage compensated. Here we have examined possible explanations for why the Lsp1α gene
is not dosage compensated.
Results: Quantitative RNase protection analysis showed that the genes flanking Lsp1α are
expressed equally in males and females and confirmed that Lsp1α is not dosage compensated.
Unlike control X-linked genes, Lsp1α was not enriched for H4K16ac in the third instar larval fat
body, the tissue in which the gene is actively expressed. X-linked Lsp1α promoter-lacZ reporter
transgenes are enriched for H4K16ac in third instar larval fat body. An X-linked reporter gene
bracketed by Lsp1α flanking regions was dosage compensated. One of the genes flanking Lsp1α is
expressed in the same tissue. This gene shows a modest enrichment for H4K16ac but only at the
part of the gene most distant from Lsp1α. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the genomes
of 12 Drosophila species shows that Lsp1α is only present within the melanogaster subgroup of
species.
Conclusion: Lsp1α is not modified by the MSL complex but is in a region of the X chromosome
that is regulated by the MSL complex. The high activity or tissue-specificity of the Lsp1α promoter
does not prevent regulation by the MSL complex. The regions flanking Lsp1α do not appear to
block access by the MSL complex. Lsp1α appears to have recently evolved within the melanogaster
subgroup of Drosophila species. The most likely explanation for why Lsp1α is not dosage
compensated is that the gene has not evolved a mechanism to independently recruit the MSL
complex, possibly because of its recent evolutionary origin, and because there appears to be a low
level of bound MSL complex in a nearby gene that is active in the same tissue.

Background
X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster is achieved by doubling the transcription of most
genes on the single X chromosome in male flies [1-4]. This
dosage compensation is mediated by the male-specific
lethal (MSL) complex containing both protein and noncoding RNA components [4]. The genes encoding the MSL
proteins were identified through mutagenesis screens, in
which the mutant phenotype is male lethality (male specific lethal mutations) [5,6]. Five proteins form the core of
the MSL complex: MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE and the histone acetyl transferase MOF, which acetylates histone H4
at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) [7,8]. The acetylase activity of
MOF is essential for male viability [6]. There is considerable evidence that these proteins associate in a complex
that localises specifically to the male X chromosome [912]. The male specificity of the complex is due to MSL2,
which is negatively regulated at the translational level by
the female-specific protein SXL [13,14].
MSL1 and MSL2 are essential and sufficient for binding of
a partial complex to ~35 high affinity sites along the X
chromosome [9,12,15,16]. Two of these sites correspond
to the genes encoding the non-coding RNAs, roX1 and
roX2 (RNA on the X chromosome), which are part of the
MSL complex [17]. These RNAs are redundant, but essential for dosage compensation, although approximately
5% of male roX1 roX2 double mutants survive as adults
[18]. It has been proposed that the high affinity binding
regions constitute chromatin entry sites, at which the MSL
complex assembles prior to spreading into flanking
regions of chromatin [17]. However, chromatin entry sites
are not essential for targeting of the MSL complex [19,20].
An alternative model proposes that the MSL complex is
targeted to individual X-linked genes by uncharacterised
sequence motifs that are absent from autosomal genes
[20]. This model is supported by recent high-resolution
chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (ChIP-chip),
which found that MSL binding is gene specific [21-23].
However, autosomal genes inserted on the X chromosome can be dosage compensated [24], indicating that
bound MSL complex may be able to regulate the expression of nearby genes in the chromatin domain.
The X-linked gene Larval serum protein 1 alpha (Lsp1α)
appears to escape dosage compensation by the MSL complex [25,26]. LSP1α is an abundant protein expressed in
the fat body of third instar larvae [27], which forms a complex with autosomal LSP1 proteins to act as nutrient reservoir for pupal development [28]. LSP1α is not essential
for survival, as flies carrying mutations in all of the Lsp1
genes are viable [29]. Lsp1α could escape regulation by the
MSL complex by one of two distinct possibilities. Either, it
is flanked by boundary elements that block access of the
MSL complex or it lacks characteristics required to attract

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/35

the MSL complex, such as DNA sequences or chromatin
composition. Both of these models are supported by the
observation that the Lsp1α gene is either partially or fully
dosage compensated when relocated to two other locations on the male X chromosome [30].
In this study we examine possible explanations for why
Lsp1α is not dosage compensated.

Results

Lsp1α is flanked by dosage compensated genes
In order to determine whether Lsp1α is the only gene
within its chromosomal region to escape dosage compensation, the dosage compensation status of the genes flanking Lsp1α was examined. Previous work indicated that the
gene 5' of Lsp1α, CG2560, is dosage compensated [31].
Several other genes in the region near Lsp1α were identified after publication of the Drosophila genome sequence.

Five putative genes exist in the region immediately surrounding Lsp1α as predicted by cDNA evidence from the
Drosophila genome project [32]: CG15926, CG2560
(referred to as L12 by [31]), CG15730, CG2556 and
CG11146 (Figure 1A). Since CG11146 is separated from
Lsp1α by two intervening genes, it was not examined in
this study. The developmental stage in which Lsp1α,
CG15926, CG2560 and CG2556 are expressed was determined by Northern RNA hybridisation analysis (Figure 1B
and 1C). As expected Lsp1α is very highly expressed and
easily detected in total RNA from third instar larvae (Figure 1B). CG2560 is expressed in all larval stages, as previously reported. Four transcripts were detected for CG2556,
which is downstream of Lsp1α (Figure 1C). These transcripts are expressed differentially throughout development but importantly are present in third instar larvae.
Thus, genes 5' and 3' of Lsp1α are expressed at the same
stage of development. Transcripts from CG15730, the
gene immediately 3' of Lsp1α, were not detected at any of
the developmental stages analysed using 2 µg of poly(A)+
mRNA, or in adults using RT-PCR (data not shown). It is
possible that this intron-less gene may be expressed in
only a few cells, or may require stimuli not present under
standard conditions. Since expression could not be
detected, it was not examined further in this study.
CG15926 transcripts are present in ~2-fold higher levels in
hemisected (head plus thorax) adult males compared to
females as shown by RNase protection (data not shown),
thus the dosage compensation status of this gene could
not be determined. There were slightly higher transcript
levels of the rp49 loading control in whole adult females
than males (Figure 1C) as shown previously [33], possibly
due to strong ovarian expression. For this reason,
hemisected adults or sexed larvae were used in this study
for determining a gene's dosage compensation status.

Multi-probe quantitative RNase protection analysis was
used to determine the dosage compensation status of
CG2560 and CG2556 genes in first and third instar larvae
respectively. Control probes detected transcripts from the
X-linked dosage compensated 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgd) [34,35] and constitutive autosomal ribosomal
protein 49 (rp49) [33] genes. First instar larvae were sexed
using a stock in which only the male larvae express GFP.
Female to male CG2560 and Pgd transcript ratios were
normalised to rp49, as the 3 probes were analysed simultaneously. A female to male transcript ratio of one indicates that a gene is compensated, whereas a female to
male ratio of two suggests that a gene is not compensated.
CG2560 and Pgd have female to male transcript ratios of
1.02 ± 0.08 and 0.84 ± 0.20 respectively (Figure 1E) indicating that these genes are both dosage compensated. This
concurs with the CG2560 transcript ratios obtained in second instar larvae using an alternative method [31]. Single
probe RNase protection of CG2556 and Lsp1α was conducted in male and female y w staged-third instar larvae
relative to Pgd and rp49, as both transcripts are present at
this developmental stage (Figure 1B,C). Female to male
CG2556, Lsp1α and Pgd transcript ratios were not normalised to rp49, as the 4 probes were analysed separately due
to the similar size of the protected RNAs. Rp49 and Pgd
have female to male transcript ratios of 0.79 ± 0.27 and
0.91 ± 0.42 respectively (Figure 1F), demonstrating equivalent RNA levels are present in both sexes. CG2556 and
Lsp1α have female to male transcript ratios of 0.99 ± 0.15
and 1.81 ± 0.14 respectively (Figure 1F), indicating that
CG2556 is dosage compensated but Lsp1α is not. These
results show that two of the genes flanking Lsp1α are dosage compensated, and suggest that Lsp1α is unique within
its chromosomal domain in escaping regulation by the
MSL complex.
The regions flanking Lsp1α do not contain elements able
to block dosage compensation of an X-linked transgene
The genes flanking Lsp1α are dosage compensated, but
Lsp1α is not. One possible explanation for why Lsp1α
escapes dosage compensation is that flanking sequence
elements somehow block access of the MSL complex to
the gene. To test this possibility, the genomic regions
between Lsp1α and CG2560 (I) and between Lsp1α and
CG2556 (I2) were inserted either side of an arm-lacZ
reporter construct (I-arm-lacZ-I2). We have previously
shown that X-linked arm-lacZ transgenes are fully dosage
compensated [36,37], although it is not known if this is
due to local spreading of the MSL complex or to direct
recruitment of the complex. If the Lsp1α flanking regions
contain elements able to block access of the MSL complex,
it follows that X-linked I-arm-lacZ-I2 transgenic lines will
not be dosage compensated, and will exhibit female to
male reporter activity ratios of two. Due to the presence of
promoter sequences within the (I) region, female to male

reporter activity ratios were analysed in adult flies, in
which only the armadillo promoter is active, rather than in
third instar larvae in which both the armadillo and Lsp1α
promoter sequences are active. All autosomal and Xlinked arm-lacZ lines had female to male β-galactosidase
activity ratios of ~1 (Table 1). Both autosomal I-arm-lacZI2 lines also had female to male β-galactosidase activity
ratios of ~1. The X-linked I-arm-lacZ-I2 line exhibited a
female to male β-galactosidase activity ratio of ~1, indicating that the (I) and (I2) regions do not contain elements
able to prevent the MSL complex from binding to and
dosage compensating arm-lacZ on the X chromosome.
The precise chromosomal location of these X-linked transgenes was determined by inverse PCR. The I-arm-lacZI2:19C3 transgene has inserted between the X-linked
CG1631 and CG15462 genes that are uncharacterised with
respect to expression and are part of an approx. 140 kb
gene poor region of the chromosome (19C2 to 19C5).
The nearest genes that showed significant binding of
MSL1 and MSL3 in embryos are Rab10 (19C1) and
l(1)G0004 (19C6) that are approximately 95 kb upstream
and 45kb downstream respectively from the site of insertion of the I-arm-lacZ-I2 transgene [21,23] (Additional file
1; Panel B). The arm-lacZ:10D8 transgene has inserted in
the first intron of the X-linked inaF (CG2457) gene, which
encodes a protein with calcium channel regulator activity
involved in rhodopsin mediated signalling that is
expressed in the head and eye of adult flies [38].
Although, it has not been reported if inaF is dosage compensated, significant binding of MSL1 is detected at the 3'
end of this gene in embryos [23].
Lsp1α is not enriched for histone H4 acetylated at lysine
16 in male larval fat body nuclei
There was no binding of MSL1 or MSL3 to Lsp1α in
embryos or of MSL3 to Lsp1α in SL2 cells [21-23] (Additional file 1; Panel D). This would be the expected result
since Lsp1α is not dosage compensated. In SL2 cells, ~90%
of MSL3 binding clusters were within expressed genes,

with an enrichment in the middle and 3' end [21]. Since
Lsp1α is not actively expressed in SL2 cells it was possible
that MSL complex could be binding to Lsp1α in the tissue
in which the gene is expressed, namely third instar larval
fat body. As acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 is dependent on
the MOF component of the MSL complex, we measured
the relative level of H4K16ac on Lsp1α in larval fat body
nuclei by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Chromatin from hand-dissected male y w larval fat body was
immunoprecipitated with antibody against H4K16ac. The
X-linked, fat body-expressed Lipid storage droplet-2 (Lsd-2)
and Pgd genes showed 3 – 10 fold enrichments after
immunoprecipitation compared to the autosomal gene,
Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh), which had a relative enrichment of one (Figure 2). The differential levels
of enrichment within Pgd have been observed previously
[39]. Lsp1α exhibited no enrichment for H4K16ac, confirming the prediction that actively expressed Lsp1α would
not be acetylated by MOF as it is not dosage compensated.
Lsp1α promoter-lacZ X-linked transgenes are enriched for
H4K16ac in larval fat body
Since the majority of MSL target genes are widely
expressed [21-23], we next investigated if the Lsp1α gene
was not enriched for H4K16ac because of the high activity
and tissue specificity of its promoter. The Lsp1α gene promoter was fused to the lacZ reporter gene and two Xlinked lines containing this gene construct were obtained.
Chromatin from male Lsp1α (-573 to +20)-lacZ:9B4 and
Lsp1α (-573 to +20)-lacZ:19E7 third instar larval fat bodies
was immunoprecipitated with antibody against H4K16ac
(Figure 2). As for the y w strain, the X-linked Lsd-2 and Pgd
genes were enriched for H4K16ac. The two X-linked Lsp1α
(-573 to +20)-lacZ transgenes also showed 3-fold enrichments within lacZ. Thus the lack of enrichment of
H4K16ac within Lsp1α is not because of the tissue-specificity of the gene promoter.

There are two possible explanations for why X-linked
Lsp1α-lacZ transgenes were enriched for H4K16ac in larval

complex in third instar larval fat body, Ntf-2 is likely to be
expressed in this tissue based on mutant phenotypes [40].
That MSL complex distribution appears to remain largely
stable across development [21,22] would suggest that
MSL complex would be bound to the CG15309, CG1529
and Ntf-2 genes in larval fat body.

regions within the Pgd and Lsp1α genes. All primers are

frame with the exception of the Pgd-543 set, which is within

fat body. Either the transgenes have inserted near MSL
complex target genes or alternatively MSL complex is
directly recruited to the lacZ gene. The latter would seem
less likely as the gene is of bacterial origin and MSL complex is not recruited to autosomally integrated lacZ transgenes [37]. The Lsp1α (-573 to +20)-lacZ:9B4 transgene
has inserted in the first intron of the CG15309 gene. While
there are no MSL1 or MSL3 binding sites within CG15309,
there are clusters of sites within the closely adjacent
l(1)G0230 gene in embryos, SL2 and Clone 8 cells (Additional file 1; Panel C). The Lsp1α (-573 to +20)-lacZ:19E7
transgene has inserted between the CG1529 and Ntf-2
(CG1740) genes. There are clusters of MSL1 and MSL3
binding sites within both the CG1529 and Ntf-2 genes in
embryos, SL2 and Clone 8 cells [21,23] (Additional file 1;
Panel A). While it is not known if CG15309, CG1529 or

CG2556 is expressed in larval fat body but shows only a
moderate enrichment for H4K16ac at the 3' end
If X-linked Lsp1α-lacZ transgenes are enriched for
H4K16ac because they have inserted near MSL target
genes then why is Lsp1α not enriched for H4K16ac as the
flanking genes are dosage compensated? Since there is a
strong correlation between MSL complex binding and
gene transcription [21], one possibility is that the flanking
genes are not transcribed in third instar larval fat body.
Both CG2560 and CG2556 are expressed in third instar
larvae (Figure 1C), but their tissue distribution is
unknown. In order to determine whether CG2560 and
CG2556 are expressed in the fat body, real-time RT-PCR of
cDNA from male fat body and whole larvae was conducted on CG2560 and CG2556 relative to the fat body
specific genes Lsp1α [27] and Lsd-2 [41], and the constitutively expressed genes Gpdh and rp49. Lsp1α and Lsd-2
show 2.24 and 1.82-fold enrichments respectively in fat
body cDNA compared to whole third instar larval cDNA,
while Gpdh and rp49 show 0.78 and 0.79-fold enrichments respectively (Figure 1D). CG2560 demonstrates
0.03-fold enrichment in fat body cDNA compared to
whole third instar larval cDNA, indicating that it is not
expressed in fat body tissue. This is consistent with its proposed function as a structural component of the larval
cuticle [42] and specific expression in dorsal and ventral
epidermis in late embryos [43]. CG2556 shows 0.92-fold
enrichment in fat body cDNA compared to whole third
instar larval cDNA, indicating that it is expressed in both
this tissue and other parts of the larvae. Transcripts for the
gene immediately 3' of Lsp1α, CG15730, were not
detected in third instar larvae hence it is unlikely that the
MSL complex is targeted to this gene in fat body tissue.

Since CG2556 is also expressed in fat body we performed
ChIP experiments with isolated fat body nuclei and antiH4K16ac antibody. There was no enrichment with a 5'
UTR fragment (fold enrichment of 1.10 ± 0.09 relative to
Gpdh in y w male fat bodies). Further, the 3' UTR of
CG2556 is only moderately enriched for this histone
modification (fold enrichment of 1.93 ± 0.77 relative to
Gpdh in y w male fat bodies), suggesting MSL complex is
not present in high levels in this region of the chromosome in third instar larval fat body, although the gene is
clearly dosage compensated. The moderate enrichment of
H4K16ac at the 3' end of CG2556 is consistent with the
high-density ChIP-chip profiles that found that the MSL

end of X-linked genes [21,23].

Lsp1α has most likely evolved recently within the
melanogaster subgroup of Drosophila species
It had been suggested that Lsp1α has arisen from a duplication and translocation of an autosomal Lsp1β gene [44].
The sequencing of the genomes of twelve Drosophila species [45] allowed us to address when Lsp1α evolved. As
expected homologues of Lsp1β and Lsp1γ were found in all
Drosophila species examined. Lsp1α homologues, however, are only present in the melanogaster subgroup of species, which are thought to have descended from a
common ancestor 8 – 12 million years ago [46] (Figure
3). In these species Lsp1α lies between homologues of
CG2560 and CG15730, while in the remainder of the species these genes are immediately adjacent (including D.
ananassae, which is part of the melanogaster group but not
sub-group). Thus it would appear that Lsp1α arose relatively recently within the melanogaster subgroup of species
and so may not have yet evolved MSL binding sites. However, a tree based on maximum likelihood analysis of
LSP1 sequences (Methods) suggests that Lsp1α arose
before the divergence of Drosophila species (Figure 3). If
so, then Lsp1α has been precisely lost on at least four separate occasions (ancestor of: D. ananassae, obscura group,
willistoni group and Drosophila subgenus). More likely
some residues within LSP1α proteins may not be under
the same functional constraints as in LSP1β proteins leading to the observed divergence. The Lsp1β gene seems to
be particularly prone to duplication events as duplicated
Lsp1β genes were found in D. ananassae, D. grimshawi and
D. willistoni genome sequences (Figure 3). The two Lsp1β
genes are immediately adjacent to each other in these
three species. The maximum likelihood analysis suggests
the duplication events have occurred recently within each
of the three species.

Discussion
Lsp1α is a well characterised example of a non-dosage
compensated gene [25]. In contrast, two genes situated
less than 5 kb either side of it, are expressed equivalently
in male and female larvae. That Lsp1α escapes regulation
by the MSL complex was shown by the lack of enrichment
for H4K16ac in the tissue in which it is expressed. These
results are consistent with high-resolution ChIP-chip
studies that found that MSL complex binding was genespecific [21-23]. Further, the complex bound predominantly to constitutively expressed genes. Lsp1α is certainly
not a housekeeping gene, but rather is a gene that is very
highly expressed in a specific cell type and a specific stage
of development. Since Lsp1α is not an essential gene [29]
there would have been little evolutionary pressure to
acquire MSL binding sites since it evolved, which appears
to have been relatively recently in the melanogaster sub-

group of species. The only gene in the Lsp1α gene region
that is bound to MSL1 and MSL3 in embryos is Rab40
[21,23] (Additional file 1), which is approx. 30 kb
upstream of Lsp1α. Thus Lsp1α appears to have arisen
within a region of the X chromosome that has few strong
MSL binding sites in whole embryos.
In the two-step model for MSL complex targeting to X
chromosome genes, the complex is initially bound to
sequences of higher affinity and then spreads locally to
nearby expressed genes [17]. Such a mechanism would
explain why autosomal genes inserted onto the X chromosome can be dosage compensated [24]. According to this
model, it would be anticipated that the MSL complex
could spread locally from flanking dosage compensated
genes that are active in third instar larval fat cells to Lsp1α.
Of the two flanking dosage compensated genes, only the
downstream CG2556 gene is transcribed in third instar
larval fat cells. However, we could not detect any enrichment for H4K16ac at the 5' end and only a modest enrich-

ment for H4K16ac at the 3' end, which is ~11 kb from
Lsp1α. Thus it appears that MSL complex does not spread
to the Lsp1α gene in its normal chromatin location
because the level of complex bound to nearby active genes
in fat body nuclei is low. The ChIP-chip studies identified
several examples of neighbouring genes that have differential MSL binding profiles. It remains to be determined
if, like Lsp1α, the unbound genes are not enriched for
H4K16ac in the cells in which they are actively transcribed. If so, it would be of interest to know if these
genes, like Lsp1α [30], can respond to the MSL complex
when relocated to other locations on the X chromosome.

tions on the X chromosome [36,37], there is no binding
of the MSL complex to autosomally integrated arm-lacZ
transgenes, which are equally expressed in males and
females [37]. Thus if the arm-lacZ transgene can independently recruit MSL complex, it can only do so in an X
chromosomal environment. Clearly additional studies are
needed to identify what features of the arm-lacZ transgene
are important for recruitment of the MSL complex. The
development of site-specific integration systems for Drosophila [48,49] should greatly facilitate such studies as various gene constructs could all be tested at the same
locations on the X chromosome.

We found no evidence for boundary elements flanking
the Lsp1α gene that could prevent access of the MSL complex to an active gene. An arm-lacZ reporter gene bracketed
by sequences that flank the Lsp1α gene was fully dosage
compensated when inserted onto the X chromosome. The
MSL complex could reach the I-arm-lacZ-I2 transgene by
spreading from a nearby gene with bound complex or
could bind directly to the transgene. The I-arm-lacZ-I2
transgene inserted into a very gene poor region that is
largely devoid of bound MSL complex in embryos and
SL2 cells [21,23]. The nearest gene with significant levels
of bound complex in embryos is approx. 45 kb from the
transgene insertion site. The MSL complex can spread
hundreds of kilobases from an autosomally integrated roX
gene [17], so it is possible that the MSL complex could
spread 45kb along the male X chromosome. It is also possible that MSL complex may be bound to more genes in
this region in adults, the stage we measured β-galactosidase activity. However, while MSL complex binding pattern is not invariant, it is largely similar in distinct cell
types [21,22]. Thus, while it is clear that Lsp1α is not
flanked by sequences that prevent access of the MSL complex, we cannot conclude if this is because they fail to
block local spreading of the complex. If MSL complex
does not spread locally to the integrated arm-lacZ reporter
gene, then the transgene must independently recruit MSL
complex. This may simply be because the MSL complex
preferentially binds to expressed genes [21]. However,
transcription is not sufficient to recruit complex. Legube et
al (2006) [22] found that the promoter regions of some
MSL1 target genes are enriched in DREF binding sites. The
arm promoter has several possible DREF binding sites
(not shown). armadillo is an X-linked constitutively
expressed gene [47]. The 1.6 kb arm fragment in the armlacZ construct contains 5' flanking sequence, the two
major start sites of transcription, the first intron and start
of second exon [47]. There is significant binding of MSL1
and MSL3 to this fragment of the arm gene in embryos
and SL2 cells respectively [21,23]. Thus the arm promoter
may contribute to recruitment of MSL complex to an
actively expressed arm-lacZ transgene. While arm-lacZ
transgenes are fully dosage compensated at several loca-

Conclusion
In this study we have examined possible explanations for
why the X-lined Lsp1α gene is not dosage compensated.
Lsp1α is not enriched for H4K16ac in third instar larval fat
body, the tissue in which the gene is actively expressed.
Thus Lsp1α is not compensated because the chromatin is
not modified by the MSL complex at the gene's normal
location on the X chromosome. Lsp1α is in a region of the
X chromosome that is subject to regulation by the MSL
complex, as genes flanking and within 5 kb of Lsp1α are
dosage compensated. Lsp1α does not appear to be surrounded by sequence elements that prevent access of the
MSL complex as these flanking regions did not prevent a
reporter gene from being dosage compensated when
inserted on the X chromosome. The stage-specificity or
high activity of the Lsp1α promoter does not prevent dosage compensation because X-linked lacZ transgenes under
the control of the Lsp1α promoter were enriched for
H4K16ac in larval fat body. Only one of the genes flanking Lsp1α is expressed in the same tissue as Lsp1α and this
gene showed no enrichment for H4K16ac at its 5' end
(end closest to Lsp1α) and showed only a modest enrichment at its 3' end in larval fat body. Homologues of Lsp1α
were found only in the melanogaster subgroup of species.
The most likely explanation for why Lsp1α is not dosage
compensated is that the gene has not evolved a mechanism to independently recruit the MSL complex, possibly
because of its recent evolutionary origin, and because
there appears to be a low level of bound MSL complex in
a nearby gene that is active in the same tissue.
Recent ChIP-chip analyses have identified several
expressed X-linked genes that are not bound by the MSL
complex. The significance of this study is that we have
addressed possible mechanisms by which one such gene
escapes regulation by the MSL complex.

analysis conducted as described in [50].

366 nt for CG2560, 391 nt + 294 nt for Lsp1α, 268 nt for
CG2556, 171 nt + 43 nt for Pgd and 312 nt for rp49.

Real-time RT-PCR Assays
RNA from 10 male third instar larvae or 10 male third
instar larval fat bodies was treated with Turbo DNase
(Ambion) and reverse transcribed (Roche). Quantitative
real-time PCR was conducted in triplicate (variation
<15%) using the LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS
SYBR Green I reaction mix (Roche) in a LightCycler Instrument (Roche) on 2 µl of 10-fold or 100-fold diluted cDNA
in a 10 µl reaction volume. Information about the primers
used in this study is available upon request. An annealing
temperature of 55°C and an extension of 12 s were used.
The crossing point (CP) was automatically determined by
the LightCycler software (Roche). Fold enrichment was
determined by 2^(CP whole larvae – CP fat body). The
primer sets used were; Lsp1α (5'CTCGCTGACGGACAAC
and 5'GGGCTCAGTAAGGTCCA), Rp49 (5'CGGTTACGGATCGAACA and 5'CGATCTCGCCGCAGTAAA), Lsd-2
(5'AGTGTACTAGCCGATACG and 5'TCTGACTCCCGGATCT), CG2560 (5'ATGGCAATGCTTACGGT and
5'GAGGTGGCTGATAATCGTAG), CG2556 (5'TGGTAATGGCGGCCTAAA and 5'TGCGAGTGTTCAGCTTG), Gpdh
(5'GTGCCCGACCTGGTTGAG and 5'CTTGCCTTCAGGTGACGC).

Generation of Transgenic Fly Lines
All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out
using standard procedures [50] unless otherwise specified. The 883 bp region between Lsp1α and CG2560
including the Lsp1α promoter (I) and 4596 bp region
between the 3' end of Lsp1α and the 5' end of CG2556 (I2)
were amplified by PCR from genomic y w D. melanogaster
DNA, and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The
primer sequences used are available upon request. PstINotI and EcoRI-StuI linkers were inserted into the PstI site
3' of lacZ-SV40 and the EcoRI site 5' of armadillo in
pCaSpeR-arm-βgal (arm-lacZ) [47]. The blunt-ended NotI
(I) and NotI (I2) fragments were cloned into the StuI and
NotI sites of this plasmid respectively, generating I-armlacZ-I2. The 593 bp Lsp1α promoter (-573 to +20) was
amplified by PCR from genomic y w D. melanogaster DNA,
and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The bluntended NotI promoter fragment was cloned into the StuI
site of pCaSpeR-arm-βgal in which the EcoRI/Asp718
armadillo promoter fragment had been replaced with a
linker containing EcoRI,BamHI, NheI, StuI and Asp718
sites, generating the Lsp1α (-573 to +20)-lacZ construct.
Transgenic flies carrying these constructs were generated
from y w stock using standard procedures [52]. The site of
transgene integration was determined where possible
using inverse PCR, and all transgenic lines consist of single insertions as determined by Southern hybridisation
analysis.

Quantitative RNase Protection Assays
Quantitative RNase protection was conducted on 3 – 4
separate collections of matched female and male FM7I,
P{w [+mC]=Act GFP}JMR3/c(1)DX,y1f1 first instar larvae
or y w blue food-staged third instar larvae [51] using the
RPA III kit (Ambion). Antisense RNA probes for CG2560,
Pgd, rp49, Lsp1α and CG2556 were synthesized with T7, T3
or SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche). The relative radioactivity
of the probes was adjusted by increasing the concentration of [α-32P]CTP and decreasing the concentration of
unlabeled CTP in the reaction cocktails. Unincorporated
radionucleotide was removed with the NucAway spin column (Ambion). The CG2556 probe was gel purified (Qiagen). 3 – 10 fold molar excess of probe was added to 4 µg
(CG2560, Pgd, rp49 and Lsp1α) or 20 µg (CG2556) of
DNase-treated phenol/chloroform purified RNA and
annealed overnight with RNA in the presence of pellet
paint co-precipitant (Novagen); protected RNA probes
were detected and quantified on 5% polyacrylamide urea
gels with the Storm 860 phosphorimager (Molecular
Dynamics) or the FLA-5000 phosphorimager (Fujifilm).
The quantification value of each protected RNA species
was corrected for the background value of the sample of
yeast RNA hybridized to probe treated with RNase. The
mass of RNA used in each assay was determined to be
within the linear range of the RNase protection assay for
each protected RNA. The sizes of the protected RNAs were

β-galactosidase Assays
β-galactosidase assays were performed on hemisected
adults as described in [36]. Assays were performed in triplicate on 3 separate collections unless otherwise stated.
Means and standard deviations of activities and ratios
were calculated from the 3 separate collections.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was based on the procedures described in [53-55] with additional modifications
suggested by Edwin Smith (Emory University, 2005, personal communications). Fat bodies manually dissected
from 200 male third instar larvae were quick frozen then
ground in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 5 ml of
10 mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.6%
Triton X-100, 4 mM DTT, 10 mM sodium butyrate with
protease inhibitors (Roche). After centrifugation at 500 ×
g for 30 s at 4°C, the supernatant was stored on ice for 5
min, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at
4°C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 360 µl of
nucleus isolation buffer (NIB: 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 3 mM CaCl2, 10 mM sodium butyrate,
protease inhibitors) and incubated with formaldehyde at

a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature with shaking. Nuclei were pelleted at 1500 × g for 10
min at 4°C, resuspended in 360 µl of NIB, and pelleted.
Nuclei were resuspended in 200 µl of 1% SDS, 50 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium butyrate
with protease inhibitors for 10 min on ice, followed by
sonication in the presence of 425–600 mm acid-washed
glass beads (Sigma) for 6 × 30 s pulses at power level 1.5
(VirSonic). This sonication produced DNA fragments
with a mean size of 500 bp. The sonicated chromatin
lysate was diluted with 1.8 ml of chromatin immunoprecipitation buffer (CIB: 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 137 mM
NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
sodium butyrate) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min
at 4°C. Input DNA was purified from 200 µl of this supernatant by incubation with 10 µl 10 mg/ml RNase for 10
min at 37°C, and 20 µl 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 6 h at
37°C. Crosslinks were reversed by incubation for 6 h at
65°C. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).
The remaining 1.8 ml of sonicated chromatin lysate was
pre-incubated with 60 µl 50% Protein A Sepharose Bead
suspension (Sigma), protease inhibitors and 9 µl 10 mg/
ml salmon sperm DNA (ssDNA) for 1 h with shaking at
4°C. 6 µl of rabbit anti histone H4 (Ac16) antibody
(AHP417; Serotec) was pre-bound to 120 µl 50% Protein
A Sepharose Beads suspension in 1 ml of CIB with protease inhibitors, 10 µl 10 mg/ml ssDNA and 20 µl 10 mg/
ml BSA (NEB) for 1 h with shaking at 4°C. The pre-cleared
chromatin lysate was incubated with the pre-bound antibody-beads for 3 h at 4°C with shaking. Following this
the beads were washed successively in: 150 mM NaCl, 20
mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
0.1% SDS, 10 mM sodium butyrate; 500 mM NaCl, 20
mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
0.1% SDS, 10 mM sodium butyrate; 250 mM LiCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 10 mM sodium butyrate; TE
buffer. Beads were rinsed and suspended in TE Buffer.
Immunoprecipitated DNA (ChIP DNA) was incubated
with 1 µl 10 mg/ml RNase for 10 min at 37°C, followed
by incubation with 5 µl 10% SDS and 2 µl 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 6 h at 37°C. Crosslink reversal and DNA
purification were conducted as described for input DNA.
Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted as described
for real-time RT-PCR assays. Undiluted immunoprecipitated DNA (2 µl) and 100-fold diluted input DNA (2 µl)
were assayed with each primer set in triplicate (variation
<15%). The primer pairs used were; Lsp1α-1184
(5'CTCGCTGACGGACAAC and 5'GGGCTCAGTAAGGTCCA), Lsp1α-2439 (5'CTTCAAGTTGTAGATCTGATAACATTCCGA

(5'GCGCGAATTGAATTATGGCCC and 5'GCCATGTGCCTTCTTCCG). The Pgd and Gpdh primer sets are identical to those used in a previous study [39]. The identity of
the PCR products amplified by each primer combination
was confirmed by sequencing. Fold enrichment was determined by 2°CP input X-linked gene – CP ChIP X-linked
gene)/2°CP Gpdh – CP ChIP Gpdh).
Computational Identification and Analysis of LSP1
Proteins from Drosophila species
The Drosophila melanogaster LSP1α (GenBank accession
no. NP_511138), LSP1β (GenBank accession no.
NP_476624) and LSP1γ (GenBank accession no.
NP_523868) protein sequences were used to search the
nucleotide sequences available in "DroSpeGe: Drosophila
Species Genomes" [45] using tBlastn . The scaffolds on
which the LSP1 homologues were identified are described
in additional files 2 and 3. LSP1β and LSP1γ had independently been identified in D. buzzatii and D. pseudoobscura [44], as had LSP1γ from D. simulans (GenBank
accession no. AAB71667). An alignment of the dataset
was performed in ClustalX [56], ambiguous bases and
gaps were removed from the alignment using
PAUP*4.10b [57]. Using ProtTest [58], the optimal model
of sequence evolution was determined to be WaG [59]. A
maximum likelihood analysis was performed on the data
in Phyml using the WaG model with 100 bootstrap replicates [60]. The D. simulans LSP1α sequence is incomplete
due to a gap in the genomic sequence.
