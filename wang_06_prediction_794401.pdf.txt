Abstract

Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are endogenous RNA
molecules with sequence complementarity to other RNAs
(sense transcripts). Depending on their genomic origins, natural antisense transcripts can be classified into two groups,
cis-NATs and trans-NATs. Cis-NATs are transcripts derived

from the same genomic loci as their sense counterparts, but
from different chromosome strands, whereas trans-NATs
and their sense partners originate from distinct genomic
regions. Genes encoding cis-NATs resemble overlapping
open reading frames (ORFs) commonly seen in prokaryotes
and viruses, but such overlapping genes were thought to be

Background

interactions

Conclusion: The Arabidopsis transcriptome contains a fairly large number of trans-NATs, whose
possible functions include silencing of the corresponding sense transcripts or altering their splicing
patterns. The interlaced relationships observed in some cis- and trans-NAT pairs suggest that
antisense transcripts could be involved in complex regulatory networks in eukaryotes.

refereed research

Results: We have performed a genome-wide screen of trans-NATs in Arabidopsis thaliana and
identified 1,320 putative trans-NAT pairs. An RNA annealing program predicted that most transNATs could form extended double-stranded RNA duplexes with their sense partners. Among
trans-NATs with available expression data, more than 85% were found in the same tissue as their
sense partners; of these, 67% were found in the same cell as their sense partners at comparable
expression levels. For about 60% of Arabidopsis trans-NATs, orthologs of at least one transcript of
the pair also had trans-NAT partners in either Populus trichocarpa or Oryza sativa. The observation
that 430 transcripts had both putative cis- and trans-NATs implicates multiple regulations by
antisense transcripts. The potential roles of trans-NATs in inducing post-transcriptional gene
silencing and in regulating alternative splicing were also examined.

deposited research

Background: Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are coding or non-coding RNAs with
sequence complementarity to other transcripts (sense transcripts). These RNAs could potentially
regulate the expression of their sense partner(s) at either the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. Experimental and computational methods have demonstrated the widespread
occurrence of NATs in eukaryotes. However, most previous studies only focused on cis-NATs
with little attention being paid to NATs that originate in trans.

rare in eukaryotes [1]. Recent research advances in eukaryotic
natural antisense transcripts, however, have challenged this
view. Genome-wide computational and experimental studies
have shown that about 5% to 10% of gene transcripts in mammals and plants have cis-NATs, whilst information on transNATs is still not yet available [1-7].
Emerging lines of evidence have shown that NATs play
important roles in the regulation of many gene expression
related processes, such as transcriptional exclusion, RNA
interference, alternative splicing, DNA methylation, RNA
editing and X-chromosome inactivation [8-17]. Antisense
transcripts have been shown to regulate expression of the
mouse Msx1 gene, which encodes a homeobox transcription
factor controlling craniofacial development [18]. Malfunction
of antisense transcripts are known to cause some human diseases, such as cancer (reviewed in [19]). Widespread antisense regulations have also been detected in plants, with the
identification of 687 cis-NAT pairs in rice and more than
1,000 pairs in Arabidopsis [5-7]. Phylogenetic analysis has
revealed that the positions and overlapping patterns of genes
producing cis-NAT pairs tend to be more conserved during
evolution than unrelated genes in vertebrates, indicating the
functional importance of antisense regulation [20].
Most studies on antisense transcripts have so far focused only
on NATs of cis-origins because their relationships are easier
to identify. However, as a major member of the antisense
transcript family, trans-NATs also widely exist and seem to
have important functions. In an attempt to search for mammalian NATs using experimental approaches, Rosok and
Sioud [21] reported that about 50% of the cloned doublestranded RNAs in human normal mammary epithelial and
breast cancer cells are trans-NATs. A systematic screening of
NATs in several fungal genomes also uncovered many transNATs that could potentially participate in complex gene
expression networks [22]. It should be noted that trans-NATs
discussed here and in the remainder of this paper only refer
to long transcripts that can form partial or complete complementary double-stranded RNA duplexes with other transoriginated long RNA transcripts. Several classes of small noncoding RNAs that also function in trans, such as microRNAs,
small interfering (si)RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs, are not
within the scope of this work.
We have previously used computational methods to identify
cis-NATs in Arabidopsis thaliana [7]. To further understand
gene expression networks regulated by antisense transcripts,
we performed a genome-wide screen of trans-encoded NATs
in Arabidopsis and identified 1,320 trans-NAT pairs. By
inspecting the structure of putative RNA-RNA duplexes at the
minimum hybridization energy, we confirmed the predicted
antisense relationship of the majority of putative trans-NAT
pairs in silico. Among trans-NATs with available expression
data, more than 85% were found in the same tissue as their
sense partners. A systemic screen of in situ hybridization data

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R92

of Arabidopsis root cells showed that 67% of trans-NAT pairs
with available data for both transcripts could be detected in
the same root cells at comparable expression levels. The
orthologs of at least one transcript of about 60% of Arabidopsis trans-NAT pairs also had trans-encoded antisense partners in poplar or rice, sometimes in both species. The
potential gene expression regulatory networks formed by cisand trans-NATs were analyzed using transcripts of UDP-glucosyl transferase family members as examples. We also
explored the potential functions of trans-NATs in post-transcriptional gene silencing and in regulating alternative
splicing.

Results
Prediction of Arabidopsis trans-NAT pairs
To identify trans-NATs in Arabidopsis, we first collected
sequences of all Arabidopsis annotated genes and full-length
cDNA transcripts, and grouped them into clusters according
to their genomic locations. Here, a transcript cluster represented a group of all transcripts derived from the same gene
or genomic locus. A genome-wide trans-NAT screen was carried out by searching for transcript cluster pairs sharing
sequence complementarity with each other using the NCBI
BLAST program. Two transcripts were considered as a transNAT pair if: they have partial or perfect sequence complementary regions that could form RNA-RNA duplexes; the
total length of all putative duplex regions of the two transcripts is longer than 50% of the length of the shorter transcript of the pair (high-coverage category); or the length of
the longest putative duplex region of the two transcripts is
greater than 100 nucleotides (nt; 100 nt category). After
removing previously reported cis-NATs and pairs formed by
transcripts derived from annotated transposons and pseudogenes, a total of 1,320 trans-NAT pairs were identified within
the Arabidopsis genome (Additional data file 1). Among
them, 368 trans-NAT pairs belonged to the 'high-coverage'
category, whilst the remaining 952 pairs were from the '100
nt' class (Table 1). The average length of the double-stranded
pairing region of the 'high-coverage' class trans-NAT pairs is
571 nt, with a range between 75 and 2,628 nt. For the '100-nt'
class trans-NAT pairs, the average pairing length is 258 nt,
with a range between 100 and 1,621 nt.
RNA molecules are known to assume various three-dimensional structures to execute their biological functions or to
interact with other molecules. To investigate whether two
transcripts of a putative trans-NAT pair could indeed form a
double-stranded RNA duplex, we used a hybrid program
[23,24] to inspect the melting structure of each trans-NAT
pair in silico. The results show that the two transcripts of all
predicted trans-NAT pairs in the high-coverage category and
about 90% of the pairs in the 100 nt category could hybridize
to each other and have extended duplex regions in their lowest energy melting forms, at least based on the in silico RNA
hybridization model (see Materials and methods). Some

Expression analysis of trans-NATs

refereed research

For an RNA molecule to function as trans-NAT, it has to coexist with its sense transcript in the same cell in order to form
double-stranded RNA duplex. To check the possibility of coexpression of the putative trans-NAT pairs, we used the Arabidopsis public MPSS database to examine the expression
profiles of transcripts in different tissues or under different
growth conditions. The Arabidopsis public MPSS database
contains 17 nt and 20 nt long expressed sequence tags of Ara-

deposited research

Among the 1,320 trans-NAT pairs, 658 pairs were formed by
two transcript clusters both of which had matching fulllength cDNAs, 444 pairs had full-length cDNA support for
one transcript, and the remaining 218 pairs were identified
solely by comparing annotated gene sequences (Table 1).

bidopsis transcripts from 17 different tissues or plants grown
under different conditions. In this study, we first mapped all
17 nt and 20 nt MPSS tags to the Arabidopsis genome, and
selected for further analysis only those tags that could be
uniquely mapped to transcripts forming trans-NAT pairs.
About 16% of trans-NAT pairs in the 'high-coverage' category
and 28% of trans-NAT pairs in the '100 nt' category had corresponding MPSS tags for both transcripts, and another 32%
and 45% trans-NAT pairs in the 'high-coverage' and the '100
nt' categories, respectively, had MPSS tags for one transcript
(Table 2). For those trans-NAT pairs in which both transcripts had matching MPSS data, more than 85% were coexpressed in at least one tissue (Table 2), suggesting that the
two transcripts of these trans-NAT pairs had the opportunity
to form double-stranded RNA duplexes in vivo. The expression patterns of two trans-NAT pairs derived from the MPSS
data are shown in Table 3 as examples. We note that, in most
cases, the sense and antisense transcripts of a trans-NAT pair
had comparable expression levels when expressed in the

specific gene family was found among transcripts of cis-NAT
pairs (data not shown).

Evolutionary conservation of trans-NAT pairs
To further investigate the potential of putative trans-NAT
pairs to form double-stranded RNA duplexes at the single cell
level, we inspected the expression pattern of each trans-NAT
pair in Arabidopsis root cells using publicly available in situ
hybridization data (AREX database) [25]. Since the AREX
database contains information only for annotated Arabidopsis genes, only 658 putative trans-NAT pairs for which both
transcripts derived from annotated genes could be compared
by this analysis. Among the 355 trans-NAT pairs with in situ
hybridization data for both transcripts, mRNAs of both transcripts of 237 pairs (67%) were found in the same cell with
comparable expression levels (Table 4), suggesting that the
sense and antisense transcripts of these pairs have the opportunity to interact with each other in Arabidopsis root cells.
Whether sense and antisense transcripts in the same cell
might be present in different cellular compartments awaits
future experimental investigations. A complete list of the 355
trans-NAT pairs with available in situ hybridization data is
provided in Additional data file 2.

Functions of trans-NAT pairs
We used the Arabidopsis function assignment from the Gene
Ontology (GO) consortium to analyze the biological functions
of trans-NATs and observed a modest functional category
bias. Transcripts from function classes with catalytic activity,
signal transducer activity and transporter activity were
slightly over-represented (Figure 2). Chi-square test results
showed that the difference between transcripts of trans-NAT
pairs verses those from the whole genome had a p value <
0.01 in all the above categories, indicating that the difference
was statistically significant. A detailed gene function analysis
using FuncAssociate [26] revealed that transcripts from
several gene families or functional groups were over-represented in trans-NAT pairs, including transcripts of UDP-glycosyltransferase genes, and gene transcripts involved in cell
wall biosynthesis, protein ubiquitination and responses to
auxin stimulus (Table 5). By contrast, no enrichment in any

To study the possible phylogenetic conservation of transNATs in higher plants, we performed an in silico search for
trans-NAT pairs in poplar and rice and compared them with
those from Arabidopsis. For about 60% of Arabidopsis transNAT pairs, homologs of at least one transcript involved in the
pair also have trans-NAT partners in either poplar or rice
(Table 6). For the majority of these Arabidopsis trans-NAT
pairs, only one transcript retained a trans-NAT relationship
in poplar or rice, but with new partners. Even for the small
proportion of Arabidopsis trans-NAT pairs in which both
transcripts retained trans-NAT relationships in poplar or
rice, the sense and antisense transcripts of the same transNAT pair tended to have new pairing partners; only one
trans-NAT pair remained the same in poplar and rice as in
Arabidopsis.

Networks formed by cis- and trans-NAT pairs
Unlike cis-NAT pairs, of which one sense transcript usually
has only one antisense partner, one-to-many relationships
are commonly seen in trans-NATs. There were also cases in
which one transcript formed different double-stranded RNA
duplexes with different transcripts derived from the same
gene as a result of alternative splicing. Among all transcript
clusters involved in trans-NAT pairs, 425 from both the highcoverage category and the 100 nt category can form multiple
trans-NAT pairs with other transcripts (Figure 3).
Comparison with previously reported Arabidopsis cis-NAT
data revealed that 430 transcripts on the trans-NAT list also
had cis-NATs [7], indicating that antisense transcripts might
form complex regulatory networks in Arabidopsis. UDP-glucosyl transferase family proteins are important enzymes catalyzing the transportation of sugars [27]. The Arabidopsis
genome contains about 115 genes encoding UDP-glucosyl
transferase family proteins. Transcripts of 44 UDP-glucosyl
transferase genes have one or more pairing trans-NATs,
among which 5 also have putative cis-NATs. Another 13 UDP

of UDP-glucosyl transferase gene family members in detail
using the yEd software [28] to uncover possible regulatory
networks formed by antisense transcripts (Figure 4). Our
results showed that antisense transcripts could potentially
regulate the UDP-glucosyl transferase family transcripts in
various ways. Some transcripts could form antisense pairs
with transcripts of UDP-glucosyl transferase family members
in both a cis- and trans-manner. Phylogenetic analysis of
UDP-glucosyl transferase gene member transcripts indicated
that closely related transcripts (from the same clade of the
phylogenetic tree) tended to be regulated by the same transantisense transcript (Figure 4, Additional data file 3). Such a
complex pairing network was also observed amongst transcripts of several other gene families (data not shown).

not all, of them could regulate each other's expression via the
RNA interference pathway. To test this hypothesis, we first
mapped all available Arabidopsis small RNAs from the public
Arabidopsis MPSS database to the Arabidopsis genome [30],
and searched for those siRNAs that could presumably be generated by trans-NAT pairs. We were able to identify a total of
148 siRNAs that were putatively derived from the RNA-RNA
duplex region of 171 trans-NAT pairs (Table 7). Among them,
110 siRNAs could be generated by more than one trans-NAT
pair. Comparison of siRNA density (matched siRNA number
versus sequence length) between the pairing and non-pairing
regions of the 171 trans-NAT pairs revealed that the siRNA
density in duplex regions is 1.75 times higher than that in single-strand regions (14 siRNA per 1,000 nt versus 8 siRNA per
1,000 nt). SiRNAs generated from the duplex region of a
trans-NAT pair could anneal to the antisense transcript and
prime the synthesis of double-strand RNAs through RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), thereby generating
more siRNAs from sequences 5' to the original duplex region.
For this reason, only sequences from the 3' end of the duplex
region to the 3' end of the transcript that could not produce
RDRP-generated siRNAs were considered in the siRNA density analysis.

RNA polymerase 2 (rdr2) loss-of-function mutant [31]
showed that, out of the 148 siRNAs, only 1 was found in the
rdr2 mutant. This result suggests that at least some siRNAs
generated by trans-NATs are RDR2-dependent.
Because a large proportion of the 171 siRNA-related transNAT pairs were formed by putative transcripts from genes
annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins, we asked
whether some of these genes are uncharacterized transposable elements. To address this question, we extracted the corresponding genomic regions of genes involved in the 171
trans-NAT pairs, and used RepeatMasker to examine the
homology of these sequences with known transposable elements. The results showed that 101 trans-NAT pairs had at
least one transcript whose corresponding genomic region displayed high homology to transposable elements listed in the
Repbase, indicating that these genes might be derived from
transposons.

Trans-NATs and alternative splicing
Another reported function of trans-NATs is to alter the splicing pattern of their corresponding sense transcripts by base
pairing, thereby masking certain splicing sites [10,11]. To
explore the potential roles of Arabidopsis trans-NATs in regulating alternative splicing, we compared the proportion of
genes with alternative splicing in our predicted trans-NAT
pairs with that of all genes in the Arabidopsis genome. A previous study using full-length cDNAs showed that about
11.59% of Arabidopsis transcription units had alternative
splicing events [32]. For the 658 predicted trans-NAT pairs
that had corresponding annotated genes for both transcripts,
127 pairs had one transcript with known alternatively spliced
gene products, and another 3 pairs had alternatively spliced
forms for both transcripts (Table 8). These data show that
Arabidopsis trans-NAT pairs have a much higher proportion
of alternative splicing events (19.76%) compared to all transcription units in the genome (11.59%), suggesting that some
trans-NATs might function in regulating alternative splicing
in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, among these 130 trans-NAT
pairs, about 60% had antisense pairing regions overlapped
with alternatively spliced exons, suggesting that the binding
of antisense transcripts to the pre-mRNA of their sense partners could cause the exclusion of the pairing region from the
resulting mature sense mRNAs.

Discussion

As a newly identified regulatory mechanism of gene expression in eukaryotes, antisense regulation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Here we provide the first
genome-wide trans-NAT prediction results in plants with the
identification of 1,320 putative trans-NAT pairs in A. thaliana. The potential roles of trans-NATs in regulating alternative splicing and gene silencing were also explored.
Although a large amount of cis-NATs has been identified in
most model organisms experimentally or computationally
during the past few years [1-7], little attention has been paid
to trans-NATs. The widespread existence of trans-NATs was
noted in a recent attempt to identify double-stranded RNA
molecules in human normal mammary epithelial and breast
cancer cell lines [21]. In that experiment, about 50% of the

information

The interlaced relationships between some cis- and transNAT pairs suggest that antisense transcripts could form complex regulatory networks in eukaryotes. As illustrated by the
case of transcripts of UDP-glucosyl transferase gene members, one antisense transcript could regulate many UDP-glucosyl transferase transcripts in either a cis- or trans-manner,
suggesting the existence of co-regulation of these UDP-glucosyl transferase transcripts by the same signaling pathway.

interactions

The RNA hybridization program showed that, for most transNAT pairs, their in silico lowest energy annealing forms contain long double-stranded RNA regions, as we predicted.
However, unlike cis-NATs, which may function at the transcription level, two transcripts of a trans-NAT pair must
interact physically to regulate each other. Using tissue specific gene expression data from the public MPSS database and
the in situ hybridization data of Arabidopsis root cells, we
were able to demonstrate that the two transcripts of most

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the orthologs in poplar or
rice of one transcript of about 50% of Arabidopsis trans-NAT
pairs also had trans-NAT partners. However, we found only
one Arabidopsis trans-NAT pair with both transcripts and
pairing relationship conserved in poplar and rice. For other
Arabidopsis trans-NAT pairs in which both transcripts
retained the trans-NAT relationship in poplar or rice,
homologs of both the sense and antisense transcripts of Arabidopsis had recruited their own trans-NAT partners. This
result suggests that antisense regulation may be important
for only one transcript of a trans-NAT pair. The lack of phylogenetic conservation of some trans-NAT pairs also indicates
that antisense regulation might have some species-specific
functions.

refereed research

NAT pairs are transcripts with sequence complementarity to
each other; however, there is no clear-cut criterion to define
what the degree of complementarity should be for the two
transcripts to form trans-NATs. Unlike cis-NATs, which can
be easily identified by comparing the genomic loci of two
transcripts, trans-NATs are more difficult to identify and,
therefore, provide a greater computational challenge. Here,
we chose a relatively strict criterion to define trans-NATs.
Only transcript pairs with a sequence complementary region
longer than 100 nt or that covers more than 50% of the length
of the shorter transcript were considered as trans-NAT pairs.
It is possible that there could be other transcript pairs with
shorter sequence complementary regions that did not fit into
our criterion but could also function as trans-NATs.

trans-NAT pairs with available data are expressed in the
same tissue under certain conditions and in the same root
cells, suggesting they have the potential to interact in vivo.

The study of the relationship of trans-NATs and alternative
splicing revealed that alternative splicing events occurred
about two times more frequently in trans-NAT pairs
compared to all transcripts in the genome (Table 8), suggesting that some trans-NATs might function by regulating the
splicing pattern of their sense partners. The overlapping of
pairing regions of some trans-NAT pairs with alternatively
spliced exons further supports the above hypothesis. Since
alternative splicing has not been investigated in transcripts of
full-length cDNAs without an annotated gene match, to
ensure a fair comparison, only trans-NAT pairs in which both
transcripts have corresponding annotated genes were
included in our analysis.

interactions

Trans-NATs may also function by repressing translation to
reduce the amount of proteins produced by the sense transcript, inducing RNA editing, thereby changing the primary
amino acid sequence of a protein, masking certain regions of
the sense transcript to block the access of regulatory RNA
binding proteins, or causing structural changes of the sense
transcript to alter its biological functions. All these possibilities need to be tested experimentally in the future.

Conclusion

Together with previous reports on cis-NATs [7], we have now
completed antisense prediction work in Arabidopsis by identifying 1,320 trans-NAT pairs. Our results show that antisense transcripts are more widespread in plants than hitherto
recognized. The putative trans-NAT pairs reported here will
serve as a data resource for biologists to investigate the func-

information

The siRNAs identified from the double-strand region of some
trans-NAT pairs suggested a potential role of trans-NATs in
inducing RNA silencing. However, this hypothesis should be
questioned by the fact that the number of trans-NAT associated siRNAs does not differ significantly from those of other
transcripts. One possible explanation for this discrepancy
could be that, like most other gene regulatory mechanisms,
antisense regulation also has tissue or temporal specificity, or
could only be induced under specific conditions, such as abiotic or biotic stresses. Thus, it would be difficult to identify
trans-NAT derived siRNAs by a general small RNA cloning
method. The observation that, in Arabidopsis, some cis-NAT
generated siRNAs can only be detected under high salt conditions [34] provides some support for this hypothesis. Another
reason could be that inducing RNA silencing is the function of
only a small proportion of trans-NAT pairs, whilst many
trans-NAT pairs may function in other regulatory pathways
as discussed below. The third possibility is that, notwithstanding the sequence complementarity, the two transcripts
of a trans-NAT pair are not related and rarely form RNA-RNA

duplexes within the cell. However, given the large amount of
trans-NAT-related double-stranded RNA duplexes cloned
from human, this possibility seems to be remote [21].

different antisense transcript. Complex regulation amongst
UDP-glucosyl transferase transcripts may also occur as some
transcripts could form both cis- and trans-NAT pairs. We
noted that some microRNA targets were also included in
either the cis- or trans-NAT list, or both. For example, transcripts of the NAC1 gene (At1g56010), which is a target of
microRNA ath-Mir164 [33], have both cis- and trans-NATs.
This finding suggests that gene expression regulation at the
RNA level could form complex networks in eukaryotes. One
gene or its product might be regulated by one mechanism
under one condition, whilst other mechanisms may operate
under other conditions. The recently identified siRNAs from
one Arabidopsis cis-NAT pair under high salt conditions has
also raised such possibility [34].

tion of trans-NATs. The complex networks formed by antisense transcripts are important for deciphering gene
expression regulatory networks of plants at the RNA level.

Materials and methods
Sequence resources and transcript clusters
The sequences and genomic coordinates of 28,952 annotated
A. thaliana genes was obtained from TIGR (release version 5)
[35]. The Arabidopsis full-length cDNA sequences used in
this study were collected from UniGene and RIKEN datasets.
The Arabidopsis UniGene dataset (Build#48) was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) UniGene Resources [36]. A total of 20,687 fulllength cDNA sequences were extracted from the Arabidopsis
UniGene dataset by selecting sequences marked as 'Fulllength cDNA'. The RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length cDNA
dataset, which contains 13,181 sequences, was downloaded
from the RIKEN Arabidopsis Genome Encyclopedia [37].
Full-length cDNA sequences were aligned to the Arabidopsis
genome by the BLAT program [38]. Sequences with unique
genomic location and at least 95% identity to the genome
were used in this analysis. Full-length cDNAs and annotated
genes derived from the same genomic locus (≥ 90% sequence
coverage) were grouped into one transcript cluster.
Annotated gene sequences and full-length cDNAs of Oryza
sativa were downloaded from TIGR [35] and NCBI UniGene
resources [36], respectively. Annotated gene sequences of
Populus trichocarpa were downloaded from DOE Joint
Genome Institute [39]. Both poplar and rice sequences were
clustered in the same way as described for Arabidopsis.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R92

Wecompared the total pairing regions from the results
provided by the hybrid software with those from the BLAST
software of each trans-NAT pair. If at least 80% of the BLAST
results-based pairing regions of one transcript in a transNAT pair were also predicted as pairing regions by the hybrid
software, we considered our prediction to be consistent with
the results from the hybrid software.

Expression evidence for trans-NAT pairs
The Arabidopsis MPSS expression data were downloaded
from the public Arabidopsis MPSS database at the University
of Delaware [40]. The MPSS data contained 297,313 17-nt
and 263,552 20-nt signature sequences of Arabidopsis transcripts from 17 tissues or plants under different treatments.
Only MPSS sequences with 'reliable' (present in more than
one sequencing run) and 'significant' (TPM ≥ 4) expression
patterns and that have unique genomic loci were used in this
study. Normalized abundance (TPM) refers to the transcript
abundance (Parts Per Million) obtained from the sequencing
procedure. There were 82,885 17-nt tags and 81,586 20-nt
tags that satisfied the above criteria.
In situ hybridization data of Arabidopsis root cells were
downloaded from AREX [25]. Two transcripts of a trans-NAT
pair were considered to be co-expressed if they were detected
in the same cell.

Phylogenetic conservation of trans-NAT pairs
Protein sequences derived from transcripts involved in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar trans-NAT pairs were compared
using the BLASTP program. High similarity pairs with an Evalue less than 10-30 and alignment coverage greater than
50% of query sequence were considered as homologous
sequences.

Prediction of trans-NAT pairs
Trans-NAT pairs were identified by aligning transcript clusters to themselves to search for transcript pairs with high
sequence complementarity to each other. In this study, we
used the following criteria to define trans-NATs. For two
transcripts with different genomic origins, if all paired
regions between them cover more than half of the length of
either transcript, the two transcripts were considered as a
valid trans-NAT pair and referred to as a 'high-coverage'
trans-NAT pair. Otherwise, if two transcripts have a continuous paring region with a length longer than 100 nt, they are
classified as '100 nt' trans-NAT pairs. Cis-NAT pairs and
pairs including transponsons or pesudogenes were removed
from each category. Double-stranded RNA duplexes formed
by the same sense transcript with alternatively spliced antisense transcripts from the same gene were considered as separate pairs if the pairing patterns between the sense and
antisense transcripts were different.

Structural analysis of trans-NAT pairs

Small RNA matches of trans-NAT pairs
The small RNA data used in this analysis were obtained from
the Arabidopsis MPSS database [30,31,40] These small RNA
sequences were aligned to all transcript clusters forming
trans-NAT pairs to search for trans-NAT originated small
RNAs. Small RNAs that could be mapped to the pairing
region of trans-NAT pairs were considered as trans-NAT
induced siRNAs.

Transposable element prediction
Transcripts of trans-NAT pairs with siRNA matches were
first mapped to the Arabidopsis genome using the BLAT program [38]. The corresponding genomic regions were
extracted and screened by RepeatMasker [41] Genomic
sequences with high sequence homology to transposable elements collected in the Repbase (RepeatMasker score was
greater than 250 and homology region was longer than 40%
of the entire sequence length) were considered to be transposon-like sequences.

The melting profile of two RNA molecules of a trans-NAT
pair was predicted using the hybrid software [23,24].
