Abstract
Background: Male killing endosymbionts manipulate their arthropod host reproduction by only
allowing female embryos to develop into infected females and killing all male offspring. Because of
the reproductive manipulation, we expect them to have an effect on the evolution of host dispersal
rates. In addition, male killing endosymbionts are expected to approach fixation when fitness of
infected individuals is larger than that of uninfected ones and when transmission from mother to
offspring is nearly perfect. They then vanish as the host population crashes. High observed infection
rates and among-population variation in natural systems can consequently not be explained if
defense mechanisms are absent and when transmission efficiency is perfect.
Results: By simulating the host-endosymbiont dynamics in an individual-based metapopulation
model we show that male killing endosymbionts increase host dispersal rates. No fitness
compensations were built into the model for male killing endosymbionts, but they spread as a group
beneficial trait. Host and parasite populations face extinction under panmictic conditions, i.e.
conditions that favor the evolution of high dispersal in hosts. On the other hand, deterministic
'curing' (only parasite goes extinct) can occur under conditions of low dispersal, e.g. under low
environmental stochasticity and high dispersal mortality. However, high and stable infection rates
can be maintained in metapopulations over a considerable spectrum of conditions favoring
intermediate levels of dispersal in the host.
Conclusion: Male killing endosymbionts without explicit fitness compensation spread as a group
selected trait into a metapopulation. Emergent feedbacks through increased evolutionary stable
dispersal rates provide an alternative explanation for both, the high male-killing endosymbiont
infection rates and the high among-population variation in local infection rates reported for some
natural systems.

Background
Bacterial endosymbionts currently attain a lot of interest,
because of their widespread occurrence in arthropod hosts
in which they often manipulate reproduction [1,2]. They

are predominantly vertically transmitted from mother to
offspring, although the lack between phylogenies of host
and endosymbionts indicates that horizontal transfer
should be possible [1,2]. The genera Wolbachia [2,3] and

Rickettsia [4] belong to the best studied endosymbionts.
Reproductive manipulations by these endosymbionts
comprise parthenogenesis (i.e. infected virgin females
produce daughters), feminization (infected genetic males
reproduce as females), cytoplasmatic incompatibility (CI;
in its simplest form a cross between infected male and an
uninfected female results in the death of embryos), and
male killing (i.e. infected male embryos die and female
embryos develop into infected females). In arthropods,
they are considered as selfish elements that enhance their
own transmission to the disadvantage of the rest of the
genome [5-7] and strongly act as an evolutionary force on
their hosts [8-13].
When the transmission efficiency from mother to offspring is (nearly) perfect [10,14-17], male-killing bacteria
are expected to approach fixation when benefits for surviving daughters stem from the death of their male kin
[5,18]. They then vanish as the host population crashes
[5,17-20]. However, hosts do not reach extinction under
these conditions if there is strong selection to prevent
transmission of the parasite (e.g. through sexual selection
of non-infected mates [3]) or when the phenotype is suppressed by host genes [11,21,22]. Turelli & Hoffmann
[22] reported strong variation in transmission efficiency
for CI-inducing endosymbionts between laboratory cultures and natural populations. Such variation can also be
expected in male killing endosymbionts. Therefore, endosymbiont transmission rates may vary with temporal or
spatial changes in the environment [17] and male killer
prevalence will be reduced because some males always
survive. It remains, however, an open question why many
natural host populations that lack these defense mechanisms can persist in spite of high infection rates.
Male-killing bacteria are generally thought to attain low to
intermediate prevalence in transient natural populations
with only mild effects on host population sex ratio [20].
Strong heterogeneity in infection rates at intermediate
spatial scales has been reported [16,20,23-26]. Charlat
and colleagues [25] recently discovered that interactions
with CI-inducing endosymbionts may explain natural variation in male killer prevalence in the butterfly Hypolimnas
bolina. Similar natural variation in male-killing Wolbachiainfection was found in Drosophila [27]. Interestingly, the
latter found complete absence of infections in some populations despite the absence of resistance mechanisms.
How spatial structure affects the spread of male-killing
endosymbionts is poorly documented. In general, imperfect maternal inheritance and direct physiological costs to
infection are acknowledged to impede their spread within
local populations [3]. Groenenboom & Hogeweg [28]
showed that a perfectly transmitted male-killer may
invade in a single population with spatial structure (i.e.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/243

taking into account neighboring interactions between
individuals) without driving the population to extinction.
The emerging pattern formation by hosts is here responsible for its persistence under conditions of perfect transmission and fitness compensation. However, because (i)
individual interactions in spatially structured insect populations go beyond direct neighbors and (ii) high dispersal
rates between populations are necessary for metapopulation dynamics [29], it is doubtful that the local-scale
mechanisms presented by [28] can be acknowledged as
potential reasons for the presence of high male killer prevalence in natural insect populations.
Dispersal is an important trait within a metapopulation
context that is influenced by various selective pressures
[30,31]. These comprise avoidance of competition for
resources [32], minimizing kin competition [33-37],
inbreeding avoidance [38] or coping with temporal variability of resource availability [39-41]. In general, individuals should disperse as long as their (inclusive) fitness
expectations are higher outside their natal habitat [42,43].
Consequently, when dispersal costs are higher than
expected fitness (e.g., due to high dispersal mortality) dispersal is disfavored (e.g., [31,40]). Dispersal rates therefore increase with increasing environmental stochasticity
or external extinction probability and decrease when dispersal costs (dispersal mortality) increase (e.g. [37,43,
44]).
Male killing endosymbionts affect host reproduction by
relaxing offspring competition (both between kin
[5,18,45] but also between non-kin [46]), altering sex
ratio [10,45] and subsequent the within-population
genetic structure [13]. Because these manipulation are
expected to influence the evolution of host dispersal strategies under different conditions of environmental stochasticity and dispersal mortality, we questioned (i)
under which of these conditions male killing infections
affect the evolution of dispersal rates, (ii) whether and
under which environmental conditions male killing
endosymbionts get fixated (host extinction) or disappear
(curing) and (iii) under which of these condition high
among-patch variation in infection prevalence can be
retrieved. Our analyses are built on an individual-based
model simulating the evolution of dispersal strategies in
metapopulations under different levels of environmental
stochasticity and dispersal mortality.

Results
The evolving mean population dispersal probabilities
approached equilibrium after less than 2000 generations
in all simulation experiments. Similarly, sex ratio, the proportion of infected individuals, and the number of
infected populations stabilized after this number of simulation steps. The equilibrium fraction of occupied patches

was in all cases, excluding extinct metapopulations, larger
than 92% (lowest value 92.4% for μ = 0.3, σ = 4). In the
reference simulation (no endosymbiont invasion), all
patches were occupied under all conditions. The invasion
of male-killing endosymbionts led to increased dispersal
rates (Fig 1), especially under conditions of high μ and
low σ. The increase was pronounced for males (Fig
1Aversus Fig 1C) compared to females (Fig 1Bversus Fig
1D).
While extinction did not occur under reference simulations, the invasion of male-killing endosymbionts led to
frequent metapopulation extinction under conditions of
low μ and high σ (Fig. 2A). These are conditions that favor
high host emigration and thus create more or less a panmictic population structure. Under conditions of high dispersal, metapopulations also occasionally lose
endosymbiont infections stochastically and are therefore
rescued from eventual extinction. In the case of low dispersal rates, fast deterministic extinction of infected populations may result in the extinction ('curing') of the
endosymbiont (Fig. 2B).
With more moderate emigration probabilities evolving
(μ, σ both low, or intermediate μ and high σ), our simulations predict that endosymbionts reach infection rates
beyond 80% in non extinct host or endosymbiont metapopulations (Fig 3A). Similarly, sex-ratio's become highly
skewed towards females unde

gle-population dynamics [5,11]. However, the more
important results of our simulations is (i) that low dispersal rates may lead to a deterministic extinction (curing) of
the endosymbiont and that (ii) high infection rates may
not necessarily lead to the extinction of the entire host
(meta)population. As previously documented [31], emigration probability increases with decreasing costs of dispersal (μ) and increasing environmental variability (σ);
thus curing occurred in simulations with low σ and high
μ.
Under all conditions, infected populations need male
immigration from uninfected populations as male killing
rapidly leads to a pure-female population with elevated
dispersal rates. Consequently, the extinction probability
of infected patches increases with the fraction of infected
populations within the metapopulation because fewer
and fewer males are produced in the whole metapopulation. This leads to disproportionally increase of the absolute numbers of patches that become extinct over the
fraction of infected populations. In contrast, the recolonization of empty patches by infected females only linearly
increases with the fraction of infected populations. This
eventually leads to a stabilization of the fraction of
infected populations, and subsequently the overall infection rates.

Our simulations show that the invasion of male-killing
endosymbionts in a host metapopulation affects the evolution of host dispersal rates. The overall infection rates
will depend on the prevailing environmental stochasticity
and dispersal mortality. Under conditions supportive for
high dispersal in the host population, extinction of the
whole host metapopulation, and consequently the parasite population too, become highly probable. In contrast,
the probability of endosymbiont extinction increases
under conditions that disfavor high dispersal.

Stabilization occurs predominantly through the negative
feedback on patch extinction, by which the fraction of
extinct patches in the next time step t+1 decreases when
the fraction of extinct patches on a certain moment t is
larger than 0.04 (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, a similar feedback
also emerges for changes in infected (Fig 5B) and uninfected patches (Fig 5C). For uninfected patches and extinct
patches, the negative feedback is only prominent when
the number of uninfected or extinct populations is low.
This implies that when the fraction of uninfected or
extinct patches rises above this threshold (this occurs evidently in metapopulations that go extinct or get cured
from the infection), stochastic dynamics may induce the
curing or extinction of the metapopulation due to positive
feedback probabilities. Obviously, this stabilizing mechanism by dispersal is responsible for the smaller range of
local infection rates in metapopulations that persist under
high dispersal (see Fig 4B, C) compared to conditions
with low dispersal (fig 4A). More-over, the higher number
of uninfected surviving females (and males evidently)
induce a positive feedback on the founding of uninfected
populations which on their turn have overall low chances
to be colonized by infected females, eventually leading to
the curing of the entire metapopulation.

Extinction of the host metapopulation under high dispersal rates, which create a panmictic population structure, is
similar as for mathematical models that considered sin-

This finding confirms the prediction that frequencies of
selfish gene elements (a.o., meiotic drive elements, cytoplasmatic incompatibility, male killers, feminizers; [47])

r such conditions (Fig. 3B). Clearly, among population
variation in infection-rates (i.e. number of infected
females/total population size) within surviving metapopulations is highest under conditions of high μ and low σ
(with a considerable fraction of infection free populations; Fig. 4) and becomes more homogenous with generally high local infection rates in the surviving
metapopulations as emigration probabilities go up (low μ
and high σ).

are a dynamic consequence of local extinction-colonization events in spatially structured population [47]. The
only study [28] that explicitly addressed the persistence of
male killing endosymbionts and infection prevalence
within a spatial setting confirmed the importance of colonization-extinction dynamics, although at the local scale
(i.e. within in a population). The resulting pattern forma-

tion (i.e., wave patterns by which infections spread
quickly leave behind empty space that can only be filled
by uninfected individuals) explained male killer persistence, even when transmission efficiency was perfect. In
this spatial automata model [28], pattern formation was
significantly affected by fitness compensations for survival. In our individual based model, however, no explicit

0.4, σ = 0.5), usually show stable coexistence with, on average, high infection rates (B, μ = 0.3, σ = 2), and the risk of host/
endosymbiont metapopulation extinction is high (C, μ = 0.1, σ = 4).

fitness compensations were introduced. Instead, the
reduced competition in infected populations fully compensates the fact that infected females lose half of their
offspring. This compensation emerges by default and
depends on the within-population infection rate. Interestingly, infected females also relax competition between
non-kin offspring and consequently strongly influence
interdemic (group) selection [46,47].
The induced changes in resource and kin competition by
male killing endosymbionts are responsible for the disproportional increase in male emigration compared to
that of females. The evolutionary mechanism underlying
this sex-specific dispersal [48] is different from the evolution of sex-indifferent dispersal [42,43], but it is evident
that it is of particular relevance for the rescue of infected
population (Bonte et al., submitted for publication). Such
populations face the risk of a depletion of males and consequently local extinction in the absence of male immigration.
Our sensitivity analysis with respect to the carrying capacity revealed that the modeling results are robust for larger
K. Only when K is low, a significant change in extinction
and curing probabilities were detected. Evidently, this is
due to increased effects of stochasticity in smaller populations [49]. However, since our model reflects endosymbi-

ont invasions in arthropod populations, altered dynamics
at low K can be disregarded. Besides K, male limitation,
with subsequent Allee effects on mating, decrease host
metapopulation viability when the number of mating
events for each male is limited [50,51]. We did not model
this implicitly, but models run for monogamous paring
systems (compared to the polygynous system described
here) indeed confirmed overall low (mostly zero) survival
probabilities for invaded host metapopulations (Bonte et
al., unpub. results).
Evidently, the probability of endosymbionts extinction
(the 'curing') is expected to depend on the initial infection
rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that high initial infection
rates (I = 0.5; I = 0.8) always led to metapopulation extinction under conditions favoring high dispersal in the host
(low μ and high σ). However, initially high infection rates
do not affect the phenomenon of metapopulation curing
(only endosymbionts go extinct). In contrast, when initial
infection rates were very low and non-evenly distributed
only slight increases of parasite extinction rates were
observed under conditions that disfavor high dispersal.
The fate of male-killer infections also strongly depends on
the local population size (K). When K was very low (K =
10), male killers always disappeared from the metapopulations. Entire metapopulations got extinct under environmental conditions that disfavored dispersal (μ > 3, σ <

2). Under conditions of low μ and high σ, metapopulation extinction rates always exceeded 0.56, because the
remaining fraction got entirely cured by stochastic processes. In the latter, dispersal rates increased up to 15–25%
due to the increasing importance of kin competition [37].
At the other extreme, when K was increased (K = 250,
500), only a slight decrease in overall extinction (respectively 0.07 (K = 250), 0.06 (K = 500), compared to 0.09
for K = 100) and curing rates were observed (respectively
0.16 (K = 250), 0.14 (K = 500), compared to 0.18 for K =
100), obviously due to an increase in population size.
Because insect populations are expected to occur at high
local population densities, we assume our modeling
results therefore to be reliable with respect to the envisioned biological system.
As demonstrated by our simulations, endosymbionts are
only able to persist under intermediate levels of host dispersal. Even exceptional infection rates of up to 90% and
associated skewed sex ratio's, may be stable under conditions that are characterized by low environmental stochasticity and low dispersal costs. Such stability does not
require behavioral changes in mating system or fitness

costs for infected individuals. For example, low environmental variation and low dispersal costs for butterflies in
tropical forests [20,52] could explain the high infection
rates reported for these species. Accordingly, agrobiont
species (experiencing high dispersal costs after reproduction in contemporary landscapes; e.g. [53]) show, on average, low to intermediate infection rates [20]. These
observations are thus in good agreement with our result
that the spatial dynamics in host metapopulations can be
important for the establishment of infection rates by
male-killing endosymbionts. Our simulations also
showed that strong among-population variation in infection rates may occur under ecological conditions that support the evolution of low to intermediate evolutionary
stable dispersal rates in hosts. Relating recently observed
among-population heterogeneity [24,26] in local infection rates to the spatial structure and environmental conditions of the entire metapopulation could consequently
provide a more quantitative validation of our hypothesis.
Our simulation experiments therefore add to recent theoretical work [28,50,51,54] that highlights the crucial
importance of spatial ecological dynamics for evolutionary host-parasite processes.

Conclusion
The invasion of male killer endosymbionts is responsible
for the evolution towards higher dispersal rates in their
host. The resulting sex-specific dispersal rates in host
metapopulations that are invaded by male-killing endosymbionts strongly determine the level of infection rates
and related host-endosymbiont population dynamics.
The influence of environmental conditions on host dispersal allows for the emergence of high but stable infection rates under a wide range of environmental
conditions, which favor the evolution of intermediate
host dispersal. In contrast, endosymbionts are predicted
to carry high extinction risks under either low or high host
dispersal activities. Under high dispersal, this is either due
to fixation of the infection (and extinction of the host
metapopulation) or due to accidental loss of the infection
from host metapopulations at the brink of global extinction, which may, however, recover after the infection is
lost. In contrast, low dispersal rates may lead to deterministic curing of the host population.

Methods
The model
The landscape
For our simulation experiments we used an extended version of an individual-based model of insect dispersal in
patchy landscapes of 100 habitat patches (n) with carrying
capacities K [15-17]. Patch capacity was set to K = 100
individuals.
The individual
Each individual is characterized by its sex, its affiliation
with a specific patch (i), by four alleles at two different
diploid loci that determine male (dm), respectively female
(df) dispersal propensity. The allele values were initially
randomly drawn from a uniform distribution [0–1]. Further, individuals are characterized by their infection status
(infected versus uninfected) which they solely inherit
from their mother. In our model, individuals simultaneously disperse before mating and production of offspring;
each individual has only one opportunity to disperse. Dispersing individuals die with a probability μ (dispersal
mortality), regardless of patch origin.
Population dynamics
Local population dynamics are governed by densitydependent reproduction of individuals. After mating with
a randomly drawn local male (thus allowing polygamy),
a female gives birth to Λ offspring, where Λ is a Poissondistributed number with a patch- and time-specific mean,
Λmean(t, patch). For each generation, the mean value of
Λmean(t, patch) is drawn from a lognormal distribution
with mean λ and a standard deviation σ. In our simulations, λ was set to 4, a value typical for arthropod demography. σ subsequently determines the degree of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/243

environmental fluctuations which are assumed to be
uncorrelated in space and time. Offspring are randomly
assigned to the male or female sex, but male offspring
from infected females die immediately after conception.
Remaining offspring develop into mature individuals
with a density-dependent survival probability s:

s=

1
(1+ aN i )

λ −1
with a =
K

(1)

Here Ni represents the expected population size in patch i.
K is the carrying capacity of patch i (identical for all
patches). This means that there is no fitness benefit for
infected females, but for groups with infected females,
population growth increases as female offspring are
released from competition with males.

Dispersal
After all individuals have reached maturity, they disperse
according to their genetically determined dispersal probability d (i.e., according to mean value of their sex-specific
dispersal allele, dm or df). The dispersal alleles were freely
recombined during reproduction. We assume global dispersal; that is, a successful disperser reaches any patch in
the landscape (except its home patch) with the same probability (1-μ)/(n-1). Dispersal probability was sex-specific
and unconditional, i.e. assuming dispersing arthropods
taking their decision without taking into account any
information from the patch. Dispersal alleles were
allowed to change by mutation, thus allowing for the evolution of sex-specific dispersal strategies. We implemented
sex-specific dispersal because we expect male-killing
endosymbionts to affect both local demography and sexratio, thereby potentially inducing different 'games' for
males and females.
Mutation rate and stochasticity
To promote greater variability of genotypes in the first
generations and to reduce the influence of mutations on
the stability of the final result, we let mutation rates exponentially decrease from ~0.1 to < 0.001 over the course of
the simulation experiments (5000 generations; see e.g.
[16]). A mutation comprises a shift towards a new random value from the initial uniform [0–1] distribution. No
external catastrophes were simulated; instead we allowed
demographic stochasticity and environmentally caused
fluctuations (0 ≤ σ ≤ 5) in offspring number (Λ).
Simulation experiment
We ran scenarios to test whether the presence of infections
in the metapopulation influenced the dispersal rate of
hosts, the metapopulation extinction probability and the

Simulations for both scenarios were replicated (n = 100)

for high rates of respectively curing or metapopulation
extinction just by demographic fluctuations, we ran sensitivity analyses for relevant ranges of I and K (Table 1).

Host infection rates were calculated as the number of
infected females/total population size, sex-ratio as the
number of females/total population size. Metapopulation
extinction probability was calculated as the number of
simulation runs with metapopulation extinctions divided
by the total number of replicates for the respective scenario. Other metapopulation parameters were only estimated for the surviving ones.
