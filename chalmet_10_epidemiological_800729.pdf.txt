Abstract
Background: The number of HIV-1 infected individuals in the Western world continues to rise. More in-depth
understanding of regional HIV-1 epidemics is necessary for the optimal design and adequate use of future
prevention strategies. The use of a combination of phylogenetic analysis of HIV sequences, with data on patients’
demographics, infection route, clinical information and laboratory results, will allow a better characterization of
individuals responsible for local transmission.
Methods: Baseline HIV-1 pol sequences, obtained through routine drug-resistance testing, from 506 patients, newly
diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, were used to construct phylogenetic trees and identify transmission-clusters.
Patients’ demographics, laboratory and clinical data, were retrieved anonymously. Statistical analysis was performed
to identify subtype-specific and transmission-cluster-specific characteristics.
Results: Multivariate analysis showed significant differences between the 59.7% of individuals with subtype B
infection and the 40.3% non-B infected individuals, with regard to route of transmission, origin, infection with
Chlamydia (p = 0.01) and infection with Hepatitis C virus (p = 0.017). More and larger transmission-clusters were
identified among the subtype B infections (p < 0.001). Overall, in multivariate analysis, clustering was significantly
associated with Caucasian origin, infection through homosexual contact and younger age (all p < 0.001). Bivariate
analysis additionally showed a correlation between clustering and syphilis (p < 0.001), higher CD4 counts
(p = 0.002), Chlamydia infection (p = 0.013) and primary HIV (p = 0.017).
Conclusions: Combination of phylogenetics with demographic information, laboratory and clinical data, revealed
that HIV-1 subtype B infected Caucasian men-who-have-sex-with-men with high prevalence of sexually transmitted
diseases, account for the majority of local HIV-transmissions. This finding elucidates observed epidemiological
trends through molecular analysis, and justifies sustained focus in prevention on this high risk group.

Background
Despite prevention campaigns and easy access to highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the number of
new HIV diagnoses in Western Europe continues to
increase, with unprotected sex between men being
reported as the main mode of transmission [1-3]. The

design of prevention measures calls for a thorough
understanding of the HIV epidemiology. As such, reconstruction of transmission networks based on interview
data can provide valuable insights in the spread of the
virus [4-6]. For several years now, international guidelines recommend baseline testing for drug resistance in
all HIV-1 infected patients [7]. This has led to a substantial increase in the availability of viral sequence data
and has permitted a new approach to study the HIV
epidemiology [8]. More specifically, phylogenetic analysis

allows the identification of mutual characteristics of socalled clusters, i.e. specific groups of patients in which
multiple transmissions of HIV-1 have taken place. Studies using phylogenetics based on the pol gene of HIV
were performed throughout the world to map local HIV
epidemics in correlation with transmission pathway,
drug resistance, risk behaviour and cluster size. Some
focussed on the contribution of primary infection to
onward transmission [9], while others investigated the
transmission of drug resistant viruses [10-12] or concentrated on specific populations [13,14]. All these studies
focus on the predominant subtype or the most predominant route of transmission, with little information on
the other circulating subtypes or transmission routes.
Although the presence of other sexually transmitted
infections (STI) at the time of HIV infection has been
associated with an increased risk of HIV infection [15]
and a correlation between an increased incidence of
syphilis infection and HIV has been reported [16], studies that link the presence of sexually transmitted infections with HIV transmission and the incidence of
transmission clusters are rare.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether phylogenetic analysis of data gathered through routine resistance
testing
procedures
can
supplement
epidemiological data and allow a more detailed description of local HIV epidemics. The target population consists of HIV infected patients followed in a local AIDS
Referral Centre in Belgium over 9 years (between January 2001 and March 2009). The selected cohort of
patients is highly diverse with regard to ethnicity, transmission mode and HIV-subtype. By correlating the presence of transmission networks as established by the
genetic relationship of the viruses, with information on
demographics, transmission mode, CD4 counts, the presence of drug resistant virus and the presence of coinfections like hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV),
syphilis and Chlamydia we wanted to obtain a better
insight in the dynamics of the infection in this specific
geographical area.

Methods
Study subjects

Between January 2001 and March 2009, 699 new
patients were registered in the AIDS Reference Centre
(ARC) in Ghent, Belgium. From this group, patients
were retrospectively selected according to the following
criteria: the patient was newly registered in the centre
without documented previous follow-up elsewhere in
the country, a plasma sample or plasma-derived RNA
pol sequence was available within 1 year of initial presentation to the ARC, and the patient was treatmentnaïve at the time of sampling. Patients signed an
informed consent form for participation and the project

was approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution. Patient information was collected anonymously
from clinical files: HIV transmission route, gender, age,
origin as well as CD4+ T cell counts at time of diagnosis. Past or present HBV, HCV, Chlamydia and syphilis
infection was considered based on the finding of HBV
core antibodies (IgG + IgM), HCV RNA, a positive serology (IgG + IgM antibodies) and a positive TPPA test,
respectively. Patients were considered in primary HIV
infection phase (PHI) when a negative HIV screening
result was available within one year of the first positive
HIV test.
Of the patients with a subtype B infection, 94% are
Caucasians (89% of Belgian and 5% of non-Belgian origin). The remaining 6% are from various parts of the
world. Of the patients with a non-B infection, 59% is of
African origin, 28% is Belgian and 5% is of a non-Belgian Caucasian origin. The remaining 8% is from various
parts of the world.
Samples

EDTA blood samples were collected regularly. The
plasma fraction was stored at -80°C. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on plasma derived RNA sequences of
samples collected within one year of the initial presentation in the clinic.
RNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

Full length protease and partially reverse transcriptase
sequences were amplified and sequenced from viral
RNA extracted from plasma, as described previously
[17]. After purification, sequencing products were analysed on the ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyser (Applied
Biosystems Incorporated, Foster City, CA). Proofreading
was performed with the IDNS software package (Smartgene, Zug, Switzerland).
Phylogenetic analysis

Nucleotide sequences were assembled using the BioEdit
package [18]. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W
with manual correction [19]. Nucleotide gaps were
assigned after amino acid conversion to maintain translation integrity, and gapped positions were removed.
The data was split up in a subtype B and non-B group
for computational reasons. For every M-group subtype,
at least one reference sequence, retrieved from the Los
Alamos Database, was added. To root the trees, the Mgroup consensus sequence (Los Alamos), was used [20].
The best fitting nucleotide-substitution model was a
general time reversible model of nucleotide-substitution
with a proportion of invariant sites (ι) and gamma distribution of rates (Γ), selected according to the Aikaike
Information Criterium (AIC) using MrModeltest [21].
Maximum likelihood estimated distances according to

the chosen model were used to construct neighbor joining phylogenetic trees. Bootstrap analysis was performed
using the above mentioned conditions on 1000 replicates. All neighbor joining phylogenetic trees were
reconstructed in PAUP* v4.0b10 [22]. Bayesian phylogenetic trees were constructed using MrBayes [23,24],
under the same model conditions as described above
with a sample frequency of 1000. Due to the size of the
dataset and the limited computer capacity, analyses were
run until the average standard deviation of split frequencies decreased below 0.05. At termination of the Bayesian analysis, parameters and trees were summarized
with a burnin of 25%. The generation vs. log probability
plots were checked for adequate sampling and potential
scale reduction factors for convergence. Tree diagrams
were plotted with Dendroscope [25]. Bias introduced by
convergent evolution due to the presence of drug resistant mutations was avoided by repeating the analysis
after removal of codons associated with transmitted
drug resistance. The topology of the trees and identification of clustering remained unchanged (data not shown).
The standardized list of mutations for surveillance of
transmitted drug resistance (DRM) established by the
World Health organization was used to identify resistance mutations [26].
Identification of clusters

The initial identification of transmission clusters was
based on the NJ trees topology. All clusters of 3 or
more patients, with a bootstrap value higher than 90,
were selected. Transmission pairs were excluded since
they do not necessarily represent sources of continuous
onward transmission. Clusters whose average genetic
distance exceeded 0.015 were individually checked to
evaluate whether the higher divergence of the sequences
could be due to transmission events spanning several
years and to avoid the inclusion of clusters of rare nonB subtypes. Subsequently a more robust method, Bayesian inference, was used to verify the clusters. Only
clusters with a Bayesian posterior probability = 1 were
considered as transmission clusters and selected for
further analysis.
Statistical analyses

Groups were compared using the chi-squared test for
categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test for continuous variables. In order to select
the best significant predictive set of variables, a binary
logistic regression was performed using a stepwise
(enter method) procedure [27]. Hereby variables with a
moderate relationship (p ≤ 0.2) with the dependent variable were included in the model, whereas a threshold of
p > 0.05 was used for the stepwise elimination of potential risk factors. Goodness of fit of the final models was

assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. All data was analyzed
using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results
Subtype-specific characteristics

Of the 570 patients that met the inclusion criteria of the
study, protease and reverse transcriptase sequencing was
attempted on 519. Drop outs were due to lack of patient
information (n = 34) or a viral load that was too low for
sequencing (< 200 copies/ml) (n = 17). The whole protease gene (297 nucleotides) and 568 nucleotides of the
reverse transcriptase gene were successfully amplified
and sequenced for 506 (97.5%) of the remaining 519
individuals. The majority of the patients was infected
with a subtype B virus (59.7% vs. 40.3% non-B infections). Within the 17 identified different non-B subtypes,
CRF02_AG (10.9%), CRF01_AE (9.7%) and C (6.1%)
were the most predominant. Infections with the subtypes A1, F1, G, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1, D,
CRF12_BF, A2, F2, H, CRF03_AB, CRF09_cpx,
CRF05_DF and CRF18_cpx were detected in <5% of the
patients. For 2.8% of the patients, subtyping was inconclusive. A comparison of demographic and laboratory
and clinical data of patients infected with subtype B and
non-B strains is shown in table 1. Univariate analysis
revealed major differences with regard to route of transmission, gender distribution, origin and the presence of
syphilis and Chlamydia infection. Multivariate analysis
showed an independent association between subtype B
infection and homosexual transmission, Caucasian origin, Chlamydia and HCV infection.
Transmission clusters

Twenty six transmission clusters and 35 transmission
pairs were identified. For one small cluster, all 3 patients
that formed the cluster were registered in the clinic during the same year. Twelve clusters included individuals
who first consulted over a time span of 2 to 4 years, the
remaining thirteen were clusters including patients
whose first presentation covered 5 years or more. In the
non-B subtype infections, 7 clusters were identified. The
mean number of patients per cluster was 3.71 (range 3
to 6). Amongst the subtype B infections, 19 clusters
were detected, one large cluster (comprising 57 patients)
and 18 smaller clusters (mean number of patients: 4.78;
range 3 to 10). Overall, 143 (47.4%) of the 302 subtype
B infected patients belong to a transmission cluster versus 26 (12.7%) of the 204 non-B infected patients (p <
0.001). Phylogenetic trees based on the viral sequences
of the subtype B infected and the non-B infected
patients can be seen in figure 1. An overview of the
characteristics of clustered and non-clustered patients,
irrespective of the subtype, is given in table 2. Being

part of a transmission cluster was significantly associated with harboring a subtype B virus, infection
through homosexual contact, male gender, Caucasian
origin, and syphilis. No association was observed
between clustering and HBV or HCV infection and
between clustering and the presence of drug resistant
mutations (DRM). Multivariate analysis indicated homosexual transmission, Caucasian origin and lower age as
the most potent predictors for being part of a transmission cluster.

To avoid interpretation bias resulting from the inclusion of one large cluster of 57 males, all of Caucasian
origin and infected through homosexual contact with a
subtype B virus (further referred to as the MSM-cluster),
the statistical analyses were repeated after exclusion of
these 57 individuals. The significant associations of clustering with subtype B infection (p < 0.001), homosexual

p = 0.013 to p = 0.097), CD4 cell counts (from p =
0.002 to p = 0.022) and presentation during acute infection (from p = 0.017 to p = 0.120).
Characteristics of the MSM population

Information of the transmission route was available for
408 of the 506 patients. Of these, 242 (59.3%) reported
transmission through homosexual contact, 154 (37.7%)
through heterosexual contact and 7 (1.7%) through
intravenous drug use (IVD). Ten patients reported other
infection routes (bisexual contact, blood transfusion,
needle accident,...). IVD represents a marginal proportion of the transmissions in the total population.
Multivariate analysis assigned a significant predictive
value of homosexual transmission to infection with a
subtype B virus (p < 0.001), Caucasian origin (p =
0.002), past or present syphilis infection (p < 0.001),
being part of a transmission cluster (p = 0.004), past or
present HBV (p = 0.012), and, with borderline significance, infection with a drug resistant virus (p = 0.05)
(Table 3). Univariate analysis additionally showed strong
association with Chlamydia infection (p < 0.001), acute
stage of infection at initial presentation (p < 0.001) and
higher CD4+ T cell count (p = 0.001). The same associations were found after removal of the 57 patients of the
MSM-cluster.

combination of NRTI and NNRTI mutations in 2 and a
combination of NRTI and PI mutations in 2. A high
prevalence of revertant mutations at amino acid 215 of
reverse transcriptase (RT) was observed, with 18 of the
23 patients with NRTI mutations having either
the amino acid D, E, C or S at that position instead of
the wild type T or the drug resistant Y or F. A significantly higher frequency of DRM was observed in
patients infected through MSM (9.1% vs. 2.4%; p =
0.007). Also an association between DRM and infection
with subtype B virus was noticed but the support for
statistical significance was weak (8.3% in Subtype B vs.
3.9% in Non-B subtypes; p = 0.052; see table 1). No
association between the presence of DRM and presentation during primary infection was seen. Fifteen of the 33
patients with DRM were localized on separate branches
of the phylogenetic tree, 18 were part of transmission
pairs or transmission clusters. In one cluster, the 215 D
revertant was detected in all 5 patients. In another cluster of 4 patients, all were infected with a virus carrying
the 215E revertant. One patient of the latter cluster
additionally had a 41L. In 2 transmission pairs, both
individuals carried the same NNRTI mutation (190A
and 106A, respectively). In 5 patients, mixtures of wild
type and drug resistant virus were observed. All were
part of a transmission pair or a transmission cluster of
3-5 individuals but were the only members of the cluster with DRM.

Presence and transmission of primary drug resistance

Baseline drug resistance mutations (DRM) were detected
in 33 patients (6.5%). NRTI mutations only were found
in 19, NNRTI mutations in 6, PI mutations in 4, a

patient demographics, infection risk and laboratory and
clinical parameters, were supplemented with information
obtained from phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1
sequences. The results revealed an epidemic characterized by high heterogeneity in subtypes and high prevalence of non-B infections (40.3%). This heterogeneity
and high non-B prevalence has been a characteristic of
the HIV epidemic in Belgium since the beginning
[28,29]. From the results of our study it appears that in
our local cohort, even after years of co-existence of different subtypes, patients infected with subtype B viruses
and non-B viruses still represent highly distinct populations with regard to route of transmission (84.5% homosexual transmission for subtype B vs. 9.5% for non-B; p
< 0.001), origin (95.3% Caucasian origin for subtype B
infection vs. 33.7% for non-B; p < 0.001), gender (92.4%
males for subtype B infection vs. 46.1% in non-B subtypes) and detection of other STI infections (Syphilis
and/or Chlamydia infection 59.9% for Subtype B infection vs. 28.1% for non-B subtypes; p < 0.001).
In addition, more and larger transmission clusters
were defined in subtype B infected patients compared to
the non-B infections (19 clusters comprising 143 of the
302 patients infected with subtype B viruses and 7 clusters comprising 26 of the 204 patients with non-B infections; p < 0.001). These figures suggest that local
onward transmission of subtype B virus contributes to
an important extent to the epidemic. As 95.3% of the
subtype B infected individuals are Caucasian and most
are local citizens, the chance that the source patients or
sexual partners are followed in the same hospital is
higher than for the non-B infected patients of which

66% are foreigners and an important part is infected in
the country of origin. This might in part explain the
observations. Gifford et al. also showed that the majority
of non-B infections in the UK in 2007 reflects separate
introductions through travel and migration [30].
Importantly, this study shows the clear association
between phylogenetic clustering, homosexual HIV transmission and infection with other STI. A correlation
between being infected with closely related viruses, sexual risk and sexually transmitted infections has been
shown before [15] in a study that was performed on a
mainly Caucasian and almost exclusively MSM population (91% MSM). Our study included female and male
patients of several origins, infected with a variety of HIV
subtypes and through several transmission routes.
The observation of one very large transmission cluster
of 57 MSM, infected with genetically very similar viruses
(mean genetic distance: 0.0108), is striking and alarming.
The cluster contains patients diagnosed over the whole
9 year follow-up period, with 8 new inclusions in the
last year. Members of this cluster are significantly
younger than the rest of the population (0.022) and
have more Chlamydia (p = 0.013) and syphilis infections
(p < 0.001).
Even after exclusion of this one cluster the significant
association between clustering, MSM infection and
syphilis infection remains. Together, these observations
indicate that high-risk taking MSM constitute the most
important source of local onward HIV transmission in
our region. These findings corroborate the results of
national survey programs in Belgium, revealing a continuous increase in number of new infections that is

Chalmet et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/262

attributable to a large extent to increasing incidences in
the MSM population http://www.iph.fgov.be/.
Because of the retrospective nature of this study, only
the available information on STI screening results could
be used. Distinguishing between an infection from
before or after the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection is often
impossible. Prospective studies that check for ongoing
STI’s are necessary to further address the role of STI’s
in HIV-1 clustering.
Previous phylogenetic studies, that concentrated
mainly on subtype B infections (Brenner et al., 2007:
90% Subtype B) [9] or on patients from Caucasian origin
(Yerly et al., 2001: 94% Caucasians) [31] reported an
association between clustering and primary HIV infection. This association was confirmed by our data
although the statistical support was weak (p = 0.017). A
more significant association between clustering and
higher CD4 counts (p = 0.002) however, supports the
relation between clustering and earlier infection stage.
In contrast to the studies cited above, the stage of infection was unknown for most of the patients included in
our study. It is possible that our selection criterion for
PHI patients has created a bias toward the preferential
inclusion of patients who present for regular screening.
These individuals are most probably more aware of
their risk taking behavior and the association seen
between clustering and PHI might reflect an association
between clustering and high risk behavior.
One of the major difficulties when running phylogenetic analysis on HIV-1 sequences in an attempt to
identify clusters of onward transmission, is the lack of
well defined criteria for cluster identification. Selection
of clusters based on bootstrap values only, as done by
some [31,32], implies a risk for the erroneous inclusion
of subtype-specific clustering. On the other hand, bootstrap values can be misleadingly low in case of clusters
with very short branch-lengths due to high similarity of
the viruses [33]. Selection of clusters based on low
genetic distance, as done by others [8,9,11,12,15,34] will
restrict the inclusion to transmission events that
occurred within a short timeframe. Inclusion of reference sequences and the use of robust methods can help
identifying these problems. For our study, we opted for
very strict criteria, based on bootstrap values and Bayesian probability and with an individual check of all clusters with a mean genetic distance >0.015. A drawback is
that this might have caused an underestimation of the
number of transmission clusters but it prevents the
inclusion of clusters with a low chance of being attributable to local transmission events.
The presence of mutations possibly associated with a
reduced sensitivity for antiretroviral drugs was observed in
6.5% of the patients analyzed. This figure is somewhat
lower than the overall reported percentage for Belgium

Page 7 of 9

(9.5%) and the mean percentage for Western European
countries (9%) [35,36]. The observed higher prevalence of
DRM in subtype B than in non-B infections confirms the
results of others [37]. Although it was not one of the
major aims of this study to investigate the distribution of
drug resistant virus in our population, the available information provided some interesting insights in the transmission of these DRM strains, as it demonstrates the frequent
transmission of viruses containing 215 revertant mutants.
These mutations evolve from 215 resistant mutations after
primary infection with resistant strains and therefore are
supposed to indicate the latent presence of resistant variants. Highly sensitive sequencing techniques however
failed to identify these resistant variants in the majority of
patients in whom the revertant mutation was detected
[38]. These findings and our observations indicate that an
important number of 215 revertants are the result of
ongoing infection with revertant strains and that their presence will have no or only limited influence on the virologic response to antiretroviral medication.

Conclusions
This study proves that a complementation of information on patients’ demographics, transmission mode, viral
and clinical parameters, with results obtained through
phylogenetic analysis of sequences that are available
through routine drug resistance screening programs,
creates an added value to the understanding of local
HIV epidemics. This deeper comprehension can in turn
contribute to the design of well targeted prevention and
control programs. We were able to show that patients
infected with subtype B virus and patients infected with
non-B virus represent significantly different populations.
We clearly demonstrate that, despite the existence of
prevention programs, easy available testing facilities and
a supposedly broad public awareness of the infection
and its possible routes of transmission, MSM still
account for the majority of local onward HIV transmissions. Continuous efforts to sustain prevention programs
targeting MSM are definitely needed, and the opening of
a debate on the appropriateness of systematic treatment
of MSM meeting some of the characteristics associated
with a higher chance of being a transmitter, is indicated.
