Abstract
Background: Hantaviruses cause human disease in endemic regions around the world. Outbreaks of hantaviral
diseases have been associated with changes in rodent population density and adaptation to human settlements
leading to their proliferation in close proximity to human dwellings. In a parallel study initiated to determine the
prevalence of pathogens in Singapore’s wild rodent population, 1206 rodents were trapped and screened. The
findings established a hantavirus seroprevalence of 34%. This paper describes the molecular characterization of
hantaviruses from Rattus norvegicus and Rattus tanezumi, the predominant rodents caught in urban Singapore.
Methodology: Pan-hanta RT-PCR performed on samples of Rattus norvegicus and Rattus tanezumi indicated that 27
(2.24%) of the animals were positive. sequence analysis of the S and M segments established that two different
hantavirus strains circulate in the rodent population of Singapore. Notably, the hantavirus strains found in Rattus
norvegicus clusters with other Asian Seoul virus sequences, while the virus strains found in Rattus tanezumi had the
highest sequence similarity to the Serang virus from Rattus tanezumi in Indonesia, followed by Cambodian
hantavirus isolates and the Thailand virus isolated from Bandicota indica.
Conclusions: Sequence analysis of the S and M segments of hantavirus strains found in Rattus norvegicus (Seoul
virus strain Singapore) and Rattus tanezumi (Serang virus strain Jurong TJK/06) revealed that two genetically
different hantavirus strains were found in rodents of Singapore. Evidently, together with Serang, Cambodian and
Thailand virus the Jurong virus forms a distinct phylogroup. Interestingly, these highly similar virus strains have
been identified in different rodent hosts. Further studies are underway to analyze the public health significance of
finding hantavirus strains in Singapore rodents.

Background
The hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family contains several important human pathogens that are prevalent worldwide. This group of viruses includes the
etiological agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), largely seen in Europe and Asia, and
hantaviruses causing (cardio) pulmonary syndrome
(HCPS) in the Americas. The clinical severity of hantavirus infections ranges from asymptomatic infections to
fulminate hemorrhagic shock and death. Hantaan virus
(HTNV) and Dobrava viruses (DOBV) are causative
agents of severe forms of HFRS and mortality rates of
up to 15% have been reported. About 20 - 30% of
HTNV infected patients develop hemorrhages [1,2].

Hantaviruses are enveloped and contain genomes
composed of three negative-stranded RNA segments;
small (S), medium (M) and large (L) segment, named
according to the size of the individual RNAs [3]. The L
segment encodes the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), whereas M and S segments encode for
the two envelope proteins (Gn and Gc) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively.
Transmission of hantavirus to humans occur mainly
through inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta and
hantavirus infections are therefore limited to the geographic regions inhabited by the infected animal hosts.
Today, a wide array of hantaviruses has been detected in
numerous rodent or insectivore species [4-6].
Hantaviruses are endemic in many countries of the
world, and the trend in recent years indicates that the
natural foci have extended from rural to more urban
areas. The mainland China accounts for the majority of

all cases reported worldwide and HTNV and Seoul virus
(SEOV) are known to be the most prevalent causative
agents of HFRS in Asia [7-9]. Specimens collected from
22 laboratories in China confirmed SEOV in 7 of 22
HFRS patients [7]. Furthermore, when comparing the
nucleotide sequences of viruses from HFRS patients and
rats captured in Beijing area, a nucleotide sequence
identity of 96.3% to 99.7% was observed, indicating that
SEOV is an important and perhaps the most common
hantavirus in China [7]. Interestingly, additional rodent
hosts and new hantaviruses are frequently discovered in
Asia including Thailand virus, isolated from the great
bandicoot rat, Bandicota (B.) indica in 1994 [10-12],
and hantavirus genetic material extracted from Rattus
(R.) tanezumi and R. norvegicus in Indonesia [13-15].
Many Rattus species are difficult to distinguish morphologically and there are many changes over the years
in both genus and assignments [16]. Recently the barcoding technique has been proposed as a method for
the identification of species on the bases of evolutionary
divergence of a gene region such as mtDNA cytochrome
oxidase I [17] or the cytochrome b gene [18]. According
to Musser & Charlton 2005, seven groups of rodents are
recognized within the Rattus genus including the R. rattus group and the R. norvegicus [19], and the R. rattus
group comprises about 21 species including R. rattus
and R. tanezumi. The R. rattus species is further divided
into two subspecies based on the chromosome number
[20]: an Ocean/European variant which Musser &
Charlton named R. rattus and an Asian type that was
named R. tanezumi.
In the late 80’s in Singapore, Wong and co-workers
found evidence of hantavirus infections in both rodents
and humans and one hantavirus strain (R36) was isolated from R. norvegicus [21]. They also analyzed the
seroprevalence in patients and found that 8.3% of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) suspects were seropositive to hantaviruses. However, for the last 15 years, only
one case with classical manifestations of HFRS, confirmed by serology, have been reported in Singapore
[22]. In a parallel study initiated to determine the seroprevalence of rodent-borne pathogens in Singapore’s
wild rodent population, 1206 rodents were trapped and
screened (unpublished data). Findings in that study indicate that one-third of R. norvegicus and one-fifth of the
R. tanezumi rodents were seropositive towards the
SEOV nucleocapsid protein. Of the seropositive rodents,
5.5 and 26% were also tested positive by PCR,
respectively.
This paper describes the subsequent screening of the
animals using PCR, and the characterization of two
genetically different hantavirus strains denoted Seoul
virus strain Singapore and Serang virus strain Jurong
TJK/06 of samples from R. norvegicus and R. tanezumi,

respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, nucleotide and amino
acid sequence identity were also determined.

Materials and methods
Ethics Statement

All animals were handled in strict accordance with good
animal practice, as defined by The Animal Research
Ethics Committee of DSO National Laboratories, 20
Science Park Drive, Singapore 118230.
Rodent identification

The rodents were identified through PCR based amplification and sequencing of cytochrome b gene fragments
obtained by using the primers mcytb1 and mcytHb (Ken
Aplin, personal communication) before phylogeneticbased species identification was conducted. Obtained
rodent sequences are available from the authors or
accessible from GenBank (GQ274946 - GQ274949).
Serology

Indirect Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
was performed using a recombinant truncated nucleocapsid protein of the Seoul virus (M34881) and serum
samples of collected rodents. The analysis was done as
described earlier [23]. The calculated cut-off value
(0.135) was set as 3 times the value of sera derived from
negative lab. rats (R. norvegicus).
Design of primers for Pan-hantavirus RT-PCR

Primers with the potential to detect all known rodentborne hantaviruses were designed towards conserved
regions identified from multiple alignments of hantavirus L segment sequences by the BioEdit program
package [24]. Using the primer pair HantaL_2_fwd_3312-40 5’- TYTTTGARTTTGCHCAYCAYTCWGATGATGC and HantaL_2_rev_3481-53 5’ TCATGNARRTTRAACATRCTYTTCCACA for PCR,
tissue samples (lungs and kidneys) of all rodents were
analyzed, as described below. The PCR was done in Mg
++
free PCR buffer supplemented with 2 mM of MgCl2,
0.2 mM of dNTP, 1 μM of the primers and 1.25 U of
AmpliTaq® (Applied Biosystems Inc., USA), in a total
volume of 25 μl. After a preincubation for 5 min at 95°
C, 35 cycles at 53°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 45 sec and 45
sec at 95°C were done. After a final incubation for 10
min at 72°C the result was examined by agarose gel
electrophoresis. A resulting PCR product of 170 bp was
considered PCR positive.
Extraction of RNA, reverse transcription and sequencing

RNA was extracted from tissue samples of kidneys and/
or lungs of individual rodents using Qiagen RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Germany) or the TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen Inc., USA), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen Inc., USA) and
random hexamers. For direct sequencing of overlapping
amplimers, numerous PCR primers were constructed

Johansson et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:15
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/15

using the PriFi software [25]. Specific cDNA fragments
obtained by PCR were purified using QIAquick Gel
Extraction kit or QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Germany) before sequencing was conducted.
Thereafter, the sequences of the segments were confirmed using a new set of primers targeting the determined cDNA sequences. However, the 15-20
nucleotides at the 5’ and 3’ termini of the S and M segments were set by the primers used for PCR. Finally, the
resulting sequence data was assembled as chromatograms, using SeqMan (LaserGene Inc., USA) and edited
with the BioEdit software package [24]. With the exception of the conserved 3’ and 5’ pan-handle sequence the
S and M and partial L sequences of these hantavirus
strains of Singapore have been made available (Genbank
accession no’s: GQ274936 - GQ274945).
Phylogenetic analysis

The resulting sequences were aligned by ClustalW [26],
as implemented in the BioEdit software package before
bootstrapped maximum parsimony and trees were calculated using the SeqBoot, DNApars (setting: search for
best tree, more thorough search, use input order, multiple data sets 1000 and 10 jumbles) and Consence softwares. Branch lengths of the trees were calculated using
DNAml of the Phylip 3.67 software package as distributed by the author [27]. The tree was visualized by the
TreeView software [28]. The similarity plots were performed by Stuart Ray’s SimPlot 3.5.1 software using a
window of 200 bp and steps of 20 bp, GapStrip: on,
Kimura (2-parameter), T/t: 2.0 [29].

Results
Characterization of the rodent samples

The phylogeny-based analysis of the cytochrome b gene
identifies the rodent hosts of the Seoul virus strain Singapore (RN41 and 46) as R. norvegicus. Furthermore,
the rodent hosts carrying the virus strain Jurong TJK/06
(RT49 and 50), (in this paper denoted R. tanezumi)
clearly clusters with R. rattus diardi, R. tanezumi and R.
kandianus of the diardii clade of the R. rattus complex
(Additional file 1, Figure S1) as described by Robins et.
al [18].
Serological and RT-PCR screening of rodent samples

RT-PCR screening of kidney samples from rodents with
Pan-hantavirus primers for the L segment, together with
a succeeding PCR targeting the S segment revealed that
2.1% (21/996) of R. norvegicus and 4.5% (7/156) of R.
tanezumi were PCR positive for hantavirus RNA. An
observation was made when comparing the optical density OD values of the ELISA with the PCR results. It
was noticed that rodents with the highest OD values
were more likely to be PCR positive too. Among the
rodents with OD values more than 1.0, 70% (7/10) were
also found PCR positive (Fig 1). In contrast, none of the

17 R. tanezumi and only 2 of the 335 seropositive R.
norvegicus having OD values less than 1.0 were also
PCR positive. The exceptions included one rodent with
a slightly lower ELISA OD value (0.96) and one ELISA
negative but PCR positive R. norvegicus. It is likely that
the latter rodent was infected close to the time of
trapping.
Sequence analysis

For hantavirus sequence analysis, two PCR positive lung
samples of each of the two rodent species (R. norvegicus
and R. tanezumi) were selected: rodent # 41, 46 and 49,
50, respectively. When comparing the complete open
reading frames of the S segments from the two rodent
species of Singapore with other complete or partial hantavirus S segment sequences (Additional file 2, Table
S1), the hantavirus of the Singaporean R. tanezumi
(strain Jurong) showed the highest nucleotide sequence
identity (95.0%) to the Serang virus, obtained of R. tanezumi from Indonesia [13]. In addition, the Jurong
sequence also demonstrated a high nucleotide sequence
identity to partial sequences of the S segment of rodent
samples of Cambodia (85.8%) [11] and full length S
sequences of the Thailand virus (83.6%), isolated from
B. indica [30].
Sequence comparisons of M segments also revealed
the Serang virus as most similar (94.5%) to the Jurong
strain. However, M and L segment of the Cambodian
hantavirus strains are not available in public databases
and only 343 bp and 412 bp of the Serang virus are currently accessible for sequence comparisons. As shown in
Additional file 2, Table S1, analyses of nucleotide and
amino acid sequences of the S and M segments strongly
suggest that the Serang and Cambodian isolates,
together with the Thailand virus share the closest identity to the Jurong virus strains of Singapore. When comparing the L segment sequences of the Jurong strains
with the Serang virus, a nucleotide sequence identity of
91.2% was found, slightly lower than between the corresponding S or M segments. Though, the deduced amino
acid sequences of the S segment encoding N, the M segment encoding Gn and Gc and the L segments encoding
RdRp are nearly identical over the overlapping regions.
An analogous high nucleotide sequence identity was
also noticed when comparing hantavirus S segment
sequences of hantaviruses of R. norvegicus. The nucleotide sequence identity between hantavirus strains of
Seoul Singapore and Cambodian Seoul virus strains was
found to be between 97 and 99% and the highest identity was observed towards the Cambodian strain 41
(Camb 41) with 99.1% identity over the overlapping S
segment sequences.

Dobrava types of viruses demonstrated a significant
non-conserved region of approximately 300 nt near the
middle of the S segment [29]. However, such drop in
nucleotide sequence identity was not noticed towards
the Thailand virus sequences or against partial nucleotide sequences of the corresponding Cambodian strains
or towards the Indonesian Serang virus (Fig 2). Moreover, comparisons of the amino acid sequences revealed
a similar trend, although the decrease in similarity in
the non-conserved region was less prominent (data not
shown).
Due to the lack of available sequences in public databases, a comprehensive SimPlot comparison of the M
segment could only be performed towards the Thailand
virus along with a subset of less related hantaviruses. As
expected, the M segment of the Jurong strain was most
similar to the Thailand virus, especially when comparing
the amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein Gn. In
addition, two highly conserved regions consisting of
approximately 300 amino acids each were found near
the middle of the glycoproteins of the Jurong and Thailand viruses (data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of S segment sequences showed
that the Jurong virus strains and the Thailand virus

isolates cluster together (Fig 3). Other hantaviruses carried by rodents of the Cricetidae family, Arvicolinae,
Neotominae or Sigmodontinae subfamilies (e.g. Puumala
virus, Tula virus, Sin Nombre and Andes virus) or hantaviruses carried by family Muridae subfamily Murinae,
such as Seoul virus, Hantaan virus and Dobrava-Belgrad
virus are genetically more distant (Fig 3). When partial
sequences were included to the phylogenetic analysis, a
novel clade consisting of the Thailand, Jurong, Serang
and Cambodian hantaviruses was found. According to
the phylogenetic trees and distance matrix, these
sequences are clearly strains of the same hantavirus species. A common origin seems evident in such case.
As indicated by the phylogenetic trees for the viral S
and M segments (Fig 3 and 4, respectively) the Jurong
virus strains discovered in Singapore rats is genetically
similar and form a clade with the Serang virus of Indonesia, Cambodian strains (e.g. Camb174, Camb117,
Camb96) and hantavirus sequences of B. indica from
Thailand (Thailand virus). Interestingly, the four closely
related viruses; Jurong, Cambodia, Serang, and Thailand
are carried by two or more different rodent species.
Hantavirus strains of R. norvegicus, such as the Seoul
Singapore and corresponding Cambodian isolates (e.g.
Camb32, 41, 58 and 180) cluster closely together with

the Cambodian strain 41 (Camb 41) with 99.1% identity
for the overlapping S segment sequences.

Discussion
There are increasing numbers of studies from Asia
reporting prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent and
human populations, suggesting emerging hantaviral
infections in this part of the world [31]. Moreover, studies conducted, particularly in Southeast Asia, indicate
that hantavirus diversity is expanding [8]. Under these
circumstances, we initiated a series of studies that aimed
to provide a clearer perspective of the hantavirus situation in Singapore, as well as other rodent-borne pathogens (on going study).
Due to difficulties in the morphological identification
of rodent species, genetic barcoding may be used as an
additional help for rodent classification. By comparing
genes such as mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I or the cytochrome b gene, the rodent hosts of the Seoul virus Singapore strains and the viruses of the Jurong strain were

identified as rodents of the R. norvegicus and rodents of
the R. diardii clade, respectively. An interesting point to
note is that rats identified as R. tanezumi are found
within three different clades in the paper published by
Robins et al, 2007 [18]. The three clades are the monospecific tanezumi clade, the tiomanicus clade and the
diardii clade together with R. rattus diardi and R. kandianus, members of which came from Sri Lanka, Peninsular Malaysia, Java and northern Sulawesi (Additional
file 1, Figure S1). Evidently, R. rattus diardi, R. kandianus and R tanezumi sequences are so similar, when
found in the diardii clade, indicating that they are probably representatives of the same species.
In this study, we have identified and characterized two
hantaviruses from the lungs of R. tanezumi of the diardii
clade or R. rattus linage IV (Ken Aplin, personal communication) and R. norvegicus. The viral strains were
denoted Jurong TJK/06 (RT49 and 50) and Seoul Singapore (RN41 and 46), respectively. Nucleotide sequences
of the S and M segments as well as partial L cDNA
sequences confirmed that these two virus strains are
genetically distinct from each other. The nucleotide

sequence identity of the S and M segments between the
Jurong and Seoul Singapore strains was only 78% and
75%, whereas the amino acid sequence identity were
87% and 83%, respectively. These levels are much lower
than the officially accepted 93% amino acid identity
required for defining hantaviruses as same serotypes, or
7% divergence required for defining hantaviruses as different serotypes [3]. Nevertheless, factors such as the
specific rodent hosts, distinct genetic lineage and possible reproductive isolation evident from the coexistence
of these viruses within the same geographic regions
further support our view that these virus strains are distinct from each other.
Phylogenetic analysis of hantaviruses of the Asian
region revealed a close genetic relationship of the Jurong

virus with the Thailand hantavirus carried by B. indica
[30] and Cambodian hantavirus strains [11]. By analyzing recently submitted hantavirus sequences from Indonesia we noticed that the Serang virus, from the R.
tanezumi [13] showed the highest nucleotide sequence
identity with regard to the S (95%) and M (94.5%) segments of the Jurong virus sequence. Furthermore, the
corresponding amino acid sequence of the L segment
was found to be nearly identical over an overlapping
region of 137 amino acids (aa 973-1109), while the corresponding nucleotide sequence identity over the same
region was only 91.2%.
SimPlot analysis of S segment sequences from genetically and geographically different hantaviruses revealed a
highly variable region in the middle of the S segment. A

similar observation was made by Schmaljohn et al [3]
after comparing the amino acid residues 240-310 of the
nucleocapsid proteins of HTNV, SEOV and PUUV. In
contrast, this region is highly conserved between the
Jurong strains and the Thailand virus. Our analysis of
available partial sequences of the Cambodian and the
Serang virus S segments suggests that these hantaviruses
are also likely to share the same characteristics (Additional file 2, Table S1).
SimPlot analysis of open reading frames of M segments shows that the Gn protein is more variable than
the carboxy terminal protein (Gc). As for the S segment,

the Thailand virus shows a similar amino acid sequence
of the Gn and Gc proteins as the Jurong virus. Unfortunately, due to limited sequence information available,
with regards to the Cambodian and Serang hantavirus
strains, a proper comparison of the M segment
sequences could not be performed. However, after analyzing the phylogenetic relationships, it is evident that
the Serang, Cambodian, Thailand and the Jurong viruses
are genetically related and form a distinct phylogroup of
hantaviruses. As these genetically related viruses are harboured by different rodent species, this might suggest
the possibility of a host-switch event [13,30].

Even though the trapping sites were scattered over
most of the Singapore island, all PCR positive R. tanezumi were trapped at the same location, a shipyard in
the Jurong area. However, no such clustering of hantavirus PCR positive rats to specific locations was
observed among the 21 hantavirus RNA positive R. norvegicus carrying the Seoul Singapore virus.
In conclusion, by genetic identification of the different
rodent hosts, sequence analysis of the corresponding
hantaviruses nucleotide sequences in context with geographical distribution we are able to learn more of
ancestral viruses, virus evolution, host-switch events and
virus migration routes. Other interesting question,
which regards to the genetic diversity of hantaviruses in
Southeast Asia is the impact on human health. The
pathogenicity of hantaviruses of B. indica or R. tanezumi
is still unclear and further studies of epidemiological and
epizootiological studies are required. Work is underway
to evaluate the significance of our findings in public
health context by establishing the seroprevalence of
rodent borne diseases in Singapore human population.
Additional file 1: Figure S1 - Rodent identification. The rodents from
Singapore’s wild rodent population were identified through PCR based
amplification and sequencing of cytochrome b gene fragments, as
described in Materials and Methods. The obtained sequences (red text),
along with rodent sequences found in public databases were used for
phylogenetic-based species identification and a few clades of interest are
high-lighted. Rodents belonging to this study are indicated by arrows.
Obtained rodent sequences are available from the authors or accessible
from GenBank (GQ274946 - GQ274949).

Additional file 2: Table S1 - Sequence pair distances. S segment: (1)
Jurong TJK/06 (This study); (2) Serang virus (AM998808); (3) Camb117 and
Camb132 (AJ427511.1); (4) Thailand virus (Nakhon Ratchasima/Bi0017/
2004) (AM397664.1); (5) Seoul Singapore (This study); (6) Seoul SR11
(M34881.1); (7) Hantaan virus (AB027111.1); (8) DOBV, strain DobravaBelgrade (L41916.1). The nucleotide and the amino acid sequence
identity comparisons were made using the complete open reading
frames of the S-segment except for Cambodia (nt 329-961) or Serang
virus (nt 1-815). Comparisons between the partial sequences of Serang
virus and Cambodian sequences (2) and (3) were made using the 486 nt
overlapping coding region. M segment: (1) Jurong TJK/06 (This study); (2)
Serang virus (AM998807); (3) Thailand virus L08756); (4) Seoul Singapore
(This study); (5) Seoul virus (NC_005237.1; (6) Hantavirus Gou3
(AF145977); (7) Hantaan virus (NC_005219); (8) Dobrava-Belgrade virus
(L33685). The nucleotide and the amino acid sequence identity
comparisons were made using the complete open reading frames of the
M-segment except for the Serang virus when the nucleotides 1990-2332
were used.
