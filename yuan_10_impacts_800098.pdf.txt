Abstract
Background: Cultivation of medicinal plants is not only a means for meeting current and future demands for large
volume production of plant-based drug and herbal remedies, but also a means of relieving harvest pressure on
wild populations. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang-qin or Chinese skullcap) is a very important medicinal plant
in China. Over the past several decades, wild resource of this species has suffered rapid declines and large-scale
cultivation was initiated to meet the increasing demand for its root. However, the genetic impacts of recent
cultivation on S. baicalensis have never been evaluated. In this study, the genetic diversity and genetic structure of
28 wild and 22 cultivated populations were estimated using three polymorphic chloroplast fragments. The
objectives of this study are to provide baseline data for preserving genetic resource of S. baicalensis and to
evaluate the genetic impacts of recent cultivation on medicinal plants, which may be instructive to future
cultivation projects of traditional Chinese medicinal plants.
Results: Thirty-two haplotypes of S. baicalensis (HapA-Y and Hap1-7) were identified when three chloroplast
spacers were combined. These haplotypes constituted a shallow gene tree without obvious clusters for cultivated
populations, suggesting multiple origins of cultivated S. baicalensis. Cultivated populations (hT = 0.832) maintained
comparable genetic variation with wild populations (hT = 0.888), indicating a slight genetic bottleneck due to
multiple origins of cultivation. However, a substantial amount of rare alleles (10 out of 25 haplotypes within wild
populations) lost during the course of S. baicalensis cultivation. The genetic differentiation for cultivated group
(GST = 0.220) was significantly lower than that of wild group (GST = 0.701). Isolation by distance analysis showed
that the effect of geographical isolation on genetic structure was significant in wild populations (r = 0.4346,
P < 0.0010), but not in cultivated populations (r = 0.0599, P = 0.2710). These genetic distribution patterns suggest
that a transient cultivation history and the extensive seed change among different geographical areas during the
course of S. baicalensis cultivation.
Conclusions: Although cultivated S. baicalensis maintains comparable genetic diversity relative to wild populations,
recent cultivation has still imposed profound impacts on genetic diversity patterns of the cultivated S. baicalensis
populations, i.e., the loss of rare alleles and homogenization of cultivated populations. This study suggests that
conservation-by-cultivation is an effective means for protecting genetic resources of S. baicalensis, however, the
wild resources still need to be protected in situ and the evolutionary consequences of extensive seed exchange
mediated by human being should be monitored carefully.

Background
The World Health Organization has estimated that
more than 80% of the world’s population depends on
herbal medicine for primary healthcare needs [1]. Most
materials used in herbal medicine and vitamin supplements are taken from wild plants and the rapid growing
demands for medicinal plants, compounded by habitat
loss, is exerting pressure on many species. With the
increased realization that some wild species are being
over-exploited, a number of governments and agencies
are recommending that wild medicinal species should
be brought into cultivation systems [2]. Cultivation of
medicinal plants is not only a means for meeting current and future demands for large volume production of
plant-based drug and herbal remedies, but also a means
of relieving harvest pressure on wild populations [3,4].
In certain circumstances such as traditional agriculture,
cultivation can serve as an important reservoir of
genetic variability [5,6].
However, cultivation can also have impacts on conservation, which need to be better understood [4]. Medicinal plant production through cultivation, for example,
can reduce the incentives to conserve wild populations
[7]. More importantly, founder effects and artificial
selections for high yielding or pharmacologically standard individuals would probably result in a narrow
genetic range of material in cultivation, resembling the
genetic bottleneck during the domestication of cereal
species [8]. Furthermore, seed exchange between farmers is much easier due to the highly developed transportation and commercial markets of modern times [9], but
migration of seeds from their collection sites to other
environments within a species range for cultivation may
increase the risk of maladaptation [10,11]. Gene flow
from maladapted cultivated individuals into adjacent
native populations could also negatively affect adaptation to local environments [12].
Medicinal plants play inherent and prominent roles
in the general health service in China. Due to longterm exploitation of wild medicinal herbs, many
important Chinese traditional medicinal plants are
becoming rare and endangered [13]. In order to protect the medicinal plant resources and meet the
increasing demand for plant-based drug and herbal
remedies, the most popular medicinal plants have been
cultivated under the supervision of Chinese government or grown spontaneously by farmers [13]. Today,
the cultivation areas of medicinal plants reach 5 million mus (1 mu = 0.165 acre) [14]. The sharp increase
in medicinal plant cultivation may greatly mitigate the
pressure on the wild medicinal resources, but also
impose profound impacts on the genetic diversity patterns of these medicinal plants. However, studies about

Page 2 of 13

genetic impacts of cultivation are mostly concentrated
on economically valuable crops with long domestication history (see review in [8]), little is known regarding the genetic impacts of recent cultivation on
medicinal plants (but see [15-18]). This issue becomes
more important as wild gene pools of many medicinal
species have decreased rapidly or become extinct.
Domestic cultivation can not only meet the increasing
demands of human consumption [15], but also represent a conservation-through-use approach for protecting genetic resources of medicinal plants [16].
Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang-qin or Chinese
skullcap) is a perennial herb of the family Lamiaceae
with fleshy root, branched stems, papery leaves, purplered to blue flowers, and black-brown ovoid nutlets [19].
Root of this herb (Radix Scutellariae) is a very important Chinese Materia Medica that was first recorded in
Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing in ca. 100 BC [20] and officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [21]. As one
of the most important heat-clearing and dehumidifying
drugs in traditional Chinese medicine, Radix Scutellariae
has been widely used in the treatment of hepatitis, jaundice, tumor, leukemia, hyperlipaemia, arteriosclerosis,
diarrhea, and inflammatory diseases [22-24]. Huang-qin
is pollinated by bees and flies, and propagated by seeds
[25]. The wild populations of S. baicalensis is widely
distributed in Nei mongol, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning,
Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Shanxi,
Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces from Northeast to Northwest China and adjacent areas including Mongolia, Russia, Korea and Japan [19]. This species often appears in
grassland, sunny grassy slopes and shrubbery or forest
habitats (from 12 to 2000 m) with a cold-dry climate
[19]. Over the past several decades, the wild resource of
S. baicalensis has suffered rapid declines, and thus was
listed as a class III conserved medicinal plant in China
[26]. To meet the increasing demand for its root, largescale cultivation programs have been initiated in China
since 1958 [27]. Because S. baicalensis is a newly-cultivated species and there are still plenty of wild populations, this medicinal species may represent an ideal
model to evaluate the impacts of recent cultivation on
the genetic diversity pattern of medicinal plants. Three
polymorphic chloroplast fragments were chosen for
population genetic analyses in this study because chloroplast markers are more sensitive than nuclear markers
to demographic fluctuations such as cultivation bottlenecks resulting from smaller effective population sizes
(Ne) [28]. In addition, chloroplast markers are powerful
tools for tracing the maternal origins of cultivated
populations and seed exchange among populations,
which are of important relevance to genetic resource
conservation [6,29]. The objectives of this study were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/29

to: 1) quantify the amount of genetic variation in wild
and cultivated populations of S. baicalensis; 2) compare
the genetic structure in wild and cultivated populations
of S. baicalensis; 3) evaluate the impacts of recent cultivation on the genetic diversity pattern of S. baicalensis;
and 4) unravel the meaning of recent cultivation on
medicinal plant germplasm conservation.

A total of 602 and 451 individuals of S. baicalensis
representing 28 wild and 22 cultivated populations were
collected from Northeast to Northwest China, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 1). Seventeen to twenty-four individuals were sampled for each population. Twenty-two
Scutellaria rehderiana Diels individuals were sampled
from a wild population of Weiyuan county in Gansu
province (WYW) as an outgroup (Table 1, Fig. 1a).
Leaves for DNA extraction were dried with silica gel.
Voucher specimens were deposited in herbaria of Institute of Chinese Materia Medica (CMMI), China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. The precise
geographic location of each sampled population was
determined using a Garmin GPS unit (Table 1).

Dried leaves were milled by using RETSCH Mixer Mill
(MM301). Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol [30]. The universal primers described in Hamilton
[31] and Sang et al. [32] were used for screening polymorphic cpDNA fragments. After preliminary screening of eight chloroplast fragments, we chose atpB-rbcL,
trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH intergenic spacers for the full
survey because they contained the most polymorphic
sites. PCR amplification was performed in a TC-512
thermocycler (Techne, England) programmed for an
initial 240 s at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at
94°C, 30 s at 55°C (atpB-rbcL), 54°C (trnL-trnF) or
58°C (psbA-trnH), 90 s at 72°C, and a final 240 s at
72°C. Reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 μL
containing 2.0 mm/L MgCl 2 , 0.5 μm/L dNTP, 10 ×
buffer, 2.5 μm/L primer, 1 U Taq DNA and 20 ng
DNA template. Sequencing reactions were conducted
with the forward or reverse primers of the PCR using
the DYEnamic ET Terminator Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sequencing was performed on a HITACHI 3130
Genetic Analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo Japan) after the reaction product was purified through precipitation with 95% ethanol and 3 M
sodium acetate (pH 5.2).

Data analysis

Sequences were aligned using Clustal_X version 1.81
[33], and all indels were coded as substitutions following
Caicedo and Schaal [34]. All individuals were characterized for cpDNA haplotype. Sequence variation was
tested for deviations from neutrality by Tajima’s D statistic [35], and by Fu and Li’s D* and F* statistics [36]
using DNASP 4.00 [37]. A haplotype network depicting
the mutational relationships among distinct haplotypes
was drawn following the principle of parsimony by TCS
version 1.13 [38,39], positing S. rehderiana as outgroup.
The geographical distribution of haplotypes was plotted
on a map of China using Arcmap 8.3 (ESRI, Inc.). Significant difference of haplotype frequencies between
wild and cultivated populations was quantified using x2
test. Total diversity (hT), within-population diversity (hS)
and level of population differentiation (GST) were calculated using the program HAPLONST, treating wild and
cultivated populations as separate groups. The significance of the parameter comparisons (Number of haplotype; Total diversity, hT; Within-population diversity, hS;
Population differentiation, GST) between wild and cultivated groups were estimated by x2 test and Wilcoxon
two-group tests, being implemented in the statistical
package SPSS17.0 (SPSS Inc.).
Hierarchical structure of genetic variation in S. baicalensis was determined by an analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) with ARLEQUIN version 2.000,
partitioning genetic variance into three levels: among
groups (cultivated and wild groups), among-population
within groups, and within-population. Genetic differentiation between cultivated and wild groups was also
evaluated using DNASP 4.00 [37]. To examine the
effect of geographical distance on genetic structure,
correlations between pairwise genetic distances
(Kimura 2-parameter distance generated with Kimura’s
two parameter model in MEGA 3) [40-42] and pairwise geographic distances were tested using a Mantel
test implemented by Isolation By Distance Web Service [43].

Results
Sequence characteristics of three chloroplast intergenic
spacers

The aligned sequences of atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, and
psbA-trnH spacers in S. baicalensis and S. rehderiana
were 768, 799 and 502 base pairs in length, respectively. There were 13, 7, and 14 polymorphic sites
(including substitutions and indels) for the three
spacers, respectively (Table 2). Because sequencing
poly-N regions could easily lead to homoplasies due to
polymerase error [44], the short sequence repeats
(poly-C) between 502-508 bp of trnL-trnF were not
treated as polymorphic sites and were removed from
subsequent analyses. Sequence divergence, as measured
with Kimura two-parameter algorithm, ranged from
0.000% to 0.262%, 0.000% to 0.257%, and 0.000% to
0.559% for atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH,
respectively. Sequences of the three spacers conformed
to the expectation of neutrality by Tajima’s criterion
(atpB-rbcL:D = -1.53470, 0.10 > P > 0.05; trnL-trnF:
D = -1.31009, P > 0.10; and psbA-trnH:D = -1.38479,
P > 0.10) and Fu and Li’s criterion (atpB-rbcL: D* =
-1.66525, P > 0.10; F* = -1.79736, P > 0.10; trnL-trnF:
D* = -1.40980, P > 0.10; F* = -1.51361, P > 0.10; and
psbA-trnH: D* = -1.28584, P > 0.10; F* = -1.48316, P >
0.10). The pooled sequences of the three spacers also
complied with the expectation of neutrality (D =
-0.90417, P > 0.10; D* = -1.33584, P > 0.10; F* =
-1.40744, P > 0.10). The sequences of nine atpB-rbcL,
eight trnL-trnF, and thirteen psbA-trnH haplotypes
have been deposited in GenBank databases [GenBank:
GQ374124-GQ374155]. Thirty-two haplotypes of S.
baicalensis (HapA-Y and Hap1-7) and 2 haplotypes of
S. rehderiana (HapZ1-Z2) were identified when atpBrbcL, trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH sequences were combined (Table 2).
Haplotype network and distribution

In the haplotype network (Fig. 2), the 32 haplotypes of
S. baicalensis and 2 haplotypes of S. rehderiana differed
by at least 10 mutations. The genealogical structure of
32 haplotypes of S. baicalensis presented a shallow gene
tree with three obvious centers: HapG, HapB and HapC,
which connected to other 10, 6, and 4 haplotypes by
just one mutation, respectively. Additionally, both HapB
and HapC connected to HapG by one mutation. Exceptionally, several haplotypes detected only in wild populations were relatively remote to the three centers of the
shallow gene tree, such as HapA, H, M, T, W, X, and Y.
The haplotypes of cultivated S. baicalensis (symbolized
by ovals and circles) evenly distributed across the haplotype network, not showing any clusters.

Figure 2 Nested cladogram of 32 chloroplast haplotypes in Scutellaria baicalensis and two haplotypes in Scutellaria rehderiana. The
color of haplotypes refers to Fig. 1. The bold and italic numbers besides haplotypes represent the number of wild and cultivated individuals
with certain haplotype, respectively. Open small circles represent inferred interior nodes that were absent in the samples. Each branch indicates
one mutation.

Haplotype frequencies in each population and geographical distribution are presented in Fig. 1, Additional
file 1, and 2. By visual inspection of Fig. 1, the haplotype
distributions of wild and cultivated populations were in
sharp contrast. The most noticeable pattern was that
haplotypes among wild populations were much more
structured than those among cultivated populations. For
example, HapG in wild populations (WTW, LCW,
LPW, CD1W, SXW, and HXW) was mainly restricted
to the central range of this species, whereas this haplotype occurred in 17 of 22 cultivated populations across
the whole range. Another conspicuous phenomenon was
that many wild populations (10 out of 28) were fixed by
one unique haplotype, but in cultivated populations,

only SXC was fixed by one haplotype (i.e., most cultivated populations characterized by multiple haplotypes).
Genetic diversity and genetic structure

Of the 32 haplotypes detected in S. baicalensis, 25 (78%
of the total number of haplotypes) were recovered in
wild populations and 22 (69% of the total number of
haplotypes) were carried by cultivated individuals
(Fig. 3, Table 3). Fifteen haplotypes (47% of the total
number of haplotypes) were shared by wild and cultivated populations (Fig. 3). Ten haplotypes were found in
wild populations but not in cultivated ones, and seven
were found exclusively in cultivated populations (Fig. 3).
By comparison, the number of haplotypes and the

However, the change of haplotype frequencies between
wild and cultivated groups was not significant by x2 test
(P = 0.733; Table 3), because cultivated and wild groups
only differed in rare haplotypes (Fig. 3). As indicated by
the haplotype frequencies within population (Fig. 1,
see Additional file 1, 2), the within-population diversity

total haplotype diversity was similar between cultivated

that little genetic variation occurred between cultivated

genetic variance were among populations (56.61%) and
within populations (43.30%; Table 4). The genetic differentiation (FST = 0.022) between the cultivated and wild

with the result of AMOVA analysis.

Discussion
Slight reduction of genetic diversity and little change of
genetic composition in cultivated S. baicalensis

Cultivation of wild plants always produces genetic bottlenecks and thus results in loss of genetic diversity due
to founder effects and unconscious or conscious selections [8]. For example, only 23% of the total chloroplast
haplotypes detected in Oryza rufipogon and O. sativa
were recovered in the cultivated rice [29]. However,
concerns about the impacts of cultivation bottlenecks
are mostly concentrated on economically valuable crops
with long domestication history, little is known about
the genetic impacts of recent cultivation on medicinal

plants. In this study, slight reduction of genetic diversity
and little change of genetic composition during the cultivation of S. baicalensis were revealed (Fig. 3, Table 3).
These results are in sharp contrast to most crop species
with long cultivation histories and may be explained by
the large initial population size of cultivated S. baicalensis, the short cultivation history, and weak artificial
selection pressure.
The strength of genetic bottleneck during cultivation
is determined by two interacting factors: the size of the
bottlenecked population and the bottleneck’s duration
[8,45]. Intuitively, cultivated plants of multiple origins
(multiple places and multiple events) would hold larger

Yuan et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/29

population size and thus most likely maintain greater
genetic diversity [46]. This point has been supported by
a handful of empirical studies (e.g., Magnolia officinalis
var. biloba [16]; einkorn [47]; Spondias purpurea [6]),
although artificial selection and founder-event-induced
genetic drift over the course of subsequent domestication are capable of reducing genetic diversity in multiple-origin plants (e.g. [29,44]). In this study, different
lines of evidence support that cultivated S. baicalensis
could have originated from different places for multiple
times, resulting in large initial population size during
cultivation. First, a large proportion of haplotypes (47%
of the total number of haplotypes) were found in both
wild and cultivated populations and these shared haplotypes were recovered from different wild populations
(Fig. 1, 3). This even distribution pattern of shared
alleles in cultivated and wild populations strongly suggests that genetically distinct individuals from different
geographic regions were taken into cultivation and subsequently distributed by humans [44,48]. Second, no
cluster of cultivated haplotypes was observed in the haplotype network (Fig. 2), indicating that cultivated S. baicalensis is of multiple origins because crops of single
origin often form a monophyletic clade in a phylogenetic tree that includes wild progenitors [46].
According to the tremendous literature of traditional
Chinese medicine, Huang-qin was rarely cultivated until
the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in
1949 [27]. However, over the past several decades, the
wild resource of this species declined rapidly because of
over-exploitation. To meet the increasing demand for
the root of this species, large-scale cultivation began
since 1958 [27]. Such a short cultivation history, in combination with the large initial population size, may be
unlikely to produce a strong genetic bottleneck, resulting in significant reduction of genetic diversity and
change in genetic composition of cultivated S. baicalensis. Other population genetic studies on recently-cultivated Chinese medicinal plants also suggested that high
genetic diversity in cultivated populations is due to their
slight cultivation bottlenecks [15-17], which provides
genetic raw materials for breeding new varieties of medicinal plants.
Apart from demographic factors, selection is another
important element in shaping the genetic diversity pattern of cultivated species. Artificial selection for desired
traits can decrease genetic diversity of target loci and
their linked loci beyond that caused by the bottlenecks
[8]. The fact that only few cultivars of S. baicalensis
have been officially registered in China [49] suggests
that artificial selection on this cultivated medicinal herb
is weak, which resulting in only slight reduction of
genetic diversity during cultivation. In addition, the
relaxation in selective constraint under cultivated

Page 10 of 13

conditions might also contribute to the high genetic
diversity within cultivated S. baicalensis populations
because relaxation of selective constraint allow the accumulation of mutations that may otherwise be deleterious
in nature [50,51]. However, considering the short cultivation history of S. baicalensis, the relaxation of selective constraint might play limited role in molding the
genetic diversity pattern of cultivated Huang-qin.
Extensive seed exchange among cultivated S. baicalensis
populations

Cultivation impacts not only the amount of genetic variation contained in cultivated populations but also the
structure of this variation [48,52,53]. In this study, we
found that the cultivated S. baicalensis populations displayed a lower proportion of genetic variation among
populations (GST = 0.220) than wild populations (GST =
0.701). In addition, Mantel test analyses showed that the
effect of geographical isolation on genetic structure was
significant in wild populations (r = 0.4346, P < 0.0010;
Fig. 4), but not in cultivated populations (r = 0.0599,
P = 0.2710; Fig. 4). These results suggest that cultivation
has imposed a profound impact on the genetic structure
of cultivated S. baicalensis. However, these findings run
contrary to the results of Hamrick and Godt [53], which
reported that the mean value of genetic differentiation
among crop species (GST = 0.339) is higher than that of
noncrop species (GST = 0.212).
Two possible reasons may account for the unusual
pattern revealed in S. baicalensis. First, there has been
insufficient time for artificial selection and breeding to
exert influence on the genetic divergence of cultivated
S. baicalensis. The crop species (i.e. Zea mays, Hordeum
vulgare, etc.) summarized in the review of Hamrick and
Godt [53] almost have long histories of cultivation.
Long-term artificial selection and inbreeding within cultivars imposed by plant breeding could have resulted in
the genetic variation occurring generally among cultivars
[52,54,55]. However, for S. baicalensis, due to its short
cultivation history, artificial selection and breeding cultivars are unlikely to promote the genetic differentiation
of cultivated populations as suggested by few S. baicalensis cultivars in China [49]. This fact indicates that
standard industrial cultivation, a practice possibly
imposing high artificial selection pressure on medicinal
herbs, has not been established for S. baicalensis [4].
Second, homogenization among cultivated populations
as well as high within-population diversity could have
been facilitated by extensive seed exchange among different geographic locations due to highly developed
transportation and commercial markets of modern
times. A study of pepino (Solanum muricatum), a herbaceous Andean domesticate, suggested that human
interchange among communities and countries in the

Yuan et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/29

past 50 years or so has considerably weakened the geographic differentiation of genetic diversity of cultivated
pepinos [9]. For Chinese cultivated medicinal plants,
such as Coptis chinensis, Magnolia officinalis, the bulking and mixing of seeds from different geographic locations are the common practice, which produced lower
genetic differentiation among cultivated populations
[16,17]. However, the genetic markers (ISSR and AFLP)
used in those studies are biparentally transmitted, incapable of ruling out the effects of seed flow on genetic
structure. In this study, by using maternally inherited
chloroplast markers which can trace seed flow among
populations [6,29], we found that the effects of geographical isolation were significant in wild populations (r =
0.4346, P < 0.0010; Fig. 4) but disappeared in cultivated
populations (r = 0.0599, P = 0.2710; Fig. 4). In addition,
the haplotype distribution maps also visualize that common haplotypes are much more widespread in cultivated
S. baicalensis than in wild populations. For example,
HapG in wild populations (WTW, LCW, LPW, CD1W,
SXW, and HXW) is mainly restricted to the central
range of this species, whereas this haplotype occurred in
17 of 22 cultivated populations (Fig. 1). These patterns
explicitly demonstrate that homogenization among cultivated populations and high within-population diversity
should be mostly due to seed exchange mediated by
human activities under cultivation.
Conservation implications of S. baicalensis cultivation

It has long been argued that traditional agriculture can
serve as an important reservoir of genetic variability
[5,56]. For example, by taking the jocote (Spondias purpurea), a small tree that bears fruit similar to tiny
mongo in Mesoamerica, out of its natural, wild habitats
and planting them in yards and other means of cultivation, farmers in the Mesoamerican region have helped
to preserve the jocote’s diversity [48]. Likewise, traditional cultivations is also an effective way for the maintenance and conservation of gene pools of medicinal
plants, as evidenced by the studies of Guo et al. [15]
and He et al. [16]. According to our investigation, the
cultivation practices for S. baicalensis are also in traditional ways. Usually, farmers collected the seeds of S.
baicalensis directly from local wild resources and then
cultivated in the field. Sometimes, the germplasm can be
dispersed to other places by their relatives or friends or
by sale in the markets. Slight reduction of genetic diversity and little change of genetic composition in cultivated S. baicalensis, as well as a few specific haplotypes
of cultivated group, confirm the effectiveness of saving
plant diversity through local cultivation. This study
further suggests that bringing wild medicinal plants into
cultivation from different locations may help to widen
the genetic background of cultivated populations, which

Page 11 of 13

will be beneficial for the sustainable utilization of natural resources.
Although cultivation is an effective strategy for preserving genetic resources of S. baicalensis, the wild
resources still need to be protected in situ. This study
did not find significant reduction of genetic diversity
and apparent change of genetic composition in cultivated S. baicalensis, however, this pattern reflects mainly
the changes of common haplotypes rather than rare
alleles. In fact, 10 out of 25 haplotypes within wild
populations have lost during the course of S. baicalensis
cultivation. The results conform to the theoretical
expectation that bottlenecks of short duration may have
little effect on heterozygosity (here represented by haplotype diversity, hT) but will reduce severely the number
of rare alleles [57]. Rare alleles are often considered a
minor element in genetic conservation programs and yet
they can be very important for long-term evolution or to
meet new breeding objectives such as resistance to
introduced insects or diseases [57]. It is therefore desirable to maintain rare alleles of S. baicalensis through
in situ conservation of wild populations.
Seed exchange during the course of S. baicalensis cultivation exerts a significant impact on the genetic architecture of cultivated S. baicalensis and may also have
profound implications for the conservation and utility of
S. baicalensis germplasm. Genetic mixture induced by
extensive seed exchange means that a fraction of cultivated populations may be sufficient to preserve most
genetic variation of S. baicalensis. This will undoubtedly
facilitate the conservation of genetic diversity of S. baicalensis through cultivation. However, numerous theoretical and empirical studies have suggested that genetic
mixture of populations that are adapted to different
local conditions could result in outbreeding depression,
the reduction in fitness caused by the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes [58]. Extensive seed exchange
may increase the risk of maladaptation and reduced
growth or fertility resulting from maladaptation could
reduce the success of cultivation projects and jeopardize
the long-term survival of wild populations [59]. The
evolutionary and practical consequences of extensive
seed exchange of S. baicalensis are unknown so far,
more studies are crucially needed to monitor the potentially negative impacts of seed exchange on the adaptation of wild populations and the growth of cultivated
populations.

Conclusions
Facing the rapidly growing demands for medicinal
plants, domestic cultivation is a viable and long-term
way of protecting wild medicinal plant resources [3].
However, this study indicates that bringing a species
into cultivation may impose profound impacts on

Yuan et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/29

genetic diversity patterns and even the evolutionary
potentials of medicinal plants. Although the total
genetic diversity maintained in cultivated S. baicalensis
is comparable to wild populations due to the large
initial population size and the short cultivation history,
substantial rare alleles have lost and extensive seed
exchange has caused the homogenization of cultivated
populations during the course of cultivation. This
study not only provides baseline data for preserving
genetic resource of S. baicalensis through conservation-by-cultivation approach, but also represents a
paradigm for evaluating the genetic impacts of recent
cultivation on medicinal plants, which may be instructive to future cultivation projects of traditional Chinese
medicinal plants.
