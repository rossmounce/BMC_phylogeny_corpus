Abstract
Background: As in other eukaryotes, plant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades
are composed of three classes of hierarchically organized protein kinases, namely MAPKKKs,
MAPKKs, and MAPKs. These modules rapidly amplify and transduce extracellular signals into
various appropriate intracellular responses. While extensive work has been conducted on the
post-translational regulation of specific MAPKKs and MAPKs in various plant species, there has
been no systematic investigation of the genomic organization and transcriptional regulation of these
genes.
Results: Ten putative poplar MAPKK genes (PtMKKs) and 21 putative poplar MAPK genes (PtMPKs)
have been identified and located within the poplar (Populus trichocarpa) genome. Analysis of exonintron junctions and of intron phase inside the predicted coding region of each candidate gene has
revealed high levels of conservation within and between phylogenetic groups. Expression profiles
of all members of these two gene families were also analyzed in 17 different poplar organs, using
gene-specific primers directed at the 3'-untranslated region of each candidate gene and real-time
quantitative PCR. Most PtMKKs and PtMPKs were differentially expressed across this developmental
series.
Conclusion: This analysis provides a complete survey of MAPKK and MAPK gene expression
profiles in poplar, a large woody perennial plant, and thus complements the extensive expression
profiling data available for the herbaceous annual Arabidopsis thaliana. The poplar genome is marked
by extensive segmental and chromosomal duplications, and within both kinase families, some
recently duplicated paralogous gene pairs often display markedly different patterns of expression,
consistent with the rapid evolution of specialized protein functions in this highly adaptive species.

Background
Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family
are involved in major signaling pathways in all eukaryotes
[1]. These pathways, which are typically activated by intracellular or environmental cues, usually consist of three
hierarchically organized protein kinases. The first component of this module, the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK),
activates a downstream MAPK kinase (MAPKK) through
double serine-threonine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated MAPKK then acts as a dual-specificity protein
kinase to activate the third component of the pathway, i.e.
MAPK, via phosphorylation of specific threonine and
tyrosine residues in a T-X-Y motif located within the activation loop of the protein. At this point, activated MAPKs
can modulate various cellular activities through activation
of other protein kinases, or metabolic enzymes, or by
phosphorylation of transcription factors and components
of the cytoskeleton. Important links between MAPK activities and fundamental processes like cell proliferation/differentiation and defence responses have been established
from extensive studies performed in human, mouse and
yeast systems [2].
MAPK cascades are also present in plants [3-5], where they
have been involved in a wide variety of phenomena,
including plant responses to biotic, abiotic and oxidative
challenges [6-9], hormone signaling [10-12], plant cytokinesis [13] and pollen development [14]. The Arabidopsis
thaliana genome encodes at least 60 MAPKKKs, 10 MAPKKs and 20 MAPKs [4] but most of these proteins have not
been functionally characterized. The plant MAPKK and
MAPK families have both diverged into four major groups
(A, B, C and D). MAPKs belonging to groups A, B and C
all possess a TEY motif in their activation loop, while
members of group D harbor a TDY motif. The most extensively studied plant MAPKs are Arabidopsis AtMPK3 and
AtMPK6, and their Nicotiana tabacum orthologs, NtWIPK
and NtSIPK, respectively. These group A MAPKs have been
involved in non-host disease resistance [15,16], gene-forgene defence signal transduction [17,18], wounding
response [19] and ethylene production [20,21]. They also
appear to act as positive regulators of the hypersensitive
response (HR) [22], a defence-related form of programmed cell death. In rice (Oryza sativa), several MAPKs
have also been characterized and display similar stress
response functions, as well as developmental regulation
[23-25].
The cellular functions in which MAPKs participate are
mainly dependent on their phosphorylation status. In single-celled organisms like yeast, post-translational mechanisms seem to account for most of the regulation of the
MAPK cascades, with little evidence of transcriptional regulation. On the other hand, in multicellular eukaryotes,
MAPK cascades regulation often occurs at the transcrip-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

tional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels
[26]. In mammals, the duration of MAPK activation can
depend on the nature of the stimulus, and these differences in the temporal pattern of activation can lead to distinct physiological responses in the cell [27]. This has also
been demonstrated in tobacco, where transient activation
of NtMEK2 (a stress-responsive MAPKK) and its downstream effector, NtSIPK, induces strong expression of
defence-related genes, whereas sustained activation of the
same proteins leads to the activation of NtWIPK and subsequent cell death [22]. Compartmentalization and
organization of yeast and mammalian MAPK cascade
components by scaffolding proteins [28,29]. can also contribute to signaling specificity [2]. For plants, there is no
published data involving scaffolding proteins in MAPK
signaling, but a recent report has described the formation
of protein complexes that include stress responsive
MAPKs [30]. Subcellular compartmentalization of MAPK
components may also be critical to their function in
plants, since treatment of Petroselinum crispum cells with a
Phytophthora-derived elicitor resulted in the translocation
of three cytosolic MAPKs to the nucleus, where they are
thought to interact with transcription factors [31].
Regulation of MAPKs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels can also play an important role in controlling the MAPK cascades function. Alternative splicing
has been observed for the mammalian MAPK ERK1
[26,32], as well as for the Arabidopsis MAPKKK gene, ANP1
[33], and the rice MAPK gene, OsMPK5 [34]. Moreover,
strong up-regulation in the expression of some plant
MAPK genes is seen in response to stress, including
tobacco NtWIPK [15], tomato LeMPK3 [8], alfalfa
MsMMK4 [35] and rice OsBWMK1 [36] and OsMSRMK3
[25]. Finally, some plant MAPKs display organ-specific
expression, suggesting that their function is spatially and/
or temporally delimited. For example, the Petunia hybrida
MAPK gene, PMEK 1, is preferentially expressed in reproductive female organs [37], while the tobacco MAPK gene
Ntf4 (a close relative of the stress-responsive MAPK gene
NtSIPK) is expressed only in certain organs such as pollen
grains, developing embryos and mature embryos [38].
Transcriptional regulation of MAPK cascade components
thus appears to provide an important level of control in
plants, suggesting that systematic analysis of their transcriptional patterning in a given plant species should provide insight into potential biological functions of specific
classes of these signaling components. The development
of transcriptomic databases (microarray and others) in
some model plant species such as Arabidopsis and rice has
made it possible to track, in silico, the expression profile of
a given MAPK gene. The recent availability of a genome
sequence from Populus trichocarpa now opens up the possibility to investigate, based on transcriptional regulation,

the possible involvement of specific MAPK gene family
member(s) in organ development processes that are
unique to woody species. In this paper, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the organ-specific expression
patterns for all predicted poplar MAPK and MAPKK genes.
Correlation of these data with structural analysis of both
the MAPKK and the MAPK gene families also revealed distinct expression patterns within recently duplicated (paralogous) gene pairs, suggestive of rapid evolution of
specialized signaling protein functions in this highly
adaptable woody perennial.

Results
Genomic distribution of poplar MAPK and MAPKK genes
Previous analysis of the genome sequence of poplar (Populus trichocarpa) had identified robust gene models corresponding to all the MAPK (PtMPK) and MAPKK (PtMKK)
family members [39]. With this information, we were able
to obtain an overview of the chromosomal distribution of
these important signaling components. PtMPK genes are
distributed over 12 of the 19 poplar chromosomes (Figure
1). Chromosomes I and II both carry three divergent
PtMPK genes, whereas chromosomes V, VII and X display

two PtMPK genes each. The remaining poplar MAPK genes
are unique with respect to their chromosomal location.
PtMPK7 and PtMPK18 have not yet been assigned to any
linkage group, and therefore remain positioned on their
respective scaffolds. Interestingly, although there are
numerous PtMPK paralogs displaying high levels of
sequence similarity, they are distributed all across the
genome and do not form clusters containing closely
related genes as may have been expected if they originated
from local duplication events. This pattern probably
reflects the series of whole genome, chromosomal and
large segmental duplication events that typify the poplar
genome (G. Tuskan, personal communication).
PtMKK genes also display a scattered genomic distribution
(Figure 2) across six of the 19 poplar chromosomes, with
three (PtMKK6, PtMKK7 and PtMKK10) of the 11 gene
models located on unattributed scaffolds. Only chromosomes VIII and X contain more than one PtMKK gene.

Exon and intron organization of poplar MAPK and
MAPKK genes
Analysis of the pattern of exon-intron junctions can provide important insights into the evolution of gene families. Therefore, we extracted data regarding predicted exon
and intron distribution for the coding regions of all
PtMPKs and PtMKKs (Figures 3 and 4) as well as for all
Arabidopsis putative orthologs (AtMPKs, Figure 5 and AtMKKs, Figure 6). Group A PtMPKs exhibit a highly conserved
distribution of exons and introns (Figure 3) consisting of
six exons of conserved length, and five introns of conserved or variable sizes. PtMPKs belonging to group B also
possess six exons, with lengths similar to those found in
group A PtMPKs, while the associated introns vary in size
between the different members of group B. Group C
PtMPKs are each composed of only two exons with strictly
conserved or very similar sizes. PtMPK14 is the only group
C member with a shorter intron (398 vs ~ 1200 base pairs
for the other three members).

In contrast to these three highly conserved structural patterns, group D PtMPKs possess a complex distribution of
exons and introns, including different pattern subsets
within the same phylogenetic group. For instance,
PtMPK9-1 and PtMPK9-2 are both composed of 11 exons,
whereas PtMPK16-1, PtMPK16-2, PtMPK19, PtMPK20-1
and PtMPK20-2 all possess ten. Despite some modest differences in the length of particular exons, it is clear that
the exon structural pattern is well conserved not only
between close paralogs (e.g. PtMPK16-1 and PtMPK16-2),
but also between group D PtMPKs that apparently
diverged following earlier duplication events (e.g.,
PtMPK16-1 and PtMPK19). These same patterns are also
found in the Arabidopsis MPK gene family with the exception of group B MPKs, which display three different patterns of exon-intron distribution (Figure 5).
The MKK genes display two strikingly different structural
patterns in both poplar and Arabidopsis (Figures 4 and 6).
Members of group C and D MKKs have a completely
intronless configuration, whereas the group B MKK3s and
all group A MKKs possess numerous exon and intron junctions. In poplar, PtMKK2-1, PtMKK2-2 and PtMKK6 show
quite strong exon length conservation, with the exception
of an additional 17 base pairs exon in PtMKK2-1. PtMKK3,
on the other hand, has a completely unique exonic structure, consistent with both its evolutionary distinctiveness
[39] and the presence of an unusual C-terminal NTF2
domain that is not found in any other MKK group.
Intron phase (i.e., the position of an intron within a
codon; phase 0 when lying before the first base, phase 1
when lying after the first base and phase 2 when lying after
the second base) was also assessed for all PtMPK and
PtMKK gene models (Figures 3 and 4), as well as for all
AtMPK and AtMKK gene models (Figures 5 and 6). For
both PtMPKs (58%) and PtMKKs (73%), the majority of
introns are within phase 0, while 23% of introns found in
both poplar protein kinase families are within phase 2.
Phase 1 introns represent 19% of all PtMPKs introns and
only 4% of all PtMKKs introns. For Arabidopsis, similar
numbers are found (Figures 5 and 6), except that there are
no phase 1 introns predicted within AtMKK genes.
The association of two adjacent introns in eukaryotic
genes can be in any of nine different intron phase combinations, leading to two classes of exons: symmetric exons
(0-0), (1-1), (2-2) and asymmetric exons (0-1), (0-2), (10), (1-2), (2-0), (2-1). For poplar MPKs, 51% of all exons
are symmetric and the great majority of these are (0-0)
exons (79%). A similar picture is found in Arabidopsis,
where 54% of AtMPKs exons are symmetric. Once again
the majority of these are (0-0) exons (85%). No symmetric exons harboring the (1-1) configuration are found in
any of the poplar or Arabidopsis MPK gene models. For the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

PtMKK and AtMKK gene families, we respectively found
58% and 68% of symmetric exons and for both species, all
of these symmetric exons are in the (0-0) configuration.
For both plants, the most frequent asymmetric exons
found in MPKs and MKKs are those belonging to the (01), (0-2) and (2-0) configurations.
Real-time quantitative PCR data normalization and
general considerations
The real-time, fluorescence-based reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) technique has
become a method of choice because of its wide dynamic
range, sensitivity and robust quantification of mRNA levels. In contrast to microarray profiling, transcript accumulation (TA) of closely-related gene members can also be
easily discriminated in RTqPCR by using oligonucleotide
primers specific to unique gene signatures. Such comparisons are only valid, however, if the chosen primer sets display comparable efficiencies in their ability to amplify
targeted amplicons. We therefore tested all the selected
primer sets against genomic DNA from three different
genetic backgrounds, namely Populus trichocarpa (Nisqually-1), Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides (H11-11)
and Populus deltoides (ST-70). In these assays, most primer
sets yielded a very similar Ct value (around 21 for most
genes) across the three different genetic backgrounds (see
additional file 1). This indicates that these primer pairs
can equally hybridize to the P. trichocarpa alleles in the
Nisqually-1 background, to the P. deltoides alleles in the
ST-70 background and most importantly to both the P. trichocarpa and the P. deltoides alleles in the H11-11 hybrid,
which was used in this study to monitor PtMPK and
PtMKK expression profiles. On the other hand, primer
pairs specific for PtMPK2, PtMPK4, PtMPK9-2, PtMPK162, PtMKK4 and PtMKK7 all display higher Ct values in the
P. deltoides background. This reflects that these gene specific primer pairs preferentially hybridize to the P. trichocarpa allele in the hybrid genotype, and that TA
obtained on cDNA (see below) might slightly underestimate the actual level of expression since the P. deltoides
allelic contribution is not perfectly captured. This observation could be related to lower primer set efficiency, resulting from polymorphism within the 3'UTR region of the
different alleles. Nevertheless, melting curve and gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed single product amplification for all respective MPKs and MKKs in the three poplar
genotypes (data not shown). Moreover, within one particular genetic background, the steady Ct value obtained for
the different MPKs and MKKs confirmed that for a constant number of target sequences (e.g., 5 ng of DNA), each
primer set gave a similar Ct value (see additional file 1).
This clearly demonstrates the similar efficiencies of the
various primer sets used in this study, and allows direct
gene-to-gene comparisons of the levels of expression
detected in the various organs sampled.

Finally, the use of internal standard candidate genes that
display relatively stable expression over time and between
tissues or organs allows sample-to-sample normalization
of the RTqPCR expression data. In the present study, the
use of RTqPCR primers specific for a cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (cdc2) gene revealed generally consistent levels of
cdc2 TA in different organs from poplar (Figure 7A, B, C),
with less than two-fold variation observed across most
vegetative organs, and in suspension-cultured cells (Figure
8). Slightly higher transcript abundance of cdc2 was
detected in actively growing organs, such as floral and
foliar buds, where CDC2 is likely involved in cell-cycle
progression [40,41]. Therefore, cdc2 expression levels provided a good normalization baseline. In addition, since
Actin 2 (Act2) has been stated to be a good internal control
gene for RTqPCR studies across various poplar organs
[42], we have used this candidate as housekeeping gene.
TA for Act2 proved to be quite stable across most organs,
with a maximum five-fold increase from mature leaf to
upper stem (Figure 8). This level of variation seems relatively low considering the wide diversity of tissues tested
in our survey (from meristematic organs such as buds to
mature leaves). Moreover, our results revealed that two
poplar MAPKs (PtMPK6-1/6-2) display quite constant TA
in all assayed organs (Figure 8). The highest TA was
detected in the female floral bud sample, but this level of
expression represents only a one-fold increase in comparison to the average TA in all organs. Finally, PtMKK2-2 was
also detected at low but constant levels in all tested
organs. The respective TA levels for cdc2, Act2, PtMPK6-1,
PtMPK6-2 and PtMKK2-2 across many different organ
types provide confirmation that an appropriate and consistent dosage of cDNA was used in the various RTqPCR
reactions. In our analysis, TA levels corresponding to <100
transcript molecules per ng total RNA were scored as 'very
low', values of 100–400 as 'moderate', values >400 as
'high', and values >1000 as 'very high'. Levels <10 were
treated as effectively zero.
Poplar MAPK and MAPKK gene expression patterns
Virtually all PtMPKs and PtMKKs are expressed in all
organs analyzed, but their level of expression varies considerably. Regardless of the phylogenetic groups or organs
examined, the TA for PtMPKs generally fluctuates between
moderate to very high levels (See additional file 2). Members of group D MPKs show TA levels of ~1500 transcript
molecules per ng of total RNA, while members of the
group A, B and C MPKs show lower levels, around 400–
600. For the PtMKK gene family, the most highly
expressed members are those belonging to group C (TA
>1600, see additional file 3). Group B and D MKK genes
have similar levels of TA (~1100–1600). Finally, group A
MKK genes are the most weakly expressed, with on average 550 transcript molecules per ng of total RNA.

MAPKs
Group A MPKs
The most extensively studied plant MAPKs belong to
Group A which, in Arabidopsis, consists of three members,
AtMPK3, AtMPK6 and AtMPK10 [4]. No direct putative
ortholog of AtMPK10 has been detected in the poplar
genome, but phylogenetic analysis [39] revealed the presence of two closely-related poplar presumed orthologs for
the defense-related genes AtMPK3 (PtMPK3-1 and 3-2)
and AtMPK6 (PtMPK6-1 and 6-2). In most organs, the
expression of both PtMPK3-1 and 3-2 is lower than that of
PtMPK6-1 and 6-2 (Figure 9; see additional file 2).
PtMPK3-1 is relatively strongly expressed in roots and
xylem, in comparison to other samples. In most organs
PtMPK3-1 tends to be slightly more expressed than
PtMPK3-2. However, this pattern is reversed in the four
types of buds (male and female floral buds, lateral and terminal foliar buds) as well as in both types of catkins.
PtMPK6-1 and 6-2 both show similar expression profiles
across many organs, but TA for PtMPK6-1 becomes
slightly more pronounced than that of its paralog in all
four types of buds, in both types of catkins and in suspension-cultured cells.
Group B MPKs
There is less information on the biological roles of the
other MAPK groups in plants, although some reports have
suggested the potential involvement of group B MPK
genes in response to environmental stresses as well as in
cell development [4]. In poplar, PtMPK11 and PtMPK5-2,
the most highly expressed of the four group B MAPK
genes, are particularly actively transcribed in male and
female floral buds (Figure 9). By contrast, the paralogous
PtMPK5-1 gene shows the lowest level of TA within this
group.
Group C MPKs
Among the group C MPKs, it has been reported that the
tobacco Ntf3 gene is expressed in pollen [43] and that the
Arabidopsis AtMPK7 gene has circadian rhythm-regulated
patterns of expression [44]. The most highly expressed of
the four poplar group C MPK genes is PtMPK7, with elevated TA levels detected in female catkin, buds, phloem,
xylem, mature leaves (LPI 12) and roots (Figure 9). This
gene is also differentially expressed in particular developmental stages of specific organs, with more abundant
transcripts detected in floral buds (male and female) than
in either type of catkin. A similar situation is observed for
leaves, where PtMPK7 TA is more pronounced in mature
leaves than in young leaves. This is similar to what has
been reported for the rice putative ortholog OsMAPK4
(now annotated as OsMPK7 [39]), whose expression is
higher in mature leaves than in young leaves [45].

Steady-state transcript accumulation for cdc2, Act2 and three kinase genes throughout the surveyed organs (indicated at the
bottom of the figure). After determination of RTqPCR primers efficiency and generation of standard curves, RTqPCR analysis
was performed for cdc2, Act2, and for two poplar MPKs as well as for one poplar MKK. Twelve nanograms of cDNA were used
in each RTqPCR reaction. Results are expressed in number of specific transcripts per ng of total RNA. Values represent the
mean of six independent reactions (two repeats for each of three independent samples). Cts were determined using single fluorescent readings that were taken after each cycle.

Group D MPKs
The group D MPKs represent the largest group of MPKs in
poplar, as they do in Arabidopsis and rice [4,39]. In rice
and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), two group D MAPK genes
(OsBMWK1 and MsTDY1) are induced transcriptionally
by pathogen challenge and wounding, respectively
[36,46] Activated OsBMWK1 (now annotated as
OsMPK17-1 [39]) has also been shown to phosphorylate
a transcription factor that binds a cis-acting element in the
promoter of defence-related genes [47].

In poplar, PtMPK17 is the most highly expressed of the
group D MPK genes and, indeed, it is the most highly
expressed among all the MPK and MKK genes (Figure 9).
On the other hand, the most weakly expressed group D
MPK genes, PtMPK9-1 and PtMPK9-2, display low transcript levels in all organs with the noteworthy exception of
all types of buds, and cell suspensions. As previously
observed in other MPK groups, some members of the
group D MPK genes seem to represent the paralogous
products of recent genomic duplication events, since they
possess a very high degree of sequence similarity, are
located on different chromosomes and have only one

direct putative ortholog in Arabidopsis [39]. PtMPK16-1
and PtMPK16-2 are particularly interesting paralogs, since
they have very similar expression profiles in most organs,
including male and female catkins. On the other hand,
PtMPK16-1 is strongly expressed in male and female floral
buds, whereas expression of PtMPK16-2 is barely detectable in these reproductive organs.
MAPKKs
Group A MKKs
In other plant species, some group A MKKs appear to be
functionally associated with group B MPKs [48,49] These
phosphotransfer relationships have been involved in
responses to abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis, and in cell
development in tobacco. As in Arabidopsis, there are three
group A MKK genes found in poplar. PtMKK2-2 shows
low but constant levels of TA in all tested organs (Figure
10; see additional file 3), while the paralogous PtMKK2-1
is much more highly expressed. Higher expression of
PtMKK6, on the other hand, seems to be associated with
proliferating organs such as apex, floral and terminal
buds, cell suspensions, and young leaves (LPI 1), with a
25-fold decrease in PtMKK6 expression levels observed

Steady-state transcript accumulation for all members of the four phylogenetic groups of PtMKK genes
Figure 10
Steady-state transcript accumulation for all members of the four phylogenetic groups of PtMKK genes. After determination of
RTqPCR primers efficiency and generation of standard curves, RTqPCR analysis was performed for each poplar MAPKK gene.
Twelve nanograms of cDNA were used in each RTqPCR reaction. Results are expressed in number of specific transcripts per
ng of total RNA. Values represent the mean of six independent reactions (two repeats for each of three independent samples).
Cts were determined using single fluorescent readings that were taken after each cycle.

along the foliar developmental gradient from young to
mature leaves. Interestingly, the presumed Arabidopsis and
tobacco orthologs of PtMKK6 have been involved in regulation of cytokinesis and cell division [13], suggesting that
this protein may play an analogous role in poplar tissues.
Group B MKKs
Group B MKKs in poplar are represented by a single gene,
PtMKK3. This is also seen in Arabidopsis (AtMKK3) and
rice (OsMKK3) [39]. MKKs of this class are unique in
encoding a characteristic MKK protein kinase domain
fused in C-terminal to a putative nuclear transport factor
2 (NTF2) domain [4]. No biological functions have yet
been assigned to plant MKK3s, but PtMKK3 has moderate
to relatively high expression levels across all organs (TA
between 400 to 2600), with the highest levels detected in
female floral buds, lateral foliar buds and cell suspensions
(Figure 10).
Group C MKKs
Among the plant MKKs, attention has been largely
focused on those found in group C because of their demonstrated roles in stress signaling. Ectopic expression of
constitutively-activated versions of the tobacco NtMEK2
protein, and of other group C MKKs, has been used to
demonstrate that they are capable of phosphorylating and
thus activating stress-responsive Group A MPKs [50-52].
Poplar possesses two group C MKKs, PtMKK4 and
PtMKK5, both of which are expressed. Of the two,
PtMKK5 shows higher TA in most organs, while the
expression of PtMKK4 only predominates in suspensioncultured cells (Figure 10).
Group D MKKs
Limited functional information is available for group D
MKKs, of which there are five encoded representatives in
the poplar genome (PtMKK7, PtMKK9, PtMKK10,
PtMKK11-1 and PtMKK11-2). However, our RTqPCR analysis suggests that only PtMKK7 and PtMKK9 are clearly
expressed (Figure 10). The other three genes may therefore
be pseudogenes, or be expressed only under circumstances that were not tested in our survey. The pseudogene
hypothesis is also supported by the observation of structural differences in normally conserved motifs within the
predicted PtMKK10, 11-1 and 11-2 protein kinase
domains, and by the apparent absence of expression data
for the Arabidopsis (AtMKK10) and rice (OsMKK10-1/10-2)
putative orthologs [39].

While both PtMKK7 and PtMKK9 expression could be
detected, the patterns differ significantly across organs
and developmental stages (Figure 10). PtMKK9 expression is generally more pronounced except in secondary
xylem, cell suspensions, primary phloem and xylem cambium-enriched, where PtMKK7 predominates. PtMKK9 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

particularly highly expressed in mature leaves (LPI 12),
where it reaches close to 10 000 transcript molecules per
ng of total RNA, in contrast to the younger leaf sample
(LPI1). The levels of transcript accumulation for PtMKK7
are on the other hand relatively constant across most
organs. This striking difference in expression pattern has
also been observed in Arabidopsis expression databases for
AtMKK7 and AtMKK9 [53] where AtMKK9 transcription is
most strongly associated with mature or senescing leaves.

Discussion
The genomic organization of poplar MAPK and MAPKK
genes clearly reflects the impact of whole genome duplications, of chromosomal duplications and of large-scale segmental duplications on the expansion of gene families.
This is especially true for Populus, since genes represented
by individual models in Arabidopsis are frequently found
as unclustered paralogous gene sets in poplar. This mode
of expansion is not unique to the MAPK and MAPKK
genes, since a similar phenomenon has been observed for
the poplar cellulose synthase (CesA) gene family [54]. The
absence of tandemly duplicated gene clusters within the
poplar MAPK and MAPKK gene families is also shared by
other plant species including Arabidopsis and rice [39].
Comparative analysis of exon-intron junctions within the
coding region of Arabidopsis MAPK and MAPKK gene families [55] and their poplar counterparts also highlights the
conservation of these signaling components. Hence,
group A and group C MPKs in both species display identical numbers of exons (six and two, respectively), and the
sizes of the exons as well as the intron phases are
extremely well conserved. These findings show that the
respective degree of conservation of group A and group C
MPK genes extends beyond primary sequence identity and
is likely to be a feature of these genes in all eudicots.
A more complex situation exists for group B MPKs, where
all group B PtMPKs contain six exons, while only two out
of five group B AtMPKs (AtMPK4 and AtMPK12) display
this organization. Nevertheless, except in PtMPK5-1, the
phases of the various introns found in these gene models
are also perfectly conserved. These gene models might
thus share a common evolutionary history. On the other
hand, AtMPK5, AtMPK11 and AtMPK13 all possess four
exons with variable intron phase combinations. These
combinations are not observed in any poplar MPKs. This
suggests that the Arabidopsis group B MPK gene family has
evolved differently than the corresponding poplar family.
It is possible that one of the ancestral genes that gave rise
to the present group B AtMPK family was not transmitted
to poplar when these species diverged or that the precursor gene was lost during poplar evolution. Alternatively,
the generation of the four exon configurations observed in

Page 15 of 22

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:223

Arabidopsis was the result of a duplication event that followed species divergence.
For group D MPKs, despite more complex configurations
of exons and introns, it is possible to recognize that the
respective putative orthologs between Arabidopsis and
poplar display similar or sometimes even identical exon
organization, with very well conserved exon length and
intron phase. The only exception in this regard is
AtMPK15, which possesses a unique seven exon composition within its coding region. This pattern is not observed
for any other Arabidopsis or poplar MPK genes and indeed,
no direct putative ortholog of AtMPK15 can be detected in
the poplar genome. This AtMPK gene might therefore
have arisen in Arabidopsis after species divergence, or
might have been lost during poplar evolution.
At the level of MAPKKs, phylogenetic conservation of
exon length and of exon-intron junctions is also generally
observed. Hence, in group A MKKs, both the AtMKK2 and
AtMKK6 coding regions are composed of eight exons,
which is identical to the structure of their respective predicted orthologs in poplar, PtMKK2-2 and PtMKK6. In
addition intron phase configuration is identical among
these genes. On the other hand, the AtMKK1 coding
region consists of six exons, a pattern that is not conserved
in the coding region of the closest poplar putative
ortholog, PtMKK2-1, which is constituted of nine exons.
For group B MKKs, despite the high level of predicted protein sequence similarity between AtMKK3 and PtMKK3,
the number of exons within their respective coding
regions differs (eight exons for AtMKK3; nine for
PtMKK3). However, this lack of conservation in the exon
and intron organization is not caused by the kinase
domain evolutionary status. In fact, the regions encoding
the protein kinase domain are well conserved in terms of
exon count, exon length and intron phase and differences
between these two gene models are found at the end of
the coding regions (within the NTF2 domain of the corresponding encoded proteins). Finally, as reported earlier
[4], both the Arabidopsis group C and D MKKs display an
intronless configuration. This trait is fully conserved
within both poplar group C and group D MKK gene families.
Overall, exon lengths in both the Arabidopsis and poplar
MPKs and MKKs are clearly more conserved than intron
lengths. This indicates stronger negative selection for
alteration of corresponding protein sequences. Additionally, most variations occurring in exon lengths come at the
beginning or at the end of the coding sequences. This
reflects that within the protein sequence, the centrally
located kinase catalytic domain is probably submitted to
more stringent functional conservation. Evolutionary
analysis of plant terpene synthase genes also revealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

strong conservation within the C-terminal enzyme catalytic site, with most variable domains observed in the Nterminal part of uncertain functions [56]. For their part,
poplar MPK and MKK introns are generally much longer
than those found in the corresponding Arabidopsis genes.
This may reflect reduced pressure for genome compaction
within the larger poplar genome.
Transcript abundance at a given time and in particular
organs is an important prerequisite to subsequent production of the corresponding protein required for proper execution of developmental, metabolic and signaling
processes. The goal of the present study was to obtain a
reasonably comprehensive overview of the whole organ
expression patterns for all members of the poplar MAPK
and MAPKK gene families. These families contain numerous recently duplicated members (paralogs), which raises
the question of the extent to which these copies have
remained functionally redundant. Our data suggest that
while these gene families are highly conserved among
eudicot species, individual family members are nevertheless evolving to display considerable diversity and specialization in the context of poplar biology. For example,
while the paralogous genes PtMPK3-1 and PtMPK3-2
share 93% amino acid sequence similarity, and both
genes are expressed at similar levels in most organs,
PtMPK3-2 transcripts are markedly more abundant than
those of its sister paralog in all four types of bud organ.
This association with developmentally distinct juvenile
organs suggests that PtMPK3-2 may be undergoing neofunctionalization for specific developmental roles, perhaps related to meristem development. For organs other
than buds, the similar transcriptional activity of both
PtMPK3-1 and PtMPK3-2 might simply represent genetic
redundancy, where expression of both genes contributes
to a common signaling pathway. Alternatively, this could
be an example of sub-functionalization [57], where both
genes have become compromised in some of their functions, but when operating together, can still provide the
functionality associated with the ancestral gene. Since the
closest Arabidopsis and tobacco presumed orthologs of
PtMPK3-1 and PtMPK3-2 are AtMPK3 and NtWIPK,
respectively, two stress-responsive MAPKs that respond at
both the transcriptional and post-translational levels to
biotic and abiotic stresses [58,15], it will be interesting to
determine whether one or both poplar genes display similar defence-related functions.
The expression profiles of the paralogous PtMPK6-1 and
6-2 genes differ from what has been reported for the putative orthologous tobacco genes, NtSIPK and Ntf4. While
NtSIPK is expressed in leaves [19], stem and pollen [14],
Ntf4 expression was found to be restricted to seeds, pollen
and anthers [38] and notably, Ntf4 expression was not
detected in female structures (ovaries and pistil) in the

Page 16 of 22

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:223

tobacco hermaphrodite flower. This suggests that specialized functions might have been acquired by one or both
tobacco paralogs. On the other hand, since both paralogs
are expressed in pollen, co-activation by the same MKK,
NtMEK2, as well as the absence of phenotype after the
silencing of Ntf4 [14], point to some level of genetic
redundancy of these MAPKs in this particular organ. For
poplar, despite the predominance in TA for PtMPK6-1
over PtMPK6-2 in all types of buds, in male and female
flowers, there is no evidence of strikingly different patterns of expression. In fact, PtMPK6-1 and PtMPK6-2 display similar TA for most organs, suggestive of overall
redundancy. Further investigation will be needed to evaluate the impact of this discrepancy in expression profiles
between presumed orthologous tobacco and poplar
genes. Interestingly, in a recent publication, NtSIPK and
Ntf4 were both detected in leaf extracts using antibodies
[59]. This contrasts with previously published data [38]
and suggests that at least in leaves, both NtSIPK and Ntf4
display redundant expression profiles.
Expression of group B and C MPK genes has also been
investigated in other species. For example, the phylogenetically closely related Arabidopsis AtMPK1 and AtMPK2,
as well as the Petunia hybrida PhMEK1 gene and the
tobacco Ntf3 gene, showed constitutive expression in various organs (leaves, stem, roots and flowers) [37,43,60].
Interestingly, AtMPK2 is more highly expressed than
AtMPK1 in the analyzed organs [60], a situation also
observed for the poplar predicted ortholog PtMPK1 over
PtMPK2.
Other members of the group B and C MPK genes also display notable differences in their expression profiles. The
poplar group C PtMPK7 is generally much more highly
expressed than its paralog, PtMPK14, in all tested organs
except cell cultures. As well, expression of the group B
PtMPK5-2 is generally higher than that of PtMPK5-1. The
physiological impact of these differences in levels of transcript accumulation among paralogs remains to be
resolved. Such a pattern could however be an indicator of
pseudogenization of one member of a recently duplicated
gene pair, even though signal transduction genes are often
thought to be subject to strong conservation constraints
[61].
Although extensive microarray data are available, no systematic analysis of expression profiles of group D MPK
genes in plants has been reported. However, OsWJUMK1,
the rice putative ortholog of PtMPK20-1/20-2, was found
to be expressed in both vegetative and reproductive
organs [25] as are the poplar putative orthologs, with
PtMPK20-1 expression dominating over PtMPK20-2. The
PtMPK16-1/16-2 pair of paralogs is particularly interesting, since PtMPK16-1 is highly expressed in both male and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

female floral buds, whereas transcripts corresponding to
PtMPK16-2 are barely detectable in these organs. Taken
together with the PtMPK3-1/3-2 patterns, this points to
particularly rapid divergence of functional specificity that
highly similar paralogous genes appear to have evolved
within the context of reproductive organ development in
poplar.
Among the poplar MKKs, we found that PtMKK6 is
strongly expressed in most of the actively proliferating
organs we investigated. Consistent with this, the closest
ortholog of PtMKK6 in tobacco, NtMEK1, encodes a protein that has been shown to be part of a MAPK cascade
involved in the progression of the cell cycle [62]. A similar
role has been identified for the Arabidopsis putative
ortholog, AtMKK6 [13], which suggests that MKK6s could
be highly conserved players in plant cytokinesis and stem
cell development. PtMKK3, a group B MKK, is expressed at
relatively high levels in all vegetative organs in poplar and
is moderately expressed in all types of post-dormancy
buds, as well as in male and female catkins. Likewise, in
Arabidopsis, the orthologous AtMKK3 mRNA is detected in
vegetative organs and also in the hermaphrodite flower
[63].

Conclusion
Overall, our work demonstrates that differential spatiotemporal transcript accumulation patterns exist for most
members of both the MPK and the MKK gene families in
poplar. Although virtually all poplar MPK and MKK genes
are expressed during development, there are striking differences in steady-state TA in specific cases, some of which
could be associated with functional divergence between
recently duplicated paralogs. However, it is also critical to
note that while RTqPCR data provide an estimate of
whole organ gene expression levels, more pronounced
local patterns of differential expression associated with
regions composed of specialized cells will not be detected.
More fine-grained analyses such as in situ hybridization or
promoter:reporter phenotyping will be required to define
the exact pattern of expression of these paralogous gene
pairs, particularly in biological contexts uniquely relevant
to dioecious woody perennials, such as gender specification, male and female flower maturation or wood formation. Finally, while the focus of the present study was on
MPKs and MKKs expression profiling in a developmental
context, plant MAPK cascade components also play central roles in responses to environmental cues. It will therefore be interesting to monitor the expression of these
genes in physiological contexts such as tree defence signaling during biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogen infections, or adaptation to environmental stresses.

Experimental procedures
Plant material and organ sampling
Hybrid poplar cell suspension cultures (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides H11-11) were maintained as
described previously [64]. Four days after transfer to fresh
medium, cells were harvested by vacuum filtration, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C to
await analysis. Hybrid poplar cuttings (P. trichocarpa X P.
deltoides H11-11) were grown in Promix soil under controlled greenhouse conditions (22°C/19°C day/night,
16-h day) for 2 weeks. Thereafter, young trees were placed
in a growth chamber (Conviron, Environmental Growth
Chambers Inc., Chagrin Falls, OH) where conditions were
as follows: 26°C/22°C day/night, 20-h day, 60% RH,
light intensity 100 µmol m-2 s-1. Plants were fertilized once
every 2 weeks alternatively with 10/52/10 (0.5 g/l) plus
15.5/0/0 (Ca 19% 0.5 g/l) or with 20/20/20 (1 g/l) until
PI 16 stage was reached [65]. Apex, young (LPI 1) and
mature (LPI 12) leaves, upper stem (10 cm below the
apex), primary phloem and xylem (10 cm above the
ground) and roots were simultaneously removed from the
trees, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Each
specific organ was harvested from 12 different trees. Three
biological samples were thus created by pooling each
organ sample from four different trees. Ten-year-old fieldgrown trees (P. trichocarpa X P. deltoides) located in SainteCroix-de-Lotbinière (46° 39'55"N 71° 51' 13" W) were
used for sampling various bud types. Post-dormancy buds
were collected on April 8 2005 on male and female trees
by quickly removing them from previously cut branches.
Bud samples were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C. Other cut branches from male and female
trees (P. trichocarpa X P. deltoides) were also brought back
to greenhouses to induce bud flush using the following
conditions; 22°C/19°C day/night, 16-h day. Branches
were placed in plastic buckets half-filled with water and
buds were allowed to develop. Male and female catkins
(P. trichocarpa X P. deltoides) were collected when the completed developmental state was reached; 6 days for males
and 11 days for females. At this stage, male catkins harbored pollenic bags and female catkins harbored fruiting
capsules (Figure 7B,C). Other 10-year-old field-grown tree
(P. trichocarpa X P. deltoides) organs (primary phloem, secondary xylem and xylem cambium-enriched) were kindly
provided by Dr. Janice Cooke, Université Laval.
RNA purification and amplification of 3' non-coding
regions of poplar MPK and MKK genes
The poplar genomic sequences and predicted coding
sequences are available from the DOE Joint Genome Institute database [66]. As described elsewhere [39] gene models for MPKs and MKKs were targeted for phylogenetic
study and a nomenclature based on predicted protein
sequence similarity with Arabidopsis and rice was adopted
to reflect putative orthology. This information was also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/223

used to manually establish chromosome position, exonintron junctions and intron phase for each PtMPK and
PtMKK gene family member. Given the high degree of
gene conservation among MPK and MKK genes, it was
essential to develop gene-specific probes based on the
respective 3' non-coding regions. To do this, a cDNA
library was prepared from mRNA isolated from poplar cell
suspensions. Frozen poplar cell suspensions were ground
into powder in liquid nitrogen and RNA samples were
prepared as previously described [67]. From 1.3 mg total
RNA, mRNA was isolated and subsequently purified using
the Oligotex mRNA Maxi kit (Qiagen, Mississauga ON).
Subsequently, 3'-RACE PCR reactions were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (SMART™ RACE
cDNA Amplification Kit, Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA). Based
on the genomic and the predicted coding sequences of the
poplar MPK and MKK genes, we designed one gene-specific sense primer at the end of the coding sequence of
each gene (Tables 1 and 2). This allowed us to amplify the
corresponding 3' untranslated region (UTR). Amplicons
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and these
products were then ligated into pCR2.1 vector (Original
TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and electrotransformed into E. coli XL1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
Plasmid DNA was subsequently purified using the QIAprep-8 Plasmid Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using the
dideoxy nucleotide termination method with an ABI 373
Stretch XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). 3'UTR sequences were aligned using Multalin [68]
with the genomic and the predicted coding sequences of
the corresponding poplar MPK and MKK genes.
All poplar organ-specific samples were ground into a powder in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated as previously described [67]. To remove DNA traces in total
RNA samples, we performed DNase treatments as recommended in the manufacturer's instructions (DNase 1
Deoxyribonuclease I digests, Invitrogen). cDNAs were
synthesized from 500 ng total RNA (SuperScript™ III FirstStrand Synthesis System, Invitrogen).
Real-Time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) analysis
In order to confirm the efficiencies of the RTqPCR primer
sets, genomic DNA from Populus trichocarpa (Nisqually-1),
Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides (H11-11) and Populus deltoides (ST-70) was extracted using 150 mg of leaf tissue (LPI 3). Briefly, plant material from each genetic
background was ground into powder in liquid nitrogen.
DNA extractions were then conducted using DNeasy system (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five nanograms of DNA were used in each RTqPCR
reaction that was carried out using the Opticon2 DNA
Engine (MJResearch, Waltham, MA). After an initial 15
min activation step at 95°C, 45 cycles (94°C, 15 s; 57°C,
1 min; 72°C, 30 s) were performed and a single fluores-

cence reading was taken after each cycle immediately following the elongation period at 72°C. A melting curve
was performed at the end of the cycling procedure to
ensure single product amplification. Cycle threshold (Ct)
values were determined by the Opticon Monitor 2 software at a manually set fluorescence threshold of 0.016.
Agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2%) was also performed to
compare amplicons obtained from the various genetic
backgrounds.

To quantify organ-specific TA for the corresponding poplar MPK and MKK genes, standard curves were produced
based on serial dilution of each of the pCR2.1 plasmids
containing the cloned 3'UTR of each gene, and used to
determine the number of transcript molecules as
described in [69]. Twelve nanogram aliquots of cDNA
were used in each RTqPCR reaction. Amplifications were

nucleotide RTqPCR primers. Specific 5'- and 3'-oligonucleotides were designed to target the previously sequenced
3' UTR regions of each poplar MPK and MKK gene (Tables
1 and 2), and RTqPCR reactions were carried out as
described above, except that the manually set fluorescence
threshold was 0.03.
In order to obtain consistent and reproducible RTqPCR
data, accurate measurement of RNA concentrations and
the preparation of samples that are free from any inhibitors of the reverse transcription and PCR processes are critical steps. Moreover, since we have analyzed many
different organs in parallel, it was necessary to normalize
the data by employing internal standard candidate genes
that show consistent expression over a wide array of tissues or organ samples. To validate proper dosage of
cDNA, cdc2 RTqPCR primers were included in the analysis
as a control gene. Primer sequences were as follows: forward primer sequence: 5'ATTCCCCAAGTGGCCTTCTAAG
3';
reverse
primer
sequence:
5'
TATTCATGCTCCAAAGCACTCC 3'). Act2 was also
employed as a control housekeeping gene and RTqPCR
primer sequences were as follows: forward primer
sequence: 5' TTCTACAAGTGCTTTGATGGTGAGTTC 3';
reverse primer sequence: 5' CTATTCGATACATAGAAGATCAGAATGTTC 3').
To simplify graphical presentation, standard deviations
are not included in Figures 8 to 10. However, all the corresponding data together with respective standard deviation are available in the additional files 2 and 3. Each
value of transcript accumulation for a specific PtMPK or
PtMKK gene represents the average of six independent
PCR reactions; two technical repetitions of three biological samples. Overall, regardless of organs or phylogenetic
classification, technical variation within one sample was,
on average, < 0.25 Ct. This means that our quantification
of transcript accumulation was highly reproducible
within one sample and that technical error has little
impact on the values reported here. The variation from
one biological sample to another within a specific organ
was also consistently < 1.0 Ct. Samples that showed
greater variation than 1.0 Ct were reamplified, with usually smaller disparity. The highest variations on transcripts
numbers were found in leaf samples (LPI 1 and 12) as
well as in xylem and secondary phloem, for both MPK
and MKK gene families. The underlying reason for this
finding remains unclear, but it could be associated with
higher concentrations of potent inhibitors of the reverse
transcription and/or PCR processes.
