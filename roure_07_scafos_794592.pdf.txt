Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses based on datasets rich in both genes and species
(phylogenomics) are becoming a standard approach to resolve evolutionary questions. However,
several difficulties are associated with the assembly of large datasets, such as multiple copies of a
gene per species (paralogous or xenologous genes), lack of some genes for a given species, or
partial sequences. The use of undetected paralogous or xenologous genes in phylogenetic inference
can lead to inaccurate results, and the use of partial sequences to a lack of resolution. A tool that
selects sequences, species, and genes, while dealing with these issues, is needed in a phylogenomics
context.
Results: Here, we present SCaFoS, a tool that quickly assembles phylogenomic datasets containing
maximal phylogenetic information while adjusting the amount of missing data in the selection of
species, sequences and genes. Starting from individual sequence alignments, and using monophyletic
groups defined by the user, SCaFoS creates chimeras with partial sequences, or selects, among
multiple sequences, the orthologous and/or slowest evolving sequences. Once sequences
representing each predefined monophyletic group have been selected, SCaFos retains genes
according to the user's allowed level of missing data and generates files for super-matrix and supertree analyses in several formats compatible with standard phylogenetic inference software. Because
no clear-cut criteria exist for the sequence selection, a semi-automatic mode is available to
accommodate user's expertise.
Conclusion: SCaFos is able to deal with datasets of hundreds of species and genes, both at the
amino acid or nucleotide level. It has a graphical interface and can be integrated in an automatic
workflow. Moreover, SCaFoS is the first tool that integrates user's knowledge to select
orthologous sequences, creates chimerical sequences to reduce missing data and selects genes
according to their level of missing data. Finally, applying SCaFoS to different datasets, we show that
the judicious selection of genes, species and sequences reduces tree reconstruction artefacts,
especially if the dataset includes fast evolving species.

Background
Phylogenomics, i.e. phylogenetic inference based on large
amounts of sequence data, is an alternative approach to
single gene phylogenies, which are insufficient to resolve
many phylogenetic questions [1]. The most common phylogenomic strategies using primary sequences are the concatenation of sequences before tree reconstruction (supermatrix approach) and the combination of single gene
phylogenies (super-tree approach). Several difficulties are
associated with handling large amounts of data: (i) the
uneven distribution of species across genes (genes that
have been lost or that are not yet sequenced); (ii) the existence of partial sequences, especially in EST (Express
Sequence Tag) and WGS (Whole Genome Shotgun)based projects; and (iii) the presence of multiple copies
per gene for the same species (paralogs or xenologs). The
two first points imply the presence of missing data in the
final dataset, whereas the third imply the presence of
sequences that do not reflect the species tree and could
therefore mislead phylogenetic inference.
Undoubtedly, one of the most problematic aspects when
assembling phylogenomic datasets for reconstructing species trees is the presence of paralogous or xenologous
genes. As opposed to orthologous genes, which arose by
speciation and reflect the organismal phylogeny, paralogs
arose by gene duplications, and xenologs, by lateral gene
transfer from another species [2]. Both cases generally
imply the presence of multiple copies of a given gene per
species, some of which do not reflect the organismal phylogeny. Orthology assignment is a difficult task [3]. Similarity of primary sequence alone is not always sufficient to
discriminate correct orthologs [4]. A rigorous, albeit
extreme, solution would be to retain only genes having
one and only one copy in all the species under study (an
approach particularly suited when complete genomes are
available). However, if an objective is to minimise the
amount of missing data, this implies retaining a tiny fraction of the genome (e.g., 14 genes from 10 complete
eukaryotic genomes in the study of Philip et al. [5]), rejecting a large number of genes whose paralogy history may
be inferred and/or does not disturb the inference of the
species phylogeny. In particular, this approach would uselessly reject in-paralogs (i.e. genes issued from a recent
duplication within a single species), which do not disturb
the inference of species phylogeny. In contrast, great care
should be taken to detect out-paralogs (i.e. genes for
which the duplication event arose before speciation)
whose presence may induce erroneous phylogenies.
Unfortunately, orthology determination is difficult when
only one sequence per species exists. In brief, a gene
should only be discarded when its duplication history
cannot be reliably inferred meaning that gene and
sequence selection should integrate information about

duplication histories in order to optimally infer organismal phylogeny from genomic data.
Missing data are also often considered to be a significant
obstacle in phylogenetic reconstruction (see Wiens 1998
[6] and references therein), and researchers generally prefer to avoid incomplete super-matrices [7,8]. Nevertheless, this implies that a compromise has to be made
between using a large number of species for a few
sequenced genes or a large number of genes for a few completely sequenced species. The first strategy often fails to
provide statistically supported trees due to the limited
sequence information contained in single or few genes,
whereas the second can lead to highly supported, albeit
erroneous trees, due to systematic biases (e.g. compositional or rate heterogeneity among lineages) [1,9]. Influence of systematic bias is limited with the first strategy
because the impact of bias will be reduced as multiple
substitutions (hence convergence) are detected more easily. Therefore, using a large number of both genes and species is necessary to infer accurate and well-resolved
phylogenies, even if this implies the presence of missing
data. To achieve this purpose, algorithms have been developed to identify optimal incomplete phylogenetic datasets [10,11] allowing the assembly of huge super-matrices
(e.g. 70 taxa and 1131 genes [12]) automatically from a
given database. However, this automation favours the
selection of species for which the complete genome is
sequenced, without consideration of their phylogenetic
interest. For instance, it may lead to the inclusion of
redundant taxa (e.g. mouse and rat when studying the
eukaryotic phylogeny) or of rogue taxa (e.g. microsporidia), which would needlessly increase computational time and phylogenetic inaccuracy, respectively.
Nevertheless, recent studies using simulations, as well as
real data, have shown that the presence of missing data
does not drastically reduce phylogenetic accuracy as long
as a sufficient number of characters is available for each
species [12-14]. That is the reason why reducing the
amount of missing data must not be an end in itself. In
particular, it has been shown that including partial
sequences to break a long branch (i.e. adding species that
are sister-group of a fast evolving species) reduce one of
most common tree reconstruction artefacts, known as
long branch attraction (LBA) [15]. In the same goal, an
extreme approach is to exclude the fastest evolving genes
from a fast evolving taxon (up to 90% of missing data for
a given species) [16]. Even if these approaches imply
much more incomplete matrices, the ultimate aim of
selecting sequences, genes and species is to increase the
amount of phylogenetic signal to the detriment of noisy
signal; minimizing the level of missing data is one of the
ways to pursue this aim. In fact, no rules currently exist to
find the optimal number of taxa and level of missing data

and a tool is therefore required to easily explore this question.
In summary, accurate and statistically supported phylogenetic inferences rely on the construction of large datasets
with minimal amount of missing data and free of nonorthologous sequences, which makes species, gene and
sequence sampling a crucial issue. In order to facilitate the
construction of such phylogenomic datasets, we have
developed SCaFoS, a tool that semi-automatically or automatically selects species, genes and sequences taking into
account their level of missing data. Moreover, the software
presents two novel functions: (i) it allows the combination of closely related species into a single pseudo-species
to minimize missing data while retaining poorly represented taxa, and (ii) uses the relative evolutionary distance of the sequences and/or the user's expertise to
judiciously select orthologous and/or slowest evolving
sequences to avoid inaccurate phylogenetic reconstructions. These new functions will be peculiarly useful in a
data mining context as more and more genomes will be
sequenced.

Implementation
SCaFoS runs in an easy-to-use graphical mode, as well as
in a command-line mode that can be implemented in a
workflow. It can deal with either amino acid or nucleotide
sequences. Common formats for input and output alignment files are handled: Fasta, Phylip [17], Must [18] or
Nexus [19]. SCaFoS is developed in Perl and the graphical
interface is designed with Perl-Tk.
Sequence selection
The concept of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) is an
important aspect of SCaFoS. An OTU is a monophyletic
group of species (possibly one) that will result, in the final
dataset, into a single taxon labelled with the OTU name.
Using a list of OTUs specified by the user, for each gene,
SCaFoS will select the sequence that best represents a
given OTU, ideally, the longest and slowest evolving
orthologous sequence; evolutionary distance, as an
approximation of the evolutionary rate, is estimated for
each sequence. The sequence selection process for a single
alignment file is summarized on a flowchart (Fig. 1) and
described below. This crucial process is based on various
thresholds defined in percentage of residues from the total
number of positions (for the two first) or in percentage of
the average evolutionary distance (for the last):

- the minimum length of a single sequence is used to
remove too short sequences because stochastic errors
might be induced by partial sequences, especially in the
super-tree approach (default = 10%);

- the sequence completeness is defined to consider as complete a sequence for which few residues are missing
(default = 10%), called quasi-complete sequences;
- the divergence threshold is the maximum percentage of
pairwise phylogenetic distance within the OTU compared
to the average pairwise distances with the other sequences
(default = 25%).
Schematically, the steps for sequence selection occur as
follows according to the different thresholds:
- if only one sequence for a given OTU is present in the
file, the sequence is systematically selected except if it is
too short;
- if only one quasi-complete sequence (according to the
sequence completeness criterion) exists for the OTU, the
sequence is also systematically selected, even if this
sequence has a higher evolutionary rate than the noncomplete sequences in the OTU;
- if none of the sequences are quasi-complete and the chimera option has been chosen by the user, a chimerical
sequence will be constructed and selected as described in
'Construction of chimerical sequences' paragraph, except
if the created chimera is too short;
- if at least two quasi-complete sequences are present, only
these quasi-complete sequences are sent to the selection
criteria step described in 'Selection according to evolutionary distances' paragraph;
- otherwise, all incomplete sequences are sent to the selection criteria step.
Two mutually exclusive selection criteria, sequence size or
evolutionary distances, constitute the starting point of the
selection criteria step. The more straightforward criterion
is the size of the sequences, in which case the longest
sequence will be selected. Although this criterion is best to
minimize the quantity of missing data, selection according to evolutionary distances allows a more judicious
choice of sequences (see below). Those two kinds of
sequence selection are provided in an automatic mode,
which makes SCaFoS a stand-alone tool.
Selection according to evolutionary distances
For each gene alignment, evolutionary distances between
each pair of sequences are calculated with TREE-PUZZLE
[20]. While the choice of the model of substitution is left
to TREE-PUZZLE, the user can enforce a Gamma distribution to handle rate heterogeneity across sites. In practice,
we have observed that the assumption of uniform rates
provides sufficiently accurate estimates, while signifi-

Flowchart of sequences selection and construction of chimera for an OTU in a given gene
Flowchart of sequences selection and construction of chimera for an OTU in a given gene. For each OTU of each
gene, SCaFoS selects the sequence that best represents the OTU. See text for a detailed description of the process. Three
thresholds (empty blue rhombus) with default or user specific values are important: (i) the maximal percentage of characters
present with respect to the longest sequence to keep a sequence, (ii) the minimal percentage of characters present with
respect to the longest sequence to consider a sequence as complete and (iii) the maximum in-OTU/out-OTU distances ratio
(see text) to keep an OTU. The user should select if he/she desires to create or not chimerical sequences and chose among
the different sequence selection criteria (filled blue rhombus). If the selection criterion is the sequence size, no other options
should be checked. If the selection criterion is the evolutionary rate of the sequences, the user must chose between a fully
automatic or a semi-automatic choice of sequences and specify if he/she desires to use a previously defined selection.

cantly reducing computational time. Evolutionary distances are used in two goals: (i) verifying that the OTU
does not include xenologous or paralogous sequences,
and mainly (ii) selecting the least divergent sequence.
Then, for each OTU, the ratio between the in-OTU distances (maximum pairwise phylogenetic distance within

each OTU) and the out-OTU distances (the average pairwise distances between each OTU sequence and each nonOTU sequence) is calculated. If the in-OTU/out-OTU distances ratio is bigger than the divergence threshold, all
sequences from this OTU will be discarded and, for this
gene, the OTU will be represented by question marks in

the super-matrix. Otherwise, the sequence that displays
the lowest average distance to the other sequences will
represent the OTU. This approach is rather drastic, but it
is efficient to avoid out-paralogs in the resulting file. Nevertheless, as detailed below, a more accurate selection
might be obtained with the semi-automatic mode. Evidence of gene duplication somewhere in the tree is a reason to worry about the orthology of the other sequences;
then a more conservative option is also available which
eliminates the complete gene when at least one OTU
needs to be removed.
Finally if the OTU does not present risk of xeno- or paralogy, the less divergent sequence is selected from the quasicomplete sequences of the OTU in order to decrease the
noisy signal contained in the terminal branches file (without decreasing the phylogenetic signal contained in the
inner branch). For this last step, the definition of the
sequence completeness is an important option because it
is useful to be able to select an almost complete slow
divergent sequence than a complete but highly divergent
one.
Selection according to user's expertise
In the semi-automatic mode, after computation of the
ratio in-OTU/out-OTU distances as previously described,
SCaFoS proposes the user to select of the sequence that
displays the lowest average distance. A visual flag indicates
if the ratio in-OTU/out-OTU distances overcomes the user
defined divergence threshold. In this manner, the user can
choose between selecting the suggested sequence, or
another complete sequence that he/she considers of better
orthology, or discarding the OTU from this gene. The user
can use any external information to validate his/her
choice, in particular a phylogenetic tree or the position of
the genes on the chromosome (synteny). The use of
human expertise is advised because there are no known
reliable methods for automatically identifying orthologs.
As this user intervention is time consuming, SCaFoS saves
the information on selected sequences. In subsequent
dataset constructions, this information can be reused
allowing for a fast assembling of numerous combinations

of genes and taxa. The sequence selected in the first run for
each OTU becomes the default sequence for a given OTU.
As long as the list of complete sequences included in the
OTU remains unchanged (i.e. no sequence are added or
removed), SCaFoS automatically keeps the default
sequence.
Construction of chimerical sequences
When an OTU lacks a complete sequence, creating a chimera within a gene may be a judicious choice to decrease
the amount of missing data and the inclusion of species
with few sequenced genes. A chimera is created from several partial sequences belonging to a particular monophyletic group. Sequences are incorporated into the
chimerical sequence in descending order of sequence
length as shown on Figure 2. Only the length of the
sequences determines the order of incorporation of fragments in the chimera; if some partial sequences overlap,
the fragment kept is the first incorporated.

Finally, SCaFoS is able to modulate between the creation
of chimera from partial sequences and the selection of
complete sequences, by considering sequences with few
missing characters as full-length sequences.
Global level of missing data
Once the sequences are selected for each gene, the user
may want to select genes according to their global level of
missing data. For this purpose, SCaFoS creates several
directories that contain the processed files including the
selected species and sequences. These files are sorted
according to their level of missing species or characters
and an additional file, containing the super-matrix is also
produced for each level. Since there are no established
rules on the maximum amount of missing data in a supermatrix, the user is free to select the threshold of missing
data (either globally or for the species of interest) that he/
she considers appropriate. For this purpose, the user is
guided by the statistical information about the composition in genes, species and missing positions, the nature of
phylogenetic question being also of major importance.

Results and Discussion
Typical use of SCaFoS
Starting from files of aligned sequences, SCaFoS proceeds
in three major steps (see Fig. 3 for an overview, and
[1,9,16,21-23] for examples). First, it provides a file in
which the species are sorted according to their frequency,
i.e. average representation across genes, and taxonomic
affiliation (Fig. 3, step 1: SPECIES PRESENCE). This file
can then be used by the user as a guide to select organisms
(species or strains) and define OTUs (Fig. 3, step 2) that
would be used to construct chimerical sequences.

Second, using the OTUs defined by the user, SCaFoS creates a copy of each file that will contain only the
sequences of the species of interest. It should be noted
that no chimerical sequences will be created at this step,
and all sequences from a given OTU will be included in
each file (Fig. 3, step 3: FILE SELECTION). With a reduced
number of sequences, one can more accurately remove
ambiguously aligned positions in each file, and construct
preliminary phylogenetic trees of each gene to control for
laterally transferred or paralogous genes (Fig. 3, step 4).
Third, for each OTU and each gene, SCaFoS selects one
sequence or constructs a chimerical sequence following
the steps shown on Figure 1, and assembles final datasets
(Fig. 3, step 5: ASSEMBLING DATASETS). In the semiautomatic mode, the user incorporates information from
the trees constructed for single-genes (step 4) to select
sequences. Moreover, if phylogenetic trees are available in
postscript format (produced by MUST [18]), the selection
is visually reported onto the trees.
Finally, all the relevant information about sequence selection is provided in a text file, allowing the analysis to be
reproduced. Once the sequences are selected for each
gene, files for super-matrix and super-tree analyses are
generated in formats usable by MrBayes [24], PAUP [25],
PHYLIP [17], or TREE-PUZZLE [20]. Files summarizing
the presence of OTUs for each gene and the amount of
missing data in various datasets help the user to select the
best set of genes for subsequent inferences.
Evaluation of SCaFoS performance
Impact of missing data
To evaluate the effect of our sequence selection approach
on the level of missing data, we performed several analyses with different criteria: (i) selection of the longest
sequence with and without the creation of chimeras, and
(ii) without creation of chimeras, selection of the longest
versus the slowest evolving sequence as long as the inOTU distance is below a given threshold of the in-OTU/
out-OTU distance ratio (between 0 and 60 percent, see
above). We used the Metazoa dataset of 161 proteins from
49 animal and fungal species from Philippe et al. [22].

Similar results were obtained with the dataset of 169
nuclear aligned sequence files from 34 eukaryotes used by
Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [23], even if the differences are
less important (data not shown). The statistics files produced by SCaFoS allow an easy monitoring of the missing
data level according to these criteria (Fig. 4).
First, the use of chimerical sequences slightly reduces the
level of missing data. For instance, for a global level of
30% of missing data, chimeras allow the incorporation of
seven additional genes (115 versus 108). This is not surprising because the Metazoa dataset is mainly constructed
from EST sequences, implying that data will frequently be
missing for the same, lowly expressed genes. In practice,
chimeras are especially interesting for OTUs having a key
phylogenetic position (i.e. that break long branches or
that are the only representative from a taxonomic group of
interest).
Second, the conservative elimination of sequences when
several copies are present for a given OTU, as performed
in the automatic mode of SCaFoS, has much more drastic
consequence. When the ratio in-OTU/out-OTU distances
is 60%, 25%, or 1%, the global percent of missing data in
the final dataset is 16, 24 and 64, respectively. Nevertheless, a similar number of genes (52, 47 and 56, respectively) is incorporated in the datasets. Note that this severe
effect is not only due to paralogy, but is an incidental consequence of chimera construction through the OTU concept. In fact, when an OTU contains several species, the
orthologous copies from these species are artificially considered in the exact same way as paralogs from the same
organisms. Then, the more divergent species within the
OTU are, the more likely SCaFoS will remove the OTU
because at least one sequence will have a higher evolutionary distance than permitted by the divergence threshold. In such case, the automatic approach of SCaFoS is too
conservative. We strongly recommend the use of the semiautomatic mode in which sequences are discarded only
when paralogy problems are recognized by the user. Nevertheless, the automatic mode yields reasonable results
when each OTU is represented by a single species (data
not shown).
Sequence selection and the reduction of tree reconstruction artefacts
An important function of SCaFoS is to automatically
determine, for each OTU, the best sequence for representing a given gene according to user-defined criteria. When
several complete sequences are present for an OTU,
SCaFoS tries to select the one that possesses the maximum
amount of phylogenetic signal. To achieve this, the
sequence that has the lowest evolutionary distance to all
other sequences is selected to represent the OTU. As we
will show, this approach helps to reduce the long branch
attraction (LBA) artefact [26].

Main steps to use SCaFoS
Main steps to use SCaFoS. Steps 1, 3 and 5 are done by SCaFoS: 1. SPECIES PRESENCE: listing of all species present in the
files of aligned sequences followed by their frequency of presence and, if desired, classified into taxonomic groups (specified by
TaxGp in the figure). 2. Definition by the user of the species to be selected and their respective OTUs 3. FILE SELECTION:
creation of files containing only the selected species 4. Discarding ambiguously aligned positions (displayed in dark colour) with
a tool such as GBlocks [33]; making phylogenetic trees (using PHYML [34] or PAUP [25] for example) 5. DATASETS ASSEMBLING: selection of sequences and chimera construction according to an OTU file and default sequence files: creation of single
gene files including chimeras and selected sequences and creation of concatenated files for super-tree and super-matrix
approaches respectively. In the last step, three typical cases are represented: (i) construction of a chimera (OTU5) in the
orange file, (ii) selection of the less divergent sequence within an OTU (Sp6 in OTU5) and elimination of a short sequence
(Sp31) in the red file and (iii) elimination of potential paralogous sequences by the user (Sp31 and Sp71) in the purple file. Eliminated sequences are drawn in grey. The corresponding default sequences files are displayed under their respective sequence
files.

Evolution of missing data according to the threshold
Evolution of missing data according to the threshold. For seven threshold values defining the maximal in-OTU/outOTU distances ratio, the number of selected genes is plotted against the percentage of missing sites in the concatenated file.
Subsets are extracted from the Metazoa dataset without making of chimera. The evolution of missing data is also displayed
when the selection is only made according to the size criterion (black and grey curves respectively with and without making of
chimera); these last selections represent the minimal amount of missing data for the dataset.

Based on the Metazoa dataset, two super-matrices were
automatically constructed using two different criteria of
selection within an OTU, all the other options being left
to defaults: (i) selection of the longest sequence (LC)
among all sequences respecting the completeness criteria,
and (ii) selection of the quasi-complete sequence with the
smallest estimated evolutionary distance (SC) (with
respect of completeness, the longest sequence is selected
only when several sequences are equally least divergent).
In both cases, chimeras were created when no quasi-complete sequences were available. Twelve OTUs covering the
diversity of opisthokonts (animals + fungi) were considered. We analysed the concatenations of 140 proteins,
which is similar to the number used in the original paper
(146), where SCaFoS had been used in a semi-automatic
mode [22]. The two datasets contained 32,648 unambiguously aligned amino acids with about 23% of missing
data (corresponding to OTUs that lack sequence for some
genes, this lacks being similar in the two datasets). Phylogenies were inferred by Maximum Likelihood with
TreeFinder [27], using the JTT matrix of amino acid substitution [28] with a gamma distribution to correct rate
across sites variation (JTT+Γ) model. With the SC concatenation, arthropods are sister-group of Lophotrochozoa

(molluscs + annelids), recovering the expected monophyly of protostomes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the phylogeny
based on the LC concatenation recovers an erroneous
bilaterian phylogeny, with deuterostomes grouped with
Lophotrochozoa to the exclusion of arthropods (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, the erroneous tree receives a higher support
than the correct one (84% versus 55% bootstrap support).
The explanation is simply that, in the LC super-matrix,
arthropods are often represented by Drosophila melanogaster (95% versus 11%, respectively for LC and SC, see
table 1), for which the complete genome sequence is
available, but which evolves rather fast. As a result, arthropods are strongly, yet artefactually, attracted by the long
branch of the outgroup. However, in the SC dataset,
arthropods are represented by a mix of sequences of Drosophila and other slower evolving species when the latter
have quasi-complete sequences, decreasing the global relative evolutionary distance of the OTU in the dataset. This
example also illustrates the importance of the completeness option.
However, the branch length of arthropods does not
appear significantly longer on Figure 5B than on Figure
5A. We therefore directly compared the evolutionary dis-

tances between all pairs of species for the SC and LC concatenations using the same model (JTT+Γ). As expected,
the LC distances are always larger than the SC distances
(Fig. 6). This is particularly true for arthropods (orange
squares), in agreement with our hypothesis of an LBA
artefact affecting the result on Figure 5B. This didactical
example illustrates that reducing the global amount of
missing data (i.e. selecting the longest sequences) as a
unique selection criterion can be misleading. The various
criteria proposed by SCaFoS (in particular, the lowest evolutionary distance) allowed increasing the phylogenetic
signal in the super-matrix, efficiently reducing the negative effect of LBA (Fig. 5).

For each sequence, the compositional deviation is computed as the sum of the deviation per residue between the
current sequence and the whole sequence file. However,
the latter information is not taken into account by SCaFoS
to perform its selection. In complement, the use of a phylogenetic tree for each gene, inferred during step 4 of the
proposed methodology (Fig. 3), is recommended for the
selection of orthologs. In fact, the relative evolutionary
distance of the sequences is not always a sufficient criterion, as exemplified on Figure 7, where the two slowest
sequences (Bα and Aβ) are paralogous sequences for species A and B. For all these reasons, we highly recommend
to use SCaFoS in the semi-automatic mode.

Importance of the investigator expertise
Although the automatic approach of SCaFoS is rather
crude, the resulting datasets can be used for preliminary
analyses (e.g. Fig. 5A). Yet, to build a final dataset, the
semi-automatic approach should be preferred. In this
mode, when the choice among multiple sequences for an
OTU is ambiguous, the software guides the user by providing the average evolutionary distances (to reduce LBA)
as well as missing data information. Moreover, to reduce
compositional bias, another source of tree reconstruction
artefact [29], the global deviation of amino acid or nucleotide composition is displayed as a complementary guide.

Since there is no clearly defined limit for an acceptable
level of global missing data, the investigator is free to
choose his/her favourite compromise between the
number of genes, the frequency of missing data and the
severity of the threshold used to extract the orthologs. To
do that, the user is guided by a table containing the
number of genes, of positions and of missing data for each
subdirectory in which the resulting files with a given
amount of missing data have been copied.

Phylogenetic trees obtained for three subsets extracted from the Metazoa dataset
Phylogenetic trees obtained for three subsets extracted from the Metazoa dataset. Maximum Likelihood inferences were performed with the JTT+Γ (4 categories) model by TreeFinder [27] on two datasets based on the Philippe et al.
[22] Metazoa dataset and constructed as follows. The species were grouped according to 12 OTUs. Sequences with at least
90% of the total number of positions were considered as complete and sequences or chimera shorter than 10% of the total
number of positions were removed. The two datasets differ on the main criteria of selection, A: longest sequence (LC) and B:
smaller evolutionary distances (SC). Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support values obtained by analysing 100
bootstrap replicates under the same conditions.

Perspectives
Some improvements could be considered. The most evident one is to take into account compositional biases
when selecting sequences, especially when several
sequences within an OTU have similar relative evolutionary distances. However, combining this criterion with the
evolutionary distance is not straightforward because the
compositional bias is not always correlated with the evo-

lutionary distance. As we have shown, the sequence
length is not the best criterion to choose a sequence and
estimating the evolutionary distances of partial sequences
to create intra-gene chimeras would improve the results.
Yet, the evolutionary distance of each fragment should be
corrected for the difference in the average evolutionary
rate of this protein part because a conserved domain of a
fast evolving species may have a slower evolutionary rate

ious evolutionary rates), (ii) allowing the comparison of
complete and chimerical sequences to select the slow
evolving one. An idea to create chimera might be to infer
ancestral state for each site; unfortunately, this rule is difficult to apply because it needs a within OTU phylogenetic
tree and at least 4 residues per site, two conditions rarely
met when few overlapped sequences like those obtained
by EST methods are considered. Finally, incorporating
refined tools to facilitate species selection (i.e. the definition of the OTUs), such as the biclique and quasi-biclique
algorithms [10,11] would be also useful.

into account the evolutionary distance for chimera making has also two advantages (i) avoiding risk of artificial

Phylogenetic studies based on a huge sampling of both
genes and species remain rare despite the great quantity of
genomic data currently available. We have conceived a
software open to a large usage in a phylogenomic context.
SCaFoS is a helpful tool for rapidly constructing large
datasets of aligned sequences that can be easily used with
different phylogenetic inference approaches. Simplifying
the construction of these datasets should permit a better
phylogenetic use of genomic data by various samplings of
sequences, species and genes. This latter point is particularly important because of the increasing number of contradictory papers that are based on different samples, as
illustrated by the question of Ecdysozoa monophyly
[5,22,30-32]. Finally, we have shown that SCaFoS selection of the slowest evolving representative sequence of a
monophyletic group is an efficient approach to reduce the
impact of tree reconstruction artefacts, suggesting that
increasing the amount of phylogenetic signal during the
construction of phylogenomic datasets should be a priority for future research.
