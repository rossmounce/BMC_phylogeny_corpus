Abstract
Background: The pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator protein (PdhR) of Escherichia coli acts as a transcriptional
regulator in a pyruvate dependent manner to control central metabolic fluxes. However, the complete PdhR
regulon has not yet been uncovered. To achieve an extended understanding of its gene regulatory network, we
combined large-scale network inference and experimental verification of results obtained by a systems biology
approach.
Results: 22 new genes contained in two operons controlled by PdhR (previously only 20 regulatory targets in
eight operons were known) were identified by analysing a large-scale dataset of E. coli from the Many Microbes
Microarray Database and novel expression data from a pdhR knockout strain, as well as a PdhR overproducing
strain. We identified a regulation of the glycolate utilization operon glcDEFGBA using chromatin
immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays. We show that this regulation could be part of a cross-induction between
genes necessary for acetate and pyruvate utilisation controlled through PdhR. Moreover, a link of PdhR regulation
to the replication machinery of the cell via control of the transcription of the dcw-cluster was verified in
experiments. This augments our knowledge of the functions of the PdhR-regulon and demonstrates its central
importance for further cellular processes in E. coli.
Conclusions: We extended the PdhR regulon by 22 new genes contained in two operons and validated the
regulation of the glcDEFGBA operon for glycolate utilisation and the dcw-cluster for cell division proteins
experimentally. Our results provide, for the first time, a plausible regulatory link between the nutritional status of
the cell and cell replication mediated by PdhR.

Background
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli is
encoded by the operon pdhR-aceE-aceF-lpdA. The first
gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulator (PdhR), which functions as a transcriptional regulator
in a self-regulatory manner for this operon [1]. The multienzyme complex of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
consists of 24 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
(aceE), 24 subunits of the dehydrolipoate acetyltransferase
(aceF), and 12 subunits of the dehydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (lpdA). This complex catalyses the formation of

acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, which subsequently enters the
TCA cycle [2]. Thereby the complex regulates the metabolic flux at the pyruvate node, which connects glycolysis
and the TCA cycle.
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulator (PdhR)
belongs to the Gnt family of transcription factors [3] and
is regulated by a pyruvate-sensing mechanism [1]. While
PdhR represses the transcription of its target genes, the
pyruvate-bound state of the regulator is not able to bind
DNA. PdhR controls not only the transcription of the
multi-enzyme complex of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, but also targets the ndh and cyoABCDE operons
(genes encoding proteins for electron transport), which
leads to the hypothesis that PdhR functions as a master
regulator of genes involved in energy production and the

following terminal electron transport from NADH to
oxygen [4]. Furthermore, a connection between central
metabolism and iron transport has been described by the
regulation of the fecABCDE operon (genes for ferric citrate
transporter) by PdhR [5]. The tomB-hha operon (antitoxin
(TomB)-toxin (Hha)-module) [4] and the genes hemL
(glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase) [4], yfiD
(pyruvate formate-lyase subunit) [6], and lipA (lipoate
synthase) [7] are also directly controlled by PdhR.
Since PdhR plays an important role in the control of
metabolic flux, we aimed to identify further targets of this
regulator. For this purpose we set out to identify potential
targets of regulation by PdhR in a large-scale microarray
dataset of E. coli from the Many Microbes Microarray
Database [8]. Moreover, we constructed a pdhR-knockout
and a PdhR-overproducing strain and studied their transcriptome on a variety of growth media. Following this
analysis, we identified four potential binding sites of PdhR.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with quantitative PCR and gel shift assays we discovered that the glcDEFGBA operon (genes for glycolate
utilisation, malate synthase) as well as the mraZW-ftsLImurEF-mraY-murD-ftsW-murGC-ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC transcription unit (genes for proteins involved in cell division)
are controlled by PdhR. Our results thus further underline
the central importance of PdhR for the control of metabolism and its involvement in cell division by providing a
link to the nutritional status of the cell. In consequence,
we further support the notion that PdhR is an important
component of the transcriptional regulatory network of E.
coli [9].

Results
The outline of our study is presented in Figure 1.
Construction of a pdhR deletion mutant and investigation
of the phenotype on different media

The deletion mutant LJ110ΔpdhR was constructed as
described in Methods. After confirming the genotype by
PCR, the strains LJ110 and LJ110ΔpdhR as well as
LJ110/pTM30 and LJ110/pTM30PdhRhis were investigated regarding their phenotypical growth behaviour.
For this purpose strains were grown overnight and
inoculated into various fresh media. Growth behaviour
was observed by measuring the change in optical density. The growth rates μ [h-1] are given in Table 1.
When grown in complex LB medium, neither the
pdhR deletion mutant nor the PdhRhis overexpression
strain differed in their growth behaviour from the parental strains. In contrast, when grown in minimal media
supplemented with glucose, glycerol, or acetate as carbon source, a severe growth defect of the pdhR deletion
mutant was observed. This phenotype emerged regardless of the carbohydrate source. Interestingly, this

growth defect did not occur when cells were grown in
minimal medium supplemented with pyruvate. Since the
transcription factor PdhR is inactivated by pyruvate, the
deletion is of no consequence under these conditions.
Overproduction of the transcription regulator in minimal medium did not affect growth behaviour, as was
observed in rich medium.
To get a more detailed insight into the effect of the
chromosomal pdhR deletion and PdhR overproduction
on the transcriptome, we analysed the gene-expression
profiles of these strains under various growth conditions
using microarrays.
Elucidating further targets of PdhR in a systems biology
approach

We used three different approaches to infer further targets of PdhR. Firstly, we identified putative targets of
regulation by PdhR through the analysis of a large-scale
gene-expression data set from the Many Microbes
Microarray Database (M3D, [8]).
Secondly, we analysed microarray data from a PdhR
overproducing and a pdhR knockout strain. Thirdly, we
inferred putative phylogenetically conserved binding
sites of PdhR on a genome scale using a previously
described approach [7].
In the first approach, we determined an association
score (z-score) indicating the significance of a regulation
of each gene in the genome of E. coli by PdhR. These
scores were determined from 907 gene-expression experiments, stored in M 3D , using the context-likelihood of
relatedness algorithm [5]. In the second approach, we
obtained a regulatory score that corresponds to the
strength of the effect of a knockout as well as an overproduction of PdhR on the expression of each gene during
growth on three different media. In the third approach, we
searched for putative phylogenetically conserved binding
sites of PdhR in the upstream region of each gene of
E. coli. We identified putative binding sites in the promoter regions of 363 operons containing 642 genes.
To identify further potential targets of PdhR, we sorted
all genes in whose promoter region we identified a putative binding site of PdhR independently according to
their z-scores and regulatory scores. The results of this
analysis are displayed in Table 2. Thus, we found that
particular genes belonging to the dcw cluster - which is
important in cell division [10] - are the top-ranking targets according to their z-score. In contrast, genes of the
glcDEFGBA operon, which are important in glyoxylate
and glycolate utilisation, are enriched among the targets
identified from the regulatory score. In addition to these
two operons, we selected ynfM and metB as likely targets
of a regulation by PdhR. We selected ynfM since it
encodes a putative transport protein belonging to the
major facilitory superfamily of transporters [11] and

Top-ranking genes with putative phylogenetically conserved binding sites of PdhR sorted according to z-scores (first four columns) and regulatory scores (last
four columns). Previously known targets of PdhR are marked with “*” and new targets confirmed in this study with “$”. Additionally to the new experimentally
validated targets indicated in the above table, a regulation of mraZ, murF, ddlB, ftsQ, ftsA, ftsZ and lpxC by PdhR was confirmed as they are part of the operon
that forms the dcw-cluster.

displays a marked increase of expression during growth
on pyruvate, thereby being a potential pyruvate transporter (Additional File 1). Moreover we identified metB,
which encodes an enzyme in methionine biosynthesis, as
a putative target of PdhR.
Verifying four predicted binding sites by ChIP and qPCR

The analysis of our DNA microarray data combined
with the data from databases, revealed new operons and
pathways which might be regulated by PdhR. In the first
experimental step four potential binding sites were chosen for further verification.
We tested the putative PdhR binding sites within the
operator fragments of the genes glcD (encodes a subunit
of the glycolate oxidase), mraZ (encodes a conserved
protein in front of the dcw cluster), metB (encodes
homocysteine transmethylase), and ynfM (encodes an
unknown transporter protein) by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR (qPCR).
Therefore, a culture which expresses his-tagged PdhR
was grown in LB medium. The transcription regulator
was cross-linked to chromosomal DNA. After cell lysis
and shearing the DNA, DNA-repressor complexes were
co-precipitated, the crosslinking reversed, and the DNA
purified. This DNA was used as template DNA in the

qPCR to compare the amounts of precipitated DNA
fragments containing the described binding sites.
Results are shown in Figure 2. For the tested primer
pairs, the amount of PCR product for the ptsG gene
that is not regulated by PdhR, served as a negative control PCR and was set as 1. DNA fragments of the
known binding target for PdhR self-regulation in front
of the pdhR gene were enriched by a factor of 11.6 in
the assay. The qPCR revealed an enrichment of DNA
fragments which contain the putative binding sites for
PdhR in front of the genes glcD and mraZ by a factor of
1.84 and 1.72, respectively, that are statistically significant (Figure 2).
No enrichment was found for the putative PdhR target
sequences in front of the genes metB (factor 0.98) and
ynfM (factor 0.06). The applied growth conditions in
complex rich medium might not be suitable for the
detection of all PdhR-DNA interactions, although the
overproduction of PdhRhis should facilitate binding, also
to DNA fragments which might be bound with low
affinity.
Verifying three binding sites in vitro by gel shift assays

In a second experimental step, three putative binding
sites were further investigated. The binding activity of

Figure 2 Results of the ChiP and qPCR experiments. His-tagged
PdhR was crosslinked to DNA and purified. The co-precipitated DNA
was analysed for the frequency of copies, which contain the
putative binding sites of PdhR. The operator fragment of the not
controlled ptsG gene was set as 1. The amount of DNA fragments
which contain the known self-regulating pdhR binding site of PdhR
was enriched to 11.6 times more copies compared to the negative
control. The glcD and mraZ operator fragments occur to be 1.8 and
1.7 more abundant than the control fragment. The metB DNA
fragment was detected with the same frequency as the control
fragment and the ynfM binding site was observed to be less
precipitated than the negative control. The data are mean values
with standard deviations of three experiments. The statistical
significance of the binding of PdhR to pdhR, glcD and mraZ if
compared to the control by a One-Way-ANOVA test is indicated by
asterisks (***: p-value < 0.001, **: p-value < 0.01).

PdhR towards the binding sites in front of the genes
glcD, mraZ and metB were also analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. His-tagged PdhR was purified and incubated with fluorescence labelled DNA
fragments. A complex formation of DNA and repressor
protein leads to an electrophoretic retardation and thus
a shifted fluorescence signal of the DNA fragment. The
results are shown in Figure 3. The binding of purified
PdhR to the known binding site of the operator region
in front of the pdhR gene was observed. The same binding activity was detected for the region in front of the
glcD gene, whereas the complex with the predicted
binding site in front of the mraZ gene was much
weaker. A complex with the DNA binding site of the
metB gene was not detected in this in vitro approach.
Assessing the global architecture of the PdhR regulon

Pertaining to the large number of processes regulated by
PdhR we furthermore determined its mean expression
level over the mean expression levels of all transcription
factors of E. coli in the microarray data of M 3D . Previously it was found that the number of targets of a
transcriptional regulator correlates with its expression

Figure 3 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The investigated
binding sites in front of the genes pdhR, glcD, mraZ, and metB are
displayed on the lower line. The left hand panel demonstrates an
assay for 0.1 pmol of each DNA fragment without PdhR. For the
assay shown on the right hand site, samples were incubated with
54 pmol purified PdhR prior to electrophoresis. Complex formation
of regulator protein and DNA fragment leads to a shifted DNAsignal, which is assigned by the grey box. A strong PdhR-DNA
complex is detected for the binding site in front of the pdhR gene
for the known self-regulation. The same binding activity was
monitored for the glcD binding site. Very weak affinity of PdhR was
detected towards the mraZ binding site, nevertheless a small
amount of shifted DNA was observed. No complex formation of
PdhR with the binding site in front of metB gene was monitored.

level [12]. The expression level of PdhR is close to the
median of expression levels of all transcription factors.
This suggests that while controlling distinct key cellular
processes, PdhR does so by controlling a selected number of target genes rather than a large number of target
genes like other global transcriptional regulators.

Discussion
Regulation of glcDEFGBA by PdhR

The glcD gene is the first gene of the transcription unit
glcDEFGBA. This unit encodes the glycolate oxidase
(GlcDEF), a small conserved protein of unknown function (GlcG), the malate synthase G (GlcB), and a glycolate transporter protein (GlcA). The operon is activated
by GlcC during growth on glycolate and transcribed as
a polycistronic message. The expression also depends on
the integrative host factor (IHF) and is repressed by the
respiratory regulator ArcA-P [13]. Glycolate and acetate
are degraded via the common intermediate glyoxylate.
Glyoxylate is an important intermediate of the central
metabolism under conditions when acetate or fatty acids
are the main carbon and energy source and is metabolised using the so-called glyoxylate bypass [14-16].
There are two isoenzymes, the malate synthases A and
G (AceB and GlcB) that convert glyoxylate into malate.
Both proteins belong to the acetate (AceB, encoded in

Göhler et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/197

the aceABK operon) or the glycolate/glyoxylate pathway
(GlcB), respectively. Both operons are similarly controlled by the factors IHF and ArcA-P and can fulfil
redundant roles via cross-induction [13] to avoid the
toxic accumulation of glyoxylate.
The commonly assumed route for pyruvate assimilation proceeds via the phosphoenolpyruvate synthase
PpsA which allows gluconeogenesis from this compound.
However, in a previous study it was found that the
expression level of PpsA is suboptimal for growth on pyruvate [17]. This suggests that alternative routes may exist
for pyruvate assimilation. The glyoxylate shunt could
serve this purpose as it allows gluconeogenesis from the
pyruvate derivative acetyl-CoA. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the genes for PpsA and
the glyoxylate shunt enzymes, AceA and AceB, did not
show noticeable differences in expression during growth
on acetate and pyruvate (Figure. 4). Moreover, we find
that several genes which encode enzymes involved in the
conversion of pyruvate into acetate are strongly upregulated in pyruvate grown cultures as compared to acetate
grown cultures. Thus, a transcriptional regulation of the
malate synthase GlcB, which is part of the glcDEFGBA
operon and also part of the glyoxylate shunt, would allow
the cell to control gluconeogenesis from pyruvate via the
glyoxylate shunt (Figure. 4).

Page 6 of 12

Extending the results of Pellicer and colleagues [13] who
found a cross-induction of genes required for glycolate
and acetate assimilation, our findings show that this crossinduction might also extend to genes activated during
growth on pyruvate. This is supported by the regulation of
the glcDEFGBA operon by PdhR and the finding, that
many genes known to be upregulated during growth on
acetate show no marked difference in expression during
growth on acetate and pyruvate, while genes which encode
enzymes that convert pyruvate into acetate are strongly
upregulated during growth on pyruvate but not on acetate.
Regulation of cell division by PdhR

MraZ is a protein of unknown function and is encoded in
the transcription unit mraZW-ftsLI-murEF-mraY-murDftsW-murGC-ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC which represents the dcw
cluster [10]. This unit encodes proteins involved in cell
division and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The expression of
these genes is regulated in a highly sophisticated manner
in order to time the cell division precisely (Figure 5). The
gene products of this operon need to be synthesised at the
correct time in the correct amount, and cell division has
to be prevented when stress conditions prevail. It was
shown that the mraZ1p promoter leads to transcription
up to the ftsW gene [10]. The whole unit is also postulated
to be transcribed in one message from the mraZ1p

operator to the very distal gene lpxC [10]. Furthermore,
there are many other promoter structures described or
predicted in the cluster. Five transcription starts can be
identified in the 5’ region of the cluster. This regulation
also includes repression by LexA binding to three identified SOS boxes. The transcriptional repressor LexA inhibits expression of genes involved in response to DNA
damage and DNA replication inhibition in the so-called
SOS response [18]. The repressor is inactivated by RecAdependent cleavage after DNA damage [19].
At the 3’ end of the cluster, six promoters have been
identified that contribute to the correct timing and concentration of the ftsZ gene product which is essential
for cell division [20]. Their expression is balanced by
the promoters being constantly expressed gearbox promoters. These gearbox promoters are ss dependent promoters for growth rate regulation, inversely growth rate
dependent-, and housekeeping promoters [21]. Additionally, an SdiA (Suppressor of the cell division inhibitor) dependent mechanism is integrated, which couples
expression regulation to a quorum-sensing mechanism.
Moreover, activation by the phosphorylated RcsB regulator (Regulator capsule synthesis B) was shown.
For normal cell growth and correct division, a balance
between the 5’ and 3’ encoded genes of the dcw cluster
is required (for more details on dcw regulation see [10]
and references therein).
Even though many regulatory mechanisms for the dcw
cluster have already been identified, it is still not known
how a link between the metabolic status of the cell and
cell division is established. The pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex regulator could fulfil this function, since it provides a cue to the nutritional status of the cell by sensing the pyruvate concentration. For instance, during
growth on glucose, PdhR acts as a flux sensor for the
glycolytic flux [22] that can serve as a proxy for the
nutritional status of the cell. In the case of a high glycolytic flux, indicated by higher levels of pyruvate, the
negative influence of PdhR on the dcw cluster is reduced

whereas it is increased by a low glycolytic flux resulting
in low pyruvate levels.
The influence of the metabolic status on cell division
by PdhR is reflected by a high z-score in the large-scale
analysis of microarray experiments. It is also experimentally supported by the fact that we detected a statistical
significant enrichment of the mraZ operator binding
site for PdhR by a factor of 1.7 in the in vivo assay. Up
to this point we had only been able to detect very weak
binding in our in vitro assays. This weak binding in
vitro might be due to the complex regulation of the dcw
cluster which most likely requires further interacting
partners that we could not provide in our in vitro
experiments.

Conclusions
Taken together, we identified 22 new target genes contained in two operons controlled by PdhR using a bioinformatic and an experimental approach. The regulation of
the glcDEFGBA operon and glcB in particular, as well as
the comparison of gene-expression of acetate and pyruvate
grown strains demonstrated that the metabolic state of the
cell in both conditions is very similar. In particular, we
found that in addition to the direct route to gluconeogenesis through the phospoenolpyruvate synthase, alternative
pathways for the conversion of pyruvate to acetate appear
to be activated and thus provide additional substrates for
gluconeogenesis through action of the glyoxylate shunt.
Moreover, we have identified the dcw-cluster containing
proteins required for cell division as a further regulatory
target of PdhR. Through this regulatory interaction, we
have established a plausible link between the nutritional
status of the cell and cell replication which was not known
to date. These results further support the hypothesis that
PdhR is an important regulator of diverse processes of the
cell by controlling a selected set of target genes rather
than a large number of target genes like other global regulators (Figure 6). Thus, we have also demonstrated that,
apart from being a central hub of metabolic fluxes, the

pyruvate node exerts control on many aspects of bacterial
physiology. In consequence, PdhR represents a promising
target for further studies aimed at understanding central
aspects of the interplay between metabolism and other cellular processes.

Methods
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, plasmids and media

The Escherichia coli K-12 strains LJ110 [23] and
LJ110ΔpdhR (this study) were grown in Luria-Bertani
broth (LB) or standard phosphate minimal medium [24]
supplemented with 0.2% carbon source. When carrying
the plasmids pTM30 [25] or pTM30PdhRhis [7], ampicillin was added in a concentration of 50 mg/liter. Cells were
incubated at 37°C with shaking.
For overproduction of his-tagged PdhR the strain JM109
[26] was transformed with pTM30PdhRhis and gene
expression induced with 1 mM IPTG. For construction of
a pdhR deletion mutant, the strain BW25113 and the plasmids pKD4 and pKD46 [27] were used. If necessary, kanamycin was added in a concentration of 25 mg/liter.
For the deletion of the pdhR gene we followed the protocol of Datsenko and Wanner [27]. A 1728 bp PCR product was generated by standard PCR with the primer pair
Pdhr_wanner+ (ATCCGCCAACCAAAACTCTCCGATG
TGATTGAGCAG CAACTGGGTGTAGGCTGGAGC
TGC) and Pdhr_wanner- (TTTCGTTGCTCCAGACGAC
GCAGAGAACGCTCA CGGCGGCTCTCTTCACGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG) and the plasmid pKD4 as
template. The PCR product containing the kanamycin

resistance cassette with flanking regions that are homologous to chromosomal sequences at the 5’ and 3’ end of the
pdhR gene was purified with the Wizard DNA purification
system (Promega), DpnI treated and further enriched by
ethanol precipitation. In the next step it was transformed
into BW25113 carrying pKD46. Transformants grown on
LB plates with kanamycin were picked and the successful
integration of the resistance cassette was verified by PCR
using different primer combinations of k1 (CAGTCATAGCCGAATAGCCT), k2 (CGGTGC CCTGAATGAACTGC), kt (CGGCCACAGTCGATGAATCC),
pdhr_downstream (TGATTTACAACATCTTCTGG) and
pdhr_upstream (TGACTTCGGCAAGTGGCTTAAGAC).
The chromosomal deletion of the pdhR gene in the
BW25113 strain was then transduced into the strain LJ110
via P1 vir transduction generating the strain LJ110ΔpdhR
following protocols by Arber [28] and Lengeler [29].
Determination of the growth rate

To determine the growth rate μ, cultures were grown
overnight. The next day 10 ml medium was inoculated
to an optical density650/420 = 0.1 and the OD was measured every hour. The growth rate μ was determined
during the mid-logarithmic phase.
Sample preparation for microarray analysis

Cells were grown in LB- or minimal medium containing
appropriate carbon sources and antibiotics. 1 × 109 cells
(LB medium: OD600 = 1, 1 ml culture; minimal medium:
OD 420 = 0.5, 4 ml culture) were directly added to two
volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen), mixed
by shaking and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 10 min),

Göhler et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/197

the supernatant was removed and the pellet stored at
-80°C.
DNA microarray hybridization and analysis

Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the protocol
accompanying the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Quality and integrity of the total RNA was controlled on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn, Germany). 200 ng of
total RNA were applied for Cy3-labelling reaction using
the MessageAmp II-Bacteria Kit according to supplier’s
recommendation (Ambion; Kaufungen, Germany). As a
result of IVT (in vitro transcription) reaction using aminoallyl-dUTP antisense aRNA were generated and subsequently coupled with fluorescent dye Cy3. Cy3-labeled
aRNA was hybridized to Agilent’s 8 × 15 k E. coli microarray (Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn, Germany, AMADID 020097) for 16 h at 68°C and scanned using the
Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. Expression values (raw
data) were calculated by the software package Feature
Extraction 10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn,
Germany) using default values for GE1_105_Dec08 extraction protocol. Further data manipulation was applied
according to section «Analysis of expression data from
pdhR knockout and overexpressing strains». Gene-expression data has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus
under the accession number GSE31333.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Chromatin immunoprecipitation based on a protocol from
Jeremiah Faith (http://www.jeremiahfaith.com/open_notebook_science/ C.3 ChIP Protocols and [5]) was adapted
with changes. 50 ml of LB medium in a 500 ml flask were
inoculated with an overnight culture of LJ110/
pTM30PdhRhis to an OD650 = 0.1 and grown for 30 min.
The expression of the transcription factor was induced
with 100 μM IPTG. At an OD600 = 1 15 ml culture were
crosslinked using 37% formaldehyde in a final concentration at 1%. Crosslinking was performed by inverting the
culture containing tube 10 times at room temperature. In
the next step, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3500 g,
10 min) and washed twice in cold PBS. The lysis of the
cells and immunoprecipitation was performed using the
μMACS™ His Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The pellet
was re-suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. 100 μl lysozyme
(10 mg/ml) were added and incubated for 30 min on ice.
Subsequently 10 μl 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzensulfonylfluorid (AEBSF) (100 mM) and 10 μl RNAseA (10 mg/ml)
were added and the sample was incubated another 30 min
on ice. After cell lysis the DNA was sheared on ice by
sonication using the Branson Digital Sonifier UNITS Models S-250D. The samples were sonified for 30 sec at 20%
power and incubated on ice for one minute. Sonication
was repeated four times. 900 μl of the sample were stored
at -80°C. The remaining 100 μl were used for determining
the sharing rate and incubated with 10 μl proteinase K (10

Page 9 of 12

mg/ml) and 345 μl H2Odd at 65°C overnight to reverse
crosslinking. The DNA was cleaned up using the GeneJet
PCR purification Kit (Thermo Fisher) and run on a 1.5%
agarose gel. The sharing range was determined to range
from 200 bp to 1000 bp with an average size of DNA fragments around 500 bp. The immunoprecipitation was carried out using the μMACS Anti-His MicroBeads to isolate
his-tagged PdhR protein from the sample following the
manufactures’ instructions. The 900 μl sample was thawed
on ice and incubated with the magnetic beads, loaded
onto the column and washed with buffers supplemented
with the kit. The native DNA-protein-MicroBead complex
was eluted in 100 μl TE buffer. The isolation of his-tagged
PdhR protein was checked by analyzing 5 μl of the elution
fraction by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Crosslinking was reversed by incubation of the remaining 95 μl
of the elution fraction at 65°C overnight. 1 μl of proteinase
K was added and the sample incubated at 45°C for two
hours. In the next steps the DNA was separated from proteins and MicroBeads by a phenol/chloroform extraction.
0.5 ml phenol/chloroform was added and the sample
mixed for 5 min. After one minute of incubation without
mixing, the sample was mixed again for 2 min. The last
two steps were repeated three times. Phase separation was
carried out by a centrifugation step at 13000 rpm for 5
min. The DNA containing phase was transferred into a
new cup and 1/10 volume of Na-Acetate (3 M, pH 6) and
1 ml ethanol were added. The sample was placed at -20°C
overnight, centrifuged (13000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C), and
washed in 80% ethanol. The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 100 μl TE.
Quantitative PCR

Quantitative PCR was performed using the iCycler
Thermal Cycler from BioRad. The qPCR was run in 25
μl reactions containing 12.5 μl Maxima™ SYBR Green
qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), 2.5 μl primer+ and
2.5 μl primer- (10 pmol/μl), 5.5 μl H2 Odd and 2 μl of
the DNA which was co-precipitated, purified and concentrated. One DNA sample was used as template in six
PCR reactions with each of the six primer pairs to compare the relative amount of PCR product. The primer
pairs were chosen that they surround the putative binding site and give products of a length between 200 and
300 bps. The primers were checked in a standard endpoint PCR that they only amplify one product of the
desired length. An annealing temperature of 51°C was
determined to be suitable for all primer pairs. Therefore
the reaction with all primer pairs could be run in the
same qPCR. The primers are listed in Table 3. The
results were analyzed with the qbase PLUS software
(Biogazelle).
Purification of his-tagged PdhR

His-tagged PdhR was produced and purified as
described earlier [7].

Gel shift assays

Assays were carried out as described previously [7]. All
DNA probes were generated by annealing equimolar
amount of fluorescence labeled primers (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) of the known or predicted PdhR binding
sites. The primers are listed in Table 4; binding regions
are marked in grey.
Bioinformatics procedures
Large-scale analysis of gene expression data from M3D

To elucidate further targets of PdhR we used data from
907 microarray experiments stored in M3D [8]. We used
the implementation of the context-likelihood of relatedness algorithm [5] provided in the R-package DTInfer [7]
to determine potential targets of PdhR. In short, we computed the mutual information between the expression of
pdhR and each gene of E. coli across the 907 microarray
experiments. The significance of each of the mutual information values was estimated by computation of a z-score.
This z-score is the square root of the sum of squares of
two scores: the z1 and the z2-score. For the mutual information value I(i, j) between the expression vectors of gene
i and gene j, z1 corresponds to the relative position of I(i,
j) in the distribution of all mutual information values
involving gene i and z2 to the relative position of I(i, j) in
the distribution of all mutual information values involving

gene j. Since we were interested in regulatory targets of
PdhR we subsequently discarded z-scores for all interactions not involving PdhR. By sorting genes according to
their z-scores, we obtained a ranking of genes according
to their likelihood to be regulated by PdhR. The z-scores
of regulatory interactions involving PdhR are given in
Additional File 1.
Analysis of expression data from pdhR knockout and
overexpressing strains

To provide an independent line of evidence, we determined the gene expression of four different strains of
E. coli on three different media. The four strains corresponded to E. coli LJ110, a pdhR knockout mutant
(LJ110ΔpdhR), the parental strain carrying an empty plasmid (LJ110/pTM30) and the parental strain overproducing
PdhR (LJ110/pTM30PdhRhis). These strains were cultivated on Luria-Bertani broth (LB), standard phosphate
minimal medium supplemented with acetate and standard
phosphate minimal medium supplemented with pyruvate.
We obtained an overall 24 microarray experiments from
two biological replicates of each of these cultivations as
described above.
To analyse the quality of the microarray data, the raw
gene-expression data were quantil-normalized using the
package ‘preprocessCore’ of the Bioconductor Software
[30]. The probes with low signal intensity were discarded
for further analysis. In order to exclude samples that are
not clearly attributable to their culture condition, the following quality check was performed. The high dimensional space of the gene expression data was mapped to a
two- or three-dimensional space using the nonlinear
Sammon projection method [31] implemented in the R
package ‘MASS’ [32]. To detect possible outliers in the
set of samples a model-based clustering approach using
the R package mclust [33] was performed. This analysis
identified three of the 24 microarrays that were not
clearly attributable to culture conditions and were thus
discarded from the subsequent analysis. To detect genes
that were particularly affected by overexpression and
knockout of pdhR, we determined for each gene i in each
medium an average overexpression o i and an average
knockout score ki as follows. Overexpression scores were

determined by subtracting the log expression values of
the strain carrying the empty plasmid from the overexpression strain. Knockout scores were obtained by subtracting the log expression value of the parental strain
from the knockout strain. Due to the three discarded
microarray experiments we thus obtained five knockout
and four overexpression scores for each gene. For each
gene the average knockout and average overexpression
score was determined as average over the knockout and
overexpression scores, respectively. Finally, we obtained a
regulatory score over all microarrays by subtracting, for
each gene, the overexpression score from the knockout
score. Since PdhR is known to repress the transcription
of most of its targets, we expect known targets of PdhR
to have a high regulatory score in our experiments. The
regulatory scores of all genes are given in Additional
File 1.
Identification of candidates for experimental validation

To identify potential candidates for experimental validation of potential interactions we determined for each gene
of E. coli whether we could identify a putative phylogenetically conserved transcription factor binding site of PdhR in
its upstream region as described previously [7]. In brief, we
aligned known binding sites of PdhR using the R-package
cosmo [34] with the promoter region of each gene. If we
thus identified a DNA sequence that resembled known
binding sites of PdhR, we checked whether the corresponding region coincides with a part of the promoter
known to be phylogenetically conserved upstream of
genes in ten proteobacterial genomes [35,36]. We identified potential binding sites of PdhR in the promoter
regions of 363 operons containing 642 genes. We ranked
the genes in this list independently according to the
z-score of a regulation by PdhR and according to the regulatory score obtained from our own microarray experiments. The top-ranking 20 candidates in either of both
lists are displayed in Table 2.
Comparison of gene-expression between acetate and
pyruvate grown cultures

Since no transporter for pyruvate is known in E. coli to
date, we aimed to identify the corresponding gene(s) by
comparison of gene-expression between acetate and pyruvate grown cultures. Thus, we computed average foldchanges between acetate and pyruvate grown cultures.
The gene with the strongest overexpression possessing a
putative phylogenetically conserved binding site of PdhR
was ynfM. This gene encodes a transporter belonging to
the major facilatory superfamily of transporters with yet
unknown function. Moreover, ynfM showed a high regulatory score in the comparison of PdhR-knockout and
overexpression strains (Additional File 1). These results
led us to hypothesize that ynfM is a pyruvate transporter
in E. coli. However, complementation studies in a mutant

Page 11 of 12

strain that does not grow on pyruvate minimal medium
could not confirm these results (data not shown).
