Repeated reunions and splits feature the highly
dynamic evolution of 5S and 35S ribosomal RNA
genes (rDNA) in the Asteraceae family

Abstract
Background: In flowering plants and animals the most common ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) organisation is that
in which 35S (encoding 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA) and 5S genes are physically separated occupying different
chromosomal loci. However, recent observations established that both genes have been unified to a single 35S-5S
unit in the genus Artemisia (Asteraceae), a genomic arrangement typical of primitive eukaryotes such as yeast,
among others. Here we aim to reveal the origin, distribution and mechanisms leading to the linked organisation of
rDNA in the Asteraceae by analysing unit structure (PCR, Southern blot, sequencing), gene copy number
(quantitative PCR) and chromosomal position (FISH) of 5S and 35S rRNA genes in ~200 species representing the
family diversity and other closely related groups.
Results: Dominant linked rDNA genotype was found within three large groups in subfamily Asteroideae: tribe
Anthemideae (93% of the studied cases), tribe Gnaphalieae (100%) and in the “Heliantheae alliance” (23%). The
remaining five tribes of the Asteroideae displayed canonical non linked arrangement of rDNA, as did the other
groups in the Asteraceae. Nevertheless, low copy linked genes were identified among several species that
amplified unlinked units. The conserved position of functional 5S insertions downstream from the 26S gene
suggests a unique, perhaps retrotransposon-mediated integration event at the base of subfamily Asteroideae.
Further evolution likely involved divergence of 26S-5S intergenic spacers, amplification and homogenisation of
units across the chromosomes and concomitant elimination of unlinked arrays. However, the opposite trend, from
linked towards unlinked arrangement was also surmised in few species indicating possible reversibility of these
processes.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that nearly 25% of Asteraceae species may have evolved unusual linked
arrangement of rRNA genes. Thus, in plants, fundamental changes in intrinsic structure of rDNA units, their copy
number and chromosomal organisation may occur within relatively short evolutionary time. We hypothesize that
the 5S gene integration within the 35S unit might have repeatedly occurred during plant evolution, and probably
once in Asteraceae.

Background
It is generally considered that in prokaryotes and in
some species of early diverging eukaryote groups e.g.
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rRNA genes are organised in a single operon, clustered in tandem and transcribed by the same RNA polymerase. In eukaryotes, the
35S (encoding 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA) and 5S genes are

transcribed by different polymerases, RNA polymerase I
and III, respectively. Independent control of transcription probably enabled physical separation of both loci in
chromosomes, an arrangement that is typical for most
eukaryotic organisms. Nevertheless, it seems that there
are several exceptions to this rule. For example, 5S
genes linkage to other repetitive sequences including
35S, histone genes or the trans-spliced leader has been
demonstrated [1]. These linked arrangements are found
among diverse biological taxa including nematodes [2],
fungi [3], crustaceans [4], slime moulds [5] or mosses

[6,7], and they are believed to represent transition states
between linked (prokaryotic) and unlinked (eukaryotic)
arrangements. However, our recent observations in a
group of angiosperms (genus Artemisia, Asteraceae) [8]
clearly point to the possibility that linked arrangements
might not be restricted to prokaryotes and primitive
eukaryotes but may occur throughout the tree of life.
The Asteraceae, also named Compositae, is the largest family of the angiosperms in terms of numbers of
species, with 1,620 genera and 23,600 species [9], constituting approximately 8-10% of all flowering plants.
Although many trees and shrubs exist, a majority of
species of Asteraceae are herbaceous, and they are
easily recognizable by a suite of characters including
fused anthers, a fruit with a single ovule, and a specialized inflorescence termed the capitulum. The family
occurs in all continents of the world except Antarctica
[9] and includes many edible, medicinal, noxious, invasive or endangered species. Estimates indicate that the
Asteraceae originated in the mid Eocene (45-49 Mya)
and that most tribal splits occurred during the Oligocene (28-36 Mya)[10]. The family has been the subject
of intensive phylogenetic analyses using all kinds of
molecular and morphological data [9,11] and it is currently considered to hold 12 major lineages [12], four
of which (Asteroideae, Carduoideae, Cichorioideae and
Mutisioideae) comprise 99% of its species diversity.
Considering the size and importance of this family,
however, relatively little has been published about
rDNA position, organisation and structure in this
group as a whole. In the past, the 5S and 35S genes
have been mapped on chromosomes in some Asteraceae genera, e.g. Tragopogon [13], Centaurea [14],
Helianthus [15], and Hypochaeris [16,17] among
others, showing one or several separate loci of each,
mostly in different chromosomes. In contrast, initial
FISH mapping on Artemisia showed colocalised 35S
and 5S signals [18-20]. Employing molecular methods
we have recently demonstrated that several Artemisia
species have evolved unusual ribosomal units resembling the arrangement in yeast: the 5S genes locate
within the 26S-18S intergenic spacer and are transcribed from the opposite strand of the 35S rDNA
operon [8]. In species displaying linked arrangement
the homogenisation of linked rRNA genes most likely
went to completion, since no unlinked genes were
detected by FISH or Southern blot hybridisation. Taking into account the large size of the family it is not
known how frequently such arrangement occurs,
whether it is conserved in related species, its chromosomal dynamics and evolutionary success. With these
issues in mind, we examined ribosomal DNA structure
and organisation in selected representatives of the
Asteraceae using molecular and cytogenetic methods.

In addition, we searched for any nodes in extant Asteraceae phylogeny [21,22] that mark a switch in the
organisation of rDNA.

Methods
Plant materials

Leaf or seed material for 199 populations of the different species studied was obtained either from wild populations, botanical gardens/herbaria worldwide, or
through plants grown at the greenhouses of the Institute
of Biophysics (Brno) and of the Botanical Institute of
Barcelona, from seeds obtained by Index Seminum or
purchased. Additional file 1 summarizes the provenance
of all the taxa investigated.
Southern blot hybridisation

Purified genomic DNAs and PCR products were
digested with restriction enzymes and separated by gel
electrophoresis on a 0.9% (w/v) agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were alkali blotted onto HybondXL membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK)
and hybridised with 32P-labelled DNA probes (DekaLabel kit, MBI, Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) as described
in [8]. After washing under high-stringency conditions,
the hybridisation bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale,
CA), and the data were processed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The probes were a 220-bp
PCR product derived from the 3′ end of the 26S rRNA
gene of tobacco [23] and a cloned ~120 bp of the 5S
genic region, also from tobacco [24].
Conventional PCR

Three PCR primers were used to amplify products
assuming some linkage of 35S and 5S rRNA genes in
either direct (head to tail) or inverted (tail to tail) orientations. The positions of the PCR primers are depicted
in Figure 1. The primers were: 5SLf (5′-CCTG
GGAATTCCTCGTGTT-3′), 5SLr (5′-TGCGTTAAAG
CTTGTATGATCGCAT-3′) from [24], and 26Sf (5′GAATTCACCCAAGTGTTGGGAT-3′), originally called
P1 in [23]. The PCR profile used for amplification was:
initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min followed by 35
cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 30 s at 57°C and 30 s at 72°C;
and a final extension step at 72°C, 10 min.
Real time PCR

Quantification of the rRNA gene copies was done using
the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (SAbiosciences, Fredrick, MD, USA) by the 7300 Real Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The
26S-5S unit was amplified with the Pr-1 (5′-AGACG
ACTTAAATACGCGAC-3′) and 5SLf primers; the control P2P gene was amplified with the forward primer

5′-CTGGATTTGCTGGTGATGAT-3′ and the reverse

same PCR cycle to get an estimate of DNA concentration (initial denaturation at 94°C for 7 min followed by
40 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 20 s at 56°C and 30 s at 72°C;
and a final extension step at 72°C, 10 min). The SYBR
Green I fluorescence was monitored consecutively after
the extension step. A standard curve was made of series
dilutions of the pAA_IGS-12 plasmid containing a
cloned IGS from A. absinthium [GenBank accession
number: EU649669]. This curve was then used to estimate amounts of rDNA in each of the samples based on
the cross point values. The number of genes were calculated according to the formula: N = m/M × C × 1/10

where m is the amount of rDNA in ng; M, amount of
genomic DNA input in ng; C, genome size in kb; 1/10 is
a constant related to average size of rDNA unit (10 kb).
The genome size data were taken from [26-28] and
Plant DNA C-values Database (http://data.kew.org/cvalues/[29]).
Cloning experiments

To isolate intergenic spacer sequences we used Pr-1 and
Pr-2 (5′-GGCTTAATCTTTGAGACAA-3′) primers [30].
The DyNAzyme™II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo,
Finland), was used in these PCRs; each reaction contained ~100 ng of genomic DNA. Following PCR, the
products were gel-purified and the isolated fragments

(QIAquick PCR purification kit, Hilden, Germany) were
cloned into the pDrive vector (QIAGEN PCR Cloning
Kit (Qiagen). Several positive clones were recovered
from each transformation reaction and analysed for the
lengths of insert by gel electrophoresis. Only clones containing inserts > 3 kb in size were further considered.
The full length IGS constructs were obtained from
Tagetes patula (pTPa_IGS, two clones), Matricaria
matricarioides (pMMa_IGS, three clones), Gnaphalium
luteoalbum (pGLu_IGS, three clones), Helichrysum cymosum (pHCy_IGS, two clones), Madia sativa
(pMSa_IGS, two clones), Elachanthemum intricatum
(pEIn_IGS, four clones) and Helianthus annuus (pHAn_IGS, two clones). The clones were sequenced both
from the side of 26S and 18S genes (Eurofins, MWG
Operon, Eberberg, Germany). The newly identified
sequences were submitted to the EMBL/GenBank under
the accession numbers [HM160523-29].

Abbott Molecular, IL, USA). The FISH hybridisation
mixture (20 μL per slide) consisted of labelled DNA
probes, 4 μL of a 50% solution of dextran sulphate, 10
μL formamide, 0.5 μL TE buffer and 2 μL 20 × SSC,
and it was denatured at 75°C for 15 min and immediately cooled on ice. Slides were denatured in a thermocycler using a flat plate: 5 min at 75°C, 2 min at 65°C, 2
min at 55°C, 2 min at 45°C, and transferred into a prewarmed moist chamber and put into an incubator. After
overnight hybridisation at 37°C, the slides were washed
with 2× SSC, 0.1× SSC (high stringency), at 42°C for 10
min each followed by washes with 2× SSC, 4× SSC +
0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. Slides were rinsed
in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlinghame, CA, USA) containing DAPI (1 μg/
ml-1). FISH signals were observed using an Olympus AX
70 fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. Images were analysed and processed using ISIS software (MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany).

Phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were assembled with the help of Bioedit software [31], manually edited and aligned. Phylogenetic
relationships between clones were inferred from phylograms constructed based on the neighbor-joining (NJ)
algorithm with the setting of the Kimura two-parameter
substitution model. The statistical support for branching
was obtained with a bootstrap analysis: 500 repetitions
were carried out using the PHYLOWIN program [32].
The distances between individual clones were calculated
with the assistance of DnaSP 4.0 software [33].
Fluorescent in situ hybridisation

The fresh root tips were pretreated with an aqueous
solution of colchicine 0.05% at room temperature, for
2.5 - 4 h and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol: acetic acid. Protoplasts were obtained using cellulolytic enzymes,
dropped onto microscope slides, frozen and desiccated
using liquid nitrogen and 70% ethanol. Before FISH, the
slides were pre-treated with 50 μg mL-1 RNaseA for 1 h
at 37°C in humid chamber. After washing three times in
2× SSC (2× standard saline citrate + 0.1% (w/v) sodium
dodecyl sulfate), slides were dehydrated in an ethanol
series and air-dried. Remnants of cytoplasm were
removed with pepsin treatment (10 μg mL-1 in 10 mM
HCl, 4 min room temperature). The slides were then
washed, dehydrated in ethanol and fixed for 10 min in
3.7% formaldehyde in 1× PBS, washed three times in 2×
SSC, dehydrated again and air dried. The hybridisation
mix contained 50 ng μL-1 of Cy3-labelled (GE Healthcare, Chalfont, St Giles, UK) 5S probe, a 116 bp-long
insert of the cloned tobacco 5S rRNA gene [24], and 20
ng μL-1 of 35S rDNA probe (a 2.5 kb fragment of 26S
rRNA gene from tomato labelled with Spectrum Green,

Results
Species collections

We aimed to sample representative members of all subfamilies and most tribes within the Asteraceae (according to the recent phylogenetic revisions, see [22,34]) In
decreasing order, the largest groups within this family
are: subfamily Asteroideae, 17,000 species (73% of the
family) > subfamily Cichorioideae (12.4%) > subfamily
Carduoideae (11%). Out of the selected 199 accessions,
72% belong to subfamily Asteroideae, 9% to Cichorioideae and 7% to Carduoideae. The remaining 12% of the
sample is composed by the other 9 subfamilies that
complete the Asteraceae and by a representation of the
sister families Calyceraceae and Goodeniaceae, the closely related Campanulaceae and Menyanthaceae, and
the Solanaceae as a control as done in [10]. We consider that our sample selection is roughly reflecting distribution and relative abundance of species among the
subfamilies and tribes. Multiple individuals per species
were analysed and where possible different populations
were scored. The complete list of taxa included in this
study and details of specimens are given in Additional
file 1.
Genomic organisation of rDNA analysed by PCR

The PCR primers (Figure 1A) were used to amplify 5S
genes with different genomic arrangements: (i) linked to
the 26S gene (either in forward or reverse orientation,
26Sf-5Sf and 26Sf-5Sr), or (ii) long tandems of genes
linked to its own via intergenic spacer (5Sf-5Sr) (Figure
1A). In total 199 DNA samples from 182 species were
analysed with both sets of primers. Examples of amplification profiles are shown in Figure 1B and results

summarized in Additional file 1. The DNA samples can
be categorized into 4 groups according to PCR profiles:
1. DNAs producing amplification products with the
5SLf-5SLr primers but not with the 26Sf-5S primers
(both combinations). These species were categorized
as Group I species. Multiple regularly spaced bands
in the 5S-5S profiles correspond to amplification of
oligomeric units in tandems (mono-, di-, tri-, etc.).
Thus Group I profile is consistent with a canonical
separate unlinked tandem arrangement of 5S rRNA
genes.
2. The DNA samples yielding strong 26Sf-5SLf PCR
products and no 5SLf-5SLr products were categorized as Group II species. The patterns were interpreted as dominant linked 35S-5S arrangement in
which the 5S genes are in an inverse orientation
with respect to the direction of the 26S gene
transcription.
3. There were cases of amplification products
obtained with both 5SLf-5SLr and 26Sf-5SLf primer
sets. This situation (Group III) might correspond to
the presence of both linked and unlinked genes in

Page 5 of 18

the same genome, albeit in different proportions, as
shown further.
4. Finally, few species such as Madia sativa (or
Mutisia speciosa and also Tithonia rotundifolia, not
shown) yielded amplification products with 26Sf5SLr primer sets instead of the 26Sf-5SLf combination, that did not produce a product in these
species), possibly indicating a direct orientation of
the 26S-5S linkage at least in some units. These species (Group IV) also yielded positive PCR signals
with the 5SLf-5SLr primer combination.

Genomic organisation of rDNA analysed by Southern blot
hybridisation

In order to validate and quantify the results of PCR analysis we carried out Southern blot hybridisation. We
digested genomic DNA with BamHI restriction enzyme,
which has conserved recognition sites within both 5S
and 26S genes. The blots were hybridised subsequently
with the 26S, 5S and IGS probes. Examples of hybridisation profiles are shown in Figure 2 and results for all
the species presented in Additional file 1.

Figure 2 Southern blot hybridisation analysis of rDNA arrangements. The genomic DNAs representative species from each Group (I-IV)
were digested with BamHI and hybridised on blots with the respective DNA probes. The images were cut and arranged into panels, each
representing individual species hybridised with the 5S and 26S probes. The sizes of monomeric units of tandemly arranged 5S repeats (Groups I,
III and IV) were ~0.5 kb; the size of a major 26S-5S band in Group II species was 2-3 kb.

Garcia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:176
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/176

Basically, two hybridisation profiles could be distinguished:
1. The 5S probe hybridisation bands having no overlap with the 26S hybridisation signals. These ladder
profiles are consistent with long tandems of unlinked
5S genes. The 26S probe usually hybridised to several high molecular weight bands indicating the presence multiple IGS families lacking 5S insertions.
Contrast to the 5S profile the 26S hybridisation did
not generate a regular ladder of fragments which is
explained by the presence of multiple BamHI sites
within the 35S unit (Figure 1A). These 5S and 26S
hybridisation patterns were observed with all Group
I, III and IV DNAs after the digestion with BamHI.
Patterns do not support the presence of long arrays
composed of linked units in Group III and IV species despite positive PCR signals with the 26S-5S primer sets.
2. The Group II plants showed extensive cohybridisation of 26S and 5S probes to the same restriction
fragments, consistent with dominant linked arrangement of both genes in the genome. The sizes of
major fragments (2.5-3.0 kb) differed slightly
between the species probably reflecting sequence
polymorphism in the spacer between the 26S and 5S
genes (confirmed by sequencing - see further below).
In Antennaria, Tagetes and Tanacetum the major
fraction (2.5-3.0 kb) migrated as doublets or triplets,
indicating the presence of multiple gene families. On
the other hand Coreopsis, Evax, Matricaria and
Pseudognaphalium, had single bands in this region
showing a single dominant family. The minor higher
molecular weight fragments (> 5 kb) resulted most
likely from inhibition of enzyme digestion due to

Page 6 of 18

methylation or mutation. Few 5S-hybridising fragments (e.g. in Coreopsis, Matricaria, Pseudognaphalium and Tanacetum) did not hybridise with the 26S
probe while they did hybridise to the IGS probe
from Artemisia (not shown).

Quantitative PCR

To determine the approximate copy number of linked
rDNA units we carried out quantitative PCR. Since the
sequences are amplified exponentially we expected that
the high copy genes would need less cycles to amplify
(low cross point values) than the low copy genes (high
cross point values). With this supposition we amplified
linked units using the Pr1-5SLf primers (Figure 1A). In
accord with this, the cross point intervals for species with
linked organisation (Artemisia, Coreopsis, Gnaphalium
and Matricaria) were typically within 8-9 cycles using
100 ng DNA of template. In species with mostly unlinked
arrangement the cross point intervals appeared after 2528 cycles (Elachanthemum intricanum) or did not occur
at all (Helianthus annus). Examples of amplification
curves are shown in Additional file 2. These results
revealed that there were approximately 5-10 thousand
copies of linked 35S-5S units per Group II genome (Figure 3) whereas the Group I genomes had linked units in
low copies (< 10) or they occurred below the detection
limit. We also estimated the copy number of 26S genes
using the specific primers. In this case, amplification
plots were similar in all DNA samples irrespective of
linked or unlinked genomic organisation (not shown).
Structure of the 26S-18S intergenic spacers

To determine the structure of intergenic spacer and
linked 5S genes we amplified the sequences between

inversely positioned 26S-5S genes. The graph shows mean values obtained from three independent experiments. Example of the amplification
plot for Artemisia and Elachanthemum is shown in Additional file 2.

Garcia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:176

26S and 18S genes. The templates included genomic
DNA from species bearing linked (Group II species) and
unlinked arrangement of rRNA genes (Groups I, III and
IV). In each species between 2 to 3 clones were
sequenced from the side of the 26S and 18S genes. The
organisation of the IGS is schematically drawn in Figure
4A. With the exception of Madia sativa, the inverse
orientation of 5S insertion(s) was highly conserved
between the species. The longest IGS1 appeared to be
present in Artemisia absinthium (454 bp) while the
shortest was found in Tagetes minuta (210 bp). These
assumptions are also consistent with the variable size of
major BamHI fragments on the Southern blots (Figure
2). It is likely that evolution of IGS1 was accompanied
by numerous deletion and insertion events.
Surprisingly, sensitive pairwise comparisons (5S versus
IGS) revealed partial homologies to 5S genes in species
that have evolved unlinked arrangement of units. For
example, Elachanthemum IGS carries a 5S remnant in
close proximity to the 26S gene. Madia sativa IGS contained a highly mutated (52% homology) 5S sequence ~
350 bp downstream from the 26S gene (Figure 4A), a
peculiar feature of this presumed 5S insertion is its
direct orientation with respect to the 26S gene. In Elachanthemum and Madia both regulatory regions (A and
C boxes) were mutated or deleted (Figure 5), suggesting
that these 5S insertions are not transcribed and probably
represent non-functional pseudogenes. There were no
apparent 3′ terminators while there was a motif resembling cellular polyadenylation signal in the sequence of
Madia. No 5S-like sequences were found in the IGS of
Helianthus. The 5S remnants within the IGS could
potentially explain the presence of 26Sf-5SLf (r) PCR
products in Group III and IV species.
Since 5S-homologous sequences have been found
among the SINE3 retrotransposons in eukaryotic
organisms [35], including plants [36], we searched the
5S flanking sequences for distinctive motifs typical of
retroelements such as short repeats, long terminal
repeats (LTR), transcription priming sites and duplications of 18S and 26S genes. All IGS analysed contained
motifs resembling consensus sequences of terminal
inverted repeats (TIR) of Cassandra retroelements (Figure 4B), which carry independently transcribed 5S
rRNA genes [36]. Their position was variable within
<200 bp upstream or downstream from the 5S genic
region (Figure 4A). In some cases homology extended
to the LTRs. Duplications of a putative integration site
as well as domains typical from autonomous retrotransposons (e.g. reverse transcriptase) were, however, not
found.
The aligned 5S sequences comprising both genic and
flanking regions are shown in Figure 5. In species that
homogenised the 35S-5S units (Group II plants) the

Page 7 of 18

linked 5S copies contained all regulatory elements to
execute transcription by polymerase III: the A and C
boxes were found at conserved positions. While box A
was invariant there was slight sequence variation in box
C. The transcription starts (TSS) at G is preceded by a
highly conserved C at -1. The TATA sequence appeared
to be fairly conserved located about 24-30 bp upstream
from the transcription start site. Most species had two
oligo dT terminators in the 3′ flanking region while
Helichrysum cymosum sequence bears a single 16-17
bp-long T track immediately downstream from the
genic region. In short, the species with homogenised
linked arrangements bear apparently functional 5S genes
in the 26S-18S intergenic spacer(s).
The sequence divergences along individual regions of
units are given in Additional file 3. As expected, both
26S and 5S genic parts were highly conserved while the
inter- and intra genic spacers were less conserved.
There was a 10 fold difference in divergence levels
between genic and non-genic regions. Thus, the 5S
insertions evolve in concert with linked 18S-5.8S-26S
genes.
Phylogenetic relationships between rRNA gene families

Using neighbour joining analysis we constructed a tree
comprising several representative 5S sequences bearing
linked and unlinked arrangement of rDNA (Figure 6A).
We also included 5S sequences located within the LTRs
of recently discovered Cassandra retroelements in other
angiosperm species [36]. Both linked and unlinked 5S
genes from angiosperms clustered into the same branch.
However, there was poor resolution inside the clades,
indicating none or little phylogenetic signal at this taxonomic level. We conclude that switches in the arrangement of 5S genes probably did not influence their
homogeneity, structural and functional features. Funaria
hygrometrica, a moss bearing linked rRNA genes [6]
appears in a separate branch from the angiosperm
sequences, as does the mold Neurospora crassa. In contrast with the genic sequences, the 5S within the LTR of
Cassandra transposons form separate highly diversified
branches consistent with the previously constructed tree
[36].
The phyogenetic tree constructed from the IGS1
sequences is shown in Figure 6B. The topology of major
clades is reminiscent to that previously published
[21,37]. Well supported branches at the genus levels are
of note.
Fluorescent in situ hybridisation

To reveal chromosomal positions of rDNA loci and the
degree of repeat homogenisation we conducted FISH
assays in selected representatives of the Asteroideae

rRNA genes were visible. An exception to the rule could
be a faint 5S locus in Coreopsis that failed to hybridise
with the 26S probe. However, we do not know whether
this was caused by weak 26S hybridisation or a true

Cichorieae, from subfamily Cichorioideae) present typical unlinked rDNA arrangement with 5S located interstitially and the 35S loci being terminal. One rDNA
locus in Dahlia pinnata showed partial overlap of both
26S and 5S probes.
A summary of FISH data for all species is presented in
Table 1. Given that the sensitivity limit of FISH is about
10-50 kb [12], equalling to tandems of twenty to hundred 5S or one to five 35S rRNA genes, we can conclude that there are probably no long tandems of
unlinked 5S or 35S copies in most species of Group II
genomes. Conversely, in Group I genomes there are no
significant arrays bearing linked units.

Discussion
Two contrasting modes of rDNA organisation in
Asteraceae

In this work, we investigated genomic and chromosomal
organisation of 35S and 5S rRNA genes in ~200 plant
species from the 12 subfamilies currently recognized in
Asteraceae [21,22] and from other closely related
families as control. We observed frequent physical linkages of both genes in the subfamily Asteroideae,
whereas the remaining 12 subfamilies and the other
families studied had a separate organisation. Thus,
linked arrangement of rDNA arose independently in the
largest subfamily. However, there are differences
between these tribes: the linked arrangement was frequently found in Anthemideae, Gnaphalieae and in
“Heliantheae alliance” but it is apparently not present in
tribes Astereae, Calenduleae, Senecioneae, Inuleae and
Athroismeae (Figure 9). Tribe Anthemideae comprises
~1,800 species (~7.6% of the family), “Heliantheae alliance” ~5,700 species (~24% of the family) and tribe
Gnaphalieae around 1,200 species (~5% of the family).
The high incidence of linked arrangement in the latter
tribe (100% according to the studied species) is also supported by the recent observation of 35S-5S linkage
among species of genus Achyrocline [38]. In contrast to
Gnaphalieae a variable number of species with unlinked
rRNA genes has been found in Anthemideae (7%) and
“Heliantheae alliance” (77%). For example, Chrysanthemum zawadskii or Elachanthemum intricatum of tribe
Anthemideae have unlinked organisation whereas most
members of the tribe studied (93% cases) show linked
arrangement of rDNAs. In “Heliantheae alliance” there
is probably even more variation: the commercial

Page 10 of 18

accessions of sunflower, Helianthus annuus and Dahlia
pinnata present an unlinked arrangement (Figure 8),
whereas Tagetes patula and Coreopsis major (Figure 7)
show linked rRNA genes. Coreopsis and Dahlia are
members of tribe Coreopsideae, nevertheless, they show
contrasting patterns of rDNA arrangements. Finally,
there may also exist dispersed low copy 5S genes (either
complete or remnants) linked to 26S genes (and perhaps
to other repeats) as evidenced by PCR signals (Group III
and IV species). These loci probably escape FISH or
Southern blot detection limits (Figure 2 and Additional
file 1).
The assorted situation here resembles that of primitive
eukaryotes (yeast or other fungi) in which 5S genes display either linked arrangement with the other rDNAs,
unlinked tandems, or even a dispersed organisation [3].
The results obtained in this study are significant since
they show variation in rDNA arrangements even
between species assumed to diverge relatively recently,
such as the mentioned case of the very closely related
genera Elachanthemum and Artemisia. Based on molecular clock dating, it appears that the family is not older
than 50 Myrs [39] and species within most tribes probably diverged recently [40]. Together, linkage cannot be
considered as an exclusive characteristic of the family,
subfamily or tribe since significant rearrangements of
rDNA probably occur at lower taxonomic levels such as
the genus.
Mechanisms of rDNA rearrangements

Based on the widespread occurrence of separate organisation of rRNA genes in angiosperms, it is plausible to
assume (although not proved) that the most primitive
organisation was the unlinked from which the linked
arrangement eventually evolved. Our data show that
~25% of Asteraceae species homogenised several thousands of linked units to completion without evidence for
long arrays of unlinked loci, indicating that at some
stage the unlinked arrays have been replaced by the
linked through concerted evolution. Several hypotheses
involving DNA recombination and RNA mediated transposition have been previously proposed to explain
appearance of linked rRNA genes in fungi and nematodes [1]. We have adapted these hypotheses to explain
this astonishing efficiency of rDNA unit replacement.
Our model (Figure 10) considers a cascade of genetic
events that may be fast or slow, unidirectional or reversible.
1. The initial phase probably involved a retrotransposition event that inserted a 5S gene(s) into the
IGS (Figure 10A). This assumption is supported by
several retroelement features found in the IGS of
many of the studied species: (i) imperfect short 4-7

bp terminal inverted repeats, resembling those of
non-autonomous TRIM retroelements called Cassandra (carrying 5S-like sequences, [36]), were found in
close proximity to the 5S insertions (Figure 4B). In
some species (e.g. G. luteoalbum), the homology
apparently included several additional base pairs of

Cassandra LTR; (ii) motifs resembling potential primer binding sites (PBS) for reverse transcription
(minus strand) occur not only in the IGS of some
species [8] but, interestingly, also within the genic
region (close to the 5′end) pointing to the retrotransposon origin of 5S genes, in general.

Figure 9 Phylogenetic distribution of rDNA arrangement in the subfamily Asteroideae. All groups showing homogenised linked
arrangement are present. Tree topology is according to the published phylogeny [21]. Red and black lines indicate evolutionary trajectories of
linked and unlinked units, respectively.

It also has to be mentioned that there are features
that distinguish the 5S IGS insertions from Cassandra
retroelements. First, the 5S insertions in IGS contain
all structural features of functional 5S genes at least
in species that homogenised linked units to completion. On the other hand the 5S-LTRs of the
sequenced Cassandra clones are mutated and unlikely
to encode functional RNA molecules. This is supported by the phylogenetic analysis that failed to distinguish between linked and unlinked cellular copies
of 5S but clearly separated these from Cassandra
sequences (Figure 6A). The second distinction is that
while termination signals follow immediately after the
5S coding region in the genic 5S, absence of terminators in Cassandra sequences extends polymerization
to LTR by >400 nt [36]. It is unlikely that molecules
of this size would be accurately processed and packed
into ribosomes. Clearly, Cassandra elements, on their
own, could not serve as 5S vehicles that carried functional 5S genes into the IGS. However, while there
are thousands of similar copies in plant genomes we
cannot exclude the possibility that there may be a yet
undiscovered Cassandra locus bearing a functional 5S
gene. Alternatively, a recombination event could have
occurred between a retroelement and 5S tandems in
a putative Asteroideae progenitor giving rise to a
novel element. The presence of 5S-5S spacer
sequences and duplication of 5S insertions in some
IGS clones (Figure 4) could support the hypothesis.
While the divergence of 5S flanking sequences (Figures 5 and Additional file 3) point to multiple integration events, an alternative interpretation is also
possible since the part of IGS downstream from the

26S gene is under low selective constraint (the lowest within the 35S unit), and residing sequences
(tandem repeats and minisatellites) may evolve and
change rapidly [41,42]. In this scenario, an ancestral
35S-5S unit may have undergone a series of deletion
and mutation events in intergenic spacers, perhaps
inactivating transposon activity, while selection has
apparently acted to maintain coding regions. The
fact that functional 5S genes are linked to the non
coding 35S strand in all cases observed is also in
line with a single origin of 35S-5S repeats.
2. Concerted evolution. FISH and quantitative PCR
experiments showed that in many genomes concerted evolution has homogenised thousands of
linked units indicating that insertion of a putative
5S-carrying retroelement into IGS does not prevent
unit amplification. This may be consistent with
situation in tomato [41], Drosophila [43] and nodding onion [44] in which units bearing retroelement
insertions were observed in high copy. Classical theoretical models explained homogenisation of tandem
repeats by multiple non-homologous recombination
steps [[43] and references herein]. Computer simulations imply that homogenisation time of a tandemly
arranged sequence is a quadratic function of copy
numbers [45]. It follows that 104 copies of a typical
rDNA array homogenise within 108 years. However,
the Asteroideae subfamily is probably not older than
26-39 million yrs [9,10]. Many of its members with
contrasting rDNA arrangements (e.g. Tagetes v.
Helianthus or the previously mentioned Elachanthemum v. Artemisia) probably diverged more recently.
In addition, some species, e.g. Tagetes patula, carry

arrays of homogenised 35S-5S genes distributed
across many chromosomes suggesting extensive
interlocus recombination and/or recurrent polyploidy events. Thus, while the model based solely on
non-homologous recombination between chromatids
seems to work with yeast (mainly due to the lower
number of rDNA copies, less than 200) and may elucidate the initial phase of 35S-5S repeat expansion
(Figure 10B), an alternative model is needed to
explain such rapid turnover of thousands of rRNA
genes and their spreading across the chromosomes.
Several mechanisms including rolling cycle replication and reintegration of covalently linked circles
[46,47] have been recently proposed to mediate
homogenisation of satellite repeats in allopolyploids
[48] and may be possibly applied to the rDNA
switches as well (Figure 10C).
3. It is intriguing that we were unable to identify a
species bearing equivalent proportion of linked and

unlinked tandems, since FISH studies confirmed
homogenisation across all rDNA loci (Figure 7 and
Table 1). Either mixed genotypes are counterselected
(intermediate stages, Figure 10B) may not be evolutionarily successful or the turnover (birth and extinction) of rDNA arrays in genomes is extremely fast so
intermediate genotypes are short-lived and escape
detection. The best evidence for the latter hypothesis
is the organisation of rDNA in Elachanthemum
intricatum, an Old World Anthemideae species. In
this species, the functional rRNA genes are unlinked
[8]. However, a non-functional 5S remnant was
found in the 26S-18S IGS. Its strand orientation,
proximity to the 26S gene and flanking sequences
were similar to functional 5S-IGS copies in the closely related Artemisia species (Figure 4A). These
data suggest that a putative Elachanthemum progenitor did have linked arrangement of units that
have become eventually lost. Hypothetically, a large

Garcia et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:176
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/176

deletion of locus or a chromosome loss could have
promoted reamplification of unlinked 5S arrays and
reversion of the unlinked rDNA genotype (Figure
10C). It will be interesting to analyse Asteraceae
genomes (which are now largely unexplored) by
deep sequencing in order to reveal intermediate
stages of rDNA rearrangements, to map potentially
active retroelement loci that mobilised 5S genes, and
to determine the degree of tandem arrays homogeneity, in general.

The rDNA arrangement as a potential phylogenic tool

The intra- and interspecies divergence rates (Additional
file 3) for 26S and 5S genes were comparable (low) confirming concerted evolution of the 35S-5S units and corroborating studies in yeasts [49]. In contrast, the
sequence between the 26S and 5S genes (termed IGS1) is
not conserved and displays significant length and
sequence polymorphisms (Figure 4). The cladogram
based on these sequences showed highly supported
branches (Figure 6B) and the tree topology presented
good congruence with other phylogenetic reconstructions using different markers, as mentioned previously.
The divergence of IGS1 was significantly higher than that
of ITS1 (Additional file 3): between closely related species
e.g. Artemisia tridentata and A. absinthium, the divergence of ITS1 was ~4% (10 substitutions per 250 bp)
whereas for IGS1 the divergence was ~7% (35 substitutions per 488 bp). Thus IGS1 could be used as a suitable,
alternative marker to infer phylogenetic relationships in
taxonomically difficult taxa, e.g. Asteroideae. Besides, on
the basis of the finding of linked arrangement in Anthemideae, Gnaphalieae and “Heliantheae alliance”, maybe
phylogenetic relationships between these groups should
be reassessed, as these groups could be more closely
related than currently considered [9,21]. However, present nuclear and chloroplastic molecular phylogenies
[[11] and references therein] confirm that, though
related, these groups do not form a clade, but that
Heliantheae alliance’s sister group are tribes Athroismeae
and Inuleae, and that Anthemideae are sister to Astereae
(Figure 9). So in fact, our findings could reflect the lability of rDNA arrangements in these species.
The rearrangement of intrinsic locus structure in which
thousands of copies are lost and replaced with new
copies certainly represents a drastic genomic change with
potential phylogenetic signal. Though a dual 5S and 35S
FISH appears to be a reliable method to determine organisation of rDNA loci on chromosomes, it is somewhat
impractical for large scale sampling as ours. In addition,
the signals overlap may not necessarily mean physical
linkage but rather juxtaposition of both arrays as demonstrated in the case of Dahlia pinnata (Figure 8). The

Page 16 of 18

simple PCR methodology described in Figure 1, based on
primers amplifying 26S-5S and 5S-5S sequences, may
represent a feasible approach.

Conclusion
Family Asteraceae nowadays occupy all kinds of habitats, from hot deserts to high mountain areas. Just in
genus Artemisia there may have been 17-22 direct and
2-4 reverse migrations from Asia to America [50]. We
have shown that the unusual linked organisation of
35S-5S rDNA units occurs in three large groups of
Asteraceae family comprising species-rich genera
including abundant and economically important plants.
The units were homogenised within the loci and across
the chromosomes to several thousands of copies, with
concomitant loss of the independent 5S and 35S tandems. Given that these tribes represent a large proportion of the species richness of the family we estimate
that nearly a quarter of Asteraceae species could have
evolved a linked arrangement of rRNA genes. We can
therefore envisage that the linked rDNA arrangement in
plants may be far more common than previously
thought. Uncovering the adaptive advantages (if any) of
a linked rDNA arrangement is the next step in the
understanding of the dynamic evolution of rRNA genes
in plants.
