Abstract
Background: Mosquito saliva, consisting of a mixture of dozens of proteins affecting vertebrate
hemostasis and having sugar digestive and antimicrobial properties, helps both blood and sugar
meal feeding. Culicine and anopheline mosquitoes diverged ~150 MYA, and within the anophelines,
the New World species diverged from those of the Old World ~95 MYA. While the
sialotranscriptome (from the Greek sialo, saliva) of several species of the Cellia subgenus of
Anopheles has been described thoroughly, no detailed analysis of any New World anopheline has
been done to date. Here we present and analyze data from a comprehensive salivary gland (SG)
transcriptome of the neotropical malaria vector Anopheles darlingi (subgenus Nyssorhynchus).
Results: A total of 2,371 clones randomly selected from an adult female An. darlingi SG cDNA
library were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded 966 clusters of related
sequences, 739 of which were singletons. Primer extension experiments were performed in
selected clones to further extend sequence coverage, allowing for the identification of 183 protein
sequences, 114 of which code for putative secreted proteins.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of sialotranscriptomes of An. darlingi and An. gambiae reveals
significant divergence of salivary proteins. On average, salivary proteins are only 53% identical,
while housekeeping proteins are 86% identical between the two species. Furthermore, An. darlingi
proteins were found that match culicine but not anopheline proteins, indicating loss or rapid
evolution of these proteins in the old world Cellia subgenus. On the other hand, several well
represented salivary protein families in old world anophelines are not expressed in An. darlingi.

Background
Saliva of hematophagous arthropods contain a vast array
of compounds that disarm their hosts' hemostasis and

inflammation, thus helping to obtain a blood meal [1,2].
In the case of mosquitoes and other blood-sucking Nematocera, saliva also helps ingestion of sugar meals, in the

form of carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes [3]. Antimicrobial products, in the form of pattern recognition proteins, serine proteases, and antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs), are also routinely found in the saliva of hematophagous arthropods; these may protect the blood or
sugar meal from harmful microbial growth [2].
Detailed sialotranscriptomes of several mosquito species
[4-13] are revealing their salivary composition to include
a number of proteins of previously known families as well
as completely novel families unique to mosquitoes or
their close relatives among the hematophagous Nematocera. In particular, studies done with Culex quinquefasciatus [8], Aedes aegypti [7], and Anopheles gambiae [13], for
which the genomes are known, indicate that the mosquito
salivary cocktail consists of 60–100 secreted proteins, several of which are members of multigene families. In these
studies, Aedes-, Anopheles-, and Culex-specific proteins
were discovered. Most of the salivary proteins do not have
a known function but presumably affect hemostasis,
inflammation, and sugar digestion or have antimicrobial
activity.
Within the Anopheles genus, sialotranscriptomes were
described for An. gambiae [11-13], An. funestus [6], and An.
stephensi [9], all members of the same subgenus Cellia.
These studies allowed the discovery of species-specific
proteins and, importantly, that the salivary proteins
among members of the same subgenus are very divergent
when compared to housekeeping proteins, perhaps due to
immune pressure of their vertebrate hosts, in the case of
antihemostatic or antiinflammatory proteins, or of microbial resistance, in the case of antimicrobial products [9].
An. darlingi (subgenus Nyssorhynchus) is an important vector of human malaria in Central and South America, and,
like all non-autogenous mosquitoes, adult females absolutely require a blood meal to develop eggs, preferring
humans to other blood sources [14]. Preliminary studies
with An. darlingi salivary glands identified one salivary lysozyme [15] and a limited proteomic work identified three
additional salivary proteins [16]. Additionally, a salivary
transcriptome of An. darlingi was previously described [5],
but no protein sequences were extracted from that
expressed sequence tag (EST) set. In the present work, we
increased the An. darlingi salivary EST set from 593 to
2,371 and extracted and deposited 183 protein sequences
to GenBank, 114 of which represent putative salivary
secreted proteins (inclusive of alleles). This new set of proteins reveals novel proteins as well as protein families that
were previously found only in Culex, thus pointing to
their existence at 150 MYA, when a common ancestor
existed to culicine and anophelines [17] and that these
protein families were lost in the genus Aedes and the Cellia
anopheline subgenus. Accordingly, the complex and varied evolution of salivary proteins in mosquitoes is being

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

revealed at the same time that new protein families with
potentially novel pharmacologic activities are being discovered.

Results and Discussion
Characteristics of the assembled salivary EST set
A total of 2,371 cDNA clones were used to assemble a
database [see additional file 1] that yielded 966 clusters of
related sequences, 739 of which contained only one EST.
This dataset included the 593 sequences used in our previous work [5]. The 966 clusters were compared, using the
programs blastx, blastn, or RPS-BLAST [18], to the nonredundant (NR) protein database of the National Center of
Biological Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine, NIH, to a gene ontology database [19], to the conserved domains database of the NCBI [20], and to a
custom prepared subset of the NCBI nucleotide database
containing either mitochondrial or rRNA sequences.

Three categories of expressed genes derived from the manual annotation of the contigs (Fig. 1). The putatively
secreted (S) category contained 50% of the sequences, the
housekeeping (H) category had 34, and 16% of the ESTs
could not be classified and belong to the unknown (U)
class. The transcripts of the U class could represent novel
proteins or derive from the less conserved 3' or 5' untranslated regions of genes, as was indicated for the sialotranscriptome of An. gambiae [13].
Housekeeping (H) genes
The 797 ESTs attributed to H genes expressed in the salivary glands (SGs) of An. darlingi were further character-

ized into 19 subgroups according to function (Table 1 and
additional file 1). Transcripts associated with the protein
synthesis machinery represented 53% of all transcripts
associated with a housekeeping function, an expected
result for the secretory nature of the organ. Energy metabolism accounted for 10% of the transcripts. Twenty percent of the transcripts were classified as either 'Unknown
conserved' or 'Conserved secreted' proteins. These represent highly conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably associated with cellular function but still
uncharacterized. These sets may help functional identification of the 'Conserved hypothetical' proteins as previously reviewed in [21].
Possibly secreted (S) class of expressed genes
A total of 1,188 ESTs represent putative An. darlingi salivary components (Table 2 and Supplemental Table S1).
These include previously known gene families as well as
novel proteins. Table 2 also indicates our degree of knowledge, or ignorance, regarding these protein families, for 22
of which we have no hint for function. Many of these
putatively secreted protein families of unknown function
are multigenic, such as the SG1 and antigen-5 families, for
example. The D7/OBP-like and aegyptin/30-kDa families
contribute to 30% of all transcripts associated with
secreted products. This is in line with these proteins
accounting for the most intensely stained bands in SDS
gels of mosquito salivary homogenates [4,7-10]. The identification of 8% of the transcripts with antimicrobial
polypeptides is exceptional. Possibly this high level of
expression, when compared with previous mosquito

sialotranscriptomes, derives from the fact the An. darlingi
used in this work were captured from the field and, as
such, they could have been more exposed to pathogens
than the laboratory-reared insects used to originate other
mosquito salivary transcriptomes. Mosquito age could
have been another possible variable, as the laboratoryreared mosquitoes had their glands removed in the first
two days after emergence, while the ages of captured An.
darlingi could not be specified but were most likely older
than two days.
The salivary secretome of Anopheles darlingi
From the sequenced cDNAs, a total of 183 novel An. darlingi protein sequences was derived, 114 of which code for
putative secreted products (Table 2, Table 3, and additional file 2). Table 3 presents a summary of the secreted
subset, with links to GenBank.
Proteins with presumed or experimentally validated
function
The D7/Odorant-binding protein-like family
The first D7 protein was cloned from a cDNA library from
adult female Ae. aegypti SGs. It had an appropriately cryptic name because, at the time, it did not match other
known proteins and its function was thus unknown [22].
Additional members of this family were later described in
An. gambiae, other mosquito species, and also in sand flies
[11,23,24]. In these insects, salivary D7 proteins are
encoded by multiple genes, and short and long versions of
this protein family were recognized. The D7 protein family was then identified to be a member of the odorant-

binding protein (OBP) superfamily [25], the long versions containing two and the short versions containing
one OBP domain. Because insect OBP are known to bind
and carry lipophylic compounds such as odorants and
pheromones, the potential function of D7 proteins was
proposed to be related to binding one or more agonists of
hemostasis and thus help blood feeding [23]. This prediction was confirmed when the short D7 proteins from An.
gambiae and the carboxy terminal domain of the long D7
of Ae. aegypti were found to bind biogenic amines with
high affinity [26]. More recently, the amino terminal OBP
domain of a D7 long form of Ae. aegypti was shown to
bind peptidic leukotrienes with high affinity. The crystal
structures of a short D7 protein from An. gambiae and a
long D7 protein from Ae. aegypti revealed that the D7 OBP
domains have seven alpha helices, two more than the
canonical OBP family [27]. In addition to these inflam-

1188

matory agonist-binding functions, a short D7 protein
from An. stephensi, named hamadarin, was shown to
inhibit bradykinin formation by inhibiting the FXII/Kallikrein pathway [28].
An. gambiae has three genes coding for long D7 proteins
and five coding for the short proteins, arranged in a single
contiguous gene cassette in chromosome 3R [13]. We will
refer below to these proteins from An. gambiae by the transcriptional order that their genes appear in chromosome
3R. Twelve An. darlingi proteins exhibiting sequence similarity to proteins from the D7 family were identified
(Table 2 and Supplemental Table S2). These include five
pairs that are more than 95% identical to each other and
are probably alleles. Accordingly, at least six unique products from the D7 family are identifiable in the An. darlingi
salivary transcriptome. The alignment and phylogram of

homologues of An. gambiae short proteins 2 and 3 are
identifiable (indicated as s2/s3 homologue in Fig. 2B), as
well as the ortholog of the fifth short protein of An. gambiae; and iii) AD-118 represents an An. darlingi long D7
protein that is related to An. gambiae long D7 proteins 1
and 2.
AD-1 and AD-3, which possibly derive from a polymorphic gene, are similar to the D7s2 and D7s3 of An. gambiae. These proteins have in common a similar size as well
as being the most transcribed D7 proteins in both species
[13]. AD-1 and AD-3, but not the other An. darlingi D7
sequences, share an amino acid (aa) pattern, included in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

a cysteine framework, that are known from crystal structure to make contact with biogenic amines [27,29]. The
high transcription of these gene products is in line with
the large amounts of protein needed to scavenge biogenic
amines that accumulate to the order of one micromolar in
the host tissues [26], suggesting these An. darlingi proteins, likewise their An. gambiae homologues, function as
biogenic amine scavengers.
D7s1 from An. gambiae, the homologue of An. stephensi
hamadarin [28] has an alkaline pI of 9.22, contrasting
with the neutral or acidic pI of the remaining short D7
proteins. To the extent this basic pI is associated with
hamadarin function, it is worth noting that AD-81 and
AD-31 (Fig. 2) also have pIs above 8.5, but not the more
distantly related AD-97. These three An. darlingi proteins
are members of the novel short AD clade (Fig. 2B), which
shares the same tree branch where D7s1 from An. gambiae
are located, suggesting they could have a similar function
as hamadarin.
The 30-kDa antigen/GE-rich/aegyptin family
This protein family, found exclusively in the SGs of adult
female mosquitoes, was first identified as a salivary antigen in Ae. aegypti [30] and later found in salivary transcriptomes and proteomes of both culicine and anopheline
mosquitoes [4,6-9,13,31,32], where it was named GE-rich
protein. Proteomic work also indicated that this is one of
the most abundant proteins in the SGs of mosquitoes. Its
gene promoter has been used to specifically drive abundant gene expression in the SGs of transgenic mosquitoes
[33]. More recently, proteins of this family from Aedes and
Anopheles were shown to prevent platelet aggregation by
collagen [34,35], indicating conservation of function after
the split of the Culicidae into the culicines and anophelines, ~150 MYA [17].

sequence names start with D7 followed by s or L for short
and long forms; the number following s or L represents the
order of the gene in the D7 chromosomal region, following
its transcription direction. The An. darlingi sequences start
with AD, followed by a number derived from the cluster
number, as determined in Supplemental Table S1. For more
details, see text.

Analysis of the sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi allowed
the identification of 8 protein sequences from this family,
all represented by 2–17 ESTs found in the library. These
protein sequences most probably reflect alleles from a single polymorphic gene, as they all share at least 95% identity [36]. This degree of polymorphism is paralleled in the
An. darlingi D7 proteins but is greater than that determined in sialotranscriptomes of other mosquitoes. Possibly this high degree of sequence variability reflects our
material deriving from field-caught insects, whereas previous sialotranscriptomes were made with more genetically
uniform mosquito colonies.
Alignment of all known members of this family, excluding those that are more than 95% identical and of the
same species, shows their structure clearly to be dominated by three domains [34]: the signal secretion peptide,
a Gly/Glu-rich region, and a more conserved and organ-

ized region where the block T-x(29,30)-Q-x(5)-Px(13,15)-I-x(2)-C-F-x(20)-C-x(8,10)-C-x(19,21)-C can be
identified (Fig. 3A). This block was used by the seedtop
program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/staff/tao/URLAPI/
seedtop.html to search over 6 million sequences of the NR
database, only retrieving mosquito proteins. The phylogram (Fig. 3B) obtained from the alignment produces
strong bootstrap support for three genus-specific clades,
containing three genes for Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti,
two for Culex quinquefasciatus, and one for each anopheline, An. stephensi, An. funestus, An. gambiae, An. darlingi,
An. albimanus, and An. dirus. The An. darlingi protein
groups, as expected, with An. albimanus, another American
species from the Nyssorhynchus subgenus. Near the
amino terminal of the mature sequences, the Nyssorhynchus-derived 30-kDa antigen/GE-rich sequences have an
RGD motif as pointed out before for the An. albimanus
sequence [32]; this triad is not found in similar proteins
of other mosquitoes. RGD-containing peptides are commonly found in snake venoms [37] and tick saliva [38],
and the motif itself is usually found surrounded by two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

relatively close Cys groups that allow the RGD to be at the
edge of a loop. This conformational feature permits the aa
of the RDG motif to interact with integrins, disrupting
platelet aggregation [39]. It is unknown, however,
whether the RGD domain present in the 30-kDa antigen/
GE-rich proteins of Nyssorhynchus mosquitoes is structurally capable of interacting with integrins.
Anophelin antithrombin
The salivary anticlotting agent of An. albimanus, named
anophelin, was previously characterized as a short acidic
peptide with strong thrombin inhibitory activity [40,41].
Despite extensive sequencing of the salivary transcriptomes of many hematophagous arthropods, similar
sequences are found only in sialotranscriptomes of
anopheline mosquitoes. Two similar An. darlingi cDNAs,
probably corresponding to alleles of a single gene, were
identified. Conceptual translation of the gene results in
acidic peptides of 6.3 kDa and pI of 3.9, which are 86%
identical to An. albimanus anophelin [42].
gSG7/Anophensin
The gSG7 family is also unique to anophelines. In An.
gambiae, it has two genes coding for gSG7 and gSG72,
both of which are highly enriched in female SGs [13].
More recently, the An. stephensi homologue was determined to inhibit kallikrein and production of bradykinin,
a pain-producing substance [43]. Four putative alleles representing the homologue(s) of gSG7/Anophensin in An.
darlingi were identified. These An. darlingi SG transcripts,
though, have no more than 45% identity to the An. gambiae gSG7 and An. stephensi anophensin [44].

details, see text.

Kazal domain-containing peptides
The Kazal domain is ubiquitously found in proteins of
metazoan organisms and, accordingly, peptides containing this domain have been identified in studies of
sialotranscriptomes and proteomes of tabanids [45,46],
triatomine bugs [47,48], Culicoides sonorensis [49], and
mosquitoes [4,7,8]. In Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the
transcripts encoding Kazal domain proteins were ubiquitously expressed in all major organs analyzed, suggesting
their function was not specific to blood feeding [4,7].
Kazal domain peptides have also been isolated and biochemically characterized from the midgut of triatomines,
where they act as anticlotting agents [50-52], and from
leech saliva, where they inhibit mast cell tryptase and plasmin [53-55]. Midgut transcriptomes of sand flies have
also uncovered transcription of genes encoding peptides
of this class [56,57]. In addition to their classical function
as protease inhibitors, Kazal domain-containing peptides
were identified as the salivary vasodilator of the horse flies
Hybomitra bimaculata and Tabanus yao [45,46]. In An. darlingi, transcripts coding for three peptides with Kazal
domain were found, yielding predicted mature MW of

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:57

7.2–8.1 kDa and basic pI (8.3–9.4). AD-417 and AD-257
best match An. gambiae peptides when subjected to blastp
against the NR database, albeit at only 45% [58] and 44%
identity [59]. AD-350 best matches Aedes and Culex peptides at 47% and 51% identity [60]. The function of these
salivary peptides in mosquitoes remains to be discovered.
Mucins and Peritrophins
Serine- and threonine-rich proteins are commonly found
in sialotranscriptomes. These proteins are generally modified post translationally, and their mature forms have Nacetyl galactosamine residues, typical of mucins [61].
They probably have a function to lubricate the food canals
and may also have antimicrobial function. Several protein
families are represented in this group, including those previously described as SG3, gSG10, and 13.5-kDa families.
Peritrophins are proteins with a chitin-binding domain
that are often found in sialotranscriptomes and may be
related to the maintenance of the structure of the mouthparts and/or salivary canal.

The SG3 family in An. darlingi is highly expressed, four
proteins of which account for 90 ESTs found in the cDNA
library. They may be alleles or splice variants of a single
gene [62], containing 29% to 32% Ser + Thr and over 47
predicted galactosylation sites in a mature 17-kDa protein
framework [63]. The An. darlingi SG3 has similarities only
to other anopheline salivary proteins, having only 46%
identity and 56% similarity to the closest relative, from
An. funestus [64]. Compared to the Old World anophelines, the An. darlingi SG3 has a long GH repeat, which
may confer zinc chelation capability and hence a putative
antimicrobial activity for these proteins, because zinc chelation is characteristic of histidine rich antimicrobial
agents that act by sequestration of this essential microbial
growth factor [65-67].
The gSG10 family, containing three peptides (Supplemental Table S2), is represented by mature products with MW
of 18 kDa, 22% to 23% Ser + Thr, and 15–20 predicted
galactosylation sites [68]. They also may be products of a
single polymorphic and/or differentially spliced gene
[69]. An. darlingi gSG10 members match both anopheline
and culicine sequences of salivary origin [70], having a
unique signature block [71]that characterizes these distinctive mosquito proteins.
The 13.5-kDa protein family is also represented in An. darlingi by the products of two or three genes [72]. Most mosquito 13.5-kDa family members have over 30 predicted
galactosylation sites [73]. An. funestus, An. gambiae, and
An. stephensi have recognizable relatives; however those
proteins show only 41% to 44% identity over most of the
length of the protein to the An. darlingi 13.5-kDa products. Culicine proteins that display only conservation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

the stretch of threonine residues have been identified, but
they may not be true homologues.
Two other putative mucins were found, AD-11 being a
hypothetical secreted peptide of predicted mature MW of
3.8 kDa, 25% Ser + Thr, and ten potential glycosylation
sites. No significant matches are found with other known
proteins. AD-91, on the other hand, with 20% Ser + Thr
content and 20 potential O-glycosylation sites, is 71%
identical to an An. gambiae protein [74] that is related to a
previously identified Aedes salivary protein and to a Drosophila protein annotated in the Gene Ontology database
as associated with defense response to virus [75].
A single transcript in the An. darlingi sialotranscriptome
codes for a peritrophin with a typical chitin-binding
domain [76] and 69% sequence identity to an An. gambiae
protein annotated as peritrophin A [77], which was
cloned from the mosquito midgut [78].
The SG3, SG10, and 13.5-kDa families were found abundantly expressed in sialotranscriptomes of adult male An.
gambiae [78], indicating their function is likely not related
specifically to blood feeding.
Enzymes
Enzymes associated with both blood (apyrase and peroxidase) and sugar (amylase and maltase) feeding are
known to occur in mosquito saliva; accordingly, their corresponding transcripts have been found in mosquito
sialotranscriptomes. Serine protease-encoding transcripts
also are regularly found, but their proposed functions in
helping blood feeding by interacting with host proteins or
as participants in immune proteolytic cascades have not
been validated.

Apyrase, which hydrolyses ATP and ADP to AMP and
orthophosphates, has been a ubiquitous finding in the
saliva of blood-sucking arthropods, where it destroys
these important agonists of inflammation and platelet
aggregation [2,79]. Mosquitoes have co-opted the 5'
nucleotidase family to achieve this function [80-82]. Two
genes of this family are expressed in the SGs of An. gambiae [13], named putative 5' nucleotidase and salivary apyrase, although both may function redundantly as
apyrases. The sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi presents
evidence for the two orthologues, IS07-44, a full-length
orthologue of the salivary 5' nucleotidase of An. gambiae
[83], to which it is 66% identical, and AD-101, which is a
5' truncated clone best matching the An. gambiae salivary
apyrase [84].
A peroxidase was previously identified as the vasodilator
for norepinephrine-induced aortic contractions found in
An. albimanus SGs [85,86]. AD-573 encodes the full-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:57

length sequence of an An. darlingi salivary peroxidase that
is 86% identical to An. albimanus and 52% identical to An.
gambiae salivary peroxidases [87]. This type of salivary
vasodilator is so far unique to anopheline mosquitoes.
Maltase and amylases, as well as their transcripts, have
been regularly found in the saliva and sialotranscriptomes
of mosquitoes [88-91]. The first cloned gene from the SGs
of any mosquito was actually a member of this family
[92]. Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae express both genes in
their SGs. Transcripts coding for both enzymes were
found in the sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi [see additional file 1]. The full-length sequence for the orthologue
of An. gambiae salivary maltase (68% identity) [93] is presented in Supplemental Table S2.
Transcripts coding for at least two different serine proteases were found in An. darlingi sialotranscriptome [see
additional file 1]. Supplemental Table S2 presents a truncated sequence of a CLIP domain serine protease
expressed in An. darlingi SGs, 86% identical to the An.
gambiae closest match [94].
Immunity-related products
Antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and pathogen pattern
recognition polypeptides are commonly found in the
sialotranscriptome of blood-sucking arthropods. Among
the AMPs found in the sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi,
a gambicin [95], a defensin [96], and three different
cecropins [97] are described in their full-length condition.
A peptidoglycan recognition protein, 94% identical to an
An. gambiae protein [98], is also reported as a full-length
protein. Additionally, this study [see additional file 1]
provides evidence for An. darlingi transcripts coding for Ctype lectins and ficolins, and an odd transcript having a
full PMEI Pfam domain [99] normally found in plant proteins associated with inhibition of microbial pathogens'
pectin methyl esterase. Two similar lysozyme cDNAs,
probably products of alleles, are also described as fulllength polypeptides, matching 57% identity to the closest
An. gambiae protein [100]. Another identified lysozyme,
contig 443 [101], corresponds to a previously described
salivary An. darlingi lysozyme [15]. The occurrence of multiple lysozymes in the An. darlingi sialome is not surprising, as two lysozymes are expressed in the An. gambiae SGs
[13].

With less certainty, we include in the immunity-related
products the full-length sequence for a Gly-His-rich peptide that might have antimicrobial function by zinc chelation, as explained above. This protein matches a C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

quinquefasciatus salivary peptide that also contains Gly
repeats and a poly His in the amino terminus [102].
Secreted proteins with unknown function
Promiscuous antigen 5 (AG5) family
This is a ubiquitous protein family found in animals and
plants [103] and in all sialotranscriptomes of blood-sucking Diptera analyzed so far. The function of these proteins
in mosquito saliva is not known, although they were
implicated in a proteolytic function in the venom of the
marine snail Conus textile [104], in toxic functions in the
saliva of a venomous lizard and snake venoms [105-109],
and in an antifungal function in plants [110]. Remarkably, a member of this family acquired a typical RGD
domain surrounded by Cys residues and acts as a main
platelet aggregation inhibitor in the horsefly Tabanus yao
[46]. Several genes from the AG5 family are transcribed in
the SGs of mosquitoes, including some specific to the
adult females and thus possibly associated with a specific
function in blood feeding [4,7,13]. We present evidence,
in the form of full-length transcripts, for the expression of
at least two members of the AG5 family in An. darlingi SGs
[111]. AD-38 matches with 67% identity the putative
gVAG protein precursor of An. gambiae [112], a transcript
enriched in the adult female SGs when compared with
expression in other tissues [13]. AD-430 matches An. gambiae AG5-related 2 protein [113], which was shown to be
ubiquitously expressed in adult female tissues [13]. The
function(s) of this protein family in mosquitoes remain to
be determined.
Mosquito-specific gSG5 family
Transcripts coding for the gSG5 protein [114] were first
discovered in the SGs of An. gambiae and shown to be
exclusively expressed in the adult female SGs [13,115].
This protein produces weak similarity to a salivary protein
of Ae. aegypti [116] and better similarity to other Aedes
[117] and Culex proteins [118], indicating this is a mosquito-specific protein. Six transcripts coding for this protein were found in the sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi.
AD-196 is 46% identical to the An. gambiae orthologue
and only 26% and 23% identical to the culicine proteins
[119]. The function of this mosquito-specific protein
remains unknown, but its tissue- and sex-specific expression profile suggests it is possibly related to blood feeding.
Mosquito-specific gSG8 family
The gSG8 is a highly divergent family, with members only
from An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti [120]. Alignment of the
three sequences displays a conserved motif L-C-W-A-x-Kx(2)-P-T-A-x(6)-C-x(5)-K, which might help identify new
members of this family. In An. gambiae, this protein is spe-

cifically expressed in female SGs [115], suggesting a likely
role in blood feeding.

mosquito phylogeny. Ae. aegypti transcripts coding for the
basic tail peptide were enriched in adult female SGs [7].

Mosquito-specific basic tail family
AD-216 and AD-217 represents two similar proteins
deducted from two and three ESTs, respectively. They may
represent splicing variants or alleles of the same gene
[121]. The predicted mature peptides have 11.2 kDa and
solely match proteins found in other mosquito sialotranscriptomes or other hypothetical mosquito proteins
[122]. The basic tail name derives from a conserved Lys-XX-Lys or Lys-X-X-Arg found in the carboxyterminus of proteins derived from the genus Aedes but lacking in the
anopheline sequences. The alignment indicates a conserved backbone and the absence of cysteine residues,
from where the block pattern L-x-H-x-L-x-Y-L-x-Dx(17,18)-A-x(2)-Y-x(3)-A-x(3)-G can be deduced (Fig.
4A). The derived phylogram (Fig. 4B) follows the expected

Mosquito-specific 4.3-kDa family
AD-476 represents the peptide sequence of a mature protein of 4.1 kDa having significant similarities only to other
polypeptides found previously in culicine mosquito
sialotranscriptomes or predicted proteomes of mosquitoes [123]. This is the first time a protein of this family is
found in an anopheline sialotranscriptome. Alignment
and phylogram of the mature predicted peptides shows
that Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus have two such peptides, those of Anopheles matching the slightly smaller version (Fig. 5A). The derived phylogram indicates two
clades grouping the short and the large forms. In Ae.
aegypti, transcripts coding for a member of this family
were shown to be enriched in the adult female SGs [7].

Culicine proline-rich secreted protein
The sialotranscriptome of Ae. aegypti identified a protein
named proline-rich salivary secreted peptide [124], close
homologues of which were never found in other
sialotranscriptomes. Transcripts for this protein were
found exclusively on the adult female SGs of Ae. aegypti,
indicating a function related to acquisition of the blood
meal [7]. The sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi provided
three ESTs, which when assembled derive the sequence
AD-267, matching this Aedes protein at 47% identity
[125] and also, weakly, a smaller region of a salivary protein from An. stephensi of the same size. AD-267 was subjected to psiblast analysis against the NR database
retrievieng only sequences from Ae. aegypti, which converged after two iterations. The presence of AD-267 in An.
darlingi, its homology to the Ae. aegypti protein, and its

absence in An. gambiae suggest that the gene for this family existed in the ancestor of culicines and anophelines but
was lost or modified beyond recognition in Culex and the
Cellia subgenus of Anopheles.
Culicine 41.9-kDa family
The first 41.9-kDa family member was characterized in
sialotranscriptome of Ae. aegypti and later found in C.
quinquefasciatus and in Ae. albopictus [4,7,8,10]. It has
never been found in any anopheline sialotranscriptome,
nor does it have any similar protein predicted from the
An. gambiae genome [126]. AD-114, however, produces
similarities to 41.9-kDa family members when subjected
to blastp analysis against the NR database [127]. The blast
results interestingly retrieves other salivary proteins from
hematophagous Diptera from the NR database, such as

gSG10, gSG9, and other mucins, despite having itself only
three potential galactosylation sites. The alignment of the
An. darlingi protein with the 41.9-kDa proteins from Ae.
aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus shows extensive similarities
over the whole length of the sequences, including a conserved cysteine framework, despite having less than 30%
identity with the culicine proteins (Fig. 6). AD-114 thus
appear to be a "missing link" joining previously thought
unrelated salivary protein families from Culicines and
Anophelines. To further investigate this possibility, we
used psiblast to search AD-114 against the NR database,
retrieving mostly proteins found before in sialotranscriptomes of blood-sucking Diptera [128], including Culicoides [49] and sand flies [129,130]. In addition to the
known 41.9-kDa members from culicines, the anopheline
proteins annotated as gSG10 and gSG9 are also retrieved,
as are a group of proteins annotated as salivary mucins
from mosquitoes, including the non-bloodfeeding species
Toxorhynchites amboinensis [131]. Exceptionally, two bacterial proteins are retrieved, as well as one from the wasp
Nasonia vitripennis. The alignment of the proteins from
Diptera plus the two bacterial proteins by the Clustal tool
does not reveal any region of common conservation
among all proteins (not shown), but the derived bootstrapped phylogram (Fig. 7) is informative. Strong support is obtained for four clades, as indicated in Figure 7.
The first clade includes sequences from both anopheline
and culicine mosquitoes annotated as gSG10, gSG9, and
mucins, together with the An. darlingi sequence. A second
clade includes Culex and Aedes proteins annotated as
mucins. This second clade roots with strong bootstrap
support to the previous clade. A third clade includes Aedes

proteins annotated as 41-kDa protein, or a short version,
annotated as 30.3-kDa protein. This clade also roots
strongly with the two previous clades. The sole C. quinquefasciatus sequence shown in Figure 7 (gi|170045863), the
41.9-kDa basic salivary protein, does not group significantly with any other sequence. Finally, a fourth clade
groups together the bacterial and sand fly proteins. This
clade does not root with strong bootstrap support to the
previous clades. The presence of the bacterial proteins in
this clade is puzzling, and suggests that the Nematocera
proteins could have derived from bacterial contaminants.
However, the proteins deriving from Ae. aegypti, C. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae map to assembled chromosomes or supercontigs, and their respective genes contain
introns indicating they are of eukaryotic origin. Together,
these results support the argument that the 41.9-kDa protein family of mosquitoes has a common salivary ancestor
before the split of anophelines and culicines, being recognized in An. darlingi by AD-114; in the Cellia subgenus,
the 41.9-kDa protein family has evolved to produce
shorter proteins, the subfamily members of the gSG10
and gSG9 families. Sand flies express related salivary proteins that might have been acquired by convergent evolution or share a distant common ancestor that can no
longer be recognized with the available sequences.
Anopheline-specific SG1 family
Six genes coding for proteins of this unique protein family
were found in An. gambiae salivary transcriptomes
[11,12,115], four of which are located as a contiguous
gene cluster [132] in chromosome X [13]. Remarkably, all
these genes are uniexonic, unusual for eukaryotic genes

coding for these relatively large proteins, attaining a
mature molecular weight above 40 kDa, suggesting its
acquisition as horizontal transfer. This gene family
appears to be specifically associated with SG function. The
transcripts coding for the Trio, SG1, and SG1b proteins
appears to be exclusively expressed in the female SGs,
while SG1-like3 and gSG1-2 and gSG1a are enriched in
the female glands but also present in lower amounts in
male glands and not observed in other tissues [13]. When
these proteins were subjected to blastp against the NR
database, only other anopheline sequences are retrieved.
Sixty-three ESTs were found in the An. darlingi sialotranscriptome coding for proteins of this family, from which
six full-length clones were sequenced. Of these six
sequences, two possibly derive from alleles or splice variants [133]. When full-length protein sequences from all
known members of this family are aligned by the Clustal
tool, very few conserved aa are identified (Fig. 8A); how-

ever, the deduced phylogram show strong bootstrap support for five clades (Fig. 8B), named for the An. gambiae
proteins, as follows: Clade SG1/SG1a contains these two
proteins from An. gambiae and also one sequence each
from An. stephensi, An. dirus, and An. darlingi. Clade SG1like3 contains two sequences from An. darlingi that could
be the result of a recent gene duplication or polymorphism and splice variation [134]. These two sequences
cluster with strong bootstrap support, as expected, with
the sole sequence from An. albimanus. The Trio clade also
has AD-153 from An. darlingi. The clade SG1-2 is the only
clade not having An. darlingi representatives. The function
of these proteins remains to be determined.
Anopheline-specific SG2 family
The SG2 protein was deduced from salivary An. gambiae
cDNAs and shown to be expressed in female glands and
adult males but not in other tissues [11]. It derives from a

single gene in chromosome 2L and is abundantly transcribed in sialotranscriptomes of male An. gambiae [135].
Related, but very divergent, sequences were obtained
solely from salivary transcriptomes of other anopheline
species [6]. The sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi indicates that at least two different genes exist coding for proteins of this family. One gene codes for mature proteins of
8.5 kDa, from which four alleles or splice variants are
derived [136]. A second gene may have produced another
five different alleles or splice variants coding for shorter
(5.6- to 6.1-kDa) peptides [137], but it is more likely that
these derive from two closely related genes. Comparison
of these proteins with other anopheline sequences displays sequence identities varying from only 26% [138]to
31% [139]. Because this protein family is expressed in
both male and female An. gambiae [11,135], and due to its
relatively small size, it may display antimicrobial function.
Anopheline-specific hyp 15/hyp 17 family
The hyp 15 and hyp 17 proteins, previously identified in
sialotranscriptomes of An. gambiae [12], have alkaline pI
and ~4.7 kDa. Their genes reside as tandem repeat in chromosome X and are preferentially expressed in adult
female SGs [13]. Homologues were additionally found in
An. stephensi and An. funestus. The An. darlingi sialotranscriptome presents evidence of three transcripts that may
derive from splice variants from a single gene [140], which
are 41% and 39% identical to the An. funestus and An.
gambiae homologue [141].
Anopheline-specific hyp 8.2/hyp 6.2 family
In An. gambiae, the genes coding for the hyp 8.2 and hyp
6.2 proteins are found as a tandem repeat in chromosome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

arm 2L. These proteins have mature molecular weight of
6–9 kDa, do not have sequence similarity, and are
grouped together solely by virtue of being chromosomal
neighbours. Transcripts coding for these two polypeptides
are similarly enriched in An. gambiae adult female SGs
[13]. An. stephensi and An. funestus also have members of
these protein families. In An. darlingi, two quite divergent
protein sequences [142] deduced from the sialotranscriptome are similar to hyp 8.2 [143], and one is similar to
hyp 6.2 [144].
Anopheline-specific hyp 5.6 family
An. darlingi protein AD-269 has a predicted molecular
weight of 6.5 kDa and matches [145] the carboxyterminus
of a salivary peptide named hyp 5.6 previously described
in An. gambiae sialotranscriptome [13]. Members of this
family have not been found previously in other sialomes.
In An. gambiae the transcript coding for hyp 5.6 was ubiquitously transcribed, suggesting a housekeeping or antimicrobial role.
Anopheles 2WIRRP salivary hypothetical protein
A protein cryptically named hypothetical protein was previously identified in a cDNA library of An. gambiae [115],
but homologues were never found in other sialotranscriptomes of either anopheline or culicine mosquitoes. This
An. gambiae protein produces matches to other unrelated
sequences in the NR database by virtue of repeated acidic
amino acids. The sialotranscriptome of An. darlingi produced 60 transcripts matching this An. gambiae protein,
distributed into six putative protein sequences deriving
from possibly two genes [146], of which AD-18 represents
a shorter form of the family (Fig. 9). The five remaining
deduced sequences may result from alleles [147]. These

proteins have predicted mature molecular weight of 14–
17 kDa and pI of 4.2. They are 41% [148] to 50% identical
[149] to the An. gambiae homologue. Alignment of two of
the An. darlingi sequences with the An. gambiae homologue identifies a region of Ser [Asp/Glu] [Asp-Glu]
repeats (identified with a bar labelled I in Fig. 9) and a
region of two repeats WIRRP in the An. gambiae sequence
(identified with a bar labelled II in Fig. 9), which provides
a name for the family.
An. darlingi salivary-secreted orphan proteins
Two An. darlingi protein sequences, never before evidenced in mosquito sialotranscriptomes, are described
here with clear signal peptide indicative of a secretion.
These are AD-136, which significantly matches only hypothetical proteins of An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus [150], and AD-119, which has no significant
matches to any known protein in the NR database. Seven
and 15 transcripts were found coding for each protein,
respectively. AD-136 has an allele [151], AD-138, derived
from two transcripts.
An. darlingi salivary absentee proteins
In a previous sialotranscriptome analysis of An. gambiae,
92 transcripts from a total of 4,066 [13] coded for a protein named gSG6 [115], orthologues of which were found
in An. stephensi and An. funestus sialotranscriptomes [152].
Considering that we have sequenced in the present work
2,371 ESTs from An. darlingi, some 53 ESTs would have
been expected for this protein. None were found, suggesting this family to be specific for the Cellia subgenus. Similarly, the related An. gambiae proteins named hyp 10 and
hyp 12 [153] had 37 and 12 corresponding ESTs, but
none were found in the An. darlingi cDNA library, also
suggesting this family to be Cellia-specific.
Comparison of protein sequence identities between An.
darlingi and An. gambiae gene products
Seventy-seven deduced protein sequences coding for
putative housekeeping (H) products are presented in Supplemental Table S2. These proteins allow comparison of
the evolutionary rate of the S proteins compared with that
of the H proteins, using the An. gambiae proteome as a reference set as done before for comparing An. stephensi salivary proteins with those of An. gambiae [9]. For this
comparison, we used only protein sequences from An.
darlingi that had at least 100 aa of alignment to an An.
gambiae protein, as identified by blastp with the filter for
low complexity set to off. The protein identity in the two
groups, 86% for the H and 53% for the S group, were significantly different (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney rank sum
test) (Table 4), supporting the concept that the evolution
of mosquito salivary-secreted proteins occurs at a faster
pace than housekeeping proteins.

Conclusion
Anophelines diverged from culicine mosquitoes approximately 150 MYA [17]. Within anophelines, the new world
species diverged from the old world forms concomitantly
or before the breakup of Gondwanaland, at ~95 MYA
[154]. Within the anophelines, detailed sialotranscriptome analyses have been made only from members of the
Cellia subgenus (An. gambiae, An. stephensi, and An. funestus). In addition, detailed sialotranscriptomes and proteome data are available for three culicines, Ae. aegypti, Ae.
albopictus, and C. quinquefasciatus, and one mosquito of
the subfamily Toxorhynchitinae, T. amboinensis. The insertion of a neotropical anopheline (subgenus Nyssorhyncus) fills a gap of information and helps to explain
mosquito evolution with regard to adaptation to blood
feeding through their salivary proteins.
From a conservative perspective, the sialotranscriptome of
An. darlingi confirms the presence of ubiquitous salivary
mosquito protein families, such as the D7, 30-kDa antigen/aegyptin, mucins, AG5, gSG5, gSG8, basic tail, the
enzymes apyrase/5' nucleotidase and amylase/maltase,
and the immunity-related proteins lysozyme, defensin,
cecropin, and Gly-His-rich peptides; most of these proteins are uniquely found in mosquitoes. From another
standpoint, the An. darlingi sialotranscriptome has confirmed the presence of proteins so far known exclusively
in anopheline mosquitoes, such as the antithrombin
anophelin, the SG1, SG2, hyp 15/hyp 17, hyp 8.2/hyp
6.2, hyp 5.6, 2WIRRP. In the last two cases, the 2WIRRP
and hyp 5.6, the An. darlingi sequences represent the second member of the family previously discovered in An.
gambiae but never before found in other anophelines.
Of interest, the An. darlingi sialotranscriptome also produced protein sequences with similarity to polypeptides
previously found exclusively in culicine sialotranscriptomes, such as the proline-rich secreted protein, Kazal
domain-containing peptides, and the 41.9-kDa family.
Psiblast analysis of the An. darlingi sequence member of
the 41.9-kDa family allowed identification of related Cellia anopheline sequences members previously known as
gSG10 and gSG9, indicating these two families may have
evolved quite rapidly from 41.9-kDa ancestors that are
now absent not only in the An. gambiae known sialotranscriptome, but also from any predicted protein from this
mosquito genome (Fig. 7). On the other hand, An. darlingi
lacks transcripts coding for proteins abundantly transcribed in An. gambiae and other Cellia mosquitoes, indicating the loss – or evolution beyond recognition – of
these protein families in An. darlingi evolution.
Finally, the rapid divergence of salivary proteins allows
the possibility of using such An. darlingi proteins as specific markers of vector exposure, as is now being

attempted for An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti [155-158].
Additionally, to the extent that the rapid divergence of the
salivary proteins is not associated with divergence of function, the differences between orthologous salivary proteins between An. gambiae and An darlingi, and also
among anophelines of the different subfamilies, represents a natural site-directed mutagenesis experiment that
will help identify structural determinants of function in
such bioactive proteins [159-161].

Methods
Mosquitoes and cDNA library construction
The sequences utilized in this study originated from the
same cDNA library used in our previous publication [5].
This cDNA library was derived from SGs dissected from
adult female An. darlingi of unknown ages that were field
caught in Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil. PolyA+ RNA was
extracted from 60 dissected pairs of SGs using the MicroFastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), which was
then used to make a PCR-based cDNA library using the

SMART™ cDNA library construction kit (BD BiosciencesClontech) as described before [10].
cDNA sequencing
The SG cDNA library was plated on LB/MgSO4 plates containing X gal/IPTG to an average of 250 plaques per 150mm Petri plate. Recombinant (white) plaques were randomly selected and transferred to 96-well Microtest™ Ubottom plates (BD BioSciences) containing 100 μl of SM
buffer (0.1 M NaCl; 0.01 M MgSO4; 7 H2O; 0.035 M Tris
HCl [pH 7.5]; 0.01% gelatin) per well. The plates were
covered and placed on a gyrating shaker for 30 min at
room temperature. The phage suspension was either
immediately used for PCR or stored at 4°C for future use.

To amplify the cDNA using a PCR reaction, 4 μl of the
phage sample was used as a template. The primers were
sequences from the λ TriplEx2 vector and named pTEx2

(5' ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG CGA ATT GGC 3'), posi-

tioned at the 5' end and the 3' end of the cDNA insert,
respectively. The reaction was carried out in 96-well flexible PCR plates (Applied Biosystems) using FastStart Taq
polymerase (Roche) on a GeneAmp® PCR system 9700
(Perkin Elmer Corp.). The PCR conditions were: one hold
of 95°C for 3 min; 25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 61°C for
30 sec; 72°C for 5 min. The amplified products were analysed on a 1.5% agarose/EtBr gel. cDNA library clones
were PCR amplified, and those showing a single band
were selected for sequencing. Approximately 200–250 ng
of each PCR product was transferred to ThermoFast 96well PCR plates (ABgene Corp.) and frozen at -20°C
before cycle sequencing using an ABI3730XL machine.
The obtained sequences were submitted to DBEST and
have the GenBank accession numbers FK703778–
FK705605.
Primer extension experiments on selected clones
These were performed using sequencing primers designed
by the Primer3 program [162], aimed at a region ~100 bp
upstream (5') of the end of the previously obtained
sequence information of high quality. The process was
repeated until full length information was obtained. The
primer extension sequences were submitted to DBEST and
have the accession numbers FL688077–FL688134. The
sequences representing the open reading frames shown in
supplemental table 2 have been deposited to GenBank
and have the accession numbers EU934251–EU934432.
Bioinformatic tools and procedures
ESTs were trimmed of primer and vector sequences. The
BLAST suite of programs [18], CAP3 assembler [163] and
ClustalW [164] software were used to compare, assemble,
and align sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis
and statistical neighbour-joining (NJ) bootstrap tests of
the phylogenies were done with the Mega package [165].
For functional annotation of the transcripts we used blastx
[18] to compare the nucleotide sequences with the NR
protein database of the NCBI and to the Gene Ontology
(GO) database [19]. The program reverse position-specific
BLAST (RPS-BLAST) [18] was used to search for conserved
protein domains in the Pfam [166], SMART [167], Kog
[168], and conserved domains databases (CDD) [20]. We
have also compared the transcripts with other subsets of
mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI and to several organism proteomes
downloaded from NCBI, ENSEMBL, or VectorBase. Segments of the three-frame translations of the EST (because
the libraries were unidirectional, six-frame translations
were not used) starting with a methionine found in the
first 300 predicted aa, or the predicted protein translation
in the case of complete coding sequences, were submitted
to the SignalP server [169] to help identify translation
products that could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on
the proteins were predicted with the program NetOGlyc

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/57

[170]. Functional annotation of the transcripts was based
on all the comparisons above. Following inspection of all
these results, transcripts were classified as either secretory
(S), housekeeping (H) or of unknown (U) function, with
further subdivisions based on function and/or protein
families.
