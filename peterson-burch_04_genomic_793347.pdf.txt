Background: Retrotransposons are an abundant component of eukaryotic genomes. The high
quality of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence makes it possible to comprehensively
characterize retroelement populations and explore factors that contribute to their genomic
distribution.

Endogenous retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (collectively called retroelements) generally
comprise a significant portion of higher eukaryotic genomes.

Dismissed as parasitic or 'junk' DNA, these sequences have
traditionally received less attention than sequences contributing to the functional capacity of the organism. This perspective has changed with the completion of several eukaryotic

Conclusions: The non-uniform genomic distribution of the Pseudoviridae and the Metaviridae can
be explained by a variety of factors including target-site bias, selection against integration into
euchromatin and pericentromeric accumulation of elements as a result of suppression of
recombination. However, comparisons based on the age of elements and their chromosomal
location indicate that integration-site specificity is likely to be the primary factor determining
distribution of the Athila and Tat sublineages of the Metaviridae. We predict that, like retroelements
in yeast, the Athila and Tat elements target integration to pericentromeric regions by recognizing a
specific feature of pericentromeric heterochromatin.

refereed research

Results: We identified the full complement of A. thaliana long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements
using RetroMap, a software tool that iteratively searches genome sequences for reverse
transcriptases and then defines retroelement insertions. Relative ages of full-length elements were
estimated by assessing sequence divergence between LTRs: the Pseudoviridae were significantly
younger than the Metaviridae. All retroelement insertions were mapped onto the genome
sequence and their distribution was distinctly non-uniform. Although both Pseudoviridae and
Metaviridae tend to cluster within pericentromeric heterochromatin, this association is significantly
more pronounced for all three Metaviridae sublineages (Metavirus, Tat and Athila). Among these,
Tat and Athila are strictly associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin.

genome sequences. The contributions of retroelements to
genome content range from 3% in baker's yeast to 80% in
maize [1,2]. Retroelement abundance has resulted in
increased appreciation of the important evolutionary role
they play in shaping genomes, fueling processes such as
mutation, recombination, sequence duplication and genome
expansion [3].
The impact of retroelements on their hosts is not without constraint: the host imposes an environmental landscape (the
genome) within which retroelements must develop strategies
to persist. Retroelement cDNA insertion directly impacts on
the host's genetic material, making this step a likely target for
regulatory control. Transposable elements (TEs) in some systems utilize mechanisms that direct integration to specific
chromosomal sites or safe havens [4,5]. For example, the LTR
retrotransposons of yeast are associated with domains of heterochromatin or sites bound by particular transcriptional
complexes such as RNA polymerase III [6-9]. These regions
are typically gene poor and may enable yeast retrotransposons to replicate without causing their host undue damage
[10]. Non-uniform chromosomal distributions are observed
in other organisms as well. For example, many retroelements
of Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster are
clustered in pericentromeric heterochromatin [11,12]. However, beyond the yeast model, it is not known whether retroelements generally seek safe havens for integration.
The genome of A. thaliana is ideal for exploring processes
that influence the chromosomal distribution of retroelements. A. thaliana retroelement diversity has been analyzed
previously, preparing the way for this study [13-15]. In contrast to the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans, which have
relatively few retroelements, A. thaliana has a diverse mobile
element population whose physical distribution can be
described in detail. Another benefit of A. thaliana stems from
the fact that in contrast to most other 'completely sequenced'
eukaryotic genomes, the A. thaliana genome sequence better
represents chromosomal DNA of all types, including
sequences within heterochromatin [11]. Here we undertake a
comprehensive characterization of the LTR retroelements in
the well characterized genome of A. thaliana to better understand the factors contributing to their genomic distribution.

Results
Dataset
All reverse transcriptases in the A. thaliana genome were
identified by iterated BLAST searches (Figure 1). The query
sequences were representative reverse transcriptases from
the Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae and non-LTR retrotransposons (Table 1). LTRs (if present) were assigned to each
reverse transcriptase using the software package RetroMap
(Figure 1, see also Materials and methods). Although the coding sequences of many elements with flanking LTRs were

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R78

degenerate, they are referred to as full-length or complete elements (FLE) to indicate that two LTRs or LTR fragments
could be identified. 5' LTRs from FLEs and published A. thaliana elements were used to identify solo LTRs in the genome
by BLAST searches. The final data set consisted of three insertion subtypes: 376 FLEs, 535 reverse transcriptase (RT)-only
hits, and 3,268 solo LTRs (Table 2). These sequences comprise 3,951,101 bases or 3.36% of the total 117,429,178 bases
in The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) 7 January 2002
version of the genome. Overall, chromosomal retroelement
content ranged from 2.64% (chromosome 1) to 4.31% (chromosome 3). Chromosome 4 contained the fewest FLEs (53)
and solo LTRs (449), whereas chromosome 3 had the most
(92 FLEs and 1,053 solo LTRs).
Element subtypes (FLE, RT-only and solo LTRs) were sorted
into taxonomic groupings using the formal taxonomic
nomenclature assigned to retrotransposons [16,17]. Our analysis identified numerous insertions for both the Pseudoviridae (211 FLE/82 RT-only/483 solo LTRs) and Metaviridae
(168 FLE/142 RT-only/2,803 solo LTRs). The non-LTR retrotransposons lack flanking direct repeats, and therefore only
reverse transcriptase information is provided in this study;
311 non-LTR retrotransposon reverse transcriptases were
identified. Unlike the Pseudoviridae, A. thaliana Metaviridae
elements can easily be divided into sublineages, which are
referred to as the Tat, Athila and Metavirus elements [14,18]
(Figure 2). Our method identified 42 Tat FLEs, 38 Athila
FLEs and numerous divergent Metavirus elements (82 FLE).
No evidence was found for BEL or DIRS retroelements.
The Metaviridae make up 2.34% of the A. thaliana genome,
whereas the Pseudoviridae represent only 1.25% of the total
genomic DNA. This difference is accounted for largely by the
longer average size of Metaviridae FLEs (8,952 nucleotides)
and solo LTRs (447 nucleotides) when contrasted with the
Pseudoviridae FLEs (5,336 nucleotides) and solo LTRs (187
nucleotides) (data not shown). Among the subgroups of the
Metaviridae, the average length of Metaviruses is closer to
that of the Pseudoviridae than to the mean lengths of the
Athila and Tat lineages. The Pseudoviridae are also more uniformly sized than the Metaviridae. A second factor contributing to the abundance of Metaviridae is that they have
approximately six times more solo LTRs than the Pseudoviridae, even though numbers of complete elements are similar
between families (Table 2). The ratios of solo LTRs to FLEs
also clearly differ between the Metaviridae (16.7:1) and Pseudoviridae (2.3:1).

Chromosomal distribution
The distribution of retroelements was examined on a
genome-wide basis. Upon mapping the retroelement families
onto the A. thaliana chromosomes, the previously noted pericentromeric clustering of TEs was immediately evident (Figure 3) [11]. The Metaviridae appeared to cluster in the
pericentromeric regions more tightly than the Pseudoviridae

We assessed statistical support for the apparent clustering of
elements by comparing the observed distribution of each lineage to a random uniform distribution model (Table 3). This
model assumes that any location in the genome is expected to
have a uniform probability of element insertion. This model
was rejected by Kendall-Sherman tests of uniformity for every
lineage and chromosome combination. All p-values were less
than 0.05 and most were less than 0.0001.

hypothesized that this would not be the case for the Metaviridae because they appeared to be associated with centromeres
to a greater degree than the other families. Each family's
chromosomal distribution, inclusive of all subtypes (for
example, FLE, RT-only and solo LTR), was tested for similarity to the distribution of the other families using a permutation test. With the exception of chromosome 3, the
distribution of non-LTR retrotransposons was not significantly different from that of the Pseudoviridae. Comparisons
of Metaviridae elements with Psedoviridae and/or non-LTR
elements differed significantly (p < 0.05) for all combinations.

two groups appeared similar, as did the distribution of solo
LTRs relative to full-length elements (Figure 4).

were expected to have similar distributions. This appears to
be true, as significant differences were not detected on any
chromosome for these sublineages. We then checked whether
the FLEs, RT-only hits or solo LTRs displayed different distributions from one another within their respective families. No
consistently significant trends were observed for the Pseudoviridae or the Metaviridae. Oddly, the Metaviridae solo LTR
distribution displayed significant differences from the FLEs
and RT-only hits for chromosome 3.
A feature of pericentromeric regions in A. thaliana is that
they are heterochromatic, a state required for targeted integration by the yeast Ty5 retroelement [19]. Because of the
observed pericentromeric clustering of retrotransposons in A.
thaliana, we assessed a simple model that assumes that all
elements transpose to heterochromatin (Table 4). There are
several genomic regions that are typically considered heterochromatic in A. thaliana - centromeres, knobs (on chromosomes 4 and 5), telomeres and rDNA [20-22]. We looked for
differences between lineages with respect to whether retroelements were within a heterochromatic region, or, if outside,
whether differences existed in distances to the nearest heterochromatic domain. All lineage combinations showed highly
significant differences in heterochromatic distributions. In
the Metaviridae, the Metavirus elements are less tightly associated with heterochromatin than are Tat and Athila, which
did not differ significantly from each other. Element subtypes
also differed in their distribution with respect to

heterochromatin. The major source of differences was the
distribution of solo LTRs in the Metaviridae.

Age of insertions
LTR retroelements have a built-in clock that can be used to
estimate the age of given insertions. At the time an element
inserts into the genome, the LTRs are typically 100% identical. As time passes, mutations occur within the LTRs at a rate
approximating the host's mutation rate. LTR divergence,
therefore, can be used to estimate relative ages between elements, assuming that all elements share the same probability
of incurring a mutation. Although it is possible to estimate
ages for non-LTR retrotransposons by generating a putative
ancestral consensus sequence and calculating divergence
from the consensus, this method is not directly equivalent to
estimating ages by LTR comparisons. Therefore, age comparisons were performed only for the LTR retroelement families.
Note that the ages depicted in Figure 5 are relative, and we do
not claim that a particular element is a specific age in this
study. Rather, we focus on whether elements are significantly
older or younger than each other.
Statistically significant age differences were observed among
the Pseudoviridae and three Metaviridae sublineages (F =
14.4, df = 3 and 368, p < 0.0001) (Table 5, Figure 5). Overall,
the Pseudoviridae are younger than the Metaviridae (t = 5.72,
df = 368, p < 0.0001). When the Metaviridae sublineages are
considered, it is apparent that the Athila elements are respon-

sible for much of the increased age of this family. The difference between Athila and the other two sublineages is
significant, with p = 0.0003 being the highest value for sublineage comparisons. Elements within heterochromatic
regions were significantly older than those found outside (F =
17.19, df = 1 and 368, p < 0.0001). There was suggestive evidence that the mean element ages varied among chromosomes (F = 2.73, df = 4 and 368, p = 0.0289). However, all
pairwise comparisons between chromosomes failed to yield
significant results at the 0.05 level using the Tukey-Kramer
adjustment (data not shown).

Discussion

Completed genome sequences enable comprehensive analyses of retroelement diversity and the exploration of the
impact of retroelements on genome organization. Although
most large-scale sequencing projects use the shotgun
sequencing method, this method makes it particularly difficult to assemble repetitive sequences and to correctly position
sequence repeats on the genome scaffold. Consequently,
regions of repetitive DNA such as nucleolar-organizing
regions (NORs), telomeres and centromeres tend to be
skipped, or are sometimes represented by consensus or
sampled sequences. The difficulty of cloning repetitive

sequences and the drawbacks noted above result in the
under- or misrepresentation of the repetitive content of most
genomes. Because retroelements frequently comprise a large
proportion of the repetitive DNA, 'completed' genome
sequences are typically not ideal for studies of retroelement
diversity and distribution on a genomic scale. In contrast to
these cases, the A. thaliana genome is reliably sequenced well
into heterochromatic regions and work continues to further
define these domains [11,23].
Another factor frustrating comprehensive analyses of eukaryotic mobile genetic elements is the inherent difficulty in annotating these sequences. Many mobile element insertions are
structurally degenerate, rearranged through recombination
or organized in complex arrays. Software tools and databases
such as Reputer [24] and Repbase update [25] have been
developed to identify and classify repeat sequences, and these
tools have proved helpful in several genome-wide surveys of
mobile elements. RECON [26] and LTR_STRUC [27] are
software tools that go one step further and consider structural
features of mobile elements that can assist in genome
annotation. We developed an additional software tool, called
RetroMap, to assist in characterizing the LTR retroelement
content of genomes. RetroMap delimits LTR retroelement
insertions by iterated identification of reverse transcriptases

Figure distribution of full-length A. thaliana retroelements
Physical 3
Physical distribution of full-length A. thaliana retroelements. The five A. thaliana chromosomes are designated as Ath1-5. Triangles indicate the location of a
particular retroelement on the chromosome. Non-LTR retrotransposons are in black, Pseudoviridae in gray, and Metaviridae in white. Vertical bars on the
chromosome show the precise location of the retroelement. Regions of heterochromatin are represented as follows: telomeres and NORs (on Ath2 and
Ath4) by rounded chromosome ends; centromeres by hourglass shapes; heterochromatic knobs (on Ath4 and Ath5) by narrowed stretches on
chromosome bars. The relatively short chromosome 5 knob is barely visible to the right of the centromere. The inset more clearly depicts
heterochromatic regions that are obscured by element insertions. Chromosomes are drawn to scale.

Genomic distribution of A. thaliana retroelements

With the exception of the Athila elements, the observed frequency of insertions in complex arrangements was rare. For
example, the Pseudoviridae had only eight nested and five

interactions

The ectopic exchange model assumes that inter-element
recombination restricts growth of element populations [31].
Elements should be most numerous in regions of reduced
recombination such as the centromeres, because of less frequent loss by homologous recombination. A corollary is that
element abundance at a genomic location should inversely
reflect the recombination rate for that region in the genome.
Previous work suggests that this model is not the primary
determinant of element abundance in A. thaliana. Wright et
al. [33] examined recombination rate relative to element
abundance in detail and found that the abundance of most A.
thaliana TE families actually had a small but positive
correlation with recombination rate, as was also observed in
C. elegans [34]. Devos et al. [35] found ectopic recombination
to be very infrequent relative to intra-element recombination,
suggesting this process is unlikely to have a significant role in
explaining the observed A. thaliana retrotransposable element distribution.

refereed research

For the most part, RetroMap was quite effective in identifying
LTR retrotransposon insertions. Our results closely agree
with the findings of a parallel study conducted by Pereira
[28]. For the Pseudoviridae and two of the three Metaviridae
lineages (Tat and Metavirus), we identified 210 and 128 fulllength elements, respectively, whereas Pereira recovered 215
and 130 insertions for these respective element groups. The
two studies, however, differed significantly in the number of
Athila elements identified. We found 38 insertions, whereas
Pereira recovered 219. To reconcile these differences, we
independently estimated Athila copy numbers by conducting
iterative BLAST searches with a variety of Athila query
sequences (data not shown). BLAST hits recovered with each
query were then mapped onto the genome sequence. As a
result of this analysis, we concluded that RetroMap missed
many Athila insertions, either because they are highly
degenerate or part of complex arrangements. In contrast to
Pereira's approach, RetroMap requires that a reverse
transcriptase reside between LTRs, and in many cases reverse
transcriptases were absent or not detectable in Athila insertions. This can be resolved in future implementations of RetroMap that enable multiple query sequences to be tested. The
Athila elements are large, and our underestimate of the
number of Athila elements resulted in a corresponding
underestimate of the total amount of retrotransposon DNA in
the A. thaliana genome. We calculated 3.36% for this value,
whereas Pereira calculated 5.60%. Pereira's estimate is likely
to be the more accurate of the two.

deposited research

Our data on the genomic distribution of retroelements can be
considered in the light of theoretical work predicting the distribution of TE populations within genomes. These studies
largely focus on the effects of selection and recombination on
element insertions [31,32]. Particularly relevant is the recent
study by Wright et al. [33], which considers the effects of
recombination on the genomic distribution of major groups
of mobile elements in A. thaliana (DNA transposons and retroelements). Our analysis extends this work by considering
the genomic distribution of specific retroelement lineages.
We investigate a model wherein selection and recombination
affect element lineages uniformly, and hypothesize that
observed deviations in the genomic distribution of specific
element lineages reflect unique aspects of their evolutionary
history or survival strategies such as targeted integration.

reports

Data generated by RetroMap are subject to a few caveats.
First, because element searches use reverse transcriptase
sequences as queries, elements lacking reverse transcriptase
motifs (for whatever reason) will not be identified. Second,
when RetroMap encounters nested elements, tandem
elements, and other complex arrangements, it does not
attempt to delimit the element. Rather, the user is notified
that a complex arrangement was encountered and the original reverse transcriptase match and any LTR(s) found are
logged as separate entities.

unassignable elements. The small observed number of complex element arrangements in A. thaliana contrasts sharply
with observations in grass genomes, where retroelements are
usually found in complex nested arrays [29,30]. This may
reflect a difference between species in factors contributing to
chromosomal distribution of retroelements, or it may simply
be a consequence of the difference in abundance of retroelements between A. thaliana (5.60% of the genome) and
grasses (up to 80% of some genomes) [1,28].

age than elements elsewhere in the genome. Our
consideration of age assumes that the chance of loss by
recombination remains steady or increases with element age.
However, old elements will have higher sequence divergence,
thereby reducing the likelihood that they will recombine. In
considering age, we also assume that all elements evolve at
the same rates. This is unlikely to be the case, as local,

chromosomal and compartmental locations are increasingly
found to have different mutation rates [36,37].
With respect to the distribution of solo LTRs, our data show
exactly the opposite bias predicted by the ectopic exchange
model: the ratio of Metaviridae solo LTRs to FLEs in heterochromatin was nearly twice that found outside heterochromatin. The frequency of solo LTRs at the centromeres
suggests that homologous recombination, at least over short

While we did observe the predicted shift toward older elements within heterochromatin, the data are not consistent
with low rates of recombination as the determinant of retrotransposon accumulation at the centromeres. Within the
Metaviridae, for example, the Metaviruses and Tat elements
differ significantly in their association with heterochromatin.
The ectopic exchange model would predict that the Tat elements should be older; however, these two lineages do not
differ significantly in age. Although it is possible that recombinational forces could act differentially on different element
sublineages, we view this as unlikely. Rather, forces other
than ectopic recombination, such as targeted integration (see
below), are responsible for the differential genomic distribution of certain element lineages. This is not to say that ectopic

Deleterious insertion model
The deleterious insertion model hypothesizes that element
insertions are generally harmful to the host, and thus elements accumulate in regions of low gene density, where
insertions are least likely to have negative effects on the host.
According to this model, abundance of all classes of mobile
elements should inversely reflect gene density within the
genome. This is supported by the observation that elements
are over-represented in gene-poor pericentromeric heterochromatin and are rare over much of the chromosome arms.
However, we did not observe an increase in element abundance at other gene-poor heterochromatic regions (such as
the telomeres and NORs), which would be predicted by the
deleterious insertion hypothesis. This model would also pre-

dict that element insertions into gene-rich regions that are
tolerated by the host should act as founders or safe havens for
future element insertions. This could lead to an ever-expanding area of tightly clustered and frequently nested elements in
euchromatin, assuming the overall random insertion rate is
greater than the rate of sequence loss through recombination.
Nested clusters of elements have been reported in cereals
such as maize and barley [29,30]. In A. thaliana, although
numerous potential 'seed' insertion sites are observed along
the chromosome arms, we did not detect dense clusters of
nested elements at these locations.
In contrast to the deleterious insertion model, it is important
to recognize that some element insertions may provide a
selective advantage. Studies in C. elegans and rice indicate
that many retrotranposons are associated with genes (63%
and 20% in these species respectively) [38,39]. In D. melanogaster, some retrotransposon-gene associations are preserved in diverse natural populations, consistent with the
hypothesis that they confer a positive selective advantage
[40]. Furthermore, recent analyses in S. pombe suggest that
the Tf1 retrotransposons may regulate expression of adjacent
genes [41]. We cannot rule out a role for positive selection in
the distribution of some A. thaliana mobile elements, but
identifying such a role would require a more refined analysis
of element distribution and gene associations.

Impact of targeted integration
The observation that many LTR retroelements have non-uniform genomic distributions suggested that targeted integration may be a driver of retroelement distribution patterns
[42]. Neither the deleterious insertion nor ectopic recombination models address the situation where some or all
elements have evolved the ability to bias their distributions
through targeted integration. The LTR retroelements of S.
cerevisiae insert preferentially into heterochromatin or sites
occupied by RNA polymerase III, and in the evolutionarily
distant S. pombe genome, retroelements are located preferentially upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II
[6-9]. Retroviruses also insert preferentially into transcribed
regions, with some retroviruses favoring insertions into promoter regions [4,43].
Targeted integration could contribute significantly to the
chromosomal distribution of A. thaliana retroelements. As in
other systems, targeting may occur because elements recognize a specific chromatin state and actively insert into regions
with that type of chromatin. A chromatin-targeting model has
the following predictions. First, very few elements will be
found outside targeted chromatin domains. For example, all
heterochromatic regions such as NORs, knobs and telomeres
would be occupied by the same lineage of elements if these
regions share a chromatin feature recognized by that lineage.

The targeting hypothesis is well supported for the Metaviridae, which on a genome-wide basis differ significantly in their
chromosomal distribution from the Pseudoviridae and nonLTR retrotransposons. This is particularly true for the Athila
and Tat lineages, both of which are tightly associated with
pericentromeric regions. Athila and Tat elements are not
found in heterochromatin regions around the telomeres,
however, suggesting that telomeric and centromeric heterochromatin differ. Targeted integration to pericentromeric
heterochromatin may be a general feature of the Metaviridae.
Members of the Metaviridae are abundant in pericentromeric
heterochromatin in many grass species [44]. Langdon et al.
[45] suggested that an evolutionary ancient member of the
Metaviridae in cereals targets to centromeric domains. Portions of a maize homolog of this element were found to coprecipitate with the centromere-specific histone CENH3,
indicating an association of this element with a particular
type of chromatin [46].

be that these element lineages do not target their integration,
or they may recognize other chromosomal features, although
we did not observe any association with other genome features or gene classes such as tRNA genes (data not shown). De
novo integration events have been mapped on a chromosomal level for two tobacco Pseudoviridae elements in heterologous hosts - Tto1 in A. thaliana and Tnt1 in Medicago
trunculata. In both cases these elements integrated throughout the genome, displaying some preference for genic regions
[47,48]. Whether this observed distribution pattern reflects
random integration or recognition of some other subtle chromosomal feature remains to be determined. Because we predict that the Metaviridae recognize pericentromeric
heterochromatin, an important dataset for analysis will be
maps of the various DNA methylation and histone-modification patterns for the full genome. In-depth characterization of
the distribution of retroelements relative to chromatin modifications may reveal additional evidence for targeting and
help to understand the impact of targeting on genome
organization.

tend to cluster at the centromeres. The pericentromeric association of three Metaviridae sublineages (Metavirus, Tat and
Athila) was significantly more pronounced than for the Pseudoviridae. Several factors are likely to contribute to the centromeric association of these elements, including target-site
bias, selection against euchromatin integration and pericentromeric accumulation of elements due to suppression of
recombination. For the Tat and Athila lineages, however,
target-site specificity appears to be the primary factor determining chromosomal distribution. We predict that, like retroelements in yeast, the Tat and Athila elements target
integration to pericentromeric regions by recognizing a specific feature of pericentromeric heterochromatin.

Materials and methods
RetroMap and the A. thaliana retroelement dataset
Reverse transcriptase amino-acid sequences (as defined by
[49], see also Table 1), were used to query a database of A.
thaliana chromosomes (TIGR version 7 January 2002) with
the tblastn program (E = 1e-10, XML output, filtering disabled) [50]. The resulting search report was imported into RetroMap. RetroMap (to be described in detail elsewhere)
provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interactively
characterize LTR retrotransposons in targeted genomes or
large genomic contigs (Figure 1a). RetroMap generates a nonredundant set of database hits from BLAST results generated
by a given query sequence set. Hits are merged if they directly
overlap or if they align to different portions of the same query
sequence. In this study, the nonredundant sequences were
used to re-query the chromosome database twice more using
tblastx (E = 1e-10, XML output, filtering disabled) to identify
increasingly divergent or degenerate elements. Unique hits
identified in the final round of screening were taken to represent the entire complement of retroelements in A. thaliana.
RetroMap assigns putative LTRs where possible for each
reverse transcriptase by comparing 10 kb of DNA from each
flank. This is accomplished using Blast2Sequences to identify
flanking repeats [51] (Figure 1b). Direct repeats found closest
to the reverse transcriptase, larger than 50 bp and less than 5
kb, are considered to be LTRs. Hits with putative LTRs were
considered to be full-length elements (FLE) or complete elements. Twenty-six reverse transcriptase hits were excluded
from the FLEs owing to difficulty in automatic LTR assignment (13 each from the Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae).
Among these were nested elements and tandem elements
sharing a LTR. Reverse transcriptases were assigned to a retroelement lineage (Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae or non-LTR
retrotransposon) on the basis of their similarity to the diagnostic reverse transcriptase query sequences. Full-length
Metaviridae elements were further subdivided into the classic
(Metavirus), Tat and Athila groups on the basis of the highest-scoring match in a BLAST database containing the Metaviridae reverse transcriptase sequences described in [18].
Putative complete elements with a predicted reverse

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R78

transcriptase failing to significantly match any sequence in
this database were removed from further consideration as
false positives (two cases).
Solo LTRs and solo LTR fragments were identified with
blastn (E < 1e-5) using all predicted 5' LTRs of known A. thaliana elements and the FLEs. RetroMap assigns any putative
LTR sequence that fails to match or overlap with a predicted
FLE LTR as a solo LTR.

Relative age calculation for full-length elements
LTRs are identical at the time of retroelement integration,
and so relative element ages were estimated from the percentage of identical residues shared between 5' and 3' LTRs for
FLEs. The age formula used was T = d/2k (time (T) = genetic
distance (d)/ [2 × substitution rate (k)]), where genetic distance is 1 - (percent identity/100) and the substitution rate is
1.5 × 10-8 [52].

Assignment of heterochromatin boundaries
Chromosome coordinates relative to the left (north) end were
used to calculate distances between retroelements and heterochromatic domains. Heterochromatin boundaries were
derived from [20-22] and include the telomeres, heterochromatic knobs, NORs and centromeres. Chromosome endcoordinates were considered as the telomere boundaries. The
A. thaliana NORs are located at the left (north) ends of chromosomes 2 and 4, and as these regions were only sample
sequenced, their boundaries were assigned as the left ends of
chromosomes 2 and 4. Heterochromatic knobs and pericentromeric regions were assigned as the outermost physical
markers delimiting these regions, as determined by the studies listed above.

Statistical tests
A RetroMap-generated datafile was used as the data source
for statistical testing. The data file contains chromosomal element coordinates, LTR identity, age and lineage information
for all A. thaliana retroelement families by element category:
reverse transcriptase only (R), full-length (F), and solo LTR
(S).
For each element type and each chromosome, a KendallSherman test [53-55] was conducted to determine if the
element positions were randomly distributed across chromosomes according to a uniform distribution. A permutation
test [55] was used to assess the statistical significance of
observed differences in the chromosomal position distributions for each chromosome across various element categories.
The multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) test is
briefly described as follows. The average distance between a
pair of elements within a category of interest is determined. A
weighted sum of these averages over all categories of interest
is computed, with each category weighted in proportion to the
number of elements in the category. This weighted sum is the
observed value of the test statistic. Next, the test statistic is re-

For FLEs, linear model analyses were used to assess the
effects of the factors 'chromosome', 'lineage/sublineage', and
'location' relative to heterochromatin on the response variable 'element age'. F-tests were used to check for interaction
between these three factors and to assess the statistical significance of observed differences among the five chromosomes,
among the four lineage/sublineage categories (Pseudoviridae
and the three Metaviridae sublineages:Athila, Tat or Metavirus), and between elements inside and outside heterochromatin. The square root of age was used as the response
variable in the age analysis so that the variance of the
response would be roughly constant across categories defined
by combinations of chromosome, lineage/sublineage, and
location, as required for standard linear model analyses. Outlying observations were present, but the results of the analysis
remained essentially the same with or without the outliers.
Thus the reported results are based on the full dataset.

computed for each of 10,000 random permutations of the category labels. For each permutation, the observed chromosomal positions of the elements are held constant while the
category labels are randomly shuffled. The proportion of the
10,000 permutation-replicated test statistics that are less
than or equal to the original observed test statistic serves as
an approximate p-value for a test whose null hypothesis is
that all element categories of interest have the same chromosomal position distribution. This permutation approach is
useful for the chromosomal position data because first, no
distributional assumptions are required, second, differences
in chromosomal position distributions other than simple
location shifts are detectable, and third, the method is not as
sensitive to outliers as common parametric approaches.
