Abstract
Background: An important role in the evolution of intracellular trafficking machinery in
eukaryotes played small GTPases belonging to the Rab family known as pivotal regulators of vesicle
docking, fusion and transport. The Rab family is very diversified and divided into several specialized
subfamilies. We focused on the VII functional group comprising Rab7 and Rab9, two related
subfamilies, and analysed 210 sequences of these proteins. Rab7 regulates traffic from early to late
endosomes and from late endosome to vacuole/lysosome, whereas Rab9 participates in transport
from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.
Results: Although Rab7 and Rab9 proteins are quite small and show heterogeneous rates of
substitution in different lineages, we found a phylogenetic signal and inferred evolutionary
relationships between them. Rab7 proteins evolved before radiation of main eukaryotic
supergroups while Rab9 GTPases diverged from Rab7 before split of choanoflagellates and
metazoans. Additional duplication of Rab9 and Rab7 proteins resulting in several isoforms occurred
in the early evolution of vertebrates and next in teleost fishes and tetrapods. Three Rab7 lineages
emerged before divergence of monocots and eudicots and subsequent duplications of Rab7 genes
occurred in particular angiosperm clades. Interestingly, several Rab7 copies were identified in some
representatives of excavates, ciliates and amoebozoans. The presence of many Rab copies is
correlated with significant differences in their expression level. The diversification of analysed Rab
subfamilies is also manifested by non-conserved sequences and structural features, many of which
are involved in the interaction with regulators and effectors. Individual sites discriminating different
subgroups of Rab7 and Rab9 GTPases have been identified.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic reconstructions of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins were performed by a
variety of methods. These Rab GTPases show diversification both at the phylogenetic, expression
and structural levels. The presence of many Rab7 and Rab9 isoforms suggests their functional
specialization and complexity of subcellular trafficking even in unicellular eukaryotes. The identified
less conserved regions in analysed Rab sequences may directly contribute to such a differentiation.

Background
The origin of eukaryotic cells was one of the major evolutionary transitions, although very interesting and chal-

lenging, still remains poorly understood. The
development of the endomembrane system and cellular
trafficking machinery are crucial stage in eukaryotic cell

evolution [1-3]. An important role in this evolution was
played by small GTPases belonging to the Ras superfamily
[1,2] that showed a spectacular expansion in eukaryotes
[4].

found in Paramecium [45] and in five fungi species [22],
three isoforms in Trichomonas vaginalis [18], four in Lotus
japonicus [46], eight in Arabidopsis thaliana [14,15], and
nine in Entamoeba histolytica [19].

The superfamily is divided into five major families: Arf,
Rab, Ran, Ras and Rho [5]. Rab proteins form the largest
branch of the Ras superfamily (see for review: [6-13]).
This family is much diversified and can be further divided
into at least 14 groups/subfamilies [6]. Rab proteins are
best known as key regulators of intracellular vesicular
transport and membrane trafficking in exocytic and endocytic pathways. Each Rab protein has a distinct subcellular
location and is responsible for a specific transport step.
Rab proteins from diverse eukaryotes cluster in a phylogenetic tree into at least eight groups showing similar function, and/or subcellular localisation, and sequences [14].
This co-segregation of Rab GTPases according to common
functions rather than to taxonomic relationships indicates
a conserved mechanism of Rab interaction with regulators/effectors across evolution and a rapid divergence of
these functional groups in the early evolution of eukaryotes. During radiation of eukaryotes numerous duplications led to diversification of Rab proteins in particular
lineages.

Rab9 proteins are found only in late endosomes. They are
important for lysosomal enzyme delivery and are a key
mediator of vesicular transport from late endosomes to
the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [24,47-50]. Moreover,
they are responsible for the maintenance of specific late
endocytic compartments and endosome/lysosome localisation [51]. It has also been found that Rab9 GTPases are
a key component for the replication of several viruses,
including HIV1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles making
Rab9 a potential target for inhibiting replication of some
viruses [52,53]. A second human isoform of Rab9, named
Rab9b was reported [54] and additionally a human Rab9
pseudogene was identified [55].

Evolution and diversification of Rab proteins were studied
in a global aspect [14] and in particular species [15-20]
and also in selected taxonomic groups [21-23]. However,
evolution of particular Rab groups was not yet analysed in
detail in wide-ranging taxonomic studies. We focused in
this study on the VII functional group (in the classification
of Pereira-Leal and Seabra [14]) containing Rab7 and
Rab9, two related subfamilies, showing common localisation to late endosomal compartment.
Rab7 proteins are localised in late endosomes, lysosomes
and phagosomes. They regulate vesicular traffic from early
to late endosomes and from late endosome to vacuole/
lysosome [24-35]. Moreover, Rab7 proteins participate in
the maturation and biogenesis of lysosomes [34,36]. They
are also involved in fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes with primary phagosomes in specialized phagocytes [37]. They regulate the maturation and biogenesis of
phagosomes both in unicellular eukaryotes and macrophages [36,38-42].
Recently, a novel human isoform of Rab7, named Rab7b
was described (the former Rab7 isoform is often called
Rab7a). Lysosome-localised Rab7b is involved in monocytic differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and possibly, also in regulation of monocyte
functions [43]. Moreover, it negatively regulates proinflammatory and antipathogenic Toll-like receptor 4 signalling in macrophages [44]. Two isoforms of Rab7 were

Interestingly, Rab9 proteins were not yet reported so far in
unicellular eukaryotes, plants and fungi. On the other
hand, Rab7 subfamily belongs to the ancestral set of Rab
present in the ancestor of eukaryotes and all extant
descendents [2,56]. Previous global phylogenies of Rab
subfamilies showed close relationships of Rab7 proteins
and Rab9 proteins [5,14]. However, evolution of these
subfamilies was not studied in detail and any stage of evolution of Eukaryota in which the Rab9 subfamily diverged
from Rab7 subfamily was not specified. The functional
diversity and the presence of many isoforms of Rab7 and
Rab9 make it interesting to study evolution, duplication
events and phylogenetic relationships of these closely
related proteins.

Results and discussion
Taxonomic distribution of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins
Thorough and detailed searches of public databases based
on sequence annotation and similarity enabled us to
gather as many as 210 non-redundant sequences representing Rab7 and Rab9 proteins. The search showed that
Rab7 proteins are represented in all supergroups of
Eukaryota: Excavata, Plantae, Chromalveolata, Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta (including Fungi and Metazoa =
Animalia). However, Rab9 proteins are present only in
representatives of multicellular animals (Metazoa) and
Monosiga brevicolis, a member of choanoflagellates, the
closest known relatives to metazoans [57,58]. Assuming
the taxonomic distributions we can assume that Rab7 proteins arose before the radiation of eukaryotes and Rab9
proteins must have branched later among metazoans and
their relatives. Interestingly, Rab7b isoforms are found
only in representatives of amphibians, birds and
mammals.

Global phylogeny of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins
To have a global view on phylogenetic relationships
between all Rab7/Rab9 proteins we at first constructed a
global ML tree based on their amino acid sequences. The
tree is shown in Figure 1 (see Additional file 1 for the
extended version). These sequences cluster together with a
strong bootstrap support and clearly separate from representatives of the closest Rab subfamilies 23, 29, 32 and 38
[5,14]. In the tree we can distinguish clades that we expect
should be monophyletic. Such monophyletic clades create many sequences of Entamoeba histolytica and sequences
of Rab7b isoforms, Rab9 proteins, some subgroups of
excavates (Trypanosomatidae, trichomonads, Jakobidae),
subgroups of plants (Chlorophyta, angiosperms), most
chromalveolates, Nematoda, most other metazoans, Saccharomycetaceae and most other fungi. A lot of these
clades have a moderate or high bootstrap support or, for
members of the same taxonomic group, are in a close
neighbourhood in the tree. Interestingly, we named as
Rab7c another well-supported clade grouping two highly
diverged vertebrate sequences (Danio rerio and Xenopus
tropicalis). In some slightly suboptimal trees we observed
recovery of expected monophyly of some other clades that
are not monophyletic in Figure 1. For instance, two separated sequences of chromalveolates (Oxytricha trifallax
and Blastocystis hominis) were placed among other chromalveolates, three separated sequences of metazoans
(Schistosoma japonicum and two nematods) were found in
Metazoa clade and Rab7b from Gallus gallus grouped correctly with other amniotes.

However, the tree is generally poorly resolved, especially
deep branches are very short and none of them has significant, if any, bootstrap support. Many single sequences,
especially those of Excavata and Amoebozoa, are separated from other members of their own supergroup.
These relationships between Rab sequences that are
inconsistent with species phylogeny are probably artificial
and result from a heterogeneous rate of evolution of analysed sequences, insufficient phylogenetic information
contained in these short sequences and the long-branch
attraction artefact, LBA [59]. The LBA is especially evident
in partition of the tree into two parts: one containing
much diverged sequences and the other comprising less
diverged sequences. However, these relationships are not
supported by bootstrap analyses and should be considered uncertain. Inconsistencies of obtained phylogeny
with species phylogeny are difficult to explain by a horizontal gene transfer or ancient gene duplications before
radiation of eukaryotic supergroups and subsequent gene
losses in the different lineages. There is no bootstrap support for relationships that would suggest these events.
Moreover, the latter scenario requires many unparsimonious duplication and loss events, making this explanation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

highly unlikely. We performed phylogenetic analyses on
seven alignment sets excluding gradually the most variable sites, but improvement or clarification could not be
obtained because of the small number of sites necessary
for a strong phylogenetic signal (data not shown).
To check consistency of the obtained Rab7/Rab9 gene
phylogeny with the species phylogeny, we compared the
topology of the found tree with the alternative topology
assuming the most probable relationships between main
groups of eukaryotes (see Additional file 2 and Additional
file 3). These analyses revealed that when fast evolving
sites are excluded from the data and more relatively conserved sites are present, the hypothesis of relationships
between Rab proteins agreeable with species phylogeny
can not be rejected or even is favoured.
Since Rab7 and Rab9 proteins show heterogeneous evolution rate and are susceptible to LBA we applied two programs proposed to such cases: PhyloBayes [60], Bayesian
approach and PhyML-CAT [61], maximum likelihood
approach. They use a mixture model describing across-site
heterogeneities in the amino acid replacement patterns. It
was shown that accounting for such site specific features
should both improve a statistical fit [62] and alleviate
phylogenetic artefacts due to long-branch attraction phenomena [63].
However, the application of these programs did not
improve the obtained phylogenies (see Additional file 4
and Additional file 5). Although the monophyly of metazoan Rab7a proteins was recovered (i.e. three separated
sequences of Schistosoma japonicum and two nematods
were put into Metazoa clade), Rab7b from Gallus gallus
adopted correct grouping with other amniotes and
sequences of chlorophytes were clustered with other
plants, the obtained trees are still poorly resolved with
many unsupported branches. Moreover, other inconsistencies appeared, e.g.: choanoflagellate Rab7a is separated
from metazoan sequences by trypanosomatid clade (the
PhyloBayes tree), more chromalveolate sequences are separated from each other (the PhyML-CAT tree), sequence
from Monosiga did not take basal position in Rab9 clade
(both trees), and among plant clade unrelated sequences
are located (both trees). Our analyses suggest that the phylogenetic signal in data is so weak and the sequences
evolve with such a heterogeneous rate that even more
sophisticated methods do not cope with inferring global
phylogeny of analysed Rab proteins.
The obtained results show the presence of many Rab7 and
Rab9 isoforms and duplicates in metazoans, plants and
some unicellular eukaryotes. Therefore in subsequent sections we focused on relationships between Rab proteins
belonging to these taxonomic groups.

Phylogeny and duplications of metazoan Rab7 and Rab9
proteins
The group of Metazoa is the most abundant in different
Rab7 and Rab9 isoforms and duplicates. The phylogeny
based on amino acid sequences (Figure 1 and Additional
file 1) revealed distinct and highly supported clades
grouping metazoans sequences: Rab9 proteins (present in
both invertebrates and vertebrates clustered significantly
with Monosiga brevicolis), Rab7a (present also in invertebrates and vertebrates clustered with Capsaspora and Monosiga), Rab7b (present in Tetrapoda) and Rab7c proteins
(present only in Danio rerio and Xenopus tropicalis). However, these clades are separated from each other. Very
divergent sequences of Rab9, Rab7b and Rab7c proteins
are also placed among very divergent sequences of excavates and amoebozoans, likely as a result of the LBA. Considering taxonomic distribution of Rab9 proteins we
should expect that they diverged from Rab7 proteins
before radiation of metazoans at the level of common
ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoan lineages.
Similarly, the emergence of Rab7b isoforms from Rab7a
proteins would precede the radiation of four-limbed vertebrates and Rab7c proteins would evolve from Rab7a at
least before radiation of jawed vertebrates.

In order to test the credibility of assumed relationships
among metazoan Rab proteins we carried out additional
phylogenetic analyses of their selected subgroups including potential sister sequences and appropriate out-groups
(Figures 2, 3 and 4). These analyses were based on nucleotide sequences. They showed stronger phylogenetic signals than amino acid sequences and the trees obtained
were better resolved than those constructed on the latter
ones. Each subgroup was examined separately to avoid
the LBA resulting from a high substitution rate of the analysed sequences. The trees obtained with ML and Bayesian
approaches had almost identical topologies.
Since saturation of substitutions and base composition
may violate reliability of results of phylogenetic analyses
(especially based on nucleotide sequences) we carried out
the appropriate tests to check it (see Material and Methods
for details). However, the analysed whole nucleotide sets
did not show significant saturation effect. We also did not
observe a meaningful deviation in nucleotide composition between sequences in these sets.
The exclusive representation of Rab9 proteins by choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicolis and multicellular animals
indicated that this subfamily branched from Rab7 near
the divergence of choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. In agreement with that, a very strongly supported
Rab9 clade, shown on the tree in Figure 2, branched
among choanoflagellate/metazoan clade of Rab7a proteins. Such a position is strongly supported by very high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

Bayesian posterior probabilities and moderate LRSH support at two external nodes comprising Rab9 and Rab7
sequences of Metazoa, Monosiga ovata and Capsaspora owczarzaki, a unicellular opisthokont closely related to animals and choanoflagellates [64,65]. Similarly, Rab7b
proteins were identified only in the four-limbed vertebrates suggesting their divergence from Rab7a isoforms
before radiation tetrapods. Actually, the clade of Rab7b
proteins is placed among this group of vertebrates with
moderate posterior probability support and very high
LRSH support (Figure 3). The expected position of Rab7c
GTPases represented only by sequences of Danio rerio and
Xenopus tropicalis is also recovered (Figure 4). They
branched at the base of vertebrate Rab7a clade with very
high LRSH and posterior probability and moderate ML
bootstrap support. The clade Rab7c has very high bootstrap values and contains none of representatives of amniotes and only the teleost fish and amphibian. Therefore a
loss of this isoform can be assumed in the amniote
lineage.
The phylogenetic reconstructions also revealed that subsequent duplications of Rab genes occurred in different lineages. Both the protein and gene trees include highly
supported sister clades comprising Rab9a and Rab9b isoforms (Figure 2). Each of these clades groups Rab9
sequences of fishes, amphibians, birds and mammals suggesting that the duplication occurred among this subfamily prior to divergence of jawed vertebrates. Moreover,
two clustered gene copies of both Rab9 and Rab7b are
present in Xenopus laevis indicating additional duplications that occurred in this species (Figure 3). Since three
Rab7a gene copies were found in Danio rerio and two in
Tetraodon nigroviridis, it may suggest duplications in Rab7a
isoforms among the teleost fish lineage.
To further resolve observed relationships between particular Rab genes we compared regions including these interesting Rab genes from key genomes of Danio rerio,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus and
Canis familiaris based on data available in Ensembl database [66]. The analyses showed that the Rab genes belonging to the same clade, i.e. Rab7a, Rab7b, Rab7c, Rab9a
and Rab9b, were flanked by their own set of orthologous
(syntenic) genes. It indicates that the genes clustered
together in these clades have the common origin which is
in agreement with high bootstrap values at their nodes in
phylogenetic trees. It is worth to mention that the local
conservation of orthologous gene content was also found
for two Rab7c genes. Since they are highly diverged one
could assume that they are grouped because of LBA and
should be placed separately among the vertebrate Rab7a
clade. However, the analysis of synteny allows assuming
the common descent of these two genes.

The observed duplications of Rab genes are probably a
result of whole genome duplications (WGD) that
occurred at least three times in the vertebrate lineage. The

emergence of the Rab7c clade and the duplications among
vertebrate Rab9 proteins mapped before splitting of jawed
vertebrates could be related to one or two rounds (1R and
2R) of WGD (see e.g. [67] for a recent review and [68,69]
for recent evidence). The third round of WGD (3R)
occurred in teleost fishes [70-72], which is also reflected

in fish Rab7a duplications. Observed Rab9 and Rab7b
gene copies in Xenopus laevis are probably related to tetraploidization of its genome [73,74]. As a result of all these
duplication events Danio rerio, Xenopus laevis and Homo
sapiens possess as many as 6, 5 and 4 Rab7/Rab9 gene copies, respectively.

It is interesting that not all analysed taxa contain a full set
of all Rab isoforms. For example, Rab7c clade is represented only by one fish (Danio rerio) and one amphibian
(Xenopus tropicalis) sequence. Probably, different Rab gene
copies were lost in different genera/species or these genes
have not yet been identified. Such asymmetry in duplicated gene distribution is in agreement with results of
Woods et al. [75] who found that many different duplicated genes were retained in Danio and Tetraodon,
although similar numbers of duplicates remained in both
genomes. Such differential retention of duplicate genes
may have facilitated the isolation of nascent species
formed during the vast radiation of teleosts and does not
appear to be an exceptional phenomenon. Moreover, it
seems even a desired one to accomplish speciation.
Phylogeny and duplications of plant Rab7 proteins
Many Rab7 isoforms are also present in plant taxa. Both
protein- and gene-based phylogenies revealed clear duplications of Rab7 genes that occurred in higher plants three
times before divergence for monocots and eudicots giving
three distinct Rab7 lineages (Figure 1 and Figure 5). The
ML and Bayesian trees based on nucleotide sequence
revealed almost identical topologies with many strongly
supported clades. Apart from the early duplications of
Rab7 in the evolution of higher plants, successive duplications must have happened among eudicots and monocots
because additional copies are present in Arabidopsis thaliana (8 copies), Lotus corniculatus (4 copies) and Oryza
sativa (4 copies).

The unravelled duplications events could be correlated
with small-, large- or whole genome duplications recognized in angiosperms evolution. Analyses of Arabidopsis
thaliana genome revealed three rounds of WGD in its lineage: before monocot-eudicot divergence (1R), after the
divergence of monocots and eudicots (2R), and after the
divergence of Brassicales and Malvales, but prior to the
divergence of Arabidopsis and Brassica (3R) [76-81]. Early
polyploidization before radiation of flowering plants was
also found by Cui et al. [82]. The observed split of Rab7
gene lineages into three Rab7 lineages each containing
monocots and eudicots genes could be reminiscent of
these early duplications. Similarly, the clade comprising
the Medicago truncatula sequence and four non-monophyletic Arabidopsis thaliana Rab7 sequences in the Rab7
lineage I may correspond to the duplication event (2R)
before eurosid divergence [see also [83]]. Finally, particular Arabidopsis thaliana Rab7 proteins cluster together in
pairs in all three lineages, thus indicating that the most
recent WGD (i.e. 3R) occurred in the course of its genome
evolution. The two separated Rab7 copies present in Lotus
corniculatus in the lineage I were probably retained after
WGD which occurred early in legume evolution [84]. The
presence of two Oryza sativa Rab7 sequences in the lineage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

I significantly separated by the sequence of Horedum vulgare could be related with ancient WGD or other duplication events predating the divergence of the grass family
[85-90].
Duplications of Rab7 proteins in other eukaryotes
Several lineage-specific duplications events can also be
deduced for some unicellular eukaryotes (Figure 1 and
Additional file 1). Seven Rab7 copies are present in Trichomonas vaginalis. In this case all the copies form one
unsupported clade branched to subsequent supported
subclades. One of these includes the sequence of other
excavate (Streblomastix strix) which could suggest that the
duplication may have happened before radiation of Excavata for parabasalids and oxymonads. However, the identity of the sequence attributed to Streblomastix strix may be
dubious since the EST library is highly contaminated with
sequences from parabasalid species co-inhabiting the
insect host together with oxymonad [91]. Therefore it is
very likely that its close relationship to Trichomonas vaginalis sequences is best explained by a parabasalid rather than
oxymonad provenance of this sequence.

Ten Rab7 proteins can be identified in Entamoeba histolytica. Most form one clade but only subclades show bootstrap support. Two Rab7 copies are present in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and three in each of Paramecium species (P. tetraurelia and P. octaurelia) analysed so
far. (In phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 only two sequences
from Paramecium aurelia are shown because its two
sequences Q95UJ0 and ACJ09042.1 are identical at the
amino acid level. These sequences are represented in the
tree by the Q95UJ0 and are coded by different genes).
However, duplicated sequences form a strongly supported
clade only in the latter case. Two amoebozoans Acanthamoeba castellani and Dictyostelium discoideum have four
and three Rab7 copies, respectively. In three cases the
sequences of these two species are branched together, that
suggests gene duplications before divergence of these lineages, although these clades do not have any bootstrap
support. A very intriguing case is presented by two
sequences of fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis that
are very distant in the tree. This separation may result
from the LBA because one is very divergent.
Similarly to metazoans and plants, the presence of many
Rab7 copies in some unicellular eukaryotes appeared as a
result of WGD or other genome duplications that took
place in a smaller scale. At least three successive wholegenome duplications occurred relatively recently in Paramecium lineage [92] and possibly one or more large-scale
duplication events happened in Trichomonas vaginalis
genome [93]. Relatively recent duplications were also
reported for Dictyostelium discoideum genome [94] that
seems to be especially susceptible to WGD [95].

Evolutionary consequences of Rab duplications and their
diversification
The presence of many Rab duplicates and isoforms raises
a question about potential evolutionary consequences of
Rab duplications. Duplicated sequences usually evolve
significantly faster than unduplicated genes with a similar
level of divergence, showing an early phase of relaxed constraints is in agreement with the view that gene duplications are a source of new protein functions [96,97].
Actually, we found that Rab9, Rab7b, Rab7c and some
Arabidopsis thaliana (in the lineage 1) sequences showed
elevated levels of substitutions that can be related with
gaining of a new function or subfunctionalization [98].

Since Rab proteins are specialized to particular subcellular
locations and functions, and several are tissue, organ- and
developmental stage-specific, it was postulated that the
diversification of Rab genes correlates with multicellularity of organisms [14]. The emergence of Rab9 before the
radiation of Metazoa could fit this assumption. However,
relationships between the Rab expansion and the multicellularity are not clear. The origin of Rab9 proteins
responsible for vesicular transport and lysosomal enzyme
sorting from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network
may have been an important step in improvement of
digestion and degradation processes associated with
phagocytosis, endocytosis, autophagy and apoptosis.
Similarly to cell adhesion and signalling proteins that are

otherwise restricted to metazoans, Rab9 was identified in
one unicellular eukaryote,Monosiga brevicolis, the closest
known relative to metazoans whose genome was completely sequenced [99]. It implicates that the common
ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates already possessed several of the critical structural components used in
modern Metazoa.
Additional duplication of Rab9 and Rab7 proteins that
occurred in the early evolution of vertebrates and subsequently in teleost fishes and tetrapods can be connected to
the functional diversification of these genes in vertebrates.
The duplicated Rab might have acquired novel spatiotemporal roles related to expression in different cell types, to
developmental stages or to environmental conditions.
However, non-detailed functions or expression patterns
for many Rab paralogous genes in given lineages or species were conclusively specified. Therefore, potential consequences of these Rab duplications in evolution of
vertebrates are not clear. The specialization of function
was found only for Rab7b isoforms identified in terrestrial
vertebrates. Rab7a proteins usually regulate vesicular traffic from early to late endosomes and from late endosome
to vacuole/lysosome while the Rab7b isoform regulates
transport only to or from lysosomes. Moreover, it is selectively expressed in monocytes and probably is involved in
their differentiation [43,44].

In order to estimate expected differences in expression
profiles or levels of various Rab genes, we gathered data
on expression profiles from UniGene database [100] and
compared fractions of ESTs between different Rab isoforms or their duplicates. It should be noted that the
expression data provide an approximate estimation of
gene expression but are a good starting point for further
investigations. Nevertheless, the data in UniGene expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana genes lead to the same
conclusions as data obtained in more exact experiments
by Mazel A, et al. [101] as mentioned below (for the genes
At.19280 and At.24625).
The comparisons clearly showed that Rab9a proteins
always exhibit higher expression levels than Rab9b (Table
S2 in Additional file 6). Similarly, Rab7a isoforms showed
significant higher number of ESTs than Rab7b (Table S3
in Additional file 6). Since some species possess more
than two Rab7 copies, we performed separate pair-wise
comparison of their EST fraction (Table S4 in Additional
file 6). Generally, these analyses also showed higher
expression of Rab7a genes than other isoforms. Moreover,
some variation of expression level was observed for different gene copies of the same Rab7 isoform (Table S4 in
Additional file 6).
Similarly, the existence of many duplicated Rab7 isoforms
in higher plants suggests their functional diversity. Interestingly, despite its small size, the A. thaliana genome
(157 Mb) [102] retained as many as eight genes after
duplication events suggesting a selective advantage of this
variation.
Several experimental studies showed that duplicated Rab7
genes contributed to adaptation of plants to different
environmental conditions and particular Rab7 copies
acquired novel spatiotemporal roles and expression profiles. Borg et al. [46] found in Lotus japonicus that among
four Rab7 genes, two of them (rab7A and rab7B) are preferably expressed in leaves, one (rabt7C) is most
abundantly expressed in root nodules especially in middle stages of development and the fourth (rab7D) is constitutively expressed, representing a putative housekeeping gene. Mazel et al. [101] reported that one of the
Arabidopsis thaliana Rab7 genes (AtRabG3e) showed higher
expression in older roots and was induced during programmed cell death after treatment of intact leaves with
superoxide and salicylic acid or infection with necrogenic
pathogens. Transgenic plants that expressed this gene also
showed increased tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses
and a reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species
during salt stress. It was also found that expression of
Rab7 gene both from Oryza sativa (OsRab7) and Pennisetum glaucum (PgRab7) was differentially regulated by various environmental stimuli such as cold, NaCl,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

dehydration and plant hormones [103,104]. Overexpression of PgRab7 gene enhanced tolerance to both ionic and
osmotic stress in transgenic tobacco. It seems that at least
some Rab7 isoforms are involved in developing tolerance
towards salinity and dehydration in plants.
Our comparisons of plant EST fractions also showed differentiated expression profiles. We observed interesting
relationships between the EST number of plant Rab7 proteins and the assignment of a given gene to a particular
phylogenetic lineage (Table S5 in Additional file 6). Highest expression levels show genes clustered in the lineage 3,
moderate levels show genes grouped in the lineage 2 and
the lowest levels genes from the lineage 1. Moreover, we
observed some organ-dependent expression patterns. The
gene At.19280 has a significantly (p = 0.02) higher
number of ESTs isolated from root than the gene At.24625
(13 ESTs vs. 1 EST) although these genes show indistinguishable global expression level (p = 0.38) and belong to
the same phylogenetic lineage. Some organ-dependence
expression pattern is indicated in this case. Actually,
Mazel et al. [101] found the higher expression of the
former gene in roots.
Less clear are expansions of Rab7 proteins in unicellular
eukaryotes. Several explanations were proposed with reference to the whole Rab family [2,18,20]. Many Rab7 copies can be the result of large or whole genome duplication
events and can be correlated with a highly complex
endomembrane system or amoeboid lifestyle. Moreover,
this phenomenon could be associated with the different
possible substrates that are endocytosed by the parasite
requiring a larger number of distinct cargo adaptors. On
the other hand, the expansion of Rab7 proteins in single
celled eukaryotes may be due to generation of diversity at
the genome level instead of the transcriptome level since
introns giving rise to different protein products by alternative splicing are rare in majority of these cells. These
unique Rab GTPases may represent lineage-specific innovations similar to some other proteins involved in endocytosis [105].
Rab7 genes present in genomes of unicellular eukaryotes
probably diversified into functionally and spatiotemporally different isoforms. Such a case was experimentally
proven in Entamoeba histolytica [36,106,107] in which two
Rab7 isotypes, EhRab7A and EhRab7B, showed distinct
localisation and roles in biogenesis of lysosomes and
phagosomes. EhRab7B is localised to late endosomes/lysosome and is involved in the formation and/or fusion to
lysosomes, whereas EhRab7A is associated with the postGolgi compartment containing cargos destined for lysosomes, and involved in fusion to late endosomes. Moreover, EhRab7 isotypes (EhRab7A-E) showed remarkable
time- and stage-dependent recruitment to phagosomes

Page 10 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:101

during maturation indicating their sequential and coordinated influence on phagosome biogenesis.
Additionally, some other factors should be considered in
the case of parasitic unicellular eukaryotes such as adaptive pressure that may increase the number of unique protein families including also that of Rab proteins.
Trypanosomatid genomes encode approximately 20 Rab
proteins including a group of three trypanosomatid
unique Rabs and their functions have not been fully elucidated [17,108]. The authors point out to adaptive pressures placed upon these organisms to meet the demands
of specialized host environments as well as a deep divergence due to early separation from model systems.
Since Rab proteins are important components of the
endocytic network and are regulatory and signalling proteins interacting with many other proteins, the preservation of many copies is well suited to 'gene-balance' or a
dosage constraint hypothesis. This hypothesis states that
dosage-sensitive genes are preferentially retained after
whole genome duplications rather than in cumulative
small-scale gene duplications, especially if these genes
cooperate in the same complex regulatory or interaction
pathway and network [109-111]. In agreement with that
Aury and coworkers [92] observed a clear co-retention of
Rab GTP-ases with GTPase Activating Proteins (Supplementary Fig. S13 in [92]).
Our results indicate that new groups and paralogous of
Rab7/Rab9 proteins emerged in the course of evolution of
many lineages. Some Rab7 and Rab9 proteins acquired
new experimentally proven specialized functions. The
results also showed clear differences in expression
between genes of particular subgroups of Rab7 and Rab9
proteins. However, additional experimental studies are
required to determine detailed function for the particular
Rab7 and Rab9 gene copies and to further assess the
relationship between their expression and tissue, organ or
development stage.
Structural features of Rab7 and Rab9 sequences
In order to compare structural elements in sequences of
different subgroups of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins we aligned
consensus sequences generated from HMM profiles based
on respective multiple sequence alignments (Figure 6). In
this study we compared ten sets of the following proteins:
Rab9, Rab7c, Rab7b and Rab7a dividing them into seven
taxonomic subgroups. In Figure 6 we highlighted different
conserved and unique sequence elements, motifs and sites
that are responsible for interactions of Rab proteins with
various regulators and effectors (see for review:
[9,14,21,112,113]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

Ras- and Rab-conserved motifs
The most conserved regions, present not only in Rab proteins but also in other members of the Ras superfamily,
contain six motifs: three (named G1 to G3) involved in
guanine nucleotide binding and three (termed PM1 to
PM3) responsible for binding and coordination magnesium ion with phosphates groups. These motifs are also
conserved across the analysed sequences. Almost 85% of
their sites are occupied by residues conserved in 100%
across the alignment according to the BLOSUM62 matrix.
Extensive comparative sequence analysis revealed also the
presence of five Rab-conserved motifs (called RabF1 to
RabF5), which may be used to designate this family
[14,21]. In the analysed set, almost 60% of their sites are
occupied by 100%-conserved residues. Some deviations
from the full conservation observed in conserved motifs
concern in almost all cases the substitutions that do not
change the properties of the amino acid residues. The
RabF1, -F3 and -F4 motifs are placed in two switch regions
or in their neighbourhood. The regions are characteristic
for small GTPases and correspond to flexible domains
(loops) that substantially change their conformation
upon exchange between GDP and GTP.
Regions specific for particular Rab subfamilies
Apart from the regions conserved for all Rab proteins, four
other regions specific for particular subfamilies of Rab
were identified [14,21,114]. They were named RabSF1 to
RabSF4. These motifs show clear variation between Rab
subfamilies and can be regarded as unique characteristics
for each Rab subfamily. Both RabF and RabSF motifs are
involved in simultaneous interaction with different regulators and effectors. It is postulated that they bind to RabF
regions to discriminate between active/inactive nucleotide-bound conformations and simultaneously interact
with RabSF regions for specificity. Determination of several structures of Rab proteins with their regulators or
effectors revealed that in such interactions participate
switch and interswitch regions, RabSF1, -SF3 motifs and
CDRs (complementary-determining regions, overlapping
RabSF1, -SF3 and -SF4 motifs) [115-119]. Moreover, all
four RabSFs, RabF1 and -F4 motifs turned out to be
important in correct subcellular targeting and functioning
of many Rab GTPases in hybrid experiments exchanging
these domains between different Rab proteins [120-124].
Therefore, we should expect potential differences between
subgroups of Rab7/Rab9 proteins just in these above
mentioned regions. Actually, in the analysed set, only
32% of RabSF1, RabSF2 and RabSF3 sites are occupied by
100%-conserved residues and none in the case of RabSF4.
Moreover, the CDRs also show a very low level of conservation across the analysed alignment (Figure 6).

In Figure 6 we also marked seven regions, numbered from
I to VII that show substantial conformational variation

Figure 6
Alignment of consensus sequences for Rab9 and different subgroups of Rab7 proteins
Alignment of consensus sequences for Rab9 and different subgroups of Rab7 proteins. Cap/Mon denotes Capsaspora/Monosiga. Highly conserved residues (with p ≥ 0.5) are shown in upper case and others are presented in lower case. Particular residues are shaded according to their levels of conservation in the alignment. Secondary structure consensuses for
Rab7 and Rab9 proteins are shown below the alignment. Particular secondary structure elements are denoted by: H (α-helix),
G (310-helix), E (extended β-sheet), B (β-bridge), S (bend), T (turn), – (nonregular states and loops). The symbols of secondary
structure elements are shown in different typefaces according to their frequency in the compared structures and α-helices and
β-strands are marked with colored boxes. Different motifs, sequence elements and structural features related to Rab proteins
are highlighted: G1 to G3 (conserved motifs involved in guanine nucleotide binding); PM1 to PM3 (conserved motifs responsible for binding and coordination Mg2+ with phosphates groups); RabF1 to RabF5 (Rab family specific motifs); RabSF1 to RabSF4
(regions specific for particular subfamilies of Rab GTPases); switch I and II (flexible domains that substantially change their conformation upon exchange between GDP and GTP); hypervariable domain (HVD, unstructured region showing the highest level
of sequence divergence among Rab proteins); PR (C-terminal prenylation motif); CDRI to CDRIII (complementary-determining
regions); I to VII (seven regions showing substantial conformational variation among structures superimposed with Rab9 [53]).
Some sites involved in interaction with regulators and effectors are pointed out above the alignment. Two key hydrophobic
residues in the HVD region that make important contacts of Ypt1 with GDI [125] and Rab7 with REP1 [116] are marked with
arrows. Other sites of Rab7 interacting with REP1 [116] are marked with *. Sites involved in the interaction of Rab7 with RILP
are marked with # and # if their role was additionally confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis [119]. Another important site
revealed by Harrison et al. [41] is marked with:.

among structures of Rab proteins when superimposed
with Rab9 [53]. Figure 6 includes also marked sites
involved in interaction with regulators and effectors
[41,116,119]. They usually fall into less conserved regions
in the alignment. 100% conserved-sites constitute only
23% of the former regions and 38% of the sites involved
in the interactions. Such variation suggests that these less
conserved sites may be responsible for interaction with
different regulators or effectors and differentiation of Rab
functions.
C-terminal region
Rab proteins exhibit also a characteristic C-terminal prenylation motif that differs from the motifs found in Ras
and Rho families, i.e. CAAX, where C denote cysteine, A –
aliphatic residue and X – any residue [14]. The majority of
Rab prenylation motifs, needed for the addition of geranylgeranyl groups and attachment of a protein to a membrane, occur in one of the exemplary combinations:
XXCC, XCCX, CCXX, CCXXX or XCXC. Such two cysteines
motifs were also found in all full Rab sequences analysed
in this study. Interestingly, most amoebozoan Rab7a proteins, all Rab7b and all Rab9 sequences possessed motifs
with two immediately adjacent cysteines while most
sequences of other groups usually comprised motifs with
Cs separated by one not conserved residue.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

experiments replacing the region between different Rab
proteins showed their incorrect targeting [120-123]. However, recent analyses revealed that the hypervariable
region did not represent a general targeting domain and
the Rab-effectors/regulators interaction is likely more
complex and involves additional domains [124].
Sites discriminating different subgroups of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins
Detailed inspection of the alignment enabled us to identify individual sites containing non-conservative substitutions discriminating Rab7 and Rab9 subfamilies. For
example, position 37 in the Rab9 consensus is occupied
by aspartic acid whereas in Rab7 dominate hydroxylated
residues. Moreover, hydrophobic and aromatic phenylalanine at position 41 of Rab9 consensus aligns with polar,
mostly basic residues while valine at position 115 corresponds to prolines in other Rab proteins. Rab7b and
Rab7c proteins contain at position 8 aspartic acid and histidine, negatively- and positively-charged residues, respectively, while other subgroups comprise uncharged,
hydrophobic leucine. Furthermore, basic histidine at
position 42 of Rab9 GTPases is aligned with small polar
threonine of Rab7b consensus while tiny alanines are
present in consensuses of other subgroups. Similarly, at
position 77 of Rab9 consensus is basic arginine, whereas
this position is occupied by hydrophobic valine in Rab7b
proteins and by glycine in other subgroups. The residues
discriminating Rab9 are placed in switch regions. In agreement, the greatest structural dissimilarity between Rab7
and Rab9 structures was just found in active switch conformations [126].

Immediately upstream of the prenylation site is located an
unstructured hypervariable domain (HVD), that contains
the RabSF4 motif and shows the highest level of sequence
divergence among Rab proteins [122]. This region is also
poorly conserved in analysed subgroups of Rab7/Rab9
proteins and is quite short (26 to 32 amino acid residues).
It is assumed that shorter domains are bound more tightly
to the surface of GDI (cytosol-resided GDP dissociation
inhibitor responsible for sequestering a Rab protein in
cytosol from membrane). The only conserved sites in the
HVD region are occupied by two hydrophobic residues
[112]. They make important contacts of Ypt1 with GDI
[125] and Rab7 with REP1, an escort protein responsible
for delivery of the GDP-Rab to an appropriate membrane
[116]. Such two hydrophobic residues were found by us
in the analysed sequences of Rab7/Rab9 proteins. Other
interesting features of HVD is its high content of glycine
and proline residues, that contribute to helix breakage
and are responsible for generation of the extended structure important for GDI binding [125], prenylation of Rab
GTPases [116] and probably other protein interactions.
Interestingly, such residues are moderately present only in
Rab7a proteins upstream of two hydrophobic residues
and prenylation motifs but are absent from consensuses
of Rab7b, Rab7c and Rab9 proteins.

Based on the Rab records retrieved from the PDB database
[127] we calculated consensuses of secondary structure for
Rab7a and Rab9 proteins (Figure 6). The only significant
difference concerns the presence of the short α-helix
flanked by 310-helices in the switch II region of Rab9. Due
to such a structure a hydrophobic tetrad is formed resembling an effector-discriminating epitope [118]. This tetrad
may contribute to differentiated recognition of effectors
by these proteins.

The great variation of HVD suggests that this region is pivotal for Rab proteins localisation [122]. Actually, hybrid

The signal for the specific role and localisation of various
Rab proteins is probably complex, involves many regions

Wittmann and Rudolph [118] and Lal et al. [18] identified
in CDRII/RabSF3 region four-residue insertion in Rab9
and Rab7 GTPases compared to other Rab proteins. The
insertion renders the loop in this region more flexible
[118]. However, the insertion can not be a unique feature
of Rab7 and Rab9 proteins because we found it also in
Rab29, Rab32 and Rab38 GTPases that are closely related
to them. On the other hand, Rab7b proteins have a
unique deletion (of one residue) at position 115 in comparison with other subgroups.

and could be achieved by relatively small differences in
their structures. The identified non-conserved regions and
structural dissimilarities of Rab7/Rab9 proteins may be a
good starting point to further functional and structural
studies.

Conclusion
Rab7 proteins are widely distributed in almost all supergroups of Eukaryota and likely evolved before the radiation of eukaryotes. Rab9 proteins have more narrow
taxonomic distribution and diverged from Rab7 GTPases
before divergence of choanoflagellates and metazoans.
The Rab proteins were additionally duplicated in vertebrates (Rab7 and Rab9) and in higher plants (Rab7).
Interestingly, some representatives of excavates, ciliates
and amoebozoans also comprise a substantial number of
Rab7 copies. The emergence of the Rab9 subfamily and
the subsequent duplication of genes encoding Rab7 and
Rab9 may suggest their functional diversification and specialization. Actually, for some of these proteins such functions were already found and distinct expression levels
were determined for different Rab genes. Apart from preserved conserved regions and motifs typical of Rab family,
Rab7/Rab9 proteins have non-conserved sequences and
structural features, that may be responsible for diversification of their functions and interactions with effectors and
regulators. Rab7/Rab9 GTPases show concordant diversification at the phylogenetic, expression and sequence/
structural levels. The obtained results are good starting
point to further detail experimental studies which should
fully determine functional specialization of these GTPases
and relationship of their expression to tissue, organ,
development stage or environmental response.

Methods
Collection of sequences and alignments construction
The analysed set of 210 sequences was obtained by thorough and detailed searches of public databases: GenBank
[128], UniProt [129] and TBestDB [130] based on
sequence annotation and similarity searches made by
BLAST. Sequences annotated as Rab7 or Rab9 or
sequences showing significant similarity to these proteins
were included in the set. The membership of these
sequences to the particular Rab subfamilies (Rab7:
cd01862 or Rab9: cd04116) was verified based on Conserved Domain Database (CDD) searches [131]. Misannotated sequences were described in details in Additional
file 7. Incomplete and redundant sequences were
removed from the final set. We also included in the analyses four human sequences representing Rab23, Rab29,
Rab32 and Rab38 subfamilies. These subfamilies show
the closest relationship to Rab7 and Rab9 subfamilies
among all Rab subfamilies [5,14] and therefore we chose
them as an out-group in phylogenetic analyses. Accession

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

numbers of all sequences used in the analyses are shown
in Additional file 1.
All amino acid alignments were obtained in the MAFFT
program using slow and accurate algorithm L-INS-i with
1000 cycles of iterative refinement [132]. Nucleotide
sequences of selected subgroups of Rab proteins were
aligned based on corresponding amino acid alignments.
All resulting alignments were edited manually and corrected in GeneDoc [133] and the sites suitable for further
phylogenetic analyses were extracted from the alignments
with Gblocks 0.91b assuming less stringent criteria [134].
As a result, variable and poorly aligned sites, mainly in Nand C-terminal ends, were omitted from final alignments
used in phylogenetic analyses. Gaps both in amino acid
and nucleotide sets were treated as missing data by the
applied phylogenetic programs.
In the preliminary studies we inferred trees from different
data sets: the whole alignments (as they were in databases) and alignments with exclusion of all the sites containing at least one gap (complete-deletion approach). We
also performed alignments with different number of
excluded gaps. However, such data did not improve
obtained phylogenies. Finally, we relied on more objective result of GBlocks and some manual corrections.
Phylogenetic analyses
In phylogenetic analyses based on the set of 210 aligned
amino acid sequences, we applied the JTT+I+Γ substitution model (seven rate categories) as proposed by the
ProtTest program 1.4 [135] according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the second-order AIC and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In the case of the
aligned nucleotide sequences of selected subgroups of
Rab GTPases, we used separate models for each codon
position: GTR+I+Γ or GTR+Γ as were suggested by Modeltest [136] according to the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC).

To find a tree close to optimal and avoid a trap of local
optimum in global tree searches, the tree for 210 amino
acid sequences was sought in several stages. At first, the
maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed in
PHYML [137] and the neighbour joining (NJ) tree was
inferred in the neighbour program from the PHYLIP package 3.67 [138] based on the JTT+I+Γ(7) distance matrix
calculated in Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [139]. Next, a set of 1000
start tree topologies was generated in TreeFinder [140]
assuming the resulting ML and NJ tree as center trees. We
generated 100 trees for each of five topological distances:
7, 10, 15, 20 and 25 NNI steps for each of these two center
trees. We imposed topological constraints on the generated trees fixing such phylogenetic relationships that were
supported by bootstrap values equal to or higher than

Page 14 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:101

75% in a bootstrap tree. The bootstrap tree for the
approach with the ML center tree was the consensus of
1000 ML trees calculated in PHYML whereas the bootstrap
tree for the approach with the NJ center tree was the consensus of 1000 NJ trees calculated in the neighbour program based on JTT+I+Γ(7) distance matrices obtained in
Tree-Puzzle. The 1000 generated trees were used as start
ones for global tree search in PHYML (now with none
constraints). We also conducted analyses with the NJ tree
and the default BIONJ start tree in this program. The
selected top 25 best topologies according to the maximum
likelihood value were again used as start trees to PHYML,
and subsequent iterations were carried out until the maximum likelihood value of resulting trees did not increase.
The obtained best tree regarded as the final tree is presented in Figure 1 and in Additional file 1. Edge support
of the tree was assessed by the aforementioned bootstrap
analysis based on ML and NJ method assuming 1000 replicates and the local rearrangement paired-sites method
(LRSH) with 1000 replicates made in TreeFinder.
Additionally, for amino acid alignments, we applied two
programs: PhyloBayes [60], Bayesian approach and
PhyML-CAT [61], maximum likelihood approach that use
a mixture model describing across-site heterogeneities in
the amino acid replacement patterns. In PhyloBayes analysis, two independent Markov chains were run for 600
000 cycles assuming the CAT+Γ model with number of
components, weights and profiles inferred from the data
and five discrete categories for gamma distributed rates.
After getting a convergence, the last 50 000 trees from each
chain were collected to compute posterior consensus in
MrBayes [141] (see Additional file 4). For PhyML-CAT
analysis, the tree was inferred with the CAT+I+Γ model
assuming 30 profile mixture categories, five rate categories
and SPR heuristic search algorithm. Edge support was
assessed by the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT)
based on χ2 and Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure
[142]. The minimum of these two support values was
shown at nodes in the tree (see Additional file 5).
Phylogenetic trees based on aligned nucleotide sequences
of selected subgroups of Rab proteins were inferred in the
TreeFinder [140] and MrBayes 3.1.2 programs [141]
assuming separate models of substitutions GTR+I+Γ or
GTR+Γ for three codon positions. Seven and five rate categories in the maximum likelihood (TreeFinder) and the
Bayesian (MrBayes) approach were assumed, respectively.
Edge support of the trees was assessed in TreeFinder by the
bootstrap analysis and the local rearrangement pairedsites method (LRSH), each assuming 1000 replicates. In
the Bayesian inference of phylogeny we applied two
simultaneous independent runs starting from random
trees using 5 Markov chains. Trees were sampled every 100
generations from 50 million generations. In the final anal-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/101

ysis we selected trees from, depending on the analysed
subgroup of Rab proteins, from the last 18 to 25 million
generations that reached stationary phase with the average
standard deviation of split frequencies much below the
value 0.01. The temperature parameter (Temp) was properly adjusted to improve efficiency of analysis and get
convergence.
The topology of the tree based on 210 amino acid
sequences was compared with the alternative topology
according to the approximately unbiased test (AU) and
Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KH, WKH) carried out in the
Consel v0.1i program [143] assuming ten million replicates. We also used two nonparametric paired-sites tests:
sign and Wilcoxon matched pairs test implemented in Statistica software [144]. Site-wise log-likelihoods for the
analysed trees were calculated in Tree-Puzzle under the
JTT+I+Γ model and assumption of seven rate categories.
In this analysis, we considered seven sets of sites that were
created by successive elimination of sites with the highest
substitution rate in the given set.
We assumed a full optimization of model parameters in
all the above analyses with the exception of calculation of
1000 distance matrices performed in Tree-Puzzle based
on bootstrapped alignments when the parameters estimated for the real alignment were applied.
Testing saturation and compositional homogeneity of
nucleotide sequences
To estimate level of saturation in analysed sequences we
applied method developed by Xia et al. [145] implemented in DAMBE [146]. The testing showed that there is
a little saturation in the whole alignment for each of four
analysed nucleotide data sets.

Homogeneity of nucleotide composition of each
sequence in a given set was analysed by χ2 test in R package [147] with p-value computed by Monte Carlo simulation to give more reliable results. In each of four sets only
a few sequences (from 3 to 7) showed deviation from
other sequences. Moreover, the significance of these differences was not very high because the p-values were
about 0.02 and 0.03. Additionally, these deviated
sequences were usually scattered over the tree and do not
tend to group together. However, if some of them were
clustered in the gene trees, they also were grouped in protein trees. Therefore such grouping does not result from a
deviated nucleotide composition but rather from the
common origin. We also compared GC content between
different well defined subclades of the gene trees by
Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc pairwise Wilcoxon test but
we found only one weakly significant difference between
Rab7b clade and Choanoflagellida & Capsaspora clade
with p-value = 0.042.

Consensus sequences and secondary structure
The HMMER 2.3.2 software [148] was used to generate
consensus sequences for Rab9 and different subgroups of
Rab7 proteins from HMM profiles that were calculated for
respective multiple sequences alignments. The alignment
of consensus sequences was prepared in GeneDoc with
the aid of alignments of original sequences obtained in
MAFFT (see Collection of sequences and alignments
section).

Comparison of expression level of Rab7 and Rab9 genes
Data on expression profiles coming from analysis of EST
counts for particular Rab7 and Rab9 genes were downloaded from UniGene database [100]. Frequencies of Rab
ESTs were compared by the test of proportions and the
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons procedure for
controlling false discovery rate was used. These statistical
analyses were conducted in the R package [147].

Tests of tree topologies. Result of statistical tests comparing topologies of
the obtained Rab7/Rab9 gene phylogeny with the species phylogeny. These
analyses showed that when fast evolving sites are excluded from the data,
the hypothesis assuming relationships between Rab proteins agreeable with
species phylogeny can not be rejected or even is favoured.
