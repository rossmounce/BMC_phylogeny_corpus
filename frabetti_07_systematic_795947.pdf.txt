Abstract
Background: All standard methods for cDNA cloning are affected by a potential inability to
effectively clone the 5' region of mRNA. The aim of this work was to estimate mRNA open reading
frame (ORF) 5' region sequence completeness in the model organism Danio rerio (zebrafish).
Results: We implemented a novel automated approach (5'_ORF_Extender) that systematically
compares available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with all the zebrafish experimentally
determined mRNA sequences, identifies additional sequence stretches at 5' region and scans for
the presence of all conditions needed to define a new, extended putative ORF. Our software was
able to identify 285 (3.3%) mRNAs with putatively incomplete ORFs at 5' region and, in three
example cases selected (selt1a, unc119.2, nppa), the extended coding region at 5' end was cloned
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Conclusion: The implemented method, which could also be useful for the analysis of other
genomes, allowed us to describe the relevance of the "5' end mRNA artifact" problem for genomic
annotation and functional genomic experiment design in zebrafish.

Background
The amino acid sequence of gene products is routinely
deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the relative
cloned cDNA, according to rules for recognition of start
codon (first-AUG rule, optimal sequence context) and the
genetic code [1,2]. The identification of a more complete

mRNA 5' end could reveal an additional upstream AUG –
in-frame with the previously determined one and in the
optimal context – thus extending the predicted amino terminus sequence of the product. We have previously used
the term "5' end mRNA artifact" to refer to the incorrect
assignment of the first AUG codon in an mRNA sequence,

due to the incomplete determination of the mRNA 5' end
sequence [3]. The putative translation start based on
incomplete mRNA sequence may lead to incorrect prediction of the product amino acid sequence, and to subsequent errors in the experimental cloning and functional
assay of the relative cDNA.
Danio rerio (zebrafish) is a model organism that has
gained popularity for its high suitability for functional
genomic experiments. The zebrafish genome project is
currently in progress, and about 8,000 mRNAs (out of an
estimated 25,000) have been characterized and catalogued in the RefSeq database (available on December
31st, 2005). Gene overexpression, gene localization and
knock-down protocols are routinely performed on this
animal [4], requiring knowledge of the complete open
reading frame (ORF) present in the mRNA under study.
Moreover, inhibition of expression of specific mRNAs is
commonly now achieved by gene knockdown antisense
morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) [5], that inhibit
translation in a specific manner and are typically targeted
against the sequence surrounding the first-AUG codon of
the mRNA. Although methods to determine the complete
mRNA ORF have been developed, such as 5' cap trapping
[6] and cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) [7], they
are experimentally intensive and they have not been
applied to the zebrafish mRNA on a large scale.
The aim of this study was to implement a novel automated approach(5'_ORF_Extender software) able to systematically compare all available expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) with all Danio rerio experimentally determined
mRNA sequences, to identify additional sequence
stretches at the mRNA 5' region. The software then scans
for the presence of all conditions needed to define a new
extended putative ORF: presence of a new first AUGcodon in-frame with the previously described first-AUG,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/34

and lack of any in-frame stop between the newly identified and the old first-AUG codons. This required highthroughput sequence analysis performed on a processor
cluster and the development of an original relational database able to integrate and analyze data from EST
sequences, RefSeq mRNA coding sequences and their relative sequence comparison tabulated results. The software
analyzed all the 8,528 Danio rerio mRNAs from the RefSeq
database (available on December 31st, 2005), and was
able to identify 285 (3.3%) mRNAs with putatively
incomplete ORFs at 5' region (Figure 1). Using RT-PCR
and automated sequencing, it was, in fact, found that in
three example cases (selt1a, unc119.2, nppa) the coding
region at 5' end was incompletely characterized in the
originally published descriptions, leading to incorrect predictions for the amino acid sequence of Danio rerio selenoprotein T 1a, unc-119 homolog 2 and natriuretic peptide
precursor A.
The 5'_ORF_Extender software allow us to show that 5'
end mRNA artifact is not a rare event in the analysis of the
zebrafish genome. The implemented method could also
be useful for the analysis of other genomes.

Results
Database construction and computational analysis
The high-throughput BLAST analysis generated 1,189,412
BLAST hit lines for the 8,528 investigated zebrafish
mRNAs compared with the Danio rerio EST database. The
merged file containing all results was imported into the
5'_ORF_Extender software.

Following calculations executed by the 5'_ORF_Extender
software, it was possible to obtain candidate extended
coding regions at 5' end from 1,346 BLAST hits, using the
criteria described in the "Methods" section. This corresponded to 285 distinct zebrafish mRNAs. The mean

number of EST sequences that allowed the extension of
one mRNA sequence was 4.7, with 141 mRNAs being
extended by more than one EST. The data table with complete results for the 1,346 positive BLAST hits
(Dr_extended_ORF.txt) is provided as supplemental online material along with the software distribution [8].
The mean size of the additional ORF stretch was 67.7
bases, with a standard deviation of 63.7 bases (range:
3–432 bases). Automated results relative to the HC21homolog zebrafish mRNA test set fully agreed with results
of manual analysis.
Due to the process flow of the software, which tests all
existent upstream in-frame ATG in the mRNA-extending
EST stretch, extended ORFs are detected also in the case of
the simultaneous existence of a small ORF upstream of a
potential new ATG (upstream ORF or uORF) [9].
In vitro cloning and sequencing of the mRNA 5' region
Three example genes (selt1a, unc119.2 and nppa) were
chosen for the experimental test aimed at verifying the
existence of the extended ORF bases in real zebrafish
mRNAs, following these criteria: identification of at least
two EST sequences showing the extended ORF, presence
of at least one published report about the corresponding
mRNA, and predicted product extension of at least 30
amino acids.

A cDNA corresponding to the predicted additional coding
region was obtained for each of the investigated genes.
The nucleotide sequences were deposited in the GenBank

database under accession numbers: DQ650637 for
unc119.2 gene, DQ660904 for selt1a gene, DQ787202 for
nppa gene.
The extended coding sequences for selt1a, unc119.2 and
nppa were analyzed using the BLAST program to compare
them with known nucleotide and amino acid sequences
deposited at NCBI databases. The nucleotide and amino
acid analysis data are summarized in Table 1.
The newly found translational start codons all show a better consensus with the Kozak sequence. The amino acid
sequences predicted at the amino terminus in these three
cases did not show new known functional domains
through database searches. The coding nature of these
upstream bases was further confirmed by phylogenetic
comparison at amino acid level in the case of nppa product (Figure 2).

Discussion
The problem of completeness of mRNAs in order to
define at least one complete ORF is a well known topic in
molecular biology and genomics [10]. Anecdotal evidence
of the presence of a further extension of mRNA 5' end
sequence, with consequent correction of the previously
accepted predicted product, was randomly found for single genes. In addition, several studies have estimated that
the percentage of possible mRNA coding sequence incompleteness in whole genome may be in the range of 4–5%
[3,11], and the analysis of 90,000 human 5'-end-enriched
cDNA clones has indicated that ~380 known gene models
could be extended at their 5'-end [12]. Relevant conse-

quences may arise from the incomplete prediction of the
gene products and they have previously been described
[3].
We wondered if errors consistent with the 5' end artifact
might be present in other genomes. We then decided to
systematically analyze the extent of completeness of the
whole set of known mRNAs described in zebrafish, for the
relevance in the design of post-genomic experiments, for
the recent availability of most mRNA and genome
zebrafish sequences, and for the relatively small size of the
EST species-specific database section (about 10% of the
human section), which could represent a suitable starting
point for the feasibility of the development of new tools.
Our new systematic and automated approach to the 5'
end mRNA artifact makes use of the first type of software
able to automatically integrate large volumes of mRNA
sequence data, EST sequence data, and sequence comparison data with respect to existent and possible initiation
codons in order to generate EST-driven models of 5' ORF
extension on a genomic scale. In particular, it integrates
EST analysis aimed at extending the current mRNA

sequence with the known mRNA translation frame,
thereby differing from other methods which do not incorporate prediction of the ORF extension [e.g. [13]]. This
software allowed us to improve on our first manual
sequence analysis performed in a subset of zebrafish genes
with homology to HC21 human loci (data not shown),
and to quickly obtain a useful list of putative incomplete
ORFs in zebrafish. The software can run on both Mac OS
X and Windows operated personal computers and it is
available for free for anyone to use and modify. A limit of
the software is that it is focused only on the plus/plus
alignments (i.e. with sequences in the same orientation)
in the generation of the extended mRNA models. However, most ESTs are directionally cloned cDNAs, and it is
likely that this limit only slightly lowers the sensitivity of
the program. This implies that the actual proportion of
mRNAs with incomplete ORFs may be even larger than
estimated here, also considering that sensitivity of the
method depends on the EST repertoire available at the
moment of the analysis.
Genomic browsers continuously scan deposited
sequences and try to build mRNA models. They employ

different methods and algorithms, however they appear
not to systematically address the item we discuss. Following comparison of our three example confirmed mRNAs
(nppa, selt1a and unc119.2), with data available in NCBI
Map Viewer, UCSC Genome Browser and EBI Ensembl,
we found that none of these present the extended models
we have determined and validated. A prediction consistent with our results was found only for unc119.2 and only
in NCBI (predicted sequence XM_697866). We conclude
that our approach is not included in the pipeline of these
reference map browsers and it is the first able to generate,
on a large scale, extended models of the actual 5' ORF.
A total of 285 genes, out of the 8,528 zebrafish gene-set,
have been recognized as candidates for extension. It is
strongly supposed that mRNAs for which more than one
EST was found leading to the same prediction, possess a
longer ORF than that described. Three representative
mRNAs were extended, demonstrating a new coding tract
and thus identifying an open reading frame with extra
amino acids to those reported by the Authors who originally described these genes: selt1a (supported by 24 consistent ESTs), unc119.2 (supported by 4 consistent ESTs)
and nppa (supported by 26 consistent ESTs). In these
cases, both of the following conditions occurred: an
extension of described exon 1 predicted new coding
codons upstream of the known AUG; and a novel AUG
was present upstream of these codons, in-frame with the
previously described AUG and without any intervening
stop codon. Following the rules of translation initiation
[1,2], the actual coding sequence should be considered as
that included between the novel "first-AUG" and the
known stop. However, our identification of the most
upstream currently definable AUG start codon does not
exclude that a downstream AUG codon may also be used
by the ribosome, due to the phenomenon of alternative
translation [14,15]. It should also be noted that this type
of analysis cannot formally exclude that the extended ORF
may derive from alternative transcription starting site
and/or splicing of the investigated locus. The coding
nature of these upstream bases is further confirmed by
phylogenetic comparison at amino acid level with several
species in the case of nppa product (Figure 2) and with T.
nigroviridis in the case of unc119.2, making it unlikely that
extension is due to alternative transcription of the gene.
Therefore the predicted product for these three zebrafish
genes should be redefined for functional studies.
Many extended mRNAs in our list derive from the largescale cDNA sequencing project, but for a number of these
mRNAs, publication of the sequence as well as molecular
biology experiments based on this sequence were
reported. Regarding the cases that we have studied in
detail, selt1a mRNA incompleteness was without consequences in the article by Thisse et al. [16]. In this article,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/34

selt1a cDNA clones are used as in situ hybridization
probes, which are sufficiently specific, even if partial.
Regarding unc119.2, Manning et al. [17] described a predicted product (named zfunc119b) which appeared to be
the shortest among the UNC-119 highly conserved metazoan family of proteins they reconstructed, but it actually
lacks the additional coding sequence at 5' we describe
here. This led to MO knockdown experiment design referring to the putative, incorrect translation start codon.
Although it is unlikely that this may have significantly
affected the resulting "curly tail down" phenotype (joined
with a constellation of neuronal defects similar to those
seen in C. elegans unc-119 mutants), MO canonical
method requires targeting the first actual translational
start codon. Finally, Berdougo et al. [18] described the
nppa mRNA sequence in zebrafish, encoding natriuretic
peptide, an important hormone involved in the control of
body fluid volume, produced by the heart. These Authors
assembled a consensus cDNA sequence from the ESTs
available at the time, with incomplete 5' region. Although
this information was only used to design hybridization
probes for the study of mRNA expression, the predicted
nppa product lacks 33 amino acids at the amino terminus
that are conserved among different fish and also in some
mammals (Figure 2).

Conclusion
This study has presented a novel high-throughput strategy
to search for mRNA sequence incompleteness by generating new mRNA models via EST and RefSeq database integrated analysis. Our findings in the Danio rerio underline
the need for accurate analysis of mRNA and protein
sequences when planning functional experiments in this
model organism, with regard to a significant presence of
the 5' end mRNA artifact in the reported mRNA sequences
for this species. Moreover, the implemented method
could also be useful for the analysis of other genomes.

Methods
Database construction and computational analysis
The 5'_ORF_Extender software was developed to parse RefSeq and EST sequence databases and to make calculations
on the sequences, following the import of BLAST results.
It was developed using FileMaker Pro 8 Advanced (FileMaker, Santa Clara, CA) database management system for
both Windows (2000 or above) and Macintosh (10.3.9 or
above) operating systems, and it is available as a standalone software including the FileMaker runtime. The software is freely available, with a user guide included [8].
Any modification of the software is also allowed, but in
this case the user must purchase the FileMaker application. The software was used on a Power Mac G5 dual processor computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA).

Editing of large text files is required in several steps and we
best performed it using common Unix-like utilities
included in Mac OS X ("tr", "awk", "cat"), available on
any Unix/Linux system. The zebrafish RefSeq flat file, containing all known reference mRNA sequences for Danio
rerio, was downloaded from the NCBI ftp site on December 31st, 2005. A Mac OS X script was developed and run
to format the RefSeq entries for import into the appropriate 5'_ORF_Extender database table (see the software user
guide). The RefSeq table includes calculations aimed at
extracting several key features of the GenBank RefSeq
entry: in particular, LOCUS and 5' UTR length.
The zebrafish EST entries, including all known ESTs for
Danio rerio in the dbEST database, were downloaded from
the NCBI website via Entrez on December 31st, 2005. A
script was run as described above to format the EST entries
for import into a local EST database template. The software includes calculations aimed at extracting the GenBank EST sequence length and the EST entry LOCUS
name, in order to establish relationships useful for the
automated search of ORF extension at mRNA 5' end (see
below).
Each Danio rerio mRNA catalogued in the RefSeq database
(total: 8,528 entries, excluding "XM_" type, non-reviewed
predicted entries) was compared using BLAST software
with all the Danio rerio ESTs present in the EST database.
To automate this process, we ran BLAST 2.2.11 software
on the IBM CLX/1024 cluster at CINECA – High Performance System Center, with expect = 2e-12 (see the software
user guide for details). All comparison data refer to
sequence databases available on December 31st, 2005 as
described above. The BLAST result data files were
imported into the appropriate fields of a FileMaker Pro 8
database template developed for this research
(5'_ORF_Extender). During this import process, relationships were created by the software using the respective
accession number as the key field. These relationships
point to the appropriate fields in either RefSeq or EST
databases, created as described above. This allowed us
(within each record corresponding to a blast hit) to make
some values available which were not present in the
BLAST results table, such as the sequence and length in bp
of 5' UTR RefSeq mRNA "query" sequence, and the
sequence and length in bp of EST "subject" sequence
entry.
A script was then written and executed so as to subsequently: extract the EST sequence stretch upstream of the
matched RefSeq mRNA first base in all BLAST hits showing a 5' extension of the EST sequence with respect to the
known RefSeq sequence; search in this EST stretch for the
most upstream existent ATG in-frame with the described
one in the RefSeq mRNA sequence entry; calculate the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/34

new putative extended coding region (by merging the EST
extended stretch starting from the new ATG with the 5'
UTR of the RefSeq mRNA sequence); confirm the coding
potential of this new extended sequence by excluding the
presence of any in-frame stop codon within it. The software screens RefSeq mRNAs for the presence of an inframe stop codon upstream of the described initiation
codon in the mRNA sequence itself, because this indicates
that the recorded 5' UTR sequence cannot be part of a
longer continuous coding sequence. Consequently, this
subset of mRNAs is analyzed no further.
The script then analyzes only BLAST alignments matching
these criteria: mRNA sequence query "start" position is
"1" and EST subject sequence "start" position is greater
than "1", in order to be sure that only EST sequences containing additional upstream nucleotides with respect to
the known most upstream mRNA sequence are analyzed;
EST subject sequence start position is not greater than the
EST subject sequence "end" position, in order to focus the
analysis on the plus/plus alignments (i.e. with sequences
in the same orientation) in the generation of the extended
mRNA models.
To avoid artifacts due to poor alignments between the
mRNA and the EST sequences, only alignments with a percentage of nucleotide identity equal to or greater than
97% and with a length of the EST sequence aligned with
the mRNA greater than 49% of the total EST length were
selected. These parameters are stringent but they may be
modified by the user if desired. Lowering these values may
allow further identification of extended ORFs when the
mRNA sequence only partly aligns with the EST sequence,
due to the existence of ESTs longer than the whole respective mRNA or to alternative splicing outside the aligned
region, at the risk of possible retrieval of false positive
ORF extensions.
In vitro cloning and sequencing of the mRNA 5' region
An in vitro cloning approach was devised to confirm the
sequence analysis predictions. RT-PCR was performed,
mainly based on amplification of a more complete AUGcontaining first exon, extended from the new putatively
defined 5' UTR and one downstream exon, in order to be
sure that amplified cDNA derives from mRNA.

Total RNA was extracted from ~60 zebrafish embryos at
shield stage, and from the whole body of a 4-month adult,
using the Chomczynski and Sacchi method [19]. Fish and
embryos were maintained in our own facility according to
standard procedures [20].
For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed and
amplified using the appropriate primer pairs. PCR ampli-

fication and sequencing techniques were performed in
standard conditions [3].
The extended coding sequences for selt1a, unc119.2 and
nppa were analyzed using the BLAST program to compare
them with known nucleotide and amino acid sequences
deposited at NCBI databases. The predicted extended
amino acid sequences for the 3 genes were searched for in
several domain databases, such as SMART [21] and CDD
[22], to identify new domains that were not present in the
described gene product. Alignment of the natriuretic peptide sequences from different species was performed using
ClustalW software (version 1.8).

The manuscript concerns an interesting and important
problem of prediction of eukaryotic mRNA 5'-terminal
part and translation start site. The authors prepared a tool
for automatic comparison of EST and cDNA data sets.
Additional information from EST clones allows revealing
5'-ending incomplete cDNAs and correcting them. Some
examples of predicted 5'-end extended Danio rerio cDNAs
were selected and verified experimentally, which proved
usefulness of the method.
In my opinion, the problem of correct prediction of both
5'-end of mRNA and translation start sites is far from
being solved. Accuracy and sensitivity of available computational tools are limited (e.g., Nadershahi et al. Comparison of computational methods for identifying translation

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/34

initiation sites in EST data. BMC Bionformatics. 2004.
5:14). Additional analysis of full-size mRNAs is of importance to reveal new mRNA and protein variants (e.g.,
Casadei et al. mRNA 5'-region sequence incompleteness:
a potential source of systematic errors in translation initiation codon assignment in human mRNAs. Gene 2003 32
185–193; Porcel et al. Numerous novel annotations of the
human genome sequence supported by a 5'-end-enriched
cDNA collection. Genome Res. 2004. 14. 463–471) Thus,
new information and software resources in this field are
valuable.
1) EST data are very frequently used to map the gene structure. As I understand, the approach of Frabetti et al. is
likely to be characterized by less strict limitations on the
EST usage that allowed getting more information in comparison with other investigations. For example, Kitagawa
et al. (Bioinformatics. 2005. 21. 1758–1763) have also
used EST multiple alignment to map mRNA 5'-end (transcription start sites). They removed 10% of 5'-farthest
ESTs as outliers because "...they did not need a large quantity of TSS (transcription start site) datasets but rather
accurate ones". Probably, application of more strict limitations increases accuracy but decreases sensitivity.
Frabetti et al. proved the efficiency of applied criteria
experimentally. However, I would like to know their opinion. Probably, this question may also be discussed in
more detail in the manuscript to address the difference
between the Authors approach and other available tools.
To this point: some comparative (brief) review of different
prediction methods and tools might increase the manuscript quality considerably. It would be also interesting to
know: how many zebrafish gene models corresponding to
these 285 potentially 5'-extended mRNAs (and available
in databanks) coincide with the mRNA model predicted
by the Authors?
Author's response: The aim of this work is not to predict the
mRNA 5'-end and translation star site, but to exploit the currently available EST dataset to improve the present knowledge
about the most complete ORF which can be assigned to a
known mRNA. In this respect, our tool does not start from EST
sequences as in the case of the tools compared in Nadershahi et
al., which work independently of the known reference translation start site, but on the contrary it examines known mRNAs
to verify the possibility of building more extended models at 5'end that include an extension of the currently accepted ORF.
Similarly, the approach described in rice by Kitagawa et al., is
aimed to first create EST clusters, then to identify ORFs, rather
than check completeness of known ORFs. In addition, these
Authors do not release a package for general use of their
method. The work by Kitagawa et al., 2005, has now been
briefly discussed and cited in the third paragraph of the Discussion.

To our knowledge, available software to compute mRNA ORF
models with the best possible ORF 5'-end is included in the
pipelines of the major genome browsers (NCBI MapViewer,
UCSC Genome Browser, Ensembl). We have already shown in
the article that our predicted and experimentally validated
extended models were not computed by these reference map
browsers. As the reviewer suggests, we believe that it is due to
differences in the approaches used. While these programs use
complex computations including statistical analysis to build
their models, our software is more sensitive in the specific task
of mechanically finding any EST which may allow the extension of a known mRNA ORF, considering its already known
translation frame. Searching for potentially 5'-extended
mRNAs into NCBI sequences, including both finished and predicted sequences, only 29 out of the 285 are available to date
(August 2007). In addition, in several cases the extension was
made available only after we had conducted our analysis, due
to the release of new finished (non-EST) sequences in the databases, as in the case of the three mRNAs we have experimentally validated in this work and we ourselves have submitted to
GenBank. A more detailed discussion of this item would require
a systematic comparison of the details of the pipelines used by
the genome browser to build their gene models, which is beyond
the aim of this work. Moreover, the originality of our software
is also in allowing simple large-scale analysis of BLAST results
in a database framework, e.g. producing the subset of all
mRNAs extended by the analysis for a whole transcriptome of
an organism.
The work by Porcel et al., 2004, has been briefly discussed and
cited in the first paragraph of the Discussion.
2) Many eukaryotic genes produce several mRNA variants
with different 5'-ends because of the usage of alternative
promoters and alternative splicing. It was recently evaluated that in mouse transcriptome there were about 1.32 5'
start sites for each 3'-end (The FANTOM consortium et al.
The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.
Science. 2005. 309. 1559–1563). Actually, comparative
analysis of available EST data can be used to reveal mRNA
5'-end heterogeneity. For example, multiple alignment of
5'-EST sequences allowed revealing numerous multiple
transcription start sites and alternative first exones in rice
and mouse (Kitagawa et al. Computational analysis suggests that alternative first exones are involved in tissuespecific transcription in rice. Bioinformatics. 2005. 21.
1758–1763). However, Frabetti et al. considered only the
situation of 5'-end incomplete mRNAs rather than an
opportunity of synthesis of alternative mRNA forms producing different protein isoforms. What is the reason for
such a limitation? May some "artifacts" be just additionally produced alternative forms?
Author's response: Our research simply aimed to identify
cDNA ORF sequences longer than those previously suspected.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/34

The systematic analysis of transcription start sites and/or alternative splicing would obviously require the incorporation of the
whole-genome sequence, provided that it is available for a given
organism, and the development of heavy computations to build
mRNA models accounting for alternative transcription and/or
splicing. This is beyond the aim of this work, and is also probably beyond the capability of the FileMaker Pro software running
on the present personal computers.
Regarding the possibility that an mRNA model extended by our
approach could represent an isoform due to alternative transcription and/or splicing, we cannot formally exclude this possibility. As in the case of any other computer prediction, further
investigation is required, in silico but especially in vitro, for a
fine characterization of the putative model. However, we would
underline that our program adds new sequence information
starting exactly from the first base of the 5' end of a known
mRNA form, revealing coding bases that were previously considered to be untranslated. Actually, if the more complete
sequence had been cloned in the original work, the Authors
would certainly have registered the upstream in-frame AUG as
the start codon. We have added a brief discussion of this item
in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.
3) I also have one comment concerning the prediction of
translation start site (TSS). The Authors used Kozak's rules
to predict the position of start AUG codon (context and 5'proximal position). This is a common method and it may
be used. However, I would like to note that there is a discrepancy between the experimental data and bioinformatics approaches. According to the scanning model, 40S
ribosomal subunits are recruited to the 5'-terminal cap
structure, scan in a 5'- to-3' direction, and can initiate
translation at the first AUG they encounter (Kozak. Regulation of translation via mRNA structure in prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. Gene. 2005. 361. 13–37.). If context of 5'proximal AUG codon is suboptimal, some 40S ribosomal
subunits recognize it as a translational start site, but other
will miss it, continue scanning in 3' direction, and initiate
translation at downstream AUG (leaky scanning). The
usage of alternative translation start sites is quite possible
(some examples were demonstrated experimentally). This
opinion was also recently supported by analysis of interdependency between the TSS context and the presence of
AUG codons at the CDS beginning (Kochetov. AUG
codons at the beginning of protein coding sequences are
frequent in eukaryotic mRNAs with a suboptimal start
codon context. Bioinformatics. 2005 21. 837–840;
Kochetov et al. The role of alternative translation start sites
in generation of human protein diversity. Mol. Genet.
Genomics. 2005. 273. 491–496). Thus, suboptimal AUG
context does not necessarily mean that this AUG is not
used as a start site. This is not a problem of this particular
manuscript: currently most gene prediction programs do

not take into account alternative translation start sites.
This comment does not need a reply.

ESTs used by the authors correspond to transcripts of different genes?

Author's response: We agree that a brief comment about
alternative translation is appropriate, and we have added a sentence and two references in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion about this item.

Author's response: As we note in the Methods section, 97%
of the sequence identity parameter is stringent but it may be
modified by the user if desired. It was chosen considering the
known recurrence of sequencing errors in the EST entries. Actually, we also point out that we allow the option of a constraint
of alignment length and that we used 49% of the total EST
length, empirically determined.

Other comments:
Actually, I am not sure that the Authors need to attract so
much attention to the importance of problem of cDNA 5'end incompleteness: it is quite clear that many cDNAs are
incomplete. It may be more reasonable to concentrate
attention on the methods (and software) to solve this well
known problem rather than emphasize the problem
importance itself.
English language should be improved.
Author's response: In the Introduction and Discussion we
have concentrated our attention on the method to solve the
problem rather than on the known importance of the problem,
as suggested. The English has been revised.
Reviewer's report 2
Dr. Shamil Sunyaev, Harvard Medical School, Boston (MA)

This manuscript contributes to the problem of accurate
annotation of sequenced genomes. The authors argue that
inaccurate determination of transcription starts may lead
to false annotation of translation starts. Using analysis of
EST sequences they identified translation start sites
located 5' of the annotated sites for a few percent of
zebrafish genes. They experimentally prove the existence
of these larger transcripts for three zebrafish genes.
I have a few comments on this version of the manuscript:
1) Eukaryotic transcription start sites are known to be frequently wobbly and sometimes there are alternative sites
which may be tissue or developmental stage specific. Is it
possible that the authors detect alternative starting sites
rather than 5' artifacts? The manuscript would greatly benefit from a discussion of this point.
Author's response: The same point was also raised by
Reviewer 1, please see response to Reviewer 1, point 2 for what
alternative transcription is concerned.
2) The authors use 97% sequence identity threshold for
EST alignments (it seems without constraining alignment
length). Is this sufficient to avoid aligning EST belonging
to paralogous genes? In other words, is it possible that

Regarding the possibility of detecting ESTs related to paralogous
genes in the same query, we first observe that coding-gene paralogy within a species may assume mean values different from
those found in a different species. However, in general, the percentage of identity between paralogous genes in a gene family
is well below 90%. For example, in the case of the organism we
study in this work (zebrafish), a simple analysis of two classic
gene families known to have a very high grade of conservation
among their members (homeobox and histone gene families)
reveals that, at nucleotide level, values of sequence identity for
each pair comparison were up to 80% (e.g., typically in the
range of 71–80% in the case of homeobox).
3) It is unclear why the software is currently limited to
plus/plus alignments and why so many manual steps are
needed. Are there any serious hurdles for development of
a fully functioning software?
Author's response: We have limited the software to plus/plus
alignments, for two reasons: first, it is implemented in a general-purpose database software for common personal computers, and computations to reverse the sequence in order to resolve
plus/minus alignments would currently be very heavy and slow
in this situation. However, we explicitly chose this graphical
interface to make the software easier for biologists with limited
IT skills to use. In addition, as we point out in the Discussion,
most ESTs are directionally cloned cDNAs, in particular those
deriving from more recently obtained libraries that are also, due
to experimental improvements, those with a better representation of the cDNA 5' end. In the case of directional cloning, the
reverse sequence of the EST is not expected to add data about
the 5' end.
We agree that some manual work is at present necessary to
make the software run. However, due to the potentially long
time required to import data, we prefer to keep the execution of
each main step separate. In addition, it is difficult to incorporate the procedure in a single command, because it exploits different programs and web sites to be used on a personal
computer. The use of AppleScript could be useful on Macs in
order to combine the different required instructions, however
many programs are not fully scriptable and in any case this system script language is not easily available in Windows OS. We
look forward to improvements in personal computer OS script-

ing languages and software to make the procedure more compact in future versions of the software. Anyway, we have now
added an example test to the software distribution to make the
instructions clearer.

Reviewer's report 3
Gáspár Jékely, European Molecular Biology Laboratory,
Heidelberg, Germany

This paper describes a novel software tool that searches for
mRNA 5' sequence incompleteness at a large scale and the
application of this tool for zebrafish mRNAs. Such an ESTbased approach is important in order to improve mRNA
completeness and the prediction of the correct translation
start site in genome databases. The method described adequately addresses the problem of mRNA incompleteness
in databases.
The description of the problem, the methods, and the
three experimentally validated examples is somewhat
lengthy and redundant. The methods section is also
unnecessarily detailed and should be shortened. For
example the section starting with "The Danio rerio EST
subset was also downloaded from Entrez in GenBank format" contains trivial details about data download, concatenation, database formatting and local blasting. The
methods section should focus on describing how the software developed by the Authors works.
Author's response: The description of the problem, of the
methods and of the examples has been revised as suggested. The
details about the software have been removed and they remain
available in the Guide provided with the software. The English
has been revised.
