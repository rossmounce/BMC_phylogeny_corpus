Abstract
Background: Two previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis genes that encode proteins with
acyltransferase PlsC regions were selected for study based on their sequence similarity to a
recently identified lung lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT). To identify their
substrate specificity and biochemical properties, the two Arabidopsis acyltransferases, designated
AtLPEAT1, (At1g80950), and AtLPEAT2 (At2g45670) were expressed in yeast knockout lines ale1
and slc1 that are deficient in microsomal lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase activities.
Results: Expression of AtLPEAT1 in the yeast knockout ale1 background exhibited strong
acylation activity of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidate (LPA) with lower
activity on lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS). AtLPEAT2 had
specificities in the order of LPE > LPC > LPS and had no or very low activity with LPA. Both
acyltransferases preferred 18:1-LPE over 16:0-LPE as acceptor and preferred palmitoyl-CoA as acyl
donor in combination with 18:1-LPE. Both acyltransferases showed no or minor responses to Ca2+,
despite the presence of a calcium binding EF-hand region in AtLPEAT2. AtLPEAT1 was more active
at basic pH while AtLPEAT2 was equally active between pH 6.0 – 9.0.
Conclusion: This study represents the first description of plant acyltransferases with a preference
for LPE. In conclusion it is suggested that the two AtLPEATs, with their different biochemical and
expression properties, have different roles in membrane metabolism/homoeostasis.

Background
Acyltransferases comprise several families of enzymes
with diverse origins and functions. The first acyltransferase recognized to be involved in phosphatydylethanolamine synthesis was identified based on the PlsC
mutant in Escherichia coli, (named after its defect in phospholipid synthesis). Over 5000 acyltransferses are annotated in the UniProtKB database with a PlsC signature [1].

In the Arabidopsis genome, 24 proteins are encoded that
contain this signature but the substrate specificity has
been determined for less than 10 members. Most of the
PlsC domain acyltransferases have two conserved
domains NH(X)4D, (IPB002123A) [2] and FPEGT,
(IPB002123B) [2] of which the former is also part of the
active site. This broad family of enzymes accept at least
two different acyl donors, acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP and sev-

eral acyl acceptors such as glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P),
and lysophospholipids and include members of 1-acylsn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, tafazzin and
glycerol-3-phosphate
O-acyltransferase
enzymes
(IPR002123). Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases
(LPAATs) of the PlsC type have been cloned and characterised from many organisms. Much more scarcely represented are lysophosphatidylethanolamine specific
acyltransferses (LPEATs). However, a bifunctional acylACP synthase having an acyltransferase domain of the
PlsC type was shown to be involved in uptake and acylation of 1-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine, (1-acylGPE), in E. coli, [3]. Moreover, in Synechocystis a broad
acyl-ACP specificity acyltransferase with 1-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine activity, and with a strong preference for 16:0-ACP/lysophosphatidylglycerol, (LPG) has
been well characterized, [4]. Very recently a human
LPEAT2 was cloned and shown to be expressed in brain
[5].
In yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a novel type of acyltransferases YOR175c (ALE1) belonging to the family of membrane bound O-acyltransferases (MBOAT) has recently
been shown to represent a major acyl-CoA dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase [6-12]. Knockout of ALE1
(Δyor175c:KanMX4) results in the loss of in vitro acylation
of LPC, LPE, LPI, LPG, LPS and LPA, but sufficient activity
of LPAAT is still provided for de novo synthesis of phospholipids by SLC1, (PlsC type). While knockout of either
ALE1 or SLC1 results in no obvious growth defect, double
knockout of ale1/slc1 results in a severe growth defect [13]
or lethality [6,8,12], which suggests that together the two
enzymes are indispensable for the synthesis of PA. A novel
plant LPAAT was identified by functional complementation of the Escherichia coli mutant PlsC by Bourgis et al.,
[14] and in Arabidopsis a plastidic LPAAT was shown to
be essential for embryo development [15,16]. By analysis
of the Arabidopsis genome and alignments of putative
acyltransferases in a phylogenetic tree, fifteen Arabidopsis
genes encoding proteins that had both NH(X)4D and EGT
motifs were identified [15]. Among them, At1g80950 was
found, but to our knowledge was not further characterized. A second gene at locus At2g45670, less similar, was
not identified, although it belongs to the same family of
genes. In this study we have expressed cDNAs from these
two genes in yeast ale1 and slc1 knockouts and initially
characterized their biochemical functions in vitro.

Results
Two uncharacterised proteins from Arabidopsis, (locus
At1g80950 and At2g45670) were identified based upon
their predicted amino acid sequence similarity to mouse
lung lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (translated
sequence of accession number AB244717). Both proteins
possess an acyltransferase (PlsC) domain, and one to sev-

eral transmembrane spanning regions. Only the candidate protein At2g45670 was predicted to have an EFhand/calcineurin calcium binding domain. A schematic
drawing of the two proteins is shown in Figure 1A. None
of the candidates scored high for a particular subcellular
localisation, but both were predicted to be in the secretory
pathway using Aramemnon topology consensus search,
[17]. AtLPEAT1 was also ER predicted in a study mapping
the Arabidopsis proteome [18]. Analysis by AtGenExpress
indicated that mRNA from both genes were expressed at
low levels in most tissues with slightly higher expression
in flower. Expression of At1g80950 was higher in the seed,
while the At2g45670 signal was lower at later stages of
seed development, TAIR, (AtGenExpress visualisation
tool), [19]. As the codon usage of both cDNAs did not
largely deviate from optimized yeast codon tables, the
cDNAs were expressed in yeast to initially characterize
their substrate specificity and biochemical characteristics.
Because of strong endogenous lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities in WT yeast, this study took advantage of the mutants of the lysophospholipid
acyltransferases ALE1 (Δyor175c:KanMX4) and SLC1,
(Δydl052c:KanMX4) to express these novel Arabidopsis
acyltransferases.
Expression of the two putative lysophospholipid acyltransferases AtLPEAT1, (At1g80950) and AtLPEAT2,
(At2g45670) in yeast ale1 showed that both proteins possess acyltransferase activity with long-chain acyl-CoA and
lysophospholipid substrates. Time and protein dependence of reactions were determined for AtLPEAT2 with
18:1-CoA and 18:1-LPE. The correlation coefficients were
0.94, (nmol/mg/0–2 min) and 0.98, (nmol/0.5 – 2 mg/
min) between the variables, indicating good linearity of
the assay [see Additional file 1 and 2].
Based on the sequence similarity of the Arabidopsis proteins to the mouse lung LPCAT, we first tested the acylation of 16:0-LPC and found that this substrate was indeed
an acceptor for the two enzymes, whereas 18:1-LPC was a
relatively poor acyl acceptor when the acyl donor was
18:1-CoA, (Figure 2). The highest activities in these assays
were seen with the combination of 16:0-LPC and 16:0CoA for AtLPEAT1 whereas AtLPEAT2 preferred 18:1-LPC
with 16:0-CoA. The empty vector control reflects the phenotype of ale1, which was well below the acylation rate of
LPC of lines expressing AtLPEAT1 or AtLPEAT2 for most
substrates (Figure 2). Acylation activities in the LPEAT
transformants without addition of any lysophospholipid
acceptor indicated there were endogenous lysophospholipids in microsomal extracts [see Additional file 3]. This
background activity gave hints on which substrates were
preferred by the two enzymes, but the molecular species
of these acyl acceptors might not represent acyl acceptors
in Arabidopsis tissues.

Assays with 16:0-LPE and 18:1-LPE with different combinations of 16:0-CoA and 18:1-CoA showed that both Arabidopsis acyltransferases were more active with these acyl
acceptors than with LPC (Figure 2). AtLPEAT1 was more
active with both LPE substrates than AtLPEAT2. Both
enzymes had highest activity with 16:0-CoA and 18:1LPE. Di-18:1-PE and di-16:0-PE were equally well synthesized as by AtLPEAT2 (Figure 2).

A faint spot of PA was also an identified product when no
acyl acceptor was added [see Additional file 3]. As ale1 has
considerable endogenous LPAAT activity we also
expressed the two Arabidopsis acyltransferase in slc1 to
allow more reliable LPAAT assays. As shown in Figure 2,
AtLPEAT1 had substantial LPAAT activities whereas
AtLPEAT2 only exhibited activity just above background.
The best acyl donor was 16:0-CoA in both yeast knockout

of 16:0-CoA and 18:1-CoA were 22.7 μM in all assays except for the assay with 16:0-LPA as an acceptor in the yeast slc1 strain,
which were 2.25 nmol of [14C]18:1-CoA (75000 dpm). The amount of microsomal protein added to the assays of the ale1

backgrounds and there was a slight difference in acyl preference in the control reactions in two backgrounds (ale1
and slc1), presumably reflecting the different specificities
of yeast acyltransferases SLC1 in ale1 and ALE1 in slc1,
(Figure 3). 16:0-LPS was a poor substrate for acylation by
either of the two AtLPEATs, although substantially above
background, and both enzymes showed similar preference for 16:0-CoA as an acyl donor over 18:1-CoA (Figure
2).
The possibility that the C-terminal EF-hand calcium binding domain provided regulation by calcium was tested by
adding CaCl2 to the assay mixtures. However, neither of
the two AtLPEATs activities was dramatically affected by
this addition nor by EDTA [see Additional file 4]. Assaying
pH dependency of the two Arabidopsis constructs
expressed in yeast ale1 was done in 25 mM Tris buffer. In
this analysis, AtLPEAT1 exhibited an almost linear
increase in response at pH 6.0 – 9.0, while AtLPEAT2 had
constant activities over this same pH interval (Figure 3).

Discussion
Our initial attempt to characterise AtLPEAT1 and
AtLPEAT2 by expression in wild-type yeast was obscured

due to high background lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activities of ALE1 LPCAT. However, recent
cloning and characterisation of ALE1 in yeast made it possible to characterize our candidate proteins in a low background strain containing a kanMX4 knockout of this gene.
Since ale1 has almost no lysophospholipid acyltransferase
activities except for LPAAT, [6-8,10-12], expression in this
mutant should reflect the substrate specificities of the candidate acyltransferases. However as one of the Arabidopsis
enzymes turned out to have strong dual activity with high
LPAAT activity, we also decided to express the Arabidopsis
acyltransferases in the yeast, SLC1 knockout. The SLC1
gene was cloned as a suppressor gene which enabled yeast
to grow without sphingolipid synthesis and was shown to
code for an LPAAT protein [20]. Utilizing these yeast
mutants for gal induced expression of AtLPEAT1 and
AtLPEAT2 we found a remarkable difference in preference
for LPA between the two enzymes. AtLPEAT1 preferred
16:0-CoA eight fold over 18:1-CoA using 16:0-LPA as an
acyl acceptor. The increase of LPAAT activity was more
pronounced in slc1 (8 fold), than in ale1 (2.6 fold). This
selectivity of 16:0-CoA is somewhat similar to the Arabidopsis LPAAT1 (LPAT1) preference, although the acyl
acceptor in their assay was 18:1-LPA, [15]. Four other Ara-

for acyl-CoAs [5]. LPE was also a substrate for this
enzyme, but in contrast to the two AtLPEATs it preferred
LPC over LPE. The pH optimum for the mouse lung
LPCAT was between 7.4 and 10, and the reaction did not
require Ca2+. Neither of the two AtLPEATs required Ca2+.
In contrast, the human HsLPCAT (Aytl2) exhibiting EF1
and EF2-hand domains as AtLPEAT2, was shown to be
inhibited by Ca2+, [24] while HsLPEAT2 was not effected
by Ca2+ [5]. AtLPEAT1 had a completely different response
to pH 6.0 – 9.0 while AtLPEAT2 resembled the human
LPCATs by being non sensitive within that pH range.

bidopsis LPAATs (LPAT2, LPAT3, LPAT4 and LPAT5) were
later isolated and characterized for their acyl donor specificities [21]. All four LPAATs possessed higher in vitro activity with 18:1-CoA than 16:0-CoA when expressed in wildtype yeast. AtLPEAT1 exhibited strong selectivity depending on the combination of acyl acceptor and acyl donor in
the acylation of LPE and LPA. The best acceptor was 18:1LPE in combination with 16:0-CoA. AtLPEAT2 lacked
acylation capability of LPA except for a low rate of formation of di-16:0-PA. Like AtLPEAT1, AtLPEAT2 showed the
highest specific activity with 18:1-LPE in combination
with 16:0-CoA.
The sequence homology of AtLPEATs to mammalian
LPCATs is intriguing (Figure 1B and 1C). An alignment
over the region containing the PlsC domain of these evolutionarily distantly related proteins distinguishes these
acyltransferases from other PlsC domain containing proteins distal of the FPEGT site. Using the FPEGT motif and
an adjacent 30 aa of AtLPEAT1 in a BLAST search of the
non-redundant protein database retrieved exclusively this
family. As can be seen in Figure 1C AtLPEAT2 has a Glutamate (E) instead of the otherwise completely conserved
Aspartate (D) in the catalytic site. The mouse lung
LPCAT1, highly homologous to human, (Aytl2) and
mouse/rat LPCAT, has been shown to have preference for
saturated fatty acids of both acceptors and donors [22,23],
while Aytl3 a human LPEAT2 showed no such preference

In eukaryotes, synthesis of PE occurs by three different
pathways. Decarboxylation of PS, phosphoethanolamine
transfer from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol and
base exchange of the headgroup, (serine with ethanolamine). In Arabidopsis, CTP:phosphorylethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, (PECT) mutants exhibit a
decrease of phosphatidylethanolamine and increase in
phosphatidylcholine and embryo abortion, [25]. Both
AtLPEATs were predicted to be in the secretory pathway
and PE is known to be a rather specific target for plant
secretory phospholipases A2 (PL A2) [26]. This type of
phospholipase requires Ca2+ for activity and has no acyl
chain preference [26]. Auxin has been shown to induce
and increase the levels of free fatty acids, LPC and LPE in
microsomes [27] and LPE is also known to retard senescence, which might be related to LPE's inhibitory effect of
phospholipase D [28]. Overexpression of AtsPL A2 in Arabidopsis results in prolonged leaf petiols and inflorescence stems and general cell elongation [29]. Whether the
AtLPEATs described in this study have a function in relation to PL A2on induced responses or in organogenesis
remains to be seen. Related to developmental cues is the
generation of fatty acids for membrane synthesis. In vitro
acylation of PC and PE in Arabidopsis showed that the
ratio of labelling of PE to PC was highly different in root
and leaf and specific PE remodelling by acylation has been
demonstrated to be the cause of the remodelling [30],
AtLPEAT1 and AtLPAT2 are obvious candidates involved
in such remodelling.
The specific activity (10–30 nmol product/min/mg protein) of the LPEATs in the yeast microsomes were similar
or higher than other lysophosphatidyl enzymes assayed
under similar conditions. The acyl acceptors used in our
assays were sn-1-acyl lysophospholipids and thus acylation occurred at the sn-2 position. It should be noted that
palmitoyl-CoA was found to be the best acyl donor by the
two AtLPEATs despite the fact that palmitate is primarily
confined to the sn-1 position of plant PE. There are substantial problems to assay the sn-1 acylation activity of lysophospholipid acyltransferases because the sn-2
lysophospholipid substrates are unstable due to rapid acyl
migration to the sn-1 position. Since the positional specif-

icity of the LPEATs were not studied in this work, we can
not infer any positional preference of the enzymes and
cannot rule out that an additional in-vivo acyl acceptor for
the AtLPEATs in plants might be sn-2-acyl lysophospholipids.

Conclusion
In conclusion, backward transacylation reaction, [31]
and/or hydrolysis of phospholipids in combination with
forward lysophosphatidyl acyltransferases reaction could
at least partly be maintained by the AtLPEATs described
herein. The difference in expression pattern of the two
AtLPEATs, together with their different biochemical properties, suggest that the two AtLPEAT homologues have
partly different functions in membrane metabolism/
homoeostasis. Future studies of Arabidopsis that are
mutated or have overexpressed LPEAT genes are likely to
give valuable information about their physiological functions.

Methods
Constructs and Strains
Two full-length cDNA clones (pda09299, pda10945) corresponding to the Arabidopsis genes At1g80950 and
At2g45670 were obtained from RIKEN, [32]. Expression
of the protein coding sequence of these clones in yeast
using the pYES2 gal inducible system was enabled by PCR
amplification, using Pfu polymerase under standard conditions. The following oligonuceotide primers were used
for amplification: At1g80950 (1) 5'gtgggtaccataatggaatcagagctcaa-3', At1g80950 (2) 5' ccaggcatgctcattcttctttctgatggaa-3', At2g45670 (1) 5' cagggtaccagaatggcggatcctgatct3', At2g45670 (2) 5' tctcgcatgcttatgttggggccaagtcag-3'. The
oligonucleotides contained 5' Kpn1 and 3' Sph1 3' restriction sites for cloning into the corresponding sites of
pYES2. The generated clones in pYES2 were sequenced to
confirm identity with the cDNAs and were named
AtLPEAT1 (At1g80950) and AtLPEAT2 (At2g45670). Two
different haploid knockout mutants of ALE1,
ale1:(BY4741; Mat a; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0;
YOR175c::kanMX4) and SLC1, slc1:(BY4742; Mat α;
his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; YDL052c::kanMX4) a
corresponding wt: (BY4742; Mat α; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0;
lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0). The yeast BY-series were from euroscarf
[33] and were transformed to achieve expression of the
two Arabidopsis acyltransferase proteins. An empty vector
pYES2 was used as a control.
Microsomal preparations
Transgenic yeast strains containing vector constructs
encoding the acyltransferases and empty vector control
were pre-cultured over night in 3 ml of synthetic media
containing 2% Gal without uracil. Thirty ml of synthetic
media containing 2% Gal -U was inoculated from the preculture (all diluted to the same OD) and grown at 28°C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/60

overnight to an OD of approximately 4.0. Twenty ml of
fresh media were added to cultures and incubated for an
additional 4 h. The cells were spun down in 50 ml falcon
tubes and the supernatant discarded. The pellets were
resuspended in 3 ml extraction buffer, (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA) and transferred to 2 ml microfuge
snap cap tubes containing approximately 0.5 ml of 0.5
mm zirconia silicabeads and the cells were disrupted in a
Retch bead beater 30/s, 1 × 3 minutes in pre-chilled supplies. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for
10 min and supernatants transferred to new tubes. The
tubes were washed by adding 0.85 ml extraction buffer,
vortexed, centrifuged and pooled with supernatants. The
supernatants were diluted with extraction buffer to 8 ml
and spun at 100 000 × g, 1 hour 4°C. The pellet was carefully resuspended in 0.5 ml extraction buffer, and aliquots
of 50 μl extracts, "microsomal extracts", were frozen and
stored at -70°C.
Lipid analysis and assay conditions
Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford
assay using fatty acid free BSA as a standard. The assay for
acyltransferase reaction (final volume of 33 μl) contained,
if not otherwise stated in the Figure legends; 25 mM trisHCl pH 7.6, 0.4 M KCl, 0.75 nmol [1-14C]acyl-CoA
(25000 dpm), obtained from American Radiolabeled
Chemicals, St Louis, 0.25 nmol of synthetic lysophospholipids (Avanti polar lipids, inc) and microsomal preparations as amounts indicated in the Figures. 0.4 M KCl
was added to avoid precipitation of acyl-CoA as cations
precipitate most of palmitoyl-CoA at mM concentration.
Lysophospholipids dissolved in water/ethanol 1:1, were
heated briefly before adding to the assay mix. The reactions were started by adding "microsomal extract" preparations under vortexing to pre-warmed microfuge tubes
containing the assay mix. The reaction was incubated at
30°C for 2 minutes and stopped by adding 133 μl
50:50:1, methanol/chloroform/acetic acid and vortexing.
After addition of 13.3 μl H2O the mixture was, vortexed,
centrifuged 13000 × g and the lower phase was transferred
to new tube. The water phase was extracted once again by
adding 66 μl chloroform. The pooled organic phases were
evaporated under a stream of N2, dissolved in 15 μl chloroform and spotted on silica gel 60, 20 × 20 cm TLC plates
(Merck). The TLC plates were developed to 3/4 in
85:15:10:3.5 methanol/chloroform/acetic acid/water. The
phospholipids were identified by comparison to known
standards and quantification was done by autoradiography on a Packard InstantImager, with Version 2.05 software, using triplicates of 1/10th of the assay mix, (without
microsomal preparations), spotted after development at
top of each plate. Background subtraction was done for
each lane at positions where no visible spots could be
seen. Synthetic lysophospholipid acyl acceptors were; 1palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,

1palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine. Acyl
donors were; palmitoyl-Coenzyme A, (16:0-CoA), oleoylCoenzyme A, (18:1-CoA) and corresponding radiolabeled
acyl-CoAs; [14C]16:0-CoA 60 mCi/mmol 0.02 mCi/ml
[14C ]18:1-CoA 55 mCi/mmol 0.1 mCi/ml.
