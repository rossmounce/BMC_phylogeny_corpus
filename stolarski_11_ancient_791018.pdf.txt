The ancient evolutionary origins of Scleractinia
revealed by azooxanthellate corals

Abstract
Background: Scleractinian corals are currently a focus of major interest because of their ecological importance and
the uncertain fate of coral reefs in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressure. Despite this, remarkably little is
known about the evolutionary origins of corals. The Scleractinia suddenly appear in the fossil record about 240 Ma,
but the range of morphological variation seen in these Middle Triassic fossils is comparable to that of modern
scleractinians, implying much earlier origins that have so far remained elusive. A significant weakness in
reconstruction(s) of early coral evolution is that deep-sea corals have been poorly represented in molecular
phylogenetic analyses.
Results: By adding new data from a large and representative range of deep-water species to existing molecular
datasets and applying a relaxed molecular clock, we show that two exclusively deep-sea families, the Gardineriidae
and Micrabaciidae, diverged prior to the Complexa/Robusta coral split around 425 Ma, thereby pushing the
evolutionary origin of scleractinian corals deep into the Paleozoic.
Conclusions: The early divergence and distinctive morphologies of the extant gardineriid and micrabaciid corals
suggest a link with Ordovician “scleractiniamorph” fossils that were previously assumed to represent extinct
anthozoan skeletonized lineages. Therefore, scleractinian corals most likely evolved from Paleozoic soft-bodied
ancestors. Modern shallow-water Scleractinia, which are dependent on symbionts, appear to have had several
independent origins from solitary, non-symbiotic precursors. The Scleractinia have survived periods of massive
climate change in the past, suggesting that as a lineage they may be less vulnerable to future changes than often
assumed.

Background
The two most popular hypotheses put forward to
account for scleractinian origins are that they are either
descendants of late Paleozoic rugose corals that survived
the mass extinction at the Permian/Triassic boundary
[1-3] or, that they evolved from soft-bodied (corallimorpharian-like) ancestors by gaining the ability to deposit a
calcified skeleton [4-6]. Difficulties with the former
hypothesis include that it requires major changes in both
the composition of the skeleton, which was calcite in the
case of Rugosa, but is aragonite in Scleractinia, and the
symmetry of septal insertion [4], characters that are
otherwise highly conserved. By contrast with Rugosa,
some Permian fossils (known as scleractiniamorphs)

appear to have had aragonite skeletons (Numidiaphyllum, Houchnagocyathus) and may be the immediate
ancestors of some Triassic scleractinian coral lineages
[7,8]. Intriguingly, some early Paleozoic “scleractiniamorphs” (kilbuchophyllids from the Ordovician, ca. 450
Mya) have patterns of septal insertion that are indistinguishable from that of modern corals [9,10], suggesting
that these could represent the very early scleractinians.
However, one objection to this idea has been the long
time-gap separating the two groups in the fossil record.
Beyond implying that most extant scleractinians fall
into two major clades (Robusta and Complexa) that are
assumed to have diverged in the Late Carboniferous, ca.
300 Ma [11,12], molecular data have so far not added significantly to our understanding of early coral evolution.
One reason for this may be that molecular phylogenetics
has focused primarily on shallow-water corals, most of
which harbor symbiotic dinoflagellates commonly known

as zooxanthellae, whereas azooxanthellate, deep-water
corals that account for approximately half of extant
scleractinian species, have largely been ignored in these
analyses [13]. The few studies that have included
sequences from azooxanthellate scleractinians have led to
conflicting interpretations of scleractinian phylogeny. For
example, the phylogenetic reconstruction based on mitochondrial (12S rDNA) and nuclear (partial 28S rDNA)
data for 80 scleractinian species (18 of which were azooxanthellate) suggested that all azooxanthellate, deep-water
lineages originated from symbiotic, shallow-water ancestors [14]. In contrast, another study based on COX1 [15]
found that members of the Gardineriidae and Micrabaciidae families formed a deeply diverging clade that may
represent the oldest extant scleractinian lineage and that
modern deep-water species diverge at or near the bases
of both the Robusta and Complexa, implying that the
evolutionary origin of scleractinians is best sought in
deep-water rather than shallow-water (primarily zooxanthellate) coral species. These contradictory interpretations motivated us to extend phylogenetic analyses of a
large and representative range of deep and shallow water
corals (more than 10% of all extant deep-sea species; see
Additional file 1) beyond COX1, to include data for the
mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNAs, and the nuclear 28S
rDNA, in an attempt to clarify scleractinian origins and
relationships. In addition, the ages of the major scleractinian lineages were estimated, and the origins of the
Order explored. The divergence time estimates generated
here bridge the gap with fossils, allowing the integration
of the morphologically similar Paleozoic “scleractiniamorphs” into Scleractinia.

Results and Discussion
Initial phylogenetic analyses were conducted on single
gene sequences from a broad range of members of the
anthozoan sub-Class (Hexacorallia/Zoantharia) to which
corals belong. The application of maximum likelihood
and Bayesian analyses to these datasets provided robust
support for monophyly of the Scleractinia (Figure 1; see
also Fukami et al. [16]), whereas paraphyly had been suggested in a previous study [17]. Moreover, as has recently
been reported [15], the most deeply diverging scleractinian lineage was composed of representatives of the
families Gardineriidae and Micrabaciidae, whose members are exclusively solitary and azooxanthellate.
The second, more extensive, phase of phylogenetic analysis was carried out not only to clarify relationships
within Scleractinia, but also to provide estimates of the
timing of major divergences. For this purpose, 16S and
28S rDNA sequences were concatenated, but we avoided
the creation of chimeric sequences (i.e. concatenation of
sequences from different species) in these analyses. For
the estimation of divergence times, the molecular-clock

was calibrated using the oldest Mesozoic fossils that can
be unequivocally assigned to extant genera/families,
Caryophyllia for Caryophylliidae, Flabellum for Flabellidae, and Palaeopsammia for Dendrophylliidae (see
Methods). As can be seen in Figure 2, these analyses
imply that the basal clade comprising gardineriids and
micrabaciids split with the major scleractinian lineage
deep in the Paleozoic (ca. 425 Ma), significantly predating
the Robusta/Complexa divergence, which our analyses
place between the Silurian and Devonian (ca. 415 Ma) more than 110 My earlier than previously thought [12].
In an attempt to test the accuracy of these divergence
times, a second (Bayesian) relaxed molecular-clock analysis was performed on the coral dataset but with the inclusion of data for four homoscleromorph sponges as
outgroups (data not shown). For this analysis, the same
parameters were used, including the same calibration
points, but forcing the root node - Homoscleromorpha/
Eumetazoa split - to ca. 820 My (see Sperling et al. 2010,
Table three [18]). Including the sponge data did not significantly affect the divergence time estimates for the
main scleractinian nodes (Figure 2), indicating that these
estimates are relatively robust, but did affect the estimate
of the Corallimorpharia/Scleractinia divergence, placing
it more than 50% deeper than previously estimated.
The discrepancy between the Complexa/Robusta divergence age estimated herein and those from previous studies may be due to a wider taxon sampling in the present
study, and the quality [17] or absence of fossil calibration
in the case of previous estimates [11,12]. For example,
the first estimate of the timing of divergence between
Complexa/Robusta [12] was based on comparison of 16S
rDNA sequence divergence with that in Orders of holometabolous insects, making no allowance for the possibility of different rates of evolution. Additionally, recent
divergence time analysis of the Holometabola origin is
placed in the early Carboniferous (355 Ma), significantly
older than in previous reconstructions [19].
The divergence of unambiguous scleractinians (gardineriids and micrabaciids) deep in the Paleozoic removes
the temporal disconnect between Scleractinia and “scleractiniamorphs”, the only substantial basis on which the two
groups were previously distinguished. The known Paleozoic “scleractiniamorphs” were solitary or quasi-colonial
(phaceloid), which, under the evolutionary scenario outlined below, is consistent with the idea that the ancestral
scleractinian was solitary and azooxanthellate. Based on
the clear similarity between “scleractiniamorph” skeletons
and extant scleractinians, we consider that the Paleozoic
“scleractiniamorphs” [7-10] should be reclassified as genuine scleractinians. Moreover, other (soft-bodied) hexacorallian fossils have been reported from as far back as the
Cambrian [20], and the results presented here lend support to the idea that these might represent evolutionary

Figure 2 Phylogeny of the Scleractinia based on Bayesian analysis of concatenated mitochondrial (16S rDNA) and nuclear (28S rDNA)
data. The tree shown is the majority rule consensus (BMC) cladogram based on sequence data for 121 scleractinian corals with the
corallimorpharian Ricordea florida defined as outgroup. Representatives of the families Micrabaciidae and Gardineriidae form the basal clade
within the Scleractinia, their divergence predating that of the Complexa and Robusta clades. To estimate divergence times for gardineriids/
micrabaciids and other scleractinians, a relaxed molecular-clock (uncorrelated lognormal) Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method was
applied. The clock was calibrated using the earliest fossils that can be unambiguously assigned to extant clades and whose unique skeletal
characters can be unequivocally recognized in fossil coralla (grey box identify each calibrated node and their respectively earliest fossil dates).
Dates in red are discussed in the text. Asterisks (*) beside nodes indicate Maximum Likelihood (Chi-square and Bootstrap) and BMC (posterior
probability) support greater than 0.95, 70, and 95 respectively, whereas a plus (+) indicates support higher than 0.80, 55, and 80 respectively. For
each family/clade examined, the corresponding branches are colour coded. Black circles and/or black squares indicate those species that are
colonial and/or zooxanthellate. Bold text indicates species for which sequence data was obtained in the present study. For the various

precursors of the Scleractinia [21]. There are several possible explanations for the discontinuity of the Paleozoic
record for Scleractinia. Paleozoic sediments containing
corals may simply not yet have been found or are not preserved in the geological record. The only known lower
Paleozoic scleractinian (genus Kilbuchophyllia) was recovered because shallow-water fossil-bearing deposits were

transported to greater depth as the result of landslides
[22]. This indicates that the currently known Paleozoic
record might not be representative of the true diversity of
the group at that time. Alternatively, skeletal formation in
these early corals might have been an ephemeral trait
[5,6], or skeleton-forming coral lineages went extinct. The
same interpretative challenges apply to the evolutionary

history of micrabaciids: their sudden appearance in the
fossil record (Cretaceous) and lack of reliable ancestors
among earlier scleractinian fauna suggest their emergence
via skeletonization from an ancient “micrabaciid-gardineriid” skeleton-less hexacoral lineage, or points to huge gaps
in the fossil record of deep-water scleractinians. Another
important implication of the present analyses and those
from the earlier COX1 analysis [15] is that modern shallow-water corals most likely had multiple independent origins from deep-water (azooxanthellate and solitary)
ancestors (as has been hypothesized for another calcified
cnidarian group, the Stylasteridae [23]), providing an
explanation for the sudden appearance of the morphologically diverse Middle Triassic coral fauna.
Like their extant relatives, at least some Triassic Scleractinia hosted dinoflagellate symbionts - such associations
conceivably evolved as a consequence of widespread oligotrophic conditions [24,25]. The explosive diversification of
scleractinians in the Middle Triassic (ca. 240 Ma) coincides with a massive radiation of dinoflagellates [26], the
former presumably being facilitated by the establishment
of symbiosis.
In terms of skeleton composition, septal insertion and
overall anatomy (see Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6),
micrabaciids and gardineriids are typical scleractinians
[27], but these two families have unique features that distinguish them from each other and from all other extant
Scleractinia [3,28]. Whilst shared morphological traits
could reflect convergence, at least at a superficial level, the
quite different gross skeletal architectures of gardineriids
and micrabaciids are each strikingly reminiscent of more
ancient coral and coral-like fossils. In gardineriids, the
epithecal wall is the only wall of the corallum, which is an
unusual feature among modern corals, but was prevalent
among early Triassic scleractinians [6]; for example, Margarophyllia (Figure 3) or Protoheterastraea [3] from 230
Ma bear a striking resemblance to Gardineria. On the
other hand, micrabaciids share a unique characteristic
(bifurcating higher cycle septa) with kilbuchophyllid “scleractiniamorphs” (Figure 3) but, whereas the later had welldeveloped epithecal walls, this is not true for micrabaciids.
Despite the basal position of the micrabaciid-gardineriid
clade in scleractinian phylogeny, the first appearance of
the micrabaciids in the fossil record is in the Cretaceous
(Cenomanian, ca. 96 Ma) [29]. There are currently no earlier Triassic or Jurassic corals sharing septal organization
and microstructural features with micrabaciids, so the
ancestry of this family is again unclear [29]. The late
appearance of micrabaciids in the fossil record is generally
consistent with late (ca. 160 Ma, Middle Jurassic) divergence of micrabaciid and gardineriid lineages suggested by
molecular phylogeny (Figure 2), but the lack of early
Mesozoic micrabaciid-like fossils is puzzling.

Conclusions
The analyses presented here support scleractinian monophyly and place the evolutionary origin of the Order deep
in the Paleozoic, both of which are consistent with an
independent origin from a soft-bodied ancestor but
inconsistent with the rugosan ancestry hypothesis [1-3].
Although skeletal evidence is still lacking, the molecular
data presented here bridge the gap in the fossil record
between the Ordovician and Mesozoic Scleractinia.
Although our results are robust and largely consistent
with molecular-clock based analyses of other groups [18],
the molecular markers used here may not be optimal for
addressing deep-divergence events and should be verified
using a range of additional markers.
The early origin of Scleractinia implied by our results
has important implications for the debate about the fate
of corals in times of global climate change, since they
imply that the scleractinian lineage has persisted through
several episodes of dramatic climate change during the
last 450 My. Whilst on evolutionary time scales the Scleractinia may be less vulnerable than is sometimes
assumed, the short-term survival of coral reefs as we
know them is far less assured.
Methods
Material

The present study was based on the examination of 123
lots of deep-water azooxanthellate scleractinians collected
from 87 stations from New Caledonia (French research
expeditions Bathus 3, Bathus 4, Halipro 1, Norfolk 1 and
Norfolk 2), and from Australia (Australian research expeditions SS 011997, SS 102005, SS 022007, and Tan0308).
Additional specimens collected in Australian waters were
provided by the Western Australian Museum (see Additional file 1).
DNA preparation, amplification and sequence analyses

For large specimens, whole mesenteries were dissected out
(with forceps) prior to extraction, whereas for smaller specimens an entire system (including skeleton) was extracted
and immersed in the lysis buffer. Genomic DNA was
extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). DNA
concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop 1000
(Thermo Scientific) prior to Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) amplification under the following conditions:
(i) 16S rDNA - the primers developed by Le Goff-Vitry
et al. [30] (LP16SF 5’ -TTGACCGGTATGAATGGTGT
and LP16SR 5’ -TCCCCAGGGTAACTTTTATC) were
used to amplify a fragment whose size varied between 280
and 420 bp. Reactions were carried out in a total volume
of 50 μl, and contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1
mM of each primer, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher
Biotec - Australia) and 125 ng of template. The PCR

resulting from occurrence of corrugated, entirely epithecal wall and relatively smooth septa, rugosans exhibit a different pattern of septal
insertion than scleractinians (serial vs. cyclic, respectively), which most researchers consider the main argument of their independent origin.

protocol used was: an initial denaturation step (95°C for
5 min), then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50°C, and
45 s at 72°C, followed by 10 min at 72°C.
(ii) COX1 - the universal primers developed by Folmer
et al. [31] (LCO1 490 5’ -GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG and HCO2 198 5’ -TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA) were used to amplify a fragment whose
size varied between 690 and 710 bp. Reactions were carried out as described by Folmer et al. [31]: 95°C for 1 min,
then 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 40°C, and 90 s at 72°
C, followed by 10 min at 72°C.
(iii) 12S rDNA - the primers developed by Chen and Yu
[32] (ANTMT12SF 5’-AGCCACACTTTCACTGAAACAAGG and ANTMT12SR 5’-GTTCCCYYWCYCTYACYATGTTACGAC) were used to amplify a fragment
whose size varied between 800 and 920 bp. Reactions were
carried out in 50 μl, with 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM of each primer, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Fisher
Biotec - Australia), and 125 ng of template. PCR conditions were: 95°C for 4 min, followed by 4 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 60 s at 50°C, 120 s at 72°C, and 30 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 60 s at 55°C, 120 s at 72°C and then 4 min at 72°C.
(iv) 28S rDNA - the primers developed by Medina et al.
[17] (28S.F63sq 5’-AATAAGCGGAGGAAAAGAAAC
and 28S.R635sq 5’-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG) were
used to amplify a fragment of approximately 750 bp. Reactions were carried out using the Advantage2 PCR kit
(Clontech) with 100 ng of template, and following manufacturer’s protocol. PCR conditions were: 95°C for 5 min,
then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60 s at 54°C, 90 s at 72°C,
followed by 5 min at 72°C.
When amplification reactions based on Taq polymerase
did not yield product, amplification was carried out using
the Clontech Advantage-2 Kit (with the same template
and primer concentrations, and under the same PCR protocol). PCR reactions were performed using a Bio-Rad
DNA engine (Peltier Thermal Cycler). PCR products were
purified using Mo-Bio Ultra Clean (PCR Clean Up) spin
columns, and subjected to direct (Sanger) sequencing at
Macrogen (South Korea).
Two different approaches were tested using sequences
determined here and others retrieved from GenBank (see
Additional file 1). The first approach included representatives of all hexacorallian orders but Ceriantharia and was
intended to validate the Scleractinia monophyly. For this
purpose, four single gene phylogenies all rooted with
Octocorallia were constructed. The second approach, used
herein for time divergence between scleractinian groups
(Basal, Complex, and Robust groups), was based on concatenated sequences of the ribosomal genes16S rDNA and
28S rDNA, and included a broad range of scleractinian
representatives. Alignments for both approaches were performed for each gene separately using ClustalW (EBI) and
manually edited using JalView version 8.0 [33].

Page 7 of 10

Alignments for the first approach were individually
tested for substitution saturation [34] using DAMBE [35],
which indicated little saturation for COX1 and 28S rDNA
sequences (i.e. Iss. significantly lower than Iss.c), but
higher levels of saturation for the 16S and 12S rDNAs (Iss.
higher than Iss.c). Saturation related to mitochondrial
ribosomal genes was induced by their respective fast evolving regions. This phenomenon was particularly evident
because sequences from distant Anthozoa representatives
were included in these alignments. To improve the phylogenetic signal, the most rapidly evolving regions were
excluded from the alignment, resulting in a sharply
decrease in saturation levels. The final alignments used in
the first approach consisted of 298 positions for the16S
rDNA, 599 positions for COX1, 631 positions for 12S
rDNA, and 709 positions for the 28S rDNA. For each marker, appropriate models of nucleotide substitution were
determined by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test implemented in MrModeltest [36]. Phylogenetic analyses were
performed using PhyML [37] for maximum likelihood
(ML) and MrBayes (version 3.1.2) [38] for Bayesian Inference (BI). The maximum likelihood analyses were performed under the GTR model with a non-parametric
Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. For the Bayesian
inference, two runs each of 10 million generations were
calculated for each marker with topologies saved at each
1000 generations, with the average standard deviation of
split frequencies between runs of each marker converging
to or less than 0.01. The first quarter of the 10000 saved
topologies were discarded as burnin, and the remaining
used to calculate posterior probabilities (Figure 1).
The final alignment that based the second approach
contained concatenated 16S rDNA and 28S rDNA
sequences (without excluding the fast evolving regions)
from 121 scleractinians and 1 corallimorpharian, totalling
1334 bp. This alignment was also tested for substitution
saturation, which indicated good phylogenetic signal. ML
phylogenetic analyses were performed as described
above. However, instead of Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like
statistical support, they were performed under the Chisquare and 100 bootstrap replicates.
To estimate divergence times for gardineriids/micrabaciids and other scleractinians, we applied a relaxed-clock
(uncorrelated lognormal) Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo method as implemented in BEAST (version 1.4.8)
[39]. This method allows nucleotide substitution rates to
vary between lineages and incorporates phylogenetic
uncertainty by sampling phylogenies and parameter estimates in proportion to their posterior probability. Additionally, Yule process was chosen as tree prior, and the
prior distribution of divergence of each calibrated node
was set as normal with standard deviation of 3.5. Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests led to the adoption of the General
Time Reversible model with a proportion of invariant sites

and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR+I+Γ) as
the most appropriate evolutionary model for the molecular
clock analyses. One run of 10 million generations was calculated with topologies and other parameters saved at each
1000 generations. A quarter of the 10000 saved topologies
were discarded as burnin, and the remaining used to calculate posterior probabilities and node ages (Figure 1). Additionally, phylogenetic reconstruction from the same
alignment was also calculated on MrBayes in two MCMC
runs of 10 million generations each with topologies
sampled every 1000 generations. Average standard deviation of split frequencies between runs was less than 0.01.
The first quarter of the 10000 sampled topologies were discarded as burnin, and the remaining used to calculate posterior probabilities. The resulting topology was consistent
with the one calculated using BEAST (data not shown).
For the calibration of the molecular clock, stringent constraints were applied based on fossils that can be unambiguously assigned to extant clades and whose unique
skeletal characters can be unequivocally recognized in fossil coralla. Nodes used for the calibration were: (A) the
appearance of Caryophyllia (ca. 160 Ma), based on the
Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) species C. simplex and C. suevica
[40,41]. Both species have well-developed “true” pali present in one crown before the penultimate cycle of septa,
fascicular columella composed of several twisted laths and
septothecal walls, characters which together occur only in
fossil and extant representatives of this genus [42]; (B) The
divergence of the Dendrophylliidae (ca. 127 Ma), corresponding to the first occurrence of solitary Palaeopsammia (Barremian) [43]. The first appearance of colonial
dendrophylliids (Blastozopsammia) in the Albian (ca. 100
Ma) [44] is consistent with the earlier origin of solitary
genera. Skeletal synapomorphies of dendrophylliids
include the Pourtalès plan of septal arrangement and the
presence of a synapticulothecate wall [45]; and (C) the origin of Flabellum (ca. 77.5 Ma), based on the earliest
known record of the genus (F. fresnoense) from the Late
Cretaceous (Coniacian; ?early Maastrichtian, based on foraminiferal assemblage) [46]. Unequivocal Flabellum fossils
are also known from the Late Cretaceous (?Campanian,
Maastrichtian) of Seymour Island (F. anderssoni) [47] and
Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Western Australia
(Flabellum miriaensis) [48]. Flabellum is clearly distinguishable based on the following unique combination of
characters: the marginothecal wall is present throughout
ontogeny, lack of pali/paliform lobes and scale-like microtexture of septa (sometimes preserved in the fossil record).
Monophyly was enforced in the case of the dendrophylliids (calibration node B), but not for nodes A or C.
Histological preparation

Ethanol preserved specimens were immersed in 20% (w/
v) EDTA (pH 8) for two weeks at 4°C for decalcification.

Page 8 of 10

The resulting material was then dehydrated (70%, 80%, 2
× 95%, and 3 × 100% ethanol washes each of 40 min) and
taken through three xylene washes (each of 40 min) prior
to embedding in paraffin and serial tissue sectioning. Sections (5 μm) were stained using Harris’s haematoxylin
and eosin or Alcian Blue/PAS.
Skeleton preparation and analysis

Preliminary selection of skeleton samples was performed
using a Nikon SMZ800 stereoscopic zoom microscope.
For standard SEM (Philips XL 20) measurements, polished
and etched blocks of corals skeleton were used. Following
published methods of preparation [49], the samples were
polished with diamond powder, 1200 Grit and aluminium
oxide (Buehler TOPOL) and then etched for 10 seconds in
0.1% formic acid. Trace element analyses were performed
with the Cameca NanoSIMS N50 at the Muséum National
d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris), following established procedures [50,51]. Briefly, septa were cut perpendicular to their
growth direction, mounted in epoxy (Körapox © ) and
polished to a 0.25 μm finish using diamond paste. The
samples were then gold-coated. Using a primary beam of
O-, secondary ions of 24Mg+, 44Ca+ and 88Sr+ were sputtered from the sample surface and detected simultaneously
(multicollection-mode) in electron-multipliers at a massresolving power of ~5000 (M/ΔM). At this mass-resolving
power, the measured secondary ions are resolved from
potential interferences. Data were obtained from a presputtered surface as point analyses with the primary ions
focused to a spot-size of ~3 micrometer and the primary
beam stepped across the sample surface in steps of 20
micrometers. The measured 24 Mg/ 44 Ca and 88 Sr/ 44 Ca
ratios were calibrated against analyses of carbonate standards of known composition (OKA-C) [52]. The chemical
variations recorded in the coral skeletons are much larger
than both the internal and external reproducibility of the
standards, which were less than < 5% for Mg/Ca and < 3%
for Sr/Ca. Briefly, the composition of skeletal trace elements of micrabaciids and gardineriids are consistent with
other modern deep-sea corals [53], although the Sr/Ca
ratios measured from Letepsammia are at the high end of
the range: Letepsammia - Mg/Ca = 1-2 mmol/mol, Sr/Ca
= 11.5-12.2 mmol/mol; Stephanophyllia - Mg/Ca = 2.5-3
mmol/mol, Sr/Ca = 10.3-11.2 mmol/mol; and Gardineria
- Mg/Ca = 1.7-3.5 mmol/mol, Sr/Ca = 9.3-11.7 mmol/mol.

Additional file 2: Anatomy of Gardineria, Letepsammia and other
extant scleractinian corals. The figure compares Gardineria hawaiiensis
(A-E), Letepsammia formosissima (F-J), Fungiacyathus margaretae (K-O),
and Acropora millepora (P-U) at the levels of skeleton macromorphology
(first column), anatomy (second column) and histology (columns 3-4) (SU, courtesy of Dr. Tracy Ainsworth). Color arrows indicate the following
anatomical and histological details: black arrows, mouth/pharynx position
on cross-sectioned polyps; gray arrows, septal position; pink arrows,
spermaries, white arrows, calicoblastic ectoderm; yellow arrows,
mesoglea; green arrows, mesogleal plates; red arrow, muscle fibers; dark
blue arrows, zooxanthellae; light blue arrows, cnidae; orange arrows,
mucocytes. All cross sections are stained with Alcian Blue/PAS or
haematoxylin and eosin. Cnidae are shown on sections of tentacle
acrospheres (E, J, O, U). Fungiacyathus margaretae and Acropora millepora
were used as typical representatives of deep-water (azooxanthellate) and
tropical shallow-water (zooxanthellate) Scleractinia respectively. Although
the three deep-water species have significantly thicker mesoglea and
mesogleal plates, and more abundant mucocytes than does the shallow
water coral (A. millepora), G. hawaiiensis and L. formosissima are typical
scleractinians in terms of all histological features examined.
Additional file 3: Initial ontogenetic stages in Gardineria hawaiiensis
(A) and Letepsammia formosissima (B). The position of the six
simultaneously inserted protosepta are indicated with white arrows. Thin
section of the corallum base (A) and polished corallum base (B).
Additional file 4: Skeletons of modern, deep-water representatives
of the Basal clade of Scleractinia: Gardineriidae (Gardineria
hawaiiensis) and Micrabaciidae (Letepsammia formosissima). While
gardineriids have very robust coralla (A, B), micrabaciids typically have a
light, lace-like skeleton with perforated walls and septa (B, D, E). Such
lightly calcified skeletons are common in corals living close to or below
the carbonate compensation depth (4500-5000 m; see also Additional file
6). In addition, uniquely amongst extant corals, the thickening deposits
of micrabaciids are composed of a meshwork of short and extremely
thin (ca. 100-300 nm) fibers with variable crystallographic orientation (G,
I). In the case of gardineriids, distinctively from most deep-water
scleractinians, which display aragonite fibers in large bundles (e.g.,
Desmophyllum) or in complex patterns (e.g., Flabellum), septal
microstructure typically forms smaller, vesicular units (F, H, see also
Additional file 6). The cyclical insertion pattern of septa in gardineriids (A)
and micrabaciids (B) is typical of Scleractinia. However, both taxa show
several unique features that distinguish them from other modern corals
and from one another. In Gardineria (C) the outer part of the skeleton
consists of a thick epithecal wall, which is unique to modern corals but
was common among the earliest solitary anthozoans. In contrast, the
synapticular wall of micrabaciids is highly porous (D). Unique features of
modern micrabaciids are the multiple bifurcations of septa of the third
order, straight and non-bifurcate septa of the first order (B), and
thickening deposits (TD) composed of irregular meshwork of short fibers
organized into small bundles (G, I). In contrast, a central line of wellorganized rapid accretion centers and radiating bundles of fibers, formed
by sequentially addition of micrometer-sized growth layers characterize
Gardineria septal microstructure (F, H). Distal (A, B), proximal (D), and
lateral (C, E) views are shown. Transverse polished and etched sections
(F-I) of septa of G. hawaiiensis (F, H) and L. formosissima (G, I) with Rapid
Accretion Deposits (RAD) surrounded by bundles of Thickening Deposits
(TD). Scale bars 10 mm (A-E), and 20 μm (F-I).
Additional file 5: Microstructural features of Letepsammia
(Micrabaciidae), Gardineria (Gardineriidae) and other Recent
scleractinian corals. The SEM micrographs shown are of etched
polished surfaces of septa. In addition to differences in the distribution of
Rapid Accretion Deposits (RAD), major differences can also be seen in
the arrangement of the thickening deposits (TD). In Letepsammia
formosissima (A), the TDs are composed of an irregular meshwork of
fiber bundles oriented sub-parallel to the surface, whereas in Gardineria
hawaiiensis (B), bundles of fibers (TD) form smaller, vesicular units. In
Desmophyllum dianthus (C), Caryophyllia cyathus (D) and Favia stelligera
(G), the TDs consist of bundles of fibers running perpendicular to the
skeletal surface (in the case of the zooxanthellate coral Favia, these
display high regularity, corresponding to daily growth increments). The
TDs in Flabellum (E), Galaxea (F), and Acropora (H) show micro-laminar

organization corresponding to the scale-like micro-texture of their
skeleton surfaces.
Additional file 6: Abyssal scleractinians. Of known scleractinians,
representatives of Leptopenus (A, B) and Fungiacyathus (C, D) occur at the
greatest depths (reaching depths > 5000), consequently developing
fragile and thin skeletons of low density. The upper two images (A, B)
are of a formaldehyde preserved specimen of Leptopenus, the bulk of the
animal being composed of soft tissue (brown); the delicate skeleton
(white) is deeply embedded within the polyp tissue. The two lower
images (C, D) show the extremely thin, parchment-like skeleton of
Fungiacyathus. Proximal views.
