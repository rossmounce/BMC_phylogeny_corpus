Abstract
Background: Bats of the family Phyllostomidae show a unique diversity in feeding specializations. This taxon includes
species that are highly specialized on insects, blood, small vertebrates, fruits or nectar, and pollen. Feeding
specialization is accompanied by morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations. Several attempts were
made to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this family in order to reconstruct the evolutionary transitions
accompanied by nutritional specialization. Nevertheless, the evolution of nectarivory remained equivocal.
Results: Phylogenetic reconstructions, based on a concatenated nuclear-and mitochondrial data set, revealed a
paraphyletic relationship of nectarivorous phyllostomid bats. Our phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the
nectarivorous genera Lonchophylla and Lionycteris are closer related to mainly frugivorous phyllostomids of the
subfamilies Rhinophyllinae, Stenodermatinae, Carolliinae, and the insectivorous Glyphonycterinae rather than to
nectarivorous bats of the Glossophaginae. This suggests an independent origin of morphological adaptations to a
nectarivorous lifestyle within Lonchophyllinae and Glossophaginae. Molecular clock analysis revealed a relatively short
time frame of about ten million years for the divergence of subfamilies.
Conclusions: Our study provides strong support for diphyly of nectarivorous phyllostomids. This is remarkable, since
their morphological adaptations to nutrition, like elongated rostrums and tongues, reduced teeth and the ability to use
hovering flight while ingestion, closely resemble each other. However, more precise examinations of their tongues (e.g.
type and structure of papillae and muscular innervation) revealed levels of difference in line with an independent
evolution of nectarivory in these bats.
Background
The diversity of feeding specialization of phyllostomid
bats are unique among all mammals [1-7]. They range
from insect-to diverse vegetable-feeding strategies, as
well as omnivory, carnivory, and even blood-feeding [816]. This ecological diversification is accompanied by
morphological, behavioural and physiological adaptations [4,9,17-32]. A striking example is specialization for
nectarivory, with several species feeding primarily on
nectar. These bats have the ability to hover in front of a
plant, while drinking nectar with their elongated and
extensile tongues adorned with brush-like papillae and
grooves for ingestion of nectar [3,26,29,30,33-37]. They
digest and metabolize nectar and pollen quickly [32,38* Correspondence: thomas.datzmann@senckenberg.de

44]. Phyllostomid bats represent the second largest chiropteran family after the vesper bats (Vespertilionidae
Gray, 1821), with more than 150 species in at least 49
genera. Their distribution ranges from southern Arizona
and the West Indies to northern Argentina [45].
Although phylogenetic analyses of morphology, chromosomes, and molecules have helped to illuminate relationships among many genera and subfamilies of
phyllostomid bats, relationships among nectarivorous
genera are still unclear. Many phylogenies based on morphological characters suggest a monophyletic origin for
all specialized nectarivorous phyllostomids [5,46,47]. We
provide a well-supported phylogenetic estimate of phyllostomid bats based on a large molecular data set, comprising 10396 bp from a total of twelve nuclear-and
mitochondrial genes, and try to clarify phylogenetic relationships among nectarivorous taxa by testing whether
they share a close common ancestry. Furthermore, we

Results
Phylogeny of the Phyllostomidae

Figure 1 shows our maximum-likelihood reconstruction
(b) compared to the latest comprehensive analysis of
phyllostomid phylogeny (a) after Baker et al. (2003) [48].
Baker and colleagues used sequences of 12S and 16S
rRNA, tRNA Valin and the rag2 gene for their inference.
Our reconstruction shows high congruence, even though
it is completely based on independent genes (see methods section: Alignment 1). Although no members of the
subfamilies Lonchorhinae, Glyphonycterinae and Rhinophyllinae were included (because of incomplete data for
these taxa), major branching patterns were consistently
reconstructed. Our reconstruction received good bootstrap support and is in line with Baker et al.'s phylogeny
of phyllostomid bats. Therefore, we combined our data
with the data from Baker et al. (2003) [48].
A separate analysis of all mitochondrial and nuclear loci
(Alignment 2&3) resulted in high congruent phylogenies
(Figure 2). Among the frugivorous species relationships

changed between the independent inferences. A sistergroup relationship between Carolliinae and Glyphonycterinae could not be inferred from the mitochondrial data
set. In this reconstruction glyphonycterids were found
basal to all frugivores. But this relationship obtained low
support (BS 50) compared to the reconstruction based on
nuclear loci, where Carolliinae is sister taxon to them (BS
73).
Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis based on our supermatrix (see methods section: Alignment 5) revealed a
well-resolved phylogeny for the Phyllostomidae (Figure
3), with most nodes receiving high bootstrap support (BS
> 90). Monophyly of all subfamilies recognized by Baker
et al. (2003) [48] was verified, and relevant nodes were
highly supported by different measurements (Table 1).
Three basal lineages, comprising the taxa Macrotus (1),
Micronycteris (2), and the vampire bats Desmodus and
Diaemus (3), were confirmed (Figure 3). A bifurcation in
more or less omnivorous bats (Phyllostominae) and predominantly vegetarian species followed. Within the frugivores a sister-group relationship between Rhinophyllinae
and the Stenodermatinae was well-supported (BS 99).
However, support for a sister-group relationship of Carol-

liinae and Glyphonycterinae was weak (BS 48). The
highly specialized nectarivorous taxa Lonchophylla and
Lionycteris do not align closely with other nectarivorous
phyllostomids (Glossophaginae). Instead, they shared a
common ancestor with the frugivores, as previously proposed by Baker et al. (2003) [48] and others [33,49,50].
Divergence time estimation and model decision

The analysis under the lognormal relaxed clock model
(UCLN) produced the smallest confidence intervals compared to the exponential-(UCED) or strict clock model
(CLOC). Estimates of mean likelihood, substitution rate,
and node age were most accurately inferred under the
UCLN model (Table 2). The assumption of the relaxed
clock, that branches differ in their substitution rates, was
confirmed. A coefficient of variation of 0.405 indicated
moderate rate variation [51]. Figure 4 shows the dated
Bayesian tree inferred with BEAST under the UCLN
model. The common ancestor of all phyllostomids was
dated to the Middle Eocene (42 MYA), with a confidence
interval between 49- and 37 MYA. Basal lineages within
the phyllostomids arose shortly thereafter in the Late

Eocene or Early Oligocene (35-32 MYA). The prominent
amount of the remaining lineages emerged in a time
frame of about ten million years at the transition from
Oligocene to Miocene (29-20 MYA), with 21 out of 33
lineages already present in the Early Miocene (20 MYA).
Reconstruction of ancestral states

Figure 3 shows the reconstruction of ancestral states by
the maximum-likelihood approach under the Markov kstate model. Only relevant nodes, which will be used in
the discussion chapter, are shown. Reconstructed feeding
specialization of the common ancestor of all phyllostomids and of the common ancestor of important clades
were mapped on the tree (Figure 3). Unambiguous character states were assigned to nodes with a probability of
more than 90% for one reconstructed state. The feeding
specialization of the common ancestor of all omnivorous
and predominantly vegetarian phyllostomid species could
not be resolved, as the reconstruction was ambiguous for
this node (marked with ?). We obtained probability values
of 47% for a nectarivorous-, 39% for an omnivorous-, and
12% for an insectivorous state at this node.

Discussion
Phylogeny of the Phyllostomidae

Our molecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on
more than 10 kb DNA sequences obtained high bootstrap
support for almost all nodes and challenges several phylogenetic relationships derived from morphological data
sets. Our results partly disagree with recent classifications of phyllostomid bats [45,49] including: (1) placement of insectivorous genera Macrotus, Micronycteris,
Glyphonycteris and Trinycteris within the Phyllostomidae; (2) relationship of the fruit-eating genus Rhinophylla
to other frugivores; and (3) relationships among nectarivorous phyllostomids.

The molecular data suggest that the genera Macrotus
and Micronycteris do not belong to the subfamily Phyllostominae as proposed by Koopman (1994) [49], McKenna
and Bell (1997) [47], Wetterer et al. (2000) [5], and Jones
et al. (2002) [50]. Instead, they form two divergent basal
lineages within phyllostomid bats (Figure 3). Our data are
in line with the findings of Baker et al. (2003) [48]. The
authors proposed a classification of two different subfamilies Macrotinae and Micronycterinae. Three studies
placed the genera Glyphonycteris and Trinycteris within
the subfamily Phyllostominae [5,45,49]. In contrast, our
data revealed a close relationship of Glyphonycteris and
Trinycteris with frugivorous species of the subfamily Car-

Different measures were calculated to describe clade stability: posterior probability, bootstrap value (BS), decay index (DI), Bayesian cluster
recognition (GMYC) and branch length. Further, trophic level of the bats was also considered (Figure 3). Decay indices were obtained with
TreeRot.v3 [117] in combination with the phylogenetic software PAUP 4.0 beta [89]. A decay index greater than ten is considered as strong
support for a specific node. Automated cluster recognition via the "Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent" (GMYC) approach with multiple
threshold extension was used [118-120]. Branches longer than the mean branch length (0.03 substitutions per position) are considered as
long. Congruence indices were calculated by the number of useable support measures for a specific node divided by the number of cases in
which there was high support.

olliinae. Despite low support for this sister-group relationship (BS 45), our data support a closer relationship of
Glyphonycteris and Trinycteris to fruit-eating species (BS
99) than to omnivorous phyllostomids of the subfamily
Phyllostominae.
The genus Rhinophylla does not belong to the subfamily Carolliinae, as proposed by McKenna and Bell (1997)
[47], Wetterer et al. (2000) [5], and Jones et al. (2002)
[50]. Our data support a sister-group relationship
between Rhinophylla and the subfamily Stenodermatinae,
as proposed by Baker et al. (2003) [48].
Many authors excluded the genera Phyllonycteris, Erophylla and Brachyphylla, all endemic to the West Indies,
from other nectarivorous phyllostomids and placed them
mostly into the subfamilies Phyllonycterinae and Brachyphyllinae [3,5,19,33,45,49,50,52-59]. In contrast, our data
show that these nutritionally more generalized bats
belong to the Glossophaginae (BS 100). The three genera
are closely related to more specialized nectarivorous bats
of the genera Glossophaga, Leptonycteris and Monophyllus. This is in line with an earlier molecular phylogeny of
Baker et al. (2003) [48]. The phylogenetic position of
highly specialized nectarivorous bats of the genera Lonchophylla and Lionycteris is controversial. Several studies,
primarily based on morphological analyses, placed them
within the Glossophaginae [5,46,47,52]. Instead, our
molecular data suggest that they are closer related to Rhinophyllinae, Stenodermatinae, Carolliinae, and Glyphonycterinae than to the Glossophaginae. This finding is in
line with previous studies of Koopman (1994) [49], Jones

et al. (2002) [50] and Baker et al. (2003) [48]. The distinctness of Lonchophyllinae is also supported by fixed
differences in the tongue morphology (see below)
between representatives of the Lonchophyllinae and
Glossophaginae [33].
In summary, our study supports the classification of
phyllostomid bats after Baker et al. (2003) [48]. Their
division into more subfamilies, compared to Koopman
(1994) [49] and Simmons (2005) [45], seems justifiable,
because this better reflects the remarkable ecological
diversity of this family.
Dietary diversification

The vast majority of bats feed on insects [4]. This
includes the family Mormoopidae, which represents the
sister group of the Phyllostomidae. In addition, the diet of
the most basal subfamilies Macrotinae and Micronycterinae consists mainly of insects (Figure 3). These findings
indicate, that the common ancestor of phyllostomid bats
was an insect-feeder. This supposition is also supported
by the maximum-likelihood reconstruction of the ancestral state (Figure 3).
Members of the Phyllostominae have a mixed diet. The
reconstruction of the ancestral state for this group
revealed that their physiological pre-adaptations to
omnivory could have evolved only once, and involved
metabolic changes from insectivorous to an omnivorous
diet. However, too little is known about the diet of these
bats. A high spacial and seasonal plasticity is observed
[60]. A few members of the Phyllostominae are carnivo-

rous and feed on small vertebrates [61]. For example, Trachops cirrhosus is specialized on tungara frogs [62,63].
Such a unique specialization likely evolved in a formerly
insectivorous/omnivorous species. It was shown, for the
seasonally carnivorous Greater Noctule bat (Nyctalus
lasiopterus, Vespertilionidae), that only minor changes
are needed to switch from insectivory to carnivory (inclusion of small vertebrates in the diet) [64,65]. The transition from large-bodied insects to small vertebrates as
prey does not need any major adaptations and occurred
several times independently in different bats and is correlated with an increase in body size [61].
A large number of phyllostomid species have a vegetarian diet. They form a monophyletic clade (BS 99), comprising the subfamilies Rhinophyllinae, Stenodermatinae,
Carolliinae, Glossophaginae, Lonchophyllinae, and surprisingly the Glyphonycterinae. The last subfamily
includes several strict insectivorous species; thus, a shift
from a vegetarian diet back to insectivory seems to be the
most plausible scenario. Alternatively, the Glyphonycterinae retained the ancestral insectivorous lifestyle. This
assumption would require that the frugivorous subfamilies Rhinophyllinae, Stenodermatinae and Carolliinae
have evolved their feeding specialization independently
from each other. However, the relevant node is weakly
supported in our phylogenetic reconstruction. It is also
possible (see Figure 2 based on mitochondrial data) that
the Glyphonycterinae represents a basal lineage to all frugivores and therefore possess the plesiomorphic state for
this group. The common ancestry of all frugivore species
was also postulated by previous studies [5,46,48,50,59].
However, there is a high dietary plasticity in this group.
For example, Carollia is a known switch hitter between
fruits and insects depending on the season (summarized
in
[66]).
The diphyly of the nectarivorous Lonchophyllinae and
Glossophaginae is surprising, since they resemble each
other in many morphological, behavioural, ecological,
and physiological traits (e.g. skull elongation, reduction of
dentition, hovering flight, forest foraging behaviour and
ability to metabolize pollen). Accordingly, these similari-

ties have evolved independently by natural selection during the adaptation to a nectar-feeding lifestyle. This
hypothesis is supported by some obvious differences in
these adaptive traits [33]: The lonchophyllines have a
deep longitudinal groove in their tongue, lined dorsal and
ventral with hairlike papillae. This groove is missing in
the glossophagines and hairlike papillae are distributed
anterodorsal, forming a brush tip. Furthermore, the lonchophyllines lost most types of papillae found on the
tongues of other phyllostmids, including the glossophagines. Also, the internal tongue structure is very different.
The lonchophyllines have complex, omnidirectional bundles of muscles within the tongue, while glossophagines
have predominantly horizontal skeletal muscle bundles.
The complex orientated muscles in the lonchophyllines
are supposed to control the shape of the groove during
nectar feeding [33]. Drinking behaviour varies widely
between both subfamilies (Marco Tschapka, pers. comm.,
[30]). Other characters show similar apomorphic states in
lonchophyllines and some glossophagines (e.g. posterior
shift of sternohyoid origin, xiphoid origin of sternohyoid,
elongated hyoglossus and loss of connection to hyoid
bone, double insertion of geniohyoid, posterior shift of
genioglossus insertion [33]), however, there are no consistent patterns. The endemic West Indian genera, Brachyphylla, Erophylla, and Phyllonycteris, show many
plesiomorphic characters. It seems that functional constraints on the muscular innervation of the tongue curtain the evolutionary signals of these characters. Hence, it
is possible that lonchophyllines and glossophagines may
have evolved these adaptations for nectar-feeding independently (but see also [67,68]).
The large number of species within the clade of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats (Figure 2) suggests, that a
shift to a vegetarian diet accelerated the diversification
rates in this group. The majority of phyllostomid bats,
117 out of 158 listed species [45], i.e. 74%, belong to this
clade. Possibly the presence of numerous vacant ecological niches in tropical and subtropical regions of America
(see also [69]) resulted in allopatric speciation.

Time frame of evolution

Our analysis revealed a time frame of ten million years
(29-20 MYA) from Oligocene to Early Miocene, in which
all prominent lineages evolved (Figure 4). Most of the
species diversification occurred subsequent to the Oligocene epoch (since 23 MYA). During the Miocene substantial changes of the landscape occurred in Tropical
America due to massive plate tectonics [70-75]. Global
climate cooled and resulted in an increase in aridity [7678]. Frequent isolation events could have resulted in allopatric populations and thus promoted speciation [79].
Interestingly, the radiation of extant hummingbirds (Trochilidae), another alimentary competitor, shows a similar
pattern of diversification in the Middle Miocene [80].
Geologic upheavals as well as the ability of ecologically
generalized species to invade new regions were considered as major forces promoting hummingbird radiations
in newly arisen montane regions. In order to test whether
these factors has also promoted speciation in bats, and to
infer other underlying evolutionary mechanisms, a much
denser taxon sampling is required.

Conclusions
Our analysis of more than 10.000 base pairs of concatenated DNA sequences reveals a strongly supported phyllostomid phylogeny, thus allowing for clear predictions
about the evolution of feeding specialization of these
bats. Several morphological and even molecular studies
were unable to resolve the specific branches with sufficient support, either due to the convergent nature of the
analyzed characters or insufficient amount of sequence
data. Our multi-gene approach, combined with a relaxed
clock analysis, detected and dated major splitting events
within this family. This study gives support for the classification of phyllostomid bats after Baker et al. (2003) [48].
All prominent lineages with diverse feeding strategies
evolved within a relatively short time frame of about ten
million years from Oligocene to Early Miocene. Geological and climate changes as well as the shift to a vegetarian
diet may have promoted the radiation into diverse lineages. In this context, the diphyly of the nectarivorous
Lonchophyllinae and Glossophaginae is remarkable.
Despite many similarities between both groups, it seems
plausible, that they evolved their adaptations to nectarivory independently from each other. This would represent an example of convergent evolution within bats that
led to very similar features, which play a major role in
food acquisition.
Methods
Taxon sampling

Thirty-seven phyllostomid species of 29 genera were analyzed. Our sampling comprises members of all extant
subfamilies [45,49], except bats of the subfamily Lon-

Page 9 of 14

chorhinae. We used species and subfamily assignments
according to Baker et al. (2003) [48]. One representative
each of the families Mormoopidae, Furipteridae, Noctilionidae, Molossidae and Vespertilionidae were used as
outgroup taxa. Two closely related specimens were used
for the family Rhinolophidae, because we were not able to
analyze all loci entirely for one taxon. GenBank accession
numbers are given in addtitional file 1. Tissue samples
were provided by cooperation partners (see acknowledgements). The name of the body which gave approval
and corresponding reference numbers could be obtained
from them.
Genetic analyses

Extraction of total genomic DNA was done by Chloroform-Isoamyl-Phenol precipitation. A 1.3 kb fragment of
the exon 28 of the von Willebrand factor gene (vwf) was
amplified with the primers vWF-A and vWF-B [81], or
with vWF-A and vWF-B2 [81] within a Nested PCR.
Primer vWF-B2 anneals 139 bp upstream from vWF-B.
An approximately 1.4 kb fragment of the recombination
activating gene 2 (rag2) was amplified with the primers
RAG2-F1 and RAG2-R2 [59], or with RAG2-F1B and
RAG2-R2 [59]. The PCR Mastermix (25 μl final reaction
volume) included 2 μl of total genomic DNA extract, 1.25
μl of each primer (10 μM), 1 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM), 1 μl of
a dNTP-Mix (10 mM) and 1 unit of Peglab Taq polymerase. Nested PCR was performed using 2 μl from a
1:40 delution of the first PCR reaction. The fragments
were amplified following a Two-Step protocol. Thermocycling consisted of a 3 min initial denaturation at 95°C,
followed by 5 cycles of 30s at 95°C, 50s at 65°C (for the
vwf), or 30s at 60°C (for the rag2), and 90s at 72°C. 35
cycles with 50s annealing at 62°C (for the vwf) and 30s at
57°C (for the rag2) were performed, followed by a final
extension of 6 min at 72°C. A fragment of exon 11 of the
breast cancer susceptibility gene (brca1) was amplified
with the primers BRCA1-F126 [82] and a newly designed
(ER 515: 5'- AAGTGTTGGAAGCAGGGAAGCTCTTC3'). The PCR-Mastermix (50 μl final reaction volume)
included 2 μl of total DNA extract, 2.5 μl of each primer
(10 μM) and 25 μl Phusion Mastermix. Thermocycling
consisted of a 30s initial denaturation at 98°C, followed by
5 cycles of 10s of 98°C, 25s at 66°C, and 90s at 72°C. 30
cycles with 25s annealing at 63°C were performed, followed by a final extension of 6 min at 72°C. Two non-coding nuclear loci were also analyzed: 3'-UTR region of the
phospholipase C beta 4 gene (plcb4) [83] and short intron
of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (pepck)
[84];
We amplified a mitochondrial fragment of the NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 1 gene (nd1) and the tRNA Leucin, using the primers ER 65 and ER 66 [85]. Published
sequences of five additional mitochondrial loci (COI,

Cytb, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and tRNA Valin) were incorporated. For all analyses, the ribosomal RNAs and the
tRNA Valin were combined (12StRNA16S). Accession
numbers are given in Additional file 1. It also includes an
overview of all incorporated taxa, loci and sequences and
the percentage of missing data per species, as well the
geographic origin of our samples. The overall amount of
missing data is about 30%.
Alignments and model selection

All alignments were done with Sequencher v4.7 [86] and
Bioedit v7.0.9 [87,88] and checked manually by eye. We
performed bootstrap analyses of each individual loci to
check for compatibility of their individual phylogenetic
signal. Because none of the strongly supported clades
based on individual loci were mutually incompatible, we
concatenated all loci except the ribosomal RNAs, tRNA
Valin and the rag2 gene. These loci were already used by
Baker and colleagues to infer a molecular phylogeny of
phyllostomid bats [48]. We avoided in a first step the
inclusion of them to get an independent data set [Alignment 1]. In a second step we concatenated all mitochondrial loci (this time with the inclusion of the ribosomal
RNAs and the tRNA Valin) [Alignment 2] and also all
nuclear loci (with rag2) [Alignment 3]. We concatenated
all loci into one supermatrix for the final analyses. The
supermatrix contained three nuclear protein-coding
genes (rag2, vwf and brca1), two non-coding nuclear
markers (pepck, plcb4), three mitochondrial protein-coding genes (co1, cytb and nd1), two tRNAs (Valin, Leucin)
and two mitochondrial rRNAs (12S, 16S). For the Bayesian analyses, we excluded all 3rd codon positions in the
mitochondrial protein-coding genes because they
showed a high degree of homoplasy (homoplasy index,
HI = 0.75 - parsimony analysis of the 3rd codon positions
in PAUP 4.0 beta [89]). Such high homoplastic characters
give a misleading phylogenetic signal and lead especially
to an underestimation of real branch lengths. Therefore,
we excluded them from the analyses. This resulted in a
final length of 10396bp, including 2761 parsimony informative characters [Alignment 4 - Additional file 2]. For
the maximum-likelihood analyses, we used a second
alignment, in which the mitochondrial protein-coding
sequences were translated in amino acids and combined
with the remaining DNA sequences [Alignment 5 - Additional file 3]. The best fitting evolutionary model for the
protein data was inferred with Prottest v1.4 [90]. The
MTMAM model, designed for the evolution of mitochondrial proteins of mammals [91], showed the highest
fit. We ran jModelTest [92] for the remaining DNA
sequences separate for the alignments 1-5. Except for
alignment 3, GTR+Γ [93] was proposed to be the best fitting evolutionary model according to Akaike- (AIC) and
Bayesian (BIC) information criterion [94,95]. The slightly

Page 10 of 14

simpler Symmetrical Model SYM+Γ [96] was proposed
for alignment 3 by jModelTest. However, we also used the
GTR+Γ model for this data set for general compatibility
among the inferences. Genes could have a different
sequence evolution. Therefore, we generated five partitioning schemes [97] for alignment 5 to decide, which is
the best adjustment for our analysis: (1) no partitioning;
(2) mitochondrial- and nuclear loci separately; (3) three
partitions; (4) eight partitions; and (5) 14 partitions with
partitioning into codon positions for all nuclear genes.
According to AIC and BIC, scheme 5 was preferred.
Maximum-Parsimony analysis

Equal weighted maximum-parsimony (MP) analyses were
performed with PAUP 4.0 beta [89] with a heuristic
search using the TBR (tree-bisection-reconnection) algorithm for branch swapping. Bootstrap inferences were
conducted separately for each loci with 500 pseudoreplicates.
Maximum-Likelihood analysis

Maximum-likelihood (ML) inferences were performed
with RAxML v7.0.4 [98-100]. ML searches were conducted with the rapid hill-climbing algorithm [101,102]
under GTR+Γ with four rate categories as model of evolution. Multiple independent runs were started to get an
impression of the robustness of the phylogenetic reconstruction. Support values were obtained through a full
non-parametric bootstrap- or rapid bootstrap inference
(stated for each analysis).
Reconstruction of ancestral states

Ancestral character states were reconstructed in Mesquite v2.71 [103]. Observed character states (insectivore,
sanguinivore, omnivore, frugivore and nectarivore) of the
main diet were mapped on the original maximum-likelihood tree (Figure 3). We used the "Trace Character History" analysis with a symmetric, one-parameter Markov
k-state model [104,105], which computes likelihoods for
categorical characters, and reconstructs ancestral states
by the maximum marginal probability (MLE) criterion.
Bayesian analysis

Bayesian inferences were performed with BEAST v1.4.8
[106]. The searches were conducted under HasegawaKishino-Yano HKY+Γ [107] with four rate categories as
model of evolution. We chose a simpler model of
sequence evolution for the Bayesian analyses as proposed
by jModelTest because there was a trade-off between
computational power and model complexity. It was not
possible to get a consistent phylogenetic reconstruction
between different runs under the GTR+Γ model in reasonable time. Bayes factor analysis between these runs
under the GTR+Γ model resulted always in values far
above 20 and sampling efficiency was drastically reduced

Datzmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:165
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/165

compared to the HKY+Γ model. A high Bayes factor is a
sign for incompatibility and poor convergence among the
trees gathered in independent runs.
Calibration of the molecular clock

We incorporated three different calibration points
including: (1) divergence between Vespertilionidae and
Molossidae set at 37 million years ago (MYA) in the Middle Eocene [47]; (2) age of the Mormoopidae oldest fossils
from Whitneyan (30-32 MYA) land deposits in Florida
[108]; and (3) age of the oldest crown group fossils of the
phyllostomids in the Laventan about 11.8 to 13.8 MYA
[109] and age of the oldest stem group fossils in the Whitneyan within the Early Oligocene [110]. We used the proposed age of the fossils and lognormal distributions to
model minimum age constraints for the specific nodes
(1,2). Maxmimum age constraints were set to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at 65 MYA (1,2). Additional, a
maximum age constraint for the phyllostomids (3) was
set with an exponential distribution to 34 MYA with an
arbitrarily lower limit of 11.5 MYA.
Model- and prior decision

We performed several Bayesian inferences under one
strict (CLOC) and two relaxed (UCLN, UCED) molecular
clock models [111,112]. Always 10 million steps were performed. We examined the joint influence of the calibrations on the divergence time estimates by running a strict
clock model with fixed topology, but with no sequence
data. Further, we examined the influence of each individual calibration by running several inferences under an
uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model (UCLN)
with all possible combinations of the three calibrations. A
precise examination and comparison of the results were
performed in Tracer v1.4 [113]. An overview of important parameters for model comparison is given in Table 2.
Important parameters, such as mean likelihood value,
substitution rate, and node age, were calculated for every
inference and compared with each other. Confidence
intervals measured as 95% highest posterior density
interval (HPD) were also computed. The clock model that
produced the smallest confidence intervals altogether
was considered most appropriate for the data [112].
Estimation of divergence times

We conducted three independent runs for the final divergence time estimates under the UCLN model with 20
million inferences and a sample frequency of 1000 steps.
We used always the same parsimony tree as starting
point. We compared the results and calculated pairwise
Bayes factors for the difference in their marginal likelihoods. The first 4 million steps were cut off as burnin for
each comparison. Low Bayes factors are a sign for high
convergence of the values and compatibility of the inferences, while high Bayes factors indicate incompatibility.
