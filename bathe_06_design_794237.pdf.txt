Abstract
Background: The β-proteobacterial species Comamonas testosteroni is capable of
biotransformation and also biodegradation of a range of chemical compounds and thus potentially
useful in chemical manufacturing and bioremediation. The ability to detect and quantify members
of this species in mixed microbial communities thus may be desirable.
Results: We have designed an oligonucleotide probe for use in fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) and two pairs of PCR primers targeting a C. testosteroni subgroup. The FISH probe and one
of the PCR primer pairs are suitable for quantification of C. testosteroni in mixed microbial
communities using FISH followed by quantitative image analysis or real-time quantitative PCR,
respectively. This has been shown by analysis of samples from an enrichment of activated sludge on
testosterone resulting in an increase in abundance and finally isolation of C. testosteroni. Additionally,
we have successfully used quantitative PCR to follow the C. testosteroni abundance during a
laboratory scale wastewater bioaugmentation experiment.
Conclusion: The oligonucleotides presented here provide a useful tool to study C. testosteroni
population dynamics in mixed microbial communities.

Background

Comamonas testosteroni is a ubiquitously occuring β-proteobacterial species which has been isolated from aquatic
as well as terrestrial environments. It has been shown to
be capable of transformations of steroid compounds [1-4]
and also of degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons [5-10].
C. testosteroni is thus of interest for potential biotechnological applications such as chemical transformations in
fine chemical manufacturing [11] and bioremediation
processes [7,12], as indicated by laboratory results.

Due to the widespread environmental distribution and
the potential relevance of C. testosteroni in biotransformation processes, it may be of interest to follow the population dynamics of this species over time in a mixed-species
environment. Since culture-dependent methods are not
sufficiently accurate to detect and quantify one particular
species within a mixed bacterial community, methods targeting the 16S rRNA and/or its gene(s) need to be applied
to such a problem, as has already been done in previous
investigations [13-16]. Probes for species of the genera

Comamonas and Delftia (COM1424 [17], and PPT [18]) as
well as for species of the family Comamonadaceae (CTE
[19]) have been described earlier, but might lack the
desired specificity. The use of reporter genes such as gfp or
dsRed is also possible, but only applicable to environments with intentionally introduced labelled strains and
not to the investigation of uncharacterized environmental
samples. Additionally, the introduction of reporter genes
may impair the environmental fitness of the introduced
strain [20], and variations in reporter expression might
interfere with detection. The use of reporter gene carrying
strains also means working with genetically modified
organisms, which may not be possible in all cases.
The following study reports on the development of 16S
rRNA sequence based oligonucleotide probes which are
suitable for detection and quantification of Comamonas
testosteroni in mixed cultures using PCR and/or fluorescent
in situ hybridization (FISH).

Results
16S rRNA sequence diversity of Comamonas
testosteroni
A short survey of 16S rRNA sequence diversity of C. testosteroni was carried out. Fig. 1 shows a phylogenetic tree
based on 16S rRNA sequences of species of the genera
Comamonas and Delftia, with an emphasis on sequences of
C. testosteroni isolates with more than 1200 bp length
available from Ribosomal Database Project II. The C. testosteroni sequences form two clades (designated A and B)
with a sequence divergence of approximately 1%. Clade A
contains far more sequences than clade B, and all physiologically characterized strains as well as all strains isolated
during studies dealing with biotransformation or biodegradation fall within this clade.
Probe design
The sequence alignment from which the tree was constructed was then used as a basis to identify sequence
regions which could be used for the design of FISH probes
and PCR primers specific for C. testosteroni. Useful
stretches were identified around nucleotides 450–480,
990–1020, and 1130–1160 (E. coli numbering). However, it was not possible to design oligonucleotides targeting simultaneously sequences from clades A and B
together. Since clade A seemed to contain the organisms
with a higher environmental and biotechnological relevance, we decided to design probes targeting this
sequence cluster. Two PCR primer pairs and one FISH
probe were designed (see Table 1). BLAST searches
revealed that these oligonucleotides had a complete
match only with sequences showing >99% identity to the
sequence of the C. testosteroni type strain.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/54

Pure culture evaluation of the designed oligonucleotides
All oligonucleotides were evaluated in situ on a selection
of proteobacterial pure cultures including all C. testosteroni
strains available from the German Collection of Microorganisms (DSM). The tests revealed that the newly
designed primers and probe were specific for the strains of
this species. Primer pair CteA1 yielded a PCR product with
a size of 571 bp, whereas primer pair CteA2 produced an
amplicon of 167 bp length. It should be noted here that
both primer pairs produced products from all examined
C. testosteroni cultures, indicating that all tested cultures
fell within clade A. A clade B culture was not available for
testing, but since all developed oligonucleotides except
primer CteA2-rev show 3 or more mismatches with the
available clade B sequences, it can be expected that these
strains would be excluded from detection by PCR or FISH.
The CY3 labelled FISH probe CteA gave well-fluorescing
signals when used with 30% of formamide in the hybridization buffer. Cells of all available C. testosteroni isolates
except of strain DSM 6781 gave well-fluorescing signals
when FISH was applied to paraformaldehyde fixed cells.
To identify the reason for the reduced signal intensity in
strain DSM 6781, its 16S rRNA sequence was determined
[EMBL:AM113745]. The sequence had a central mismatch
with probe CteA. Accordingly, we suggest to work with a
degenerate version of the probe with the sequence CAT
GAC CCG (G/A)GG ATA TTA GC. All non-target strains
tested did not produce PCR products with primers CteA1
and CteA2, nor did they give a fluorescence signal when
using probe CteA in FISH, although low background fluorescence was observed in some cultures.
Analysis of testosterone enrichment cultures and isolates
In order to test the developed oligonucleotides on an
unknown mixed culture, we provided conditions for the
enrichment of C. testosteroni from activated sludge by two
successive enrichment steps in liquid media containing
testosterone as the sole source of carbon and energy and
finally by spreading samples of the second culture on agar
plates composed of the same medium. Samples of the
activated sludge, the two enrichment cultures, and of five
isolates obtained from the testosterone plates were then
analysed by PCR and FISH.

Fig. 2 shows the results of an end-point PCR reaction (30
cycles) carried out using primer pair CteA1. No product
was obtained from DNA from the activated sludge, suggesting a low initial abundance of C. testosteroni. In contrast, DNA samples from both enrichment cultures as well
as two of the isolates produced a band at 570 bp, indicating a successful enrichment and isolation of C. testosteroni.
When the PCR product amplified from the first enrichment culture was subjected to direct sequencing, a clean
sequence [EMBL:AM113744] with 461 of the 462
obtained nucleotides identical to the sequence of C. testo-

steroni DSM 50244 was retrieved. Partial analysis of the
16S sequences of the isolates [EMBL:AM113739–
AM113743] showed that the two isolates giving PCR
products with the CteA1 primers displayed 100%
sequence identity with the sequence of C. testosteroni DSM
50244, whereas the other isolates showed 100% identities
to the sequences of Pseudomonas sp. B13 [GenBank:AF039489], Pseudomonas sp. WAS2 [Genand
Rhodococcus
equi
Bank:AB007999],
[GenBank:AF490539], respectively. The two C. testosteroni
strains could also be identified by FISH using the probe
CteA.

In order to assess the suitability of the oligonucleotides for
quantification of C. testosteroni in mixed cultures, primer
pair CteA2 was used in real-time quantitative PCR and
probe CteA was used for quantitative image analysis. The
primer pair Eub341F/534R and the FISH probes Eub338
mix were used in parallel as a measure of total cell abundance. The ratios between C. testosteroni specific signals
and the eubacterial specific signals will produce a fractional number representing the C. testosteroni abundance
in a given sample. This approach has been applied to cells
labelled by FISH [21] or fluorescent proteins [22] and has
also been used in real-time PCR quantification [14].

A dilution series of genomic DNA of C. testosteroni DSM
50244 yielded products from 5 fg on, which can be considered the detection limit, and showed a linear relationship between the Ct-value and the log(DNA amount) over
5 orders of magnitude (50 fg to 0.5 ng, Fig. 3a) with nearly
identical slopes close to the optimal value of -3.32 for the
CteA2 and the Eub primer pairs. This indicates that both
primer pairs are suitable for use in qPCR analysis. A comparison of the C. testosteroni fractional numbers obtained
by qPCR and FISH (Fig. 3b) shows identical trends for the
abundances of C. testosteroni in the activated sludge and
the following two enrichment steps. The initial C. testosteroni abundance was low (0.003% by qPCR, not detectable by FISH), and increased via a moderate level in the
first enrichment culture (3% by qPCR and FISH) to a
major proportion of the population detected by the EUB

Determination of C. testosteroni abundance in a reactor
bioaugmentation experiment via quantitative PCR
A further test of the qPCR primers CteA2 in mixed culture
experiments was done on DNA samples extracted from 3
laboratory scale biofilm reactors in an experiment to
introduce degradation of 3-chloroaniline (3CA) via conjugal transfer of the 3CA-degradative plasmid pNB2. A full
description of the experiment can be found elsewhere
[23]. Briefly, all reactors where initially inoculated with an
activated sludge-derived mixed bacterial culture. Reactor
PB then received a Pseudomonas putida strain and reactor P
received a Comamonas testosteroni strain, both carrying
plasmid pNB2, whereas control reactor N did not receive
additional bacteria. The P. putida strain was not able to
degrade 3CA, whereas the C. testosteroni strain was. All
reactors received a feed containing 3CA and four easily
degradable carbon sources (glucose, gluconate, acetate,
citrate). Reactor PB started to degrade 3CA after an initial
lag phase, and finally, a number of C. testosteroni pNB2transconjugants capable of 3CA-degradation could be isolated from this reactor. Reactor P showed 3CA-degradation from the beginning of the experiment on, whereas no
degradation could be observed in reactor N.

Using quantitative PCR, we determined the C. testosteroni
abundance in DNA samples obtained at the start of the
experiment (day 0) as well as on day 18 after onset of degradation of reactor P and towards the end of the experiment on day 29 (Fig. 4). Whereas initial abundance of C.
testosteroni in reactor PB was low around 1% and rose via
3% to a final level of 9%, reactor P initially showed a high
C. testosteroni abundance of 36% due to addition of the
pNB2-carrying C. testosteroni strain which then dropped to
values around 18%. Surprisingly, reactor N showed the
same trend as reactor PB with an increase of the C. testo-

steroni abundance from low levels of 2% to finally 10%.
Although the increase in C. testosteroni abundance in reactor PB is partly explained by growth of a 3CA-degrading,

pNB2-carrying C. testosteroni subpopulation, this indicates
that also non-degrading C. testosteroni strains might benefit from the general growth conditions in our reactors.

Discussion
In our study, we present two sets of PCR primers and an
rRNA directed oligonucleotide probe for use in FISH
which can be applied for detection and quantification of
a Comamonas testosteroni subgroup in mixed bacterial populations.

respectively.

Relative quantifications (target group vs. a measure of
whole eubacterial cell abundance) conducted by real-time
PCR and FISH followed by image analysis demonstrate
the same development of C. testosteroni populations during an enrichment process using testosterone as a carbon
source. However, since neither of the two methods measure cell number, but rRNA gene copy number (PCR) and
cell area (FISH), a direct numerical comparison is not possible here. Both quantification methods may display a
sample-inherent bias, when the average 16S rRNA gene
copy number per cell differs from the number of 16S
rRNA gene copies per C. testosteroni cell in PCR or the average cell area in a sample differs from the average area of a
C. testosteroni cell in FISH. Additionally, we applied the
real-time PCR approach presented here to successfully
determine abundance of C. testosteroni in a set of laboratory-scale wastewater treatment reactors inoculated with
activated sludge bacteria and additionally bioaugmented

spread onto MMO plates with testosterone which were
incubated for 7 d at 30°C.

Comparison of the target groups of the new probe set with
the previously described probes targeting Comamonas species reveals that our oligonucleotides exclusively match
sequences of Comamonas testosteroni strains. Primer CteA2rev is somewhat less specific, but the combination with
primer CteA2-for ensures specificity of the primer pair. In
contrast, probe CTE matches with most sequences of the
genera Comamonas, Acidovorax and Hydrogenophaga, but
has mismatches with the sequences of C. koreensis, Comamonas sp. 12022, C. testosteroni SMCC B329 (clade B), and
of the Delftia species among the sequences shown in Fig.
1. Probe PPT targets mainly Comamonas and Acidovorax,
but both PPT and CTE also target a range of sequences
from other genera of the Comamonadaceae [24]. Among
the previously published probes, COM1424 has the narrowest range targeting predominantly Comamonas and
Delftia [24].

Primer and probe design and evaluation
A multiple sequence alignment and calculation of a phylogenetic tree of a selection of 16S rRNA gene sequences of
the genus Comamonas was done using ClustalX 1.81 [31]
(see Fig. 1 for the sequences included in the analysis).
Sequence stretches showing identities within C. testosteroni clade A sequences, but having mismatches to the
remaining sequences, were used to design species-specific
oligonucleotides. The sequences of the oligonucleotides
which were finally used in this study are shown in Table 1.

Conclusion
The oligonucleotides presented here are a useful tool to
study C. testosteroni population dynamics in mixed microbial communities, when considering the method-inherent bias disussed above.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
The following strains of Comamonas testosteroni were used:
DSM 38, 1455, 1622, 6781, 11414, 12678, 50241, 50242,
50244, LMG 19554, SB3 [25] and SB4 [25]. In addition,
C. aquatica ATCC 11330, C. nitrativorans DSM 13191, C.
koreensis TK17 [26], C. terrigena TK41 [26], Delftia acidovorans ATCC 15668, Delftia tsuruhatensis SB5 [25], Pseudomonas putida DSM 291, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1
[27], Novosphingobium capsulatum DSM 30196, Aeromonas
hydrophila DSM 30187, Escherichia coli DH5α, Serratia
ficaria ATCC 33105, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD413
[28], Ralstonia eutropha DSM 531, and Burkholderia cepacia
H111 [29] were included as non-target organisms. All cultures were maintained on nutrient broth at 30°C.
Enrichment of Comamonas testosteroni from activated
sludge
Activated sludge was obtained from the aeration basin of
the municipal wastewater treatment plant Garching (Germany). A sample representing approximately 1 mg of dry
weight was inoculated into 25 ml of MMO medium [30]
containing 0.05% testosterone (added as a 10% solution
in DMSO) as the sole carbon source and incubated for 4
d (30°C, 150 rpm), until the disappearance of the testosterone crystals indicated degradation of the compound.
250 μl of this culture was inoculated into 25 ml of fresh
medium and again incubated for 2 d, and a sample was

The specificities of the primers and probes developed in
this study as well as those of the probes COM1424, CTE,
and PPT were checked using BLAST within the NCBI website [32] as well as the ProbeMatch tool in the RDP-II [33].
PCR
For PCR from pure cultures, cells suspended in water were
used as template DNA. DNA from activated sludge and
the enrichment cultures was isolated as described previously
[34].

Conventional PCR was carried out using a Mastercycler
gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and Qiagen
HotStarTay DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
A single reaction contained 0.2 μM of each primer CteA1for and CteA1-rev, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.02 U/μl of Taq Polymerase in a volume of 20 μl. Either
1 μl of cell suspension or 10 ng of DNA was added as template DNA. The PCR protocol consisted of an initial denaturation of 15 min at 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec
at 95°C, 1 min at 58°C and 2 min at 72°C and was concluded by a final extension of 8 min at 72°C. To exclude
the possibility of PCR inhibition, parallel positive control
reactions using the general eubacterial primers 341F and
534R were conducted for each template. The 16S rRNA
genes of isolates were partially amplified using primers
27F and 1492R [35] and custom sequenced using primer
341F by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). PCR products were analysed on 2% TAE agarose gels.
Real-time PCR was carried out in an ABI GeneAmp 5700
device (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) using the
Qiagen Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Kit. Each reaction was
performed in triplicate and contained 12.5 μl of PCR-Mastermix, 0.2 μM of either each primer CteA2-for and CteA2rev or 341f and 534r, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 μl of template
DNA in a final volume of 25 μl. The thermal protocol consisted of 15 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at
95°C and 60 sec at 60°C. The same serial 10fold dilutions
of genomic DNA of Comamonas testosteroni DSM 50244T

were used to generate standard curves for both primer
pairs.
FISH and image analysis
FISH was performed as described [36], using paraformaldehyde as a fixative. For elucidation of the hybridization
conditions for the probe CteA, hybridization temperature
was kept constant at 46°C. The formamide concentration
in the hybridization buffer was varied by 10% increments.
C. testosteroni LMG 19554 and C. aquatica ATCC 11330
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
The formamide concentration which resulted in clear
strong signals for C. testosteroni and no signals for C. aquatica was used in subsequent hybridizations. Probe CteA
was labelled with the cyanine dye CY3, whereas the EUB
probe mix (an equimolar mixture of probes EUB338,
EUB338-II, and EUB338-III) was labelled with the cyanine dye CY5. All hybridizations were performed as
simultaneous dual colour hybridizations where the EUB
mix served the role of a general counter stain for total bacterial cell number. Images were recorded using a Zeiss
LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) confocal laser
scanning microscope. For quantitative analyses, the percentages of area coverage of signals from the CteA probe
and the EUB mix were calculated using the Quantimet
Q500W (Leica, Cambridge, England) image analysis system. The abundance of C. testosteroni was calculated as the
ratio of the area covered by biomass stained simultaneously with both CteA and EUB probes to the area covered
by EUB-stained biomass only. For each sample, 20 microscopic fields (92 × 92 μm) were analysed.
