Abstract
Background: Based on a report for one species (Scylla serrata), it is widely believed that mud crabs are relatively
resistant to disease caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). We tested this hypothesis by determining the
degree of susceptibility in two species of mud crabs, Scylla olivacea and Scylla paramamosain, both of which were
identified by mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal gene analysis. We compared single-dose and serial-dose WSSV
challenges on S. olivacea and S. paramamosain.
Findings: In a preliminary test using S. olivacea alone, a dose of 1 × 106 WSSV copies/g gave 100% mortality
within 7 days. In a subsequent test, 17 S. olivacea and 13 S. paramamosain were divided into test and control
groups for challenge with WSSV at 5 incremental, biweekly doses starting from 1 × 104 and ending at 5 × 106
copies/g. For 11 S. olivacea challenged, 3 specimens died at doses between 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 copies/g and
none died for 2 weeks after the subsequent dose (1 × 106 copies/g) that was lethal within 7 days in the
preliminary test. However, after the final challenge on day 56 (5 × 106 copies/g), the remaining 7 of 11 S. olivacea
(63.64%) died within 2 weeks. There was no mortality in the buffer-injected control crabs. For 9 S. paramamosain
challenged in the same way, 5 (55.56%) died after challenge doses between 1 × 104 and 5 × 105 copies/g, and
none died for 2 weeks after the challenge dose of 1 × 106 copies/g. After the final challenge (5 × 106 copies/g) on
day 56, no S. paramamosain died during 2 weeks after the challenge, and 2 of 9 WSSV-infected S. paramamosain
(22.22%) remained alive together with the control crabs until the end of the test on day 106. Viral loads in these
survivors were low when compared to those in the moribund crabs.
Conclusions: S. olivacea and S. paramamosain show wide variation in response to challenge with WSSV. S. olivacea
and S. paramamosain are susceptible to white spot disease, and S. olivacea is more susceptible than S.
paramamosain. Based on our single-challenge and serial challenge results, and on previous published work
showing that S. serrata is relatively unaffected by WSSV infection, we propose that susceptibility to white spot
disease in the genus Scylla is species-dependent and may also be dose-history dependent. In practical terms for
shrimp farmers, it means that S. olivacea and S. paramamosain may pose less threat as WSSV carriers than S. serrata.
For crab farmers, our results suggest that rearing of S. serrata would be a better choice than S. paramamosain or
S. olivacea in terms of avoiding losses from seasonal outbreaks of white spot disease.

Hypothesis
White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the world’s most
serious disease threat to all species of cultivated shrimp,
and is also known to infect many other crustacean species that can act as carriers [1,2]. Among these carriers,

mud crabs have been considered to be a particularly
dangerous threat to shrimp farms because they are generally believed (based on a report for the species Scylla
serrata) to be highly tolerant to WSSV and remain
infected for long periods of time without signs of disease
[2-4]. We wished to test this hypothesis by determining
the degree of susceptibility and tolerance to WSSV
infection in common Thai species of Scylla other than
Scylla serrata. To do so, it was first necessary for us
to develop a mitochondrial 16 S rDNA method to

distinguish among 4 Scylla species found in Thailand,
because species determination by morphology alone
remains controversial [5-8].

Scylla species identification by analysis of 16 S
rDNA sequences
To develop a species identification method based on
mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences, reference
sequences of S. serrata (GenBank Accession Number
AF109318), S. paramamosain (AF109319), S. olivacea
(AF109321) and S. tranquebarica (AF109320) were used
to design primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis and sequencing. The PCR primer 16sar-L (5’
cgcctgtttatcaaaaacat 3’) was designed by Imai et al. [9],
and primer 16sar-R (5’ ggtctgaactcagatcacgt 3’) was
designed in this study. Each PCR reaction consisted of
10×PCR buffer, 0.75 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM dNTPs, 0.15
μM of each primer, 2.5 U taq DNA polymerase and 100
ng DNA in a total volume of 100 μl reaction. The thermocycling profile was 2 min at 94°C followed by 30
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 45°C for 30 sec and 72°C 1.5
min. Sequencing was performed by Macrogen Inc., Seoul,
Korea. Each sequence was confirmed manually via electropherogram analysis (BioEdit 7.0.0, Carlsbad, CA) [10].
This method was used with 31 Scylla samples arbitrarily collected from 500 g male mud crabs from Samutprakarn and Samutsongkram provinces, Thailand,
during 3 different months in 2008. Since the Ethical
Principles and Guidelines for the Use of Animals of the
National Research Council of Thailand (1999) apply to
vertebrates only and there is no official standard for
invertebrates, we adapted its principles to crabs. We
also followed the guidelines of the Australian, New
South Wales state government for the humane harvesting of fish and crustaceans http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/
agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/general/fish/shellfish
with respect to details regarding the transport of the
crabs and their laboratory maintenance. With respect to
processing the crabs for histological analysis or for killing at the end of an experiment, the salt water/ice slurry
method was used as recommended in the Australian
guidelines. The amplicon sizes obtained using our 16 S
rDNA PCR method were 562 base pairs (bp) for S. olivacea, S. serrata and S. paramamosain and 563 bp for
S. tranquebarica. These sequences together with the
corresponding regions from GenBank records of Scylla
species (above), were compared using MEGA 3.1 software [10,11]. Pairwise distances were calculated by the
p-distance model using the program default parameters,
including different substitution rates for transitions and
transversions and a uniform rate of substitution among
sites [12]. Pairwise % nucleotide identities and p-distances indicated a close relationship between S. paramamosain and S. tranquebarica (95.7% nt identity and

Page 3 of 12

0.041 p-distance), whereas S. olivacea and S. serrata
showed a relatively lower percent nt identity and the
greatest p-distances (90.8% nt identity and 0.086 p-distance) to the other species. Neighbor-joining trees calculated using the Kimura-2-parameter model and
assuming constant nucleotide frequencies and rates of
substitution among sites [12,13] revealed 4 clusters that
clearly corresponded to the 4 species (Figure 1). Bootstrap replicates (= 1,000) were used to determine the
percent confidence for each clustering branch. The
topology for any branch with a bootstrap value of 95%
or higher is considered true clustering [11]. S. tranquebarica was not found in our 31 samples while there
were 17 S. olivacea, 13 S. paramamosain and only 1 S.
serrata. Since there was only one specimen of S. serrata,
it was not included in the ongoing tests with WSSV.

WSSV stock inoculum and virulence confirmation
in shrimps
WSSV inoculum was kindly provided by the Shrimp
Cultivation Research Center, Charoen Pokphand Group,
Thailand. Number of WSSV copies was determined by
real-time PCR (qPCR). For quantitation of WSSV stock
and WSSV in the samples, DNA (100 ng) were used as
the template in a total 20 μl reaction mixture containing
1× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen,
the Netherlands) and 300 nM of each primer for qPCR
using ABI 7500 SDS machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers 229F1 (5’ gatggaaacggtaacgaatctgaa 3’) and 447R1 (5’ cagagcctagtctatcaatcat 3’)
were designed from the WSSV genome (GenBank
Accession No. AF440570) [14]. Each qPCR plate contained standard curve samples, triplicates of each DNA
sample, and a no-template control. The thermocycling
profile was 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°
C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s [14]. For all
experiments, the specificity of the amplified products
was verified by analyses of the dissociation curves to
verify the melting temperature for each amplicon. The
quantity was determined from the standard curve of Ct
values and WSSV copy numbers. Results were expressed
as mean copy numbers ± standard deviations (SDs) for
triplicate samples.
For semi-quantitative estimation of WSSV copy numbers, the IQ2000™WSSV Detection and Prevention System (Farming IntelliGene Technology Corporation,
Taipei, Taiwan) was used. Using 100 ng of total DNA as
the template, infections could be classified as absent,
very light, light, moderate and severe based on 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis patterns of PCR amplicons,
and these were approximately equal to the following
respective WSSV copy numbers in the 100 ng template:
0 to <10, 10 to <20, 20 to <200, 200 to <2,000 and
2,000 to <20,000.

Thailand. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences of reference S. serrata, S. paramamosain,
S. tranquebarica and S. olivacea, and 31 recent Scylla species collected from Samutprakarn and Samutsongkram provinces of Thailand. Yellow

percent bootstrap confidence calculated from 1000 bootstrap resamplings. Bootstrap values of 50% and below have been omitted in the figure.
Each branch distance corresponds to sequence divergence.

To measure WSSV loads in shrimp, hemolymph was
withdrawn from the ventral sinus into a syringe containing anticoagulant I (ACI) (0.45 M NaCl, 0.1 M glucose,
30 mM Na-citrate, 26 mM citric acid, 10 mM EDTA,
pH 7.0) [15] in a 1:2 volume-to-volume ratio. DNA was
extracted following the manufacturer’s protocols using a
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). The DNA concentration and quality were

measured by spectrophotometry at A260 and A280, and
the amount of WSSV in the samples was determined as
described above.
To verify virulence of the WSSV stock, 2 specific
pathogen-free (SPF) whiteleg shrimp P. vannamei and
6 SPF black tiger shrimp P. monodon were injected with
5 × 106 copies/g tissue at the first abdominal segment.
Shrimp mortality for P. vannamei and P. monodon was

Preliminary, single-dose challenge with Scylla
olivacea
Because injection is considered an effective route of
WSSV infection in crabs [4], different WSSV copies per
gram of crab tissue in a total sterile phosphate buffer
saline (PBS) volume of 300 μl was injected into each
crab at the coxa of the right swimming leg using a 26G1
syringe (Nipro Corporation Ltd.). A preliminary singledose challenge test with 34 male S. olivacea was carried
out to determine appropriate viral challenge doses for
crabs. They were divided into three groups. One group
(n = 9) was injected with a single dose of 1 × 105 WSSV
copies per g, one group (n = 13) with 1 × 10 6 WSSV
copies per g and one control group (n = 12) with buffer
solution.
At the low injection dose (1×105), 4 of 9 (44%) died
within 7 days while 5 of 9 (56%) survived for more than
30 days. However, at a higher dose (1×106), 6 of 13 died
on day 3 post injection (46% mortality), 4 more died on
day 4 (77% cumulative mortality), 2 more on day 5 (92%
cumulative mortality) and 1 on day 7 (100% cumulative
mortality in 7 days). None of the 12 buffer-injected
crabs died over the 30 day experimental period. These
results indicated that a single, high dose challenge with
the WSSV inoculum was lethal for S. olivacea as it was
for shrimp. This contrasted markedly with results from
a previous report in which S. serrata challenged with
WSSV showed severe WSSV lesions by histopathological
analysis but no mortality [1,3,17].

weight, and artificial seawater at 28 parts per thousand
(ppt) salinity was replaced to the level where the crabs
still had some area to come out of the water [1,18].
For the challenge tests with each species, 18 crabs
were acclimatized for 1-2 weeks after which it was
expected that 10-12 each would be used for WSSV challenge and 5-6 each for PBS buffer-injected controls.
However, since only 30 (not 36) remained in sufficiently
good health for testing at the end of acclimatization (17
S. olivacea and 13 S. paramamosain), they were divided
into 20 crabs (11 S. olivacea and 9 S. paramamosain)
for challenge with WSSV, and 10 (6 S. olivacea and 4 S.
paramamosain) as controls. They were numbered
sequentially for each species (So 1 to 17 and Sp 1 to 13)
but selected arbitrarily for inclusion in challenge or control groups. WSSV challenge began with 1 × 104 WSSV
copies/g at day 0 followed every 14 days by increasing
doses of 1 × 105, 5 × 105, 1 × 106 and ending with 5 ×
106 WSSV copies/g at day 56. The crabs were observed
for further 50 days after the final challenge dose (a total
of 106 days for the whole challenge experiment).
For these tests, all the buffer-injected control crabs
were healthy as defined by no appetite loss, no weight
loss, reactive swimming and walking legs, and no mortality throughout the experimental period (106 days)
plus the period of 4-10 days during which the crabs
were acclimatized, screened for specific pathogens and
subjected to PCR and sequencing for species identification. None of the controls for either species gave positive results for WSSV using the IQ2000 test kit, qPCR
or histological analysis. For the test crabs given multiple
challenges with WSSV, there were generally three types
of outcomes as follows: (i) moribund at low dose (< 106
copies/g), (ii) moribund at high dose (5×106 copies/g),
and (iii) survival at high dose (5×106 copies/g).
To quantify WSSV in each crab by qPCR or test kit
(see above), hemolymph was withdrawn at the coxa of
the right swimming leg using a 26G1” syringe (Nipro
Corporation Limited, Bangkok, Thailand) containing the
same anticoagulant used for shrimp above. DNA extraction was also carried out in the same manner.

Serial-dose challenge protocol
Male mud crabs (500 g) were collected from Samutprakarn and Samutsongkram provinces, Thailand, and species was determined by 16 S rDNA analysis as described
above. Each crab was free of WSSV, yellow head virus
(YHV) and infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic
necrosis virus (IHHNV) as determined using standard
commercial kits for nested PCR and RT-PCR detection
(IQ 2000 detection system, Gene Reach, Taiwan). Individual crabs were cultivated in separate plastic containers
at room temperature with aeration [18]. Every 24-30 h,
crabs were fed with boiled fish at 10% of their body

Serial-dose challenge with Scylla olivacea
Of the 11 S. olivacea specimens used for the serial-challenges with WSSV (Figure 2a), there was no mortality in
14 days following the initial 1 × 10 4 challenge dose,
while 2 specimens died 7 days following the 2nd challenge dose (1×105 copies/g) and 1 died 3 days following
the third challenge dose (5×105 copies/g). Curiously, no
mortality occurred during the 2-week period following
the dose of 1 × 106 copies/g, despite the fact that the
dose was 100% lethal in the preliminary single challenge
test with this species. All the remaining 8 crabs died
within 7 to 17 days following the 5th (highest) challenge

50% and 100%, respectively, within 3-4 days after injection and moribund shrimp gave IQ2000 test results for
severe WSSV infection levels. Matching qPCR results
ranged from 2 × 10 4 - 1.3 × 10 6 copies/100 ng DNA
(data not shown). This was equivalent to approximately
2 × 104 - 1.3 × 106 WSSV copies in 33.33 μl of infected
shrimp hemolymph.
These results were similar to those previously published for these and other species of penaeid shrimp
that usually show 100% mortality within 5-10 days after
injection with similar doses of WSSV [16].

dose (5×106 copies/g). The longest survival was for one
specimen at 73 days after the initial challenge and the
mean time to death was 55.9 ± 20.6 days and the
Kaplan-Meier survival probability [19] was 0.63 for 63
days and 0 for 70 days. For this species, the majority of
the crabs fell into two rough groups, one that showed
mortality after a relatively low challenge dose of WSSV

and one that showed mortality only after the highest
dose (5×106 copies/g).
All the challenged S. olivacea gave positive reactions
for severe WSSV infections using the IQ2000 test kit,
except for the 2 crabs that died after the lowest challenge dose of 1 × 10 5 copies/g. These gave negative
results with the kit. Their WSSV copies were also below

Somboonna et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:315
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/315

the qPCR detection limit. For 8 of the 9 IQ2000 test kitpositive moribund samples, results corresponded to
those for qPCR where viral levels ranged from 3.1 × 107
to 3.4 × 109 WSSV copies per 100 ng total DNA (mean
6.5 × 108 copies per 100 ng total DNA). Extracted DNA
of 100 ng represented a fresh muscle tissue weight of
approximately 0.15 mg, so qPCR results would have to
be multiplied by 6.7 × 10 3 to obtain viral loads per g
fresh crab tissue. Curiously, one sample (So6) gave a
reaction for severe infection with the test kit but a
qPCR result for only 7 × 103 WSSV copies per 100 ng
total DNA. Of the 9 specimens that gave results for
severe reactions with the kit, 7 were examined histologically and all were positive with typical WSSV lesions
(Figure 3) except for So6.
In addition, hemocytes of 2 samples (So5 and So13)
were examined by confocal microscopy for the presence
of WSSV by immunohistochemistry. Hemolymph was
collected in 1:1 vol./vol. of hemolymph fixative (0.45 M
NaCl and 4% formalin in sterile distilled water) and
then further fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Acros
Organics, Morris Plains, NJ, USA) for immunofluorescence analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against
WSSV recombinant VP28 (rVP28) envelope protein.
Detection was achieved using a secondary antibody
labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) as previously described [20]. Negative controls included hemocytes from buffer-injected crabs
stained with the anti-WSSV polyclonal antibody, hemocytes from infected crabs with no anti-WSSV polyclonal
antibody label, and hemocytes from infected crabs that
were stained with a polyclonal antibody raised against
monodon baculovirus (MBV), which is not known to
infect crabs. TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was used
for nucleic acid counterstaining. Immunofluorescentlabeled cells were analyzed by an FV1000 confocal laser
scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Results
showed immunopositive signals in the cytoplasm for the
majority of the hemocytes (Figure 4b).
The multiple challenge group at the highest challenge
dose also died, gave test kit results for severe WSSV infections and also showed severe histopathology typical of
WSSV. More difficult to explain is the mortality of the 2 S.
olivacea specimens that died after an injection dose of 1 ×
105 or fewer WSSV copies per g and gave negative results
for WSSV by both test-kit assay and qPCR. We assume
that they died as a result of some undetermined complication resulting from the WSSV injection, but not because
of WSSV alone and not because of the injection process
itself, since none of the control crabs died after buffer
injections. Similar examples occurred with S. paramamosain (below). Most of the S. olivacea specimens were not
examined histologically because the few examined gave

consistent results for severe infections by histopathology
and qPCR. We cannot explain the disparity between the
test-kit result for severe WSSV infection and the qPCR
result for a low WSSV load in specimen So6.
In summary, the overall results suggested that S. olivace was generally as susceptible to mortality from
WSSV as P. vannamei and P. monodon. However, the
fact that approximately 50% of the S. olivacea specimens
died within 3 days in the single dose challenge at 1 ×
106 copies of WSSV per g but that 7 of 11 (63.64%) survived for 2 weeks after the same dose in the multiple
challenge test indicates that a prior infection with
WSSV could aid in the ability of the crabs to better survive a subsequent challenge. This is not surprising in
the light of the fact that shrimp survivors from WSSV
outbreak ponds have been shown to survive a WSSV
challenge dose sufficient to kill uninfected shrimp
[21,22], and that prior injection of shrimp with inactivated WSSV can result in improved survival upon subsequent challenge [23]. S. olivacea would be a good
model for a molecular study on the comparative
response of multiple-challenge crabs that survive the
WSSV dose (1 × 106 copies/g) that was sufficient to kill
naïve crabs.

Serial-dose challenge with Scylla paramamosain
Of 9 S. paramamosain specimens used for serial WSSV
challenges (Figure 2b), 2 specimens died within 2 weeks
after the 1st challenge dose (1×104). There was no additional mortality in the 2-week interval after the 2nd challenge dose (1×105), but 2 specimens died within 2 days
and 1 specimen within 12 days after the 3rd challenge
dose (5×105). As with S. olivacea, no subsequent mortality occurred within two weeks after challenge with a
dose of 1 × 106 copies/g. Then, 2 specimens died within
17 days after the 5th and highest challenge dose (5×106),
while the two remaining crabs were still alive and active
at the end of the experiment on day 106. The mean
time to death for those that died was 37.0 ± 27.5 days,
and this was not significantly different (p = 0.11) from
that for S. olivacea (55.9 ± 20.6). The Kaplan-Meier survival probability of S. paramamosain for 63 days was
0.44 (0.63 for S. olivacea) but for 70 to 106 days
was 0.22 (0 for S. olivacea). Similar to S. olivacea, there
was one group of crabs that died after low challenge
doses and one (22.22%) that died after the highest challenge dose. Unlike S. olivacea, there was an additional
group (22.22%) that did not die, even at the highest
challenge dose. In addition, S. paramamosain showed a
pattern of proportionally higher mortality at low WSSV
doses and proportionally lower mortality at high doses,
a pattern that was opposite to that for S. olivacea.
For S. paramamosain, the moribund specimens challenged with doses of 5 × 10 5 or less gave negative

reactions for WSSV infections using the IQ2000 test kit,
negative qPCR results (i.e., below the detection limit)
and negative histopathology for WSSV lesions (Figure
5a). Of the three specimens that died after the challenge
dose of 5 × 105 (i.e., Sp5, 6, 7) histological examination
revealed the presence of severe lesions by other pathogens that may have been the cause of mortality (Figure
5b-d). In Sp5, there were severe lesions in tubule

epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas that showed parasite nuclei of large and small sizes, resembling those of
a microsporidian undergoing spore development [24]
(Figure 5b). In Sp6, the hepatopancreas had severe
lesions of a different type, this time in the connective
tissue cells showing very large, eosinophilic, viral-like,
cytoplasmic inclusions and accompanied by hemocytic
aggregation (Figure 5c). In Sp7, the connective tissue of

the hepatopancreas, muscle and epidermis showed large
numbers of small, magenta, viral-like, cytoplasmic inclusions often adjacent to nuclei (Figure 5d). The severity
and number of these lesions were consistent with possible cause of mortality. Hemocytes of these specimens
examined by confocal microscopy (as described above)
revealed positive immunofluorescence for WSSV in the
cytoplasm (Figure 4d).

results for severe WSSV infections and this corresponded to the qPCR results of 1.2 × 109 and 8.9 × 108

WSSV copies per 100 ng total DNA. The 2 remaining
crabs that still survived at the end of the experiment
(106 days) gave IQ2000 test kit results for a medium
infection and a medium-to-severe infection, and the corresponding qPCR results gave 2.9 × 103 and 5.4 × 103
WSSV copies per 100 ng total DNA, respectively. None
of these high-dose specimens were examined for WSSV
histopathology, but the 2 crabs that survived to the end
of the experiment (106 days) showed positive immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of very few hemocytes on
day 59 (data not shown) and most of the hemocytes on
day 82 (Figure 4d), which was 26 days after the highest

dose challenge on day 56. The nuclei of these hemocytes
were condensed and often fragmented possibly indicating apoptosis leading to hemocyte depletion as previously reported for shrimp infected with WSSV [25].
Results for S. paramamosain are more difficult to
interpret than those for S. olivacea because all 5 crabs
that died at injection doses lower than 1 × 106 WSSV
copies per g gave negative test results for WSSV

infection using both the IQ2000 kit and qPCR. If they
had died from WSSV, kit reactions for severe WSSV
infections and qPCR results indicating high loads of
WSSV would have been expected. Histopathological
analysis for 3 of the 5 specimens revealed no WSSV
lesions but instead severe lesions from at least 3
unknown pathogens that could have been the cause of
their death. As with the 2 similar, low-dose challenge

S. olivacea specimens described above, we assume that
these S. paramamosain died as a result of some undetermined complication resulting from the WSSV injection, but not because of WSSV alone and not because
of the injection process itself, since none of the control
crabs died after buffer injections.
Although the S. paramamosain specimens did not
show typical WSSV lesions with enlarged basophilic
nuclei in normal WSSV-target tissues such as the subcuticular epidermis and gills, they did show immunopositive hemocytes, most with condensed or karyorrhectic
nuclei indicative of apoptosis as previously reported for
WSSV infections in shrimp [25]. In addition, the two
specimens (Sp12 and Sp13 representing 22.22% of the
crabs) that survived the highest WSSV challenge dose
showed WSSV immunopositive hemocytes after challenge on day 56, and the proportion of positive cells was
higher on day 87 than on day 59, indicating that viral
replication had occurred in the interim. For these specimens, the PCR test kit results were below the severe
level and the WSSV loads by qPCR were low. Furthermore, the immunopositive reaction was in the hemocyte
cytoplasm only, while WSSV virions are normally
assembled in the nucleus. Using these facts to attempt
to explain our results, we speculate that hemocytes may
be the prime target for WSSV in S. paramamosain and
that the virus may replicate there, but induce apoptosis
before mature virions are assembled. The resulting
depletion of hemocytes could impair the host ability to
combat pre-existing infections or new infections by
other pathogens, and that would explain the variety in
the histopathology seen in the moribund S. paramamosain we examined. It would also explain why there was
no mortality from other infectious agents in the control
crabs injected with buffer only. At the same time, it
would also suggest that the hemocytes play an important role in the S. paramamosain response to WSSV,
and that they normally limit or clear WSSV, except
when overwhelmed by a sufficient challenge dose. Thus,
S. paramamosain challenged with WSSV may be a good
model organism to study the process of WSSV clearance
in crabs.

Overall comparison
In summary, the results revealed great individual variation in the response of S. olivacea and S. paramamosain
to WSSV. At the same time, both species are susceptible
to white spot disease, in contrast with S. serrata that has
been reported to show no mortality even in the presence
of extensive WSSV lesions. In addition, S. olivacea was
more susceptible to disease than S. paramamosain,
since its survival probability at 70 days post-infection
was 0 while that for S. paramamosain was 0.22. Thus,
based on previous published work for S. serrata and on

Page 11 of 12

our results, we propose that susceptibility to white spot
disease in the genus Scylla is species-dependent but may
also be dose-history dependent as seen with S. olivacea.
In practical terms for shrimp farmers, our results show
that S. olivacea and S. paramamosain may be infected
with WSSV for periods of several weeks or more and
potentially act as carriers during that interval, but that
they might pose less threat than S. serrata that is apparently unaffected by WSSV infection. For crab farmers,
our results suggest that rearing of S. serrata would be a
better choice than S. paramamosain or S. olivacea in
terms of avoiding losses from seasonal WSSV outbreaks.
