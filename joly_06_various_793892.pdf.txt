Abstract
Background: In the accompanying paper by Virginie Rouillon and myself, our demonstration that
homogenisation by gene conversion occurs readily among MHC class I genes was made possible
because of the exceptional conservation of the CD94L locus between divergent species of separate
taxa, suggesting that the molecules of this family are endowed with very important and well
preserved biological functions. These results lead me to elaborate various hypotheses on several
aspects of MHC evolution.
Hypotheses: In a first part, I propose a highly hypothetical scenario of MHC evolution that could
explain how modern day CD94L molecules can have so many diverse and well preserved biological
functions. Next, I propose that MHC class I molecules evolve more rapidly and exuberantly than
class II molecules because the former are subjected to more direct selective pressures, in particular
from viruses. Third, I suggest that concerted evolution, by increasing inter-genic homogeneity
would in turn favour further inter-allelic and inter-loci exchanges, hence resulting in a more
evolvable MHC. As a fourth and last point, I propose that the high GC content of sequences coding
for classical class I molecules could be a consequence of biased gene conversion.
Testing of these various hypotheses should occur naturally over the coming years, with the
ever increasing availability of more sequences related to MHC class I genes from various organisms.
Ultimately, a better understanding of how MHC molecules evolve may help to decipher where and
how our adaptive immune system arose, and keeps evolving in the face of the permanent challenge
of infectious organisms.

What place do modern day CD94L molecules
occupy in the history of MHC evolution?
HLA-E and/or H-2Qa1 fulfil many other roles besides that
of presenting the leader peptides of class Ia molecules to
NK cells. They present leader peptides derived from
Hsp60 heat shock proteins of self or bacterial origin [1] to
cytotoxic T cells [2]. This presentation of leader peptides

from Hsps to NK cells has also been proposed to play a
role in stress surveillance [3]. HLA-E also presents peptides derived from viruses [4] or bacteria [5] to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and to NKT cells [6], and H-2Qa1 aids the
resistance of mice to Salmonella infection by presenting
antigens to γδ T cells [7] and regulates the activity of CD8
regulatory T cells [8]. The capacity of CD94L molecules to
fulfil so many functions suggests that they have probably
been around for a very long time. Yet, despite the daily
increase in availability of additional sequences from various species, we have failed to identify clear homologues of
the modern day CD94L found in rodents and primates in
animals from other orders, including in the complete dog
genome. This would tend to suggest that an ancestral
CD94L molecule arose in a rodent-primate ancestor that
lived after the divergence of the Euarchontoglires (a clade
that includes primates and rodents) from the laurasiatheria (comprising carnivores, ongulate herbivores and
bats)[18].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/3

modern day representatives. The discovery of an invariable TCR-like molecule in sea lamprey suggests that this
type of molecule had already evolved by then [13]. The
ligand(s) of this prototypic TCR has yet to be identified,
and it will also be particularly interesting to find out if
jawless fish express CD94-like receptor molecules. For our
imagined scenario, I envisage that the ancestors of MHC
molecules started presenting hydrophobic peptides to a
TCR-like protein and to the CD94-like invariable receptors as part of an innate immune system geared at detecting stress and/or danger.

Here, I would like to present a highly hypothetical scenario of MHC evolution that could explain how the
CD94L molecules found in rodents and mammals today
are endowed with so many diverse functions. This scenario is based on the recent discovery of a molecule
related to CD94 in a urochordate, [9], which lends support to the view that some sort of NK cells (with their
receptors) existed before adaptive lymphocytes.

Lampreys have recently been shown to possess an adaptive immune system [14,15]. The variable receptors
expressed by lamprey lymphocytes are, however, not
related to TCRs or to any other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, but are based on somatic
genomic recombinations of fragments coding for leucinerich repeats. The appearance of a segmented spinal chord
apparently correlated somehow with a much-increased
need for an adaptive immune system, and the striking
dichotomy between the adaptive immune system of jawless and jawed vertebrates provides a very good example
of what I would call convergent evolution, i.e. the development of similar functions through two clearly independent evolutionary pathways. Another good example
of convergent evolution is the acquisition of flight in bats,
birds and butterflies.

Around 800 million years ago, there lived the ancestor of
urochordates (sea squirts), and cephalochordates
(Amphioxus, or lancelets, small eel-like sea-dwelling life
forms with an unsegmented backbone). In its turn, 50
million years later, the ancestor of vertebrate fish would
evolve from the ancestor of cephalochordates. In this urochordate-cephalochordate ancestor, I propose that the
ancestor of MHC molecules presented hydrophobic peptides (including leader peptides of self and non-self origin) to an ancestral CD94 receptor, with a role in stress
and/or danger detection. Consistent with this, Flajnik et
al. have previously proposed that ancestral MHC molecule(s) derived from heat shock proteins (Hsp) [10],
which have particularly high affinities for hydrophobic
peptides. Although the proposal by Flajnik et al. was
based on tenuous sequence homologies, and later elucidation of an Hsp crystal structure [11] revealed that Hsps
and MHC molecules bind to peptides in very different
fashions, this type of hypothesis remains interesting, if
only because Hsps do behave as danger signals when they
are released in the extracellular milieu, in line with a
recent hypothesis regarding the hydrophobic nature of
danger signals [12].

Jawed vertebrates appeared around 500 million years ago
and, with them, the complete adaptive immune system
that can be found in all gnathostomes from mammals to
cartilaginous fish (sharks). One of the more challenging
current enigmas for evolutionary immunogeneticists is to
understand this evolutionary leap which took place in the
ancestor of jawed vertebrates and led to an adaptive
immune system complete with recombination-activating
genes (RAG), immunoglobulins, hypervariable TCRs, and
their functional partners, the MHC class I and class II molecules [16,17]. It is interesting to note that en bloc genome
duplications apparently occurred both between protochordates and vertebrates, and also between jawless and
jawed vertebrates [16]. I envisage that, in ancestral jawed
fish, as TCRs became variable because of newly evolved
RAG genes, their ancestral function to detect danger signals could have quickly evolved towards the recognition
of ligands more diverse than hydrophobic peptides presented by proteins related to heat shock proteins. To
favour the diversification of the antigens presented, combining a hydrophobic peptide binding site to an immunoglobulin domain (the α3 domain) would have resulted
in the structure found today in MHC class I molecules.

Vertebrates arose around 750 million years ago, in the
form of jawless fish, of which lampreys and hagfishes are

duplication would then have become available to co-

evolve with certain lymphocytes' receptors, most probably
various forms of γδ TCRs. The subsequent appearance of
αβ TCRs gave rise to a further diversity of receptors,
matched by the appearance of MHC class Ia molecules,
with two levels of diversity: degenerate binding motifs,
and heterogeneity in the population.
Much later, in a rodent-primate ancestor that lived after
the divergence of the Euarchontoglires, a new function
arose in NK cells to ensure the maintenance of expression
of MHC class Ia molecules via presentation of their leader
peptides by CD94L molecules. This was achieved by virtue
of a heterodimeric receptor combining the capacity of
CD94 to detect hydrophobic peptides, and that of NKG2
molecules to bind certain MHC molecules expressed
when cellular stress levels rise [19]. This binding function
of CD94-NKG2 heterodimeric receptors to an MHC class
Ib molecule presenting the class Ia leader peptides must
represent a sufficient selective advantage to have been
conserved over the 90 million years since the rodent/primate split. Form this, I would predict that CD94L molecules are likely to be identified in lagomorphs and lemurs
since these two taxa split respectively from rodents and
from other primates after the primate-rodent separation
[18].
The elaborate process by which NK cells survey whether or
not cells express the leader peptides of MHC class Ia molecules is quite amazing from an evolutionary point of
view. The sequence of events described above explains
how this could have arisen by small incremental evolutionary steps, in true Darwinian fashion [20]. In addition,
this scenario would explain how modern day CD94L molecules come to have so many diverse functions, most of
them related to those of ancestral MHC molecules presenting hydrophobic, danger-related peptides, from
which they would be direct descendants.

Why do MHC class I molecules evolve faster
than class II ?
A general observation from comparing MHCs from different species is that the evolution of MHC class I molecules
is much more rapid and exuberant than that of their class
II counterparts. This is relatively easy to reconcile with the
concept that MHC evolution is mostly driven by pressures
imposed by infectious pathogens such as rapidly evolving
viruses. Indeed, if a mutated virus acquires that capacity to
evade or block MHC class I antigen presentation, the
progeny of that virus will have an immediate advantage
over the viruses infecting the adjacent cells. If the evasion
mechanism concerns class II presentation, however, virions arising will still carry epitopes for TCR recognition by
CTLs, and antigen presentation and local inflammation
will still be taking place because the infection with unmutated viruses will still be happening in adjacent cells. The

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/3

advantage of mutated pathogens having acquired the
means to evade class II presentation will therefore only
become effective if and when they reach new sites of infection, either in a separate host, or possibly at a separate site
of the same host. It is therefore of no surprise that the vast
majority of viral genes that can block antigen presentation
target the class I pathway [21,22]. The direct consequence
of this is that MHC class I molecules must be subjected to
very intense selective pressures, which can in turn explain
why they evolve faster than MHC class II molecules, and,
for that matter, much faster than any other genes in the
vertebrate kingdom.

Concerted evolution, genomic organisation and
evolvable MHCs
In our accompanying paper, we have shown that gene
homogenisation, through repeated events of gene conversion, can contribute significantly to the relatedness of separate MHC class I loci within species, and we have
proposed that this may favour the co-evolution of MHC
class I molecules and of other protein involved in antigen
presentation. Here, I would like to propose that, in a
roundabout kind of way, the MHC region could have
evolved to promote the evolvability of the genes within it,
by favouring frequent interallelic and intergenic gene conversion. This concept of 'evolvability' as a selectable trait
has recently been validated mathematically by Earl and
Deem [23].
The two main factors that favour the occurrence of gene
conversion between two sequences are their genomic
proximity [24], and their degree of sequence homology. If
we consider that the evolvability of MHC molecules could
represent a selective advantage at the population level, we
then see that carrying a set of genes that are prone to
undergo gene conversion with one another could provide
such an advantage to a given species. In most vertebrates,
virtually all genes coding for MHC molecules are found
within this one region defined as the MHC. The raison
d'être of this situation may be to promote the occurrence
of inter-genic gene conversion, thereby providing a set of
genes that are particularly prone to evolve under the selective pressures imposed by pathogens.
For certain MHC molecules presenting invariable antigens, however, the tendency of the loci within the MHC to
undergo frequent gene conversion with their neighbours
could be disadvantageous. For example, CD1 molecules,
which present invariable lipid antigens, are encoded outside the MHC in mammals, but within the MHC in
chicken [25,26]. This suggests that CD1 genes may have
initially been within the MHC, but that in Mammals, the
CD1 loci may have 'moved out' of the MHC so as not to
undergo concerted evolution with their MHC-encoded
counterparts. If this scenario turns out to be true, it would

Biology Direct 2006, 1:3

bring strong support to the view that concerted evolution
of sequences within the MHC contribute very actively to
the shaping of MHC molecules. There are, however, at
least two other possible scenarios to explain this difference found in the location of CD1 genes outside the MHC
in mammals and close to it in chicken. First, as suggested
by large scale analyses of whole genomic regions, the
MHC and the region carrying the CD1 loci (1q21-q25)
may have arisen via whole chromosomal duplications
[16,27]. If this were the case, the finding of the CD1 loci
within the chicken MHC suggests that those would have
later been rejoined with their classical counterparts. Yet
another possibility (suggested by Jim Kaufman) is that
both types of loci could have existed in the ancestral
MHC, but that, after duplication of the whole region, CD1
and classical MHC loci were conserved on the same chromosome in the lineage leading to chickens, but individually on the two separate chromosomes in the lineage
leading to mammals. Regarding these various hypotheses,
it will be interesting to find out if CD1 loci are also adjacent to MHC class I loci in other bird species, and to look
for signs of concerted evolution between the MHC class I
and CD1 loci in chicken and in other bird lineages.
As mentioned earlier, the occurrence of gene conversion
between two DNA sequences also depends greatly on their
degree of similarity. By ensuring the maintenance of a
high degree of sequence homology between the various
MHC loci within the region, frequent intergenic gene conversion would favour the occurrence of further conversion
events, thereby conferring a selective advantage in terms
of evolvability of MHC genes without needing a direct
selective advantage in terms of expressed proteins. This
could explain the existence and maintenance of so many
pseudogenes sequences within most mammalian MHC
regions, and the intra-locus homogenisation reported for
introns of the HLA-A locus [28]. A rapid comparison of
the HLA-E introns found them to be much more closely
related to those of HLA-A than to those of H2-Qa1 and
RT-BM1 (data not shown). This observation can be seen
as further evidence for the extensive occurrence of intergenic homogenisation within the MHC, even outside of
the coding regions.
Selection for high evolvability probably contributes significantly to the shaping of the MHC region, perhaps even
as much as pathogen-driven evolution. The maintenance
of pseudogene sequences, and of a certain homogeneity of
the coding and non-coding sequences are both factors
that would favour evolvability, and this dimension certainly adds to the complexity of MHC evolution. The overall picture we come to from the above discussion is one of
balance between homogeneity and heterogeneity among
the sequences of MHC molecules, with this balance being
tuned towards evolvability.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/3

GC content as a stigma of frequent gene
conversion events
As a last point of discussion, I would like to offer a potential explanation for the long standing observation that the
genes coding for MHC molecules have very high GC contents, especially the sequences coding for the PBR residues
of class Ia molecules [29]. According to recent reports, the
direction of gene conversion is naturally biased to favour
the maintenance of GC rich sequences. This bias has been
proposed to counter the natural tendency of cytosine residues to mutate spontaneously into thymidine [30,31].
Biased gene conversion, which explains the high GC content of the histone and rRNA genes [30,31], may also be
relevant to many other multigene families in mammals,
such as insulin-like growth factors [32], polyubiquitins
[33], early growth response proteins, EGR [34], protocadherins [35], Hsp70s [36] and olfactory receptors [37], as
well as for certain amylase genes in Drosophila [38], and
the genes of certain plant enzymes [39]. Finally, biased
gene conversion towards GC has recently been proposed
to play a role in the evolution of sex [40].
In the genes coding for MHC molecules, and particularly
those coding for class Ia molecules, the functional new
alleles resulting from events of gene conversion will be
selected for by the constant pressure of pathogens, and
this process could therefore account for their high GC
content.

Conclusion
"By selecting for ever- more-devious parasites, the immune system is the cause of its own necessity." Stephen Hedrick, 2004.
In a very nice and thought-provoking essay [41], Stephen
Hedrick thus summarised his views that our immune system is far from providing an ultimate and perfect answer
to the permanent challenge of infectious pathogens.
Rather, he pictured the adaptive immune system as a
costly and imperfect, yet indispensable, system that can
never win the race against the replicative and adaptive
powers of micro-organisms.
In the ancestral life forms that gave rise to all vertebrates,
an adaptive immune system must, however, have conferred such a significant selective advantage that nature
came up twice independently with adaptive ways to counter the capacity of infectious pathogens to evolve at striking speed. On the one hand, in the ancestor of jawless
fish, an adaptive immune system arose that was based on
variable lymphocyte receptors generated by somatic
recombination of modules coding for leucine rich repeats
[15]. On the other hand, in the ancestors to all jawed vertebrates, evolution quite rapidly gave rise to a 'canonical'
adaptive immune system, complete with rag genes, T cells,

B cells and an MHC region coding for both Class I and
class II molecules. From what has been discussed above,
we can envisage that this adaptive character of our
immune system may not only have been selected to provide individuals with adaptive responses based on
somatic mutations. Rather, in a further elaboration, the
genomic proximity of MHC genes within the MHC region
may be providing the means for a more evolvable MHC,
resulting in an adaptibility of the genes that would not be
immediately beneficial for individuals, but would be
advantageous for species, at the level of whole populations.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/3

a general mechanism clearly predating the species studied
here.
Author response: Thanks to the process of 'open refereeing',
I have been able to discuss this point with Stephan over the
phone directly. His comment sprouted from some slight misunderstanding, which has now been lifted.
The additional section (appended to main manuscript)
does not really constitute a separate manuscript but adds
further interesting points to the discussion and the key
points could be summarized and included in the main
manuscript.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Stephan Beck
In their manuscript Joly and Rouillon report new evidence
for the hypothesis that MHC class I genes undergo concerted evolution through gene conversion (e.g. nonhomologous recombination). In support, they analysed 8
classical class I genes (termed class Ia) and 8 non-classical
class I genes (termed class Ib) from primates and rodents
with focus on three class Ib genes to which they refer to as
CD94L family (human HLA-E, mouse H2-Qa1 and rat RTBM1). The results are comprehensively discussed within
the context of various relevant hypotheses, which adds a
review-like flavour and greatly enhances the appeal of the
manuscript.

Although some conclusions (and assumptions) are better
supported than others, I only take issue with one particular point. Based on evidence I do not agree with, the
authors assume the above mentioned CD94L family
genes to represent orthologues and their many respective
paralogues are not considered in subsequent analyses
which may have affected some of the conclusions.
Author response: Following this comment, and a suggestion
made by Pierre Pontarotti on the phone, I have now modified
the manuscript to remove the statement about 'the clear orthologous relationship of CD94L molecules within the primate or
the rodent orders'. This is now replaced by 'There is very little
room for doubt that all four primate CD94L genes descend
from a common ancestral gene, and similarly for all four rodent
CD94L genes'.
On page 12, for instance, the authors conclude that at
least the alpha 3 domains of the CD94L genes have all
undergone intra-species concerted evolution with their
respective class Ia molecules but not one of the 22 informative positions is shared across species as one would
expect for orthologues. The logic conclusion would have
to be that gene conversion did not occur in the ancestral
(e.g. pre 80 mya) CD94L genes studied here. This is
unlikely, as gene conversion has been demonstrated to be

Author response: The solution to this has been to remove a
sizeable portion of the discussion and to provide it as a clearly
separate manuscript.
The paper itself now focuses on the demonstration that HLA-E
and Qa1 are orthologues. It is now much shorter, easier to read,
and the message is, I hope, much clearer.
The accompanying paper is now clearly labelled as 'hypothesis',
and I have used it to regroup 4 topics of discussion touching on
different aspects of MHC evolution that derive from the results
obtained in the paper itself, but are not directly related to these
results.
Reviewer's report 2
Lutz Walter
In this paper, Joly and Rouillon compare major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes derived from
human, non-human primates, and rodents. Based on
multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree
reconstructions, the authors conclude that the MHC class
I genes in these species are subject to concerted evolution
by means of gene conversion.

One main point of criticism refers to the fact that not all
known MHC class I genes of the species studied here are
compared, and only a small extract from the full repertoire of class I genes was chosen for comparison. This may
bias the interpretation of data. In this respect, it might be
useful to concentrate on one or two species, e.g. the 'class
I-rich species, mouse, rat, or rhesus monkey. In its current
form, the paper contains data from a single mouse haplotype, but from several rat haplotypes. Thus, the data set
should also be updated to allow the study of both interand intralocus gene conversion.
Author response: One of the main challenges we faced when
we started to do the work that would allow us to write this paper
was not in terms of "How many sequences for MHC class I molecules can we collect and align ?". It was, in fact, exactly the
reverse, i.e. :" With how few sequences can we proceed to dem-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:3

onstrate, beyond reasonable doubt, that MHC class I loci do
undergo concerted evolution ?" All the figures presented in the
paper were obtained from the one alignment we settled for in
the end. Changing just one sequence in the list would require
performing the whole study all over again, which would represent several weeks of tenuous work.
Although our observations lead us to discuss many aspects
related to MHC evolution, evaluating the frequency of inter
and intra-locus conversion events was not within the remit of
this study. Regarding the choice of MHC sequences from several rat MHC haplotypes, and from a single mouse haplotype,
we do not see why this should have any relevance to the type of
work we have done, and to the conclusions we reach. Outside
of particular situation where genes can co-evolve because they
are closely linked (such as RT1-A and TAP), MHC haplotypes
are, after all, relatively artificial sets of genes that happened to
find themselves on the same chromosomal strand when inbred
strains were generated.
Starting with many more sequences, we would have faced the
following problems:
1) The alignment showed on Figure 1, which was used to generate the trees, could not have been provided within the manuscript. We also find that the clarity of figures containing trees
degrades rapidly when these trees have too many branches.
2) The computer time required for calculation of the trees and
of the ds/dn values grows exponentially with the number of
sequences, and the time spent generating the alignments and
the figures is also dependent on the number of sequences
included.
3) For the precise question we wanted to address, the only class
Ib loci that were informative were those identified in at least
two species. We also felt that it was best to restrict our analysis
to those molecules for which a function had clearly been documented, and which had the same number of amino-acids as
class Ia sequences (to avoid gaps in the alignment). When we
embarked on this work, the only class Ib loci fulfilling these criteria were the CD94L and the murine M3 molecules. As far as
we know, this is still true today.
page 16: the sister grouping of M3 and CD94L genes is
due to a limited data set (see above) and does not reflect
true phylogenetic relationship (and is not supported by
bootstrapping). Furthermore, it contradicts data by Hurt
et al. (2004) who studied the phylogenetic relationship of
all rat and mouse class I genes;
Author response: We are in complete agreement with the
statement that the grouping of M3 and CD94L does not necessarily reflect phylogenetic relationship, and this despite a bootstrapping value of 63% (with the methods used for these

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/3

comparisons, values above 60% are usually considered significant, and this is specified several times in the paper). Two alternative interpretations relating to this were (and still are)
proposed in the manuscript. We actually pointed to this feature
of the tree to underline our point of view that extreme caution
must be exerted when carrying out phylogenetic analyses of
members of multigene families that undergo extensive intergenic exchanges.
page 16 and more: it is not obvious why the authors introduce a new abbreviation for 'residues outside the antigen
recognition site (ROARS)' and do not use the widely
accepted 'non-PBR';
Author response: We chose to use ROARS because we think
it sounds better than 'non-PBR', and also because not all class
I molecules present peptides.
page 17, second paragraph: the authors should explain
how homogenisation can be afforded in non-PBRs, particularly at those sites where PBRs and non-PBRs alternate. Is
the degree of homology between the two sequences high
enough to allow gene conversion to take place?
Author response: What we witness here are signs that are
very evocative of intra-species homogenisation, and gene conversion seems to be the most likely mechanism to explain this.
We have no way of knowing when these events took place, and
between what sequences (for example, some other genes, or
pseudogenes, could have served as relay between certain
sequences). Furthermore, although gene conversion is clearly
favoured between homologous sequences, we are not aware of
data documenting the minimal length of homologous sequences
required for gene conversion to take place. Outside of the fact
that this question seems to be way beyond the scope of our study,
we therefore would have no way of addressing this question.
I would not recommend adding of the additional section
into the manuscript, as the manuscript might become
'unreadable'. However, certain aspects of this "additional"
discussion section might be included in the manuscript.
Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend considerable
shortening of the manuscript.
In my opinion, this paper should be published, but
should be regarded as a 'hypothesis paper' as it contains
many assumptions, which were not proven by experimental evidence, and it contains many review-like sections.
Author response: As explained above, we have managed to
comply to these slightly contradictory recommendations (i.e.
including more points but shortening overall) by splitting the
paper in two: One 'real' paper with the results, and one hypothesis paper.

Reviewer's report 3
Pierre Pontarotti
This article hypothesizes that the Peptide Binding Region
of the mouse, rat and human Class I b, that presents the
leader peptide from the Class I a molecules to natural
killer cells, evolved from a common ancestor while the
non PBR part evolved via gene conversion.

Author response: This was indeed confusing, and I have tried
to clarify this point by writing the following sentence:

The arguments are based upon phylogenic analysis and
upon the conserved location of these MHC class I b genes.

Acknowledgements

This contrasts with another hypothesis: the MHC class I
genes are lineage specific, they come from a common
ancestor which is different in the human and mouse lineage, (in other word class I gene from mouse and human
are paralogues), and HLA E and H2Qa1 PBR evolved via
convergent evolution...
In order to strengthen their hypothesis the authors should
screen other mammalian lineages using ensembl data
bases since some sequences of ensembl data base are not
obligatory present in NCBI NR, especially those from
canis, loxodanta, bos Taurus, canis Familirais and monodelphis (even if this species is out side of the eutherian
group). If an "HLAE like" PBR orthologue is found in all
these groups, the author hypothesis will be stronger supported.

"The fact that the comparison of primate sequences strongly
suggests that the four CD94L are orthologues, whereas this is
much less clear for the corresponding class Ia sequences confirms previous reports that primate

Author response: We would indeed have been very interested
to identify MHC class I molecules with CD94L-like PBR outside of the rodent and primate genera. As was already indicated
in the result section entitled "Certain residues are CD94L-specific, and others are homogenised within species" (on page 10
of the current manuscript), we have repeatedly tried to identify
such molecules via several approaches in all the online databases available to us, and, as of 20 Dec 2005, we have not succeeded so far.
Second if the conversion of the non PBR HLA E like gene
is an ongoing process, this could be seen at higher taxonomic level, for example at primate level by comparing
human chimp and macaque MHC class I genes: more
homogenization should be seen outside the "HLA E like"
PBR than within the PBR.
Author response: This is indeed exactly what we see, and this
is discussed on page 18 of the manuscript (Comparison of this
tree...... low support values).

Other comments:
Concerning the sentence page 14 L 11: Among the classI B
...years ago. I do not understand why the results confirm
that CD94L molecules are much more evolutionary conserved than Class I a molecules.
