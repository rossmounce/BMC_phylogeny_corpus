Transcriptional profiling of root-knot nematode
induced feeding sites in cowpea
(Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) using a
soybean genome array
Sayan Das1,2, Jeffrey D Ehlers1, Timothy J Close1, Philip A Roberts2*

Abstract
Background: The locus Rk confers resistance against several species of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.,
RKN) in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Based on histological and reactive oxygen species (ROS) profiles, Rk confers a
delayed but strong resistance mechanism without a hypersensitive reaction-mediated cell death process, which
allows nematode development but blocks reproduction.
Results: Responses to M. incognita infection in roots of resistant genotype CB46 and a susceptible near-isogenic
line (null-Rk) were investigated using a soybean Affymetrix GeneChip expression array at 3 and 9 days postinoculation (dpi). At 9 dpi 552 genes were differentially expressed in incompatible interactions (infected resistant
tissue compared with non-infected resistant tissue) and 1,060 genes were differentially expressed in compatible
interactions (infected susceptible tissue compared with non-infected susceptible tissue). At 3 dpi the differentially
expressed genes were 746 for the incompatible and 623 for the compatible interactions. When expression
between infected resistant and susceptible genotypes was compared, 638 and 197 genes were differentially
expressed at 9 and 3 dpi, respectively.
Conclusions: In comparing the differentially expressed genes in response to nematode infection, a greater number
and proportion of genes were down-regulated in the resistant than in the susceptible genotype, whereas more
genes were up-regulated in the susceptible than in the resistant genotype. Gene ontology based functional
categorization revealed that the typical defense response was partially suppressed in resistant roots, even at 9 dpi,
allowing nematode juvenile development. Differences in ROS concentrations, induction of toxins and other defense
related genes seem to play a role in this unique resistance mechanism.

Background
Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is grown extensively as a food and fodder crop in West Africa, lower
elevation areas of eastern and southern Africa, northeastern Brazil, parts of the Middle East, India, and the
south-eastern and south-western regions of North
America [1]. In West Africa cowpea is mainly cultivated
as a rainfed crop from April to November depending on
the location. Cowpea (2N = 2X = 22) has a genome size
of ~600 Mbp [2].

Root-knot nematodes (RKN, Meloidogyne spp.) are
sedentary endoparasites with a wide host range and one
of the world’s most damaging crop pests [3]. RKN feeding in plant roots leads to development of specialized
feeding structures in the vascular parenchyma called
“giant cells”. The infective stage of this nematode is the
second stage-juvenile (J2). J2 penetrate the roots and go
through three successive molts to become adult females.
Some economically important RKN species, including
M. incognita, reproduce by obligate mitotic parthenogenesis, while many other RKN species reproduce sexually [4].
In cowpea RKN is an important pest worldwide and
host plant resistance has been a preferred strategy along

with cultural practices to control the nematode population in infested cowpea fields [5,6]. The Rk locus in
cowpea has been used extensively to breed root-knot
nematode resistant varieties in the USA and other countries. This locus was first designated as Rk by Fery and
Dukes [7] and it confers resistance to many populations
of M. incognita, M. arenaria, M. hapla and M. javanica.
The Rk-mediated resistance in cowpea has been characterized histologically by Das et al. [8]. An important
finding from that study was that the resistance response
was much delayed during the incompatible interaction
and there was an absence of typical hypersensitive reaction (HR) mediated cell death in the resistant roots
upon nematode infection. This is in contrast to several
other plant-RKN systems studied so far which do have a
typical HR. For example, Mi-1 mediated resistance in
tomato triggers a rapid HR as early as 24 hours postinfection [9], and both Me3-mediated resistance in pepper [10] and incompatible interactions in soybean [11]
show strong early HR.
Whole genome microarrays provide a means to scan
for genes involved in particular biological processes on a
global scale. Unfortunately cowpea does not yet have a
commercially available microarray platform. It was
shown previously that the commercially available soybean GeneChip from Affymetrix can be used effectively
in cowpea to identify single feature polymorphisms
(SFPs) [12]. In that study, cowpea RNA was used as a
surrogate for DNA to identify SFPs, which established
the utility of the soybean genome array as a satisfactory
platform for use in examining cowpea transcripts. In the
current study the same soybean platform was used to
study the global resistant and susceptible cowpea
responses to nematode infection of roots.
There have been several microarray studies of the
nematode infection process in plants in last few years.
The RKN-plant compatible interactions have been studied using microarrays by several groups in Arabidopsis
[13,14] and tomato [15,16]. Global gene expression
levels also have been studied during the infection process of another important plant parasitic nematode, soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) [17-22].
However, few studies have examined incompatible
plant-nematode interactions in resistant plants
[16,23,24].
In this study the transcriptome profile of both incompatible and compatible cowpea-RKN interactions for
two time points was investigated using the Affymetrix
soybean GeneChip. This is the first study of this kind in
the cowpea-RKN interaction. It provides a broad insight
into the Rk-mediated resistance in cowpea and creates
an excellent dataset of potential candidate genes
involved in both nematode resistance and parasitism,

which can be tested further for their role in this biological process using functional genomics approaches.

Results
Heterologous microarray platform

In order to elucidate the plant response to root-knot
nematodes, infected resistant CB46 (incompatible interaction) was compared with non-infected CB46, and
infected susceptible null-Rk (compatible interaction) was
compared with non-infected null-Rk. Two time points
were chosen for this analysis i.e., 3 and 9 dpi. Nine dpi
was selected as a critical time point because sequentially
assayed histological sections during 21 days of infection
revealed that at 9 dpi the first subtle differences
appeared between incompatible and compatible interactions [8]. The 3-dpi samples provided a time point prior
to visible differences histologically, between incompatible and compatible interactions.
The average number of soybean probe sets which had
“present” call in 9-dpi samples was 10,521, which comprised 28% of the total number of soybean probe sets
on the soybean GeneChip. Similarly, the average number
of “present” calls in 3-dpi samples was 10,685 (~28.5%
of all soybean probe sets). When soybean RNA was
used to hybridize the soybean GeneChip, the “present”
call percentage ranged from 70-75% [25]. Therefore
about 40% (28/70) of the content of the soybean GeneChip is informative for cowpea.
Data quality

Principal component analysis (PCA) was done on triplicate data for each treatment at 9 dpi in order to visualize the overall genome response to nematode infection
in resistant and susceptible cowpea genotypes. PCA on
conditions (treatments) for the 9-dpi sample are shown
in Fig. 1. PCA component 1 (40.32% of total variance)
and PCA component 2 (33.62% of total variance) comprised the majority of the described variance (73.94%).
The PCA showed a clear separation between the two
genotypes when infected with nematodes whereas the
two genotypes clustered together when there was no
external stimulus (non-infected control). Because we
used cowpea near-isogenic lines for this analysis, clustering of the non-infected control samples was expected.
This confirmed the robustness of the experimental
design. The PCA plot for 3-dpi samples is presented in
additional file 1.
Because there were only two biological replicates for
the 3-dpi samples, a correlation analysis was performed
between the two replicates of each treatment. A representative MA-scatter plot is shown in Fig. 2. Correlation
coefficients between replicates ranged from 0.932 to
0.973 at a p value cut-off of 0.05, showing the

robustness of the data (correlation coefficients greater
than 0.9 are considered to be high [25]).
Gene expression in incompatible and compatible
interactions in 9-dpi root samples

At 9 dpi three different comparisons were made. In the
first comparison gene expression in the resistant CB46
roots infected with root-knot nematodes (incompatible
interaction) was compared with non-infected CB46. Secondly, a comparison in gene expression was made
between the infected null-Rk (compatible interaction)
and non-infected null-Rk. Finally, a comparison of gene
expression was made between the infected Rk and
infected null-Rk near-isogenic lines. The final comparison was important because the near-isogenic lines were
predicted to show differential gene expression for the
genes which are critical for nematode resistance or
nematode parasitism.
In the incompatible interaction 552 (~5.3% of total
expressed probe sets) genes were significantly

differentially expressed between the Rk-infected and
non-infected treatments based on the statistical test (see
materials and methods). These genes were then passed
through a 1.5 fold-change filter. The geometric mean of
the normalized expression intensities of all samples
under one condition were used to calculate the foldchange ratios. If the ratio of geometric means of the
infected sample and the non-infected control for a
probe set was ≥ 1.5, then that particular probe set was
categorized as 1.5-fold or more up-regulated and if the
ratio was ≤ 0.67 then the probe set was categorized as
down-regulated by 1.5-fold or more. 141 genes showed
1.5-fold or more up-regulation and 59 genes were
down-regulated by 1.5-fold or more in the Rk-infected
compared with the Rk-non-infected treatment (Fig. 3a
and 3b). In the compatible interaction 1,060 genes
passed the statistical filter (~10% of total expressed
probe sets). Among these 1,060 genes 218 were 1.5-fold
or more up-regulated and 41 genes were 1.5-fold or
more down-regulated in the infected null-Rk compared

to the non-infected null-Rk treatment (Fig. 3a and 3b).
In this context it can be noted that in the current study
the number of differentially expressed genes is lower
than some of the other microarray studies previously
published in the field of plant-microbe interactions. One
of the reasons may be due to the use of a heterologous
GeneChip. Nevertheless, the information generated will

be very valuable as this is the first report on the cowpea
root-knot nematode interaction. In the final comparison
between the two near-isogenic lines infected with Rkavirulent root-knot nematodes, 638 genes (~6% of total
expressed probe sets) passed the statistical filter. Among
the differentially expressed genes only 20 genes were
1.5-fold or more up-regulated in the infected Rk than in

the infected null-Rk treatment and 100 genes were 1.5fold or more down-regulated in the infected Rk than in
the infected null-Rk treatment.
Selected genes from all three above comparisons are
presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3 with their fold-change
ratios and Medicago truncatula annotations. The genes
were selected based on their fold-change level assuming
that the genes with highest fold-change ratio will be
likely to have a biological role in the plant-nematode
interaction. Lists of all genes passing the 1.5-fold filter
are provided in additional files 2, 3 and 4.
A gene ontology based analysis was carried out to categorize the differentially expressed genes into different
functional classes. In the incompatible interaction the
most abundant functional class observed for the upregulated probe sets (Fig. 4a) was genes involved in
metabolism (32.8%), followed by proteins with binding
function (28.8%) and genes involved in cell rescue and
defense (13.7%). In the compatible interaction the most
abundant functional classes in up-regulated probe sets
(Fig. 4a) were metabolism (30.6%), proteins with binding
function (26.9%), and genes involved in protein fate
(13.2%). For down-regulated probe sets the most abundant functional classes in the incompatible interaction
(Fig. 4b) were proteins with binding function (39.2%),
metabolism (21.5%), and interaction with the environment (15.6%), whereas in the compatible interaction the
most abundant classes (Fig. 4b) were proteins with binding function (23.6%), cellular transport (18.4%), and systemic interaction with the environment (13.1%). A
significant number of probe sets were also categorized

under unclassified or unknown proteins in all the above
comparisons.
Genes differentially expressed between the two
infected NILs were also functionally classified (Fig. 5). In
the probe sets up-regulated in infected resistant CB46
over infected susceptible null-Rk, the most abundant
classes were cellular transport (36.8%), proteins with
binding function (21%), and proteins involved in transcription (15.7%). Among the probe sets which were
down-regulated in the resistant genotype over the susceptible genotype, the most abundant functional classes
were metabolism (35.1%), proteins with binding function
(24.1%), and systemic interaction with the environment
(10.9%).
Gene expression in incompatible and compatible
interactions in 3-dpi root samples

Similar to the 9-dpi samples, three different comparisons were made for 3-dpi root samples. In the first comparison gene expression in the resistant Rk plants
(incompatible interaction) infected with root-knot nematodes was compared with non-infected Rk plants. A
comparison in gene expression also was made between
the infected null-Rk (compatible interaction) and noninfected null-Rk. Finally, a comparison of gene expression was made between the infected Rk and infected
null-Rk near-isogenic lines.
In the incompatible interaction 746 (~6.9% of total
expressed probe sets) genes were significantly differentially expressed based on the statistical test. These genes
were then passed through a fold-change filter based on

the compatible interaction 623 genes passed the statistical filter (~5.8% of total expressed probe sets). Among
these 623 genes 81 were 1.5-fold or more up-regulated
and 148 genes were 1.5-fold or more down-regulated in

with Rk-avirulent root-knot nematodes, 197 genes
(~1.8% of total expressed probe sets) passed the statistical filter. Among the differentially expressed genes only
4 genes were 1.5-fold or more up-regulated in the resistant CB46 compared to susceptible null-Rk, and 10
genes were 1.5-fold or more down-regulated in the

Discussion
Recently a number of interspecies comparisons of gene
expression have been carried out including human versus monkeys [26,27], between rodents [28], human versus mouse [29], within Xenopus [30], and within
Drosophila [31]. Cross-species analysis of gene expression in non-model mammals was reported by NietoDíaz et al. [32]. The reproducibility of probe data
obtained from hybridizing deer, Old-World primates,
and human RNA samples to the Affymetrix human
GeneChip® U133 Plus 2.0 was also compared. The studies showed that cross-species hybridization affected
neither the distribution of the hybridization reproducibility among different categories nor the reproducibility values of the individual probes. In plants, the use of
heterologous platforms for transcriptome profiling also
is becoming more popular. Recently the Affymetrix
Arabidopsis GeneChip was used to analyze gene
expression during seed germination in Brassica [33].
The Affymetrix tomato GeneChip was used to survey
the early events associated with the potato tuber cold
sweetening [34]. The usefulness of the soybean genome
array to study cowpea was shown when the Affymetrix
soybean GeneChip was used successfully to identify

and validate single feature polymorphisms in cowpea
[12].
Several microarray studies have been conducted to
elucidate the molecular mechanism of the root-knot
nematode infection process. Bar-Or et al. [15] reported
a transcriptome profile of the compatible interaction in
susceptible tomato roots infected with root-knot nematodes. Jammes et al. [13] and Fuller et al. [14] have
done similar studies in Arabidopsis infected with rootknot nematodes. Several GeneChip microarray studies
have also been made recently to investigate the infection
process by soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines
[17,22,20,21].
Microarray studies available so far in the area of plantnematode interactions mostly examined the compatible
or susceptible interaction. There is a dearth of information available for the incompatible plant-root-knot
nematode interaction. Very recently Bhattarai et al. [16]
reported the expression profile of Mi-1-mediated incompatible interaction in tomato roots infected with rootknot nematodes. They reported the gene expression profile for only one time point, as early as 24 hours-post
inoculation. Incompatible interactions have been monitored for soybean cyst nematode by Klink et al. [23,24]
for two time points. In our study both compatible and
incompatible interactions were studied using the soybean genome array. This is the first insight into the
cowpea-root-knot interaction at the transcriptome level.

It has already been shown in related work that Rkmediated resistance in cowpea is characterized by a very
delayed but strong and effective resistance response [8].
For this study the 9-dpi time point was critical
because histologically there are some subtle observable
differences between compatible and incompatible interaction at 9 dpi. Though the nematodes were able to
maintain normal giant cells in resistant roots at 9 dpi,
more vacuolation was evident for the first time in those
giant cells when compared to the giant cells in the susceptible roots at the same stage [8]. Among the highly
up-regulated genes in the incompatible interaction at 9
dpi was an alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Adh genes are
widely known to respond to different biotic stimuli like
fungal elicitors [35] and cyst nematodes [20]. This
response leads to heavy lignification of cell walls and
creates a mechanical barrier for the pathogen. In rice
the sequence of 340 kb surrounding the two Adh gene
loci Adh1 and Adh2 revealed the presence of 33 putative
genes, several of them being resistance gene analogues
[36]. Also, among highly up-regulated genes there was a
serine threonine protein phosphatase which is known to
play a role in negative regulation of defense response in
Arabidopsis [37]. Also several plant lectins were highly
up-regulated in the incompatible interaction at 9 dpi.
Plant lectins are carbohydrate binding proteins which
are reported to be toxic to several plant pathogens [38].
These findings are consistent with the indications made
by Das et al. [8] that the vacuoles of giant cells in the

resistant genotype might be loaded with certain toxins
which leads to developmental and reproductive arrest of
the female nematode. Among the down-regulated genes
in the incompatible interaction was a superoxide dismutase which generates super oxides [39]. Down-regulation
of this gene in the plant prevents reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death which is combined with up-regulation of peroxidases (involved in breakdown of H2O2)
in both incompatible and compatible interactions. These
results are consistent with the absence of hypersensitive
response (HR)-mediated cell death in the Rk-RKN
incompatible interaction in cowpea [8]. In the incompatible interaction an expansin was highly down-regulated,
and expansins are found to be important for maintaining the specialized feeding structures in hosts by plant
parasitic nematodes [23,24]. These findings may indicate
that though there is a visible effect of resistance at 9 dpi
as indicated by increased vacuolation, the plant is able
to generate some defense response against the nematode
feeding but the nematode is able to partially suppress
the plant defense at this time and continue feeding and
development.
When the response of the two near-isogenic lines
infected with nematodes was compared at 9 dpi, it was
especially noteworthy that a greater number of genes
were suppressed in the resistant genotype than were
induced or up-regulated compared to the susceptible
genotype. This observation is novel because typically in
such comparisons more genes are up-regulated than

Das et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:480
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/480

down-regulated in infected resistant plants compared to
infected susceptible plants. For example, more genes
were induced in the resistant genotype when near-isogenic lines were compared in sugarcane mosaic virus
infected maize plants [40] and in wheat plants infected
with leaf rust fungus [41]. A plausible explanation for
this observation in line with the delayed resistance
response is that the defense machinery in the resistant
cowpea plant is still suppressed to a large extent and as
a result the feeding nematodes are able to maintain
functional giant cells even at the 9-dpi stage.
At 3 dpi in both compatible and incompatible interactions, more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated. Jammes et al. [13] also reported that there were a
significant number of genes down-regulated during
giant cell formation in Arabidopsis roots, indicating that
these suppressed genes might be important negative regulators of nematode parasitism. Though in both incompatible and compatible interactions at 3 dpi there are
many induced genes involved in basal defense, only a
few genes were common in both interactions. This indicates that despite the similar nature of the infection process in both compatible and incompatible interactions,
these two responses have their own molecular signature,
unlike Mi-1 mediated resistance to RKN in tomato in
which many genes are shared between the incompatible
and compatible interactions [16]. When expression patterns from both time points were compared we found
that there were very few genes which were differentially
expressed in both the 3-dpi and 9-dpi samples. The
subtle variation in expression of these genes across time
points might play a significant role in this biological
pathway. For example, an expansin 45 family member
(GmaAffx.81362.1.S1_at) was differentially expressed in
both 3- and 9-dpi incompatible interactions. At both
time points this particular gene was suppressed but the
level of suppression was more in the 3-dpi sample when
compared to the 9-dpi sample. It is already established
that expansin plays a role in feeding site maintenance in
both cyst nematode induced syncytia [23,24] and rootknot nematode induced giant cells [16]. Several expansins were found to be up-regulated in syncitia developed
by sugarbeet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii in Arabidopsis [42]. These subtle variances in gene expression
levels might lead to the manifestation of the defense
response, and represent areas warranting further investigation through functional analysis.

Conclusions
In conclusion the results of this study have shown that
the typical defense response is still partially suppressed
at 9 dpi in resistant cowpea roots. There is an indication
that subtle variation of ROS concentration, induction of
toxins and other defense related genes play a role in this

Page 12 of 16

unique resistance mechanism. It is clear from this study
that nematodes are able to keep plant defense responses
under considerable control until a high amount of toxins accumulate in the vacuoles which might have
resulted from switching on of the plant defense machinery. One of the possible strategies applied by the nematode might be to control the ROS scavenging
mechanism in the plants to avoid localised cell death. In
Mi-1-mediated defense response the nematode is unable
to regulate the ROS scavenging and as a result a rapid
hypersensitive reaction is triggered upon nematode
infection. Further functional analysis of these differentially expressed genes will help us to understand this
intriguing plant-nematode interaction in a more precise
manner.

Methods
Plant material

Two near-isogenic lines (NIL) differing in presence or
absence of gene Rk were used. The two parents used to
develop the NIL were M. incognita race 3 resistant cowpea genotype ‘CB46’ (homozygous resistant, RkRk) and a
highly susceptible genotype ‘Chinese Red’ (homozygous
susceptible, rkrk). The F1 was backcrossed to recurrent
parent CB46 (BC 1 ), homozygous Rk plants were discarded in BC1F2, and non-segregating rkrk plants were
advanced to the next back-cross (BC2). Repeated backcrossing and selection was used to recover the rkrk line
in the CB46 background. BC6F4 progenies were used for
all the experiments described here. The rkrk line is
referred to as the null-Rk line from here on.
Nematode inoculum

Eggs of M. incognita race 3 (isolate Beltran) cultured on
susceptible tomato host plants were extracted from
roots using 10% bleach solution [43]. This isolate is
avirulent to gene Rk in CB46. Eggs were hatched in an
incubator at 28°C and J2 were collected in fresh deionized water. The J2 inoculum was prepared according
to the experimental requirements.
Root infections for microarray analysis

Seeds of CB46 and null-Rk cowpea lines were surfacesterilized using 10% (v/v) bleach solution and planted
singly in seedling growth pouches. Plants were grown
under controlled environmental conditions of 26.7°C ±
0.5°C constant temperature and daily light/dark cycles
of 16/8 hours. This temperature was used because it lies
within the optimum temperature range of 26 - 28°C for
development and reproduction of M. incognita on cowpea in growth pouches [44]. Each of 100 pouches (50
pouches for each genotype) was inoculated with 3000 J2
in 5 ml of deionized water 12 days after planting (dap).
This inoculum level was found to be optimum in a

Das et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:480
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/480

previous study (Das and Roberts, unpublished data) and
it generated uniform infection throughout the root system. As a result the amount of infected tissue was maximized. An equal number of pouches were mockinoculated with 5 ml of deionized water to use as noninfected controls. Infected and non-infected plants were
arranged in a completely randomized design. Nematode
infected root tissue was excised using a sterile scalpel at
3 days post-inoculation (dpi) and 9 dpi, respectively,
under a magnifying glass and flash frozen immediately
in liquid nitrogen. In previous studies (Das and Roberts,
unpublished) the infected root regions showed swelling
at 3 dpi which is indicative of initiation of giant cell formation, and at 9 dpi prominent galling was visible on
infected roots. The infected tissue was collected based
on these visual indicators. For each biological replicate
infected tissue was collected from 7 plants picked randomly and pooled together. This was done in order to
obtain enough biological material for RNA isolation.
Similarly root tissue was collected from equivalent root
regions of the control plants (tissue near root tips of
secondary and tertiary roots) and flash frozen. Galled
tissue was excised by cutting immediately adjacent to
the root-gall in order to minimize the amount of noninfected tissue included in the assays. The harvested tissue was stored at -80°C until RNA isolation. A few
infected root pieces were stained in acid fuchsin [45] to
confirm the nematode infection.
RNA isolation

RNA from nematode infected and non-infected root tissue was isolated using RNeasy plant mini kit (QIAGEN
Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. One volume of Plant RNA Isolation Aid
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) per unit mass of frozen tissue (ml/g) was added before the tissue homogenization
step for removal of common contaminants such as polysaccharides and polyphenolics. RNA was treated with
RNase-Free DNase set (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA,
USA) to digest any genomic DNA which might be present. RNA was quantified using a UV-spectrophotometer.
RNA quality and integrity was examined using RNA LabOn-A-Chip (Caliper Technologies Corp., Mountain
View, CA, USA) evaluated on an Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Soybean genome array

Phylogenetic relationships based on the conserved
sequences within Papilionoideae legumes imply that
Vigna (cowpea) is closely related to soybean [46]. Since
a commercial cowpea genome array was not available, a
soybean genome array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA,
USA) was used for transcriptome profiling in cowpea.
The soybean genome array contains 37,500 probe sets

Page 13 of 16

derived from soybean (Glycine max L.) unigenes. This
represents 61% of the total probe sets on the chip, with
the remainder targeting two pathogens important for
soybean research, of which 15,800 (26%) probe sets target Phytophthora sojae (a water mold) and 7,500 (12%)
probe sets target Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst
nematode). This array uses probe sets composed of 11
probe pairs to measure the expression of each gene.
Each probe pair consists of a perfect match (PM) probe
and a mismatch (MM) probe (see also http://www.affymetrix.com/products_services/arrays/specific/soybean.
affx).
Array hybridization

Double-stranded complementary deoxyribonucleic acid
(cDNA) was synthesized using SuperScript DoubleStranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) and T7-oligo
(dT) promoter primers. The IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix)
was then used to synthesize biotin-labeled complementary
RNA (cRNA) from template cDNA by in vitro transcription. Twelve to 16 μg labeled cRNA was fragmented by
metal-induced hydrolysis to 35-200 base fragments following Affymetrix protocols. 10 μg labeled, fragmented cRNA
was then hybridized at 45°C with rotation for 16 h in an
Affymetrix microarray Hybridization Oven 320 on Affymetrix soybean genome arrays. The arrays were washed
and stained using streptavidin phycoerythrin on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. The arrays were scanned on a
Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner. cRNA synthesis and
array hybridizations were performed in the Genomics
Core Facility http://www.genomics.ucr.edu at the University of California, Riverside.
Data analysis

For 9-dpi samples three biological replicates were used
for each of the four treatments (Rk infected and noninfected, and Rk-null infected and non-infected), requiring 12 soybean GeneChips. For the 3-dpi samples two
biological replicates were used for each treatment
requiring 8 GeneChips. The data from all 20 chips (CEL
and CHP files) are publicly available in Gene Expression
Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, platform
GPL 4592, series GS13631). Expression signals were first
analyzed in GeneChip operating software 1.3 (GCOS,
Affymetrix Inc.) to determine the “present” probe set
list. To detect “present” calls using GCOS software we
used all the probe pairs in the probe set as “stat pairs”.
The definition of the term “stat pairs” is the number of
probe pairs per probe set used in the analysis. During
data analysis a specified subset of probe pairs can be
selected by a probe mask file, but if the default settings
are used no probe mask file will be applied and all the
probe pairs will be used as “stat pairs” (11 probe pairs
in the case of the soybean GeneChip). The detection

Das et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:480
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/480

algorithm uses probe pair intensities to generate a
detection p-value and assign a “present”, “marginal”, or
“absent” call. Each probe pair in a probe set has a
potential vote in determining whether the measured
transcript is or is not “present”. The vote is described by
the discrimination score (R), which is calculated for
each probe pair and compared to a predefined threshold, Tau. Probe pairs with R higher than Tau vote “present” and the voting result is summarized as a p-value.
The greater the number of discrimination scores (R)
that are above Tau, the smaller the p-value and the
more likely the given transcript is truly present in the
sample. Only probe sets with a “present” call in all three
replicates of at least one treatment were considered to
be “expressed”.
Data normalization and further analysis was carried
out in GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). Robust Multiarray Average (RMA,
[47,48]) normalization was performed. Each chip was
normalized to the 50th percentile and each gene was
normalized to the median. As we were only interested
in plant response to nematode infection, all the probe
set data from P. sojae and H. glycines were excluded
from any further analysis.
Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to
reduce multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions
for summarizing the most important part of the data
while simultaneously filtering out the background errors.
PCA involves the calculation of the eigenvalue decomposition of a data covariance matrix or singular value
decomposition of a data matrix, usually after mean centering the data for each attribute. The results of PCA
are usually discussed in terms of component scores and
loadings [49]. PCA on conditions (treatments) based on
all genes which were present in at least one chip in the
9-dpi and 3-dpi samples were carried out to visualize
the overall genome response to nematode infection in
the resistant and susceptible cowpea genotypes.
For the 3-dpi samples, with only two biological replicates available, a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for normalized values of all probe sets between
the two replicates of each treatment to determine the
robustness of the data. This analysis was carried out in
dChip software [50].
Differentially expressed genes were identified using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a p-value
cut-off of 0.05. A multiple testing correction was performed using the Bonferroni error correction model
[51]. False discovery rate (FDR) was set at 5.0%. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes were filtered for
1.5-fold change in expression level between the control
and nematode infected treatment for both genotypes
and also between the nematode infected treatments of
the resistant and susceptible genotypes.

Validation of the use of Affymetrix soybean genome
array for cowpea transcriptional profiling

In our recent related work [12] the Affymetrix soybean
genome array was used successfully to identify single
feature polymorphisms in cowpea and the statistical
data were validated using PCR amplicon sequencing.
Thus, we were able to correctly identify polymorphisms
between two cowpea genotypes at a resolution as high
as the single nucleotide level. Also, we conducted a
small analysis to look at the sequence homology
between sequence information files (SIF) of 30 probe
sets selected to carry out PCR validation of predicted
SFPs and their corresponding cowpea sequences. The
homology ranged from 87% to as high as 94.5%. Though
this analysis is not exhaustive, it provided a good indication that the homology between cowpea and soybean
genomes is quite high at least in the SIF regions from
where the probe sets were designed. For this work RNA
was used as surrogate for genomic DNA. These data
established that the soybean probe sets faithfully measure cowpea transcripts, validating the general reliability
of the soybean-based platform for cowpea.
Annotations and functional classification of genes

The soybean genome array unigene sequences were
used to query (using blastx) Arabidopsis translated gene
models (version 7.0) from The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR, http://www.arabidopsis.org) and Medicago truncatula 2.0 assembly release http://www.medicago.org. Annotations for the Affymetrix soybean probe
sets were compiled into a browser called HarvEST:SoyChip which can be accessed online http://www.harvestweb.org or downloaded for Windows installation http://
harvest.ucr.edu/. The E value cut-off for the gene annotations was equal to or less than E-10, E0 being a near
perfect match.
Gene ontology based classification was obtained by
transferring the corresponding Arabidopsis gene models
to Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences
Arabidopsis thaliana FunCat database (MIPS, http://
