Abstract
Background: Delimiting species boundaries and reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of
late Tertiary and Quaternary species radiations is difficult. One recent approach emphasizes the
use of genome-wide molecular markers, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs)
and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify distinct metapopulation lineages as
taxonomic species. Here we investigate the properties of AFLP data, and the usefulness of treebased and non-tree-based clustering methods to delimit species and reconstruct evolutionary
relationships among high-elevation Ourisia species (Plantaginaceae) in the New Zealand archipelago.
Results: New Zealand Ourisia are shown to comprise a geologically recent species radiation based
on molecular dating analyses of ITS sequences (0.4–1.3 MY). Supernetwork analyses indicate that
separate tree-based clustering analyses of four independent AFLP primer combinations and 193
individuals of Ourisia produced similar trees. When combined and analysed using tree building
methods, 15 distinct metapopulations could be identified. These clusters corresponded very closely
to species and subspecies identified on the basis of diagnostic morphological characters. In contrast,
Structure and PCO-MC analyses of the same data identified a maximum of 12 and 8
metapopulations, respectively. All approaches resolved a large-leaved group and a small-leaved
group, as well as a lineage of three alpine species within the small-leaved group. We were unable
to further resolve relationships within these groups as corrected and uncorrected distances
derived from AFLP profiles had limited tree-like properties.
Conclusion: Ourisia radiated into a range of alpine and subalpine habitats in New Zealand during
the Pleistocene, resulting in 13 morphologically and ecologically distinct species, including one
reinstated from subspecies rank. Analyses of AFLP identified distinct metapopulations consistent
with morphological characters allowing species boundaries to be delimited in Ourisia. Importantly,
Structure analyses suggest some degree of admixture with most species, which may also explain
why the AFLP data do not exhibit sufficient tree-like properties necessary for reconstructing some
species relationships. We discuss this feature and highlight the importance of improving models for
phylogenetic analyses of species radiations using AFLP and SNP data.

Background
Volcanic island archipelagos, such as Hawai'i, Macaronesia, and Juan Fernández have long been the focus of studies investigating patterns and processes of species
diversification (e.g., [1-8]). However, attention is increasingly being turned to the study of other small geologically
older continental landmasses such as Madagascar, New
Guinea, New Caledonia, and New Zealand [9-14], which
are also spectacular biodiversity hotspots [15]. New Zealand hosts a unique flora, where over 85% of its native
angiosperm species are endemic [16,17]. Endemism is
greatest in the high-elevation habitats of its North and
South Islands, where many genera have diversified following late Tertiary transoceanic dispersal of a single founder
species to New Zealand [12,13,18-21].
These radiations have produced ecologically and morphologically distinct taxa, many of which have highly
restricted distributions. Delimiting the boundaries of species within these radiations and evaluating their conservation status has been difficult [22,23]. This is because the
criteria for recognizing species continue to be debated and
because the phylogenetic relationships of species, as well
as the genetic characteristics that distinguish them, are
poorly understood [14,24,25].
The operational criteria used to define species boundaries,
as well as the very nature of species, have been debated for
more than 200 years (see [26-30] and references therein).
Numerous species concepts have been proposed that
emphasize different features considered important for
delimiting species. This has led to different conclusions
regarding species limits and the number of species in
many groups [29,30]. Recently, a 'unified species concept'
was advocated that emphasizes the common element
found in many species concepts, which is that species are
separately evolving lineages or metapopulations [29-32].
This unified concept also allows the use of diverse lines of
evidence to test species boundaries (e.g., monophyly at
one or multiple DNA loci, morphological diagnosability,
ecological distinctiveness, etc. [28,29]) and is the species
concept we adopt here.
New Zealand species of Ourisia (Plantaginaceae) are typical of many New Zealand alpine plant species radiations,
as they are characterized by white zygomorphic to subrotate flowers, and polyploid species (hexaploids, 2n = 48)
that occur in a diversity of habitats. These Ourisia species
are found from sea level to 2300 m, most commonly in
subalpine to alpine herbfields, tussock grasslands and
scrub on moist to saturated, rocky, south-facing sites in
the North, South and Stewart Islands. Some species are
widespread, such as Ourisia caespitosa which is found on
all three islands. Others are narrow endemics, such as O.
vulcanica, found only on volcanic soils in the North

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/111

Island, and O. modesta, a threatened and poorly known
forest-dwelling species.
Analyses of morphological and DNA sequence data have
been used to revise the taxonomy and test biogeographic
hypotheses for 28 recognized species of Ourisia in the
Southern Hemisphere [20,33,34]. Phylogenetic analyses
of nuclear and chloroplast sequences suggest that the
genus arose in South America and that it subsequently dispersed to Tasmania and New Zealand [20]. Because the
New Zealand species form a monophyletic group, one
event of transoceanic dispersal to New Zealand was
hypothesized. In these published studies, which have
been limited in the extent of their intraspecific sampling,
little phylogenetic resolution was found within the New
Zealand lineage [20,34]. For this reason, the New Zealand
species have been delimited to date using traditional morphological methods only [33].
Here, we first use relaxed molecular clock analyses on
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)
sequences to determine the age of New Zealand Ourisia
radiation. We then investigate the potential of amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses for
delimiting New Zealand Ourisia species and reconstructing their evolutionary relationships. To do this, we use
divergence plots and supernetworks to examine the treelike properties of distances calculated from AFLP profiles
and the extent of phylogenetic congruence in the AFLP
data derived from four independent primer combinations. We then use both tree-based and non-tree-based
clustering methods on the combined AFLP profiles to estimate the number of distinct metapopulations. We interpret our findings within the context of previous
morphological studies [33] and discuss the potential and
limitations of AFLP data analyses for delimiting species
and inferring evolutionary relationships.

Results
Molecular dating the New Zealand Ourisia radiation with
previously published ITS data
Relaxed clock analyses using BEAST v1.4.7, which
assumed a mean substitution rate of 4.9 × 10-9 substitutions/site for ITS sequences, suggest that the most recent
common ancestor of the New Zealand Ourisia radiation is
0.8 million years old (95% HPD lower 0.4 mya, 95%
HPD upper 1.3 mya), a finding consistent with a Pleistocene radiation of Ourisia species in New Zealand.
Comparison of nuclear DNA sequence distances and AFLP
distances
AFLP profiles of New Zealand Ourisia did not diverge as a
simple function of increasing DNA sequence divergence.
A significant correlation was not observed between Hamming, Dice or Jaccard AFLP distances and Hamming dis-

tances obtained from nuclear DNA sequences (Fig. 1).
Similar results were obtained irrespective of whether AFLP
primer combinations were analyzed jointly or separately
(data not shown). The formulae for the three different
AFLP measures are very similar, and this was seen when
the three different AFLP distance measures were plotted
against one another (data not shown). Note that the nor-

malization used in Jaccard and Dice distances gives them
increased variance in comparison to Hamming distances,
but the increased variance did not significantly lower
bootstrap support for clades of clustered individuals, and
support for relationships among clusters was generally
low for both transformed and untransformed data.

Individual datasets and supernetwork analyses
Tree-building analyses of AFLP data from 6FAM, VIC,
NED and PET primers resulted in similar assignment of
individuals into species clusters identified by diagnostic
morphological characters (e.g., neighbour joining (NJ)
trees in Fig. 2A; other data not shown). However, species
relationships were poorly resolved, and even the largeleaved group (see below) was not supported by the majority of the analyses of individual primer combinations
(although it was moderately to highly supported in some
analyses of 6FAM and VIC) [see Additional file 1].

A Z-closure supernetwork was used to visualize the extent
of incongruence between majority rule bootstrap trees

profiles derived from 6FAM, VIC, NED and PET primers.
This supernetwork was nearly star-like, with some (but
not extensive) incongruence concerning relationships
among species (Fig. 2C). Although many species relationships were not fully resolved, the large- and small-leaved
groups were resolved (Fig. 2C). Inclusion in the analysis
of 22 putative first and second generation hybrids greatly
reduced the tree-like nature of the supernetwork (data not
shown; Meudt et al. unpubl. data), suggesting that contemporary hybridization and gene flow is unlikely to be
contributing to the lack of resolution observed with the
reduced dataset. The finding of limited incongruence
between the splits inferred from the individual data sets
was used to justify combining the data.

Phylogeny of New Zealand Ourisia based on combined
AFLP data
Trees reconstructed with combined AFLP data from the
New Zealand species of Ourisia using NJ (with different
distance measures), maximum parsimony (MP), and
Bayesian estimation generally had very similar topologies
and support values (e.g., Figs. 2B and 3; Table 1). All trees

contained a highly supported split separating two main
groups – roughly characterized by leaf size, inflorescence
type, and corolla tube characters – but otherwise had low
phylogenetic resolution. Thus, a lineage comprising O.
crosbyi, O. macrocarpa, O. macrophylla, and O. vulcanica –
hereafter referred to as the large-leaved group – was highly
supported (91–100 bootstrap percentage (BP)/100 poste-

rooted trees) [see Additional file 2] nested within a smallleaved group comprising the remaining New Zealand species (sometimes except O. modesta).
Species relationships within each of these two main
groups were not well resolved or supported, with the notable exception of one highly supported alpine lineage comprising O. glandulosa + O. spathulata + O. confertifolia
(99 BP/100 PP) in the small-leaved group. There was also
high support for grouping individuals by species for 12 of
the 13 species morphologically-delimited species [33]
(Table 2, Fig. 3), including the South Island alpine species
O. spathulata, O. glandulosa, O. confertifolia, O. simpsonii, O. remotifolia, and O. sessilifolia, the North Island O.
vulcanica, as well as O. caespitosa, O. macrophylla, O.
modesta, O. crosbyi, and the Tasmanian species O.
integrifolia (Figs. 2B and 3). O. macrocarpa was not
monophyletic. Its two subspecies were reciprocally mono-

phyletic with high support values, but they were not each
others' closest relative. The two subspecies of O. macrophylla were reciprocally monophyletic in some analyses
(or poorly resolved within O. macrophylla), and O. sessilifolia subsp. sessilifolia was paraphyletic with individuals
of subsp. splendida nested within it (Table 2, Fig. 3).
Thus, not all geographically allopatric and morphologically distinct subspecies were fully resolved by the treebuilding analyses. Interestingly, there was high support in
tree-building analyses for some geographic lineages
within O. sessilifolia (southern vs. central parts of the
South Island) and O. caespitosa (central North Island,
southern South Island + North Island, and Otago) that do
not appear to correspond entirely to morphological patterns (Fig. 3) [see Additional file 2].

show increased resolution of species clusters (data not

value at K = 12 (-143400.1), then decreased to a minimum value of K = 15 (-176974.7), and finally increased
slightly at K = 16 (-169110.7). Plots of ΔK vs. K (Fig. 4B)
showed the data had multiple peaks at K = 2 and K = 3 (ΔK
= 77.565 and 85.331, respectively), and K = 12 (ΔK =

each K with the highest likelihood) for these three values
of K is shown in Fig. 5.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/111

Most species were clearly separated into distinct clusters in
the PCO analysis of the combined AFLP dataset (Table 2,
Fig. 6). PCO-MC analysis showed that eight of these clusters (shaded in Fig. 6) were significant: O. caespitosa, O.
confertifolia + O. glandulosa + O. spathulata, O. integrifolia,
O. macrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa, O. modesta, O. remotifolia, O. sessilifolia (both subspecies), and O. simpsonii. By
contrast, individuals of the five remaining species or subspecies of the large-leaved group – O. crosbyi, O. macrocarpa subsp. calycina, O. macrophylla subsp. lactea, O.
macrophylla subsp. macrophylla, and O. vulcanica – could
not be assigned to a significant cluster.

Discussion
At K = 2 (Fig. 5A), the Ourisia individuals grouped into a
large-leaved cluster comprising O. crosbyi, O. macrocarpa,
O. macrophylla, and O. vulcanica and a small-leaved cluster
of the remaining species, although the admixture levels
for all individuals of the two subspecies of O. macrocarpa
were high [see Additional File 3 and also below]. At K = 3
(Fig. 5B) individuals of O. caespitosa formed a separate
third cluster. From K = 4 to K = 11, there was continued
subclustering within both the small-leaved and largeleaved groups (data not shown). By K = 12 (Fig. 5C), nine
of the clusters correspond to morphologically-delimited
species or subspecies for O. caespitosa (comprising 2 clusters), O. confertifolia, O. integrifolia, O. macrocarpa subsp.
calycina, O. macrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa, O. modesta, O.
remotifolia, O. sessilifolia, and O. simpsonii, whereas the two
remaining clusters comprised O. crosbyi + O. macrophylla +
O. vulcanica, and O. glandulosa + O. spathulata (Table 2).
Taking all the Structure results into consideration [35,36],
including ΔK, -ln likelihood, and individual assignment
patterns, K = 12 appears to be the optimal number of clusters determined by Structure for all the values of K tested
(K = 1 to 16).
Most pre-defined "populations" (species and subspecies)
showed a high proportion of individuals assigned to one
cluster only, generally from 73% to 95% [see Additional
File 3]. Nevertheless, some "populations" had proportions much lower than this, and very few had proportions
>95%. Thus, most species and subspecies contained levels
of admixture much higher than the 5% threshold which
might be attributed to stochastic noise. It is notable that
in cases of high levels of admixture individuals were
assigned to no more than 2 clusters. At K = 12, four species
had levels of admixture >20% with one other species cluster, i.e. O. confertifolia, O. crosbyi, O. spathulata, and O. vulcanica (Fig. 5) [see Additional File 3]. O. caespitosa had
similarly high levels of admixture (29%) to a second cluster, but this cluster largely comprised O. caespitosa individuals only (in other words, individuals of O. caespitosa were
subdivided into two distinct and unique metapopulations).

AFLP analyses and species delimitation of New Zealand
Ourisia
Our findings are consistent with earlier findings reporting
the usefulness of AFLP analyses for distinguishing distinct
metapopulations of individuals and delimiting species
boundaries [37-40,32,41]. Of the 15 clusters identified by
tree-building analyses of the combined AFLP dataset, 13
are highly supported lineages (99–100 PP; Fig. 3) and
these correspond to 11 of the 13 Australasian Ourisia species and 2 of 6 subspecies recently delimited by morphological analyses [33]. Bayesian assignment (Structure)
analyses (at the optimal K = 12 value; Table 2) identified
nine species (clusters) also identified by the tree building
analyses. The remaining three clusters identified by the
Structure analyses (for K = 12) contained groups of species
that were (in part) more fully resolved in the phylogenetic
analyses. Thus, Structure produced congruent results to
the tree-building analyses, but in contrast to expectations
[42,43], provided less resolution in identifying distinct
clusters. We speculate that this result might be explained
by a poor fit between assumptions of the Structure model
(Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within populations and
complete linkage equilibrium between loci) and our
empirical data. The results from the PCO-MC analysis
(Fig. 6) produced only eight significant clusters but were
otherwise highly congruent to tree-building (Figs. 2B, 3),
supernetwork (Fig. 2C) and STRUCTURE analyses (Fig.
5), including the difficulty in distinguishing among species in the large-leaved group.

Our AFLP tree topologies provide support for recent divergence of individuals belonging to the two subspecies of O.
macrophylla and to the two subspecies of O. sessilifolia,
respectively (Table 1, Fig. 3). This is a finding consistent
with the taxonomic recognition of subspecies in these
groups [44]. Subspecies status is appropriate here based
on geographic and morphological distinctiveness [33].
For example, O. macrophylla subsp. lactea is a north-central
South Island subspecies with glandular trichomes on the
floral bracts and calyces, whereas subsp. macrophylla is
subendemic to the North Island with eglandular tri-

chomes on the floral bracts and calyces [33]. O. sessilifolia
subsp. splendida is found in central South Island mountains and has only one line of hairs inside the corolla tube,
whereas subsp. sessilifolia is disjunct in northern and
southern parts of the South Island and has three lines of
hairs inside the corolla tube). Nevertheless, obtaining
samples of O. sessilifolia from the northern part of the
South Island for inclusion in future genetic studies is key
to fully understanding the overlapping patterns of morphological and genetic data reported here.
Interestingly, AFLP analyses suggest three distinct lineages
within O. caespitosa that correspond to the following geographic areas: 1) central North Island, 2) southern South
Island + North Island, and 3) Otago. There is also support
for the sister relationship of the first two groups. Thus, the
AFLP analyses provisionally support recognition of subspecific entities within O. caespitosa, including an Otago
variety of O. caespitosa which has been recognized in the
past [45,46] but not in the most recent treatment due to
an apparent lack of morphological differences [33]. These

In contrast to the above findings, we found no bootstrap
support in tree-building analyses for a close relationship
between the two recognised subspecies of O. macrocarpa.
These AFLP data, together with DNA sequence data
[20](Meudt et al. unpubl. data), suggest that the two subspecies comprise separate lineages that are not each others' closest relative. Further, the extent of divergence
between these two allopatric lineages as indicated by the
molecular data, coupled with the morphological differences that separate them – petiole and peduncle vestiture,
leaf shape, leaf bases, calyx margins, and calyx symmetry
[33] – comprise multiple lines of evidence that these lineages should be recognized as distinct species rather than
subspecies, i.e. O. macrocarpa Hook.f. and O. calycina
Colenso. If this interpretation is correct, it indicates that
the morphological characters traditionally used to unite
O. macrocarpa and O. calycina under one species, including large leaf lamina, fruits and flowers, oblanceolate to
narrowly ovate calyx lobes, largely glabrous leaf lamina,
and a lack of glandular hairs anywhere on the plant, may
not be not good characters for species delimitation in the
large-leaved group to which these species belong.
AFLP analyses and evolutionary relationships among New
Zealand Ourisia
Analyses of combined AFLP data identify a large- and
small-leaved group, and distinguish a lineage of three
alpine species within the small-leaved group. These inferences of evolutionary relationship are also supported by
morphological and geographic data. Thus, the four species in the large-leaved group generally have the largest
habits and biggest leaves (relative to the small-leaved
group), flowers that are always or nearly always in whorls
in each inflorescence node, and corolla tubes that are yellow and hairy inside [33]. Species in this lineage are generally found in forested to subalpine sites on the North,
South and Stewart Islands of New Zealand. The largeleaved group contains O. macrophylla subsp. macrophylla
and O. vulcanica, the only subspecies and species that are
(sub)endemic to the North Island, which is known to
have low floristic diversity and endemicity relative to the
South Island (see discussion in [20]).

In contrast, the species in the small-leaved group have
smaller habits and leaves, with flowers always or nearly
always in pairs or solitary in each inflorescence node, and
corolla tubes that are yellow and glabrous or purple and
hairy inside [33]. Species in the small-leaved group (with
the exception of Ourisia modesta) are largely high elevation, subalpine to alpine species on the South and Stewart
Islands only. Within the small-leaved group, O. glandu-

supported as a monophyletic group in most AFLP analyses – have yellow and glabrous corolla tubes and are all

the northern South Island endemic O. simpsonii could be

included in this latter alpine group but there is no support
for this in the AFLP analyses. Ourisia modesta, which is
morphologically and ecologically distinct from all other
New Zealand species [33], sometimes belongs to the

to all other species of New Zealand Ourisia (Table 1; Figs.
2 and 3).
Limitations of AFLP analyses and inferences of phylogeny
Our analyses did not resolve a bifurcating phylogeny for
the New Zealand species of Ourisia. The divergence plots
for nuclear DNA sequences and AFLP profiles indicate
that the AFLP-derived distances have limited tree-like
properties. These plots show that the AFLP Hamming distances do not increase significantly with increasing
sequence divergence (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to observations reported for other plant groups [47], and this finding contributes to the star-like features of the
supernetwork and phylogenetic trees. The lack of resolution is not explained by an absence of signal in the AFLP
data. Of the 2555 characters in the final combined AFLP
dataset, 2365 (92.6%) are parsimony informative. Given
these features of the data, we predict that reconstructed

phylogenetic trees for New Zealand Ourisia are unlikely to
become more tree-like (resolved as bifurcating) through
increasing the number of AFLP characters. A previous
study using nDNA (ITS, ETS) and cpDNA (rps16 and matK
3' introns) sequencing markers did not resolve a bifurcating phylogeny of New Zealand Ourisia but had limited
sampling (26 individuals; [20]). Two additional and more
variable markers (nDNA GBSSI and cpDNA trnC-D intergenic spacer region) are being analyzed for a large number
of individuals to further resolve the phylogeny and to
compare to the AFLP results reported here (Meudt et al.
unpubl. data).
Although Structure did not perform as effectively as treebuilding in identifying clusters, Structure analyses do provide insight into the basis of the partially-resolved phylogenetic trees. In the case of a recent and rapid plant species
radiation, it could be argued that the AFLP data have simply not evolved fast enough to accumulate substitutions

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:111

and support species relationships. However, perhaps relevant to interpretation is the observation that Structure
analyses indicate considerable admixture for many delimited metapopulations [see Additional File 3]. Stochastic
noise in the AFLP data does not explain this result since
the admixture is often >5% and is always between relatively few species. A possible explanation is hybridization
and/or incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms among diverging species. If hybridisation is contributing to this signal we suggest that it is more likely to
be ancient events of hybridisation between early diverging
Ourisia lineages rather than contemporary gene flow. This
follows from the observation that including putative
recent hybrids with intermediate morphologies into the
supernetwork analysis greatly increases the extent of
incongruence in the network (Meudt et al. unpubl.). Thus,
the inclusion of recent hybrids produces a different signature in the data analysis. Further, the species most implicated in recent hybridization events (O. caespitosa) does
not show high levels of admixture, and the supernetwork
shows very low levels of incongruence. The effect of
ancient gene flow among early diverging lineages will be
to make distance measures more similar than expected,
and phylogenetic trees less tree-like. This speculation
leads us to be cautious in interpreting the shape of the
supernetwork and Bayesian tree topologies with respect to
the pattern of species diversification. We believe their starlike features of the AFLP supernetwork and Bayesian tree
reflect processes of diversification rather than the pattern
of species radiation, an hypothesis that is being further
investigated with nDNA and cpDNA sequencing markers
(Meudt et al. unpubl. data).

Conclusion
Phylogenetic, PCO-MC and Bayesian assignment (Structure) analyses of AFLP data for New Zealand Ourisia identified species and subspecies boundaries inferred
previously from morphological analyses. In one case a
change in rank from subspecies to species was proposed.
In contrast to what has been suggested elsewhere, tree
building analyses were found to be more efficient and
robust in cluster identification than the Structure analysis
[42]. Importantly, the results from the Structure analysis
were informative for interpreting phylogenetic topology,
and suggested that ancient gene flow among metapopulations is responsible for reducing the tree-like properties of
the AFLP distance measures. If so, our observations may
also explain some of the difficulties others have had in
attempting to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species radiations using AFLP (e.g., [48-51]). Our findings
highlight the need for developing analytical methodologies that explicitly take into account the evolutionary
dynamics of rapid radiations. Such tools are needed for
analyses of AFLP data as well as the rapidly growing col-

lections of SNP data being generated by next generation
sequencing technologies.

Methods
Generation and scoring of AFLP data
Voucher specimens and leaf material dried on silica gel of
1–5 individuals from multiple populations were collected
from throughout the entire geographic range of New Zealand Ourisia on all three main islands (Fig. 7) [see Additional file 4]. A total of 215 individuals were chosen for
AFLP analyses, including six individuals from three populations of Ourisia integrifolia, the Tasmanian sister species
of New Zealand Ourisia [20] which was used as an outgroup. DNA extractions were performed using DNeasy
mini kits following the manufacturer's instructions, and
only DNAs of high quality and high concentration (as
checked on agarose gels) were used.

AFLP was performed following Meudt & Bayly [40] and
also
http://awcmee.massey.ac.nz/aflp/
AFLP_Protocol.pdf. Briefly, total DNAs were digested
using EcoRI (Roche) and MseI (NEB) restriction enzymes
for 37°C for 2 h (followed by 70°C for 15 m to denature
the enzymes). Eco- and Mse-linkers were then ligated to
the resulting DNA fragments by incubating with T4 DNA
ligase (Roche) at 37°C for 3 h. Pre-selective PCR amplification was performed using primers Eco+A (0.5 μM) and
1.0 μL Mse+C (0.5 μM) and a stringent PCR program.
Selective PCR amplification was performed using a fluorescently-labelled Eco+ANN primer (0.5 μM) and
Mse+CNN primer (0.5 μM) and a step-down PCR program. Four different fluorescently-labelled Eco primers
were used and trialled with all potential combinations of
eight different Mse+CNN primers. The following primer
combinations were chosen based on a screen involving 6
individuals: 6FAM-Eco+ACT/Mse+CCC, VIC-Eco+AGC/
Mse+CGG, NED-Eco+ATA/Mse+CTG, and PET-Eco+AAG/
Mse+CAG (hereafter, 6FAM, VIC, NED, and PET). All
primers were from Sigma except VIC-, NED- and PETlabelled primers (Applied Biosystems). For each individual, selective amplifications of each of the four dyes were
mixed together in equal amounts, and 1 μL of each sample was run on an Applied Biosystems Genetic Analyzer
3730 at the Allan Wilson Centre Genome Service. To
ascertain reproducibility, 29 replicate AFLP profiles were
generated for 22 individuals (ca. 10% of the dataset),
either from independent DNA extractions of the same leaf
material (9 individuals), or from independent restriction
digests of the same DNA extraction (13 individuals, 20
replicate runs).
Automated scoring was performed on the resulting electronic profiles using GeneMapper v3.7 (Applied Biosystems) with scoring parameters that were optimized for a
30-individual representative subset of the entire dataset

fore we only briefly note here the results of a NJ bootstrap
analysis with 1000 fast bootstrap replicates of the data
matrix (244 profiles, 2691 characters; data not shown). In
this analysis, 80% of replicate profiles, including all but
one of the replicate DNA extractions and most replicate

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:111

digests, were correctly assigned with high bootstrap percentages as sister to their replicate pairs (21 replicates
from 16 individuals, 87–100 BP) or in the same clade as
their replicate pair plus one other individual from the
same population (2 replicates from 2 individuals). With
few exceptions, the Hamming distances of these replicate
pairs were 0 to 0.08 (compared to 0 to 0.21405 for the
entire dataset). By contrast, 20% of replicate profiles (6
replicates from 6 individuals) were either sister to individuals from other geographically proximate populations of
the same species (67–94 BS) or unresolved. The Hamming distances of these 6 replicate pairs were generally
from 0.10 to 0.16, and in all cases except one these were
replicate runs based on the same DNA extraction. Upon
visual inspection of the profiles, most variation between
each replicate pair appeared to be due to differences in
peak height (and shape) that result in scoring errors during the automated scoring process ([52]; pers. obs.).
Following scoring optimization and replicate checking, all
29 replicate profiles were removed; in addition, 22 putative natural hybrid individuals identified based on morphological characters were also removed and will be
discussed in detail in a separate publication (Meudt et al.
unpubl. data). This resulted in a final dataset of 193 individuals from multiple populations representing the ecological and morphological diversity of New Zealand
Ourisia plus the Tasmanian outgroup. The combined
binary matrix of 2555 characters (721, 6FAM; 692, VIC;
612, NED; 530, PET) was then exported and converted
into a NEXUS file using GenotyperRearranger (W. Allen,
unpubl., available at http://awcmee.massey.ac.nz/aflp/
aflp.html).
Comparison of AFLP distances and nuclear sequence data
distances
Koopman [47] reviewed the potential of AFLP data for
reconstructing the evolutionary histories of plants. He
reported that the topologies of AFLP trees were largely
congruent with ITS trees in several studies, and that AFLP
was able to resolve with high bootstrap support relationships of individuals that differed by ca. 10–30 ITS nucleotide differences. Koopman [47] noted that when ITS
sequence divergence was neither too small nor too large
(i.e., divergence is approximately 3–5%) AFLP profiles
appear to provide useful phylogenetic information. Nevertheless, the relationship between rates of divergence in
AFLP and nuclear DNA sequence data – an important
issue that has bearing on whether AFLP is appropriate for
tree-building analyses – has not been critically examined.
We investigated the relationship of AFLP-derived distances (Hamming and Jaccard and Dice transformed distances [53-55]) with ITS and GBSSI sequence divergences
for New Zealand Ourisia. Hamming distances were calculated for ITS sequences representing 25 individuals

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/111

obtained in an earlier study [20] and for GBSSI (part of
waxy) sequences representing 65 individuals (Meudt et al.
unpubl. data). Divergence plots were then obtained by
comparing these distances with Hamming, Jaccard and
Dice distances calculated from AFLP profiles. This was
done for 25 individuals collected from the same populations/locality as the individuals sampled for ITS and from
the same 65 individuals sequenced for GBSSI. Distances
were obtained using SplitsTree 4.10 [56] and compared
using a script written in R (S. Joly, unpubl.).
Molecular dating analyses
To verify that New Zealand Ourisia comprise a recent,
rapid radiation, and to provide a temporal context for
interpreting genetic variation within the group, a relaxed
molecular clock approach [57] was used to re-analyze previously published ITS data [20]. This analysis assumed a
mean substitution rate for ITS sequences for ten herbaceous plant groups reported by [58] of 4.69 × 10-9 substitutions/site (prior: normal distribution, standard
deviation = 1.82 × 10-9), the optimal GTR + gamma (4 rate
categories) substitution model, tree prior: Yule process,
tree prior: tmrcaNZgroup, using a dataset with 42 individuals of Ourisia from South America, Australia, and New
Zealand and the software BEAST v1.4.7. [57]. The chain
length was 10,000,000 and convergence was monitored
in independent runs using Tracer v1.4.1 http://
beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer.
Tree-building analyses and assessment of data partition
homogeneity
To address questions of species delimitation and relationships, AFLP data generated from multiple primer combinations are generally combined into one large matrix and
analyzed together to produce a phylogenetic tree. This is
often done without assessing the homogeneity of the data
partitions (e.g., [41,51,53]). Although this issue has been
extensively discussed in the literature when analysing
sequences from independent gene loci, the issue is not
often considered for individual AFLP characters (see discussion in [52]) or sets of characters (such as individual
primer combinations). One advantage of analyzing the
partitions separately is that it provides an opportunity to
check for bias in phylogenetic estimates arising from any
biological and/or technical reasons related to the AFLP
protocol.

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for all individual
primer datasets using maximum parsimony (MP), neighbour joining (NJ), and Bayesian inference methods. NJ
trees were built using Hamming, Jaccard and Dice distances with SplitsTree 4.10 [56] and TREECON v1.3b
[59]. MP trees were built using PAUP v4b10 [60]. The
results obtained from nonparametric bootstrapping
(using 1000 replicates for NJ and 100 replicates with TBR

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:111

heuristic searches for MP) were displayed in 50% majority
rule bootstrap consensus trees. For Bayesian inference, a
restriction site model was used [61]. For each dye, four
independent chains, each of length 50 million sampling
every 5000 trees, were run using MrBayes v3.1 [62]. Convergence was assessed using Tracer v1.4.1, and a burn-in
of 30 million trees was used.
To assess the degree to which the bootstrap consensus
trees for the four individual primer combinations were in
agreement with each other, we constructed a filtered
supernetwork for each NJ and MP bootstrap consensus
tree in SplitsTree 4.10 [56]. Supernetworks provide a
means to visualize incongruence between potentially
large bifurcating trees. Because they generalize supertree
construction to networks, they can also facilitate interpretation of evolutionary histories that are complex or uncertain [63,64]. Filtered supernetworks [63,64] emphasize
the commonality of the strongest signal from independent datasets, and allow visualization of the support for
species delimitation and evolutionary relationships. Even
given the stochastic error that can be associated with AFLP
fingerprint profiles, supernetworks provide a framework
for assessing whether independent data provide corroborating evidence for species limits and evolutionary relationships.
For tree-building analyses of the combined AFLP data,
MP, NJ and Bayesian analyses were performed as above.
Non parametric bootstrapping of MP and NJ trees was
also used to cluster individuals for the combined AFLP
profiles, performed as above.
Bayesian and PCO-MC analyses of genetic structure of the
AFLP dataset
We used the program Structure v2.2.3 [42] and PCO-MC
[65] to investigate patterns of genetic structure in New
Zealand Ourisia to compare with and complement the
tree-building analyses regarding species delimitation.
Structure is a mixture model-based Bayesian clustering
method that groups individuals into K populations or
species and assigns admixture proportions of each individual to these groups. The most recent version of the program is recommended over the previous version (v2.1) for
AFLP data because it has been modified to treat dominant
markers explicitly [66]. Although not explicitly developed
for addressing questions of species delimitation, Structure
has been used successfully in a recent study to delimit
recently evolved species where clades were not sufficiently
distinct to be recovered by tree-based methods [43]. We
ran Structure firstly to determine the number of clusters in
the dataset and their composition, and secondly to identify any evidence of admixture in each cluster and interpret it in light of the phylogenetic results.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/111

The combined AFLP dataset of 193 individuals was analyzed in Structure using an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies, without incorporating population
information into the analyses. Preliminary analyses determined that stationarity of parameters (alpha, ln likelihood, Fst) was achieved by 25,000 generations (data not
shown). Thus, for all Structure analyses, we used a total
run length of 100,000 generations, including a burn-in of
25,000 generations, testing K = 1 to 16 with three separate
runs at each K. Individuals were assigned to 16 a priori
"populations" (morphologically-defined species and subspecies groupings following [33]) that were not taken into
consideration in the analyses, but were nevertheless used
in resulting figures to improve visualization of the results.
We plotted the mean -ln likelihood of the data vs. K, and
ΔK vs. K for all runs [35], and examined all groupings at
each K.
We also analyzed the combined Ourisia AFLP dataset
using PCO-MC, a recently published method [65] which
couples principal coordinate analysis (PCO) with a clustering procedure to determine significant population
structure. This method offers an objective way to determine whether clusters found in the PCO are significant,
and it simultaneously takes into consideration many or all
of the axes that explain the variation in a dataset (as
opposed to only the first three that can be easily visualised
[65]). The PCO-MC analysis was carried out on the combined Ourisia AFLP dataset following [65] and http://
lamar.colostate.edu/~reevesp/PCOMC/PCOMC.html by
performing a PCO analysis in NTSYS 2.11× (Exeter Software) using Jaccard distances and DCENTER, EIGEN, and
MOD3D modules, and then performing the cluster analysis using the MODECLUS procedure in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute).
