Abstract
Background: Clonal marine organisms exhibit high levels of morphological variation.
Morphological differences may be a response to environmental factors but also they can be
attributed to accumulated genetic differences due to disruption of gene flow among populations. In
this study, we examined the extensive morphological variation (of 14 characters) in natural
populations observed in the gorgonian Eunicea flexuosa, a widely distributed Caribbean octocoral.
Eco-phenotypic and genetic effects were evaluated by reciprocal transplants of colonies inhabiting
opposite ends of the depth gradient and analysis of population genetics of mitochondrial and
nuclear genes, respectively.
Results: Significant differences (P < 0.001) in 14 morphological traits were found among colonies
inhabiting 12 locations distributed in seven reefs in southwest Puerto Rico. Results from principal
component analysis indicated the presence of two groups based on depth distribution, suggesting
the presence of two discrete morphotypes (i.e. shallow type < 5 m and deep type > 17 m). A
discriminant function analysis based on a priori univariate and multivariate analyses (which
separated the colonies in morphotypes) correctly classified 93% of the colonies for each
environment. Light, water motion and sediment transport might influence the distribution of the
two morphotypes. Reaction norms of morphological characters of colonies reciprocally
transplanted showed gradual significant changes through the 15 months of transplantation. Sclerites
of shallow water colonies became larger when transplanted to deeper environments and vice versa,
but neither of the two transplanted groups overlapped with the residents' morphology. Genetic
analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genes suggested that such discrete morphology and nonoverlapping phenotypic plasticity is correlated with the presence of two independent evolutionary
lineages. The distribution of the lineages is non-random and may be related to adaptational
responses of each lineage to the environmental demands of each habitat.
Conclusion: The extensive distribution and ample morphological variation of Eunicea flexuosa
corresponds to two distinct genetic lineages with narrower distributions and more rigid phenotypic
plasticity than the original description. The accepted description sensu Bayer (1961) of E. flexuosa
is a complex of at least two distinct genetic lineages, adapted to different habitats and do not
exchange genetic material despite living in sympatry. The present study highlights the importance
of correctly defining species, because the unknowingly use of species complexes can overestimate
geographical distribution, population abundance, and physiological tolerance.

Background
The phenotype is considered the product of inherited
genetic information and its interaction with the environment. Thus, differences in the phenotype can be explained
by variations in environmental conditions, but also such
phenotypic differences may reflect accumulated genetic
variation due to disruption of gene flow between populations, and their subsequent speciation into biological species.
First, phenotypic plasticity enhances the survival and
reproductive success of individuals by contributing to
their ability to cope with environmental changes and to
potentially adapt to new niches. Plasticity is an emergent
property of the genotype and therefore also susceptible to
natural selection [1]. The change of the plastic response is
often continuous, when the trait under analysis is subjected to an environmental gradient suspected to induce
changes [2]. The spectrum of phenotypes due to the environmental change describes the norms of reaction [2,3].
Among the metazoans that exhibit the most extensive
phenotypic plasticity are the marine modular species.
Phenotypic plasticity has been studied in algae [4],
sponges [5], barnacles [6], gastropods [7,8], bryozoans [9]
and anthozoans [10-16]. This plasticity provides organisms with the ability to generate the fittest phenotype suiting local conditions. Morphology is then acquired
through development under the current environment and
can be changed in the next generation, if conditions are
modified. Strong environmental gradients in the sea (e.g.
light, water flow, sediment transport) may restrict the distribution of individuals to habitats, representing opposite
ends of the gradient, where each phenotype is adapted
[17,18]. Furthermore, the fitness of the phenotypes varies
along the environmental gradient [17]. Disruptive selection may enhance the success of the two phenotypes at the
opposite ends of the gradient by ecologically favoring
each phenotype in its more suitable environment and by
increasing genetic divergence. In this case, organisms settle and suffer high mortalities in non-optimal environments. Disruptive selection may be an influential
evolutionary force leading to two disparate phenotypes by
the existence of non-random mating related to habitat utilization [19].
In the absence of local adaptation, the high dispersal
potential of marine propagules usually results in genetic
homogeneity over large distances [20-22]. However, allopatric speciation is possible mainly because changes in
oceanographic conditions, the emergence of land masses
[23], and disconnection of populations by lower sea levels
[24]. As gene flow is disrupted by a geographic barrier,
populations become isolated and diverge due to genetic
drift. After genetic divergence has been acquired through

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/47

generations of genetic drift and restricted gene flow, secondary contact can be achieved when the two new lineages attain similar geographic distributions [25].
Apart from allopatric divergence, sympatric divergence is
also plausible. Speciation has occurred in spawning
organisms with larvae capable of long dispersal [26-28]
and genetic differences have been detected in sympatric
populations [29,30]. Ecological specializations to different habitats [31,32], variable symbiotic relationships
related to habitat distribution [33] and unsynchronized
gamete release [34-36] may prevent organisms to reproduce randomly in sympatry, leading to a rapid evolution
of mating systems [37-39] and eventually to speciation. It
is not surprising that sibling species in the sea are more
common than previously thought [40]. Species with novel
gene combinations can also be formed sympatrically
through hybridization, an important process of diversification in marine and terrestrial systems [41-43].
In octocorals, phenotypic plasticity along environmental
gradients or habitats is not uncommon [12,14,29,44-47].
Octocorals are relatively abundant and visually dominant
in low relief hard ground habitats with preference for high
water motion areas [48,49]. Light, water motion and sediment transport are determining factors in the distribution
of gorgonians [49]. These abiotic factors may induce morphological adjustments in broadly distributed species to
optimize fitness under suboptimal conditions. Colonies
of Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux 1821), in shallow forereef
areas are susceptible to high water motion and are generally taller; grow in a single plane with thicker branches
and bigger calices. In contrast, colonies in deeper environments are exposed to low water motion and less light.
There, the colonies exhibit multiplane growth, are smaller
with fewer terminal branches than their shallow counterparts with smaller and more sparse calices [12]. Sclerite
plasticity has also been correlated with differences in
water motion and light [12,14]. Smaller and thinner clubs
and spindles are present in high water motion environments (i.e., forereef areas), providing a stronger structure
and support to the colony [14]. The high morphological
variability in E. flexuosa could be due to phenotypic plasticity, genetic differentiation or a combined effect. In this
study, first, the morphological variation of 14 traits of E.
flexuosa was evaluated in seven reefs (from protected to
exposed areas to water motion) at two depths (< 5 m and
>17 m) and the correlation of morphology with light,
water motion and sediment patterns was inferred. Second,
environmental and/or genetic factors were studied to
define the morphological variation of E. flexuosa. Reciprocal transplants of colonies inhabiting the opposite ends of
the depth gradient were used to infer patterns, magnitude
and direction of the phenotypic response. Gene genealogies of the mitochondrial gene msh1 and the nuclear gene

18S were used to elucidate possible genetic-phenotypic
interactions. Lastly, allopatric and sympatric divergence
(through ecological differentiation) and hybridization
was considered as possible evolutionary processes that
produce and maintain the morphological and genetic variation found in E. flexuosa.

Results
Natural Variability of Morphological Traits
Mean values per trait and habitat are shown in Fig. 1.
Measurements of morphological characters of most colonies in a given location fell within a narrow range around
the mean. However, there were few colonies that did not
match the mean population values. These atypical colonies were closer morphologically to colonies inhabiting
the opposite depth habitat than to their neighbours and
showed that in a given location, colonies under similar
environmental conditions develop different morphologies. All traits varied significantly between reefs and
among depths (Fig. 1). Values for CL, CW, CAL, CAW CD,
SA, BT, CH, PD, TBN, and TBM decreased as depth
increased, whereas values for SL, SW and ID increased
with increasing depth (Fig. 1).

Depth differences were also recovered in the principal
component analysis. The first principal component (PC1)
explained 64% of the variance among measurements and
was characterized by high negative loadings for SL, SW
and ID and high positive loadings for CW, CAW, SA and
BT (Table 1). PC2 explained 16% of the variance and was
characterized mainly by positively weighted CL, CW and
CAL and negatively by CD. Two-way ANOVA on the loading values of the first three principal components showed
significant differences in reef and depth in PC1 (Table 2)
and PC2 loadings showed significant differences in reef.
Since 80% of the variation was explained by the first two
principal components, environmental gradients related to
depth, water motion, light and sediment transport could
probably explain a portion of the morphological differences. As these co-vary with depth, it was not possible to
quantify their individual effects on the morphological variation of E. flexuosa.
Results of the discriminant function analysis based on
Wilk's λ (depth = 0.19, F = 56.29, P < 0.0001; reef λ = 0.31,
F = 3.60, P < 0.0001 and zone λ = 0.21, F = 15.76, P <
0.0001) showed significant differences in colonies of different depths, reefs and zones. Depth differences as
expected from the univariate and PCA analyses were
clearly defined (Fig. 2) and the correct classification percentage was high (93%). The colonies in shallow habitats
are concentrated on the right side of the canonical plot,
while colonies in deep areas are mostly in the left side.
There were a few deep water colonies misclassified and
embedded within the shallow ones and vice versa (Fig. 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/47

Canonical plots of the DFAs of reef and zone showed high
percentages of misclassification, 39% and 41%, however,
a tendency from protected and deep to exposed and shallow was observed (data not shown).
The results suggest the presence of two morphotypes (Fig.
3). The first morphotype fits well with Bayer's description;
adult colonies exhibit bushy-like shape and branch profusely in a single plane. Microscopically, size of leaf clubs,
structural spindles and fused capstans are of ~200 μm,
~1000 μm and ~200 μm, respectively. The two morphotypes found in two depth habitats (hereafter deep and
shallow indicating the depth of habitat) are exposed to
different water motion, light, and sediment transport
regimes. However, each morphotype was recorded in very
low numbers at the opposite habitat. The shallow type
was found more frequently in deep habitats than the deep
type in shallow areas. Also, colonies sampled in the outer
shelf reefs were morphologically closer to those in shallow areas of inshore and mid reefs; however the presence
of both morphotypes was higher in such environments
and each type was represented by at least six colonies (15
colonies total). In Weinberg, the presence of deep type
colonies was associated with sand channels, areas characterized by high sediment transport. Along these channels
deep type colonies were more frequently encountered.
Transplant Experiment
On average, transplanted branches grew 1.94 ± 0.34 (1
SD) cm during the 15 months of the study. The new tissue
deposited at the tip of the branches was enough to allow
sampling of sclerites developed under novel conditions,
thus the analysis excluded premature sclerites present at
the very tip of the colony.

A two-way ANOVA test on linear growth values revealed a
significant difference across depths (df = 1, F = 12.15, P =
0.001). Colonies in shallow environments regardless of
population source (residents or transplanted) grew
almost twice as fast as their deep counterparts. Population
source and population X depth interaction were not significant (df = 1, 1; F = 0.067, 0.10; P = 0.80, 0.75; respectively). Of the 90 initial colonies transplanted, 59 were
recovered for sclerite analysis. The mortality was not independent among groups (X2 = 10.449, df = 3, P < 0.025).
The control colonies either from deep to deep, or shallow
to shallow had higher survivorship (93% and 80%,
respectively) than the transplanted ones. Mortality was
highest (57% ex 17 of 30 colonies) in colonies transplanted from shallow to deep areas. Most of these colonies died by the 6th month; however neither detachment
nor presence of predators was noticeable during the experiment. Competition with other reef organisms was also
not evident. In most cases the tissue started to peel away
until the entire axis was exposed. Colonies transplanted

The first three principal components are shown, calculated from 14
skeletal traits measured on E. flexuosa, collected from the 12 locations
(seven reefs were included). The character codes are: club length
(CL), club width (CW), capstan length (CAL), capstan width (CAW),
spindle length (SL), spindle width (SW), calice diameter (CD),
intercalice distance (ID), surface area (SA), polyp density (PD), branch
thickness (BT), terminal branch number (TBN) terminal branch
average length (TBL) and colony height (CH).

23 of 30 colonies), nonetheless bleaching was recorded in
14 colonies (46%) and 23% of those died.
After 15 months of the experiment, measurements of sclerites for shallow and deep colonies were within the range
suggested by the natural variability analyses (Fig. 4). However, spindle width and length of the reciprocally transplanted colonies gradually became similar to those of the
resident colonies but never overlapped, colonies trans-

sclerite size while spindles of colonies from deep to shallow became smaller. CL, CW, CAL and CAW showed similar trends but exhibited lower percent variation within
groups, therefore resulting in non-significance between

Some colonies (i.e., SD16, SD18, SD19, DS7, DS8, DS14,
DS 15, DS17, DS22, DS 23 and DD2) differed significantly from their source population either shallow or

ANOVAs (Table 3) also showed significant differences
among populations (DD, SS, SD and DS) for most traits
(except CL and CAL) and the time X population interaction in SL and SW.
DNA Analysis
All colonies found in either shallow or deep areas were
classified as deep habitat or shallow habitat. Morphology
was used to define the second group of populations (deep
or shallow types). The two classification schemes are not
identical, as the atypical colonies found during the morphological analysis could be correctly classified. Also,
each reef was treated as one population so that among reef
comparisons could be established.

Msh1
A total of 130 sequences of msh1 (723 bp) resulted in 10
distinct haplotypes, with three to nine haplotypes per
population. The numbers of segregating sites were similar
between populations, 9 and 8 sites were observed for colonies inhabiting shallow and deep environments, respectively.

The shallow type possessed 6 haplotypes and the deep
type contained 4 haplotypes, among which the maximum
difference was 6 substitutions. There were 2 and 3 segregating sites in the shallow and deep types, respectively.
The most common haplotypes within each of shallow and
deep types were represented by 54 and 30 individuals,
respectively. The values of the nucleotide diversity indices
(π, θ) for the pooled data were 0.0039 and 0.0024, respec-

tively. π ranged from 0.0007 (shallow type) to 0.0039
(Romero reef), whereas θ was lowest in deep type
(0.0009) and highest in Media Luna reef (0.0028). Most
of the haplotypes were singletons; this mutation pattern
was more common in colonies of shallow habitats. Fu's Fs
test for the shallow and deep type revealed a significant
departure from equilibrium only for the shallow type (3.05038, P = 0.037). The excess of rare mutations
observed in the shallow type is consistent with population
expansion or purifying selection. Tajima's D tests were not
significant.
The within shallow and deep type divergence varied from
0% to 0.3%, as estimated with the Kimura-2-parameter
model [50]. Divergence between shallow and deep types
ranged from 0.61% to 1.07%. The shallow type was more
closely related (0.61% to 0.76%) to Plexaura homomalla
than the deep type (0.92% to 1.23%).
18S
A 251 bp fragment of 18S was sequenced from 143 colonies of E. flexuosa. Most of the sequences (90) were from
Media Luna reef (colonies used in the transplant experiment), while 32 sequences were from Romero and an
additional 21 from Culebra. Among all sequences, 15
haplotypes were discernable with colonies in shallow
habitats presenting the highest haplotype diversity (h =
11). Among reefs, Media Luna had the highest number of
haplotypes (h = 11). The values of the nucleotide diversity
indices (π, θ) for the pooled data were 0.0088 and 0.0079,
respectively. π ranged from 0.0014 (deep type) to 0.0093
(Romero reef), whereas the lowest (0.0044) and the highest θ (0.0089) was also observed in the same data partitions. The within shallow type genetic variability ranged
from 0% to 0.97%, and the within deep type variability
ranged from 0 to 0.48%, as estimated by the Kimura-2parameter model. Divergence between shallow and deep
types was similar to the msh1 divergence and ranged from
0.97% to 1.95%. Fu's Fs test for the data partitions
revealed a significant departure from equilibrium for the

shallow type (-3.7390, P = 0.0459) and the deep type (4.4450, P = 0.0036). The excess of rare mutations
observed in the ribosomal gene of the shallow type may
be explained by population expansion or purifying selection. Tajima's D was significant only for the deep type (1.6119, P = 0.0224). Departure from equilibrium was
consistently observed across the two genes only for the
shallow type group. The significant departure from neutrality recorded in the deep type by the 18S gene and not
the msh1 gene, may be attributed to the fact that the two
genes belong to different genomes and are under different
selection and stochastic processes.
AMOVA tests showed significant differentiation among
populations (Table 4), regardless whether the populations were divided per habitat (shallow or deep) or by
morphotype (shallow type and deep type). Nonetheless,
population differentiation was maximized when the latter
assignment was used. A comparison among reefs (Media
Luna and Romero) yielded non-significant FST values, suggesting an extensive gene flow among these two reefs.
Also, a comparison of all shallow habitats (Romero shallow, Media Luna shallow and Culebra) suggested homogeneity among populations. The genetic homogeneity
within La Parguera is not surprising because of the short
distance between the reefs. Even when including colonies
from Culebra, which is 100 km northeast from La Parguera, genetic homogeneity was still observed. However,
when comparisons of reefs lacking the deep habitats (e.g.,
in Culebra only shallow areas were sampled), FST values
were significant, suggesting population subdivision. As
inferred from the AMOVAs the haplotype network analysis showed similar patterns (Fig. 5). Two groups were
extracted from the haplotype network analysis, the first
consists of the vast majority of sequences that have the
shallow morphotype and the second group contains most
of the deep morphotype.
Gene genealogies were constructed in PAUP using ML

tion models for msh1 and 18S, respectively. Analysis performed using neighbour joining and parsimony yielded
similar patterns. Also, the topology of msh1 and 18S was
similar, however the 18S analysis recovered only one of
the clades, as 18S was less variable than msh1.
The genealogy divided the individuals in two clades (Fig.
6), which are highly indicative of the habitat origin (shallow or deep). In the bottom clade, 62 of the colonies are
from deep areas; however nine colonies fell within this
clade. These nine colonies are the atypical colonies found
during the morphological analysis (e.g., Media Luna shal-

low), where comparisons of morphological characters of
these atypical colonies did not match the overall population mean, despite living in the same habitat. Similar patterns are displayed for the top clade, which represents 68
colonies sampled in shallow areas and three atypical colonies found in deep areas. Furthermore, these atypical
colonies in each clade are those colonies that were misclassified (7%) by the discriminant function analysis.
Table 5 shows a summary of the number of individuals
within each genetic lineage divided by habitat and morphotype (shallow and deep types). The atypical colonies
within each habitat were later shown by the DNA analysis
(Fig. 6) to be phylogenetically closer to their opposite
habitat congeners, reinforcing the morphological differences.

Discussion
Eunicea flexuosa is divided into two discrete morphological forms in southwest Puerto Rico. The shallow type is
pervasive in shallow areas, but a few colonies of the shallow type can be found in deep habitats. The second morphotype (deep type) could be described as small colonies,
with fewer terminal branches, more sparsely polyps, thinner branches and bigger spindles. The deep type is found
at the muddy bed at the base of forereef of inside and mid
reefs and largely confined to deep areas with low water
motion patterns, high sediment transport and lower light
levels. The observed variation in E. flexuosa resembles

findings on phenotypic plasticity of other modular organisms. Mechanical stimuli such as wind speed or water
motion induce morphological adjustments in both terrestrial and marine plants [4,51]. Other marine modular taxa
such as the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea adapt to
water flow to maximize food capture [52], the demosponge Halichondria panacea develop stiffer branches in
high energy habitats [5] and the coral Madracis mirabilis

exhibit sparser and thicker branches in high flow areas
[10]. Light has also been associated with phenotypic
changes in plants [53], algae [54] and corals [55]. Other
non-mechanical stimuli such as presence of predators in
the bryozoan M. membranacea can induce plastic
responses (i.e. defensive spines) [9].
The discrete morphological distribution found in E. flexuosa is in concordance with previous studies of octocorals,
where colonies inhabiting deep forereef areas were thinner with more sparse and fewer calices and have bigger
spindles than the colonies in shallow habitats in either
back or forereef areas in the Florida Keys [12]. Spindles at
the branch tip were significantly smaller and presumably
underdeveloped in E. flexuosa, while in Briareum asbestinum, West [47] reported bigger spindles at the tips. The
discrepancy of the findings may be related to different
ecological pressures on the two species, different function
of spindles in each species (i.e., B. asbestinum lacks a central axis) or may depict difference responses constrained
by their separate phylogenetic history. Moreover in terms
of habitat differences, smaller spindles at high water
motion areas are thought to increase stiffness of the colony to avoid breakage. Grigg [56], West et al. [14] and
Kim et al. [12] reported that sclerite size is negatively correlated with water motion for B. asbestinum and E. flexuosa.
However, the opposite observation has been made in
Eunicella singularis [45]. Colony size, calice diameter and
polyp density may compensate water flow changes and
enhance respiration, feeding or structure as has been
reported for scleractinian corals [10,57,58]. Furthermore,
the overall discrepancy in colony development (more and
bigger terminal branches) may be interpreted as a
response to the water drag forces acting upon the colony,
yet colonies in shallow areas are exposed to higher water
flow and vice versa.
In E. flexuosa, the differences of the two morphotypes are
related to depth profiles, water motion and sediment
transport. However, as water motion, sediment transport
and light co-vary along depth profiles, the study could not
distinguish the individual influences. Furthermore, the
deep habitats of the inside and mid reefs differ significantly from those of the outer reefs. In the inside and mid
reefs, loose sediments move along the slope and are
deposited at the base of the forereef, where deep colonies
were sampled. Therefore, settling larvae in such areas are
subject to higher sediment deposition and probably have
developed an adaptational response to such environmental condition. Similarly, colonies in the two outer reefs, El
Hoyo and Weinberg, developed in the edges of sand
patches were different than those spread along the hard
ground bottom. In La Parguera, the octocoral community
observed at the sand bed adjacent to the forereef (~20 m),
is less diverse than the community of hard ground habi-

Muricea muricata was used as an outgroup. In grey are colonies sampled in shallow areas and in black colonies in deep

which are highly indicative of the habitat origin (shallow or
deep). In one clade (bottom) most of the colonies (62) are

tats. In such suboptimal habitats, Pseudopterogorgia spp.,
Plexaurella spp. and some Muricea spp. (except Muricia
muricata) are the dominant species. These species are
probably better adapted to overcome sediment suffocation and develop. Pseudopterogorgia spp. and Muricea spp.
avoid sediment burial by rapidly reaching a safe size due
to the lack of thick central axis which allows for faster
growth. In Plexaurella spp., the presence of big polyps can
efficiently remove sediment from the colony. The deep
type of E. flexuosa is a thin colony with a small central axis
and few polyps, which might grow fast enough to overcome sediment overload.
The morphology of E. flexuosa can also be affected by light
and other factors associated with depth such as food
resources, presence of predators and hydrostatic pressure.
Nonetheless, water motion covaries with depth and therefore both are related. Light is likely a major factor related
to depth and affects anthozoan morphology, as presence
of zooxanthellae is tightly related to carbonate uptake and
energy supply for the host. Light levels influence the phenotype of anthozoans due to changes in zooxanthellae
concentration and decrease of calcification rates
[14,55,59,60]. Moreover, plate-like colonies most likely
represent an evolutionary response to compensate for low
levels of light by increasing area and zooxanthellae concentrations.
The two morphologies of E. flexuosa associated with different habitats showed some degree of phenotypic plasticity
in sclerite characters (especially spindles), which showed
a clear tendency to increase and decrease when transplanted to deep and shallow areas, respectively. Nonetheless, after the 15 months of the experiment in neither case
the spindles of transplanted colonies became similar in
size as the residents' spindles. The results suggest that
either there was not enough time for the colonies to produce new tissue under the novel conditions or there is a
non-environmental factor accounting for the rest of the
morphological variation. There is less evidence for the
former; colonies grew on average ~2 cm during the transplant experiment, and since the analysis was performed
using tissue 1 cm from the branch tip, there was more
than 0.5 cm tissue to be analyzed. Also, the reaction norm
graphs showed a stabilization of the curve at 10 and 15
months, suggesting that the maximum of variation was
reached.
Gorgonian corals resemble plants in many ways and morphologically they are modular organisms where integration/disintegration can occur in response to
environmental gradients [61]. If phenotypic plasticity in
gorgonians is expressed at the modular level (polyp and
branch), the transplant results may be interpreted as the
sum of all historical (branches before transplantation)

Page 11 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:47

and experimental (branches during transplantation)
interactive and antagonistic changes between modules.
The observed changes in sclerite size which are changes
affecting individual modules suggest there is some plasticity at the modular level. The plastic response of modules
has cascade effects on the colony level. For example, when
colonies are transplanted from deep to shallow areas, sclerites become smaller and denser enhancing the flexibility
of the colony.
Other transplant experiments with modular organisms
(e.g., the sponge Halichondria panacea) exhibit variable
responses to environmental stimuli [5]. When colonies of
H. panacea were placed in high energy areas, they became
stiffer, a response which is in agreement with our observations on E. flexuosa. Alternatively, plasticity may be most
likely promoted during the early life stages rather than in
mature colonies. Other stochastic environmental factors
such as the 2005 Caribbean wide bleaching event may
have affected the results.
The possibility that no environmental factors account for
the majority of morphological variation is supported by
the genetic data. Analysis of the msh1 and 18S genes
resulted in two major lineages associated with depth. Colonies transplanted from shallow to deep habitats suffered
about 50% mortality; those transplanted from deep to
shallow suffered 20% mortality. Since survivorship is a
fundamental attribute of fitness then increase in mortality
would indicate lower fitness. Therefore, each morphotype
is better adapted to the deep or shallow areas. The results
from the transplant experiments may represent experimental error or a drastic response of the colonies to novel
environmental conditions. Previous studies have shown
that adult colonies (> 20 cm) in natural populations are
stable and have a normal survivorship rates above 90%
[62], suggesting that such high mortalities are natural
responses rather than sampling error. Although the two
genetic lineages are associated with the two habitats, there
is a noticeable response of both shallow and deep type to
environmental stimuli. As previous studies have reported,
there is a positive correlation of spindles to increase in size
as depth increases and vice versa [12,14]. Clubs and capstans slightly changed with depth but the tendency was
not consistent.
In Puerto Rico, the morphological divergence found in
colonies of E. flexuosa is genetically based. Gene genealogies, haplotype networks and AMOVA analysis of both
nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested that such discrete morphological distribution is correlated with the
presence of two distinct lineages, distributed non-randomly in shallow and deep environments. However,
either of the two lineages can infrequently be found in
both depth habitats. The genetic break found in nuclear

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/47

and mitochondrial DNA suggests that gene flow ceased a
long time ago and divergence may have led to speciation.
Fixed differences in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes
are comparable to those reported between species of octocorals [63,64]. Therefore, the current description sensu
Bayer [46] of E. flexuosa is a complex of at least two distinct genetic lineages, adapted to different habitats and
that do not exchange genetic material despite living in
sympatry. The extensive distribution and ample morphological variation corresponds to two distinct genetic lineages with narrower distributions and more rigid
phenotypic plasticity. The observed genetic pattern may
have resulted from 1) secondary contact after populations
diverged in allopatry and reproductive incompatibility
developed, 2) by divergence with gene flow through ecological specialization in sympatry or 3) by the poorly
understood process of hybridization in anthozoan evolution.
Processes of Divergence
The planulae of most anthozoan broadcasters such as E.
flexuosa are capable of staying days to weeks in the water
column producing genetically homogeneous populations
across large geographic areas [21,22,65]. Despite the high
potential for dispersion and population connectivity,
allopatric speciation is probably the most common mode
of speciation in marine environments [23,24,66,67].
Recent genetic studies [68-71] have contradicted earlier
assumptions of population homogeneity in Caribbean
populations of marine taxa [72,73]. Even though allopatric distribution could have caused the divergence of the
lineages, there is no recent evidence of geological processes that may have altered the patterns of Caribbean circulation. However, distinct sympatric lineages have been
uncovered in other Caribbean invertebrates [74].

On the other hand, sympatric speciation by ecological differentiation [17] and disruption of gene flow in proximate
populations is plausible. The two genetic lineages of E.
flexuosa are found at the opposite ends of a depth gradient.
Diversifying selection may favor the two phenotypes at
the extremes of the depth gradient, preventing gene flow
through assortative mating and eventually leading to new
species [75]. These ecological specializations to depth
habitats have been pointed out in earlier reviews [32].
Such ecological differences in niche utilization may be
reinforced by dissimilar characteristics associated with the
habitats they occupy. Symbiotic relationships to host [76]
or to environment [77], differential timing of gamete
release due to depth related differences [34,35] may have
provided different resources to populations at different
habitats and eventually prevent random mating. As a consequence, rapid evolution of mating systems may have
been favoured [37-39]. In Caribbean corals, diversifying
selection has been proposed in at least two species: Mon-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:47

tastraea annularis [27] and Favia fragum [30]. It is likely
that the genetic differences reported by Brazeau and Harvell [29] in the gorgonian B. asbestinum could have arisen
through the same mechanism. Although, disruptive selection seems to explain the divergence of the two lineages of
E. flexuosa, hybridization is also another plausible mechanism to cause diversification in marine taxa.
Hybridization is a common phenomenon in plants and
the rise of new lineages due to reticulations is often
reported in flowering plants [41,78]. In the marine environment, there are instances of hybridization in angelfishes [79], cichlids [80], blue mussels [81] and corals [8284], suggesting that hybridization is an important evolutionary mechanism for speciation. Nonetheless, it is often
assumed that discrepancies in gene phylogenies or FST statistics from different molecular markers is interpreted as
incomplete lineage sorting, rather than reticulations as it
is interpreted often in plants [41,78]. The phenomenon of
reticulate evolution may have great influence in the speciation of marine species especially those living in sympatry
with high potential for hybridization (e.g., spawners).
Veron [43] has provided a theoretical framework to consider reticulate evolution as an important factor of coral
evolution. Direct measures of chromosome differences
established in Acropora [85], genetic surveys of the nuclear
genome of corals [83,84,86] and direct crosses of gametes
[82] have shown introgression in natural populations. In
E. flexuosa, the two uncovered lineages may have arisen by
hybridization between the common form of E. flexuosa
with another Eunicea or Plexauraspecies. Furthermore,
hybrid fitness may increase over parent fitness in novel
environment or in extreme habitats. Hybrids tend to
explore novel habitats avoiding introgression and competition with their parents [87,88]. Therefore, it is likely that
the lineage related to deep muddy areas is of hybrid origin
and is better adapted to such conditions than the parental
species.

Conclusion
The accepted description sensu Bayer [46] of E. flexuosa is
a complex of at least two distinct genetic lineages, adapted
to different habitats and that do not exchange genetic
material despite living in sympatry. The present study
highlights the importance of correctly defining species,
because the unknowingly use of species complexes can
overestimate geographical distribution, population abundance, and physiological tolerance. The non-random distribution of both morphotypes can yield misleading
population genetic inferences in the absence of adequate
taxonomy. Consequently, decisions based on these estimates will have repercussions in conservation programs
[32]. Detailed studies of the mechanism by which anthozoans achieve assortative mating and become reproduc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/47

tively isolated would give us insights in the speciation
process. Also, cross fertilization experiments, genetic
assessment of shared alleles through genetic markers and
karyotyping may shed light on the speciation process via
hybridization. Reticulations are common in plants, a
group that resembles most of the ecological aspects (bet
hedging strategies, modular organization, philopatric
recruitment, etc.) that govern marine modular organisms.

Methods
The Species
Formerly known as Plexaura flexuosa, the species has been
recently placed into the genus Eunicea based on molecular
data and the size ratio of spindles and clubs [89]. Eunicea
flexuosa is an octocoral cnidarian forming colonies of ~1
m in height found in coral reefs and tropical rocky walls
[46,49,90]. Eunicea flexuosa is relatively abundant in low
relief hard ground habitats with preference for high water
motion areas [48,49]. The distribution of the species
spans through several environmental gradients (e.g.,
depth, light, water motion and sediment transport) [90]
and display an unusual amount of morphological variability. Eunicea flexuosa is a gonochoric gorgonian that
reproduces sexually by spawning gametes [91]. Asexual
reproduction through fragmentation can also take place
when loose branches spread to the surroundings (< 10 m)
and new colonies develop from clone-mate propagules
but is not as common as in P. kuna [92]. The colony is produced by the asexual budding of its polyps, generating a
branching dichotomous morphology, arranged in an axial
skeleton of fused sclerites of calcium carbonate [46].
Adult colonies exhibited bush-like shape and branch profusely in a single plane. Microscopically, the apertures
(calices) present an inconspicuous lower lip with an
unarmed collaret. Sclerites are arranged in three layers.
The axial sheath is made up of fused capstans usually purple and ≤ 200 μm in length. The external layer contains
leaf clubs of ~200 μm with 3 or 4 serrate folia and structural spindles (~2000 μm in length) are disposed in a mid
layer [46]. The last two features distinguish the species
from the other plexaurids. For both P. homomalla and P.
nina the leaf clubs and spindles are smaller (150 μm and
700 μm, respectively), spindles are also more slender and
calyces usually exerted in P. nina (Bayer 1961). Contrary
to P. homomalla, colonies of E. flexuosa in the field usually
tend to be branched in one plane but not in a net-like
shape with calyces as a lower lip. All colonies sampled at
different depths and reefs fell within the original description of Eunicea flexuosa (sensu Bayer 1961, modified by
Grajales et al. 2007). None of the colonies exhibited
prominent and well developed calyces, typical of other
Eunicea species.

The Environment
The study was carried out in La Parguera southwest Puerto
Rico (Table 6) during September 2004 to August 2006.
The hydrography of the area has been studied and
described elsewhere [93]. Reefs off La Parguera are
exposed to wave action, generated by the easterly trade
winds. The shallow (< 10 m) benthic community is visually dominated by octocorals, forming colourful gardens,
especially in shallow reef platforms with high water
motion and wave energy. The current abundance of gorgonians may have been enhanced by the die off of the herbivorous sea urchin Diadema antillarum [62]. La Parguera
is composed by three prominent reef formations, located
parallel to the shoreline: 1) inshore reefs which are more
protected to waves and currents, but subjected to higher
sedimentation rates, direct contact with sewage discharges
and lower scleractinian cover, 2) mid reefs and 3) outer
reefs which are fully exposed to wave energy, with higher
coral cover and significant bottom relief.

Gorgonian colonies were sampled in seven reefs for morphological measurements (Table 6). Three inshore, protected reefs (Conservas, Pelotas and Romeo); two midshelf reefs exposed to wave action (Media Luna and Turrumote) and two outer-shelf reefs (El Hoyo and Weinberg) were included. In each site, morphological
variability of E. flexuosa was assessed at two depths (shallow < 5 m and deep > 17 m), except in the outer reefs El
Hoyo and Weinberg, which are at depth 23–27 m. Therefore, in most reefs there are two depths, except the outer
reefs. In each location, 15 colonies were sampled (n = 30/
reef).
Natural Variability of Morphological Traits
Three macro-morphological traits: colony height (CH),
branch thickness (BT) and branch development (BD)

were measured in 180 colonies, representing fifteen colonies per location (7 reefs per 2 depths, except El Hoyo and
Weinberg which represent deep habitats). Branch development was assessed as the total number of terminal
branches (Fig. 7b) and the average length of 10 haphazardly chosen branches from branch tip to the first node in
terminal branches (Fig. 7b).
Nine microscopic characters from the same 180 colonies
were measured at 2 cm off the tip to avoid measuring
underdeveloped sclerites because new tissue is generated
at the tips and contains higher number of smaller sclerites,
especially in the spindle width and length [94]. Two cm
off the branch tip was far enough to avoid smaller, underdeveloped sclerites, but within the range in which the new
tissue would be generated under the novel environmental
conditions during the reciprocal transplant experiment.
Polyp density (PD), calice diameter (CD), inter-calice distance (ID) and width and length of external clubs (CW
and CL) mid-layer spindles (SW and SL) and axial sheath
capstans (CAW and CAL) were selected for the analysis
(Fig. 7). Polyp density was estimated by counting the
number of polyps/cm2 and standardized with branch
thickness, assuming cylindrical shape of the branches. In
these micro-morphological traits, 20 measurements
(except polyp density) were performed in randomly
selected calices in CD and ID or sclerites in CW, CL, SW,
SL, CAW and CAL; representing 300 measurements per
depth, 600 per reef, 3,600 per character and 28,800 in
total, excluding polyp density measures. Octocoral
branches were collected by clipping off a 5 cm section at
the branch tip, slightly bleached with Clorox (5%) to
remove some tissue, rinsed in distilled water, and dried.
The slight bleaching kept the colony shape intact, avoiding colony dissolution while allowing clear observations
of the calices. For sclerite analysis 1 cm section at 2 cm

from the tip was collected and dissolved with Clorox
(5%), following Bayer's protocol [46]. For clubs and capstans the samples were taken by placing the spicules in
slides and random samples were obtained by moving
blindly the slide and measuring all sclerites in each new
visual field until 20 sclerites were measured. Spindle, calice and polyp were analyzed by photographing the characters with an Olympus BX-51 compound microscope. All
measurements were carried out using photographs (calibrated with a slide of 10 μm accuracy) taken with an
Olympus C-5050 camera system attached to an Olympus

SZH-10 stereo microscope. Analysis of the photos was
performed using SigmaScan (SPSS Inc.).
The extent of variation among habitats (i.e., PS, PD) in
morphological traits (14) was analyzed by individual
One-way ANOVAs. Principal component analysis (PCA)
was applied to test the association of the traits and visually
examine overall trends, the analysis was done with both
raw and standardized (in a 0 to 1 scale) data. The PCA
scores of the first three principal components were used to
test for differences among groups and factor interactions

in a two-way ANOVA. The two factors were degree of protection (zone) and depth (< 5 m and < 17 m). Reefs were
nested within zones and depth was factorial with reefs.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene's test were used to test
for normality and homogeneity of variance, respectively
[95]. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) of 14 morphological characters (CH, BT, BD, PD, CD, ID, CW, CL,
SW, SL, CAW and CAL, Fig. 7) was used to explore if colonies could be assigned independently to one of the two
resulting morphotypes and replicate the same predetermined groups in the sampled populations (i.e., inner
zone, mid zone, shallow and deep). Wilk's λ was used in
the DFA to test for multivariate differences among groups
[96]. Individual DFA's were employed for depth, location
and zone.

were introduced to the novel habitat, the survivorship and
linear growth were used to evaluate the overall colony
response in each treatment. Linear growth was measured
from base to tip of the colony and survivorship was
recorded as live or dead. Branch thickness and polyp density could also reflect phenotypic plasticity but these
parameters were not measured because detectable variation requires a longer experimental time due to the slow
growth (~3 cm y-1) of E. flexuosa.

Transplant Experiment
If reciprocally transplanted colonies become similar in
sclerite size to the neighbouring colonies, the environment is likely to have an effect on the phenotype. As gorgonian growth is slow (< 3 cm a year; Yoshioka unpub.
data) only sclerite related traits were evaluated. We examined the subapical parts of branches of transplanted gorgonians because this is where new spicules and skeleton
material are generated. By avoiding the sampling of tips
no underdeveloped sclerites were counted [94].

Linear growth of the transplanted colonies was assessed
by subtracting the initial length from the final length. A
two-way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in
population (colonies from shallow and deep areas) and
depth (colonies grew in shallow and deep environments)
and their interactions. Both factors were considered fixed
effects. Chi-square analysis on the number of dead colonies was used to test for survivorship independence
among groups. To check for environmental effects on the
groups, morphological trends were visually examined by
graphing the reaction norm through time per group per
trait. Repetitive measurement ANOVAs were used to test
the effect of population and time and their interaction.
ANOVA assumptions were evaluated as previously
described. All statistical analyses were performed in JMP
ver 5.0.1, InfoStat ver. 2004, and SigmaStat.

To test for eco-phenotypic responses of the species to different depth habitats, thirty branches (< 30 cm) of different colonies separated by >10 m from each other, from
each depth were reciprocally transplanted in Media Luna
reef. Additionally, 15 branches from each of the two
depths were auto-transplanted (transplanted to the same
depth) to serve as controls. In each depth, 45 branches
were transplanted per depth. Fifteen of them were residents and 30 were introduced from either the shallow or
the deep habitat, for a total of 90 colonies in the experiment. Each branch was glued into a short piece of plastic
PVC pipe with marine hydraulic cement. The cement did
not affect the octocoral growth, as live tissue quickly overgrew the dried cement; the same material has been successfully used in restoration of gorgonian populations
(Yoshioka et al. unpub. data). Each of the plastic pipes
was attached to a 1.5 × 1 m cement panel. Fifteen
branches were randomly assigned in each cement panel
(allowing enough distance to avoid conspecific aggressions) and three panels were placed per depth (45 colonies per depth) separated by 5 m from each other. Each
branch was assigned a code and individually tagged on
the panels. The same code was also used for genetic analysis. The experiments were monitored every month to
remove fouling organisms and sediment from the panels.
Three times during the 15 months of the study (once every
five months) surveys were carried out and linear growth
and survivorship recorded. As the transplanted colonies

Genetic Analysis
Portions of msh1 and the 18S genes were sequenced to test
for genetic differentiation among populations of E. flexuosa living in different depths and reefs (Media Luna,
Romero and Isla Culebra) in Puerto Rico. Msh1 is a mitochondrial gene unique to octocorals that codes for a DNA
mismatch repair protein and is not present in other Cnidaria [97]. Msh1 and the nuclear 18S provide enough resolution to discriminate between closely related species of
octocorals [63,64]. Segments of msh1 and 18S genes of all
transplanted colonies in the eco-phenotypic experiment
were examined, 90 colonies in total (45 individuals for
each depth habitat). Additional samples from Romero
and Culebra were included in the analysis to test the
reproducibility of the preliminary results found in Media
Luna. Thirty one colonies from Romero and 21 colonies
from Culebra were included for the msh1 analysis. Thirty
two colonies from Romero and 21 from Culebra were
included for the 18S analysis. A 3 to 5 cm colony fragment
was brought to the laboratory for immediate DNA extraction or stored in 95% ethanol for subsequent work. The
PureGene DNA isolation kit (Gentra) was used for DNA
extraction. The PCR amplifications was performed in an
Eppendorf MasterCycler with the same cycling conditions
for both genes, consisted of an initial denaturation at
95°C for 3 min, followed by a touch-down routine of
annealing of 10 cycles at 43°C of 45 sec and 25 cycles at
48°C of 45 sec; denaturation at 94°C for 45 sec and elon-

gation at 72°C for 5 min. The primers used to amplify 18S
(A18S – 5'-GATCGAACGGTTTAGTGAGG-3' and ITS-4 –
5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') and msh1 were developed by Takabayashi [98] and France and Hoover [99],
respectively. Sequencing reactions were prepared with a
DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (GE) and
loaded in a MEGABase 96 lane Sequencer for capillary
electrophoresis.
DNA sequencing trace files were imported into the Phrap/
Phred/Consed programs [100] for base calling, quality
assessment, assembly and visualization. Mutations were
verified in both the forward and reverse direction.
Sequences were then aligned in MacClade [101] and compared with BLAST to publicly available sequences of
closely related gorgonians. The haplotype (h) and the
nucleotide diversity (π), number of segregating sites (S),
the Watterson's estimator (θw) were evaluated according
to Nei [102] as implemented in DNAsp 4.0 [103].
Tajima's D [104] and Fu's Fs [105] were used in ARLEQUIN [106] to test for deviations from neutrality. A parsimony haplotype network was constructed for the msh1
sequences using the Templeton et al. [107] algorithm as
implemented in TCS version 1.21 [108]. The parsimony
network was constructed with confidence level set at 95%.
Analysis of molecular variation [AMOVA, [109]] of
among reefs, between habitats and between morphotypes
was performed in ARLEQUIN. The AMOVAs were performed with 10,000 permutations by using conventional
F-statistics with haplotype frequencies.

Gene genealogies were constructed for msh1 and 18S
using the maximum likelihood (ML) method in PAUP*
[110]. Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests in MODELTEST
3.6 [111] suggested that the HKY [112] and JC models
were the best substitution models for msh1 and 18S,
respectively. For the heuristic searches in ML, data were
bootstrapped 100 times, and sequences were added randomly ten times. Phylogenetic relationships were also
constructed using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony with 1000 bootstrap replicates as implemented in
PAUP*. Given the uncertain phylogenetic position of E.
flexuosa and its conspecifics [64], several outgroups were
used, including P. homomalla, Muricea muricata and Eunicea spp. Regardless the outgroup, identical topologies
were obtained. All sequences have been deposited in
GenBank (Accession numbers EF659469-EF659598 and
