Signatures of positive selection in Toll-like
receptor (TLR) genes in mammals
Helena Areal1,2, Joana Abrantes1,3 and Pedro J Esteves1,4*

Abstract
Background: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in the
cell surface or membrane compartments of immune and non-immune cells. TLRs are encoded by a multigene
family and represent the first line of defense against pathogens by detecting foreigner microbial molecular motifs,
the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs are also important by triggering the adaptive immunity
in vertebrates. They are characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the ectodomain, which are
associated with the PAMPs recognition. The direct recognition of different pathogens by TLRs might result in
different evolutionary adaptations important to understand the dynamics of the host-pathogen interplay. Ten
mammal TLR genes, viral (TLR3, 7, 8, 9) and non-viral (TLR1-6, 10), were selected to identify signatures of positive
selection that might have been imposed by interacting pathogens and to clarify if viral and non-viral TLRs might
display different patterns of molecular evolution.
Results: By using Maximum Likelihood approaches, evidence of positive selection was found in all the TLRs studied.
The number of positively selected codons (PSC) ranged between 2-26 codons (0.25%-2.65%) with the non-viral TLR4 as
the receptor with higher percentage of positively selected codons (2.65%), followed by the viral TLR8 (2.50%). The
results indicated that viral and non-viral TLRs are similarly under positive selection. Almost all TLRs have at least one PSC
located in the LRR ectodomain which underlies the importance of the pathogen recognition by this region.
Conclusions: Our results are not in line with previous studies on primates and birds that identified more codons under
positive selection in non-viral TLRs. This might be explained by the fact that both primates and birds are homogeneous
groups probably being affected by only a restricted number of related viruses with equivalent motifs to be recognized.
The analyses performed in this work encompassed a large number of species covering some of the most representative
mammalian groups - Artiodactyla, Rodents, Carnivores, Lagomorphs and Primates - that are affected by different
families of viruses. This might explain the role of adaptive evolution in shaping viral TLR genes.

Background
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) in Drosophila and in mammals. Mammalian TLRs have essential roles in recognizing
infectious agents and initiating intracellular signal transduction pathways that trigger the expression of genes leading to both innate and adaptive immune responses [1,2].
TLRs belong to the type I transmembrane glycoprotein

receptor family and can be expressed either in the cell surface or membrane compartments of immune and nonimmune cells (e.g. epithelial cells) [3,4].
Thirteen TLRs have been identified to date of which 10
members are present in the human genome (TLR1-10)
and thirteen in rodents (TLR1-13) [5]. According to their
structure, phylogenetic position and class of microbial
compound that they recognize, vertebrate TLRs can be
classified into six subfamilies: the TLR1 subfamily encompasses TLR1, 2, 6 and 10; the TLR9 subfamily includes
TLR7, 8 and 9; TLR11, 12 and 13 constitute the subfamily
TLR11 and TLR3, TLR4 and TLR5 each form a subfamily
[6,7]. TLRs can be also classified into non-viral (TLR1, 2,

4, 5, 6, 10) and viral TLRs (TLR3, 7, 8, 9) with respect to
their ligand recognition [8-10].
The TLR family is structurally characterized by the presence of an ectodomain, a signal transmembrane segment
and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain homologous
to the human interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) and human
IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and designated TIR domain
[11,12]. Crystallographic studies of the ectodomain
revealed a solenoid horseshoe-like structure constituted by
a high but variable number (16-28) of leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) responsible for binding the “pathogen associated
molecular patterns” (PAMPs). PAMPs are present in
pathogens and not in host components, thus allowing the
innate immune system to distinguish between what is self
and what is non-self [13]. Nevertheless, TLRs not only
sense microbial components but they can also target endogenous molecules that have resulted from host dying cells
and which can activate the inflammatory response [14,15].
PAMPs are characteristic molecular signatures of the
pathogens, highly conserved during evolution since they
are involved in critical functions and are essential for survival of the pathogens. Indeed, mutations or loss of these
patterns can be lethal to the pathogens and therefore are
quite conserved [13]. This means that a limited number of
PRRs is needed to detect the presence of an infection [13].
Their main recognition molecules, the LRRs, are capped
in the amino and carboxy termini by LRR-NT and LRRCT molecules, respectively [16,17], that stabilize the protein structure by protecting the hydrophobic core from
exposure to solvent [18]. Delimitation of these domains is,
however, not consensual among the different software
programs used for their determination [19,20]. For some
TLRs crystallographic models have been made available
where these domains are well defined (e.g. the TLR1/
TLR2, TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers, TLR3 and TLR4 of
Homo sapiens and of Mus musculus [16,17,21-23]). However, this is not the case for all species which further complicates the correct delimitation of each domain.
Upon PAMPs recognition, TLRs dimerize leading to the
recruitment of the adaptor proteins (e.g. MyD88, TRIF)
and triggering signaling pathways of the innate immune
response (reviewed in [24]). TLR1/TLR2 and TLR2/TLR6
exist as heterodimers on the cell surface and detect bacterial triacylated and diacylated lipoproteins, respectively [25].
Also on the cell surface, TLR4 and TLR5 detect lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial flagellin, correspondingly
[25]. TLR10 seems to heterodimerize with TLR2 to also
recognize triacyl lipoproteins [26,27]. On the other hand,
TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 are expressed on endosomes and detect
microbial nucleic acids [4,10,28] with TLR3 being associated with the recognition of double-strand RNA
(dsRNA) [29], while TLR7 and 8 target viral components
such as single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and TLR9 respond to
double-strand DNA viruses (dsDNA) and bacteria by

recognizing non-methylated CpG-containing DNA
[10,30].
TLRs are evolutionary conserved proteins and their
characterization and of their ligands has contributed to
the understanding of the function of the TLRs and to the
host defense processes against infections [31]. They are
candidate molecules to examine how natural selection
molds innate immunity receptors. Several studies have
been performed and purifying selection was suggested as
the major force driving TLRs evolution, at least in humans
[32,33]. However, other studies on Primate species
revealed different degrees of positive selection acting on
their evolutionary history. Evidence of positive selection
was found in TLR1 [34] and TLR4 [35]. In a broader study
in a primate group, Wlasiuk and Nachman (2010) showed
evidence of positive selection in six TLR genes, TLR1,
TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, with the non-viral
TLR4 having the highest number of positively selected
codons (PSC). A study performed by Alcaide and Edwards
(2011) in birds showed evidence of positive selection in
TLR4. The most recent analysis of the TLR1 subfamily
showed evidence of positive selection in TLR1, 2 and 6 in
mammals and TLR2A/B in birds [36]. Overall, these studies also showed that non-viral TLRs tend to be more
prone to positive selection than viral TLRs. From an evolutionary point of view, proteins involved in direct recognition of pathogens might have been shaped by these
interactions. Here, we have studied ten mammal TLR
genes in order to look for evidence of positive selection
and to further clarify if viral and non-viral TLRs display
different patterns of molecular evolution due to the different nature of the PAMPs they recognize.

Results and Discussion
Signatures of positive selection

Genes of the immune system, in particular those involved
in the recognition of pathogens, and genes involved in the
host-pathogen interaction have been shown to be highly
prone to adaptive selection (e.g. [37,38]). By using Maximum-Likelihood (ML) approaches, evidence of positive
selection was detected in all the TLRs studied (Table 1).
For seven of the TLRs (TLR1-6, TLR10), analyses included
species belonging to some of the most representative
mammalian groups, i.e. Artiodactyla, Rodents, Carnivores,
Lagomorphs and Primates, while for the remaining three
TLRs, the Lagomorph group was not included due to the
lack of data (Additional file 1, Table S1; Additional file 2,
Table S2; Additional file 3, Table S3; Additional file 4,
Table S4; Additional file 5, Table S5; Additional file 6,
Table S6; Additional file 7, Table S7; Additional file 8,
Table S8; Additional file 9, Table S9; Additional file 10,
Table S10).
The number of positively selected codons observed for
each TLR studied ranged between 2-26 which

corresponded to 0.25%-2.65% of codons under positive
selection. The non-viral TLR4 was the receptor with the
highest proportion of PSC (22 positions, 2.65%), followed by the viral TLR8 (26 positions, 2.50%). Description of the amino acids present in each species for each
site under positive selection and their location in the
receptors can be found in Additional file 11, Table S11;
Additional file 12, Table S12; Additional file 13, Table
S13; Additional file 14, Table S14; Additional file 15,
Table S15; Additional file 16, Table S16; Additional file
17, Table S17; Additional file 18, Table S18; Additional
file 19, Table S19; Additional file 20, Table S20. Previous studies argued that viral TLRs are under a stronger purifying selection than non-viral TLRs [33,39,40]
since viral TLRs recognize viral nucleic acids but also
target self components [1,2,41]. Therefore, these TLRs
have the dual role of maintaining their function and
avoid autoimmunity, and so they are not expected to
accumulate non-synonymous substitutions as this might
affect their functional integrity. On the other hand, nonviral TLRs that exist on the cell surface have a more
flexible evolution and easily tolerate non-synonymous
mutations which, in some circumstances, can be subject
to positive selection and become fixed in some populations [33]. This higher tolerance is because the function
of non-viral TLRs is more redundant than of viral TLRs.
Indeed, several surface TLRs are able to recognize the
same bacteria and fungi components, so one microorganism can be recognized by different TLRs. Therefore,
a non-synonymous mutation in one TLR does not
necessarily mean the extinction of the function and does
not compromise immunity [33].
The viral TLR8 has never been identified as a candidate
for being under positive selection; however, our results
indicate a similar level of positive selection acting in
TLR8 as in the non-viral TLR4. This might be the result
of the inclusion of a larger group of species that might be
affected by different pathogens with implications in their
PAMPs recognition. Indeed, the groups previously analyzed by others are homogeneous probably being affected
by only a restricted number of related viruses which
accounts for their conservation. In addition, the presence
of the positive selection signature may not mean a recent
event but could result from ancient functional adaptations from each species that lead to the actual taxon specificities [42]. Furthermore, as the recognition of viral
RNA is essential for host defense, the mutations that
could affect the function should have been removed by
purifying selection and then, only the polymorphisms
that are advantageous, i.e. that confer resistance to the
pathogen, might have become fixed and are now reflected
in the differences between species [43].
The high number of PSC observed in the non-viral
TLR4 is in line with results previously reported in

Page 4 of 14

primates and birds [39,40]. TLR8 and TLR4 recognize
very different ligands. For PAMPs recognition, TLR8
forms a homodimer that is associated with response to
ssRNA viruses while the TLR4-MD-2 heterodimer mostly
recognizes LPS that are present in the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria [13,44]. In addition, TLR4 also targets components of yeast, trypanossoma and even viruses
[45]. Despite this, the reason why these two TLRs have a
remarkable picture of adaptive evolution is not yet clearly
understood. Some recent studies showed that in different
species, the same TLR molecule recognizes specific ligands
or that the same ligand triggers responses with different
intensities (reviewed in [46]). For example, in rodent species, TLR8 does not respond to synthetic ligands such as
imiquimod (R837), resiquimod (R848), and some guanine
nucleotide analogs, as non-rodent species do [47]. This is
probably caused by the variation in the surface charge and
the existence of different secondary structures in different
species. In addition, for TLR4, differences in ligand recognition between humans, bovines, equines and murines
have also been described (reviewed in [46]). Although
more studies are required to fully assess the specificity of
ligand recognition and the responses that are triggered in
each species, this might explain the similar patterns of
evolution observed for these TLRs. The reason for the difference observed between the number of PSC in TLR7
(0.67%) and TLR8 (2.50%) is also unclear since both recognize ssRNA. A similar degree of positive selection acting in
both receptors would be expected. Functional or structural
differences in ligand recognition or in ligand specificity
should be at the basis of the observed differences. Structural differences do exist in ligand recognition, but more
studies are required. Indeed, TLR8 and TLR9 exist as preformed dimers while TLR7, along with the others TLRs,
exists as monomer and just form the dimer after ligand
binding [48]. Differences in tissue expression have also
been observed which might account for the different pattern. Although both TLR7 and TLR8 are expressed in the
lung, TLR7 is also expressed in the placenta and spleen
while TLR8 is expressed also in peripheral blood leukocytes [49].
TLR1, TLR6 and TLR9 were the receptors with the
lower percentage of codons under positive selection
(Table 1). TLR1 has been shown to be mostly under purifying selection, but it has previously been shown to have
also been subject to positive selection in chicken, contrary to the remaining avian TLRs [50], and more
recently four PSC were found in the vertebrates [36]. The
study of Huang and co-workers also showed evidence of
one PSC in vertebrate TLR6 which was the first report of
adaptive selection acting on this receptor now further
supported by the present study. TLR9 has also low proportion of PSC (0.39%), but positive selection has been
previously found in Primates [40] and Teleosts [51].

Seven codons were found to be under positive selection in TLR10. The study of Huang and co-workers
revealed no positive selection on TLR10 [36]. Their analyses of TLR10 encompassed sixteen species, including a
marsupial, a monotreme and an amphibian, which were
not included in our study. In addition, their analyses
only focused on PAML (CODEML) results whether ours
also included the different models implemented in the
Data Monkey Web Server which might explain the difference observed.
The TLR10 interacts with TLR2 to recognize triacyl
lipoproteins [26,27]. In turn, TLR2 also form heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize the largest variety
of ligands of all the TLRs (e.g. peptidoglycan, bacterial
lipoproteins, zymosan, a phenol soluble factor from Staphylococcus epidermidis) [52]. In TLR2, six codons were
found under positive selection in mammals, in line with
the observation of Huang and co-workers (2011). Signatures of positive selection in this gene were also found in
bovines [42], primates [53], rodents [54] and in birds
[55]. The wide range of ligands as well as the need for
heterodimerization (TLR1-TLR2, TLR2-TLR6, TLR6TLR10) make the TLR2 prone to contrasting evolutionary patterns: conservation of its function, including the
capacity of heterodimerization, and adaptive evolution to
the environment and the pathogens specific from each
species [6,36,42].
Location and characterization of the PSC in the TLR
domains

The LRRfinder software [20] was used to delimitate the
functional domains of each TLR gene in order to assess

Human TLR sequences were used as a reference (Table 2
and Additional file 21, Table S21; Additional file 22,

Table S22; Additional file 23, Table S23; Additional file
24, Table S24; Additional file 25, Table S25; Additional
file 26, Table S26; Additional file 27, Table S27; Additional file 28, Table S28; Additional file 29, Table S29;
Additional file 30, Table S30). The characterization of the
charge and polarity of each amino acid possibility in sites
under selection is also available in Additional file 31,
Table S31; Additional file 32, Table S32; Additional file
33, Table S33; Additional file 34, Table S34; Additional

Additional file 39, Table S39; Additional file 40, Table
S40.
The TLRs are composed of an extracellular domain
that binds the PAMPs, a signal transmembrane domain
and an intracellular domain, designated the TIR domain
that binds adapter molecules and that triggers the intracellular cascades leading to the innate immune response.
The convex surface of the extracellular LRR domains, by
being involved in the recognition of the PAMPs, is
highly variable. At variance, the TIR domain is highly
conserved as it is involved in the signaling cascades [56].
This suggests that the different domains of the TLR
molecules are under different evolutionary pressures.
Most positively selected sites were located in the extracellular LRRs. A few instances of positive selection were
detected in the remaining domains. All TLRs, with the
exception of TLR6, have at least one codon under positive selection located in the LRR ectodomain and most of
the PSC found within each TLR are mostly located in
this domain (Table 2). The LRR ectodomain is the main
point of interaction with PAMPs [11,57], which are conserved motifs [13]. Therefore, some functional constrain
is expected in order to preserve the TLR ability in identifying pathogens. However, as pathogens are evolving

constantly to evade host recognition, it is likely that TLRs
should co-evolve with them. Our results suggest that this
constant evolving nature of pathogens is accompanied by
TLRs. Some species-specific substitutions may be
reflected on the high number of PSC found in this
domain. This could be related to the PAMPs they
recognize.
In general, the LRRs are composed by a concave surface, more conservative, composed by a leucine-rich
sequence, XLXXLXLXX, and by a convex surface, more
exposed and more variable, XFXXFX4FXXLX, where X
represents any amino acid and F a hydrophobic amino
acid. Of the seventy one codons identified under positive
selection in the LRRs of all TLRs, forty eight were localized in the variable segment which supports our hypothesis of co-evolution between host and pathogen (Table 2
and Additional file 21, Table S21; Additional file 22,
Table S22; Additional file 23, Table S23; Additional file
24, Table S24; Additional file 25, Table S25; Additional
file 26, Table S26; Additional file 27, Table S27; Additional file 28, Table S28; Additional file 29, Table S29;
Additional file 30, Table S30). Interestingly, the three
TLRs with more PSC in variable segment of LRRs are the
viral TLR7, 8 and 9, with 71.43%, 84.0% and 75.0%,
respectively. This high proportion of PSC in the variable
segment of LRRs found in three viral TLRs may be indicative of the receptors’ evolution shaped by viral nucleic
acids (ssRNA and CpG DNA) characteristic from each
species. As nucleic acids are supposed to directly interact
with this convex surface, variation or evidence of positive
selection in it may be the result of host adaptation to
viral evolution.
The two receptors with more signatures of natural selection, TLR8 and TLR4, showed a large number of PSC in
the LRR domain, even though ligand recognition is made
differently [25]. Along with TLR7 and 9, TLR8 has a
longer amino acid sequence in its ectodomain domain
than other TLRs and contains an irregular segment of 26
to 31 amino acids between LRR14 and 15 [18]. The ectodomain is cleaved in the endolysosome to enable ligand
recognition [18,58]. Thus, the functional ectodomain of
human TLR8 comprises LRR15-25 and C-terminal LRR.
Following ligand binding, TLR8 recruits the TIR adaptor
proteins and initiates signaling [58]. Our results show that
fifteen of the PSC are located in the region comprising
LRR-NT-LRR14 that is cleaved. Four amino acids are
located to the irregular LRR insertion before LRR15
(Table 3); however the functional importance of this
region has not yet been clarified and is regarded as a new
N-terminal LRR of the truncated structure [58]. Recently,
it has also been described for its crucial importance in
TLR8 activation, especially the Alanine substitutions in
this region that can affect the activation of this receptor
[47]. Alanine at the amino acid position 481 that was

Page 6 of 14

found to be under selective pressure may be interesting to
study in greater detail. Furthermore, Govindaraj et al.
(2011) proposed that this undefined region is responsible
for the species-specificity in ligand recognition that is
found at least between non-rodents and rodents (rodents
lack the undefined region 438-442) [47]. The surface
charge variation among species is crucial for the species
specific pathogen recognition even though this region is
not directly involved in ligand interaction [47]. In all four
positions identified under selection in this irregular insertion, the amino acid possibilities may result in charge variation which might suggest a role for the specificity in
ligand recognition (Additional file 38, Table S38). Of the
other eight residues identified in this molecule, only one is
in LRR15. LRR15 has been described for its importance in
ligand recognition together with LRR17 and 18 (Table 3)
[58].
The TLR4 forms a dimer with MD-2. The LPS interacts
with a large hydrophobic pocket in MD-2 and directly
bridges m-shaped receptor dimer composed of two copies
arranged symmetrically [23]. Nineteen of the twenty two
PSC in the TLR4 are located in the LRR domain. At least
six of these codons have been previously identified as sites
under positive selection in primates [40] and some have
functional importance in PAMP recognition (Table 3)
[23]. From the three-dimensional structure of the TLR4
heterodimer (Figure 1), it is possible to observe that some
of the positively selected residues identified in this molecule are in the region that participates in the interaction
between TLR4, MD-2 and LPS (codons 300, 301, 317, 319,
356, and 363). In all those positions, with the exception of
position 356 where the three amino acid possibilities (Leu,
Phe, Trp) are all conservative, amino acid substitutions
might result in changes in polarity and charge (Additional
file 34, Table S34). Nevertheless, the result of these variations in the function and structure of the molecule
remains to be assessed. In addition, some of the identified
PSC are located in close contact in the TLR4 homodimers
(eg. 370, 394, 468, 471, 487, 542) and might have implications for dimerization.
In TLR2, three PSC lay in LRR5, 6 and 10. The LRR10
PSC is in the variable segment and this LRR has been previously described as under positive selection in bovines
[42]. Despite that, these LRRs have not been recognized as
sites of direct interaction with PAMPs neither involved in
heterodimerization, so this result may not necessarily
reflect any present functional importance but the result of
ancient selective events [42]. In the heterodimers TLR1TLR2 (Figure 2) and TLR2-TLR6 (Figure 3) only one of
the identified amino acids (302 in LRR10 of the TLR2) are
located in significant regions for ligand binding (LRR9LRR12) and one (318 in TLR1) in close proximity with
sites involved in heterodimerization (LRR11-LRR14)
(Table 3) [16]. It is interesting to note that in TLR2, the

regions identified as important for dimerization (LRR1113) have not been subject to positive selection, which is a
trace of functional conservation, particularly important as
TLR2 dimerizes with three other TLRs to recognize different PAMPs [16,42].
In the viral TLR3, nine PSC were identified, 3 of
which are located in the LRR domain (Figure 4). The
residue 79 belongs to a dsRNA-TLR3 interaction site in
the LRR-NT to LRR3 region (Table 3) [22]. In this site,
five amino acid possibilities were detected along the species studied which could be a species adaptation to the
recognition of specific dsRNA viruses and reflect coevolution.
For the TLR5, three PSC were detected in the LRR
domain. The residues 207 and 400 are located within the
228 amino acid region identified by Andersen-Nissen et al
(2007) as important for flagellin recognition [59] and were
previously reported as being under positive selection in
primates [60].
The TIR domain of the TLRs is highly conserved
across multiple species of animals, plants [61] and
microbes [62] due to its significance as signaling domain
[63]. Three Box regions of the TIR domain, which are

important in signal transduction, are highly conserved
in the TLRs genes (Boxes 1, 2, and 3) and should be
rather under a strong purifying selection [63,64]. As
expected, due to their functional constraints, we verified
that none of the nine sites identified as under positive
selection in the TIR domain were located in these
boxes. This observation is expected as these boxes, due
to their functional constraints, should be rather under a
strong purifying selection [63,64].
The TLR with more PSC in the TIR domain was TLR5
where three codons under selection were located within
the highly conserved TIR domain and although amino
acid alterations at codon 674 are conservative, alterations
at codons 721 and 742 might induce differences in charge
and polarity of the protein, respectively (Additional file
35, Table S35). Despite the expected functional constraints specific of this domain, it seems that the TLR5
protein may present some flexibility with regards to
amino acid composition in this domain. In human, TLR5
has been suggested to be functionally redundant. Indeed,
TLR5392STOP is a non-functional allele that may reach
considerable frequencies in some human populations (up
to 23%; [65]) despite increasing the susceptibility to the

Legionnaires’ disease. Positive selection has been proposed as a mechanism for favoring gene loss in human
evolution [66,67]. This suggests that other proteins exist,
yet to be determined, that might be able to compensate
for a loss of function of this TLR.
In the remaining domains a few PSCs were identified
although they can have functional or evolutionary
importance. Indeed, in the signal domain, we identified
five PSCs. This domain mostly mediates or regulates the
transport of the secretory proteins to their destination
compartment in the cell [68]. Given the role of this
domain, it is likely that these five amino acids might
interfere with the correct location of the secretory proteins in the different cell compartments. In the LRRNT domain we identified one PSC in TLR8. This
domain is known for its importance in stabilizing the
LRR structure by protecting the hydrophobic core [18].
However, in the TLR8 molecule this domain is cleaved
along with LRR1-14 to enable ligand recognition [18,58],
thus no particular importance can be attributed. In the
3’ end of the LRR structure we find the LRR-CT where
two PSC were found. The role of this domain is similar
to LRR-NT so these residues might be important for the
stabilization of the molecule in particular for the formation of the dimers TLR4-MD2 and TLR10-TLR2
[18,69]. In the PSC identified in the LRR-CT, amino
acid variation between species does not alter the charge
(Additional file 34, Table S34; Additional file 40, Table
S40). This also happens in all five positions under positive selection in the transmembrane domain of TLR 2,
3, 4 and 6 (Additional file 32, Table S32; Additional file
33, Table S33; Additional file 34, Table S34; Additional
file 36, Table S36). The transmembrane segment is
responsible for the junction between the TLR and the
plasmatic membrane. In some cases, it is also associated
with the localization of the TLR in intracellular compartments and its interaction with accessory molecules
[70,71]. This domain is expected to be highly conserved
and only few mutations have been described [72,73].
Nevertheless, we found five codons under positive selection in this domain.
In summary, pathogens usually develop strategies to
evade recognition by the host immune system. Therefore,
motifs in the pathogen that are involved in the recognition tend to evolve faster to avoid this recognition. If the
pathogen is evolving, the receptor that recognizes the
pathogen should also evolve to keep pace with the
changes that occur in the pathogen. This arms-race is
responsible for this continuum of alterations in both the
pathogen and the receptor which can be detected as signatures of positive selection. For example, positive selection in RNA viruses has been shown to occur as the
result of this arms-race [74,75]. Thus, changes in the
sequence of RNA or DNA of the pathogen will cause the

Page 10 of 14

receptor not to recognize them. This will force alterations in the receptor which might change the geometry
of the interaction. For this reason, if different ligands (i.e.
pathogens) are recognized by one receptor, it is likely
that more changes are observed than for receptors that
recognize only one ligand. In line with this, our results
may reflect the co-evolution between each host and its
pathogens and commensals, especially in viral TLRs (due
to the wide variety of viruses they might recognize) and
in the non-viral TLR4. In addition, the fact that the
mutation rates for RNA and DNA viruses tend to be generally higher than for bacteria and yeast [76] also correlates with our results. Viral TLRs will thus encounter
ligands that evolve faster than non-viral TLR. TLR4
might appear as an exception due to the wide variety of
ligands that it recognizes, which include viruses.

Conclusions
Evidence of positive selection was found for all the mammalian TLRs studied. Adaptive selection has clearly played
a role in shaping the diversity of both viral and non-viral
TLRs. Location of some of the positively selected codons
indicate that pathogens exert most of the selective pressures that lead to the changes observed mostly in the LRR
ectodomain, especially in its variable segment responsible
for direct interaction with PAMPS. This suggests that they
are the result of co-evolution. Further studies are important to clarify the ligand for each TLR in each species as it
could give new clues for the interpretation of these results.
Also, crystallographic studies would be helpful for assessing the functional relevance of the PSCs detected.
Methods
Sequences

The sequences of the mammalian TLRs used in the analyses were retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and Ensembl (http://www.
ensembl.org/index.html). For each TLR, a subset of 1323 species was used, that included species from some of
the most representative mammalian groups, Artiodactyla, Rodents, Carnivores, Lagomorphs and Primates.
Lagomorphs were not included in the TLR7, 8 and 9
analyses due to the lack of data. The identification of
the species used for each TLR and the accession numbers are presented in Additional files (Additional file 1,
Table S1; Additional file 2, Table S2; Additional file 3,
Table S3; Additional file 4, Table S4; Additional file 5,
Table S5; Additional file 6, Table S6; Additional file 7,
Table S7; Additional file 8, Table S8; Additional file 9,
Table S9; Additional file 10, Table S10).
Codon-based analyses of positive selection

Under neutrality, coding sequences are expected to present a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) over

Areal et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/368

synonymous substitutions (dS) that does not significantly
deviate from 1 (ω = dN/dS = 1) while significant deviations may be interpreted as either the result of positive
selection (ω >> 1) or of negative selection (ω << 1).
To test for positive selection in individual codons of
mammalian TLR sequences, the d N to d S ratios were
compared using two maximum likelihood (ML) frameworks, the Hyphy package implemented in the Data
Monkey Web Server (http://www.datamonkey.org[77]
and the CODEML (PAML version 4) [78] as proposed
by Wlasiuk and Nachman (2010).
In the Data Monkey Web Server, the best fitting
nucleotide substitution model was searched for through
the automatic model selection tool available on the server. All sequences of each TLR were analyzed under
three distinct models, single likelihood ancestor counting [64], fixed-effect likelihood (FEL) and random effect
likelihood (REL). The SLAC model is based on the
reconstruction of the ancestral sequences and the counts
of dS, dN at each codon position of the phylogeny. The
FEL model estimates the ratio of dN/dS on a site-by-site
basis, without assuming an a priori distribution across
sites. The REL model first fits a distribution of rates
across sites and then infers the substitution rate for
individual sites. The criteria to identify codons under
positive selection were the same used by Wlasiuk and
Nachman (2010). Sites with P values <0.1 for SLAC and
FEL, and Bayes Factor >50 for REL were considered as
candidates to be under positive selection.
In CODEML, two alternative models M7 and M8
were implemented. M7 only allows codons to evolve
neutrally or under purifying selection while M8 adds a
class of sites under positive selection. The two previous
nested models were compared using the likelihood ratio
test (LRT) with 2 degrees of freedom [79]. Amino acids
under selection for M8 were identified using Bayes
Empirical Bayes approach (BEB) with posterior probability >90%. For each gene, a neighbor-joining tree was
used as the working topology which was constructed
using Mega 5 [80] with the options p-distance as the
substitution model and complete deletion to gaps and
missing data.
In accordance to the methodology adopted in Wlasiuk
and Nachman (2010), only sites identified as under positive selection by more than one ML method were considered. The amino acid possibilities were characterized
with regards to polarity, charge and location in the protein, and are described in the Additional file 31, Table
S31; Additional file 32, Table S32; Additional file 33,

Identification of domains

To determine the delimitation of each of the domains of
the TLR molecules, the LRRfinder software was used
[20] (http://www.lrrfinder.com/). The human delimitations were used as a reference for the remaining species
(Additional file 21, Table S21; Additional file 22, Table
S22; Additional file 23, Table S23; Additional file 24,
Table S24; Additional file 25, Table S25; Additional file
26, Table S26; Additional file 27, Table S27; Additional
file 28, Table S28; Additional file 29, Table S29; Additional file 30, Table S30).
Crystal structures or theoretical models were used,
when available and relevant, to map the PSC onto the
protein three-dimensional structures using the NCBI
application Cn3D [81]. The following models were used:
TLR1-TLR2 (MMDB ID: 59994) [16]; TLR2-TLR6
(MMDB ID: 78279) [82]; TLR3 (MMDB ID: 64341) [22];
TLR4 (MMDB ID: 70004) [23].
