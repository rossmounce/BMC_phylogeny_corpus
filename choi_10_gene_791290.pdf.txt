Abstract
Background: Horned beetles, in particular in the genus Onthophagus, are important models for studies on sexual
selection, biological radiations, the origin of novel traits, developmental plasticity, biocontrol, conservation, and
forensic biology. Despite their growing prominence as models for studying both basic and applied questions in
biology, little genomic or transcriptomic data are available for this genus. We used massively parallel
pyrosequencing (Roche 454-FLX platform) to produce a comprehensive EST dataset for the horned beetle
Onthophagus taurus. To maximize sequence diversity, we pooled RNA extracted from a normalized library
encompassing diverse developmental stages and both sexes.
Results: We used 454 pyrosequencing to sequence ESTs from all post-embryonic stages of O. taurus.
Approximately 1.36 million reads assembled into 50,080 non-redundant sequences encompassing a total of 26.5
Mbp. The non-redundant sequences match over half of the genes in Tribolium castaneum, the most closely related
species with a sequenced genome. Analyses of Gene Ontology annotations and biochemical pathways indicate
that the O. taurus sequences reflect a wide and representative sampling of biological functions and biochemical
processes. An analysis of sequence polymorphisms revealed that SNP frequency was negatively related to overall
expression level and the number of tissue types in which a given gene is expressed. The most variable genes were
enriched for a limited number of GO annotations whereas the least variable genes were enriched for a wide range
of GO terms directly related to fitness.
Conclusions: This study provides the first large-scale EST database for horned beetles, a much-needed resource for
advancing the study of these organisms. Furthermore, we identified instances of gene duplications and alternative
splicing, useful for future study of gene regulation, and a large number of SNP markers that could be used in
population-genetic studies of O. taurus and possibly other horned beetles.

Background
Horned beetles, in particular in the genus Onthophagus,
are important models for studies on sexual selection
[1-3], biological radiations [4-7], endocrine regulation of
development [8-11], biological control of invasive species [12-14], conservation biology [15,16], and forensic
biology [17-19]. Onthophagus beetles have more recently
gained particular prominence as models for studying the
origin and diversification of novel traits (hundreds of
species express diverse horns and horn-like structures
that lack obvious homology to any other traits in insects

[20,21]) and the developmental underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity (species adjust adult morphology, behavior, and physiology in response to larval nutrition,
ranging from subtle adjustment to profound modifications depending on species and phenotype [22-27]).
Despite their growing prominence as models for studying both basic and applied questions in biology, no genome projects exist for any Onthophagus species. Instead,
investigations into the genetic basis of Onthophagus biology have had to rely on homology-based gene-by-gene
cloning [28,29] and only very recently on low throughput
EST sequencing [30]. At the same time, development of
genomic resources in several other insect models, such as
Drosophila, mosquitoes, Tribolium beetles [31], honey
bees [32], and several lepidopteran species [33-35], has

greatly advanced insights into the molecular and developmental genetics, physiology, and evolution of these organisms. Onthophagus beetles offer great opportunities to
add to the study of important biological phenomena pioneered through the study of these earlier models, such as
the regulation of arthropod development, which has been
informed in large part through work on fruit flies and
Tribolium beetles [36,37], the origin of novel complex
traits, as studied in butterfly wing patterns [38,39], or the
genetic regulation of nutrition-sensitive development, a
central focus of honey bee research [40-42].
Furthermore, several other experimental techniques
and tools have been successfully developed for Onthophagus, most notably RNAinterference mediated transcript depletion [43]. Applying such tools to the study
of Onthophagus biology has, however, been hampered
by the paucity of candidate genes and pathways available
for investigation. The very recent development of modest EST resources for Onthophagus taurus using traditional Sanger sequencing [30] has already facilitated
several important new research efforts [44-46]. Combined, this suggests that studies on Onthophagus beetles
are poised to make rapid progress once large-scale genomic or transcriptomic resources are available, which in
turn promises to advance our understanding of fundamental and applied question in evolution and developmental biology. Here we describe an EST collection
developed for the horned beetle Onthophagus taurus,
the most commonly studied species of horned beetle to
date.

Results
Sequencing, assembly and analysis of non-redundant
sequences

We wished to sample a broad diversity of transcribed
sequences including those expressed during the elaboration of horns. Given that in Drosophila melanogaster,
which shares holometabolous development with beetles,
the greatest number of genes are expressed in adult
females, followed by pupal and then larval stages [47],
we anticipated that sampling transcription from postembryonic stages of Onthophagus would allow us to
obtain a broad diversity of expressed sequences. We
prepared sequencing libraries using RNA isolated from
all post-embryonic life stages including both sexes (see
Methods). Sequencing using the 454 GS FLX titanium
platform yielded 1,366,749 sequence reads. After cleaning, 1,361,424 reads (average length: 440 nt) were
assembled using Newbler [48] and MIRA [49], resulting
in 39,088 contigs (average length: 583 nt, average coverage: 24 reads) and 10,992 singletons (average length: 337
nt) (Table 1). Thus, the approximately 1.36 million reads
collapsed into 50,080 “non-redundant” sequences totaling 26,520,165 nt. The sequence reads are available at

NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA010107) and the
assembled sequences are provided in Additional file 1.
We characterized the non-redundant sequences in
terms of similarity to known repeated sequences, known
protein-coding sequences, and known transcribed
sequences. First, running RepeatMasker [50] with
RepBase database for Drosophila [51] identified 37
LINEs, 39 LTR elements, 41 DNA transposons and 67
small RNAs (Additional file 2). In total, 1.05% of base
pairs were masked including 33 kbp of simple repeats
and 206 kbp of low complexity regions. Second, aligning
the Onthophagus non-redundant sequences with the
NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein sequence database
[52], revealed that 54% (21,275) of the contigs had
sequence matches with known proteins with an E-value
< 1 × 10-5, 37% (14,359) had matches with an E-value < 1
× 10-20, and 21% (8,068) had matches with an E-value < 1
× 10-50 (Table 2). Given that, on average, singletons were
shorter than contigs, both in terms of overall length and
the length of predicted open reading frames (Table 1), it
was to be expected that they would be less likely to
include coding sequence. Indeed, 25% (2,715), 12%
(1,357) and 3% (373) of singletons had matches with
E-values of < 1 × 10-5, <1 × 10-20, and <1 × 10-50, respectively. While the singletons had proportionately fewer
protein matches, they do contribute significantly to the
information content of the non-redundant sequences.
For instance, approximately 14% of the NR protein
sequences with matches (E-value < 1 × 10-5) against the
non-redundant sequences matched exclusively with singletons. Third, we aligned the non-redundant sequences
against databases of sequences from T. castaneum, the
only other beetle for which comprehensive sequence data
is available. This revealed that a small proportion of the
non-redundant sequences that do not have matches
against NR do have matches against the T. castaneum

4% (1,621) of the contig sequences, and 3% (357) of the
singletons are in this category (E-value < 1 × 10-5).
Further analyses of these sequences revealed the following: (i) 759 sequences matched the T. castaneum annotated protein coding sequences and genome. (ii) 345
sequences matched the T. castaneum annotated proteins
but not the T. castaneum genome, and thus are likely to
be genuine transcribed sequences, but the homologous
sequences may not be included in the assembled T. castaneum genome. (iii) Of 874 sequences that matched
only the T. castaneum genome, 446 contigs and 114 singletons matched T. castaneum sequences that lie within

that are included in mature transcripts in O. taurus but
not T. castaneum. Alternatively, they may identify
sequences that are included in mature transcripts in T.
castaneum but not annotated as such. (iv) 314
sequences matched unannotated genomic sequence in
T. castaneum, and thus may identify lineage specific
genes, or more likely, genes that are not annotated in T.
castaneum. In total then, 52% (25,968) of the O. taurus
non-redundant sequences matched either NR, or T. castaneum genomic or protein sequences. Conversely, the
O. taurus non-redundant sequences match with
approximately 56% (9,303/16,645) of the gene models in
T. castaneum, and 59% (5,322/9,053) of the sequence
clusters in the Tribolium UniGene set (Table 2). These
data suggests we have sampled a significant fraction of
the O. taurus transcriptome.
Although we took measures to minimize gut contamination (see Methods), the animals used to construct the
library had to be cultured in cow dung, which is rich in
plant and microbial material. We consequently anticipated that our EST might include some non-Onthophagus sequences, and therefore explored the taxonomic
distribution of sequences matching the Onthophagus
non-redundant sequences. We did this using MEGAN
[53], which assigns each sequence to the lowest common ancestor of the set of taxa with corresponding
sequence matches. This analysis revealed that, of the
sequences that had sequence matches and were
assigned, the majority were assigned to the expected
taxonomic groups within the Arthropoda (Figure 2).
Specifically, 8,462 contigs and 611 singletons, were classified to Tribolium: 9,120 to Tenebrionidae, 9,243 to
Polyphaga, 13,944 to Endopterygota, 18,097 to Neoptera,
18,542 to Arthropoda, 20,296 to Coelomata, 20,674 to
Bilateria, 21,981 to Metazoa, and 23,589 to Eukaryota.

Figure 2 Taxonomic distribution of sequence matches. Phylogenetic tree showing the number of O. taurus non-redundant sequences
assigned to branches. The MEGAN algorithm used in this analysis assigns each sequence to the lowest common ancestor of the set of taxa with
corresponding sequence matches. The total numbers of O. taurus sequences assigned to each branch are indicated in decimals and by the pie
chart area (Log scale). Pie graph colors indicate the proportion of contigs (red) and singeltons (blue) assigned to each branch.

Reassuringly, a relatively small proportion was assigned
to taxa outside beetles. For instance only 83 contigs and
69 singletons were classified to bacteria (Figure 2). This
indicates that O. taurus sequences are not significantly
contaminated by ESTs from bacteria or plants.
Nevertheless, 48% of the O. taurus non-redundant
sequences did not match with the T. castaneum genome
or proteins. Of 38,050 contigs, 21,847 sequences had
significant hits (E-value cutoff of 1 × 10-5) to the Tribolium genome, Tribolium proteins, and/or NCBI NR
(Figure 1), while 16,203 sequences had no significant
match to any of these databases. We performed additional analyses on the “no-hit” sequences to determine
whether they represent poor sampling (i.e., short or few
reads) or biologically interesting (highly divergent)
genes. Compared to sequences with significant hits, the
no-hit sequences had shorter contig lengths (mean (SE):
hit = 733.5 (3.17); no hit = 391.1 (3.69); F38048 = 4941, P
= 0), smaller proportions of read length made up of predicted coding sequence (mean (SE): hit = 0.751 (0.002);
no hit = 0.518 (0.002); F38048 = 7,737, P = 0), and fewer
reads (mean (SE): hit = 74.1 (0.67); no hit = 22.64
(0.78); F 38048 = 2,492, P = 0). While the mean

distribution of contig length, proportion of coding
sequence and read number was significantly different
between hit and no hit sequences, there was considerable overlap between the two distributions (see Additional file 3). In particular, 21% of the no hit sequences
(3,338 of 16,203) had at least the average read length
(733 bp) and proportion coding sequence (0.74) of
sequences with hits. This subset of high quality
sequences had on average 39 reads, suggesting they
were not simply genes with low expression. Taken
together, this analysis suggests that while many of our
“no hit” sequences likely represent low information content of a contig due to short or few reads, a significant
proportion of these no hit sequences may represent
highly divergent or novel genes that may prove interesting in future study.
In summary, the O. taurus non-redundant sequences
match with over half of the genes in T. castaneum. If
we assume that these two beetle species have similar
total gene numbers, then we can infer that we have
sampled a significant proportion of genes in O. taurus.
There is no evidence that the O. taurus sequences are
significantly contaminated with sequences from other

taxa. Furthermore, we seem to have sampled many
genes that may represent highly divergent or novel
proteins.
Clustering related sequences

It was to be expected that many of the non-redundant
sequences would derive from non-overlapping regions
of common transcripts. Indeed the 23,990 non-redundant Onthophagus sequences match a total of 14,223
distinct sequences in the NCBI NR protein database
(Table 2). We took two approaches to identify clusters
of non-redundant sequences that potentially derive from
common transcription units.
The first approach to clustering the non-redundant
sequences was based on an analysis of “broken reads”,
or individual sequence reads that were placed in two or
more contigs during the assembly of contigs. Pairs of
contigs may be linked by broken reads if they (i) derive
from the same gene but fail to assemble due to
sequence polymorphisms between alleles, (ii) derive
from alternatively spliced transcripts, (iii) derive from
recently duplicated genes that still include some
sequence similarity, or (iv) if the read(s) come from chimeric clones. In order to identify groups of contigs that
are linked by broken reads we created a graph in which
contigs are represented as nodes and broken reads
represented as edges connecting nodes. This identified
5,136 connected components (CCs, subgraphs in which
the nodes are connected by paths of edges), including
2,603 bi-connected components (BCCs, subgraphs that
are not split of any one edge is removed, Additional file
4). The BCCs identify groups of three or more contigs
that are linked by independent broken sequence reads.
Figure 3A shows an example of a simple BCC composed
of three contigs that share three independent sets of
broken reads. The likelihood of BCCs resulting from
chimeric clones is extremely low, as the minimum BCC
of three nodes, would require three chimeras linking the
three genes to occur independently. We reasoned that
contigs with BCCs arising from different genomic origins would share different levels of sequence similarity contigs from divergent alleles would have higher
sequence similarity than contigs derived from duplicated
genes, and contigs derived from alternatively spliced
exons may share no sequence similarity at all. We therefore performed inter se Blastn sequence alignments of
the contigs within each BCC, and categorized the BCCs
as follows. First, pairs of contig sequences that had at
least 50 bp of at least 95% sequence identity, flanked on
either side by no more than 10 nt of less than 95%
sequence identity (single stranded overhangs of >10 nt
were permitted), were flagged as putative alleles and
merged. Second, pairs of contigs that failed to meet the
criteria for allelic variants and had Blastn matches of E-

composed of three contigs 28477, 25928 and 04341 that share
three independent sets of 31, 28, and 8 broken reads, respectively
(indicated by dashed line) in relation to the homologous T.
castaneum transcript (Tc XM963744). Our analysis suggests that this
pattern is reflective of two alternative splice variants present in the
Onthophagus transcriptome. B. The three conceptual polypeptide
sequences from these contigs align to a contiguous region of the
Disabled protein from Tribolium, supporting this hypothesis. Shown
are, from top to bottom, two alternative Drosophila Disabled
transcripts (dark blue lines; thin light blue lines indicate first
methionine (M) and stop codon (*)), the homologous Tribolium
sequence (green; no alternative transcripts are known from
Tribolium) and the relative positions of contigs 28477, 25928 and
04341. Note that the contig 28477 (light orange), which based on
our analysis is a putatively alternatively spliced exon, does not share
similarity with the exon that is alternatively spliced in Drosophila.

value < 1 × 10 -5 were flagged as putative duplicates.
Third, pairs of contigs that failed to meet the criteria for
allelic variants, and did not have Blastn matches of Evalue < 1 × 10-5 were flagged as putatively derived from
alternative splicing. An analysis of known duplicated
and alternatively spliced genes in Drosophila suggests
that the use of this method cannot fully exclude misclassification, but that the frequency of false calls should
overall be low (see Methods). Therefore while the BCCs
provide strong evidence that contigs are related, the
classification based on sequence similarity is only
suggestive.
A total of 4,205 contigs met the first set of criteria and
were flagged as putative alleles and merged into 2,026
groups. The hypothesis that these contigs derive from
the same gene was supported by sequence matches

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

against NR proteins. Of the pairs of merged contigs
where both contigs had sequence matches against NR,
99% (1,547/1,565) had best matches to the same protein
sequence, and only 1% (18/1,565) matched different
proteins.
A total of 85 pairs of contigs met the second set of
criteria and were flagged as presumptive duplicates. The
hypothesis that these contigs derive from duplicate
genes was supported by sequence matches against NR
proteins. Of the pairs of contigs where both contigs
have sequence matches against NR, 96% (23/24) had
best matches to the same NR protein, and only 4% (1/
24) had best matches to different proteins. We also
asked whether there is evidence that the genes corresponding to the NR proteins are likely to be duplicated
in the genomes of related species. Of the sequences
tested 85% had two matches (E-value < 1 × 10-5) in T.
castaneum (of 26 with at least one match) and 83% had
two matches in a D. melanogaster (of 24 with at least
one match). This indicates that 83-85% of the BCCs
flagged as putatively duplicated in Onthophagus are also
duplicated in other arthropods providing support for
this classification.
We identified 753 groups of contigs (BCC) that met
the third set of criteria and were thus flagged as putatively derived from alternative splicing. The hypothesis
that these BCCs derive from alternatively spliced transcripts was supported by sequence matches against NR
proteins, and Drosophila genes. Of these BCCs in which
all contigs had sequence matches against NR, 62% (138/
221) were composed of contigs that all had best matches
with the same NR protein. We also investigated whether
the corresponding genes (best Blastp match with a minimum of E-value = 1 × 10 -5 ) in D. melanogaster are
annotated as being alternatively spliced. 67% of the 206
cases tested were annotated as alternatively spliced in D.
melanogaster. These data support the prediction that
the corresponding genes are indeed alternatively spliced
in O. taurus. A simple example is illustrated in Figure 3.
Contigs 28477 (108nt), 25928 (769nt) and 04341 (639nt)
form a BCC that is joined by a total of 67 broken reads
(Figure 3A). Each edge of the BCC is defined by multiple broken reads, with the minimum being eight. The
three contigs do not share significant sequence similarity
among themselves (5.9% translated amino acid sequence
identity between contig 25928 vs. contig 28477, 10.8%
between contig 28477 vs. contig 04341, and 18.2%
between contig 25928 vs. contig 04341), and as such,
were flagged in our analysis as putatively belonging to a
common transcription unit with alternative splicing.
Indeed, the three conceptual polypeptide sequences
from these contigs align to a contiguous region of the
Disabled protein from T. castaneum, supporting this
hypothesis. It should be noted that many of the BCCs

Page 6 of 19

that putatively result from alternative splicing have complex structures the resolution of which will require
sequencing genomic and/or cDNA sequences. In summary, the analysis of BCCs grouped 10,387 of the nonredundant sequences into 2,603 groups flagged as putatively derived from a common gene (2,026 as allelic variants and 753 as alternatively spliced). While the BCC
analysis provides reasonably strong evidence for merging
sequences, it clearly does not capture all likely cases,
and we therefore turned to similarity to known genes as
a more comprehensive means of grouping non-redundant sequences, as described next.
In the second approach to clustering Onthophagus
sequences we used similarity to sequences in the HomoloGene database [54], which is composed of groups of
homologous gene sequences from 20 sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Onthophagus sequences that match the
same HomoloGene sequence are likely to either derive
from a single gene, or closely related gene family, in the
Onthophagus genome. A total of 18,976 non-redundant
Onthophagus sequences (17,160 contigs and 1,807 singletons) matched sequences from a total of 12,464
HomoloGene groups with an E-value < 1 × 10 -5
(Table 3, Additional file 5). At this stringency, 55%
(6,839) of the clusters are composed of two or more
Onthophagus sequences (14,062 contigs and 1,496 singletons total) and the remaining 45% (5,625) are composed of individual Onthophagus sequences (4,101
contigs and 512 singletons). Restricting the clustering
only to cases where all of the Onthophagus sequences
within a cluster have the best hit to the same HomoloGene sequence (shown in parenthesis in Table 3, and
referred to here as “major clusters”) reduced the total
number of clusters from 12,464 clusters (E-value < 1 ×
10 -5 ) to 8,504 clusters (E-value < 1 × 10 -5 ) (Table 3).
There are 12,708 contigs and 1,160 singletons assigned
uniquely to 6,839 HomoloGene groups. The number of

clusters falls to 8,524 at E-value < 1 × 10-20, and then to
4,846 at E-value < 1 × 10-50. The major clusters represent the highest confidence set of non-redundant and
presumably protein coding sequences. Thus, the 1.36
million reads collapse into 50,080 non-redundant
sequences, which in turn are clustered into 8,504 major
clusters with matches (E-value < 1 × 10 -5 ) against
HomoloGene. This clustering provides an estimate of
the total number of transcribed protein coding genes
identified in this study. This estimate is concordant with
the total number of genes matched in the annotated
Tribolium genome (9,303) at the same E-value cut-off
(Table 2).
Functional annotation

We used sequence matches against the NCBI NR protein databases as a means of providing a first-pass
annotation of putative function of the O. taurus nonredundant sequences. As expected the non-redundant
sequences matched genes with a wide range of biological and biochemical processes (Additional file 6). Given
that many of the non-redundant sequences derive from
common genes, we turned to annotating the clustered
sequences in order to gain a more accurate view of the
range of biological processes represented by the
expressed sequences. We examined the GO term annotations associated with the 8,504 HomoloGene groups
that match the major clusters. Those clusters based on
the best matches, i.e., major clusters, were searched for
GO terms and the number of HomoloGene IDs was
counted for each GO term. We used the annotated T.
castaneum proteins as a reference for comparison. The
distributions of the second and third level GO term
annotations of the sampled O. taurus sequences were
remarkably similar to those on the complete T. castaneum proteome (Figure 4). This indicates that the O.
taurus sequences represent a broad sampling of biological processes. This interpretation was supported by
examining the representation of annotated biochemical
pathways. We mapped the major clusters to EC
(Enzyme Commission) numbers and examined the distribution of these enzyme catalyzed reactions in a global metabolic map using iPath [55]. This revealed that
the O. taurus expressed sequences included sequences
encoding enzymes in all of the major categories of
metabolic pathways including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, nucleotide
metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (Additional
file 7). Many of the core metabolic processes were well
represented. For instance all of the steps in the
TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid
biosynthesis were found to be present. Thus the
Onthophagus expressed sequences provide a good
representation of genes with basic metabolic functions.

In addition to developing general comprehensive EST
resources for the future study or horned beetle biology,
our study also aimed to enrich existing pools of putative
candidate genes specifically for the study of horn formation and plasticity in horned beetle development. We
therefore examined whether our EST library contained
contigs or singletons with matches to genes with GO
terms believed to be relevant to horn formation or
developmental plasticity (Table 4). For example, beetle
horns develop from appendage anlagen that share many
developmental properties with Drosophila imaginal discs
[29], and we therefore searched for contigs matching
genes with GO terms related to imaginal disc development and patterning. This effort yielded a rich set of
candidate genes including prominent leg gap genes (e.g.
exd, dac, BarH1) and several members of the Notch,
Wnt, and smoothened signaling pathways. In addition to
the likely importance of appendage patterning processes
in horn development, horn formation is commonly
sexually dimorphic [4], which is thought to be regulated
by sex-specific differences in the endocrine regulation of
horn induction and proliferation [8]. It was therefore of
interest to us to search our EST library for contigs that
match genes with GO terms related to sex determination as well as ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone (JH)
metabolism and signaling. We identified several contigs
that match cardinal sex determination and differentiation genes (e.g. dsx, fru), or have been implicated in JH
or ecdysteroid function (e.g. epoxide hydrolase 1, EcR,
ftz-f1, usp). Lastly, Onthophagus development is characterized by a highly variable degree of developmental
plasticity in response to nutritional variation and we
therefore examined our EST library for genes with GO
terms related to the regulation of nutrition-mediated
plasticity. Specifically, we searched our EST list for contigs that match genes related to DNA methylation (a
mechanisms implicated in the nutritional control of
caste differentiation in honey bees [56]) and insulin-signaling (suggested to play an important role in nutrientmediated plasticity in horn development [57]). This
effort identified the complete set of all three DNA
methyltransferases (dnmt1-3) also reported from honey
bees [56] as well as several prominent members of the
insulin receptor signaling pathway (e.g. InR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). These and additional examples are
listed in Table 4. These results indicate that we greatly
enriched the existing pools of candidate genes available
for the study of horn formation and plasticity in horned
beetle development.
Sequence polymorphisms

Our libraries sampled a total of 64 haploid genomes (32
diploid individuals) from a laboratory culture established
from wild caught animals, which allowed us to begin to

explore sequence variation in O. taurus. After merging
contigs in BCCs, all contigs were used for sequence variant analysis. GigaBayes [58] identified 164,537 SNPs
and 344,632 indels. After removing indel calls in homopolymer regions, 80,732 indels remained. Additional file
8 shows histograms of our confidence in identified
sequence variants (based on the “probability” value calculated for each SNP by GigaBayes). We focused subsequent analyses on only high quality sequence variants:
those with at least 5 reads and a GigaBayes probability
value of at least 0.9. Additional file 9 shows sequence
changes of 92,979 and 25,496 final SNPs and indels.
Transitions - A-G and T-C mutations - were more common than transversions. Furthermore, insertions and

deletions more commonly affected A and T than C and
G.
Across all contigs, the average SNP frequency was
0.00567 SNP/bp, or approximately 1 SNP for every 176
base pairs (for insertions and deletions, mean = 0.00197
indels/bp). The number of SNPs in a contig was positively related to both contig length and number of reads
in a standard least squares linear model containing both
transformed variables (Table 5). The number of insertions and deletions in a contig was also related to contig
length and read number in a separate model (Table 5).
In subsequent analyses, we considered residual SNP and
indel frequency (observed - expected, given contig
length and read number), which allowed us to estimate

genetic variation while correcting for variation among
contigs in read depth and length.
We aligned residual SNP and indel frequency with a
previously reported expression data set [46]. Expression
patterns were measured in females, large horned males
and small sneaker males in three epidermal tissues
(head horn, thoracic horn and legs) relative to abdominal epidermis and in central brain tissue, relative to
ganglionic brain tissue. These array data (N = 48 arrays)
were used to estimate overall expression levels of a contig ("A”), total tissues in which differential expression
was detected, bias between male morphs and sexes
(across all tissues, see [46]). We found that SNP and
indel frequency were negatively related to the overall
expression level of a gene and the number of tissues

(the inverse of tissue specificity) in which the gene was
expressed, in a standard least squares linear model that
also controlled for morph-biased and sex-biased expression (Table 6, Figure 5).
We used Blast2Go to identify GO terms enriched in
subsets of genes with more or less variation than
expected. The most variable genes (the top 5% of genes
in terms of residual SNP frequency) were enriched for
three GO terms, including actin binding and cytoskeletal
protein binding (Additional file 10, Sheet “top 5% SNP

Both contig length (transformed) and number of reads (transformed) were
related to total detected SNPs and total detected indels in standard least
squares linear models. Residuals from these models were used in subsequent
analyses to estimate levels of genetic variation in a contig controlling for
sampling differences between contigs.

Shown are results from standard least square linear models relating measures
of gene expression from a previous experiment - average expression levels
(A), sex-biased gene expression, alternate mating morph-biased gene
expression, and expression detected across up to four different tissue types to estimates of genetic variation (see Table 5).

for 61 GO terms, including many processes related to

Discussion
Our results build on a growing literature that shows that
454 pyrosequencing can be a powerful tool for expanding genomic resources for emerging model systems (e.g.
[59,60]. The major shortcoming of such high-throughput sequencing - short reads that can be difficult to
assemble - are being overcome by advances in the
sequencing process itself and novel bioinformatic
approaches explored in studies such as this. Here we
review our findings, the novelty of our approach, and
highlight some of the specific tools this sequencing
effort brings to the Onthophagus system.
Sampling the Onthophagus transcriptome

As in most high-throughput sequencing projects, in one
454 run, we generated a massive body of sequence
information: almost 600 millions base pairs spread over
1.4 million cleaned reads (Table 1). This has vastly
expanded our existing set of Onthopagus ESTs that was
previously generated by Sanger sequencing [30], with
93% of the 454 sequences (46,891) failing to match the
Sanger sequences (E-value cut-off = 1 × 10-50). Nevertheless the Sanger ESTs are not entirely redundant, as
9.6% of the Sanger sequences failed to match the 454
sequences (E-value cut-off = 1 × 10-50). Using a series of

analyses, these reads were assembled into contigs and
clusters that represent approximately 8,500 known
genes (4,000 - 14,000 depending on the database used
and the stringency for the match; see Table 2, 3). Our
analyses provide several lines of evidence that suggest
we can be confident in our assembly.
First, the majority of our sequences significantly align
with known protein sequences, in particular those of
Tribolium, the only beetle genome currently sequenced.
Specifically, 52% of contigs and singletons, and 59% of
contigs align with known sequences from one of three
databases (E-value < 1 × 10-5; Figure 1). The majority of
these alignments (80%) agree between all three databases queried (see Table 2). A small number of genes
(<4% of sequences) matched a protein in only one of
the databases; these genes likely represent instances
where the Tribolium genome is incompletely annotated
or assembled or where genes are transcribed in Onthophagus, but not in Tribolium (see Figure 1).
While the majority of our sequences aligned with
known sequences, 41-48% of our sequences did not
match known proteins or the Tribolium genome. Our
analyses suggest that many of these sequences represent
contigs with short or very few reads, or reads that cover
non-coding sequence (Additional file 3). However, at
least 20% of these genes are of similar or greater quality
(average read length and proportion coding sequence) of
sequences with significant alignments, and may include
genes that are novel or highly divergent between O.
taurus and Tribolium. This is not surprising given that
Onthophagus and Tribolium shared a common ancestor
over 150 million years ago [61]. These divergent genes
may be fruitful for future research given that they may

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

represent novel genes, or genes under strong selection
for new functions.
A second line of evidence that generates confidence in
our results is a survey of the taxonomic distribution of
best sequence matches. Specifically, of contigs with significant matches to the NCBI NR database, over 8,000 (40%)
were classified to Tribolium, and 18,500 (87%) to Arthropoda. A relatively small proportion was classified to taxa
outside of insects. For instance, less than one percent of
genes were classified to bacteria. Given these beetles feed
on dung and have a diverse associated gut flora [62,63],
the non-arthropod-classified sequences could represent
gut contamination of symbionts or partially digested plant
products. We sought to minimize such contamination by
sampling only the head and thorax of individual beetles,
but presumably, contaminants could be present in the
foregut or structures specialized to house symbionts. The
fact that non-arthropod classified sequences are dominated by singletons, while the arthropod-classified
sequences are dominated by contigs (Figure 2), supports
the interpretation of minor contamination by naturally
associated plant parts and bacteria.
Our Gene Ontology classification also lends significant
support to our assembly of the Onthophagus taurus
transcriptome. Comparing Onthophagus to Tribolium,
our genes sample roughly the same proportion of gene
classes for classifications of molecular function, cellular
component, and biological process (Figure 4). For
instance, in Tribolium, 15, 9 and 8 percent of genes are
involved in “biological regulation,” “developmental process” and “establishment of localization,” respectively,
while in Onthophagus, the corresponding percentages
are 14, 8, and 7. The largest differences are still modest
and fall within the “metabolic process” category (39% of
Onthophagus genes fall into this category, versus 32% of
Tribolium genes); which could prove to be an interesting consequence of the differences in diet between the
two species.
By comparing our assembled sequences to existing
databases, our analyses suggest that we have sampled
about half of the Onthophagus transcriptome. For
instance, around 20,000 contigs and singletons match to
approximately 10,000 separate genes (depending on the
database used; at an E-value of 1 × 10-5; see Table 2, 3).
Based on the Drosophila genome, we can estimate that
Onthophagus may possess around 20,000 genes; thus, we
have sampled about half of the genes present in the genome. If we assume that the 4,000 higher quality, but
highly diverged genes discussed above, which did not
align to known genes, match to about 2,000 additional,
independent genes (as in Table 2, 3), then we may have
sampled about 60% of the transcriptome. Regardless, this
dataset represents a rich resource for future work on the
system.

Bioinformatic Approaches

Next generation sequencing and the de novo assembly of
transcribed sequences is increasingly being used to characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms for
which a whole-genome sequence is not yet available
[64]. The absence of a reference genome sequence
makes the assembly of these sequences particularly challenging. Because 454 sequencing results in sequence
reads that are generally shorter than a given gene,
assembly relies on generating a series of overlapping
reads. However, any sequence variants among the reads,
for instance due to genetic variation between individuals, sequencing of paralogs of a gene, or alternative
splicing, can make assembly difficult. Furthermore, overlapping reads may be assembled for separate components of a gene, resulting in multiple contigs
representing one gene. We used several complementary
bioinformatic approaches to overcome the limitations of
short read lengths.
We used a clustering approach against the HomoloGene database to determine whether our non-redundant
sequences (contigs and singletons) derived from the
same gene within the genome. Similar approaches have
been demonstrated to be effective in clustering contigs
of transcribed sequences in the absence of a reference
genome [65-67]. This method allowed us to identify the
highest confidence set of non-redundant protein-coding
sequences in our dataset. For instance, with an E value
< 1 × 10 -5 , 18,976 Onthophagus sequences matched
sequences from 12,464 HomoloGene groups (Table 3).
This method was concordant with our more general
approach to identify the number of genes sampled,
where we tested for sequence matches across several
databases, including the Tribolium genome (Table 2).
In the absence of a reference genome sequence it is
very difficult to identify sequences that derive from the
same gene but fail to assemble due to sequence polymorphisms or alternative splicing. This is particularly
true in the absence of informative similarities to
sequences from related species. One approach to this
problem has been to remove a sub-set of redundant
contigs without resolving the relationship between the
sequences [68]. Here we used a novel analysis of “broken reads,” individual sequence reads that were placed
in two or more contigs during assembly. This approach
identifies groups of sequences connected through multiple broken reads ("bi-connected components”) and are
thus biologically linked, but have failed to assemble due
to sequence polymorphisms, alternative splicing or gene
duplication (see Figure 3). To our knowledge this
approach is unique in being able to cluster such
sequences in the absence of a reference genome. We
then used sequence similarity amongst the sequences
within bi-connected components to infer the most likely

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

physical origin of the connected sequences. For instance,
when linked contigs shared at least 95% sequence identity, they were assumed to be divergent alleles and the
sequences were merged. Of the sets of linked contigs
that fit this criterion, 99% (1,547/1,565) matched to the
same protein in the NCBI NR database, suggesting our
assumptions were correct. Linked contigs with less
sequence similarity were classified as either putative
duplicates (85-95% similarity) or alternatively spliced
transcripts (<85% sequence similarity), both of which
were supported by comparing our classifications to
existing gene models. It is important to emphasize that
while the clustering of bi-connected components provides very strong evidence that the sequences derive
from either alleles, alternatively spliced transcripts, or
gene families, the classification based on sequence similarity is not definitive. The definitive resolution of gene
structures must ultimately rely on genome and/or full
length cDNA sequencing. Despite this caveat the clustering based on broken reads is an effective means of
grouping related sequences in the absence of a reference
genome.
Our preliminary SNP analyses lend further confidence
in the classification of genes as alternative alleles. First,
we found that transitions were more common than
transversions (Additional file 9), as commonly reported
in studies that consider patterns of genetic variation
[69-72]. Second, we used previously reported microarray
data [30,46] to test whether the SNPs we identified were
related to patterns of gene expression in manners consistent with other studies. We found significant negative
relationships between SNP frequency and overall levels
of gene expression, consistent with the commonly
reported relationship between gene expression and gene
conservation [73,74]. We also found a negative relationship between SNP frequency and the number tissues in
which a gene was significantly expressed, which is reminiscent of the positive relationship between tissue-specific gene expression and sequence divergence due to
pleiotropic constraints [75,76].
Overall, our use of multiple, complementary bioinformatic approaches allowed us to glean a large amount of
information from one 454 run. We are now primed for
a range of studies on the Onthophagus system, some of
which we highlight below. Furthermore, this analysis
pipeline will allow similar resources to be developed for
a range of emerging model systems.
Tools for Future Studies of this Model System

The resources generated in the present study provide an
expansive toolbox for advancing current, and enabling
future research efforts in horned beetles. Here, we highlight three particularly interesting avenues for future
inquiry.

Page 13 of 19

The Origin of a Novel Trait: Horn development

Horned beetles in general, and Onthophagus beetles in
particular, are becoming attractive models for studying
the origin and diversification of novel traits, specifically
horns [21]. Horns lack obvious homology to other traits
in insects or non-insect arthropods, yet develop at least
in part similar to more traditional appendages such as
legs and mouthparts. Thus, beetle horns offer an interesting opportunity to study how evolutionary changes in
the interactions between ancestral developmentalgenetic mechanisms may enable the origin of novel features. Earlier studies have begun to implicate several
developmental pathways in the regulation of horn development using immunohistochemical analysis of candidate genes (e.g. limb patterning [28,29], programmed
cell death [44]), quantitative PCR (e.g. insulin signaling
[57]), hormone manipulations (e.g. juvenile hormone
metabolism [9]) and most recently RNAinterference
[43]. In each case, analysis of candidate genes was limited to very few or one gene candidate. In the present
study we substantially increase the number of candidate
genes now available to investigate the role of these pathways in horn development and evolution (Table 4).
Furthermore, we provide a substantial number of candidate genes for the investigation of developmental pathways previously inaccessible for study, yet hypothesized
to play a potentially significant role in the origin and
diversification of beetle horns and horned beetles, such
as the notch, Wnt, and EGFR signaling pathways [77].
In so doing the present study also contributes important
resources for moving beyond the examination of single
candidate genes and toward examining interactions
between developmental pathways and within and
between gene networks.
Phenotypic Plasticity

The biology of horned beetles is characterized by a
remarkable degree of phenotypic plasticity - a single
genotype’s ability to adjust phenotype expression to
changes in environmental conditions[78]. In horned beetles, such plastic responses involve behavioral traits (e.g.
fighting vs. sneaking reproductive tactics in males [79]),
parental investment [25,26], physiological changes (timing of metamorphosis [24], thermoregulation [80]) and
morphology (horns [27], testes investment [81]). However, the developmental genetic basis of this plasticity is
largely unknown. Here, our 454 run has generated a
rich set of tools for future inquiry into the genetic
underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity. For instance, the
insulin signaling pathway has been suggested to play an
important role in mediating the plastic switch between
fighter and sneaker tactics in horned beetles [57]. Our
sequencing effort identified many important genes in
this pathway, including chico, FOXO, insulin receptor,
and melted.

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

Similarly, DNA methylation is another important candidate pathway for nutrition-induced phenotypic plasticity [82]. The importance of DNA methylation in
insects has been of interest in recent years, following
the discovery that a complete methylation machinery while absent in Drosophila - is present in the Hymenoptera [83], shows significant variation across species [84],
and appears to play an important role in nutritioninduced caste determination in honeybees [56,85]. The
present study has identified the complete set of all three
DNA methyltransferases (dnmt1-3) in Onthophagus
taurus, including the de novo methyltransferase (dnmt3)
and the maintenance methyltransferase (dnmt1), setting
the stage for future studies into the role of DNA methylation in horned beetle plasticity
Population Genetics and Patterns of Genetic Variation

Our SNP analyses identified overall levels of genetic variation comparable to 454 studies of other animals
sampled from wild populations [70,71], but considerably
more relative to domestic or lab strains of animals
[59,86] and considerably less relative to plants, even
domestic varieties [69,87]. This SNP dataset will serve as
a powerful resource in future studies of genetic variation. We can now easily genotype individuals and sample standing levels of genetic variation. Having SNPs
associated with this assembly also primes us for more
powerful analyses of how gene expression patterns affect
genetic variation, for instance due to relaxed selection
on morph- or environment-specific genes [88].
Our SNP dataset also brings us closer to identify patterns of natural selection on the Onthophagus genome,
and determining which genes are under strong positive
or purifying selection. Such analyses will be facilitated
by sequencing other species in the genus (and the calculation of dN/dS). Until then, we can get hints at classes
of genes under strong or weakened selection, based on
our gene ontology enrichment analysis of more or less
variable genes. For instance, very few GO categories
were associated with highly variable genes (actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding; Additional file 10).
This could be because these variable genes are more
divergent and have no or incomplete annotation. Indeed,
of these 1900 genes (5% of 38,000 contigs), 47.4% were
annotated in the low variation group and 33.2% were
annotated in the high variation group. In contrast, the
least variable genes were enriched for over 60 GO terms
(Additional file 10). Scanning this list reveals many processes that are likely under purifying or positive selection, including metabolism (GO terms: metabolic
process, primary metabolic process, macromolecule
metabolism, etc.), development (developmental process,
multicellular organismal development), cell cycle (cell
cycle, cell death), morphology (anatomical structure
development and morphogenesis, nucleic acid binding

Page 14 of 19

(nucleotide binding, RNA binding), and life history
(death, reproduction). While these processes may be
biologically relevant and possibly indicative of the origin
and rapid diversification of novel traits in this lineage
(horns), it is important to treat these lists with caution
as such enrichment analyses can be confounded by
nested gene ontology categories [89]. Regardless, this
analysis yields genes and developmental processes that
may prove interesting for future study in this system.

Conclusions
This study sampled sequences from approximately half
of genes expressed in the horned beetle Onthophagus
taurus. This greatly advances our knowledge of the
Onthophagus transcriptome and paves the way for
future molecular genetic studies of horn evolution and
development.
Methods
Sample preparation and sequencing

Beetles used in this study were reared as described previously [29]. To avoid possible contamination of the gut
fauna, we used head and three thoracic segments from
our larval samples. Instead of dissecting head and thoracic segments from pupae, we used the whole body.
Late pupae were transferred to a clean, humid chamber
before emergence and adults were not fed with any cow
dung to avoid possible contamination from the food
source. To enrich the pool of expressed genes with various classes of transcripts, we included all the major
stages of postembryonic dung beetle development: mid
3rd instar larva (5 days after molt), late 3rd instar larva
(11 days after molt), early and late prepupa, pupa within
24 hrs after pupation, between 36 and 48 hrs after pupation, mid pupa (7 and 9 days after pupation), late pupa
(12 days after pupation), and adults 4 days after molt.
Each stage includes two males and two females except
for pupa day 7 (one female) and day 9 (one male). In
total, we used 32 animals to extract total RNA. Total
RNA was isolated as described in [30]. RNA quantity
and quality were tested using an Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100. Total RNA was then sent to the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics at Indiana University, Bloomington (IU CGB), which prepared a normalized
transcriptome (cDNA) library optimized for Roche 454
GS-FLX Titanium sequencing using custom methods
(K. Mockaitis, unpublished, available upon request).
This library was sequenced using the GS-FLX Titanium
process on a full PicoTitre plate, according to the
manufacturer.

using an in-house package [90] The sequences were
assembled as follows. First, sequences were assembled
using the 454 Newbler assembler [48] with a minimum
overlapping length of 40 bp and a minimum percent
identity of 90%. This assembled 38,050 contigs (22
Mbp) leaving 16,606 singletons (5.8 Mbp) and discarding 48,409 sequences due to them being too short, chimeric, or repetitive. Second, putative false negative
assemblies were identified by Blast aligning the singletons against the contigs. This identified 2,797 singletons
that aligned with 2,351 contigs (≥95% percent identity
and ≤10 bp unaligned bases at either end). These singletons were merged with the respective contigs. Third,

redundant singletons were identified by Blast aligning
remaining singletons inter se. This identified 540 redundant singletons (≥95% percent identity and ≤10 bp unaligned bases at either end) that were discarded. Fourth,
the remaining unassembled singletons were assembled
using the MIRA assembler [49]. This assembled 2,251
singletons into 1,038 contigs (444 Kbp). Finally, the
remaining singletons were Blast aligned to the Mira contigs and 26 singletons were merged to 25 contigs (≥95%
percent identity and ≤10 bp unaligned bases at either
end). This procedure produced 39,088 contigs (23 Mbp)
and 10,992 singletons (3.7 Mbp) which are referred to
here as the O. taurus non-redundant sequences.

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

Sequence alignments and analysis

Repeats, transposons, small RNAs and low complexity
regions were identified using RepeatMasker [50] in conjunction with the RepBase [51] database for Drosophila.
O. taurus sequences were aligned to the following public
sequence databases using BlastX and tBlastX (-F F -e 1e5): NCBI T. castaneum UniGene #12 [91], T. castaneum
genome v3.0 [92], T. castaneum annotated proteins v3.0
[92], and NCBI HomoloGene build 64 [54]. Open reading
frames (ORFs) were predicted using ORF finder [93] and
ORFpredictor [94]. The taxonomical analysis of sequence
matches was performed using MEGAN [53]. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using Blast2Go [95]. The analysis of metabolic pathways was performed by first using
Blast sequence matches against HomoloGene [54] to
assign Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, and then
using iPath [55] to visualize metabolic pathways.
Clustering

Two different approaches were used to cluster nonredundant sequences. In the first approach broken reads
- reads that were split and assembled in two or more
contigs by Newbler - were used to group contigs. Using
a custom script (script available at: https://www.source
forge.net/projects/snp454), broken reads were used to
construct graphs; where nodes represented contigs and
edges represented broken reads, and contigs forming
connected components (CC) and bi-connected components (BCC, subgraphs that are not split if any one edge
is removed) were identified. Briefly, the script was fed
Newbler assemblies in ACE format and performed the
following steps: (i) identify broken reads based on read
names, (ii) construct graph using Pearl Graph Module
[96], (iii) identify CC and BCC using Pearl Graph Module function, (iv) flag each BCC as putatively allelic,
duplicated, or alternative splicing according to the
criteria described below.
The contigs connected in BCCs are likely to represent
allelic variants, duplicated genes, duplicated exons, alternative splicing, or a combination of the aforementioned.
It is to be expected that contigs that failed to assemble
due to allelic variation will share higher sequence similarity than duplicated genes/exons, and that alternatively
spliced exons will share the lowest sequence similarity.
In order to explore whether we could distinguish
between these classes based on sequence similarity
alone, we analyzed the sequence similarity between
recently duplicated genes [97], and between alternatively
spliced exons in the D. melanogaster genome (FlyBase
FB2010_07). Recently duplicated genes (e.g. Nuclear
transport factor-2 and Sperm-specific dynein intermediate chain) can share regions of up to 95-100% sequence
identity. Given that this exceeds the sequence similarity
cut-off commonly used for the assembly of 454

Page 16 of 19

sequences [48,49], it is not possible to definitively distinguish between BCCs representing allelic variants from
those representing duplicated genes. However, an earlier
scan for segments duplicated in the D. melanogaster
genome identified 82 groups of duplicated sequence
(average length 3.7 kb) that share 95% or greater
sequence identity [98], indicating that such cases are
rare. On the other hand 97% of alternatively spliced
genes in Drosophila do not have pairs of exons with
Blastn matches with E-value < 1 × 10-5 (excluding overlapping exons). Thus, while most alternatively spliced
exons fall below this cut-off, there are exceptions and it
is not possible to definitively distinguish between BCCs
representing alternative splicing from those representing
duplicated genes/exons or allelic variation, based on
sequence similarity alone. Having established that
sequence similarity performs reasonably well in classifying alleles, duplicated genes and alternatively spiced
exons; we performed inter se Blastn sequence alignments among the contigs within BCCs, and classified
them as follows. First, highly similar sequences were
flagged as putative allelic sequences if they met the following criteria: at least 50 bp of at least 95% sequence
identity, flanked on either side by no more than 10 nt of
less than 95% sequence identity (single stranded overhangs of >10 nt were permitted). Second, pairs of contigs not meeting the first criteria but having Blastn
matches of E-value < 1 × 10-5 were flagged as putatively
representing duplicated genes. Finally, BCCs with contigs failing to meet the first two criteria were flagged as
putatively representing alternatively spliced transcripts.
The second approach to cluster non-redundant
sequences utilized sequence matches to the HomoloGene
database of groups of homologous sequences from
sequenced genomes [54]. The non-redundant sequences
were assigned HomoloGene IDs based on the best Blast
matches to the database (minimum cut off = E-value < 1
× 10-5). Clusters of O. taurus non-redundant sequences
that all shared the best Blast match to the same HomoloGene group were defined as “major clusters”.
Sequence Variants

Sequence variant call programs suffer from the fact that
when assembling contigs, the Newbler algorithm introduces gaps instead of substitutions in alignments
between reads. To overcome this problem, we realigned
sequences within contigs using a custom script (Script
available at: https://www.sourceforge.net/projects/
snp454). This script was fed Newbler alignments in
ACE format and performed following steps: (i) extracted
pairwise alignments, (ii) removed homopolymeric gaps
from pairwise alignments, and (iii) ran MosaikAssemble
[99] to generate multiple sequence alignments. These
multiple sequence alignments were then fed to GigaBayes

Choi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:703
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/703

[58] to predict sequence variants. The sequence variants
predicted by GigaBayes were filtered out for high confident sites if indel variants occur in homopolymer regions,
read coverage is less than 5 or greater than 100 and the
probability of sequence variants is less than 0.9.
To analyze patterns of SNP variation, we first calculated a “residual” SNP number from a standard least
squares linear model that controlled for read length and
number of reads (both factors were first log transformed
and treated as fixed effects in the model). Previous studies have acknowledged the importance of controlling for
both factors when estimating genetic variation from 454
data [72], but we feel this analysis improves on previous
metrics. By using a residual calculated from a predicted
value, we can control for the fact that a SNP reading of
“0,” could be due to low genetic variation, or low power
due to short read lengths. We performed several exploratory analyzes of SNP variation. First, we used past microarray data to test if genetic variation was related to gene
expression patterns. Our microarray data [46] were based
on the past cDNA EST assembly [30] that was incorporated into the current assembly. For any microarray construct that matched more than one contig in the 454
assembly we averaged the residual SNP frequency.
Expression data are described in detail in [46]. Briefly,
gene expression was measured in first day pupae of
females, large, horned male and small, sneaker males in
the head horn epidermis, thoracic horn epidermis and
legs relative to abdominal epidermis and in the central
brain relative to ganglionic neural tissue (N = 48 total
arrays). We focused on four measures of gene expression:
total expression level ("A”), total tissue types (out of 4) in
which differential expression was detected, bias in gene
expression between male morphs and between males and
females (averaged over all tissues). We recognize that the
relationship between tissue specificity and SNP frequency
could be confounded by our method of detecting SNPs.
Specifically, a highly expressed, tissue-specific gene may
be detected only in one or two individuals (that are currently expressing this gene), thus decreasing the probability of detecting SNPs in that gene. However, this
prediction is opposite that predicted (and found) in our
data; that tissue-specific genes are more variable. In our
second set of analyses, we were interested in whether
genes with the greatest or least amount of variation were
enriched for any GO terms. We performed an enrichment analysis using Fisher’s Exact Test implemented in
Blast2Go [100].
