helix-loop-helix protein involved in
Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa

Abstract
Background: Iron (Fe) is the most limiting micronutrient element for crop production in alkaline soils. A number
of transcription factors involved in regulating Fe uptake from soil and transport in plants have been identified.
Analysis of transcriptome data from Oryza sativa grown under limiting Fe conditions reveals that transcript
abundances of several genes encoding transcription factors are altered by Fe availability. These transcription factors
are putative regulators of Fe deficiency responses.
Results: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is
up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively. The expression of OsIRO3
is specifically induced by Fe deficiency, and not by other micronutrient deficiencies. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsIRO3 were hypersensitive to Fe deficiency, indicating that the Fe deficiency response was
compromised. Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was
less than that in wild-type plants. Analysis of the transcript abundances of genes normally induced by Fe
deficiency in OsIRO3 over-expressing plants indicated their induction was markedly suppressed.
Conclusion: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe
homeostasis in rice was identified. The inhibitory effect of OsIRO3 over-expression on Fe deficiency response gene
expression combined with hypersensitivity of OsIRO3 over-expression lines to low Fe suggest that OsIRO3 is a
negative regulator of the Fe deficiency response in rice.

Background
Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth
and production. This is due to the fact that it is an
essential co-factor in a variety of enzymes that play critical roles in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen
fixation [1]. Although Fe is the second most abundant
metal element in the earth crust, its bio-availability is
limited, especially in alkaline soils where Fe largely exists
as insoluble hydroxides or oxides [2]. While the optimal
Fe concentration for plant growth is in the range of 10-9
to 10-4M , the bio-available Fe in most soils is approximately 10 -17 M [2,3]. Plants have two distinct uptake
strategies to increase the efficiency of Fe uptake from
soil [4]. The reduction strategy employed by non-grass

plant species uses a Fe deficiency induced reductase to
convert insoluble Fe(III) to Fe(II), the latter being transported into plant cells by the Fe(II) transporter IRT1
[4-6]. In contrast, grass species use a chelating strategy
to obtain Fe from soil. The chelating strategy consists of
Fe deficiency induced biosynthesis and secretion of phytosiderophore(s) and cognate high affinity transporters,
Fe(III)-phytosiderophore Yellow Stripe Transporter,
ZmYS1, HvYS1 and OsYSL15 [7-9].
Many of the components involved in Fe uptake for
both of the strategies outlined above have been identified at a molecular level. In Arabidopsis H+-ATPase 2
(AHA2) that mediates acidification of the rhizosphere
[10], a ferric reductase FRO2 [6] and a ferrous Fe transporter IRT1 [5], represent the three key components
required for a strategy I Fe uptake system. Identification
of the molecular components involved in strategy II Fe
uptake system has focused on the biosynthesis of the Fe

(III)-chelator, phytosiderophore (PS) [11]. Key genes in
the PS biosynthesis include nicotianamine synthase gene
OsNAS1/2/3 [12], nicotianamine aminotransferase gene
OsNAAT1 [13], and the cognate transporter YellowStripe 1 [7].
Many of the genes involved in Fe uptake via strategy I
or II display a distinct Fe deficiency induced expression
pattern [14]. Transcriptome studies have shown that
large scale alterations of transcript abundances is a common feature of Fe deficiency and thus plays a key role in
the Fe deficiency response [15-17]. Alterations in transcript abundances of genes encoding transcription factors are of particular interest in these studies due to
their potential role in regulating the Fe deficiency
response. The bHLH transcription factor FER, a regulator of iron uptake, was first identified from the analysis
of the tomato fer mutant [18]. The fer mutant failed to
activate a Strategy I Fe uptake pathway under Fe deficient conditions. Studies have also shown that either
FER or its Arabidopsis ortholog, FER-like transcription
factor, FIT1, is required for the strategy I responses
[19]. Subsequent studies have identified a family of
bHLH transcription factors in Arabidopsis (AtbHLH 38/
39/100/101) that interact with FIT1 [20,21]. A number
of transcription factors involved in regulating the Fe
deficiency response in Oryza sativa (rice) have also been
identified. The Fe-regulated bHLH transcription factor,
OsIRO2, shares high similarity with the Arabidopsis
family of bHLH transcription factors and positively regulates the expression of strategy II pathway genes,
including OsNAS1/2/3, OsNAAT1, deoxymugineic acid
synthase gene OsDMAS1 and a YS-like gene OsYSL15
[22]. Two other transcription factors, Fe-deficiencyresponsive factors, IDEF1 and IDEF2, bind the Fe-deficiency-responsive elements 1 and 2 (IDE1 and IDE2)
and positively regulate a large number of Fe responsive
genes [23-25]. As IDEF1 and IDEF2 are constitutively
expressed in roots and shoots in rice, other regulatory
factors which may only be expressed under Fe limiting
conditions may be involved in regulating the response
to Fe deficiency.
A previous study identified transcripts of several genes
encoding transcription factors that changed in abundance with Fe deficiency [17]. In this study, the function
of one of the transcription factors, a bHLH transcription
factor (TF) family protein, named OsIRO3 (OsIRbHLH2
in previous paper, LOC_Os03g26210) was investigated.
Our analysis suggests that OsIRO3 acts as a negative
regulator of the Fe deficiency response.

Results
OsIRO3 is specifically induced by Fe deficiency

Previous studies in our laboratory identified several
transcription factors whose expression was induced by

Page 2 of 9

Fe deficiency in rice [17]. One gene encoding a bHLH
transcription factor, OsIRO3, is highly induced by Fe
deficiency in both roots and shoots [17]. To determine
whether the induction of OsIRO3 is specific to Fe deficiency or whether this induction could be observed
under deficiency of other minerals, the transcript abundance of OsIRO3 was determined from plants grown
under a variety of different mineral element deficient
conditions. The transcript abundance of OsIRO3 was
markedly induced by Fe deficiency in both roots and
shoots, by 25- and 90-fold respectively (Figure 1A). Deficiency of several other minerals, including copper and
zinc had no effect of the induction of OsIRO3 in roots
or shoots (Figure 1A), indicating that the induction of
OsIRO3 was specific to Fe deficient conditions.
The time-course expression pattern of the OsIRO3
and the other two known transcription factors,
OsIRO2 and IDEF1, in response to Fe deficiency was
investigated. Consistent with previous studies
[15,22,24], IDEF1 was constitutively expressed in both
roots and shoots (Figure 1B). In contrast OsIRO2 and
OsIRO3 were significantly up-regulated by Fe deficiency, with a 10-fold induction or greater evident
after 3 days and continued induction up to 8 days
(Figure 1B). The induction of OsIRO3 was less in
terms of magnitude in shoots, OsIRO3 was induced
20-fold compared to OsIRO2 being induced almost
40-fold after 6 days (Figure 1B shoot). In roots
OsIRO3 induction lagged behind that of OsIRO2 both
in time and magnitude, OsIRO2 was already induced
50-fold after 1 day compared to OsIRO3 for which a
10-fold induction was observed only after 3 days
(Figure 1B root).
Subcellular localization of OsIRO3

To determine the subcellular localization of OsIRO3
protein, the full length cDNA of OsIRO3 was cloned in
frame to the 3′ end of the sGFP. The expression of the
fusion protein was driven by the 35S CaMV promoter.
Targeting ability was tested in onion epidermal cells
using microprojectile bombardment along with the vector control which contains sGFP alone. Results showed
that the OsIRO3::sGFP fusion protein was targeted to
nuclei (Figure 2A to 2C). The control sGFP was found
throughout the cell, in nuclei and the cytosol (Figure 2D
to 2F), indicating that OsIRO3 has specific nuclear targeting ability.
Phylogenetic analysis of OsIRO3

There are 158 and 173 predicted members of the
bHLH-domain containing transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice respectively [26,27]. To investigate the
relationship between OsIRO3 and previously characterized bHLH transcription factors regulating the Fe

factors tomato FER [18], Arabidopsis FIT1 [19],
AtbHLH 38, 39, 100 and 101 [20] was performed
(Amino acid sequences were listed in Additional file 1).
As expected, FER and its Arabidopsis ortholog, FIT1
were classified into the same Clade (Figure 3, Clade I).
OsIRO2 branches in the same clade with the

Arabidopsis bHLH family proteins 38/39/100/101 (Figure 3, Clade II). OsIRO3 branches into Clade III (Figure
3). AtbHLH105 (ILR3) which was reported to modulate
metal homeostasis and response to auxin was also found
in this clade [28]. The protein sequence of Arabidopsis
ILR3 is only 20.9% identical to OsIRO3. Also,
OsbHLH62 (OsbHLH1), that branches closest to
OsIRO3 (Figure 3), has been previously reported to be
induced by cold stress [29].

Over-expressing OsIRO3 results in hypersensitivity to
Fe deficiency

OsIRO3 was over-expressed (OE) in rice to investigate
the role it played in Fe homeostasis. Two independent
OE transgenic lines with significantly altered expression
level of OsIRO3 (Figure 4A) were studied in detail. To
examine if alteration of OsIRO3 expression in transgenic
lines influences tolerance to low Fe conditions, three
week old OE and wild-type rice seedlings were

transferred into solution culture containing high
(100 μM ), moderate (10 μM), or low (1 μM) levels of Fe
for 10 days. Under Fe sufficient conditions (100 μM), the
transgenic seedlings overexpressing OsIRO3 had significantly shorter shoots compared to the wild-type counterparts(Figure 4C, Additional file 2), although the color
was normal with no evidence of chlorosis that would suggest Fe deficiency (Figure 4B, Additional file 2). SPAD
values and Fe concentrations from these plants also

confirm values very close to wild type, although SPAD
values were slightly but significantly lower (Figure 4D
and 4E). Under moderate Fe supply (10 μM), the two OE
lines displayed a chlorotic phenotype in the newly developed leaves compared to the wild-type plants (Figure 4B,
Additional file 2). The SPAD values of the youngest
leaves in both OE lines under 10 μM Fe were reduced to
~ 65% compared to the wild-type control (Figure 4D). At
1 μM Fe supply, all plants displayed chlorotic symptoms
(Figure 4B, Additional file 2). Both OE lines had significantly reduced SPAD values and shoot height compared
to wild-type (Figure 4C and 4D, Additional file 2). The Fe
concentration of shoots in both OE lines was significantly
reduced compared to wild-type under both medium and
low levels of Fe supply (Figure 4E).

OsIRO3 suppresses the induction of Fe responsive genes
by Fe deficiency

The expression patterns of previously characterized Fe
deficiency responsive genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsIRO2,
OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsNramp1 [5,6,8,12,30] were
investigated under different Fe levels. As expected, all of
these genes were markedly induced by Fe deficiency
(Figure 5). OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were very sensitive to
Fe availability, displaying the highest induction levels
under Fe deficiency conditions (Figure 5). However, in
the two OE OsIRO3 transgenic lines, the induction of
transcript abundance for these genes, with the exception
of OsIRT1 in roots, was significantly suppressed under
all three Fe supply conditions (Figure 6A-C).
The expression of OsIRT1 was only significantly

down-regulated by both OE lines under low Fe supply
condition (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Several lines of evidence indicate an important regulatory role for OsIRO3 in response to Fe deficiency in
rice. Firstly, it is specifically induced by Fe deficiency
but not by other metal depletion. Secondly, OsIRO3-OE
lines are more sensitive to low Fe availability than wildtype. Thirdly, the induction of Fe deficiency responsive
genes that play pivotal roles in Fe uptake are suppressed
in OsIRO3-OE lines. Together these data imply that
OsIRO3 is a negative regulator of Fe uptake in rice.
To date, a variety of bHLH transcription factors have
been shown to play important roles in regulating Fe
uptake and homeostasis [15,18,20-22]. OsIRO3 is not phylogenetically related to other known bHLH transcription
factors involved in the regulation of Fe uptake, such as
OsIRO2 and IDEF1 [15,24]. Thus, it is a novel Fe-responsive transcription factor. Over-expression of OsIRO2 and
IDEF1 increased the expression of Fe uptake related gene
transcripts and these plants also showed an enhanced tolerance to Fe deficiency. Thus, they are positive regulators
of downstream Fe responsive genes [24]. In contrast, this
study revealed that over-expression of OsIRO3 results in
hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency, due to the suppression of

induction of Fe uptake related genes, suggesting it is a
negative regulator. Fe deficiency induces the activation of
the methionine cycle and biosynthesis of PS in strategy II
plants [14,17], a process which is nutrient and energy
demanding. Over-expression of NA synthase alone, an
enzyme catalyzing a rate limiting step of NA and PS synthesis resulted in significantly reduced growth [31,32]. In
addition, excessive Fe acts as a catalyst for the formation
of free radicals that are potent oxidizing agents which can
damage many important biological molecules in cells [2].
Thus, although the Fe deficiency response results in
increased Fe uptake it also results in a growth penalty.
Therefore negative regulators are required to balance the
induction of Fe uptake components to reduce the negative
effect on plant growth that results from excessive Fe and/
or as a result of the induction of the components due to
Fe deficiency. The fact that the induction of OsIRO3 is
slightly later in shoots and at a lower level in roots compared to the positive regulator OsIRO2 (Figure 1B) suggests that OsIRO3 may play a role as part of a negative
feed back loop on the Fe deficiency response.

Zheng, et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:166

The negative effect of OsIRO3 occurs via either a
direct or indirect mechanism. As OsIRO3 induction lags
that of OsIRO2, it may be regulated by OsIRO2 to form
a negative feedback loop. In fact, there is a putative
OsIRO2 binding cis-element in the promoter region of
OsIRO3 (Additional file 3). bHLH transcription factors
often function in homo- and/or hetero-dimerized forms
[33,34]. OsIRO3 and OsIRO2 and/or IDEF1 regulate
similar downstream targets, albeit in opposite manners.
These transcription factors might interact with each
other and/or bind to the same cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter region of target genes. Analysis
of the expression of OsIRO3 and IDEF1 in different
microarray data sets showed that these two genes are
expressed antagonistically (Additional file 4). There are
a number of predicted proteins in Arabidopsis and rice
with high sequence similarity to OsIRO3 (Figure 2). The
closest orthologue of OsIRO3 gene in Arabidopsis,
AtbHLH047, is also induced by Fe deficiency (unpublished data). Whether AtbHLH047 plays a similar role
in Fe homeostasis in Arabidopsis needs to be
investigated.

Conclusion
This study reveals the regulatory role of a bHLH protein, OsIRO3 in Fe homeostasis in rice. OsIRO3 is specifically induced by Fe deficiency, suggesting it functions
in Fe deficiency responses. The nuclear localization of
OsIRO3 supports the hypothesis that OsIRO3 acts as a
transcription factor. The hypersensitivity to low Fe supply of the OsIRO3-OE and the inhibitory effect of
OsIRO3-OE on the induction of Fe deficiency response
genes suggest OsIRO3 functions as a negative regulator
in Fe deficiency responses. The identification of the new
important regulator adds to a growing understanding of
the network of fine control of Fe homeostasis.
Methods
Plant Materials

The rice cultivar Nipponbare was used in this study as a
wild-type control. To construct a binary vector for the
over-expression of OsIRO3, the full length cDNA
sequence of the OsIRO3 gene was amplified using the
following primers:
Forward 5′- GGATCCGATTTGAGCAGGGAACGGAAGG -3′
Reverse 5′- GGATCCGACAGAAGTGTTTTCGTG
TGGA -3′.
The PCR fragment was then cloned into the Takara
pMD19 vector. After sequence confirmation, it was
cloned into pTF101-ubi at the BamHI site (Additional
file 5) [13]. Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation
of rice callus was carried out as described previously
[35]. Ten independently transformed plant lines were

Page 7 of 9

generated. QRT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate
the effect of over-expression. Two independent lines
were selected with significant increased levels of OsIRO3
transcripts, designated as OE-1 and OE-2.
Plant cultivation conditions

Wild-type and transgenic plants were germinated and
grown in culture solution prepared as described by
Yoshida et al [36] except using EDTA-Fe instead of
Citrate-Fe. The solution contained 1.425 mM NH4 NO3
, 0.323 mM NaH2 PO4 , 0.513 mM K2 SO4 , 0.998 mM
CaCl 2 , 1.643 mM MgSO 4 , 0.009 mM MnCl 2 , 0.075
μM (NH4 )6 Mo7 O24 , 0.019 mM H3 BO3 , 0.155 μM
CuSO4 , 0.125 mM FeEDTA and 0.152 μM ZnSO4.
Rice seeds were germinated in distilled water for 2
days. After germination, 25 seedlings were transferred to
a plastic net floating on the nutrient solution described
above. For metal deficient treatments, two normally
growth rice seedlings were transferred to K-, Fe-, Zn-,
Cu- and Mn-free solution. Solution culture was changed
every two days. After ten days of metal depletion treatments, root and leaf samples were harvested for RNA
extraction and gene expression analysis. For Fe-deficient
time-course analysis, rice seedlings were transferred to
+Fe and -Fe solutions, root and shoot samples for RNA
extraction were taken after 1, 3, 6 and 8 days,
For different Fe concentration treatments, three week
old transgenic and wild-type rice plants were transferred
to solution culture containing with 100, 10 or 1 μM
EDTA-Fe. After 8 days of treatments, roots and leaves
were sampled for RNA extraction, measurements of
metal concentration, SPAD and shoot length
measurements.
Measurement of chlorophyll content

SPAD values (total chlorophyll content) were determined on the fully expanded youngest leaves of seedlings with a portable chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502;
Minolta Sensing).
Measurement of the Fe concentrations

To determine the concentrations of Fe in the rice plants,
elemental analysis was conducted on seedlings grown
under all treatments. Shoot and root samples were
ground to a fine powder and digested with 5 mL of 11 M
HNO3 for 5 h at 150°C. Metal concentrations were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7500ce, Santa Clara, CA, US).
Quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from plant samples using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. First-strand cDNAs were
synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript II reverse

transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA). QRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ (Perfect Real Time)
Kit (TaKaRa Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) on a LightCycler480 machine (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplification program for SYBR Green I was performed at 94°
C for 10 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 10 s. Triplicate
quantitative assays were performed on each cDNA sample. The housekeeping gene Actin was used as an internal
control. The relative level of expression was calculated
using the formula 2-Δ(ΔCp). All the primers that were
used for the QRT-PCR are given in Additional file 6.
Phylogenetic analysis

Alignment and phylogenetic tree were conducted using
default settings and the neighbor-joining algorithm of
the MEGA version 4 [37] with 1000 bootstrap trials.
Amino acid sequences of the bHLH TFs used for the
analysis are listed in Additional file 1. Amino acid
sequence similarity analysis was conducted in a website
tool found at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/
index.html.
Statistical analysis of data

For comparisons of treatments in Figure 4, a two sample
t-test assuming unequal variances was performed
with all samples compared to wild-type grown in three
different levels of Fe supply. Significance was defined as
p ≤ = 0.05.
