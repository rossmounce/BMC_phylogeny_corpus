Introduction
Advent of high-throughput sequencing and advanced
molecular imaging technologies marked the beginning of
a new era for modern translational and personalized medicine. The impact of sequencing human and comparative
genomes along with modern digital images in hand has
also created the fast development of high performance
computing and bioinformatics research, which will obviously have a profound effect on how biomedical research
will be conducted toward the improvement of human
health and prolonging of human life in the future. Supported by the United States National Science Foundation
(NSF), the International Society of Intelligent Biological
Medicine (ISIBM, http://www.ISIBM.org), the ISIBM's
official journals: the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design (IJCBDD, http://
www.inderscience.com/IJCBDD), and the International
Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine (IJFIPM, http://www.inderscience.com/IJFIPM), the
IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering at Harvard
Medical School was designed to touch future by promoting today's synergistic cutting edge research and education. It was the only synergistic inter/multidisciplinary
IEEE flagship conference in the field fully sponsored
(100%) by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) both financially and academically. IEEE
7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering received more
than 600 research papers and attracted 500 scientists,
engineers, medical doctors, faculty and students worldwide gathered at the conference center of Harvard Medical
School during October 14–17, 2007 in Boston, Massachusetts USA. All 600 submitted papers were carefully
reviewed and evaluated by the program and scientific
review committee consisting 273 professors, medical doctors and scientists. The 273 professors, medical doctors
and scientists spent great amount of time and efforts in
reviewing all submitted papers, tutorials, special interest
research and workshop proposals. After the rigorous peerreview process, 27 high-quality research papers were
selected from the 7th and 6th IEEE Bioinformatics and
Bioengineering, keynote lectures and invited papers from
world leading scientists for this BMC Genomics issue. The
acceptances of the 27 papers out of 600 papers were based
on peer-reviews. The committee is grateful for the contributions from the keynote speakers Dr. Russ B. Altman
(IEEE BIBM conference keynote lecturer on combining
simulation and machine learning to recognize function in
4D), Dr. Mary Yang (IEEE BIBM workshop keynote lecturer on New initiatives of detecting microscopic disease

ference and workshops, November 2-4, 2007, Silicon
Valley, California, USA. The IEEE conference at Harvard
has provided a forum for researchers and medical doctors
presenting their latest work, sharing and exchanging
research ideas, stimulating the potential collaboration
and promoting the inter/multi-disciplinary research and
education. The 27 cutting-edge research papers presented
in this BMC Genomics issue addressed a wide range of
research topics in gene regulation, gene network, gene
structure prediction, DNA microarray data and ChIP-onChip data analysis, protein disorder, protein structure and
function, disease prediction, genomics and bioinformatics tools. This BMC Genomics issue resonates the theme of
the Harvard meeting: Genomics, Molecular Imaging, Bioinformatics, and Bio-Nano-Info Integration are Synergistic Components of Translational Medicine and
Personalized Healthcare.

Scientific themes
This BMC genomics supplement consists of 27 research
papers. Those papers can be grouped into following categories based on their contents.
Protein structure and function prediction
More and more experimental evidences showed that
many protein functions depend on the unstructured
rather than structured state. Despite extensive data on
many important examples, including disease-associated
proteins, the importance of disorder for protein function
has been largely ignored. As a pioneer in this research
field, Dunker's group [1] reviewed the key discoveries and
to weave these discoveries together to support novel
approaches for understanding sequence-function relationships. They demonstrated that disorder prediction has
been important for showing that the relatively few experimentally characterized examples are members of a very
large collection of related disordered proteins that are
wide spread over all three domains of life.

It is challenge to annotate the function of new proteins
lacking of structure and sequence similarity with the
known proteins for the traditional approaches. Altman's
group [2] developed a novel framework, called FEATURE,
to model and recognize of functional sites in macromolecular structures. FEATURE robustly models molecular
functions without relying on significant sequence or fold
similarity.
Protein interactions, which are mediated by domains, are
important for most cellular functions. Ren et al. [3] systematically investigated the evolutionary conservation of
SLiMs recognized by SH2, SH3 and Ser/Thr Kinase
domains in both ordered and disordered protein regions.
They found SLiMs recognized by each domain were more
conserved in disordered regions as compared to structured

regions of proteins. Their work could significantly contribute to protein-protein interaction study. Yang et al. [4]
presented a machine learning approach to identify
unstructured proteins. They demonstrated that IUP predictor is viable alternative software for prediction.
Gene regulation and network
Bidirectional promoters were abundance in human
genome and essential for many tumor suppressor genes.
The functional mechanisms underlying the activation of
bidirectional promoters are currently uncharacterized.
Yang et al. [5] analyzed core promoter elements distribution in bidirectional promoters. They demonstrated that
bidirectional promoters utilize a variety of core promoter
elements to initiate transcription. CpG-islands dominate
the regulatory landscape of this group of promoters.

Chen et al [6] developed a Network-Identifier method
untilizing a thermodynamic model to infer regulatory
relationships from multiple time course gene expression
datasets. Applying Network-Identifier to five datasets of
differentiating embryonic stem cells, they constructed a
gene regulatory network among 87 transcription regulator
genes.
Feng et al [7] presented a mixture model-based analysis
for identifying differences in the distribution of RNA
polymerase II from ChIP-seq in transcribed regions. They
utilized a Poisson mixture model to identify gene targets
with differential Pol II binding activities in breast cancer
MCF7 cell line under various conditions. Their work provide a computational and statistical approaches to identify biological signals from ChIP-seq data.
Gene structure and function
Wu [8] implemented a statistical approach that combined
with evolutionary conservation information in gene prediction. Compared to results from GENSCAN and TWINSCAN, the author showed that this approach largely
improved the specificity of exon prediction. They proposed the approach could serve as a complementary
method to refine many existing approaches.

It is essential to align ontologies from different parties due
to a great amount of variety of ontologies constructed
under the auspices of the Open Biomedical Ontologies
(OBO). Huang et al. [9] designed a new ontology alignment algorithm utilizing artificial neural network
approach to learn and adjust the weights that associated
with different semantic aspects.
Comparative genomics
When transpositions are dominant, it turns to be very difficult to analyze genome rearrangement using existing
approaches. Yue et al [10] extended GRAPPA, one of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/S2/I1

most accurate methods for rearrangement phylogeny, to
handle transpositions. Their test results showed that the
extension approach is very accurate in terms of ancestor
genome inference and phylogenetic reconstruction.
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array
CGH) is a highly efficient technique that can simultaneously measure DNA copy number at hundreds or thousands of loci. Huang et al [11] developed Stationary
Wavelet Packet to smooth the array CGH data. They demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical and experimental exploration of a set of array
CGH data. Their comparison results suggested their
approach outperformed the previous methods.
Gene expression and microarray data
There are two papers described their novel techniques of
improving the quality of the microarray data. Yang et al.
[12] exploited various data processing techniques to
reduce the amount of inconsistence results in microarray
experiments when genomic DNA was used as common
reference. They found data quality was significantly
improved by imposing the constraint of minimal number
of replicates, logarithmic transformation and random
error analyses. Mehdi et al. [13] implement interwoven
design to improve microarray experiments to ensure that
the resulting data enables robust statistical analysis. They
developed an online web application that allows users to
find optimal loop designs for two-color microarray experiments.

The clinical application of microarray data is been limited
due to requirement to access detailed patient records. Harris et al. [14] presented the Genetic Learning Across Datasets concept (GLAD), a new Semi-Supervised Learning
(SSL) method for combining independent annotated
datasets and unannotated datasets with the aim of identifying more robust sample classifiers.
Gene expression data extracted from microarray experiments could generate high-dimensional feature space for
discriminating between different classes when thousands
of genes are measured simultaneously. Yana et al [15]
investigated the feature selection methods that evaluate
the "informativeness" of a set of genes. They demonstrated that including gene-gene interactions have better
classification power in gene expression analysis. Li et al
[16] presented a novel framework to select feature subsets
from all the newly extracted components from PCA and
PLS. They demonstrated that their feature selection
scheme improved generalization performance of classifier
according to the evaluation on several typical datasets.
Zhang et al. [17] developed a two-stage selection algorithm by combining ReliefF and mRMR. Comparing to
ReliefF, mRMR and other feature selection methods using

BMC Genomics 2008, 9(Suppl 2):I1

two classifiers as SVM and Naive Bayes on seven different
datasets, they showed that mRMR-ReliefF gene selection
algorithm is very effective.
Xu et al [18] developed a novel approach combining both
supervised learning with unsupervised learning techniques to generate discriminative gene clusters. Their
experiments on both simulated and real datasets exhibited that their method could produce a series of robust
gene clusters with good classification performance compared with existing approaches. Bryan et al [19] demonstrated that how the bicluster analysis may be extended
into a 'semi-supervised' ORF annotation approach
referred to as BALBOA. They showed the methods could
improve upon supervised approaches and shed new light
on the functions of unclassified ORFs and their co-regulation.
Genomics and bioinformatics in disease study
Goh et al. [20] examined the usefulness of intrinsic disorder predictions for studying the viral proteins. They constructed a set of biocomputing tools that include
relational database design and utilization of disorder prediction algorithms. Their exercise provides an example
showing how the combined use of intrinsic disorder predictions and relational databases provides an improved
understanding of the functional and structural behaviour
of viral proteins.

Sudden death syndrome of soybean is an ec onomically
important disease. Yuan et al [21] reported their analyses
of microarrays measuring transcript in whole plants after
A. thaliana cv 'Columbia' was challenged with fungal
pathogen F. virguliforme. They found significant variations
in transcript abundances which leaded to identification of
a putative resistance pathway involved in responding to
the pathogen infection in A. thaliana.
Yang et al. [22] investigated the cell killing effects on adjuvant RT and found that radio-sensitivity is actually not a
monotonic function of volume as it was believed before.
They presented detailed analysis and explanation to justify the statement and proposed an equivalent radio-sensitivity model. They conclude that radio sensitivity is a
sophisticated function over tumor volumes.
Hewett et al. [23] investigated the possibility of making
tumor classification more informative by using a method
for classification ranking. They applied Multi Dimensional Ranker (MDR) on Microarray data of 11 different
types and subtypes of cancer. They found that using the
classification rankings from MDR could achieved effective
tumor classifications from cancer gene expression data.

When the prostate cancer cell transfer from androgendependent to androgen-independent, androgen ablation,
the most commonly-used therapy for progressive prostate
cancer, is ineffective. Wang et al [24] developed a modelbased computational approach to identify transcription
factors and microRNAs influencing the progression of
androgen-dependent prostate cancer to androgen-independent prostate cancer. This result suggested that the
capability of transcription factors to initiate transcription
and microRNAs to facilitate mRNA degradation are both
decreased in androgen-independent prostate cancer.
Wu et al. [25] developed stringent statistical analysis
approach to reduce type I and type II error and described
its application in Type 1 diabetes research. They showed
that stringent statistical analysis, combined with hierarchical clustering and pathway analysis may offer deeper
insight into the biological processes reflected from a set of
expression array data.
Bio-informatics tool
Extracting information from batch BLAST can be consuming, insufficient, and inaccurate for large dataset. Mehdi et
al. [26] developed a java application called Batch Blast
Extractor to extract information from blast output. The
application generates a tab delimited text file that can be
easily imported into any statistical package such as Excel
or SPSS for further analysis. The software is open access,
free available to public.

Lieutaud et al. [27] developed a web metaserver called
MeDor. MeDor provides a HCA plot and runs a secondary
structure prediction, a prediction of signal peptides and
transmembrane regions and a set of disorder predictions.
This free available software tool could offer fast, simultaneous analysis of a query sequence by multiple predictors
and provides a graphical interface with a unified view of
the outputs.

Promoting emerging cutting-edge research
fields
Genomics, bioinformatics and personalized medicine are
upcoming emerging fields, and the resonance and synergy
of these fields are enormous, which will have profound
influence on the advances of science and medicine. In
cooperation with International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine http://www.isibm.org, International
Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design
(IJCBDD), International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine (IJFIPM) and World Congress on Computer Science, Computer Engineering and
Applied Computing http://www.world-academy-of-sci

engineering was unique because of a number of reasons:
The committee emphasized the promotion of inter/multidisciplinary research and education in accepting papers
and designing of the programs. One of the most important contributions of this conference based on the great
success of the 2007 International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (Biocomp 2007) was
that it created interaction and research collaboration in
inter/multidisciplinary research amongst the Biophysical
Sciences, Medical Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Computer Science and Engineering by providing a productive and
rich platform. The location of the conference (Harvard
Medical School) was strategically chosen to attract the participation of renowned researchers who work in Cambridge – Boston, Massachusetts area which is an
international biomedical research center (radius of 50
miles). Collaborative inter/multidisciplinary research will
help researchers from all disciplines involved, to reach the
summit in their sub-areas of the Bioinformatics and Bioengineering related projects. By doing so, both Worldcomp in Las Vegas and the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and
Bioengineering at Harvard Medical School have achieved
the goal of addressing challenges in the emerging contemporary Bioinformatics and Bioengineering fields that
would not further exist "as is" in separate silos as isolated
fields, but instead spanning a wide spectrum of knowledge and research focusing on the synergy of these two
fields to solve important but difficult biological and medical problems. It is strongly believed that people from various research backgrounds would extend their knowledge
scopes and conceive some novel research ideas inspired
by extensive inter/multidisciplinary discussions and collaborations. Not many conferences would have such multilateral cooperative efforts, with the help from ISIBM and
the Worldcomp, the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering was so unique to help to pass the hurdles and
break the invisible academic barriers between these two
different but both very important disciplines. Most
updated cutting-edge technologies and breaking though
ideas had brought into the conference at Harvard Medical
School in the keynote and tutorial lectures, and the open
discussions and scientific exchanges among attendees,
which inspired innovations, novel ideas and scientific discoveries. The IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering
provided such unique infrastructure and platform to promote interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research and
education.
The conference brought together top researchers from the
United States and around the world to exchange research
results and address open issues in all aspects of bioinformatics and bioengineering. The IEEE conference hosted a
number of cutting-edge research workshops and special
interest research sessions in collaboration with leading
scientists from the National Human Genome Research

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/S2/I1

Institute (NHGRI) and National Cancer Institute (NCI),
National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Indiana University, Purdue University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Southern
Illinois University, University of Illinois, University of
Michigan, University of California, University of Massachusetts, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University and
a number of other national laboratories and major
research universities.
Built on the great success of Biocomp – Worldcomp, the
aim of the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering
was to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research workshops, distinguished keynote and tutorial lectures and
special interest research sessions into a coordinated
research meeting. Due to the broad knowledge and scopes
that IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering encompassed, the conference received more than 600 high-quality research papers. The traditional IEEE Computer Society
6th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering received 100+
high-quality papers. A significant expansion has been
achieved and the acceptance rate for regular research
papers was less than 12%. The papers covered broad range
of research fields including genomics, bioinformatics and
bioengineering that created the theme of the IEEE flagship
conference: genomics, molecular imaging, bioinformatics, and bio-nano-info integration are synergistic components of translational and personalized medicine
research.
Major organizers of the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering who hold formal degrees in the fields of both
engineering and biophysical/biomedical sciences with
many years of research, teaching and engineering practice
experiences realized the power and needs of synergistic
engineering and biomedical research based on their professional experience. They and all other organizers are
dedicated to promote such inter/multidisciplinary
research and education. Therefore, the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering has been designed to be
responsive to the need for synergistic inter/multidisciplinary research and education. For that reason, it is the only
meeting whose components are also defined dynamically
in response to specific needs of largest number of keynote
lectures, cutting-edge research tutorial lectures, special
interest research workshops and special sessions with academic supports and contributions from leading scientists
at NIH, national laboratories and research universities.
Each proposal and nomination has been reviewed and
voted by the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering
committee to ensure that participants would be benefited
significantly from the academic event. We are very grateful
for the IEEE Bioinformatics and Bioengineering Plenary
Keynote Lectures given by:

Obviously, the conference would not have achieved such
a great success without the hard work and voluntary
efforts by many contributors. Organizing such a major
academic event in the fields is not possible without contributions from members of program and scientific review
committee. Thanks must be given to them for their professionalisms. We must express our sincere gratitude to Mary
Qu Yang, Vladimir N. Uversky, Yunlong Liu and the pro-

gram and scientific review committee members for their
high-quality timely evaluation of more than 600 fulllength regular research papers, as well as an additional
large set of poster submissions. We must extend our sincere thanks to all chairs, organizers and committee members (names and affiliations are listed below) for their
dedications and professional services. In particular,
Hamid R. Arabnia, Walker Land, Jr., Homayoun Valafar
and the award committee members dedicated themselves
to the unbiased evaluation and selection of the best
papers, and the NSF student travel fellowships; Yanqing
Zhang and Michelle M. Zhu managed the paper submission system and handled various important organizing
and academic affairs; Youping Deng handled not only registration and finance but also reviewed a large number of
papers; Jonathan Jesneck and Pengyu Hong helped local
arrangements; Qingzhong Liu, Mehdi Pirooznia, Zejin
Jason Ding, and Bingxin Shen maintained the website.
Walker Land, Jr., Guo-Zheng Li, Hamid R. Arabnia, Youping Deng, Michelle M. Zhu and Jack Y. Yang helped Scientific Review Committee Co-Chairs in the overall
systematic evalutions of all reviewers' comments and
ranks. Michelle M. Zhu, Heng Huang, Nikolaos G. Bourbakis and Jun Ni helped in the overall organization of the
conference and Michelle M. Zhu arranged the scientific
presentations and program schedules; Jack Y. Yang initiated the organization of the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and
Bioengineering and guided the committees as well as
managed the overall infrastructure of the IEEE conference.
Mary Qu Yang and Jack Y. Yang initiated not only the journal issues but also the NSF proposals that provided funds
to support students' travel; this is the first time that IEEE
Bioinformatics and Bioengineering is now not only offering leading scientific journal issues such as BMC Genomics
(impact factor: 4.03) and International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design, but also receiving grants
and support from the National Science Foundation. Mary
Qu Yang and Jack Y. Yang reformed the traditional IEEE
Bioinformatics and Bioengineering with new components
that are defined dynamically in response to specific needs
of inter/multidisciplinary cutting-edge research and education, therefore, Mary Qu Yang and Jack Y. Yang initiated
and arranged the organization of cutting-edge research
workshops, tutorial lectures, special sessions and poster
presentations in addition to the traditional keynote lectures. Mary Qu Yang and Jack Y. Yang took the initiatives
and invested significant efforts to expand the size of IEEE
Bioinformatics and Bioengineering from traditional 100–
200 papers each year for past 6 years to more than 600
full-length regular research paper submissions this year.
The theme of the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering at Harvard Medical School was to promote the
genomics, molecular imaging, bioinformatics, and bionano-info integration research that are important compo-

nents of translational and personalized medicine. Intellectual Merits include:
(1) Maximize learning outcomes (a lot of internationally
recognized experts delivered keynotes and tutorials with
large audience. The great learning outcomes have
achieved, and
(2) Maximize research outcomes (because students and
young investigators are major future research experts and
next-generation scientists to develop new techniques in
bioinformatics, genomics and bioengineering, now it is
necessary to provide them with the best chances to
improve themselves. So the more students and scientists
attended, the more benefits in research knowledge they
would obtain. The conference has achieved above goal
using the model of World Congress on Computer Science,
Computer Engineering and Applied Computing.
Broader impacts include
(1) Benefits in education: students and researchers who
were really needed helps do have chances to attend IEEE
7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering to meet experts
and listen to research presentations with a travel fellowship program, and
(2) Benefits in research: students and scientists had
opportunities to discuss research ideas with experts and
have future collaborative projects with other researchers.
The NSF student travel fellowship and best paper awards
To increase participation of underrepresented groups such
as minorities, women, and disabled individuals, Drs. Jack
Y. Yang, Yanqing Zhang, and Youping Deng submitted a
grant proposal to the United States National Science
Foundation, which led to a successfully funding of IEEE
7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering by the NSF. A committee chaired by Prof. Hamid R. Arabnia, and CoChaired by Prof. Walker Land, Jr., Prof. Homayoun Valafar, Prof. Yunlong Liu, Prof. Michelle M. Zhu, Prof.

The IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering as a large
IEEE flagship international conference with 7 years of tradition and leading reputation provided an important platform at the conference center of Harvard Medical School
for scientific discussions and collaborations. Because the
IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering received more
than 600 papers in more diverse fields, the committee had
decided to review and rank the papers in different categories in accordance to the enormous expansion of the conference. For example, the Best Inter/Multidisciplinary
research category was newly created by the committee.
Comparably, the IEEE 6th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering was a traditional IEEE Computer Society flagship
conference held in Washington, DC – Arlington Virginia
on October 15–18, 2006, the IEEE Computer Society conference received more than 100 high-quality papers in
more traditional bioinformatics field. The IEEE 6th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering committee chaired by Prof.
Nik Bourbakis, Prof. Michael Raymer and Prof. George
Karypis determined the following Outstanding Achievement Awards:

Bioinformatics, genomics and bioengineering play fundamental roles in our understanding and designs of biological systems and therapy medicine at all levels of
organization, from molecular biology, life sciences to
engineering and computer sciences. Bioinformatics is a
"bourgeoning out" field that studies the development of
algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and
theories to solve formal and practical biomedical problems. It also refers to hypothesis-driven investigations of
specific biological problems using computer simulations
that carry out with experimental or simulated data, with
the primary goal of discovery and the advancement of biological knowledge. Bioinformatics deals with the information and hypotheses. It is a technique-driven research that
utilizes many engineering and computer science methods.
Bioinformatics focus on the developments of mathematical and computational tools to extract useful information
from data produced by high-throughput biological techniques such as genome sequencing, protein sequences,
gene regulation, gene networks, ChIP-on-chip and DNA
microarrays data as well as mass spectrometry and MRI.
Bioinformatics broadly includes systems biology and
computational biology.
Bioengineering is a broad-based engineering discipline
that studies engineering biological processes involving
product design, sustainability and analysis of biological
systems. Bioengineering deals with all the biological,
medical, pharmaceutical the agricultural fields using engineering methods and approaches. Bioengineering thus
deals with living organism and biological products and
broadly includes food engineering and biotechnology. It
is an engineering field because it deals with practical
designs to create usable tangible products. In general, bioengineering attempts to solve the following biomedical
problems: 1) mimic biological systems in order to create
products; 2) modify and control biological systems so that
they can replace, augment, or sustain chemical and
mechanical processes; 3) design and developments of
medical devices and medical physics technologies.
In order to understand the life, studies of living organisms
must be carried out at multiple levels. Bioinformatics
deals with problems more at the microscopic level such as
genomic, proteomic and molecular biology data analysis,
while bioengineering focuses more on macroscopic level
such as tissue engineering, cell engineering, medical
image analysis and biological and medical devices. However, bioinformatics and bioengineering often exploit the
same or similar engineering and computational
approaches to solve practical or potentially practical bio-

medical problems, despite of their different focuses and
different studying objects. Because any life is an integrated
living organism, studies and research on living organisms
must be carried out at global level in order understand the
mechanism of living organisms and in order to design
effective therapy methods to treat human diseases and
promote human health. Up until now research on these
two important engineering related fields have been carried out in separate silos, but the synergy of the research
on both bioinformatics and bioengineering will prove
beneficial.
It is evidently that bioinformatics, genomics and bioengineering all study living organisms from different angles
and levels with different focuses but often with same or
similar engineering and computer science methods. Since
any living organisms are integrated life form and baring
this in mind, understanding the mechanisms of living
organism and breaking through advances in biological,
medical and agricultural sciences etc. require comprehensive studies and research of living organisms at multiple
levels and require the combination and integration of
knowledge acquired from multiple levels. Using World
Congress on Computer Science, Computer Engineering
and Applied Computing (Wordcomp) as a model, the
IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering was aimed to
bridge the gaps of biomedical researches at different levels
of studies on living organisms and fosters interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research and education.
High throughput sequencing and modern imaging technologies foster the development of translational and personalized medicine which use of information and data
from genotype, patient's phenotype, level of gene expression and protein interaction to discover biological mechanism, stratify disease, select a medication, plan a therapy,
or initiate a preventative measure that is particularly
suited to that patient at the time of administration. In
addition to genetic information, other factors, including
protein disorder, protein aggregation, protein misfolding,
medical imaging, and clinical information also play
important roles. The 2007 International Conference on
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (Biocomp)
was designed in response to the fast development of
above inter/multidisciplinary fields [28], 25 high-quality
papers [29-53] were selected for a BMC Genomics supplementary issue. Built on the great success of the Biocomp,
the IEEE 7th Bioinformatics and Bioengineering was dedicated to explore and develop such synergies to promote
genomics, molecular imaging, bioinformatics, and bionano-info integration that are key components of translational and personalized medicine research, the 27
research papers in this BMC Genomics issue resonate above
theme.
