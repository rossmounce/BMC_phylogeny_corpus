Abstract
Background: The Cleavage Stimulation Factor (CstF) is a required protein complex for
eukaryotic mRNA 3'-processing. CstF interacts with 3'-processing downstream elements (DSEs)
through its 64-kDa subunit, CstF-64; however, the exact nature of this interaction has remained
unclear. We used EST-to-genome alignments to identify and extract large sets of putative 3'processing sites for mRNA from ten metazoan species, including Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris,
Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans. In order to further delineate the details of the
mRNA-protein interaction, we obtained and multiply aligned CstF-64 protein sequences from the
same species.
Results: We characterized the sequence content and specific positioning of putative DSEs across
the range of organisms studied. Our analysis characterized the downstream element (DSE) as two
distinct parts – a proximal UG-rich element and a distal U-rich element. We find that while the Urich element is largely conserved in all of the organisms studied, the UG-rich element is not.
Multiple alignment of the CstF-64 RNA recognition motif revealed that, while it is highly conserved
throughout metazoans, we can identify amino acid changes that correlate with observed variation
in the sequence content and positioning of the DSEs.
Conclusion: Our analysis confirms the early reports of separate U- and UG-rich DSEs. The
correlated variations in protein sequence and mRNA binding sequences provide novel insights into
the interactions between the precursor mRNA and the 3'-processing machinery.

Background
Cleavage and polyadenylation (3'-processing) are essential steps in eukaryotic mRNA formation that can effect
transcript stability and function [1]. Processing of the 3'end occurs on the nascent pre-mRNA as it is transcribed
by RNA polymerase II [2]. Selection of the 3'-processing
site is directed by interactions between the polyadenyla-

tion machinery and cis-acting elements found both
upstream and downstream of the 3'-processing site. The
principle upstream cis-acting element is the highly conserved AAUAAA hexamer, which interacts with Cleavage
and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) and is
found in the majority of metazoan transcripts [1,3]. Putative downstream elements (DSE) include the functional

binding site(s) of the 64-kDa subunit of Cleavage Stimulation Factor (CstF) [4]. Interactions between CPSF and
CstF, as well as polyA polymerase (PAP) and Cleavage Factors I and II (CFI and CFII respectively) are minimal essential requirements for in vitro polyadenylation [3].
The DSE – one or two parts?
Unlike the upstream AAUAAA signal, whose description
has remained largely unchanged since its discovery in
1976 [5], the DSE has had several descriptions. The DSE
was initially characterized by conserved sequence patterns
downstream of the 3'-processing site, resulting in estimated consensus sequences of UUUUCACUGC [6],
GUGUUG [7], and CAYUG [8]. Two interesting early
studies manipulated downstream sequences in test plasmids to produce a bipartite model of the DSE [9], consisting of a proximal UG-rich sequence and a distal U-rich
element that act synergistically [10]. Further characterization of the DSE by deletion or substitution assays revealed
UGUGUUGGAA [11], YGUGUUYY [12], AGGUUUUUU
[13] and UUUUU [14,15] as elements actively involved
with directing the polyadenylation event in specific transcripts and/or test systems. RNA binding assays indicated
that CstF-64 interacts with UUUU with a spacing of 15–30
nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site [4].

cated the hexamers UGUUUU, UGUGUU and UUUUUU
as DSEs [18]. Other studies involving genomic alignments
of mammalian 3'-UTRs or ESTs reported only U-rich elements with no apparent consensus [19], a pentamer with
at least 4 Us or 2GU/U [20], or the heptamer UGUGUGU
[21]. An NMR solution of the vertebrate CstF-64 RRM
structure was used to demonstrate binding to either (GU)4
or (GU)4UG, with a preference for the latter [22,23].
Through the wide variety of studies published to date, no
clear consensus for the DSE has been demonstrated. In
fact, the authors of the computational studies cited above
argued against the existence of a single consensus. Review
articles typically refer to a single UG-/U-rich DSE, in spite
of the early evidence for two independent elements
[9,10].
The present study was initiated to expand our understanding of the 3'-processing regulatory DSE sequences through
a statistical survey that covers large sets of sequences
across a broad phylogenetic range of metazoans. In addition, we also obtained and aligned multiple CstF-64 protein sequences for these same organisms, with the goal of
identifying correlated changes in protein and probable
nucleic acid binding sequences.

Results
The U-rich description was later challenged by SELEX
binding assays performed on CstF-64 by two independent
groups. Beyer et al used complete CstF complexes in cell
extracts, and reported three distinct patterns: AUGCGUand
UCCUCGUCC,
YGUGUYN0–4UUYAYUGYGU,
UUGYUN0–4AUUUACU(U/G)N0–2YCU [16]. Takagaki
and Manley used a recombinant form of CstF-64 that
included only the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and
found preferred binding to a sequence that included both
GU-rich (G(U)2–4G) and U-rich ((GU)2–4) components
[17].

from genomic alignments of D. melanogaster ESTs impli-

Description of the datasets
We constructed a 3'-processing site sequence database
(PACdb [24]) from 13,006,921 ESTs and 10 metazoan
species including Anopheles gambiae (mosquito),
Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Canis familiaris (dog),
Danio rerio (zebrafish), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly),
Gallus gallus (chicken), Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), and Takifugu rubripes
(fugu). The numbers of non-redundant and high quality
polyadenylation sites included in our analysis ranged
from 902 in D. melanogaster to 10,060 in H. sapiens (Table
1). The quality of our training data was inferred from the
presence of the well-documented canonical CPSF binding
hexamer AAUAAA located up to 40 bases upstream of the

processing site. The Positional Word Count (PWC,
described in Methods) distribution for AAUAAA peaks at
position -21 relative to the 3'-processing site in vertebrates
and shifts to -23 in A. gambiae, -22 in D. melanogaster and
-19 in C. elegans (Figure 1). Invertebrates demonstrated a
reduced fidelity for the canonical hexamer compared to
vertebrates, with the AAUAAA hexamer percentage falling
markedly. The percentage of sequences with the AAUAAA
hexamer is consistent with previous reports [20,25] and
ranged from 69.9% to 77.9% for the vertebrates and
51.0% to 61.8% for the invertebrates (Table 1). We also
tested for the presence of the most common variant,
AUUAAA, and finally for any single base subsitution variant of the canonical hexamer (Table 1). Since the measured frequencies are in good agreement with previous
results, we believe that the bulk of our sequences represent bona fide 3'-processing sites.
Positioning patterns of tetramers in the DSE region
Our initial PWC analysis of the DSE region was based on
tetramers. While tetramers cannot unambiguously define
the functional elements, they efficiently indicate positioning trends, as shown below. PWC probabilities for groups
of tetramers with distinct, non-uniform positioning patterns are displayed in Figure 2. We display a subset of the
tetramers, grouping words in the separate panels based on
similar positioning and sequence content. The focus of
the PWC analysis on positioning makes it immediately
clear that there are at least three distinct patterns apparent
downstream of the 3'-processing site.

The three patterns apparent in (Figure 2) can be approximately defined as (A) a UG-rich element positioned 5–10
nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing sites (Figures
2A and 2C), (B) A U-rich element positioned 15–25
nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site (8–20
for C. elegans), and (C) a G-rich element positioned over
20 nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site. PWC
results for all tetramers in the downstream region are
available as a supplemental table [26]. The most robust
pattern, in terms of frequency of occurrence across all
sequences and organisms is the U-rich element (represented in Figure 2B by UUUU and all single base substitution variants), which has a strong positional bias in all
species with maximum frequencies at positions 15 to 25
nt downstream of the processing site for the vertebrates
and 8 to 15 for the invertebrates (Figure 2B.) The maximum positioning of the U-rich tetramers in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae are at positions 15 and 14 nt
respectively and correlates with the 5' shift of the AAUAAA
hexamer also seen in these species(Figure 1). U-rich
tetramers in C. elegans cover a broadened range between 5
to 20 nt downstream of the processing site.
Examination of the data represented in Figures 2A, 2C,
and 3 reveals significant variation in the UG-rich element
between different species. For example, a comparison of
Figures 2A and 2C indicates that variants of the UG-rich
element with a G to C transversion (e.g., UCUG) have the
same positioning indicating an acceptable functional substitution in all vertebrates, but not invertebrates. (A recent

computational study of human 3'-processing sites also
identified the UCUG-like elements [27].) C. elegans apparently does not have a UG-rich element based on the lack
of significant positioning bias in either Figures 2A or 2C.
It is also worth noting that both the positioning and the
relative occurrence of the UG-rich element (without G to
C transversion) changes in the arthropods compared to
the vertebrates (Figures 2A and 3). The G-rich tetramers
(represented by GGGG and all variants with a single G to
A transition in Figures 2D and 3) appear to be a feature of
only the amniote (represented here by mammals and G.
gallus) 3'-processing sites.
Delineating the DSE sequence content
While a tetramer-based PWC analysis clearly shows the
positioning dependency of various sequence words, as
noted above, it does not unambiguously describe the
functional elements that produce the observed word distributions. Detailed delineation of RNA regulatory motifs
is non-trivial, however, as while RNA elements are often

defined by both sequence content and positioning, the
standard computational pattern detection tools [28] typically consider only sequence content, with little or no
weight given to positioning. Pattern recognition algorithms (e.g., MEME or the Gibbs Sampler) typically identify motifs as the patterns that most significantly stand out
from the background implied by the surrounding
sequence. One exception to this is the Improbizer [29],
which models positioning according to a normal distribution.
While this is an improvement, examination of Figures 2
and 3 indicates that a normal distribution will only
roughly approximate the observed positioning. We analyzed the 80 nucleotides downstream of our putative 3'processing sites with a number of tools, including the
Gibbs Recursive Sampler [30], MEME [31], the Improbizer [29], and a hexamer-based PWC analysis. Where
necessary, we post-processed the results to include delineation of positioning distribution. We present the results of

the Gibbs Sampler analysis here, whereas the other results
are available in the online supplement [26].
The Gibbs Sampler operates probabilistically, and can
produce variable results upon repeated restarts. In addition, the large size of a number of our data sets (e.g.,
human, rat, and mouse) necessitated the selection of a
random subset of the training sequences in order for the
program to run in a reasonable time. A representative
sampling of the Gibbs Sampler results is shown in Figure
4, using Sequence Logos [32] to represent of the sequence
content, and line plots to represent the positioning distribution. These results are presented with the caveat that we
specifically selected results that most closely reproduce
the positioning patterns observed in the PWC analysis.
Results from at least ten independent runs of each data set
(with parameters as described in Methods) are available
in our online supplement [26].
The Gibbs Sampler routinely identified the UG-rich element in all species except C. elegans (Figure 4), with positioning distributions often consistent with the patterns
identified for UG-rich sequences in the PWC tetramer
analysis (Figure 2). However, in several cases (e.g., ele-

ments 1 and 2 for D. melanogaster in Figure 4) the positioning distribution appeared to be a mixture of both the
UG- and U-rich elements, likely indicating an overly
"greedy" pattern description that encompassed both elements. Characterization of the U-rich element proved
more elusive. Since our sequences are, in general, very Urich, we could only identify U-rich motifs through either
the use of a prior specification or by reducing the weight
of the input sequence set in determining the background
model. With these adjustments, we were able to characterize U-rich elements, such as those shown as motif 2 for
nearly all organisms in Figure 4.
Consistent with the PWC tetramer analysis (Figure 2D),
the Gibbs Sampler frequently identified far downstream
G-rich motifs (e.g., motif 3 for C. familiaris in Figure 4),
but only for amniotes. In contrast, the fish and arthropod
far downstream regions produced an A-rich element, such
as shown as motif 3 for D. rerio, A. gambiae, and C. elegans.
Determining the DSE motif length
The Gibbs Sampler can vary the motif size (as can the
Improbizer and MEME), selecting the length that produces the most statistically significant result. The Gibbs

hinge region (partial); yellow shaded = helix C stabilizing interactions [22]; boxed blue = residues most affected by RNA binding, according to NMR relaxation [23].

Sampler and Improbizer consistently returned motifs
between 4 and 7 nucleotides in length, whereas MEME
typically identified motifs between 12 and 15 nucleotides.
Examination of the MEME results (available in the supplement [26]) revealed that the extended motifs resembled a
concatenation of the UG- and U-rich elements that was
dominated by either a strong UG-rich component in the
first half or strong U-rich component in the second half.
In addition, we also tested the fragmentation option of
the Gibbs Sampler (data not shown), which allows the
detection of non-contiguous patterns, under the constraint that the positioning between blocks must be fixed

(or nearly so). Nearly all runs of all sequence sets resulted
in contiguous motifs.
Analysis of the CstF-64 RRM multiple alignment
The CstF-64 RRM (or RNA binding domain) follows the
well-conserved fold structure found in many other RNAbinding proteins (reviewed in [33]). Residues of β-strands
one and three make up canonical motifs of RNP2 and
RNP1 respectively, and are part of the larger RRM structure
β1α1β2β3α2β4 (Figure 5). The vertebrate CstF-64 RRM is
terminated by an additional α-helix (helix C) that lies
across the β-sheet, occluding the projected RNA binding

site [22]. The residues for the entire region spanning R7
through G105 (the end of helix C) are completely conserved in vertebrates, except for the single residue substitution of P41 → L41 in fish. This near perfect conservation
does not extend to invertebrates where numerous residue
substitutions can be found. Across the same span of residues, percent identities between A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans and the vertebrate sequence are
72.7%, 66.7%, and 56.6%, respectively. (In addition, C.
elegans has two insertions of 1 and 2 amino acids, respectively.) The substitutions are not uniformly distributed. If
we restrict our analysis to only the β-sheet (highlighted in
blue in Figure 5), the percent identities increase to 91.7%,
83.3%, and 79.1%, respectively. In contrast, the fifteen
amino acids in helix C are much more variable, with percent identities of 33.3%, 33.3%, and 40%, respectively,
and C. elegans also has a single amino acid insertion.
We further restricted our analysis to the amino acids previously identified as contributing to interactions between
helix C and the β-sheet (F19, F61, N91, N97, E100, L101, and
L104 [22]) or between the β-sheet and bound RNA (G21,
S44, F45, R46, L47, D50, T53, K55, K57, Y59, F61, C62, E63, and
D90 [23]). In Table 2, we list the subset for which changes
are observed in the invertebrates.
While the percent identity of helix C is higher in C. elegans
than for either A. gambiae or D. melanogaster, the substitutions in C. elegans are arguably more significant. ChouFasman α-helix and β-sheet propensities indicate that the
S94 → G94, E95 → G95 and K102 → G102 substitutions possibly prevent a stable helix C from forming in C. elegans. In
addition, the vertebrate helix C includes three conserved
lysines, all of which are oriented with their side chains
pointing away from the β-sheet in the absence of bound
RNA [22]. All of the lysines are replaced with non-charged
residues in C. elegans, while A. gambiae and D. melanogaster have identical K96, a conservative K98 → R98 substitution, but a non-charged substitution at residue 102.
Extended multiple alignment
A multiple alignment of the complete sequences for the
group of organisms analyzed is available as a supplement.
The complete CstF-64 protein sequence consists of five
distinct regions. The N-terminal (approximately 110 residues in vertebrates) CstF-64 RRM and helix C are highly

conserved. In addition, the "hinge" region of CstF-64 (residues 110–210) which interacts with both CstF-77 and
symplekin [34] is also highly conserved. The hinge region
is followed by a low-complexity Proline-Glycine rich
region (residues 210–410). The 12 contiguous MEAR(A/
G) repeats (residues 410–470) including the interspersed
RGG motifs, are weakly conserved outside of amniotes, if
present at all. The remaining C-terminal residues (514–
577) are highly conserved, reportedly reflecting the interaction between CstF-64 and the transcriptional coactivator PC4 [35].

Discussion
UG- and U-rich signals are distinct DSEs
Unlike the previous computational studies of the metazoan DSE cited above, our analysis explicitly includes
characterization of the positioning biases relative to the
3'-processing site. While it is possible that the U/UG-rich
DSEs comprise one motif, several aspects of our analysis
lead us to the conclusion that our results are consistent
with the presence of distinct UG- and U-rich elements as
proposed by McDevitt et al. [9] and Gil and Proudfoot
[10]. (This notably excludes C. elegans, which has no evidence of a UG-rich component.) While the positioning
distributions of the U- and UG-rich sequences have considerable overlap, it is clear from Figures 2 and 3 that they
are distinct. Previous experimental studies have occasionally produced longer putative elements that included both
UG- and U-rich portions (e.g., [12] and [16]), however, if
the functional element was a single longer element, we
would expect UG- and U-rich positioning distributions
with a common shape, but offset in position. In contrast,
we observe distinct distributions that are more consistent
with two independent elements separated by variable
spacing. (It is worth noting that nothing in our analysis
precludes these elements overlapping in an individual
sequence.) Finally, the typical separation that we observe
between the vertebrate UG- and U-rich elements (approximately 15 nucleotides between the UG-rich and U-rich
positioning peaks in Figures 2 and 4) would imply a significantly longer RRM binding site than has been previously observed [33].

Our analysis indicates that the U-rich element is more
prevalent than the UG-rich element in all species studied,
and the sequence content and relative positioning of the

Page 8 of 13

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:55

U-rich element in all vertebrate species is consistent with
previous in vitro polyadenylation assays [15] and CstF-64pre-RNA UV cross linking studies [4], as well as the recent
NMR studies of CstF-64 [22,23]. Somewhat paradoxically,
the sequence content of the UG-rich element in the vertebrates is consistent with the results of the CstF-64 SELEX
binding experiments [16,17]. Implications of these differences are discussed below. We believe that the historical
difficulties in clear delineation of these elements are likely
due to a convergence of several mitigating factors, including the degenerate sequence content of both the UG- and
U-rich elements, significant overlap in both the positioning (Figures 2 and 4) and sequence content (Figure 4) of
the two elements, and a typical emphasis on only
sequence content in computational investigations.
An interaction model for the CstF-64 RRM with precursor
mRNA
Our comparative studies of the variation in the primary
protein sequence of the CstF-64 RRM have highlighted
differences in potentially critical residues that correlate
with changes in the apparent binding sites identified by
our statistical analysis. These correlations put us in a position to speculate on the mechanism of interaction
between the RRM of CstF-64 and the downstream region
of the precursor mRNAs. We hypothesize that the data
presented here, in conjunction with previous published
work, supports a model in which the proximal UG-rich
element is involved in the necessary displacement of helix
C [22] that exposes the β-sheet for binding to the distal Urich element.
Evidence for an interaction between the β-sheet and the
U-rich element
UV-crosslinking of CstF-64 [4] revealed sequence content
and positioning very similar to the U-rich element we
describe in Figures 2 and 4. The NMR structures of the vertebrate CstF-64 RRM indicate that the binding pocket targets the UU di-nucleotide and that the larger UG dinucleotide is discriminated against based on size [22].
Using specific oligomers, it was also shown that the (GU)4
sequence has a two-fold weaker interaction with the CstF
than does the (GU)4UG sequence [23]. U-rich DSEs are a
ubiquitous pattern of all organisms studied here, including C. elegans. The beta strands that form the RNA-binding
sheet are also nearly perfectly conserved. The observed
changes (F45 → L45 in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, F45
→ I45 in C. elegans, C62 → I62 in C. elegans, A86 → T86 in D.
melanogaster, A86 → I86 in C. elegans) are either conservative in side-chain substitution or oriented such that the
side-chains face away from the binding pocket surface. In
contrast, helix C displays considerable variation, as
described below.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/55

Evidence for an interaction between helix C and the UGrich element
The NMR studies showed that in the absence of RNA,
helix C is stably bound to residues in the RRM binding
pocket, thereby occluding it [22]. The residues responsible
for this interaction are absolutely conserved in the vertebrate sequences we have examined. Significant changes
found in the invertebrates likely disrupt or weaken the βsheet to helix C interaction. These differences correlate
with changes in the statistical patterns we identified for
DSEs. Specifically, in C. elegans, ten of the sixteen helix C
residues are changed from the vertebrate consensus, and
many of these differences are non-conservative (Table 2).
This correlates with complete absence of the proximal
UG-rich element. In D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, the
change in apparent affinity (Figures 2, 3, and 4) is more
subtle, e.g., the UCUG-like variant of the vertebrate UGrich element is absent. Several significant changes in helix
C residues can be correlated with this change, including
an N97 → S97 substitution that could disrupt the hydrogen
bonding to N91 predicted in the vertebrate structure. In
addition, both D. melanogaster and A. gambiae are missing
K104, which is conserved in vertebrates. According to the
NMR structure [22], the K104 side chain is directed away
from the beta sheet, an orientation that would make possible interactions between the charged amino side-chain
and the RNA backbone. The observed correlations in protein sequence and apparent RNA affinity imply that helix
C plays an important role in defining the DSE region. The
importance of helix C is consistent with a forthcoming
study of the in vitro binding affinities of variant forms of
recombinant CstF-64 (R. Monarez, C.C. MacDonald, pers.
comm.).
What is the state of helix C during transcription?
The conformation of helix C during transcription is currently unknown, however it must be unwound or displaced prior to RNA binding [22]. If helix C was already
displaced during transcription, the RNA binding process
would be a single event. Although a single step binding
process cannot be ruled out at this time, we find it to be
unlikely as it would fail to explain the presence of both
proximal UG-rich and distal U-rich elements. We speculate that helix C is structurally intact while scanning the
nascent RNA and that a preliminary interaction is
required for displacement. As described above, differences
in helix C primary sequence correlate with changes in the
pattern, or even existence, of the proximal UG-rich element. In addition, assuming a 5'-to-3' processivity, the
proximal positioning of the UG-rich element is consistent
with a role in the displacement of helix C that exposes the
beta sheet for binding to the more prevalent distal U-rich
element. If the model we propose is accurate, and CstF-64
is responsible for interactions with both DSEs, it provides
an explanation for the discrepancy between sequence

preferences observed in SELEX [16,17] and cross-linking
studies. It remains an open question why SELEX measurements would favor the initial interaction with the UG-rich
element.
C. elegans, polycistronic transcripts and the proximal UGrich element
The distinct changes in both the CstF-64 RRM sequence
and apparent binding affinity in C. elegans are not surprising, given the known differences in 3'-processing. Approximately 15% of the genes in C. elegans are expressed in
polycistronic transcripts [36], which are processed into
monocistronic transcripts in a reaction that includes both
3'-processing and trans-splicing of a leader RNA to the
downstream portion of the precursor [37]. Despite the
peculiar nature of these transcripts, they are not sufficient
by themselves to explain the absence of the proximal UGrich element. The loss of the proximal UG-rich element is
a transcriptome wide change and therefore likely reflects
the RNA binding properties of the C. elegans CstF-64.
The MEAR(A/G) repeats are not critical for UG- or U-rich
DSE interactions
Previous reports speculated on a role for the MEAR(A/G)
repeats in the CstF-64 pre-mRNA interaction [16]. Our
analyses counter-indicate direct involvement of the
MEAR(A/G) repeats in recognition of either the UG- or Urich DSEs, since the MEAR(A/G) repeats are greatly
reduced or absent in fish species (see the supplement), but
the UG- and U-rich patterns are essentially unchanged
from other vertebrates (Figures 2 and 3). In addition,
SELEX studies that included only the N-terminal region of
CstF-64 (approximately 130 residues) resulted in both
UG- and U-rich binding patterns [17]. Although the function of the MEAR(A/G) like repeats is currently unknown,
the striking reduction in fish and the invertebrates correlates with the loss of the G-rich signal in the far (greater
than 20 nt) downstream region (Figure 2D). G-rich elements have been implicated as auxiliary 3'-processing elements, interacting with heteronuclear RNP complexes
[38-41], acting as transcriptional pause sites [42], or forming a secondary structure based on the presence of Gquadruplexes [20].

Conclusion
In our analysis of 39,578 high-quality 3'-processing sites
spanning 10 genomes, we present the U/UG-rich DSE as
two parts: a proximal UG-rich element with approximate
positioning 5 to 10 nt downstream of the processing site
and a distal U-rich element 15 to 25 nt from the processing site. Our results indicate that historical difficulties in
classifying these elements are likely a consequence of their
similarity in both sequence content and positioning. The
distinct nature and positioning of the DSEs leads us to
consider a model where the CstF-64 RRM interacts with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/55

both the UG- and U-rich elements separately and sequentially. Specifically, we hypothesize that the proximal UGrich element contributes to the displacement of helix C,
which exposes the RRM beta-sheet for subsequent binding
to the distal U-rich element. While this model is speculative, it is consistent with both our results and previous
studies.
Confirmation of this model through site directed mutagenesis or other techniques may lead to a better understanding of how the DSE region directs cleavage site
choice and ultimately its role in alternate polyadenylation.

Methods
Extraction of polyadenylation sites
Previously we constructed a 3'-processing site sequence
database (PACdb [24]) from 13,006,921 ESTs and 10 species (A. gambiae, C. elegans, C. familiaris, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, G. gallus, H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus,
and T. rubripes. The number of EST sequences available for
each species ranged between 25,850 for T. rubripes and
6,002,331 for H. sapiens (see supplement). ESTs that
mapped to a genomic location were scored by our discriminant function for polyadenylation evidence (described
below). The number of total EST alignments that passed
our discriminant thresholds were variable and ranged
from 2,301 in C. elegans to 514,894 in H. sapiens. The
polyadenylation sites implied by these ESTs were further
grouped into unique genomic locations (± 25 nt) to
account for sloppy polyadenylation and/or sequence
data. Condensing the EST data in this manner reduced the
number of implied 3'-processing sites to a range extending
from a low of 1,003 in C. elegans to a high of 55,828 in H.
sapiens. The average number of supporting ESTs at each
unique genomic 3'-processing varied significantly
between different organisms, introducing a bias that, if
uncorrected, significantly increases the statistical weighting of rare sites in the more heavily sampled transcriptomes, e.g., M. musculus and H. sapiens. To correct for this
bias, we used the mean number of supporting ESTs per
unique 3'-processing site in each species as a minimum
EST threshold. The final number of polyadenylation sites
included in our analysis after applying redundancy
thresholds ranged from 902 in D. melanogaster to 10,060
in H. sapiens (Table 1).
PolyA discriminant function
Characterization of degenerate regulatory sequences is
critically dependent on a high quality training set, therefore we developed a discriminant function that selects
putative 3'-processing sites with both strong evidence of
polyA tails on the EST, and absence of genomic A-rich
regions that could signal a mispriming of the polyT
primer used to generate cDNA clones. Internal priming is

often addressed by setting a cutoff for the number of adenosine bases allowable in the genomic sequence flanking
the putative 3'-processing site; this is a good estimate of
primer stability, however, it does not take into account
positional effects of mismatches. Since cDNA generation
involves an enzyme binding/initiation step, mismatches
to the 3' end of the polyT primer are critical and should be
included in the scoring function. We modeled the combined effect of primer thermostability and reverse transcriptase processivity by incorporating an exponential
weighting (according to position) into our function. We
extracted 20 nucleotides downstream of all putative 3'processing sites, from both the EST and genomic
sequence. EST sequence was scored for likelihood of being
a true 3'-end, whereas genomic sequence was scored for
likelihood of false priming. Each sequence position (x)
relative to the 3' processing site was scored independently
(position score, eq. 1).

The scale parameter β was estimated to be 12 and reflects
our estimate of the average number of A nucleotides

where I is an indicator variable, equal to 1 if the argument
is true, and 0 otherwise. Total score outputs of our discriminant function ranged from 0 (no As) to 9.7718 (all As).
Thresholds used for high quality 3'-processing sites (see
supplement) required a minimum total score of 5.5 for
polyadenylation (EST sequence) and a maximum score of
4.5 (genomic sequence) for internal priming.
Positional Word Count Analysis
Previous studies have shown that mRNA regulatory
sequences can be characterized not only by sequence content, but also by relative positioning to a functional site,
such as the 3'-processing site [18,20,21,27]. Our principal
method is positional word counting (PWC), in which all
sequence words of a given length (tetramers and hexamers
in this work) are counted, recording both the occurrence
and the position with respect to the 3'-processing site.
When normalized, PWC results in a frequency for each kmer at each position and can be interpreted as a probability of occurrence, conditional on the occurrence of a 3'processing site at position 0. Putative functional
sequences are identified as k-mers with statistically significant non-uniform positioning with respect to the 3'processing site. We interpret different k-mers with similar

positioning as evidence of acceptable substitutions in the
functional element. Positional word frequencies (pwf)
were calculated as the fraction of sequences with word (w)
at position (i) (eq. 3).

pwfi =

∑ wi

n
where wi = word at position i
and n = number of sequences

( 3)

The selection of the length of the k-mers to analyze
involves a trade-off between the statistical power gained
by the large numbers that can be counted for short words
and the more complete motif description that can be
obtained from longer words. The size of our data sets
ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand sequences,
making tetramers a reasonable size choice.
Motif finding
The DSE region spanning 80 nt downstream of the cleavage site was examined by the Gibbs Recursive Sampler
[30], MEME [31] and Improbizer [29]. From each species,
500 3'-processing site sequences were randomly selected
without replacement. As a position independent control,
500 sequences were generated from a species specific
trained 0th order model and run in parallel. Several prelimiary runs were performed for each program to define
optimal settings. At least 10 independent production runs
were performed for each dataset. The Gibbs Recursive
Sampler extracted 3 variable length motifs using command line options "-E 3 -W 0 -F -t -n -r -i 200 OS 200 -d
1,5,10,2,5,10,3,5,10". Motifs described in the "optimal"
output section were used in order to maximize the
number of example motifs tabulated. The MEME program
was run a beowulf cluster using options "-dna -mod oops
-nmotifs 3 -text -p52 -maxsize 1000000". Improbizer runs
used options "numMotifs = 3 background = l maxOcc = l"
and for additional control runs the "controlRun = on"
parameter was set. Motif sequence information was gathered from all three programs via perl script and used to
make sequence logo [32] images with the WebLogo script
[43]. Custom perl scripts were written to collect and graph
positioning from the Gibbs Recursive Sampler, Improbizer, and MEME output files.

with CAP3 [45]. Multiple alignment of CstF-64 was
