Abstract
Background: Dof proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors that contain a
particular class of zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. Members of this family have been found to play
diverse roles in gene regulation of processes restricted to the plants. The completed genome
sequences of rice and Arabidopsis constitute a valuable resource for comparative genomic analyses,
since they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms. In
this framework, the identification of phylogenetic relationships among Dof proteins in these species
is a fundamental step to unravel functionality of new and yet uncharacterised genes belonging to
this group.
Results: We identified 30 different Dof genes in the rice Oryza sativa genome and performed a
phylogenetic analysis of a complete collection of the 36-reported Arabidopsis thaliana and the rice
Dof transcription factors identified herein. This analysis led to a classification into four major
clusters of orthologous genes and showed gene loss and duplication events in Arabidopsis and rice,
that occurred before and after the last common ancestor of the two species.
Conclusions: According to our analysis, the Dof gene family in angiosperms is organized in four
major clusters of orthologous genes or subfamilies. The proposed clusters of orthology and their
further analysis suggest the existence of monocot specific genes and invite to explore their
functionality in relation to the distinct physiological characteristics of these evolutionary groups.

Background
Detailed analyses of completely sequenced genomes
reveal that a significant percentage of the encoded proteins corresponds to transcription factors (TF). These can
be classified into several gene families according to the
presence of particular DNA binding domains [1–8]. However, the analysis of a particular transcription factor
should be done in the context of the family, to which it
belongs, taking into account that functional redundancy
is a very frequent event within eukaryotic TFs [9]. Moreo-

ver, transcription factors operate in complex networks
based on protein-protein interactions and are often organized into regulatory cascades. Due to their crucial role in
the regulation of gene expression, the study of TFs is of
outstanding interest, and for the reasons stated above it
should be ideally done from a genomic perspective
[10,11].

[12–15] have been recently obtained, each constituting a
model plant for a dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species respectively. In both the Arabidopsis and rice
genomes several groups of plant-specific TF have been
described that are of great interest, since they may be
involved in the regulation of events restricted to the plant
kingdom [11]. One of these groups is the Dof (DNA binding with one finger) family, a particular class of zinc finger
domain TFs [16,17] characterized by a conserved region
of 50 amino acids with a C2-C2 finger structure, associated
to a basic region, that binds specifically to DNA sequences
with a 5'-T/AAAAG-3' core [18]. Dof proteins have been
reported to participate in the regulation of gene expression in processes such as seed storage protein synthesis in
developing endosperm [19,20], light regulation of genes
involved in carbohydrate metabolism [21], plant defense
mechanisms [22], seed germination [23–25], gibberellin
response in post-germinating aleurone [26,27], auxin
response [28–30] and stomata guard cell specific gene regulation [31].
Because hierarchy organization of genes reflects an
ancient process of gene duplication and divergence, many
of the theoretical and analytical tools of the phylogenetic
systematics can be utilized in comparative genomics [5].
Here, this analytical approach, successfully applied in Arabidopsis [32], was used to perform a phylogenetic characterization of all the Arabidopsis and rice Dof transcription
factors. As a first step we have revised and annotated all
the rice Dof genes and compared them with those from
Arabidopsis. This phylogenetic analysis, led to the definition of four clusters of rice and Arabidopsis orthologous
genes and to identify the minimum complement of Dof
genes that were present in the angiosperm common
ancestor. We also discuss on the relevance to recognize
groups of orthology as the basis for further characterization of Dof genes of unknown function.

Results
Identification of a comprehensive set of Dof proteins from
rice and Arabidopsis
Rice Dof genes
Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and O. sativa ssp. indica draft
genome sequences were simultaneously released [13,14]
and more recently the high quality finished sequences of
O. sativa ssp. japonica chromosomes 1 and 4 [33,34]. We
analyzed both genomes in order to assemble a complete
and non-redundant set of rice Dof genes. The nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences of the Dof domains
were used to perform independent Blast searches [35]
through several rice databases: Rice TIGR db, DDBJ and
TMRI Rice Genome Database (for the japonica genome)
and the NCBI O. sativa BLAST page (for the indica
genome). A total of 30 non-redundant Dof transcription
factors were identified in japonica and indica. Among

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/17

them, twenty-seven sequences were almost identical in
both species, while two japonica genes were not clearly
identified in indica and one indica gene was not clearly
identified in japonica. To explore this discrepancy we used
the complete sequences of the japonica genes, partially
detected in indica, to perform a BLAST search in the indica
database and vice versa. Portions of the two genes partially
detected in indica (OsDof-5 and OsDof-20) were found in
the corresponding database. In the case of OsDof-5, a
DNA fragment 3' to the Dof domain was identified as a
perfect match to the japonica gene used as the query
sequence. This fragment corresponds to a terminal region
of a short contig assembly (AAAA01006178.1). The other
indica sequence, OsDof-20, was found within a misassembled contig (AAAA01062012.1) as a completely homologous match to the japonica sequence. For the indica gene
not clearly identified in japonica (OsDof-30), a DNA fragment 5' to the Dof domain was identified as a perfect
match against the indica gene used as the query sequence.
This fragment corresponds to a terminal region of a 6 kbcontig assembly at the TMRI rice genome project
(CL037947.70). Since none of the indica and TMRI
japonica contigs have been mapped to a rice genome, we
were unable to provide the chromosome location for
OsDof-29 and OsDof-30 in Table 1. Gene structure and
the corresponding deduced amino acid sequences for all
the indica Dof TFs and eight from japonica were processed
with the help of the RiceGAAS annotation system. The
remaining japonica genes were obtained from the rice
TIGR annotation database. According to the predicted
structures, approximately half of the rice Dof TFs (16)
contains one or more introns (Table 1).
Arabidopsis Dof genes
A non-redundant and complete compilation of the Arabidopsis Dof genes was obtained from the At TIGR db and
MIPS MATDB databases. A total of 36 annotated TFs
belonging to the Dof gene family were extracted from
these sources (Table 2). In a previous publication, Riechmann [11] indicated the existence of 37 Dof encoding
genes in Arabidopsis. However, the presence of several
stop codons within the ORF of At1g65935 suggests that it
is most probably a pseudogene [36] and was therefore
excluded from our analysis. Structural examination of the
remaining 36 genes revealed the presence of introns in
half of the sequences, generally placed upstream of the
Dof domain. Of those, 15 contained just one intron
(Table 2).
Phylogenetic analysis and recognition of Dof families in
rice and Arabidopsis
In order to evaluate the evolutionary relationship among
the rice Dof proteins, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on their DNA binding domain sequences (Figure
1). Pair-wise amino acid similarities were higher than

50%, a threshold conventionally used to classify a group
of genes as a gene family [5,37]. Consistent with the unrooted tree obtained by the neighbor-joining algorithm
(Figure 2B) four groups were defined (a, b, c and d), two
of which were further divided into subgroups supported
by the presence and position of introns (Table 1), bootstrapping values and the occurrence of common protein
motifs outside of the Dof domain (Figure 3 and Table 3).
An equivalent phylogenetic analysis of Dof domain
sequences was done in Arabidopsis. The un-rooted tree
inferred from the neighbor-joining analysis in displayed
in Figure 2C. Our results show that the Arabidopsis Dof
gene family can be organized into four groups or subfamilies (A, B, C and D). Groups B, C and D were further
subdivided into subgroups, according the same criteria
applied in the analysis of the rice Dof proteins. In order to

detect putative duplicated genes in the Arabidopsis
genome, we examined sequence redundancy between
pairs of closely related Dof proteins. Using the Arabidopsis Redundancy Viewer (MATDB), we found ten pairs of
genes (Table 1) on genomic regions associated with major
genomic duplication events that occurred in Arabidopsis
[38–40].
Comparison of the Arabidopsis and rice Dof proteins and
determination of orthology relationships
To evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the Dof
gene family, we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of the 66 Arabidopsis and rice sequences to obtain a
joint tree (Figure 2A). The tree topology, as well as the
group and subgroup organization, resembled those from
the rice and Arabidopsis individual trees (Figures 2B and
2C). The tree presented in Figure 2A identified putative

genomic redundancies (Table 2). Just three genes were
found in unexpected locations in the combined tree. A
possible reason for this fact could be the presence of an
apparent orthologous from the other species, generating a
better support for the new location (i.e. OsDof-3 and
At1g07640). On the other hand, relocation of At5g65590
seems to be an artifact of sequence similarities across the
Dof domain, since according to additional information of
the conserved motifs outside of the Dof domain, location
within MCOG Bb is more consistent (Figures 2A and 3).

determined for each of the defined groups in Figure 2A.
Moreover, an additional tree derived from the MEME

subgroup organization as the tree displayed in Figure 2A

Discussion
Comparative genomic analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis
Dof gene families
The main objective of this phylogenetic study was to identify putative orthologous and paralogous Dof genes,
orthologs being defined as genes in different genomes
that have been created by the splitting of taxonomic lineages, and paralogs as genes in the same genome created by
gene duplication events [5,43]. Paralogs usually display
different functions, while orthologs may retain the same
function [1]. Distinguishing orthologous from paralogous
genes is essential to comparative genomics. Indeed, the
fundamental activity of comparative genomics is to track

the presence, structural characteristics, function, and map
position of orthologs in multiple genomes [5].
Considering the extensive annotation work done in Arabidopsis since the release of its sequenced genome [3],
together with the analysis of rice sequences carried out in
this study, we assume that most (or possibly all) of the
Dof transcription factors from these species are represented in the 66 sequences documented (36 from Arabidopsis and 30 from rice). Our analyses of these sequences
defined four MCOGs in rice and Arabidopsis (Figure 2A).
Within each MCOG, particular clusters of paralogous and
orthologous genes were identified, showing ancestral

duplication and gene loss events. These results were also
corroborated through the construction of a rice/Arabidopsis reconciled tree [5,44] (data not shown). The tree presented (Figure 2A) showed considerable bootstrapping
support for many of the defined groups and subgroups,
but several clusters remained with poor supporting values.
This fact was an expectable consequence of performing a
study like the present with a 50 amino acid-length
sequence, a constraint imposed by the lack of sequence
conservation among Dof proteins outside this domain.
However, it is worth to mention that most of the groups
and subgroups defined were supported by additional criteria, such as gene structure and the presence of common
protein motifs outside the Dof domain detected in the
MEME analysis (Figure 3 & Table 3).
The Dof family in angiosperms: Rice (monocot) and
Arabidopsis (dicot) specific genes
Although Dof proteins are exclusively found in the plant
kingdom, searching EST databases allows to track the
occurrence of Dof-encoding sequences from the unicellular algae Clamydomonas, to mosses and gymnosperms,
indicating an ancient origin and the possibility of diversification throughout plant evolution. In this respect, comparisons of Dof repertoires from different organisms may
give important insights into the evolutionary history of
the family.

Assuming our compilation to be a complete catalog of the
rice and Arabidopsis Dof transcription factors, we might
postulate the existence of rice and Arabidopsis specific
Dof genes, and by extension, putative monocot- and
dicot-specific Dof genes. The genes belonging to Arabidopsis cluster C3 and rice cluster d3 (Figure 2A) might represent such situation, since each group has no apparent
counterpart in the other species. To characterize these
events further, we performed global searches (against
whole plant nucleotide and protein sequences) with all
the members of the two subfamilies (C3, d3). For this purpose, query sequences used in BLAST searches were
selected outside the Dof domain, since this structure is
highly conserved across the whole plant kingdom [36].
The sequence producing the lowest e value with the C3
queries corresponds to the Pisum sativum ERDP gene
(Accession BAA85655.1) followed by maize PBF and its
orthologs from barley and wheat. PBF-like genes are Dof
proteins known to participate in important regulatory
processes of gene expression in the seeds of monocots
[19,20]. This suggests an orthologous relationship
between the Arabidopsis (dicot) subfamily C3 and monocot PBF-like genes. This hypothesis is in agreement with
our own experimental results, where At4g21080 shows
seed specific expression (unpublished results).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/17

BLAST searches with the putative monocot-specific d3
group identified two maize genes as the only sequences
that were closely related. The maize genes Dof1 and Dof2
[21] are likely to be orthologous to OsDof-22/OsDof-16.
These findings suggest the possible existence of monocotspecific genes (i.e. d3 related), while no obvious dicot-specific genes were found based on the Arabidopsis
sequences. Further analysis of Dof evolution will require
the completion of genome projects currently underway
and the isolation of Dof sequences, not available at
present, from a broader spectrum of plant species.
Duplication events, gene function and phylogenic
relationship
When comparing multi-gene families between species it is
a common event to find several genes in one species that
are collectively orthologs of a single gene in the other,
indicating recent duplications exclusive to the former. In
this situation, knowledge of gene function of certain
members allows the confirmation of paralogous and
orthologous relationships, otherwise difficult to infer
merely from tree topologies. This is the case of DAG1
(At3g61850) and DAG2 (At2g46590), two closely related
Arabidopsis genes (Figure 2A and Table 2). These two
genes, display a high degree of sequence similarity and
show identical patterns of expression, indicating a potential case of functional redundancy. Nevertheless, a systematic analysis of mutant variants demonstrated that they
perform opposite functions in the control of seed germination [23–25]. Thus, DAG1 and DAG2 are clearly nonredundant and paralogous genes produced after a recent
duplication event.

Conversely, phylogenetic relationship could help in the
identification of gene function. Considering the case
described above, a third gene (At4g24060) seems to be a
paralog of the DAG1-DAG2 branch, resulting in a cluster
that appears to be ortholog to the rice gene cluster
(OsDof-9/OsDof-18) present in MCOG Cc. Remarkably,
OsDof-9 and OsDof-18 were first reported after their isolation from rice seed aleurone layers [27] and it will be
interesting to investigate whether they have evolved into
antagonistic functions in germination as their Arabidopsis
corresponding paralogs.
Considering genome size differences in Arabidopsis (115
Mb) and rice (420 Mb), it is worth mentioning that 36
Dof genes were identified in the former, whereas only 30
in the later, in agreement with important duplication
events in the origin of the Arabidopsis genome. In this
context, establishing phylogenetic relationships is of outstanding interest to unravel gene functionality.

Conclusions
We identified the probable full complement of Dof genes
in rice and Arabidopsis, which are representative of the
major evolutionary lineages in the angiosperms: the
monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. Phylogenetic
analyses resulted in the identification of four major clusters of orthologous genes that contain members belonging to both species, and that must have been represented
in their common ancestor before the taxonomic splitting
of the angiosperms. Recognition of species-specific subgroups within these clusters led to explore the existence of
monocot and dicot unique genes. We performed exhaustive searches in plant databases that allowed the detection
of likely orthologs to dicot-specific genes, while no clear
orthologs to monocot-specific-genes could be identified.
In view of important genome duplication events leading
to gene redundancy in the history of plant diversification,
a combination of available functional data with phylogenetically inferred relationships are essential to effectively
establish conserved and diverged roles in present day
genes of evolutionary unrelated plant species.

Methods
Our collection of non-redundant Arabidopsis Dof proteins was gathered from three different and interconnected sources: the Munich Information Center for
Protein Sequences database (MIPS, MATDB; http://
mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db), the Institute for Genomic
Research, (At TIGR db, http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/
ath1/index.shtml) and the Regulatory Gene Initiative on
Arabidopsis (REGIA) European project. Information
regarding the gene structure was obtained from the At
TIGR db. Redundancy analyses of the Arabidopsis
genomic regions comprising Dof genes were carried out
with the Redundancy Viewer at the MATDB.
