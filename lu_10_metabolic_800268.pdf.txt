Abstract
Background: Rhodospirillum centenum is a photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium that favors growth in an
anoxygenic, photosynthetic N2-fixing environment. It is emerging as a genetically amenable model organism for
molecular genetic analysis of cyst formation, photosynthesis, phototaxis, and cellular development. Here, we present
an analysis of the genome of this bacterium.
Results: R. centenum contains a singular circular chromosome of 4,355,548 base pairs in size harboring 4,105 genes. It
has an intact Calvin cycle with two forms of Rubisco, as well as a gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
(PEPC) for mixotrophic CO2 fixation. This dual carbon-fixation system may be required for regulating internal carbon
flux to facilitate bacterial nitrogen assimilation. Enzymatic reactions associated with arsenate and mercuric
detoxification are rare or unique compared to other purple bacteria. Among numerous newly identified signal
transduction proteins, of particular interest is a putative bacteriophytochrome that is phylogenetically distinct from a
previously characterized R. centenum phytochrome, Ppr. Genes encoding proteins involved in chemotaxis as well as a
sophisticated dual flagellar system have also been mapped.
Conclusions: Remarkable metabolic versatility and a superior capability for photoautotrophic carbon assimilation is
evident in R. centenum.
Background
Rhodospirillum centenum (also known as Rhodocista centenaria) is a thermotolerant α-1 proteobacterium that is
closely related to species of the Azospirillum genus [1-4].
R. centenum is one of the few known thermotolerant purple bacteria species. It has an optimal growth temperature of 44°C, and is capable of differentiating into
metabolically dormant cysts that can survive at temperatures as high as 65°C [1-3,5]. Consequently, R. centenum
can often be cultivated from hot springs such as those
found at Yellowstone National Park [3]. R. centenum
metabolizes a unique set of carbon sources, but is unable
to utilize malate or other C4 dicarboxylic acids [2]. Unlike

sulfur bacteria, R. centenum does not repress photosystem synthesis in the presence of molecular oxygen [6].
Three morphologically distinct cell types are observed
during the R. centenum life cycle; swim cells, swarm cells
and metabolically dormant cyst cells [1,7]. Proteobacterial encystment has been reported in diverse species, and
is one of several prokaryotic resting cell strategies
employed for surviving environmental stress. Physiological aspects of cyst cell development have been well studied in R. centenum, Azotobacter vinelandii and
Azospirillum brasilense, several features of which are
shared by these species [4,5,8-10]. Environmental
stresses, including nutrient deprivation, trigger vegetative
cells to undergo a multi-stage transition into rounded,
immotile cells encapsulated by complex, protective outer
coats (Figure 1B). These cysts are additionally typified by
the presence of large intracellular granules of the indus-

[11]. The resulting cells have extreme desiccation resistance and also afford modest protection from stresses
such as heat and UV light. While the morphological and
resistive aspects of such cysts have been well studied,
mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this process
remain largely unknown.
Members of the cyst forming Azospirillum genera have
significant agricultural importance. Specifically, the aerobic nitrogen fixing species A. brasilense and A. lipoferum
(both closely related to R. centenum) are known to associate with, and stimulate the growth of, numerous grasses
and cereals [12]. These bacteria may benefit such plants
through their ability to aerobically fix nitrogen [12].
Interestingly, mutations that affect swim cell to swarm
cell differentiation [13,14] and cyst-cell development [15]
also affect plant root colonization. Thus, a better understanding of these cellular differentiation events is clearly
warranted. A genome sequence advances the tools available for studies of these processes.

age gene length is 945 nucleotides. There are 2,633 predicted proteins that have sequence similarity to other
known proteins, while 1,135 (28%) are homologous to
proteins of unknown function and a further 234 (6%) are
unique to R. centenum. The entire genome sequence has
been fully annotated and a summary of genes in major
functional categories is shown in Table 2. GC skew analysis failed to present a strong inflection point indicative of
an origin of replication (Figure 1A). However, the replication related genes dnaA and dnaN begin at base pair
positions 3,127,698 and 3,134721, respectively, which
may suggest the general location of an origin.
Detailed metabolic pathway construction for R. centenum was generated from the annotated genome using the
Pathway Tools suite of programs [16,17]. The predicted
metabolic networks were further validated and adjusted
with information from the literature that contained
experimental data from taxonomically related bacteria.
Based on the constructed metabolic scheme, 1,295
known enzymatic reactions involved in 263 pathways are
predicted. A total of 985 putative metabolic compounds
are predicted to exist in the metabolism of R. centenum,
which appears to possess many metabolic pathways typical of purple photosynthetic bacteria in the α-proteobacteria class. Despite the existence of multiple nutrient
assimilation pathways, no sulfide metabolism was identified, which verifies an earlier observation that R. centenum is incapable of reducing sulfide [18,19].
Nevertheless, genes required for anaerobic respiration
involved in nitrate and fumarate reduction were identified.

Carbon fixation

The genome sequence of R. centenum reveals a versatile
capacity for carbon fixation. Two groups of Rubisco
encoding genes (tentatively named cbbL1S1 and cbbL2S2)
are present within two putative operons located at distal
positions of the chromosome. The first is linked with
genes coding for proteins typically involved in the CalvinBenson cycle, such as phosphoribulokinase (prk),
whereas the second is associated with two genes (cbbO
and cbbQ) that encode Rubisco activation proteins (Figure 2A). Both cbb operons are likely regulated by LysRfamily transcription factors (CbbR1 and CbbR2), whose
corresponding genes are located immediately upstream
of each respective operon. Though seemingly rare, some
species of bacteria have multiple forms of Rubisco
[reviewed in [20]]. A phylogenetic analysis of 18 phototrophic bacteria demonstrates that R. centenum possesses Rubisco subtypes IAq and IC, both of which are
found predominantly in proteobacteria (Figure 2B). The
IC form of Rubisco is found primarily among α/β-proteobacteria while form IAq is predominantly found in
chemolithotrophic β/γ-proteobacteria, with the exception of Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB5.
Different kinetic properties reported for these various
Rubisco forms have led to speculation that each is
adapted for use in specific environmental CO2 concentrations, and that possession of multiple Rubisco forms may
be advantageous [20]. For instance, Form IC Rubisco has
a slightly lower reaction rate (kcat ~2-3.2 s-1) than IAq (kcat
~3.7 s-1), suggesting that they are adapted to medium-tohigh and medium-to-low [CO2] environments, respectively [21]. The need for such extreme metabolic flexibility is reflected by the wide range of environments that
non-sulfur purple bacteria inhabit. The mechanism of
switching between two Rubisco forms and the roles of the
dedicated regulatory proteins CbbR1 and CbbR2 are
unclear in these bacteria.
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, RC1_2446)
and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (Pdk, RC1_1667)
are present in the R. centenum genome. These enzymes
are widespread in plants and bacteria. PEPC and Pdk
(with malic enzyme) are thought to be responsible for
heterotrophic carbon dioxide assimilation in Roseobacter
denitrificans since this bacteria does not contain Rubisco
[22]. However, PEPC and Pdk are also found in species
that primarily use Rubisco for carbon fixation, such as R.
palustris. Thus, the function that PEPC and Pdk perform
in R. centenum, as well as in related Rubisco-containing
purple bacteria, is unclear. An R. palustris PEPC-deficient strain does exhibit a slower doubling time compared with the wild-type strain grown anaerobically in
the light and aerobically in the dark when pyruvate is
used as a carbon source [23]. Thus, autotrophic bacteria

like R. centenum that cannot acquire C4 dicarboxylic acids
heterotrophically may have evolved an anaplerotic assimilation to ensure a continuous replenishment of C4-dicarboxylic acids needed for amino acid biosynthesis.
An analysis of the α-proteobacteria class shows that
only four anoxygenic photosynthetic species are known
to possess Pk, Pdk, and PEPS (phosphoenolpyruvate syn-

thase) together (Additional File 1, Figure S1). These
include two members of the Bradyrhizobium family, Hoeflea phototropica, and R. centenum. The others contain
only Pk and Pdk, or just Pdk (e.g., the mutualistic parasites of Rickettsiales). The four containing Pk, Pdk, and
PEPS are reported to grow poorly with pyruvate, malate,
and various other dicarboxylic acids, indicating a strong

dependence on carbon source such as we observe with R.
centenum [2,24,25].
Figure 3 presents a proposed scheme in which the
pyruvate/PEP interconversion driven by pyruvate kinase
(Pk), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (Pdk), and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS) collaborate functionally to modulate carbon flux in R. centenum. It is based on
previous experimental data illustrating the control of
pyruvate/PEP interconversion under different trophic
conditions in R. denitrificans, R. rubrum, and Archaea
[22,26,27]. When aerobic respiration is suppressed due to
the lack of oxygen, Pk is functionally replaced by Pdk that
continuously supplies pyruvate [26,27]. We speculate that

reactions are numbered: 1. pyruvate dikinase (RC1_1667); 2. pyruvate
kinase (RC1_2135 and RC1_2401); 3. phosphoenolpyruvate synthase
(RC1_3562); 4. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (RC1_2822); 5.
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (RC1_2446); 6. malic enzyme
(RC1_0405 and RC1_3260); 7. malate dehydrogenase (RC1_4080); 8.
malate synthase (RC1_2688); 9. fumarase (RC1_1865); 10. succinate dehydrogenase (RC1_3941). Inter-converison of fumarate and succinate
(SUC) can oxidize electron carriers such as quinone (purple labeled) for
anaerobic respiration. Alternatively, both pyruvate and acetyl CoA can
be used in fermentation. Putatively, Glycerate-3-phosphate (3PG) produced by fixing CO2 into Ribulose-1,5-bipohsphate (RUBP) by Rubisco
may be shuffled between the Calvin cycle and glycolysis (hollow arrowhead with question mark).

PEPS collaborates with both Pk and Pdk under nitrogenfixing conditions, where it supplies a stable supplement of
dicarboxylic acids through an internal pyruvate pool for
amino acid biosynthesis. PEPS-driven gluconeogenesis in
R. centenum may contribute to the balance of carbon flux
for the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway when
the rate of CO2 fixation is limited.
Metabolism

R. centenum is an active nitrogen fixer. The nif genes of R.
centenum are located in two distant regions: the first
region consists of 22 genes that essentially include nifIXENKDHTZBAVW for nitrogenase biosynthesis, modBC
for molybdenum transport, and fixABCX for electron
transport. Phylogenetic analysis using a concatenated
alignment of the nitrogenase structural genes nifHDK
shows that R. centenum falls within a clade containing R.
sphaeroides, R. rubrum and several Rhizobiales (not
shown). This result suggests that this group of nitrogenases originated from a common ancestor.
Neither iron nor vanadium nitrogenases, coded by anf
and vnfVHDK, respectively, were identified in the R. centenum genome. In R. rubrum the regulatory enzymes
dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyl transferase (DRAT)
and dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase
(DRAG) regulate nitrogenase activity by reversible ADPribosylation of NifH [28,29]. An absence of these genes in
R. centenum suggests that these organisms have different
environmental requirements for nitrogen fixation. While
R. centenum possesses a nitrogenase for nitrogen fixation,
utilization of inorganic nitrogen compounds as an alternative nitrogen source is restricted. Unlike R. denitrificans, which has a large complement of genes for nitrogen
metabolism (but not nitrogenase), the R. centenum
genome does not contain genes which encode an assimilatory nitrite reductase (nirSCFDGHJN) for the denitrification pathway. Yet, the nitrate reduction by periplasmic
nitrate reductase (napABCDEF) seems to be intact.
We identified the presence of two cytosolic detoxifying
enzymes, arsenate and mercuric reductase. To our
knowledge, the latter has never been reported in a purple
bacterium. Two copies of arsenate reductase, encoded by
arsC1 and arsC2, are present (RC1_2995 and RC1_3700).
One copy is associated with genes encoding an arsenate
efflux pump (arc3) and an arsenic resistance repressor
(arsR). In both ArsC proteins, the cysteine residues that
presumably bind arsenate are conserved, but the protein
sequences share less than 20% overall identity. The presence of arc3 and arsR implies that arsenate reductase is
an inducible enzyme when arsenate is present. There is
one copy of mercuric reductase encoding merA
(RC1_2279). Generally, these two detoxifying systems are
energy dependent, with arsenate reductase using either

Lu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:325
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/325

thioredoxin or glutaredoxin while mercuric reductase
uses NADPH [30].
Cyst formation

To date, the only concerted effort at finding regulators of
encystment (Figure 1B) in any bacterial species has been
undertaken in R. centenum, where a screen for Tn5
mutants displaying de-repressed encystment on nutrientrich media uncovered several such components [31]. A
subset of identified elements lay within an operon of
chemotaxis-like genes (che3), individual in-frame deletions of which exhibit opposing premature 'hyper-cyst' or
delayed 'hypo-cyst' phenotypes [32]. Predicted signaling
components of note in this cluster include a small
receiver domain protein (CheY3; RC1_2133), a hybrid
sensor kinase-receiver CheA homolog (CheA3;
RC1_2127) and a similarly hybridized kinase-receiver
protein (CstS3; RC1_2124) that also contains a PAS sensory domain. As ultimate control over cyst cell development no doubt occurs at the transcriptional level, the
immediate output of this system is unclear, as none of the
aforementioned components has an obvious DNA binding domain. Whether or not Che3 signaling ultimately
regulates timing of encystment directly, through the
phosphorylation of a classic response regulator, or does
so by means of a more indirect mechanism remains to be
elucidated. This screen also identified two genomically
orphaned, cytoplasmic sensor kinases (CstS1, RC1_2847
and CstS2, RC1_2047), both predicted to contain PAS
and PAC sensory motifs with CstS1 also containing a
GAF and a receiver domain [31]. Deletion of cstS1 and
cstS2 have contrasting respective hypo-cyst and hypercyst phenotypes, and epistatic analyses of these genes and
che3 components indicate a complex signaling hierarchy
into which contributions are undoubtedly made by hitherto unknown regulatory elements (Berleman and Bauer,
Unpublished Data). In fact further screens in our lab have
uncovered several such regulators, including two sensor
kinases, RC1_0896 and RC1_3465 (Marden and Bauer,
Unpublished Data). These genes were independently
identified by a similar screen in a separate lab where they
are currently the subject of genetic characterization (Bird,
Manuscript in preparation).
Photosynthetic and chlorophyll biosynthetic proteins

Despite striking dissimilarity in the genomic organization
of photosynthesis genes in different photosynthetic species, most of the genes that carry out bacterial chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis in R. centenum are
found in a single photosynthetic gene cluster (PGC; Figure 4). The photosynthesis genes are organized into seven
major operons. The gene cluster hemA-puhH-acsF-puhCBA-bch-lhaAb-chLMHBNF is located immediately
downstream of pufMLAB-bchZYXC-crtFEDCBI in R.

centenum. This is in contrast to Bradyrhizobium sp.
where it maps immediately upstream of aerR-ppsR1bchG2P. The carotenoid biosynthesis gene crtA found in
Rhodobacter capsulatus (among others) is not found in R.
centenum (or Bradyrhizobium sp). The bch/heme biosynthesis genes acsFI, puhE, hemA, and the cyc2 gene encoding cytochrome c2, are present in the genome. Thus, the
overall organization of the R. centenum PGC is similar to
the PGC of Bradyrhizobium sp. but not closely related to
that of Rhodobacter species. We also found that R. centenum and R. rubrum do not share contiguity of their
PGCs, where the R. rubrum PGC is separated into two
clusters in distant regions of the chromosome.
Photoreceptors

The R. centenum ppr gene represents the first bacteriophytochrome identified in purple bacteria [33]. Distinctive characteristics of Ppr, with respect to other
bacteriophytochromes, have been discussed in detail
elsewhere [reviewed in [34]]. In addition to ppr, a second
gene (RC1_3803) is predicted to encode an additional
bacteriophytochrome. RC1_3803 does not possess a photoactive yellow protein (PYP) domain, and has 45% and
55% similarity to both the photosensory core domain
(PCD) and histidine kinase domain (HKD) of Ppr, respectively (not shown). A search of public protein databases
identified a number of bacteriophytochromes that show
homology to RC1_3803 (not shown). Based on characteristics of other bacteriophytochromes, we hypothesize
that RC1_3803 may absorb near far-red light, as that
wavelength of light is reported to promote negative phototaxis of R. centenum and is in the region of the spectrum where other bacteriophytochromes exhibit spectral
absorbance [7], reviewed in [34].
Finally, there are two genes coding for flavin-binding
photoreceptors. One gene (RC1_2193) putatively codes
for a small blue light photoreceptor utilizing a flavin
(BLUF) and a second protein (RC1_0351) putatively
encodes a histidine kinase containing a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain. Both of these putative photoreceptors
likely utilize FAD or FMN as a chromophore to absorb
blue light to promote a conformational change to elicit an
output response. Neither protein has been genetically
disrupted, but they may play a role in controlling light
regulated physiology or behavior in R. centenum.
Flagella

R. centenum synthesizes two flagella, a constitutive polar
flagellum for swimming motility and inducible lateral flagella required for swarming motility on viscous or solid
media [35]. We identified 72 flagella genes in the R. centenum genome distributed among five major flagellar gene
clusters (FGCs) at various regions along the chromosome
(Figure 5). Most structural genes are duplicated while

flgC, flgF, flhF, fliL, and fliN have either three or four copies each. Several genes involved in regulation, export or
assembly (flhF, fliO, fliX, flaA, flaG, flbD, and fleN) are
present as a single copy.
Lateral and polar flagellar systems have diverged twice
in α-proteobacteria as well as in the common ancestor of
β/γ-proteobacteria [36]. Many of the duplicated fla genes
in R. centenum exhibit poor sequence similarity to their
reciprocal pair indicating a high degree of diversity
among the lateral and polar flagella genes (Additional File
1, Table S1). It also does not rule out that either the polar
or lateral flagella genes may have been derived by lateral
gene transfer. A phylogenetic tree using a concatenated
alignment of eleven flg genes from R. centenum indicates
that the lateral flagellar system of R. centenum indeed has
a distinct origin from the polar flagellar system (Figure 6).
The four small clusters (FGC2, FGC3, FGC4 and FGC5)
that map to different positions on the chromosome have
subunits predicted to constitute components of the polar
flagellum. Structural components of the lateral flagella
are predicted to reside among the large FGC1 cluster.
We have obtained several mutations in the transcription factor FlbD that disrupt synthesis of the polar, but
not lateral flagella (D. Rollo and C. Bauer, unpublished
results). These results indicate that expression of the
polar and lateral flagella genes are distinct. Also, several
insertion mutations that affect synthesis of both the lat-

eral and polar flagellum map to components of the type
III export system comprised of FliI, FlhA, FlhB and FliL,
indicating that this export apparatus is used by both flagella systems.
There are 13 additional genes that include three functionally identified, four functionally predicted, and six of
unknown function distributed among the fla clusters.
These include genes encoding a CheY-like receiver protein (RC1_0209), lytic muramyl transglycoylase
(RC1_0192), DNA polymerase III (RC1_0787), PPErepeat proteins (RC1_0178), tetratricopeptide TPR_2
(RC1_0215), DNA binding protein (RC1_0222), and an
ATPase involved in DNA repair (RC1_0187).
Chemotaxis and Signal Transduction

The three previously identified operons (Che1, Che2 and
Che3) encoding chemotaxis-like proteins were confirmed
to represent the entirety of such 'Che-like' clusters in R.
centenum [32,37,38]. Each contains homologs of the E.
coli chemotactic proteins CheA, CheY, CheW, CheB and
CheR, with an additional CheW in the Che3 cluster
(CheW3a and CheW3b) and a tripartate CheW in the
Che2 cluster composed of three distinct CheW domains.
Atypical CheA sensor kinases are also present in the
Che1 and Che2 clusters, as each is hybridized to a
receiver domain. Also of note are genes encoding noncanonical chemotactic components, two small proteins of
unknown function in the Che2 cluster (RC1_0336 and

RC1_0341) and an additional sensor kinase receiver
domain hybrid (CstS3; RC1_2124) in the Che3 cluster.
The functions of all three chemotaxis operons have
been elucidated. Both chemotactic and phototactic
behavior in R. centenum are under Che1 control, as
strains with Che1 component disruptions have motility
phenotypes similar to those of E. coli chemotactic
mutants [39]. The Che2 cluster is involved in lateral flagella biosynthesis, as strains deleted of Che2 components
are either hyper-flagellated or lack flagella completely,
but remain chemotactic [32]. Lastly, the Che3 cluster
directs timing of encystment, as deletions of Che3 components produce strains that are either early or delayed in
cyst cell development [37]. The molecular mechanisms
by which the latter two clusters achieve such altered functions are yet to be elucidated.
Whereas CheA, CheW, CheB and CheR homologs were
only identified within these chemotaxis clusters (a CheBCheR hybrid, RC1_3878, was discovered), 19 genes
encode for small, stand-alone CheY-like receiver domain
proteins. Besides the three Che cluster-associated CheY
encoding homologs, two of these cheY-like genes are
associated with neighboring genes encoding chemosensory proteins. The first (RC1_0955) is adjacent to one of
two putative CheZ phosphatases (RC1_0954 and
RC1_0882). The second (RC1_0353) is part of a potential

operon with genes encoding a small hypothetical protein
(RC1_0352), a methyl accepting chemotaxis domain protein (MCP; RC1_0354) and a homolog of the response
regulator fixJ (RC1_0355). Whether these stand-alone
receiver domains play a part in chemotactic signal transduction will require significant genetic and biochemical
characterization.
A total of 33 genes encoding MCP domains were identified in our analysis, only three of which have been previously genetically characterized. The first identified, Ptr,
was shown to be responsible for photosensory perception
in R. centenum [40]. MCP2 and MCP3, which are respectively and functionally associated with the aforementioned Che2 and Che3 clusters, have functions
independent of taxis, since gene deletion strains are
chemotactic but instead are either hyper-flagellated
(Δmcp2) or delayed in encystment (Δmcp3) [32,37]. As
discussed above, a methyl-accepting sensory transducer
is also tightly linked with a homolog of fixJ, which is
known to be a transcription activator for nitrogen fixation in microaerobic conditions [41]. We speculate that
this MCP may thus have a role in altering bacterial swimming to approach the microaerobic conditions that are
optimal for nitrogen fixation. The relatively large number
of new and uncharacterized MCP domain-containing
proteins suggests a capacity to sense and respond to a

Figure 6 Maximum likelihood tree based on conserved flagellar proteins depicting the position of R. centenum flagellar systems among
other flagellated bacteria. The tree is based on a concatenated alignment of 11 flagellar proteins (Flg) that are present in all primary and secondary
flagellar systems [36]. A blue "1" or "2" after the species name indicates primary and secondary flagella systems, respectively. Alpha I (alphaproteobacteria group I) and Alpha II (alphaproteobacteria group II) are boxed. The primary (polar) and secondary (lateral) flagella of R. centenum are in red.

wide variety of extracellular signals, either with a tactic
response, or with the alternate functions controlled by
the Che2 and Che3 pathways.
In our analysis of two-component signal transduction,
55 identified genes are predicted to encode sensor
kinases, 16 of which are hybridized to receiver domains.
Excluding the latter group, 54 proteins are predicted to
contain receiver domains. Of these 19 are stand-alone
receiver domains with the remainder fused to assorted
sensory and/or output domains. Lastly, 8 predicted proteins contain a histidine-containing phosphotransfer
domain; three Class II histidine kinases (all R. centenum
CheA proteins), two within hybrid Class I histidine
kinases (RC1_0633 and RC1_2262), two stand-alone

domains (RC1_2126 and RC1_3033) and one associated
with a receiver domain (RC1_1779).

Conclusions
Analysis of the R. centenum genome demonstrates that
both Rubisco- and PEPC- derived carbon assimilation
can compensate for the inability to utilize malate or other
C4 dicarboxylic acids in the R. centenum environment.
Many newly identified genes that are discussed in this
report have advanced our knowledge of the structure and
origin of the R. centenum PGC, the complex life cycle
involving differentiation from swim to swarm cells, and
the differentiation into heat and desiccation resistant
resting cysts. R. centenum also contains many sensory

proteins such as bacteriophytochromes that control gene
expression in response to complex environmental stimuli.
The completion of the R. centenum genome impacts the
study of cyst cell development in particular, already
allowing the identification of an A. brasilense flcA
homolog. FlcA is a transcriptional regulator of A. brasilense encystment, and appears to have a role in R. centenum encystment (Marden and Bauer, Unpublished Data).
The sequenced genome has also allowed for the discovery
of an additional sensor kinase involved in encystment,
RC1_2747. This gene was originally disrupted and identified in a hyper-cyst screen, however the transposition
occurred in a region with low sequence similarity and
was placed in a class of unknown genes [5].
R. centenum is emerging as a model organism for
molecular genetic analysis of cyst formation, photosynthesis, phototaxis, and cellular development. This species
is genetically amenable, with a variety of genetic tools
already developed to explore these processes. The generation of a complete and annotated genome sequence
establishes the genetic infrastructure for such studies,
provides a framework to organize all the genetic information about the organism, and catalyzes future 'omics'
research.

from AutoAnnotate. The manual annotation tool Manatee (manatee.sourceforge.net) was used to carefully
review and confirm the annotation of every gene.
Pseudogenes contained one or more mutations that
would ablate expression; each inactivating mutation was
subsequently checked against the original sequencing
data. The circular genome map was created using the
program CGView [44].
Mulitple amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees for this study were built using Muscle [45],
Gblocks [46], PhyML [47], and MEGA 4.0 [48] as previously described [36]. Some of the sequences used in our
analysis were collected from the JGI Integrated Microbial
Genomes browser http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/
main.cgi. The Pathway-Tools software was employed for
predicting and comparing metabolic pathways of R. centenum [16,17]. The initial process of metabolic construction for R. centenum was automatic and involved building
each pathway based on genome annotation results and
the presence of each pathway in the MetaCyc database
[17]. A further step to validate the accuracy of the constructed metabolic network was carried out based on
supporting information from the scientific literature.

Methods
R. centenum strain SW (ATCC 51521) originated from
hot spring mud in Wyoming, United States. A single colony was grown anaerobically and total DNA was isolated
using proteinase K treatment followed by phenol extraction. The DNA was fragmented by kinetic shearing, and
three shotgun libraries were generated: small and
medium insert libraries in the plasmid pOTWI3 (using
size fractions of 2-3 kb and 6-8 kb, respectively), and a
large insert fosmid library in pEpiFOS-5 (insert sizes
ranging from 28-47 kb), which was used as a scaffold. The
relative amount of sequence coverage obtained from the
small, medium, and large insert libraries was approximately 8×, 1×, and 1×, respectively. The whole genome
sequence was established from 55,014 end sequences
(giving 9.7× coverage) derived from these libraries using
dye terminator chemistry on ABI 3730xl automated
sequencers. The sequence was assembled with the program Arachne [42] and finished as described previously
[43]. The complete and annotated genome sequence of R.
centenum has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
under the accession number CP000613.
Initial automated annotation of the genome was performed with the TIGR/JCVI Annotation Engine http://
www.tigr.org/AnnotationEngine, where it was processed
by TIGR's prokaryotic annotation pipeline. Included in
the pipeline is gene finding with Glimmer, Blast-extendrepraze (BER) searches, HMM searches, TMHMM
searches, SignalP predictions, and automatic annotations

R. centenum cultures were harvested and washed three
times in phosphate buffer and then pipetted onto CENBA
plates in 5 μl aliquots. After 1, 2 and 3 days incubation,
the cell spots were harvested, fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde/
100 mM HEPES/2 mM MgCl2 and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy as described previously [18].
Mature R. centenum colonies were analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy, performed as described previously
[49].
