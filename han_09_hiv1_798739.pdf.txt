Abstract
Background: We conducted molecular analyses to confirm four clustering HIV-1 infections
(Patient A, B, C & D) in Guangzhou, China. These cases were identified by epidemiological
investigation and suspected to acquire the infection through a common heterosexual transmission
chain.
Methods: Env C2V3V4 region, gag p17/p24 junction and partial pol gene of HIV-1 genome from
serum specimens of these infected cases were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequenced.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses indicated that their viral nucleotide sequences were significantly
clustered together (bootstrap value is 99%, 98% and 100% in env, gag and pol tree respectively).
Evolutionary distance analysis indicated that their genetic diversities of env, gag and pol genes were
significantly lower than non-clustered controls, as measured by unpaired t-test (env gene
comparison: p < 0.005; gag gene comparison: p < 0.005; pol gene comparison: p < 0.005).
Conclusion: Epidemiological results and molecular analyses consistently illustrated these four
cases represented a transmission chain which dispersed in the locality through heterosexual
contact involving commercial sex worker.

Background
Epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) infection in China is changing from predominantly injecting drug use to increasingly sexual transmission [1], with close to 50% of new infections attributable
to sexual transmission in 2005 [2]. The unsafe sexual
behavior is one of the key risk factors of HIV transmission

in China. A review cited the Newsweek reported that the
number of commercial sex workers (CSWs) in mainland
China exceed 10 million in 2003 [3]. Data from a nationwide sentinel surveillance revealed that HIV prevalence
among CSWs has risen from 0.02% in 1996 to 0.93% in
2004 and over 1% in some places [4]. Recently, a comprehensive surveillance revealed that 60% of CSWs do not

use condoms every time [1]. These results suggested that
CSWs serve as a bridge to transmit HIV from core risk
groups into general population of the country.
What puzzles epidemiologists is the difficulties in defining the linkage amongst HIV cases using traditional epidemiological approaches based on behavioral information.
Nucleotide sequence analysis presents an unique opportunity to identify possible epidemiological linkage
between infected cases and to track the viral transmission
from person to person through viral genome analysis, as
explored in various HIV-1 studies [5,6].
We conducted molecular analyses to confirm four HIV-1
infections from Guangzhou China which were transmitted through a heterosexual transmission chain involving
CSW.

Methods
Patients, materials and methods
Serum specimens from four patients (Patients A, B, C and
D) and five contacts (Contacts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) in this surveillance investigation were collected between January
2008 and May 2008 after obtaining their informed consent. These sera were collected prior to any antiretroviral
treatment. Sera were screened for HIV-1 antibody by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (bioMerieux,
France and Peking BGI-GBI, China) and confirmed by
Western blotting (MP Biomedicals, Singapore). HIV-1
positive sera were aliquoted to avoid unnecessary freezethaw deterioration cycle and were stored at -70°C.
RNA extraction/PCR/nucleotide sequencing
RNA extraction, reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and nucleotide sequencing were performed in physically separated laboratories.
Viral RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA extraction
Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was reverse
transcribed by MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) into cDNA using random
hexamer. The cDNA was used as template for PCR amplification of two HIV-1 subgenomic regions (env C2V3V4
region and gag p17/p24 junction) by nested PCR. In addition, the cDNA from four clustered cases was further
amplified at the pol gene. The primers and conditions of
PCR for gag and env applied in this study were as previously described [7]. The region of pol gene was divided
into three segments (pro, rt5' and rt3'). The primers and
conditions for pol were as follows: pro segment: outer
sense primer (PolF20): 5'-GAG AGA CAG GCT TAT TTT
TT-3', common antisense primer (PR96): 5'-CTT CCC
AGA AGT CTT GAG TTC T-3', inner sense primer
(PolF21): 5'-GCA GAC CAG AGC CAA CAG C-3'; rt5' segment: outer sense primer (A1): 5'-AAT TTT CCC ATT AGT

PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Version 3.1) (Applied Biosystems). The
sequenced products were resolved and analyzed using an
ABI PRISM 3100 or 3130 xl Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems) [7]. Relevant positive and negative
controls were included in each time to avoid false positive
in the PCR.
Phylogenetic analyses of env, gag and pol genes
Nucleotide sequences from Patients A through D together
with other non-clustered control sequences were aligned
by ClustalW software [8] and followed by manual adjustment. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses
were conducted using MEGA version 4 [9]. Evolutionary
distances were calculated by Kimura two-parameter modeling, excluding positions with alignment gaps in any
sequence. Phylogenetic dendrograms based on partial
sequence of the env C2V3V4 region, gag p17/p24 junction
and pol gene of the HIV-1 genome were constructed using
neighbor-joining method with Kimura two-parameter
modeling. The reliability of each node was evaluated by
bootstrapping with 2000 replicates.
Amino acid sequence analysis
Gag p17/p24 junction nucleotide sequences from clustered cases were translated into amino acid and aligned
with their closest CRF01_AE reference sequence (Accession number: AF197340) and the highest homology
matched sequence detected in Yunnan China in 2002
(Accession number: EF062020). Signature analysis was
conducted by VESPA tool of Los Alamos National Laboratory http://www.hiv.lanl.gov to identify unique sequence
pattern present in those clustering cases as compare with
the above-mentioned reference sequences [10].
Statistical analyses
Differences in degree of diversity (evolutionary distance)
in env, gag and pol genes of clustered cases and non-clustered controls were ascertained using unpaired t-test.

Results
Epidemiological investigation
In March 2008, the index case (Patient A) died of AIDS 2
months after he was found to be infected by HIV-1. Epidemiological investigation included two females, Patient B
(wife of Patient A) and Patient C (sex partner of Patient

A). Investigation indicated that Patient B had no other risk
factor for HIV-1 infection except for sexual contact with
Patient A. Patient C was a CSW since 1998 and served as
sex partner of Patient A. Patient C had long term unprotected sex with Patient A in the last 4.5 years and denied
any history of drug use, blood transfusion or receipt of
blood products. Again, Patient A had denied any history
of drug use, blood transfusion or receipt of blood products. Further contact tracing expanded into 5 male sex
partners of Patient C, including Patient D and Contacts 1
to 4. Patient D and Contacts 1 - 4 denied risk behaviors for
HIV transmission other than heterosexual contact. Patient
D served as a sex partner of Patient C for 5 years until he
was diagnosed with HIV infection. Contact 1 also was a
sexual partner of Patient C for more than 1 year. Contact
2 served as a sexual partner of Patient C two years ago for
1 year. Contacts 3 and 4 had sexual contact with Patient C
during the past 4 to 5 years. Another female (Contact 5)
who was sexual partner of Contact 2 was included when
further tracking of the secondary contacts was conducted.
Contact 5 admitted the history of drug use and denied
blood transfusion or receipt of blood products. All male
individuals in this investigation denied the history of
homosexual contact. Patients A through D were confirmed HIV-1 cases, while Contacts 1 through 5 were HIV1 negative and remained negative after three months follow-up. The relationship between investigated cases and
their possible transmission direction is illustrated in Figure 1.
Phylogenetic analyses
HIV-1 viral RNA was extracted from the sera of Patients A
through D. HIV-1 subtype determination using env, gag

and pol genes of the HIV-1 genome of these patients consistently showed they belonged to CRF01_AE [7]. Based
on the genetic characterization of gag p17/p24 junction
sequences, it revealed that these four CRF01_AE viral
strains were equally homologous (95%) to CRF01_AE isolates detected in Thailand at 1999 (GenBank Accession:
AY945731) and Yunnan at 2002 (GenBank Accession:
EF062020).
Phylogenetic dendrograms of the acquired env, gag and pol
gene sequences from Patient A - D together with randomly
selected non-clustered control CRF01_AE sequences were
constructed and shown in Figure 2. As expected, phylogenetic analyses indicated that the nucleotide sequences
from Patients A - D were clustered together (bootstrap values are 99%, 98% and 100% for env, gag and pol gene
respectively).
The evolutionary distances of the env, gag and pol genes
from the four patients were 5.23 ± 0.85%, 2.39 ± 0.60%
and 1.54 ± 0.22%, and when compared with non-related
controls, 11.02 ± 0.92% (n = 23), 6.27 ± 0.66% (n = 32)
and 2.95 ± 0.18% (n = 25), respectively (Table 1). The
results indicated that the diversity of env, gag and pol genes
of these clustered cases (Patient A - D) were significantly
lower than non-clustered control group as measured by
unpaired t-test (env gene: p = 1.19 × 10-11; gag gene: p =
6.37 × 10-13 and pol gene: p = 5.12 × 10-14).
Gag p17/p24 amino acid sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequences of the gag p17/p24 junction from
the clustered cases were translated into amino acid
sequences and aligned with NCBI CRF01_AE reference
sequence (Accession number: AF197340) and their high
homology sequence detected in Yunnan China (Accession
number: EF062020) (Figure 3). The alignment illustrated
that clustered cases possess unique amino acid alterations
as compared with AF197340 and EF062020. These amino
acid alterations were D/E92G, I104M, V/I107A and
S124N and formed a specific signature of this cluster.

HIV-1 is characterized by high genomic variability.
Sequence diversity was observed whether among isolates
within the same individual or between isolates from different infected individuals. Previous studies have shown
that HIV-1 isolates from same individual may differ by up
to 2% in the env gene and those from unrelated individuals may differ by 6-22% [11], while the degree of diversity
between isolates from closely related individuals fall in
between [12].
Phylogenetic analyses are increasingly used in clarifying
the epidemiological linkage of HIV-1 transmission by
comparing nucleotide sequence fragments from one or

more subgenomic regions, such as gag, env and pol genes,
or full-length genome sequence. Early studies have concentrated on sequence variation in the env V3 region,
which contains the principal neutralization domain and
determinants for biological phenotypes [13,14]. Thus,
there was argument that it could be less suitable for epidemiological study than other regions (gag and pol) of HIV1 genome [15,16]. However, Leitner et al. accurately
reconstructed a known HIV-1 transmission history by

phylogenetic analysis and demonstrated that it was at
least as accurate using env V3 sequences as with gag p17
sequences [17]. Recent data showed that the env, gag or pol
genes were frequently used in epidemiological studies
[18-22].
Our evolutionary distance analyses at three different
genomic regions (env, gag and pol genes) of the HIV-1 viral
genome demonstrated that the HIV-1 isolates from these

four patients formed a cluster which was highly related
with each other and differed by 5.23% in the env gene.
Molecular evidence strongly supported the close epidemiological linkage among them. In addition, analyses
showed that the average evolutionary distance in env, gag
and pol genes of these four clustering members were significantly lower than the ones from local unrelated noncluster CRF01_AE controls [5,7].
By far bootstrap test is one of the most commonly used
tests of the reliability of a constructed phylogenetic dendrogram. The study of Hillis and Bull showed that a bootstrap value of >70% commonly signified a probability of
95% or higher and the topology at this branch is real [23].
Phylogenetic analyses illustrated that the sequences from
the four patients clustered together in phylogenetic analyses of both env, gag and pol genes. The high bootstrap values (99% for env gene, 98% for gag gene and 100% for pol
gene, respectively) strongly indicated that they are of
closely related and monophyletic.

CRF01_AE strain was transmitted from Thailand through
Yunnan China and eventually to Guangzhou China.

Conclusion
In summary, we performed molecular epidemiology to
track the transmission of HIV-1 infection within a group
of heterosexual patients in Guangzhou. Highly related
sequences from four patients indicated a transmission
chain. The result complemented the epidemiological
findings that the infection was sustained within the locality through heterosexual contact involving a CSW.

Sequence Data
Nucleotide sequences of the env, gag and pol gene of
Patient A - D were submitted to GenBank at the NCBI
(Accession no. FJ752409 - FJ752412, FJ752413 FJ752416 and FJ752417 - FJ752420 for env, gag and pol
sequences respectively).

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Amino acid signature was observed in some study to
detect for closely related cases, such as transmission of
HIV-1 from a dentist to his five patients [5]. The study of
a possible single-source sexual transmission cluster in
upstate New York showed that a specific amino acid signature was present in the gag p17/p24 junction of subtype
B sequence [24], while the study of three clusters among
subtype B samples in Hong Kong also indicated that
amino acid signatures were unique and cluster specific
[7]. In this study we detected a unique signature pattern of
four amino acid residues in the gag p17/p24 junction of
CRF01_AE sequences of these four clustering cases in
comparison with selected reference sequences.
