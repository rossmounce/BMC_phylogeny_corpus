Genomes of the T4-related bacteriophages as
windows on microbial genome evolution
Vasiliy M Petrov1, Swarnamala Ratnayaka1, James M Nolan2, Eric S Miller3, Jim D Karam1*

Abstract
The T4-related bacteriophages are a group of bacterial viruses that share morphological similarities and genetic
homologies with the well-studied Escherichia coli phage T4, but that diverge from T4 and each other by a number
of genetically determined characteristics including the bacterial hosts they infect, the sizes of their linear doublestranded (ds) DNA genomes and the predicted compositions of their proteomes. The genomes of about 40 of
these phages have been sequenced and annotated over the last several years and are compared here in the context of the factors that have determined their diversity and the diversity of other microbial genomes in evolution.
The genomes of the T4 relatives analyzed so far range in size between ~160,000 and ~250,000 base pairs (bp) and
are mosaics of one another, consisting of clusters of homology between them that are interspersed with segments
that vary considerably in genetic composition between the different phage lineages. Based on the known biological and biochemical properties of phage T4 and the proteins encoded by the T4 genome, the T4 relatives
reviewed here are predicted to share a genetic core, or “Core Genome” that determines the structural design of
their dsDNA chromosomes, their distinctive morphology and the process of their assembly into infectious agents
(phage morphogenesis). The Core Genome appears to be the most ancient genetic component of this phage
group and constitutes a mere 12-15% of the total protein encoding potential of the typical T4-related phage genome. The high degree of genetic heterogeneity that exists outside of this shared core suggests that horizontal
DNA transfer involving many genetic sources has played a major role in diversification of the T4-related phages
and their spread to a wide spectrum of bacterial species domains in evolution. We discuss some of the factors and
pathways that might have shaped the evolution of these phages and point out several parallels between their
diversity and the diversity generally observed within all groups of interrelated dsDNA microbial genomes in nature.
Background
Discovery of the three T-even phages (T2, T4 and T6)
and their subsequent use as model systems to explore the
nature of the gene and genetic mechanisms had a profound impact on the proliferation of interdisciplinary biological research. Indeed, work with these bacterial viruses
during the period between 1920 and 1960 laid down several important foundations for the birth of Molecular
Biology as a field of research that freely integrates the
tools of almost every discipline of the life and physical
sciences [1,2]. Phage T2, the first of the T-even phages to
be isolated (see [3] for a historical perspective) occupied
center stage in most of the early studies, although the
underlying genetic closeness of this phage to T4 and T6

gave reason to treat all three phages as the same biological entity in discussions of what was being learned from
each of them. The switch in attention from T2 to T4
came about largely as a response to two major studies in
which T4 rather than T2 was chosen as the experimental
system. These were the studies initiated by Seymour Benzer in the mid-1950s on the fine-structure of the phage
rIIA and rIIB genes ( see [4] for an overview) and the collaborative studies by Richard Epstein and Robert Edgar
[5] through which an extensive collection of T4 conditional lethal (temperature-sensitive and amber) mutants
was generated [6] and then freely shared with the scientific community. Use of the Epstein-Edgar collection of T4
mutants, as well as comparative studies with T2 and T6
and other T4 relatives isolated from the wild, ultimately
led to detailed descriptions of the structure, replication
and expression of the T4 genome and the morphogenetic
pathways that underlie phage assembly and the release of

phage progeny from infected Escherichia coli hosts (see
[2,7,8] for comprehensive reviews). As the best-studied
member of this group of phages, T4 has become the
reference or prototype for its relatives.
Over the last 50 years, hundreds of T4-related phages
have been isolated from a variety of environmental locations and for a number of different bacterial genera or species [9,10]. The majority of these wild-type phages were
isolated by plating raw sewage or mammalian fecal samples on the same E. coli strains that are commonly used in
laboratories for growing T4 phage stocks or enumerating
T4 plaques on bacterial lawns. The archived E. coli phages
include both close and highly diverged relatives of the
canonical T-even phages, as originally surmised from their
serological properties and relative compatibilities with
each other in pair-wise genetic crosses [11] and later confirmed through partial or complete sequencing of representative phage genomes [12-16]. In addition to the large
number of archived T-even-related phages that grow in
E. coli, there are several (<25) archived relatives of these
phages that do not use E. coli as a host, but instead grow
in other bacterial genera, including species of Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Shigella, Vibrio
or photosynthesizing marine cyanobacteria ([9,10] and
recent GenBank submissions, also see below). The sequencing of the genomes of a number of these phages has
shown that they are all highly diverged from the T-even
phages and that in general, there is a higher degree of
genetic diversity among T4 relatives that are presumably
genetically or reproductively separated from one another
in nature because of their differences in the range of bacterial hosts they can infect [14-17]. The list of sequenced
T4-related phage genomes has more than doubled during
the last 3-4 years, further reinforcing the evidence for
extensive genetic diversity within this group of phages. A
major goal of the current review is to provide updated
information about the sequence database for T4-related
genomes and to summarize their commonalities and differences in the context of what is also being learned from
the comparative genomics of other microbial organisms in
nature. Ecologically, the lytic T4-related phages occupy
the same environmental niches as their bacterial hosts and
together with their hosts probably exercise major control
over these environments.
What is a T4-related or T4-like phage?

The International Committee for the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) has assigned the T-even phages and
their relatives to the “T4-like Viruses” genus, which is
one of six genera of the Myoviridae Family http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/index.htm. Broadly, the Myoviridae are tailed phages (order Caudovirales) with icosahedral head symmetry and contractile tail structures.
Phages listed under the “T4-like Viruses” genus exhibit

morphological features similar to those of the well-characterized structure of phage T4, as visualized by electron
microscopy, and encode alleles of many of the T4 genes
that determine the T4 morphotype [8]. The diversity of
morphotypes among the bacterial viruses is staggering
and to the untrained eye, subtle differences between different Myoviridae or different T4 relatives can be difficult to discern under the electron microscope [9,10]. In
recent years there has been an increased reliance on
information from phage genome sequencing to distinguish between different groups of Myoviridae and
between different phages that can be assigned to the
same group. The hallmark of the T4-like Viruses is their
genetic diversity, which can blur their commonalities
with each other, especially for taxonomists and other
biologists who wish to understand how these and other
groups of dsDNA phages evolve in their natural settings.
As is the case for many other dsDNA phages, the genomes of T4 and its analyzed relatives are mosaics of one
another, consisting of long and short stretches of
homology that intersperse with stretches that lack
homology between relatives [14-18]. Much of this
mosaicism is thought to have resulted from DNA rearrangements, including genetic gains and losses ("indels”),
replacements, translocations, inversions and other types
of events similar to those that have shaped the evolution
of all microbial genomes in nature. It appears that for
the T4-like Viruses, DNA rearrangements have occurred
rampantly around a core of conserved (but mutable)
gene functions that all members of this group of Myoviridae encode. Sequence divergence or polymorphism
within this functionally conserved core is often used to
gain insights into the evolutionary history of these
phages [16,19,20]. As the genome sequence database for
T4 relatives has grown over the last several years, it has
also become increasingly evident that the T4-like
Viruses exist as different clusters that can be distinguished from one another by the higher levels of predicted genetic and biological commonalities between
phages belonging to the same cluster as compared to
phages in different clusters. Clusters of closely interrelated genomes have also been observed with other
groups of dsDNA phages and microbial genomes in
general, e.g., [21,22]. Many of the distinguishing features
between clusters of T4-related phages are predicted to
be the result of an evolutionary history of isolation
within distinct hosts and extensive lateral gene transfer
(LGT), i.e., the importation of genes or exchanges with
a diversity of biological entities in nature. Genomic
mosaicism, which appears to be a common feature of
many groups of interrelated dsDNA phages [23,24],
underscores the discontinuities that can be created by
LGT between different lineages of the same group of
interrelated phage genomes.

The inventory of sequenced T4-related genomes

In Table 1, we have listed 41 T4-related phages for which
substantive genome sequence information is currently
available in public databases, particularly GenBank and
http://phage.bioc.tulane.edu (or http://phage.ggc.edu).
This listing highlights the bacterial genera and species for
which such phages are known to exist [10] and includes
recent entries in GenBank for three phages that grow in
Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Shigella species, respectively. The largest number of archived T4 relatives have
originated from raw sewage or mammalian fecal matter
and detected as plaque formers on lawns of laboratory
strains of E. coli B and by using plating conditions that
are particularly favorable for clear plaque formation by
T4. E. coli K-12 strains have also been used in some cases
(Table 1). The RB phages listed in Table 1 are part of the
largest number of T4 relatives to have been collected
around the same time from approximately the same
environmental source. This collection consists of ~60
phages (not all T4-related) that were isolated by Rosina
Berry (an undergraduate intern) from various sewage

Page 3 of 19

treatment plants in Long Island, New York during the
summer of 1964 for Richard Russell’s PhD project on
speciation of the T-even phages [25]. The RB phages,
which were isolated by using E. coli B as a host, include
both close and distant relatives of the T-even phages and
have received broad attention in comparative studies of
the biochemistry and genetics of the T4 biological system
[2,7,8]. The genomes of most of the distant relatives of
T4 from this collection were sequenced and annotated
several years ago [14-16]. More recently, draft or polished
sequences have also become available for several close
relatives of T4 from this collection as well as for phages
T2 and T6 (see http://phage.ggc.edu for updates). The
other phages listed in Table 1 are from smaller collections that originated through studies by various laboratories, as noted in the references cited in Table 1.
Each of the genomes we discuss in this review has a
unique nucleotide sequence and a genetic composition
that unambiguously distinguish it from the others. Yet, all
of these genomes can be assigned to a single umbrella
group based on shared homologies for a number of genes

that we refer to here as the “Core Genome” of the
T4-related phages, or T4-like Viruses. The genetic background for the Core Genome can vary considerably
between T4 relatives and constitutes an important criterion for distinguishing between close and distant relatives
among the ~40 phage genomes sequenced so far. The
three T-even phages have traditionally been considered to
be closely interrelated on the basis that they share ~85%
genome-wide homology, similar genetic maps and certain
biological properties in common with each other [8,26].
By using comparable criteria for phage genome organization and assortment of putative genes, i.e., predicted openreading frames (ORFs) and tRNA encoding sequences, we
could group the phages listed in Table 1 into 23 different
types of T4 relatives, with the T-even type phages representing the largest group or cluster of closely interrelated
phage genomes sequenced so far. These 23 types and their
distinguishing features are listed in Table 2. The abundance of sequence data for the T-even type phages is largely the result of an effort by J. Nolan (in preparation) to
analyze the genomes of RB phages that had been predicted
by Russell [25] to be closely related to the T4 genome. We
presume that in nature, each type of T4-related phage
listed in Table 2 is representative of a naturally existing
cluster or pool of closely interrelated phages that contains
a record of evolutionary continuities between members of
the pool. A pool of closely interrelated phages would be
expected to exhibit low levels of sequence divergence
between pool members, but might also show evidence of
sporadic deletions, acquisitions, exchanges or other DNA
rearrangements in the otherwise highly conserved genetic
composition.
The listing shown in Table 2 should be regarded as
somewhat arbitrary since setting the homology standard
to a higher or lower value than ~85% can result in different groupings. In fact, as will be explained below for the
T-even type phages, small differences in the genetic composition can have major biological consequences, which
might merit further subdivisions within this cluster. In
addition, as evidenced by information from the recently
analyzed T4 relatives listed in Tables 1 and 2, the isolation
of new T4-related phages for known and newly recognized
bacterial hosts is likely to reveal a greater diversity of
phage genome types and virion morphologies than the listing in Table 2 provides.
Genetic commonalities between T4 relatives

A few years ago, a comparative analysis of ~15 completely or almost completely sequenced T4-related genomes showed that they share two important
characteristics [14]:
1. Their genes are contained in a circularly permuted
order within linear dsDNA chromosomes. In most

Page 4 of 19

cases, this characteristic became evident during the
assembly and annotation of DNA sequence data into
single contiguous sequences (contigs) and in some
cases, the ends of the single contigs were further
confirmed to be contiguous with each other by use
of the PCR [14,17,27]
2. The genomes were each predicted to encode a set
of 31-33 genes that in T4 have been implicated in the
ability of the phage to exercise autonomous control
over its own reproduction. This control includes the
biochemical strategies that determine the circularly
permuted chromosomal design, which is generated
through the integration of the protein networks for
DNA replication, genome packaging and viral assembly in the phage developmental program [8]. This set
of genes amounts to a mere ~12% of the T4 genome.
Expansion of the sequence database to >20 different
types of T4-related genome configurations (Table 2) has
reinforced the observation that a core set of 31-33 genes is
a unifying feature of all T4 relatives. However, it has also
become increasingly evident that other phage genes enjoy
a very wide distribution among these genomes, suggesting
that the minimum number of genes required to generate a
plaque-forming phage with generally similar morphology
to T4 is greater than the number of the universally distributed genes and might vary with specific adaptations of
different clusters of closely interrelated phages in nature.
As is the case with other host-dependent, but partially
autonomously replicating genetic entities in the microbial
world, particularly the bacterial endosymbionts [28-30],
there is usually a dependence on auxiliary functions from
the entity and this dependence can vary with the host in
which the entity propagates. In T4, it is already known
that some phage-encoded functions are essential for phage
growth in some E. coli strains but not others and that in
many instances mutations in one gene can result in
decreased dependence on the function of another gene.
Many such examples of intergenic suppression have been
published and referenced in comprehensive reviews about
the T4 genome [2,7,8]. The analysis of the genomes of
some T4 relatives has also yielded observations suggesting
that ordinarily indispensable biochemical activities might
be circumvented or substituted in certain genetic backgrounds of the phage or host genome. Examples include
two separate instances where the need for the recombination and packaging Endonuclease VII (gp49; encoded by
gene 49), which is essential in T4, appears to have been
circumvented by the evolution of putative alternative
nucleases (through replacements or new acquisitions) in
the E. coli phage RB16 (RB16ORF270c) and the Aeromonas phage 65 (65ORF061w) [14]. Another example is the
possible substitution of the essential dUTPase function
provided by gp56 in T4 by host-like dUTPase genes in the

Taking into consideration the distribution of T4-like
genes in the >20 different types of phage genome configurations listed in Table 2 and the examples of putative
genetic substitutions/acquisitions mentioned above, we
estimate that the Core Genome of the T4-related phages
consists of two genetic components, one highly resistant
and one somewhat permissive to attrition in evolution.
We refer to the genes that are essential under all known
conditions as “Core genes” and those that can be substituted or circumvented in certain genetic backgrounds of
the phage and/or bacterial host as “Quasicore genes”. In
Table 3 and Figure 1 we list the two sets of genes and
highlight their functional interrelationships and some of
the conditions under which some Quasicore genes might
not be required. Interestingly, the absence of members of
the Quasicore set is most often observed in the T4related marine cyanophages, which also exhibit the smallest numbers of T4-like genes and the greatest sequence
divergence in Core genes from any of the other host-specificity groups of T4 relatives listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Possibly, the marine cyanobacteria represent a natural
environment that has favored the evolution of a specific
streamlining of the genetic background for the Core
Genome of T4-related phages. This streamlining might
have been driven through a combination of what the

cyanobacterial hosts could provide as substitutes for physiologically important, but occasionally dispensable functions of these phages and what the phage genomes
themselves might have acquired as alternatives to lost
genes by LGT from other biological entities. We view
each type of phage genomic framework listed in Table 2
as a specific adaptation of the Core Genome in the evolution of these phages in the different bacterial genera or
species where T4 relatives have been detected.
An overview of how the sequenced T4-like Viruses differ
from each other

The T4-related genomes sequenced so far exhibit divergence from one another in several respects including; (a)
the range of bacterial host species that the respective
phages infect, (b) the sizes of these genomes and the capsids (phage heads) in which they are packaged, (c) the
types of modifications, if any, that the genomic DNA
undergoes in vivo, (d) their assortment of protein- and
tRNA-encoding genes, (e) their assortment of T4-like
genes (alleles of T4 genes), (f) the sequence divergence
(mutational drift) and in some cases, the intragenic mosaicism between alleles and (e) the topological arrangement
of alleles and their regulatory signals in the different genomes. Divergence between genomes within some of these
categories appears to have occurred independently of
other categories. For example, phages that share a bacterial

some T4 relatives (e.g. the marine cyanophages and the

tail fiber genes can be difficult or impossible to make
by bioinformatic tools because of extensive mosaicism
or putative substitutions with non-homologous tail-fiber

The precise functions of the rIIA and rIIB gene products
are not known. In T4, rIIA or rIIB mutations exhibit
multiple effects on phage physiology, but are only
lethal in the presence of a lambda prophage.

Like many other Quasicore genes, the rIIA and rIIB
genes are found in all T4 relatives, except the marine
cyanophages. The wide natural distribution of these 2
genes might be a reflection of the distribution of
prophages that restrict T4 relatives in various bacterial
hosts.

host do not necessarily share similar genome sizes, similar
genetic compositions at a global level, similar DNA modifications or similar genome topologies. On the other hand,
phages that infect different bacterial host species seem to
exhibit the highest degree of divergence from each other
in most or all categories. The assignment of T4 relatives
to the different groups or types listed in Table 2 takes into
account shared similarities in most categories, the implication being that members of a phage/genome type are
probably more closely related to each other than they are
to members of other clusters of interrelated phages. For
example, in pair-wise comparisons, the T-even type phages
listed in Table 2 exhibited 85-95% genome-wide homology
(shared alleles) as well as high levels of nucleotide
sequence identity with each other. Most of the dissimilarities between members of this cluster of phages map to
genomic segments that have long been known to be variable between T2, T4 and T6, based on electron microscopic analysis of annealed DNA mixtures from these
phages [26]. Phage genome sequencing has shown that the
hypervariability of these segments among all types of T4
relatives involves: (a) an often-observed mosaicism in tail
fiber genes, (b) unequal distribution of ORFs for putative
homing endonucleases, even between the closest of relatives and (c) a clustering of novel ORFs in the phage

chromosomal segment corresponding to the ~40-75 kb
region of the T4 genome [14-16]. The biological consequences of these genetic differences are significant [2,7,8].
Although distant relatives of the three T-even phages have
been isolated that also use E. coli as a bacterial host (e.g.
phages RB43, RB49, RB69 and others; Table 2), no close
relatives of these canonical members of the T4-like
Viruses genus have yet been found among the phages that
infect bacterial hosts other than E. coli. By using the ORF
composition of the T4 genome as a criterion, we estimate
that the range of homology to this genome (i.e., percentage
of T4-like genes) among the coliphage relatives analyzed
so far is between ~40% (for phage RB43) and ~78% (for
phage RB69). Among the T4 relatives that grow in bacterial hosts other than the Enterobacteria, the homology to
the T4 genome ranges between ~15% T4-like genes in the
genomes of some marine cyanophages and ~40% T4-like
genes in the genomes of some Aeromonas and Acinetobacter phages (Table 2). These homology values reflect the
extent of the heterogeneity that exists in the genetic backgrounds of the two components of the Core Genome
(Figure 1, Table 3) among the different phages or phage
clusters listed in Table 2. The five types of genome configurations currently catalogued among the T4-related marine cyanophages (Table 2) range in size between ~177 kb

(for phage Syn9) and ~252 kb (for phage P-SSM2) and
carry the smallest number of T4-like genes among all currently recognized types of T4 relatives. The range here is
between 40 (for S-PM2) and 47 (for P-SSM2) T4-like
genes per genome [31]. A comprehensive listing of T4
alleles in most of the phages listed in Tables 1 and 2 can
be found in Additional file 1 or online at http://phage.bioc.
tulane.edu and http://phage.ggc.edu. The recent genome
entries in GenBank mentioned earlier for phiSboM-AG3
and phiW-14 predict ~60 T4-like genes, mostly Core and
Quasicore genes, for each. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the notion that components of
the Core Genome have been somewhat resistant to dispersal in evolution, but that the host environment must also
play an important role by determining the most appropriate genetic background of this unifying feature of
T4-related genomes.
Genome size heterogeneity among T4 relatives

In Figure 2 we show a graphic representation of the heterogeneity in genome sizes for the phages listed in Table 2.

The size range observed so far for genomes of the T4-like
Viruses is between ~160,000 and ~250,000 bp (or ~160250 kb). Relatives of T4 with genomes near or larger than
200 kb also exhibit larger and more elongated heads than
phages with genomes in the ~170 kb size range [9,10].
These extraordinarily large T4 relatives have sometimes
been referred to as “Schizo T-even” phages [32] and rank
among the largest known viruses, i.e., the so-called “giant”
or “jumbo” viruses [33]. T4-related giants have been isolated for Aeromonas, Vibrio and marine cyanobacterial
host species, but no such giants have yet been isolated for
T4 relatives that grow in E. coli or the other host species
listed in Table 1. For the Vibrio bacterial hosts, only giant
T4 relatives have been isolated so far, whereas a wide range
of phage genome sizes has been observed among the Aeromonas and cyanobacterial phages. Comparative genomics
has not yet revealed any genetic commonalities between
the T4-related giant phages of Aeromonas, Vibrio and marine bacteria (Fgure 1) that might explain the cross-species
similarities in head morphology. So, it remains unclear
what might have determined the evolution of different

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

stable genome sizes in different phage lineages or clusters.
It is equally possible that giant genomes can evolve from
smaller precursors or can themselves serve as progenitors
of smaller genomes. Detailed studies of the comparative
genomics of the functional linkage between DNA replication, packaging and morphogenesis for the different genome size categories shown in Figure 2 might be needed to
provide explanations for what determines the evolution of
different genome sizes in different phage clusters or
lineages. Also, fine-structure morphological differences do
exist among T4 relatives that are of similar size and share
homologies for structural genes, indicating that the determination of head size and shape can vary with different
combinations of these genes.
Some observations in the T4 biological system further
underscore the plasticity of head-size determination and
the dependence of this plasticity on multiple genetic factors in phage development [8]. Based on mutational
analyses, the interplay of at least four T4 genes can generate larger (more elongated) phage heads containing
DNA chromosomes that are larger than the ~169 kb
size of wild-type T4 DNA. These are the genes for the
major capsid protein (gene 23), portal protein (gene 20),
scaffold protein (gene 22) and vertex protein (gene 24).
In addition, the recombination endonuclease Endo VII
(gp49) and the terminase (gp16 and gp17) play important roles in determining the size of the packaged DNA
in coordination with head morphogenesis (headful
packaging). Possibly, it is the regulation of these conserved gene functions that can diverge coordinately with
increased genetic acquisitions that lead to larger genomes and larger heads in certain cellular environments.
The T4-related Aeromonas phages would be particularly
attractive as experimental systems to explore the evolutionary basis for head-genome size determination
because this subgroup of phages is easy to grow and
contains representatives of the entire range of phage
genome and head sizes observed so far (Figure 2 and
Table 2).
Lateral mobility and the Core Genome of the
T4-like Viruses

It is clear that the Core Genome of the T4-related phages
has spread to the biological domains of a diversity of bacterial genera (Table 1), although it is unclear how this
spread might have occurred and to what degree genetic
exchange is still possible between T4 relatives that are
separated by bacterial species barriers and high sequence
divergence between alleles of the Core and Quasicore
genes listed in Table 3 and Figure 1. Such exchange would
require the availability of mechanisms for transferring
Core Genome components from one bacterial species
domain into another. In addition, shuffled genes would
have to be compatible with new partners. Experimentally,

Page 10 of 19

there is some evidence indicating that the products of
some Core genes, e.g., the DNA polymerase (gp43) and its
accessory proteins (gp45 and gp44/62), can substitute for
their diverged homologues in vivo [12,34-36]. Such observations suggest that the shuffling of Core Genome components between diverged T4 relatives can in some cases
yield viable combinations. However, for the most part
there appear to be major barriers to the shuffling of
Core Genome components between distantly related T4likeViruses in nature. In some respects, the mutational
drift within this common core should provide valuable
insights into its evolutionary history since the last common ancestor of the T4 related genomes examined so far
[19,20]. On the other hand, it should be recognized that
the evolutionary history of the Core Genome is not necessarily a good predictor of whole phage genome phylogeny
because the majority of the genetic background of this
common core varies considerably between the different
types of T4 relatives (Table 2) and is probably derived
from different multiple sources for different phage lineages
or clusters.
Although the Core Genome of the T4-related phages
might resist fragmentation in evolution, it is unclear if
there could have been one or more than one universal
common phage ancestor for all of the genes of this unifying feature of the analyzed T4 relatives. Some answers
about the origins of the different multi-gene clusters
that constitute the Core Genome of these phages might
come from further exploration of diverse environmental
niches for additional plaque-forming phages and other
types of genetic entities that might bear homologies to
the Core and Quasicore genes (Table 3 and Figure 1).
For example, it remains to be seen if there are autonomously replicating phages or plasmids in nature that utilize homologues of the T4 DNA replication genes, but
lack homologues of the DNA packaging and morphogenetic genes of this phage. Conversely, are there phages
in nature with alleles of the genes that determine the T4
morphotype, but no alleles of the T4 DNA replication
genes? The natural existence of such biological entities
could be revealed through the use of the currently available sequence database for T4-related genomes to
design appropriate probes for metagenomic searches of
a broader range of ecological niches than has been
examined so far. Such searches could be directed at specific Core or Quasicore genes [37] or specific features of
the different types of phage genomes listed in Table 2. It
is worth noting that putative homologues of a few
T4 genes have already been detected in other genera of
the Myoviridae, e.g. the Salmonella phage Felix 01
(NC_005282) and the archaeal Rhodothermus phage
RM378 (NC_004735). Both of these phages bear putative homologues of the T4 gene for the major capsid
protein gp23. So, it appears that at least some of the

their specific biochemical roles. DNA replication genes are color-coded dark blue, the recombination/repair genes light blue, the transcription
and translation genes green, the morphogenetic genes red and the genes for aerobic nucleotide reductase (nrdAB) orange.

Core and Quasicore genes of the T4-related phages
(Figure 1, Table 3) can survive lateral transfer and function in genetic backgrounds that lack homologies
to their presumed ancestral partner genes. In addition, a
very recent report [38] describes two Campylobacter
phages (CPt10 and CP220) that appear to be related to
T4, based on the large number of putative T4-like genes
that they bear (see GenBank Accession nos. FN667788
and FN667789). Other recent submissions to GenBank
that deserve attention and further analysis include the
genomes of Salmonella phage Vi01 (FQ312032), and
E. coli phage IME08 (NC_014260; an apparent close
relative of phage JS98). Clearly, the sequence database
for T4-related genomes requires further enhancements
and detailed EM characterization of all of the sequenced
phages is needed before a clear picture can emerge
about the contributions of the host or host ecology to
evolution of the genetic framework and morphological
fine-structure within the extended family of T4 relatives.
Additional evidence suggesting that some Core Genome components of T4 relatives can be subjected to lateral transfer in natural settings comes from the variety
of topologies (different genetic arrangements) that have
been observed for the Core genes in the phages analyzed
so far. In Figure 3, we show six examples of naturally
existing topologies for the set of Core genes listed in
Table 3. The topology exhibited by the T-even type

phages is shared by the majority of the other T4-related
E. coli phages and by all 4 of the T4-related Acinetobacter phages listed in Table 2. Interestingly, the two E. coli
phages RB16 and RB43 exhibit a unique genome topology that has most of the DNA replication genes clustered together in one genomic sector. This RB43 type
topology is also observed in the recently annotated genome of Klebsiella phage KP15 (as we surmise from by
our own examination of GenBank Accession no.
GU295964). Interestingly, the RB16 and RB43 genomes
are rich in a class of putative homing endonuclease
genes (HEGs) that bear sequence similarities to the
genes for a class of DNA-binding proteins that mediate
genetic rearrangements in the developmental programs
of plants [14,39-41]. The other unique genome topologies shown in Figure 3 have been observed for the
Vibrio phage KVP40 (and its close relative nt-1) and
several Aeromonas phages, including the giant phages 65
and Aeh1 (and its close relative phage PX29) and the
smaller phages 25 and 44RR (and its close relative
phage 31), respectively. The marine cyanophages exhibit
yet other topologies for Core Genome components
[31,42]. The diversity of Core Genome topologies underscores the ability of Core and Quasicore genes to function in different orientations and in a variety of genetic
backgrounds and regulatory frameworks [14]. The
genetic regulatory sequences for a number of Core

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

genes, like phage replication genes 43 (DNA polymerase) and 32 (Ssb protein), are highly diverged between
representatives of the different types of T4 relatives
listed in Table 2[14], further reflecting the adaptive
potential of the T4-related Core Genome. Another indication that this genetic core can be prone to lateral
transfer is the observed colonization of some of the
Core or Quasicore genes or their vicinities by mobile
DNA elements, especially intron-encoded and freestanding HEGs [14,43,44]. We will discuss the possible roles
of these elements in the evolution of T4-related genomes later in this review.

Page 12 of 19

mean that there are limits to the number of genetic
backgrounds that can evolve around a certain Core
Genome composition. The limitations might be imposed
by the specific partnership that an evolving phage ultimately establishes with its bacterial host(s). More examples of nearly identical genomes in nature would be
desirable to find since they might provide clues to the
incremental changes by which progenitor genomes can
begin to branch into different lineages through additions, deletions and exchanges in the genetic background of the Core Genome.
Genetic isolation between T4 relatives

The Pangenome of the T4-like Viruses

Collectively, the genetic backgrounds for the Core Genome of the T4 relatives examined for the current report
are predicted to encode a total of ~3000 proteins that
do not exhibit statistically significant sequence matches
to any other proteins outside of the databases for the
T4-related phages. This number of ORFs is ~1.5 orders
of magnitude larger than our estimate of the number of
Core plus Quasicore genes in the Core Genome of these
phages (Figure 1, Table 3), and might be several orders
of magnitude smaller than the union of all the different
ORFs that exist in T4-related phages in nature. We
refer to this union as the “Pangenome” of the T4-like
Viruses, in analogy to the pan genomes of other known
groups of autonomously replicating organisms [30].
Based on results from the recent isolation and analysis
of the T4-related coliphage CC31 and the Acinetobacter
phages Acj9 and Acj61 listed in Table 2 , novel and
highly divergent members of the T4-like Viruses might
be easily detected in environmental samples by taking
advantage of the bacterial host diversity of these phages,
the uniqueness of certain sequences in specific phage
genomes or lineages and other characteristics that distinguish between the different clusters or types of phage
genomes listed in Table 2. The analysis of the genomes
of phages CC31, Acj9 and Acj61, predicted that each
encodes ~120 newly recognized ORFs that can be added
to the growing count of the Pangenome of the T4-like
Viruses (unpublished observations). Such observations
suggest that additional diversity is likely to be uncovered
through the isolation and analysis of larger numbers of
T4 relatives for the known as well as previously unexplored potential bacterial hosts of these phages [38,45].
Despite their plasticity in genome size and their
increasing inventory of new ORFs, there are indications
that natural diversity of the T4-related phages is not
unlimited. We already know of pairs and triplets of
nearly identical (yet distinct) genomes that have been
isolated years apart from each other and from different
geographical areas (Tables 1 and 2). The natural existence of such nearly identical phage genomes might

Genetic separation between interrelated phages can
evolve within a shared bacterial host range, as for example might have occurred for the E. coli phages T4 and
RB69 [25] or come about as a consequence of the transfer of the capacity for whole genome propagation from
one host species to another, as might be represented by
the different host-specificities of the phages listed in
Tables 1 and 2. Insights into the biochemical processes
that might lead to the genetic isolation of a T4-related
genome from close relatives can be drawn from the
number of studies that have been carried out on phagephage exclusion and host-mediated restriction of the
T-even phages [8,46,47]. As explained below, the three
T-even phages and their close relatives (T-even type
phages, Table 2) represent a scenario in which small
changes in a genome might result in major effects on its
compatibility with a parental genotype.
Phages T2, T4 and T6 can undergo genetic recombination and phenotypic mixing with each other in vivo
(in pair-wise co-infections of their shared E. coli hosts),
but they are also partially incompatible with each other
under these conditions [11]. The genomes of these
phages encode similar, but distinct enzyme networks
that modify their genomes and prevent their restriction
by gene products encoded by the bacterial hosts and/or
certain prophages or defective prophages that can reside
in some of these hosts [46,47]. In addition, a few genetic
differences between these otherwise closely interrelated
phages cause them to be partially incompatible. The
genes known to be involved in T-even phage genome
modification and restriction are listed in Table 4. Some
of these genes specify the modification of phage genomic DNA with glucosylated hydroxymethyl (gluc-Hm)
groups at dCMP residues, whereby the DNA becomes
resistant to host restriction activities, particularly the
E. coli Mcr (Rgl) enzyme system. Other phage genes are
responsible for commandeering the host transcription
system for expression of the modified phage DNA and
away from the expression of any DNA (including the
host genome) that does not carry the phage-induced
modifications [8,48,49]. Subtle differences in phage

T2, T4 and T6 encode homologous dCTPase-dUTPase
(gp56; gene 56), dCMP-hydroxymethylase (gp42; gene 42)
and dNMP kinase (gp1; gene 1) enzymes that together create a pool of hydroxymethylated-dCTP (Hm-dCTP) for
phage DNA synthesis. The Hm-dCMP of the synthesized
DNA is further modified by the addition of glucose molecules to the Hm groups. The glucosylation is carried out
differently and to different extents between the three
phage relatives. They all encode homologues of an aglucosyltransferase (agt gene) that adds glucose molecules
to the Hm groups in the a-configuration; however, the T2
and T4 enzymes glucosylate 70% whereas the T6 enzyme
glucosylates only 3% of these groups in the respective genomes. The three phages also differ in a second wave of
glucosylations of the genomic Hm-dCMP. T4 encodes a b.
glucosyltransferase (bgt gene) that adds glucose (in the
b-configuration) to the rest of the unglucosylated HmdCMP residues in the phage DNA, whereas T2 and T6
lack a bgt gene and instead encode a b-1,6-glucosyl-aglucose transeferase (bagt gene) that adds glucose to the
glucose moieties of some of the preexisting a-glucosylated
Hm-dCMP residues, thus resulting in modification of the
respective Hm-dCMP residues with gentobiose. This second glucosylation occurs at 70% of the a-glucosylated residues in T2 as compared to only ~3% of these residues in
T6. That is, ~25% of the Hm-dCMP residues in T2 and
T6 remain unglucosylated. Enzymes of the bacterial host

synthesize the UDP-glucose (UDPG) used for the glucosylation reactions by the phage-induced enzymes. Interestingly, all of the close relatives of the T-even phages listed
in Table 2 (T-even type phages) are predicted to encode
agt and bagt genes, i.e., they are similar to T2 and T6 in
their glucosylation genes. However, the glucosylation
patterns of these relatives have not been analyzed. Also, it
is worth noting that currently, T4 is the only member of
the T4-like Viruses genus known to encode a- and
b-glucosyltransferases. A distant relative of the T-even type
phages, the coliphage CC31 (GU323318), is predicted to
encode the unique combination of bgt and bagt genes and
currently, is the only other phage besides T4 in which a
bgt gene has been detected by bioinformatic analyses.
Differences in DNA modification patterns, such as
those that exist between the three T-even phages might
open windows for phage-encoded nucleases that are
able to distinguish between their own genomes and the
genomes of dissimilarly modified close relatives. Also, as
has been observed in T4, a lack of Hm-dCMP glucosylation can render the Hm-dCMP-containing phage DNA
susceptible to the host-encoded Mcr (Rgl) restriction
system, as well as the restriction systems of some prophages that can reside in E. coli or other potential
Enterobacterial hosts [46,47]. Possibly, the unglucosylated Hm-dCMP sites in the T2 and T6 genomes escape
restriction activities originating from the host through
protection by the DNA modifications in their vicinity or
through evolutionary adjustments in the expression of
phage genes that control the susceptibility of phage
DNA to the host-encoded restriction activities. In T4,

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

the gene 2 protein (gp2), which attaches to DNA ends,
protects against degradation by the host RecBCD exonuclease (Exo V) and the arn gene product (Arn protein)
protects unglucosylated Hm-dCMP DNA against the
host Mcr system [50-52] (Table 4). It would be interesting to find out if the arn gene and gene 2 are controlled
differently in the different T-even type phages. All the
phages in this cluster are predicted to encode homologues of T4 genes 56, 42, 2 and arn (Table 4) and at
least some of them exhibit partial mutual exclusion with
the T-even phages [25]. Elucidating the molecular basis
for the partial incompatibilities within this cluster of
closely interrelated phages might shed light on some
subtle differences in phage genome adaptation that can
begin to transition close relatives towards total genetic
isolation from each other.
Additional factors that can potentially contribute to
phage-phage exclusion between relatives that share the
same bacterial host are the products of phage-specific
nuclease genes, some of which might be imported into
evolving phage genomes through lateral DNA transfer.
Among these are genes for homing enzymes (HEGs),
which exist as different types and in variable numbers
among T4-related phage genomes. At least three HEGencoded nucleases have been implicated in the partial
exclusion of T2 by T4 [53-55]. Other types of inhibition
of one T4-related phage by another are also possible
and might potentially be discovered among the predicted products of the numerous novel ORFs in the
Pangenome of the T4-like Viruses. The distribution of
HEGs in the genomes of the phages listed in Tables 1
and 2 is discussed later in this review.
There are some distant relatives of the T-even phages
that encode homologues of genes 42 and 56, but that
lack homologues of the glucosyltransferase genes. Examples are the coliphages RB69 and JS98 and the Aeromonas salmonicida phages 44RR, 31 and 25 (see Table 2
for GenBank Accession nos.). These gene 42-encoding
phages also encode homologues of the T4 genes that
have been implicated in phage-induced degradation or
inhibition of the expression of unmodified (dCMP-containing) DNA, i.e., the alc, denA and denB genes (Table
4). It is not yet known if phages like RB69 and JS98 are
adapted to having Hm-dCMP instead of glucosylated
Hm-dCMP in their DNA (e.g., through effective inhibition of the host restriction systems) or if they encode
other types of modifications to the Hm-dCMP residues
that provide similar protection from restriction by the
host as does the glucosylation in T-even type phages. In
addition, there are many T4 relatives that lack homologies to the entire gene network that controls DNA modification and expression of glucosylated DNA in phage
T4, including genes 42 and 56, the glucosyl-transferase
genes and the arn, alc and denB genes. The dCMP of

Page 14 of 19

the genomes of these phages probably lacks major modifications, as suggested by studies that have demonstrated a sensitivity of some of these genomes to certain
Type II restriction endonucleases that fail to digest wildtype (modified) T4 genomic DNA [56]. Elucidation of
the host-phage interactions that allow these seemingly
unmodified phage genomes to propagate without being
restricted by their hosts would be important for developing a better understanding of how the Core Genome
of the T4-related phages has succeeded in spreading
across bacterial species barriers in nature.
One example of a total incompatibility between phage
T4 and a relative that also grows in E. coli is the exclusion of T4 by phage RB69 [25]. The T4 and RB69 genomes are >75% homologous over very long stretches of
their genomes, but when introduced into the same host
cells they generate no viable phage recombinants
between them and only RB69 phage progeny are made.
The sequencing of the RB69 genome has revealed considerable divergence in the nucleotide sequences of most of
its alleles of T4 genes. So, it is not surprising that the T4
and RB69 have not been observed to exchange DNA
through homologous recombination [12,35]. However,
the sequence divergence between the two genomes does
not explain why RB69 completely excludes T4 [25]. Interestingly, the RB69 genome is predicted to lack HEGs
whereas T4 is predicted to encode many such nuclease
genes. Yet, it is T4 rather than RB69 that suffers exclusion by its relative. The six types of T4-related phages
that can grow in E. coli (Table 2) could potentially serve
as excellent sources of material for studies of the multiple
factors that can transition T4-related genomes from partial to total genetic isolation from each other despite
access to the same bacterial host domain. Technological
developments in DNA and genome analysis since the
early studies on T4-related phage-phage exclusion should
make it possible to develop PCR-based high-throughput
methodologies for examining large populations of phage
progeny from crosses between compatible, partially compatible or incompatible phages.
Agents of lateral DNA transfer in T4-related genomes

Although horizontal DNA transfer is suspected to play a
major role in the evolution of the T4-related phages, particularly in diversification of the Pangenome of these
phages, there are few clues about the agents that might
mediate such transfer. Typically, the junctions between
Core Genome components and adjacent DNA presumed
to be imported by lateral transfer show no similarities to
the familiar sequence signatures of known bacterial
mobile elements that insert through site-specific and
transpositional recombination [57]. Ectopic insertions
(DNA additions) and illegitimate reciprocal or nonreciprocal recombination (DNA replacements) in the natural

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

pools of evolving T4-related phages are possible causes
for diversification of phage genomes through DNA rearrangements [58,59]; however, it is unclear if such events
are more likely to occur in dsDNA phage evolution (or
the evolution of the T4-like Viruses in particular) than in
the evolution of bacterial and other cellular genomes in
the microbial world. The diversity observed among the
T4-related genomes examined so far appears to be of a
similar magnitude to the diversity seen between distantly
interrelated bacterial genera [60]. For example, in Aeh1,
KVP40 and the cyanobacterial phages (Table 2), >85% of
the genetic composition is unique to the type of T4related phage genome and presumed to have originated
through DNA rearrangements that assembled these genomes from core and variable components. The plasticity
of genome size and the ability of modules of Core genes
to function in a variety of orientations and genetic neighborhoods (Figure 3) suggest that genomes of the T4-like
Viruses are particularly receptive to genetic gains and
losses that might improve their adaptation to new environments. In addition, based on studies with T4 [8,61],
these genomes are predicted to encode a highly active
enzyme system for homologous recombination that has
evolved to be an integral part of the machinery for genome replication, maintenance and packaging. It is known
that the enzymes for homologous recombination can also
mediate non-homologous (or “illegitimate”) exchanges
between marginally similar or even dissimilar genetic
sequences in all DNA-based biological systems. An evolving T4-related genome might incorporate foreign DNA
through at least two pathways that involve illegitimate
recombination; (a) traditional reciprocal exchanges with
foreign genetic entities (genetic replacements) and (b)
initiation of DNA replication through the invasion of
intracellular phage DNA pools by free 3’ ends of foreign
DNA (genetic additions; see also [8]). The production of
viable phage recombinants by way of such events might
be rare, but the observed mosaicism between the known
T4-related phages is clear evidence that genetic shuffling
has been rampant in the evolution of these phages.
Homing endonucleases as possible mediators
of T4-related genome diversification

Other agents that might facilitate the acquisition of
novel DNA into evolving T4-related genomes are the
DNA endonucleases, especially homing endonucleases.
Homing enzymes have been experimentally shown to
mediate the unidirectional transfer of DNA between closely related T4-like genomes in two types of scenarios,
intron homing [43,44] and intronless homing [53,54].
Both types of homing utilize homologous recombination
between phages co-infecting the same bacterial host to
complete the transfer of genetic information from the
endonuclease-encoding genome to a recipient genome

Page 15 of 19

that lacks the gene for the endonuclease. In Table 5, we
summarize the distribution of putative HEGs among the
T4-related genomes sequenced so far. The abundance
and variable distributions of these genes in this pool of
interrelated phage genomes suggests that T4 and its
relatives are attractive natural homes for this category of
transposable elements. Also, as indicated in Table 5,
most of the known or predicted HEGs in these phages
exist as freestanding ORFs in the phage genomes. There
are only three HEGs known that reside inside self-splicing group I introns and that have been experimentally
implicated in intron homing [62]. All three reside in the
cluster of T-even type phages [63] and have probably
spread within this cluster in natural settings. In contrast,
there is no convincing evidence that these elements
have moved across the bacterial species and genera that
separate the different clusters or phage/genome types
listed in Table 2. Nevertheless, recently observed novel
activities of HEGs suggest that this category of transposable genes might be capable of generalized transposition without leaving traces of their involvement in the
lateral transfer.
In both intron-homing and intronless-homing the
primary role of the homing endonuclease is to introduce a dsDNA break in the genome destined to receive
the HEG-containing intron or freestanding HEG. It is
the repair process for the dsDNA break that ultimately
provides a copy of the donor DNA for recombination
into the recipient through a gene conversion event. In
this regard, any endonuclease that creates dsDNA
breaks might be a potential mediator of lateral DNA
transfer [64,65]. Since the enzymes for homologous
recombination can mediate exchanges between marginally similar or even dissimilar sequences, it is possible
that a variety of endonucleases can initiate illegitimate
genetic exchanges.
There are at least three examples of freestanding
HEGs in T4-related phages that are suspected to encode
the homing enzymes for introns lacking HEGs of their
own [36,55,65]. The natural existence of such HEGs
raises the possibility that some homing enzymes can
mediate the transposition of DNA that is distantly
located from their own structural genes without necessarily co-transferring the HEG itself. Such a role for
HEGs would be consistent with the observation that
much of the mosaicism between T4-related genomes is
usually not associated with closely linked HEGs; however, no experimental evidence is currently available in
support of the notion that HEGs can create mosaicism
at distant genetic loci. Considering the wide distribution
of HEGs in what is probably only a small sampling of
the diversity of T4-related genomes in nature, this class
of genomes might ultimately prove to be a rich repository of other as yet unidentified families of HEGs.

It is perhaps not surprising that introns appear to be
much less abundant than HEGs in T4-related genomes.
To persist in evolution, introns must be able to guarantee the survival of their host by maintaining their selfsplicing activities. Introns depend on homing enzymes
for their spread, although they can integrate less frequently through reverse splicing [66,67]. In contrast,

1
2

untranslated intercistronic regions offer a much larger
selection of potential targets for the insertion of HEGs,
which might also enter genomes through rare ectopic
insertion [68]. The three group I introns that have been
described for the T-even type phages all encode their
own HEGs , i.e., the introns in the td (I-TevI), nrdB (ITevII) and nrdB (I-TevII) genes (Table 5). A fourth

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

group I intron was recently described for the DNA polymerase gene (gene 43) of the Aeromonas salmonicida
phage 25 (Intron 25.g43B) [36]. This intron lacks its
own HEG, but is predicted to use a freestanding HEG
for mobility. Another putative group I intron can be
detected in gene 43 of the recently published genome
sequence of phage JSE, a close relative of phage RB49
[69]. Our own examination of this sequence suggests
that the JSE intron contains a truncated derivative of a
former HEG, i.e., much like the existence of a truncated
HEG in the intron of the T4 nrdB gene [70]. Such HEG
truncations might add to the difficulties in detecting
traces of these mobile elements in contemporary phage
genomes.
In summary, the observations cited above suggest that
the self-mobilizing freestanding HEGs are potential
agents of lateral transfer that might contribute to genomic mosaicism by mobilizing a variety of genetic
sequences in phage genomes, including introns and
flanking as well as distant DNA and genes or gene
clusters.
Concluding remarks

Genomes of the T4-like Viruses are repositories of a
diversity of genes for which no biological roles have
been assigned or can be predicted on the basis of comparisons to other sequences in databases. The reference
for these phages, phage T4, has been extensively studied
[2,7,8] and provides a rational basis for suspecting that
the diversity among its relatives is a reflection of adaptations of a core phage genome to a variety of challenges
in evolution, including encounters with new host environments. Experimentally, many T4 genes that are not
essential for phage propagation in some bacterial hosts
or genetic backgrounds are nevertheless essential in
others (see [8] for examples). Bacterial genomes are
themselves dynamic entities that are subject to the trafficking of prophages, plasmids and possibly other entities that can restrict or complement the propagation of
other invaders of bacteria. There are at least three
examples in the T4 biological system where prophages
or defective prophages can restrict T4 phage growth.
These are the restriction of T4 rII mutants by lambda
lysogens, the restriction of unglucosylated HMC-DNA
by P1 lysogens and the restriction of late phage gene
expression by the e14 element [8]. Such examples
underscore the important role that the host (and its
resident prophages) must play in determining the T4related genotype required for survival in the host environment. The range of natural bacterial hosts for any of
the phages listed in Tables 1 and 2 might be much
broader than what is available or has been used in
laboratories to propagate these phages and evaluate
their physiology. The isolation of new T4 relatives for

Page 17 of 19

known bacterial hosts as well as the identification of
new bacterial hosts for known and new types of T4related phages would be important for bridging the
many gaps in our understanding of how the T4-like
Viruses have managed to spread across bacterial species
barriers. At the very least, the current sequence database
for these Myoviridae should prove to be a rich source of
genetic markers for bioprospecting as well as being a
mine of reagents for basic research and biotechnology.
In regard to studies of the basic mechanisms of molecular evolution, the T4-like Viruses constitute a large
pool of interrelated autonomously replicating entities
that are highly accessible to analysis of broadly applicable
concepts in biology. The genomes of these viruses are
large by viral standards and exhibit many parallels to the
mosaicism and diversity of prokaryotic cellular genomes.
The phage genomes analyzed so far (Table 2) could be
used as reference points for the analysis, especially
through metagenomic tools, of large populations of closely interrelated phages within specific ecological
domains without having to isolate these phages as plaque-forming units. This would be particularly important
for the detection of commonalities between T4-related
genomes and other types of genomes in the microbial
world. In addition, such metagenomic approaches would
be useful for detecting the continuities and abrupt discontinuities that occur at the branch points between
phage lineages.
As potential sources of interesting gene products for
studies of biological structure and function, one needs
only to scan the literature for the numerous examples
where T4-encoded proteins have been used to elucidate
the mechanisms of processes common to most organisms, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation,
genetic recombination, mutation, homing and others.
One of the most important paths to biological diversification is the path to changes in the specificities of proteins
and nucleic acids that retain their essential biochemical
activities. The collection of sequenced T4-related phages
is already a rich source of such examples of diversification of protein specificity.
Finally, we should mention the resurgence of interest
in bacterial viruses as sources of toxins [71] and as
potential therapeutic agents against bacterial pathogens
[72,73]. T4 and its known relatives are classical examples of how virulent a virus can be against one bacterial
host and ineffective against many other bacteria. These
phages have no other lifestyle but the one leading to cell
death and they use multiple targets in their attacks on
hosts. The different specificities with which the T4-like
Viruses recognize and inhibit different bacterial host
species raise hopes that phage-induced gene products
can be found that are highly specific to targets in specific bacterial pathogens. By using combinations of these

Petrov et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:292
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/292

gene products to attack multiple targets the development of bacterial resistance against these biological
drugs would become highly unlikely. Bacteriophage
genomics and particularly the genomics of T4-related
phages are opening windows to many new frontiers of
basic and applied biology.
