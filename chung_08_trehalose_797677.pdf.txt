Abstract
Trehalose in ectoderms functions in energy metabolism and protection in extreme environmental
conditions. We structurally characterized trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS) from hemocytes
of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. C. sapidus Hemo TPS (CasHemoTPS), like insect TPS, encodes
both TPS and trehalose phosphate phosphatase domains. Trehalose seems to be a major sugar, as
it shows higher levels than does glucose in hemocytes and hemolymph. Increases in HemoTPS
expression, TPS enzyme activity in hemocytes, and hemolymph trehalose levels were determined
24 h after lipopolysaccharide challenge, suggesting that both TPS and TPP domains of CasHemoTPS
are active and functional. The TPS gene has a wide tissue distribution in C. sapidus, suggesting
multiple biosynthetic sites. A correlation between TPS activity in hemocytes and hemolymph
trehalose levels was found during the molt cycle. The current study provides the first evidence of
presence of trehalose in hemocytes and TPS in tissues of C. sapidus and implicates its functional role
in energy metabolism and physiological adaptation.

Background
Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide is a primary
energy source in prokaryotes, yeasts, plants, and invertebrates. The accumulation of trehalose in anhydrobioses of
artemia, nematodes, and chironomids [1-3] implies a role
in physiological and biochemical adaptations in extreme
environmental conditions.
In insects, trehalose is the major hemolymph sugar that is
exclusively synthesized in the fat body in which hypertrehalosemic hormone (HTH) positively regulates its production. In addition, flight, feeding, and parasitic
infections in insects have been shown to produce hypertrehalosemia, i.e. an increase in trehalose in hemolymph
[4-6]. These findings further support trehalose as an

energy source and its involvement in physiological adaptation in insects.
Trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is noted in insects
as a fused gene that codes two functional domains in tandem: TPS, a homolog of Ost A of Escherichia coli, and trehalose 6-phophate phosphatase (TPP), a homolog of Ost B
of E. coli. Drosophila TPS introduced into human HEK-293
cells increased hypoxia tolerance by which elevated trehalose reduced protein aggregation under hypoxia [2,7].
This result indicates two domains of TPS and TPP are
active. However, a relationship between the level of TPS
expression and TPS enzyme activity resulting in the
increase in trehalose production has not been described in
insects.

In contrast to hypertrehalosemic response under stress
and during flight activity in insects, the increase in glucose
level in hemolymph (i.e. hyperglycemia) of crustaceans
has been described during their initial physiological adaptation to stressful environments [8-15]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, an accepted method for mimicking a
pathogen infection, also induced hyperglycemia through
modulating the level of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone [13]. The glycogen present in many crustacean tissues, including hemocytes, is tacitly accepted as the source
of this hyperglycemia. Previous reports of the involvement of trehalose in osmoregulation and cold adaptation
in crustaceans [16,17] and the ubiquitous abundance of
trehalose in insect hemolymph as an energy source and its
protective roles under stress emphasize the importance of
this molecule in invertebrates. Therefore, we investigated
the presence of TPS gene and trehalose in the blue crab,
Callinectes sapidus, the population of which has been drastically declining in the Chesapeake Bay [18], in order to
better understand the role of this sugar in energy metabolism during molt cycles and physiological adaptation
under stressful conditions. Particularly, in an attempt to
define an adaptive role of trehalose in a different physiological status of C. sapidus, we challenged animals with
LPS that generally induced the response of a pathogen
infection as well as the stress response of hyperglycemia in
crustaceans [13,15]. We demonstrated hypertrehalosemic
and hyperglycemic responses by LPS injection into the
animal that was accompanied by increases in TPS expression and TPS enzyme activity in hemocytes. A relationship
between TPS activity in hemocytes and the level of hemolymph trehalose during a molt cycle was established.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic tree analysis of multiple sequence alignments
of TPS gene
CasHemoTPS (GenBank accession no. EU679406) consisting of 755 amino acid encodes a putative TPS and a
TPP domain in tandem. Phylogenic tree analysis of multiple sequence alignments of TPS gene revealed that C. sapidus Hemocytes TPS (CasHemoTPS) is closely related to
those of insects, forming a separate group from E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisae, and Ulva prolifera (Fig. 1) [19]. The
TPS gene in arthropods appears to be a fused gene of a
homolog of Ost A and Ost B in E. coli.
Spatial distribution of TPS gene expression in various
tissues of C. sapidus
cDNAs of various tissues prepared from an adult male and
female C. sapidus were tested for the TPS expression. As
shown in Fig. 2, TPS expression was ubiquitous in all the
tissues of both sexes of adult crabs, indicating that all
these tissues could produce trehalose. It appears that multiple isoforms of TPS genes are present in tissues of the
blue crab, as three of these, coding both TPS and TPP,
have already been identified (unpublished observation).
This wide distribution of TPS gene in crab tissues is surprising in contrast to what has been described in insects.
In insects, the fat body is known as the exclusive biosynthetic site of trehalose [4,20,21]. After synthesis in the fat
body, trehalose is released into hemolymph and serves as
a major hemolymph sugar for energy required during
flight.

Our result demonstrates that hemocytes possess TSP and
Treh for the synthesis and metabolism of trehalose. More
importantly, they modulate cellular trehalose levels for
physiological and biochemical adaptation under LPS
challenge, through the dynamic regulation of the expression of TPS and TPS enzyme activity. Furthermore, our
data indicate that C. sapidus expresses TPS in multiple tissues, in contrast to insects where the fat body is considered the exclusive biosynthesis site of this sugar.
Considering trehalose is the major blood sugar, it is also
likely to be involved in crustacean hyperglycemia. We
anticipate its ubiquitous presence in most if not all crustacean hemolymph with similar functions as those found in
insects.

The effect of LPS on the expression of TPS, TPS activity
and trehalose levels
Animals were challenged by the injection of 1 μg LPS to
test the response of trehalose. The resting level of trehalose in hemocytes was higher than in hemolymph: 3.5 ±
0.3 mg (n = 6) (Fig. 3A) and 1.1 ± 0.1 mg/ml (n = 6),
respectively. In contrast, the level of glucose was higher in
hemolymph than in hemocytes: 180 ± 14.6 μg/ml (n = 6)
and 70 ± 10 μg/mg protein in hemocyte extracts (n = 6),
respectively (Fig. 3B). Overall, the concentration of trehalose was higher than glucose in both hemolymph and
hemocytes: 6 and 50 fold, respectively, suggesting that trehalose is a major sugar in crab hemolymph as in insects
[4,21]. The intracellular level of trehalose was increased
~2.5 fold in response to the LPS challenge, while a modest
1.5 fold elevation of glucose was found. LPS injection
after 24 h did not cause general hypertrehalosemia or
hyperglycemia in hemolymph in C. sapidus, although it
was reported that a much higher dose of LPS induced
hyperglycemia after 2 h in other crustacean species
[13,15]. LPS induced a significant 2.5 fold increase in
HemoTPS mRNA, a three fold increment of TPS activity,
compared to those of the controls (Figs. 3C and 3D). This
could be responsible for the increase in trehalose levels in
Fig. 3A. A slight change (130%) in the level of trehalase
(Treh) mRNA that breaks down trehalose into two glucose
molecules is responsible for the modest rise (1.5 fold) in
intracellular glucose. The basal level of TPS mRNA in
hemocytes was ~100 fold less than that of Treh.

Levels of TPS activity in hemocytes and trehalose in
hemolymph during a molt cycle
Concentrations of trehalose in hemolymph of C. sapidus
showed a bimodal pattern that exhibited two peaks during molt cycle, at early ecdysis and post ecdysis C1–3 (Fig.
4). The lowest level of trehalose (0.65 ± 0.05 mg/ml
hemolymph, n = 8) was measured at stage A during and
after the occurrence of the largest water intake occurred
[22,23]. The fluctuation of TPS activity in hemocytes was
also noted during the molt cycle from the lowest at intermolt to the highest at postmolt stage B: 0.3 ± 0.08 μmol/
h/mg protein in hemocyte extracts (n = 12) and 1.98 ±
0.74 μmol/h/mg protein in hemocyte extracts (n = 7),
respectively. TPP enzyme activity of HemoTPS was determined only at intermolt by measuring [Pi] in the same
samples that were prepared for TPS activity. The activity of
TPP was slightly high: 0.78 ± 0.41 μmol [Pi]/h/mg protein
in hemocyte extracts (n = 5), however, this value was not
significantly different from that of TPS activity. In general,
TPS activity was elevated at premolt and peaked at stage B,
which correlates with the highest concentration of trehalose noted at stage C1–3. The level of trehalose and TPS
activity at the postmolt stage imply a possible involvement of this sugar in chitin synthesis, as found in insects
[24]. Chitin synthesis is required for cuticle hardening
and the calcification process in the exoskeleton of animals
after ecdysis.

Conclusion
We isolated, for the first time in crustaceans, the cDNA
sequence of the TPS gene coding functional and active
domains of TPS and TPP in hemocytes of C. sapidus where
its expression was widespread in most tissues. LPS injection into animals, mimicking the induction of internal
stress, stimulated the expression and enzyme activity of
TPS in hemocytes, resulting in the increase in intracellular
trehalose in hemocytes. Our results provide evidence of
the presence and a possible adaptive function of trehalose
in energy metabolism and stress response of decapod
crustaceans.

Materials and methods
Animals
Juvenile blue crabs, C. sapidus (20–30 mm carapace
width), were received from the blue crab hatchery in the
Aquaculture Research Center, Center of Marine Biotechnology (University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute,
Baltimore, MD) and reared as described [25].
5', 3' RACEs of C. sapidus TPS gene
Hemocytes were harvested from 1 ml hemolymph withdrawn in a sterilized marine anticoagulant (filtered
through 0.22 μm membrane) at 1:1 ratio and immediately spun at 800 g for 10 min 4°C. After discarding the
plasma, the pelleted cells were washed once in 100 μl of
anticoagulant and re-centrifuged as above. The washed
hemocytes were homogenized and total RNA extraction
and quantification were carried out by following the pro-

cedures as described [26]. Degenerate primers of TPS were
generated based on the conserved region of insect genes
listed in GenBank using a multiple alignment program,
CLUSTALW http://www.genome.jp).
The synthesis of 3' RACE cDNA of total RNA of hemocytes
was carried out using GeneRacer™ (Invitrogen), while 5'
RACE cDNAs was produced using SMART cDNA synthesis
kit (BD Biosciences). Touchdown PCR was employed for
initial amplification of TPS: dF1 (5'TTYGAYTCYTAYTA
YAAYGG3') and dR1 (5'TCDCCRGCDCCRGCRAAD
GG3'). The cDNA was amplified with Advantage Taq
polymerase (BD Biosciences) at the following PCR conditions: after initial denaturation for 2.5 min at 94°C, 3
cycles each step at annealing temperatures: 47°C, 45°C,
and 43°C and the final step at 48°C for 25 cycles. The
final amplification was achieved at annealing temperature

48°C. The touchdown PCR products served as templates
for the nested PCR of TPS with a primer combination of
dF2 (5' TTYTGGCCNYTNTTYCAYTCYATGCC 3') and dR2
(5'ATYT GRCARGCSACRAAYTC3') at 55°C annealing
temperature. For the TPS gene, the cDNA from hemocytes
produced a band with an expected size of 900 bp. The
cloning and sequencing procedures were as stated [27].
Based on the obtained C. sapidus sequences of TSP, the following gene specific primers (listed in table 1) were made
for the completion of 5', 3' RACE.
Spatial distribution of TPS in various tissues of C. sapidus
Tissues were collected from male and female crabs at
intermolt stage after they were anesthetized on ice as follows: eyestalk, brain, thoracic ganglion, antennal gland,
gill, hindgut, heart, chelae muscle, hypodermis, testis or
ovary, hepatopancreas, and Y-organ. Total RNAs were
extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and quantified with a
NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific). After treatment with
DNase I to eliminate genomic DNA contamination, one
μg of total RNAs were used for the first cDNA synthesis
with MMLV and random hexamers (Promega). Samples
of cDNAs (each 12.5 ng) were amplified with a combination of primers: forward, 5'ATGTTGGTGGAACACAATTC
AAGGAC3' and reverse, 5' TACAGAAGAGTCTCGGTAGAATGCA for TPS. Arginine kinase, a reference gene, was
amplified using the same primers as described [27]. The
PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at
94°C for 2.5 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 20 sec, 60°C for
20 sec, 70°C for 30 sec sec, and final step at 70°C for 5
min. PCR products were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Lipopolysaccharide challenge
Prior to the injection of LPS or saline, 100 μl of hemolymph was withdrawn from juvenile animals (70–90 mm,
carapace width) as described [27] to establish the resting
levels of glucose and trehalose in hemocytes. Animals in

analysis.

the test group received 1 μg LPS (E. coli 0111:B4, Sigma)
in 100 μl crustacean saline, while control animals received
100 μl saline alone. 24 h after injection, 500 μl of hemolymph were withdrawn in an anticoagulant at a ratio of 1:1
and immediately centrifuged as described above. The
hemocytes were re-suspended in ice cold DEPC treated
PBS or Tris buffered saline and homogenized. Half of the
samples were dedicated for estimating glucose, trehalose,
and TPS activity, while the rest were used for RNA extraction as described above. Hemocyte protein was determined using BioRad DC protein assay (BioRad).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis (QRT-PCR)
The extraction and quantification procedures of total RNA
of hemocytes and cDNA synthesis were stated in Chung
and Zmora [27]. Standards for QRT-PCR were produced
as described [25]. Sample cDNAs (12.5 – 25 ng) were analyzed for the estimation of the expressions of TPS using
primers of QF: 5' ATGTTGGTGGAACACAATTCAAGGA
C3' and QR: 5' CTTTGTATAATCTAACCGATCCACTC3'
and the data were calculated as copy number/μg of total
RNA of hemocytes. The level of hemocyte trehalase (Treh,
GenBank accession no. EU679407) was quantified using
the following primers, QF: 5' GCAGAGAGTGGATGGG
A3' and QR: 5' CCCTGACAGCAGCAAGCCCTCA3'. The
expression levels of TPS and Treh were represented as copy
number/μg total RNA as described [26].
Estimation of glucose and trehalose in hemocytes
Glucose levels in hemocytes were determined using glucose oxidase/peroxidase assay (Sigma) as described [28].
Trehalose concentration in hemocytes was estimated by
subtracting the amount of glucose from the values determined by anthrone assay, as this assay measures both sugars [29]. Trehalose (Sigma) was used for the standard of
anthrone assay. The results were presented as μg glucose
or mg trehalose/mg protein in hemocyte extracts.
Two-step TPS activity assay
TPS activity in hemocytes was estimated using a modified
procedure that was previously described [30,31]. For the
first step of the synthesis of trehalose 6-phospate, 100 μg
of extracts from hemocytes was incubated in 200 μl final
volume of the first reaction mixture containing 50 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.1), 5 mM UDP-glucose (UDPG), 10
mM glucose-6-phosphate, and 12.5 mM MgCl2 at 35°C
for 30 min. In controls, glucose-6-phosphate was omitted.
The reactions were terminated with heat treatment at
100°C for 5 min and were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
5 min at room temperature. For the second step, the
supernatants (150 μl) were further incubated at 35°C for
10 min in the following reaction mixture (150 mM
HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5
mM NADH, 5 U lactic dehydrogenase and 5 U pyruvate
kinase). Samples were cooled on ice for 5 min and briefly

centrifuged for 13,000 rpm for 1 min. 100 μl of the supernatant was placed into a 96 well plate, and the absorbance
was measured at 340 nm (Spectra M5, Molecular Device).
Known concentrations of UDP at 1000, 500, 250, 125,
and 62.5 nmol were treated as above and served for a
standard curve. TPS activity was calculated per μmol UDP/
h/mg hemocyte protein.
Trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) assay
In order to test the functionality of TPP domain of CasHemoTPS, the hemocytes were extracted in Tris-buffered
saline and TPP enzyme activity was measured by following the procedure described in Klutts et al. [32]. The activity was calculated as μmol [Pi]/h/mg hemocyte protein.
Estimation of TPS activity in hemocytes during molt cycle
Hemolymph samples were collected from animals at molt
stages as described [33] and assayed as described above.
Hemocytes homogenized in 200 μl of ice cold PBS by sonication (Branson); the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 10 min at 4°C; and, the supernatants were collected for the estimation of protein concentration as
described above.
