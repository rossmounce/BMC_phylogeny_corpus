Abstract
Background: Often high-quality MS/MS spectra of tryptic peptides do not match to any database entry because of
only partially sequenced genomes and therefore, protein identification requires de novo peptide sequencing. To
achieve protein identification of the economically important but still unsequenced plant pathogenic oomycete
Plasmopara halstedii, we first evaluated the performance of three different de novo peptide sequencing algorithms
applied to a protein digests of standard proteins using a quadrupole TOF (QStar Pulsar i).
Results: The performance order of the algorithms was PEAKS online > PepNovo > CompNovo. In summary, PEAKS
online correctly predicted 45% of measured peptides for a protein test data set.
All three de novo peptide sequencing algorithms were used to identify MS/MS spectra of tryptic peptides of an unknown
57 kDa protein of P. halstedii. We found ten de novo sequenced peptides that showed homology to a Phytophthora
infestans protein, a closely related organism of P. halstedii. Employing a second complementary approach, verification of
peptide prediction and protein identification was performed by creation of degenerate primers for RACE-PCR and led to
an ORF of 1,589 bp for a hypothetical phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that identification of proteins within minute amounts of sample material
improved significantly by combining sensitive LC-MS methods with different de novo peptide sequencing algorithms.
In addition, this is the first study that verified protein prediction from MS data by also employing a second
complementary approach, in which RACE-PCR led to identification of a novel elicitor protein in P. halstedii.

Background
Over the last decade, mass spectrometry has evolved as
an indispensable tool in protein analysis [1,2]. Recent
improvements enable the elucidation of sequence information from limited amounts of protein by usage of MS/
MS which is the most reliable way to identify proteins [3].
However, MS analysis of proteolytic peptides generates
thousands of MS/MS spectra in a single experiment [4].
Matching these spectra to peptides manually would be a
near impossible task. Consequently, computational solutions were generated and today, automated peptide identification is performed by database search algorithms, the
most popular being Sequest [5] and Mascot [6].

Although search algorithms perform an automated
search for peptide identification and allow a highthroughput mode for modern proteomics laboratories,
database searches do not solve all problems. Basic conditions for automated database searches are an accurately
sequenced genome or highly homologue genomes as well
as annotation of all protein coding genes or in some cases
EST. Because many alternatively spliced genes exist, the
latter condition is rarely fulfilled. In addition, search algorithms fail to identify some peptides because of limitations in the searches like artificially modified amino
acids, single nucleotide polymorphisms and unknown
post-translational modifications [7]. Hence, many highquality MS/MS spectra of proteolytic peptides do not
match to any database entry.
De novo peptide sequencing overcomes one of the
above mentioned problems as this procedure allows the

reconstruction of the original peptide from the MS spectrum without knowledge of the genome sequence or even
of the organism from which the peptides are derived. The
aim of de novo sequencing is to obtain the correct amino
acid sequence of the peptide irrespective of the nucleic
acid sequence from the MS/MS spectrum.
Since manual de novo sequencing of peptides is timeconsuming many de novo sequencing algorithms have
been developed to perform computational identifications
automatically. Most algorithms employ a graph-theoretical approach by representing the spectrum with a "spectrum graph" [8]. Popular examples for this approach are
Lutefisk [9,10] and PepNovo [11]. Different approaches
are used by PEAKS online [12,13], NovoHMM [14],
PILOT [15] and CompNovo [16]. For further information, a review of several common de novo algorithms is
given elsewhere [17,18].
Although all articles presenting a new de novo sequencing algorithm implement a performance comparison of
different algorithms, to our knowledge, only two studies
exist from independent laboratories which have systematically evaluated multiple algorithms [19,20]. None of
these studies included de novo algorithms supplied by
OpenMS [21,22] which could potentially have widespread use due to their association with many other proteomics tools like database searching and false discovery
rate estimation.
In addition to different de novo sequencing algorithm
approaches, many user-defined parameters on the MS
instrument influence their outcome. For example, the
deduction of amino acid sequences from MS/MS spectra
is dependent on the quality of spectra data, since incomplete ion series of peptides lead to low-quality MS/MS
data. The typical high noise level of MS/MS measurements in high-throughput experiments limits the performance of de novo sequencing tools and strongly favours
probabilistic models for the data analysis [23,24]. Also,
mass accuracy of the mass spectrometer used for generation of MS/MS fragments is an important factor for differentiation between amino acids with little mass
difference [25].
Another pitfall in de novo sequencing is the identification of the protein to which these sequences belong. Conventional BLAST searches fail in most cases because
these engines are optimized to identify similarities
between fairly long protein sequences and do not cope
well with short sequences and isobaric amino acids of
same masses (e.g. I/L and Q/K). Thus, those sequences
are normally applied for error-tolerant sequence-similarity searches by engines like MS driven BLAST (MS Blast)
[26], FASTS [27], OpenSea [28,29] or SPIDER [30].
These approaches have been successfully applied to
varies proteomic studies of different organisms including
green algae [31], yeast [26], monkey [32] and human [28].

To our knowledge, the oomycete Plasmopara halstedii,
an economically important pathogen causing downy mildew in sunflower, was not studied in-depth and there is
currently only limited knowledge regarding proteins from
this unsequenced pathogen that are involved as signals in
the host resistance. This is mostly due to the limitations
arising from the biotrophic nature of the parasite, which
prohibits cultivation apart from in the living host, and
consequently, only minute amounts of material can be
obtained for experimental investigation.
Here, we present a study divided in two parts. In the
first part we evaluated the performance of three different
de novo algorithms: CompNovo, PEAKS online, and PepNovo using a quadrupole TOF (QTOF). In the second
part we applied this de novo sequencing workflow to
identify an unknown putative elicitor protein of Plasmopara halstedii by database searching and sequence-similarity searches. This protein identification was afterwards
verified by RACE-PCR.

Results
Performance evaluation of CompNovo, PepNovo and Peaks
online utilizing a protein standard

An initial literature review was performed in order to
assess existing performance comparisons of de novo
sequencing algorithms. The result of this search is summarized in additional file 1 table S1. While PEAKS online
seems to be superior for QTOF data, PepNovo leads the
field for de novo sequencing with IT data. The newly
developed PILOT algorithm claims to be superior for
data acquired by both types of analyzers but was still not
publicly available at the time of writing. In our study, we
concentrated on two of the previously known best algorithms for QTOF data: PEAKS online and PepNovo. We
evaluated their performance in comparison to CompNovo, a new de novo sequencing algorithm developed for
CID and ETD spectra.
Tryptic digests of a protein test set (alcohol dehydrogenase 1, cytochrome C, glycogen phosphorylase b, enolase
1, BSA, haemoglobin subunit a and subunit b, L-lactate
dehydrogenase, alpha casein 1 and 2) were measured by
QSTAR, and acquired MS/MS spectra were analysed by
Mascot database searching. By applying a false-discovery
rate of 1%, a total of 78 peptides were identified consisting of one singly, 62 doubly and 15 triply charged peptides. The same data was processed with de novo
sequencing algorithms. The top-ranked sequence
reported from each program was extracted and compared to Mascot results (additional file 1 table S4). The
raw data of the protein test set were converted to the
mascot generic file (mgf-format). All processed data are
included in additional file 2.
Different evaluation measures for performance comparison were used. First, the overall peptide prediction

accuracy was considered. In terms of prediction accuracy
for correct sequence annotation (peptide length of minimum ten amino acids), PEAKS online outperforms all
other programs with an identification rate of 45% followed by PepNovo (18%), and CompNovo (14%) for
QSTAR data (table 1). The corresponding de novo
sequences are summarised for each algorithm (additional
file 1 table S4).
Second, it was considered that most de novo sequencing algorithms incorrectly assign isobaric residues (additional file 1 table S3) that could not be differentiated by
the QSTAR. Thus, up to three incorrect amino acid
assignments were allowed, and this resulted in an
improvement of prediction accuracy for all algorithms:
PEAKS online (67%) > PepNovo (54%) > CompNovo
(41%) (fig. 1).
Finally, the average rate of correct amino acid prediction per peptide was calculated for each algorithm by
dividing the correctly predicted amino acids for all peptides through total predicted amino acids. PEAKS online
was superior with an average rate of 71% of correctly predicted amino acids per peptide followed by PepNovo
(59%), and CompNovo (54%) (additional file 1 table S5).
Identification and de novo sequencing of an elicitor protein
of P. halstedii

The putative elicitor protein, which induced ethylene
release within minutes, was isolated using ammonium
sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography,
SDS-PAGE and gel extraction (fig. 2A). Bioassay-guided
fractionation of cellular extracts from sporangia of P. halstedii led to the isolation of a 57 kDa polypeptide, which
showed elicitor activity in sunflower H. annuus, the host
plant of this biotrophic oomycete (fig. 2b). Tryptic peptides from the 1D-SDS-PAGE protein band with elicitor
activity (fig. 2A, lane 3 (57 kDa)) were measured on
QSTAR to obtain a fragmentation pattern. The raw data
of the P. halstedii sample was converted to the mascot
generic file (mgf-format) and was included in additional
file 2.

Figure 1 Prediction accuracy of QSTAR data. Number of correct
peptides in percent with up to three false amino acid assignments allowed and no identification are shown.

Automatic Mascot database searching of these MS data
using SwissProt database (version of 2009-03-19) resulted
in five proteins. Four of these five proteins were only
identified by a single peptide, a so-called "one-hit wonder". A fifth protein was identified only by two peptides
(additional file 1 table S6).
When checking relationship in a phylogenic tree for a
house-keeping enzyme like cytochrome oxydase II
between P. halstedii and other organisms (additional file 1
fig. S6) it was shown that cytochrome oxydase II is more
related to a human homolog than any bacterial protein.
However, in our database search of the P. halstedii MS
data we identified only bacterial proteins.
We employed a de novo peptide sequencing approach
as described before, because (i) "one-hit wonders" are not
reliable at all, (ii) identification of a protein with only two
peptides is still inadequately verified for solid scientific
research, and (iii) all automatically identified proteins are
from bacteria which have little relationship to the oomycete P. halstedii according to the phylogenetic tree.

As previously suggested [32,33], a high threshold of 90
as confidence score for de novo sequences using PEAKS
online was set. Using this confidence score for PEAKS
online and after removing contaminations such as spectra
from autolytic trypsin peptides (4 peptides), six peptide
candidates were identified. For PepNovo, we also set the
threshold to 90 that resulted in 17 peptide candidates. 13
of these 17 peptides are additional peptides, which were
not ranked with a threshold above 90 by PEAKS online.
This resulted in a total of 19 candidate peptides, of which
six peptides could not be verified manually and were discarded. Of these remaining 13 peptide candidates four
candidates showed identical masses and similar de novo
sequence (m/z 535.7 and 535.2; 638.8 and 638.3). Of these
four candidates with similar mass and sequences, we discarded the candidates with lower confidence scores and
only kept the higher scored de novo sequences. One peptide candidate showed the same de novo sequence as
another candidate with the only difference in having a
missed cleavage site. We did not include this candidate
(m/z 489.7) in our list, but used it for verification of the
protein sequence. The remaining ten peptide candidates
(m/z 425.7, 494.7, 517.7, 535.7, 542.7, 554.7, 575.2, 638.2,
654.8 and 682.3) are shown in figs. Four and additional
file 1 fig. S8, as well as in table 2.
Applying all de novo sequenced peptides from the different algorithms to a similarity-sequence search using
BLAST and MS BLAST did again only result in similarity

of low scored peptide hits of bacteria (additional file 1
figs. S8 and S9).
Degenerate oligonucleotides were constructed from
candidate peptides in order to identify the genomic
sequence encoding for the 57 kDa polypeptide. PCR with
the primer pair F1 + R1 using genomic DNA led to an
amplicon approximately 700 bp in length. The PCR product was identified by direct sequencing using the primer
pair F2 + R2 (fig. 3; internal amplicon). The 3'-terminus
and 5'-terminus were elucidated by RACE-PCR, using
RNA from sporangia as a template for full-length cDNAsynthesis.
Sequence comparison of the two RACE-PCR amplicons with the internal amplicon showed 100% identity in
the overlapping parts. In addition to this, the 3'-RACEPCR amplicon contained a poly-A motif at the 3'-terminus. The alignment of the three amplicons resulted in an
ORF of 1589 base pairs (fig. 4). The translated ORF
showed 56% identity to a putative phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PISP34) of Phytophthora infestans, a
closely related organism of P. halstedii (fig. 3).
Successful DNA sequencing of the complete ORF of the
elicitor protein enabled us to verify additional de novo
sequenced peptides which were below our chosen threshold of 90 and which would further confirm the identified
protein. Therefore, we applied a confidence score of 80
for PEAKS online and PepNovo and compared these de
novo sequenced peptides with the amino acid sequence of

the translated ORF. This led to two additional peptides
being predicted by PEAKS online and 16 more peptides
by PepNovo. After combining both predictions and discarding all peptide candidates which could not be verified
manually the total number of completely new peptide
candidates was seven. We discarded candidates, which
annotated for the same peptide mass and sequence and
resulted in a total of five new candidates (m/z 495.4,
574.2, 575.3, 655.3, and 675.8) (see additional file 1 table
S7, dark grey marked). Four of these five additional peptides showed at least 75% homology to the translated
ORF of P. halstedii (m/z 574.5 showed only 50% homology).
To summarize our results, all predicted peptides
showed high homology to the elicitor protein, and four
peptides showed complete identity (fig. 3; tabs. 2 and
additional file 1 table S7). With the exception of peptides
m/z 574.2 and 517.7 all peptides fitted perfectly in the
cleavage pattern of trypsin. An arginine or lysine is positioned at the N-terminus before each peptide candidate
and every peptide candidate ends with a lysine or arginine, which decreases the possibility of a false sequence
annotation and therefore, strengthens the probability of a
true tryptic peptide (fig. 3). Exactly the same sequence of
m/z 517.7 was also annotated in m/z 575.2 that in this
peptide perfectly fits into the cleavage pattern of trypsin.
In conclusion, using a combination of PEAKS online,
PepNovo and CompNovo led to successful identification
of ten different de novo sequenced peptides. All predicted
peptides were verified by RACE-PCR.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to identify an elicitor
protein of the unsequenced pathogenic taxon P. halstedii

where automatic database searches of MS/MS spectra
would otherwise fail. To reach this goal, the performance
of three de novo sequencing algorithms (PepNovo,
PEAKS online, and CompNovo) was evaluated. While
PEAKS online was reported to be superior in evaluation
of QTOF spectra [19] and PepNovo in LIT spectra
[19,20], CompNovo had been thoroughly tested in ETD/
CID spectra [16].
Three criteria were selected for evaluation of performance quality of de novo sequencing algorithms: (i) exact
prediction accuracy, (ii) prediction accuracy with a maximum tolerance of up to three incorrect amino acid
assignments, and (iii) average rate of correctly predicted
amino acids per peptide.
Concerning all criteria, PEAKS online outperformed
the other algorithms in each category. Performance order
was PEAKS online > PepNovo > CompNovo (fig. 1, table
1).
During the performance evaluation of the protein test
data set it was noted that CompNovo only succeeded in
33% (5/15) to predict triply charged ions with 12% of correctly identified amino acids. This value seems to be
much lower than the reported 33.5% of correctly identified amino acids of 134 triply charged ions CID/ETD
spectra [16] which could be due to the lower number of
15 deployed triply charged ions spectra in our study. In
the same study it was shown that PepNovo performed
inferior for triply charged ions with an identification rate
of 19.5%. However, we showed that PepNovo performed
much better with our test data set (49% of correctly identified amino acids in triply charged ions) and that Peaks
online performed superior to both algorithms by correctly identifying 57% amino acids in triply charged ions.

Figure 4 Scheme of PCR experiments. The alignment shows the three amplicons, which led to the ORF and untranslated regions (UTRs) of the 57
kDa protein of P. halstedii. The internal amplicon was revealed with the primer pairs F1+R1 and F2 + R2 (nested PCR). The 3'-RACE-PCR amplicon was
revealed with the gene-specific primer PhE-F1 and PhE-F2 (semi-nested PCR). The 5'-RACE-PCR amplicon was revealed with the gene-specific primer
PhE-R1, PhE-R2 (semi-nested PCR) and PhE-R3 (semi-nested PCR). In all RACE experiments the provided adaptor primer of the SMART™ RACE cDNA
amplification kit was used.

We also noted that the scoring system for CompNovo
predictions is unreliable since most of the correctly predicted sequences do have very low scores with CompNovo in comparison to Peaks Online and PepNovo
(additional file 1 table S4).
Our study showed that all tested de novo algorithms
failed to reach a 50% threshold of exact peptide sequence
identification (fig. 1) which is in line with other published
reports [19]. Recently, employment of PepNovo and
NovoHMM with stringent filtering criteria succeeded in
high-throughput de novo sequencing of peptides of spinach chloroplast, bell pepper chromoplast and Cassave
leave and root proteome [34].
A completely different solution for de novo sequencing
is introduced by the two-stage algorithm PILOT [15],
which integrates an integer linear optimisation approach.
PILOT has been shown to generate superior prediction
accuracy for QTOF data (72%) [15]. Unfortunately, the
algorithm was not publicly available at the time of this
study.
Based on this performance evaluation we analysed
tryptic peptides of an unknown 57 kDa protein of P. halstedii. Resulting MS/MS spectra were de novo sequenced
by all three de novo sequencing algorithms. PEAKS
online reported eight peptides and PepNovo reported 18
peptides with a high probability score (>80). Combining
predictions of both algorithms, a total number of ten
unique peptides with high probabilities were identified.
Database searches by BLAST and sequence-similarity
searches with MS BLAST did result in low scored hits of
bacterial peptides (additional file 1 figs. S8 and S9). Verification of peptide prediction and protein identification
by degenerate primers for RACE-PCR led to an ORF of

1,589 bp. The translated ORF showed 56% identity to a
hypothetical
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase
(PISP34) of P. infestans.
Here, we have shown that the de novo sequencing algorithms PEAKS online, PepNovo, and CompNovo result in
high prediction accuracy, in this study for Applied Biosystems QTOF data. The combination of all three algorithms improved confidence in the reliability of predicted
sequences and increased the total number of predicted
peptides as PepNovo and Peaks online ranked different
peptides with highest scores. Therefore, using the combined de novo peptide sequencing algorithm workflow
presented in this study would result in a reduced number
of false-positives for high-throughput de novo sequencing
experiments. In general, PEAKS online amino acid
sequence prediction was more accurate (83%) than PepNovo (79%) and CompNovo (56%) prediction for the P.
halstedii protein. For example, sequence accuracy of PepNovo for m/z 655.3 was 67% with a confidence score of 88
whereas PEAKS online marked the same peptide with a
low confidence score of 24 but resulted in higher
sequence prediction accuracy (75%). Therefore, we suggest using PEAKS online for prediction of amino acid
sequence, using PepNovo as a filter unit of confidence
score, and CompNovo for verification of amino acid
sequence. That would result in a list of predicted peptides
with a high confidence score generated by PEAKS online.
The list can then be expanded by additional peptides,

80 in PepNovo. For these additional peptides, the user
should utilize the sequences of PEAKS online instead of

Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that identification of proteins
within minute amounts of sample material improved significantly by combining sensitive LC-MS methods with
de novo peptide sequencing. In addition, this is the first
study that verified protein prediction from MS data by
also employing a second complementary approach, in
which RACE-PCR led to identification of a novel elicitor
protein in P. halstedii. This workflow is likely to be of
great economical interest for further identification of
plant elicitors, and very useful for studies with low sample
amount where Edman sequencing, with its demand for
higher quantities, would fail. It also offers an alternative
for organisms where error-tolerant database searches and
sequence-similarity searches fail to succeed because of
low homology to closely related organisms.
Methods
Material

The protein test sets were purchased from different companies. Tryptic digests of serum albumin (bovine) and
cytochrome c (horse) were purchased from Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). A mixture (MassPrep digestion standard 1) containing tryptic digests of alcohol
dehydrogenase 1 (yeast), glycogen phosphorylase b (rabbit), enolase 1 (yeast) and BSA (bovine) were purchased
from Waters (Eschborn, Germany). Haemoglobin subunit
a and subunit b (bovine), L-lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit), alpha casein 1 and 2 (bovine) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Protein amount is
specified in the additional file 1 table S2. ACN, TFA, and
formic acid (FA) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and all other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

LC/MS analysis

Peptides from tryptic protein digests were separated on a
Dionex Ultimate nanoLC-System (Idstein, Germany)
coupled to a QTOF MS (QStar Pulsar i, Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). In the following, the QStar
Pulsar i MS is defined as QSTAR. LC separation prior to
QSTAR acquisition was performed as described before
[35].
Protein identification from MS data

Protein identification was performed using OpenMS
(version 1.6) in combination with the Mascot database
algorithm (version 2.2; MatrixScience, London) [6].
The protein test sets were identified using a sequence
database including all 9,320 protein sequences from S.
cellulosum of Uni-ProtKB/Swiss-Prot release 15.4/57.4,
86 protein sequences of trypsin and keratin and the protein test set sequences (BSA (bovine); cytochrome c
(horse); alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (yeast); glycogen phosphorylase b (rabbit); enolase 1 (yeast); haemoglobin subunit a and subunit b (bovine); L-lactate dehydrogenase
(rabbit); alpha casein 1 and 2 (bovine)). In addition, the
database contained reversed sequences of all proteins
appended to the original S. cellulosum database including
the contamination proteins and the protein test set
sequences to allow a maximum false discovery rate (FDR)
of 1%. The P. halstedii data was processed using a SwissProt database (version of 2008-12-09).
In both cases, the following parameters were chosen for
database search: cysteine carbamidomethylation was
included as fixed modification and methionine oxidation
was included as variable modification and up to one
missed cleavage was allowed during the search runs. The
peptide tolerance and MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.3 Da
(see additional file 1).

In solution digest

The protein sample was dissolved in denaturation buffer
(6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES buffer) at a
final concentration of 1-2 μg protein/μl. 1 M dithiothreitol in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the
sample to a final concentration of 1 mM DTT and incubated for one hour at room temperature. Afterwards,
alkylation buffer (550 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate) was added to the sample to a
final concentration of 5.5 mM iodoacetamide and incubated for one hour at room temperature in the dark. 1 μg
of lysyl endopeptidase LysC (Waco, Japan) per 100 μg
protein was added and followed by an incubation for 3
hours at room temperature. The sample was diluted with
4 sample volumes of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate.
One μg trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) per 100
μg sample protein was added, and samples were incubated overnight at room temperature. Digested proteins
were stored at -20°C.

De novo sequencing of peptides

For all de novo algorithms, methionine oxidation was
selected as variable modification and carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification. QSTAR data were
de novo sequenced using peptide tolerance and MS/MS
tolerance of 0.3 Da. A maximum of one missed-cleavage
was allowed. All data were searched for tryptic peptides
(see additional file 1 information).
Evaluation of de novo sequences

The predicted and correctly identified sequences are
compared from the left to the right and an amino acid of
the predicted peptide sequence is counted as correct if
the corresponding amino acid in the correctly identified
sequence is identical. For evaluation purposes, only peptides with a minimum of three consecutive correctly
identified amino acids were taken into account for determining subsequence length. Due to low mass accuracy
the mass spectrometer used in this study is not suitable to

Jung et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:24
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/24

differentiate between amino acids with isobaric masses
(K/Q, I/L, and F/oxidized M). In such cases, identification
of an isobaric amino acid was regarded as a correct prediction. However, if detected masses can either correspond to one large amino acid or two smaller ones that
together have the same mass (e.g. W/EG), this was
regarded as an incorrect prediction.
Prediction accuracy is defined as the number of peptides with correct amino acid prediction divided through
the number of total identified peptides.
Plant material/P. halstedii material

The sunflower Helianthus annuus cv. Giganteus (Ernst
Benary Samenzucht, Hann. Muenden, Germany), which
is highly susceptible to all known P. halstedii strains, was
used as plant substrate. Plants were cultivated in heatsterilized soil at 16°C, 80% relative humidity and 14 h
light/day prior to and post inoculation with the pathogen.
P. halstedii was maintained on sunflower seedlings using
the whole seedling inoculation technique [36] under cultivation conditions described earlier [37]. Fresh sporangia
were washed from cotyledons of infected plants with
deionised water and were then used for infection, subsequent DNA and protein extraction.
Protein isolation from sporangia

5 mg of sporangia were homogenized in a mixer mill
(Retsch, Haan, Germany) and suspended in 25 mM Tris/
HCl (pH8). After removing insoluble material, proteins
were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation (80%
(v/w)) followed by desalting using ultrafiltration spin columns (Vivaspin 500, 10,000 MWCO, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). After desalting, 25 μl aliquot were
withdrawn from the sporangia protein solution and
diluted with 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH8). Ion-exchange chromatography was performed using a spin column system
equipped with strong basic anion exchanger (VivaPure
IEX Mini H; functional group: Quaternary ammonium;
buffer. 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH8); Sartorius, Goettingen,
Germany), according to manual.
Sporangia proteins were separated on 13% acrylamide
slab gels in the discontinuous Tris-glycine system
described by Laemmli [29]. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were mixed with a loading dye (Roti-Load 1, Carl
Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) (4:1 v/v) and briefly heated at
90°C. PAGE in Tris-glycine buffer (pH8.6) containing
0.1% SDS was carried out at 25 mA and gels were stained
(0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, 7% acetic acid and
30% methanol). A protein standard (PageRuler™ Plus
Prestained Protein Ladder, MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot,
Germany) was used for estimating sporangia protein
molecular weights. In-gel digestion of target protein was
performed as described earlier [38].

Elicitor induced ethylene production in sunflower

Leaf-disks of three-week-old plants were infiltrated
through the abaxial surface with probe solutions. As controls, leaf-disks were similarly treated with water. Infiltrated leaf-disks were transferred into gas-proof glass
vials equipped with a septum and further incubated at
room temperature for 3 h in the dark. 400 μl from the
headspace were taken out with a gas-proofed syringe.
The plant stress hormone ethylene was detected using
gas chromatography (GC321, HNU Systems. Inc., Newton, Mass., USA, equipped with steel column (packing
material: Porapak® 80-100 m) and photoionisation detector).
Evaluation of internal DNA sequences of total nucleic acid
from sporangia

For the isolation of total DNA, 5 mg of sporangia was suspended in 800 μL lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris,
20 mM EDTA, pH7.5) and dispersed using an Ultra-Turrax T-8 instrument (IKA-Labortechnik, Stauffen, Germany). DNA was extracted using the GenElute plant mini
kit (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany), according to
manual. RNA was extracted using a plant Aurum total
RNA mini kit (Biorad, Munich, Germany), following the
manufacturer's instructions.
To identify internal DNA sequences encoding for the
57 kDa polypeptide the following primers were designed:
Forward primer F1 (5'-TN GGN CTN GAR AAR TTY
MGN AT-3') targeted the LGLEKFRI motif. Forward
primer F2 (5'-TTY MGN ATH GAY AAY GCN AAR AC3') targeted the FRIDNAKT motif. Reverse primer R1 (5'YTT NCC NGT NCC NGW NAR NCC-3') targeted the
GLSGTGK motif. Reverse primer R2 (5'-CCR AAR AAN
ARN GCN GTR TCN CC-3') targeted the DGDTALFFG
motif. Primer pair F1 and R1 was expected to give a PCR
product approximately 700 bp in length. Primer pair F2 +
R2 was used as nested primer and primer for direct
sequencing.
PCR-amplifications were performed with 100 ng of
genomic DNA in 25 μL reactions. Each reaction contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.8), 50 mM KCl, 5 pmol of
each dNTP, 1.25 mM MgCl2, and 1U Taq polymerase
(MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). PCR (35
cycles) was carried out in a thermocycler (Eppendorf,
Hamburg) under the following conditions: 30s denaturation at 94°C, 60s annealing at 50°C, and 50s strand synthesis at 72°C. Initial denaturation was conducted at 94°C
for 5 min and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. Amplification products were resolved by gel electrophoresis
using a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
and photographed under UV illumination.

RACE-PCR

The 3'- and 5'-end of the gene was elucidated by RACEPCR using the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit
(Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), according to manual.
Five oligonucleotide primers targeted to the revealed
internal nucleic acid sequence and the kit-included adaptor were used for amplification and sequencing. Forward
primer PhE-F1 (5'-GACGTGGCTGTTATTGGTGGTAC-3') and PhE-F2 (5'-GGTGGTACATGGTATGGAGGAG-3') were used as gene-specific primer in the 3'RACE-PCR. Primer pair PhE-F1 + adaptor were used to
produce the first amplicons followed by a semi-nested
PCR with the primer pair PhE-F2 + adaptor. Reverse
Primer PhE-R1 (5'-GTACCACCAATAACAGCCACGTC-3'), PhE-R2 (5'-CGAACGGCCCGTAAATTTGCCAGT-3') and PhE-R3 (5'-CGTGAGCAGCAATTT
CATCGTAGC-3') were used as gene-specific primer in
the 5'-RACE-PCR. Primer pair PhE-R1 + adaptor were
used to produce the first amplicons followed by two
rounds of semi-nested PCR with the primer pair PhE-F2
+ adaptor and PhE-F3 + adaptor.
All oligonucleotide primers were designed using the
FastPCR software version 5.2.2 (available at http://
www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/bi/programs/fastpcr.htm).
