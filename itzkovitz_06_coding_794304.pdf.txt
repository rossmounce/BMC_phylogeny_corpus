Abstract
Background: Transcription factor proteins bind specific DNA sequences to control the
expression of genes. They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several super-families,
each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number of transcription factors encoded
in a genome increases with the number of genes in the genome. Here, we examined the number
of transcription factors from each super-family in diverse organisms.
Results: We find that the number of transcription factors from most super-families appears to be
bounded. For example, the number of winged helix factors does not generally exceed 300, even in
very large genomes. The magnitude of the maximal number of transcription factors from each
super-family seems to correlate with the number of DNA bases effectively recognized by the
binding mechanism of that super-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the
number of transcription factors should exist, in order to minimize cross-binding errors between
transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with similar binding sequences
should tend to have similar biological effect, so that errors based on mis-recognition are minimal.
We present evidence that transcription factors with similar binding sequences tend to regulate
genes with similar biological functions, supporting this prediction.
Conclusion: The present study suggests limits on the transcription factor repertoire of cells, and
suggests coding constraints that might apply more generally to the mapping between binding sites
and biological function.

Background
Transcription factor proteins regulate genes by binding
DNA sequences at the promoters of the target genes. Typically, each transcription factor (TF) is able to recognize a
set of similar sequences, centred around a consensus
sequence [1-11]. The binding probability is generally
believed to be higher the more similar a sequence is to the
consensus sequence.

Transcription factor proteins can be classified into superfamilies, each with a different DNA-binding mechanism
[12-16]. For example, the winged helix super-family consists of proteins which insert an alpha helix into the major
groove of the DNA, forming amino-acid-base contacts
over a region spanning about 5–6 base-pairs. These proteins tend to form homo-dimers, which often contact two
consecutive major grooves [13]. Thus, their binding
sequences are palindromic repeats of a 5–6 base-pair
sequence. Proteins from the homeodomain-like super-

family insert an alpha helix parallel to the DNA backbone,
and tend to form heterodimers, thus forming more basepair contacts than the winged helix proteins. Other superfamilies like the C2H2 zinc-coordinating super-family are
monomer proteins with variable number of DNA recognition domains, or 'fingers', each recognizing 3 consecutive
base-pairs [17,18].
The total number of transcription factors (TFs) encoded
by a genome increases with the number of genes in the
genome [19]. The number of TFs has been shown to scale
with genome size as a power-law (the number of TFs, N,
scales as the number of genes G as N~G1.9 for Prokaryotes
and N~G1.3 for Eukaryotes [20]). This is thought to reflect
the fact that the more complex the organism, the more
intricate the regulation needed to respond to environmental inputs and to carry out developmental programs.
Here we ask whether there are limits on the numbers of
transcription factors from different super-families. We
find that the maximal numbers of transcription factors
from most super-families is significantly smaller than the
total number of transcription factors. The maximal
number for each super-family appears to correlate with
the number of possible sequences effectively recognized
by the binding mechanism of that super-family. We also
show that the binding sequences of different TFs from the
same super-family are often highly similar, and that TFs
with similar binding sequences tend to participate in similar biological processes. The results are compared to simple coding models that may provide an intuitive
understanding of the origin and magnitude of the bounds
on TF numbers.

Results
Maximal number of transcription factors in most superfamilies is bounded
The total number of TFs increases with the number of
genes in the genome [20], exceeding 2700 TFs in organisms such as Xenopus tropicalis. However, when considering each TF super-family separately, we find that the
number of TFs from most super-families reach a maximum size which is significantly lower than the total
number of TFs (in other words, the size of the super-family is bounded). For example, winged helix transcription
factors increase with number of genes until reaching a
maximum of about 300 TFs in organisms with ~5000
genes (Table 1). Larger genomes contain winged helix TFs
but at numbers which do not appear to exceed this bound.

A similar picture is observed in other super-families
(Table 1), for example, the maximal number of lambdarepressor-like TFs is about 80 and the maximal number of
helix-loop-helix proteins is about 185. In one super-family – the multi-domain C2H2 zinc finger super-family, the
maximal number of TFs is significantly higher than in
other super-families. These proteins, found mainly in
eukaryotes, increase in number with genome size, following genome size as about the number of genes squared
(Ga with a = 1.8+/- 0.17).
The maximal number of TFs correlates with number of
degrees of freedom in the binding mechanism
In this section we compare the magnitude of the maximal
TF numbers with the number of degrees of freedom in the
binding mechanism of each super-family. The results are
summarized in Fig 1 and Table 1.

The number of degrees of freedom of a binding mechanism is related to the number of different base-pairs that
can be specifically recognized by the DNA-binding mechTable 1: Maximal numbers of transcription factors from each super-family in a single organism, and the organism in which the

anism. For example, lambda-repressor-like proteins recognize DNA by inserting a short alpha helix into the
major groove, specifically recognizing only three basepairs [21,22]. These three base-pairs essentially determine
the binding sequence of the TF, because these proteins
usually form homo-dimers in which each monomer recognizes the same sequence [13]. Thus the proteins from
this super-family have a relatively constrained binding
mechanism, with 64 possible binding sequences (since
there are 43/2 combinations of three bps, including
reverse complement sequences, and there are two possible
orientations of the half sites, see methods). The maximal
number observed for proteins in this super-family is
about 80 per genome (Table 1).
Winged helix (wH) transcription factors recognize DNA
using a similar mechanism of inserting an alpha helix into
the major groove. However, the longer alpha helix used by
these TFs usually interacts with 6 bp positions instead of
3 bp. Just as in lambda-repressor like TFs, these 6 basepairs determine the binding sequence, because wH pro-

teins usually form homo-dimers [13]. There does not
appear to be any constraint on the possible 6 base pair
sequences that can be recognized by a suitably designed
wH protein. Hence, the maximal number of different
sequences that can be recognized by such factors can be
estimated as 46/2 = 2048, more than the number of
sequences available for lambda-repressor like TFs. The
observed maximal number for this super-family, about
300 (Table 1, Fig 1) is higher than the maximal number
for the lambda-repressor like super-family.
Three other super-families have related mechanisms:
helix-loop-helix proteins, Zn2/Cys6 proteins and glucocorticoid receptor-like proteins (Table 1). These three
super-families bind as dimers, in which each monomer
binds a highly constrained sequence (half-site). Helixloop-helix proteins usually recognize one of only a few
conserved major-groove hexamer sequences, such as the
E-box or G-box [23-25]. In these sequences, only two
positions are variable. These proteins can form homodimers or hetero-dimers. This is the most constrained of

the three super-families (~130 possible sequences), and
has the lowest observed maximal number, about 185.
Zn2/Cys6 proteins bind to three bp identical half-sites.
They have more possible binding sequences than helixloop-helix proteins, because the half-sites can be at variable spacing and orientations (estimated at ~1250 possible
sequences). The maximal number for this super-family is
higher, about 250 (table 1, Fig 1). Glucocorticoid receptor-like proteins bind two half sites which can be at variable orientations and spacing [21] and in addition can
form hetero-dimers that bind to non-identical half-sites.
This super-family therefore has the most degrees of freedom of the three super-families (~3450 possible
sequences), and displays the highest maximal number,
about 380.
C2H2 proteins have between two to more than 30 finger
domains, each recognizing three consecutive base-pairs
[18,26]. These proteins have the largest number of possible binding sequences (64n/2 for an n-domain protein).
The maximal number of such proteins in a single organism is the highest of all super-families, consistent with the
large number of degrees of freedom for the possible binding sites.
Table 1 and Fig 1 show the maximal numbers for all
super-families, as well as an estimate for the number of
possible sequences where data on the mechanism is available. The maximal number seems to increase with the
number of possible binding sequences.
Evolutionary shift to super-families with more degrees of
freedom
When examining the distribution of transcription factors
among the different super-families for different organisms
(Fig 2) one can observe a shift from the predominant use
of super-families with less degrees of freedom and smaller
maximal number of TFs to super-families with more
degrees of freedom and higher maximal number of TFs.
Organisms with a small number of genes predominantly
use TF super-families such as Lambda-repressor like and
C-terminal effectors, while as organisms with more genes
shift to Zn2/Cys6 and Glucocorticoid receptor-like superfamilies, which have higher maximal numbers of TFs.
Organisms with more genes, such as mouse and human,
shift to the predominant use of C2H2 multi-domain zinc
finger TFs, which have the highest maximal number.
Coding theory suggests upper bounds for transcription
factor numbers
What is the origin of the bounds on the numbers of transcription factors? As one possible explanation, we consider the mapping of transcription factors to binding
sequences as a coding problem, analogous to the assignment of amino acids to codons in the genetic code. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/239

would like to emphasize that the purpose of models in
this study is not to serve as descriptions of precise biochemical mechanisms, but rather as simple conceptual
guides to understand the forces at play. Thus, the models
neglect such details as whether each residue in the binding
domain of the TF recognizes one or more DNA bases, as
well as issues of DNA malleability, non-specific aminoacid base contacts, etc. The models also neglect important
effects such as cooperative binding between TFs and other
regulatory features.
To begin with, consider a hypothetical situation in which
each sequence is assigned a different TF. In the case of
winged helix TFs, for example, in which a binding
sequence is effectively of length 6, there are in principle
46/2 = 2048 different sequences (or 2080 if one considers
separately the 64 self-complementary sequences in addition to (46-64)/2 unique non-self complementary
sequences). There are therefore a maximal number of
2048 TFs that are perfectly stringent and recognize only
one sequence. In reality, however, each TF recognizes a set
of sequences, located around a consensus sequence [111]. Thus, the assignment of TFs to sequences should
assign to each TF a set of adjacent sequences. This raises a
difficulty, because TFs with very similar sets of binding
sequences can recognize each others binding sequences.
In the theoretical case of perfectly non-overlapping
sequences, in which each sequence is assigned to only one
TF, Sengupta et al [6] have noted that the coding problem
is similar to the problem of packing non-overlapping
spheres in the space of sequences, each sphere corresponding to the sequences belonging to one TF (Fig 3a).
Let us make a simple estimate of the number of TFs
according to this picture. As an example, suppose that a TF
can on average recognize sequences that are one letter different from the consensus (Hamming distance of one
away from the consensus sequence). For winged helix proteins, there are six positions in the sequence, each of
which can be changed to one of 3 other letters, resulting
in 6 × 3 = 18 neighbours that are a Hamming distance of
one away. Thus, there can be at most 2048/19~100 distinct TFs with non-overlapping sequences [27]. This is on
the same order of magnitude, although lower than the
observed maximal number of about 300 (Table 1).
Coding theory suggests that one can increase the number
of TFs by allowing sequences to overlap. This comes at a
cost: TFs can mis-recognize each other's sequences leading
to errors in gene expression. Optimal codes that can minimize such errors are known as "Gray codes" in information theory [28]. An optimal coding theory, which allows
sequences to overlap, has been recently suggested in the
context of the genetic code [29]. In the genetic code,
codons differing by one base-pair correspond either to the

same amino acid or to chemically related amino acids
[30-32]. This mapping is thought to minimize the error
load caused by errors in translation [29,32].
Here we apply this theory to TFs. Since the theory takes
into account the mis-binding errors, it can reach higher
bounds than hard-sphere packing codes (Table 2). Importantly, the theory predicts that neighbouring "spheres",
that is TFs with similar binding sequences, would tend to
be close in biological function in order to minimize the
error load. Thus, the TFs with overlapping sequences
should regulate the same genes, or genes with similar

functions, so that effects of cross-recognition are minimized. Such codes are called "smooth" (Fig 3b).
Factors with similar binding sequences tend to have similar
biological functions
A qualitative prediction of the smooth coding theory is
that transcription factors with similar recognition
sequences should tend to have similar biological effects.
The reason is that factors with similar sequences can
sometimes bind to each others sequences. If the biological
effects of binding of TF A and B are similar, the reduction
in fitness caused by such errors would be smaller. Hence,
there may be a selection pressure to allocate similar
sequences to biologically similar factors.

The sphere packing bounds are from equation (10). The coloring
bound is given by equation (8).

To test the prediction that TFs with similar sequences
should tend to have similar function, we examined TFs in
E. coli, yeast and human, and compared their sequence
similarity by means of several distance metrics. In these
organisms there exists a significant sequence similarity
between the binding sites of some TF pairs (Fig 4, 5, 6).
The yeast set of 94 well characterized TFs contained 18
pairs with highly similar sequences (Fig 4). The E. coli set
of 46 well characterized TFs contained 6 pairs with highly
similar sequences (Fig 5). The human set of 49 TFs con-

tained 9 pairs with highly similar sequences (Fig 6). In
other words, the TF "spheres" often overlap significantly
(Fig 3B).
To assess the similarity in function of the TFs with similar
binding sequences, we used two measures. The first similarity measure was a significant co-regulation of target
genes by both factors. The second measure was the similarity in functional annotation [33,34] of the target genes
of each TF. For both measures, we observed a significant
enrichment of TF pairs with similar sequences and similar
biological function measures.

We now provide more details on this result. To assess the
functional similarity in yeast, we used an experimentally
determined transcription network [35,36]. This network
contained targets for 64 TFs in our data-set. About 14%
(276/2016) of all TF pairs had significant target co-regulation. When considering pairs with similar binding
sequences, the fraction with significant target co-regulation increases to over 50% (10/18, p-value of 5.1*10-5)
(Fig 4).
As a second measure of functional similarity, we assigned
to each yeast TF a profile according to the functional

annotation of its target genes [33]. We then compared the
average distances between the profiles of TF pairs with
similar binding sequences to the average distances
between the profiles of all TF pairs. We find that TF pairs
with similar binding sequences have a lower average profile distance (0.17 vs 0.35, p-value of 7*10-5). Thus their
targets tend to have more similar biological annotations.
Examples of such pairs are the stress-response regulators
MSN2 and MSN4, the stress-response YAP TFs, the cell
cycle regulators FKH1 and FKH2 and the nitrogen regulators GLN3 and DAL82.
Similar results were obtained for E. coli. In our database of
46 TFs we found 6 pairs of TFs with significantly high
binding sequence similarity (Fig 5). To assess the functional similarity between these pairs, using co-regulation
criterion, we parsed the Ecocyc database [34] to obtain a
network of 541 operons and 806 experimentally verified

transcription interactions. Only 4% (39/1035) of all TF
pairs had significant target co-regulation. When considering TFs with similar binding sequences, this fraction
increases to over 65% (4/6, p-value 2.5*10-5). As a second
test, we used a functional annotation for E. coli. We found
that TF pairs with similar sequences have a lower average
functional profile distance (0.26 vs 0.76, p-value of
4.2*10-5). Thus, the target genes of these TFs tend to have
similar biological annotations. Examples of TF pairs with
similar sites and similar functions include the drug and
stress response regulators MarA, SoxS and Rob that jointly
regulate at least 6 operons, and the anaerobic metabolism
regulators NarL and NarP that jointly regulate 5 operons.
The similarity in sequences is so large that some of these
factors bind the exact same sequence in some of their coregulated genes. However, many of their binding
sequences are also distinct (the TF spheres appear not to
overlap completely).

Transcription factors with significantly overlapping sequences in Humans
Transcription factors with significantly overlapping sequences in Humans. Edges connect two TFs with similar binding
sequences. Sequence logos are shown for each TF.

For human, limited data currently prohibits a detailed statistical analysis. However, several examples are known
where functionally related TFs recognize the same
sequences. These include the interferon regulatory factors
IRF-1 and IRF-2 [37], and the ETS transcription factors
SPI-B and SPI-1 [38].
Many TF pairs with overlapping sequences and similar
function are close paralogs (belong to the same family
within the super-family) [15,39-42]. In most cases there
are additional paralogous TFs with non-similar binding
sequences. For example the E. coli regulators MarA, SoxS
and Rob that recognize similar sequences, are all paralogs
from the AraC/XylS family. However, they differ in their
binding sequences and in their biological function from
their paralog AraC. This suggests that homology of TF proteins does not fully explain the similarity in their binding
sites. Gene duplication may aid in generating paralogous
TFs with similar binding sites, which can then be selected
according to the cost and benefit of their action on the target genes.

genome does not seem to exceed a certain upper bound.
These bounds range from around 80 for lambda repressor-like, to about 420 for homeodomain proteins. The
bounds seem to correlate with the number of degrees of
freedom of the DNA-binding mechanism in each superfamily. The multi-domain C2H2 zinc fingers super-family
displays a significantly higher maximal number in the
present data, compared to other super-families.

Discussion

To understand these bounds, we considered the coding
problem faced by the cell: how to assign different
sequences to each transcription factor in a way that avoids
erroneous recognition in which a transcription factor
binds where it shouldn't. As organisms of increasing complexity evolve there is a need for more diversity in gene
regulation, through the introduction of new transcription
factors. The stochastic process of DNA recognition by TFs
may result in binding of a TF to binding sequences
intended for another TF, if these are similar enough. This
study examined the proposal that minimizing these misrecognitions limits the maximal numbers of TFs with a
given binding mechanism, that is, TFs from a given superfamily.

The main result of this study is that the maximal numbers
of TFs from most transcription factor super-families
appear to be bounded. The number of these TFs in a

considered two theoretical mappings of code-words

(DNA sequences) to messages (TFs): a sphere packing
code in which each TF has unique sequences not shared
with other TFs, and a smooth code in which sequences of
different TFs can partially overlap. The latter appears to
offer a more realistic representation, because many pairs
of TFs have highly similar code-words. For some superfamilies, the observed bounds seem to approximately
agree with the theoretical bound derived for smooth
codes.
A prediction of the theory in which misrecognition errors
are an important constraint on the coding, is that TFs with
similar binding sequences should tend to have similar
biological functions. This is because misrecognition
between such TFs would have a smaller impact on fitness.
This prediction agrees with the present observation that
the TFs with overlapping code-words are significantly
closer in their biological function than expected at random.
One possible scenario for the evolution of TF super-families is as follows. Simple organisms, which require few
TFs, employ certain super-families such as lambda repressor-like and winged helix. When these super-families
reach their upper bounds, new super-families are needed.
At these points organisms shift their TF usage to novel
super-families with more degrees of freedom and higher
maximal numbers (Fig 2). An example is the increased use
of the C2H2 zinc finger TFs in the more advanced organisms.
It is important to note that the usage of different TF superfamilies is linked to the phylogenetic grouping of organisms. An example is the Zn2/Cys6 DNA-binding domain
TFs which are largely restricted to fungal organisms
[14,43]. This hints at an interplay between the suggested
coding limits that create pressure to use different TF superfamilies, and the pyhlogenetic history that might dictate
the specific choice of these TF super-families.
Much of the innovation of biological function has been
attributed to events of gene duplications [44-47]. Several
species, such as zebra-fish and Arabidopsis have undergone whole genome duplications. Such duplication
events may lead to a situation where the number of TFs
from a given super-family exceeds its theoretical bound, as
observed for helix-loop-helix proteins in Arabidopsis.
This could either create an evolutionary pressure which
may lead to eventual loss of redundant TFs or result in a
transient, non-equilibrium census of TFs.
To further test the present conclusions requires additional
biological data. The current sets of TFs with known binding sequences (the transcriptional code) and gene-regulation networks, representing the functional annotation of

the TFs, are still partial. For example, the current dataset
for E. coli includes less than a fifth of all TFs in the organism. Once datasets are enlarged, one may get a better estimate of the bounds, the amounts of overlap in sequence
space, and the functional smoothness of the transcriptional code.
Along the same lines, further knowledge of TF-DNA binding mechanisms could allow one to obtain more accurate
estimates for the number of degrees of freedom of each
super-family in order to more accurately test the correlation of the observed bounds with this number. In the case
of C2H2 zinc fingers, detailed structures of the TF-DNA
complex allowed a good estimation of the mapping
between residues in the TF binding domain and the DNA
bases recognized by the TF [17,18]. In other super-families, however, no clear mapping has yet been devised.
Therefore, the present study presented only crude estimates for the number of possible sequences of each superfamily. The present study predicts that the number of
degrees of freedom in super-families with a lower
observed bound should be smaller than for super-families
with high bounds.
The present study focused only on one level of TF-DNA
interaction, the recognition mechanisms of DNA binding
sequences by transcription factors. There are many additional effects that govern transcription regulation. Gene
expression often depends on the combined effects of multiple TFs, integrated by a cis-regulatory input function at
the promoter [48-55]. The functional role of each TF is
influenced by the distance on the promoter of its binding
sites from sites of other TFs and the transcription start site
[51], as well as the phase of the site along the DNA helix
[56,57]. In addition, there is often co-operative binding to
other factors [58,59], tissue-specific TF expression [19]
and differential exclusion of TFs from the nucleus that is
dependent on cell type and conditions [60]. By effectively
introducing more degrees of freedom into the binding
mechanism, these additional effects may also alleviate the
constraints anticipated by the high levels of sequence
overlap observed in the present study. These effects may
explain the abundance of TFs from super-families like the
lambda repressor-like and helix-loop-helix TFs, for which
the observed maximal number of TFs are higher than the
expected bounds in the simplest coding models.
The creation of maximal diversity of TFs with minimal
misrecognition error-load might not be the only factor
underlying the smooth codes observed in this study.
Assigning TF pairs with similar biological function to similar binding sequences may have additional functional
advantages. Some of the TF pairs with overlapping binding sequences and similar biological function presented
in this study, such as the yeast MSN2 and MSN4 stress

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:239

response regulators, can partially backup each others
function. Other TF pairs, such as the IRF-1 and IRF-2 in
humans have an antagonistic regulation mode, where one
activates and another represses the same target genes on
different time-scales [37]. This kind of regulation may create a transient activation profile, where target genes are
activated for a short time following induction. TF redundancy [61] and antagonistic regulation may form additional 'forces' pulling TF sequence sets together, increasing
the number of TFs above the strict coding bounds.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study suggests that there are
upper bounds on the number of transcription factors
from different super-families. It seems that the more constrained the binding mechanism, the lower the bound.
The present bounds may be understood in terms of an
optimal coding strategy, in which misrecognition errors
are minimized. As predicted by such a theory, the present
data suggests that TFs with similar binding sequences tend
to regulate genes with similar biological functions. More
generally, similar coding problems may occur in other recognition problems in biology, such as protein-RNA recognition and protein-protein interactions through defined
protein recognition motifs [62,63]. Coding constraints
can potentially limit the number of different protein binding motifs of a given type in the cell, in order to avoid
non-specific cross recognition. It would be interesting to
extend the present approach to these and other molecular
recognition systems.

Methods
Transcription factor numbers
We focused on ten major super-families of transcription
factors: lambda repressor-like, C-terminal effector domain
of the bipartite response regulators, winged helix, srf-like
domains, DNA binding domain (GCC box), helix-loophelix, Zn2/Cys6, glucocorticoid receptor-like (hormone
receptors), C2H2 and C2HC zinc fingers and homeodomains (Table 1). We used the superfamily database (version 1.69) to obtain the numbers of TFs from each superfamily in different organisms. The superfamily database
contains extensive annotations of structural domains of
proteins in 250 sequenced organisms using Hidden
Markov Model profiles [64]. The database contains 1439
super-families. We focused on the major super-families of
transcription factors studied in [15], and added all superfamilies that contained the terms "DNA binding" or "transcription". This resulted in 32 super-families. We further
filtered super-families in which the maximal number of
predicted proteins in a single organism was smaller than
50. For the remaining 10 super-families, we determined
the maximum number of TFs as the maximal number of
proteins from each super-family after discarding organisms with less than 5 proteins and discarding the top 1%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/239

of the remaining organisms. It is important to note that
the super-family domain assignment may contain predicted transcription factors due to the appearance of the
relevant structural domain, which are in fact not functional, or which have other roles in the cell [65]. Thus, the
maximal numbers presently found may be an overestimate.
The coding arguments presented here apply to the
number of distinct DNA binding domains. Since the vast
majority of known binding sites correspond to only one
TF each in a given organism, one may assume that the TF
family size is approximately equal to the number of DNA
binding domains used by that family.
Binding sequence databases
Position-Specific Score Matrices (PSSM) for 46 E. coli transcription factors, were constructed based on the RegulonDB database [66]. The set of transcription factor
binding sequences for each TF were searched for aligned
motifs using AlignACE [67]. We chose the top-scoring
motif, and considered only TFs with four or more aligned
sequences contributing to that motif. Finally we removed
the non-specific DNA binding factors FIS, HNS and IHF
[21].

For the yeast S. cerevisiae, we used 94 PSSMs based on a set
of 102 PSSMs constructed by Harbison et al [9]. We filtered out proteins that either do not bind DNA directly or
always bind as a complex: Gal80, DIG1, STB1, Met4,
HAP2, 3, 4, 5. All PSSMs were converted to a probability
representation, where the sum of each PSSM column is 1.
For humans we used the PSSMs in the JASPAR database
[68]. This data set consisted of 49 PSSMs.
Measurement of sequence similarity
To measure the similarity between binding sequences of a
pair of factors we assessed the distances between their
PSSMs. To compare pairs of PSSMs, we use a distance
measure related to the one used by Wang et al [69]. The
present measure, described below, is stringent in the sense
that it scores bases according to their conservation within
the PSSM, and compares to randomized PSSMs that preserve these conservation profiles. It is more appropriate
for the present purpose than simpler methods such as
direct comparison of sequence Hamming distances,
because the present interest is in the active base pairs in
the site, rather than base pair differences that have little
functional impact on binding.

We denote the length of the binding sequence for TFi as ni,
and its PSSM by Mi. The PSSM is an 4*ni matrix in which
each column, pi,k is a vector of length 4 holding the probability of observing letters A,C,G,T at position k in the set

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:239

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/239

of aligned binding sequences of TFi. For each PSSM we
created an information profile [7] denoted by Ii. The information profile is a ni length vector whose k'th element
quantifies the conservation of position k in the PSSM:
Ii,k = 2 - H(pi,k)

(1)

where
4

H(pi ,k ) = − ∑ pi ,km log 2 (pi ,km )

(2)

m=1

is the entropy of pi,k. Ii,k has a minimum of 0 when all four
bases have equal probability of appearing at position k,
and a maximum of 2 when all aligned binding sequences
have the same base at position k (the small sample size
correction of [7] was applied). As the PSSMs in our database have different lengths, and the 'important' positions
for the TF-target recognition are the conserved positions,
we used the information profiles I as weight vectors when
comparing two PSSMs.
We define the similarity between TFi and TFj as:

Dij = max( ∑ Ii ,k ⋅ I j ,k ⋅ dij ,k )
A

( 3)

k∈A

The maximum is taken over all relative shifts A of the two
PSSMs, with a minimum of 5-positions of overlap. dij,k is
a similarity of the k'th position of the relatively shifted
PSSMs. We used two different measures for dij : One minus
the Shannon-Jensen distance [70]:
dij ,k = 1 − [H(

pi ,k + p j ,k
2

)−

H(pi ,k ) + H(p j ,k )
2

)]

(4)

and a simple correlation between the two probability vectors pi,k and pj,k. Both measures gave very similar results.
For each pair we computed the similarity with the reverse
complement as well and took the maximal similarity. To
detect pairs with significant similarity we first chose only
pairs for:
Dij > f* min(Dii, Djj)

(5)

Where f is a numerical factor (we used f = 0.75). This
amounts to requiring that the similarity between the sets
of binding sequences of two TFs comparable to the similarity between the sequences of each TF. For the pairs that
passed this criterion, we created an ensemble of 1000 random PSSM pairs and computed a distribution of similarities Drij. The random PSSMs were created by randomly
exchanging the A-T and C-G positions in each column of
the original PSSMs. This operation preserves the information profile, as well as the GC content, and therefore

forms a stringent ensemble. Similar sequences were
sequences which had a p-value<0.005 for Dij using both
similarity measures.
Measurement of similarity of biological function of TFs
We defined two pairs of transcription factors as functionally similar if they jointly co-regulate a significant number
of target genes. This information was obtained from transcription regulation networks: For yeast we used the network of [35,36]. For E. coli we used the network based on
the data in the Ecocyc database [34]. It is important to
note that these networks are based on direct experimental
measurements, and not on putative interactions based on
binding site predictions. For each pair of TFs we used a
hyper-geometric test to assess whether the number of
genes regulated by both TFs is significantly larger than
expected from the fraction of target genes of each TF
alone. This measure of functional similarity normalizes
for the variable number of target genes for different TFs.
We used a hyper-geometric test to detect enrichment of TF
pairs with significant target co-regulation in the group of
TF pairs with similar sequences.

A second measure of biological similarity was based on
the similarity of the functional annotation of the gene targets of each factor. We used functional annotations[33,34] for the top tier of the annotation tree (except
sub-cellular localization and general annotations such as
"protein with binding function"). For yeast we used the
following functional categories from the FunCat database
[33]: metabolism, energy, cell cycle and DNA processing,
cell rescue, defence and virulence, interaction with the cellular environment, interaction with the environment,
transposable elements, viral and plasmid proteins, cell
fate, development, biogenesis of cellular components, cell
type differentiation.
For E. coli we used the following functional categories
from the Ecocyc physiological roles annotation [34]: carbon utilization, degradation of macro-molecules, energy
metabolism – carbon, energy production/transport, biosynthesis of building blocks, biosynthesis of macromolecules (cellular constituents), central intermediary
metabolism, metabolism of other compounds, cell division, cell cycle physiology, motility, chemotaxis, energytaxis (aerotaxis, redoxtaxis etc), genetic exchange/
recombination, adaptations, protection, defense/survival,
DNA uptake. Each TF was assigned a profile vector in
which each position holds the fraction of its target genes
with the respective functional annotation. We used a Student t-test to compare the average of the Euclidean distances between profile vectors of TF pairs with significant
sequence similarity to the average of the Euclidean distances between the profile vectors of all pairs. Lack of data

in humans currently prohibits a systematic measure of
functional similarity of TFs.
Assessment of the number of possible sequences
We considered three features in the binding mechanism
of each super-family which contribute to the number of
possible sequences: the number of variable positions in
each half-site, the relative spacing and orientation
between them, and whether the sites are identical (for
homo-dimeric TFs) or not (hetero-dimeric TFs). The
number of possible sequences for a super-family with P
variable positions in each half-site, O possible half-site
orientations and S possible half-site spacings is
4P*H*O*S/2, where H = 1(2) if the super-family binds as
homo-dimers (hetero-dimers) respectively. In our calculations we divide by 2 to account for reverse complementary
sequences. The present study presents these estimates for
six of the ten TF super-families (Table 1) for which data on
these three features were available.

For the Lambda repressor-like super-family, previous
work suggested 3 variable positions in each half site of the
homo-dimer [21,22] and 2 relative orientations of the two
monomers [71], resulting in 43*2/2 = 64 possible
sequnces. Helix-loop-helix proteins can bind as either
homo-dimers or hetro-dimers, and have two variable
positions at each half-site, resulting in an estimated
number of possible sequences of 44/2 = 128. Zn2/Cys6
proteins, such as the yeast GAL4 protein, bind two
sequences of length three, with variable spacing (0–12
nucleotides) and three possible orientations (direct,
inverted or everted repeats) [43], resulting in 43*3*13/2 =
1248 possible sequences. The glucocorticoid receptor-like
proteins have two variable positions at each half site [21],
and can bind as hetero-dimers in three different orientations (direct, inverted or everted repeats) and variable
spacing ranging from 0–8 [72], resulting in 44*3*9/2 =
3456 possible sequences. Winged helix and homeodomain recognize 6 positions as either homo-dimers or
hetro-dimers respectively, with a constant relative orientation and half-site spacing, resulting in 4096/2 and 40962/
2 possible sequences, respectively. An estimation of the
number of possible sequences for multi-domain C2H2
zinc fingers is not given, as these proteins can contain a
variable number of finger domains (between 2 and more
than 30) per protein.
Coding theory bounds – coloring number bound
We treated the mapping between transcription factors and
binding sequences as a coding problem, where the codewords are short DNA sequences of a given length and the
messages are TFs. The code-words are abstracted as nodes
of a graph, where edges connect any two code-words
which differ by one base-pair (Hamming distance 1). This
scenario has some similarities with the genetic code,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/239

where the code-words or "codons" are 3-base-pair strings,
and the messages are the amino acids encoded by these
codons. The error-load is the reduction in organism fitness due to erroneous binding of factor A to the codeword assigned to factor B. At one extreme, minimal errorload can be achieved by mapping all code-words to a single transcription factor. At the other extreme, maximal
diversity is achieved by mapping each code-word to a different transcription factor, resulting in the same number
of TFs as possible code-words.
If one assigns a biological function to the TFs that bind
each code-word, it is clear that minimization of error-load
would tend to smoothen this mapping. That is, TFs that
are likely to bind similar sequences should have a similar
biological function. For every mapping of binding
sequences to factors, one can assign an error load, which
measures the average impact of erroneous binding. It has
recently been proposed [29] that in the limit of large
errors, the maximal number of coded messages is
bounded by the coloring number of the minimal surface
which can embed the code-word graph [29]. Heawood's
formula states that the coloring number is:

1
chr(γ ) = int[ (7 + 1 + 48γ )]
2

(6)

where int [x] denotes the largest integer not greater than x.
The coloring number depends on γ, the genus of the surface embedding the graph:

1
1
d
γ = 1 − (V − E + F) = 1 − V (1 − )
2
2
4

(7)

Here V = qn/2 is the number of possible code words
encoded by a q-letter string of length n, assuming a codeword which is the reverse complement of another is not
available for independent assignment. E = V*(d/2) is the
number of graph edges, and F = V*(d/4) is an estimate of
the number of faces of the surface embedding the graph.
d = (q-1)n is the number of neighbors of each code-word
(by identifying sequences and their reverse complements
each code-word has twice as many neighboring codewords as a code without the reverse-complement constraint but about half of these code-words are not available for independent assignment). Using this we get the
following estimate for the coloring number:
B(n, q) = chr(γ) ≅ 3.5 + 0.75qn ∗ [n(q − 1) − 4)]

(8)

The bound for codes with different n are shown in Table
2.

Coding theory bounds – sphere packing bound
An alternative possibility for the code mapping is one in
which every sequence is assigned to only one transcription factor [6], and the probability of a misread error is
thus negligible. The target DNA binding sequences of each
transcription factor can be represented as a sphere in the
code-word space (Fig 3). The center of each sphere is the
consensus sequence, and all sequences differing from the
consensus sequence by e positions (Hamming distance e
from the consensus sequence) are assumed to be bound
with a non-negligible probability by the TF [2,8,10]. Here
we assumed e = 1.

Unlike the smooth code, the spheres here are non-overlapping. The volume of a "sphere" of radius e, which contains all code-words with Hamming distance of e or less
from a given code-word, is [73]:

The upper bound in (11) is called the sphere-packing
bound [27]. Codes which achieve this bound are called
"perfect codes". In such codes the code-word space is fully
covered by non-overlapping spheres of Hamming radius
1. Generally, the number of non-overlapping spheres is
smaller, as some code-words remain uncovered by any
sphere. The factor of one half in Eq. (10) stems from the
fact that each sequence effectively represents also its
reverse complementary sequence [27].
