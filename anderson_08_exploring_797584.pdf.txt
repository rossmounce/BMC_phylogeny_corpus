Abstract
Background: Ticks are obligate blood feeders. The midgut is the first major region of the body
where blood and microbes ingested with the blood meal come in contact with the tick's internal
tissues. Little is known about protein expression in the digestive tract of ticks. In this study, for
analysis of global gene expression during tick attachment and feeding, we generated and sequenced
1,679 random transcripts (ESTs) from cDNA libraries from the midguts of female ticks at varying
stages of feeding.
Results: Sequence analysis of the 1,679 ESTs resulted in the identification of 835 distinct
transcripts, from these, a total of 82 transcripts were identified as proteins putatively directly
involved in blood meal digestion, including enzymes involved in oxidative stress reduction/
antimicrobial activity/detoxification, peptidase inhibitors, protein digestion (cysteine-, aspartic-,
serine-, and metallo-peptidases), cell, protein and lipid binding including mucins and iron/heme
metabolism and transport. A lectin-like protein with a high match to lectins in other tick species,
allergen-like proteins and surface antigens important in pathogen recognition and/or antimicrobial
activity were also found. Furthermore, midguts collected from the 6-day-fed ticks expressed twice
as many transcripts involved in bloodmeal processing as midguts from unfed/2-day-fed ticks.
Conclusion: This tissue-specific transcriptome analysis provides an opportunity to examine the
global expression of transcripts in the tick midgut and to compare the gut response to host
attachment versus blood feeding and digestion. In contrast to those in salivary glands of other
Ixodid ticks, most proteins in the D. variabilis midgut cDNA library were intracellular. Of the total
ESTs associated with a function, an unusually large number of transcripts were associated with
peptidases, cell, lipid and protein binding, and oxidative stress or detoxification. Presumably, this is
consistent with their role in intracellular processing of the blood meal and response to microbial
infections. The presence of many proteins with similar functions is consistent with the hypothesis
that gene duplication contributed to the successful adaptation of ticks to hematophagy.
Furthermore, these transcripts may be useful to scientists investigating the role of the tick midgut
in blood-meal digestion, antimicrobial activity or the transmission of tick-borne pathogens.

Background
Ticks are notorious as vectors of a large variety of infectious disease agents such as those that cause Lyme disease,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human (and animal) anaplasmosis, babesiosis and many others. As obligate
hematophagic parasites, tick-borne infectious agents are
acquired during the blood-feeding process. The tick midgut is the first tissue that pathogens encounter where
infection must be established before they can migrate into
the internal body organs and tissues. The effects of digestive enzymes expressed in response to the nutritive elements, especially hemoglobin, and the products of their
digestive activities have been shown to inhibit or kill
some invading microbes [1-3]. However, whether such
peptidic fragments would also kill pathogenic microbes is
unknown. In addition, antimicrobial peptides defensin
and lysozyme have been reported from the midgut of a
soft tick [4,5] and evidence of their expression (but not
the peptides) was found in the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis. Although few in number, these reports suggest that
the tick midgut presents a hostile environment for invading microorganisms. Nevertheless, many survive and succeed in colonising this tissue and penetrating the tick
internal organs.
In blood-feeding insects, molecules expressed in the midgut of these disease-transmitting vectors are believed to
play an important role in determining initial parasite
infection and subsequent development. In tsetse flies, for
example, 17 midgut proteins were upregulated and 9 were
downregulated in response to blood-meal intake [6]. In
mosquitoes, blood feeding induces expression of midgut
peptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase; enzymes that may contribute
to success in Plasmodium infection [7,8]. Changes in midgut transcript expression after a blood meal were also
recently reported from the midgut of the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi [9].
Knowledge of the tick digestive process is even more limited. The primary nutritive element, hemoglobin, is
digested intracellularly in acidic phagolysosomes of the
digestion cells. Most of the heme is shuttled to these specialised organelles, designated as hemosomes, where this
highly reactive species is detoxified to hematin [10,11], a
non-crystalline heme aggregate similar (but not identical)
to malarial hemozoin [12]. Acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterases have been reported to occur in the midgut of several hard-tick species [13,14] but their molecular
structure was not identified. More recently, a cysteine
peptidase was identified in the midguts of cattle ticks, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus [15], while serine peptidases were identified in the midguts of two other tick
species, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus [16] and Hæmaphysa-

lis longicornis [17]. Aside from these few reports, little else
is known.
In view of the importance of the midgut proteins in
understanding the process of blood-meal digestion as well
as the fate of microbial infections, we constructed a midgut cDNA library from blood-fed females of the American
dog tick, D. variabilis. We obtained and analysed 1,679
high-quality sequenced random clones from the PCRbased cDNA library which generated 835 unique transcripts. Putative functional assignments were made using
BLAST homologies to other proteins in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant database (NR) and by comparison with a specialised
database containing all Acari protein sequences (ACARI)
and the EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG), Protein
families and domains (Pfam) and Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) protein databases. Here we report the 835 unique transcripts
assembled from these clones and the putative assignment
of 418 of these sequences among 24 different major protein categories.

Results and discussion
Library construction
A total of 1,152 plaque phages were sequenced from each
of the two constructed cDNA libraries for a total of 2304
5' ESTs. A total of 1,679 high quality sequences, including
771 sequences from the 6-day-fed and 908 sequences
from the unfed/2-day-fed libraries, were included in the
bioinformatic analysis. Redundant sequences were clustered into related groups using BLASTN and then assembled into contiguous sequences using the CAP3 assembler
yielding 835 unique transcripts (labeled DvM 1-DvM 835
representing D. variabilis midgut) of which 129 were
derived from two or more ESTs (concensus sequence) and
706 were derived from a single EST (singleton). The 835
unique sequences were compared using the program
BLASTX, BLASTN, or RPS-BLAST [18] to the NR protein
NCBI database, to a custom-prepared ACARI database, the
Gene Ontology (GO) database [19], and to the NCBI conserved domains database (CDD) including KOG, PFAM
and SMART [20]. The three-frame translations of each
sequence were inspected for the presence of a signal peptide using the SignalP server [21]. After removal of vector
sequence and poor quality sequences, all remaining
sequenced cDNA transcripts produced in this study were
submitted to dbEST, a database of expressed sequence tags
(EST) on GenBank. The accession numbers for the unfed/
2-day-fed cDNA midgut library are EX744988 –
EX745928 and 6-day-fed cDNA midgut library accession
numbers are EX743967 – EX744987. Transcripts for
which a putative amino acid sequence could be deduced
and predicted function could be ascertained were submitted to GenBank (EU551603–EU551651).

Assignment of functional classes
Approximately half (50.2%) of the expressed genes
derived from analysis of the cDNA libraries could be
assigned to specific functional categories based on significant homologies to functionally assigned proteins found
on GenBank. Using best match results to the GO and KOG
databases as a guideline, transcripts were assigned to one
of 24 classes based on biological function or to a group of
"uncharacterised conserved function" or "unknown" class
(Table 1). The 24 classes included such biological functions as immunity, metabolism, protein export, protein
synthesis and modification machinery, signal transduction, transporter, nuclear regulation, lipid binding and
transcription. The majority of transcripts (n = 396, 47%)
were classified as unknown due to no match to any of the
analysed databases or a non-significant or irrelevant
match. The most abundant class, both in terms of the
number unique transcripts and total ESTs, was classified
as protein synthesis machinery which contains 32 concensus sequences and 67 singletons totaling 655 ESTs. This
abundance is due, in part, to DvM 2 which consists of 480
ESTs. DvM 2 is a partial sequence and based on a BLASTN
search against a subset mitochondrial gene database, is
most related to Rhipicephalus sanguineus mitochondrial
DNA (AF081829, 4E-056 E-value). The remainder of this

class is composed of ribosomal, mitochondrial and other
housekeeping genes involved in protein synthesis. The
abundance of mitochondrial and ribosomal protein coding genes is not unusual for a transcriptome analysis and
illustrates the high degree of redundancy found in the
libraries, especially the occurrence of numerous sequences
coding for proteins involved in protein synthesis such as
ribosomal RNA, e.g. 40S, 60S and other ribosomal genes.
The second largest functional class includes proteins
involved in energy functions of metabolism (metabolism,
energy containing 163 ESTs which generated 23 concensus sequences and 47 singletons) such as NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidases, cytochome b, adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) synthase and other synthetases (Table
1). As with proteins associated with protein machinery,
proteins involved in metabolism, energy, were highly
abundant. The abundance of energy facilitating proteins is
a feature consistent with the active role of the midgut in
cell growth and hemoglobin digestion during blood feeding.
Other notable classes of biological function include
secreted proteins for which there were 9 concensus
sequences and 37 singletons containing a predicted signal
peptide, protein modification machinery (5 concensus

sequences and 30 singletons) that contains transcripts
coding for proteins involved in oxidative stress such as
glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutaredoxins, peptidase inhibitors and amino acid (aa) metabolism which
includes cysteine, serine and aspartic peptidases. Included
among the transcripts in the cytoskeletal category were
two singletons identified as tropomyosin (DvM 201) and
troponin (DvM 290). Troponin and tropomyosin
together form the tropomyosin protein complex that
serves as ca++ binding proteins, especially the calmodulinlike proteins, identified as CLSP (calmodulin-like skin
proteins in human skin). These proteins are members of
the calmodulin family and troponins. Calmodulin is
important as a signaling protein as well as a cellular regulator where it functions as a second messenger, as a regulator of calcium-dependent enzymes, and many other
cellular functions. Periodic contraction of the smooth
muscles surrounding the midgut is believed to be important during blood feeding.
Comparative analysis of the two cDNA libraries indicated
that each library (unfed/2-day vs. 6-day-fed) were evenly
represented in the combined analysis with 455 and 440
unique transcripts, respectively (Table 1). The average
number of ESTs contributing to each transcript was also
similar (1.40 and 1.58). Notable exceptions to this are the
categories containing aa metabolism and lipid metabolism transcripts which contain more transcripts from the
6-day-fed midgut library than the unfed/2-day-fed library
(Table 1).
The most abundant transcripts identified from D.
variabilis midgut transcriptome
Table 2 summarises the 50 most abundant transcritps (3
or more ESTs) identified from the combined cDNA library
analysis. The table indicates the number of ESTs contributing to the concensus sequence, the representative EST
for each concensus and the best match based on the
BLASTX algorithm to the NR database and a customised
database (ACARI) including all Acari protein sequences
found in GenBank, and the accession number for each
match. The most abundant transcript (DvM 2) comprises
480 ESTs associated with mitochondrial DNA. The second
most abundant transcript (DvM 4) has an unknown function and, interestingly, appears to be secreted with a predicted signal peptide between cleavage positions 24 and
25 (VLS-QE), based on peptide comparison using the Signal P server [22]. The protein sequence for DvM 4 appears
to be full length, based on the presence of a predicted signal peptide and a polyA tail preceeded by a stop codon,
and has a molecular weight of 18.3 kDa and an isoelectric
point (pI) of 8.50. The third most abundant transcript
(DvM 5), comprised of 28 ESTs, is associated with the
metabolic lipid (ML) domain protein, important in pathogen recognition and innate immunity. The fourth most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/552

abundant transcript (DvM 6) with 22 ESTs with similarity
to cytochrome oxidase 1 and the fifth most abundant
transcript (DvM 7) respresented by 19 ESTs associated
with cytochrome oxidase 3, are both important in mitochondrial metabolic activity. The sixth most abundant
transcript represented by 16 ESTs is associated with an
unknown salivary protein in Ixodes scapularis. The seventh
(DvM 1) and eighth (DvM 9) most abundant transcripts
(14 and 13 ESTs, respectively) contained no significant
matches to the NR or ACARI database which are based on
translated BLAST algorithms, but when compared with
nucleotide databases such as the mitochondrial-plastid
(MIT-PLA) and rRNA subset databases using BLASTN significant homologies were found with mitochondrial DNA
species (indicated on Table 2 with an asterisk). The
remaining unique transcripts comprised fewer sequences;
most (62%) had 5 or less ESTs. Twenty-nine transcripts
contained homologies to housekeeping proteins, including 11 concensus sequences with homologies to RNA
structure, RNA binding, translation and transcription, and
nine transcripts appear to be involved in energy metabolism. When matched against the ACARI and CDD databases, most of the abundant transcripts (66%) showed the
highest matches to ticks or other acarines. Three transcripts were recognised as cysteine peptidases (DvM 12,
13, and 42) with close matches to similar peptidases
found in R. haemaphysaloides, R. appendiculatus and H.
longicornis. One transcript (DvM 10) was recognised as a
GST with a very high match to a D. variabilis midgut GST;
another (DvM 20) was tentatively assigned as a mucin
glycoprotein. Eleven transcripts contained unknown
sequences with no functional relationship to known proteins or showed conflicting matches with low E-values
and, consequently, could not be assigned a function.
Categories of putative functions involved in tick midgut
function
Eighty-three transcripts (23 concensus sequences and 57
singletons) were identified as proteins putatively involved
directly in blood-meal digestion by D. variabilis, based on
putative biological function. These include enzymes
involved in 1) oxidative stress reduction/antimicrobial
activity/detoxification (17 transcripts); 2) peptidase
inhibitors (9 transcripts); 3) protein digestion (cysteine-,
aspartic-, serine-, and metallo-peptidases) (26 transcripts); 4) cell, protein and lipid binding, including
mucins (11 transcripts); 5) carbohydrate digestion (4
transcripts); 6) immunity (8 transcripts); 7) iron/heme
metabolism and transport (3 transcripts); and 8) secreted
proteins (5 transcriptss). With the exception of metallopeptidases, secreted proteins and transcripts associated
with lipid function and iron/heme metabolism and transport, all categories showed putative increased expression
during blood feeding (Table 3 and Figure 1). Table 3 sum-

marises the major groups involved in blood feeding and
digestion. Each category will be discussed in detail below.
Oxidative stress, oxidase-related antimicrobial activity or
detoxification
Table 4 lists the 4 concensus sequences and 12 singletons
that contained transcripts for proteins expressed in
response to oxidative stress, antimicrobial activity or
detoxification associated with blood feeding. Most were
found in the midguts from 6-day-fed ticks (n = 23, 75%).
GST comprised the most common members of this category. Seven putative GST were identified (DvM 10, 102
164, 277, 286, 404 and 695), six of which match GST
from other tick species. With but one exception (described
below), all were found in the midguts from the 6-day-fed
ticks and lacked signal peptides, suggesting they are most
likely cytoplasmic proteins. Several of the GST-like transcripts (DvM 10, 102, 286 and 277) are probably not
novel because they show excellent matches (99% identity) to GST from D. variabilis (AA092279.1) and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (AAD15991.1). The identity
of DvM 10 was also confirmed by tryptic digestion/mass
spectrometry (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis comparing
published GST sequences from non-insect arthropods to
those found in this study indicated that DvM 10 and 404
belong to the cytoplasmic GST class Theta (delta/epsilon),
whereas DvM 102 and 164 are most closely related to the
cytoplasmic Mu class (Figure 3) [23]. Alignment of GST
from various tick species supports the phylogenetic placement of our transcripts (Figure 4). Several conserved characteristics also support the phylogenetic placement of
these transcripts; DvM 10 (DvM 404, a singleton, was 5'
truncated and therefore could not be analysed) contains
the hallmark of a Theta class GST with a catalytically
essential serine rather then a tyrosine in the N-terminus;
the SMAIL/TRAIL conserved motif; and several conserved
aa involved in the GST fold [24] (Figure 4). Previous work
[24] identified two GST from D. variabilis both belonging
to the Theta class. This is the first identification of GST
from D. variabilis belonging to another cytoplasmic GST
family, namely the Mu class. The phylogenetic tree supports the functional assignment of these transcripts as
GST. GST are known to play an important role in cellular
stress responses such as may occur as a result of blood
feeding as well as in innate immunity [24-27].

The last GST, DvM 695, a peptide represented by a single
EST found in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, does not
match any tick or acarine species. Rather, it shows a match
to a GST from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and appears
to be a microsomal GST3 (MGST). The microsomal GST
superfamily, termed MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism) [25], is
a glutathione transferase as well as a glutathione-dependent peroxidase. There are six families of MGST including

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/552

MGST1, 2, and 3, leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4), 5lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES). Insect MGST are most similar to
MGST1 and PGES, yet DvM 695 appears to be most
related to MGST3 based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure
5a) and multiple pairwise alignment (Figure 5b). Additionally, the distinctive sequence pattern of known
MGST3 proteins, FNC [AIV]QR [AGS]H [AQ] [HQ]x(2)Ex(2,3)P, was also observed in DvM 695 [26]. D. variabilis DvM 695 appears to be the first MGST identified
from a tick.
Two transcripts, DvM 235 and 509, each a singleton from
the 6-day-fed and unfed/2-day-fed libraries, respectively
(Table 4), appear to be antioxidants known as thioredoxins (TRX) which facilitate the reduction of other proteins
by cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange (for review see [27]).
While thioredoxins are found in nearly all known organisms, only one tick thioredoxin has been deposited in
GenBank (AAV63537.1). BLAST analysis of DvM 235
against the NR database revealed a high similarity (Evalue 4e-038) to an I. scapularis "tick-fed salivary protein
3" (AAV63537.1) identified from a salivary gland cDNA
library and was found to be homologous to the thioredoxin-1 protein [28]. This sequence along with DvM 235
was found in the same major clade with other arthropod
and non-insect arthropod thioredoxin proteins (Figure
6a) and more specifically, in a sub-clade with a thioredoxin from I. scapularis, mentioned previously, and a scorpion thioredoxin (Mesobuthus cyprius, CAE54120.1).
Additionally, the TRX found from ticks contains the characteristic and essential CXXC motif containing the two
vicinal cysteines that enable thioredoxins to reduce other
proteins (Figure 6b). In addition to the antioxidant functions of the thioredoxin family, thioredoxin-1, it has been
shown that when secreted by antigen presenting cells it is
a potent co-stimulator for T-cell activation and growth,
and thus is involved in immune functions [29]. DvM 235
appears to be the first thioredoxin found in D. variabilis
and is putatively assigned to the TRX-1 subfamily. DvM
509 was excluded from subsequent phylogenetic analysis
due to N-terminal sequence truncation.
One transcript (DvM 401), a singleton, found in the 6day-fed midgut library, was found to be homologous to
another antioxidant, glutaredoxin (GRX), which is both
structurally and functionally related to TRXs (For review
see [27]). In vertebrates, three Grx genes have been characterised; GRX1 which is primarily cytoplasmic, GRX2
contain nuclear and mitochondrial variants and GRX5,
which is primarily localised in the mitochondria. Some
members of the GRX2 group contain a single cysteine residue at the putative active site, whereas like all TRX members, other members of the GRX superfamily have a CXXC
cysteine motif. DvM 401 was found in the clade with

other GRX2 members (Figure 7). No GRX sequences from
acarines were found on GenBank, yet our transcript
appears to cluster with other arthropods including an
Aedes ægypti glutaredoxin (EAT33643.1) to which it is
most homologous (Figure 7). Additionally, DvM 401 contains the catalytic site motif, CXXC (data not shown). In
ticks, GRX may be involved in trapping reactive oxygen
species that would otherwise interact with cellular thiols.
Another transcript (DvM 122) found in the oxidative
stress related group was found only in the unfed/2-day-

fed midgut library of which the deduced aa sequence
appears to be homologous to a phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) from Rhipicephalus
(Boophilus) microplus (94% identity) (Figure 8). PHGPx,
along with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are selenoenzymes that catalyse the reduction of hydroperoxides in the
presence of glutathione [30]. Multiple pairwise alignment
of DvM 122 to R. microplus PHGPx illustrates the conserved features of this protein such as the codon TAG coding for selenocysteine and the two active site aa (Gln and
Trp) which interact with selenocysteine (Figure 8) [31].

against exogenous oxidative stress by converting superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen. Based on metal binding
patterns and signature sequence patterns, DvM 199
appears to be a member of the SOD1 subfamily of superoxide dismutases [33] (Figure 9). Interestingly, Cu,
ZnSOD from the bacterium Hæmophilus ducreyi, a gramnegative heme obligate coccobacillus, appears to bind
heme [34,35]. This suggests that this enzyme, in addition
to its antioxidant properties, could function in heme trafficking that would be important in the intracellular tick
bloodmeal digestion process.

Unlike other known PHGPx proteins, DvM 122 as well as
the PHGPx from R. microplus, does not contain a signal
peptide, suggesting that it exists in a cytosolic form. GPx
have been identified from salivary gland-specific cDNA
libraries of I. pacificus (partial sequence, AAT92119.1) and
I. scapularis (AAK97814.1), and midguts of I. ricinus
(CAD68003.1) but do not share significant homology to
DvM 122 from D. variabilis. Aside from R. microplus, no
other acarine PHGPx has been identified until this study.
The tick midgut also shows the presence of enzymes that
function as antioxidants by scavenging free radicals
known as superoxide dismutase (SOD). One SOD was
identified in DvM 199 a singleton expressed in the 6-dayfed midgut library. DvM 199 shared significant identity
with Cu, ZnSODs from various species, including a salivary gland specific Cu, ZnSOD from I. scapularis. Cu,
ZnSODs catalyse superoxide anion into oxygen and
hydrogen peroxide by the reduction and oxidation of a
metal ion which constitutes the catalytically active redox
center [32]. Cu, ZnSOD is important for protection

Transcripts for other oxidative stress peptides include a
metallothionen (DvM 22), which may be involved in
chelating heavy metals, a selenoprotein (DvM 143), a protein disulfide isomerase (DvM 258), and an aldehyde
dehydrogenase (DvM 453) that may function to detoxify
aldehydes, such as toxic byproducts resulting from lipid
peroxidation (aldehyde detoxification) and may be
involved in oxidoreductase activity. The deduced amino
acid sequence of DvM 556 shows significant similarity to
a quinoid dihydropteridine reductase from Gallus gallus
(NP_001006566.1, 7E-076 e-value). Quinoid dihydropteridine reductase has oxido-reductase activity involved in
tetrahydrobiopterin biosysnthesis and amino acid transport and metabolism.
Peptidase inhibitors
Table 5 shows 9 unique transcripts, 8 of which are singletons, found to be associated with peptidase inhibitors. Of
special interest is the finding that three of the peptidase
inhibitors were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts. DvM 626, a putative secreted peptide, showed a
match to a similar serpin from the cattle tick, R. microplus,
known as boophilin, and includes the Kunitz-type trypsin
inhibitor domain. DvM 544, a predicted cytoplasmic peptide, also shows the Kunitz-type domain, strongly supporting its role as a serpin despite its poor match in the
ACARI and BLAST (NR) databases. DvM 602, another predicted cytoplasmic peptide, is a cystatin with the characteristic cystatin domain. The remaining peptidase
inhibitors were found exclusively in the 6-day midguts;
four are putative cytoplasmic peptides while the location
for the other two could not be determined by the Signal P
server.

Two transcripts contained significant matches to serine
peptidase inhibitors known as serpins, DvM 422 with 1
EST and 78 with two ESTs, all expressed in 6-day-fed midguts (Table 5). Serpins are important regulators of serine
peptidases involved in inflammation, blood coagulation,
fibrinolysis and complement activation [36]. Serine peptidase inhibitors include members of the Kazal, Kunitz, αmacroglobin and serpin families. Serine peptidase inhibitors function in insect hemolymph for protection from

infection by pathogens or parasites [37]. DvM 422 contains a full-length sequence and is most closely related to
Lospin 1, 2, and 3 from Amblyomma americanum [38] that
are three of 17 serpins found in the Lone Star tick (Figure
10). In A. americanum serpins are expressed ubiquitously
in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries with Lospin 1,
2, and 3 having the greatest expression in the midgut [38].
Serpins contain a conserved domain (cd00172) and a
reactive center loop, [GREV]-[FRADHP], which is conserved among ticks including our transcript (data not
shown). DvM 78 is 5' truncated yet it contained a significant match to a serpin from H. longicornis (BAD11156).
Two singletons (DvM 312 and 626) contained a significant match to a protein named boophilin identified from
the cattle tick, R. microplus (CAC82583). Although not
definitively characterised, boophilin appears to be related
to a thrombin inhibitor [39]. Similar to boophilin, both
transcripts contain two conserved Kunitz domains
(cd00109) and are closely related to a conserved domain
for BPTI (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor)/Kunitz
family of serine peptidase inhibitors. This domain contains a characteristic disulfide-rich alpha+beta fold as well

as a trypsin interaction site ([PCRAMXS]). DvM 312 and
626 contain two Kunitz domains and 6 cysteine residues
that together create three disulfide bridges, although DvM
312 is 5' truncated, therefore the first three cysteines of the
first domain are absent (Figure 11). A thrombin inhibitor
has been identified and functionally characterised from
one hard tick, Amblyomma hebræum (Amblin, AAR97367)
[40] and two soft tick, Ornithodoros moubata (Ornithodorin, P56409) [41] and O. savignyi, (Savignin,
AAL37210) [42]. The prototype for this family, BPTI, contains two recognition loops, the first of which contains a
single aa (Lys15) that is the principle determinant of
inhibitor specificity. Polymorphisms in these loops contribute to individual species specificity; BPTI inhibits
trypsins and boophilin, ambilin and ornithodorin inhibit
thrombin. The exact mechanism through which thrombin
is inhibited is not understood for hard ticks. The binding
appears to be novel in soft ticks, such that neither of the
reactive site loops contact the peptidase in the Ornithodorin-thrombin complex; rather, the interaction is
through the N-terminal residues [41,42]. It is unknown if
the two proteins identified from D. variabilis are, in fact,
thrombin inhibitors and, if so, if they bind in the same
manner as Ornithodorin. Preliminary examination of the
sequences obtained from D. variabilis suggests an alternative method.
Deduced aa sequences of three singletons, DvM 226, 334,
and 602 shared identity to cysteine peptidase known as
cystatins. All three consensus sequences were truncated at
the N-terminus; thus complete sequences could not be
evaluated. DvM 226 appears to be identical to DvM 334,
yet is significantly more truncated and thus is not represented in the alignments or phylogenetic analysis. Based
on multiple pairwise alignment and phylogenetic analysis, there appears to be two cytoplasmic and one secreted
cystatin found in the cDNA libraries from D. variabilis
midguts (Figure 12). DvM 602 appears to be most related
to R. microplus putative intracellular cystatin
(ABG36931.1) and I. scapularis cytoplasmic cystatin
(AAY66864). Although the aminoterminal region is missing, based on phylogenetic similarity we can presume that
DvM 602 is a cytoplasmic cystatin (Figure 12a, c). Unlike
secreted cystatins, intracellular cystatins do not present
with predicted disulfide bonds which is observed among
our putative cytoplasmic transcripts (Figure 12c). DvM
334 appears to be a secreted cystatin based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure 12a, c). Grunclova et al. [43]
described two secreted cystatins from the soft tick O. moubata. DvM 334 (and DvM 226) is most similar to the two
secreted cystatins from the soft tick as well as known
secreted cystatins from I. scapularis, O. parkeri, I. ricinus
and H. longicornis. Although no signal peptide is present,
due to 5' truncation we have tentatively identified this
transcript as a secreted cystatin. DvM 334 conforms with

other known cystatins [44] such that the molecule has
three papain-binding areas and four conserved cysteines
that create two disulfide bridges (Figure 12b). The three
papain-binding areas are thought to create a wedgeshaped binding site involved in reversible binding in the
active site of cystatin peptidase of the papain family [44].
Grunclova et al. [43] found that the gut specific O. moubata and midgut I. ricinus cystatins shared the third
papain-binding site, characterised by a PW hairpin loop.
This was not seen among salivary gland I. scapularis cystatins but we find this motif in the midgut-specific D. variabilis DvM 334 (Figure 12b). In all cystatins from D.
variabilis, the QNVLG or QVVAG domain is conserved as
in other cystatins (Figure 12a, b). Cystatins are important
in disrupting the activity of cysteine peptidases, enzymes
that are essential for several pathogenic parasites and bacteria. Thus, cystatins not only have the capacity to regulate
normal biological processes but may also participate in
the defense against microbial infections [45].
Peptidases
Peptidases comprise the largest number of putative
expressed genes associated with bloodmeal digestion.
Twenty-six transcripts consisting of 38 ESTs were divided
among four major groups of pepidases found in the midgut of D. variabilis; serine, aspartic, cysteine and metallo
(Table 6).

Serine peptidases
Trypsins and chymotrypsins are the most extensively studied digestive serine peptidases in haematophagous
insects. Five transcripts were found that matched serine
peptidases, all found only in the 6-day-fed midguts. Three
transcripts (DvM 60, 210, and 330) showed high levels of
similarity to serine peptidases from other tick species. All
three transcripts were truncated at the aminoterminus,
thus no secretion potential could be evaluated. Miyoshi et
al [17] described a serine peptidase from H. longicornis
(AB127388) that contained the three conserved catalytic
aa typical for chymotrypsin-like proteins (His-Asp-Ser).
Alignment of DvM 60, 210 and 330 with H. longicornis
and other tick serine peptidases from GenBank revealed
the extent of the 5' truncation of the three D. variabilis
transcripts, yet for DvM 210 the second (D) and third (S)
catalytic aa in the trypsin catalytic triad were conserved
(Figure 13). Additionally, although we were only able to
sequence the 3' fragments of the protein, DvM 60 contains
the conserved serine whereas DvM 330 contained an isoleucine in place of the serine. As seen in other hemotophogus arthropods [46], it may be possible that some of
the serine peptidases found in the tick midgut may be
associated with immunity rather then digestive function.

Two transcripts (DvM 283 and 394) were found to be
most closely related to serine carboxypeptidases. Serine
carboxypeptidases (SCP) are proteolytic enzymes that
exploit serine in their catalytic activity, as with chymotrypsins, SCP have a catalytic triad of serine, aspartate and
histidine (SDH) whereas chymotrypsins have the HDS
triad, which catalyses hydrolysis of C-terminal residues in
peptides and proteins as acidic pH. A SCP from H. longicornis (BAF64246.1) was described by Motobu et al. [47],
which contained the catalytic triad at positions 178, 450
and 397. Alignment of DvM 238 with a SCP from H. longicornis, a salivary SCP from I. scapularis and a SCP from the
jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis illustrates that, although
truncated at the N-terminus, DvM 238 contains the second (Asp) and third (His) aa of the triad (data not
shown). Without further analysis of the full-gene product,
it is impossible to determine whether the first catalytic aa
is conserved. Based on identity with N. vitripennis (E-value
7e-24), it seems probable that DvM 283 and DvM 394 are
midgut serine carboxypeptidases.
Aspartic peptidases
Three transcripts putatively assigned as aspartic peptidases
were identified in the midgut libraries. Aspartic peptidases
are a family of proteins that include pepsins, cathepsin D,
cathepsin E and renins, and are believed to be important
in hemoglobin proteolysis [48]. These enzymes are
involved in degradation of intracellular and endocytosed
proteins and thus have been implicated in blood meal
digestion in some ectoparasites, such as mites [49] and
ticks [46]. Aspartic peptidases have also been implicated

in hemoglobin (Hb) proteolysis [50-52]. Among ticks, an
aspartic peptidase named BYC from R. microplus appears
to be involved in vitellin (yolk protein) digestion as well
as heme binding [53]. We identified transcripts similar to
an aspartic peptidase, cathepsin D (Table 6).
Three transcripts (DvM 108, 249, and 254) contained significant matches to a peptidase in H. longicornis named
longepsin (BAE53722.1), which is known to cleave
hemoglobin. All three transcripts were found only in the
midguts from 6-day-fed ticks; no clones were found in
unfed or 2-day-fed ticks. DvM 249 and 254 were extensively 5' truncated, thus were removed from phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 14a). DvM 108 and 249 are probably
aspartic peptidases since they have an aspartic acid
domain, i.e., Asp-Thr-Gly (DTG) catalytic site motif also
found in H. longicornis [54] and several other cathepsin D
peptidases necessary for its enzymatic activity (Figure
14b). This enzyme is typically found in lysosomes. Boldbaatar et al. [54] suggest that in H. longicornis, this enzyme
"plays an integral role in the proteolysis of erythrocyte Hb
obtained from a host blood meal." The occurrence of a
similar aspartic peptidase in the D. variabilis midgut suggests that it also is likely associated with hemoglobin
digestion. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DvM 108 is
most closely related to H. longicornis aspartic peptidase
and is found in the same sub-clade as other tick cathepsinD proteins (I. ricinus and R. microplus), and is also within
a major clade containing other arthropod cathepsins (Figure 14a).
Cysteine peptidases
Fourteen transcripts were found, comprising either multiple or single sequences, that matched cysteine peptidases
in the ACARI and/or NR databases and at least one of the
CDD databases. Of the 24 total EST containing homology
to cysteine peptidases, 19 ESTs were found in the 6-dayfed midguts, whereas only 5 ESTs were found in the 2-dayfed library, suggesting that the expression of this protein
family is induced during feeding (Table 6). Phylogenetic

analysis revealed three major groups of cysteine peptidases identified among the two cDNA libraries; legumainlike, cathepsin B-like and cathepsin L-like (Figure 15a and
Figure 16a).
DvM 62, 96, and 694 share significant sequence similarity
to a legumain-like protease from I. ricinus. Legumain-like
proteases are members of the cystein peptidase family
(Clan CD, Family C13) and act specifically as asparaginyl
endopeptidases with strict cleavage specificity. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AE) appear to process other proteins
and have been found to be involved in peptide processing
before MHC-II loading [55], protein processing during
seed germination, and, possibly the most relevant to the
hematophagous behavior of ticks, AE have been shown to
activate cathepsin zymogens in the gut of blood feeding
helminthes such as Schistosoma mansoni – allowing Hb
digestion [56]. Recently, AE orthologs have been
described in two hard ticks, I. ricinus [50] and H. longicornis [51]. Each has been shown to function as hemoglobinase. Of the three transcripts found in the D. variabilis
library, two (DvM 62 and 96) appear to be 5' truncated
thus were removed from phylogenetic analysis. The third
transcript, DvM 694, appears to be full length and contains a signal peptide (VAA-AP), indicating its likely secretion from the cell. DvM 694 shares 69% identity with I.
ricinus (AAS94231.1) and 74% identity with H. longicornis
(BAF51711.1) tick legumain and is found in a clade with
other known tick-derived AE (Figure 15a). Alignment of
the three known tick AE is shown in Figure 15b. The residues His and Cys, involved in forming the catalytic dyad
of AE, are conserved among all three ticks including the
transcript identified in this analysis (Figure 15b). DvM 62
and 96 each contain two ESTs found in the six days postattachment midguts, whereas DvM 694 is a singleton
expressed in the midgut of unfed or 2-day-fed ticks. The
three transcripts share 97% aa similarity with only five aa
differences between them; yet without the entire sequence
it is impossible to know if the three share a similar function. Potential differences in the N-terminus could

dases. DvM 542, 287 and 395 were similar to midgut
cysteine peptidases from R. appendiculatus. With the exception of DvM 13, all other transcripts were 5' truncated.
Based on homology to known proteins, DvM 13 contains
a predicted signal cleavage site (TTA-AS) suggesting secretion from the cell (data not shown). Multiple sequence
alignment of tick cysteine peptidases indicated that the aa
involved in the catalytic dyad (Cys and His), which are
present in all papain-like cysteine peptidases, were conserved among the tick species, with the exception of DvM
542, which did not contain Cys (Figure 16b). It has been
shown that two other residues play an important role in
catalysis, a Gln preceding the catalytic Cys, believed to
help in the formation of the oxyanion hole, and an Asn
residue which orients the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His. As with the catalytic dyad, Gln and Cys were also
conserved among the D. variabilis transcripts. Although
there was little homology among the entire length of
sequences, the residues surrounding the catalytic aa were
equally conserved (Figure 16b).

DvM 314, 364 and 42 shared significant identities with
cathepsin-B endopeptidases, while DvM 12, 13, 14, 247,
and 104 were most similar to cathespsin-L cysteine pepti-

Metallopeptidases
Four putative metallopeptidases were found among the
transcripts. All were found only in the midguts from
unfed/2-day-fed ticks. Results from the NR and GO database identified a PA2G4-like (Proliferation Associated
Protein 2G4) conserved domain in DvM 732, whereas a
match to a metallopeptidase was identified based on a
search of the KOG database (E-value 3e-012). PA2G4 is
related to an aminopeptidase M which is implicated in
cell-cycle control. One metallopeptidase, DvM 594, was
homologous to an I. scapularis salivary gland secreted protein, Is6 (AAO85923.1), based on searches of the NR and
ACARI databases. DvM 806, related to a metallopeptidase,
is homologous to a membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase cytoplasmic tail binding protein-1 (E-value 3e009) based on comparison to the NR database. A final
metallopeptidase, DvM 675, appears to have mitochondrial processing peptidase activity and is related enzymes
in the insulinase super family (Clan ME, Family M16)
based on the best match to the KOG database (E-value 2e062). In all four examples, the protein appears to be truncated, thus functional active sites indicative of metallopeptidases remain to be confirmed.
Carbohydrate digestion/Hydrolases
Table 7 lists transcripts for proteins probably associated
with carbohydrate digestion, based on the presence of glycosyl hydrolase, beta-galactosidase and tetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase domains. DvM 107, with 2 ESTs, was represented in both the 6-day and the unfed/2-day-fed midguts; the others were found only in the 6-day-fed midguts.
Three of the four transcripts, DvM 63, 107 and 421 were
identified as putative glycosyl hydrolases, by the presence
of the comparable domains. DvM 421 is also a secreted

this category contained sequences from both the 6-dayfed and unfed/2-day-fed midguts. Included were four glycine rich proteins which appear to be most similar to salivary cement or glycine rich proteins, two BM86-like
surface antigens, four mucin like proteins and a single
transcript for a tick receptor outer surface protein A (TROSPA).

The most abundant group associated with lipid binding
contains four transcripts comprised of nine EST and is
homologous to mucins. DvM 827 and 635 contain a putative secretory peptide while DvM 718 and 20 appear to be
cytoplasmic proteins likely found on the cell membranes.
Mucins are important in coating the lining epithelium of
the gut, which contributes to their role as mucosal barriers. DvM 827 and 635 share identity with a conserved
domain, CBM_14, a chitin binding peritrophin-A domain
characterised by an extracellular domain that contains six
conserved cysteines, forming three disulfide bridges (Figure 17b). DvM 20, derived from six ESTs, found in both
the unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed midguts, also shows a
match to an allergen-like protein from the dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinæ. However, this sequence contains a
conserved domain (Pfam01456) similar to mucin-like
glycoproteins in the midgut peritrophic membrane of
insects [52]. DvM 718, with one sequence found only in
the unfed/2-day-fed midguts, shows a match to a mucinlike peritrophin sequence from the soft tick O. moubata as
well as the chitin-binding Peritrophin-A domain, a characteristic feature of the peritrophic membrane (Figure
17a). The acellular peritrophic membrane, which forms
within as little as 9 – 12 h after the commencement of
feeding [57] lies close to the luminal surface of the epithelium where it protects the gut against injurious particulates and ingested microbes. It has been described from
several species of ticks [58,59]. While DvM 718, 827 and
635 are closely related to other tick mucins, it is interesting to note how similar the mucins from D. variabilis midguts are with putative peritrophins from two sand fly
species, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi
(Figure 17a).
Glycine rich proteins were also abundant in this midgut
category. Three of these putative proteins, DvM 50, 527
and 613, were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts,
while the fourth, DvM 257, was found only in the 6-dayfed midguts. DvM 613 was also a secreted protein. Each of
the glycine rich proteins was similar to tick salivary gland
cement-like proteins. Tick cement proteins are characterised by glycine rich aa repeats that occur as GLG [G/Y/S/F]
tripeptides and may also show a GSPLSGF septapeptide
[60]. All four of the putative glycine rich proteins showed
variations of the tripeptides; DvM 257 also contained the
septapeptide. DvM 257 showed 52% identity with RIM36,
a cement protein from the salivary glands of R. appendiculatus (AAK98794.1) that contributes to the formation of
the attachment cement. In contrast, DvM 527 and 613
showed the highest similarities, 39% and 40%, respectively, to a similar glycine rich cement protein from I.
scapularis. The role of glycine rich proteins in the tick midgut is currently unknown.
Several transcripts were tentatively identified as membrane surface receptors/antigens. Two transcripts (DvM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/552

70 and 558), show a match to Bm86, a membrane-bound
surface protein from Hyalomma anatolicum (AAL36024.1)
as well as Bm86 homologues from R. microplus, H. longicornis and R. sanguineus. Bm86 is similar to mammalian
angiotensin-converting enzyme and, therefore, may function in a similar role in ticks [61]. Both appear to be glycoproteins; DvM 558 also shows a match for the von
Willebrand factor, which contributes to platelet (thrombocyte) clumping. Both transcripts are 5' truncated by
approximately 400 aa, yet along the approximately 232 aa
of the 3' ends they are considerably conserved to other
Bm86-like proteins found in ticks, particularly along the
cysteine framework (data not shown).
A noteworthy finding was DvM 708, which showed a
match for TROSPA, the I. scapularis midgut cell surface
protein that binds to Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. This
protein was found only in the unfed/2-day-fed ticks.
Although the match is relatively poor, this finding may
merit further study. To date, TROSPA has only been
reported from I. scapularis [62].
Transcripts related to Immunity within the midgut
Eight transcritps contained proteins putatively involved in
immunity in the gut of the tick (Table 9). The most abundant transcripts in this group are putative allergen-like
proteins containing ML domains (Figure 18). Two (DvM
5 and 90) of the five transcripts associated with allergenlike proteins were found in both the unfed/2-day-fed and
6-day-fed midguts, while DvM 339 and 378, both singletons, were expressed only in the 6-day-fed midguts; DvM
537, a singleton, was found in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts. DvM 90, present in both the unfed/2-day-fed and 6day-fed midguts, is a secreted protein. The others are cytoplasmic or of indeterminate status. All five transcripts
showed a match for the ML lipid recognition domain and
all match allergen-like proteins or ML domains from
other tick species, namely I. ricinus (AAP84098), which
was found to be induced by a Borrelia infected bloodmeal
in the midgut of this tick [63]. DvM 90, 339, 378, and 5
share significant homology with E1_DerP2_DerF2 protein domain (Pfam02221, E1_DerP2_DerF2) belonging
to a family of ML domain-containing proteins that is a
lipid recognition domain found in plants, fungi, animals
and also includes the dust mite allergen Der P 2. These
transcripts appear to code for a protein similar to the Dermatophagoides pteronyssius mite allergen (Pfam02221,
DerP2_DerF2, ML domain), a lipid-binding protein
which had the closest match to a similar protein in Ixodes
ricinus, and other proteins of unknown function. These
proteins are implicated in pathogen recognition, particularly recognition of pathogen-related lipids and involved
in innate immunity and lipid metabolism [20]. Two transcripts, DvM 90 and 5, contain a ML lipid recognition
domain also present in Niemann-Pick type C2 (Npc2)type proteins and the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatiPage 20 of 37

dylglycerol transfer protein (PG/PI-TP). The latter is a
ubiquitous cytosolic protein of eukaryotic cells that transports phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi to other cell membranes [64]. Both transcripts were
found in the clade with other ML domain containing acari
species (Figure 18a). Allergen-like proteins are believed to
be important in innate immunity by recognising and
binding to lipids found on microbes, including pathogenic microbes ingested with the blood meal. Multiple

pairwise alignment of tick ML domain-containing proteins revealed the conserved cysteine framework found in
allergen-like proteins was also conserved in two D. variabilis derived sequences, DvM 5 and 90, as well as conserved aa involved in putative lipid binging activity
(Figure 18b). In the context of the intracellular digestion
of the bloodmeal, these ML-like proteins could be associated with lipid absorption form the phagolysosomes, a
role that clearly needs more investigation.

The two transcripts tentatively identified as Dorin M-like
proteins (DvM 224 and 231) show matches to a fibrinogen-domain containing lectin-like protein found in the
hemolymph of O. moubata [65]; a similar lectin-like protein, Ixoderin, also occurs in I. ricinus. DvM 231 was
found to show 25% identity to ixoderin and 22% and
24% identity, respectively, to the two lectins from O. moubata. These proteins are similar to fibrinogens and show
the characteristic fibrinogen domain [66]. Notably, Ixoderin was also found in the midgut of I. ricinus [66]. DvM
231 also contained a signal peptide, similar to the other
tick, insect and human lectins that were compared. This
transcript was confirmed as a Dorin-M lectin by tryptic
digestion/mass spectrometry (Figure 2). A second transcript (DvM 224) tentatively identified as a lectin, showed
little similarity to any of the known lectins; its identity is
uncertain. Lectins are believed to play an important role
in antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of ticks
[66,67] as well as in the midgut of many blood-feeding
insects [68].
The last protein we can include in this group is DvM 97,
which is similar to the macrophage migration inhibitory
factor (MIF) also found in the tick, Amblyomma americanum (E-value 3E-049), as well as many other invertebrates. This protein was found in both the unfed/2-dayfed and 6-day-fed ticks. MIF proteins have dopachrome
isomerase activity, a function in arthropods provided by
members of the Yellow family which is involved in melanization [69].
Transcripts related to iron/heme metabolism and transport
Two transcripts tentatively identified as ferritins were recognised, both were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed
midguts (Table 10) (Figure 19). DvM 56, with 3 ESTs, is a
predicted secreted protein, while DvM 131, with 2 ESTs, is
a predicted cytoplasmic protein. Both show an excellent
match to similar sequences from D. andersoni and D. variabilis, as well as the conserved ferritin domain (cd00904).
Ferritin is important as an iron storage reservoir and in
protection against iron overload. Mosquitoes, for example, synthesise and secrete ferritin in response to iron
exposure in direct relationship to iron dose [70]. A tick
heavy chain ferritin was recently shown by Mulenga et al.
[71] to be upregulated in response to mechanical injury
and bacterial infection, thus suggesting its role in antimicrobial activity. Phylogenetic analysis of DvM 131 and
56 reveal the conserved nature of ferritins among tick species (Figure 19a and 19b). DvM 131 is found in the clade
containing other Dermacentor species and is highly similar
to a published ferritin from D. variabilis (AAL75582.1);
therefore, this transcript does not appear to be a novel ferritin (Figure 19a). DvM 56 is found in the same clade as a
horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) ferritin
which is ancestral to the tick-derived ferritins (Figure 19a).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/552

The placement of DvM 56 in this clade, yet separate from
arthropod light chain ferritins, suggests that it is either a
novel ferritin or is involved in a unique function, not previously identified. The conserved aa involved in the ferroxidase diiron center is conserved among the tick
ferritins excluding DvM 56, in which the second aa of the
domain is a lysine rather than a tyrosine, which may contribute to the divergence from other tick ferritins (Figure
19b). DvM 352 is tentatively assigned as an erythrocytebinding protein, although the match is poor (E-value
0.027). Another transcript, DvM 342, tentatively assigned
as a housekeeping protein, may actually function in erythrocyte binding since it shows a good match (E-value 1E016) to the clathrin adaptor protein in D. variabilis and to
the clathrin adapter domain in similar proteins found in
insects and ticks. Clathrin-coated pits are essential for the
binding and internalisation of hemoglobin by pinocytosis
[72].
Secreted proteins similar to tick salivary proteins
Five transcripts were similar to proteins secreted in the
saliva of ticks. Each transcript contained a significant
match to a protein identified from a tissue-specific cDNA
library of dissected salivary glands. DvM 682, 830, 551,
and 134 were found only in the unfed/2-day-fed midguts,
whereas DvM 64 was found in the 6-day-fed guts. Two
transcripts (DvM 682 and 134) had clear signal peptides,
whereas the putative secretion of DvM 830, 551 and 64 is
based on homology to other known secreted proteins.
Unknown, unassigned transcripts
This group comprised transcripts that had low confidence
matches in the NR and/or ACARI databases, or both, or
had conflicting tentative assignments with relatively low
matches. Although many were short and incomplete
sequences, others were long or appeared to be complete
sequences and may represent novel genes. Many (DvM
37) were secreted proteins. The reader may access these
sequences for further study accessing the the supplemental data given in the Methods section of this report.
Protein identifications
Tryptic digestion/mass spectrometry (mass fingerprinting) (Figure 2) provided supporting evidence for the functional assignment of the following transcripts found in
the midgut library: 1) 70 kD heat shock protein; 2) GST
(D. variabilis); 3) Cytochrome b5 (I. scapularis); 4) histone
(I. scapularis); 5) paramyosin (Sacrcoptes scabei, R. microplus); and 6) BM86 membrane glycoprotein (R. microplus;
H. anatolicum anatolicum); and 7) glycogen phosphorylase
(DvM 100, Syntrophus aciditrophicus gi|85858688). Other
proteins found in the tryptic digest but not in the cDNA
library were: 1) prenyl cysteine oxidase; 2) a statin-related
protein (Rattus norvegicus); and 3) a hemelipoglycoprotein
precursor (D. variabilis) (determined by RTB, NIAID, NIH

sequencing facility). The latter is noteworthy in view of
reports of the role of the female tick midgut as a secondary
site of synthesis of vitellogenin, a known hemelipoglycoprotein, as well as in the fat body [73]. Attempts to identify proteins isolated from PVDF blots by Edman
degradation were unsuccessful because they were N-terminally blocked.

Conclusion
In this study, we constructed a PCR-based cDNA library
from the midguts of unfed/2-day-fed and 6-day-fed virgin
females of the tick D. variabilis and analysed 1,679 highquality randomly sequenced ESTs. We obtained partial or
full-length information on proteins and peptides, most of
which appear to be novel. No transcripts were found from
rabbits, the host on which the ticks had been fed. In addition to functional assignments based on the criteria
described previously, we confirmed the identity of seven
proteins by tryptic digestion/mass fingerprinting of bands

eluted from SDS-PAGE gels of midgut extracts, as well as
four other proteins for which no transcripts were found.
Comparison of the transcripts from the unfed/2-day-fed
versus the 6-day-fed ticks indicates that most of the
sequences were found in the latter; few were found in
both. This was especially true for the peptidases; 17 of the
26 transcripts in this category were expressed in the 6-dayfed midguts, and only three appeared in both. The same
pattern is evident for the peptidase inhibitors (6 versus 3),
hydrolases (6 versus 1) and oxidative stress proteins (12
versus 4, with only 1 found in both). This is not surprising, since little blood is imbibed during the first two days
after attachment. However, several functionally important
proteins and peptides were found to have been expressed
in the early feeding period, especially 1) the cell/protein/
lipid-binding proteins that include erythrocyte and hemoglobin-binding proteins; eight of these were found in the
unfed/2-day-fed midguts and one were found in both; 2)
peritrophin, responsible for formation of the peritrophic

membrane, but absent in the later feeding period; and 3)
cysteine and metallo-peptidases, peptidase inhibitors and
oxidative stress proteins, many of which may have an antimicrobial role.
The library shows a remarkable degree of redundancy, a
finding previously reported for the salivary gland cDNA
library [74-76]. Especially noteworthy is the large number
of cysteine and serine peptidases, serpins, hydrolases,
GSTs, dehydrogenase and other free-radical reducing
enzymes, and the numerous binding proteins. Such duplication is consistent with the finding of extensive gene
duplication for genes of great functional value in the
blood feeding process, as suggested by Ribeiro et al. [77].
Only 58 of the 835 (6.9%) transcripts showed signal peptides, indicating that most were involved in intracellular
processes in contrast to the salivary glands, where a much
higher proportion (29%) comprised secreted proteins
[77,78]. Less than half had functional assignments based
on the criteria described above. The large number of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors is consistent with the intracellular digestive processes characteristic of these ticks.
As might be expected, the largest category of transcripts in
the library, with 289 transcripts, comprised the housekeeping proteins, subdivided into a least 23 functional
groups. Most represented transcripts for RNA structural
proteins, transcription/translational activity, metabolism,
cellular and mitochondrial oxidative respiration, antioxidant activity, proteasome machinery, and other housekeeping activities. The remaining non-housekeeping
proteins were much less numerous. Of special interest are
the proteins concerned with blood-meal digestion, especially the peptidases and peptidase inhibitors. When ticks
feed and ingest blood, the hemoglobin liberated from
lysis of the erythrocytes binds to the luminal surfaces of
the midgut epithelial cells. There it is absorbed and incor-

porated into phagolysosomes where it is digested [72].
Studies by more recent workers have shown the presence
in the tick midgut of cysteine peptidases [69], unidentified aspartic and cysteine peptidases [79] and uncharacterised cysteine and serine peptidases [80]. Aside from the
serine peptidases from the midguts of R. appendiculatus
and H. longicornis [16,17,81] and an aspartic peptidase
from H. longicornis [54], none were sequenced or their
molecular structure identified. These enzymes showed
greatest activity at acid pHs, suggesting that they are lysosomal peptidases. However, none have reported as many
different peptidases as were recognised in the D. variabilis
cDNA midgut library described in this paper. Only four,
transcrips DvM 13, 254, 314 and 594 were secreted proteins, indicating that most of these peptidases were functioning in intracellular protein digestion, presumably
digestion of endocytosed hemoglobin within the digestive cells. Three of the cysteine peptidases, DvM 62, 96,
and 694, included a conserved domain for the legumainlike peptidase associated with hemoglobinase, further
supporting the putative role of these peptidases in bloodmeal digestion. Others, such as aspartic peptidases and
serine peptidases also were found without signal peptides,
suggesting they are concerned within intracellular protein
digestion (primarily hemoglobin) in the phagolysosome.
Metallopeptidases are also of interest, of which four were
found in the midgut library. Evidence from insects suggests that they may be important in cellular immune
defense [82]. Interestingly, a metallopeptidase from the
tick I. scapularis was shown to contain fibrin and fibrinogen activities, revealing yet another potential function of
the metallopeptidases found here [83]. Similarities with
known peptidases in other ticks, other acarines and
insects were relatively low (31% or less), suggesting that
most of these midgut peptidases are novel. Another noteworthy finding is the large number of transcripts known

to function as antimicrobial agents, e.g., pathogen-recognition proteins, or in a dual role, e.g., as oxidative stress
reduction and innate immune peptides. In haematophagous insects, microbes ingested with the blood meal provoke an effective defense by upregulating lectins,
lysozyme, defensins, cercropins and other antimicrobial
peptides [78,84,85]. This study suggests that an exceptionally large number of innate immune peptides or proteins
occur in the midgut. Among these are the nine different
peptidase inhibitors found in the D. variabilis midgut
library. Although many peptidase inhibitors have been
reported from ticks, most were from the salivary glands or
hemolymph. A search of the literature showed four serpins in R. appendiculatus expressed in various tick organs
in addition to salivary glands and midguts [86] but only
one from the midgut of H. longicornis [74]. A cystatin
reported from the midguts and hemocytes of H. longicornis
[75] was found to increase up to 1.8 times greater when
the ticks were exposed to Babesia gibsoni or B. bovis, while
the recombinant protein inhibited growth of B. bovis
grown in culture. The finding of numerous transcripts for
serpins and cystatins in the D. variabilis midgut suggests
an important role for those proteins in innate immune
defense. Other proteins expressed during blood feeding
probably play a role in defense against microbial invasions. Included is the von Willebrand factor peptide, an
anti-clotting factor that also occurs in I. ricinus after B.
burgdorferi challenge [63], the ML-domain proteins and
the lectins. ML-domain proteins function as pathogen recognition proteins. The 6-day-fed midguts were also found
to contain two sequences for Dorin M lectin-like peptides.
Several lectins have also been reported from ticks, including Dorin M from the hemolymph of O. moubata [65] and
Ixoderin from the salivary glands and midgut of I. ricinus
[67]. Lectins bind to sialic acid, hexosamines and other
compounds characteristic of the cell walls of bacteria and
fungi and, consequently, they are important in defence
against invading microbes and preventing pathogen/parasite transmission.
It has now become increasingly clear that the midgut of
ticks presents a hostile environment for ingested
microbes. This is evident not only because of the presence
of the more familiar antimicrobial peptides (lysozyme
and defensin), but also because of the expression of oxidative stress-reducing, detoxifying and lipid- or proteinbinding peptides that confer antimicrobial properties,
e.g., GSTs, metallothioneins, peroxiredoxins, midgut
lectins and a large number of peptidases. Microbial infection is known to cause oxidative stress, leading to upregulation of GSTs, peroxiredoxins and other oxidative stressreducing proteins [76]. Clearly, the arsenal of antimicrobial agents is considerably more extensive than just
defensin or lysozyme, which are either poorly expressed
or absent. Indeed, in D. variabilis, the midgut lysozyme

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/552

message was not significantly upregulated by blood-feeding [87] and no evidence of either the lysozyme or
defensin peptides was observed in other studies of the
midgut of this tick [3], although it is strongly upregulated
following the blood meal in O. moubata [88]. However, it
is possible that defensin peptide was overlooked. This
peptide is known to bind with a serine peptidase to form
an SDS-stable complex with an apparent molecular
weight > 26 kDa in the blood-sucking fly Stomoxys calcitrans [89]. In addition to the native tick proteins, fragments of hemoglobin digestion also contribute to
destruction of ingested microbes [1-3]. Bacteria such as
Bacillus subtilis, Escherischia coli and Borrelia burgdorferi, fed
to D. variabilis females by capillary oral feeding were taken
into the midgut, but none could be re-cultured within 24
h after exposure. When midguts of these ticks were examined by electron microscopy, intact B. burgdorferi and rodshaped bodies resembling E. coli were found in several
samples [81]. Since lytic activity does not appear to be the
primary antimicrobial response, it is interesting to speculate that the Dorin M-like lectin and the several secreted
cysteine and aspartic peptidases noted previously may kill
or at least inhibit the survival of these organisms in the
midgut lumen. In contrast to D. variabilis, E. coli cells
ingested into the midgut of the soft tick, O. moubata, were
found to survive in the midgut lumen for up to 20 days,
and were destroyed gradually only after they were endocytosed within the midgut epithelial cells [90]. Within the
midgut lining cells, the upregulation of lectins or lectinlike proteins, numerous GSTs, aldehyde dehydrogenase,
metallothionein, SOD and other oxidative stress enzymes
in response to hemoglobin uptake and digestion would
also contribute to the destruction of invasive microbes.
The authors recognise that the cDNA midgut library is an
exploratory catalogue of transcripts expressed in this tissue in feeding females and is most likely incomplete.
Although functional assignments could be made for
approximately 45% of the concensus sequences and singletons, the remainder could not be assigned, often
because they were not full-length sequences. Other classes
of proteins and peptide transcripts previously reported in
the midgut were not recognised, e.g., defensin [3,83], lysozyme [87], heme transferases and integrins. This annotated catalogue of midgut transcripts from the midgut of a
blood-fed hard tick may be useful to scientists wishing to
investigate the role of tick midgut in bloodmeal digestion
as well as its ability to cope with oxidative stress, antimicrobial activity or the passage of the tick-borne pathogens
acquired during blood feeding. Most of the 418 putatively
identified transcripts expressed in this library appear to be
novel. Similarly, the remaining unidentified transcripts
also lack significant similarities to known tick or insect
proteins. This report makes all available for inspection
and further study.

Methods
Solvents and organic compounds
Water was 18 MΩ quality produced on site using a MilliQ
water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
Organic compounds were obtained from Sigma Chemical
Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA) or as stated.
Ticks
Dermacentor variabilis was colonised and maintained as
described previously [84]. Two groups of virgin female
ticks were used to create the cDNA midgut library. Briefly,
group 1 comprised blood-fed ticks that had fed 6-day on
New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus); group
2 comprised ticks that had fed 2-day on rabbits, along
with unfed females. All use of animals for this research
was done in accordance with protocols approved by the
Old Dominion University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC). The approved protocols are on
file in the Old Dominion University Animal Care Facility
Office.
Tissue collection and cDNA library construction
Blood-fed virgin female ticks were detached from their
rabbit hosts, surface-sterilised with 3% H2O2 and 70%
ethanol and dissected to expose the midguts. For group 1,
samples of midgut tissues were excised from five females,
washed 1 × with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2)
and immersed in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 4°C
until needed. For group 2, sample midgut tissues were
excised from ten 2-day-fed females and ten unfed females,
washed as described above, combined and immersed in
RNAlater. The Micro-Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to isolate mRNA in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions with
some modification [78]. Briefly, the SMART cDNA library
construction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used
to create the PCR-based cDNA library. A 100 ng of mRNA
was reverse transcribed using the SMART PowerScript™
reverse transcriptase and CDS III/3' PCR primer (Clontech) for 1 h at 42°C. Second strand synthesis was done
with a PCR-based protocol using the SMART 5' PCR
primer (Clontech) as the sense primer and CDSIII/3' PCR
primer as the antisense primer. These primers create SfiI A

and B sites as the ends of the nascent cDNA. Doublestranded (ds) cDNA synthesis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer 9700 Thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA, USA) using the Advantage 2 taq-Polymerase
(Clontech). PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 1
min, then 8 cycles at 95°C for 10 s and 68°C for 6 min,
allowed to cool (4°C) and a 3 μl aliquot removed and
stored. PCR amplification was repeated and additional
aliquots removed after every 2 cycles until a total of 18
cycles had elapsed. The aliquots from each group of cycles
were run on an agarose gel with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
and the optimum number of cycles that would avoid over
amplification of the most abundant cDNAs was determined. The double-stranded cDNA was treated with
peptidase K (0.8 μg/μl) and washed (H2O) 3 × using 100
mol wt cut off (MWCO) Amicon filters (Millipore). After
cleaning, the double-stranded cDNA was digested with
SfiI enzyme at 50°C and the cDNA fragments were fractionated using the Chroma spin™ columns provided
(Clontech). Fractions were separated into three different
sizes (large, medium and small), concentrated, washed
(H2O), filtered (100 kDa Amicon filters), concentrated
and ligated into a λ-TriplEx-2 vector (Clontech). The ligation reaction product was packed using the Gigapack
Gold III kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TN, USA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant library
was plated by infecting log-phase XL-1 blue cells (Clontech). The amount of recombinants was determined by
PCR using the vector primers flanking the inserted cDNA
and then visualised on agarose gels (ethidium bromide).
Sequencing the D. variabilis midgut library
The cDNA libraries from the two groups were plated (200
plaques/150 mm plate). Plaques were picked at random
and transferred to the wells of a 96-well propylene plate
containing 75 μl/well. Bacteriophage (4 μl), forward and
reverse primers, sequencing reactions and cleanup were
done as described previously [78]. Cleaned PCR products
were used as a template for cycle-sequencing reactions
using BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing reactions were cleaned using a multiscreen 96-well plate
cleaning system (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Dried samples

were resuspended with 25 μl of deionised, ultrapure, formamide. Samples were directly sequenced on an ABI 96
capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) or stored at -80°C.
Bioinformatics analysis
A detailed description of the bioinformatic treatment of
the data appears in Valenzuela et al. [85]. Data manipulation was preformed using a set of customised executable
programs written in Visual Basics by José M.C. Ribeiro at
the National Institutes of Health. Primer and vector
sequences were removed from the raw sequences and the
resultant (cleaned) sequences were compared against the
NR protein database using an executables program
obtained at the NCBI FTP site [91]. Related sequences
were grouped into clusters and aligned using CAP3
sequence assembly program [92]. Using the appropriate
BLAST algorithm (BLASTX, BLASTN or RPS-BLAST), individual concensus sequences and singletons were compared to the NR protein database of the NCBI, the GO
fasta subset [93], CDD of NCBI [20] containing the KOG
[94], Pfam [95] and SMART [96] protein motif databases
[18] and to custom-downloaded databases containing the
ACARI (a subset containing mite and tick sequences),
mitochondrial/plastid and rRNA nucleotide sequences
available at the NCBI. We submitted all translated
sequences (starting with a Met) to the Signal P server [97]
to detect signal peptides indicative of secretion. The threeframe translation of each dataset was used to determine
open reading frames (ORF). Only ORF that started with a
methionine and were longer than 40 amino acid (AA) residues were submitted to the SignalP server. The grouped
and assembled sequences, BLAST results and signal peptide results were combined in an Excel spreadsheet and
manually verified and annotated. A stand alone file which
the user should download and extract is found at: http://
exon.niaid.nih.gov/transcriptome/D_variabilis_midgut/
DVMG.tar.gz. Additionally, a hyperlinked excel file can be
obtained from: http://exon.niaid.nih.gov/transcriptome/
D_variabilis_midgut/DVMG-web.xls
Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis of transcripts of interest, the
consensus sequence was translated into the appropriate
open-reading frame using EditSeq software (DNAStar).
Related protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI
and aligned using ClustalX [98]. The resulting alignment
was manually refined and trimmed using BioEdit
sequence-editing software [99]. Alignments were then
submitted to ProtTest version 1.2.6 [100] to determine the
best-fit model protein substitution for each particular
alignment. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on protein alignments using Tree Puzzle version 5.2 [101] incorporating the predicted model of evolution as defined by
ProtTest. Tree Puzzle constructs phylogenetic trees by
maximum likelihood using quartet puzzling, automati-

cally estimating internal branch node support (1000
bootstrap replications) [102]. Trees were visualised and
annotated using Mega 4.0 [103]. The names of the
sequences in the alignments and phylograms were abbreviated with the species initials and GenBank accession
number; for the transcripts from the cDNA libraries, the
transcript number was added.

the hyperlinked files.
Protein identification
Blood-fed female ticks were detached, surface washed
with 70% ethanol: 3% H2O2 to remove contaminants.
The midguts were removed, washed in PBS buffer and
homogenised in cold (4°C) in lysis buffer containing 20
mM Tris-HCL, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% TritonX 100 and 10% glycerol [105], supplemented with 0.1 –
0.2 mM PMSF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a 200-fold
dilution of peptidase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The
extract (N = 25) was sonicated, centrifuged at 14,000 × g,
and then frozen (-20°C) until needed. Bradford protein
assays were performed as described by the manufacturer
(BioRAD, Richmond, CA) using immunoglobulin G as
the standard. Samples (~40 μg per lane) of the midgut
protein extract were electrophoresed using NuPage 4 –
12% 1 mm thick gradient gels under reducing conditions
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Relative mol wts were estimated using pre-stained
SeeBlue™ and unstained Mark 12™ mol wt markers (Invitrogen). For amino-terminal sequencing of the midgut
proteins, the proteins were electro-blotted to PVDF blot
paper in a Xcell II Mini-Cell with transfer buffer (Invitrogen) and the membrane stained with 0.025% Coomassie
Blue (R) in the absence of acetic acid. Stained bands were
cut from the blot membrane and subjected to Edman degradation in a Procise sequencer (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The
resultant AA sequences were searched against the most
likely protein translations of each cDNA sequence
obtained in the mass sequencing project, as described previously [78]. Identifications were also done by tryptic
digestion/mass fingerprinting of selected gel slices excised
from the protein gels at the University of Virginia's Keck
Biomolecular Research Facility as described previously
[3,80], and at the Proteomics Facility, Research Technology Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases. The sensitivity of detection would detect proteins or peptides even when present in concentrations as
low as 1% of the sample.
