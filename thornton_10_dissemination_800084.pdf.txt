in Bacteroides fragilis by mobile genetic elements

Abstract
Background: The C10 family of cysteine proteases includes enzymes that contribute to the virulence of bacterial
pathogens, such as SpeB in Streptococcus pyogenes. The presence of homologues of cysteine protease genes in human
commensal organisms has not been examined. Bacteroides fragilis is a member of the dominant Bacteroidetes phylum
of the human intestinal microbiota, and is a significant opportunistic pathogen.
Results: Four homologues of the streptococcal virulence factor SpeB were identified in the B. fragilis genome. These
four protease genes, two were directly contiguous to open reading frames predicted to encode staphostatin-like
inhibitors, with which the protease genes were co-transcribed. Two of these protease genes are unique to B. fragilis
638R and are associated with two large genomic insertions. Gene annotation indicated that one of these insertions
was a conjugative Tn-like element and the other was a prophage-like element, which was shown to be capable of
excision. Homologues of the B. fragilis C10 protease genes were present in a panel of clinical isolates, and in DNA
extracted from normal human faecal microbiota.
Conclusions: This study suggests a mechanism for the evolution and dissemination of an important class of protease
in major members of the normal human microbiota.
Background
Bacteroides fragilis is a Gram-negative member of the
normal human gut microbiota. The Bacteroidetes constitutes one of the major bacterial phyla in the healthy
human gut [1]. However, B. fragilis is also an important
opportunistic pathogen, and it is the most frequently isolated anaerobic bacterium in clinical specimens, including abdominal abscesses and bloodstream infections [2].
Indeed, while B. fragilis accounts for only 4 to 13% of the
normal human fecal microbiota, it is responsible for 63 to
80% of Bacteroides infections [3]. Only a few virulence
factors have been described for B. fragilis, with the best
characterized being the polysaccharide (PS) capsule [4]
and a secreted metalloprotease, fragilysin [5]. The capsule, which displays antigenic variation, promotes the formation of abscesses [4], and the reduction of proinflammatory responses to B. fragilis [4,6]. The metalloprotease fragilysin, which has been linked to diarrheal
disease [5], has activity against the zonula junctions
between cells, and could disrupt tissue integrity [7]. B.

fragilis also encodes homologues of C10 proteases [8].
These are members of the CA clan of papain-like proteases. Other C10 proteases include the important virulence factors Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB)
from Streptococcus pyogenes and Interpain A from Prevotella intermedia. SpeB cleaves a variety of host protein,
including immunoglobulin, fibronectin and vitronectin; it
also activates IL-1β and releases kinin from kininogen [9].
Interestingly, both SpeB and Interpain A target and inactivate complement factor C3 [10,11]. One further characterized C10 protease is the Periodontain from the oral
pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, which cleaves α1proteinase inhibitor promoting degradation of connective tissue components [12].
For both SpeB and another well characterized family of
cysteine proteases (C47 family) expressed in staphylococci (Staphopain), the protease genes are found juxtaposed to genes encoding specific protease inhibitors, Spi
[13] (a propeptide analogue) and Staphostatin [14] (a
lipocalin-like entity), respectively.
The genomes of Bacteroides spp., including B. fragilis,
may include plasmids [15], and typically include multiple
prophage remnants, pathogenicity islands and both con-

jugative and non-conjugative transposons (CTn and Tn
respectively) [16]. This would facilitate acquisition and
dissemination of virulence markers. Indeed, the fragilysin
is encoded on a pathogenicity island which has been
shown to be mobile [17].
This study centers on the identification and characterization of genes encoding homologues of SpeB, their
genetic linkage with putative inhibitors, and the association of these homologous genes with mobile genetic elements.

Results
The B. fragilis genome harbours four paralogous C10
protease genes

A phylogenetic study was undertaken to determine the
relatedness of C10 proteases in other members of the
Bacteroidetes phylum (Fig. 1). This identified eight-four
C10 protease candidates, ranging in size from 269 to 1656
amino acids, in organisms that occupy both human and
environmental niches. The larger of these proteins (>600
amino acid residues, average length 803 residues) group
together along with SpeB and Interpain A. These larger
proteins have additional C-terminal domains, the role of
which is yet to be determined [12,18]. The Bfp proteases
group with proteins <500 amino acid residues in length
(average length 435 residues). Although acceptable bootstrap values were obtained for nodes separating deeper
phylogenetic levels, the bootstrap values for the shallower
divisions were low. This reflects the unstable phylogeny
obtained. However, it is noteworthy that all of the candidate protease sequences had a variation on the two active
site motifs indicated in Fig 2.
Of particular interest was the identification of SpeB
homologues in B. fragilis. Analysis of the B. fragilis 638R
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/bf/, YCH46 [19]
and NCTC9343 [7] genome sequences identified genes
encoding a paralogous family of C10 cysteine proteases
named Bfp1 (BF638R0104, 45390), Bfp2 (BF638R1641,
56666), Bfp3 (BF638R3679, 47323), Bfp4 (BF638R0223,
48433) for B. fragilis protease, encoded by genes bfp1-4
respectively. The locus identifiers for the unpublished
638R genome, followed by the predicted molecular mass
of the preproprotein in Daltons are given in parenthesis.
bfp1 and bfp2 were present in all three strains whereas
bfp3 and bfp4 were present only in B. fragilis 638R (Table
1).
Similarity between the predicted Bfp protein sequences
and zymogen SpeB ranges from 33-41.2%, with similarity
between the paralogues themselves higher (36.7-46.1%)
(Table 2). These low values are not surprising, as it has
been established that the overall sequence identity and
similarity between the CA clan of Papain-like proteases is
low [20]. However, the core of the the protease domains
of the C10 proteases SpeB (1DKI) and Interpain (3BBA)

Page 2 of 15

[18] are similar in structure (root mean squared deviation
of 1.220 Å based on 197 Cα positions), even with only
32.5% sequence identity. Critically, the active site residues
(Cys165 and His313, SpeB zymogen numbering [21]) are
highly conserved (Fig. 2). It is probable that the bfp genes
encode active proteases, and thus, may contribute to the
pathogenesis of Bacteroides infections in a manner analogous to the role of SpeB in streptococcal pathogenesis
[22].
Bacterial cysteine protease genes have been found coupled to genes encoding specific inhibitors, therefore, the
regions both up and downstream of the four bfp genes
were analyzed for candidate inhibitors. Three open reading frames encoding small proteins (116-138 amino
acids) within 35 base pairs of the proteases were identified. These were named bfi1A (BF638R0103), bfi1B
(BF638R0105) and bfi4 (BF638R0222) (for Bacteroides
fragilisinhibitor). The encoded proteins showed no significant identity to the propeptides of any known protease, nor to Spi. Surprisingly, they had identity to the
C47 cysteine proteases inhibitors, the Staphostatins,
ranging from 15.0-23.4% identity and 32.6-45.7% similarity (Table 3). This is in line with identity between Staphostatin A and Staphostatin B with 20.4% identity and
45.0% similarity. Despite low levels of sequence identity,
analysis of the predicted secondary structure and the
conservation and alignment of a critical glycine residue in
these sequences (indicated in Fig. 3) when compared to
Staphostatins, suggested that these bfi genes encode specific protease inhibitors.
To determine the likely cellular location of Bfp and Bfi
proteins, the respective sequences were analyzed using
LipPred [23], LipoP [24], SignalP [25] and PSORTb [26].
These analyses suggested that Bfi1A has a typical Sec
pathway leader sequence and is likely to be exported to
the periplasm. Bfi1B, Bfi4, Bfp1, Bfp2 and Bfp4 have predicted lipoprotein signal sequences and are likely to be
tethered to the outer membrane [24,27]. Whilst Bfp3 has
a lipoprotein leader sequence it is not clear which membrane it is likely to associate with. It should be noted that
maturation of C10 zymogens would release the active
protease from the anchoring acyl-lipid into the extracellular milieu.
B. fragilis C10 proteases genes, bfp1 and bfp4, are cotranscribed with those for predicted Staphostatin-like
inhibitors

For both the streptococcal and staphylococcal systems,
the proteases and adjacently encoded inhibitors are cotranscribed [13,28]. To determine if this transcriptional
coupling of protease and inhibitor genes was also present
in B. fragilis, RNA was isolated from broth grown 638R
cells, and analysed by reverse transcriptase PCR, using a
series of specific primers for the protease and inhibitor

Figure 2 Amino acid sequence alignment of the Bacteroides fragilis proteases Bfp with the archetype C10 protease SpeB from Streptococcus pyogenes. The alignment was generated with T-coffee [55]. The red back-highlight regions indicate the sequences flanking the critical active site
Cys and His residues (vertical black arrowhead).

the B. fragilis NCTC9343 and B. fragilis 638R genome
sequences identified two large insertions in strain 638R
associated with the chromosomal locations of bfp3 and
bfp4. In B. fragilis 638R, bfp4 was found on a 55.9 Kb
insertion, called Bfgi2 in this study. Annotation of this
insertion revealed an architecture similar to the CTnERLtype conjugative transposons (CTn) [30] (Fig. 5, panel A
and Table 5). Although the expected integrase, excisionase and transfer regions were present in Bfgi1, mobility of
this insertion could not be established for broth grown
cultures treated with mitomycin C, tetracycline, or UV
treatment (data not shown). These treatments are commonly used to initiate excision of CTn elements [31,32].
Bfgi1 showed homology to a region in Porphyromonas
gingivalis ATCC 33277 which has previously been char-

genes (Table 4). Amplicons were detected for all C10 protease structural genes suggesting that all the proteases
were transcribed in vitro (Fig. 4, Lanes 2, 6, 7 and 8 for
bfp1, bfp2, bfp3 and bfp4 respectively). Amplification of a
1.9 Kb product (Fig. 4, Lane 5) using primers Bfi1A_F and
Bfi1B_R supports the hypothesis that bfp1 is co-transcribed on a single mRNA with bfi1A and bfi1B. In addition, amplification of a 1.65 Kb product with primers
Bfp4_F and Bfi4_R suggests that bfp4 is transcriptionally
coupled to bfi4 (Fig. 4, Lane 9).
bfp3 and bfp4 are located on genome insertions

As mentioned above, two of the protease genes (bfp3 and
bfp4) were identified only in strain 638R enabling a comparison with the two other sequenced strains of B. fragilis. Using the Artemis comparison tool [29], alignment of

acterized as a CTn [33]. However, this region of ATCC
33277 did not encode a C10 protease.
The bfp3 gene was located on a 39 Kb insertion, called
Bfgi2 in this study. Analysis of this region predicted functional modules, e.g. DNA metabolism, DNA packaging,
prophage head, tail and lysis proteins, consistent with a
bacteriophage genomic structure similar to the Siphoviridae family of bacteriophages (Fig. 5, panel B and Table 6).
These phage are known to infect bacteria that reside in
the gut, and are the most frequently identified phage
infecting B. fragilis [34]. Similarly to other Siphoviridae,
Bfgi2 inserts into the 3' end of the tRNAArg gene [31].
The attB site overlaps the tRNAArg gene, however integration of Bfgi2 regenerates a functional tRNAArg gene.
Bfgi2 had homology only with a region of a genome for an
unidentified Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides sp. 3_2_5),
which included a homologue of bfp3.
The regions flanking the C10 loci in a range of Bacteroidetes (B. thetaiotaomicron (AE015928), B. uniformis
(AAYH00000000), B. ovatus (AAXF00000000), B. intestinalis (ABJL00000000), Parabacteroides distasonis
(CP000140), Porphyromonas gingivalis (AP009380,
AE015924) and Prevotella intermedia (ID: 246198) were
examined for the presence of markers for mobile genetic
elements (e.g. the Tra functional module, or phage structural modules for instance tail, and capsid). The GenBank
accession code or JCVI taxon numbers are given in
parenthesis. A cassette of Tra genes (A through O, locus
tags PG1473-1486) was found 35.3 Kb away from prtT in

Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83 (locus tag 1427)
and again in strain ATCC 33277 Tra I to Q were found
(locus tags PGN_592 to PGN_599) 40.5 Kb away from
PrtT (PGN_0561) in that strain. However, no complete
CTn or phage could be found adjacent to these or any
other C10 protease gene.
The Bfgi2 element harbouring the bfp3 gene is capable of
excision

The putative att sequence for the integration of Bfgi2 was
identified by analysis of the sequence at the boundaries of
the inserted DNA in strain 638R compared with
NCTC9343. A short 16 bp direct repeat sequence was
identified flanking the Bfgi2 insertion (Fig. 6, panel A).
PCR primers Bfgi2_attB_F and Bfgi2_attB_R (Table 4)
were used in a PCR reaction to detect the excision of the
Bfgi2 prophage from mitomycin C treated B. fragilis 638R
cells. The resulting 595 bp PCR product is consistent with
excision of Bfgi2 from the B. fragilis 638R genome (Fig. 6,

gene (Fig. 6, panel C). Sequencing of this PCR product
indicated the presence of a single copy of the 16 bp repeat
region, the proposed attB site for Bfgi2 (Fig. 6, panel C).
The mitomycin C-treated cells were also analysed for
the presence of the Bfgi2 circular intermediate. The primers Bfgi2_Int_F and Bfgi2_Int_R (Table 4) were designed
directed outwards across the proposed attL and attR
sites. Using these primers, amplification of product
should only occur if a circularized form of Bfgi2 is present

Figure 3 Structure and sequence based alignments of Staphostatins with putative inhibitors from Bacteroides fragilis. Panel A is a sequence
alignment generated with T-coffee. Superimposed on this are secondary structure predictions for all 5 proteins, generated with GorIV [46]. Residues
with secondary structure assigned as coil, β-strand, and α-helix are back-highlighted in yellow, red and blue respectively. The glycine residue conserved in Staphostatins is marked with a vertical black arrowhead. Panel B is a sequence alignment of Staphostatin A (1OH1A [56]) and Staphostatin
B (1NYCB [14]). The sequence based alignment was generated with T-coffee. This alignment is coloured, as for panel A, according to secondary structure determined from the crystal structures of the two inhibitors. For clarity the spacing is preserved from panel A. These alignments suggest that
GorIV is over-predicting helical content in the staphostatins.

in the cell. The size (2.25 Kb) sequence of the resulting
PCR product confirmed the presence of the circular
intermediate (Fig. 6 panel B, Lane 3). Attempts to show
plaque formation using NCTC9343 as an indicator strain
did not produce any visible plaques. This could be due to
the phenomenon of limited host range for the bacteriophage. However, given that Bfgi2 circular intermediate
was detected it is tempting to speculate that it is, or is a
derivative of an active phage and such phage could be
transmitted to a non-lysogenized strain of B. fragilis,
bringing with it a copy of a C10 protease.

C10 protease genes are present in clinical isolates of B.
fragilis and in the healthy human faecal microbiota

In addition to the 3 genome strains, a panel of 5 clinical
isolates of B. fragilis from several human infection sites
(Table 7) were tested by allele-specific PCR for the C10
protease genes they harbour. The results indicated that
this panel of strains have a complement of bfp genes more
similar to NCTC9343 than to 638R (Table 1). The distribution of bfp genes in the clinical isolates is not identical,
and none of the 5 isolates carried all four bfp genes. The
bfp1-4 genes were detected in 3, 5, 1 and 0 clinical isolates

these clinical strains, while bfp1 was not detected in two
strains (NCTC 10584 and NCTC 11295). In contrast,
bfp2 was encoded by all strains. In B. fragilis strain
YCH46, there is a CTnERL-type conjugative transposon
353 bp distance from the bfi1A-bfp1-bfi1B gene cluster.

However, this conjugative transposon is not present in
either of the other two sequenced B. fragilis genomes,
638R and NCTC 9343. The bfp3 gene was only detected
in one clinical isolate (NCTC 9344), with a concomitant
detection of the Bfgi2 insertion. In all cases a 595 bp fragment was successfully amplified using the primer pair

Bfgi2_attB_F and Bfgi2_attB_R (not shown), indicating
the presence of a free integration site for Bfgi2 in all
strains. It should be noted that for NCTC 9344 and 638R,
there was a lower product yield and although not quantitative this is likely due to the integration of Bfgi2 in a subpopulation of the cells.
Presence of bfp genes in the healthy human intestinal
microbiota was investigated by PCR analysis performed
on total DNA extracted from faeces from three adult subjects. The amplification of the appropriately sized DNA
fragments indicated that all 4 bfp genes characterized in
this study were present in all three subjects whose samples were tested (Table 1). Interestingly, this analysis also
indicated the presence of an integrated Bfgi2 prophage in
these faecal samples, as well as free attB sites.

Discussion
This study has established the presence of homologues of
the streptococcal virulence factor SpeB in a significant
gut microorganism, B. fragilis. The amplification of bfp14 specific sequences from mRNA samples supports the
idea that these protease genes are expressed in vivo and in
two cases the protease genes (bfp1 and bfp4) are coupled
to genes encoding proteins resembling Staphostatins-like
inhibitors. A role in protection of the bacterial cells from
ectopic protease has been mooted for these inhibitors
[35]. From sequence analysis, the Bacteroides inhibitors

are likely to localize to the periplasm and cell membranes,
which could be an additional mechanism to protect the
bacterial cell from proteolytic damage, similar to roles
suggested for Spi and the Staphostatins.
The presence of two Bfp protease genes on mobile
genetic elements parallels some of the paradigms for the
acquisition of virulence determinants by other microorganisms. For example the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin
of Staphylococcus aureus [36], SpeC of S. pyogenes [37],
diphtheria toxin of Corynebacterium diphtheria [38] and
cholera toxin of Vibrio cholera [39] as well as the
fragilysin of B. fragilis [40] are all encoded by mobile
genetic elements. Although the latter case has yet to be
conclusively established, the other examples cited, and
many others in the literature, illustrate an augmentation
of virulence in the recipient organism. Thus, the acquisition of additional copies of a protease with homology to
SpeB by lateral gene transfer may increase the ability of B.
fragilis to cause disease. However, establishing the mechanism of transfer of these protease genes and the role of
the encoded proteases in B. fragilis opportunistic infections will require further studies.

Conclusion
The phylum Bacteroidetes constitutes a major proportion
of the healthy human intestinal microbiota. Variations in
the Bacteroidetes proportion are linked to disease, and

Figure 5 Insertions in the genome of Bacteroides fragilis 638R carry C10 protease homologues. Genome alignment of B. fragilis strains 638R and
NCTC9343 was generated using the Artemis Comparison Tool. The co-ordinates for the insertions are from the unpublished 638R genome. Genes in
the insertions are represented by horizontal open coloured arrows and are described below (see also Tables 5 and 6). The G+C content of the insertions is plotted in the lowest section of each panel. The grey horizontal line in each case represents the average G+C content for the genome. For
both panels the C10 proteases are represented by horizontal red arrows and the pale blue arrows are genes that are not directly related to the skeleton
of the particular mobile genetic element. Panel A. The insertion Bfgi1 has the features of a CTn. The putative integrase and excisionase genes (Int and
Ex respectively), ABC transporters (ABC), mobilization genes (Mob), and transfer genes (Tra) are represented by royal blue, dark green, grey and yellow
arrows respectively. Panel B. The insertion Bfgi2 has the architecture of a Siphoviridae bacteriophage. The lysis cassette, tail region, head regions, packaging (Pkg) and the replication and modification genes (Rep/Mod) are represented by teal, mid-grey, moss green, royal blue and peach arrows respectively.

selected species are significant causes of human infectious disease. Alterations in the composition or function
of the Bacteroidetes component of the intestinal microbiota might plausibly be involved in diseases involving
immune dysregulation, including Inflammatory Bowel
Disease, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Bacterial proteases
are particularly relevant in this context, because they
might be involved in the perturbed regulation of host
matrix metalloproteases, which is a feature of IBD [41].
Thus the linkage of C10 proteases genes to mobile
genetic elements in B. fragilis, and the demonstrated
presence of these coding sequences in the healthy adult
gut microbiota, is potentially significant. Experiments to
investigate the expression and function of these genes in
vivo are in progress.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

Bacteroides fragilis strains used in this study are presented in Table 7. All strains were purchased from the
United Kingdom National Culture Collection (UKNCC)
except 638R which was a kind gift from Dr Sheila Patrick,
Queen's University, Belfast. Both B. fragilis strains and B.
thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 [42] were grown in an anaerobic chamber at 37°C. Cultures were grown without
shaking in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml hemin and 0.5 μg/ml menadione.
Media for plating was made from Brain Heart Infusion
agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood, 50
μg/ml hemin and 0.5 μg/ml menadione.

Bioinformatics and sequence analysis

Members of the C10 protease family in B. fragilis were
detected by BLAST analysis [43]. Sequences were aligned
by CLUSTAL W [44] or T-Coffee [45]. Protein secondary
structure was predicted using GorIV [46] and JPred [47].
Protein export signals were identified using the algorithms using LipPred [23], LipoP [48], SignalP [25] and
PSORTb [26]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary
analyses were conducted using genetic-distance-based
neighbour-joining algorithms [49] within MEGA Version
4.0 http://www.megasoftware.net/. Bootstrap analysis for
1000 replicates was performed to estimate the confidence
of tree topology [50]. MegaBLAST [51] was used to
search all NCBI genomes for Bfgi1 and Bfgi2.
Molecular techniques

Standard techniques were employed for molecular analysis [52]. Bacteroides genomic DNA was prepared as
described by [53]. Total microbial DNA was extracted
from human faeces, collected under an ethically
approved protocol, by a glass beads-Qiagen Stool kit
method previously described [54]. PCR reactions were
carried using 10-30 ng of genomic DNA from B. fragilis
638R as template and using Phusion Polymerase (New
England Biolabs). The primers Bfp3_F and Bfgi2_Int_F
(Table 4) were used for detecting the attP sites for Bfgi2.
Bfgi2_attB_F and Bfgi2_attB_R (Table 4) were used for
determining the attB attachment sites for Bfgi2 integration. The primers TraQ_F and Int_F were used in testing
for the presence of the circular intermediate for Bfgi1.

Primers to detect the circular intermediate for both Bfgi1
and Bfgi2 were designed, pointing outwards, flanking the
ends of each predicted element. Primers to detect the
attB site in Bfgi2 were designed, pointing inwards, flanking the proposed excision point for the Bfgi2 prophage
DNA.
Total RNA isolation for Reverse Transcription analysis

B. fragilis 638R and B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 were
cultured under anaerobic conditions until early logarithmic phase and the cultures were then immediately centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4000 × g. Total RNA extraction
from B. fragilis 638R and B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482
was carried out using the FastRNA® Pro Blue Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Q-Biogene, UK). Total
RNA was subjected to DNase treatment using Turbo
DNase (Ambion, UK) and stored at -80°C. RNA integrity
was analyzed visually using denaturing 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and quantified using a NanoDrop
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Reverse transcription
PCR for C10 proteases was performed using the Superscript III One-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen, USA).
Primers used in RT-PCR reactions are documented in
Table 4. Primers were added to a final concentration of
200 nM and 200 ng of total RNA added. As a control for
DNA contamination, RT-PCR minus reactions was set up
where the control reaction only received primers after the
reverse transcriptase step. Aliquots (20 μl from 25 μl) of
all samples were analyzed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis.

Induction of Bfgi1 and Bfgi2 excision from the B. fragilis
638R genome

B. fragilis 638R was grown overnight and then sub-cultured by a 1 in 50 dilution into fresh broth and grown
until late log phase. The culture was then exposed to
either Mitomycin C (0.2 μg/ml), Tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml)
UV light (1 mJ/cm2) then grown for a further 12 hours.
