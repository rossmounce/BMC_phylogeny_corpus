Abstract
Background: Exposure of Medicago truncatula cell suspension cultures to pathogen or wound
signals leads to accumulation of various classes of flavonoid and/or triterpene defense molecules,
orchestrated via a complex signalling network in which transcription factors (TFs) are essential
components.
Results: In this study, we analyzed TFs responding to yeast elicitor (YE) or methyl jasmonate (MJ).
From 502 differentially expressed TFs, WRKY and AP2/EREBP gene families were over-represented
among YE-induced genes whereas Basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) family members were more overrepresented among the MJ-induced genes. Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) transcriptional regulators
were highly induced by MJ treatment. To investigate potential involvement of WRKY TFs in
signalling, we expressed four Medicago WRKY genes in tobacco. Levels of soluble and wall bound
phenolic compounds and lignin were increased in all cases. WRKY W109669 also induced tobacco
endo-1,3-β-glucanase (NtPR2) and enhanced the systemic defense response to tobacco mosaic virus
in transgenic tobacco plants.
Conclusion: These results confirm that Medicago WRKY TFs have broad roles in orchestrating
metabolic responses to biotic stress, and that they also represent potentially valuable reagents for
engineering metabolic changes that impact pathogen resistance.

Background
Terrestrial plants, having a sessile life style, have evolved a
variety of active defense mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens and pests. For example, in
response to pathogen attack the plant can undergo localized hypersensitive cell death associated with synthesis of
antimicrobial molecules termed phytoalexins and a range
of so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins [1-5].
Induction of plant defense responses occurs through a
highly complex signalling network. Transcription factors
(TFs) are essential components of these signalling pathways, by controlling the regulation of expression of genes

encoding PR proteins and enzymes involved in the synthesis of defense-related compounds [6,7].
We recently described how global profiling of transcripts,
associated with metabolic profiling, has revealed details
of the mechanisms underlying the induction and accumulation of various classes of flavonoid and triterpene
defense molecules in cell cultures of the model legume
Medicago truncatula [8-13]. In particular, we have shown
that the mechanisms by which the cells respond to two
different elicitors, the pathogen mimic yeast elicitor (YE)
and the wound signal methyl jasmonate (MJ), differ not

only in the final end products accumulating, but also in
the nature of the underlying signal transduction pathways
[13]. The differences are most likely orchestrated by rapid
induction of different sets/combinations of transcription
factors [5,14-16].
WRKY proteins belong to a large family of transcriptional
regulators which contain the conserved amino acid
sequence WRKYGQK together with a zinc-finger-like
motif [17]. Members of the WRKY TF family are involved
in transcriptional regulation associated with plant
immune responses [18] and development [19]. In the past
decades, significant progress has been made on the characterization of WRKY proteins involved in regulation of
plant defense responses [20]. Over-expression of WRKY
genes in transgenic plants has shown that some are able to
increase the production of PR proteins and to modulate
resistance to phytopathogens [21,22]. Most of these studies have utilized the model crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana.
Few studies have addressed the transcriptional control of
defense-related secondary metabolism in legumes.
We here describe the families of Medicago TFs that are
induced by YE or MJ in cell suspension cultures of the
model legume M. truncatula, with particular focus on
members of the WRKY family. Our results show that different classes of transcriptional regulators are activated by
YE and MJ in Medicago cell cultures, and that heterologous
expression of selected Medicago WRKY proteins in transgenic tobacco enhances typical defense responses such as
PR protein induction and accumulation of soluble and
wall bound phenolic compounds.

Results and discussion
Classes of TFs regulated by YE or MJ in M. truncatula cell
suspension cultures
More than 1,350 TFs have been identified in the M. truncatula genome to date [23], and new classes of plant TFs
are still being discovered [23,24]. To provide a global
analysis of TFs that are transcriptionally regulated by YE or
MJ, we performed transcript profiling using Affymetrix
Medicago arrays to compare 2 h and 24 h elicited samples
to corresponding controls. The array contains over 61,200
probe sets: 32,167 M. truncatula EST/mRNA-based and
chloroplast gene-based probe sets; 18,733 M. truncatula
IMGAG and phase 2/3 BAC prediction-based probe sets;
1,896 M. sativa EST/mRNA-based probe sets; and 8,305
Sinorhizobium meliloti gene prediction-based probe sets.
Genes encoding 502 TFs were differentially expressed in
M. truncatula cell suspension cultures treated with YE or
MJ (Additional file 1). However, the pattern of activation
of TFs by YE or MJ was different (Figure 1A, B). After 2 h
of treatment, 343 TFs were up-regulated by YE, 191 by MJ,
and 125 by both (Figure 1A). At 24 h, the differences
between the two treatments were greater; the number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/132

TFs up-regulated by YE dropped, but MJ up-regulated TFs
increased and only 19 were up-regulated by both treatments (Figure 1B).
TFs are classified based on their DNA-binding motifs. To
investigate which TF classes were regulated by YE or MJ
treatments, we used the recently published legume TF
classification [23]. Figure 1C, D shows the up- and downregulated TFs distributed in annotated classes, not including putative TFs. Five gene families were over-represented
among the up-regulated TFs, namely the AP2/EREBP,
bHLH, MYB, NAC and WRKY families (Figure 1C). AP2/
EREBP and NAC families are specific to plants [25]. WRKY
TF genes were rapidly and highly up-regulated by YE.
Among the 65 YE-induced WRKY probe sets, more than
half were up-regulated at 2 h post-elicitation, with fewer
being more highly expressed than in the controls at 24 h.
MJ induced only 20 and 7 WRKY probe sets at 2 h and 24
h, respectively. Notably, the WRKY most strongly induced
by YE (TC109669; almost 600-fold change) was induced
five times higher than the most strongly MJ-induced
WRKY (TC108267; 115-fold change) (Table 1). A group
of 20 probe sets corresponding to AP2/EREBP gene family
members was up-regulated at 2 h, followed by a strong
reduction in their expression at 24 h of YE treatment. Thirteen and ten AP2/EREBP probe sets were induced by MJ at
2 h and 24 h, respectively. The WRKY TFs were over-represented among the twelve TFs that were most highly upregulated (more than 20-fold) by YE (Table 1).
The Basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) family of eukaryotic
TFs [26] was more pronouncedly over-represented among
the MJ-induced genes. Seven and one bHLH probe sets
were induced at 2 h and 24 h after YE treatment, respectively, and 11 probe sets were up-regulated by MJ at 2 h
and 24 h post-treatment. The bHLH gene family was overrepresented among the ten highest MJ-induced TF genes
(Table 1).
Four gene families, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, HD and MYB, were
over-represented among the down-regulated TFs (Figure
1D). The AP2/EREBP gene family was more over-represented among the genes down-regulated by MJ, with
seven AP2/EREBP probe sets down-regulated by YE at 2 h.
Five and 18 probe sets were down-regulated by MJ at 2 h
and 24 h, respectively. In contrast, the bHLH gene family
was more over-represented among the TFs that were
down-regulated by YE. Fifteen and one bHLH probe sets
were down-regulated by YE, and five and nine were down
regulated by MJ, at 2 h and 24 h respectively.
The mechanism of transcriptional regulation by MJ was
largely unknown until the recent discovery of a novel family of transcriptional regulators called jasmonate ZIMdomain (JAZ) proteins [27-29]. These function as repres-

sors of MJ-regulated transcription in Arabidopsis.JAZ proteins are normally bound to TFs and inhibit their activity.
It has been shown that MYC2 specifically recognizes the
G-box sequence in the promoter of the JAI3 (JAZ) gene
[27]. In response to wounding, jasmonoyl-isoleucine [30]
stabilizes the interaction between the SCFCOI1 (Skip/Cullin/F box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [31,32] and JAZ.
The JAZ proteins are probably modified by ubiquitination
and destroyed by the 26S proteasome [27,28]. Degradation of JAZ repressors liberates the TFs that induce jasmonate-responsive transcriptional changes. Twelve
proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis [27,28].
Homology within this family is confined to two domains,
a 'TIFY' motif that contains the conserved amino acid pattern TIF(F/Y)XG [33], and a carboxy-terminal domain
[27]. Outside these domains the sequence similarity is
weak, and the proteins do not contain any known DNAbinding domain [27]. So far, JAZ proteins have been identified only in plant species [33]. Arabidopsis JAZ genes were

quickly and specifically induced by jasmonate treatment
or constitutively expressed in untreated plants overexpressing MYC2 under control of the 35S promoter [27].
These findings suggest that a negative feedback mechanism may limit the response after initial jasmonate perception [27].
We identified seven genes in M. truncatula, represented by
12 probe sets, corresponding to JAZ proteins that are
strongly induced by MJ (Additional file 2). The probe set
Mtr.20116.1.S1_s_at corresponding to gene 1101.m00011
(IMGAG# AC146572_11) showed a massive 3,187 fold
induction at 2 h after MJ treatment. Transcript analysis of
JAZ 1101.m00010 (AC146572_10) in different naïve M.
truncatula tissues through interrogation of the Medicago
Gene Expression Atlas [34] showed very low expression
(Additional file 3A), suggesting that this gene is specifically regulated by MJ. JAZ proteins share domain similarity with ZIM TFs [27]. Five of the seven JAZ genes

identified in M. truncatula were previously classified as
ZIM family TFs [23] and two genes were not annotated.
The similar response of JAZ genes to MJ in Arabidopsis and
M. truncatula may reflect a conserved mechanism of jasmonate regulation between species.
The best characterized TF in jasmonate signaling is
AtMYC2, which positively regulates genes involved in the
wound response but negatively regulates genes involved
in pathogen defense [14]. ERF1 also differentially regulates these two responses, but with the opposite effect to
that of MYC2 [14,15]. AtMYC2 encodes a nuclear localized helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper bHLH-type transcription factor [14]. As outlined above, M. truncatula TFs of
the bHLH family were highly induced by MJ and downregulated by YE (Additional file 1, Figure 1C, D). The gene
1643.m00042 (AC141862_14) was induced 240-fold at 2
h of MJ treatment (Additional file 1). This gene is likely
induced specifically by MJ, as its expression was extremely
low in naïve M. truncatula tissues and only observed in
roots following nodulation (Additional file 3B).
AC141862_14 showed 33% identity and 56% similarity at
the amino acid level to AtMYC2 (NP_174541). The protein has a nuclear localization signal (ERRRRE), and the
gene may be the M. truncatula ortholog of AtMYC2.

An opposite response to that of bHLH TFs was observed
for the Medicago AP2/EREBP (ethylene responsive) gene
family TFs (Additional file 1, Figure 1C, D). The interplay
between bHLH and AP2/EREBP TF families may explain,
at the molecular level, how plants select the correct
response to pathogen attack or wounding [14].
Selection of Medicago WRKY transcription factors for
expression in transgenic tobacco
Among the five families of significantly over-represented
TFs induced by YE or MJ, the WRKY family predominated
(Figure 1). M. truncatula cells accumulate isoflavonoid
phytoalexins in response to YE [9], and a rapid and massive induction of WRKY TF genes is correlated with the
induction of genes involved in the central phenylpropanoid pathway and the downstream steps in the biosynthesis of the isoflavonoid phytoalexin medicarpin [9,13].
Roles of TFs in plant defense have been demonstrated in
several species including Arabidopsis, tobacco, parsley and
other plants [35-43]. However, no gain- or loss-of-function studies to characterize WRKY proteins from Medicago
species have been reported to date.

In order to investigate the potential involvement of Medicago WRKY TFs in the regulation of the phenylpropanoid

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:132

pathway, we decided to over-express candidate genes in
tobacco. Because of the large amount of redundancy
among transcription factor families, a gain-of-function
approach was chosen as it might be more likely to yield a
detectable phenotype [25,44].
Selection of WRKY TFs was based on the pattern of their
transcriptional induction by YE. The heat map in Figure
2A shows detailed induction kinetics of seven WRKY
genes induced by YE as revealed by oligonucleotide array
analysis. This approach gives lower reproducibility than
the Affymetrix arrays, but allows for analysis of more time

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/132

points due to its much lower cost. Many of the WRKY
genes were rapidly induced by as early as 15 min after
treatment, and their transcript levels were reduced after 2
h post-elicitation. Using the more sensitive Affymetrix
microarray technique, the transcript levels of the WRKY
genes were quantified at 2 h and 24 h after YE or MJ treatment (Figure 2B). The most strongly expressed WRKY,
corresponding to tentative consensus (TC) 109669, was
up-regulated 594-fold in response to YE. The expression
kinetics of several of the WRKY genes, including the one
down-regulated by YE, were confirmed by non-quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 2C) and the results further validated
by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Additional file 4).
On the basis of the above expression patterns, four Medicago WRKY TCs (100577, 100630, 108715 and 109669)
were selected for cloning and transformation into
tobacco. It should be noted that three of these (100577,
100630 and 108715) were not the most strongly induced
according to quantitative Affymetrix data (Table 1); these
WRKYs were selected based on oligonucleotide microarray data before the Affymetrix platform for Medicago was
available. Genomic sequences were available for
W100577 (AC174357_2) and W109669 (CT963079_8).
The second most strongly induced WRKY, TC111875,
might be a splice variant of CT963079_8. The amino acid
sequence of W100630 showed 50% identity to Arabidopsis WRKY6 (NP_564792.1).
Full length cDNA sequences were available for three of the
above genes. The cDNA clone of TC108715 was truncated at
the 5' end, and was completed by RACE PCR. Detailed
descriptions of cloning and Gene Bank accession numbers
are given in Methods. Amplified cDNA products were cloned
into the binary vector pBI121 by replacing the GUS gene.

WRKY gene family members have low sequence similarity
outside the WRKY domain, a 60 amino acid region that is
highly conserved. WRKY proteins are classified into three
distinct groups based on the number of WRKY domains
and differences in their zinc-finger-like motifs [17], and a
functional distinction between the domains has been demonstrated [45,46]. A comparative phylogenetic analysis of
Arabidopsis WRKYs [17] with the selected Medicago genes
showed that W108715 belongs to group I, W100630 to
group IIb, W100577 to group IId, and W109669 to group
III (Additional file 5). Nuclear localization was predicted
for all the selected WRKY proteins with 95% confidence
using the 'LOCtree' bioinformatics tool [47]. Additional file
6 shows transcript analysis of the four WRKY genes in different plant tissues. W100630 (WRKY TC100630) is
expressed in Rhizobium-inoculated roots and at late stages
of seed development (Additional file 6A). W100577 is
expressed relatively highly in all tissues tested, especially in
Rhizobium-inoculated roots (Additional file 6B). W108715

is expressed in petioles, vegetative buds, stems and Rhizobium-inoculated roots (Additional file 6C). Very low,
almost background transcript levels were detected for
W109669 (Additional file 6D), suggesting that this gene is
most likely involved primarily in defense responses,
whereas W100630, W100577 and W108715 are also
expressed during plant development.
Medicago WRKY genes induce phenolic compounds and
lignin in transgenic tobacco
Kanamycin resistant plantlets harboring WRKY expression constructs regenerated from tissue culture were
screened initially by genomic PCR of leaf tissues (data not
shown). Transgenic plants did not show significant visible
phenotypic changes compared with controls. Most of the
transgenic lines showed expression of the transformed
WRKY gene in the leaf tissue, whereas control lines harboring pBI121 did not (typical data are shown for
W109669 in Figure 3). Induction of WRKY TFs was correlated with accumulation of phenolic compounds in elicited M. truncatula cells [9,13]. This suggested examining
phenolic compound profiles in transgenic tobacco plants
expressing Medicago WRKYs. Soluble and wall bound phenolic compounds were therefore extracted from control
and WRKY-expressing transgenic tobacco lines, and the
extracts analyzed by HPLC. Rutin and kaempferol-3-Oglucoside were present at higher levels in the soluble fraction from plants expressing any of the four WRKY genes
than in controls (Figure 4A, C), by more than 2-3-fold for
rutin and 3-6-fold for kaempferol-3-O-glucoside.

A number of TFs involved in the regulation of flavonoid
production have been isolated and reported previously.
Generally, these belong to either MYB or the basic helixloop-helix, MYC-type families [48,49]. In most studies,
co-action of members belonging to both of these gene
families was required for the production of anthocyanins
in the plant [49-54]. Expression of the maize LC (MYCtype) and C1 (MYB-type) genes in the fruit of transgenic

tomatoes resulted in a strong accumulation of kaempferol
glucoside, but not in the accumulation of anthocyanins, a
finding that was explained by insufficient expression of
the gene encoding flavanone-3',5'-hydroxylase [55].
Induction of WRKY TFs by YE in M. truncatula cells correlates with accumulation of the isoflavonoid medicarpin
[9,13]. Tobacco does not possess a fully functional isoflavonoid pathway, and ectopic expression of Medicago
WRKYs in transgenic tobacco shifts the metabolic flux into
the accumulation of biosynthetically related flavonol glucosides instead (Additional file 7). The roles of flavonoids
in stress- and pathogen-protection are still under investigation, but flavonols may be among the most important
flavonoids in this regard [56]. A kaempferol triglucoside
was isolated from carnation stems and roots, and was suggested to be an active phytoalexin against the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi [57].
The level of wall bound caffeic acid increased in transgenic
tobacco lines expressing three of the four WRKY genes
(Figure 4B, D), by more than 4-fold in lines expressing
W100630 and W108715. Increased levels of caffeic acid
were correlated with increased lignin content, as determined by the acetyl bromide method, in these lines (Figure 5). Elevated lignin accumulation was previously
reported in transgenic rice lines over-expressing
OsWRKY89 [40], and has also been shown in M. truncatula suspension cells in response to YE, but not MJ (Lei, Z
at al. unpublished results). Induced lignification is one of
several plant defense responses to pathogen attack and
wounding [58-61]. Transgenic rice over-expressing
OsWRKY89 also showed enhanced ultraviolet tolerance
and disease resistance, suggesting that OsWRKY89 plays
an important role in responses to biotic and abiotic stress.
Our similar results from transgenic tobacco plants
expressing Medicago WRKYs suggest that these TFs have
broad roles in orchestrating metabolic responses that
impact stress tolerance.
Induction of lignin biosynthetic genes in M. truncatula
Affymetrix microarray analysis showed that several genes
encoding enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis were
induced in M. truncatula cells exposed to YE or MJ (Additional file 8). Most of the probe sets representing lignin
pathway genes were up-regulated at 2 h of YE treatment
(Additional file 8). Two cytochrome P450 enzymes, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) [62,63] and coumarate 3hydroxylase (C3H) [62,63], as well as hydroxycinnamoyl
CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT)
[64], caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), were induced by
YE, but not by MJ. Caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase
(CCoAOMT) and three probe sets representing cinnamoyl
Coenzyme A reductase (CCR) were up-regulated by both
YE and MJ, but induction by YE was higher. All ferulate 5Page 6 of 14

Levels of phenolic compounds in transgenic tobacco lines expressing Medicago WRKYs

hydroxylase (F5H) probe sets showed high expression at
later time points after MJ treatment, and two showed
delayed induction by YE. One of the probe sets,
iMsa.1740, showed 98% nucleotide identity to the functionally characterized F5H-K10 of alfalfa [62,63]. F5H catalyzes hydroxylation at the C5 position of coniferaldehyde
and coniferyl alcohol in S monolignol biosynthesis [65],
and down-regulation of F5H significantly reduced the
yield of syringyl monomers in transgenic alfalfa lines [62].
However, lignin accumulation was not observed in MJ
treated M. truncatula cells [66].
Laccases and peroxidases are involved in dehydrogenative
polymerization of monolignols into lignin [65]. Five
probe sets of genes encoding laccases were induced by YE

at 2 h of treatment, and one set was also induced by MJ
(Additional file 8). From 49 probe sets of putative peroxidases, 32 were up-regulated by YE and 16 by MJ. The correlation of WRKY TFs with activation of lignin
biosynthetic genes and increased levels of lignin in M.
truncatula cells, coupled with their ability to induce lignin
in transgenic tobacco, suggests involvement of WRKY TFs
in induced lignification responses.

associated with viral-induced necrosis in tobacco [71],
and suppression of PAL compromised systemic resistance
in tobacco plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) [67]. Tobacco may have four PAL genes, which
appear to be expressed in most tissue types [72-75].
Expression of PAL3 [75] was not altered from control levels in tobacco lines expressing Medicago WRKY genes (data
not shown). Other PAL genes might therefore be involved
in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in tobacco
expressing Medicago WRKY genes.
Salicylic acid (SA) is a signal molecule in the establishment of both local and systemic acquired resistance (SAR)
in tobacco [76]. Plants expressing a bacterial salicylate
hydroxylase gene demonstrated no accumulation of
pathogenesis-related (PR) gene 1 transcripts [77], suggesting
that PR1 expression is dependent on production of SA.
Rather than directly measuring SA levels in tobacco
expressing Medicago WRKY genes, we determined the levels of NtNPR1 [78] and NtPR2 [79] transcripts. Differences in NtNPR1 transcript levels were not detected in any
plants expressing any of the WRKY genes. However,
NtPR2 was constitutively expressed in transgenic plants
expressing W109669 (Figure 3). NtPR2 is an acidic, extracellular, endo-1,3-β-glucanase) [79]. A defensive role for
β-1,3-glucanases in plants has been suggested by the
observation that β-1,3-glucanases and chitinases are coordinately induced in response to pathogens [79]. β-1,3Glucans are important structural components of fungal
cell walls, and in vitro evidence shows that β-1,3-glucanase
in combination with chitinase has a direct fungicidal
action on some phytopathogenic fungi [80]. β-1,3-Glucanases may also act indirectly by releasing elicitors from

Because W109669 induces NtPR2 transcripts in tobacco, we
examined systemic disease resistance of transgenic plants
expressing either W109669 or W108715 (which does not
induce NtPR2) by inoculation with tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) U1 strain. Plants were pre-inoculated with virus on
the lower leaves, and secondary inoculations were performed on upper leaves five days later. As shown in Additional file 9, the sizes of the secondary lesions formed in
W109669 expressing lines were much smaller than in controls or in lines expressing the other WRKY genes, indicating
that W109669 enhanced SAR in tobacco.
The observation that ectopic expression of any one of four
WRKY TFs promoted increased levels of flavonols in
tobacco, that three out of the four also induced caffeic acid
levels, and that some, but not all, induce SAR raises questions as to whether these results reflect functional redundancy among family members, or simply non-specific
effects due to high level ectopic expression in a heterologous species. Functional redundancy is common not only
for TFs [44,82]. For example, when 86% of the 19,427
predicted Caenorhabditis elegans genes were knocked
down, only 10% of the resulting mutants exhibited any
phenotype [83]. For more then 40 Arabidopsis WRKY
knock-down mutants, phenotypes were rarely observed
[82]. However, it is clear that WRKY TFs are crucial regulators of defense responses in Arabidopsis. For example
AtWRKY53 was identified as a positive regulator, and
AtWRKY58 as negative regulator, of SAR [84]. AtWRKY70
has been shown to play an important role in determining
the balance between SA-dependent and JA-dependent
defense pathways [21,85]. Ectopic expression of TFs at
high level may have pleiotropic effects [86]. For example,
expression of the Arabidopsis MYB transcription factor,
TT2, in Medicago hairy roots resulted in up-regulation of
over 400 probesets [87]. Only 45 of them overlapped with
probesets preferentially expressed in M. truncatula seed
coat, the organ in which TT2 is naturally expressed, indicating that a large number of genes were non-specifically
up-regulated by TT2. However, massive accumulation of
proanthocyanidins was observed in the hairy roots
expressing TT2 [87], confirmed the potential of using TFs
for metabolic engineering.
Although ectopic over-expression of four Medicago WRKYs
in tobacco led to similar chemical phenotypes, only
W109669 induced PR2 expression and enhanced SAR.
Thus, ectopic over-expression in a heterologous system
can reveal differences between WRKYs in relation to the
expression of defense-associated marker genes and the
response to certain pathogens. These are useful observations from a biotechnology perspective, but do not of
themselves indicate precise functions for these genes in M.

truncatula. Analysis of recently available M. truncatula
Tnt1 retrotransposon insertion lines [88] may provide a
loss-of-function approach to address this issue. Irrespective of considerations of in vivo function, the fact that
ectopic expression of Medicago WRKY genes increases the
levels of phenolic compounds and lignin in tobacco highlights the value of such genes for engineering improved
chemical defenses or increasing levels of health-beneficial
antioxidant polyphenols in agricultural crops.

Conclusion
Challenging M. truncatula cell suspension cultures with YE
or MJ leads to accumulation of various classes of flavonoid or triterpene defense molecules. Complex signal
transduction network controls such processes, of which
TFs are essential components as master regulatory proteins controlling the transcriptional cascade. We have
observed opposite regulation of AP2/EREBP and bHLH TF
families in response to YE or MJ that may explain, at the
molecular level, how plants select the correct response to
pathogen attack or wounding. Strong induction of WRKY
TFs by YE suggests that they may have a role in signaling
in response to this pathogen mimic. Expression of four
Medicago WRKY TF genes in transgenic tobacco increased
phenolic compounds and lignin, suggesting that these TFs
have broad roles in orchestrating metabolic responses
implicated in biotic stress tolerance. Expression of
W109669 in transgenic tobacco enhanced viral tolerance,
suggesting a potential role of this TF in triggering an additional genetic cascade for disease resistance independent
of lignin and phenolic production.

Methods
Plant Material
Details of the initiation and elicitation of M. truncatula
Gaerth 'Jemalong' (line A17) cell suspension cultures
have been provided elsewhere [9,11,13]. Transgenic
plants of N. tabacum cv Xanthi NN were grown in 4.5 inch
diameter pots containing "Professional blend" soil (Sun
Gro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA) at a temperature of
20°C/19°C (day/night). Plants were fertilized at time of
watering using a commercial fertilizer mix (Peters Professional 20-10-20 (N-P-K) General Purpose, The Scotts
Company, Marysville, OH).
Gene constructs and plant transformation
Sequences of full length cDNA clones representing WRKY
genes can be accessed in GenBank, accession numbers:
W100577 – EU526033, W100630 – EU526034, W108715
– EU526035, and W109669 – EU526036. Full length
cDNA clones were available for W100577, W100630, and
W10966. The cDNA clone of W108715 was truncated at
its 5' end; this part of the sequence was recovered by
RACE-PCR using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences Clontech Inc., Palo Alto, CA)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/132

according to the manufacturer's protocol. WRKY genes
were cloned, by PCR using primers with a BamHI site at
the 5'-end and a SacI site at the 3'-end (Additional file 10),
into the BamHI/SacI sites of the binary vector pBI121 (GB
Accession AF485783) [89] to replace the GUS gene.
The binary vector constructs including pBI121 as negative
control were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain C58C1 by electroporation. Agrobacteria harboring
the plasmid were confirmed by colony PCR and used for
transformation of N. tabacum cv Xanthi NN. Leaf disc
transformation of tobacco was performed as previously
described [90].
RNA isolation and non-quantitative and semi-quantitative
RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 0.5 g of frozen, ground tissue
of M. truncatula suspension cells or N. tabacum leaves
using 5 ml of Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center,
Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Three μg of total RNA was used in a first strand synthesis
using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR Beads (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Pittsburgh, PA) in a 50 μl reaction with
oligo-dT primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μl of the first strand reaction was then PCR
amplified for 30 cycles at 68°C annealing temperature
using Takara Ex Taq (Fisher Scientific Company, Palatine,
IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR
products were analyzed on an agarose gel.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a Quantum RNA 18S internal standard kit (Ambion Inc., Austin,
TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each RT-PCR
reaction was repeated with three independent biological
replicates. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel
and stained with Syber Green (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad,
CA). The fluorescence signal was captured using a UVP Bioimaging system (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). Analysis of signal
intensity of products was performed with Image Quant TL
software (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Data
were normalized according to 18S internal standard.
The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in RT-PCR
experiments are given in Additional file 11.
Microarray analysis
DNA microarray analysis was performed utilizing oligonucleotide microarrays representing 16,086 TC sequences
and Affymetrix Medicago genome arrays with 61,000
probe sets as described previously [9,13]. For the oligonucleotide arrays, a reference design was employed in which
all RNA samples for both control and elicited cells were
compared to RNA from a separate batch of non-elicited
cells. Three biological replicates were used. The Amino
Allyl cDNA Labelling Kit (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX) was

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:132

used to label 25 μg of total RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. Cy3 dye (Amersham Biosciences Corp,
Piscataway, NJ) was used for labelling the reference RNA
and Cy5 for the experimental samples. The arrays were
read with a ScanArray 4000 scanner (Packard, Palo Alto,
CA) at 10 μm resolution and variable photomultiplier
tube voltage settings to obtain maximal signal intensities.
The fluorescence intensity for each flour and each element
on the array was captured using GenePix Pro 4.1 (Axon,
Union City, CA). Normalization of Cy3 and Cy5 signal
was performed by adjusting the signal intensities of the
two images using the Lowess (sub-grid) method of the
GeneTraffic software, and the local background was subtracted from the values of each spot on the array. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) of normalized data was performed
using GeneSpring software as described previously [9].

Additional material
For experiments using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Medicago
Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), RNA samples
were prepared from cells exposed to YE or MJ for 2 h or 24 h,
along with the corresponding unelicited controls. Two biological replicates, with analytical duplicates, were used for
minimal statistical treatment, and mean values for each treatment were divided by the corresponding control baseline
values. Full details of the experimental procedures and statistical analysis have been presented elsewhere [13].
The complete Affymetrix dataset is publicly available at
ArrayExpresss [91], and the oligo array data are available
via the DOME database at the Virginia Bioinformatics
Institute [92].
Analysis of phenylpropanoid compounds
Tobacco leaves (1 g fresh weight) were ground in liquid
N2. Extraction of soluble and wall bound phenolic compounds were as described previously [93,94]. Separation
and quantification of phenolic compounds were as
described previously [94].
Determination of lignin content
Lignin content of transgenic tobacco leaves was determined by the acetyl bromide method using ~30 mg
extractive-free material [95,96]. A molar extinction coefficient of 17.2 [95] was used for samples from all the control and transgenic lines.
Tobacco mosaic virus inoculation
Purified TMV U1 strain was mechanically inoculated onto
leaves of tobacco plants at the 10 leaf stage using carborundum powder (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The lower leaves
were inoculated with 100 μl per leaf of TMV solution
(1.27 ng/μl). Five days later, when the local lesions
appeared on the lower leaves, the upper leaves were inoculated with the TMV solution and the resulting lesions
measured 4–5 days after the secondary inoculation.
