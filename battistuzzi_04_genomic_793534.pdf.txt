Abstract
Background: The timescale of prokaryote evolution has been difficult to reconstruct because of
a limited fossil record and complexities associated with molecular clocks and deep divergences.
However, the relatively large number of genome sequences currently available has provided a
better opportunity to control for potential biases such as horizontal gene transfer and rate
differences among lineages. We assembled a data set of sequences from 32 proteins (~7600 amino
acids) common to 72 species and estimated phylogenetic relationships and divergence times with
a local clock method.
Results: Our phylogenetic results support most of the currently recognized higher-level groupings
of prokaryotes. Of particular interest is a well-supported group of three major lineages of
eubacteria (Actinobacteria, Deinococcus, and Cyanobacteria) that we call Terrabacteria and
associate with an early colonization of land. Divergence time estimates for the major groups of
eubacteria are between 2.5–3.2 billion years ago (Ga) while those for archaebacteria are mostly
between 3.1–4.1 Ga. The time estimates suggest a Hadean origin of life (prior to 4.1 Ga), an early
origin of methanogenesis (3.8–4.1 Ga), an origin of anaerobic methanotrophy after 3.1 Ga, an origin
of phototrophy prior to 3.2 Ga, an early colonization of land 2.8–3.1 Ga, and an origin of aerobic
methanotrophy 2.5–2.8 Ga.
Conclusions: Our early time estimates for methanogenesis support the consideration of methane,
in addition to carbon dioxide, as a greenhouse gas responsible for the early warming of the Earths'
surface. Our divergence times for the origin of anaerobic methanotrophy are compatible with
highly depleted carbon isotopic values found in rocks dated 2.8–2.6 Ga. An early origin of
phototrophy is consistent with the earliest bacterial mats and structures identified as stromatolites,
but a 2.6 Ga origin of cyanobacteria suggests that those Archean structures, if biologically
produced, were made by anoxygenic photosynthesizers. The resistance to desiccation of
Terrabacteria and their elaboration of photoprotective compounds suggests that the common
ancestor of this group inhabited land. If true, then oxygenic photosynthesis may owe its origin to
terrestrial adaptations.

Background
The evolutionary history of prokaryotes includes both
horizontal and vertical inheritance of genes [1-3]. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events are of great interest in
themselves, for their roles in creating functionally new
combinations of genes [4], but they pose problems for
investigating the phylogenetic history and divergence
times of organisms. The existence of a core of genes that
has not been transferred is still under debate as HGTs have
been detected in genes previously considered to be
immune to these events [2,5-11]. Although a complete
absence of HGT appears to be unlikely, genes belonging to
different functional categories seem to be horizontally
transferred with different frequencies [11-13]. Genes
forming complex interactions with other cellular components (e.g. translational proteins) have a lower frequency
of HGT and are generally more conserved among organisms. Recent studies based on analyses of these genes have
obtained similar phylogenies suggesting an underlying
phylogenetic signal [3,14-17]. If we accept the use of core
genes for phylogeny reconstruction then they should also
be of use for time estimation with molecular clocks. Moreover the increasing number of prokaryotic genomes available has facilitated the detection of HGT through more
accurate detection of orthology, paralogy, and monophyletic groups, and the concatenation of gene and protein sequences has helped increase the confidence of
nodes and decrease the variance of time estimates
[14,16,18,19].
Temporal information concerning prokaryote evolution
has come from diverse sources. For eukaryotes, the fossil
record provides an abundant source of such data, but this
has not been true for prokaryotes, which are difficult to
identify as fossils [20,21]. Limited information on specific
groups or metabolites has been obtained from analyses of
isotopic concentrations [22] and detection of biomarkers
[23,24]. By making some simple assumptions – e.g., that
aerobic organisms evolved after oxygen became available
[25]- it is possible to constrain some nodes in the prokaryote timescale, but only in a coarse sense. However, most
information on the timescale of prokaryote evolution has
come from analysis of DNA and amino acid sequence
data with molecular clocks [26-30]. The detection of evolutionary patterns in metabolic innovations, as a consequence of a phylogeny not dominated by HGT events,
allows more detailed constraints on a prokaryote
timescale.
In contrast to conventional interpretations of cyanobacteria as being among the most ancient of life forms on Earth
[31], these studies have consistently found a late origin of
cyanobacteria [28,30], nearly contemporaneous with the
major Proterozoic rise in oxygen at 2.3 billion years ago
(Ga), termed the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) [32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/44

In this study we have assembled a data set of amino acid
sequences from 32 proteins common to 72 species of
prokaryotes and eukaryotes and estimated phylogenetic
relationships and divergence times with a local clock
method. These results in turn have been used to investigate the origin of metabolic pathways of importance in
evolution of the biosphere.

Results
Data set
The majority (81%) of the 32 proteins that were used are
classified in the "information storage and processes" functional category of the COG. The other categories represented are "cellular processes" (10%), "metabolism"
(3%), and "information storage and processing" +
"metabolism" (proteins with combined functions; 6%).
Other studies that have analyzed prokaryote genome
sequence data for phylogeny have found a similar high
proportion of proteins in the "information storage and
processes" functional category, presumably because HGT
is more difficult with such genes that are vital for the survival of the cell [3,18,33,34].

The concatenated and aligned data set of 32 proteins contained 27,205 amino acid sites (including insertions and
deletions). With alignment gaps removed, the two data
sets analyzed were 7,338 amino acid sites (Archaebacteria) and 7,597 amino acid sites (Eubacteria). The data sets
were complete in the sense that sequences of all taxa were
present for all proteins.
Phylogeny
The phylogeny of eubacteria (Fig. 1) shows significant
bootstrap support for most of the major groups and subgroups. All proteobacteria form a monophyletic group
(support values 95/47/99 for ME, ML and Bayesian
respectively) with the following relationships of the subgroups: (epsilon (alpha (beta, gamma))). There has been
debate about the effect of base composition and substitution rate on the phylogenetic position of the endosymbiont Buchnera among γ-proteobacteria [35,36]. Its position
here (Fig. 1) differs slightly from both studies; accordingly, any conclusions concerning its divergence time
should be treated with caution. Spirochaetes cluster with
Chlamydiae, Actinobacteria with Cyanobacteria and Deinococcus (support values for Cyanobacteria + Deinococcus
are 92/80/99) and the hyperthermophiles (Thermotoga,
Aquifex) branch basally in the tree. These groups and relationships are similar to those found previously with analyses of prokaryote genome sequences [3,18,33,34].

The phylogeny of archaebacteria (Fig. 2) agrees with some
but not all aspects of previous phylogenetic analyses of
prokaryote

[37,39-41]. For example, each of the two major clades of
Archaebacteria (excluding Korarchaeota, which was not
represented) is monophyletic. This is consistent with
some analyses [14,18] but not others [3]. Also, the position of Crenarchaeota as closest relatives of eukaryotes
(Fig. 2), instead of Euryarchaeota, has been debated
[14,18,30,42,43]. The faster rate of evolution in eukaryotes (Fig. 2), as noted elsewhere [30,44], requires some caution in drawing conclusions regarding their phylogenetic
position. Methanogens were found to be monophyletic in
some previous analyses [3,41] but were paraphyletic in
other analyses [38,45,46] and in our analysis (Fig. 2). The
phylogenetic position of one species of methanogen in
particular, Methanopyrus kandleri, has differed among previous studies [47-49]. However, it is difficult to make
direct comparisons among various studies because they
have included different sets of taxa.
Time estimation
Times of divergence were estimated for all nodes in the
phylogenies of eubacteria (Fig. 1) and archaebacteria (Fig.

2) using the alternative constraints (calibrations)
described in the Methods. The eubacteria time estimates
show an average 7% increase from the molecular to the
geologic (2.3 Ga minimum) calibration point. Two other
additional geologic calibration points were used in the
analyses (see Methods), 2.3 Ga fixed and 2.7 Ga minimum, which showed respectively 10% younger and 11%
older time estimates compared with the 2.3 Ga minimum
calibration point.
The times estimated with the fossil calibration point in the
archaebacteria data set were on average only 10% younger
than the ones estimated with the molecular calibration.
Moreover there was even a smaller effect on the time estimates of the deepest nodes, which were the ones of interest in this study (node M 3.2%, node N 2.1%, node O
1.8% and node P 1.3%). This variation is due not only to
the different calibration times but also to the type of constraints used (i.e. minimum boundaries only vs. minimum and maximum bounds).

A single timetree (Fig. 3) was constructed from the phylogenetic and divergence time data. The time estimates summarized in that tree derive only from the best-justified
calibrations. For eubacteria, the 2.3 Ga minimum calibration (constraint), from the geologic record, was chosen
because it encompasses all of the hypothesized time estimates for the origin of cyanobacteria. For archaebacteria,
the 1.2 Ga calibration (minimum 1.174 Ga, maximum
1.222 Ga), from the red algae fossil record, was selected
because it provides a conservative constraint on the divergence of plants and animals. Time estimates and 95% credibility intervals for all nodes under all calibrations are
presented elsewhere [see Additional file 1, Additional file 2,
and Additional file 3], and those data are summarized for
selected nodes and calibrations for eubacteria and archaebacteria (Table 1). Although some undetected HGT could
be a source of bias in the time estimates, the direction of the
bias (raising or lowering the estimate) would depend on
the specific node and groups involved, and it is unlikely to
have had a major affect on the results, even if present.
Divergence times within eubacteria (Fig. 3, Table 1, nodes
A-K) show a pattern seen previously [30] whereby most
major groups diverge from one another (nodes B-I excluding node D) in a relatively limited time interval, approximately between 2.5–3.2 Ga. The position of the
hyperthermophiles has been debated, with some studies
showing them in a basal position whereas others place
them more derived. The high G-C composition of these
taxa is believed to be responsible for this difficulty in phylogenetic placement. Here, they branch basally (node J,
3.17–4.13 Ga and node K, 3.43–4.46 Ga), but this should
be interpreted with caution for this reason. The divergence
of Escherichia coli from Salmonella typhimurium (Fig. 3, Table
1, node A; 0.06–0.18 Ga) is consistent with the time estimated previously from consideration of mammalian host
evolution (0.12–0.16 Ga) [26]. On the other hand an
inconsistency with the fossil record is represented by the
divergence of unicellular (Thermosynechococcus elongatus)
and heterocyst-forming (Nostoc sp.) cyanobacteria. Our
time estimate for this divergence is 0.70–1.41 Ga (Fig. 3,
Table 1, node D) while microfossils of both groups have
been identified in Mesoproterozoic (1.5–1.3 Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (2.12–2.02 Ga) rocks [50-52]. However the
identification of these latter fossils has been debated [51].
Branch lengths of cyanobacteria in our protein tree and in
16S ribosomal RNA trees [34] do not suggest obvious substitutional biases or rate changes as they are neither unusually long nor unusually short. The reason for the
discrepancy between the molecular and fossil times
remains unclear but a possible misinterpretation of the fossil record cannot be dismissed.
Divergence times of most internal nodes among archaebacteria (Fig. 3, Table 1, nodes L-P) are closely spaced in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/44

time and relatively ancient, approximately between 3.1–
4.1 Ga, regardless of the initial setting (prior) for the
ingroup root. Node P is the earliest divergence, separating
Euryarchaeota from Crenarchaeota+eukaryotes. Node O
represents the common ancestor of the methanogens in
our analysis (Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanothermobacter
thermoautotrophicus, Methanococcus jannaschii, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanosarcina mazei and M. acetivorans).
Therefore, methanogenesis presumably arose between
nodes P and O, or between 4.11 Ga (3.31–4.49 Ga) and
3.78 Ga (3.05–4.16 Ga) (Fig. 3, Table 1). If the position of
Methanopyrus kandleri is not considered, in lieu of the current debate concerning its relationships (noted above),
node N (Fig. 3, Table 1), the minimum time for the origin
of methanogenesis drops only slightly, from 3.78 Ga
(3.05–4.16 Ga) to 3.57 Ga (2.88–3.95 Ga).

Discussion
Origin of life on Earth
Neither the time for the origin of life, nor the divergence
of archaebacteria and eubacteria, was estimated directly in
this study. Nonetheless, one divergence within archaebacteria was estimated to be as old as 4.11 Ga (Node P), suggesting even earlier dates for the last common ancestor of
living organisms and the origin of life. This is in agreement with previous molecular clock analyses using mostly
different data sets and methodology [28,30]. A Hadean
(4.5–4.0 Ga) origin for life on Earth is also consistent with
the early establishment of a hydrosphere [31,53]. Nevertheless, the earliest geologic and fossil evidence for life has
been debated [21,54-59] leaving no direct support for
such old time estimates.
Methanogenesis
The lower luminosity of the sun during the Hadean and
Archean predicts that surface water would have been frozen during that time. Instead there is evidence of liquid
water and moderate to high surface temperatures [60,61].
The long term carbon cycle (carbonate-silicate cycle),
which acts as a temperature buffer, combined with greenhouse gases, probably explain this "Faint Young Sun Paradox" [61]. Arguments have been made in support of
either methane [62-64] or carbon dioxide [65] as the
major greenhouse gas involved. If methane was important, it would have necessarily come from organisms
(methanogens), given the volume required.

Archaebacteria are the only prokaryotes known to produce methane. Our time estimate of between 4.11 Ga
(3.31–4.49 Ga) and 3.78 Ga (3.05–4.16 Ga) for the origin
of methanogenesis suggests that methanogens were
present on Earth during the Archean, consistent with the
methane greenhouse theory [64]. Nonetheless, this does
not rule out the alternative (carbon dioxide) explanation
[65].

Anaerobic methanotrophy
Anaerobic methanotrophy, or anaerobic oxidation of
methane (AOM), is a metabolism associated with anoxic
marine sediments rich in methane. This metabolism is
characterized by the coupling of two reactions, oxidation
of methane and sulfate reduction. The methane oxidizers
are represented by archaebacteria phylogenetically related
to the Methanosarcinales, while the sulfate reducers,
when present, are eubacterial members of the δ-proteobacteria division [66]. These two groups of prokaryotes
have been found associated in syntrophies, thus suggesting the coupling of these two pathways [66-69]. Archaebacteria have been found also isolated in monospecific
clusters, oxidizing methane through an unknown reaction. It has been suggested that they may use elements of
both the methanogenesis and sulfate-reducing pathways
[70]. An example of coexistence of genes from both of
these pathways is Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The particular
condition of this archaebacterium has been explained
with an ancient horizontal gene transfer from an eubacterial lineage, most likely a δ-proteobacterium [71,72].

The phylogenetic position of the anaerobic methanotrophs with the Methanosarcinales places the maximum
date for the origin of this metabolism at 3.09 (2.47–3.51)
Ga (Fig. 3, Table 1, node M). The minimum time estimate

of 0.23 Ga (0.12–0.39 Ga) (Fig. 3, Table 1, node L), probably a substantial underestimate of the true time, results
from the limited phylogenetic sampling available for this
group.
Aerobic methanotrophy
Aerobic methanotrophs are represented in the α and γ
divisions of the proteobacteria. This suggests an origin for
this metabolism between node C (2.80 Ga; 2.45–3.22 Ga)
and node B (2.51 Ga; 2.15–2.93 Ga) (Fig. 3, Table 1).
Shared genes from this pathway and from methanogenesis also have been found in the Planctomycetales [73].
This has suggested a revision of the direction of the HGT,
usually considered from archaebacteria to eubacteria [1],
that presumably has spread these genes in the two
domains. However the absence of Planctomycetales from
our dataset and its controversial phylogenetic position
[74] does not allow us to discriminate among these
possibilities.

Both anaerobic and aerobic methanotrophy have been
used to explain the highly depleted carbon isotopic values
found in 2.8–2.6 Ga geologic formations [22,75]. Our
time estimates for these two metabolisms are both compatible with the isotopic record. Molecular clock methods
have estimated the origin of cyanobacteria at 2.56 Ga
(2.04–3.08 Ga) [30]. Because oxygenic photosynthesis
would have been necessary for aerobic methanotrophy
[75], an anaerobic metabolism seems more likely to
explain the isotopic record.
Phototrophy
The ability to utilize light as an energy source (phototrophy, photosynthesis) is restricted to eubacteria among
prokaryotes. Phototrophic eubacteria are found in five
major phyla (groups), including proteobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, green filamentous bacteria, gram positive
heliobacteria, and cyanobacteria [4,76]. Only cyanobacteria produce oxygen.

There are three explanations for this broad taxonomic distribution of phototrophic metabolism; it evolved in one
lineage of eubacteria and spread at a later time to other
lineages by horizontal transfer, the common ancestor of
these groups possessed this metabolism and genetic
machinery, or there was a combination of horizontal
transfer and vertical inheritance [4]. Because two of the
three explanations require a phototrophic common
ancestor, and because some features of the Archean geologic record require this metabolism if biologically produced [77], we have assumed here that the common
ancestor (Node I) was phototrophic.
Therefore, we estimate that phototrophy evolved prior to
3.19 (2.80–3.63) Ga (Fig. 3, Table 1, node I). Because the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:44

hyperthermophiles Aquifex and Thermotoga are not phototrophic and branch more basally, 3.64 (3.17–4.13) Ga
(Node J) can be considered a maximum date for phototrophy. However, if those hyperthermophiles instead occupy
a more derived position on the tree, as some analyses have
indicated [33], then the maximum date is no longer constrained in this analysis.
The colonization of land
The evolution of phototrophy was most likely linked to
the evolution of other features essential to survival in
stressful environments. Considerable biological damage
can occur from exposure to ultraviolet radiation, especially prior to the GOE and later formation of the protective ozone layer [78]. The synthesis of pigments such as
carotenoids, which function as photoprotective compounds against the reactive oxygen species created by UV
radiation [79], is an ability present in all the photosynthetic eubacteria and in groups that are partly or mostly
associated with terrestrial habitats such as the actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and Deinococcus-Thermus.

Pigmentation was probably a fundamental step in the colonization of surface environments [80]. Besides the sharing of photoprotective compounds, these three groups
(cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and Deinococcus) also
share a high resistance to dehydration [81-84], which further suggests that their common ancestor was adapted to
land environments. Therefore we propose the name Terrabacteria (L. terra, land or earth) for the group that includes
the bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and
Deinococcus-Thermus. An early colonization of land is
inferred to have occurred after the divergence of this terrestrial lineage with Firmicutes (Fig. 3, Table 1, node H),
3.05 (2.70–3.49) Ga, and prior to the divergence of Actinobacteria with Cyanobacteria + Deinococcus (Fig. 3, Table
1, node F), 2.78 (2.49–3.20) Ga. These molecular time
estimates are compatible with time estimates (2.6–2.7
Ga) based on geological evidence for the earliest colonization of land by organisms (prokaryotes) [85]. Many
groups of prokaryotes currently inhabit terrestrial environments, indicating that land has been colonized multiple times in different lineages.
Oxygenic photosynthesis
From the above analyses and discussion, some of the early
steps leading to oxygenic photosynthesis apparently were
acquisition of protective pigments, phototrophy, and the
colonization of land. Currently, hundreds of terrestrial
species of cyanobacteria are known, broadly distributed
among the orders, with species occurring in some of the
driest environments on Earth. It is possible that a terrestrial ancestry of cyanobacteria, where stresses resulting
from desiccation and solar radiation were severe, may
have played a part in the evolution of oxygenic photosyn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/44

thesis. Nonetheless, there is ample evidence that horizontal gene transfer also has played an important role in the
assembly of photosynthetic machinery [4].
Although we have used the origin of cyanobacteria as a
calibration (2.3 Ga, geologic time based on GOE), such
minimum constraints permit the estimated time to be
much older in a Bayesian analysis. However, in this case,
the time estimated for node E (2.56 Ga; 2.31–2.97 Ga; Fig.
3, Table 1) was not much older than the constraint itself.
It also agrees with an earlier molecular time estimate (2.56
Ga; 2.04–3.08 Ga) based on a largely different data set
and methods [30]. When we used the older minimum
constraint of 2.7 Ga, corresponding to 2α-methyl-hopane
evidence considered to represent a biomarker of cyanobacteria [86], the estimated time was likewise only slightly
older [see Additional file 1]. The oldest time estimates for
oxygenic photosynthesis that we obtained are still considerable younger than has been assumed – generally – in the
geologic literature [31,32,87]. This suggests that carbon
isotope excursions, microfossils, microbial mats, stromatolites, and other pre-3 Ga evidence ascribed to cyanobacteria should be re-evaluated.

Conclusions
The analyses presented here are based on the assumption,
still under debate, that historical information (phylogenies and divergence times) can be retrieved from genes in
the prokaryote genome that have not been affected by
horizontal gene transfer. Our prokaryotic timeline shows
deep divergences within both the eubacterial and
archaebacterial domains indicating a long evolutionary
history. The early evolution of life (>4.1 Ga) and early origin of several important metabolic pathways (phototrophy, methanogenesis; but not oxygenic photosynthesis)
suggests that organisms have influenced the Earth's environment since early in the history of the planet (Fig. 4).
An inferred early presence of methanogens (3.8–4.1 Ga)
is consistent with models suggesting that methane was
important in keeping the Earth's surface warm in the
Archean but does not rule out the possibility that carbon
dioxide may have been equally (or more) important. In
contrast to many classical interpretations of the early evolution of life, we find no compelling evidence for a pre-3
Ga evolution of cyanobacteria and oxygenic photosynthesis. This unique metabolism apparently evolved relatively
late in the radiation of eubacterial clades, shortly before
the Great Oxidation event (~2.3 Ga). The evolution of
oxygenic photosynthesis may have involved a combination of adaptations to stressful terrestrial environments as
well as acquisition of genes through horizontal transfer.

Methods
Data assembly
We assembled a dataset that maximized the number of
taxa and proteins from available organisms with complete
genome sequences of prokaryotes and selected eukaryotes. In doing so, we omitted a few taxa (e.g., Agrobacterium
tumefaciens Cereon str C58 and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1)
whose addition to the data set would have resulted in a
substantial reduction in the total number of proteins.
Data assembly began with the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of Proteins (COG) [88], which consisted of 84
proteins common to 43 species. With that initial dataset
we added other species from among completed microbial
genomes (NCBI; National Center for Biotechnology Information), assisted by BLAST and PSI-BLAST [89]. In total
72 species were included in the study (54 eubacteria, 15
archaebacteria and three eukaryotes).

The eukaryotes were Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens. Accession numbers for eukaryote
proteins are presented elsewhere [90].
This dataset consisted of 60 proteins that were individually analysed as a step in orthology determination. The
proteins were aligned with CLUSTALW [91]. Then phylogenetic trees of each protein were built and visually
inspected. Initial trees were constructed using Minimum
Evolution (ME), with MEGA version 2.1 [92]. The major
criterion that we used in determining which genes to
include or exclude was the monophyly of domains. We
rejected genes with domains (archaebacteria and eubacte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/44

ria) that were non-monophyletic, as these would be the
best examples of HGT; this amounted to 61% of the genes
rejected. Some other genes were omitted if there were
detectable cases of HGT within a domain, such as the deep
nesting of a species from one Phylum within a clade of
another Phylum. Otherwise we did not eliminate genes
that had a different branching order of phyla within a
domain or different relationships of groups of lower taxonomic categories. Admittedly, ancient cases of HGT might
be an explanation for some of those topological differences, but they are not detectable. However, we further
tested the effectiveness of our criteria by examining the
stability of individual protein trees, using different
gamma values (α = 1, 0.5 and 0.3). We kept only the genes
that were stable to such perturbations (in terms of remaining in that category of non-HGT genes). The position of
eukaryotes, which varies depending on the gene, was not
considered in assessing monophyly of eubacteria and
archaebacteria.
The 32 remaining proteins were concatenated for analysis.
The α parameters used during the tree building process
were estimated with the program PamL (JTT+gamma
model) [93]. From the concatenation, trees were constructed with ME, Maximum Likelihood (ML) [94] and
Bayesian [95] methods. The phylogenies obtained with
ME, ML and Bayesian were similar, differing only at nonsignificant nodes assessed by the bootstrap method [96],
with one only significant exception on the position of M.
kandleri in the Bayesian phylogeny. The sequence alignments and other supplementary data are presented elsewhere [90].
Time estimation
Time estimation was conducted separately within each
domain (Archaebacteria and Eubacteria) using reciprocal
rooting and several calibration points. All time estimates
were calculated with a Bayesian local clock approach [97]
utilizing concatenated data sets of multiple proteins and a
JTT+gamma model of substitution [19,98,99]. The following settings were used: numsamp (10,000), burnin
(100,000), and sampfreq (100). This method permitted
rates to vary on different branches, which was necessary
given the known rate variation among prokaryote and
eukaryote nuclear protein sequences [30,44]. Calibration
of rate in this method was implemented by assigning constraints to nodes in the phylogeny. Five different initial
settings (prior distributions) were used in each domain
[see Additional file 4]. These were chosen at intervals of
0.5 Ga starting from 4.5 Ga, which is approximately the
age of the Earth and Solar System, to 2.5 Ga, which is
slightly before the major rise in oxygen (Great Oxidation
Event; GOE) as recorded in the geologic record [32] and
related to the presence of oxygenic cyanobacteria. Those
constraints pertained to the ingroup root, or deepest

divergence in the tree excluding the outgroup. Because of
the relatively small number of duplicate genes available
for rooting the tree of life, we were unable to estimate the
time of the last common ancestor (the divergence of
eubacteria and archaebacteria).
For the archaebacterial data set, we included eukaryotes
for calibration purposes because reliable calibration
points were unavailable among those prokaryotes. In
doing so, only proteins in which eukaryotes clustered with
archaebacteria were included [30]. An outgroup was used
that consisted of representatives of the major groups of
eubacteria [90]. We used the fossil and molecular times
(separately) of the plant-animal divergence as calibration
points, for comparison. The fossil calibration was the first
appearance of a representative of the plant lineage (red
algae) at 1.198 ± 0.022 Ga [100]. The molecular time estimate for this divergence was 1.609 ± 0.060 Ga from a
study of 143 rate-constant proteins [98]. We used the minimum and maximum bounds for these calibration times
as constraints in the Bayesian analysis. Although the
results of these two different calibrations are provided for
comparison, our preferred calibration is the 1.2 Ga fossil
calibration because it has the best justification (supporting evidence). Therefore, our summary time estimates for
archaebacteria, presented in the timetree (Fig. 3), use only
this fossil calibration.
For the eubacterial data set, we used four internal time
constraints in separate analyses, all involving the origin of
cyanobacteria. The first and most conservative constraint
was a fixed origin (minimum and maximum bounds) at
2.3 Ga, which corresponds to the GOE. For the second
constraint we used 2.3 Ga as a minimum bound, with no
maximum bound. For the third constraint we used a previous molecular time estimate (2.56 Ga) for the divergence of cyanobacteria from closest living relatives among
eubacteria, and fixed the minimum (2.04 Ga) and maximum (3.08 Ga) values to the 95% confidence limits of
that time estimate [30]. The fourth constraint for the origin of cyanobacteria was set at 2.7 Ga (minimum constraint) based on biomarker evidence for the presence of
2α-methylhopanes [86]. We did not consider the fossil
record of cyanobacteria because the earliest indisputable
fossils [52] are younger (2000 Ma) than the indirect evidence (GOE) for the presence of these oxygen-producing
organisms. Older fossils of cyanobacteria are known but
are disputed [52,101]. The use of these four alternative
constraints for the origin of cyanobacteria considers most
of the widely discussed hypotheses but does not rule out
an origin prior to 2.7 Ga. Although the results of the four
different calibrations are provided for comparison, our
preferred calibration is the 2.3 (minimum) geologic calibration because it has the best justification (supporting
evidence). Therefore, our summary time estimates for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/44

eubacteria, presented in the timetree (Fig. 3), use only this
geologic calibration.
For each of these calibration points, all five initial settings
were applied, resulting in 15 and 20 analyses for the
Archaebacteria and Eubacteria (respectively). The effects
of the different initial settings on the analyses were found
to be minimal. A 44% difference in the priors, in fact, generated a maximum 2.7% (average of all significant nodes)
difference in the time estimates (fossil calibration point)
in the archaebacteria and a maximum 3.5% (average of all
significant nodes) difference in the eubacteria (molecular
calibration point) [see Additional file 5].
