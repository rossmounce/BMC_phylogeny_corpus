Abstract
Background: Cysteine is a component in organic compounds including glutathione that have been implicated in the
adaptation of plants to stresses. O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) catalyses the final step of cysteine biosynthesis.
OAS-TL enzyme isoforms are localised in the cytoplasm, the plastids and mitochondria but the contribution of
individual OAS-TL isoforms to plant sulphur metabolism has not yet been fully clarified.
Results: The seedling lethal phenotype of the Arabidopsis onset of leaf death3-1 (old3-1) mutant is due to a point
mutation in the OAS-A1 gene, encoding the cytosolic OAS-TL. The mutation causes a single amino acid substitution
from Gly162 to Glu162, abolishing old3-1 OAS-TL activity in vitro. The old3-1 mutation segregates as a monogenic semidominant trait when backcrossed to its wild type accession Landsberg erecta (Ler-0) and the Di-2 accession. Consistent
with its semi-dominant behaviour, wild type Ler-0 plants transformed with the mutated old3-1 gene, displayed the
early leaf death phenotype. However, the old3-1 mutation segregates in an 11:4:1 (wild type: semi-dominant: mutant)
ratio when backcrossed to the Colombia-0 and Wassilewskija accessions. Thus, the early leaf death phenotype depends
on two semi-dominant loci. The second locus that determines the old3-1 early leaf death phenotype is referred to as
odd-ler (for old3 determinant in the Ler accession) and is located on chromosome 3. The early leaf death phenotype is
temperature dependent and is associated with increased expression of defence-response and oxidative-stress marker
genes. Independent of the presence of the odd-ler gene, OAS-A1 is involved in maintaining sulphur and thiol levels and
is required for resistance against cadmium stress.
Conclusions: The cytosolic OAS-TL is involved in maintaining organic sulphur levels. The old3-1 mutation causes
genome-dependent and independent phenotypes and uncovers a novel function for the mutated OAS-TL in cell
death regulation.
Background
The biogeochemical sulphur cycle has a major impact on
climate and life. The sulphur-containing amino acid
cysteine forms the exclusive building block for organic
compounds including glutathione that have been implicated in the adaptation of plants to a wide range of biotic
and abiotic stresses [1,2]. Cysteine synthesis creates a link
between sulphur reduction and amino acid metabolism

and therefore is a point of convergence for nitrogen and
sulphur assimilation. Sulphur assimilation starts with the
transport of anionic sulphate into plant cells by a family
of plasma membrane associated proton/sulphate cotransporter proteins [3]. Through serial enzymatic reactions, sulphate is first converted into sulphide and
cysteine biosynthesis is subsequently catalysed by a bienzyme complex called the cysteine synthase complex
(CSC). The initial reaction catalyzed by CSC is the formation of O-acetylserine (OAS) from serine and acetyl- CoA
by the activity of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) proteins.
Subsequently, O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OAS-TL) catalyses the incorporation of sulfide into OAS producing

Results
The old3-1 early leaf death phenotype is a temperaturedependent trait

The onset of leaf death3-1 (old3-1) mutant was isolated
from an EMS-mutagenised Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta

(Ler-0) population as a semi-dominant trait [24]. Figure
1a shows that homozygous and heterozygous old3-1
plants suffer from an early leaf death syndrome. The first
signs of leaf yellowing occur after 12 days of growth in
homozygous old3-1 seedlings. The visible leaf yellowing
was associated with a rapid decrease in chlorophyll content and a concurrent increase in ion leakage (Figure 1b),
followed by death of the plant after approximately 4
weeks. Plants heterozygous for the old3-1 mutation show
premature leaf yellowing but can, in contrast to the
homozygous mutants, finish their life cycle. The early leaf
death phenotype was found to be a temperature-dependent trait, and growth at 28°C completely suppresses the

cysteine [4,5]. SAT requires the presence of excessive
amounts of OAS-TL to gain full activity, whereas OASTL activity is low when bound to SAT [6-8]. SAT and
OAS-TL enzyme isoforms are distributed within the cell
compartments cytoplasm, plastid and mitochondria and
the CSC and its subcellular compartmentation have been
suggested to play a crucial role in the control of cysteine
biosynthesis [9,1]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, five and nine
genes encode for SAT- and OAS-TL-like proteins,
respectively [9]. The SAT proteins show functional
redundancy in vivo and Arabidopsis plants with mutations in any four of the five SAT genes survived although
three of the quadruple mutants showed dwarfism [10].
Four genes encoding OAS-TLs are strongly transcribed
according to the Genevestigator database [11], the Arabidopsis e-FP browser database [12] and individual studies
[13-15]. These genes encode cytoplasmic (OAS-A1), plastidic (OAS-TL C) and mitochondrial (OAS-TL B and
CYSC1) isoforms [15,16]. OAS-A1 is probably the only
functional cytosolic OAS-TL in Arabidopsis and is
responsible for a major part of the total OAS-TL activity
in the cell [17,1,18]. The contribution of each OAS-TL
isoform to plant sulphur metabolism has not yet been
fully clarified. Knock out of the cytosolic OAS-TL isoform reduces total cellular OAS-TL activity by 44 to 80%,
however no apparent phenotypic differences were
observed between the mutant and the wild type when
grown under non-stressed conditions [17,18]. Nevertheless, the antioxidant capacity of the cytosol was perturbed
[17]. Cysteine is also found to be the major factor controlling glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and phytochelatins
(PCs) [19-21]. GSH and other secondary organic sulphur
compounds are involved in the scavenging of free radicals
and hence have been implicated in the adaptation of
plants to a wide range of stresses including the detoxification of xenobiotics and the protection against heavy
metal toxicity [22,23,2].
Here we report that the lethal old3-1 phenotype is the
consequence of a point mutation in the gene encoding
the cytosolic OAS-TL. The old3-1 phenotype is associated with elevated expression of defence-response and
oxidative stress marker genes. Interestingly, the semidominant phenotype caused by the mutated protein is
depending on genomic context resulting in an early onset
of leaf death in Ler-0 and Di-2, but not in the Col-0 and
Ws-0 accessions. Since the mutated protein has no OASTL activity in vitro, these data suggest a novel genomedependent function of the mutated cytosolic OAS-TL.

(AT2G43510) [26] was monitored in 12-day-old old3-1
plants, and found to be ~160-fold up-regulated as compared to wild type plants (Figure 3). The results shown
here, together with those published previously [24] suggest that early leaf death in old3-1 seedlings does not
result from activation of a developmental senescence program, but rather a cell death pathway that is related to the
plant immune system and stress responses.

leaf death phenotype (Figure 2a). Transfer of old3
mutants from 28°C to 21°C after 2, 4 or 6 weeks results in
a visible leaf death phenotype within 10 days (Figure 2b),
suggesting that the temperature dependency is independent of the developmental stage. We examined expression of several marker genes involved in developmental
senescence, defence response, and programmed cell
death in old3-1 and wild type plants. Increased expression of PR1, SAG14, SAG21 and SAG13 was detected in
16- and 24-day-old old3-1 plants, while no signs of
SAG12 expression were found [24]. Marker genes of PR-1
and SAG13 are associated with programmed cell death as
well as oxidative stress signals [25]. Therefore, the expres-

F2 progeny obtained from a cross between heterozygous
old3-1 and Ler-0 plants segregates as a monogenic trait
for the old3-1 phenotype, while the same phenotype segregates in a different ratio when crossed to Col-0 [24]
(Table 1). Whereas in Ler-0 the old3 mutation is caused
by a single gene defect, two genes are needed for the same
phenotype in Col-0. The second gene was designated as
old3-1 determinant (odd). The Ler-0 and Col-0 alleles
were called odd-ler and odd-col, respectively. Different
segregation ratios were tested based on the number of
plants with a homozygous, a heterozygous and wild type
phenotype. The 1:2:13, 1:8:7 and 3:7:8 (homozygous:
heterozygous: wild type) segregation ratios were dismissed because of chi-square values of higher than 50. Of
the other segregation ratios tested, only the 1:4:11 ratio
fitted the data (Table 1). Thus two old3-1 and two odd-ler
alleles need to be present for the homozygous leaf death
phenotype to be manifested. The heterozygous phenotype requires either one old3-1 and two odd-ler alleles or
one odd-ler and two old3-1 alleles (Table 2). The presence
of the odd-ler allele in old3-1 plants, rather than the
absence of the odd-col allele, is required for the manifestation of the old3-1 phenotype, thus the odd-ler allele is

the crosses between Het-old3-1 and Ler-0, Di-2 accessions, only the F1 progeny with the Het-old3-1 phenotypes were selected and used for
F2 segregation analyses. For the crosses between Het-old3-1 and Col-0 and Ws-0, at least ten F1 plants were selected and allowed to set seed. The

semi-dominant as well. The old3-1 heterozygous plants
were crossed to two additional accessions. The old3-1
phenotype segregated in Di-2 as in Ler-0, while the Ws-0
accession behaved similar to Col-0 (Table 1). Thus, different Arabidopsis backgrounds resulted in two distinct segregation patterns for the old3-1 phenotype. The old3-1
mutant was crossed to a further 14 different accessions
and the F1 of 11 of those (Ak-1, Bd-0, Bla-2, Bs-2, Litva,
Mt-0, Nok-0, Rubezh, Noe-1, Tsu-1, Wil 2) looked like
the F1 of the cross with Col-0. The F1 of the other 3
crosses had the old3-1 heterozygous phenotype (Bu-18,
Wa-1, Rsch-0), suggesting the presence of odd-ler-like
alleles in these accessions.
Initial mapping revealed that the old3-1 phenotype is
linked to a CAPS marker locus called G4539a on chromosome 4, and a SSLP marker locus called K11J14 on
chromosome 3 [24]. Therefore, one of the genome loca-

tions carries the old3-1 mutation, and the other the oddler gene. To clarify the position of the old3-1 and odd-ler
loci on the genome, plants heterozygous for the old3-1
mutation were crossed to fca-1 and abi1-1 mutants (both
having the Ler-0 background). The old3-1 mutation was
found to co-segregate with the ABI1 and FCA wild type
alleles (Data not shown), demonstrating that the old3-1
mutation is located on chromosome 4 and the odd-ler
gene on chromosome 3. Thus, the old3-1 early leaf death
phenotype is a genome-dependent trait in Arabidopsis
which requires accession-specific odd-ler-like alleles.
The OLD3 gene encodes the cytosolic O-acetylserine (thiol)
lyase, OAS-A1

Further mapping placed the old3-1 mutation into a 14-kb
region on the bacterial artificial chromosome clone FCA2
(accession number Z97337) spanning 8 open reading
frames. Sequence analysis revealed a G to A substitution
in AT4G14880 which encodes the cytosolic O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL), OAS-A1. The mutation
results in a Gly162 to Glu162 substitution in the OAS-A1/
OLD3 protein. The entire old3-1 gene including its promoter region was cloned and transformed into wild-type
Ler-0 plants. Transformation of a single old3-1 gene into
Ler-0 is expected to give the old3-1-het phenotype. However, because of possible position effects and multiple
integrations, a range of expression levels and phenotypes
were expected. More then 20 transformants were identified and 15 transformants were tested for the presence of
the basta resistance gene, the transgenic old3-1 gene and
the wild type OLD3 gene. All the tested plants had the
expected genotype and showed an early leaf death phenotype. However, none of the transformants produced
progeny although some phenotypic variation was found
with several transformants dying at the two leaf stage
similar to the homozygous mutant and others developing
up to the flowering stage. Figure 4a shows a photograph

of a representative old3-1 transformant. Thus, the old3-1
mutation results in a mutant protein with an altered or
partial function that causes the early leaf death phenotype.
OAS-A1/OLD3 uses pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) as a
cofactor to synthesise cysteine from O-acetylserine
(OAS) and sulfide [4,5,27]. According to the amino acid
sequence alignment of three OAS-TL isomers in Arabidopsis, the old3-1 amino acid substitution is located at
the fifth α-helix in the middle of a highly conserved area
(TTGPEIW) (Figure 4b) [28]. The fifth α-helix, including
His157 that interacts with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
(PLP) binding site, is in close proximity to a mostly conserved region at the sixth α-helix (GAGKYLK) including
Ala189, Tyr192 and Leu193 (Figure 4c). The Gly162 to Glu162
substitution results in a size and charge difference that
may cause a change in the protein structure and activity.
The old3-1 protein has no in vitro OAS-TL activity

The E.coli Cys- auxotrophic strain NK3 [29] lacks the
cysteine synthase gene and consequently is unable to
grow on medium without supplemental cysteine. The
OAS-A1/OLD3 is able to complement the E. coli NK3
strain [14] and we determined whether the old3-1 gene is
able to complement the phenotype of the E.coli NK3
strain as well. The old3-1 and the wild type OAS-A1/
OLD3 cDNAs were cloned into an expression vector.
Subsequently, the E. coli NK3 strain was transformed
with the expression vectors harbouring the cDNAs and
the empty vector and grown on minimal medium M9
with and without cysteine. E. coli NK3 transformed with
the OAS-A1/OLD3 cDNA could grow on medium lacking
cysteine, while E.coli NK3 carrying the old3-1 cDNA and
empty vector were unable to grow further (Figure 5).
These results confirm that the OAS-A1/OLD3 is able to
complement the phenotype of the E. coli Δcys NK3 strain
and suggest that the cytosolic old3-1 protein has either a
reduced or no OAS-TL enzyme activity in E.coli NK3.
For further old3-1 OAS-TL activity analysis, the OASA1/OLD3 and old3-1 cDNAs were cloned into the
pET15b expression vector. Subsequently the old3-1 and
OAS-A1/OLD3 proteins were over-expressed in E.coli
BL21 (DE3). The proteins were purified using a Ni2+NTA agarose column, and molecular masses on a SDSPAGE gel were found to be in agreement with the
expected molecular mass. We applied 3.1 nM purified
OAS-A1/OLD3 and old3-1 OAS-TL proteins to the
cysteine precursors OAS and Na2S and subsequently
OAS-TL activity was measured according to [30]. A specific activity of 84 ± 4 μmol min-1 mg-1 (48 ± 2 s-1) was
found for the OAS-A1/OLD3, but for the same enzyme
concentration no activity was detected for old3-1 OASTL. The obtained value for the OAS-A1/OLD3 protein is
within those already published (906 ± 39 μmol min-1 mg-1

Together, the data show that old3-1 cytosolic OAS-TL
has no in vitro activity at the enzyme concentrations
tested.
OAS-A1/OLD3 affects sulphur balance and thiol levels

Under sulphur-sufficient conditions, metabolites such as
cysteine and glutathione act as regulators of sulphur
uptake and assimilation [33]. In order to clarify if the
mutated cytosolic old3-1 OAS-TL has some effects on
availability of down-stream or up-stream compounds in
the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, we measured the contents of total sulphur and sulphate ion as direct measurements of plant sulphur balance. Total thiol levels were
measured as a parameter of plant sulphur metabolism
[34,21,35]. To be able to distinguish between direct
effects of the mutated OASTL and indirect effects as a
result of the early leaf death phenotype, we isolated the
old3-2 mutant as described in the Methods section. This
mutant carries a homozygous T-DNA insertion in the
OAS-A1/OLD3 gene and is identical to the oasa1.1
mutant as described by Lopez-Martin et al. [17] (results
not shown). The old3-2/oas-a1.1 mutant has the Col-0
(odd-col) background and similar to the old3-1old3-1oddcolodd-col line (carrying the homozygous old3-1 mutation and odd-col alleles in an otherwise Col-0/Ler-0
mixed background), did not show the early leaf death
phenotype (Figure 6). Thus, the lack of OAS-TL activity
in the old3-2/oas-a1.1 mutants does not cause a leaf
death phenotype. Figures 7a and 7b show the total sulphur and sulphate ion contents as well as thiol levels of
the old3 mutant and their respective wild types. Total sulphur and sulphate ion content was increased while the
thiol content was lower in old3-1 and old3-2/oasa1.1
lines as compared to their wild types. The data show that
the OAS-A1/OLD3, independently from the odd-ler gene
affects sulphur balance as well as thiol levels.

fluorescent light at 21°C. Bars represent 0.5 cm.

old3 mutant lines show an increased sensitivity to
cadmium stress

OAS-A1/OLD3 gene expression is up-regulated in
response to cadmium-induced stress and this may allow
for enhanced cadmium tolerance [36]. The effect of cadmium on seedling growth of the old3-1 and old3-2/
oasa1.1 mutants and their wild types were investigated.
Figure 7c shows the effect of various cadmium concentrations on plant growth. At 150 μM cadmium, all tested
genotypes showed a considerable decrease in fresh
weight as compared to growth without cadmium. In contrast, the old3-1 and old3-2/oas-a1.1 lines showed significant reductions in fresh weight already from 50 μM
cadmium and onwards. Thus, OAS-A1/OLD3 is involved
in cadmium tolerance and the old3-1 mutation increases
the cadmium sensitivity, independent of the presence of
the odd-ler or odd-col gene.

Discussion
Cysteine is synthesised in the cytosol, the plastids and
mitochondria. The Arabidopsis genome contains OASTL isoforms for each of the different cellular locations.
Recently the effects of T-DNA insertions in the genes
encoding the different isoforms were studied [18].
Although the cytosolic OAS-A1/OLD3 isoform contributes to 44% of total OAS-TL activity in leaf and ~80% in
root, it was reported that the OAS-A1/OLD3 isoform is
completely dispensable [18]. However, others found that
loss-of function cytosolic OAS-TL mutants resulted in
compromised antioxidant capacity of the cytosol [17].

Figure 7 The function of OAS-A1 on sulphur metabolism and cadmium stress. a) Total sulphur and sulphate ion levels were measured in dry
matter obtained from plants grown for 27 days in soil saturated with 25% Hoagland solution. b) Total water-soluble non-protein sulfhydryl (thiol) compounds were measured in fresh materials obtained from 27-day-old plants. Above-ground parts of 27-day-old plants were harvested for measurement
of total sulphur, sulphate ion and thiols content. Data are shown as mean ± sd of four replicates (17 plants for each replicate). Bars with the same letters
indicate values that are not significantly different from each other after Duncan multiple variant significance test at a significance level of p < 0.05. c)
Effect of CdCl2 on fresh weight of old3-1, old3-2 and their respective wild types. Fresh weight was measured after 16 days of growth on the indicated
concentration of CdCl2. Fresh weight is expressed as percentage of the fresh weight when grown without CdCl2 (set at 100). Data are shown as mean
± sd of three replicates (20 seedlings for each replicate).

Here we report that a single amino-acid change in OASA1/OLD3 compromises OAS-TL activity and uncovers a
novel role of this enzyme in cell death signalling.
The semi-dominant old3-1 mutation causes a Gly162 to
Glu162 substitution in OAS-A1/OLD3. The old3-1 muta-

tion results in a dysfunctional enzyme in vitro and likely
in vivo as well. The 3D structure of the OAS-A1/OLD3
has been resolved [28] and this allows for an explanation
for the compromised enzyme activity: the small and neutral Gly residue is substituted with a much larger charged

Shirzadian-Khorramabad et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/80

amino acid Glu that is in close proximity to the sixth αhelix, therefore likely causing a positional movement in
the α-helices 5 and 6, and subsequent shifts of the associated residues in these helices. Consequently, residues
involved in the positioning of the substrate and the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, which is ~16 A away
from Gly162, might be affected by these helical shifts
[37,28].
The old3-1 early leaf death phenotype is a result of the
activity of the mutated old3-1 allele, rather than the
absence of the wild type OAS-A1/OLD3 allele, in combination with a natural variant gene odd-ler. The phenotype
therefore depends on the genomic context. The odd-lerlike alleles are present in the minority of accessions tested
and the presence of odd-col/odd-ler alleles does not correlate with the geographic origins of the accessions, or
with their phylogeny relationships as illustrated with
molecular markers [38]. It is unclear how the mutated
OAS-TL may cause cell death in combination with the
odd-ler gene. The CSC formation and protein-protein
interaction of its subunits play essential regulatory roles
in plants [1] and the old3-1 mutant protein may affect the
formation of the CSC and SAT activity. A changed OASTL conformation could exert a dominant-negative effect
in combination with the odd-ler gene product. The leaf
death phenotype moreover strictly depends on temperature and can conveniently be switched on and off by
changing the growth conditions. It seems possible that a
higher temperature may alter the folding of the mutated
protein or abolish the interaction with the odd-ler gene
product or a protein that is involved in the leaf death phenotype. Formally it cannot be excluded that the absence
of cytosolic OAS-TL activity causes the early leaf death
phenotype in combination with the odd-ler allele. In this
scenario, the early leaf death phenotype observed in the
Ler-0 plants transformed with the old3-1 gene would
have to be a result of co-suppression of the wild type
OLD3 gene by the transgene. However, since the obtained
transformants all had the early leaf death phenotype and
no wild type transformants were found, this possibility
seems unlikely.
The old3-2 mutant used in this study is identical to the
oas-a1.1 mutation and is likely a knock-out allele [17].
Similar to what has been found earlier [17,18], the old3-2/
oas-a1.1 mutation or the old3-1 mutation in combination
with the homozygous odd-col allele (old3-1old3-1oddcolodd-col) resulted in plants that were indistinguishable
from the wild type, when grown under standard conditions. Therefore, the compromised activity of OAS-A1/
OLD3 in old3-2 plants does not induce the cell death phenotype. However, a significant increase in both total sulphur and sulphate ion was found in the old3-2/oas-a1.1
mutant. Similar differences were not found by Heeg et al.
[18], perhaps due to differences in growth conditions

Page 8 of 12

and/or plant age. In addition, a decrease in non-protein
thiol contents was found in the old3-1 and old3-2/oasa1.1 mutant lines. GSH is a non-protein thiol and others
[17] found a reduction in GSH levels in old3-2/oas-a1.1
plants. These results suggest that the compromised OASA1/OLD3 activity in the mutant causes reduced sulphate
assimilation and lower organic sulphur levels. However,
the changes are small and may have little, if any, impact
on plant growth when grown under standard growth conditions [18,17].
Plants have developed defence systems to cope with
environmental stresses such as heavy metal pollution.
Cysteine is required for the synthesis of GSH and is as
such involved in plant responses to toxic levels of heavy
metals [21]. OAS-A1/OLD3 is known to be involved in
the defence response of Arabidopsis against abiotic
stresses such as salinity and the presence of heavy metals
[17,39,40]. Moreover, its higher expression resulted in
increased cadmium tolerance [39,36]. Thus, increased
OAS-A1/OLD3 activity enhances cadmium resistance.
Here we show that plants with compromised OAS-A1/
OLD3 function are more sensitive to cadmium stress.
Consequently, the OAS-A1/OLD3 is required for coping
with cadmium-induced stress and the mitochondrial
and/or the plastidic OAS-TL cannot fully compensate for
the lack of OAS-A1/OLD3. The function of the OAS-A1/
OLD3 may therefore be to quickly respond to environmental stress, while its function during growth under
environmentally ideal conditions may be limited. Consistent with our results, old3-2/oas-a1.1 seedlings exhibited
an enhanced sensitivity to cadmium-induced stress [17].
In addition, the data from transcriptomic analysis of
old3-2/oas-a1.1 mutant plants grown under non-stressed
conditions suggested the involvement of OAS-A1/OLD3
in plant responses to stress, and in particular, to ROSinduced stress. These findings coincide with phenotypes
observed in leaves of old3-2/oas-a1.1 mutants, including
histochemical detection of H2O2 as well as lesions characteristic for cell death [17]. Moreover, a recent research
showed the existence of OAS-A1/OLD3 in the peroxisomes, which are actively involved in ROS detoxification
in leaves [41]. Thus, the results presented here are consistent with the suggestion that OAS-A1/OLD3 deficiency
results in a constitutively reduced capacity to eliminate
cytosolic ROS [17]. Moreover the reported phenotype of
the oas-a1.1 mutant shows some resemblance with the
old3-1 early leaf death phenotype. oas-a1.1 mutant plants
have microscopic lesions and the massive cell death
observed in old3-1 plants may be the result of the same
phenomenon on a much larger scale. The leaf death phenotype coincides with increased expression of the general
oxidative stress-related marker DEFL and with other
marker genes commonly associated with the activation of
the plant defence response. It seems appealing to suggest

Shirzadian-Khorramabad et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/80

that the presence of odd-ler may amplify the effect of
OAS-A1 deficiency on ROS elimination in old3-1 mutant
plants. However, the leaf death phenotype requires the
presence of the mutated old3-1/OAS-A1 gene, rather
than the absence of the wild type one. The question
remains how the mutated protein causes the phenotype.
It seems inevitable that the Gly162 to Glu162 substitution
causes a conformational change and this may alter the
interaction with SAT. It is notable that knockout of four
of the 5 SATs causes dwarfism, depending on the SAT
remaining [10]. The early leaf death may be an extreme
manifestation of the observed dwarfism as a result of an
odd-ler-dependent changed interaction between SAT and
old3-1. However, an altered conformation could equally
well change the function or amplify an otherwise minor
role of the protein.

Conclusions
This study describes an EMS-induced mutation in the
cytosolic OAS-TL. The mutation results in a protein that
has no in vitro OAS-TL activity anymore, resulting in
altered sulphur balance and cadmium hypersensitivity.
The mutated gene furthermore causes a temperaturedependent lethal phenotype in combination with the
genome-dependent gene odd-ler. The nature of the oddler/old3-1 interaction is still unclear, but the identification of the odd-ler gene, together with analysis of the leaf
death syndrome will allow us to unravel this unique cell
death pathway.
Methods
Plant material and growth conditions

Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Landsberg erecta (Ler-0)
and Colombia (Col-0) were mainly used in this study.
Several other accessions were obtained from the NASC
(Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre). The old3-1
(old3-1old3-1odd-ler odd-ler) mutant has been described
elsewhere [24]. old3-1old3-1odd-colodd-col genotype was
selected from an F2 population generated from a cross
between
old3-1OLD3odd-lerodd-ler
with
Col-0
(OLD3OLD3odd-colodd-col). The old3-1old3-1oddcolodd-col plants therefore carry homozygous Ler-0 DNA
around the old3-1 gene and homozygous Col-0 DNA
around the odd-col locus, as confirmed with DNA markers. The rest of the genome is mixed Col-0/Ler-0. SALK
line 072213, carrying a T-DNA insertion in the OAS-A1/
OLD3 gene in Col-0 background was obtained from
NASC under number N572213 [42]. A plant line
homozygous for the insertion was designated as old3-2.
The T-DNA insertion was detected with a PCR product
from the primer pair PrRuG659: TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG/PrRuG761: TACACCAATGGAGTGTTCCCAATCA. Surface-sterilized seeds of Ler-0, Col-0,
old3-1 and old3-2 genotypes were sown on MS media

Page 9 of 12

[43], pH 5.6, 1% sucrose, 1% agar, and CdCl2 at various
concentrations. Seeds were kept at 4°C for 3 days and
subsequently transferred to a growth chamber (21°C, 16 h
light/8 h dark) for 16 days before harvesting. Soil-grown
plants were sown on an organic-rich soil (TULIP PROFI
No.4, BOGRO B.V., Hardenberg, The Netherlands) as
described [24].
Map-based cloning and plant transformation

To identify the old3-1 mutation, approximately 5000
homozygous old3-1 (old3-1old3-1odd-lerodd-ler) F2 seedlings with a lethal phenotype were selected from a mapping population generated by crossing heterozygous
old3-1 (old3-1OLD3odd-ler odd-ler) plants with Col-0
(OLD3OLD3odd-colodd-col). DNA was isolated using the
SHORTY
quick
preparation
method
(http://
preuss.bsd.uchicago.edu/protocols/Plantdna.html). The
old3-1 mutation was mapped to the Arabidopsis genome
using CAPS, SSLP and SNP markers. Potential SNPs [44],
were selected and primers that specifically amplified Col0 DNA fragments were designed using the Web SNAPER
program [45]. The mutation was mapped onto a 14 kb
region spanning 8 open reading frames. Sequence analyses revealed a single nucleotide change inside OAS-A1/
OLD3. Oligonucleotide primers PrRuG760 (CTATGATCCTTCCGGTGGTGAGAA) and PrRuG775 (GATGGAAGCAAAGACGCAATGTAACTAA) were used to
amplify the mutated OAS-A1 gene from old3-1 plants.
The genomic fragment was cloned into pGreen0229 and
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [46,47] of the
construct into the wild type Ler-0 was performed to confirm that the old3-1 mutation causes the early leaf death
phenotype. In order to distinguish Ho-old3-1 (ie, old31old3-1) and Het-old3-1 (ie, OLD3old3-1) plants, the
primers PrRuG760 (CTATGATCCTTCCGGTGGTGAGAA) and PrRuG775 (GATGGAAGCAAAGACGCAATGTAACTAA) were employed to amplify the OASA1 gene from Ler-0, old3-1old3-1odd-lerodd-ler and
old3-1OLD3odd-lerodd-ler plants. The obtained 2928 bp
PCR product was digested by Sau96I to visualise the
polymorphism between the OLD3 and old3-1 alleles. The
odd-ler gene was mapped at the lower arm of chromosome 3, approximately 4 centiMorgans south of SSLP
marker K11J14 [24].
Cloning, enzyme activity assay and complementation of
ΔCys E.coli

The cytosolic forms of OAS-A1/OLD3 and old3-1 were
amplified from Ler-0 and old3-1 cDNAs, respectively,
using specific primers as described [28]. The PCR products were sub-cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. The cDNA fragments were cut
with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into NcoI/BamHI
digested pTrc99A [48] and pET15b (Novagen) to create

Shirzadian-Khorramabad et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/80

the pTrc99A:OLD3, pTrc99A:old3-1, pET15b:OLD3 and
pET15b:old3-1 constructs.
OAS-A1/OLD3 and old3-1 protein was purified from
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET15b:OLD3
and pET15b:old3-1 constructs as described elsewhere
[28]. Transformed BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on LB at
37°C until A600 ~0.8 and protein expression was induced
with 1 mM 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C.
Bound proteins were eluted from Ni2+-NTA agarose columns with buffer containing 150 mM imidazole. Eluted
proteins were dialyzed against 100 mM Mopso (pH 7.0)
and stored at -20°C. OAS-A1 enzyme activity was determined as described [28] using the Gaitonde method [30].
Briefly, the reaction was started with the addition of 26.7
ng (3.1 nM) of OAS-A1/OLD3 and old3-1 protein and
incubated for 5, 10 and 15 min and subsequently stopped
by adding 50 μl trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation,
0.25 ml supernatant was added to 0.25 ml acid-ninhydrin
reagent, and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min.
After cooling, 0.5 ml 100% cold ethanol was added and
the extinction at 560 nm was measured. The standard
curve for cysteine was made as described [49].
For E. coli NK3 (ΔtrpE5 leu-6 hsdR hsdM+ cysK cysM)
[29] complementation, E. coli cells were transformed with
the empty vector pTrc99A, pTrc99A:OLD3 and
pTrc99A:old3-1 and grown on 5× M9 Minimal Mediacontaining 1.5% agar plates, supplemented with 0.2 gL-1
leucine and tryptophan, 50 μgml-1 ampiciline, and 0.5
mM cysteine where indicated.
Physiological analyses

Chlorophyll content and ion leakage was measured as
described [24]. To measure total sulphur, sulphate ion
and thiols, plants were grown in soil saturated with 25%
Hoagland solution for 27 days, at 25 °C and 70% relative
humidity, and a 16 hr/8 hr light/dark cycle (200 μmolm2s-1). The above ground parts of plants were harvested for
fresh weight and dry weight measurement. Dry plant
materials were used for total sulphur measurement using
the barium sulphate precipitation method [50] and for
anion measurement using HPLC-based methods [51].
Parts of the fresh samples were used for the measurement
of total water-soluble non-protein sulfhydryl (SH) compounds following the method described [52]. For the total
sulphur and sulphate ion content data of old3-1old31odd-lerodd-ler mutants, one replicate of 50 plants was
used for analysis due to the small size of plants and for
other data points four replicates of 17 plants were used.
RNA isolation and Real-Time PCR

Total RNA was isolated and purified using the Qiagen
RNeasy plant mini kit according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Fifteen hundred nanograms of RNA were used
as template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using 200 U

Page 10 of 12

of RevertAid H-minus MMuLV reverse transcriptase
(Fermentas USA) and an oligo (dT) primer. Primer pairs
for Real-Time PCR were designed using the open-source
PCR primer design program PerlPrimer v1.1.10 [53].
Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR system and the
Applied Biosystems power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
kit was used for the Real-Time PCR amplification according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotide
primers PrRuG2443 (CTTAGTCATTTCCGATGTGCC)
and PrRuG2444 (GCATCTTCCACCTTTAGCTC) were
used to amplify DEFL (AT2G43510) and primers
PrRuG1699
(TCTCCGCTTTGAATTGTCTC)
and
PrRuG1700 (TATGAGCTTGGAAAGAAAGAGC) were
used to amplify ACTIN2 (AT3G18780). The Real-Time
PCR program was 2 min at 94°C, 40× (94°C for 10 sec/
58°C for 10 sec/72°C for 25 sec). The PCR reaction was
followed by a meltcurve analysis to confirm that a single
band was amplified and no primer dimers were present.
The obtained data was analysed with Bio-Rad software.
