Characterization of alphasatellites associated with
monopartite begomovirus/betasatellite
complexes in Yunnan, China
Yan Xie†, Peijun Wu†, Pei Liu, Huanran Gong, Xueping Zhou*

Abstract
Background: Alphasatellites are single-stranded molecules that are associated with monopartite begomovirus/
betasatellite complexes.
Results: Alphasatellites were identified in begomovirus-infected plant samples in Yunnan, China. All samples that
contained alphasatellites also contained betasatellites, but only some samples that contained betasatellites
contained alphasatellites. Thirty-three alphasatellites were sequenced, and they ranged from 1360 to 1376
nucleotides. All alphasatellites contain 3 conserved features: a single open reading frame (Rep), a conserved hairpin
structure, and an adenine-rich (A-rich) region. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree of the complete nucleotide
sequences, the alphasatellites were divided into 3 types with one exception. Type 1 was associated with Tomato
yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV)/Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite (TYLCCNB) complex. Type 2 was
associated with Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV)/Tobacco curly shoot betasatellite (TbCSB) complex. Type 3 was
associated with TbCSV/Ageratum yellow vein betasatellite (AYVB) complex. Within each type, nucleotide sequence
identity ranged from 83.4 to 99.7%, while 63.4-81.3% identity was found between types. Mixed infections of
alphasatellites associated with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes were documented.
Conclusions: Our results validate that alphasatellites are only associated with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes.
Thirty-three sequenced alphasatellites isolated from Yunnan Province, China were divided into 3 types–each
associated with a specific begomovirus/betasatellite complex. Mix-infections of alphasatellite molecules may not be
unusual.

Background
Geminiviruses are a group of plant viruses characterized
by their geminate shape and the size of their particles,
which encapsidate a circular single-stranded DNA genome. Due to their wide host range and high frequency
of genome variation, geminiviruses cause substantial
yield losses in many crops, including tomato, cassava,
and cotton, throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions
worldwide [1,2]. The majority of geminiviruses described
belong to the genus Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae, they are transmitted by the whitefly, Bemisia
tabaci [3]. Most begomoviruses have 2 components,
which are referred to as DNA-A and DNA-B, both are

essential for virus proliferation. Many species only have
a single genomic component that resembles DNA-A
[1,3]. Some monopartite begomoviruses are associated
with betasatellites (formerly DNAb), which affect the
replication of their respective helper begomoviruses and
alter the symptoms induced in some host plants [4-9].
Analysis of betasatellites reveals that they are approximately half the size of the genomic DNA, and except
for a conserved hairpin structure and a TAATATTAC
loop sequence, they have little sequence similarity to
either the DNA-A or DNA-B molecules of begomoviruses. Betasatellites require begomoviruses for replication, encapsidation, insect transmission, and movement
in plants [10].
Alphasatellites (formerly DNA1) are circular, singlestranded DNA molecules associated with begomovirus/
betasatellite complexes [11-15]. Alphasatellites are

approximately half the size of begomovirus DNA and
encode a rolling-circle replication initiator protein similar to nanoviruses. Consequently, alphasatellites are capable of self-replication in host plants, but require helper
begomoviruses for movement in plants as well as insect
transmission.
In China, several begomoviruses are reported to infect
squash, tobacco, ageratum, tomato, and malvastrum;
many begomovirus isolates are associated with betasatellites, and co-evolution of betasatellites with their helper
viruses has been documented [9,16-21]. In this report,
we identify 33 alphasatellites from Yunnan Province,
China, and demonstrate that they can be classified into
3 types–each associated with a specific begomovirus/
betasatellite complex.

Results
Alphasatellites associated with various begomovirus/
betasatellite complexes in Yunnan, China

More than 300 plant samples exhibiting begomoviruslike symptoms, including Ageratum conyzoides, Malvastrum coromandelianum, and tobacco, tomato, and
squash plants, were collected from widely separated
locations in Yunnan. The majority of these isolates were
found to be infected with 1 or 2 of the following 7
viruses: Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) [7], Tobacco
leaf curl Yunnan virus (TbLCYNV) [19], Tomato yellow
leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) [5], Tomato yellow
leaf curl Thailand virus (TYLCTHV) [16], Malvastrum
yellow vein virus (MYVV) [17], Malvastrum yellow vein
Yunnan virus (MYVYNV) [22], and Squash leaf curl
Yunnan virus (SLCYNV) [20]. Some of these viruses are
known to be associated with betasatellites (Table 1).
Alphasatellites were identified from tobacco, tomato,
ageratum, and malvastrum plants infected by TbCSV,
TYLCCNV, TbCSV + TYLCCNV, TbCSV + TbLCYNV,
TYLCCNV + TYLCTHV, TbCSV + MYVV, and

TbCSV + MYVYNV. However, alphasatellites were not
found in tomato plants infected by TYLCTHV, tobacco
plants infected by TbLCYNV, malvastrum plants
infected by MYVV or MYVYNV, or squash plants
infected by SLCYNV (Table 1). When tested by PCR, all
samples that had alphasatellites were found to be associated with betasatellites, however, only some samples
that had betasatellites were found to be associated with
alphasatellites. A high proportion of samples infected by
TbCSV/Tobacco curly shoot betasatellite (TbCSB) complex (50%) and TYLCCNV/Tomato yellow leaf curl
China betasatellite (TYLCCNB) complex (42.9%) were
associated with alphasatellites, whereas no samples
infected by TYLCTHV/Tomato yellow leaf curl
Thailand betasatellite (TYLCTHB), MYVV/Malvastrum
yellow vein betasatellite (MYVB), or MYVYNV/Malvastrum yellow vein Yunnan betasatellite (MYVYNB) complexes contained alphasatellites (Table 1). TbLCYNV
and SLCYNV isolates were not associated with betasatellites; additionally, alphasatellites were not detected in
samples infected by TbLCYNV or SLCYNV (Table 1).
Furthermore, we found that the severity of symptoms
appearing in plants was similar whether or not they
were infected with alphasatellites.
Sequence analysis of alphasatellites

The complete nucleotide sequences of the 23 alphasatellites from tobacco, 3 from tomato, 2 from ageratum, and
5 from malvastrum plants (total: 33) were determined to
be 1360 to 1376 nucleotides (nts) in length–this is longer
than betasatellites, which range from 1333 to 1355 nts in
length. The sequences of these 33 alphasatellites have
been submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers AJ579345-AJ579361, AJ888445-AJ888455, and
FN678899-FN678903 (Table 2). The alphasatellites are
named according to their sample number; thus, Y35A
refers to alphasatellites from sample Y35.

Nucleotide sequence comparisons show that the 33
alphasatellites can be divided into 3 types (Table 3).
Type 1 consists of 9 samples infected by TYLCCNV and
3 samples infected by TYLCCNV + TYLCTHV; overall
nucleotide sequence identity is 83.4-99.7%. Type 2 consists of 5 samples infected by TbCSV, 2 samples infected
by TbCSV + TbLCYNV, and 3 samples infected by
TbCSV + TYLCCNV; the sequences in type 2 share
91.4-98.2% identity. Type 3 consists of samples mixinfected by TbCSV and other begomoviruses, including
4 samples inflected by TbCSV + TbLCYNV, 2 by
TbCSV + MYVYNV, and 2 by TbCSV + MYVV;
sequences in type 3 share 90.3-99.6% identity. The overall nucleotide sequence identity between types 1 and 2
is 75.9-81.3%, 63.4-72.0% between types 1 and 3 and
69.3-75.5% between types 2 and 3. Y89A is distinct
among the 33 alphasatellites and shares only 69.3-79.5%
nucleotide sequence identity with alphasatellites of the 3
types. A relatively lower sequence identity (58.9-71.8%)

Accession number

exists between the present 33 and previously reported
alphasatellites (data not shown).
Further analysis revealed that type 1 alphasatellites can
be further classified into 3 separate subtypes. One subtype contains 5 alphasatellites (Y70A, Y71A, Y72A,
Y87A-7, and Y261A) from Baoshan District and Y8A-5
from Honghe District. The second subtype consists of 4
alphasatellites (Y36A, Y38A, Y244A, and Y248A) from
Honghe District. The third branch consists of 4 alphasatellites, among them, Y8A-6 and Y39A were from Honghe District, and Y240A and Y241A were from
Wenshan District. There are 2 subtypes of type 2: one
consists of 8 alphasatellites (Y99A, Y115A, Y130A,
Y135A, Y143A, Y146A, Y283A, and Y290A) and the
other consists of 2 alphasatellites (Y35A and Y87A-2);
all isolates were from Baoshan District. Type 3 molecules consist of 8 alphasatellites (Y132A, Y137A, Y216A,
Y249A, Y273A, Y276A, Y277A and Y278A) from
Baoshan, Honghe, and Yuxi districts, and cluster with

frame, and an adenine-rich (A-rich) region (Figure 2).
The highly conserved structure contains a predicted
hairpin structure with a loop that includes the nonanucleotide, TAGTATTAC, which is common to nanoviruses and is similar to the TAATATTAC sequence of
geminiviruses. For both geminiviruses and nanoviruses,
this sequence contains the origin of replication, and is
nicked by Rep to initiate virion-strand DNA replication.
Alignment analysis indicates that alphasatellite hairpin

structures fall into 5 groups. Groups 1 and 2 contain 10
and 4 alphasatellites, respectively; all alphasatellites in
groups 1 and 2 belong to type 1 and share the same
loop sequences, but in different stems. Group 3 has 10
alphasatellites which belong to type 2. Alphasatellites in
groups 1 and 3 share the same stem sequences excluding one different (G/A) nucleotide in the loop. Group 4
contains only 1 alphasatellite (Y89A), which is distinct
from the other 32 owing to its unique stem sequence.
Group 5 contains 8 alphasatellites belonging to type 3,
which share the same loop sequence with groups 1, 2,
and 4, but have a distinct stem (Figure 3).
A-rich regions are maintained by all alphasatellites
immediately downstream of the Rep gene as reported for
other alphasatellites. This A-rich region is approximately
153-169 nts long with an A-content of between 52.358.4%. The alignment of the sequences of the A-rich
region shows that they can be divided into 3 types in
accordance with the phylogenetic trees of the complete
nucleotide sequences of the alphasatellites (Figure 4).
All alphasatellites encompass a single large virionsense ORF that has the capacity to encode an approximately 36.6 kDa protein consisting of 315 amino acids,
which resembles Rep of nanoviruses. Reps encoded by
alphasatellites are highly conserved, with 86.3-100.0%
amino acid sequence identities among the 33 alphasatellites (Table 3). Therefore, alphasatellite Rep is more
conserved than complete alphasatellite sequences.
Amino acid sequence comparisons of Reps also show
that the 33 alphasatellites can be divided into 3 main
types, which correspond to the 3 types of full-length
sequence comparison (Figure 1, right).

Mixed infections of geminiviruses were readily found.
Some samples, including Y70-Y72, Y87, Y115, Y132,
Y137, Y143, Y146, Y216, Y249, Y273, Y276-278, and
Y290, were infected by 2 different viruses (Table 2). In
order to determine whether each virus associated with
its own alphasatellite molecule, more alphasatellites
clones from these samples were sequenced. Sequence
analysis revealed that mixed infections of alphasatellites
occurred in samples Y87 and Y8, but not in any other
samples (Table 2). Y87 was mix-infected by TbCSV and
TYLCCNV, 2 alphasatellites (Y87A-2 and Y87A-7)
belonging to types 1 and 2, respectively, were identified.
Y8 was infected by TYLCCNV, 2 alphasatellites (Y8A-5
and Y8A-6) belonging to type 1 and sharing 85.0%
nucleotide acid identity were identified. Because of the
obvious divergence, we assumed that the 2 alphasatellites in Y8 were a consequence of a mixed infection by
2 distinct parental alphasatellites belonging to the same
type.

Discussion
Two single-stranded DNA components, alpha- and betasatellites, have been found to be associated with monopartite begomoviruses such as AYVV, CLCuMV, and
TbCSV [4,8,11,13,23]. Betasatellites are symptom-modulating satellite molecules that depend on a helper virus
for proliferation and movement. On the other hand,
alphasatellites are apparently dispensable for symptomatic induction and are capable of autonomous replication [12-14]. Our results show that the 33 alphasatellites
investigated are all associated with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes, which is a similar result to a report by
Briddon [11]. However, only some begomovirus/betasatellite complexes were associated with alphasatellites. A
better understanding of the relationship between alphasatellites and begomovirus/betasatellite complexes is
achievable if future studies concentrate on the identification of alphasatellites from more symptomatic and
asymptomatic crop species as well as diverse, agriculturally unimportant plant species from broader areas.
With the exception of Y89A, comparison of alphasatellites shows that they can be divided into 3 types.
Type 1 alphasatellites were identified in samples infected
by TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB and TYLCCNV/TYLCTHB +
TYLCTHV. Since no alphasatellites were found in samples infected by TYLCTHV/TYLCTHB, it is evident that
type 1 alphasatellites are associated with TYLCCNV/
TYLCCNB. All type 2 alphasatellites were identified in
samples infected by TbCSV/TbCSB, TbCSV/TbCSB +
TbLCYNV, TbCSV/TbCSB + TYLCCNV, and TbCSV +
TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB. Because no alphasatellites were
found in samples infected by TbLCYNV alone, this suggests that type 2 alphasatellites are associated with

TbCSV/TbCSB complexes. It is interesting that alphasatellites in sample Y146, which was mix-infected by
TbCSV and TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB, were clustered in
type 2 but not type 1. Sample Y146 might have been
mix-infected by TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB and TbCSV/
TbCSB in addition to alphasatellites associated with

TbCSV/TbCSB, TbCSB then disappeared due to competition between TYLCCNB and TbCSB [24]. Most type 3
alphasatellites were found in samples mix-infected by a
combination of TbCSV/AYVB and TbLCYNV or
MYVYNV/MYVYNB, while 2 type 3 alphasatellites were
mix-infected by TbCSV and MYVV/MYVB. Because no

alphasatellites were found in samples infected by
TbLCYNV, MYVYNV/MYVYNB, or MYVV/MYVB, it
is apparent that type 3 alphasatellites are associated with
TbCSV/AYVB. Although AYVCNV/AYVB is responsible
for ageratum yellow vein disease in Hainan, China [21],
AYVCNV was not found in any ageratum yellow vein
disease samples in Yunnan. Instead of AYVCNV/AYVB,
TbCSV/AYVB is the causal agents of ageratum yellow
vein disease (Zhou et al., unpublished). It is probable
that TbCSV acquires the heterogenous betasatellite,
AYVB, during mixed infections, but we were unable to
determine the origin of type 3 alphasatellites in this
study. Sample Y89 was infected by TYLCCNV/
TYLCCNB, therefore, its alphasatellite should belong to
type 1. However, sequence comparison shows that Y89A
shares only 69.3-79.5% nucleotide sequence identity

with other alphasatellites of the 3 types. We speculate
that Y89A originated from an unidentified begomovirus/
betasatellite complex.
Mix-infections of begomoviruses are common; 16 of
31 isolates in this study were co-infected by 2 begomoviruses (Table 2). For most isolates, each begomovirus is
associated with an alpha- and betasatellite. Two type 1
alphasatellites (Y8A-5 and Y8A-6) were identified in
sample Y8, while 2 types of alphasatellites (Y87A-7 and
Y87A-2) were identified in sample Y87. Our results indicate that mix-infections of alphasatellite molecules may
not be unusual.
The origin of alphasatellites is undoubtedly related to
nanoviruses. Presently, the function of alphasatellites is
not clear, but it is evident that alphasatellites functionally interact with geminivirus/betasatellite complexes

resulting in symptom alteration and a reduction in the
level of viral DNA and betasatellites [12-14,25,26] Available evidence suggests that the ubiquitous association of
alphasatellites with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes
indicates that alphasatellites may play an important role
in the occurrence, diffusion, and epidemiology of begomovirus/betasatellite complexes. More studies are
required to elucidate the specific role that alphasatellites
play in disease development, virus life cycle, and the
evolution of begomoviruses/betasatellite complexes.

of the Rep-encoding genes of the determined alphasatellites [27]. Betasatellites were tested by PCR using abutting primers beta01 (5′-GGTACCACTACGCTACG
CAGCAGCC-3′) and beta02 (5′-GGTACCTACCCTCCCAGGGGTACAC-3′) specific to betasatellites [28]. The
PCR products were recovered, purified, and cloned
using pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) as previously described [29]. Sequences were
determined using an automated DNA sequencing system (Model 377; Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA, USA).

Conclusions
Seven viruses, including TbCSV, TbLCYNV, TYLCCNV,
TYLCTHV, MYVV, MYVYNV, and SLCYNV, were
characterized in Yunnan Province–some of them are
associated with betasatellites. Our results show that all
samples from Yunnan that contained alphasatellites also
had betasatellites. However, only some samples that
contained betasatellites had alphasatellites. Thirty-three
sequenced alphasatellites were divided into 3 types–each
associated with a specific begomovirus/betasatellite complex. Type 1 was associated with TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB;
type 2 was associated with TbCSV/TbCSB; and type 3
was associated with TbCSV/AYVB. Alphasatellites have
3 highly conserved structure features: a conserved hairpin structure, a single open reading frame, and an Arich region. The alignment of the sequences of the conserved hairpin structure and the A-rich region shows
that the alphasatellites can be further divided into 3
types in accordance with the phylogenetic trees of their
complete nucleotide sequences. Reps encoded by the 33
alphasatellites are highly conserved and share more than
86.3% amino acid sequence identity. Alphasatellites may
play an important role in the epidemiology of begomovirus/betasatellite complexes.

Sequence analysis

Methods
Virus sources and DNA extraction

Young seedlings were collected from naturally infected
tobacco, tomato, Ageratum conyzoides, Malvastrum coromandelianum, and squash plants showing begomovirus-like infection symptoms, from locations separated
by 700 km in Yunnan Province, China from 1999 to
2004. Viral DNA from the samples was extracted as previously described [20].
PCR and sequence determination

Alphasatellite molecules were amplified by PCR with
one of 2 pairs of abutting primers DNA101 (5′-CTGCAGATAATGTAGCTTACCAG-3′)/DNA102 (5′-CTGC
AGATCCTCCACGTGTATAG-3′) or UN101 (5′-AA
GCTTGCGACTATTGTATGAAAGAGG-3′)/UN102
(5′-AAGCTTCGTCTGTCTTACGAGCTCGCTG-3′),
which were designed from the highly conserved regions

Sequence data were assembled and analyzed using
DNAStar software version 6.0 (DNAStar Inc., Madison,
WI, USA) and MEGA version 4 [30]. Sequence alignments were performed using the CLUSTAL V Multiple
Sequence Alignment program in DNAStar, and phylogenetic trees were conducted using the neighbor-joining
method using MEGA version 4. Other alphasatellite
sequences used for comparisons were alphasatellites of
Ageratum yellow vein virus (AYVA, AJ238493), Cotton
leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMA, AJ512957), Hibiscus
leaf curl virus (HLCA, AJ512959), Okra leaf curl virus
(OLCA, AJ512954), and Sida yellow vein Vietnam virus
(SiYVVNA, DQ641718). Nanovirus DNA sequences used
for comparisons were Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV
AF216221), Faba bean necrotic yellow virus (FBNYV,
X80879), Milk vetch dwarf virus (MVDV, AB000920),
and Subterranean clover stunt virus (SCSV, U16736).
