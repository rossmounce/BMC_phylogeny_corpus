Keywords: Mammalian COP1, ubiquitination, nuclear localization/import signal (NLS), nuclear export signal (NES), RING finger

Abstract
Background: Constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) has been defined as a central regulator
of photomorphogenic development in plants, which targets key transcription factors for
proteasome-dependent degradation. Although COP1 mammalian homologue has been previously
reported, its function and distribution in animal kingdom are not known.
Results: Here we report the characterization of full-length human and mouse COP1 cDNAs and
the genomic structures of the COP1 genes from several different species. Mammalian COP1 protein
binds to ubiquitinated proteins in vivo and is itself ubiquitinated. Furthermore, mammalian COP1
is predominately nuclear localized and exists primarily as a complex of over 700 kDa. Through
mutagenesis studies, we have defined a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) within the coiledcoil domain of mammalian COP1 and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is composed of two
clusters of positive-charged amino acids, bridged by the RING finger. Disruption of the RING finger
structure abolishes the nuclear import, while deletion of the entire RING finger restores the
nuclear import.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that mammalian COP1, similar to its plant homologue, may play a
role in ubiquitination. Mammalian COP1 contains a classic leucine-rich NES and a novel bipartite
NLS bridged by a RING finger domain. We propose a working model in which the COP1 RING
finger functions as a structural scaffold to bring two clusters of positive-charged residues within
spatial proximity to mimic a bipartite NLS. Therefore, in addition to its well-characterized role in
ubiquitination, the RING finger domain may also play a structural role in nuclear import.

Background
Arabidopsis seedlings display distinct morphologies
when grown in the dark compared to the light. Light-

grown seedlings develop photomorphogenically, characterized by short hypocotyls and open green cotyledons. In
contrast, dark-grown seedlings undergo skotomorpho-

genesis (or etiolation), typified by elongated hypocotols
and closed cotyledons [1]. COP1 was first identified
through genetic screens as a negative regulator of light regulated development in Arabidopsis [2]. Arabidopsis cop1
mutant seedlings are constitutively photomorphogenic
even when grown in the dark, and the severe cop1 mutants
cause lethality in the late seedling stage, indicating that
COP1 is essential for plant development [2,3]. Arabidopsis COP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana COP1, AtCOP1) is essential for the proteasome-dependent degradation of two
transcription factors, HY5 and HYH [4,5]. These two homologous bZIP-type transcription factors directly interact
with AtCOP1 and are capable of binding to light-responsive promoters to activate the transcription of many target
genes [5,6]. Genome wide micro-array analysis shows that
AtCOP1 regulates most, if not all, of the light-responsive
genes under various light conditions [7,8], substantiating
the notion that AtCOP1 functions as a crucial developmental switch through targeting key transcription factors
for degradation, thereby controlling the light-responsive
gene expression and photomorphogenic development.
AtCOP1 contains three conserved structural domains: a
RING finger at the amino terminus, a coiled-coil domain
in the middle, and a carboxyl-terminal WD40 repeat domain [9,10]. Each of the three conserved domains has
been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions [11–
13]. The subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated
by light in a tissue specific manner [14,15]. The hypocotyl
cell nuclei contain high levels of COP1 in the dark and reduced levels in the light, suggesting that the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of AtCOP1 is adjusted by a lightresponsive mechanism [14,16]. The activity of AtCOP1 is
at least in part regulated by its subcellular localization, as
the degradation of HY5 is dependent upon the nuclear accumulation of AtCOP1 in the dark [4]. AtCOP1 was demonstrated to carry a single, bipartite nuclear localization
signal located between the coiled-coil domain and the
WD-40 domain (amino acid 294–314) and a cytoplasmic
localization signal, which was mapped to a region partially overlapping with the RING finger and the coiled-coil
domain (amino acid 67–117) [17]. Strikingly, AtCOP1
protein forms characteristic nuclear speckles when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells or stably expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis [6,18]. The functional
role of these speckles is currently unknown; however, a
subnuclear localization signal consisting of 58 residues
(amino acid 120–177) is required for their formation
[19].
A partial cDNA clone homologous to AtCOP1 has been
previously identified in mammals, containing all three
conserved protein-protein interaction domains [20]. Remarkably, when expressed in plant cells, the mammalian
COP1-reporter fusion protein exhibited a light-regulated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/30

nuclear localization pattern similar to AtCOP1 [20]. Although mammalian COP1 failed to rescue the Arabidopsis cop1 mutants, over-expression of the amino-terminal
half of mammalian COP1 in Arabidopsis caused a dominant-negative phenotype, resembling the effect of over-expressing the corresponding fragment of AtCOP1 [20,21].
To understand the function of COP1 in animals, we conducted an initial molecular characterization of mammalian COP1 homologues. We report here the cloning of the
full-length mouse and human COP1 cDNAs (Mus musculus COP1, MmCOP1; Homo sapiens COP1, HsCOP1) and
the comparison of COP1 homologues from both animals
and plants in terms of both protein sequences and genomic structures. Moreover, we show that mammalian
COP1 is associated with ubiquitinated proteins in vivo
and itself a substrate of ubiquitination. Finally, examination of the subcellular localization patterns of the mammalian COP1 reveals a unique type of nuclear import
signal and a classic nuclear export signal, which might be
important for regulation of the mammalian COP1 activity.

Results
Characterization of full-length cDNAs of mouse and human COP1s
The previously reported partial MmCOP1 mRNA (GenBank accession number AF151110.1) encodes a protein
product that corresponds to the full-length AtCOP1, but
without the ATG start codon at its 5' end [20]. Homology
search against the updated public EST database with the 5'
end sequence of the available partial MmCOP1 cDNA allowed the identification of human and mouse EST clones
containing a predicted starting codon and a partial 5' UTR,
and the subsequent construction of full-length MmCOP1
and HsCOP1 cDNAs (see Experimental procedures for details). The presence of stop codons just upstream of the
predicted start codons and their comparable sizes with
mRNA on northern blots (data not shown) suggest that
they contain full-length coding capacity. The full-length
MmCOP1 and HsCOP1 cDNAs (GenBank accession numbers AF151110.2 and AF508940) encode polypeptides of
773 and 771 amino acids respectively and share 97.4%
identity (Fig 1A and data not shown). Compared to
AtCOP1, the predicted full-length MmCOP1 and
HsCOP1 proteins contain unique N-terminal glycine-serine rich extensions of about 70 amino acids (Fig. 1A).

The mammalian COP1 is expressed in many different tissues and organs in both embryos and adults, based on the
available EST information. Mammalian COP1 EST clones
have been found in aorta, B-cell, bladder, brain, breast,
cervix, colon, germ cell, head/neck, heart, kidney, liver,
lung, myotube, nerve, ovary, parathyroid, placenta, prostate, single cell zygote, spleen, testis, T-cell, tonsil, unferti-

The phylogenetic tree is constructed by ClustalW software [57], using protein sequences corresponding to the first 200 amino
acids of HsCOP1. The protein sequence of HsCOP1 (human) is available under GenBank accession number AF508940. The
protein sequence of MmCOP1 (mouse) is available under GenBank accession number AF151110. The partial protein sequence
of XlCOP1 (xenopus) was predicted from four xenopus EST clones (GenBank accession number BE506274, BE679680,
BE026293 and BG345699). The partial protein sequence of GgCOP1 (chicken) was predicted from one chicken EST clone
(GenBank accession number BM487594). The partial protein sequence of DrCOP1 (zebrafish) was predicted from one EST
clone (GenBank accession number AI959013). The partial protein sequence of FrCOP1 (fugu) was predicted from scaffold
5023 of the draft fugu genomic sequence. The protein sequence of AgCOP1 (mosquito) was predicted from the scaffold
CRA_x9P1GAV59LQ of the draft mosquito genomic sequence. The protein sequences of AtCOP1 (Arabidopsis), PsCOP1

searches against the draft human genome database re-

FrCOP1). The genomic structures of the vertebrate COP1
genes appear to be generally conserved among themselves, but different from mosquito and plant COP1 genes
(data not shown).
BLAST searches also have identified COP1 homologues
from many other animal species, including zebrafish,
frog, chicken, rat, cow, dog, horse, and pig. However, we
have so far failed to find COP1 homologues in Drosophila, C. elegans, or yeast, whose whole genome sequences
are available. It is interesting that COP1 is not found in
Drosophila but in mosquito.

associates to ubiquitinated proteins in vivo. Lysates from 293

antibody as indicated.

vealed significant hits on chromosomes 1, 3, 9 and 18. Because only the homologous sequences on chromosome 1
match 100% with the HsCOP1 cDNA, we conclude that
the functional human COP1 gene (designated HsCOP1) is
located on chromosome 1q24.1 (Fig 1B), and the homologous sequences from chromosome 3, 9 and 18 probably
represent COP1 pseudogenes, as they all seem to encode
truncated proteins. The corresponding sequenced BAC
clones on this chromosomal location (GenBank accession
numbers AL359265, AL162736, AL590723, and
AL513329) can be assembled together with the reference
of HsCOP1 cDNA sequences (Fig 1B). The HsCOP1 gene
contains 20 exons and the transcribed region is about 263
kb in length (GenBank accession number TPA:
BK000438, Fig 1B). We were also able to identify the fulllength genomic sequence of mosquito COP1 (Anopheles
gambiae COP1, AgCOP1) and partial genomic sequences
of MmCOP1 and fugu COP1 (Fugu rubripes COP1,

Sequence comparison reveals that the three structural motifs present in Arabidopsis COP1, including the RING finger, the coiled coil and the WD40 domains, exist in COP1
proteins from all other species. The glycine-serine rich Nterminal sequence appears to be unique to vertebrate
COP1s, as it is missing in mosquito and plant COP1 proteins. However, it should be pointed out that the amino
acids in this region are not well conserved and their functional role in vertebrates is unclear.
To reveal their evolutionary relationship, we generated a
phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of
the N-terminal RING finger containing fragments (all corresponding to the first 200 amino acids of HsCOP1) from
representative COP1 homologues, as only partial COP1
sequences are available in the public database for some
species. Similar phylogenetic trees were generated with or
without the vertebrate specific N-terminal extensions, and
a tree with the extension included in the analysis is shown
in Fig 1C. As expected, plant and animal COP1s form distinct clades, and the homologies between COP1s from
different species are in general consistency with evolutionary distances of these species (Fig 1C).
The association of mammalian COP1 with ubiquitinated
proteins in vivo
A number of RING finger proteins have recently been
shown to act as E3 ubiquitin ligases [24]. WD40 domains
have also been frequently found in E3 complexes as substrate recruiting domains [25–28]. Despite compelling evidence from Arabidopsis implying that COP1 may
mediate protein degradation [4,5], no direct evidence of
COP1 participating in ubiquitination has been reported.

As an initial step to study a possible role of mammalian
COP1 in ubiquitination, we transiently expressed FLAGtagged COP1 (FLAG-COP1) in human cell line 293 together with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), followed by
immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-HA
antibodies detected multiple distinct bands and smear
only when FLAG-COP1 and HA-Ub were co-expressed, in-

dicating that at least a subset of COP1 associated proteins
are ubiquitinated in human cells (Fig. 2A).
To further investigate whether COP1 itself undergoes
ubiquitination, a His-tagged ubiquitin expression construct (His-Ub) was co-transfected into the 293 cells with
FLAG-COP1, followed by His purification under denaturing condition (in 8 M Urea). Under this condition, only
those proteins covalently linked to His-Ub would be copurified. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with
anti-FLAG antibodies detected a higher molecular weight
smear only upon co-expression of FLAG-COP1 and HisUb, therefore confirming that COP1 is indeed a ubiquitination substrate (Fig. 2B). Similar data were obtained
when a deletion construct FLAG-N280 contains an intact
RING finger domain was used (see late in Fig 5A). Though
FLAG-N280 was not as heavily ubiquitinated as the fulllength FLAG-COP1, it clearly showed a ladder pattern, in
which the size difference between neighboring bands of
the ladder was consistent with the unit molecular weight
of His-Ub (Fig. 2B). Therefore, mammalian COP1 not
only associates with ubiquitinated proteins in vivo, but
also itself a substrate for multi-ubiquitination.
The mammalian COP1 protein is localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm
The subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated by
light [14], a feature that is critical for its function [4,29].
Interestingly, the localization of mammalian COP1 protein expressed in plant cells can also be regulated by light
[20], implicating a similar mechanism may operate for
the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of COP1 in mammalian cells.

To investigate this possibility, we first set out to examine
the subcellular localization of endogenous COP1 in cultured mammalian cells. Polyclonal antibodies against a
N-terminal fragment of MmCOP1 (amino acid 71–270)
were generated in rabbits and affinity purified. Endogenous COP1 is not detectable by immuno-fluorescence
with our anti-COP1 antibodies, probably due to a very
low expression level. Instead we took a subcellular fractionation approach to study the localization pattern of endogenous COP1 protein. The purified anti-COP1
antibodies detected a unique band of about 90 kDa from
HeLa whole cell lysates, compared to the preimmune serum (Fig 3A). This 90-kDa band should represent the endogenous COP1 based on the observations that antiCOP1 antibodies harvested from two other rabbits detect
the same molecular weight band (Fig 3A) and RNAi
against COP1 can specifically reduce the level of this band
(our unpublished data). After subcellular fractionation
with HeLa cells, each fraction underwent immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-COP1
antibodies. As shown in Fig 3B, the endogenous COP1 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/30

localized predominantly in the nucleus, but small
amount may also be present in the cytosol. Within the nucleus, COP1 is present in both the nucleoplasm (NP) and
the nuclear envelope (NE) fractions, although COP1 is
more enriched in the nucleoplasm (Fig 3B). Identical
samples from all fractions were also probed with antibodies against other control proteins (Fig. 3B). As expected,
Lamin A and C, components of nuclear lamina, were
found predominantly in the NE fraction (Fig 3B). This
fraction was also highly enriched in nuclear pore complexes, as evidenced by the enrichment of Nup62. Nup62
was detectable in smaller amounts in the cytosol and NP
fractions as well (Fig 3B), consistent with its cellular distribution described previously [30]. On the other hand,
Hsp110 was found predominantly in the cytosol fraction,
while Hsp90 was found both in the cytosol and the NP
fractions (Fig 3B). Two subunits of the COP9 signalosome, CSN2 and CSN6, were located both in the cytosol
and the NP fractions, but not in the NE fractions (Fig 3B).
These controls thus validated our fractionation results on
COP1 subcellular distribution.
As another line of experiments, we generated expression
constructs containing N-terminal GFP- and FLAG-tagged
MmCOP1 and HsCOP1. As shown in Fig. 3C, the subcellular localization pattern of GFP-COP1 varies when expressed in COS7 cells. In general, their localization
patterns can be categorized into three types. In Type I cells,
GFP-COP1 is expressed mostly in the cytoplasm, with
some enrichment around the nucleus (Fig 3C, Type I). In
Type II cells, GFP-COP1 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and also on the NE (Fig 3C, Type
II). In the third type, GFP-COP1 protein is expressed
mostly in the nucleus, both in the NP and on the NE (Fig
3C, Type III). All three types of localization patterns are
well represented among the transfected cells; their relative
proportions vary in each experiment, but do not seem to
correlate with the expression level of GFP-COP1. Similar
results were obtained when other cell lines (including
HeLa, NIH3T3, and CHO cell lines) were used or immuno-fluorescence studies were carried out with FLAG-COP1
instead of GFP-COP1 (data not shown).
The full-length mammalian COP1 protein can localize to
the nuclear envelope
To test if COP1 is tightly bound to the NE, we extracted
cells with 1% Triton X-100 before fixation. This treatment
was shown to remove non-NE bound proteins from both
the cytoplasm and the nucleus [31]. Indeed after Triton
extraction, GFP-COP1 protein was completely eliminated
from the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (Fig 3C, +Triton). Only NE-bound GFP-COP1 protein was retained, as
characterized by a distinct RING-like pattern around the
nucleus. On the other hand, GFP control was completely
removed from the cells by the same treatment (data not

shown), indicating that the retaining of GFP-COP1 on the
NE is mediated by COP1 and not by the GFP tag. Similarly, FLAG-COP1 is also remained on the NE after Triton extraction (data not shown). The different localization
patterns in different populations of cells imply that mammalian COP1 may partition among the NP, NE, and cytoplasm compartments.
Human COP1 is part of protein complexes of over 700
kDa
Because HsCOP1 is enriched in the nucleoplasm fraction
(Fig 3B), we used this fraction from HeLa cells for a gel filtration analysis to examine possible form(s) of HsCOP1
in human cells. Endogenous HsCOP1 was found to accumulate primarily in large complexes of over 700 kDa,
whereas no monomeric or dimeric form of HsCOP1 was
detected (Fig 4). This finding is distinct from the observation for AtCOP1, which exists mainly as a homodimer
[32]. In addition, the HsCOP1 complexes differ from the
HsCOP9 signalosome complexes in size, as suggested by
the different peak fractions (Fig 4). Finally, transiently expressed FLAG or GFP tagged HsCOP1 or MmCOP1 cofractionates with endogenous COP1 (data not shown),
suggesting the behaviors of these fusion proteins most
likely represent the endogenous function of COP1 protein.
Both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic localization signals
of the mammalian COP1 are present in the N-terminal region
As a first step to locate the signals responsible for the subcellular localization of mammalian COP1, we made a series of deletion constructs of GFP-MmCOP1 (Fig 5A). As
shown in figure 5A and 5B, GFP-∆N70 (amino acid 71–
733), which deleted the vertebrate specific N-terminal extension, also exhibited three general localization patterns
in transfected cells, mostly cytoplasmic, in both compartments, or mostly nuclear, similar to full-length GFPCOP1 (Fig 3C). However, GFP-∆N70 does not display NE

localization pattern, indicating that the first 70 amino
acid of glycine-serine rich region may be responsible for
targeting MmCOP1 to the NE (Fig 5A and 5B). Similarly,
AtCOP1 does not contain this region and is not located to
NE [14].
Unlike GFP-∆N70, GFP-∆RING (amino acid 226–773)
was only found in the cytoplasm in all the cells examined
(Fig 5A and 5B), suggesting that the NLS of MmCOP1 is
probably located within amino acid 71 to 226 of
MmCOP1. GFP-N346 (amino acid 71–416) contains the
RING finger, the coiled-coil domain, and the region corresponding to the AtCOP1 NLS [17] and is localized exclusively in the nucleus, forming distinctive nuclear speckles
(Fig 5A and 5B). GFP-N280 (amino acid 71–350), which
contains the RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, but
not the sequence corresponding to the NLS in AtCOP1, is
also solely localized in the nucleus (Fig 5A and 5B). However, unlike GFP-N346, GFP-N280 does not form speckles
(Fig 5B). These results show that the region from amino
acid 351 to 416 is not necessary for nuclear localization
but contains a signal for speckle formation. It is worth
noting that deletion constructs of AtCOP1 covering the
corresponding region were found localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, distinct from the mouse GFP-N280
fusion proteins [17].
In contrast to GFP-N346 and GFP-N280, GFP-N200 (amino acid 71–270), which contains an intact RING finger
and a partial coiled-coil domain, is localized entirely in
the cytoplasm (Fig 5A and 5B). Similar observations were
made when other cell lines were used (HeLa, NIH3T3 and
CHO cells) or by using FLAG-tagged construct series instead of GFP fusions (data not shown). Taken together,
both the major nuclear and cytoplasmic localization signals seem to reside in the N-terminal region of MmCOP1,
most likely between amino acid 71 and 350.

Identification of a classic leucine-rich nuclear export signal
in mammalian COP1
Because both GFP-N200 and GFP-∆RING are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic localization

signal is probably located within the overlapping region
of these two constructs (amino acid 226–270). Interestingly, a sequence (LANVNLMLELL, amino acids 237 to
247), located within the N-terminal region of the coiled-

coil domain, matches classic leucine-rich nuclear export
signals (NES), such as those from Rex and PKI (Fig 6A)
[33,34]. In order to test if this sequence is a bona fide NES,
we made mutations at two conserved leucine residues
(L234A and L236A) in the GFP-N200 construct (Fig 6A).
The mutant protein GFP-N200NESmut, in contrast to wildtype GFP-N200, is entirely nuclear localized (Fig 6B). Furthermore, treatment of wild-type GFP-N200 with CRM1/

exportin specific inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) also causes the protein to be localized exclusively in the nucleus
(Fig 6B). These results confirmed the identified sequence
(LANVNLMLELL) within the coiled-coil domain of mammalian COP1 as a likely CRM1/exportin specific NES. Notably, the corresponding site in AtCOP1 is within the
mapped cytoplasmic localization sequence [17]. Moreover, the NLS must also be located within amino acids 71

to 270 of MmCOP1, since NES-mutated or LMB-treated
N200 is nuclear localized (Fig 6B).

proteins are located in cytoplasmic speckles similar to the
N346NLSmut1 and N346NLSmut3 (Fig 7B).

Identification of amino acid clusters critical for mammalian COP1 nuclear import and speckle formation
Nuclear import/localization signals (NLS) are usually
composed of one or two clusters of positively charged
amino acids. To map the nuclear import signal in mammalian COP1, we first identified three clusters of positively charged amino acids within the amino acid 71–270 for
mutagenesis. Furthermore, we also chose to mutate a
forth positively charged amino acid cluster at amino acid
358 to 360, which corresponds to the Arabidopsis COP1
NLS [17]. Since GFP-N346 exhibited clear and consistent
nuclear localized pattern with speckles most resembling
the full-length MmCOP1 nuclear localization pattern, it
was used as the starting point for the site-directed mutagenesis studies (Fig 7A).

The RING fingers are characterized by four conserved
cysteine-cysteine or cysteine-histidine pairs, which bind to
two zinc molecules [[35,36]; Fig 7C]. In particular,
cysteine pair 1 and pair 3 bind to one zinc, while cysteinehistidine pair 2 and cysteine pair 4 bind to the other zinc,
thereby forming a unique cross-brace structure [[36]; Fig
7C]. Cysteine-histidine pair 2 and cysteine pair 3 are separated by two amino acids. Although the sequences other
than the zinc binding sites are not well conserved, the
overall three dimensional structures of all the characterized RING fingers are overwhelmingly similar, due to the
conserved spacing between cysteine-histidine pair 2 and
cysteine pair 3 and the tight zinc binding ability [37–42].
One common feature is that the RING finger structure
brings the flanking N and C-peptides close together. So
possibly, the role of COP1 RING finger in nuclear import
is to function as structural scaffold by bringing the two
clusters of positively charged amino acids (site 1 and site
3) within the right spatial proximity to fit into the binding
sites of the nuclear import machinery, as illustrated by Fig
7C.

Unlike wild-type GFP-N346, GFP-N346NLSmut1 (R113S/
K114N) and GFP-N346NLSmut3 (K205T/R206S/K208T)
are totally localized to the cytoplasm, still forming speckles (Fig 7B). GFP-N346NLSmut2 (K197N/K199N/R201S) is
still localized to nucleus speckles, similar to wild-type
GFP-N346 (Fig 7B). Comparable results were attained
when the same mutations were introduced into GFPN280 fusion protein (data not shown). Mutations of the
fourth site (R358S/K360T) within GFP-N346, GFPN346NLSmut4, do not change the nuclear localization of
GFP-N346, but abolish the speckles (Fig 7B). Consistent
with this, GFP-N280, which does not contain site 4, does
not form nuclear speckles (Fig 5B and 7B). These results
demonstrate both sites 1 and 3 are required for nuclear
import, while site 4 is important for targeting N346 to the
nuclear speckles. However, we do not know the functional
significance of the nuclear speckles at this time. Further,
we do not know whether the cytoplasmic speckles formed
by GFP-N346NLSmut1 and GFP-N346NLSmut3 are in any
way related to the nuclear speckles of wild-type GFPN346.
A novel RING finger bridged bipartite nuclear localization
signal is responsible for mammalian COP1 nuclear localization
In a typical bipartite NLS, the distance between the two
clusters of positively charged amino acids is usually
around 10 amino acids. However, the distance between
site 1 and site 3 in GFP-N346 is more than 90 amino acids
apart, separated by the RING finger domain (Fig 7A). To
determine whether the RING finger plays a role in mediating nuclear import, we mutated two key zinc-binding
cysteine residues at the RING finger domain of GFP-N346
(C158A/C161A, N346RINGmut) to destroy the RING finger structure (Fig 7A). Indeed, these mutations abolish the
nuclear localization of GFP-N346 (Fig 7B). The mutated

To test this hypothesis, we deleted the RING finger in
GFP-N346 (∆119–197) and physically put the site 1 and
site 3 within a distance of 10 amino acids (Figure 7A). This
mutant protein, GFP-N346∆RING, maintained the same
localization pattern as wild-type GFP-N346 protein (Fig
7B). Therefore, mammalian COP1 appears to contain a
novel nuclear import signal, composed of two clusters of
positively charged amino acids bridged by a RING finger.

Discussion
Evidence for a role of COP1 in protein ubiquitination in
vivo
Because of its role in mediating the degradation of HY5,
HYH, and possibly other transcription factors in Arabidopsis [4,5] and the presence of a RING finger domain
and a WD-40 domain, AtCOP1 has been proposed to
function as a RING-finger type ubiquitination E3 ligase,
by recruiting E2 through its RING-finger domain and
binding to the substrates through the WD-40 repeats
[4,43]. This hypothesis is also supported by the findings
about other negative regulators of plant photomorphogenesis. COP10, which has been shown to interact with
AtCOP1 in yeast two-hybrid experiment, encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) variant [44]. The COP9
signalosome, an eight-subunit complex homologous to
the lid subcomplex of the 26 S proteasome [45], directly
associates with SCF E3 complex and promotes deneddylation of the cullin subunit of SCF in both plant and animal
cells [46–49]. The exact relationship between COP1 and
the COP9 signalosome remains obscure; it is known,

however, that in Arabidopsis the COP9 signalosome is required for COP1 to accumulate in the nucleus in the dark
[29]. Although COP1 most likely plays a role in regulating
protein degradation, attempts in reconstituting ubiquitination of HY5 by AtCOP1 have been unsuccessful. Instead, CIP8, an AtCOP1 interacting RING-H2 finger
protein, is found to ubiquitinate HY5 in vitro [50,51].
Therefore, it is possible that COP1 may recruit other RING
finger proteins, such as CIP8, to mediate the ubiquitination of specific substrates. The existence of mammalian
COP1 in large complex forms is consistent with this possibility. In this study, we have demonstrated the mammalian COP1 is associated with ubiquitinated proteins and
itself a substrate for ubiquitination in vivo. However, we
have failed to reconstitute the ubiquitination activity of
mammalian COP1 in vitro. Purification of the mammalian COP1 complex may hold a key to understand how
COP1 mediates protein ubiquitination and degradation
in the cells.
Molecular basis for mammalian COP1 subcellular localization and its possible regulation
Endogenous mammalian COP1 is found in the cytosol,
NP, and NE fractions in our subcellular fractionation
study, with majority of the protein in the NP fraction (Fig
4A). In our fluorescence localization studies with multiple
mammalian cell lines, transiently over-expressed COP1 is
prevalent in the cytoplasm, but also on the NE and within
the nucleus (Fig 4B). This discrepancy is probably due to
the over-expression of mammalian COP1 in the latter system. It is worth noting that endogenous COP1 appears to
be expressed at very low levels in all of the mammalian
cells we have tested.

Through systematic mutagenesis studies, we have been
able to locate both the NLS and the NES to the N-terminal
region of the mammalian COP1 protein (Fig 6 and Fig 7).
Deletion constructs, GFP-N346, GFP-N280 and GFPN200, all contain both the NLS and the NES, but their
subcellular localization patterns are strikingly different.
GFP-N346 and GFP-N280 are localized exclusively to the
nucleus, while GFP-N200 is localized entirely to the cytoplasm (Fig 5). However, treatment with LMB completely
shifts GFP-N200 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, implying GFP-N200 may shuttle between the nucleus and
the cytoplasm, consistent with the existence of both the
NES and the NLS in GFP-N200 (Fig 6 and Fig 7). The different domain compositions of GFP-346, GFP-N280 and
GFP-N200 may explain the distinct localization patterns
of these mutant proteins. NES is located within the coiledcoil domain (Fig 6), so it is plausible that the intact coiledcoil structure in GFP-N346 or GFP-N280 masks the NES,
possibly through interactions with other proteins. On the
other hand, the truncated coiled-coil domain in GFPN200 is unable to shield the NES from binding to CRM1/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/30

exportin. Since GFP-N200 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm, the NES is likely dominant over the NLS in
mammalian COP1 protein. It is tempting to speculate
that, under certain conditions, the mammalian COP1
NES is shielded within the coiled-coil structure and COP1
protein is imported into the nucleus through the RING
finger bridged NLS; under other conditions, probably
through a conformation change of the coiled-coil domain, the NES is exposed, overwriting the NLS and transporting mammalian COP1 back into the cytoplasm.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a second
set of unidentified NLS between amino acid 271–350 may
be responsible for the nuclear localization of GFP-N280
and GFP-N346.
This study reveals a novel type of nuclear localization signal within the mammalian COP1 N-terminal region, consisting of a two clusters of positively charged amino acids
bridged by a RING finger domain (Fig 7). Both clusters of
positively charged amino acids are required and can function as a classic bipartite NLS when placed within the right
distance (Fig 7). Disrupting the structure of the RING finger abolishes nuclear import, but removing the entire
RING finger restores nuclear import (Fig 7).
A RING finger sandwiched between a bipartite NLS could
provide additional regulatory mechanisms for nuclear import. In order to be transported into the nucleus, it is necessary for a protein to bind to the nuclear import
machinery, such as importin α/β, through its NLS. Our
studies suggest the mammalian COP1 RING finger acts as
a structural scaffold by placing the two clusters of positive
residues within the right spatial proximity for binding to
the nuclear import machinery. Since the RING finger is a
protein-protein interaction domain, interaction of the
mammalian COP1 RING finger with another protein
may, under certain conditions, trigger a conformational
change of the surrounding peptides, altering the proximity between the two positive residue clusters of the NLS to
disrupt binding to the nuclear import machinery. Alternatively, recruitment of another protein to the mammalian
COP1 RING finger may sterically hinder access of its NLS
to the nuclear import machinery.
RING finger – ubiquitination and/or subcellular localization?
Within the past few years, the RING finger motif has
emerged as a core structure feature for many ubiquitin
ligases (E3s) [52]. In most cases, RING fingers function as
E2 recruiting domains, and by directly interacting with
E2s, bring E2s in the vicinity of ubiquitination substrates,
which bind to other parts of the RING finger proteins or
other subunits of the RING finger protein containing
complexes. Although most evidence suggests that RING
fingers may not directly participate in the enzymatic trans-

ferring of ubiquitin from E2s to the substrates, intact
RING structures are essential for this function. In addition
to the key roles in E3 ligase activity, RING finger domains
have also been shown to be important for regulating subcellular localization of E3s and/or their substrates in a
number of cases [53–56]. Studies have shown the MDM2
RING finger domain is required to promote nuclear export of p53 and this activity of MDM2 RING finger seems
to be coupled with its ability to promote ubiquitination of
p53 [53–55]. Rbx1/ROC1, the small RING finger subunit
of the SCF E3 complexes, promotes the nuclear accumulation of Cul1, another subunit of the SCF complexes [56].
These studies have suggested a correlation between the
ubiquitination activities of RING fingers and their roles in
regulating subcellular localization of the E3 ligases which
they are part of.
Our results suggest that mammalian COP1 might play a
role in ubiquitination (Fig 2). If COP1 is indeed an E3, its
RING finger is likely to be indispensable for this function,
considering the numerous examples of other RING fingers. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated that
the RING finger is required for the nuclear localization of
mammalian COP1 (Fig 7). Thus, COP1 RING finger
could also play dual roles in ubiquitination as well as nuclear import.
Distinction in subcellular localization signals between
higher plant and mammalian COP1 proteins
Comparison of the subcellular localization signals uncovers clear distinctions between AtCOP1 and MmCOP1. In
AtCOP1, the sequence responsible for the cytoplasmic localization is mapped to the region bordering both the
RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, composed of
110 amino acids [[17]; Fig 8]. In MmCOP1, we have identified a single 10-amino acid classic leucine-rich NES within the corresponding region (Fig 8), even though we have
not eliminated the possible involvement of other sequences. The mammalian COP1 also has a unique N-terminal extension that seems to involve in localizing the
protein into the nuclear envelope (Fig 8). We have defined
MmCOP1 NLS as a RING finger mediated bipartite NLS
variant, which is composed of 96 amino acids surrounding the RING finger domain (Fig 8). In contrast, the
AtCOP1 NLS has been identified as a classic bipartite nuclear localization signal, consisting of 21 amino acids in
the intermediate region of coiled-coil domain and the
WD-40 domain [[17]; Fig 8]. Interestingly in MmCOP1,
the site matching the AtCOP1 NLS is found to be important for targeting the nuclear localized MmCOP1 deletion
construct N346 to speckles rather than mediating nuclear
import (Fig 8). On the other hand, the site responsible for
speckle formation is mapped within the cytoplasmic localization signal in AtCOP1 [[19]; Fig 8]. One explanation
for these discrepancies between AtCOP1 and MmCOP1 is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/30

that during the course of evolution, the animal and the
plant COP1 proteins have adopted different regulatory
mechanisms and probably different physiological and developmental functions. However, the protein sequences
of the three major protein-protein interactive domains
(RING, Coiled coil, WD-40 repeats) are highly conserved,
possibly due to conserved biochemical activity of COP1
in all organisms. Another possibility is that different cell
types may use completely different subcellular targeting
signals. It is plausible that in some other mammalian cell
types, subcellular targeting signals similar to Arabidopsis
may be used. This speculation would be consistent with
the fact that the subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated by light only in certain types of plant cells [14]. Furthermore, the protein fragments responsible for
regulating subcellular localization of AtCOP1 are quite
conserved in MmCOP1, which may explain why the
mammalian COP1, when expressed in onion epidermal
cells, can be regulated by light in a similar manner as
AtCOP1 [20]. However, the same nuclear translocation
signal of AtCOP1 has been used in all plant cell types examined [17,19], which argue against the later hypothesis.

Conclusions
In this study, we cloned the full-length mouse and human
COP1 cDNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mammalian COP1 is associated with ubiquitinated proteins in
vivo and itself a substrate of ubiquitination. Finally,
through subcellular localization studies, we identified a
unique type of nuclear import signal and a classic nuclear
export signal within the N-terminal region of mammalian
COP1, which might be important for regulation of the
mammalian COP1 activity.

Methods
DNA constructs
To obtain the full-length MmCOP1 cDNA, an EST clone
(GenBank accession number AI509164) containing the
N-terminal region of MmCOP1 cDNA in pT7T3D-Pac vector was obtained from ResGen and digested with XhoI
and Hind III. The resulting fragment was subcloned into
the same sites of pBlueScript II KS (+). The resulting construct was further digested with NotI and PstI and combined with a NotI-PstI fragment containing the remaining
c-terminal portion of a previously described MmCOP1
cDNA clone (GenBank accession number AF151110.1)
[20], resulting in pKS-COP1. To generate pEGFP-COP1,
pKS-COP1 was digested with ApaI and XbaI and the resulting fragment containing the MmCOP1 cDNA was subcloned into the same sites of the pEGFP I vector. The
pFLAG-COP1 was generated by subcloning a SalI-XbaI
fragment of pEGFP-COP1 containing the MmCOP1 cDNA
into the same sites of pFLAG-CMV II vector. Direct sequencing was used to ensure in-frame insertions of these
constructs. pEGFP-N280 and pFLAG-N280 were generat-

acid 70–350 of MmCOP1; StyI site was filled in by Klenow DNA polymerase) into pEGFP and pFLAG-CMV vectors digested by HindIII and SmaI. pEGFP-N346 was
generated by inserting a HindIII-NdeI fragment (containing amino acid 70–416 of MmCOP1; NdeI site was filled
in by Klenow DNA polymerase) into pEGFP vector digested by HindIII and SmaI. pEGFP-N280 was digested with
EcoRI and BamHI, filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase
on both ends, and re-ligated to generate pEGFP-N200.
Point mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
pEGFP-N346∆RING was obtained by first introducing two
XhoI sites into the construct, subsequently digesting with
XhoI, and then re-ligating. The plasmids HA-Ub and HisUb were described previously [22].
Genomic DNA and mRNA predications
The genomic sequences of different COP1 orthologs were
identified by BLASTn search with HsCOP1 or MmCOP1
cDNA sequence, or by tBLASTn search with HsCOP1 protein sequence in the following genomic blast sites: [http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/HsBlast.html] for
human genome; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/
seq/MmBlast.html] for mouse genome; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/agambiae.html]
for
mosquito; and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
fugu.html] for fugu genome.

Full-length or partial cDNA sequences of the COP1 homologues in human, rat, cow, pig, Xenopus, chicken, and zebrafish were predicted by assembling the available
homologous EST sequences from each species. A single
EST clone (GenBank accession number BI461685) con-

taining the full-length HsCOP1 open reading frame was
obtained from ResGen and the coding region of HsCOP1
was sequenced. Eight EST clones from Rattus norvegicus
(GenBank accession number AI071032, AW525130,
BF560126, R47114, AW141780, BF285727, AW917150,
and BF285717) were assembled into a near full-length rat
COP1 cDNA (RnCOP1). Partial cow COP1 cDNA
(BtCOP1) was predicted from six Bos taurus ESTs (GenBank accession number AV608813, AW462260;
BE478862, BF042569; AW326433 and BF440399). Only
one EST clone (GenBank accession number AW787013)
was found from the pig (Sus scrofa) to be homologous to
the HsCOP1 3-prime end. A zebrafish EST clone (GenBank accession number AI959013) was found homologous to the N terminal end of HsCOP1. Four EST clones
from Xenopus laevis were identified through blast search
against the HsCOP1 protein sequence. Of them, three
were overlapping clones and were assembled into a fragment homologous to the N-terminal region of the
HsCOP1 protein (GenBank accession number BE506274,
BE679680, and BE026293) and one clone was homologous to the C-terminal end of the HsCOP1 protein (GenBank accession number BG345699). One chicken EST
clone (GenBank accession number BM487594) was
found homologous to the N-terminal end of HsCOP1.

vine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse NIH3T3 cell
line was grown in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For protein expression, cells were transfected with various plasmids using the LipofectMINE or LipofectMINE 2000 Reagent
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total amounts of plasmid DNA in individual transfection experiments were adjusted using empty
vector plasmids. Transfected cells were cultured for at least
24 hours after transfection and used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA,
0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mM PMSF) with 1 × proteasome
inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannhein). Immunoprecipitations from the transfected cell lysates were performed with anti-FLAG antibody coupled Agarose beads
(Sigma) and then the beads were washed six times in the
lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were
analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma. The anti-HA antimAb414 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Covance. The anti-Lamin A/C antibody was purchased from
Stratagene. Antibodies against the heat shock proteins
were purchased from Transduction laboratories.
Purification of His-tagged protein
Cells were lysed in a denaturing lysis buffer (8 M urea, 0.1
M NaH2PO4 and 0.01 M Tris•Cl, pH 8.0) and then briefly
sonicated in full speed. After centrifugation at maximum
speed for 15 minutes, the supernatant was incubated with
Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 1.5 hour at room temperature.
The resin was washed six times in a denaturing wash buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH2PO4 and 0.01 M Tris•Cl, pH 6.3)
and then boiled for 10 minutes in equal volumes of 2 ×
SDS loading buffer.
Cell fractionation
Cell-fractionation was carried out mostly as previously described [23]. For isolation of nuclei and nuclear envelopes,
HeLa cells from 10 15-cm culture dishes were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped off in PBS. After centrifugation at 500 g for 5 minutes the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of STM 0.25 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25
M sucrose, 5 mM MgSO4, 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). The following manipulations
were performed either with ice-cold reagents or at 4°C unless noted. A solution of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to
a final concentration of 0.025%. The pellets were homogenized by 30–40 strokes in a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 1.4 M sucrose by
addition of an appropriate volume of STM 2.1 (50 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2.1 M sucrose, 5 mM MgSO4, 2 mM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/30

DTT, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). 2.5 ml
of this suspension were transferred to each centrifuge tube
and laid between a 100 ul STM 2.1 cushion and 200 ul of
STM 0.8 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 M sucrose, 5 mM
MgSO4, 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM
PMSF). The tubes were then filled with STM 025 and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 65 minutes in a fixed-angle rotor.
The pellets containing the nuclei were washed twice with
STM 0.25. Integrity and purity of the nuclei were judged
by phase contrast microscopy.
The nuclei prepared above were suspended in 10 ml of
ice-cold TP buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, 1 mM PMSF) containing 0.3 mg/ml heparin
and 36 u/ml of DNase I. The suspension was gently stirred
on a magnetic stirrer for 60 minutes at 4°C and 15 minutes at room temperature. Nuclear envelopes were sedimented at 10,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed
once with STM 0.25.
The homogenate of cells, prepared as described above,
was centrifuged at 170 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C and
sedimented at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet
was washed with STM 0.25 and designated as crude mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was diluted with 1 volume of STM 0.0 (STM 0.25 without sucrose) and
centrifuged at 105,000 g overnight at 4°C. The resulting
supernatant and pellet yielded the cytosolic fraction and
the microsomal fraction, respectively.
Gel filtration chromatography
Subcellular fractions were fractionated over a 25 ml Superose-6 FPLC column (Pharmacia) with 1× gel filtration
buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 220 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 1 µM ZnSO4) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. All procedures were carried out at 4°C. Consecutive fractions of
0.5 ml each were collected after the void volume (7 ml),
concentrated with StrataClean resin (Stratagene), and
subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot
analysis.
Immunofluorescence and triton-extraction
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and indirectly immunostained with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma)
and then a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (Molecular Probes). DAPI (Sigma) was used for
nuclear counterstaining. For certain experiments, cells
were extracted with 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 10 minutes on ice and then washed three times in PBS before fixation. Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope was used
for observation. The images were taken using the Zeiss AxioCam HRc digital imaging system.
