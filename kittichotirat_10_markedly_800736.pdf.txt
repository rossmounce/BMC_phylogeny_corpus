Markedly different genome arrangements
between serotype a strains and serotypes b or c
strains of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
Weerayuth Kittichotirat1, Roger Bumgarner1, Casey Chen2*

Abstract
Background: Bacterial phenotype may be profoundly affected by the physical arrangement of their genes in the
genome. The Gram-negative species Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a major etiologic agent of human
periodontitis. Individual clonal types of A. actinomycetemcomitans may exhibit variable virulence and different
patterns of disease association. This study examined the genome arrangement of A. actinomycetemcomitans using
the genome sequences of serotypes a-c strains. The genome alignment and rearrangement were analyzed by the
MAUVE and the GRIMM algorithms. The distribution patterns of genes along the leading/lagging strands were
investigated. The occurrence and the location of repeat sequences relative to the genome rearrangement
breakpoints were also determined.
Results: The genome arrangement of the serotype a strain D7S-1 is markedly different from the serotype b strain
HK1651 or the serotype c strain D11S-1. Specific genome arrangements appear to be conserved among strains of
the same serotypes. The reversal distance between D7S-1 and HK1651 by GRIMM analysis is also higher than the
within-species comparisons of 7 randomly selected bacterial species. The locations of the orthologous genes are
largely preserved between HK1651 and D11S-1 but not between D7S-1 and HK1651 (or D11S-1), irrespective of
whether the genes are categorized as essential/nonessential or highly/nonhighly expressed. However, genome
rearrangement did not disrupt the operons of the A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. A higher proportion of the
genome in strain D7S-1 is occupied by repeat sequences than in strains HK1651 or D11S-1.
Conclusion: The results suggest a significant evolutionary divergence between serotype a strains and serotypes
b/c strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. The distinct patterns of genome arrangement may suggest phenotypic
differences between serotype a and serotypes b/c strains.

Background
Bacterial genomes are relatively plastic and may display
significant variation even among strains within the same
species. The variation is often due to large scale genome
deletion and/or gene acquisition by horizontal gene
transfer of elements such as genomic islands [1]. Consequently, genome content can be divided into a core
gene pool and a flexible gene pool [1-3]. The variation
in genome content is thought to be a key factor in the
evolution of bacterial pathogens. Moreover, the variation

in genome arrangement (ie, the physical arrangement of
genes) may also affect the virulence of the bacteria.
Genome rearrangement may occur via illegitimate
recombination and homologous recombination among
repeated elements and duplicated genes such as rDNA
operons, and may also occur after horizontal gene transfer or phage infection. While genome rearrangements
occurred frequently in laboratory cultures of Escherichia
coli, very few were fixed since the divergence of E. coli
and Salmonella enterica ~100MYA [4,5]. Most of the
rearrangements presumably have adverse effects on the
bacteria due to the constraints placed by cellular processes such as replication, transcription and gene regulation [6,7]. Consequently, the genome rearrangements
between closely related bacteria commonly involve

large-scale inversions along the axis of the origin (Ori)
and the terminus (Ter) of replication [8-10]. Such
changes presumably have much less deleterious effects
due to preservation of the gene locations relative to
replication and other cellular processes.
Gram-negative facultative Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a member of the Pasteurellaceae family
[11]. It is a recognized pathogen in periodontitis and
extra-oral infections. There are 6 distinct serotypes; each
serotype may represent a distinct clonal lineage of
A. actinomycetemcomitans. Depending on the disease
status and race/ethnicity of the subjects dominant serotypes within the study populations may include serotypes a, b, c, and e [12,13]. Serotypes d and f are in
general detected less frequently [12,13].
Certain clonal lineages of A. actinomycetemcomitans,
such as the JP-2 clone, appear to exhibit a high degree
of virulence [14-20]. However, other non-JP2 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains were also associated with
aggressive periodontitis and are presumed to be highly
virulent as well [13,21]. Interestingly, in the study of a
subgingival microbial community by Socransky et al,
A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a strains were a
component of the green complex, while A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b strains were not in association
with other bacterial species [22]. It seems plausible that
A. actinomycetemcomitans strains are distinct in their
phenotypes, pathogenic mechanisms, and functional
roles in the subgingival microbial communities, which
may result in different patterns of disease association.
To understand the molecular basis of the variations of
virulence in A. actinomycetemcomitans, we sequenced
and compared the genome content and structure of
A. actinomycetemcomitans strains recovered from different clinical settings. We have obtained initial evidence
for significant genome content variations among strains
[23,24]. This study further examined the differences in
the genome arrangement among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains of serotypes a-c. The results showed striking
differences in the genome arrangements of serotype a
strains compared to serotypes b or c strains. Such differences indicate divergent evolutionary pathways and possibly phenotypic differences between serotype a and
serotype b/c strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans.

Results
Genome rearrangement between A.
actinomycetemcomitans strains

The results of genome comparison by MAUVE for A.
actinomycetemcomitans are shown in Figure 1. The
reversal distances obtained by GRIMM (for A. actinomycetemcomitans and other bacterial species) are summarized in Table 1. For comparison between D11S-1 and
HK1651 there are 9 locally collinear blocks (LCBs) with

Page 2 of 12

a minimum weight of 8,386 identified by the progressive
MAUVE (Figure 1a), with a reversal distance of 5
(Figure 1b). The reversal distance of 5 can be viewed as a
hypothetical 5-step inversion process to convert the genome arrangement of one strain to the other strain. The
rearrangements involved at least one large scale genomic
inversion along the axis of Ori-Ter (see later section for
more explanation). For the comparison between D7S-1
and HK1651 there are 102 LCBs with a minimum weight
of 35 (Figure 1c) and a reversal distance of 80, which was
not only greater than that between HK1651 and D11S-1
but also greater than those between strains in other bacterial species (Table 1).
Seventy genome breakpoints of D7S-1 (in comparison
to HK1651) were randomly selected for PCR analysis.
All examined sites yielded PCR products of the expected
sizes (see Additional File-1). Sixteen of the 70 PCR products were also sequenced and the results confirmed the
sequences expected of the breakpoint regions (see Additional File-1).
The conservation of genome structures within serotypes

A question may arise whether the genome arrangement of
D7S-1 is unique and not found in other A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. To address this question we compared
the genome arrangements of D7S-1, HK1651 and D11S-1
with those in the contigs of strains D17P-3, ANH9381,
and D17P-2 (serotypes a, b and c, respectively). There
were significantly fewer intra-contig breakpoints in the
comparisons within each serotype than between serotypes
a and b/c. We identified one intra-contig break point in
267 large contigs of D17P-3 in a pair-wise comparison to
D7S-1. Similarly, we found 4 intra-contig breakpoints in 3
of the 102 large contigs of ANH9381 compared to
HK1651, and 4 intra-contig breakpoints in 2 of the 62
large contigs of D17P-2 compared to D11S-1. In contrast,
we identified 47 breakpoints in 40 contigs of D17P-3 compared to HK1651. The results are consistent with the conservation of the genome arrangement within serotypes,
but not between serotypes a and b/c.
Distribution patterns of genes and operons in the
genomes of A. actinomycetemcomitans

It is possible that the relative gene locations in the
genome may be preserved after large-scale genome
rearrangements [6]. To address this question in A.
actinomycetemcomitans, we first identified the Ori and
the Ter in the genomes of D7S-1, HK1651 and D11S1, and analyzed (i) the balance of the replichores, (ii)
the gene density in the leading and the lagging strands,
and (iii) the positions of the orthologous genes relative
to the Ori. We further examined the preservation of
the operons in strains of different genome
arrangements.

Figure 1 Genome alignment by the progressive MAUVE between A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The program identifies stretches of
nucleotide matches and selects locally collinear blocks (LCB) that meet a minimum weight criteria. Homologous LCBs between genomes are
connected with a line and identified by the same color. Blocks that are inverted are placed under the center line of the genome. (a) Serotype b
strain HK1651 (upper) and serotype c strain D11S-1 (lower). Nine LCB were identified. The predicted locations of Ori are indicated with red
arrows. These two genomes are largely in synteny, which is also indicated by a relatively low reversal distance of 5 (see Table 1). The
rearrangement between the genomes possibly involves an inversion along the Ori-Ter axis of the two LCBs flanking the Ori. (b) An optimal
scenario of genome conversion between strain HK1651 and D11S-1 based on the GRIMM analysis. The LCBs are identified as numbered block
arrows and also marked if they are involved in reversal in each step. The illustration merely gives an example and does not imply that the
sequence of the inversions has to be the same as depicted. The result suggests that it is possible to convert one genome to the other by 5
steps of genome reversion. (c) Genome alignment of serotype b strain HK1651 (upper) and serotype a strain D7S-1 (lower). One hundred and
two LCB were identified. These two genomes show little resemblance in their arrangements, which is also reflected by a relatively high reversal
distance of 80 (see Table 1).

The combined cumulative T-A and C-G skews of the
3rd codons peaked at the nucleotide coordinate ~1,062
Kb and declined and changed sign at the nucleotide
coordinate ~67 Kb for D7S-1 (see Additional File 2, top
panel). Several peaks of similar heights were identified
at coordinates 760 Kb, 825 Kb and 875 Kb for HK1651,
and at 437 Kb, 515 Kb and 550 Kb for D11S-1 (see
Additional File 2, middle and bottom panels). The low-

est points of the combined skews changed sign at coordinates ~1,450 Kb for HK1651 and 1,246 Kb for D11S1. Based on the results we assigned the Ori and the Ter
respectively to nucleotide coordinates 1,062,100 and
67,100 in D7S-1, 825,100 and 1,449,500 in HK1651, and
515,300 and 1,246,100 in D11S-1. The predicted locations of Ori and Ter in HK1651 and D11S-1 were supported by the observation that a large-scale genomic

inversion between HK1651 and D11S-1 occurred along
the axis of Ori-Ter as commonly observed in other species [8-10].
The imbalance of the replichores was analyzed as
described previously (the absolute value of [the length of
the replichore-half length of the genome]/half length of
the genome) [25]. We found that the imbalance of D7S1 was 13.8%, which may be considered within the normal range of deviations among many bacterial species.
In contrast, the imbalance of the replichores in HK1651
and D11S-1 were 40.1% and 30.6%, respectively.
The distributions of the predicted genes in the leading
and the lagging strands are shown in Table 2. The gene
density is higher in the leading strand than in the lagging strand in the 3 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains
of this study. Higher numbers of essential genes were
found in the leading strand than in the lagging strand
for D7S-1 and HK1651, but D11S-1 showed no strand
preference.

The distances of the orthologous genes to the Ori are
presented in Figure 2a-f. In Figure 2a the distances of
each pair of the orthologous genes in HK1651 and
D11S-1 were similar and can be explained by an offset
of ~130 Kb between the genomes (with the exception of
8 genes where the differences in the distances to Ori
were ~740 Kb). In contrast, the orthologous genes in
HK1651 and D7S-1 (Figure 2b) resided in different locations relative to Ori and no specific distribution patterns
were found. Similar results were found for subgroups of
essential/nonessential and highly expressed/nonhighly
expressed genes (Figure 2 c-f). Also, there was no discernable tendency for the highly expressed genes to be
closer to the Ori than the non-essential genes.
The potential disruptions of operons in the A. actinomycetemcomitans strains were examined. The analysis of
operon positions with respect to genomic rearrangement
between D7S-1 and HK1651 showed that out of 564
operons in the D7S-1 genome predicted by Database of
prOkaryotic OpeRons (DOOR) tool, 558 (98.9%) were
found to be intact in HK1651 and were not affected by
the genomic rearrangements between these strains (see
Additional File 3 for the list of disrupted operons in
D7S-1). Similarly, 505 of 515 (98%) predicted operons in
HK1651 were found to be intact in D7S-1 (see Additional File 3 for the list of disrupted operons in
HK1651). For the affected operons, the rearrangement
breakpoints occurred between genes of the operons
resulting in separations of genes rather than splitting
the genes into two fragments. Similar results were
obtained using FGENESB (http://linux1.softberry.com/

Features of genome rearrangement breakpoints

Genome rearrangements commonly occur via recombination between repeat elements or duplicated genes. We
hypothesized that there might be specific features at the
inter-LCBs regions and/or the ends of the LCBs that
flanked the rearrangement breakpoints. To examine this
hypothesis, 50-bp sub-sequences on both strands of
each genome were extracted in sliding windows of 1 bp,
and compared to the entire genome to identify a perfect
match in other regions. These 50-base-pair-repeat
regions are summarized in Table 3. D7S-1 genome contained a higher number of repeat regions than in
HK1651, D11S-1 or other bacteria species analyzed. The
percentage of the overlap between the cumulative interLCB regions and repeat regions are presented in Table
4. Higher percentages of the genome in D7S-1 were
occupied by repeat regions than in the other two strains.
Figure 3 illustrates the locations of the repeat elements
and the inter-LCB breakpoint regions (relative to
HK1651) of D7S-1. The regions between LCBs in D7S-1
were enriched with repeated sequences (See Additional

A summary comparison of the frequency and the feature of the repeat elements among strains are shown in
Table 5 (see Additional File 5 for sequences of the
repeat elements). D7S-1 has more repeat elements than
HK1651 or D11S-1. Several of these repeat elements are
shared among strains (allowing minor sequence variations). However, many of the repeat elements found in
D7S-1 are unique to this strain.

Discussion
A number of studies have suggested variable virulence
among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains [12,15,16,
19,20,26,27]. Most of these studies examined the clinical
associations of specific genotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans with periodontal health and disease in crosssectional and prospective studies, but did not provide
insight to the molecular basis of such variations. In the
present study we provided evidence for variations in the
physical arrangement of genes in the genomes of
A. actinomycetemcomitans, which may affect the phenotypes or virulence of the strains. Serotypes a-c of
A. actinomycetemcomitans were selected for this study
because they are frequently identified and may represent
up to 80% of the A. actinomycetemcomitans clinical isolates in human subgingival plaque [13].
The differences in the genome arrangement between
strains were visualized with the use of MAUVE and
then quantified by GRIMM to calculate the reversal distance. The use of reversal distance in phylogenetic analysis is based on the premise that genomic inversion is
the primary type of rearrangement event in bacteria,
which was supported by several studies [8,28]. Moreover, there is a general correlation between reversal distance and sequence-based phylogenetic analysis [28].
While low reversal distance may be relatively accurate,
high reversal distance is likely to underestimate the true
phylogenetic distance between genomes.
It is striking and unusual (in comparison to the variations seen in other bacterial species) that the serotype a
strain D7S-1 displayed a markedly different genome
arrangement relative to HK1651 or D11S-1. The potential sources of errors were examined first. We could rule
out large scale sequencing or assembly errors of the
contigs based on the results of the PCR analysis of the
breakpoints in D7S-1. Moreover, minor sequencing
errors would have little or no effect on the genome
comparison by MAUVE which examines large homologous blocks between strains. We could also rule out
assembly errors because the finished genomes were confirmed with optical mapping [23,24]. The results would
not have been affected by the specific locations of the
Ori or the Ter in the strains. Additional supporting

genome alignment of D7S-1 and HK1651 genome sequences, are significantly enriched with repeated sequences.

evidence was from the analysis of unscaffolded large
contigs of 3 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. Few
intra-contig breakpoints were found between strains of
the same serotypes, in contrast to the high numbers of
intra-contig breakpoints between strains of serotype a
and serotypes b/c. Therefore we concluded that serotype
a strains exhibited markedly different genome arrangements compared to those in serotypes b/c strains, and
further suggested that the genome arrangements were
conserved within serotypes.
The Ori and the Ter may be identified by various in
silico methods based on analyses of DNA asymmetry, distribution of DNA boxes and dnaA gene location [29-32].
The methods based on DNA asymmetry appear to be the
most universal and have been used to identify the Ori and
Ter of H. influenzae (a member of the Pasteurellacea)
[32,33]. In the absence of experimental determination the
locations of the Ori and the Ter of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains identified in this study were in agreement with
the available evidence as discussed below.
We noted that in the annotation of HK1651 the origin
of replication was not identified but the starting codon of

the dnaA gene was assigned the first nucleotide coordinate of the genome. While in some species the location
of the dnaA gene coincides with the origin of replication
[29], this is not the case in H. influenzae and presumably
not in A. actinomycetemcomitans either. Eriksen et al
[34] showed evidence of intragenomic recombination in
JP2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans via homologous
recombination of the 6 rRNA operons and 7 IS150-like
repeat elements. It is interesting to note that, with the
exception of one case (recombination between IS150-2
and IS150-4), all recombinations occurred along the axis
of Ori-Ter predicted in this study. In this study we also
found an example of a large-scale genomic inversion
between HK1651 and D11S-1 along the axis of Ori-Ter.
Genome rearrangements may occur via homologous
recombination of repeat elements in the bacterial genomes [35,36]. A. actinomycetemcomitans genomes contain diverse repeat elements that may mediate genome
rearrangement. Within A. actinomycetemcomitans
genomes some inter-LCB regions were occupied by composites of diverse repeat elements, which may reoccur in
other inter-LCB regions but with minor variations

(sequence variations, truncation, or absence) of the individual repeat elements. Some of the sequence diversity
may be due to sequencing errors. For these reasons we
chose to analyze the occurrence of repeat elements with
a sliding 50-base window. We noted that A. actinomycetemcomitans D7S-1 has a greater number of repeat elements than HK1651 or D11S-1. The data alone, however,
cannot be used to infer the ancestral genome structure of
A. actinomycetemcomitans.
Some of the repeat elements are identified in all three
A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The IS150 like elements have been reported previously in the genome of
HK1651 [34] and are found in both D7S-1 and D11S-1
in this study. The presence of variable copy numbers of
a 135-bp repeat sequence in the autotransporter adhesion gene Aae in different A. actinomycetemcomitans
strains has been reported previously [37]. There seems
to be a distinction in the distribution pattern of the
repeat elements in D7S-1 in comparison to that in
HK1651/D11S-1. For example, 12 of the repeat elements
in D7S-1 are unique and not found in HK1651 or D11S1. Vice versa the REPEAT03 is identified in HK1651 and
D11S-1 but not in D7S-1. Also, the copy numbers of
some of the repeat elements (REPEAT-04, -19, -20) are
identical in HK1651 and D11S-1 and different from the
copy numbers of the elements found in D7S-1. Further
examination of other A. actinomycetemcomitans strains

is needed to determine whether such distribution pattern has any phylogenetic significance.
The results from this study appear to suggest that the
genome arrangement of A. actinomycetemcomitans
strains may be less constrained by cellular processes
than in other bacterial species. This could be explained
by several factors. The growth rate of A. actinomycetemcomitans is comparatively low (doubling time of ~3-4
hrs in optimum laboratory growth conditions). There
might be little or no gene dosage effects and problem of
collisions between replication fork and RNA polymerase
in slow-growing bacteria, which allow the bacteria to
tolerate large-scale genomic rearrangements. The effective population size of some clonal lineages of A. actinomycetemcomitans (e.g., serotypes b and c) may be small,
which allow these clones to persist in the population. It
is also possible that serotypes b and c, as represented by
HK1651 and D11S-1, are more recently evolved and
have not had sufficient time to allow the mutation pressures to exert their effects. This interpretation is supported by the imbalanced genomes of HK1651 and
D11S-1, which could be a consequence of recent
changes of their genome arrangements.
While there are significant differences in the genome
arrangements in D7S-1 and HK1651 (or D11S-1) they
essentially did not affect the operons. However, the locations of orthologous genes were significantly different

Kittichotirat et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:489
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/489

between D7S-1 and HK1651 (or D11S-1). Presumably such
differences will affect the phenotypes of the strains. We
further noted the replichores were severely unbalanced for
strains HK1651 and D11S-1 and less so for strain D7S-1.
Evidence has suggested a strong selection for bacteria with
a balanced genome [38]. On the contrary, no evidence of
natural selection for balanced genomes was found in the
analysis of eight Yersinia genomes [25]. We have detected
no significant differences in growth rate and biofilm formation under laboratory growth conditions among these 3
A. actinomycetemcomitans strains (unpublished data). The
significance of genome arrangement to the phenotypes of
A. actinomycetemcomitans remains to be elucidated.
The differences in the genome arrangement or genome content alone may not be sufficient to determine
whether some A. actinomycetemcomitans strains should
be designated a subspecies or even a new species. There
appear to be no universally accepted concept and definition of bacterial species. With the advancement of bacterial genomics various approaches for species definition
have been proposed that combine the analyses of the
16S rRNA gene sequence identity, DNA-DNA hybridization, percentage of the shared genes in the genome, the
average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the shared genes
and ecological factors [39,40]. Pair-wise comparison of
the 16S rRNA gene sequences in strains D7S-1, HK1651
and D11S-1 showed >97.6% nucleotide identity, which is
within the accepted working definition of all three being
from the same species. We are analyzing the genome
contents of the sequenced serotypes a-f strains to
further address this question.
In addition to the potential biological impact of the
observed large-scale genomic rearrangement between
serotype a strains and serotype b/c strains, there are
also implications of the rearrangement on a practical
research level. In the early stages of our assembly and
finishing of the D7S-1 genome we had hoped to use the
HK1651 genome as a guide to assist in the ordering of
contigs. However, the level of genomic rearrangement
between these two strains negated the utility of HK1651
as a reference genome for the structure of D7S-1. Also,
the variation in genome structure means that PCR products predicted in one strain may cross a breakpoint in
another strain and hence will not be amplified in the
other strain. It is unclear how frequently similar problems will arise in the sequencing and analysis of other
bacterial genomes, but it is worth noting that at least in
A. actinomycetemcomitans massive variation in genome
structure between strains can lead to confusion in some
kinds of analyses.

Conclusions
A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a strains display
markedly different physical arrangement of genes in

Page 9 of 12

comparison to serotype b or c strains. This likely indicates significant differences in the evolutionary history
between serotype a strains and serotype b/c strains. The
results have provided significant insight to the evolutionary divergence of A. actinomycetemcomitans of
different serotypes. Also, the serotype-specific genome
arrangement patterns have practical application for
future genome sequencing of A. actinomycetemcomitans.

Methods
Bacterial strains

Serotype a strains D7S-1, D17P-3, and serotype c strains
D11S-1 and D17P-2 were cultivated from subgingival
plaque of patients with aggressive periodontitis [13,41].
Serotype b strain ANH9381 was recovered from a subgingival plaque sample of a periodontally non-diseased
subject. Species identity and serotypes were examined
by a 16S rRNA-based PCR analysis and a serotype analysis by a PCR-method as described previously [42].
Genome sequences

The genome sequencing of D7S-1 (one contig; genome
size 2,308,328 bp) and D11S-1 (circularized; genome size
2,105,764 bp) were completed as described previously
[23,24]. The genome information of the sequenced strain
HK1651 (genome size 2,105,503 bp) is accessible from
University of Oklahoma (http://www.genome.ou.edu/act.
html) and Oralgen (http://www.oralgen.lanl.gov/oralgen/
bacteria/aact/). Contigs generated by 454 sequencing of
strains D17P-3 (25× coverage), ANH9381 (16X) and
D17P-2 (28X) were also included in the analyses. Additional bacterial genome sequences were downloaded
from Genbank for analyses that included Haemophilus
somnus strains 2336 and 129PT, Haemophilus influenzae
strains RdKW20, 86-028NP, PittEE and PittGG, Escherichia coli strains 536, ATCC8739, O157:H7 EDL933, O12:

and W83, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7, PAO1, LESB58,
Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NJ8700, and Helicobacter
pylori G28.
Annotation and comparison of A. actinomycetemcomitans
genomes

A gene prediction and annotation pipeline was put
together to process the genome sequence data obtained
from the Roche/454 platform and strain HK1651. The
gene identification and functional annotation mostly
followed the protocol developed by The Institute for
Genomic Research (J. Craig Venter Institute). Specifically, protein-coding genes were identified using Glimmer3 software [43] with our custom modification of the
predicted results. Similarly, rRNA and tRNA coding

Kittichotirat et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:489
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/489

genes were identified by using Exonerate [44] and
tRNAscanSE [45] softwares, respectively. The predicted
genes were annotated by first comparing them to the
HK1651 annotation using the NCBI BLAST software
[46]. Genes that are annotated as hypothetical as well as
those that are not present in strain HK1651 were then
blasted against Genbank non-redundant protein
sequence database. The description of the best BLAST
hit is then used as annotation for that gene. The gene
orthologs among the 3 A. actinomycetemcomitans
strains were identified based on all against all BLAST
search. The genes that fulfill the following criteria are
included as core genes with: (i) sequence similarity of at
least 85% (ii) length difference of not more than 5%.
Pseudogenes and genes with frameshift mutations were
excluded from the analysis.
Analysis of genomic rearrangement by MAUVE

The Progressive Mauve algorithm was used to create the
whole genome alignment between different strains of
A. actinomycetemcomitans [47]. GRIMM genome rearrangement algorithms were used to obtain the reversal
distance between genomes [48].
PCR analysis of genome breakpoints

The genome breakpoints in D7S-1 were analyzed by
PCR. Briefly, 20-mer oligonucleotides were designed
with the program Primer 3 [49]. A standard PCR protocol was employed under the following conditions: 5 min
at 94°C for denaturation followed by 30 cycles of 94°C
for 30 sec, an annealing step at 60°C for 1 min, an
extension step at 72°C for 2 min and then a final extension of 10 min at 72°C [50]. PCR amplicons were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For sequencing,
the PCR products were purified by GIAquick PCR purification kit and GIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and submitted for sequencing at the USC
School of Medicine Microchemical Core Facility.
Assignment of gene categories in
A. actinomycetemcomitans

All open reading frames (ORFs) identified in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains D7S-1, HK1651 and D11S-1
were categorized as essential or non-essential genes. The
essential genes were identified based on the Profiling of
Escherichia coli chromosome (PEC) database [51]. Specifically, A. actinomycetemcomitans ORFs that are homologous to the essential genes in PEC were considered as
essential (blastp with E-value < = 1e-6). The remaining
ORFs in A. actinomycetemcomitans were considered
non-essential by default. ORFs were also classified into
highly expressed and non-highly expressed genes based
on the codon adaptation index (CAI) calculated using
CAIJava tool [52]. ORFs within the top 5 percent

Page 10 of 12

highest CAI score are assigned as highly expressed and
the remaining ORFs are considered as non-highly
expressed.
Analysis of gene density and gene positions

Combined G-C and T-A skews were first used to predict the locations of the Ori and the Ter with Oriloc
[31]. Each genome was then divided into two replichores. The distribution of genes of different categories
(essential/non-essential, highly expressed/non-highly
expressed) and their densities in the leading and the lagging strands were compared between strains. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the distance to the Ori
for orthologous genes between strains was calculated.
Analysis of preservation of operons among strains

The operons in A. actinomycetemcomitans were identified by using the Database of prOkaryotic OpeRons
(DOOR) tool [53,54] and by FGENESB, a suite of bacterial operon and gene prediction programs [55]. In
brief, the DOOR tool predicts bacterial gene operons
using a classifier algorithm on features such as intergenic distance, neighborhood conservation, phylogenetic
distance, information from short DNA motifs, similarity
score between GO terms of gene pairs and length ratio
between a pair of genes. The FGENESB tool predicts
gene operon based on distances between open reading
frames and frequencies of different genes neighboring
each other in known bacterial genomes, as well as on
promoter and terminator predictions. The positions of
predicted operons in one strain were examined in the
other strains to identify those that are affected by the
genome rearrangement.
Identification of regions with repeat sequences

A 50-base pair window (each window is a sliding of 1
base pair along the genome sequence) is compared to
the entire genome to identify perfect matches (or a perfect match) on any other regions of the genome.
