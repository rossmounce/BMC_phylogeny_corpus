Abstract
Background: Crucian carp (abbreviated CC) belongs to the genus of Carassius within the family of Cyprinidae. It
has been one of the most important freshwater species for Chinese aquaculture and is especially abundant in the
Dongting water system of Hunan province. CC used to be considered as all diploid forms. However, coexistence of
diploid (abbreviated 2nCC), triploid (abbreviated 3nCC) and tetraploid crucian carp (abbreviated 4nCC) population
of the Dongting water system was first found by our recently researches.
Results: We examined the ploidy level and compared biological characteristics in different ploidy CC. In
reproductive mode, 2nCC was bisexual generative and 4nCC generated all-female offspring by gynogenesis.
However, 3nCC generated progenies in two different ways. 3nCC produced bisexual triploid offspring fertilized with
3nCC spermatozoa, while it produced all-female triploid offspring by gynogenesis when its ova were activated by
heterogenous spermatozoa. The complete mitochondrial DNA of three different ploidy fishes was sequenced and
analyzed, suggesting no significant differences. Interestingly, microchromosomes were found only in 3nCC, which
were concluded to be the result of hybridization. Allogenetic DNA fragments of Sox genes were obtained in 3nCC
and 4nCC, which were absent in 2nCC. Phylogenetics analysis based on Sox4 gene indicated 3nCC and 4nCC
formed a separate group from 2nCC.
Conclusions: In summary, this is the first report of the co-existence of three types of different ploidy crucian carps
in natural waters in China. It was proved that the coexistence of different ploidy CC was reproductively maintained.
We further hypothesized that 3nCC and 4nCC were allopolyploids that resulted from hybridization. The different
ploidy CC population we obtained in this study possesses great significance for the study of polyploidization and
the evolution of vertebrates.

Background
Taxonomically, crucian carp (Carassius auratus L.,
abbreviated CC) belongs to the genus of Carassius
within the family of Cyprinidae. It is widely bred across
Eurasia and America, because of its good survival rate,
high reproduction rate and good disease resistance. In
China, the species has been found in most provinces,
except for the western plateau. It is one of the most
important freshwater species for Chinese aquaculture
especially in the Dongting water system of Hunan province. Although Carassius auratus gibelio (superspecies

auratus) has been reported co-existence of three types
of different ploidy [1-4], CC (Carassius auratus) used to
be considered as all diploid forms in China [5,6]. However, triploid crucian carp has been reported in China
since ‘80 s, including Dianchi High-back crucian carp in
Yunnan province [7], the Sogu crucian carp in Guangdong province [8], Puan crucian carp in Guizhou province [9], and Pengze crucian carp in Jiangxi province
[10] et al. In this study, CC individuals were sampled
from the Dongting water system of Hunan province and
assayed by flow cytometry and chromosome counts. The
results confirmed that there were three forms with different ploidy in the natural water system. It is the first
report of tetraploid forms in a natural CC population of
China (not Carassius auratus gibelio). Meanwhile, we
believed that polyploidization in crucian carp is a

process in evolution. This research aims to approach the
reason why there is the same polyploidzation in crucian
carp in China as in Carassius auratus gibelio.
Polyploidy is defined as organisms with one or more
additional chromosome sets. It has been widely recognized in plants, such that about 30-70% plants are polyploidy in their evolutionary history [11]. So far, some
researches have shown that polyploidy is not only a
characteristic of plants, but also occurs in other eukaryotes [12,13]. The polyploid event(s) possibly happened
in the evolution of prokaryotes to humans [14]. In ‘70 s,
Ohno proposed the theory that two rounds of tetraploidization occurred in the evolution of vertebrates
[12,15,16]. The third genome duplication, termed
fish-specific genome duplication, was also reported in
teleosts. So far, over 28,000 fish species have been identified, which is more than that of all the other vertebrate
groups combined. Recent studies on comparative genomics have further suggested that the third round of fishspecific genome duplication might have occurred in
ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes about 350 million
years ago during the divergence between teleost fish and
basal actinopterygian lineages. Polyploidy induces redundant genes, increasing the possibility of gene loss, gene
silencing, subfunctionalization of genes, and evolution to
new genes [17-21]. These variations provide polyploids
with more possibilities for new characteristics and adaptations than diploids. Therefore, polyploidy might be
related to the increase in species number and biological
diversity [22-26]. In addition, it seems that the duplication of fish genome may be still in progress in the nature [27]. In general, a species has definite chromosome
numbers. However, in this study, the wild CC population consisting of three forms with different ploidy
provided excellent material for the studies on polyploidization. Could the ploidy diversity of the population
maintain? How did the polyploidy level change?
The duplicated sets of chromosomes originate from
the same or a closely related individual ("autopolyploid”) or from the hybridization of two different species ("allopolyploid”). This observation has traditionally
led to the conclusion that autopolyploids are ephemeral, whereas allopolyploids give rise to the majority of
long-lasting lineages. In our previous study, two kinds
of artificial polyploids were established using distant
hybridization. We have reported artificial allotetraploid
hybrids of red crucian carp (Carassius auratus) × common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is the first case of
the creation of a bisexual fertile allotetraploid population in fish (perhaps even the first in vertebrates) [28].
Subsequently, the polyploid hybrids from different subfamilies of fish, red crucian carp (Carassius auratus) ×
blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), were
also obtained [29]. Then, what was the possible origin

of the polyploid forms in the CC population in nature
waters?
We have been continually monitoring the CC population since 2005. The fertility of different ploidy CC was
studied. The coexistence of three different ploidy individuals in the wild CC population was proved to be reproductively stable to some extend. The present study
focused on the characteristics of different ploidy fish
from natural waters, with the purpose of investigating
the origin of the rules for natural polyploidy and illuminating the roles of polyploidization in the evolution of
fish or vertebrates.

Results
DNA content

A flow cytometer (Partec GmbH) was employed for
DNA content measurement in large scale. All sampled
CC were collected from wild population and all the progenies obtained in the breeding test were detected in
this way. The distribution of DNA content of each sample is shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. The DNA content
of red crucian carp (2n = 100, abbreviated RCC) was
used as a control. The samples with mean DNA content
that was equal (P > 0.05) to that of RCC were determined as diploid (abbreviated 2nCC) with two sets of
chromosomes (2n = 100) similar to RCC. The individuals that possessed the mean DNA contents of 1.5
times, 2 times (P > 0.05) to that of RCC were determined respectively as triploid (abbreviated 3nCC) and
tetraploid (abbreviated 4nCC) which contained three
(3n = 150) and four (4n = 200) sets of chromosomes.
The mean DNA content of 3nCC sperm was 0.75 times
to that of RCC, which was half of that of 3nCC blood
cells, indicating the sperm contained 0.75 set of chromosomes (0.75n = 75). We examined 949 CC in past
five years. 2nCC, 3nCC and 4nCC were found in the
natural CC population of the Dongting water system,
accounting for 16%, 80%, and 4%, respectively. The
number of 4nCC was much fewer than 2nCC. The
percentage of 2nCC decreased roughly year by year,
account for 39%, 23%, 20%, 3% and 5%, respectively.
The percentage of 3nCC increased roughly year by year,

accounting for 61%, 68%, 74%, 97% and 94%, respectively (Table 2).
Chromosome numbers

To determine the ploidy accurately, chromosome counts
were done on kidney tissue of samples. Figure 2 showed
examples of the metaphase chromosome spreads in the
three types of CC with different ploidy. Table 3 presented the distribution of chromosome numbers in
2nCC, 3nCC and 4nCC. Of all the examined samples in
2nCC, 96% of chromosomal metaphases possessed 100
chromosomes, proving that they were diploids with 100
chromosomes (2n = 100) (Figure 2A). 4% of chromosomal metaphases with less than 100 chromosomes were
acceptable considering the low probability of chromosome losing during experiment operation. Of all the
examined samples in 3nCC, 94% of chromosomal metaphases had 150 chromosomes, indicating that they were
triploids with 150 chromosomes (3n = 150) (Figure 2B).
Several uncounted particles resembling chromosomes
(Figure 2B, arrows) in 3nCC were identified as microchromosomes. Of all the examined samples in 4nCC,
71% of chromosomal metaphases had 200 chromosomes, indicating that they were tetraploids with 200
chromosomes (4n = 200) (Figure 2C).
Morphological traits and gender diversity

To detect the appearance diversity in the population, 15
individuals of each ploidy form that were previously
determined by DNA content were random sampled for
morphologically examining. The three different ploidy
forms of CC were similar in appearance and no significant differences in morphological traits were found (P >
0.05). Table 4 and Table 5 detailed their examined measurable traits and countable traits (more details about
weight, measurable traits and countable traits were in
additional file 1, additional file 2, additional file 3, additional file 4, additional file 5 and additional file 6). The
gender diversities of different ploidy CC detected in the
past several years were counted (Table 2). In this study,
both the males and females were found in 2nCC with
the sex ratio (female: male) of 1:1. We also found males
and females in 3nCC population but the sex ratio
(female: male) was nearly 5:1. Until now, only females
were found in 4nCC, and the number of 4nCC in the
population was apparently less than 2nCC and 3nCC.
To some extent, the gender diversities of different ploidy
CC indicated that the reproduction mode of 3nCC and
4nCC may not be amphigenesis.
Fertility analysis

Observation of the gonad microstructure and ultrastructure indicated the fertility of different ploidy CC.

The ovarian microstructure under section observation
indicated that the females of three kinds of CC were fertile. The ovarian development of the population was
normal and synchronous (Figure 3). The ovaries of three
forms of CC with different ploidy entered III-stage,
where II-stage oocytes and III-stage oocytes were simultaneously found.
Males were found in 2nCC and 3nCC. The sperm
ultra-structure indicated that 2nCC and 3nCC were also
fertile. Under TEM observation, all the mature spermatozoa in the testis of 2nCC and 3nCC had normal structures (Figure 4 A and 4B). However, in the testis of
3nCC there were certain amounts of vacuoles in the
head of the spermatozoa (Figure 4 C and 4D, arrow),
the biological significance of which was not clear and
will require further study. Under SEM observation, the
mature spermatozoa of 2nCC and 3nCC had the normal
external form, comprising a head, a connecting piece,
and a tail (Figure 5). With the increase of ploidy level,
the head size of spermatozoa increased (Table 6). The
mean head size of spermatozoa ratio of 3nCC to 2nCC
was 1.5:1(P > 0.05), the same as the DNA content.
Breeding tests

The reproduction mode of different ploidy CC can be
inferred through the study of the breeding-tests-produced progeny’s biological characters. All the crossings

had high fertilization rate (>70%) and hatching rate
(>60%), and produced more than 300 living offspring,
except the crossing of 2nCC♀ × BSB♂ which possessed
low fertilization rate (46%) and hatching rate (17%) and
produced 119 living hybrids. We believed that the
further relationship between 2nCC and BSB (belonged
to different subfamily) was the major reason of the
lower fertilization rate and hatching rate (more details
about fertilization rate and hatching rate were in additional file 7).
The offspring produced in each crossing were separately bred. Their morphological traits, gonad development and chromosome numbers were detailed in table 7.
Within the population of CC, the eggs of 2nCC accepted
only the sperm of 2nCC and developed into diploid progenies. When fertilized with active sperm coming from
related species out of the population, the progenies of
2nCC possessed hybrid phenotypes and delayed development of gonads. The eggs of 2nCC could not be activated
by UV-inactivated sperm.
The eggs of the all-female 4nCC only could develop
into all-female progenies with similar phenotypes to the
maternal parent, when the eggs were fertilized with the
sperm from a paternal within or without the CC population, and even with UV-inactivated sperm. All the progenies of 4nCC were detected as tetraploids with a
chromosome number of 200.

Interestingly, the bisexual 3nCC was fertile. When it
fertilized with homogenous sperm of 3nCC, the eggs of
3nCC developed into bisexual triploid progenies with
normally developed gonads. In this cross, bisexual offspring were produced. However, when fertilized with
heterologous sperm of 2nCC or from other species, the
eggs of 3nCC developed into all-female triploid progenies with similar appearance to the maternal 3nCC.
There were no male offspring produced. In the cross of
triploid males with triploid females, male offspring were
produced. It obviously indicated that the male offspring
obtained at least the male gene from the triploid males.
The only exception was discovered in the cross 3nCC
(♀) × common carp (♂). There were not only a large
number of all-female triploid forms (3n = 150) but also
several tetraploid forms (4n = 200) (frequency 0.3%) in
the progenies. These two kinds of progenies possessed
similar phenotypes. The only way to distinguish them
was to detect their DNA content or chromosome
spreads. The tetraploid forms were all female with normally developed gonads and did not exhibit hybridized
phenotypes.
DNA-bands of the HMG-box of Sox genes

The Sox gene is karyogene. If peregrinus chromosome is
integrated, the recombination can be observed. There
were three Sox DNA fragments (about 200, 600
and1900bp) in RCC and 2nCC, and four DNA fragments (about 200, 500, 600 and 1900bp) in 3nCC and
4nCC (Figure 6). 3nCC and 4nCC possessed an extra
500bp band that did not belong to 2nCC, the original
member of the CC population.
The exact lengths of about 1900bp fragments of
2nCC, 3nCC and 4nCC were 1941bp, 1943bp and
1955bp respectively and submitted to GenBank under
accession nos. [GenBank: GU294783, GenBank:
GU294782, GenBank: GU294784] respectively. Sequence
homology and variation were analyzed by CLUSTALW

2.0 (details of the analysis were in additional file 8). Till
now, the 1900-bp Sox-HMG fragments were only found
in the fish belonging to the genus of Carassius. The
phylogenetic tree (Figure 7A) of 1900-bp Sox-HMG
fragments indicated that the relationship between 2nCC
and red crucian carp was closer than that among the
CC population, and that 3nCC and 4nCC were comparatively distant-related to 2nCC.
The complete mitochondrial genome sequences

The mitochondrial DNA strictly abides by maternal
inheritance. Through the study of the mt-DNA, the
maternal parent of different ploidy CC can be indicated.
The complete mt-DNA sequences of 2nCC (16580bp),
3nCC (16580bp) and 4nCC (16581bp) were obtained
and submitted to GenBank under accession nos. [GenBank: GU086395, GenBank: GU086396, GenBank:
GU086397] respectively.
The phylogenetic tree performed by bootstrap in
neighbor joining with the complete mtDNA sequences
was shown in Figure 7B. The grouping matches the taxonomy. The tree firstly diverges into clades of different
subfamily: the Cultrinae subfamily including the blunt
snout breams and the Cyprininae subfamily containing
the others which were supported by high bootstrap
values. The clade of Cyprininae subfamily has two
groups of different genus: one including the common
carp of genus Cyprinus, and the other belonging to the
genus of Carassius. The three different ploidy CC clustered together indicating that the CC population had
close genetic relationship.

Discussion
Fish possessed the greatest variety in vertebrates and
widely spread all over the world. Then, it is very interesting and valuable to study how fish could evolve so
successfully in species forming and environment

adoptability. Polyploidization is regarded as the important characteristic of genome evolution of all eukaryotes,
which possibly has occurred in the evolutionary progress
of protozoa and human beings. Fish-specific genome
duplication was also reported in teleosts [18,19,30].
Polyploidy induces genome multiplication, resulting in
redundant genes that provide genetic basic for specie
evolution at the molecular level. Thus, frequent polyploidization may relate to the higher species variety of
fish and other organisms [22-26]. In this study, our
interesting discovery and convincing experiments provided an extraordinary insight to further consideration
on fish polyploidization.
Crucian carp is a traditional economic freshwater fish
and is widespread in China. The ploidy of CC population which was well-focused for years used to be considered as all diploid forms. However, some reports have
discovered triploid forms in population of wild CC in
China since 1980s [7-10]. Since then, the co-existence of
diploid and triploid forms in natural CC populations has
become widely accepted. In this study, by using flow
cytometry to examine the DNA content of erythrocyte
nuclei, the high diversity of CC was simply and accurately disclosed at the genome level. It was extremely
interesting that there were not only diploid form (2n =
100) and triploid form (3n = 150+), but also tetraploid
form (4n = 200) were discovered for the first time in a
natural CC population in China.
Reproductive mode and chromosome set

According to our continual detection of the wild CC
population since 2005, the coexistence of polyploid individuals in wild CC population was stable to some extend,
although the detected proportions of each ploidy group
changed every year. The polyploid forms that took up a
certain proportion were not short-lived but persistent.

How did the triploid and tetraploid forms maintain in
the wild population? The series of crossing tests provided
valuable information. The reproductive modes revealed
that 2nCC were identified as the normal bisexual group,
producing haploid gametes that developed into new
diploid generation when fertilized with the sperm of
2nCC. The all-female 4nCC were considered as the natural gynogenetic reproductive mode. The morphology,
gonadal development and chromosome number of 4nCC
offspring were examined. They all showed the same genotypes as their maternal parents. We didn’t obtain male
tetraploid crucian carp from nature in five years. Meanwhile, in the crosses of female 4nCC with male fishes of
different relationship, tetraploid offspring which were allfemale with the same morphology and chromosome
number as their maternal parents were obtained, which
by hybridization couldn’t be obtained. The eggs of 4nCC
would develop into new tetraploid progenies, no matter
what spermatozoa of different species they were fertilized
with. Natural gynogenesis was supported by the results of
morphological analysis, chromosome tests and gonad
development observation. The spermatozoa only activated the eggs’ development, the chromosomes of which
did not contribute to the zygote. The reproductive mode
of 3nCC was complex. As mentioned above, the 3nCC
were bisexual fertile. When the eggs of 3nCC met the
spermatozoa within the group, bisexual triploid offspring
were generated, suggesting that 3nCC possessed normal
bisexual reproduction (perhaps, 2n = 150), similar to
2nCC. In contrast, when the eggs of 3nCC met heterogenous spermatozoa of allied species, all-female offspring
were produced, suggesting that 3nCC was also capable of
natural gynogenesis reproduction, as 4nCC was. Actually,
it is traditionally considered, and widely accepted, that
triploids are sterile. Because the chromosomes of the
germ cells cannot be paired correctly, abnormal gametes

were induced in the first meiosis. It seems difficult to
understand how the chromosomes of 3nCC performed
pairing during meiosis. Considering the fish-specific genome duplication that was regarded as having happened in
the history of teleosts evolution [17-20], 3nCC could
actually be regarded as an ancient hexaploid which could
certainly perform pairing of homologous chromosomes
during meiosis. Therefore, the results supported the

occurrence of genome duplication in fish evolution. In
our opinion, the triploid crucian carp has diploidized to
some extent and this is still in process in evolution. Thus,
the polyploid forms of CC were not incidental, but were
reproductively maintained in the wild population.
Moreover, potential competitive inhibition of 3nCC on
2nCC was indicated. The special reproductive mode of
3nCC provided them with great advantages. In the

accept sperms from both 2nCC and 3nCC and produce
normal triploid progenies. In contrast, the eggs of 2nCC
would develop into living offspring only when fertilized
with the sperm of 2nCC. Thus, the existence of 3nCC
would effectively inhibit the reproduction of 2nCC. We

considered it as the reason for the substantial decrease
of the proportion of 2nCC in the wild population, and
speculated that the decreasing trend of 2nCC would
accelerate together with the increasing 3nCC proportion. 2nCC would have even disappeared in the population in a certain period. The results indicated that it is
necessary and vital for us to protect the wild CC species
resources.
The extraordinary flexibility in the reproductive biology of triploids, and the apparent advent of gynogenesis
in tetraploids represented a remarkable opportunity to
study the evolutionary biology and formation of
aneuploidy.
Polyploidization in fish evolution

The fertility of 3nCC supported the occurrence of genome duplication in fish evolution at genome level. It is
traditionally considered, and widely accepted, that

triploids are sterile. Because the chromosomes of the
germ cells cannot be paired correctly, then abnormal
gametes were induced in the first meiosis. However, the
3nCC analyzed in this study were fertile and had normal, functional gonads that produced normal meiotic
gametes. The DNA content of 3nCC’s sperm was
detected as half of that of the somatic cell, indicating
that 3nCC had broken through the anticipated barrier

and performed diploidization to a certain degree (perhaps, 2n = 150). It seems difficult to understand how
the chromosomes of 3nCC performed pairing during
meiosis. Considering the fish-specific genome duplication that was regarded as having happened in the history of teleosts evolution, 3nCC could actually be
regarded as an ancient hexaploid which could certainly
perform pairing of homologous chromosomes during

meiosis [17-20]. Therefore, the results supported the
occurrence of genome duplication in fish evolution.
The discovery of stable existence of tetraploid individuals in the original diploid wild population suggested a
“new” tetraploidization that might be still in process in
natural CC population. Besides, tetraploidy might not be
directly resulted from duplication of diploid individuals,
while triploid forms played a role in the ploidy diversity
of the CC population. According to our breeding tests,
the 4nCC only generated offspring by natural gynogenesis. Even when fertilized with the sperms of 2nCC, eggs
of 4nCC still produced natural gynogens and no triploid
progeny would be produced. However, in the crossing of
3nCC (♀) × common carp (♂), we obtained a few tetraploid individuals (4n = 200) (frequency 0.3%). It seemed

that a complex of different ploidy forms was a possible
intermediate phase in the process of tetraploidization.
The theory that two rounds of tetraploidization
occurred in the evolutionary process of the vertebrates
is popular [12,15,16]. Molecular evidence supporting the
process of polyploidization mainly came from the multicopy of genes. At genome level, Venkatesh investigated
the chromosome numbers of more than 300 fish species
and found that all the chromosomal numbers were even
and were approximately multiples of two different species, indicating that tetraploidization has occurred in the
evolution of fishes [30]. However, it is quite difficult to
find a “new” polyploidization to support the theory,
because the assumed duplication events occurred millions of years ago. Our discovery of three different

Xiao et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/20

ploidy forms in a natural fish population suggested that
genome duplication in fish might be still in progress
and would spontaneously take place in nature.
Hybridization, the possible origin of polyploid crucian
carp

Furthermore, we considered the forming of polyploid
CC attributable to hybridization.
Firstly, evidence came back from the observation of
chromosomal metaphases of 3nCC. In the genome of
3nCC, some chromosome-like particles were found and
identified as microchromosomes (supernumerary chromosomes or B-chromosome), in addition to the 150 standard chromosomes. These were found only in 3nCC, and
there was no obvious pattern to their frequency of occurrence or amount. The origin of microchromosomes has
been proved as interspecies hybridization in the gynogenetic fish Poecilia Formosa, a hybrid species between
P. mexicana and P. latipinna [31]. This unisexual species
required sperms of sexual parental species to initiate egg
development, but paternal chromosomes are eliminated
from the developing zygote. Laboratory crosses of P. Formosa (♀) and black strain (♂), both of which lacked
microchromosomes, produced some black-pigmented
offspring with microchromosomes. It was most likely
that incomplete elimination of paternal normal chromosomes caused the appearance of microchromosomes
(containing the paternal pigmentation genes) in the offspring [32]. Similar results were found for interspecific
crosses between Coix aquaticus and C. gigantean [33].
Accordingly, the microchromosomes in 3nCC were considered as evidence of the heterogenous genome of
related species, which was brought in through hybridization. Additionally, it was also reported that the existence
and frequency of microchromosomes were related to the
sex ratio [34]. In general, it is believed that microchromosomes play an important role in biological adaptability.
For example, Poecilia formosa was found as a kind of unisexual species whose eggs required sperms of a sexual
parental species to be activated but paternal chromosomes were eliminated from the developing zygote. It
was believed that some paternal genetic material was
incorporated into the zygote by the microchromosomes,
which also played a role in the formation of body color
[32]. Considering the reproduction of the 3nCC in the
wild CC population, the microchromosomes might maintain a gene introgression within the population and
reduce their reproductive isolation.
Secondly, stable coexistence of polyploid forms in the
wild population also suggested the heterogenous origin,
even though autopolyploidization could not be absolutely
excluded. Autopolyploids, whose chromosomes were
directly duplicated, were considered ephemeral, whereas
allopolyploids gave rise to long-lasting lineages [26].

Page 11 of 15

Accordingly, The Dianchi triploid High-back Crucian
Carp of Yunnan province was not regarded as a direct
duplication of the diploid Low-back Crucian Carp [35].
In this study, 4nCC maintained their all female and tetraploid nature in the progenies, with identical chromosome
number and phenotypes, indicating a long-lasting linage
of tetraploid forms in the CC population.
The reproductive mode of gynogenesis also suggested
the heterogenous origin of 4nCC. Our previous studies
have strongly supported the view that distant hybridization could result in polyploidization and produce hybrid
progenies with a reproductive mode of gynogenesis. In
the previous study [28,29], we established two kinds of
artificial polyploidy lineage by hybridization. One was
the cross of RCC (♀) × Common carp (♂). The F1 and
F2 hybrids of RCC (♀) × Common carp (♂) were diploid
hybrids with 100 chromosomes. Interestingly, the males
and females of diploid F2 hybrids were able to generate
unreduced diploid spermatozoa and diploid eggs, which
were fertilized to form the allotetraploid hybrids in the
F3. The diploid sperm and eggs of F3 were fertilized to
produce the tetraploids in F4. Since then, the tetraploidy
has been maintained and the population of F3-F18 tetraploid hybrids (abbreviated 4nAT) has been formed in
succession. This was the first case of artificial creation
of bisexual fertile allotetraploid hybrids in fish (maybe
even in vertebrates). Then, the diploid gynogenetic
hybrids and the diploid androgenetic hybrids were
obtained, which developed from the diploid hybrid eggs
and diploid sperm generated by the females and males
of the tetraploid hybrids respectively, without the treatment for doubling the chromosomes [36,37]. Another
artificial polyploid lineage was established by distant
hybridization of RCC (♀) × blunt snout bream (♂). In
this hybridization, the maternal fish, RCC, possessed 100
chromosomes and the paternal fish, blunt snout bream,
possessed 48 chromosomes, and they belonged to different subfamilies (Cyprininae subfamily and Cultrinae
subfamily). In the first generation of RCC (♀) × blunt
snout bream (♂), we successfully obtained sterile triploid hybrids (3n = 124, abbreviated as 3nRB) and bisexual fertile tetraploid hybrids (4n = 148, abbreviated as
4nRB). The females of the 4nRB were also able to generate unreduced tetraploid eggs. Other researchers also
obtained gynogenetic tetraploids by distant crossing
[38-40]. It seemed that gynogenesis was more compatible for hybrids reproduction. In this study, 4nCC possessed natural gynogenesis. 3nCC would also produced
gynogens when the eggs were fertilized with distant
sperm. It was feasible and reasonable to infer the hybrid
origin of polyploid CC.
Thirdly, the most powerful evidence came from the
molecular biology study, supporting the hybrid origin of
the polyploids in the CC population.

Xiao et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/20

At the DNA-band level, there were three DNA fragments (200, 600,1900bp) of the Sox genes in RCC and
2nCC, and four (200, 500, 600, 1900bp) in 3nCC and
4nCC (Figure 6). The 500bp band found in 3nCC and
4nCC could not be amplified in 2nCC and RCC. The
2nCC was the original member in the CC population.
Thus, the amplified 500bp fragments exhibited the variety in DNA sequences of polyploids. We considered the
variations in genome DNA of 3nCC and 4nCC were
either directly inherited from other species outside of
the population or produced by genetic recombination of
high probability that resulted from distant crossing.
At the DNA sequence level, the grouping of mt-DNA
sequences of different ploidy CC supported the view
that the CC population possessed the same maternal
parent in their evolution. The Sox genes are located at
euchromosome in the nucleus, which were highly conserved in animals. However, we found many mutations
in the 1900-bp fragments of Sox4 gene in different
forms of CC. Besides, in the phylogenetic study, the
division of the 1900-bp sequences between polyploid CC
and 2nCC indicated that there was recombination during the formation of polyploid CC. This was strong evidence of the hybrid origin of 3nCC and 4nCC. In
addition, considering the possible hybrid origin and the
homogenous characteristics of the polyploid CC, genomic silencing was also indicated.

Conclusions
Hybridization played an important role in the process of
polyploidization, which not only brought in a heterogenous genome, but also resulted in microchromosomes,
which are of great importance in biological adaptability
and in maintaining the gene communion within the
population, and even in the whole process of biologic
evolution.
We further presumed that the polyploidy of CC originated from hybridization was probably due to human
activity. CC was miniature fish, living in certain territories. Populations of CC of different localities were
diversified by the isolation. The wild crucian carp in
China used to be detected as all diploid form; however,
the triploid forms came to public sight since 1980s. In
our opinion, together with the economic development
of China and the increasing human activities since
1980s, hybridization turned up among populations of
wild crucian carp that used to be diversified. Analogously, individuals of high ploidy have been discovered
for a long time in another triploid Ginbuna, Carassius
auratus langsdorfii (Cyprinidae, Pisces) [41]. It seemed
that due to the earlier economic development of Japan,
the polyploidization of crucian carp was caused by
hybridization and occurred earlier in Japan and later in
China. Hybridization brought in polyploidization, and

Page 12 of 15

form polyploid individuals. Thus, this kind of polyploidization was indirectly resulted from human activities.
Human activities would finally result in the change of
fish ploidy and influence evolution process.
Consequently, this is the first case about discovery of
tetraploid CC together with diploid and triploid forms
in a natural population in China. The series of breeding
tests and molecular and cellular analyses of the population provided valuable information. It was rather extraordinary discovery that 3nCC was bisexual fertile.
Substantial evidences pointed to the hybrid origin of the
polyploid CC. In a word, the natural CC population we
obtained in this study possesses great significance for
the study of polyploidization and the evolution of
vertebrates.

Methods
Source of samples

During 2005 to 2009, the sampled CC samples were
captured with townet from Xiangjiang River, Zijiang
River, Yuanjiang River, Lishui River and Dongting Lake
of the Dongting water system, Hunan province. The
ploidy of each sample was confirmed by detecting DNA
content of blood corpuscle. The different ploidy forms
were separately bred in the Engineering Research Center
of Polyploid Fish Breeding and Reproduction of State
Education Ministry located in Hunan Normal University. Other fish samples, including red crucian carp
(RCC), common carp and blunt snout bream were collected from the Engineering Research Center of Polyploid Fish Breeding and Reproduction of State
Education Ministry in Hunan Normal University.
Measurement of DNA content

To detect the ploidy of fish samples, a flow cytometer
(Partec GmbH) was employed for DNA content measurement. Red blood cells were collected from the caudal vein into syringes containing approximately 200-400
units of sodium heparin. The blood samples (5-10 μl of
each fish) were treated with DAPI DNA staining solution for 10-15 min, and then filtered. The DNA content
of diploid red crucian carp was used as a control. White
spermatic fluid samples were stripped out from mature
males of 3nCC, and then treated and tested as above.
The measurement of DNA content made it possible to
test the ploidy in a fast and accurate way with the least
harm to the samples.
Observation of the chromosomes of CC kidney cells

To determine the ploidy, five individuals of each ploidy
form that were previously determined by DNA content
were randomly sampled. Further chromosome counts
were done on kidney tissue of samples. After cultured
for 1-3 days at the water temperature of 22°C, the

Xiao et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/20

samples were injected with Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)
two times at a dose of 10 μg/g body weight. The interval
time of injection was 12-24 h. 2-6 hours prior to dissecting, each sample was injected with colchicine at a
dose of 2-4 μg/g body weight. The kidney tissue was
ground in 0.8% NaCl, followed by hypotonic treatment
with 0.075 M KCl at 37°C for 40-60 min and then fixed
in 3:1 methanol-acetic acid with three times. Two to
three drops of cell soliquoid were dropped onto cold,
wet slides and dried over a flame, then stained for 1 h
in Giemsa. Chromosome metaphases were observed and
photographed with Pixera Pro 600ES (US). For each
group of different ploidy, 200 good-quality metaphase
spreads were analyzed.
Measurement of morphological traits

To detect the appearance diversity in the population, 15
individuals of each ploidy form that were previously
determined by DNA content were randomly sampled
for morphologically examining. The countable traits
were examined including the number of dorsal fins, lateral scales, and upper and lower lateral scales. The measurable traits included the average values of the whole
length (WL), the body length (BL) and width (BW), the
head length (HL) and width (HW), and the tail length
(TL) and width (TW). Some measurable data were
changed into ratios.
Observation of the ovarian microstructure

Five female individuals of each ploidy form that were
previously determined by DNA content were randomly
sampled. The ovaries of different ploidy CC were fixed
in Bouin’s solution for preparation of tissue sections.
Paraffin-embedded sections were cut and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Ovarian structure was observed
with a Pixera Pro 600Es microscope.

from 2nCC and 3nCC during the reproductive season.
The samples were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde solution
for 4-10 h, and dropped onto slides after being washed
in phosphate buffer three times. The samples were then
transferred into 1% osmic acid solution for 1 h, dehydrated by an acetone gradient after being washed with
phosphate buffer. Following this, they were immersed in
tertiary butyl alcohol for 2 h, desiccated and gilded by
iron sputtering. An X-650 (HITA) SEM electron microscope was employed to observe the ultrastructure of the
samples. The spermatozoa head volume was calculated
by (4/3) πR2, where R is the radius of the sperm head.
Breeding tests

The eggs produced by 2nCC, 3nCC and 4nCC were fertilized with different species of distant relationships,
including intraspecific crossing, intergeneric crossing
(with Cyprinus carpio), inter-subfamily crossing (with
Megalobrama amblycephala), and crossing with UVirradiated spermatozoa of blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala). The milt of male blunt snout
bream were stripped, diluted with Hank’s solution (1:4),
and then poured into cold culture dishes to allow it to
form a thin layer (0.1-0.2 mm thick). The culture dishes
were put on ice and exposed to two UV lamps of 15W
at a distance of 10 cm. The irradiation lasted for 22-31
min with a continuous shaking. The irradiation was
monitored by the vitality of spermatozoa under a microscope. After UV irradiation, spermatozoa were kept in
glass tubes and stored at 4°C.
The progenies of each crossing were bred separately,
and then their morphological traits and gonadal structure were observed. The ploidy of every progeny was
detected by DNA content. Chromosome counts on
kidney tissues were done on five progenies of each form
of different ploidy which were randomly sampled from
each crossing.

Observation of the testis ultra-structure using TEM

Five male individuals of 2nCC and 3nCC that were previously determined by DNA content were randomly
sampled. The testis of mature male individuals of 2nCC
and 3nCC were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde solution,
transferred into osmic acid solution after being washed
by phosphate buffer, and finally dehydrated by an acetone gradient and embedded in Epon812. Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate. A Hitachi-600 electron microscope was used to
observe and photograph the ultra-structure of the
samples.
Observation of the sperm ultra-structure using SEM

Five male individuals of 2nCC and 3nCC that were previously determined by DNA content were randomly
sampled. Samples of white spermatic fluid were stripped

DNA Markers derived from the HMG-box of Sox genes

Degenerate primers [42] were used to amplify whole
genome DNA:
P (+): 5’-TGAAGCGACCCATGAA(C/T) G-3’;
P (-): 5’-AGGTCG (A/G) TACTT (A/G) TA (A/G)
T -3’.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications
were carried out in 25 μl final volume containing 80 ng
DNA, 200 μM of each dNTP, 0.25 μM of each primer
and 1.25 unit of Taq-polymerase. Cycle parameter was
as follows: 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
50°C for 45 s, 72°C for 80 s; and a final extension of
10 min at 72°C. The GeneAmp® PCR System 2700 thermal cycler was employed. Amplification products were
separated by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose gel.
The selected specific 1900bp bands were excised and

purified from the gel using a DNA Gel Extraction Kit
(Sangon), and ligated into the pMD18-T vector
(TakaRa). Positive clones were identified by blue/white
colony screening and PCR amplification, and then
sequenced on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI
PRISM 3730). For each group, over five individuals were
sequenced. The nucleotide sequence alignment is executed of the Sox gene by CLUSTALW2 (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/).
Sequence analysis of the complete mitochondrial DNA

PCR primers (Table 8) were designed based on the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of Cyprinidae fishes retrieved from GenBank. PCR amplification
was carried out in 50 μL reaction mixture containing
10-30 ng DNA, 5 μL 10 × Pfu Buffer, 1.5-2.0 mM
MgCl2,0.4 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP, and 1.2U
Pfu Taq DNA polymerase(TaKaRa). PCR conditions
were 94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 50-58°C
for 60 s, 72°C for 1-2 min, and a final extension at 72°C
for 10 min. PCR products were directly sequenced using
the primer walking method on an ABI 377 automatic
sequencer. All sequences were analyzed using Blast
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), CLUSTALW (2.0), and
MEGA 4.0 programs to determine the identity.

[GenBank:NC_002333.2]), Carassius cuvieri (Japanese crucian carp, [GenBank: AB045144.1]), Carassius carassius
red var. (red crucian carp, [GenBank: AY714387]). The
published 1900-bp Sox fragment of red crucian carp
(RCC, 1958bp) was also employed with the accession no.
[GenBank: EF219275]).
The phylogenetic tree was constructed on the complete
sequences of mtDNA using neighbor-joining (NJ) program
of MEGA (4.0) software package based on the Kimura 2parameters model. The statistical reliability was tested
using bootstrap support (BS). The BS values of nodes of
the subtree were obtained after 1000 replicates.
