Sperm competition and the evolution of sperm
design in mammals
Maximiliano Tourmente1,2, Montserrat Gomendio1*†, Eduardo RS Roldan1*†

Abstract
Background: The influence of sperm competition upon sperm size has been a controversial issue during the last
20 years which remains unresolved for mammals. The hypothesis that, when ejaculates compete with rival males,
an increase in sperm size would make sperm more competitive because it would increase sperm swimming speed,
has generated contradictory results from both theoretical and empirical studies. In addition, the debate has
extended to which sperm components should increase in size: the midpiece to accommodate more mitochondria
and produce more energy to fuel motility, or the principal piece to generate greater propulsion forces.
Results: In this study we examined the influence of sperm competition upon sperm design in mammals using a
much larger data set (226 species) than in previous analyses, and we corrected for phylogenetic effects by using a
more complete and resolved phylogeny, and more robust phylogenetic control methods. Our results show that, as
sperm competition increases, all sperm components increase in an integrated manner and sperm heads become
more elongated. The increase in sperm length was found to be associated with enhanced swimming velocity, an
adaptive trait under sperm competition.
Conclusions: We conclude that sperm competition has played an important role in the evolution of sperm design
in mammals, and discuss why previous studies have failed to detect it.

Background
Sperm competition occurs when females mate with more
than one male in each sexual cycle and sperm from rival
males compete to fertilize the ova [1]. A large body of
evidence has accumulated over the last few years showing
that sperm competition is a potent evolutionary force
that has shaped many reproductive traits [2-4]. An
almost universal response to sperm competition across
taxa is an increase in sperm numbers, which enhances
males’ fertilization success in competitive contexts [5-8].
Early theoretical models proposed that the increase in
sperm numbers under sperm competition was achieved at
the expense of a reduction in their size, leading to the evolution of tiny sperm [9,10]. The presumed trade-off
between sperm numbers and size is one of the most widely
accepted assumptions in studies of gamete evolution, particularly in relation to the evolution of anisogamy [9,11].

Most empirical studies have therefore assumed that a positive relationship between sperm numbers and size is evidence against the predicted trade-off, and following this
reasoning it has been concluded that there is no support
for the sperm size/number trade-off except in cases of
sperm gigantism [12,13] (reviewed in [14]). However,
sperm competition game models are not based on the
“direct trade-off”, which assumes a fixed budget for ejaculate expenditure and predicts a trade-off between sperm
size and numbers [15]. Instead, such models are based on
the “indirect trade-off” which assumes a fixed budget for
male reproductive activity and proposes that investment in
ejaculates is traded-off against energy spent on mate acquisition. Irrespective of this distinction, it is assumed that ejaculate expenditure is the product of the number of sperm
and their size [14]. Models developed by Parker [16] considered different advantages that could derive from an
increase in sperm size, and concluded that, if the main
selective benefit is that sperm become more competitive,
sperm competition should not select for an increase in
sperm size. Recent models [15] suggest that, even under
the indirect trade-off, sperm size and number do effectively

trade-off directly, even though both can increase with levels
of sperm competition as the total investment on the ejaculate increases. Other types of theoretical models used physical and biomechanical principles and concluded that, in
the micro-environment in which sperm perform, a relationship between sperm size and competitive ability (swimming velocity) is unlikely [17]. These theoretical models
had a profound influence in this field.
Contrary to these theoretical predictions, an alternative
hypothesis proposed that, if an increase in size conferred
a competitive advantage to sperm, sperm competition
should select simultaneously for an increase in sperm
numbers and size, and no trade-off between these two
traits should be expected [18]. Preliminary analyses with
the evidence available at the time suggested that sperm
competition did favour an increase in sperm size which
resulted in faster swimming speeds [18].
This hypothesis generated an intense controversy
which stimulated a great deal of work on the topic.
Empirical work produced an increasing amount of evidence showing that levels of sperm competition were
associated with increases in sperm size when interspecific studies were carried out on taxa as diverse as birds,
frogs, fish, butterflies, moths, nematodes (reviewed in
[19]) and snakes [20]. In some species in which females
posses sperm storage organs, this relationship did not
become apparent until the size of the female storage
organ was taken into account [5,21] (reviewed in [22]).
Different hypotheses were proposed to explain the functional significance of increases in the length of different
sperm components: an increase in the flagellum would
increase the thrust needed to propel the sperm forward
[18], an increase in midpiece volume would increase the
amount of energy to fuel sperm motility [20,23,24], and an
elongation of the sperm head would reduce the drag
experienced by the sperm cell resulting in an increase in
sperm swimming velocity [25]. It has also been suggested
that the ratios between different sperm components could
influence sperm swimming velocity [25] and, in particular,
that the ratio sperm head length/flagellum length should
play an important role [17].
Recent studies in mammals [19], birds [26], and fish
[27] have also provided evidence that sperm size is associated with sperm swimming speed, after phylogenetic
effects are taken into account, lending further support to
the original hypothesis [18]. Furthermore, intraspecific
studies have shown that sperm swimming speed is the
main determinant of fertilization success both in competitive [28,29] and non-competitive [30-32] contexts.
However, the evidence linking sperm competition
levels and sperm size in mammals remains contentious
due to inconsistencies between studies. An analysis
using a large sample of species reported a relationship
between levels of sperm competition and sperm size,

but the relation did not remain significant after phylogenetic effects were taken into account [33]. Because this
study included many more species that others, it has
been generally assumed that the information provided
was more reliable and, as a consequence, it is widely
accepted that no relationship exists between sperm
competition and sperm length among mammals (see, for
example, review in [34]). In addition, further studies on
mammals reported either no relationship between
sperm competition and sperm size [35], or an effect
exclusively on midpiece volume [23,24].
The aim of this study was to carry out the most
extensive study to date of the relationship between levels
of sperm competition and sperm design in mammals
using all the information currently available, which
includes a much larger data set and better resolved phylogenies than those used in previous studies. In addition,
we examine the relationship between sperm size and
sperm swimming velocity, controlling for phylogenetic
effects, in a larger data set than previously reported.

Results
In the study sample of 226 mammals (see additional file 1),
total sperm length ranged from 28 μm to 258 μm (CV =
43.8 ± 2.6). The head length accounted for a mean 9.4%
of the total sperm length, and it ranged from 3.0 to 15.2
μm (CV = 29.5% ± 0.2). Midpiece length represented a
mean 19.9% of the total sperm length (range 3.0-103.1
μm) and it showed higher interspecies variability (CV =
71.2% ± 0.9) than any other sperm component. The principal piece accounted for 70.5% of the total sperm length
(range: 15.6-142.6 μm; CV = 41.7% ± 1.9). Body mass and
testes mass were extremely variable (CV = 450.53% ±
29928.7 and 494.17% ± 27.6, respectively) when compared to sperm dimensions. On the other hand, relative
testes mass, which ranged from 0.07 to 5.23, presented a
variability (CV = 84.1% ± 0.1) closer to that seen for
sperm dimensions. A summary of information on body
mass, relative testes mass and sperm dimensions is
shown in additional file 2.
We found a significant positive association between
testes mass corrected for body mass (thereafter, relative
testes mass) and total sperm length after controlling for
phylogenetic effects (Table 1, Figure 1A). However, total
sperm length was not associated with body mass.
The same pattern emerged when the different sperm
components (head, midpiece, principal plus terminal
piece, and flagellum length) were analyzed separately,
since all of them became longer as relative testes mass
increased, but were unrelated to body mass after controlling for phylogenetic effects (Table 1, Figure 1B-E).
The strength of the relationship with relative testes
mass was similar for all sperm components except for
midpiece length which was just below significance level.

Phylogenetically controlled multiple regression analyses revealing the effect of relative testes mass on sperm dimensions and sperm velocity, and the effect of
sperm length and the proportion between sperm head and flagellum on sperm velocity. The superscripts following the l value indicate significance levels (n.s.
p > 0.05; * p < 0.05) in a likelihood ratio tests against models with l = 0 (first position) and l = 1 (second position). The effect size r calculated from the F values
and its non-central 95% confidence limits (CLs) are presented. Confidence intervals excluding 0 indicate statistically significant relationships. The p values and CL
that indicate statistical significance are shown in bold. Abbreviations: n: number of species in each analysis.

In addition, as relative testes mass increased sperm
heads became more elongated (measured as the ratio
head length/head width) (Table 1, Figure 1F).
Total sperm length showed a strong positive association with sperm swimming velocity (Table 1, Figure 2A).
Sperm swimming velocity was also significantly associated with relative testes mass, but not with body mass
(Table 1, Figure 2B). It is worth noting that relative
testes mass showed a stronger association with sperm
swimming velocity than with the size of any sperm component after controlling for phylogenetic effects, and
that the relationship between sperm size and sperm
swimming velocity is highly significant.
The ratio between head length and total flagellum
length was significantly associated with straight line
velocity (Table 1, Figure 3) so that as the proportion of
the flagellum length in relation to head length
decreased, sperm velocity also decreased.

Discussion
In the present study we found evidence suggesting that,
in mammals, sperm competition is associated with an
increase in total sperm length, which results from an
increase in size of all sperm components: head, midpiece, principal plus terminal piece and, hence, flagellum. All relationships between relative testes size (a
proxy of sperm competition levels) and sperm dimensions remained significant after controlling for phylogenetic effects, except for the midpiece, which was just
below significance level.

The use of relative testes mass as an index of levels
of sperm competition is widely accepted, since interspecific phylogenetic analyses and intra-specific comparisons have shown that both are closely associated
(reviewed in [8,36]). In addition, artificial selection
experiments have shown that the relationship is causal,
since experimental increases in sperm competition levels
lead to increases in relative testes size [37]. Recent interspecific analyses, controlling for other variables also
believed to influence testes size, show that relative testes
mass is clearly related to levels of sperm competition in
mammals [38]. The reason why an increase in relative
testes size, and therefore sperm production, seems a
universal response to levels of sperm competition is that
in most taxa sperm numbers influence fertilization
success and enhance male fertilization success in
competitive contexts [5-8,36].
Our results contrast with those reported by Gage and
Freckleton [33] who also found clear relationships
between sperm length, and the size of the different
sperm components, and relative testes size, although
these relationships were lost after controlling for phylogenetic effects. The reasons for this discrepancy may
have to do with the fact that our study has a much larger sample size (226 species in our study versus 83 species in that by Gage and Freckleton [33]) and that these
authors used an incorrect grouping of some species
(e.g., giraffe was included in Cervidae, Theropithecus
gelada was placed in the same group with Erythrocebus
patas and Cercopithecus aethiops rather than with

performance of phylogenetic control methods, to “an
unknown and potentially serious degree”.

However, we believe that the main reason for the disparity is that Gage and Freckleton [33] used a very
poorly resolved phylogeny that included 12 “soft” polytomies” (i.e., polytomies not due to true simultaneous

branching pattern) encompassing 57 out of the 83 (69%)
species in their study. The reason for this high number
of polytomies is that they used a phylogeny which was
only resolved up to the family level [40]. In contrast, the
phylogeny we used in this study includes only one soft
polytomy that affects 3 out of 226 species (1.3%)
because we have integrated phylogenetic information for
specific groups to avoid the problems associated with
low resolution.
There has been much discussion about the effect of
polytomies on phylogenetic control methods, and while
some authors conclude that a low quality phylogenetic
reconstruction is preferable to no phylogenetic control
at all [41,42], most studies agree that soft polytomies
cause analytical problems for these kind of methods
[39,43,44]. Moreover, although these studies recommend
possible solutions in the form of analytical methods
that reduce degrees of freedom [39,43], estimative
approaches using complementary variables [45], random
sampling of constrained phylogenies [46], and incorporation of phylogenetic uncertainty into the model via
Bayesian methods [47], these approaches have lower statistical power when compared with an analysis that uses
a better resolved phylogeny. It is unclear whether Gage
and Freckleton [33] used any of these methods to
account for the lack of resolution of their phylogeny.
The contrast between results (and conclusions) obtained
with phylogenies varying in the degree of resolution
highlights the need to obtain detailed phylogenetic
information to avoid losing meaningful biological relationships when controlling for phylogenetic effects.
To directly examine the possible impact of a poorly
resolved phylogeny, we re-analyzed the data in Gage
and Freckleton [33] using the detailed phylogenetic
reconstruction we used for this study. When doing so,
we realized that data for a very few species in Gage and

Page 5 of 10

Freckleton’s dataset were in fact inadequate. We decided
not to include these data to avoid further errors in the
analyses. Out of a total of 83 species in the study by
Gage and Freckleton [33] we chose to exclude 5 species
for the following reasons. Gage and Freckleton [33]
included only one species of marsupial (Antechinus
stuartii) despite the fact that data for many species of
marsupials were available at the time of their study
[2,48]. The reasons why Gage and Freckleton selected
only one species of marsupial is not given in their work
and we felt that inclusion of only one species of this
clade seriously biased the analysis; the inclusion of a single species from a distantly related clade could affect the
outcome of phylogentic analyses. Furthermore, marsupials have a different reproductive biology so the predictions in relation to sperm size are likely to differ. Future
studies should address evolution of marsupial sperm
taking these factors into consideration. The analysis originally carried out by Gage and Freckleton [33] also
included a single cetacean species (Megaptera novaeangliae). We decided not to include it in the analyses for
the same reasons (i.e., there was information for more
cetacean species [48,49] and it was not clear why this
particular species was chosen), plus the fact that in cetaceans the scaling of organ/body size is under rather
unique constraints (in particular, the testes) due to the
selection on streamlined bodies in marine environments.
Finally, we also did not include three ungulate species:
two species (Cervus elaphus, Equus grevyi) were not
considered because data on sperm size came from
“approximations” calculated from drawings that had no
scale (data originally from [48]) whereas one species
(Tayassu tajacu) was not included because data come
from measurements of testis sections (data originally
from [48]) and this ignores the post-testicular changes
in morphology experimented by spermatozoa.
Thus, when we carried out the re-analysis using the
data in the original study by Gage and Freckleton (with
the exclusion of questionable data from only 5 out of 83
species) and a well-resolved phylogeny, we found strong
positive associations between relative testes size and all
sperm components. To verify that the outcome of this
re-analysis was not due to the exclusion of the 5 species,
we also re-analyzed this dataset using the original phylogeny used by Gage and Freckleton [33]. The results
showed no significant association between relative testes
size and sperm dimensions (with the exception of head
length, which showed a significant association). Thus,
when controlling for phylogenetic effects, the same dataset revealed significant relationships with a well-resolved
phylogeny which were lost when a poorly-resolved phylogeny was used. We conclude that the lack of association between relative testes size and sperm dimensions
in the study by Gage and Freckleton [33] was due

Tourmente et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/12

mainly to the use of a poorly-resolved phylogeny. Therefore, and contrary to the conclusion by Gage and Freckleton [33], our analyses allow us to conclude that the
relationship between sperm dimensions and sperm competition in mammals remains robust after adequately
controlling for phylogenetic effects.
There are also some discrepancies between our results
and those in other studies on mammals. They can be
explained, at least partly, by the different representation
of species from different orders in the data sets used.
A study on bats found no relationships between levels
of sperm competition and sperm dimensions [35].
Because female bats store sperm during hibernation, the
need for sperm to survive inside the female reproductive
tract for up to several months could imply that in bats
sperm competition favours sperm traits which enhance
their longevity, rather than their swimming speed. Studies by Dixson and colleagues failed to find relationships
between levels of sperm competition and sperm length,
or length of various sperm components, first in primates
[23] and, subsequently, in mammals [24]. However,
since their data derived from samples collected from
caudae epididymides during post-mortem dissections of
their zoo animals, it consisted primarily of artiodactyls
and primates, and included a low number of carnivores
and only two species of rodents. Thus, the lack of a
relationship between levels of sperm competition and
the dimensions of different sperm components found in
these studies could be due to an over representation of
artiodactyls, carnivores and primates which have lower
diversity in sperm dimensions [50]. Intriguingly, Dixson
and colleagues found a relationship between sperm
competition levels and sperm midpiece volume [23,24].
The reason why midpiece volume but not midpiece
length showed a significant relation is not clear, since
data show that there is very little variation in midpiece
length in artiodactyls, carnivores and primates (see additional file 1). It may be that the width of the midpiece
accounts for most of the variation in midpiece volume
because of the way it was calculated in that study.
Sperm competition seems to act on all sperm components in an integrative manner, because they are all
functionally important and may all contribute in complementary ways to enhance sperm swimming velocity: an
increase in midpiece size probably increases energy output [23], and longer principal pieces will generate greater
thrust to propel the sperm along the female reproductive
tract [18] and generate additional energy [19]. In addition, our study also found that sperm competition levels
are also associated to the degree of elongation of the
sperm head, a trait which has received little attention
despite the major role it could play in sperm hydrodynamics. Recent intraspecific studies have shown that the
degree of elongation of the sperm head has the strongest

Page 6 of 10

impact upon sperm swimming velocity [25], because it
reduces the degree of drag and thus the energy needed
for sperm movement [51]. Thus, relatively subtle differences in the shape of the sperm head seem to have a
great impact upon swimming performance.
We have also been able to show that as sperm become
longer, sperm swimming velocity increases. These findings expand on previous work [19] and agree with those
recently reported for birds [26], fish [27] and sea urchin
[52]. Furthermore, we have been able to reveal a direct
relationship between levels of sperm competition and
sperm swimming speed, a link that other studies have
failed to find [26]. Interestingly, relative testes size is
more strongly associated with sperm swimming velocity
than it is with the size of any sperm component, and
the relationship between sperm size and sperm swimming velocity is by far the strongest of all the relationships found. This means that relatively small changes in
the size of all sperm components and the shape of the
head have a major impact on sperm swimming velocity.
Finally, we show that sperm velocity is inversely
related to the ratio between head length and flagellum
length. Humphries et al. [17] suggested that, since
sperm cells are extremely small, thus operating in a low
Reynolds number environment, sperm velocity should
be determined by the balance between the propulsive
force (which would increase with flagellum length) and
drag (which would be related to head length). Our findings represent the first comparative evidence supporting
this hypothesis, for which a recent intraspecific study
also found support [53].
While the picture emerging from interspecific studies
seems to support the hypothesis that sperm competition
favours increases in sperm size, which enhance sperm
swimming velocity resulting in improved fertilization
success, the intraspecific studies seem contradictory.
Thus, a number of studies show a relationship between
sperm dimensions and velocity [25,53,54], whereas a
recent review revealed that some intraspecific studies
did not find a relationship [17]. This may be due to the
fact that the methodology used has enough resolution to
detect relationships between species because they differ
to a large extent in sperm size, but is insufficient to
detect them at the intraspecific level given the small
magnitude of differences and the large degree of variation within species and within males. A recent intraspecific study [52] has shown that when sperm data on size
and swimming velocity come from the same spermatozoa, the relationship is clear. However, when data on
size come from a different sperm subsample than data
on sperm swimming velocity (as is the case in most studies) such relationships are not found.
Other intraspecific studies have concluded that small
sperm are more competitive (e.g. [55,56]. Studies on

Tourmente et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/12

insect models suffer from the limitation that so far it has
not been possible to evaluate sperm swimming velocity
in these species. Thus, the potential relationships
between sperm size and sperm swimming velocity cannot be evaluated in these taxa until the technical difficulties are solved. It should also be noted that most
intraspecific studies do not actually measure “fertilization success” but rather some measure of paternity success. Thus, they cannot exclude other factors that could
be playing a role at any stage after fertilization and during embryo development.
Despite these caveats, it is plausible that the benefits
of increasing/decreasing sperm size vary between taxa.
Since many intraspecific studies have been carried out
on insects, one possibility is that because in this particular group sperm remain in storage organs for long periods of time, variables other than sperm size may be
more important at determining fertilization success.
Thus, sperm longevity may be the major determinant of
fertilization success. If so, small sperm may be at an
advantage if they are able to survive for longer, as
shown in external fertilizers [31], but the information
currently available does not allow to test this hypothesis
properly.
The relevance of our findings for other taxa is supported by evidence from a recent review showing that
the relationship between sperm competition and sperm
size is widespread across taxa [19]. Since female mammals have no sperm storage organs, sperm survive for
short periods of time in the female reproductive tract
and have to overcome relatively long distances to reach
the ova. Under these conditions fertilization success is
determined mainly by sperm swimming velocity [32],
and there are no confounding effects of co-evolution
between sperm size and female storage organs. Thus, it
is in this system that the race to fertilize the ova is likely
to be the most important underlying mechanism
explaining fertilization success in competitive contexts.
The outcome is that sperm competition selects for both
increased sperm numbers and size, so total ejaculate
expenditure increases. The increase in ejaculate expenditure is energetically costly [57,58], but whether it
requires a trade-off with mating acquisition, or other
life-history traits [e.g. [59-61]], remains to be explored.

Conclusions
Our findings provide further support to the original
hypothesis that the main adaptive value of changes in
sperm design under sperm competition is that they
increase sperm swimming velocity [18]. Since a number
of studies have shown that sperm swimming velocity is
a main determinant of fertilization success
[19,28,29,32,62], this explains why it is targeted by sexual selection so efficiently.

This study presents phylogenetically-robust evidence
that sperm competition in mammals favours an
increase in the size of all sperm components and an
elongation of the head, which result in faster swimming speeds.

Methods
The study sample includes all eutherian mammals for
which information was obtained. In those cases in
which different values for the same species were available from different studies, averages were used. We have
not included in the analysis a few species for which the
only data available were “approximations from Retzius’
illustrations” because they lacked a reference scale (see
Methods and footnote to Table 1 in [48]). Additionally,
we have not included Chiroptera due to their unusual
reproductive traits which include sperm storage for long
periods of time in the female tract.
Sperm competition levels, sperm design and sperm
swimming velocity

Data on relative testes mass and sperm dimensions were
obtained from the literature for 226 species (39 families)
of eutherian mammals (see additional file 1 for data and
additional file 3 for references). Sperm dimensions
included total sperm length (TSL), head length (HL),
head width (HW), midpiece length (MPL), principal
piece length (PPL), and total flagellum length (TFL). We
also calculated the ratio HL/HW.
Data on sperm swimming velocity from fresh, noncapacitated sperm were obtained from the literature for
26 species (15 families) of eutherian mammals (see
additional file 4 for data and additional file 3 for references). We used information on average straight-line
velocity (VSL: velocity calculated using the straight-line
distance between the beginning and end of the sperm
track), since it is a commonly used measure of sperm
swimming velocity. In any case, VSL significantly correlates with other sperm swimming parameters such as
curvilinear velocity (VCL) or average-path velocity
(VAP) [19,32].
Data analyses

To test whether levels of sperm competition were associated with sperm dimensions, we performed multiple
regression analyses using HL, MPL, PPL, TFL, TSL, HL/
HW ratio and VSL for all species as dependent variables
and relative testes mass (a proxy of sperm competition
levels) as predictor. To accurately represent relative
testes mass as a measure of sperm competition [38], we
performed multiple regression analyses including both
log10-transformed testes mass and body mass as predictors of sperm dimensions. Since predictor variables were
related to each other (thus non orthogonal) (additional

Tourmente et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/12

file 5), multiple regression analysis was performed using
a sequential (Type I) sum of squares, in which the predictor variables were added to the model in the following order: body mass, testes mass.
Species data may not be free of phylogenetic association, since they may share character values as a result of
a common ancestry rather than independent evolution
[63], and thus may not be truly independent [64]. To
control for this phylogenetic inertia, we used a generalized least-squares (GLS) approach in a phylogenetic framework [41]. This method estimates a phylogenetic
scaling parameter lambda (l) which represents the
transformation that makes the data fit the Brownian
motion evolutionary model. If l values are close to 0,
the variables are likely to have evolved independently of
phylogeny, whereas l values close to 1 indicate strong
phylogenetic association of the variables. As an advantage, GLS allows a variable degree of phylogenetic correction according to each tested model, accounting for
different levels of phylogenetic association between different traits. The estimation of l values and GLS analyses were performed using a code written by
R. Freckleton for the statistical package R v.2.8.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2009) and the
maximum likelihood value of l was compared against
models with l = 1 and l = 0.
A complete phylogeny for all analyzed species was not
available. Therefore, a phylogenetic reconstruction was
used (additional file 6). Morphological and molecular
trees constructed for the Eutheria were used to determine the phylogenetic position of the higher groups
(orders and families), and group-specific phylogenies
(both morphological and molecular) were used in the
case of the groups that accounted for more than two
species (references in additional file 3).
All statistical analyses were conducted with R v.2.8.1,
and p-values were considered statistically significant at
a < 0.05. We avoided the use of Bonferroni correction
since it increases the chances of committing type II
errors [65]. Alternatively, we calculated the effect size r
from F values [66-68] obtained from the GLS model;
effect sizes ≥ 0.5 were considered large [69]. Finally, we
calculated the non-central confidence limits (CLs) for r,
which indicate statistical significance if 0 is not contained within the interval [70].
To be able to show values for relative testes mass in
the figures, values were calculated by dividing the actual
testes mass by the predicted testes mass, which was
obtained using the allometric relation between testes
mass and body mass predicted by Kenagy and Trombulak [49] for all mammalian species: testes mass = 0.035
× body mass 0.72 . However, because this measure has
been criticized as an inaccurate index of sperm

Page 8 of 10

competition levels due to allometric problems [71], we
have not used it in any of the statistical analyses.
