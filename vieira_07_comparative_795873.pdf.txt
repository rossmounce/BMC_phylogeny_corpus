family member genes analysis of the odorant binding protein family in 12 Drosophilaspecies.</p>

Abstract
Background: Chemoreception is a widespread mechanism that is involved in critical biologic
processes, including individual and social behavior. The insect peripheral olfactory system
comprises three major multigene families: the olfactory receptor (Or), the gustatory receptor (Gr),
and the odorant-binding protein (OBP) families. Members of the latter family establish the first
contact with the odorants, and thus constitute the first step in the chemosensory transduction
pathway.
Results: Comparative analysis of the OBP family in 12 Drosophila genomes allowed the
identification of 595 genes that encode putative functional and nonfunctional members in extant
species, with 43 gene gains and 28 gene losses (15 deletions and 13 pseudogenization events). The
evolution of this family shows tandem gene duplication events, progressive divergence in DNA and
amino acid sequence, and prevalence of pseudogenization events in external branches of the
phylogenetic tree. We observed that the OBP arrangement in clusters is maintained across the
Drosophila species and that purifying selection governs the evolution of the family; nevertheless,
OBP genes differ in their functional constraints levels. Finally, we detect that the OBP repertoire
evolves more rapidly in the specialist lineages of the Drosophila melanogaster group (D. sechellia and
D. erecta) than in their closest generalists.
Conclusion: Overall, the evolution of the OBP multigene family is consistent with the birth-anddeath model. We also found that members of this family exhibit different functional constraints,
which is indicative of some functional divergence, and that they might be involved in some of the
specialization processes that occurred through the diversification of the Drosophila genus.

Background

Olfaction plays a major role in the fitness of an organism, providing the odor and pheromone perception essential for its
survival and reproduction. The olfactory system of insects has

a great sensitivity and specificity. Indeed, the identification of
odors is critical in a range of activities, including detection of
food sources, egg-laying substrates, mates, and predators,
and it also facilitates communication and social coordination.

An understanding of the evolution of genes involved in olfactory perception may therefore provide insights into the role
played by adaptation at the molecular level. In fact, positive
selection has been proposed to explain the evolution of a
number of olfactory system genes, both in insects and vertebrates (for example [1-7]).

involved in the peripheral events of chemosensory perception
[7,33,34]: the OBPs, Ors, and gustatory receptors (Grs).
Interestingly, the gene repertoire number across families is
similar in D. melanogaster (51, 62 and 68 for OBPs, Ors and
Grs, respectively) and in Anopheles gambiae (66, 79 and 76
for OBPs, Ors and Grs, respectively). In Apis mellifera, however, the three families expanded differently (21, 170 and 10
for OBPs, Ors and Grs, respectively). These three species nevertheless share a common distribution pattern: OBP members are clustered, whereas Ors and Grs are more scattered
across the genome. The organization of the OBP repertoire
also differs among species. In Anopheles, OBP clusters are
smaller and more dispersed than in D. melanogaster and
include members of all previously identified subfamilies but
also members of a new atypical class [33]. In Apis mellifera
the OBP genes are also organized in genomic clusters [7]
despite the reduced number of genes (21 members); the honeybee genome nevertheless contains members of only two
OBP subfamilies.

In Drosophila, the olfactory system is restricted to the third
antennal segment and the maxillary palp [8]. The chemical
signals (the odorants) are detected in the aqueous lymph of
the chemosensory hairs, the olfactory sensilla, where there
exists a high concentration of odorant-binding proteins
(OBPs). The OBPs are small (10 to 30 kDa), globular, and
rather abundant water-soluble proteins that are synthesized
and secreted by auxiliary cells surrounding the olfactory
receptor neurons [9-12]. These molecules are characterized
by a specific protein domain that comprises six α-helices
joined by three disulfide bonds [13-15]. Although the full
function of the OBPs is not well established, it is believed that
they may act as molecular carriers that transport odorants
and deliver them to the olfactory receptors (Ors), located on
the sensory neurons [10,16-20]. In addition, the OBPs might
play active roles in the olfactory code [21-26] as well as in
stimulus inactivation [18,27,28]. Moreover, expression analyses in a number of insect species indicate that OBPs are not
restricted to the olfactory tissues and in fact may also participate in other physiologic functions (for review [29]). Despite
the fact that some OBPs from vertebrates and insects have
equivalent functions, they are not homologous and actually
differ in structure and size [30].
In insects, the OBP genes constitute a quite old multigene
family, with their most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
tracing back at least to the origin of insects. In spite the high
conservation at the protein structure level [15], OBP members
are fairly divergent. Based on amino acid similarity, the Lepidoptera OBP gene family was subdivided into three subfamilies: the general odorant-binding proteins, which
probably bind and transport general odorants; the pheromone-binding proteins, which were proposed to be specialized
in pheromone perception; and the antennal-binding protein
X, with a function that is still to be elucidated. Although other
insects have some OBP sequences that are closely related with
those of Lepidoptera, essentially they cluster following the
species phylogenetic relationships (for review [29]).
In Drosophila melanogaster, the OBP multigene family comprises 51 members [31], which is a number quite similar to
that of the Or multigene family (62 Or genes [32]). Despite
this, OBP and Or genes exhibit a markedly different genomic
distribution; whereas OBP genes are mainly organized in
clusters, Or members are scattered across the whole genome.
The recent availability of the genome sequences of the
malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the honeybee Apis
mellifera provided insight into the genomic organization of
members of the three major multigene families that are

The recent availability of the whole genome sequence for 12
species of the Drosophila genus represents a first opportunity
to conduct a fine-scale molecular evolution analysis in a complete multigene family on a suitable time scale. Here, we analyzed the complete OBP gene repertoire in these Drosophila
spp. In particular, we reconstructed the evolutionary history
of these genes to determine the global mode of evolution of
the OBP multigene family, and to gain insight into the selective forces that drive the evolution of these olfactory-specific
genes. We show that the OBP multigene family evolves in
accordance with the birth-and-death model, and we estimate
the number of gene gains and losses in each lineage and the
birth-and-death rates. Additionally, we report significant
insight into the origin and fate of the OBP duplicate copies as
well as the distribution of functional constraints among generalist and specialist Drosophila spp.

Results
Odorant-binding protein multigene family
Available comparative analysis freeze 1 annotations and current searches using TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST allowed the
identification of a total of 595 OBP genes (Figure 1 and Additional data file 4) that encode putative functional and nonfunctional OBPs across the genome of the 12 Drosophila spp.
This number includes orthologs of the 51 genes already annotated in D. melanogaster [31] as well as a number of gene
gains in specific Drosophila lineages (Figure 1). Overall, we
identified 54 OBP orthologous groups, including orthologs
and co-orthologs, among the Drosophila spp. (see Additional
data file 4); 34 of these groups include at least one member in
all 12 Drosophila spp. Altogether, 580 OBP genes appear to
be functional, having neither frameshift nor premature stop
mutations; five of them nevertheless have an incomplete DNA
sequence. In addition, 15 members probably represent pseudogenes because they are defective in length, lack splicing

sites, or have incorrect transcription termination signals
(premature stop codons). We also analyzed four additional
OBP-like members, namely the chemosensory proteins
(CSPs), which might represent a new class of OBP [35]. The
CSP genes have orthologs in all 12 Drosophila genomes. Nevertheless, one D. ananassae member appears to be a
pseudogene.
Overall, we inferred 43 gene gains and 28 gene losses (15 deletions and 13 pseudogenization events) across the evolution of
the 12 species (Figure 1). Interestingly, deletions and pseudogenization events were not randomly distributed. Actually,
11 of such pseudogenization events were in external branches
of the phylogeny, whereas the remaining two were in the

internal branch leading to the short D. pseudoobscura and D.
persimilis lineages (χ2 test; P = 0.037 and P = 0.004 using all
13 pseudogenization events, and excluding events in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis lineages, respectively). We also
found that the relation between extant genes and gene duplication events were not evenly distributed among the Drosophila chromosome arms (known as Muller elements;
Fisher's exact test, P = 0.011). Indeed, 37 out of 43 inferred
duplication events were located on Muller's C element,
whereas this element harbors just about half of the OBP genes
(29 genes in D. melanogaster). This feature therefore suggests that the gene duplication rate is higher in high-density
OBP gene regions. As expected, new duplicate genes are much
more likely to be lost because of a pseudogenization event

than are older ones (χ2 test; P = 9.00 × 10-12, for duplication
events on external branches of the tree).

DmojObp99c gene (a member of the cluster 10, which
appears isolated in D. mojavensis) and the DwilObp56e
member (transcription of which occurs in the opposite direction in D. willistoni). Although gene clusters have changed
their relative physical position across species, they are always
maintained in the same Muller element, with the sole exception corresponding to one case in D. ananassae. This feature
points to chromosomal inversions as being the main mechanism responsible for these rearrangements. As previously
observed in D. melanogaster [31], the locations of OBP genes
across Drosophila chromosomes are not randomly distributed, with the majority of OBP genes (82%) being in Muller's
C and E elements.

All predicted OBP proteins have the hallmarks feature of the
family: the α-helix pattern, the highly conserved cysteine profile, the typical basic secondary-structure (Figure 2), and
probably a globular water-soluble nature. Moreover, we also
identified the signal peptide sequence region on the aminoterminus of the protein in nearly all OBPs. However, these
genes are rather diverse (the overall amino acid divergence
per site is 3.01, about 17% amino acid identity), differing in
the numbers of amino acid residues, α-helices, and putative
disulfide bonds. On this basis, the 58 Drosophila OBP-CSP
orthologous groups fall into three of the four groups
described by Zhou and coworkers [36]: 41 in the classic OBPs
(six cysteines, four to six α-helices, and 111 to 280 amino
acids, excluding dimer and minus-C OBP genes), 13 in the
plus-C class (12 cysteines and one proline, six to eight α-helices, and 170 and 245 amino acids), and four in the CSP (four
cysteines, six α-helices, and 112 to 155 amino acids) group.
The atypical OBP group (nine to ten cysteines), described in
A. gambiae [33], is not represented in the Drosophila genus.
The average amino acid divergence per site within orthologous groups is 0.39 (71% amino acid identity), ranging from
0.15 to 1.02.
From the OBP members present only in extant species, we
estimated the OBP birth-and-death (λ) rate per copy and million years [37,38] to be 0.0053 to 0.0081, using Drosophila
divergence times from Tamura and coworkers [39] and Russo
and colleagues [40], respectively. Information of the inferred
numbers of gene gain and loss events in each branch of the
phylogeny (Figure 1) allows us to estimate the birth-anddeath rates separately (equations 1 and 2; see materials and
methods, below). Using the same divergence times, the birth
rate (β) is 0.0024 to 0.0040, whereas the death rate (δ) is
0.0016 to 0.0026.

Chromosomal distribution of odorant-binding protein
genes
It has been shown that the distribution of OBP genes in insect
genomes is not random and that they usually occur in
genomic clusters [7,31,33]. This feature was also observed
across the genomes of the 12 Drosophila spp., in which 69%
of OBP genes are arranged in clusters. Operationally, we consider that n closely linked OBP genes form a genomic cluster
if they are arranged within a genomic region of 10(n - 1) kilobases (the average gene density in Drosophila is approximately of one gene per 10 kilobases), or within a genomic
region having fewer than n - 1 non-OBP genes. In the 12
genomes, we identified ten clusters of two to six OBP genes
(Additional data files 1 and 5; also see Figure 3). Although the
genome assembly is not fully completed for all Drosophila
spp., we were able to determine that these clusters, including
the direction of transcription of its members, are conserved
across the 12 species. The only two exceptions are the

Phylogenetic analysis
We conducted a phylogenetic analysis including the OBP proteins from Drosophila spp. and representatives of the OBP
subfamilies from other insects (Anopheles gambiae, Apis
mellifera, and Tribolium castaneum). The results (Figure 4)
clearly show that orthologous groups of Drosophila share a
MRCA more recent (nearly all posterior probabilities are
greater than 99%) than that of the paralogous copies. Hence,
OBP genes have evolved independently since their origin by
gene duplication. This result is in accordance with the negative outcome of the gene conversion analysis (results not
shown). The phylogenetic analysis shows that all CSP members form a monophyletic clade, tracing the OBP-CSP genes
back to the origin of the arthropods [29]. The analysis also
confirms the previously proposed phylogenetic subfamilies
(classic and plus-C). However, the classic OBP subfamily [33]
can be further subdivided into other phylogenetic clades (Figure 4 and Additional data file 5), including those described by
Hekmat-Scafe and coworkers [31] and Zhou and coworkers
[41]. The two dimer OBP genes (Obp83cd and Obp83ef) are
composed by two consecutive OBP domains, and probably
originated from a gene duplication event or by fusion of two
linked OBP genes; regardless, each component would belong
to the minus-C group. In general, the exon/intron gene structure is relatively well conserved within phylogenetic groups,
supporting the evolutionary meaning of the previous classification (Additional data file 2). The average amino acid divergence within each phylogenetic clade is 1.89 (about 33%
amino acid identity). In addition, we found a significant association between phylogenetic subfamilies and genomic clusters (Fisher's exact test, P < 1 × 10-15); specifically, the OBP
members of a given genomic cluster tend to be phylogenetically related.

Natural selection on the odorant-binding protein
multigene family
We studied the selective forces acting on the OBP gene family
in the six species of the Drosophila melanogaster group (see
Materials and methods, below); the analysis was conducted
using the orthologous groups with a full coding DNA
sequence in each of the six species (42 multiple sequence
alignments; Additional data file 6). Overall, the maximum

likelihood estimates of the ω parameter are relatively low
(average ω = 0.153), suggesting that purifying selection is the
predominant force acting on the evolution of the OBP gene
family (Figure 5). Interestingly, we detected heterogeneity in
the ω values across OBP genes (P = 2.1 × 10-10), suggesting
some functional constraint differences. The likelihood ratio

test contrasting the one ratio (M0) and the free ratio (FR)

14 cases (four cases after controlling for the false discovery

functional constraints across the Drosophila genus. The D.
sechellia lineage exhibits greater ω values in three of these

four genes, namely DsecObp19b, DsecObp56c, and
DsecObp58b (see below). Interestingly, the FR model applied
to the concatenated data (the multiple sequence alignments
of the 42 orthologous groups) fits the data significantly better
than does the M0 model (P = 4.04 × 10-20), revealing an episodic mode of evolution; that is, the overall selective constraint levels fluctuate across the melanogaster group
lineages (Figure 6).
We have also studied putative OBP evolutionary rate differences between specialist (D. sechellia and D. erecta) and generalist (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, and D.
ananassae) species across the melanogaster group of Drosophila [42-45], by assessing the fit of the M0spec model to
the OBP data (see Materials and methods, below). This model
fits the data significantly better than the M0 model (null
hypothesis) for 17 OBPs (11 cases after controlling for the false
discovery rate). For the total concatenated dataset, the
M0spec model also fits the data significantly better than M0
(P = 9.42 × 10-24; Figure 6), whereas the FR model failed to
reject it (P = 0.699). In fact, the ω ratios in the OBP genes in
specialist lineages are significantly higher than those in the
generalists (Paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.0009), further supporting the hypothesis of a change in the selective
constraints in these lineages [45].
The maximum likelihood analysis using codon evolution
models allowing for heterogeneity in the distribution of the ω
ratio along the amino acid sequence reveals significant results
in most Drosophila OBP genes. As a matter of fact, there are

two distinct classes of amino acid evolving positions (40 significant comparisons after controlling for the false discovery
rate; M3 [K = 2] model, average ω0 = 0.033 and ω1 = 0.513).
However, these tests failed to detect significant evidence of
positive selection in OBP evolution across the melanogaster
group (that is, the M1 and M7 models could not be rejected).
This analysis applied to the concatenated data confirms that
M3 model fits the data better than does M0 (P < 0.0001; 75%
positions with ω0 = 0.038, and the rest with ω1 = 0.591).
Overall, we did not detect significant differences in the global
ω values (M3 [K = 2] model) across Muller elements (sum of
squares between groups [SSB] test, P = 0.706), genomic clusters (SSB test, P = 0.083), or phylogenetic subfamilies (SSB
test, P = 0.118; Additional data file 3). Interestingly, the estimated ω0 and ω1 values differ across chromosomal clusters
(SSB test, P = 0.021 and P = 0.057, respectively; Figure 7).
Although close to the critical value, we did not find significant
association between temporal gene expression pattern and
phylogenetic groups or genomic clusters (Fisher's exact test,
P = 0.070 and P = 0.146, respectively). However, this result
should be interpreted with caution because the data on OBP
expression patterns are still incomplete.

Discussion

The availability of the complete genome sequence of 12 phylogenetically close Drosophila spp. represents a milestone in
comparative genomics. The phylogenetically guided analysis
of genome information can provide a fine description of the

Indeed, analysis of currently available genome information
can provide insight into the major forces that shape gene family evolution. Here, we conducted an exhaustive gene-by-gene

bioinformatic analysis, precisely identifying orthologous
members and the number of gene gains and losses, which
allows one to draw accurate evolutionary inferences. We show
that, in the Drosophila genus the number of OBP genes is
moderately variable (from 40 to 61 genes) across species

diverging only about 40 to 60 million years [39,40], and that
the MRCA of the 12 Drosophila species had 47 genes.
Moreover, the species visibly differ with respect to pseudogenes; although the number of nonfunctional genes is nearly
the same (from 0 to 3 copies per species), they represent different pseudogenization events, except for the two pseudogenes identified in the closest species D. pseudoobscura and
D. persimilis. The 12 Drosophila spp. Nevertheless maintain
the basic chromosomal organization of the OBP genes in clusters; however, although the relative physical position of clusters differs among species, they are always maintained within
the same Muller element. This feature therefore points to
chromosomal inversions as being the main mechanism
responsible for chromosomal rearrangements [46-48].
Several models have been proposed to explain the global evolution of multigene families (for review [49]). There are three
basic models. The divergent evolution model [50] postulates
that duplicate copies diverge in a gradual manner and that
new functions are acquired progressively. The concerted evolution scenario [51] proposes that gene family members
evolve in a concerted manner through gene conversion, unequal crossover, or gene amplification [52]. More recently proposed [53] is the birth-and-death model of gene family
evolution, which states that the new genes are created by gene
duplication and are lost by deletions or become nonfunctional
accumulating deleterious mutations. Under the latter model,
different gene duplicates would differ in the times that they

are maintained in the genome. The controversy over the relative importance and interplay of these multigene family evolution models currently remains active [49,54]; two critical
limiting issues are the lack of DNA sequence data from the
complete set of genes and pseudogenes in multiple genomes,
and the partial knowledge of the gene conversion mechanism
and therefore of its significance.
Analysis of the whole set of OBP genes and pseudogenes in
the complete genome of the 12 Drosophila spp. clearly points
to birth-and-death as being the major model for the evolution
of the OBP multigene family. First, the phylogenetic analysis
shows that orthologous groups share a MRCA more recent
than that of paralogous groups (the average amino acid divergence within orthologous groups is much lower than estimates, including orthologous and paralogous), in addition to
the lack of evidence supporting gene conversion. Second,
orthologous copies fit very well the accepted phylogeny of the
species. Third, we detected a number of gene gain and loss
events in numerous lineages of the phylogeny. Fourth, we also
identified several nonfunctional members (pseudogenes).
Therefore, OBP genes would evolve independently from their
origin by gene duplication until their loss by deletion or transiently as a pseudogene.
Under the birth-and-death model, the new duplicate genes
are eventually lost from the genome by two basic processes:
by a deletion or via pseudogenization. Our study shows that

all pseudogenization events, except for the two inferred in the
ancestral branch leading to the short D. pseudoobscura and
D. persimilis lineages, occurred in terminal branches. It is
most likely that the failure to detect pseudogenes on internal
phylogeny branches is caused by the short half-life of pseudogenes (the elapsing time before a pseudogene can no longer
be recognized as a member of its original sequence family is
very short). Therefore, we cannot quantify the relative magnitude of the two processes. Nonetheless, the uneven distribution of deletions and pseudogenizations on internal and
external branches of the phylogeny suggests that several gene
losses detected as deletions were initially triggered by a pseudogenization event.
Our comparative genome analysis has also provided insights
into the rates of the origin and loss of duplicate genes. In particular, we estimated the birth-and-death rate by two
approaches: the stochastic birth-and-death process, which
uses information of the number of genes in extant species and
assumes equal rates of gene gain and loss [37,38]; and comparative genome analysis of the inferred number of gene gain
and loss on each phylogeny branch and those inferred at the
internal nodes (see Materials and methods, below). We estimated the birth-and-death rates as β = 0.002 to 0.004 and δ
= 0.002 to 0.003 per gene and million years. These estimates

are slightly lower than those obtained using the method proposed by Hahn and coworkers [37] (λ = 0.005 to 0.008);, the
latter method, however, assumes equal gain and loss rates.
Present OBP estimates are higher than the average value for
the whole Drosophila genome (λ = 0.0013 [55]) although
similar (or lower) to the estimates obtained for the two other
major olfactory multigene families of Drosophila, namely the
Ors (λ = 0.006 to 0.009) and the Grs (λ = 0.011 to 0.015).
(These estimates were derived using the numbers of genes
identified by McBride and Arguello [56] and those identified
by Gardner and Ritchie [personal communication].) OBP
birth rates are quite similar to previous estimates for the complete set of gene families in Drosophila (β = 0.001 to 0.002
[57,58]). However, these estimates are not completely comparable because the methodological approach used by Lynch
and Conery [57,58] is quite different from our approach in
that they made use of single-genome information. We also
show that high-density tandem OBP gene regions are more
likely to generate new duplicates. Therefore, a given gene
family might present different birth (or birth-and-death)
rates across the genome. As more genome information
becomes available, it will be possible to determine whether
the birth-and-death rates differ in gene families with different
function, chromosomal locations, dissimilar gene sizes, or in
different group of species, and whether they correlate with

gene-specific functional importance [59]. These studies will
undoubtedly provide valuable insight into the molecular evolution and biologic importance of multigene families.

temporally coordinated expression. For instance, in D. melanogaster some OBP genes are co-expressed either in the same
developmental stage or in the same local region of the chemosensory organs [31,70]. Although we did not detect clear evidence that genes on the same cluster are expressed at
particular developmental stages, the incomplete gene expression data precludes us from drawing any firm conclusion. To
shed light on this issue, it is essential to determine how the
expression patterns correlates with genomic gene organization in these olfactory system gene families.

The present study also provides significant clues as to the origin and fate of duplicate genes. We show that the majority of
gene gains occur in extant chromosomal clusters, suggesting
that gene duplications are mostly produced in tandem by
unequal crossing over. Furthermore, the highly significant
relationship between chromosomal clusters and phylogenetic
groups would indicate that OBP members evolve gradually
from their origin in existing clusters. It is known that transposable element-rich regions could generate these 'gene factories' by increasing the levels of unequal crossing over [6062]. Although we did detect a number of repetitive elements
neighboring most of the genome clusters, no confident conclusion could be drawn. Further analysis of the relative distribution of these repetitive elements will provide more
information about the origin of OBP gene duplicates and
genome clusters.
We found that OBP genes exhibit high functional constraints,
with an average ω value of 0.153, and confirmed that the
results obtained in two individual members are a general feature of the family [63,64]. In spite of the fact that the selective
constraint levels are not clearly associated with phylogenetic
groups, they differ both among individual genes and across
chromosome clusters. This feature supports the contention
that, concurrent with the sequence divergence, duplicates
copies would also diverge functionally. Although OBP members would essentially maintain the same global function,
they would probably acquire subtle functional differences (a
micro-functionalization [62]), perhaps in their gene expression levels or in their ligand-binding specificity or affinity
properties. In addition, Andronopoulou and coworkers [65]
have demonstrated that some Anopheles OBPs might form
homodimers and specific heterodimers, suggesting a high
combinatorial complexity that will allow for new binding or
kinetic properties (also see Sánchez-Gracia and coworkers
[63]). Hence, small differences in the number and pattern of
protein-protein OBP interactions might have an appreciable
functional meaning and might underlie the observed functional constraint differences [66,67]. In this context, it is suggestive that dimmer OBPs, which might have been originated
from a gene duplication event followed by in-frame fusion,
produce a single-chain multidomain protein that retains
structural features of the original dimeric unit.
The present estimates of the protein evolutionary rates at the
OBP genes are in contrast to the strong conservation pattern
of genome clusters across the genus. However, this feature
does not occur in the Or and Gr gene families, which have a
comparable number of genes [56,68,69] (Gardner and
Ritchie, personal communication), suggesting the action of
some mechanism that actively prevents their break. Indeed,
genes belonging to the same cluster might exhibit a spatio-

Vieira et al. R235.11

The evolutionary analysis of the complete set of genes in a
family involved in the response to environmental chemicals is
also very attractive because they may be able to provide
insights into the selective pressures that result from changes
in the species 'lifestyle' during and after speciation. Here we
find that OBP genes in specialist lineages (those that recently
underwent a host speciation episode) evolve at significantly
higher ω rates than do generalists. Consequently, either purifying selection is more relaxed in several OBP genes, probably
caused by loss (or partial loss) of function during the specialization process, or positive selection acted throughout this
process. McBride and Arguello [56] also found a significant
increase in the evolutionary rate at the Ors and Grs in the D.
sechellia and D. erecta lineages; this study detected a
genome-wide increase in the amino acid fixation rate in this
species, although it was lower than that observed at the receptor repertory. Because the genome-wide higher ω values
detected in the specialist species could reflect some demographic changes, we have also conducted in the OBP family
the same analysis as McBride and Arguello [56] did, using the
same genome-wide set of genes. We also found that the OBP
repertory in specialist species has evolved under lower functional constraints (higher ω values) than the genome-wide
trend (the median difference between specialists and generalists ω for the OBP family [0.0556] is significantly greater than
that for genes across the genome [0.0087]; P = 0.0031). This
feature, jointly with the birth-and-death evolution pattern
similarity, suggests that these two olfactory system multigene
families might have co-evolved in response to ecologic
changes across the Drosophila genus. Therefore, it would be
very interesting to establish the precise contribution of the
OBP gene family to this specialization process, and to identify
the specific members involved in this phenomenon. This
knowledge will provide fundamental insight into the roles
played by the various selective forces in shaping patterns
nucleotide variation associated with host-switching or ecologic specialization processes.

Conclusion

The Drosophila OBP multigene family has evolved under
purifying selection and accommodates remarkably well to the
birth-and-death model, with tandem gene duplication being
the major mechanism for generation of new members. However, OBP genes exhibit different functional constraints,

which are indicative of some functional diversification. The
organization of OBP genes in genomic clusters is conserved
across the 12 species; therefore, the formation of the OBP
cluster architecture should have been originated before the
split between Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera. This
feature suggests the existence of co-regulated gene clusters
for most OBPs in these genomes. Finally, we have showed
that this olfactory system protein family has evolved more
rapidly in specialist species of the melanogaster group of
Drosophila, and thus it might be involved in processes of ecologic diversification.

incorrectly annotated sequence. The new OBP annotations
will be available from FlyBase.

Materials and methods
Identification of the odorant-binding protein genes in
Drosophila
The sequence of the OBP genes of Drosophila melanogaster
(release 4.3 [71]), D. pseudoobscura (release 2.0 [72]),
Anopheles gambiae (release 2.29 [73]), and Apis mellifera
(release 4.0 [74]) were downloaded from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [75] and Flybase [76]. The
protein sequences of the OBP genes of Tribolium castaneum
were obtained from Foret and Maleszka [7]. Genomic information, including the orthologous relationships, of the ten
new Drosophila spp. plus the two previously sequenced
(comparative analysis freeze 1 stage) was downloaded from
the Assembly, Alignment and Annotation Wiki [77-79].
To identify putative non-annotated OBP members, we first
conducted a TBLASTN search against the genome sequence
of the 12 Drosophila spp. (threshold E-value of 10-5). For the
analysis we used as query the amino acid sequence of all
known OBP members from all species (including A. gambiae
and A. mellifera). Putative missing genes were confirmed by
the colinearity analysis of single-copy conserved genes. First,
we conducted a dot-plot analysis using the zPicture program
[80] between the genomic region surrounding the putative
missing gene (about 10 to 80 kilobases in length) and the
orthologous syntenic region of the phylogenetically closest
Drosophila spp. Next, we searched by MegaBLAST (threshold E-value of 10) the trace archives (the raw genome
sequence data) using as the query the nucleotide information
surrounding the putative absent OBP member. This exhaustive gene-by-gene analysis allowed us to determine accurately
the number of gene gains and losses in each branch of the
phylogeny. To determine whether some already annotated
gene model was in fact a non-annotated (or wrongly annotated) OBP member, we conducted a PSI-BLAST search
(threshold E-value of 10-3) against the annotated proteins of
D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura using as the initial
query OBP representatives of the different subfamilies. However, this analysis failed to detect any new OBP. Moreover, we
also studied the gene structure (the presence of start and stop
codons and the signal peptide region) and the substitution
pattern (nonsense or frameshift mutations), in order to verify
whether the identified OBP gene was a pseudogene or an

Odorant-binding protein gene nomenclature
The current nomenclature for the OBP gene names of D. melanogaster [31] is based on their cytological map position. For
clarity and to gain insight into the orthologous relationships
among OBP members, we propose for this gene family the
nomenclature scheme used for the Or and Gr multigene families [56,68] (Gardner and Ritchie, personal communication).
The first four letters indicate the Drosophila species (for
instance, Dsim would indicate the D. simulans species) and
the next letters the OBP gene name in D. melanogaster (for
example, DyakObp83a is orthologous to DmelObp83a,
which was named obp83a by Hekmat-Scafe and coworkers
[31]). For unparalogous copies (gene duplications in non-D.
melanogaster lineages) we add a hyphen and a number; for
example, DyakObp93a-1 and DyakObp93a-2 are coorthologs of DmelObp93a (both are orthologs of
DmelObp93a). We use the letter 'L' (meaning 'like') to name
genes that are closely related to D. melanogaster even though
they are absent in this species (new genes); for example,
DvirObp57cL1 indicates a new gene identified in D. virilis
(absent in D. melanogaster) that arose from a duplication of
an ancestor of Obp57c. Putative pseudogenes are named following the same schema adding the suffix 'P' (for 'pseudogene'); for instance, DanaObp59aP indicates that in D.
ananassae Obp59a gene is a pseudogene.

Birth-and-death rates
We estimated the global birth-and-death rate of the OBP gene
family by applying two methods and using the divergence
times from Tamura and Subramanian [39] and Russo and
coworkers [40]. The method proposed by Hahn and colleagues [37] (implemented in the software CAFÉ [38]), which
assumes an equal probability of birth (duplication) and death
(deletion or pseudogenization), uses information regarding
the number of genes in extant species. The birth and death
rate (λ; per gene per million years) is estimated by maximum
likelihood. We also estimated separately the birth (β) and
death (δ) rates (per gene per million years) using both current
estimates of the number of gene gains and losses in each
branch of the phylogeny and the number of gene copies at the
internal nodes. These rates were estimated as follows:

mous positions in more divergent comparisons might be saturated, producing unreliable estimates of the ω parameter.
This analysis was conducted using the codeml program from
the PAML software package version 3.15 [90]. Because the
phylogenetic relationship of D. erecta and D. yakuba with
respect to D. melanogaster is controversial [91], we applied
the three most supported tree topologies for these species;
topology 1 assumes that D. yakuba and D. erecta are sister
species, and topologies 2 and 3 regard D. yakuba and D.
erecta, respectively, to be sister taxa relative to D. melanogaster. We report the results of only the best supported
tree topology; in the few cases with discrepancies between
models, we used the topology of the best supported tree under
model M0 (one ω ratio for all lineages and all sites). Nevertheless, and so that our findings could be compared with those
reported by McBride and Arguello [56], in the analysis comparing generalists and specialist species we reported the
results based on topology 1.

Multiple sequence alignments
We constructed multiple sequence alignments of both amino
acid and nucleotide coding regions. Given the high substitution rate found at the signal peptide portion of the OBPs, the
multiple sequence alignments of these regions might be, in
most cases, unreliable. We therefore used the PrediSi program [81] to identify the signal peptide sequences; all of these
regions were removed before conducting the final alignment.
Paralogous OBP proteins were aligned by using the SPEM
program [82], which uses predicted secondary structure
information to conduct the alignment. To generate the multiple sequence alignments of the orthologous coding regions we
first aligned the amino acid sequences using PROBCONS
[83], and then we used this alignment to guide the nucleotide
coding region alignment. We generated a multiple sequence
alignments for each OBP gene member; for those genes with
multiple annotated isoforms we used information of only the
isoform shared across all 12 Drosophila spp.

Evolutionary analysis
The MEGA 3.1 software [84] was used to estimate amino acid
divergences under the JTT empirical amino acid substitution
model [85] and applying the pair-wise deletion option. The
MrBayes version 3.1.2 software [86] was used to infer the
Bayesian phylogenetic tree under the Whelan-Goldman
model of amino acid evolution [87] (this model was visited
>99% of times by Markov chain Monte Carlo). The model was
run with four chains for 5.5 million generations sampling
from the posterior density every 1,000 generations. The temperature parameter was finally set at 0.025, because it led to
a more efficient chain heating scheme. We discarded 20% of
the sampled steps as burn-in. This phylogenetic tree was similar than that obtained under the neighbor-joining algorithm
[88] (results not shown). We applied the approach described
by Sawyer [89] to detect putative gene conversion events
among paralogous amino acid sequences of a given species.
The analysis was conducted using all OBP members and also
separately for each phylogenetic subfamily.
We used the ratio ω = dN/dS (where dN and dS are the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates, respectively) to
analyze the selective pressures acting on OBP genes. Under
strict neutrality, synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations
will be fixed at identical rates, with the expected ratio (ω)
being equal to 1. Purified selection against deleterious nonsynonymous mutations will cause the fixation of synonymous
mutations at a faster rate (assuming that synonymous mutations are strictly neutral) than nonsynonymous mutations,
and therefore ω will be less than 1. In contrast, only advantageous nonsynonymous mutations could be fixed in the population at a faster rate than synonymous mutations, and thus ω
might be greater than 1. We restricted this analysis to the six
Drosophila melanogaster group species because the synony-

We applied 'branch models' M0spec (with three different ω
classes: one for specialist lineages, one for generalist lineages,
and an additional ω class for the D. ananassae) and FR (free
ratios; the ω parameter is estimated independently in each
branch). We also applied 'site models', which allow for heterogeneous selective pressures across amino acid sites [92-94]:
the neutral model (M1 model; assumes two site classes, with
ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1); the positive selection model (M2; which
adds to the M1 model an additional site class with ω2 > 1); the
discrete model (M3; which uses an unconstrained discrete
distribution of K classes to model heterogeneous ω ratios
across sites; here we used this model with K = 2 and K = 3);
and the β distribution based models, M7 (which assumes a β
distribution for ω among sites) and M8 (which adds to the M7
model one extra class of sites, with ω1 > 1). In addition, we
applied the method described by Yang and Swanson [95] to
assess whether global ω values (averaged across sites) differ
among OBP genes. We run all PAML models with three different initial ω values to avoid local optima. To test a number of
hypotheses dealing with the selective pressures governing the
evolution of these genes, we contrasted pairs of nested models
using a likelihood ratio test [96]. These analyses were conducted for each gene separately and by concatenating single
OBP genes from certain groups (for example, all genes,
genomic clusters, and phylogenetic clades). To control the
false discovery rate for multiple tests, we applied the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg [97] at the level of q = 0.05.
We tested the distribution of ω values among groups (phylogenetic subfamilies or genomic clusters) using the SSB term
of the ANOVA as statistic; the P value was obtained by the
Monte-Carlo permutation test. For the association analysis of
the ω values and gene expression, and because OBP gene
expression data are incomplete, we conducted the analysis on
only two groups [31,70]: those genes expressed exclusively in
adult and those expressed in both larvae and adult.
