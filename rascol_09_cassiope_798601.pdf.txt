Abstract
Background: Understanding genome evolution provides insight into biological mechanisms. For
many years comparative genomics and analysis of conserved chromosomal regions have helped to
unravel the mechanisms involved in genome evolution and their implications for the study of
biological systems. Detection of conserved regions (descending from a common ancestor) not only
helps clarify genome evolution but also makes it possible to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
and investigate gene function.
The identification and comparison of conserved regions on a genome scale is computationally
intensive, making process automation essential. Three key requirements are necessary:
consideration of phylogeny to identify orthologs between multiple species, frequent updating of the
annotation and panel of compared genomes and computation of statistical tests to assess the
significance of identified conserved gene clusters.
Results: We developed a modular system superimposed on a multi-agent framework, called
CASSIOPE (Clever Agent System for Synteny Inheritance and Other Phenomena in Evolution).
CASSIOPE automatically identifies statistically significant conserved regions between multiple
genomes based on automated phylogenies and statistical testing. Conserved regions were searched
for in 19 species and 1,561 hits were found. To our knowledge, CASSIOPE is the first system to
date that integrates evolutionary biology-based concepts and fulfills all three key requirements
stated
above.

region and to infer conserved gene clusters based on phylogenies and statistical tests assessing the
significance of these conserved regions.

Background
Comparative genomics and the reconstruction of ancestral genomes provide landmarks better understand the
biological rules governing evolution. The most obvious
way to make progress in ancestral genome reconstruction
is to compare the organizational structure of conserved
genomic regions in a large number of informative species
[1]. Hypotheses can then be formulated to account for
such conserved genomic regions:
• Observed conserved regions are due to chance and
are not biologically significant.
• Conserved regions result from a common ancestral
region through inheritance.
• Conserved regions are due to evolutionary convergence with possible selective pressure.
CASSIOPE is able to reject the null hypothesis (conserved
regions due to chance) in favor of one of the two alternatives, but cannot distinguish between them (ancestral
regions or convergence). In literature reports, conserved
regions are frequently defined through BLAST [2] or alignment by similarity search to determine putative "orthologous" genes [3,4]. Furthermore, the significance of the
observed conserved gene clustering has to be statistically
tested to reduce the risk of false positives. Several tools
and databases (Phig's [5]), Ensembl [6]) provide information on conserved regions across different species but even
when they do use phylogenetic methods, there is no statistical processing assessing the significance of the conserved regions.
In contrast, a few methods seek conserved regions using
statistics [7,8] but do not offer a phylogeny-based distinction between orthologs and paralogs. Thus, in [8],
GRIMM-synteny computes conserved regions based on
gene markers ("orthologous" sequences or "orthologous"
alignments that users have to input) and a distance
threshold.
There are two requirements for identifying biologically
significant conserved regions:
• Identification of conserved markers (orthologs or
paralogs between different species)
• Identification of significantly conserved clusters of
these markers
Currently, there is no software available that detects conserved regions by providing a phylogenetic determination
of conserved markers together with and a score for their
significance. Furthermore, those resources that are availa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/284

ble pre-compute conserved regions on a limited number
of species, eliminating the possibility or running searches
using custom-input regions.
In short, biologists today find themselves needing one set
of tools to identify orthologous or paralogous markers
and then another set of tools to evaluate the significance
of observed conserved regions. The lack of software able
to provide automated output of statistically-estimated
information on conserved regions at several-genome scale
together with the growing amount of genomic data being
filed prompted us to automate comparative analysis
based on conserved genes clusters, through the CASSIOPE
project.
The CASSIOPE project proposes new methodology using
evolutionary biology-based concepts. First, orthologs and
paralogs are detected via phylogenetic analysis. Several
approaches not based on phylogenetic analysis claim to
find orthology. However, the clustering requires a complete genome and, in the case of lineage-specific differential paralog loss, provides spurious data that contradict
the identification of orthologs and paralogs based on phylogeny. Secondly, chromosomal regions from different
species that are inherited from a common ancestor have a
higher probability of containing homologs than under
neutrality. This probability has to be rigorously calculated
to give a score on the evolutionary history of the species
compared. These evolutionary concepts have been
embedded in CASSIOPE.
CASSIOPE deploys the following core technologies:
• Data-processing system: the computer system is a
modular system with several agents (virtual machines
that work on specific tasks) deployed in conjunction
with an expert system that communicates with every
agent and takes rule-based decisions to answer initial
biological questions. The rulesets of the expert system
can be updated, removed or added, just as a human
scientist would.
• Data flexibility: searches can be run for newlysequenced regions or genomes. The comparative data
is initially pooled and computed, and then recomputed when saved data is older than one month.
• Detection of orthologous genes by robust phylogenetic reconstruction.
• Statistical score to assess significance of conserved
regions.
• Reverse-search feature making it possible to extend
the initial searches.

The stability and reliability of CASSIOPE were determined
using several tests on large genomic regions (containing
several hundred genes).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/284

(2) Once phylogenetic reconstruction of all genes
from this region Ra has allowed the determination of
orthologous genes, we classify them as a function of
i. species

Methods
As previously stated, the search for biologically-relevant
conserved genomic regions requires phylogenetic orthology assessment, statistical testing, and as many available
genomes as possible. The breakthrough offered by CASSIOPE is that it integrates all three of these key steps in a single automated process:
• Phylogeny: orthologous/paralogous genes are determined by phylogenetic methods (using Figenix, [9]).
Phylogenetic information also allows reconstruction
of the evolutionary history, and therefore more accurate ancestral genome reconstruction.
• Statistical test: we apply a statistical test for each conserved region to assess the significance of the observed
conserved gene clusters [for a detailed description see
[10]], taking multigenic families and paralogs into
account.
• Reverse search: when conserved regions between a
region A1 of species A and a region B1 of species B are
found, the reverse conserved regions are subsequently
checked, i.e. after finding conserved regions from A1
to B1, a reverse search is performed from B1 in order
to screen for the conserved region in species A. This
step will either find part of the same region A1 or
expand this region or a different new region (whether
or not it is on the same chromosome). This reciprocal
process thereby finds multi-directional conserved
regions from all species to all species (all-against-all),
enables to confirm conserved regions, boundary these
regions, and highlight translocations, duplications
and other evolutionary phenomena at chromosome
level.
Orthologous conserved regions
Here we describe the algorithm used in CASSIOPE with,
as starting material, specific genomic region Ra in species
A located on chromosome Ca:

(1) For each gene from Ra, we search for orthologous
genes in multiple species using phylogenetic methods.
If {Ga1,..., Gan} are genes of Ra, then for each Gai 1 <i <n,
we obtain:
{Os1,..., Osp} a list of orthologous genes of gene i in several species sj 1 <j <p

ii. chromosome
iii. number of orthologs on this chromosome ≥ 3.
Thus, several clusters in different species can be obtained.
(3) We complete all clusters by including the nonorthologous genes found inside clusters delimited in
step (2).
(4) We assess statistical support for conserved regions
between start region and each new region found in
previous steps using a "binomial test" [10]
k
∀k ∈ Ω, P( X = k) = C n p k q n − k
k

α = 1−

∑ p( X = k )
0

We test the null hypothesis H0 and the alternative hypothesis H1:
H0: Conserved genes clustering between start region and
identified end region results from a random process.
H1: Conserved genes clustering between start region and
orthologous end region does not result from a random
process.
p: probability of observing a number k of orthologous
genes (randomly pulled out of n genes) all mapped to the
same region. Therefore, p is the probability that each gene
contained in the start region will have one (or several)
orthologs in the end region.
q: probability that orthologs are localized elsewhere in the
target genome (q = 1-p).
If Ra is start region and Rb a putative "target" conserved
region found in species B,
then:
p = number of genes in Rb/genes in genome B.
n = number of genes in species A which have at least one
orthologous gene in species B (found by phylogeny)

Page 3 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:284

k = number of genes in Rb that are orthologous to genes
in Ra.
If a given gene from Ra has multiple orthologous genes in
species B (due to duplication after speciation of A and B),
the probability of finding an orthologous gene in Rb is
higher than for one-to-one orthologous genes. Consequently, in the case of multiple orthologs, k is corrected as
follows:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/284

k

α = 1−

∑ p( X = k )
0

Where: p = number of genes in Rb/genes in B genome
n = number of genes in species A that are at least one paralog in species B (found by phylogeny)
k = number of paralogous genes in Rb

If gi, 1 <i <n is a gene in Ra

Results and Discussion
And if li = number of orthologous genes (found from gi)
in the species B genome
And if mi = number of othologous genes (found from gi)
that fall in region Rb
Then

⎢
k=⎢
⎢
⎣

∑

mi ⎥
⎥
li ⎥
⎦

(5) Reverse search: we restart the algorithm with all
the newly found regions as starting regions using the
following logical rules: unless the new region is
included in or overlaps a region that has been already
studied, we restart with this new region.
The algorithm stops when all the conserved sites have
been calculated.
Paralogous conserved regions
CASSIOPE is also able to identify paralogous conserved
regions (conserved genes clusters in the same genome)
exactly in the same manner as it finds orthologous conserved regions.

Working with a fixed time-window on duplication events
and with phylogenetic trees, paralogous genes are
detected by finding matching duplication nodes, i.e.
nodes that correspond to the defined time-window. For
instance, the search for paralogous genes that appear after
duplication of vertebrate nodes eliminates duplication
nodes that contain species other than vertebrates.
Paralogous genes are then clustered and "non-matching"
clusters (less than three genes) are removed.
For each cluster, conserved regions are computed. The statistical test is the same as for orthologous regions.

System
Expansion of the panel of genomes available for comparison will allow us to construct higher resolution models of
genome evolution. However, the vast amounts of data
involved make it impossible to manually identify all conserved regions among a large number of species. Another
key requirement is regular updates on conserved region
data, as genome assembly and annotation can be refined
over time as new genomes are released. CASSIOPE is a
modular system superimposed on a multi-agent framework. The expert system controls three slaves. This is a
centralized system where one of the "agents" has a global
view of the process and drives the non-intelligent slaves
(Figure 1). Each virtual machine has a specific task and all
the machines work together to address user queries. The
process developed in CASSIOPE (Figure 2) involves several tasks, such as phylogenetic reconstruction or consulting web databases, and each task is independent from the
others. The expert system contains a full ruleset allowing
decision-taking on information received. The whole process is contained in the expert system and uses other agents
to obtain the information required.
a) Agents
Expert System
This is the core of CASSIOPE. The Expert System communicates with different agents to answer the following question: which genomic regions are significantly conserved?
It receives queries and tries to find the required information in database. If information is incomplete, unavailable or outdated (> 1 month), the system deduces the
questions it has to ask to the other agents.

One example rule, taken from reverse search mode, concerns when to restart with new region R.
If the question for R has already been solved:
R is included in another solved region
or R overlaps another solved region

k
∀k ∈ Ω, P( X = k) = C n p k q n − k

then the Expert System does not restart with R

else it restarts with R.
Each time it registers conserved regions, an e-mail is sent
to the user indicating the species-pairs involved and the
associated significance score.
At the same time, the expert system creates reports for each
cluster found, indicating the different steps performed
and the elements used for deductions.
Tree Agent
CASSIOPE uses the FIGENIX computer platform [9] to
assess phylogenetic relationships (orthology/paralogy).
FIGENIX allows phylogenetic trees to be built via specific
pipelines. In CASSIOPE, the CassiopePhyloM pipeline is
used to reconstruct the desired trees. From the query
sequence, a dataset of putative homologous sequences is
first constructed using BLASTp using protein sequences
from ENSEMBL. CASSIOPE filters the raw dataset to eliminate potentially non-homologous sequences (E-value
threshold: 10-4), disturbing alignments, and duplicates.

The next step uses CLUSTALW to produce an alignment
that is then modified to eliminate large gaps. Since phylogenetic analysis is achieved at domain level, we next detect
these domains with HMMPFAM. For each domain alignment (extracted from the original alignment), a bias correction phase is run to eliminate: i) non-monophyletic
"repeats", ii) sequences with divergent composition,
which is done using the amino-acid composition test in
TREE-PUZZLE software (with an alpha risk set to 5%),
and iii) sites not under neutral evolution SHIFT-FINDER.
Indeed phylogenetic reconstruction methods are not tolerant to sites highly divergent to neutral evolution and
molecular clock. Sites not respecting this rule potentially
produce errors in trees' reconstruction and thus have to be
masked. Once the domains have been "purified", and
after congruent domain selection using the HOMPART
test in the PAUP package, a new alignment is built by
merging preserved parts of the domains' alignments. This
new alignment is then used to generate three phylogenetic
trees using NJ, ML (with TREE-PUZZLE) and MP (with
PAUP package) methods. By comparing the topologies of

these trees with the PSCORE command ("Templeton winning sites" test) from the PAUP package and the
KISHINO-HASEGAWA test from the TREE-PUZZLE package, these trees are fusioned to produce a unique consensus tree. This consensus protein tree can then be
compared with a reference species tree (the tree of life
from NCBI) to deduce proteins orthologous to the query
sequence [see Additional file 1].
FIGENIX is accessible online http://figenix2.up.univmrs.fr/Figenix/index.jsp; however, the Tree Agent runs
tasks directly by querying FIGENIX without interface.
Database Agent
All features are registered in a local database (managed
with postgresql http://www.postgresql.org). Each time the
Expert System searches for information, it asks the Database Agent whether this information already exists and
whether it is out of date, i.e. > 30 days old.

For instance, when phylogenic trees are screened for a
given gene G, the database agent checks whether G is
already included in orthologs list of another gene, taking
the FIGENIX task identifier and asking FIGENIX to send
the corresponding gene tree (this avoids re-computing
existing trees). This database can also be consulted using
a "telescope viewer" interface (see section 3.2) that allows
user-friendly visualization of results.
Web Agent
We have developed an agent that searches for information
on remote sources on the Web. As a source of genomic
and proteomic sequence data, we chose the Ensembl [6]
database as it is a non-redundant and frequently updated
database allowing retrieval of gene locations on different
chromosomes at the base pair (bp) level, and that can be
accessed via an API from a JAVA library (ENSJ).
b) Telescope viewer
CASSIOPE enables users to view all the conserved sites
registered in the database. Whenever CASSIOPE receives
new conserved region queries, the results are saved and
made visible using the telescope viewer.

This viewer has three levels:
• Chromosome level: for a given species, a chromosome can be chosen showing regions that are conserved in other species and their identifiers.
• Region level: by clicking on "chromosome region" in
the last level, a region on the chromosome appears in
front of boxes. Each box represents conserved regions
on each chromosome of each species. It allows a glo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/284

bal view of species sharing the conserved regions and
of their distribution in each species.
• Gene level: by clicking on a box in other species, conserved sites appear between two regions with all the
genes of the two regions together with homologous
between-gene links, making it possible to explore gene
distribution in both regions. Ensembl link and FIGENIX task identifier are available for each gene.
c) CASSIOPE Parameters
CASSIOPE allows users to modify several of the parameters used at different steps in order to fine-tune the software:
CASSIOPE. global parameters
• Completed: Boolean parameter -Either the region is
defined by both extreme genes (Web Agent completes
it) or the region is defined by user, who give his own
boundary genes region

• Scope: this parameter is used to focus on a species
subset (using TAX ID)
• "SourceURI": to select the databases to be used by
the Web Agent (at the present time, the software can
only use Ensembl as a data source, but adaption to
other databases is possible)
• Ortholog or paralog region search: to determine type
of conserved sites researched by the user
• Reverse search: to restart the process
• Range: to choose time-windows for duplication
• Distance between two genes: the orthologous clusters found are sometimes large with long non-orthologous genes gaps but can still be significantly
conserved. To specify conserved region, it is possible
to split the orthologous cluster if the distance between
two orthologous genes is >x bps.
Phylogeny parameters
FIGENIX is Web-interfaced with configurable phylogeny
parameters. Therefore, working through the CASSIOPE
interface, users can configure FIGENIX at the same time,
with:

• Pipeline model: FIGENIX contains several pipelines
for phylogenetic reconstruction, any of which can be
selected
by
the
user.
(We
recommend
using__CassiopePhyloM__ as it is the most up-to-date
and appropriate pipeline for reliably finding orthologs
and paralogs).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/284

• Scope: to focus on a species subset or eliminate certain species from the phylogenetic analysis (which
could be different from the CASSIOPE scope).

Computing features
The parameters used in this case-study are reported in
Table 1.

• "NoDuplicationRange": allows sequences that
belong to a given taxonomic group to be considered as
orthologs. For instance, in phylogenies using individual genes, human and dog sometimes appear more
closely related than human and mouse, and sometimes human and mouse are closer than human and
dog; to prevent a duplication node between these
three species being systematically deduced, we use the
NoDuplicationRange parameter by indicating [9615,
10090], which are the NCBI Taxonomic Identifiers
(TaxIDs) for dog and mouse, respectively.

CASSIOPE was run on a bi-processor machine with 2 Gb
of RAM. All the agents ran on the same computer. However, as this software is based upon modular architecture,
agents could be distributed over several computers.

• Database: database used for the initial homology
search (Ensembl)
• Tree of life: FIGENIX needs a reference tree of life to
infer duplication and speciation nodes on tree fusions.
By default, the NCBI tree of life is used, but users can
set their own species tree.

Case Study
In this section, we describe an example analysis using
CASSIOPE on a test-region that was previously known to
have conserved regions in vertebrate species.
Biological data
The example region chosen contains 283 genes and is
localized to chromosome 9 of the human genome from
base pair 129,045,207 (ENSG00000136895: Ensembl
gene
identifier)
to
base
pair
140,191,570
(ENSG00000159247). This region is an MHC-like paralogous regions [11,12]. It provides an interesting test-case as
it is known to be conserved through vertebrate evolution.

Conserved regions were searched for in all of the 19 following species:
Mammals: Homo sapiens, Monodelphis domestica, Bos taurus,
Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris,
Equus caballus, Pongo abelii, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta

Output (results)
CASSIOPE ran for 11 days and found 1,561 conserved
sites in all 19 species using reverse-search parameters.
CASSIOPE launched the computation of 3,736 phylogenies via FIGENIX. Most of the execution time was spent
computing phylogenetic trees, which is well-known as a
time-intensive step. In order to considerably accelerate the
process, CASSIOPE could also run a fast computation by
using only NJ method. From the MHC-like paralogous
region on human chromosome 9 (the start region of the
process), 37 conserved regions were found (Figure 3).
CASSIOPE then automatically computed conserved
regions in all 19 species [see Additional file 1, figure s6],
leading to a total of 1,561 hits. Comparing the results
obtained from Ensembl data with the results obtained
from the CASSIOPE process, CASSIOPE found the same
regions and/or more regions for some species, as well as
new conserved regions with species that were not computed in Ensembl databases. Detailed results are given in
figure 3. The Ensembl results are available at: http://
www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/
cytoview?l=9:129045207-140191570;h=,

regions link.

• For instance CASSIOPE and Ensembl found the
same regions for Bos taurus, Canis lupus familiaris,
Equus caballus, Monodelphis domestica, Mus musculus,
Rattus norvegicus Pan troglodytes, Pongo abelii and Gallus
gallus.
• In the case of Macaca mulatta CASSIOPE found one
supplementary region compared to Ensembl.
• For the others species, only CASSIOPE identified
conserved regions. It seems clear that the conserved
regions in Ensembl are not yet fully computed.

Birds: Gallus gallus
Teleost fish: Takifugu rubripes, Danio rerio, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oryzias latipes
Insects: Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae
Nematodes:Caenorhabditis elegans
Yeast: Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Furthermore, CASSIOPE also statistically assessed the significance of conserved regions, providing scores.
We clearly identified a teleost-specific duplication, as was
previously proposed [13]: corresponding to one region on
one chromosome, we obtained several conserved regions
on two chromosomes. For one chromosome in vertebrate
genomes, there are two chromosomes in teleost genomes.
Using the "telescope viewer", exploration of all regions

Conclusion

2.

CASSIOPE is a reliable and flexible tool that provides
access to up-to-date information based on the comparison of multiple genomes. It allows the study of conserved
regions starting from a specific query genetic region. Inference of conserved gene clusters is based on phylogenetic
reconstruction, which adds an historical dimension, and
on statistical assessment of the significance of the inference. Finally, the built-in telescope viewer makes it easy
for users to explore the results, and promptly gives an idea
on the conserved regions and gene organization of each
pair of species compared. CASSIOPE could be extended to
other applications. In the test case reported here, CASSIOPE was only used for a global view of identified conserved regions. The CASSIOPE project is expected to give
insights on genome structure and evolution and to be usefully applied in biomedical and agricultural fields (e.g.,
identification of QTLs or disease-gene identification). For
instance, pairing information regarding the conservation
of genomic regions with functional information regarding
diseases could point to candidates for genes involved in
pathologies.
