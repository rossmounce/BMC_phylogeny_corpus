Abstract
Background: The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest
within most mammals. GPCRs are important targets for pharmaceuticals and the rat is one of the
most widely used model organisms in biological research. Accurate comparisons of protein families
in rat, mice and human are thus important for interpretation of many physiological and
pharmacological studies. However, current automated protein predictions and annotations are
limited and error prone.
Results: We searched the rat genome for GPCRs and obtained 1867 full-length genes and 739
pseudogenes. We identified 1277 new full-length rat GPCRs, whereof 1235 belong to the large
group of olfactory receptors. Moreover, we updated the datasets of GPCRs from the human and
mouse genomes with 1 and 43 new genes, respectively. The total numbers of full-length genes (and
pseudogenes) identified were 799 (583) for human and 1783 (702) for mouse. The rat, human and
mouse GPCRs were classified into 7 families named the Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled,
Secretin, Taste2 and Vomeronasal1 families. We performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of
these families and provide detailed information about orthologues and species-specific receptors.
We found that 65 human Rhodopsin family GPCRs are orphans and 56 of these have an orthologue
in rat.
Conclusion: Interestingly, we found that the proportion of one-to-one GPCR orthologues was
only 58% between rats and humans and only 70% between the rat and mouse, which is much lower
than stated for the entire set of all genes. This is in mainly related to the sensory GPCRs. The
average protein sequence identities of the GPCR orthologue pairs is also lower than for the whole
genomes. We found these to be 80% for the rat and human pairs and 90% for the rat and mouse
pairs. However, the proportions of orthologous and species-specific genes vary significantly
between the different GPCR families. The largest diversification is seen for GPCRs that respond to
exogenous stimuli indicating that the variation in their repertoires reflects to a large extent the
adaptation of the species to their environment. This report provides the first overall roadmap of
the GPCR repertoire in rat and detailed comparisons with the mouse and human repertoires.

Background
The rat genome [1] was the third mammalian genome to
be sequenced, after the human [2,3] and mouse [4]
genomes. The rat is one of the most widely used model
organisms in biological research. Despite this fact, the
annotated proteins are fewer for rat (26,123) compared to
mouse (30,397) and human (41,973) (Ensembl "peptides known" and "peptides known-ccds" datasets March
2007) [5]. Automated protein predictions offer fast annotation but they are error-prone and need to be followed up
by careful manual curation. For instance the Genscan gene
prediction program has a sensitivity and specificity of
about 90% for detecting exons, leading to frequent errors
in multi-exon genes [6]. Our recent annotation of the
chicken G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed
that over 60% of the chicken Genscan gene predictions
with a human orthologue needed curation. The curation
drastically increased the quality of the dataset as the average percentage identity between the human-chicken oneto-one orthologous pairs was raised from 56% to 73% [7].
Moreover, automated annotation based on inter-species
comparisons has difficulties in identifying species-specific
proteins, a problem that is relevant especially to large protein families that display large differences between species. For example previous reports of the V1R and V2R
vomeronasal receptor repertoires display a very large variation in numbers [8-11]. The degrees of completeness and
accuracy of protein annotations have, of course, a substantial impact on subsequent analyses such as phylogenetic analyses and calculations of evolutionary distances.
Accurate comparisons of the rat and human proteins, such
as correct assignment of orthologous pairs, are crucial for
the design and interpretation of physiological and pharmacological studies in which results are inferred between
the species.
The superfamily of GPCRs is one of the largest groups of
proteins within most mammals. GPCRs are signal mediators that have a prominent role in most major physiological processes at both the central and peripheral level [12].
It has been estimated that about 80% of all known hormones and neurotransmitters activate cellular signal
transduction mechanisms via GPCRs [13]. The key common structural components of the GPCRs are the seven
transmembrane α-helices that span the cell membrane. It
has been estimated that GPCRs represent between 30–
45% of the current drug targets [14,15]. However, drugs
have only been developed for a very small number of the
GPCRs and the potential for further drug discovery within
this field is enormous.
The human GPCR repertoire has previously been divided
into five main families (GRAFS); Glutamate (clan C), Rhodopsin (clan A, includes the olfactory receptors), Adhesion
(clan B2), Frizzled/Taste2 and Secretin (clan B) [16]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

GRAFS families are found in all bilateral species and it has
thus been suggested that they arose before the split of
nematodes from the chordate lineage [17]. The largest
family is by far the Rhodopsin family, one reason being that
it includes the many olfactory receptors (ORs). Most of
the GPCR drug targets, mainly amine and peptide receptors, are found within this family [18]. In humans, the second largest family is the Adhesion family. Most of the
receptors in this family are still orphans (without a known
ligand) [19,20]. The Glutamate family includes receptors
that bind to glutamate, GABA and calcium as well as the
groups of sweet and umami taste receptors (TAS1Rs) and
vomeronasal receptors type 2 (V2Rs) that are binding
native exogenous compounds. The Secretins bind large
peptides such as secretin, parathyroid hormone, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, growth hormone releasing hormone and
pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating protein. The Frizzled
receptors bind among others the Wnt ligand and play an
important role in embryonic development. The vomeronasal receptors type 1 (Vomeronasal1) and taste receptor
type 2 (Taste2) GPCR families are involved in pheromone
recognition and bitter taste sensing, respectively. Moreover, there are gene sequences that have been suggested to
represent additional GPCRs but show only weak or no
sequence similarity to any of the main GPCR families.
Here we provide the first overall map of the GPCR subset
of the rat genome. We have made extensive efforts to mine
the GPCR repertoire and cover all GPCR families comprising a total of 1867 (+739 pseudogenes) gene sequences.
In addition we have also updated the human and the
mouse repertoires. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of the rat, human and mouse GPCR families and provide detailed information of their orthologous
relationships.

Results
The overall GPCR repertoires in rat, mouse and human
In this analysis we present the overall repertoire of GPCRs
in rats and updated versions of the GPCR repertoires in
humans and mice. The GPCR families found in humans,
GRAFS, have been slightly updated since they were last
described by our group, but the mouse datasets are nearly
identical [21]. The main difference is that in this analysis
the Vomeronasal1 family and the olfactory receptor (OR)
group are included and the Frizzled and Taste2 receptors
are considered as two separate families. Throughout this
article the GPCR families are written in italics; Adhesion,
Frizzled, Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Secretin, Taste2 and
Vomeronasal1, whereas the names of family subgroups are
abbreviated e.g. V2R (vomeronasal type 2 receptors) and
OR (olfactory receptors). Our classification of the GPCR
families is based strictly on sequence homology. This
analysis also includes 21 gene sequences that have been

suggested to encode GPCRs but do not belong to any of
the GPCR families (i.e. they have no sequence similarity).
These are referred to as "Other GPCRs" or just "Others".
The numbers of GPCR genes in the different families and
species are given in Table 1 and the names of the receptors
in each family and species is listed in a separate spreadsheet [see Additional File 1]. In Table 1, the GPCR genes
have been categorised as "full-length", "pseudogenes" or
"partial" and the numbers of new genes are also indicated.
Full-length GPCR genes contain an intact transmembrane
domain and are likely to encode functional receptor proteins. The pseudogenes are non-functional genes that have
been frame-shifted due to additions or deletions of nucleotides or truncated by missense mutations introducing
stop codons. The "partial" genes are missing parts of their
sequence due to incomplete information in the respective
genome assembly and in sequence databases. GPCR gene
sequences were defined as new if they had not been annotated as GPCRs in Genbank and did not exist in any of the
supplementary datasets linked to previous studies. The
GPCR repertoires in the rodents are more than twice as
large as that in humans, and rats have more GPCRs than
mice. This is mainly explained by the large differences in
the number of ORs, but a substantial part of the humanrodent differences is because of the vomeronasal receptors, Vomeronasal1s and V2Rs (a subset within the Glutamate family). There are no partial human GPCR genes, 2
in mice and 38 (1.4% of all genes) in rats. These figures
reflect the completeness of the respective genome assemblies which must now all be considered fairly complete.
Most (28/38) of the partial rat sequences are OR genes.
These are difficult to assemble due to their large numbers,
high sequence similarity and genomic proximity. In this
respect this analysis shows an important difference as
compared with for example the initial work on mouse by
Vassilatis and colleagues [22], which contained large
numbers of partial sequences. Our sequence datasets [see
Additional files 2, 3, 4] have, in all instances possible,
been carefully compared to previously published datasets
(see below).
Phylogenetic analyses
We produced phylogenetic trees for each GPCR family.
These are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and as additional files
of this article [see Additional files 5, 6, 7], which all also
hold pie charts of the proportions of orthologous and species-specific GPCRs in the three species analysed. The
mouse Glutamate, Rhodopsin (non-ORs), Adhesion, Frizzled
and Secretin GPCRs are not included in these trees since
they have been described before in relation to the human
repertoires [21], and the exact orthologous and paralogous relationships are viewed in a table listing the receptors in the three species studied [see Additional File 1]. All
receptors sequences were trimmed prior to the phylogenetic analysis to isolate the transmembrane domains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

which are the regions that are conserved throughout the
GPCR families. A special approach was used for the phylogenetic analysis of the Rhodopsin family which is very
challenging because of its size and diversity. Some Rhodopsin GPCRs have diverged to the extent that their relationships to the rest of the family members cannot be
determined. These receptor sequences do not show stable
tree topology and group with different subfamilies when
using different phylogenetic algorithms. The ambiguous
grouping of these receptors is also illustrated by the fact
that when their sequences are searched against the whole
dataset using BLAST the best matches (e.g. top 5) to these
receptors belong to different subfamilies. We minimised
the above problems by separating the receptors with a low
sequence identity from the main part of the dataset when
performing phylogenetic analyses. This was done by
applying iteratively higher thresholds of percentage
sequence identity on the dataset until a stable tree topology could be obtained.
The Rhodopsin family
The phylogenetic tree(s) of the Rhodopsin family in human
and rat is shown in Figure 1 and 2. The majority of the
Rhodopsins are in Figure 1, whereas other members with
ambiguous relationships are shown in Figure 2 as separate
groups, pairs and singles in the order of falling sequence
identity (to the sequences before them). Sequences
defined by the same percentage of sequence identity are
grouped in boxes with the threshold value given in the
lower right corner. In Figure 1 the α-δgroups, previously
defined by our group [16] were reproduced and they contain most of the receptors from the original analysis. 79%
of the human and rat Rhodopsins are found in one-to-one
orthologous pairs.
Rhodopsin family species variation
Several of the Rhodopsin family GPCRs show interesting
species variation. Most of the species-specific Rhodopsins
are found among the MAS-related GPCRs (MRGs), traceamine-associated receptors (TAARs) and "formyl peptide
receptor-like" (FPRLs) receptors. The group of MRGs are
located primarily in sensory neurons of the dorsal root
ganglion and are implicated in perception of pain [23].
The numbers of MRGs (at the 34% threshold) are 10, 15
and 28 in human, rat and mouse, respectively. There are 5
rat-human orthologous pairs of MRG receptors. The
TAARs (in the cluster of amine binding receptors) are 5,
15 and 17 in human, mouse and rat, respectively [24,25].
The FPRLs (slightly below and to the left of the centre of
the largest tree) Fprrs2, Fprrs3, Fprrs4 and Fprrs6 are rat
specific, whereas FPRL2 is only found in humans. The
remaining species-specific Rhodopsins are singles (shown
in bold style in Figure 1, 2) derived from a single gene
duplication or gene loss in either the primate or rodent
lineage. These are: 5-HT1E and 5-HT5B serotonin recep-

Rhodopsin

Figure 1
Phylogenetic analysis of the Rhodopsin family
Phylogenetic analysis of the Rhodopsin family. The figure shows a phylogenetic tree of Rhodopsin family receptors. Rhodopsins which display ambiguous relationships were analysed in separate (see Figure 2). Species-specific receptors have names
in bold style. The ligand types of the receptors are indicated with the following colours; red: orphan, blue: peptide, lilac: amine,
green: lipid-like, brown: purine, turquoise: opsin and black: other. The first pie chart above the trees shows the proportions of
human-rat one-to-one orthologues (O), human specific (H) and rat specific (R) members. The second pie chart displays the
proportions of rat-mouse one-to-one orthologues (O), rat specific (R) and mouse specific (M) members. This phylogenetic
tree is a consensus tree of 2 consensus trees derived from 100 maximum parsimony and neighbour joining analyses, respectively, and calculated using the UNIX version of the Phylip 3.6 package [73].

Figure 2 family receptors with ambiguous relationships to other members
Rhodopsin
Rhodopsin family receptors with ambiguous relationships to other members. Groups, pairs and "single" Rhodopsin
family receptors that display ambiguous relationships to other members (see material and methods). These are shown in order
of decreasing sequence identity (given in the lower right corner of each box). Species-specific receptors have names in bold
style. The ligand types of the receptors are indicated with the following colours; red: orphan, blue: peptide, lilac: amine, green:
lipid-like, brown: purine, turquoise: opsin and black: other. The phylogenetic trees are consensus trees of 100 maximum likelihood trees for which branch lengths were calculated using TreePuzzle (see material and method). The olfactory subfamily/
group of the Rhodopsin family was analysed in a separate phylogenetic analysis [see Additional files 7 and 8].

Phylogenetic trees of the Glutamate, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin and Taste2 families
Figure 3
Phylogenetic trees of the Glutamate, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin and Taste2 families. The figure shows the consensus trees of 100 maximum parsimony trees of the human and rat a) Glutamate, b) Adhesion, c) Frizzled, d) Secretin and e) Taste2
(mouse included) GPCR families. The first pie chart after the each family name shows the proportions of human-rat one-toone orthologues (O), human specific (H) and rat specific (R) members. The second pie chart displays the proportions of ratmouse one-to-one orthologues (O), rat specific (R) and mouse specific (M) members. In Figure 3, the place of the large group
of V2Rs is indicated with an arrow. Rat sequences that were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis because they were
incomplete (due to gaps in the genome assembly) are displayed with dashed branches.

(GnRHR2), Gpr165, Pgr15l, Thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (Trhr2) and the motilin receptor
(MLNR) (among the many peptide receptors); MCHR2

receptors, respectively); GPR32 and Gpr33 (under the
somatostatin and opioid receptor cluster in Figure 2);

(35% threshold); GPR78, LGR6 (32% threshold);
Gpr141b (30% threshold); Gpr166p (27%.) and GPR148
(26% threshold).
Rhodopsin family ligand types and orphan receptors
The colour coding of Figure 1 and 2 gives an overview of
the types of ligands or bound proteins for the Rhodopsin
family receptors. There are 100 peptide (blue), 45 lipid
(green), 38 amine (lilac), 13 purine (brown) -binding
human Rhodopsins and also 9 opsin receptors that are by
light (turquoise). One receptor, GPR17 has a dual ligand
specificity for purine and lipid molecules [26]. The
remaining 14 Rhodopsins (black) are scattered in smaller
groups of ligand types including protease-activated (F2R,
F2RL1, F2RL2 and mF2RL3), glycoprotein hormone
(FSHR, LHCGR and TSHR), metabolite (OXGR1, GPR35,
SUCNR1, GPR109A and GPR109B), amino acid (MRGPRD) and steroid hormone (estrogen receptor GPR30).
Moreover, we found that there are 65 human orphan Rhodopsins, of which 56 have orthologues in rats. 27 of the
human orphan Rhodopsins are grouped in the phylogenetic tree of the majority of the receptors (Figure 1),
whereas 38 have more atypical sequence and are found in
smaller groups, pairs or are singles (Figure 2). 27 of the
human orphan Rhodopsins could not be grouped with any
characterized receptor making ligand prediction difficult.
Additional information about the phylogenetic grouping
of ligand types and orphan receptors was presented in a
recent study by Surgand et al [27].
The Glutamate, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin and
Taste2 families
The Glutamate (except for the V2R group) (Fig. 2a) and
Secretin (Fig. 2d) families have a completely conserved
number of members between rats, mice and human and
they are all one-to-one orthologues. GPCRs belonging to
the Glutamate family have been shown to form functional
heterodimers or homodimers. The GABAB receptor is
formed by heterodimerization between one GABAB1 subunit and one GABAB2 subunit, the sweet taste receptor is
formed by heterodimerization between the T1R2 subunit
and the T1R3 subunit, whereas the umami taste receptor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

is formed by heterodimerization between the T1R1 subunit and the T1R3 subunit. Additional GPCRs within the
Secretin family are formed by heterodimerization
between a GPCR and an accessory protein [28]. In the
Frizzled family (Fig. 2c) one rat member, Fzd10, is a pseudogene. Two Adhesions (Fig. 2b), EMR2 and EMR3, were
previously shown to be missing in mice [29] and these are
also missing in the rat genome. Moreover, we now found
that the rat and mouse gene sequences of Gpr144 contain
stop codons within the transmembrane region and are
thus pseudogenes. We recently reported on two new
human pseudogenes of the Adhesion family, both similar
to GPR116 [21] and these have now received official
names from HUGOs Gene Nomenclature Committee and
are now referred to as GPR116P1 and GPR116P2, respectively. The rodent and human Taste2 families (Fig. 2e)
have a low proportion of one-to-one orthologous pairs.
Among the 35 rat, 35 mouse and 25 human receptors,
there are only 10 orthologous triplets (one copy from
each species). These represent 20% of all members,
whereas in rats and mice, 91% of the Taste2s make up oneto-one orthologous pairs. The number of Taste2s in our
datasets is equal or close to previously reported numbers
[30-35]. The rat receptors T2R39 and T2R45 [33] are not
available in any public sequence database.
The Vomeronasal1 receptor family
Five full-length Vomeronasal1 genes, VN1R1-5, have been
previously identified from sequence mining in the human
genome assembly [8]. We removed VN1R3 from this list
because it contains a frame shift in the current genome
assembly, but we found a new intact human
Vomeronasal1, FKSG83. The number of human
Vomeronasal1 pseudogenes was first estimated at 195 [8],
but this number was later reduced to 115 [9] and in this
study we found only 53. We found 145 full-length genes
and 164 Vomeronasal1 pseudogenes in the mouse genome
and 105 full-length genes and 84 pseudogenes in the rat
genome. These numbers are within the ranges of previously reported figures which are 137–187 full-length and
156–168 pseudogenes for mouse and 95–106 full-length
and 21–110 pseudogenes for rat [9-11,36,37]. We found
many non-Vomeronasal1s and duplicates within the datasets from Young et. al. [9]. A phylogenetic tree of the
Vomeronasal1 family was produced [see Additional File 5].
Only 9% of the rat-mouse receptors are one-to-one orthologues and there are no human-rat one-to-one orthologues.
The vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V2Rs)
The human V2R repertoire has not been mined in our previous whole genome GPCR repertoire articles and here we
identified 1 full-length gene and 11 pseudogenes. Moreover, we almost doubled the number of reported intact
V2Rs in rat (from 61 to 108) and mouse (from 57 to 111)

Page 8 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:338

and raised the total numbers of receptors considerably
(168 to 197 in rat and from 209 to 295 in mouse) [38].
Our phylogenetic tree of the V2Rs is available as an additional file [see Additional File 6]. There are no human-rat
orthologues in this receptor group and only 2% of the
rodent V2Rs are orthologues.
The olfactory receptors (ORs)
The olfactory receptors make up half or more of all GPCRs
in mammalian species (human: 49%, mouse 61% and rat
66%) and they constitute 1,7%, 4,5% and 5,3% of the
genes in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively
(gene numbers from Ensembl [39]). Our search for
human ORs identified all (388) of the full-length genes
and 96% of the pseudogenes in the HORDE database
[40], and in addition we found 12 new pseudogenes. This
shows that the sensitivity and specificity of our searches
was high. We identified 1081 full-length OR genes and
325 OR pseudogenes in the mouse genome which is close
to what was reported in a recent analysis which resulted in
1037 full-length genes and 354 pseudogenes [41]. We
found 1814 ORs (1234 full-length genes, 552 pseudogenes and 28 partial genes) in the rat genome. The rat
therefore has at least 153 (14%) more full-length OR
genes and 227 (70%) more OR pseudogenes than mice
and 846 (218%) more full-length OR genes and 73 (15%)
more OR pseudogenes than humans. The percentages of
pseudogenes are 23% in mouse, 31% in rats and 55% in
humans. An OR phylogenetic tree with pie charts of the
proportions of orthologues and the large tree file in Newick format were produced [see Additional files 7 and 8].
8% (120) of the rat and human ORs are orthologous, 18%
(268) are human specific and 74% (1115) are rat specific.
Of the mouse and rat ORs 31% (550) are orthologous,
30% (534) are mouse specific and 38% (675) are rat specific.
"Other GPCRs"
The additional sequences suggested by various sources to
be GPCRs, here called "Other GPCRs" or just "Others", are
shown in Table 2. There are 4 pairs (GPR107–GPR108,
GPR177–GPR178, GPR172A-GPR172B, TMEM185ATmem185a) and 2 triplets (GPR137-GPR137B-GPR137C,
PAQR5-PAQR7-PAQR8) of homologues within this set.
No additional sequences related to these have been found
in the human, mouse and rat genomes except for the
PAQRs that have additional homologues, but these are
not suggested to be GPCRs [42]. Thus the "Others" (except
the PAQRs) seem to make up protein families of their own
comprising only 1–3 members. GPR143 (OA1) is the only
one in this list that has been shown to be able to activate
a G protein [43]. For PAQR5 different reports describe
either plasma membrane or intracellular location [44,45].
PAQR5 GPR149 (IEDA), Gpr181p (pseudogene in
human) and GPR157 have vague and ambiguous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

sequence similarities to several different GPCRs families.
GPR107, GPR108, GPR137, GPR137B and GPR137C
show low similarity to various membrane bound proteins. Only GPR143, GPR149, Gpr181p and GPR157
show a higher similarity to membrane proteins than other
proteins and 10 Others are indicated to have more or less
than 7 transmembrane regions. Some sequences suggested to be GPCRs have later been shown to be members
of other membrane protein families. We found one such
example when searching in the non-redundant database
for alternative versions of putative GPCR sequences. A
protein [GenBank: BAB15283.1] recently discovered by
searches utilising Hidden Markov Models and suggested
to be a GPCR [46] is a sugar transporter, MYL5/MFSD7
[GenBank: AAQ88767] comprising 12 transmembrane
helices. Two additional human GPCR sequences from the
same study have now received GPR names, GPR177 and
GPR178, by HGNC upon our request and are found
among the Others in Table 2.

Discussion
Here we present the first overall analysis of the GPCR subset of the rat genome and we provide updated versions of
the human and mouse GPCR repertoires. 1276 (68%) of
the full-length rat GPCRs had not been previously annotated and we also identified 40 new mouse receptors and
1 new human receptor. Of the new receptors in this study,
93% are ORs and 6% are vomeronasal receptors. We have
performed comprehensive sequence mining and our datasets have been carefully compared with previously available versions. The GPCR gene sequences have been verified
for a complete and non-interrupted coding region and
incorrectly predicted sequences have been manually
curated. We also performed phylogenetic analyses displaying for the first time the detailed orthologous relationships of the GPCR repertoires in rats, mice and
humans. This information is valuable when results from
pharmacological and physiological studies are compared
or extrapolated between species.
The authors of the draft rat genome assembly estimated
the proportion of one-to-one orthologues to be 89–90%
between the rat and human genomes and 86–94%
between the rat and mouse genomes [1]. The average
amino acid sequence identities of the orthologues were
reported to be 88.3% for rat and human and 95.0% for rat
and mouse. Remarkably, we find that the average proportion of one-to-one orthologues within the GPCR superfamily is much lower. The average proportions of such
orthologues were only 58% for the rat and human, and
70% for the rat and mouse GPCR repertoires. The average
protein sequence identities of the GPCR orthologue pairs
is also lower than for the whole genomes. We found these
to be 80% for the rat and human pairs and 90% for the rat
and mouse pairs. This suggests that the GPCR superfamily

"Other GPCRs"; sequences that have been suggested to be GPCRs but are not members of any GPCR family. The searches for transmembrane
helices were made using TMHMM version 2.0 [86]. Conserved domains were searched for using conserved domain search [71] with a cut-off at e =
0.01. The BLAST searches for the most similar proteins were performed in the Refseq database using a cut-off at e = 0.01.

is much more divergent than the protein families in the
genome in general. However, this difference in the proportions and sequence identities of orthologues may not
entirely be explained by the relatively high divergence of
the GPCR superfamily. This is also related to the fact that
we have mined and edited the sequences to a much more
complete level than the sequence data from the original
draft rat genome assembly.
There are very different levels of evolutionary conservation or orthologous pairing of the GPCR families. There
are families in which all (Glutamate (except the V2R
group) and Secretin families) or almost all (Adhesion and
Frizzled) receptors are conserved between the compared
species. Other families have expanded separately in the
three species (primarily the Taste2s) or expanded in one
lineage while vanishing (Vomeronsal1 and V2R) in
another. There are also remarkable examples of family
subgroups that have all expanded in the rodents while
diminishing in primates (olfactory receptors (ORs), traceamine-associated receptors (TAARs), MAS-related GPCRs
(MRGs), formyl peptide receptor like receptors (FPRLs)
and vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V2Rs)). It is notable
that all the large inter-species variations are found among
the families and subgroups that respond to exogenous
stimuli. Thus these differences are likely to make important contributions to the diversification of the senses of

olfaction, taste and pheromone sensation among the species. The pheromone sensation has evolved in rats and
mice, which have many species-specific vomeronasal
receptors (Vomeronasal1s and V2Rs), but disappeared in
the primate lineage in which the vomeronasal organ is
regressed in adults and critical components of vomeronasal transduction pathway have been lost [47,48]. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the TAARs may act as
chemosensory receptors in the olfactory epithelium
[49,50].
There is a considerable variation among the different families and groups of GPCRs in the percentage of amino acid
identity of orthologues. The rat and human Frizzled family
orthologues have 95% average sequence identity while
the lowest percentage identity between rats and human
orthologous pairs is found in the Taste2 family (58%).
The Taste2 family also display a very high divergence with
respect to the repertoire. Only 20% of the rat and human
and 84% of the rat and mouse receptors are one-to-one
orthologues, indicating that this family is evolving rapidly. The Taste2 receptors mediate the sense of bitter taste
[51] and it is likely that their divergence has contributed
to the different capacities of species to recognise bitter
tastants. Also the Adhesion family GPCRs display relatively
low amino acid identity between rat, mouse and human
orthologues (72%). However, in contrast to the Taste2

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:338

family, the Adhesion family repertoire is relatively well
conserved; 100% of the rat and mouse and 91% of the rat
and human Adhesions make up one-to-one orthologous
pairs. The fact that the Adhesions have been retained during evolution shows that they have important physiological functions and their relatively low sequence
conservation indicate that their action is less dependent
on the transmembrane region. This is in agreement with
the hypothesis that the transmembrane regions of the
Adhesion GPCRs may perhaps not be involved in direct
interactions with ligands or G-proteins but have an
important role as membrane anchors [52].
The human ORs have previously been divided into class I
and class II based on phylogenetic criteria [53]. The
human genome contains 53 (14%) class I and 335 (86%)
class II ORs and our analysis shows that the rat genome
includes 139 (11%) class I ORs and 1096 (89%) class II.
Class I ORs mediate the effect of water-soluble odorants
and class II receptors recognise airborne odorants [53,54].
The proportion of rat and mouse OR orthologues is relatively low (31%) and the proportion of rat and human OR
orthologues is very low (8%). Species-specific receptors
can be found in most parts of the phylogenetic tree, but
there are also several large clusters of species-specific ORs
[see Additional File 8]. There are five large clusters containing exclusively rat-specific ORs. These are located closest to the human OR1F (18 rat ORs), OR1I1 (7 rat ORs),
OR7A5,10,17 (6 rat ORs), OR2AK2 (6 rat ORs), OR2B11
(9 rat ORs) (for nomenclature, see [53]). Many humanspecific ORs were found in the OR2T-group which contains 13 human ORs (OR2T1–7, 10–11, 27, 29, 34, 35)
without a rodent orthologue. These species-specific clusters include receptors exclusively belonging to class II suggesting that this differentiation between the species has
contributed to the unique capacities to recognise volatile
airborne substances.
It is difficult to envision why in some cases several species
lack a certain receptor while the same receptor has been
retained during evolution in other lineages/species. One
of the most likely explanations is that the gene has been
lost because another gene has taken over its functions.
One example of this could be the motilin receptor, MLNR.
We did not find orthologues to this human receptor in
neither rat nor mouse. In further searches (data not
shown) we did however, find orthologues for this receptor
in chimps (partial sequence), cow, chicken, zebrafish and
pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) but not in dogs, suggesting that this receptor has been specifically lost in several mammals. MLNR is most closest related to the ghrelin
receptor, GHSR (named after the subfragment of the
growth hormone secretagogue peptide) and these receptors have 44.2% overall protein sequence identity. Motilin
stimulates gastrointestinal motility and this function is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

modulated by a pharmaceutical substance, erythromycin
A, which mimics this peptide and targets the MLNR receptor [55,56]. It has been shown that the ghrelin peptide
with its receptor regulates gastrointestinal motility in
rodents and the expression of GHSR in the human gastrointestinal tract indicates that ghrelin plays a role in gastrointestinal motility in humans as well [57-59]. It is thus
possible that the ghrelin system plays a compensating role
in GI motility in species that are missing the motilin
receptor, such as rodents and dogs.
There are several additional cases in which two Rhodopsin
family receptors have the same ligand and could share
functions in some species while one of the receptors has
been lost in several other evolutionary lineages such that
the other gene may have taken over. TRHR and Trhr2 both
bind to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The
former receptor has been conserved throughout all
searched vertebrate genomes whereas Trhr2 is lacking in
primates, chicken and fugu suggesting that it has been lost
independently in three lineages. Furthermore the neuropeptide B/W receptors (NPBWR1 and NPBWR2) have a
62.2% overall sequence identity in human. We found
both NPBWR1 and NPBWR2 in fish but whereas
NPBWR1 has been retained in the examined vertebrate
species NPBWR2 is found neither in the dog nor the
chicken genomes and has become a pseudogene in the
rodent lineage. Another similar case is seen for the melanin-concentrating hormone receptors MCHR1 and
MCHR2. We could find both receptor subtypes in fish but
whereas the former has been conserved the latter,
MCHR2, is absent or is a pseudogene in rat, mouse, hamster, guinea pig and chicken [60]. This is illustrated also
for another Rhodopsin family receptor, OXER1, which is
missing in the rodents and in chicken but is conserved in
fish, primates, cow and dog (1 full-length gene and 1
pseudogene). For this receptor there exists no characterized homologue that binds the same ligand (5-oxo-ETE)
but there are several closely related orphan receptors such
as GPR31, GPR81, GPR109A and GPR109B (primate specific duplicate) that could tentatively be activated by the
same ligand.
In summary, we have presented the overall GPCR repertoire of rats and analysed it in relation to updated datasets
for human and mouse. We have identified new genes,
made extensive comparisons to previously published
datasets and performed phylogenetic analyses to distinguish orthologous and species-specific receptors. This
material is important for the interpretation of studies in
which results are extrapolated between species to provide
information about receptor structure or native ligand.

Conclusion
We present the first overall analysis of the GPCR repertoire
in rats and compare this to versions of those in mouse and
human. The receptor sequences have been manually
curated to assure a higher level of completeness and quality. The detailed relationships of the repertoires, here
determined by careful phylogenetic analyses, are valuable
information when results from pharmacological and
physiological studies are compared or extrapolated
between species. The greatest diversification, with regard
to both receptor numbers and sequences, is seen for those
GPCRs that respond to exogenous stimuli indicating that
the alteration of the repertoires of these receptors has been
important for adaptation of the species to their environment. Our detailed comparison of GPCR repertoires also
revealed several examples of species-specific expansions
and deletions. We performed an extended analysis in
additional species of several Rhodopsins that were shown
to have been lost in different lineages but retained in others, investigating if their function might be shared with
another (homologous) receptor. Most Rhodopsin family
GPCRs that bind the same type of ligands, e.g. lipids and
peptides, formed coherent groups in our phylogenetic
analysis. However, many (28) of the human orphan Rhodopsins could not be grouped with any characterized
receptor because of low sequence identity and/or ambiguous relationships making the prediction of the ligand difficult. We found the number of human orphan Rhodopsin
receptors to be 65 while the number was 84 in 2002 [61]
suggesting that the current rate of de-orphanization is
higher than that for the discovery of members of this family.

Methods
Identification of rat GPCRs of the Glutamate, Rhodopsin,
Adhesion, Frizzled and Secretin family receptors
The mouse GPCRs of the Glutamate (except V2R group),
Rhodopsin (except OR group), Adhesion, Frizzled and Secretin families [21] were used as baits in stand alone BLASTP
and TBLASTN searches [62] against NCBI non-redundant
(nr) database [63]. For each and every query the accession
numbers of the 20 first hits were collected and a nonredundant list was obtained which was used to collect the
sequences of the hits. Sequence duplicates with different
names were identified using BLASTCLUST [62] with the
threshold set at 99% sequence identity. Remaining duplicates were splice variants or contained sequence polymorphisms or sequencing errors exceeding a base difference of
1% of the total sequence. These were identified from their
genomic overlap as determined using stand alone BLAT
against the June 2003 rat genome assembly. Missing rat
orthologues were searched for using online BLAT [64] and
TBLASTN against the nr and Celera databases [65].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

Identification of the human, rat and mouse OR, Taste2,
Vomeronasal1 and V2R receptors
TBLASTN searches in genome assemblies
Query datasets were retrieved by downloading a start set
of human, rat and mouse GPCR protein sequences from
the Genbank database using the Entrez data-retrieval tool
[66] in keyword searches. The downloaded datasets were
searched using TBLASTN against the October 2005
releases of the Ensembl human (build 35), mouse (build
34) and rat (assembly 3.4) genome assemblies [5]. For the
OR, Taste2 and Vomeronasal1 receptors, which are all
intronless, we used the whole protein sequences. For the
V2R, which have several exons, we used only the transmembrane region which is located within one exon. The
cut offs used were e = 0.01 for the OR and rat V2R searches
and e = 1 for the Taste2 and Vomeronasal1 searches.
Extracting gene sequences and removing non-GPCRs
The TBLASTN searches result lists, previously saved in tabular format, were processed so that overlapping hits on
the same strand were merged using a custom made Java
program (available upon request). The chromosome
coordinates of the merged hits were used to extract the
corresponding sequences from the genome using
fastacmd of the NCBI blast package. Each sequence was
elongated upstream until the first start codon and downstream until the first stop codon using a custom made Java
program (available upon request). The preliminary datasets were "cleaned" from non-GPCRs and GPCRs from
other families by searching it against the Refseq database
using BLASTN with the default settings. The criterion used
when including new GPCRs was that at least the first two
hits had to belong to the same GPCR family. Protein
translations were obtained using transeq from the
EMBOSS package [67] and from these the longest intact
coding domain was extracted. Protein translations were
considered full-length proteins if they contained an intact
seven transmembrane region. Proteins containing 5 or
more unknown positions due to incompleteness in the
genome assemblies were removed and put into a "partial"
category of gene sequences.
Naming the GPCRs
The human receptors have been named using the official
Gene name and rat and mouse orthologues have been
named after their human counterpart. For those human
GPCRs which lacked official Gene names we requested
new names from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [68]. We obtained new names for
GPR177, GPR178 and GPR181P. We also received the
official names for GPR116P1, GPR116P2, GPR166P and
P2RY10P2 which had been previously been named by
HGNC. The human ORs were named according to a
widely accepted nomenclature (e.g. OR1A2) after matching our dataset to that of the HORDE database [40]. The

Page 12 of 17

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:338

Vomeronasal1s were named after existing nomenclatures
for human [8], rat [11] and mouse [37,69]. There existed
a nomenclature for the rodent V2Rs [38], which we used.
For the Taste2s we used the official Gene names which are
T2R-X in human and Tas2r-X in mouse, where X is a
number. In rat these two nomenclatures are mixed and
several members lack a Gene name. Other new receptors
were assigned labels according to their chromosome coordinates prefixed by a letter indicating the species: human
(H), rat (r) and mouse (m).
Phylogenetic analyses
Removing non-conserved sequence regions
For the Rhodopsins the N-termini, C-termini and loops
were defined from alignments to the protein sequence of
the crystallised bovine Rhodopsin structure [70] and
removed. For the other families NCBI's conserved domain
search [71] was used to identify the borders of the transmembrane region and removing the N- and C-termini.
The ORs and Vomeronasal1s were cut according to the
"7tm_1" domain (Rhodopsin family), the Taste2s to the
TAS2R domain, the Glutamate receptors (including the
V2Rs) to the "7tm_3" domain (metabotropic glutamate
family) and the Adhesions and Secretins to the "7tm_2"
domain (Secretin family).
Division of the Rhodopsin family dataset
BLASTCLUST was used to apply a minimum threshold of
protein sequence identity on a dataset consisting of all
human Rhodopsins. The receptor with the lowest identity
(less than 23%) to other Rhodopsins is GPR160 and this
receptor was the first to be separated from the remaining
dataset (Fig. 2). The clustering and separation procedure
was repeated at increasing thresholds of sequence identity
allowing the iterative separation of groups, pairs and single members with atypical sequences. This division of the
dataset continued until we obtained reproducible topology of the human Rhodopsins in neighbor joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses (data
not shown). This was achieved after the 36% threshold for
sequence identity. All sequences that were separated from
the main dataset were subject to BLAST searches against
the whole human dataset. Queried/searched sequences
which had all first five BLAST hits in the same cluster of
related sequences were considered distant relatives and
were merged with that particular cluster/dataset. The rat
Rhodopsin receptors were merged with the corresponding
dataset of human orthologues. A length threshold of 50%
was used for the BLASTCLUST clustering.
Sequence aligning and bootstrapping
All datasets were aligned using CLUSTALW 1.82 [72] with
default alignment parameters. Pseudogenes were
excluded and the transmembrane regions extracted as
described above. The stability of the phylogenetic branch-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/338

ing was determined using bootstrap analyses. The alignments were bootstrapped 100 times using SEQBOOT
from the UNIX version of the PHYLIP 3.6 package [73],
except for the olfactory receptor (OR) alignment which
was bootstrapped 10 times. This resulted in a total of 100
(10 for the ORs) different alignments from the original
dataset, respectively.
Calculating phylogenetic trees
Unless otherwise specified the bootstrapped files were
used for calculating maximum parsimony (MP) trees with
PROTPARS from the PHYLIP 3.6 package. The trees were
un-rooted and calculated using ordinary parsimony and
the topologies were obtained using the built-in tree search
procedure. From the bootstrapped OR alignment files
protein distances were calculated using PROTDIST from
the Win32 version of the PHYLIP 3.6 package. The JonesTaylor-Thornton matrix was used for the calculation. The
trees were calculated from the 10 different distance matrices, previously generated with PROTDIST, using NEIGHBOR from the same package. For the Rhodopsin family the
largest (non-OR) group (Figure 2) was analysed with both
MP and neighbor joining (NJ), whereas maximum likelihood (ML) was used for all other groups (Figure 3). For
the latter groups branch lengths were calculated using the
ML consensus tree as a user defined tree in TreePuzzle
[74]. The following parameters were used; Type of analysis: Tree reconstruction; Tree-search procedure: Userdefined trees; Compute clocklike branch lengths: Yes;
Location of root: Best Place (automatic search); Parameter
estimates: Exact (slow); Parameter-estimation uses: 1st
input tree; Type of sequence input data: Amino acids;
Model of substitution: VT Mueller-Vingron Model of Substitution, 2000); Amino acid frequencies: Estimate from
dataset; Model of rate heterogeneity: Mixed (one invariable plus eight Gamma rates); Fraction of invariable sites:
Estimate from dataset; Gamma distribution parameter
alpha: Estimate from dataset; Number of Gamma rate categories: eight.
Merging and viewing the trees
The tree files were merged using the GNU-UNIX cat command and the resulting files were analysed using CONSENSE, from the PHYLIP 3.6 package, to retrieve
bootstrapped consensus trees. The largest human-rat Rhodopsin family tree is a consensus tree of two other consensus trees, one from the NJ analysis and the other from the
MP analysis. The trees were plotted using TREEVIEW and
manually edited in CANVAS.
Ligand type classification for the human Rhodopsins
An in-house list of ligand types for the human Rhodopsins
was updated by obtaining missing ligand information
from the receptor list maintained by the International
Union of Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomen-

clature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR) [75].
Receptors that did not have a ligand in this list were considered candidate orphan receptors. These were systematically searched using keyword look-ups in Pubmed and
BLAST in the NCBI's non-redundant (nr) database to find
receptor deorphanization reports [26,76-85]. The same
GPCR often has several names and in order to obtain a
higher coverage of publications we used names found
from HGNC, NCBI Gene and the identical BLAST hits.
