Abstract
Background: Human α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGA) are presumed to share a
common ancestor. Deficiencies of these enzymes cause two well-characterized human lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) –
Fabry (α-GAL deficiency) and Schindler (α-NAGA deficiency) diseases. Caenorhabditis elegans was previously shown to be a
relevant model organism for several late endosomal/lysosomal membrane proteins associated with LSDs. The aim of this study
was to identify and characterize C. elegans orthologs to both human lysosomal luminal proteins α-GAL and α-NAGA.
Results: BlastP searches for orthologs of human α-GAL and α-NAGA revealed a single C. elegans gene (R07B7.11) with
homology to both human genes (α-galactosidase and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) – gana-1. We cloned and sequenced the
complete gana-1 cDNA and elucidated the gene organization.
Phylogenetic analyses and homology modeling of GANA-1 based on the 3D structure of chicken α-NAGA, rice α-GAL and
human α-GAL suggest a close evolutionary relationship of GANA-1 to both human α-GAL and α-NAGA.
Both α-GAL and α-NAGA enzymatic activities were detected in C. elegans mixed culture homogenates. However, α-GAL
activity on an artificial substrate was completely inhibited by the α-NAGA inhibitor, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine.
A GANA-1::GFP fusion protein expressed from a transgene, containing the complete gana-1 coding region and 3 kb of its
hypothetical promoter, was not detectable under the standard laboratory conditions. The GFP signal was observed solely in a
vesicular compartment of coelomocytes of the animals treated with Concanamycin A (CON A) or NH4Cl, agents that increase
the pH of the cellular acidic compartment.
Immunofluorescence detection of the fusion protein using polyclonal anti-GFP antibody showed a broader and coarsely granular
cytoplasmic expression pattern in body wall muscle cells, intestinal cells, and a vesicular compartment of coelomocytes.
Inhibition of gana-1 by RNA interference resulted in a decrease of both α-GAL and α-NAGA activities measured in mixed stage
culture homogenates but did not cause any obvious phenotype.
Conclusions: GANA-1 is a single C. elegans ortholog of both human α-GAL and α-NAGA proteins. Phylogenetic, homology
modeling, biochemical and GFP expression analyses support the hypothesis that GANA-1 has dual enzymatic activity and is
localized in an acidic cellular compartment.

Background

Humans have two enzymes with α-galactosidase activity
and an acidic pH optimum, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
(α-NAGA) (previously called α-galactosidase B) and αgalactosidase A (α-GAL). Hereditary deficiency of each of
the hydrolases causes a distinct lysosomal storage disorder
in humans, Schindler and Fabry diseases, respectively
[1,2].
Early studies suggested that both human enzymes were
glycoforms with similar substrate specifities. Purified
enzymes had similar physical properties, including subunit molecular mass (~46 kDa), homodimeric structure,
and amino acid sequences. However, additional studies
showed kinetic, structural, and immunologic differences
proving that α-GAL and α-NAGA were products of two
different genes [3,4]. The two genes differed in the
number of exons (7 and 9, respectively) and also in the
number, placement, and orientation of Alu repeats. Exons
2 – 7 of the α-NAGA gene showed high similarity to the
first six exons of α-GAL gene. Because of the remarkable
amino acid identity (49%) and similarity (63%) between
the two genes and the similar intron placement, Wang [5]
and co-workers suggested that a duplication event
occurred during the evolution of both enzymes.
Both enzymes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 27
clan D [6]. Glycoside hydrolase family 27 clan D
orthologs have been identified in a broad spectrum of
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including plants. Members of
the family have a highly similar active site and share the
same reaction mechanism. The structures of chicken αNAGA, human α-GAL and rice α-GAL have been determined by X-ray crystallography [7-9]. Chicken and
human enzymes have a homodimeric quarternary structure whereas rice α-GAL acts as a monomer. The monomer units are composed of two distinct domains. Domain
I contains the active site and adopts a (β/α)8 barrel structure, a domain fold observed commonly in glycosidases.
Domain II has eight antiparallel β strands, packed into
two β sheets in a β sandwich fold containing a Greek key
motif [8].
The physiological importance of both enzymes is evidenced by the severe presentation of α-NAGA and α-GAL
deficiencies in humans [1,2].
Our recent study on degradation of blood group A and B
glycolipids in Fabry cells indicated a high residual activity
in Fabry cells toward natural substrate glycolipid B-6-2
[10] although α-galactosidase activity was completely
absent when measured in vitro by routine procedures
using artificial substrates. We proposed that another
enzyme, different from α-GAL, contributes in vivo to
hydrolysis of α-galactosides. We suggested α-NAGA as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/6/5

most likely candidate. Human α-NAGA is known to
accept α-galactosides albeit with a high Km [11,12]. Its
activity must be inhibited when measuring α-GAL in tissues with high α-NAGA activity [13].
We investigated the phylogenesis of a single C. elegans αGAL and α-NAGA ortholog (gana-1) to both human
genes. We present evidence suggesting that this gene has
indeed evolved from the α-GAL/α-NAGA ancestral gene
before the duplication event which resulted in separate αNAGA and α-GAL genes in higher metazoans. We further
performed structural analysis of the GANA-1 3D model
acquired by homology modeling. We determined the spatial and temporal expression of the gene in transgenic
worms using a translational reporter and examined the
effect of RNA interference (RNAi) as a first step in the possible use of C. elegans as a model organism for Schindler
and Fabry diseases.

Results and discussion
cDNA amplification and sequencing
The complete C. elegans genome [14,15] contains only
one open reading frame, designated gana-1 (R07B7.11)
that has sequence similar to human genes encoding αGAL and α-NAGA. Similar results were obtained from
searching the available C. briggsae genome sequence [15].
The gana-1 gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns and is
annotated as an ortholog of human α-NAGA. Several EST
clones for this open reading frame (ORF) have been
reported and open-reading-frame sequence tag (OST) is
present in the Worfdb database [16]. Available public
database data are in agreement with our findings.

We verified the gene structure by sequencing the PCR
products from genomic DNA and cDNA (Figure 1). The
analyzed region spanned the entire coding region and the
3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTR). The 5' UTR SL1 element suggests that the gene is either the only gene transcribed from the promoter or is the first gene in an operon
including gana-1 and the two predicted downstream genes
R07B7.12 and R07B7.13. Although this region has not
been reported as an operon, the physical distances
between this cluster of three genes are suggestive of an
operon [17-19]. No alternative splicing was found using
RT/PCR, a feature similar to both human and mouse
orthologs. RNA editing was reported in the 3' UTR of
human α-GAL, a finding that another group was unable to
confirm [20]. We noted no signs of RNA editing in clones
derived from the gana-1 cDNA.
Phylogenetic studies
We aligned GANA-1 protein sequence with other melibiase family members (Figure 2) and constructed a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). The alignment showed a striking
similarity of GANA-1 to all other included sequences.

gana-1 gene structure. Schematic representation of gana-1 gene structure. The length of genomic DNA from start to stop
codons is 1681 bp. The spliced cDNA consists of 1356 bp + 91 bp of 3' UTR.

GANA-1 had the highest sequence similarity with Anopheles gambiae GAL (46%), the lowest similarity was observed
with Streptomyces avertimilis GAL (22%). The results of our
phylogenetic analysis are in accordance with generally
accepted evolutionary concepts. The analysis identified
four main clades: animal NAGAs, animal GALs, plant/
lower organisms GALs and the clade containing sequences
of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and
Caenorhabditis elegans. The branch including C. elegans is
positioned between higher animal GALs and NAGAs and
plant/lower organisms GALs. This position in the tree
infers the evolutionary ancestrality of gana-1 gene to both
animal GALs and animal NAGAs. However, this conclusion is not in complete agreement with the presence of
pairs of genes in Drosophila and Anopheles genomes annotated as α-GALs and α-NAGAs. The presence of these
genes in the Caenorhabditis/Drosophila/Anopheles branch
(and not in the GAL and NAGA clades) could be due to
low divergence of these sequences from a common ancestral gene or to independent gene duplication in the Drosophila/Anopheles ancestral organism. It is also important
to note that the phylogenetic analysis by maximum parsimony algorithm placed the Caenorhabditis/Drosophila/
Anopheles branch into the neighborhood of the animal
NAGAs branch [8]. In this case the computational algorithm probably favored the lower number of necessary
sequence changes (parsimony) between GANA-1 and
NAGA clade sequences.
In our opinion, the phylogenetic analysis provides evidence that the GANA-1 evolved from a common ancestor
of α-GAL and α-NAGA enzymes. However, the topology
of the tree could also be explained by a loss of the second
gene during the evolution of C. elegans. In this case the
enzyme found in C. elegans would probably be the
ortholog of human α-NAGA and the lost gene would

likely be the ortholog of human α-GAL. The likelihood of
these two hypotheses depends on functional divergence
of duplicated gene products and their dispensability for
organism's metabolic pathways [21].
Homology modeling
The best Squared Root of Mean Square Deviations value
(RMSD), found between GANA-1 backbone atoms and
the chicken α-NAGA template [7], was 0.52 Å. The structural model of the enzyme molecule has a two-domain
structure (Figure 4A). Domain I, which contains the predicted active site, adopts a (β/α)8 barrel structure which
represents a common motif in many glycoside hydrolases.
Less conserved is domain II that has a β domain with β
sandwich structure containing a Greek key motif. The
active site pocket of GANA-1 is formed by the same twelve
amino acids (W31, D76, D77, Y118, C126, K152, D154,
C156, S186, A189, Y190 and R211) (Figure 4B) as in
chicken α-NAGA. This finding infers their identical function in catalytic reactions as described for chicken αNAGA [7]. D134 carboxyl starts the initial nucleophilic
attack and D215 carboxylic oxygen serves as a subsequent
donor and acceptor of the proton during the reaction
cycle.

Residues forming the "N-acetyl recognition loop" in the
chicken α-NAGA [8] (S172, A175, Y176) have the closest
contact with the N-acetyl moiety of the ligand. These residues are completely conserved between human and
chicken NAGAs, but in human α-GAL serin 172 is
replaced by glutamine and alanine 175 is replaced by leucine. The replacements with bulkier residues apparently
discriminate between α-GAL and α-NAGA substrates.
While NAGAs can accommodate α-galactose and can have
some α-GAL activity, GALs do not have α-NAGA activity

and are not inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine. The
corresponding residues of GANA-1 in the NAGA recognition loop are S186 and A189 and are characteristic for
NAGAs.
According to Garman [8] the key residue in the dimer
interface in human α-GAL is F273. Residues corresponding to this position in other orthologs can serve as predictive markers of the protein quartenary structure.
Phenylalanine or tyrosine is present in enzymes that act as
homodimers while glycin indicates a monomeric
structure [8]. The equivalent residue to human α-GAL
F273 in GANA-1 is lysine at position 257 which is suggestive of homodimeric structure due to its sterical properties. The homology modeling showed that a groove
opposing K257 is formed by residues T260, L261, D262,
M263, I389, V390 and V391 of the other monomer unit
of GANA-1. In the case of chicken α-NAGA these residues
are equivalent to S246, Y247, E248, Q249, N375, P376
and S377 (for details see Additional file 1).
Biochemical studies
Standard bacteria/nematode separation protocol previously used by other authors [22,23] while evaluating lysosomal enzyme activites is based on sucrose flotation
approach. We avoided standard sucrose flotation of
worms because we could not exclude unpredictable artifacts caused by this compound, which is known to induce
artificial lysosomal storage in eukaryotic cells and to alter
lysosomal gene expression at concentrations significantly
lower [24] than those used in flotation protocols.

predicts only one active site per monomer of the enzyme.
If the enzyme had activity toward both substrates, MU-αD-galactopyranoside and MU-α-N-acetylgalactosaminide,
it is to be expected that D-GalNAc and D-Gal would
inhibit both activities. The strong inhibitory effect of DGalNAc on the α-GAL activity, which is not present in
human α-GAL, supports the hypothesis that C. elegans has
only one enzyme with both α-GAL and α-NAGA activities.
Nevertheless, these experiments were not conducted with
the pure enzyme and thus do not provide absolute proof
of this hypothesis.
RNA interference
RNA interference assays directed against the whole coding
region of gana-1, employing combination of microinjection and feeding approaches, did not reveal any abnormal
morphological phenotypes. Nevertheless, measurement
of α-GAL and α-NAGA activities in four different experiments showed a simultaneous decrease of both enzymatic
activities in RNAi-treated worms (Table 1) as compared
with control animals. In all RNAi experiments, both αGAL and α-NAGA activities decreased proportionally,
usually by tens of percent of activity of appropriate controls. The activity of the control enzyme (β-hexosaminidase) did not differ between the RNAi-treated nematodes
and controls (data not shown). This finding supports the
specificity of gana-1 RNAi. The differences between individual experiments are not surprising due to the wellknown variability in the efficiency of RNAi [26]. The
results of RNAi experiments further support the hypothesis that GANA-1 has both enzymatic activities.

We found both α-GAL and α-NAGA enzymatic activities
in the homogenates from C. elegans N2 strain using 4methylumbelliferyl (MU) substrates. The α-NAGA activity
was dominant over the α-GAL activity. The activity of αNAGA measured at 37°C was 430 nmol.mg-1.h-1 with
MU-α-N-acetylgalactosaminide compared to the activity
of α-GAL with MU-α-galactopyranoside of 43 nmol.mg1.h-1 (about 10% of that of α-NAGA).

Both enzymatic activities were lower in RNAi-treated and
control worms cultured on the bacterial strain HT115 [26]
compared to a N2 strain cultured on the OP50 strain.

In the assay of α-GAL, the degradation of the MU-αgalactopyranoside was inhibited up to 95% in the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (D-GalNAc), whereas
in the presence of D-galactose (D-Gal) the degradation of
the same substrate was inhibited up to 75%. In the assay
of α-NAGA, the degradation of the MU-α-N-acetylgalactosaminide was inhibited up to 97% by D-GalNAc and up
to 90% by D-Gal. No inhibition of α-NAGA and α-GAL
activity by D-glucose was observed.

Expression of gana-1
To study the expression of gana-1 in C. elegans, we created
transgenic worms with a reporter gene containing the
entire coding region of gana-1 C-terminally tagged with
green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a 3
kb region of the gana-1 hypothetical promoter. The presence of the gana-1::GFP transgene in the worms was confirmed on the level of genomic DNA, cDNA and protein.
However, no GFP signal was observed by fluorescence
microscopy under the standard laboratory conditions. As
Western blotting showed the presence of fusion protein of
the expected size (data not shown), we assumed that the
absence of the GFP signal was caused by a pH-dependent

According to published observations in human enzymes,
D-GalNAc has no inhibitory effect on α-GAL activity. On
the other hand, human α-NAGA activity is inhibited by
both, D-GalNAc and D-Gal [25]. The model of GANA-1

RNAi previously provided sufficient level of inhibition of
structural lysosomal proteins for development of abnormal phenotypes in the worm [27,28]; however, it is apparently not efficient enough for lysosomal catalytic proteins.

quenching of GFP fluorescence, which has neutral to alkaline optimum (pH 5.5–12) [29].
To study the tissue and intracellular distribution of the
fusion protein, we resorted to immunofluorescence detection of the transgene product. Immunofluorescence detection of GFP fusion protein showed a specific and coarsely
granular cytoplasmic pattern of fusion protein expression.
This transgene product was limited to body wall muscle
cells (30% of population) (Figure 5A, Additional file 2) or
found in a broader tissue distribution that included body
wall muscle cells, intestinal cells and coelomocytes (3–5%
of population) (Figure 5B, Additional file 3).
This latter staining pattern is consistent with the GFP
detection in NH4Cl and concanamycin A (CON A) experiments (Figure 6) discussed below. The expression of the
transgene was observed in about 30% of the population
which corresponded to usual expression efficiency of
extrachromosomal array transgenes [30,31]. The immunofluorescence staining protocol resulted in a significant
decrease of inherent intestinal granular autofluorescence
previously assigned to secondary lysosomes [32]. The
decrease of autofluorescence intensity together with its
poorly defined emission spectra hampered co-localization study.
To confirm that the absence of the GFP signal was due to
the quenching of fluorescence by low pH in the acidic cellular compartment, we used two agents specifically alkalizing acidic cellular compartment [33,34] to enhance the
GFP emission. Soaking of gana-1::GFP transgenic animals
in NH4Cl or CON A resulted in a distinct GFP signal in a
vesicular compartment of endocytically active coelomocytes in a small proportion of worms (3–5% of population). The GFP signal intensity was dependent on the time
of incubation and the concentration of the alkalizing

agent used. The first visible GFP signal was observed after
8 hour incubation in 100 mM NH4Cl and within 2 hours
of incubation in 50 nM CON A. Lower concentrations of
both NH4Cl and CON A did not result in visible GFP signal even after prolonged incubation of up to 24 hours.
The reappearance of the GFP signal after treatment of the
worms with compounds increasing the acidic
compartment pH indirectly confirms lysosomal localization of the fusion protein. The GFP signal in coelomocytes
had the same coarsely granular pattern as that observed
after immunostaining.
Limited access of alkalizing agents to the tissues can
explain the differences between the results of immunofluorescence and alkalization studies.

Conclusions
Our findings showed that gana-1 is the only ortholog of
human α-NAGA and α-GAL in C. elegans. Based on
phylogenetic and homology modeling analyses we speculate that GANA-1 most probably developed from a hypothetical ancestral gene before the duplication event which
gave rise to separate α-NAGA and α-GAL genes.
We also speculate that gana-1 gene product has both αNAGA and α-GAL activities as detected in C. elegans
homogenates. Importantly, both activities in the worm
were inhibited by D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, which is a specific inhibitor of human α-NAGA
and does not inhibit α-GAL.
The GANA-1::GFP fusion protein had a pattern of distribution that is compatible with lysosomal subcellular
localization. The lysosomal localization of the fusion protein was also supported by pH sensitive fluorescence of
GFP that was detectable only after alkalization of the
acidic cellular compartment.

Not suprisingly, RNAi of gana-1 yielded no abnormal
morphological phenotypes, most likely because it did not
provide sufficient knockdown of enzymatic activities,
necessary for development of lysosomal storage as
observed in human pathology states. Nevertheless, gana-1
RNAi resulted in a partial decrease of both enzymatic
activities supporting the notion that this gene encodes
both of them.
It is possible that a deletion allele of gana-1 may provide
more insight into the function of gana-1 and efforts are
underway to isolate such alleles. Deletion alleles of
lysosomal hydrolases may serve as valuable models of
human lysosomal storage disorders.

of human lysosomal α-GAL and α-NAGA (acc. no.
NP_000160 and acc. no. NP_000253 [41]) were used as
query sequences.
cDNA amplification and sequencing
Total RNA was isolated from mixed stages of N2 cultures
[42] and reverse transcribed with an oligodT-T7 (5'AATACGACTCACTATAG) primer and Superscript reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). The entire coding region of
R07B7.11 was PCR amplified in two overlapping PCR
products, with intragenic primers designed according to
available Wormbase [15] and Worfdb [16] data. SL1
primer (5'GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG) and SL2
primer (5'GGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG) [17] together
with gene specific primer (5'ATCCTGATTAATTTTAATTGC) were used to amplify 942 bp of the 5' part of
the cDNA and to evaluate the mode of trans splicing; the
1142 bp fragment of the 3' end of cDNA was amplified
with T7 primer and a gene specific primer (5'CTTAAGTTTGGAATTTATGAA). The dominant PCR products were

cloned with TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) into the
pCR 2.1 vector. Positive clones were sequenced using the
Li-Cor automated fluorescent sequencer and sequences
were aligned with R07B7 reference cosmid sequence in
the AlignIR software (Li-Cor) to evaluate splicing boundaries and overall gene organization.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Confirmed or predicted amino acid sequences of melibiase family members [43] representing plant, unicellular,
and animal kingdoms were aligned using ClustalW algorithm [44] and Blosum62 matrix. The SwissProt/TrEMBL
[45] accesion code and source organism of the sequences
are depicted in Figure 2. The sequence alignment was used
for phylogenetic analysis with the software package
PHYLIP [46]. The phylogenetic tree is based on 100 bootstraped input alignments and was constructed by maximum likelihood method with Jones-Taylor-Thornton
matrix model [47]. Sequence identities between species
were calculated without signal sequence in EMBOSS by

penalty – 0.5 [8,48,49]. Signal peptides were predicted at
the SignalP server [50] both by algorithms using neural
networks and Hidden Markov Models. The results were
compared to known signal sequences. The differences
between signal peptides predicted by the algorithms are
depicted in Figure 2.
The 3D model of GANA-1 is based on the X-ray structure
of chicken α-NAGA, rice α-GAL and human α-GAL (PDB
codes 1ktcA, 1uas and 1r47, respectively) [7-9,51]. The
model was created using the automated homology modeling server SwissModel with structure refinement and
model evaluation in the DeepView program [52]. The
print quality figures (Figure 4) and animations (Additional file 1) were ray traced using PovRay software package [53].
Transgenic GFP expression
The entire coding region of the gana-1 gene, including 3
kb of its 5'upstream sequence, was amplified from N2
genomic DNA through a nested PCR reaction using
DyNAzyme EXT™ PCR system (Finnzymes) and two pairs
of primers: the external pair (5'GTGAGAGTGGGGAGATAGAA and 5'TCAATTTGCTTGAGGTACATA) and the
internal primers, with overhangs containing SphI and SalI
restriction sites respectively (5'ACATGCATGCAACTTTCACAGGAACACAAC
and
5'CGACGTCGACAATTGAACTCTATTGGTTCTCAA). The amplified DNA
fragment (4709 bp) was cloned using TOPO-XL cloning
kit (Invitrogen) into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector. The SphI
and SalI gana-1 restriction fragment was recloned into the
GFP reporter vector pPD95.67 (supplied by A. Fire, Stanford University). The in-frame nature of the insert was
confirmed by sequencing. The green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion construct pJH3 (50 ng/µl) and pRF4 plasmid (50 ng/µl) used as the dominant marker were coinjected into the gonads of young adult N2 worms. Transgenic animals were screened for GFP signal. Nikon Eclipse
E800 with C1 confocal module and 488 nm and 543 nm
lasers and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics
was used for specimen examination. EZ-C1 software
(Nikon) was used for picture analysis and 3D rendering
(Additional Files 1, 3).
Alkalization of acidic cell compartment
Mixed stage pJH3 and N2 (control) cultures were harvested from NGM OP50 plates and washed with water.
Worms were pelleted by centrifugation (max. 1000 RPM,
2 min.) between the washes. Worms were treated with
either one of two agents (NH4Cl, concanamycin A – CON
A) [33,34], that are known to specifically increase pH in
the cellular acidic compartment. For the NH4Cl method,
animals were suspended in 0, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mM
aqueous solutions of NH4Cl. Small aliquots of worms
were examined after 30 min, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/6/5

CON A, animals were suspended in 0, 10, 20, 50, 100,
150, 200 nM solutions of CON A in aqueous media.
Small aliquots of worms were examined after 1, 3, 6 and
24 hours.
Microscopical examination was performed as described
above.
Immunofluorescence
The fixation and immunofluorescence staining procedures were based on the approaches of Nonet et al. [54].
Mixed stage N2 cultures were harvested from NGM OP50
plates and washed thoroughly in M9 buffer to remove
intestinal bacteria. Worms were pelleted by centrifugation
(1000 RPM, 2 min.) between the washes. Worms were
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM
sodium/potassium phosphate buffer. Afterwards the
pellets were washed three times in 1 × PBS, and incubated
in 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 1% β-Mercaptoethanol overnight at 37°C to reduce the cuticle. After 5
washes in 1 × PBS, the worms were incubated for 5 hours
in 900 U/ml collagenase type IV (Sigma) diluted in KrebsRinger solution (119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 11.1
mM glucose, 1.6 mM CaCl2·H2O, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM
KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.4). The reduction/
digestion step was performed twice. Pellets were washed 3
times with 1 × PBS and stored for further processing in
AbA buffer (1 × PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 0.05%
NaN3). AbA buffer was used for antibody dilution. Primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP IgG (Abcam))
was diluted 1:500. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit
IgG Alexa Fluor 488 labeled (Molecular Probes)) was
diluted 1:1000. Both incubations were performed overnight at room temperature, with AbB buffer (1 × PBS,
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% NaN3) washes in
between.

Nuclei were counterstained with SYTOX orange (Molecular Probes) and the microscopic evaluation was performed as described above.
Western Blotting
Mixed stage pJH3 and N2 cultures were harvested from
NGM OP50 plates. Worms were homogenized by
sonication and the concentration of protein was measured by the Hartree method [55]. The proteins (equivalent
of 25–50 µg of protein per lane) were separated by SDSPAGE gradient gel (4% to 20% polyacrylamide) and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry
blotting. The membrane was treated according to a common Western blotting protocol with chemiluminiscence
detection (SuperSignal, West Pico) [56]. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP IgG (Abcam, dilution 1:5000) was used as
the primary antibody, the secondary antibody was goat
anti-rabbit IgG/Px (Pierce, diluted 1:20 000).

RNA mediated interference
The PCR product containing the entire gana-1 cDNA was
cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and L4440
double promoter vector for microinjection and feeding
RNAi respectively. In-vitro transcription employing T7
and SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega) was used to generate antisense single stranded RNA molecules, which were
annealed to generate double stranded RNA (dsRNA).
dsRNA was microinjected into N2 worms which were fed
on HT115 [26]E. coli strain carrying L4440 plasmid with
gana-1 insert. The F1 and early F2 progeny was screened for
morphological phenotypes. N2 worms microinjected
with water and fed on HT115 E. coli transformed with
L4440 vector without insert were used as a control. 5–7
worms were microinjected both with dsRNA and water in
each of 4 separate experiments, single worm progeny
reaching 110–150 individuals.
Determination of α-GAL and α-NAGA and βhexosaminidase activities
Prior to all activity measurements worms were washed
from culture plates and repeatedly (6 times) washed and
centrifuged in M9 buffer and finally pelleted by centrifugation. 4-methylumbelliferyl (MU)-α-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide (1 mM), 4-MU-α-D-galactopyranoside and 4MU-β-D-glucopyranoside in theMcIlvaine buffer (0.1 M
citrate/0.2 M phosphate buffer at acidic pH) were used as
enzyme substrates. Reaction mixtures (sample and
enzyme substrate) were incubated at 37°C and reactions
were stopped by 600 µl of 0.2 M glycine/ NaOH buffer
(pH 10.6) [13,57]. Fluorescence signal of the 4-methylumbelliferone was measured on the luminiscence spectrofotometer LS 50B (Perkin Elmer) (emission 365 nm
and excitation 448 nm). Inhibitors (N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, D-galactose and D-glucose) were used in 0.1 M
final concentration. All measurements were performed in
doublets.
