Human bocavirus (HBoV) in children with
respiratory tract infection by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qualitative
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Mona Z Zaghloul

Abstract
Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with mild to severe lower
respiratory tract infections in children, the aim of the work was determination of human bocavirus in
nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR and determination of acute human bocavirus infection
by estimation of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the patients with respiratory manifestations were
positive for HBoV by qualitative PCR, while ELISA revealed positive HBoV IgM antibodies in 18 (18%) patients who
were also positive by PCR. Non of the controls were positive by both techniques. The correlation study between
ELISA and PCR revealed high significant association, (p < 0.001, X2 = 36 and agreement = 96%). Also PCR detected
4 (18.1%) NPA samples as HBoV positive cases among the patients that were not identified by ELISA. This could be
due to high sensitivity and efficacy of PCR. ELISA being less sensitive than RT-PCR, sensitivity was (81.8% vs 100%),
the efficacy was 97.7% in ELISA versus 99.7% for RT-PCR.
Conclusion: HBoV infections could be diagnosed in NPA of children by conventional PCR as a rapid and sensitive
technique. While ELISA was a reliable serologic analysis for diagnosis of acute HBoV infection by estimation IgM
antibodies in serum.

Background
In 2005, Allander et al., [1] reported the discovery of a previously undescribed human parvovirus in respiratory secretions from children with respiratory tract disease in
Sweden. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus
belonged to the genus Bocavirus (subfamily, Parvovirinae;
family, Parvoviridae) and was most closely related to bovine
parvovirus (BP) and minute virus of canines (MVC). The
virus was thus named “human bocavirus” (HBoV).
Human bocaviruses (HBoV) contain 3 open reading
frames (ORFs) encoding a nonstructural protein (NS1,
NP1) and two capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively
[2]. The genomic organization of HBoV closely resembles
that of bovine parvovirus type 1 [1].

HBoV has been reported in respiratory samples from
children with acute respiratory tract disease in various
parts of the world (including Australia, North America,
Europe, Asia, and Africa), suggesting that the virus is
circulating worldwide [3]. Pneumonia, acute bronchitis,
bronchiolitis, are the main manifestations of HBoV
infection [4].
HBoV seems to be a new member of the communityacquired respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial
virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and
rhinovirus, which cause common respiratory tract infections in the community [5]. Because of its very high copy
numbers in respiratory tract secretions, aerosol and contact transmission are likely effective, as they are for other
respiratory viruses [6].
HBoV has been detected also in nasopharyngeal,
serum, fecal and urine samples obtained mainly from
young children around the age of 2 years predominantly

during the winter season [1]. HBoV was detected in two
pediatric patients after organ transplantation [7], in
human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric
patients [8], and immunosuppressed adult patients [9].
Diagnosis of HBoV infection is based on the PCR
amplification of viral genome fragments present in
human respiratory, serum, stool and urine samples. A
great number of different PCR techniques employing
varying sets of primers specific for the viral genes NP1
[10], NS1 [11], and VP1, VP2 [12,13] have been
described. In addition to the detection of viral genomes
by PCR, recent reports describe the detection of HBoVspecific IgG and IgM-antibodies against HBoV VP2 in
serum samples using western blot [14] or immunofluorescence assays [2,15]. Furthermore, a standardized
ELISA for the quantitative determination of HBoV-specific antibodies has been established by [16]. The aim of
the work was determination of HBoV in respiratory specimens (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR and determination of acute HBoV infection by estimation of IgM
antibodies in serum by ELISA.

Results
Microbiological results

Cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates from 100 patients
were positive in 67% of patients. Cultures yielded
growth of one or more pathogen among upper respiratory tract normal flora. Gram positive cocci were isolated from 57/90 (63.3%) of specimens including:
Streptococcus pneumoniae 25/90 (27.7%), Staphylococcus
aureus 32/90 (35.5%). Gram negative bacilli were
detected in 33/90(36.6%) of specimens including, Klebsiella pneumoniae 15/90 (16.6%), Escherichia coli 10/90
(11.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8/90 (8.8%), while
Cultures of the control group showed growth of upper
respiratory tract normal flora (table 1).
Qualitative PCR results

Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the
patients were positive for HBoV and 78 (78%) specimens
were negative by qualitative PCR. While all the 50 NPA
of the control group were negative for HBoV. Also there

was a high significant difference between the patient and
the control groups since p < 0.001 (table 2).
ELISA results

Eighteen (18%) out of the 100 serum samples of the
patients with respiratory tract manifestations were positive for HBoV IgM antibodies by ELISA such patients
are also positive by PCR, and 82 (82%) specimens were
HBoV negative by ELISA. While all 50 serum samples
of the controls were negative (table 3). Serum concentration of IgM antibodies against HBoV were detected
significantly in patients (0.28 ± 0.06 vs 0.07 ± 0.01 controls), p < 0.001. Table 4 showed the number of positive
cases by the different diagnostic methods. Table 5
showed that there was a highly significant association
between the PCR and ELISA techniques.
Diagnostic validity tests

Diagnostic validity test including sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values and efficacy of both HBoV ELISA and
PCR were calculated (table 6 and 7) considering PCR as
a reference method. In our work we found ELISA to be
less sensitive than PCR, it was (81.8% vs 100%), but the
specificity of ELISA is higher than PCR, it was (100% vs
78%) (table 6 and 7).

Discussion
In recent years, several novel viruses have been discovered in patients with respiratory infections using molecular biology methods. These novel viruses include the
human metapneumovirus and several coronaviruses
(SARS, NL63, and HKU1) [17,18] the latest addition to
this list was the human bocavirus (HBoV).
Attempts to culture this virus on conventional cell
lines had failed but, Dijkman et al., [19] had investigated
whether the virus can replicate on pseudostratified
human airway epithelium. The cells were inoculated
with human bocavirus-positive nasopharyngeal washes
from children, and virus replication was monitored by
measuring apical release of the virus via real-time PCR.
Electron Microscopy supported the ultrastructure analysis of the HBoV virus like particles (VLP) using a

In our work 22 (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of
the patients were positive for HBoV, There was a high
significant difference between the patient and the control
groups (p < 0.001). PCR detected four HBoV positive
cases that were negative by ELISA, this could be
explained by the high sensitivity of PCR over ELISA since
it was (100% vs 81.1%) respectively. Weissbrich et al., [21]
had found HBoV DNA in (10.3%) of NPA samples
obtained from 786 hospitalized infants and children with
febrile respiratory tract diseases during the years 2002 to
2005 in the region of northern Bavaria in Germany.
While Neske et al., [22] had studied 834 nasopharyngeal
aspirates (NPA), 10 serum samples, and 31 stool samples
of children with acute respiratory diseases. For phylogenetic analysis, the VP2 genes were sequenced from 69
HBoV-positive NPA samples. The qualitative results of
the real-time HBoV PCR were in good agreement with a
conventional HBoV PCR. They found that 12% of the
NPA were positive for HBoV DNA by both techniques.
Söderlund-Venermo et al., [23] reported that the unique
region in VP1 is less immunogenic than the major virus
capsid protein VP2, Also he expressed HBoV VP2 viral
like particles (VLPs) in insect cells for use in IgM and IgG
ELISA that are superior to immunoblots in diagnostic
performance.
In the present study 18 (18%) out of the 100 serum samples of the patients with respiratory tract manifestations
were positive for HBoV IgM antibodies by ELISA. There
was a significant difference between the patient and the
control group (p < 0.001). The mean serum concentration
of IgM antibodies against HBoV, in the two groups was
(0.28 ± 0.06 vs 0.07 ± 0.01). There was also a highly significant association between PCR and ELISA techniques (p <
0.001 and agreement = 96%). Söderlund-Venermo et al.,

[23] diagnosed acute primary HBoV infections in 49 (19%)
of 258 children with expiratory wheezing, and Lindner et
al., [24] detected IgM against HBoV by ELISA in 10/24
(42%) of sera samples obtained from HBoV DNA-positive
children and infants with infections of the respiratory
tract.
In the present study sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and efficacy of ELISA were
81.8%,100%,100% and 97.7% respectively Lindner et al.,
[16] had reported diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of
their antibody ELISA were as high as 97% and 99.5%,
respectively; positive predictive value was 97% by using
ELISA among wheezing children.

Conclusion
HBoV infections could be diagnosed in NPA by conventional PCR as a rapid and sensitive technique. ELISA
was a reliable serologic analysis for diagnosis of acute
HBoV infection by estimation IgM antibodies in serum.
Methods
The present case - control study was conducted on 100
patients aged from 1 to 5 years (61 males and 39
females) with a mean ± SD age of (2.7 ± 1.1) attending
the Pediatric outpatient clinic, Ain Shams University
Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt in the period from September
2009 to May 2010. Patients were suffering from lower
respiratory tract infection together with upper respiratory tract manifestations such as cough, running nose
and fever. In addition to 50 apparently healthy children
(32 males and 18 females) matched in age with the
patients as a control group.
All patients were subjected to the following after their
written consent, full history taking and thorough clinical
examination, complete blood picture, chest plain X-ray.

both patient and control groups were subjected to
microbiological examination and qualitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for detection HBoV. Serum samples were collected from both patient and control
groups for detection of HBoV- IgM antibodies by
ELISA.
Sample collection

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients
and control group according to Svensson et al., [25]. Sterile normal saline solution was instilled in one nostril
while occluding the other nostril, using a sterile blunttipped disposable syringe. Then the patient was
instructed to forcibly exhale through the lavaged side
into a sterile specimen cup. The sequence was then
repeated in the other side of the nose. NPA specimens
were examined microbiologically immediately and part of
the specimens was stored in aliquots at -70°C for PCR.
Two ml blood samples from both patients and control
were collected into vacutainer, centrifuged and serum
was separated and stored at - 20°C for HBoV-IgM antibodies by ELISA.
Microbiological examination

It was done by Gram stained smear for detection of pus
cells and microorganisms. Quantitative culture of NPA
specimens of patients and control was done. Undiluted
and tenfold serial dilutions were inoculated with a calibrated loop on chocolate agar, blood agar and MacConkey agar plates, after over night incubation in
appropriate conditions, Quantitative NPA cultures were
considered positive when the growth of 106 (cfu/ml) or
more was observed [26].
Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

DNA was extracted from 200 μl of the NPA samples
using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the instructions of
the manufacturer.

Amplification of hBoV DNA was performed using 50
μl elution volume with the NP-1 primers BoV188F and
BoV542R described by Allander et al., [1] (table 8) using
the HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR reactions were carried out in a 50 μl
volume consisting of 5 μl extracted DNA, 1× Qiagen
HotStar buffer, dNTPs at a final concentration of 200
μM each, 200 pmol of each primer, and 1.5 U of Taq
Polymerase. The cycling conditions were 50 cycles (94°C
30 s, 53°C 40 s and 1 min at 72°C) after a preheating
step of 10 min at 95°C.
After amplification, PCR products were visualized by
staining with ethidium bromide on agarose gels. A PCR
reaction was considered as positive when a band of the
expected size (354 base pairs) was visible.
A plasmid containing the PCR product cloned in the
vector PCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) was used as positive
control.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

HBoV-IgM antibodies were determined by a commercially
available immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay supplied by (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
for the quantitative determination of IgM antibodies to
HBoV in serum. Briefly: serum samples diluted 1:200 in
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and 0.05% Tween (PBST)
were applied in duplicate into wells of plates coated with
goat anti-human IgM for 60 min at room temperature.
After being rinsed 5 times with PBST, biotinylated HBoV
viral like particles (VLPs) were applied at a concentration
of 25 ng/well and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. Bound
antigen was visualized by using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated streptavidin at 1:12,000 in PBST plus 0.5%
bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37°C, followed by ophenylenediamine dihydrochloride and H2O2 for 15 min
at 37°C. The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 0.5 M
H2SO4, and the absorbance at 492 nm were recorded. Cut
off absorbance for negative and positive IgM ELISA results
were 0.136 and 0.167, respectively.
