Abstract
Background: In the EU conventional cages for laying hens are forbidden beginning in January 2012, however
concerns about a higher transmission rate of Salmonella in alternative cages systems have been raised. The extent
to which cage systems may affect the intestinal microbiota of laying hens is not known, and different microbiota
may demonstrate different resistance towards colonization with Salmonella. To investigate this, ileal and caecal
samples from two experimental studies where laying hens were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis and housed
in different systems (conventional cage, furnished cage or aviary), were compared using Terminal Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP). The distribution of genera in the microbiota in caecum was furthermore
described by next generation sequencing of 16S rDNA libraries.
Results: Hens in the same cage type developed similar T-RFLP fingerprints of the ileal and caecal microbiota, and
these could be separated from layers in the other cages types. No significant difference in the fingerprint profiles
could be observed between Salmonella positive and negative samples from same cage. By deep sequencing of
16S rDNA libraries from caecum, 197 different Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) were identified, and 195 and 196
OTU respectively, were found in hens in aviary and furnished cages, but only 178 OTU of these were recovered
from conventional cages. The ratio between the dominating phyla or families and genera in the microbiota
remained fairly constant throughout the study. Faecalibacterium and Butyricimonas were the most prevalent genera
found in the caecal microbiota of layers irrespective of the cage type.
Conclusions: Hens confined in the same cage group tend to develop similar microbiota in their ileum and
caecum possibly due to isolation, while differences in the microbiota between cages may be caused by
environmental or individual bird factors. Although the cages type had influence on composition of the microbiota
in the layers by promoting higher diversity in furnished and aviary systems, we did not observe differences in
colonization and excretion pattern of Salmonella from these groups. We suggest, that differences in group size and
exposure to a more faecally contaminated environment in the alternative systems may explain the observed
differences in diversity of the caecal microbiota.

Background
Due to animal welfare considerations the EU has
banned the use of conventional cages (CC) for laying
hens from 2012, and alternative systems such as furnished cage systems (FC), floor systems or aviaries (AV)

have been proposed to replace these [1]. Traditionally,
hens have been housed in minor cages with groups of
4-6 individuals, and the alternative systems are based on
larger groups of more than 60 hens. In these cages
layers are provided more space and facilities for natural
behaviour, however a more aggressive nature among the
laying hens has been observed [2], and environmental
problems with a higher bacterial contamination level
have also been noted [1]. This has led to concerns about

an increased risk of transmission of Salmonella to
humans due to a general higher level of microbial contamination of the shell of eggs derived from hens
housed in alternative housing systems [3]. It is not
known whether the combination of larger group sizes
and social stress may increase the susceptibility to colonization by Salmonella. Stressing laying hens by feed
withdrawal is a traditional method to induce molting,
and in several studies this have resulted in an increase
in the susceptibility towards colonization by Salmonella
[4,5]. The mechanism behind this is not well understood, but the starvation may affect the balance between
different microbial populations in the intestinal microbiota [5-7], as a reduction in diversity is observed which
may lower the natural competitive barrier [5].
In the investigations of the dynamics in the intestinal
microbiota, molecular methods have superseded conventional culture methods due to an increased sensitivity,
and have become powerful tools. Terminal Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) have been
used to describe variations and diversity of the microbiota in the intestinal tract in broilers [8-10]. However,
when it comes elucidate the phylogenetic diversity in
the intestinal microbiota at species level, these methods
are not sensitive and specific enough. By traditional culture methods only culturable genera are detected, and
these are estimated to be about 1% of all genera present
in the microbiota [11], whereas DGGE only detects species that represent more than 1% of the total microbiota
[12], and in T-RFLP, sequence redundancy at the cleaving side may generate fragments of the same length
from various species. A more comprehensive description
of the distribution of species in the microbiota can be
done by Sanger sequencing of 16S rDNA libraries. With
this method individual species are arranged into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) based on > 98% similarity of 16S rDNA sequences [8,13], but as these methods
are very laborious, only the most dominating species are
detected. A much deeper investigation of the microbiota
has been achieved with the introduction of second generation sequencing technology, such as 454 pyrosequencing, where massive parallel sequencing of short hyper
variable regions within the 16S rDNA is performed
[14-16]. Using this technology, a 16S rDNA library may
be sequenced in one run; generating a large number of
sequence reads that allows a much deeper insight in the
distribution of species. Although the generated
sequences do not cover the whole gene, Huse et al. [17]
were able to achieve a 99% correlation of identification,
when compared with full length sequencing of a library
from the human microbiota.
The microbiota of laying hens experiencing nutritional
stress has been investigated by 454 pyrosequencing [5].

In this study, the authors described the changes in the
microbiota induced by different molting methods, where
hens were given different feed or being starved. By starving the layers, they observed a decrease in species
diversity of the caecal microbiota which was not found
in hens receiving a diet with high fiber content. With
the change to more welfare friendly cage systems, laying
hens are now going to be housed in larger groups of 60
birds, rather than 4-6 birds as seen in conventional battery cages. Whether these changes in group size,
increased contact between individuals or change in
behavior may also have influence on the diversity of the
species in the intestinal tract or in the oviduct, have not
been investigated. Using molecular methods as T-RFLP
and next generation sequencing, the aim of this study
was to describe the effect of the housing system on the
distribution of the dominating bacterial species in the
intestinal microbiota in laying hens housed in different
cage systems before and after inoculation with Salmonella Enteritidis.

Results
T-RFLP analysis of the impact of cage type on intestinal
microbiota

The microbiota in ileal and caecal samples from the first
experiment were characterised by creating individual TRFLP fingerprint profiles for each sample. Profiles were
generated on the basis of the number of Terminal
Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) in the range of 60 - 850
bp. The relationship between two profiles could then be
calculated by pair wise comparisons as a Dice similarity
coefficient (SD), however to compensate for the variation
between individual comparisons, the mean of the S D
values was calculated and used to compare cage groups.
The Dice coefficients from the first experimental study
are shown in Table 1. In ileum, the highest Dice score
was found between samples within same cage, and especially CC and AV diverged clearly from each other (SD
54.3 ± 9.6) with FC being in between, sharing profiles
with both the other cages (CC S D 67.4 ± 9.9 and AV
66.8 ± 11.4). When sampling was done 4 weeks later,
higher S D values were calculated within cage, while
values between cages were in the range 65.5-67.5. This
shows that layers sharing the same environment also
had comparable ileal microbiota, and this similarity
increased over time. The height of the T-RF peaks
reflected the prevalence of individual species in the
microbiota. Ileum was characterized by having the same
3-4 dominating T-RFs in all cage groups, but other individual T-RFs were also present. Before inoculation 10.5
± 1.7 different T-RFs were detected in CC, while FC
had 6.5 ± 2.7 and AV 7.3 ± 3.5. These were maintained
throughout the study, although an increase was found in
AV (10.7 ± 2.7). The four most dominating T-RFs in all

samples were 393 bp, 406 bp, 597 bp, and 550 bp. These
T-RFLP fragments could be equated with by different
Lactobacillus species by in silico digest of 16S rDNA.
Although the total number of detectable T-RFs
remained constant in the ileum, an inverted relationship
was found between one group of T-RFs: 406 bp, 606 bp
and 550 bp which decreased in height, whereas as a new
and unidentified T-RF 813 bp emerged. This shift was
primarily found in layers from FC and a few layers from
other cages, and this may explain some of the differences observed in SD between cages.
The T-RFLP profiles from the caecum contained a
higher number of T-RFs reflecting a much more complex
microbiota than in the ileum, and an increase in the
amount of T-RFs was observed in all caecal microbiota
over time (Table 1). The majority of the dominating TRFs were shared by all cage groups, however cages specific differences among the minor T-RFs were observed.
Samples from CC and FC were more uniform, whereas a
large variation between the profiles was observed in AV
on the first sampling day (S D 45.4 ± 14), however the
profiles were more uniform on the second sampling 4
weeks later (AV 74.2 ± 4.9). The SD values were higher
within the same group than between cage groups, and an
increase in S D over time was observed, in accordance
with the findings from the ileum.
To test whether the differences in profiles between
cages were caused by a specific cage factor or merely a
reflection of isolation between cages, we included

samples from the second experimental study [18]. Apart
from one T-RF (550 bp.), all dominating T-RFs in the
ileum from the first trial were also present in a second
study. The major groups of T-RFs in the caecal samples
were similar between experiments; however some fragment were only found in one of the experiments. To
test for common cage factors, profiles from the caecum
were compared by Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
(Figure 1). A clear clustering of samples from the same
experiment and cage system was observed. By the first
principal component (X = 20.7%) all caecal T-RFLP profiles were clearly separated in two groups according to
sampling day and experiment, thus showing that the
highest variance was caused by differences between the
two experiments. The second component (Y = 10.1%)
separated each experiment into three clusters each containing profiles from same cage system. In both studies
CC samples were most different from AV, with FV samples clustering in between. Samples collected before
inoculation did not cluster as clearly as samples taken at
the end of the study. An indication of a common cage
factor was observed by the Y component, where samples
from the same cages in both experiments were influenced similarly by this component. The PCA showed
that especially T-RF 393 was more prevalent in samples
from CC, while T-RF 102 was more frequently found in
AV. It is likely that the first fragment may represent a
Lactobacillus spp., while no specific genera could be
identified for the other fragment, as several different

genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella or Porphyromonas) may
be represented by this T-RF.
T-RFLP analysis of the impact of Salmonella on the
intestinal microbiota

The impact of an inoculation with S. Enteritidis on
intestinal microbiota was also evaluated. After inoculation, no clinical signs of infection were detected in the
layers. However, colonisation of the intestinal microbiota
was established, and S. Enteritidis could be detected in
samples from internal organs as well as in cloacal swabs
[18,19]. At the end of both studies, Salmonella was found
in a few layers by culture and PCR. In the ileal samples,
Salmonella was detected in 2/8 from AV by PCR, while
other samples were negative. In the caecum, S. Enteritidis
could be cultured in 2/8 samples from AV, 3/8 from both
FC and CC. The concentration of S. Enteritidis in the
positive samples was generally low, as culture positive
samples not always were positive by real-time PCR. TRFLP profiles of intestinal microbiota positive for S.
Enteritidis were compared with profiles where it had
been eliminated. On the basis of the mean SD values calculated between Salmonella negative and positive samples from the same cage, no differences could be
detected between positive and negative samples within
same cage (data not shown). When profiles were analysed
by PCA, no discrimination was found between positive or
negative samples within the same cages (Figure 1).
454 sequencing of the caecal microbiota

The microbiota in the caecal samples from the first
experiment were further characterized by 454

pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA gene libraries. Due to the
high sample similarity observed in the T-RFLP analysis,
we pooled the DNA from 10 cage mates and used this
as template for 454 pyrosequencing. In total six samples
were generated, one for each cage type before and after
inoculation with Salmonella. From each sample,
between 20,000 and 50,000 sequence reads could be
used for analysis (Table 2). On the basis of 99% similarity these reads were sorted into OTUs. The amount of
reads in each OTU varied greatly ranging from more
than 14,000 to single reads, thus reflecting the prevalence in the microbiota. Due to differences in the
amount of sequence reads obtained from individual
samples, the relative distribution of sequences was calculated on the basis of the total number of reads from
the sample. OTUs that accounted for > 1% of the total
number of sequences were considered as dominant
species.
In total, 197 different OTUs were identified, and 196
and 195, respectively, out of these were found in noninoculated samples from AV and FC, however, for CC a
progressive decrease in numbers of OTUs was observed
in both samples before and after inoculation with Salmonella. In these cages, 185 OTUs were identified
before inoculation and 178 OTUs four weeks after
inoculation, while in the other cages 193 OTUs were
detected at the end of the experiment. Due to a different
number of reads obtained from each sample, normalized
prevalence values of each OTU were calculated. Using a
cut-off value of 0.01%, the difference in diversity
between cages was still observed where the dominating
genera in CC constituted a larger proportion of the

microbiota at the expense of fewer OTU’s, compared to
the two other cages (Figure 2).
The consensus sequence from each OTU was compared against the Ribosomal Database (RDP server) to
find the most related species or genus. Though many of
the bacterial species in the caecal microbiota still remain
to be characterized, it was possible to classify 92% of all
OTUs to phylum level, and out of these were 86% classified to class level and 55% to genus level. Although
variation was observed in the relative presence that
colonized the caecum, it was the same group of genera
that were dominating in all cages before and after
inoculation, accounting for more than 74% of the total
amount of reads (Table 3). The caecal microbiota from
all cages was dominated by two phyla: Bacteroidetes and

Firmicutes, with Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and Deferribacteres also being represented, but
only in low numbers. The dominating classes were Bacteroidia and Clostridia (Figure 3), and within these
classes were Butyricimonas spp. and Faecalibacterium
spp. the most dominating genera. Based on identified
OTU’s, a ratio between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
was calculated (Table 2). All samples had a relatively
high number of Bacteroidetes, with the exception of CC
where a drop was observed in samples collected 4 weeks
post infection (PI).

studies previously reported by De Vylder et al. [18,19]
have been further characterised using T-RFLP and 454
pyrosequencing. We found that individuals living in the
same environment also tend to develop similar microbiota.
Despite of being raised in the same environment and likely
having similar microbiota to begin with, we found, that
when hens were transferred to different cages types (conventional cages, furnished cages or aviary) for 2 weeks,
minor but uniform changes in the T-RFLP profiles of the
microbiota in ileum and caecum occurred. By comparing
T-RFLP fingerprints from individual hens, we found highly

similar ileal and caecal profiles in hens from same cage,
which could be discriminated from other cages in the
same experiment. However, the differences were not cage
type specific, as when samples from two independent
experiments were compared by PCA, the largest component were observed between experiments, meaning that
cage type only had minor influence on the variance. This
indicates that the intestinal microbiota may be influenced
on the contact to the surrounding microbiological environment in the cage.
The differences in the evolution of the microbiota
were further analysed by deep sequencing of 16S rDNA

laying hens were moved from a floor system and into
conventional cages, their caecal microbiota changed
towards a less diverse microbiota compared to hens
from the same flock that were allocated to aviary and
furnished cages. Sequencing of rDNA libraries revealed
that hens housed in conventional cages showed a progressive decrease in the number of different OTUs in
their caecal microbiota, compared to hens housed in
aviary or furnished cages. The decline was already
observed after 2 weeks in the cage, and it was even
more pronounced after 4 weeks. The same reduction
was not observed in the other cage systems. The OTUs
that were not recovered in conventional cages were all
represented in the other cages, however in low numbers
reflecting that they belong to the group of less abundant
species. As each OTU represents unique genera or even
species, this reflects an overall decrease in diversity of
their caecal microbiota towards fewer and more dominating species. Alternative cage systems are characterized by having larger cages due to flock sizes and
facilities for enhancing natural behaviour. These facilities
may, however, hinder the removal of manure compared
to conventional cages, and an overall higher bacterial
level has been noted in these systems [1]. It is likely that
the laying hens housed in a more contaminated environment, as in the alternative systems, may be more
exposed to faeces from the other layers, and thereby
continuously being reinoculated, thereby maintaining a
higher species variety in the microbiota.

The vast amount of sequence reads generated from
each sample by 454 pyrosequencing allowed quantification of the individual OTU in relation to the total flora.
Only minor differences were observed in the relative
distribution of phyla and classes of bacteria in the caecal
microbiota between cages, but quantitative variations
that were not cage specific were observed between different genera. However, when OTUs were grouped
according to phyla and classes, comparable groups were
found in all samples. This indicates that the cage system
itself did not influence the balance between the large
classes, but pinpoints the caecal microbiota as a
dynamic, highly competitive organ where a decrease in
one genus may be compensated by an increase in a closely related species, or other species belonging to the
same functional guild that shares the same requirement
for substrates.
When the consensus sequences from 197 OTUs were
aligned with the RDP database, more than 91% were
identifiable at least to phylum level, and more than 55%
could be identified to genus level. The most prevalent
phyla in the caecal microbiota were Bacteroidetes, with
Firmicutes being the second most prevalent. The ratios
between these two phyla (F/B) remained fairly equal
between the CC and AC, but a decrease was observed
for CC. A major reason for this difference was promoted
by a shift from Faecalibacterium to Butyricimonas.
Whether this change was mediated by the cage system
of a coincidence remains to be established, but we did
not find that it changed the susceptibility for Salmonella, probably because both species produces butyric
acid. There are indications that the feed may have large
influence the F/B ratio. In domestic and wild turkeys,
Scupham et al. [20] found similar ratios between these
phyla; however this is in contrast to the caecal microbiota found in broilers. In a number of studies
[8,13,21,22], the microbiota in broilers were heavily
dominated by Firmicutes, with Bacteroidetes only present at much lower level. An explanation for this may
be the different feeding strategies that are used. Broilers
are normally fed a high energy diet that sustains fast
growth, which possibly leaves more digestible nutrients
for the intestinal microbiota. In contrast, laying hens are
fed a much more restricted diet containing less energy
and higher amounts of digestive fibers, which instead
may favour genera from Bacteroidetes. The same phenomena has been described for the microbiota in obese
humans, where Ley et al. [23] observed an increase in
Bacteroidetes during long term restricted diet.
The two most dominating genera found in this study
were Faecalibacterium and Butyricimonas constituting
more than one third of the total microbiota in all
sequenced caecal samples. The first species is a well
known colonizer of the caecal microbiota of poultry;

Nordentoft et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/187

however Butyricimonas has just recently been described
in rats [24], and has to our knowledge not been
described in poultry before. Both bacteria are important
contributors to the production of butyric acid in the
lower intestine, and may represent an important functional guild in the microbiota. Studies have shown that
especially butyric acid may have a prominent role in the
reduction of invasion [25], and colonization of Salmonella in the caecal microbiota [26]. Butyricimonas was
the most dominant genus in caecum samples from conventional cages, but this difference was not reflected in
any variations found in the colonization level of S.
Enteritidis as reported by De Vylder et al. [19], who
found no difference in excretion level and time between
cage systems.
We did not find evidence that the introduction of S.
Enteritidis to the intestinal microbiota were able to change
the species diversity in ileum or caecum. When individual
T-RFLP profiles from Salmonella positive layers were
compared with cage mates that had cleared the infection
no differences were observed. When comparing the distribution of OTU in each group before and after inoculation,
the balance between different classes and genera were also
maintained throughout the study. The low impact on the
intestinal microbiota may be explained by the fact that
inoculation only induced a subclinical infection, in contrast to experimental studies where a more profound disturbance of the microbiota has been observed in cases
where diarrhoea has followed infection [27,28].
In the early studies of Nurmi and Rantala [29], it was
shown that a highly diverse intestinal microbiota in
broilers is one of the best barriers towards colonization
with Salmonella (competitive exclusion). However, we
did not find that decreased diversity in the layers had a
significant impact on the colonization and elimination
of Salmonella. It is likely that this colonisation resistance is highly important in broilers where a mature
flora has not been established yet, but in layers this may
not be as important. Furthermore, in the second inoculation study where seeder birds were housed together
with non-infected birds, De Vylder et al. [18] found that
the transmission of S. Enteritidis was higher among
hens housed in aviary or floor system than in conventional and furnished cages. A likely explanation for our
observation is that direct contact to faecal material from
infected hens is very important for the transmission of
S. Enteritidis in a flock, and that the higher species
diversity found in layers with more contact with faecal
material does not prevent colonization, but keeps it at a
relatively low level.

Conclusions
In the present study, we have compared the intestinal
microbiota in layers from different housing systems

Page 8 of 11

under experimental conditions. When laying hens were
housed in conventional cages, a change was observed in
their caecal microbiota towards a less diverse flora, with
the most prevalent genera being more dominating compared to aviary and furnished cage. This decrease in
diversity did not have an impact on the elimination of
Salmonella, and moreover the higher diversity found in
aviary systems did not protect laying hens from being
infected. We did not find evidence, that the cage systems itself was able to change the intestinal microbiota
in a way which made it more sensible towards colonization with Salmonella, but it highlights that hygiene in
alternative systems is a particularly critical factor for
preventing the spread of Salmonella within a flock.

Methods
Samples for analysis

Intestinal content samples from ileum and caecum were
received from two experimental infection studies previously described by De Vylder et al. [18,19]. Briefly, in the
first experiment 16 week old laying hens raised in a floor
systems, were allocated into three different cage conditions
(conventional, furnished and aviary cage system). After 2
weeks of accommodation were all hens inoculated with
1.5 × 108 CFU of a nalidixic acid resistant S. Enteritidis PT
4 strain (76Sa88), which previously had been isolated from
an outbreak of salmonellosis in laying hens [30] chain fatty
acid). The development of the infection was followed by
conventional culture methods until the slaughter 4 weeks
later. Samples for microbiota composition analysis were
collected prior to inoculation (Week 18) and at the 4
weeks (Week 22) post infection (PI).
In the second experiment 16 week old laying hens
raised in a floor systems, were accommodated for two
weeks in one isolation unit (floor system) to adjust to
their new environment. Then the flock was randomly
divided in two groups, and one hundred and twenty-six
non-inoculated contact animals were housed in 3 different housing systems; (1) 36 hens in battery cages, (2) 30
hens in a furnished cage, (3) 30 hens in an aviary. The
remaining one hundred and twenty-six hens, called seeder-hens, stayed on the floor and were individually
inoculated orally with 10 9 CFU of the same nalidixic
acid resistant Salmonella Enteritidis strain. At day 22
post-infection, the seeder hens were randomly divided
into four groups and housed together with the noninfected contact hens in the different housing systems
such that in each housing system fifty percent seeders
and fifty percent contact animals were present. Samples
of ileal and caecal content were collected for analysis of
the microbiota at the end of the experiment 4 weeks
later. Al experiments were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Ghent University.

Extraction of DNA

During necropsy of layers, samples were collected from
the ileum and caecum. The gut samples were stored by
diluting 1 g with 3 ml of 98% ethanol and kept at 4°C
until purification, where the ethanol was removed by
washing twice with 1 ml of Buffered Peptone Water
(Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Oviduct samples were stored
at -20°C until preparation, where surface samples from
these organs were collected by scraping the mucosal lining after gentle thawing. Two hundred milligrams of gut
contents (ileum and caecum) or oviduct were used for
total DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Stool
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) system. The extraction was carried out in accordance with the instructions
of the manufacturer, with an additional step of lysozyme
treatment, which was added to the procedure before the
use of InhibitEX tablets provided in the QIAamp DNA
Stool Mini Kit. After incubation of the sample in ASL
buffer at 95°C for 5 min, 140 μL of a 10 mg/ml solution
of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, Brøndby, Denmark) in
Tris-EDTA buffer (10:1 mM), pH 8, was added to each
extraction tube and samples were incubated at 37°C for
30 min. The purified DNA was eluted in 200 ml buffer
AE (Qiagen) and DNA was stabilized by adding 4 μL of
a 50 mg/ml BSA solution (Ultrapure BSA, Ambion,
Applied Biosystems, Naerum, Denmark, cat. no. 2616)
and 2 μL of Ribonuclease-A (Sigma-Aldrich, R-4642).
The purity and concentration of DNA was measured
using NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington,
Delaware, USA). All samples were stored as concentrated samples at -20°C until use. Samples were diluted
to a concentration of 5 mg DNA per ml before use.
Real-time PCR for the detection of Salmonella

Extracted total DNA samples from the ileum and caecum were tested for Salmonella by a LNA real-time
PCR method described by Josefsen et al. [31] with
minor modifications. PCR was performed on a
MX3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, California) in a total
reaction volume of 25 μl, consisting of 12.5 μl of Promega PCR Mastermix (Promega, Wisconsin, MA), 4.25
μl of water, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA (SigmaAldrich, cat L4390), 10 pmole of forward primer ttr-6
(5’-CTCACCAGGAGATTACAACATGG-3’), 10 pmole
of reverse primer ttr-4 (5’-AGCTCAGACCAAAAGTGACCATC-3’), 10 pmole of LNA target probe (6-FAMCG+ACGGCG+AG+ACCG-BHQ1) (Sigma-Aldrich) and
2 μl of purified DNA (10 ng). The temperature profile
was initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min., followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 60 s, and 72°C for
30 s. Fluorescence measurements were analyzed with
the MxPro-Mx3005P software (Stratagene, version 4.10).
The threshold was assigned by using the software option
background-based threshold. All samples were tested in

Page 9 of 11

duplicate and a sample was counted as positive if at
least one out of two were positive.
Polymerase chain reaction conditions for 16S rDNA

Generation of a PCR fragment of the 16S ribosomal
gene was done as described previously [27]. Briefly, four
replicate 50 μl PCR mixtures were made from each sample on a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, Massachusetts). Reaction conditions were as
follows: 5 μl PCR buffer (HT Biotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK); 10 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10 pmole forward primer S-D-Bact-0008-a-S-20
(5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’), 10 pmole
reverse primer S-D-Bact-0926-a-A-20 (5’-CCGTC
AATTCCTTTRAGTTT-3’), and 1.25 U of DNA polymerase (SuperTaq; HT Biotechnology Ltd., Cambridge,
UK) in a 50- μl reaction. Primer S-D-Bact-0008-a-S-20
was 5’ FAM labelled. Two-microliter aliquots of
extracted DNA (10 ng) were used for amplification of
caecal samples, but ileum samples were analysed using
non diluted samples due to low DNA concentration.
PCR cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C
for 6 min; followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 s, annealing at 57°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°
C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min.
Amplified DNA was verified by electrophoresis on 2%
agarose gels.
Restriction digest

The PCR products from the four replicates were pooled
into two samples, purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and finally eluted in
a volume of 30 μl EB buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5).
Then 15 μl purified PCR product was digested overnight
(or 3 hours) at 37°C with 0.02 U of Hha1 (Boehringer,
Mannheim, Germany) in a 20 μl reaction mixture.
Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism

Each sample was analysed as two replicate fragments (TRFs) by electrophoresis on an automatic sequence analyzer (ABI-PRISM-373-DNA-Sequencer; PE Biosystems,
Foster City, California). Aliquots (2 μl) of T-RFs were
mixed with 2 μl of deionized formamide, 0.4 μl of loading buffer (PE Biosystems), and 0.6 μl of DNA fragment
length standard (MegaBace ET900, GE Healthcare,
Hillerød, DK). The T-RF mixture was denatured at 94°C
for 2 min and chilled on ice prior to electrophoresis.
Five microliter aliquots of the mixture were loaded on a
36-cm, 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis settings were 2,500 V and 40 mA for 10 h, using
the B filter set. Due to sequence species specific variations in the ribosomal gene, a restriction digest will give
rise to T-RF of different size, and when many species
are mixed as in the intestinal microbiota this can be

visualized as a pattern of peaks in an electropherogram,
a fingerprint profile. These profiles were collected by
the software and analysed by the use of BioNumerics
software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).
The length of each band was determined by comparing
it towards the internal standard ladder. From each sample two replicates were compared, and weak bands that
were only represented in one of the two were rejected
to exclude false T-RFs from the fingerprint. After normalization of all profiles towards the internal standard,
they were compared using BioNumerics. The comparisons between cages were based on calculating the Dice
similarity coefficient and the unweighted pair group
method using arithmetic averages for clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reflect
the grouping and relatedness of samples.
Pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes

Samples (n = 10) from the same cage types (CC, FC,
and AV), and sampling date (before inoculation and 4
weeks PI.), were pooled by mixing 250 ng of purified
DNA from each sample in one tube, in total making up
6 samples. After adding twice the volume of 70% ethanol to each sample for conservation, they were submitted for pyrosequencing at LGC Genomics, Berlin,
Germany, using the Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium
system’s standard amplicon sequencing protocols (Roche
Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). There, a 410-420 bp fragment
spanning two variable regions (V4 and V5) in 16s rDNA
genes was amplified using the primers 519F 5’-CAGCAGCCGCGGTAATAC-3 and 926R 5’-CCGTCAAT
TCCTTTGAGTTT-3, targeting Bacteria. To increase
the number of reads, all samples were run as multiplex
on the same ¼ picoplate using nucleotide barcodes tags
on primers, allowing sample identification to each
sequence read.
Analysis of data from pyrosequencing

All sequences in the output file from the FLX sequencer
was sorted into sample groups based on the barcode
tag. After trimming all sequences for barcodes and
fusion primers using the FLS software, sequences were
imported into the CLC bio software (CLC bio, Aarhus,
Denmark), where they were checked, aligned and filtered for high quality sequences. OTU’s were generated
by CLC based on 99% similarity on the data set that
had a sequence longer than 400 bp. The Sequence
match analysis tool in the Ribosomal database project
10 http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ was used to assign the phylogenetic position of each OTU. The search criteria
were for both type and non-type strains, both environmental (uncultured) sequences and isolates, near-fulllength sequences (> 1200 bases) of good quality. If there
was a consensus at the genus level, the tag was assigned

Page 10 of 11

this taxonomic classification. If no such consensus was
found, the classification proceeded up one level to
family, and again if no taxonomic affiliation could be
assigned the tag continued to be proceeded up the tree,
as described by Huse et al. [32]. In some cases, it was
not possible to assign a domain, and these sequences
might represent new organisms or the sequences might
be biased; in these cases the tags were excluded from
the dataset. In total 250,007 sequences were finally
assigned a taxonomic classification in this study.
