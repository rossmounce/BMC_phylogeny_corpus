Abstract
Background: In spite of considerable efforts over past decades we still know relatively little
regarding the biogeography of rotifers of inland waters in México. To help rectify this we
undertook an extensive survey of the rotifer fauna of 48 water bodies in the Chihuahuan Desert
of México.
Results: Of the sites surveyed, 21 had salinities ≥ 2000 μS cm-1 and in these we found 57 species
of monogonont rotifers and several bdelloids. Species richness in the saline sites varied widely, with
a range in species richness of 1 to 27 and a mean (± 1SD) = 8.8 (± 6.2). Collectively all sites possess
relatively high percent single- and doubletons, 33.3 and 21.7%, respectively. Simpson's Asymmetric
Index indicated that similarity in rotifer species composition varied widely among a set of 10 sites.
These were selected because they were sampled more frequently or represent unusual habitats.
These SAI values ranged from 0.00 (complete dissimilarity) to 1.00 (complete similarity). The
Jaccard Index varied between 0.00 and 0.35. This observation probably reflects similarities and
differences in water chemistry among these sites. Inland saline systems differed in their chemical
composition by region. Conductivity was related to hardness and alkalinity. In addition, hardness
was positively associated with chloride and sulfate. RDA showed that several species were
positively associated with chloride concentration. Other factors that were significantly associated
with rotifer species included the presence of macrophytes, nitrate content, oxygen concentration,
TDS, latitude and whether the habitat was a large lake or reservoir.
Conclusion: This study illustrates the diversity of the rotiferan fauna of inland saline systems and
the uniqueness among waterbodies. Conservation of these systems is needed to preserve these
unique sources of biodiversity that include rotifers and the other endemic species found in
association with them.

Background
Rotifers are widely recognized as being important components of freshwater ecosystems, and whether this assessment is based on numbers or biomass, their contribution
to trophic dynamics in these waters is striking. In some
instances their importance even exceeds that of the microcrustaceans: cladocerans and copepods [1]. In estuarine
and marine habitats, rotifers are generally thought to play
a minor role in community dynamics [2-5]. Therefore
brackish and marine rotifers, with the notable exception
of the Brachionus plicatilis species complex, have received
little attention worldwide. Because of its value in aquaculture [6-8], this species complex has received special attention and this intense study has yielded valuable insights
into evolutionary processes such as cryptic speciation and
molecular phylogenetics [9-12] and genomics [13]. In
addition, rotifer species inhabiting saline and subsaline
lakes in northern Canada possessed greater haplotype
diversity than their freshwater counterparts [14].
While quite a bit is known about zooplankton present in
México (e.g., copepods [15,16]; cladocerans [17], few
reports have been published on brackish and marine rotifers [3,18,19]. Although some of these studies have
focused on species diversity and community dynamics
[4], none of them have included the Chihuahuan Desert.
With increased exploitation of aquifers for agriculture, cattle, industry, and drinking water, we can expect an
increase in the salinization of existing watersheds and
water sources particularly in arid areas. These changes will
negatively impact ecosystem processes [20]. Here we
examine selected inland saline waters in the Chihuahuan
Desert of México, a region renowned for its high biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic systems [21-24]. We also
present an initial species list of the rotifers, group sites by
water chemistry, conduct pair-wise comparisons of rotifer
community diversity between sites, and investigate ecological correlates of rotifer presence/absence.

Results
Water chemistries
With the exception of Cuatro Ciénegas (CC), sites in different regions cluster together as expected from their
shared basins and geochemistries (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). The
variety of water sources (springs, playas, rivers, seeps, wetlands) sampled at CC likely explains the spread in the data
for these systems. In general these systems have higher
conductivity, chloride, and sulfate than the others. Sulfate
and chloride were positively associated with hardness in
all sites. Alkalinity was less variable than other selected
parameters.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/7

Site similarities in species richness
We found 57 species of monogonont rotifers in aquatic
systems with salinities >2000 μS cm-1, and, of these, 34
also were present when salinities were ≥ 3000 μS cm-1
(Table 1). In addition, we found many bdelloid species,
but only Philodina megalotrocha was identified to species.
For new records in México and total species count see
[25]. Many of these species occurred as singletons
(33.3%) or doubletons (21.7%), a feature that has been
reported previously [25]. When comparing species composition between sites using the Simpson's Asymmetric
similarity Indices (SAI), we found values ranging from
0.00 to 1.00. An SAI of 1.00 indicates complete unity of
one site to the next, while SAI = 0.00 means complete dissimilarity of one site to the next (Table 2). The Jaccard
Index also varied greatly among sites (i.e., 0.00 and 0.35,
Table 3). In general, sites at Cuatro Ciénegas were quite
distinct from those near Ciudad Juárez, MX. For example,
disparity in SAI values between Ojos Altos A (site 1) and
several sites at CC (sites 18–27) can be attributed to the
paucity of species in the former and the richer fauna in the
later (Table 2). A few sites had SAI values reflecting similarity in species composition: e.g., Rio Mesquites (site 18)
and Las Playitas (site 27) and Los Hundidos (site 24) and
Los Gatos (site 26) had reciprocal pairwise SAI values of
approximate 0.5 (Table 2). Such similarity in rotifer fauna
probably reflects the similarity in water chemistry of these
sites, which is high in CaSO4.
Ecological correlations
In terms of ecological parameters, the first four canonical
axes in the RDA of all Méxican sites explained 14.2% of
the variance in the species data (Table 4). The most important environmental variable in the model was whether or
not the habitats were reservoirs or large lakes. None of the
saline sites sampled belonged to this habitat type (Fig. 2,
right panel). Species assemblages found at sites other than
lakes or reservoirs were ordinated with chloride concentration, nitrate concentration, oxygen concentration, and
presence of many macrophytes. In general, most samples
from CC were positively correlated with these variables,
whereas samples from the Ojos Altos and San Luis Potosí
were negatively correlated.

Rotifer species that were ordinated together with the variable lakes/reservoirs included many planktonic species,
such as Keratella cochlearis, Trichocerca rattus, T. similis, Polyarthra cf. luminosa, P. euryptera, P. vulgaris, P. remata,
Asplanchna girodi, A. brightwellii, S. oblonga, and S. pectinata
(Fig. 2, left panel). Species that were positively associated
with chloride are Notholca acuminata, Dicranophorus forcipatus, Collotheca crateriformis, Cephalodella panarista, Lecane
cornuta and Lepadella ovalis/patella.

The RDA performed on the dataset of sites with conductivity ≥ 2000 μS cm-1 separates species assemblages at CC
from those found in the Ojos Altos and at San Luis Potosí,
respectively (Fig. 3, right panel), with 21.2% of the variance in the species data being explained by the first four
canonical axes (Table 5). Species assemblages of different
sites at CC vary more than those at the other sampling
regions and are ordinated along gradients formed by the
presence of macrophytes and chloride concentration,
nitrate concentration, seasonality (summer) and TDS.
Species found mostly in the Ojos Altos and San Luis
Potosí and negatively correlated with chloride are L. aega-

nea, B. bidentatus, P. dolichoptera, and P. vulgaris (Fig. 2, left
panel). In CC sites a large group of species is ordinated
with presence of macrophytes and chloride concentration:
L. bulla, Philodina megalotrocha, Cephalodella megalocephala, Lecane punctata and L. closterocerca. Another group
of species was correlated with seasonality (summer):
Lecane obtusa, L. lunaris, Lepadella triptera, Hexarthra oxyuris, Proalis similis, Eosphora ehrenbergi, and Euchlanis dilatata.
The RDA of the dataset containing the sites with conductivity ≥ 3000 μS cm-1 again identified chloride, the pres-

ence of macrophytes, alkalinity, and site order, as the
most important variables explaining the variance in the
species data (Fig. 3). Site order signifies that the waterbody consisted of a series of pools that were ordered
downstream from the spring source. In this analysis
30.4% of the total variance can be explained by the first
four canonical axes (Table 6). Occurrence of Lecane spinulifera, Colurella colurus, Hexarthra oxyuris, Eosphora ehrenbergi, Proales similis, and bdelloids at CC sites was
positively correlated with alkalinity and chloride concentration, whereas the majority of species correlated with
presence of macrophytes included Philodina megalotrocha,
Cephalodella forficula, Colurella uncinata, Dicranophorus forcipatus, Lecane arcula, Platyias quadricornis, Scaridium bostjani, Trichocerca intermedia, Trichotria tetractis, and
Tripleuchlanis plicata. Brachionus bidentatus, B. angularis, P.
dolichoptera, P. vulgaris, and Gastropus stylifer were found in
San Francisco cattle tank (San Luis Potosí) and were negatively correlated with chloride.

Discussion
While zooplankton inhabiting saline aquatic habitats
have received some attention worldwide (e.g., China [5],

Spain [26-29], Canada [14,30], Western US [31,32],
Africa [33-36], Japan [37], Australia [38-41], Arabia [42]),
there is a genuine need for additional studies of rotifers in
saline and marine environments of México [3]. A recent
study noted that 74% of rotifer species in México (n = 42)
were cosmopolitan, 5% were restricted to North America,
10% were tropical, and 4% were shared with Europe-AsiaAfrica [43]. Most work on rotifers in saline habitats in
México has been done by Sarma and his colleagues. For
example, Sarma & Elías-Gutiérrez [44] found 31 rotifer
species in their survey of an estuarine lagoon; 11 of which
were found in our study (Platyias quadricornis, Tripleuchlanis plicata, Colurella uncinata, Lepadella ovalis, Lecane
bulla, L. closterocerca, L. hornemanni, L. luna, L. obtusa, L.
pyriformis, and L. thalera). In addition, Sarma et al. [3]
reported 37 species of rotifers in Mecoacan, a brackish (5–
35 ‰) lagoon located in Tabasco. Our survey of 48 waterbodies in the Mexican Chihuahuan desert shared few of
these species (Anuraeopsis fissa, Ascomorpha saltans, Brachionus angularis, Euchlanis dilatata, and Lecane bulla) all of
which have reportedly cosmopolitan distributions [45].
Another recent study [19] reported 128 taxa from 36
aquatic sites in southeastern México including some

L. bulla, L. closterocerca, L. cornuta, L. crepida, L.

spinulifera, L. thalera, L. triptera, Platyias quadricornis, Polyarthra dolichoptera, Scaridium bostjani and Tripleuchlanis
plicata) also were found in our survey.
In a larger study of freshwater habitats in the Méxican Chihuahuan Desert that includes the sites reported here, Wallace et al. [25] note that many species occurred as
singletons or doubletons, and species inhabiting particular sites are quite unique. Here we further address community similarity among high salinity habitats using the SAI,
and again the uniqueness of communities is apparent
(Table 2). While our study adds substantially to the characterization of rotifer communities, clearly much more
research needs to be accomplished if we are to develop a
good understanding of the biogeography of rotifers in
saline waters in North America.
The saline systems in the Mexican part of the Chihuahuan
Desert have less total dissolved solids and lower conductivity than some of the waters of the Northern Chihuahuan Desert in the United States, notably those at White
Sands National Monument, New Mexico and the Bottomless Lakes near Roswell, New Mexico. Only few species

typical for saline waters were found over a wide range of
aquatic habitats in the Chihuahuan Desert, such as Proales
similis. However, a redundancy analysis performed on the
data of all the saline systems that we have sampled in the
Chihuahuan Desert, showed that the presence or absence
of macrophytes is an important variable in determining
species composition in all of these systems (unpublished
data).
High salinity and conductivity levels can have major
impacts on zooplankton community structure. A study in
coastal lakes found that salinity level had significant
impacts on zooplankton [46], leading the authors to predict that relatively small increases in salinity levels will
cause reduced biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems. In a
mesocosm experiment manipulating salinity, Hart et al.
[31] found dramatic shifts in zooplankton community
structure and shifts in the abundance of many species. As
salinity increased, densities of the dominant rotifer species decreased and at the highest salinities 2 species were
reduced to very low numbers. Shiel and his colleagues
found that salinity was a significant, but site-specific, factor in determining rotifer community composition in rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin [41]. Saline systems had reduced
species richness compared to their freshwater analogs (0–
4 versus 0–31). In the Mexican saline systems studied
here, as salinity increases the number of species found

decreases substantially (Table 1; Fig 1, 2, 3). Chloride is a
significant factor in determining the occurrence of rotifers.
Some species are positively correlated with chloride content and others negatively associated (see Results, Fig 2a,
3a). It appears in our systems that typical planktonic
freshwater species (e.g., Asplanchna brightwellii, A. priodonta, K. americana, K. cochlearis, and Synchaeta pectinata)
are replaced by salinity tolerant species such as Hexarthra
oxyuris and Notholca acuminata.

Conclusion
Inland saline systems often harbor diverse and unique
community assemblages. Unfortunately, human exploitation can be extremely disruptive to ecosystem processes
and services provided by these important water sources.
During our sampling efforts, several historical springs
near Janos, México were dry. In addition, Ojo de la Casa
has recently dried and Ojo en de Medio has dried and resurfaced in the past year, probably due demands of a geo-

thermal electrical plant for cooling water and agricultural
and domestic uses. Increasing human population size and
global climate change will only make this scenario more
prevalent. Thus, it is imperative that governmental agencies establish policies that protect these fragile ecosystems
[47].

Methods
Sampling strategy
As part of a larger study on Chihuahuan Desert waters
[25,48-50] we sampled 48 sites in the Méxican portion of
the Chihuahuan Desert. Sites included springs, cattle
tanks, tinajas, rivers, reservoirs, and artificially constructed ponds. Some of these systems comprised multiple basins with varying degrees of inter-site connectivity.
Of these, 11 sites had salinities ≥ 2000 μS cm-1, 10 additional sites had salinities from ≥ 3000 μS cm-1. It should
be noted that sampling effort was not equal among all

sites, some sites were sampled only once while others
were sampled up to 7 times (Ojos Altos).
Our sampling strategy attempted to provide an All Taxa
Biological Inventory (ATBI) [51]; to accomplish this we
collected samples from planktonic, littoral, and benthic
habitats using plankton nets (64 μm), grab samples (e.g.,
aquatic plants for sessile forms), and aspirating samplers.
We calculated species richness (S), Jaccard's Similarity
Index and Simpson's Index of Asymmetry [52,53]. The
keys used in this study were as follows: Monogononta
[54-64] and Bdelloidea [65,66]. Additional details of our
methodology are described in [25,48,49].
Analysis
To compare physical aspects of the aquatic habitats sampled, we constructed three-way plots of selected water
chemistry parameters. To investigate ecological correlates
of species distributions we conducted Redundancy Analyses (RDA) using CANOCO for Windows 4.54 [67]. Three
RDAs were done: one using the complete dataset of the 48
sites sampled, a second analysis with a subset of data
including the sites with conductivity >2000 μS cm-1, and
a third on a subset of data with sites with conductivity ≥
3000 μS cm-1. Environmental variables were sequentially
added to the model of each analysis when they provided
extra fit to the model at a significance level of p < 0.05. The
significance of variables was determined with Monte
Carlo tests running 9999 permutations.
