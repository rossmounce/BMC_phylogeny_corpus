Abstract
Background: The genus Algansea is one of the most representative freshwater fish groups in central Mexico due to its
wide geographic distribution and unusual level of endemicity. Despite the small number of species, this genus has had an
unsettled taxonomic history due to high levels of intraspecific morphological variation. Moreover, several phylogenetic
hypotheses among congeners have been proposed but have had the following shortcomings: the use of homoplasious
morphological characters, the use of character codification and polarisation methods that lacked objectivity, and
incomplete taxonomic sampling. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis among species of Algansea is presented. This analysis
is based upon two molecular markers, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the first intron of the ribosomal protein
S7 gene.
Results: Bayesian analysis based on a combined matrix (cytochrome b and first intron S7) showed that Algansea is a
monophyletic group and that Agosia chrysogaster is the sister group. Divergence times dated the origin of the genus
around 16.6 MYA, with subsequent cladogenetic events occurring between 6.4 and 2.8 MYA. When mapped onto the
molecular phylogenetic hypothesis, the character states of three morphological characters did not support previous
hypotheses on the evolution of morphological traits in the genus Algansea, whereas the character states of the remaining
six characters partially corroborated those hypotheses.
Conclusion: Monophyly of the genus Algansea was corroborated in this study. Tree topology shows the genus consists
of three main lineages: Central-Eastern, Western, and Southern clades. However, the relationships among these clades
remained unresolved. Congruence found between the available geological and climatic history and the divergence times
made it possible to infer the biogeographical history of Algansea, which suggested that vicariance events were responsible
for the evolutionary history of the genus. Interestingly, this pattern was shared with other members of the freshwater
fish fauna of central Mexico. In addition, molecular data also show that some morphological traits alleged to represent
synapomorphies in previous studies were actually homoplasies. Others traits were corroborated as synapomorphies,
particularly in those species of a subgroup corresponding with the Central-Eastern clade within Algansea; this
corroboration is interpreted as a result of evolutionary adaptations.

Background
Mexico lies between the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographical zones and is considered to be a transitional
zone. Because of this, it is possible to find fauna with different evolutionary origins [1]. One of the world's great
tropical-subtropical highlands is the massive uplift
known as the Mesa Central of Mexico (MCM) and its
southern limit, the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB).
Since the Miocene, this zone has experienced an active
geological history, which has promoted a complex surface
configuration, including a wide variety of ecosystems. The
freshwater fish fauna of the MCM [2,3] is unique, with
around 78 species, and is represented by an unusual level
of endemicity (70%) [4,5]. Most of the endemic species
are represented by monophyletic groups that have undergone a diversification process within central Mexico [6,7]
such as the entire subfamily Goodeinae (41 species), the
Atherinopsid genera Chirostoma (19 species), and three
endemic genera belonging to the family Cyprinidae:
Algansea (7 species), Evarra (3 species), and Yuriria (3 species) [6,8-12].
Knowledge about the diversification processes of freshwater fish in central Mexico, including their origin as well as
their evolutionary and biogeographical history, is still
incomplete. Several hypotheses regarding the biogeography of freshwater fish in the region have been discussed in
some detail in several studies [2,3,13-17]. These authors
described general patterns using occurrence data and morphological comparisons. More recently, studies that incorporated molecular approaches in a phylogenetic context
have been conducted to elucidate the biogeographical and
evolutionary history of fish in central Mexico among
groups such as poecilids [18], goodeids [7,9,19], and
cyprinids [10,12]. All of these studies agree that the historical biogeography of central Mexico and its freshwater fish
fauna is linked to the intense geological activity since the
early Miocene. This activity has generated a complex
hydrological system characterised by high dynamism and
the formation and destruction of drainages. This dynamism promoted vicariance, taxon-pulse, and speciespulse events [20]. However, the complexity of these biogeographic patterns and the few fish groups studied thus
far make it necessary to study other co-distributed fish
groups, such as members of the genus Algansea, to formulate a more robust biogeographical scenario of the area.
The first attempts to uncover phylogenetic patterns of
freshwater fish in central Mexico were based on just a few
morphological traits, resulting in a non-robust hypothesis
regarding the evolutionary history of the groups
[2,3,21,22]. More recently, phylogenetic studies on different freshwater fish families occurring in the region that
were based on various molecular markers revealed results
contradictory to those results obtained with morphologi-

cal characters [9,11,12,23]. Such molecular approaches
demonstrated that fish diversity was in fact underestimated because several new species were described; in
addition, some morphological characters commonly used
in the classification of these groups were homoplasies.
The genus Algansea is one of these groups that exemplify
the particular problem of using morphological characters
as the only source of information to establish a phylogenetic hypothesis. Although this genus possesses a few representative species, Algansea aphanea, Algansea avia,
Algansea barbata, Algansea lacustris, Algansea monticola,
Algansea popoche, Algansea tincella, [5], and Algansea amecae [24], its taxonomic history has been unstable, particularly due to high levels of intraspecific morphological
variability found in the most widely distributed species
within the genus, A. tincella [21].
The first significant attempt to elucidate the systematic
relationships among species of Algansea was made by Barbour and Miller [21]. These authors studied only six valid
species and two subspecies and found two groups: (1)
species with maxillary barbels (A. monticola - including A.
m. monticola and A. m. avia -, A. barbata and A. aphanea)
and (2) species without maxillary barbels (A. lacustris, A.
popoche and A. tincella). In addition, based on the presence
of a plate-like dermosphenotic bone, the genus Gila was
determined to be the closest relative to Algansea [21].
However, current molecular studies of Mexican cyprinids
do not support this relationship, and these analyses established the genus Agosia as the sister group of Algansea
[10,12]. Subsequent to Barbour and Miller's hypothesis,
the subspecies A. m. avia was validated as an independent
species, A. avia. This species, together with A. monticola, A.
barbata, and A. aphanea, are the barbeled species. The last
taxonomic change implied that the highly differentiated
population of A. tincella from the Ameca River should be
recognised as A. amecae [24]. All the aforementioned suggest that the morphological characters on which those
first analyses were based have evolved independently several times throughout the evolutionary history of
cyprinids [25], resulting in controversial classification
schemes [26].
Molecular markers have proven to be very useful tools
when elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of vertebrate groups. In the last few years, the mitochondrial gene
cytochrome b (cyt b) and the first intron of the S7 ribosomal protein gene have been used in different phylogenetic analyses to provide insights into the fish
evolutionary history at various taxonomic levels. Both
genes have proven their utility not only for inferring the
phylogenetic relationships among closely related species
but also for investigating intraspecific variation and even
for establishing species boundaries [27-31]. Accordingly,
in this paper we used both cyt b and the first intron of S7

to infer the phylogenetic relationships among species and
populations of Algansea throughout their entire distribution range in central Mexico. Additionally, the results of
these analyses were used to: 1) compare with the previous
phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological data; 2)
characterise the evolution of the main morphological
characters used for identifying natural groups; and 3)
establish possible biogeographic scenarios in which species and populations may have evolved in the context of
the geological and climatic history and contrast this history with other co-distributed taxa.

quency distribution was always homogeneous among
taxa.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Details of the Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian
Inference (BI) analyses are summarised in Table 1. All the
analyses (mitochondrial, nuclear, and combined data)
showed almost identical and well-supported topologies;
however, the MP tree was less resolved than the Bayesian
consensus tree. Thus, we focus our discussion on the more
resolved Bayesian tree and only summarise the results of
the MP analysis.

Results
All the cladograms retrieved Algansea as monophyletic
with high support values (Figures. 1, 2 and 3). Also, all the
species formed monophyletic assemblages, except A. tincella and A. amecae in the nuclear gene cladogram (Figure
2). In addition, all the trees showed Agosia chrysogaster as
the sister group to Algansea (Figures 1, 2 and 3).

Sequence data patterns
In the cyt b sequences (1,140 bp), a total of 425 sites
(37%) were variable, and 279 (24%) were parsimony
informative. As expected for a protein-coding gene, third
codon positions were the most variable (320), followed
by the first (74) and the second (31) positions. For the S7
intron, the size was 965 bp including gaps, and there were
279 variable sites, 103 of which were parsimony informative. Comparison of the individual genes' phylogenetic
performance under taxon sampling of the combined analysis is found in Table 1. Estimated parameters using Modeltest [32] are shown in Table 1. As in other North
American cyprinids' cyt b, a low Guanine frequency in the
third codon positions was found [12,23,33]. S7 sequences
were AT-rich, as has been previously reported for other
families of freshwater fishes [34,35] and other North
American cyprinids [12]. Despite such apparent bias, the
χ2 test for base homogeneity indicated that the base fre-

Sister group relationships among species of Algansea were
generally consistent with the cyt b or combined data sets.
Three main clades corresponding to the Central-Eastern,
Western, and Southern regions of the whole distribution
range of the genus Algansea were recovered with high support values. The Central-Eastern clade is represented by
the species A. barbata, A. amecae, A. lacustris, and A. tincella (Figures 1, 2 and 3). The Western clade included the
two species A. monticola and A. avia from the northwestern headwaters of the Santiago River and the lower Santiago, respectively (Figures 1 and 3). The last clade is

represented only by A. aphanea (Figures 1, 2 and 3), a species that inhabits the Southern Pacific river basins of Ayuquila-Armería and Coahuayana-Tamazula (see Additional
File 1 and Figure 4). The basal relationships among the
three main clades were not resolved.
When intron S7 was used, there were no differences
between both phylogenetic methods (MP and BI); inclusion or exclusion of indels in the MP analyses gave the
same topology. However, with respect to the cyt b and the
combined data sets, a lower resolution tree was formed
with a resulting basal polytomy (Figure 2).
The main difference between the three data sets was the
position of the species A. barbata with respect to all the
congeners. In the cyt b and combined data analyses, A. barbata is included in the Central-Eastern clade (Figures 1
and 3). However, in the S7 analysis, A. barbata is associated with a member of the Western clade (Figure 2). The
most resolved and best-supported hypothesis was
obtained with combined Bayesian analyses (Figure 3).
For cyt b, the genetic divergences found among species
ranged from D p = 0.020 ± 0.004 found between A. tincella
and A. lacustris to 0.090 ± 0.008 found between A. aphanea
and A. avia. Genetic divergences among species of the
Central-Eastern clade showed relatively low values, with
the highest value (Dp = 0.038 ± 0.006) observed between
A. lacustris and A. amecae and the lowest value (Dp = 0.020
± 0.004) observed between A. lacustris and A. tincella.
Divergences between the species of the Western clade
accounted for the higher values, with D p = 0.078 ± 0.008.
Among the three main clades, the observed divergence
values were similar: D p = 0.083 ± 0.008 between the
Southern and Central-Eastern clades, followed by D p =
0.086 ± 0.007 between the Western and Central-Eastern
clades, and D p = 0.088 ± 0.007 between the Southern and
Western clades. Within species, the lowest divergence
value was D p = 0.002 ± 0.001 between both analysed
populations of A. aphanea. The highest divergences within
species were found in populations of A. tincella, particularly between the population from the Quitupan River
(Balsas Basin), which had a divergence value of D p =
0.014-0.018 ± 0.004 with respect to the remaining A. tincella populations. For the S7 intron, the lowest divergences between species were found between A. tincella and
A. lacustris, with values ranging from D p = 0.005 ± 0.002

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/223

to D p = 0.008 ± 0.004. The highest divergences were
found between A. aphanea and A. monticola when compared to the remaining species of Algansea, which had values ranging from Dp = 0.020 ± 0.005 to D p = 0.036 ±
0.006.
Molecular clock estimates among the genera Algansea and
Agosia placed the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) at 14.7 MYA (16.3-10.6 MYA). The estimated age of the diversification of the Central-Eastern,
Western, and Southern clades is 6.2 MYA (7.8-4.7 MYA).
The split between A. avia and A. monticola occurred 4.5
MYA (6.2-3.2 MYA). Within the Central-Eastern clade, the
oldest splitting event occurred about 2.9 MYA (4.1-2.1
MYA) between A. barbata and the clade containing the
ancestor of the A. amecae, A. lacustris, A. tincella. Following
the cladogenetic events, A. amecae and the clade A. lacustris, A. tincella were dated to 2.4 MYA (3.1-1.9 MYA), and
A. lacustris and A. tincella were dated to 1.9 MYA (2.6-1.3
MYA).
Mapping some morphological traits commonly used in
the classification of Algansea onto the molecular phylogenies clearly shows that the orientation of the mouth,
either terminal or upturned, represents a homoplasious
character (Figure 5A). Except for a subgroup of the Central-Eastern clade formed by A. amecae, A. lacustris, and A.
tincella, the supraethmoid orientation and the gut flexure
were homoplasies as well (Figure 5D, F). The lack of maxillary barbels, a higher number of gill rakers (Figure 5B),
an irregular supraethmoid margin, and well-developed
epiotic bones (Figure 5C) were synapomorphies for the
aforementioned subgroup. In addition, the remaining
two characters mapped, i.e., standard length (as was
coded in the present study) and the neurocranium dome,
were synapomorphies for the whole genus, supporting the
monophyly of the Central-Eastern, Western and Southern
clades (Figure 5E, G).
Barbour and Miller's [21] and Jensen and Barbour's [36]
analyses demonstrated that the standard length was not
useful for establishing sister-group relationships among
species of Algansea. In our study, this character was re-evaluated and was found to be informative with the proper
codification, i.e., smaller (< 100 mm) or larger size (> 100
mm). Standard length character was found to be a synapomorphy for a species group formed by Southern and Western clades (smaller group) and the Central-Eastern clade
(larger group) (Figure 5E).

genus Agosia as a sister group of Algansea was consistent in
all analyses. The relationship of the genus Gila with Algansea as previously suggested by Barbour and Miller [21],
was rejected. Our results support previous studies in
which a close phylogenetic relationship was found
between Algansea and Agosia [10,12,37].

fish species suggests that the process of duplication of the
S7 gene is considerably lower in fish than in mammals
[43]. In addition, no duplication cases have been found in
previous studies on fish where the S7 intron was used
[12,28,30,31,35,38,42-44]; therefore, a duplication event
probably did not occur within Algansea.

Sequence variation for the mitochondrial cyt b and
nuclear S7, independently or combined, did not provide
enough information to resolve the relationships among
the three well-supported groups: the Central-Eastern,
Western, and Southern clades. A lower supported relationship, Western clade + Southern clade, was found when the
cyt b and the combined matrix were used (Figures 1 and
3), whereas a basal polytomy was found using the S7
intron (Figure 2). Phylogenetic reconstruction shows no
resolution in basal members of Algansea, which might be
the result of distinct evolution rates of the markers used in
this study. The evolution rate of cyt b was almost twice as
high as the evolution rate of nuclear S7 intron. This fact
had been previously reported for other fish [30,31,38].
However, Schönhuth et al. [12] recently showed that,
although the evolution rates of cyt b and S7 differ markedly, both markers had a similar performance in reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among species
and genera of North American cyprinids.

Distinguishing between hybridisation and deep coalescence is complicated because both processes generate similar phylogenetic patterns [40,41,45,46]. Although
introgressive hybridisation have played an important role
in the evolutionary history of some North American
cyprinids [47-50], Barbour and Miller [21] recognised
hybrids in a zone where A.tincella and A. popoche are sympatric. There are two reasons for discarding a recent and/
or historical hybridisation as the cause of incongruence
between mitochondrial and nuclear genes-based hypotheses (due to the unstable position of A. barbata). On the
one hand, disjunctive historical and current distribution
patterns of A. barbata and A. monticola (see Biogeographic
Implications and Figure 4) suggest that no contact
between the two species occurred. Second, as in other
North American cyprinids [48-50] and other fish groups
[51,52], when a hybridisation event is detected by phylogenetic analysis, it needs further corroboration using data
from different sources. However, data gathered thus far on
the evolutionary history of Algansea show contradicting
results with respect to the relationships among A. barbata
and other congeners. For instance, morphological characters support the relationships between A. barbata and A.
aphanea [36], while topology obtained through the cyt b
gene placed A. barbata within the Central-Eastern clade as
the sister species of the not-barbeled species (Figure 1).
The topology obtained through the first S7 intron shows
that A. barbata and A. monticola are sister taxa (Figure 2).

Therefore, this lack of resolution, especially at the base of
the cladogram of the genus, as shown by separate and
combined analyses, may be explained as a result of inadequate sampling of data, sampling of taxa, or a compositional base bias. However, such phylogenetic pattern
could be caused by a process implicit to the species' evolutionary history as well, such as a rapid or simultaneous
speciation [39].
The combined data analysis provided the best resolution
for establishing the phylogenetic relationships among
members of Algansea, and that analysis also shows the
highest support values. Particularly for the Central-Eastern clade, the combined analysis represented the best estimate for the relationships among the included species
(Figure 3).
Otherwise, the inconsistent phylogenetic position of A.
barbata, in particular in the mitochondrial and nuclear
trees, is the main difference found between topologies
obtained by using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The
lack of congruence among molecular markers could be
explained by gene duplication, hybridisation (ancient or
recent), or incomplete lineage sorting [40,41].
Despite the existence of pseudogenes in the S7 ribosomal
protein gene in mice [42], the amplification of single PCR
products for the first and second introns among distant

Based on the premise that the S7 intron shows a slower
evolution rate, it is possible that inconsistencies may
reflect insufficient time to complete the lineage sorting.
An incomplete lineage sorting is found in relatively recent
diversification events, and in particular when nuclear
genes are employed a longer time is required to reach
reciprocal monophyly [53]. Given the rapid speciation of
the genus Algansea in central Mexico, relationship
between A. barbata and A. monticola obtained in the S7
intron topology is attributed to the retention of an ancestral polymorphism. In fact, incongruence was observed
between the three kinds of evidence, morphological, and
the mitochondrial and nuclear genes, reflecting the random nature of lineage sorting [40,46].
Biogeographic implications
Based on the sister group relationships between Algansea
and Gila as found by Barbour and Miller [21], it was postulated that the genus Algansea derived from a widespread

ancestor in the highlands of western Mexico during the
late Tertiary. Our findings indicate that the sister group of
Algansea is the genus Agosia. This genus is distributed from
the Western Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico to the
Rocky Mountains in the United States (Figure 4), supporting a western origin and a colonisation route to central
Mexico by the ancestor of the genus Algansea.
According to the estimated divergence times, the cladogenetic event involving the ancestor of Agosia and Algansea
was dated about 14.7 MYA (16.3-10.6 MYA), during the
middle Miocene (Figure 6). This event is associated with
the uplift of the western part of the MCM and the southern part of the Sierra Madre Occidental. This uplift was
promoted by tecto-volcanic activity in the region and was
related to the opening of the Proto Gulf of California during the lower and middle Miocene [54,55]. This biogeographical pattern is in agreement with findings made in
other freshwater fishes, such as goodeids (the separation
of the Characodontini tribe from the remaining tribes of
the subfamily Goodeinae), and with the separation of the
two divergent groups of the poecilid Poeciliopsis spp.,
which occurred about 15.5 MYA and between 8 and 16
MYA, respectively [18,20].
The separation of the three main clades of Algansea is
dated at some point between the Miocene and Pliocene,
about 6.2 MYA (7.8-4.7 MYA), a period recognised for a
series of profound global palaeoclimatic changes and
high geological activity in central Mexico [56]. In particular, during the formation of the western part of the TMVB,
several events were responsible for the isolation of major
groups within Algansea and within other groups of freshwater fish (Figure 6). Including the genus Poeciliopsis [18],
the formation of the two main lineages within the
cyprinid Notropis of central Mexico [23], and the diversification of three tribes among the Goodeinae [20], all of
which coincided with these events.
Within the Western clade, the cladogenesis of A. avia and
A. monticola, both inhabitants of the Santiago River, was
dated to the Pliocene, 4.5 MYA (6.2-3.2 MYA). Currently,
these species are separated by a deep canyon in the main
channel of the Santiago River; therefore, the formation of
this geological structure may be responsible for the separation of these species [57]. The origin of the Santiago
River Canyon is related to the Santa Rosa faulting, which
is dated to the early Pliocene [58] (Figure 6). The presence
of A. avia in the Compostela River in Nayarit can be attributed to a river capture event frequently occurring in the
upper part of rivers in central México due to headwaters
erosion. This event is dated to less than 1 MYA [20] and
coincides with the distribution pattern of the goodeid
Xenotoca eiseni.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/223

The event that originated the separation between A. barbata and the ancestor of the clade formed by A. tincella, A.
lacustris, and A. amecae is calculated to have occurred 2.9
MYA (4.1-2.1 MYA), reinforcing the idea that climatic and
geological changes in the MCM during that time led to the
diversification of Algansea. During this period, intense
tecto-volcanic activity combined with a dry period produced a strong compartmentalisation of palaeolakes in
central Mexico. This activity could have been responsible
for population isolation and subsequent speciation events
[56,59]. Likewise, this distributional pattern is in agreement with the separation of two lineages of the goodeid
tribe Girardinichthyini that occurred in the palaeolakes of
the region and are dated between the upper Miocene and
lower Pleistocene [7].
The second event within the Central-Eastern clade was the
isolation of A. amecae in the Ameca River from the ancestor of the remaining members of the Central-Eastern
clade, A. tincella and A. lacustris. This cladogenetic event
also took place in the upper Pliocene, approximately 2.4
MYA (3.1-1.9 MYA). This pattern clearly indicates an
ancient connection between the upper Ameca River and
the Lerma-Chapala River system, which was further disrupted by geological activity along the Ameca and San
Marcos faults, which occurred throughout the Pliocene
(Figure 6) [58]. It is also related to the dry period reported
in the area between 3.5 to 1.8 MYA [56]. Ferrari et al. [60]
mentioned the presence of volcano-lacustrine deposits
along these faults, which probably indicates that the formation of these depressions occurred during the early
Pliocene. These results are in agreement with findings in
other groups of freshwater fishes that currently occur in
both basins, such as the cyprinids Yuriria amatlana, Zoogoneticus tequila, and Ameca splendens (all endemic to the
Ameca River basin) and their sister groups, inhabitants of
the Lerma-Chapala system [7,11].
The cladogenetic event of the species pair A. lacustris,
endemic to Patzcuaro Lake, and A. tincella, a widespread
species in the Lerma, Panuco, Balsas, and Verde de Santiago rivers basins and Cuitzeo Lake, is dated to the upper
Pliocene, 1.9 MYA (2.6-1.3 MYA). Although the formation and evolution of Patzcuaro Lake remains unclear and
controversy surrounds the age of the lake's origin, volcanic activity in the Tarasco Corridor has been previously
proposed as one of the causes of diversification of other
fish species in the region in the last 3 MYA [19].
The historical biogeography of the genus Algansea seems
to be closely linked to the intense geological and climatic
activity of central Mexico, which is one of the most complex and active geological areas in the world [61-63].
Based on both historical and geological data, most of the

cladogenetic events within the genus Algansea were the
result of vicariant events (Figure 6). This intense activity
has been proposed as the main cause of diversification in
other freshwater species of central Mexico, such as the
Goodeids [7,20,64], Poeciliids [18,65], helminth parasites [66-70], snakes [71], frogs [72,73], and ambystomatid salamanders [74].
Most of the aforementioned vicariant events are highly
consistent with the topology obtained from the combined
analyses. Still, more groups must be studied in the same
context for a better understanding of the processes that led
to the diversification of the complex biota that occurs in
this transitional zone.
Morphological evolution and taxonomic implications
North American cyprinids show a diverse and complex
morphological evolution; this complexity is probably the
main reason to consider theses fishes as one of the most
taxonomically difficult groups on the continent [26].

According to our results, the barbeled species group (A.
monticola, A. aphanea and A. barbata) that was based solely
on morphology from previous phylogenetic hypotheses
of the genus Algansea [21,36] was not recovered as monophyletic; this result corroborates the conflictive role that
the maxillary barbels have for the classification of the family Cyprinidae [25,26]. However, even though maxillary
barbels seem to have evolved independently several times
[25], the presence of such structures in A. barbata is
regarded as a plesiomorphic character for the clade to
which this species belong. Instead, the lack of barbels in
the subgroup of the Central-Eastern clade, together with a
higher number of gill rakers, six other character states
(except for body size smaller than 100 mm and the
rounded neurocranium dome), are explained as derived
characters (Figure 5A-G).
In particular, possessing a larger body is an adaptation in
North American minnows that inhabit open-water habitats [75]. This suggests that the morphological traits found
in the members of Algansea that constitute the CentralEastern clade are clearly associated with lacustrine environments. This adaptation might have been promoted
when species existed in the paleolakes in central Mexico
(see Biogeographic implications).
Barbour and Miller [21] described some characteristics of
the ecological conditions of the habitats where species of
Algansea occur. These data, and our own observations in
the sampling localities, allow us to conclude that the species forming the Western and Southern clades are
restricted to the upper parts of rivers, which are characterised by swift currents with rocky and gravel bottoms and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/223

clear and shallow water (less than one meter deep). On
the other hand, within the member of the Central-Eastern
clade, A. lacustris, is restricted to lakes; A. amecae and A.
barbata live in streams with slow to moderate water flow,
sandy silt bottoms, and water depths reaching more than
one meter. Furthermore, A. tincella occurs in a variety of
habitats ranging from small streams to lakes. These ecological aspects are closely tied with larger body size and,
therefore, are found mainly in the members of the Central-Eastern clade.
Although our study did not include the species A. popoche
(endemic to Chapala Lake), we could assume, based on
the distribution of this species, that it would likely be
included within the Central-Eastern clade. Barbour and
Miller [21] proposed A. popoche as the sister species of A.
lacustris. However, we were unable to collect specimens of
A. popoche because this species may have gone extinct, and
we could not further corroborate this idea. However, most
of the recognised species within the genus Algansea (A.
aphanea, A. avia, A. barbata, A. lacustris, A. monticola, A. tincella, [5], and A. amecae [24]) were corroborated by our
phylogenetic analyses. Two species regarded as subspecies
of A. monticola by Barbour and Miller [21], A. monticola
avia and A. monticola monticola, exhibited genetic divergence levels in our study that allowed us to further test the
hypothesis that A. avia is an independent species. These
tests granted species rank to A. avia and corroborated the
morphological differentiation found by Jensen and Barbour [36] and Barbour and Miller [57].

Conclusion
The present study is based on two independent sources of
evidence (mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers)
that corroborate the monophyly of the genus Algansea.
Despite the low resolution found in the phylogenies
within this genus, three well-supported clades were recovered: the Southern clade, including A. aphanea; the Western clade, including A. avia and A. monticola; and the
Central-Eastern clade, including A. barbata, A. amecae, A.
lacustris, and A. tincella. In particular, the monophyly of
the Central-Eastern clade was found, and our results did
not support the groups proposed by Barbour and Miller
[21] based on the presence of barbels. Historical biogeography patterns of this clade are shared with other groups
of co-distributed fishes in central Mexico. Additionally, a
larger body size in members of the Central-Eastern clade
suggests an evolutionary adaptation that arose when these
species colonised the lacustrine environments in which
they occur in central Mexico.
We corroborate the western origin of the genus Algansea;
however, the sister species is the monotypic Agosia. Most
of the cladogenetic events are associated with vicariance

occurring in the region as a result of tectonic activity and
climatic changes. Such events seem to have also shaped
the evolutionary history of other freshwater fish groups.

Methods
Species and Sampling
Fin clips were obtained from 48 specimens in 20 localities
(Additional File 1 and Figure 4) belonging to seven putative species of the genus Algansea (A. aphanea, A. avia, A.
barbata, A. lacustris, A. monticola, A. tincella, and A. amecae). Fishes were collected by electrofishing and seine
nets. The only species not included in the analysis was A.
popoche, an endemic species from Chapala Lake [5]. This
species has not been found in the locality despite a great
sampling effort made by different research groups, raising
the possibility that the species is now extirpated or extinct
[76]. Additionally, fin clips were collected from representative species of the cyprinid genera Agosia, Campostoma,
Dionda, and Gila (Table 1). To test the monophyly of the
genus Algansea, and due to the relationships found
between Algansea and other North American cyprinids
[10,12], the first three genera were included as ingroups,
leaving Gila as an outgroup. Voucher specimens of all species were deposited in the Museo Nacional de Ciencias
Naturales (MNCN), Madrid, Spain, and at the Colección
de Peces de la Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de
Hidalgo (CPUM), Michoacán, México.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved
fin clips according to standard CTAB and phenol-chloroform extraction procedures [77]. Both the complete
sequence of cyt b and the first intron of ribosomal protein
gene S7 were amplified via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). For both genes, reaction amplifications were carried out in 25 μl reactions containing: 2.5 μl 10× buffer
with MgCl2 (Biotools), 0.5 μl of each dNTP (10 μM), 0.3
μl of each primer, 1-2 μl genomic DNA (50 ng/Ml), 1 unit
of Taq DNA polymerase (Biotools), and distilled water to
bring the final reaction volume to 25 μl.

For the cyt b gene, the primers used were those primers in
Machordom and Doadrio [78]. For the first intron of S7,
we used the primers of Chow and Hazama [28]. The
amplification was performed using the following conditions. For cyt b, 35 cycles were used: denaturation at 94°C
for 45 sec, annealing at 46°C for 1 min, and extension at
72°C for 1:30 min. A final extension at 72°C for 5 min
was performed to completely extend the amplified product. For the S7 first intron, 30 cycles were performed using
a denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 54°C for
1:30 min, and an extension at 72°C for 2 min; then, a
final extension was performed at 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products were purified with the QIAquick (QIAGEN)
kit, checked on 1% agarose gels, and sequenced using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/223

Big Dye Deoxy Terminator cycle-sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems Inc.) in an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyser. For
cyt b, chromatograms and alignments were visually
checked and the S7 sequences were aligned using Clustal
× 1.83 with default parameters [79]. All sequences were
revised and verified using MEGA 3.1 [80]. GeneBank
accession numbers are presented in Additional File 1. We
obtained the complete mitochondrial cyt b (total of 1140
bp) of 47 specimens from 25 localities (Additional File 1).
Based on at least one representative specimen from each
mitochondrial clade, we sequenced the first intron of the
ribosomal protein S7 (965 bp, including gaps) for a subset of 19 specimens from 16 localities (Additional File 1).
The cyt b matrix was increased with previously published
sequences for Algansea species (Schönhuth et al. [10]:
DQ324088-DQ324092).
Phylogenetic analysis
Homologous regions were aligned manually against previously published cyt b sequences of Algansea [10]. The
nucleotide composition and base frequencies were examined, and the homogeneity test of base frequencies (for
each single codon position and all the positions) was carried out for all taxa and both genes with the program
PAUP 4.1 [81]. Furthermore, the saturation of transition
and transversion changes was checked for each gene by
plotting the absolute number of changes of each codon
position against their patristic distances (p). There was no
evidence of saturation for any of the sequence data sets
(data not shown).

Phylogenetic analyses were carried out for both genes separately and as a combined data set using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses. The MP
analyses were performed in PAUP* version 4.1 using heuristic searches (TBR Branch swapping; MULPARS option
in effect) with 10 random stepwise additions of taxa.
Analyses of the S7 gene and combined matrix were done
including or excluding the indels.
For the BI analyses, the best-fit model for the different
genes and each codon position (for cyt b in particular)
were selected using Modeltest 3.7 [32] based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Bayesian analyses were
performed in MrBayes 3.1.2 [82], using two independent
runs of four Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) of 1,000,000 generations each to estimate
the posterior probability distribution. The combined
sequence matrices were partitioned per gene fragment,
and independent model parameters were estimated for
each partition. Topologies were sampled every 100 generations. Once the average standard deviation of split frequencies was less than 0.01, as suggested by MrBayes 3.1.2
[82], convergence between runs was checked. This was
accomplished by comparing the 50% majority rule consensus tree for each run (after discarding the first 20,000,
Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:223

25,000 and 10,000 generations for the cyt b, S7, and combined gene data sets, respectively), and no incongruence
between the runs were found.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/223

removing 10% of the generations from each analysis as
"burn-in", the ESS exceeded 210 for all parameters.

Authors' contributions
The robustness of the clades was assessed using bootstrapping (1,000 pseudoreplicates) for the MP analyses and
Bayesian posterior probabilities for the BI analyses.
The ancestral character-state reconstruction of the evolution of some of the morphological characters consisted of
a subset of nine characters from a data matrix of twentysix characters used in Barbour and Miller's [21] and Jensen
and Barbour's [36] phylogenies (Additional File 2). These
characters were selected because they were synapomorphies supporting particular clades in those studies. The
software MacClade version 3.06 [83] was used to reconstruct character evolution.

RP-R collected the samples, carried out the molecular
work, analysed the data, and drafted the original manuscript. GP-PdL participated in the study design, contributed to the draft of the original manuscript, and
contributed to the improvement of all versions of the
manuscript. OD-D conceived the study, collected the samples, help with the analyses, and contributed to the
improvement of all versions of the manuscript. ID conceived the study, participated in its design and coordination, and contributed to the improvement of all versions
of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

Additional material
Molecular clock and divergences
The uncorrected p distances and absolute changes were
calculated using all the specimens analysed. The average p
distances between the main clades were also calculated for
both markers using the program MEGA v.3.1 [80].

A relaxed molecular clock Bayesian approach using cyt b
gene (1140 bp) was performed to infer the time to the
most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in the different
species and groups within Algansea and with respect to
Agosia. Because of the lack of reliable fossil records for the
genus Algansea, a molecular clock of 1.05% per million
year, which has been established for cyt b in North American Phoxinini by Dowling et al. [84] and widely applied
to Euro Asiatic cyprinids [85-89], was used. The molecular
clock was used to i) estimate the divergence times of the
main cladogenetic events implicated in the origin and
diversification of Algansea and ii) test if these estimates are
in agreement with the historical geologic events in the
central Mexico region that may be responsible for the origin and diversification of other co-distributed groups of
fishes. Divergence times and their confidence intervals
were estimated using a relaxed clock model in BEAST
v1.4.6 [90], with a strategy that included branch rates
drawn from an uncorrelated log-normal distribution [91].
The estimates of divergence times was done with a Yule
tree prior, the branch length substitution rate sampled
from a prior normal distribution (with a mean value of
0.010 and a standard deviation of 0.001 [92]) and
included just one representative of each species. The
TrN+G substitution model was used, and three MCMC for
90 × 106 generations were run. The remaining parameters
were set as default options and changed as recommended
by the BEAST output file. We checked for the effective
sample size (ESS) convergence and the stationary of the
different analyses in Tracer 1.4 [92] and combined the
results in the BEAST module LogCombiner 1.4.4. After
