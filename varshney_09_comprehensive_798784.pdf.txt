Abstract
Background: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), an important grain legume crop of the world is
seriously challenged by terminal drought and salinity stresses. However, very limited number of
molecular markers and candidate genes are available for undertaking molecular breeding in
chickpea to tackle these stresses. This study reports generation and analysis of comprehensive
resource of drought- and salinity-responsive expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and gene-based
markers.
Results: A total of 20,162 (18,435 high quality) drought- and salinity- responsive ESTs were
generated from ten different root tissue cDNA libraries of chickpea. Sequence editing, clustering
and assembly analysis resulted in 6,404 unigenes (1,590 contigs and 4,814 singletons). Functional
annotation of unigenes based on BLASTX analysis showed that 46.3% (2,965) had significant
similarity (≤1E-05) to sequences in the non-redundant UniProt database. BLASTN analysis of
unique sequences with ESTs of four legume species (Medicago, Lotus, soybean and groundnut) and
three model plant species (rice, Arabidopsis and poplar) provided insights on conserved genes
across legumes as well as novel transcripts for chickpea. Of 2,965 (46.3%) significant unigenes, only
2,071 (32.3%) unigenes could be functionally categorised according to Gene Ontology (GO)
descriptions. A total of 2,029 sequences containing 3,728 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were
identified and 177 new EST-SSR markers were developed. Experimental validation of a set of 77
SSR markers on 24 genotypes revealed 230 alleles with an average of 4.6 alleles per marker and

average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.43. Besides SSR markers, 21,405 high
confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 742 contigs (with ≥ 5 ESTs) were also
identified. Recognition sites for restriction enzymes were identified for 7,884 SNPs in 240 contigs.
Hierarchical clustering of 105 selected contigs provided clues about stress- responsive candidate
genes and their expression profile showed predominance in specific stress-challenged libraries.
Conclusion: Generated set of chickpea ESTs serves as a resource of high quality transcripts for
gene discovery and development of functional markers associated with abiotic stress tolerance that
will be helpful to facilitate chickpea breeding. Mapping of gene-based markers in chickpea will also
add more anchoring points to align genomes of chickpea and other legume species.

Background
Chickpea is a member of the Leguminosae family, which
includes 18,000 species, grouped into 650 genera [1]
grown in semi-arid regions of the world. Chickpea, the
world's third most important food legume is grown in
over 40 countries representing eight geographically
diverse agro-climatic conditions. In addition to being a
major source of protein for human food in semi-arid tropical regions, chickpea crop plays an important role in the
maintenance of soil fertility, particularly in the dry,
rainfed areas [2,3]. The crop is a self-pollinated diploid
(2x = 2n = 16 chromosomes) with a relatively small
genome size of around 740 Mb [4]. Considering the small
genome size, short seed-to-seed reproductive cycle of
approximately three months and most importantly high
economic importance as a food crop legume, chickpea is
an interesting system for genomics research.
Majority of the world's chickpea is grown in South Asia
and India being the largest producer with an estimated
annual production of 5.9 million tonnes (mt). Total
world production averages up to 9.3 mt [5], but there
remains a gap between demand and supply due to the
losses in the productivity caused by various abiotic and
biotic stresses. Global annual production losses due to
abiotic stresses alone are estimated to be around 3.7 mt,
which amounts to 40-60% average loss.
Drought and salinity are two of the most important abiotic stresses that alter plant water status and severely limit
plant growth and development. Drought causes a considerable (~50%) annual yield losses. Chickpea often suffers
from terminal drought which delays flowering and affects
yield. Plants adapt to drought stress either through escape,
avoidance or tolerance mechanisms. Tolerating drought
by developing deep root systems has been observed in
chickpea [6]. Salinity is no less an important constraint for
chickpea yield reduction. The continued depletion of
ground water level and demand for irrigation has led to
the salinization of arable lands. Hence, it is imperative to
develop sustainable cultivars tolerant to drought and
salinity. Factors such as high morphological and narrow
genetic variation of the chickpea make it difficult to pro-

duce superior cultivars with durable resistance to the
biotic and abiotic stresses through conventional breeding
approaches. In this context, molecular markers or genes
associated with resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic
stresses should facilitate breeding practices by using
marker-assisted selection [7]. In crop such as chickpea,
where limited genomic resources are available, identification of stress-responsive genes can be undertaken by generating expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from stresschallenged tissues. EST sequencing projects have been
contributing to gene discovery and marker development
e.g. simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as providing insights into
the complexities of gene expression patterns and functions of transcripts in several crop species [8]. In the case
of chickpea, however only a limited number of ESTs
(7,097 ESTs at the time of analysis as of March 2008) are
available in the public domain [9]. Very recently a set of
80,238 chickpea sequences of 26 bp have been added
through SuperSAGE technique [10]. However, lack of
availability of a chickpea reference genome limits the
value of SuperSAGE tags, as only a fraction of them could
be annotated.
In view of the above, the present study was undertaken to
generate a comprehensive resource of drought- and salinity-responsive ESTs in chickpea with following specific
objectives: (i) to generate drought-responsive ESTs from
water-stressed root tissues of both drought-tolerant and
drought-sensitive genotypes, (ii) to generate salinityresponsive ESTs from root tissues of NaCl treated plants of
salinity-tolerant and salinity-sensitive genotypes, (iii) to
identify unigenes of chickpea based on ESTs generated in
this study as well as public domain ESTs, (iv) to functionally annotate the identified chickpea unigenes, (v) to
identify correlated expression between genes, and (vi) to
discover SSRs and SNPs for developing potential markers.

Results
The relative effects of drought and salinity on the growth
pattern were observed in all the objectives of the study.
The growth of the drought-tolerant genotype (ICC 4958)
was observed to be better compared to drought-sensitive

genotype (ICC 1882) in all the cases of drought stress
implications. Similarly, the salinity-sensitive genotype
(ICCV 2) exhibited a relatively more stunted growth pattern than salinity-tolerant genotype (JG 11) when these
genotypes were exposed to salinity stress. It was observed
that the genotype JG 11 withstood salt stress (80 mM) to
a greater extent in comparison to ICCV 2. However, when
compared to the control set of plants in each case, growth
of stressed plants was decreased. Root tissues from both
drought and saline stressed plants were harvested for total
RNA extraction and subsequent cDNA library construction.
Generation of drought- and salinity-responsive ESTs
A set of four genotypes i.e. ICC 4958 (drought-tolerant),
ICC 1882 (drought-sensitive), JG 11 (salinity-tolerant)
and ICCV 2 (salinity-sensitive) that represent parents of
two mapping populations i.e. ICC 4958 × ICC 1882 and
JG 11 × ICCV 2 segregating for tolerance to drought and
salinity, respectively, were employed for generating ESTs.
A total of 10 cDNA libraries including 8 from drought
challenged tissues and 2 from salinity challenged tissues
were generated. By using the Sanger sequencing approach,
5,982 and 5,922 ESTs were generated from ICC 4958 and
ICC 1882 cDNA libraries. Similarly, 3,798 and 4,460 ESTs
were generated from cDNA libraries derived from salinity
stressed root tissues of JG 11 and ICCV 2, respectively.
Details of EST generation from different cDNA libraries
are given in Figure 1. In brief, a total of 20,162 ESTs were
generated and after a stringent screening for shorter and
poor quality sequences, 18,435 high quality ESTs were
obtained. The average length of these high quality ESTs
was 569 bp. All EST sequences were deposited in the
dbEST division of GenBank (GR390696-GR410171 and
GR420430-GR421115).
EST assembly
Assembly analyses was done for different datasets of ESTs
to define the unigenes for (a) drought-responsive ESTs,
(b) salinity-responsive ESTs, (c) drought- and salinityresponsive ESTs, and (d) the entire set of chickpea ESTs
including those from the public domain. These unigene
(UG) sets are referred to UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV,
respectively. The UG-I comprised of 4,558 unigenes (763
contigs and 3,795 singletons) based on cluster analysis of
10,996 high quality drought-responsive ESTs. Likewise,
the UG-II included 2,595 unigenes (945 contigs and
1,650 singletons) after cluster analysis of 7,439 high quality salinity-responsive ESTs. Based on the clustering of all
the18, 435 high quality ESTs generated in this study, the
UG-III was defined with 6,404 unigenes (1,590 contigs
and 4,814 singletons). Detailed cluster analysis of the
18,435 ESTs identified 1,855 (10.06%) unique to ICC
4958, 1,606 (8.71%) to ICC 1882, 967 (5.24%) to JG 11
and 386 (2.09%) to ICCV 2. Inclusion of 7,097 ESTs available in the public domain at the time of analysis (as of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/523

March 2008), the entire set of chickpea ESTs (including
18,435 high quality ESTs generated in the present study
and 7,097 available in public domain), the UG-IV was
defined with 9,569 unigenes (2,431 contigs and 7,138
singletons). The assembly size in terms of number of ESTs
aligned in each contig varied from 2 EST members (587
contigs) to 874 EST members (1 contig) with an average
of 8.56 (Figure 2).
Sequence annotation
Sequence annotation was performed for all four unigene
datasets (i.e. UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV) using standalone BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms. For BLASTN
analysis, significant similarity was considered at threshold
E-value of ≤1E-05. BLASTN similarity search for all the
four unigene datasets was carried out against ESTs of
closely related legume and model plant species. For
instance, analysis of UG-III unigenes showed high similarity to Medicago (64.5%), followed by soybean (62.3%),
Lotus (50.6%), poplar (42.8%), Arabidopsis (40.9%),
groundnut (29.7%), and least to rice (27.0%). The
BLASTN similarity results across different plant species for
UG-III found 4,654 (72.6%) unigenes with significant
similarity to ESTs of atleast one analysed legume species,
3,117 (48.6%) unigenes with significant similarity to ESTs
of atleast one of the analysed model plant species and
overall 4,719 (73.6%) unigenes with significant similarity
to ESTs of atleast one of the analysed plant species. In contrast, 37 (0.5%) and 36 (0.5%) unigenes did not match
ESTs of any legume or model plant species respectively.
Results of the detailed analyses of the four unigene sets are
given in Table 1.

BLASTX search results for all four unigene sets against the
UniProt database, found varying numbers of unigenes
from different unigene sets with significant similarity at
different thresholds. For UG-III (6,404), for instance,
2,965 unigenes had significant similarity against the UniProt database at E-value ≤1E-05, 2,538 unigenes at E-value
≤1E-08 and 2,333 unigenes at E-value ≤1E-10. Based on
these findings, for further analyses of the BLASTX hits in
this study, a threshold E-value ≤1E-05 was considered.
Using this criterion, UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV had
significant similarity to 1,912 (41.94%), 1,476 (56.87%),
2,965 (46.29%), and 4,657 (48.66%) unigenes, respectively (Figure 3). Details of BLASTN and BLASTX analyses
against closely related legume and model plant EST databases and the Uniprot database for all the four unigene
sets are provided in Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Functional categorization
Transcripts with significant BLASTX homology (≤1E-05)
to annotated ESTs were further classified into functional
categories. As expected only a small percentage of unigenes (~35.2%) could be thus classified. The Gene Ontology annotation of transcripts helped classify functional

Summary of ESTs generated from drought- and salinity-responsive chickpea genotypes
Summary of ESTs generated from drought- and salinity-responsive chickpea genotypes. The figure shows a flowchart of generation and analysis of ESTs in four groups. ESTs generated and analysed for drought-responsive tissues have been
shown in A, for salinity-responsive tissues in B, all ESTs generated in this study in C, and all chickpea ESTs analysed in D. A:
Four different drought stress treatments were imposed on each of chickpea genotypes ICC 4958 and ICC 1882. Raw
sequences (RS) were trimmed to generate high quality ESTs (HQS). Cluster analysis of 10,996 sequences provided 4,558 unigenes (UG-I), B: ESTs were generated from salinity challenged root tissues of JG 11 and ICCV 2. Sequence trimming provided
7,439 high quality sequences. Clustering analysis of these sequences yielded 2,595 unigenes (UG-II), C: ESTs generated from
four genotypes as shown in A and B were analysed together that provided a set of 6,404 unigenes (UG-III), D: ESTs generated
in this study were analysed together with 7,097 public domain ESTs. Clustering and assembly analysis resulted in 9,569 unigenes
(UG-IV) for chickpea.

descriptions into three principal ontologies: molecular
function, biological process and cellular component. Like
in earlier studies of this nature [11], one gene product
could be assigned to more than one multiple parental categories. Thus, the total number of GO mappings in each
of the three ontologies exceeded the number of unigenes
analysed. Details on GO analyses for all four unigene sets
are provided in Additional files 5, 6, 7 and 8. As an example, GO analysis has been described below for one unigene set (UG-III).
The GO analysis of 2,965 (46.3%) unigenes from UG-III
set (those with a significant hit in BLASTX analysis)
revealed that 2,071 (32.3%) unigenes had GO descrip-

tions for gene products: 1,684 were categorised under biological process, 1,586 under cellular component and
1,662 under molecular function. Of the functionally categorised unigenes, the largest proportion fell into cell part
(1,528) followed by cellular process (1,284), nucleotide
binding (1,171), metabolic process (1,140), organelle
(1,048), catalytic activity (876) and response to stimulus
(371) categories. Unigenes with significant similarity that
could not be classified into any of the categories were
grouped as 'unclassified'. Unigenes coding for housekeeping functions such as cellular process and metabolic process in the biological process ontology, cell part and
organelle part in the cellular component ontology, and
genes with binding and catalytic activity in molecular

function category are over-represented in similar proportion in all unigene datasets (Figure 4). Enzyme Commission IDs were also retrieved from the UniProt database, to
get an overview of the distribution of transcripts putatively annotated to be enzymes. The three largest groups
of enzyme classes included transferases, hydrolases and
oxidoreductases with 208 (27.9%), 206 (27.7%) and 183
(24.6%), respectively. The distribution pattern of
enzymes was observed to be similar across all four unigene datasets.

9). The cluster analysis showed higher number of differentially expressed genes in salinity libraries as compared to
drought libraries. Furthermore as suggested by Mantri and
colleagues [13], more transcripts were observed in severe
stress-challenged libraries. In general, the cluster analysis
revealed high expression of genes related to biotic stress
signaling (20.9%), drought response (7.6%), transporter
proteins (6.6%), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging (4.7%) and transcriptional, translational regulation
(6.6%) and uncharacterised proteins (7.6%) categories.

Correlated gene expression pattern analysis
To understand the patterns of gene expression and correlations between the 10 libraries from which ESTs were
generated, the contigs generated in UG-III set were analyzed using the R Stekel statistical test [12] of IDEG.6 tool
to identify the most significant expression and large differences in the abundances of ESTs in each contig. Of 1,590
total contigs in this dataset, only 105 returned a true positive significance (R>8) and were used for hierarchical
clustering analysis. The expression level of each gene/contig (relative EST counts across all the libraries) has been
graphically represented by a colour/heat map (Figure 5).

In addition, the clustering of different libraries was also
analysed. The grouping/clustering of the 10 libraries was
found consistent with their origin and genotypes. For
instance, libraries were clustered into two main clades/
clusters according to drought and salinity treatments. ICC
4958_Drought_Field and ICC 1882_Drought_Field
libraries were grouped into the first clade, while the
remaining libraries were grouped into second clade. The
second clade was further divided into 2 clusters with both
consisting of homogeneously segregating drought related
libraries, while JG 11_Salinity and ICCV 2_Salinity cDNA
libraries clustered heterogeneously within the hierarchical
cluster. In both clades, libraries generated from similar
conditions tended to cluster together, regardless of the
genotype from which they derived, thus reflecting their
relationship.

The expression profile of the 105 contigs with significant
expression and their derivative libraries were classified
into four major clusters (I-IV, represented in different colour bars) with the minimum similarity of 0.5 using HCE
version 2.0 beta web tool. On the basis of their high
expression level in a specific library, cluster II and III were
further sub-clustered (IIa, IIb, IIc, IIIa IIIb, IIIc and IIId)
that contained 3 (subcluster IIa) to 23 contigs (subcluster
IIIa and IIId) representing different genes (Additional file

Development of functional markers

from genes/ESTs and are popularly referred to as genic

Functional annotation of chickpea unigenes
Functional annotation of chickpea unigenes. All four unigene groups (UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV) were used for
BLASTX analysis. Total hits (i.e. unigenes that showed similarity with the UniProt database sequences at E-value below or
above IE-05) as well as significant hits at three different thresholds (≤1E-05, ≤1E-08 and ≤IE-10) for all the four unigene sets
have been shown. Values against each bar represent number of unigenes showing significant annotations to sequences in the
UniProt database at different E-value thresholds.

however, were monomeric repeats (1,793). Among other
classes of SSRs, 126 dimeric SSRs, 110 trimeric SSRs, 7
tetrameric SSRs, 8 pentameric SSRs and 5 hexameric SSRs
were also present (Table 2). Out of 3,728 SSRs, primer
pairs were generated for 1,222 SSRs. After excluding the
primers for monomeric repeats, a set of 177 primer pairs
were considered. Considering minimum repeat number
criteria such as six for di- and tri- nucleotides and four for
tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides, a sub-set of primer
pairs were developed for only 77 SSRs.
The potential of 77 SSR markers for detection of polymorphism was assessed on a set of 24 chickpea genotypes. Out
of 77 primer pairs, 50 primer pairs yielded scorable amplicons. These SSR markers provided 1 (ICCeM0004,
ICCeM0031, ICCeM0042, ICCeM0059 and ICCeM0073)
to 12 (ICCeM0013, ICCeM0054 and ICCeM0055) alleles
with an average of 4.6 alleles per marker. Only 45 primer
pairs had more than one allele in the genotypes examined.
The polymorphic markers showed a PIC value in the range
of 0.08 to 0.86 with an average of 0.43 (Table 3).

Identification of SNPs
As large number of ESTs were generated from four genotypes, these EST datasets were analysed for identification
of SNPs. SNP discovery was performed on contigs/multiple sequence alignments (MSA) containing two or more
ESTs from more than one genotype. Out of 2,431 contigs
(UG-IV), SNPs were detected in 2,047 contigs, while 384
did not have any SNP. A total of 36,086 SNPs were identified in 2,047 contigs. While 14,681 (40%) SNPs were
identified in 1,305 contigs with 2-4 ESTs, the remaining
21,405 SNPs were identified in 742 contigs composed of
5 or more ESTs.

In order to perform cost-effective and robust genotyping
assay for the 21,405 SNPs detected in 742 contigs,
attempts were made to identify the restriction enzymes
that can be used to assay SNPs via cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) assays. The analysis suggested
that 7,884 SNPs could be assayed in 240 contigs by CAPS
methods (Table 4).

Figure 4 categorization of chickpea unigenes
Functional
Functional categorization of chickpea unigenes. Functional categorization of 2,071 unigenes (UG-III) derived from ESTs
generated in this study under three main categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function.

Discussion
A number of drought-responsive and salinity-responsive
genes have been identified, cloned and characterized from
an array of plant species and notably in model plant species such as Medicago [19], Arabidopsis [20], rice [21], soybean [22], Lotus [23] and poplar [24], etc. In contrast, in
case of chickpea, where crop production is adversely
affected by drought and salinity, not much information is
available on candidate genes or molecular markers associated with tolerance/resistance to these stresses. This study
attempted to develop a comprehensive transcriptomics
resource of chickpea.
cDNA libraries, ESTs and unigenes
Plant roots are the primary sites for perception and injury
during water stress, including salinity and drought. In
many circumstances, it is the stress sensitivity of the root
that limits the productivity of the entire plant [25,26].
Plants are known to use more than one mechanism to
resist unfavourable environmental conditions. For example, under drought conditions, plants may 'escape' the
stress by undergoing rapid phenological development,
completing their lifecycle before the onset of serious water
deficit [27] or 'avoid' the stress by maintaining relatively
high tissue water potential even at low soil-moisture content, balancing between water loss and turgor [28]. Therefore, root tissues were targeted for generating the drought
and salinity-responsive ESTs in the present study.

With an objective of compiling as many drought-responsive and salinity-responsive ESTs as possible, different
kinds of drought stress treatments (Polyethylene glycol
(PEG) induction, dehydration, slow drought stress (dry
down) in greenhouse and slow drought stress in field conditions) were imposed on drought-responsive genotypes,
while salinity-responsive genotypes were stressed using 80
mM NaCl. This study provided 20,162 ESTs, 4,558
drought-responsive unigenes (UG-I), 2,595 salinityresponsive unigenes (UG-II), and a total of 9,569 chickpea unigenes (UG-IV). This is the first report on the generation of such large number of ESTs based on Sanger
sequencing in chickpea. In the past, ESTs have been generated at ICRISAT [29] and by other research groups that
represented a total of 7,097 ESTs in the public domain at
the time of analysis in March 2008 [9]. Thus the present
study contributes a 3 fold increase in ESTs.
Characterization of chickpea unigenes
Four sets of unigenes were characterized in terms of their
similarity with ESTs from other legume species available
in the public domain and to deduce a putative function
and assign them to a particular GO class. All the four unigene sets showed highest similarity with Medicago
(58.8%-81.9%) and least similarity with groundnut
(27.3%-41.0%). Other legume species showed similarity
with chickpea unigenes in the range of 44.3% - 79.6% as
shown in Table 1. The similarity of chickpea unigenes

Clustered correlation map of differentially expressed genes under stress. Hierarchial clustering of ESTs representing
genes involved in drought- and salinity- stress responses was done using HCE version 2.0 beta web tool. The dendrogram on
top illustrates the relationship among 10 cDNA libraries: 1. ICC 4958_PEG_Induction, 2. ICC 4958_Dehydration, 3. ICC

ESTs (normalized using R statistics, R>8) into four major clusters (indicated by vertical colour bars) were further subclustered
into nine groups based on library specificity (I, IIa, IIb, IIc, IIIa, IIIb, IIIc, IIId and IV). A colour map/heat map with red representing normalized expression values greater than the mean, green colour representing expression less than the mean and colour
intensities in between representing the magnitude of the deviation from the mean can be observed. Colour scale (from green
to red) represents the range of expression level.

with other legume species is in general agreement with
legume phylogenetic tree displaying relative order of speciation [30,31]. Medicago is the most closely related species in the phylogenetic tree which explains the larger
number of significant hits with Medicago sequences. There
were some exceptions however; chickpea unigenes
showed higher similarity to soybean (65.8%) as compared to Lotus (53.3%) whereas the phylogenetic distance
between chickpea and Lotus is less than it is with soybean.
The smaller EST dataset available in Lotus (183,153) as
compared to soybean (880,561) is probably responsible
for this observation.
While analysing sequence similarity of compiled chickpea
unigenes (UG-IV) with other legume species, 7,815
(81.6%) unigenes had significant similarity to ESTs of at
least one analysed legume species. Conservation of 552
(5.7%) unigenes across the legume species was observed.
Sequence comparison of UG-IV unigenes with other plant
species i.e. rice, poplar and Arabidopsis showed 5,088
(53.1%) unigenes sharing significant similarity with ESTs
of atleast one of the model plant species and 1,742
(18.2%) conserved across all three model plant species,
while 283 (2.9%) of total chickpea unigenes shared significant similarity with ESTs of all the plant species analysed.
This suggests that 283 (2.9%) chickpea unigenes can be
considered conserved in plants; 552 (5.7%) unigenes can
be considered conserved across legumes. It is also interesting to note that 53 (0.5%) chickpea unigenes did not
show any homology with any of the legume EST datasets
searched. This indicates that at least 53 (0.5%) new unigenes without legume homologs in the public domain
have been contributed to through this study. About 38
(0.3%) chickpea unigenes did not show any similarity
with sequences from any of the plant species EST datasets
searched or UniProt database and may thus be considered
novel.
In terms of BLASTX analysis, a putative function could be
deduced for 2,965 (UG-III) of 6,404 unigenes and 2,071

could be functionally categorised based on ESTs generated
in this study. Analysis of the entire chickpea unigene set
(UG-IV) revealed that only 3,147 (32.8%) out of 9,569
unigenes could be functionally categorised. The functional annotation will be very useful in selecting unigenes
for developing microarray or functional molecular markers [32,33].
The functional categorization of each unigene dataset into
GO categories revealed a similar percentage distribution
of genes in the four categories: cellular process, metabolic
process, binding and catalytic activity. These four functional categories described were also reported as major
categories in Arabidopsis [20], rice [34], tomato [35] and
also in barley [33].
Clustering analysis to identify patterns of gene expression
Clustering analysis identified patterns of gene expression
which are unique to different libraries. The profiles of
some of the interesting gene families and genes that could
play an important role in stress response were investigated
(Figure 5).

The majority of the genes in cluster I (containing 22 contigs)
are
those
highly
expressed
in
ICC
1882_Drought_GH library. Apart from very highly represented 'Isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase 9' (7 IOMT-9)
(UniProt ID: O22309, 93 transcripts), an isoflavanoid
biosynthetic enzyme which plays a role in plant resistance
to pathogens [36], many transcripts with putative annotations to nucleic acid binding, protein binding activity
classes were co-expressed in this cluster. Two un-annotated contigs (Contig640 and Contig720) identified in
this cluster were considerably expressed in ICC
1882_Drought_GH library with transcript numbers of
150 and 449, respectively. Considering the expression
ratio difference of these uncharacterised proteins, further
studies may reveal their possible role during stress conditions in plants.
The sub-cluster IIa contains genes specifically expressed in
the ICC 4958_dehydration root library. Two contigs
homologous to the biotic stress-responsive 'probable pleiotropic drug resistance' (PDR) protein (UniProt ID:
Q7PC86) and 'phenylalanine ammonia-lyase' (PAL)
(UniProt ID: P45732) were identified. Both PDR and PAL
are involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavanoid/isoflavanoid pathways leading to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants in response to various biotic and abiotic
stresses [37,38]. The relative transcript counts of PDR and
PAL signify their associated role in stress signaling processes.
The gene coding for 'dead ringer protein homolog' (UniProt ID: Q8MQH7) was found to be highly induced in

ICC 1882_PEG_Induction library of subcluster IIb. Functionally, these proteins protect other proteins from denaturation by heat [39]. Their up-regulation in the drought
tolerant genotype suggests a significant role in imparting
tolerance against drought.

All 23 contigs in the sub-cluster IIIa were highly expressed
in the ICCV2_Salinity library. UniProt classification of
these contigs indicated that a large fraction of them (11)
were involved in cellular processes and nine contigs
homologous to different stress related proteins. 'ABA

responsive' (ABR) related transcripts were observed higher
in drought- and salinity-sensitive genotype specific libraries such as ICC 1882_PEG and JG 11_Salinity libraries.
Higher accumulation of ABR transcript levels has been
reported in stressed plants [40]. Similarly, high accumulations of 'heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein' (HSP70s)
(UniProt ID: P27322) was observed in stress-sensitive
genotype related ICCV2_Salinity root library as compared
to JG 11_Salinity and ICC 1882_Drought_Glasshouse
libraries. This implies a significant role of 'HSPs' in protecting the plant cells during abiotic stresses. Interestingly,
the co-expression of Contig773, Contig1406 and
Contig1457 corresponding to 'NAD(P)H-dependent 6deoxychalcone synthase' (UniProt ID; P26690), 'Isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase 9' (UniProt ID; O22309) and
'Isoflavone reductase' (UniProt ID; Q00016), respectively
were observed in the subcluster IIIa. All these genes were
involved in the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway and isoflavanoid phytoalexin has been reported to occur principally in legumes during defence response of plants [41].
The sub-cluster IIIb represents genes that are highly
expressed in the ICC 1882_dehydration library, accounting for 7.6% of all contigs in the hierarchial cluster. Six out
of eight genes co-expressed in this cluster have been putatively annotated and categorized to stress response related
genes. Contigs coding for 'dehydrin' DHN3 (Contig91)
(UniProt ID: P28461) and hydrophilic 'late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein 1' (UniProt ID: Q49816;
Q49817) (Contig638 and 534) were co-expressed in this
cluster. Involvement of LEA-1 genes has been reported
during seed development at low water potentials [42]. The
presence of protective compound such as 'sugar transport
protein 13' (UniProt ID: Q94AZ2) during water stress
conditions [43] in this cluster suggests a protective reaction to osmotic stress in sensitive genotypes as compared
with tolerant genotypes. Similarly, the occurrence of 'glycine-rich cell wall proteins' (GRPs) (UniProt ID: A3C5A7)
involved in cell wall lignification during pathogen attack
[13,44], 'pathogenesis-related protein 1A/1B precursor'
(UniProt ID: P32937) and 'chitinase-3-like protein 4 pre-

cursor' (UniProt ID: Q91Z98) in this cluster signifies their
protective role during stress response. These observations
suggest the possible involvement of the above mentioned
genes in protection and repair of damaged cell walls
caused under stress.
The sub-cluster IIId includes 23 (21.9%) contigs whose
transcripts are highly expressed in both the ICC
4958_Drought_Field
library
and
ICC
1882_Drought_Field library and also contains a majority
of stress-responsive functionally important genes. Up-regulation of membrane spanning genes such as 'probable
aquaporin PIP-type' (UniProt ID: P25794; Q9ATM4),
which mediate regulation of root hydraulic conductivity
in response to environmental stimuli [45] were observed
also in ICCV2_Salinity library as well as their significant
expression in the other two libraries mentioned above
and is not unexpected since its involvement is well
reported in plant drought stress response. It is noteworthy
that the transcripts annotating to 'metallothionein- like
proteins' (MTs) (UniProt ID: Q39458, Q39459, Q9SSK5)
involved in heavy metal detoxification and accumulate in
response to high metal concentration, nutrient deprivation and heat shock [46], identified in this cluster were
highly expressed in ICC 4958_Drought_Field library and
even more so in ICCV 2_Salinity library. Their high
expression level in the ICCV 2_Salinity library may be correlated with their putative role in detoxification of salts
accumulated in salinity stressed roots. Contigs similar to
classical 'arabinogalactan proteins' (AGPs) (UniProt ID:
Q9ZT16), abundant in the plant cell wall and plasma
membrane [47] were identified to be highly expressed in
the ICC 4958_Drought_Field library. 'Fasciclin like Arabinogalactans' (FLAs) is a class of AGPs known to be regulated both during developmental processes and stress
responses. Different classes of FLAs have been associated
with ABA and down-regulated by drought stress [48].
Likewise, a high copy number of transcripts corresponding to the ABR gene (UniProt ID: Q06931) were highly
expressed in ICC 1882_Drought_Field library (423 transcripts), ICC 4958_Drought_Field library (291 transcripts) and moderately expressed in ICCV 2_Salinity
library (55 transcripts). The predicted expression pattern
of AGPs and ABRs identified in this study is also consistent with experimental observations in Arabidopsis [47].
It is important to note that although a high number of
transcripts annotated to genes known to be involved in
stress responses have been identified in clusters IIb, IIc,
IIIc and IV, their functional inter-relativity could not be
explained. In addition, many uncharacterised and
unknown proteins with significant expression levels have
also been identified in these clusters. Further investigation
of these genes is required to understand their importance
in stress signaling and/or tolerance mechanisms in chick-

pea. Although these genes have been identified in
response to abiotic stress, many of these genes are likely to
be involved in conferring resistance to biotic stresses as
well, since a crosstalk between signal transduction occurring during biotic and abiotic stress is well known phenomenon [13]. In summary, these candidate genes will be
very useful to integrate in genetic maps and link them
with QTLs for abiotic/biotic stress tolerance as well as targeting them in genetic engineering or reverse genetics
approaches.
Transcriptome resource for developing functional markers
The chickpea unigene dataset (9,569) (UG-IV) defined in
the present study can be used to develop a variety of
molecular markers as stated by Varshney and colleagues
[14]. In case the polymorphism detected by a particular
type of molecular marker correlates with variation in coding region affecting gene function, the molecular marker
could become a candidate marker for a trait of interest.

Mining of 9,569 unigenes (UG-IV) showed occurrence of
3,728 SSRs, however majority of these SSRs represent
mononucleotide repeats (1,793). This is a common feature of database mining of ESTs for identification of SSRs
[16,49]. After excluding the monomeric SSRs, higher proportion of SSRs was dominated by dimeric SSRs (126) followed by trimeric SSRs (110). In general, studies dealing
with mining of ESTs for SSRs reported higher abundance
of trimeric SSRs [16,50], however there are several studies
[51] that show exceptions as well. Indeed the number and
distribution of SSRs of a particular class also depends on
the criteria and tool used for mining the ESTs [16].
In terms of converting identified SSRs into potential SSR
markers for chickpea genetics and breeding, primer pairs
could be designed for 177 SSRs (Additional file 10). This
increases the repertoire of SSR markers available in chickpea [14]. The EST-SSR markers developed in this study
were compared with those developed earlier and available
in public domain [e.g.[52-55]] so that only non-redundant set of SSR markers should be developed. As a result,
for validation purpose, only 77 SSR primer pairs with preferred criteria were synthesized. Fifty of these newly developed SSR markers on 24 chickpea lines, had varied alleles
(average 4.6 per marker) per locus with an average PIC
value of 0.43 per marker. This suggests a moderate discriminatory power of this new set of SSR markers. Dinucleotide SSRs (ICCeM0011, ICCeM0046, ICCeM0048,
ICCeM0035, ICCeM0051, ICCeM0063 and ICCeM0033)
with atleast 12 repeat units and compound motifs
(ICCeM0013, ICCeM0054 and ICCeM0055) had relatively higher number of alleles (7-12) and high PIC values
ranging from 0.73 to 0.86. Such correlation between
number of alleles, maximum number of repeat units and
PIC value has been observed in other earlier studies [56].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/523

The present study also provided 36,086 SNPs in 2,047
unigenes that can be used for converting into SNP markers. SNPs are the most abundantly found co-dominant
polymorphic sites in greater proportion both in intronic
and exonic regions of the genomes, occurring with variable frequencies and becoming very popular in plant genetics and breeding due to their amenability for high
throughput genotyping. EST mining has been a popular
approach for large scale identification of SNPs [57]. However, the error rates in EST sequencing may sometime lead
to erroneous SNP calls. Therefore, to enhance more reliability of SNPs identified, deep multiple alignments (=5
reads per contig containing SNP) were considered. In case
of chickpea, although a few SNP markers have been
reported [58,59], the present study, probably provides the
first comprehensive set of SNPs for chickpea. Although
high-throughput SNP genotyping platform such as GoldenGate assay of Illumina are available that allows genotyping of large number of SNPs (e.g. 1,536) in parallel
[60], conversion of SNPs into CAPS assay is a cost effective
method that can be used in low-tech laboratories [61].
The present study provides 240 candidate genes where
SNPs can be assayed by CAPS.

Conclusion
In summary, the present study provides 20,162 new
chickpea ESTs (6,404 unigenes) including 11,904 ESTs
(4,558 unigenes) from drought challenged libraries and
8,258 ESTs (2,595 unigenes) from salinity challenged
libraries. Including the 7,097 public domain chickpea
ESTs in the analysis defined chickpea unigenes to 9,569.
Five hundred and fifty two (5.7%) chickpea unigenes were
conserved across legume species, 283 (2.9%) conserved
across analysed plant species and 38 (0.39%) unigenes
were specific to chickpea. This study provides an overview
of expression patterns of 105 contigs/genes that were upor down-regulated in response to imposed abiotic
stresses, validated either by over expression or TILLING
(Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes). These
genes together with 177 SSR markers and 742 genes with
SNPs provide a comprehensive resource for integration
and development of the transcript map of chickpea. The
EST resource generated in this study will significantly
impact chickpea genetics, and breeding in general and for
improving the crop for drought and salinity tolerance in
particular.

Methods
Drought stress treatments
Two chickpea genotypes, ICC 4958 (drought tolerant)
and ICC 1882 (drought sensitive), parents of a mapping
population segregating for drought tolerance were
selected. Four drought stress treatments were imposed to
target wide expression profiles associated with drought:
(i) PEG induction, (ii) dehydration, (iii) slow drought

(dry down) under greenhouse conditions and (iv) slow
drought under field conditions, to generate four libraries
for each drought-responsive genotype.
In order to capture and study various drought-responsive
ESTs, the two chickpea genotypes, ICC 4958 and ICC
1882 were first subjected to chemically induced dehydration stress using PEG. Various concentration of PEG such
as 50 mM, 10 mM, 5 mM and 1 mM were evaluated for
optimizing a slow drought stress that would mimic the
field drought condition in these two chickpea genotypes
grown in hydroponic solution under greenhouse condition (data not shown). PEG concentrations of 50 mM and
10 mM were lethal. The relative water contents (RWC) in
roots of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882 at different time intervals
in other two treatments suggested a slower drought stress
effect at 1 mM concentration than at 5 mM. Finally, a slow
drought stress was imposed using 1 mM PEG and the
intensity of the drought stress was assessed by recording
the transpiration ratio (TR) on a daily basis. Root samples
from the PEG-stressed plants of the two genotypes were
harvested when the transpiration ratio reached 0.1. Here,
in this study we recognized a relatively rapid stress imposition taking place with PEG treatment which hardly
reflects the kinetics of stress imposition of the natural
environment. Simultaneously, dehydration stress was
imposed on another set of plants grown under similar
growth conditions by removing the hydroponic solution
from their trays and root samples were harvested when
the relative water content (RWC) of these plant were
observed between 50-60%. With another set of pot grown
plants, a dry down experiment was conducted under
greenhouse conditions as described by Ray and Sinclair
[62] with 10 treatment and 10 control plants per genotype. Pots were allowed to dry through transpirational
water loss until the TR reached 0.1. At this stage root samples were harvested from stress plants of each of the two
genotypes. The slow drought stress under field conditions
was conducted in a rain out shelter by sowing 10 seeds of
the two chickpea genotypes in 8 inch pots containing a
mixture of soil and sand (1:1). Drought stress was
imposed when the plants reached 20-22 days old seedling
stage. The root samples from the stressed plants were harvested when the TR reached 0.1 and were stored in -80°C
for RNA extraction.
Salinity stress treatment
The effect of salinity was studied in JG 11 (saline tolerant)
and ICCV 2 (saline sensitive) chickpea genotypes, which
are the parents of a mapping population segregating for
salinity. Plants of both salinity-responsive genotypes were
grown in pots (5 replicates) in greenhouse and treated
with 80 mM NaCl solution at flowering stage. After a
stress period of 5 days, root tissues from stressed plants of
both genotypes were harvested for total RNA extraction
and cDNA library construction.

Chickpea cDNA libraries and EST generation
Total RNA was extracted from root samples representing
libraries of different genotypes challenged with a range of
drought and salinity stresses, using a modified hot-acid
phenol method [63] followed by lithium chloride precipitation. The integrity and quantity of total RNA was
assessed spectrophotometrically and also by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized
using Super SMART™ PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech®,
USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
purified cDNA was ligated into pGEM® Easy vector
(Promega®, USA) using T4 DNA ligase. Subsequently the
cDNA-ligated vector was transformed by electroporation
technique, applying 260 volts for 10 milliseconds into
One Shot® Top 10 Electrocomp™ cells (Invitrogen, USA).
The transformed cells were incubated in LB medium at
37°C for 1 hour at 220 rpm. Subsequently, the transformed cells were plated on agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL), 40 ul X-gal (20 mg/mL) and 5 ul IPTG
(200 mg/mL) and incubated at 37°C for overnight. Individual white colonies were randomly picked and transferred into 96-well plates (Nunc™, Denmark) and
incubated at 37°C for 24 h while shaken at 220 rpm. Plasmid DNA was isolated from overnight grown cultures
using an alkaline lysis method [64]. The concentration
and quality of the plasmid DNA was assessed on 1.2%
agarose gel and single pass Sanger sequencing (Macrogen
Inc., Korea and J. Craig Venter Institute) was performed
using universal M13 primer.
Sequence processing
The sequence data files' containing raw sequence reads
were subjected to two phases of screening. Primarily all
the sequences were subjected to Sequencher™ 4.0 (Gene
Codes Corporation, USA) to extract high quality regions
from the remaining adjoining potential vector regions in
the raw sequence data. A Perl script 'EST trimmer' [65] was
used to eliminate poly-A tail and low quality sequences
which had less than 100 bp. The CAP3 assembly program
[66] was used to perform subsequent steps of clustering,
sequence assembly, alignment analysis and consensus
partitioning to derive contigs and singletons. This was
done to mask the redundancy in the above libraries. In
order to assess the transcript redundancy among the generated libraries and for downstream analyses, four different unigenes datasets were generated (i) droughtresponsive ESTs from both ICC 4958 and ICC 1882 genotypes (UG-I); (ii) salinity-responsive ESTs from JG 11 and
ICCV 2 genotypes (UG-II), (iii) total ESTs derived from
both drought and salinity response generated in this study
(UG-III), and (iv) all chickpea ESTs generated including
7,097 public domain ESTs (UG-IV).
Sequence annotation
Standalone BLAST was used to obtain best matches for all
unigene sequences derived after the CAP3 assembly proPage 14 of 18

gram with a threshold E-value of ≤1E-05. BLASTN was
performed against formatted sequence databases of legume species, such as Medicago, soybean, Lotus and groundnut, and also Arabidopsis, rice and poplar ESTs
downloaded from NCBI [9]. BLASTX was performed
against the UniProt non-redundant protein database.
Functional categorization of annotated sequences
Functional assignment of unigenes was performed for all
sequences finding significant hits in the UniProt database
(≤1E-05). The Gene Ontology IDs were retrieved from the
UniProt database using keywords obtained in the BLASTX
descriptions of the most significant hits. Based on the
Gene Ontology ID, unique sequences were categorised
into three principal categories: biological processes, cellular localizations and molecular functions. Enzyme commission numbers were also extracted for corresponding
unigenes and assigned to specific biochemical pathways.
Correlated gene expression analysis
Gene expression pattern and correlation of genes
expressed in response to abiotic stress regimes in the study
were analyzed. Of 1,590 contigs (UG-III) 563 which had
at least five ESTs from all the 10 libraries were extracted for
expression profiling based on the EST counts for each
library. The data matrix was subjected to R statistics (R>8)
for identification of the most differentially expressed
genes by using the web tool IDEG6 [67,68]. As a result, of
the 563 normalized contigs only 105 contigs showed differential expression and were subsequently subjected to
hierarchical clustering using HCE version 2.0 beta web
tool [69].
Identification of EST-SSRs
For identification of SSRs in ESTs, MIcroSAtellitepearl
script [70] was used. MISA search provides information
about the type and localization of each individual microsatellite and parses the calculated primer sequences, their
sequence and melting point, melting temperature, and
expected PCR product size.
EST-SSR screening and data analysis
For assessing the potential of the newly developed ESTSSRs, the markers were screened on 24 different chickpea
accessions which were obtained from the International
Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India (Additional file 11). Seventy
seven newly synthesized M13 tailed EST-SSR primer pairs
were chosen for the study. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed in 5 μL of a mixture containing 5 ng
DNA, 2 pM of each primer, 2 mM dNTPs, 10 mM MgCl2,
and 0.1 U of Taq DNA polymerase in 1× reaction buffer
along with 2 pM dye to enable detection of the fragments
in the ABI-3700 automated sequencing system. The steps
of the PCR process are: (i) an initial denaturation step for
3 min at 94°, (ii) 5 cycles of 20 sec at 94°, 20 sec at 60°
and 30 sec at 72° (iii) 40 cycles of 94° for 20 sec, 56°C for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/523

20 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, and (iv) a final extension step
for 20 min at 72°C. Data was analysed using GeneMapper® Software v4.0. Allelic data obtained from GeneMapper analysis was submitted to Allelobin, an in-house
programme that automates the process of assigning allele
sizes to appropriate allele bins [71]. PIC value and other
marker informations were obtained using PowerMarker
v3.25 [72].
Identification of SNPs
The SNP diversity estimator, 'Divest' [73], an in house Perl
module was used to detect putative SNPs from the EST
sequences. The ESTs reported in this study are from ICC
4958, ICC 1882, JG 11, ICCV 2, while the public domain
ESTs came from Castellana, ICC 4958, Pusa 32, Pusa Pragathi and XJ-209 genotypes. The program uses CAP3
alignment output files as input to detect SNPs based on
the base redundancy in sequence alignments. SNPs thus
identified were converted to CAPS markers computationally using SNP2CAPS [74].
