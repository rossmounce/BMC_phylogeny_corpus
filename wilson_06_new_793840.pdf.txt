Abstract
Background: Genomic islands are regions of bacterial genomes that have been acquired by
horizontal transfer and often contain blocks of genes that function together for specific processes.
Recently, it has become clear that the impact of genomic islands on the evolution of different
bacterial species is significant and represents a major force in establishing bacterial genomic
variation. However, the study of genomic island evolution has been mostly performed at the
sequence level using computer software or hybridization analysis to compare different bacterial
genomic sequences. We describe here a novel experimental approach to study the evolution of
species-specific bacterial genomic islands that identifies island genes that have evolved in such a way
that they are differentially-expressed depending on the bacterial host background into which they
are transferred.
Results: We demonstrate this approach by using a "test" genomic island that we have cloned from
the Salmonella typhimurium genome (island 4305) and transferred to a range of Gram negative
bacterial hosts of differing evolutionary relationships to S. typhimurium. Systematic analysis of the
expression of the island genes in the different hosts compared to proper controls allowed
identification of genes with genera-specific expression patterns. The data from the analysis can be
arranged in a matrix to give an expression "array" of the island genes in the different bacterial
backgrounds. A conserved 19-bp DNA site was found upstream of at least two of the differentiallyexpressed island genes. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of horizontallytransferred genomic island gene expression in a broad range of Gram negative hosts. We also
present evidence in this study that the IS200 element found in island 4305 in S. typhimurium strain
LT2 was inserted after the island had already been acquired by the S. typhimurium lineage and that
this element is likely not involved in the integration or excision of island 4305.
Conclusion: The "clone-and-transfer" approach of evolutionary study identifies genes whose
expression patterns indicate the existence of genera-specific regulatory mechanisms that influence
the expression of horizontally-transferred DNA sections. The results provide key information that
can be used to facilitate the identification of these regulatory mechanisms.

Background
Genomic islands are sections of bacterial genomes that
have been acquired by horizontal transfer and are characterized by one or more of the following criteria: (1) are
absent from the identical location in closely related strains
or species; (2) contain an altered G/C content as compared to the rest of the genome; (3) inserted adjacent to a
tRNA gene "anchoring" site, (4) associated with mobile
DNA sequences such as phage, transposon, or plasmid
genes or remnants; (5) can be genetically unstable; and
(6) contain blocks of genes that work together for a specific function such as molecular transport, specialized
metabolism or host cell interactions [1-4]. The functions
of many genomic island gene clusters related to specific
phenotypes have been studied in great detail for a number
of bacteria [2,5,6]. However, the study of the evolution of
genomic islands has been mostly performed at the
sequence level using computer software to compare bacterial genomic sequences or by genomic DNA microarray
hybridization analysis [7-11].
An alternative way to study the evolution of genomic
islands would be to clone the island of interest, transfer it
to other bacterial hosts, and analyze the expression and
function of the genes once the island is established in the
new hosts. When studied in this way, we gain information
on how a given genomic island has evolved up to the current point in time. This kind of approach would allow the
researcher to ask several key questions concerning the evolution of a genomic island that are difficult or not possible
to answer with sequence analysis: (1) Have the island
genes evolved to be expressed in only the host in which
they are found or are they able to be expressed in other
bacterial hosts? (2) If the island genes are able to be
expressed in other hosts, is this a narrow range of related
hosts or a broad range of hosts? (3) Does the island consist of a combination of genes showing different host
requirements for expression? (4) Are there regulators that
direct expression of island genes in certain hosts that are
absent from other hosts? The answers to these questions
would give important insight into the evolutionary distribution of regulatory mechanisms that genomic islands
"plug-into" upon horizontal transfer to a given bacterial
host background. In certain cases, the presence or absence
of an expressed and functional genomic island is a determining factor in assigning a particular bacterium to its
species, strain type, or evolutionary lineage [4,7,9]. In
addition, knowledge gained from answers to the questions above would allow researchers to better manipulate
the useful functions contained on genomic islands for
beneficial bacterial genetic engineering purposes.
Very few studies have utilized the "clone-and-transfer"
approach described above to study genomic island evolution, and these studies have used a narrow range of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/2

closely-related strains or species as island hosts [12,13]. In
this study, we transfer a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genomic island (island STM4305) that has been
cloned onto a broad-host range vector to a wide range of
Gram negative gamma- and alpha-proteobacterial hosts.
We then test for the expression of 10 of the island genes
(contained in different transcriptional units) in the different hosts using a combination of reverse transcriptasePCR (RT-PCR) and reporter gene promoter fusions. Our
results indicate that: (1) island STM4305 contains genes
that are able to be expressed in all hosts tested and genes
that are not detectably expressed in certain hosts; and (2)
the hosts that are unable to detectably express island
STM4305 genes belong to more distantly-related alphaproteobacterial genera. This information provides experimental evidence for the existence of at least two classes of
genomic island genes: (1) those that are expressed by
mechanisms that have evolved to be utilized in a broad
range of hosts; and (2) those that have evolved to be
expressed by other mechanisms that are host-specific. The
regulatory systems that control the latter category of genes
may represent key mechanisms that serve to shape bacterial evolution by affecting the expression characteristics of
horizontally-transferred DNA. Genomic island promoter
regions that display host-specific activity, such as the ones
identified in this study, can be used as tools to identify the
regulators that drive their expression and potentially the
expression of genes in other chromosomal regions if the
regulatory system is global in nature. To our knowledge,
this is the first experimental approach to systematically
analyze genomic island gene expression in a broad range
of gamma- and alpha-proteobacterial hosts. Our present
analysis of island STM4305 also allowed us to determine
the sequence of the target site of the IS200 element found
in this island in S. typhimurium strain LT2, and we propose
that this element was inserted after the island had already
been acquired by the S. typhimurium lineage.

Results
S. typhimurium genomic island 4305
The genomic island inserted at the pheU tRNA gene in S.
typhimurium has been previously identified and is named
for the first STM ORF that is present in the island
(STM4305) [14,15]. Though the pheU tRNA is a common
site for insertion of genomic islands in different Gram
negative bacteria, the genes of the 15 kb island 4305
appear to be unique to S. typhimurium [14]. The genes of
island 4305 and adjacent chromosomal genes are listed in
Table 2. We previously cloned a 26 kb S. typhimurium
genomic region that included the entire island 4305 onto
the self-transmissible, broad-host-range plasmid R995
using the VEX-Capture technique for targeted cloning of
large chromosomal sections [16]. A map of the island and
the adjacent genes that are present in the R995 + island
4305 clone is presented in Figure 1. Note that the likely

The S. typhimurium genomic island STM4305 region. A map of the S. typhimurium genomic island STM4305 region is
depicted. The arrows (both open and black) indicate the genes of the region that have been cloned onto R995 using VEX-Capture. The black arrows indicate genes or operons whose expression has been analyzed using RT-PCR or lacZ reporter assays
in this study. The genes that comprise island STM4305 are indicated by a bracket below the map. The STM gene number is indicated below each gene. Underlined STM numbers indicate the genes to which primers were designed for RT-PCR analysis. The
brackets above the diagram indicate intergenic sections that range in size from 265 to 1658 base pairs and are likely promoter
regions. All other regions between the bold arrow genes range in size from -7 to 84 base pairs (except for a 248 bp region
between STM4318 and 4319). Note that STM4311, which is present in the sequenced S. typhimurium strain LT2, is not present
in strains Ï3339 and UK1 (see text and Figure 2. The pheU tRNA gene (STM4321) is indicated as an open box.

in this region.
The IS200 element present in island STM4305 in strain LT2
is absent from the corresponding location in strains Ï3339
and UK-1: a rare glimpse at an IS200 target site before
insertion
The sequence of island 4305 was obtained from the S.
typhimurium strain LT2 and indicates the presence of an

IS200 element inserted cleanly between the STM4310 and
STM4312 genes [15]. The STM4311 gene encodes the
transposase for the IS200 element. We cloned island 4305
from a different strain of S. typhimurium, Ï3339, which is
a mouse-passaged isolate of strain SL1344 [17]. PCR analysis of the structure of island 4305 from both LT2 and
Ï3339 indicated that there was DNA absent from the
IS200 region in strain Ï3339 (Figure 2A). Primers hybridizing to a region just 3' of STM4310 and to the 3' end of
the STM4312 ORF gave an approximately 960 bp product

for the LT2 genome as predicted, but a smaller 245 bp
product for the Ï3339 genome. The smaller PCR product
was also observed using these primers with the S. typhimurium UK-1 genome (Figure 2A). We sequenced the PCR
products obtained from Ï3339 and UK-1, and analysis of
these sequences revealed that the IS200 element was
absent from these strains and that the target site of the
IS200 element could be identified. This is significant
because the IS200 element is extremely stable and jumps
very rarely, and the number of sequenced IS200 target
sites before insertion is very rare [18,19]. Our sequence
analysis revealed that the target site consisted of three "T"
residues in the middle of an A/T rich region, and that this
target sequence was duplicated upon insertion (Figure
2B). This is very similar to the small number of IS200 target sites that have been previously characterized, though it
has been proposed that IS200 duplicates only 1 â 2 bp
upon insertion [18,19]. The ends of the IS200 element
shown in Figure 2 that are present in strain LT2 are an
exact match to other sequenced IS200 ends [18,19]. Since
island 4305 was clearly acquired by the S. typhimurium lineage before the different strain variations occurred and
since the IS200 element is highly stable once it has

inserted, we propose that the IS200 element in island
4305 inserted after the island had already been acquired
by S. typhimurium. The alternative proposal of loss of the
IS200 element after island 4305 acquisition is in our view
highly unlikely. This implies that IS200 transposase activity is not involved with integration or excision of island
4305.
Role of island STM4305 in host cell interactions
The use of the VEX-Capture system to clone island 4305
also allowed convenient lox/Cre-mediated construction of
an S. typhimurium mutant that is deleted for the island
4305 genes [16]. Since a number of S. typhimurium
genomic islands play a role in the ability of the bacteria to
interact with eukaryotic host cells and since the STM4315
gene (rtsA) has been previously demonstrated to affect S.
typhimurium invasion gene expression [20], we compared
the â island 4305 mutant to the isogenic WT parental
strain in the ability to adhere and invade the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29. Our results indicate that deletion
of island 4305 has no effect on the ability of S. typhimurium to adhere to or invade host cells (Figure 3). We also
measured the adherence and invasion of noninvasive E.

Characterization of the IS200 region of island 4305. Panel A depicts the genes STM4310, 4311, and 4312 in S. typhimurium island 4305. Gene STM4311 is the IS200 transposase that is present in strain LT2. Small arrows indicate primers that were
used to amplify the indicated region between STM4310 and 4312 in strains LT2, Ï3339, and UK-1. The DNA agarose gel displays the products from PCR reactions using the indicated primers to amplify chromosomal DNA isolated from the following
hosts: lane 1, LT2; lane 2, Ï3339; lane 3, UK-1. Lane "M" indicates a DNA size marker. Panel B depicts the STM4310 â
STM4312 region in strains Ï3339 and UK-1. Sequencing of the Ï3339 and UK-1 PCR products allowed the target site of the
IS200 element before insertion to be identified. The target site was found to be three "T" residues embedded in an A/T rich
region. Note that IS200 is a rare example of an insertion sequence that does not have exact repeats at each end. The sequence
of the ends shown here in the LT2 sequence are identical to other previously sequence IS200 elements.

island 4305 and found that the presence of island 4305
had no effect on the interaction of these bacteria with host
cells (Figure 3). We also performed the same assay using
J774 murine macrophage-like cells and found that the
deletion of island 4305 from S. typhimurium and its presence in E. coli and P. putida did not affect the survival of
these strains compared to controls over the course of a 9
hour intracellular survival assay (data not shown). Taken
together, these results indicate that island 4305 does not
contain any virulence factors that promote interactions

with eukaryotic host cells under the conditions tested
here.

synthesized, and the cDNA was used as template for PCR
amplification using primers specific to the island 4305

genes that are indicated in Figure 1 and that belong to different transcriptional units in the island. We also included
two genes just adjacent to island 4305 in our analysis,
STM4302 and STM4304. The RT-PCR analysis indicated
that all the tested genes contained in island 4305 and the
adjacent genes are detectably expressed in S. typhimurium
under the conditions used here (Figure 4). We then tested
the expression profile of the tested genes in the strain
Ï3339 â island 4305 containing the R995 + island 4305
plasmid. The strain Ï3339 â island 4305 containing R995
was used as a control. We found that the tested genes were
detectably expressed from the cloned island in S. typhimurium while no RT-PCR products were observed for the

tested island genes in the R995-containing strain (Figure
4). However, two genes that are part of the R995 vector,
trfA and korB, were detectably expressed in both the R995
and R995 + island 4305 strains. Primers hybridizing to an
intergenic region between genes STM4304 and STM4305
that is predicted to be non-transcribed were also used as a
negative control. These primers gave no RT-PCR product
in all strains tested, but did give a product when an islandcontaining DNA template was used (either Ï3339 chromosomal DNA or R995 + island 4305 plasmid DNA). The
result with gene STM4309 in this analysis is worth particular note. As compared to the other tested genes,
STM4309 gave a weakly detectable band, and this result

was observed for both the chromosomal and cloned
island R995 regions (Figure 4). Overall, the RT-PCR analysis indicates that the transcriptional profiles of the chromosomal and cloned island 4305 regions are extremely
similar.
Transfer of island STM4305 to a range of Gram negative
bacteria and analysis of island gene expression by RT-PCR
The vector used for the cloned island 4305 region, R995,
is a broad-host-range, self-transmissible plasmid. This
allowed us to study the S. typhimurium-specific island
4305 in a wide range of other Gram negative hosts to gain
information on genomic island evolution. We transferred
R995 + island 4305 to ten other Gram negative hosts

belonging to eight different genera as described in the
Materials and Methods. Five of the hosts (E. coli, P. putida,
P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and V. vulnificus) belong to the
gamma-proteobacterial group (as does S. typhimurium),
and five of the hosts (S. paucimobilis, N. capsulatum, A.
tumefaciens, R. meliloti, and R. sphaeroides) belong to the
alpha-proteobacterial group. The same strains containing
R995 were used for control comparisons. After we
obtained the desired transconjugants and confirmed the
establishment of R995 + island 4305 in the different
hosts, we used the RT-PCR analysis as described above to
determine if the tested genes are expressed in the alternative hosts. A representative example of our results is
shown in Figure 5 and a full list of the results in each host
is shown in Table 3. Some of the tested genes were
expressed in all hosts tested (STM4305 in Figure 5 is an
example). However, some genes were not detectably
expressed in certain hosts while being expressed in others
(STM4315 and STM4319 in Figure 5 are examples). The
trfA gene contained on the R995 vector was strongly
expressed in all hosts. Comparing the quantitated RT-PCR
signals of the tested genes to that of trfA in each host
allowed us to put the genes into three different expression
groups. Using a ratio of each gene signal to that of the trfA
signal, the following groups could be assigned: (1) Genes
that were readily detectable had ratios from 1.0 â 0.2; (2)
genes that were barely detectable had ratios of 0.2 â 0.02;
and (3) genes that were not detectable had ratios of less
than 0.02. These results, which can be arranged as a matrix
to give an expression "array" of the island genes in the different bacterial backgrounds, are summarized in Table 3.
A number of observations can be made by scanning this
table: (1) some of the tested genes are expressed in all
hosts tested; (2) some of the genes are not detectably
expressed in some of the hosts; and (3) the hosts that are
not able to express certain genes are not randomly distributed, but are restricted to the more distantly-related genera of the alpha-proteobacterial group. These genera,
Novosphingobium, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, and Rhodobacter, contain bacteria that are found exclusively in environmental soil and water habitats, as opposed to the other
genera that contain bacteria that can be found to interact
with mammalian cells.
Subcloning of the STM4315 and STM4318 promoter
regions into a lacZ reporter vector
To confirm our RT-PCR results and to show the utility of
subcloning genomic island promoters to express genes in
a host-specific manner, we transcriptionally fused the
STM4315 and STM4318 promoter regions (PR 4315 and
PR 4318, respectively) to a lacZ reporter on an IncQbased, broad-host-range plasmid. We then transferred
these constructs to other Gram negative hosts and assayed
lacZ expression in each host compared to a vector only
control. In the WT and â island 4305 S. typhimurium hosts,

RT-PCR analysis of cloned island 4305 gene expression in different Gram negative hosts. Representative examples
of RT-PCR analysis of cloned island 4305 and adjacent gene expression in a range of Gram negative hosts is presented. A full
catalog of the results is listed in Table 3. Lanes in the agarose gels are as described in Figure 4. The boxed pictures indicate
where expression of the tested gene is not detectable. All Gram negative hosts containing the plasmid R995 gave the expected
negative results in the RT-PCR analysis (data not shown).

PR 4318 expressed lacZ at a very high level indicating that
the subcloned promoter region is active and does not
require other island 4305 genes to function (Figure 6). We
also constructed a lacZ fusion in which the STM4318 promoter region was deleted from the subcloned fragment
(âPR4318) and this fusion displayed significantly
decreased lacZ activity in both S. typhimurium hosts (Figure 6). In the Gram negative hosts E. coli, P. putida, P. aeruginosa, A. tumefaciens, and R. meliloti, PR 4318 induced
lacZ expression to levels ranging from 30 â 2000 fold over
the vector control (Figure 7). This result supports the RTPCR findings since STM4318 was found to be detectably
expressed in all hosts tested via this assay. The âPR 4318
construct displayed significant or complete loss of lacZ
activity compared to the PR 4318 constructs in all hosts
tested (Figure 7).
The activity of the PR 4315 lacZ fusion in the WT and â
island 4305 S. typhimurium hosts was also found to be
very high compared to the vector control (Figure 8). However, this construct displayed host specific activity in other
Gram negative hosts that was consistent with the RT-PCR
results (Figure 8). In E. coli and P. aeruginosa, PR4315
induced significant levels of lacZ activity, but in R. meliloti,
the activity of the PR 4315 construct was very similar to
that of the vector control. These findings demonstrate that
the subcloned promoter regions can be used to drive host-

specific gene expression in a manner that is predicted by
the RT-PCR results.
Identification of a conserved DNA site that is associated
with differentially-expressed island 4305 genes
To determine if DNA sequence similarities exist between
any of the island 4305 promoter regions, these DNA
sequences (corresponding to the bracketed regions in Figure 1) were aligned and analyzed for common motifs.
Strikingly, a conserved DNA site was identified and found
to be located upstream of both STM4310 and 4319 (Figure 9A). A divergent version of this site was also found
upstream of STM4315. The STM4310, 4319 and 4315
genes were found to be differentially-expressed. No common DNA site was found to be associated with the genes
expressed in all hosts using the methods here. The DNA
site is 19 bp in length and differs at only two positions
between the STM4310 and 4319 locations. Part of the site
displays a palindromic nature as indicated in Figure 9. It
is noteworthy to mention that each site is located entirely
within the corresponding bracketed regions noted in Figure 1 that contain no open reading frames and are predicted to contain transcriptional signals. A search for this
DNA site in genome databases revealed several matches in
other gamma-proteobacterial species, including Salmonella enterica serovars, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Klebsiella
pneumonia, and Pasteurella multocida (Figure 9B). We note

Discussion
In this report, we present an experimental approach to
study the evolution of species-specific bacterial genomic
islands that extends the current methods of study. The
"clone and transfer" approach presented here involves
cloning the genomic island of interest and transferring it
to a number of other hosts that represent a range of evolutionary distances from the original host. The researcher
can then test island gene expression and function in the
alternative hosts. Of particular interest are genes that are
either: (1) expressed in the original host but not in alternative hosts, or (2) not expressed in the original host but
able to be expressed in alternative hosts. We observed
genes belonging to the former class on island 4305 in this
study (though STM4309 could potentially belong to the
latter class based on its apparent low expression in S. typhimurium and apparent higher expression in other hosts).
This implies that a mechanism that directs transcription of
certain island 4305 genes under the conditions tested here
is absent from the hosts in which we are unable to detect
expression of these genes. Such regulatory mechanisms
are intriguing because their presence or absence in a given
host may determine if a particular horizontally-transferred DNA fragment is able to be expressed and to function in that host. Indeed, such regulatory mechanisms

could be "molecular keys" that are important factors in
shaping bacterial evolution. However, the regulatory
mechanisms that control those genes that are expressed in
all hosts tested may be significant also. These genes could
represent cassettes that are expressed by conserved, highly
active sigma 70 (or equivalent analog) promoters or by
autoregulatory mechanisms that function in all hosts.
These types of mechanisms could yield important information about broad-host-range gene expression systems
that allow particular genes to be propagated in a promiscuous manner. Alternatively, the "non-host-specific"
genes could be controlled by genetically unlinked regulatory mechanisms that are highly conserved across different bacterial genera.
It is possible that the genes found not to be expressed in
certain hosts may be expressed in those hosts under conditions other than those tested here. When testing different growth conditions for use in this study, we found that
growth in LB media (at neutral pH) to late log phase was
the best condition to allow growth of all the host strains
tested so that comparisons across a wide range of bacteria
could be made. If there are conditions that allow expression of genes in those hosts where we did not detect
expression, clearly the mechanism involved in allowing
that expression differs considerably in its regulation and/
or activity as compared to in the other hosts where expression was detected under the conditions used here. In addition, an entirely different mechanism could be

nisms, and in many cases, the identification of these
mechanisms occurred by identifying differentially regulated genomic island genes [21-25]. Second, these mechanisms could be essential when using genomic islands to
engineer alternative bacterial hosts for beneficial medical,
environmental, and/or industrial purposes. For example,
if a particular host of interest does not express key genes
on an island that has been introduced for engineering purposes, then introduction of the necessary regulatory
mechanism into this host would then allow the desired
gene expression.

functioning in those hosts to allow the gene expression
under those conditions. In either case, the results would
indicate bacterial background-specific differences in the
presence or functioning of the regulatory mechanisms
that control the gene(s) being analyzed.
Further studies may allow identification of the factors that
regulate expression of the host-specific and non-host-specific genes using their promoter regions as an important
molecular tool. The identification of such factors could
have very important implications. First, certain regulatory
mechanisms that control genomic island gene expression
are often used by multiple islands (and other non-island
genes) in the same host. Therefore, identification of a regulatory mechanism for the genes of one genomic island
could represent a global mechanism that is used by that
host for multiple different island genes or other genes.
There are multiple examples of such regulatory mecha-

When analyzing island 4305 gene expression in the other
Gram negative hosts, three possible predicted results
could be that tested genes are: (1) expressed in all other
alternative hosts; (2) differentially expressed in other
hosts in a random fashion not dependent on evolutionary
relationship; and (3) differentially expressed in other
hosts in a manner that displays a pattern based on evolutionary relationship. Our results support the last prediction. This pattern is one such that some island 4305 genes
are not expressed in certain hosts, and these hosts belong
to more evolutionarily-distant genera of the alpha-proteobacterial group. S. typhimurium belongs to the enterobacteriacae in the gamma-proteobacterial group which is
characterized by genera that are capable of interacting
with mammalian hosts. By contrast, the hosts that were
unable to detectably express certain island 4305 genes
belong to genera that are characterized by their environmental water and soil habitats and ability to metabolically
utilize a wide range of different compounds found in the
environment. A phylogenetic tree based on the 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the bacterial species used in this
study confirms that the gamma and alpha classification
scheme correlates to basic evolutionary differences in
addition to the previously noted phenotypic differences
(Figure 10). The tree shows that S. typhimurium is indeed
more evolutionary related to the other gamma-protobacteria than to the alpha-proteobacteria, as the two classification groups can be clearly divided in the tree. One
interesting branch to note is that for Rhodobacter sphaeroides; this species has a common ancestor more closely
related to the gamma group than the alpha group (though
it is still on a branch that is separate from the gamma
group). However, this species shows differential expression of island 4305 genes as do other members of the
alpha group. The basic differences between the gamma
and alpha groups could indicate large differences in the
gene regulatory systems that are present in the respective
genomes. The identification of these different gene regulatory systems (in this case, those that appear to be present
in S. typhimurium and absent from N. capsulatum, A. tumefaciens, R. meliloti, and R. sphaeroides) may offer clues to
the basic genetic regulatory mechanisms that can distinguish different genera over the course of evolution.

hosts. Interestingly, STM4315, also known as rtsA, is a
gene that has been shown (upon overexpression from a
plasmid vector) to affect expression of genes that mediate
interactions of S. typhimurium with host cells [20].
STM4319, known as phoN, is a non-specific phosphatase
that is found in other members of the enterobacteriacae
[26,27]. The genes STM4309, 4310 and 4316 all encode
putative, uncharacterized proteins. A conserved 19-bp
DNA site was found to be present in the promoter regions
of STM4310 and 4319, and a related site was found in the
STM4315 promoter region. The site was also found exclusively in the genomes of several other gamma-proteobacterial species. It is not known at this time whether this site
plays a role in the differential expression patterns of these
island 4305 genes, and further research will be necessary
to determine if this DNA sequence plays a role in gene regulation. However, the identification of DNA sites such as
this one may provide clues that aid in the characterization
of genomic island gene regulation.

Another interesting result from our gene expression analysis is that of the five tested genes that were unable to be
detectably expressed in certain hosts, four displayed this
result in multiple hosts (i.e. STM4309, 4310, 4315, and
4319). This contributes to the "boxed" pattern of such
genes in Table 3. The alternative result of a more random
"checkerboard" pattern of such genes in this table was not
observed. In our view, this supports the hypothesis that a
regulatory mechanism that is conserved in more closely-

The promoters identified in a study such as this one have
the potential to be used for experimental applications
where the researcher wants a gene turned off (or expressed
at very low levels) in one host and turned on upon transfer of this gene to another host (or vice-versa) without the
need for the addition of artificial inducers. Such promoters could have significant utility in the study of multi-genera bacterial bio-communities and other broad-hostrange bacterial studies. The approach described here
allows targeted, systematic identification of such promoters that may be contained on genomic islands or any other
region of a bacterial genome.

Conclusion
The evolution of genomic island genes can be studied by
transferring the genomic island to a range of bacterial
hosts of different evolutionary distances from the original
host and systematically analyzing the expression of the
genes compared to proper controls. Using an island
cloned from the S. typhimurium genome, we show that (1)
some island genes are able to be expressed in all hosts
tested while some are unable to be detectably expressed in
certain hosts; and (2) the hosts that are unable to express
island 4305 genes belong to more distantly-related genera
of the alpha-proteobacterial group. This provides an
approach to answer the basic question of whether genes
on the island have evolved to be expressed only in the
host of origin or are able to be expressed in other bacterial
backgrounds. The information gained from such studies
can be used to help facilitate the identification of the
mechanisms responsible for any bacteria-specific expression patterns. These potentially important mechanisms
may be responsible for determining the expression characteristics of horizontally-tranferred DNA and may serve

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.
Bacterial cells were grown in Lennox broth (LB) [28], LB
plus salt [29], YEP [30], YMB [30], M9 minimal media
[31], or Burk's minimal media [30] as indicated. Agar was
added to a final concentration of 1.5% for all solid media.
Antibiotics were used to maintain plasmids in the different host strains as indicated below in the section describing plasmid transfer.

DNA methods
DNA manipulations were performed using standard protocols as described previously [28,31]. All plasmid DNA
was isolated using Qiagen columns as described by the
manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Cloning of S. typhimurium island STM4305
The cloning of the genomic island STM4305 region from
the S. typhimurium Ï3339 genome onto plasmid R995
using the VEX-Capture technique has been described previously [16]. Briefly, loxP sites were inserted on both sides
of the targeted genomic region, and this region was

cific recombination as a non-replicating, circular molecule. An R995 plasmid derivative containing a DNA
fragment homologous to a small portion of the excised
region was used to clone (or "capture") the excised circle
via host homologous recombination mechanisms. The
R995 + island 4305 plasmid was islolated from S. typhimurium via conjugation to a differentially-marked Escherichia
coli recipient (strain TOP10 Rif). The plasmid-containing
E. coli strain served as the donor for all the transfers of
R995 + island 4305 to other hosts. A spectinomycin/streptomycin marker is present on the cloned genomic region
and serves to maintain R995 + island 4305 in the different
hosts. The molecular structure of R995 + island 4305 was
confirmed in the previously described work [16]. Excision
of the targeted chromosomal section created an S. typhimurium strain containing a deletion of the island 4305
region (S. typhimurium â island 4305). This strain was

negative hosts
The donor E. coli strains TOP10 (R995) and TOP10 Rif
(R995 + island 4305) and recipient host strains were
grown overnight in separate broth cultures. The cultures
were washed with fresh media, mixed at a ratio of approximately 1 donor to 2 recipients, spotted on pre-warmed
LB agar plates, and incubated at 30 degrees C for 4 â 16
hours. The mixtures were harvested and transferred to the
indicated agar plates containing the indicated selections.
The media and antibiotic concentrations used to select for
transfer of R995 to each recipient were as follows (concentrations in Âµg/ml): P. putida, M9 kanamycin 50; P. aeruginosa, M9 kanamycin 500; V. vulnificus, LB salt rifampicin
75, kanamycin 50; P. stutzeri, M9 kanamycin 100; S. paucimobilis, Burk's tetracycline 5; N. capsulatum, Burk's tetracycline 5; A. tumefaciens, YEP nalidixic acid 15, kanamycin
50; R. meliloti, YMB nalidixic acid 15, tetracycline 15; R.
sphaeroides, LB nalidixic acid 15, tetracycline 5. The antibiotic concentrations used to select for transfer of R995 +
island 4305 to each recipient were as follows (same media
as above): P. putida, streptomycin 100; P. aeruginosa, streptomycin 100; V. vulnificus, rifampicin 75, spectinomycin
125 (a rifampicin-sensitive donor was used for this mating); P. stutzeri, streptomycin 100; S. paucimobilis, spectinomycin 125; N. capsulatum, spectinomycin 125; A.
tumefaciens, nalidixic acid 15, spectinomycin 125; R.
meliloti, nalidixic acid 15, spectinomycin 125; R. sphaeroides, nalidixic acid 15, spectinomycin 125. Plasmid DNA
was isolated from each recipient and the presence of
island 4305 was confirmed via agarose gel and PCR analysis.
Tissue culture cell adherence and invasion assays
Adherence to and invasion of the human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 and survival in the macrophage-like
cell line J774.1 were assayed as described previously using
1.5 hour time periods for both the pre- and post-gentamycin incubations [32]. To account for differences in chemotaxis and motility between different genera, all bacterial
strains were spun onto the tissue culture cells in a Sorvall
table top centrifuge at 1,000 RPM for 5 minutes. There
was no difference in motility between the S. typhimurium
WT and â island 4305 strains (data not shown). The data
shown are averaged from two to four separate experiments each done in triplicate wells, and the error bars
indicate the standard deviation. The invasion data are
shown as the percentage of adhered cells that survived
gentamycin treatment.

RT-PCR analysis
PCR and RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously [16,33,34]. Each RT-PCR experiment was replicated with RNA harvested from two to five separate
cultures each grown to late log phase in LB medium. These
conditions were found to be best for allowing growth of
all the bacterial hosts used in this study so that comparisons of gene expression across a wide range of genera
could be made. Each RNA preparation was assessed via gel
electrophoresis, and the quality of these preparations was
found to be highly reproducible between batches. Reactions were prepared with equivalent amounts of RNA and
cDNA, and equal amounts of the reactions were loaded in
the depicted agarose gels. RT-PCR DNA bands were quantitated using AlphaEase FC (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro,
CA). The RT-PCR expression ratios were calculated by
dividing the signal for the test gene band by that of the signal for the trfA R995 plasmid vector band for that host.
For Ï3339, this ratio was calculated similarly but the signal for the STM4318 band was used in place of trfA since
the trfA signal is not present in this host and STM4318

gave an expression ratio of 1.0 (compared to trfA) in all
hosts tested. All Gram negative hosts containing plasmid
R995 gave the expected negative results in the RT-PCR
analysis (Figure 4 and data not shown).

(Wilson JW, Nickerson CA: unpublished results). Briefly,
the lacZ vector from this series used here, termed
pQLacZ1, is derived from the IncQ plasmid vector pJAK13
(ATCC #77288), which is a spectinomycin/streptomycin
resistant derivative of pMMB67HE [35]. A BamHI â SalI
fragment from pRS415 containing the promoterless lacZYA operon [36] was inserted between the BamHI and
SalI sites of pJAK13 (such that promoter activity from this
vector did not turn on lacZ expression) to yield pQLacZ1.

STM4315 ORF to the 5 ' end of the STM4318 ORF was
PCR amplified from the S. typhimurium chromosome.
BamHI and KpnI sites were added to the primers at the
STM4315 and STM4318 ends, respectively. This fragment
was cloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR-TOPO4 and
verified by sequencing. The fragment was cloned into the
KpnI and EcoRI sites of pQLacZ1 using the KpnI site of the
PCR product and an EcoRI site in the pCR-TOPO4 vector
such that the STM4318 promoter region (PR 4318) drives
lacZ expression. The âPR 4318 derivative was constructed
using an EcoRV site upstream of PR 4318 and an EcoRI site
in the pCR-TOPO4 vector to insert a truncated PCR fragment without PR 4318 into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of
pQLacZ1. The STM4315 promoter region (PR 4315) was
inserted into the SmaI and BamHI sites of pQLacZ1 using
the BamHI and EcoRV sites of the PCR fragment such that
PR 4315 drives lacZ expression. All pQLacZ1 derivatives
were mobilized to the indicated hosts using the IncP
transfer system of an oriT-deficient derivative of pUZ8,
termed pUZ8002 (Wilson JW, Figurski DH: unpublished
results).
Beta-galactosidase assays
Beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) assays were performed as
described previously using LB as the growth medium for
all strains [37]. The beta-gal expression ratio was calculated by dividing the Miller Unit value for each particular
sample by the average Miller Unit value obtained for the
vector alone in each strain. Thus, this calculation gives the
fold induction of beta-gal expression for each strain. This
value did not differ significantly from 1.0 for all the vector-containing strains. The data presented are the average
from two to four separate experiments each done with
triplicate samples.
Computer analysis methods
To construct the phylogenetic tree, 16S ribosomal RNA
sequences of the indicated bacterial species were aligned
with the AliBee multiple sequence alignment (a part of the
GeneBee internet package), processed with GBLOCKS to
identify more highly conserved regions, and organized
with the FastDNAml progam [38-41]. Identical results
were obtained when the same tree was constructed with
the TreeTop program [38]. For promoter analysis, the
indicated sequences were aligned and analyzed for common motifs using ClustalW and AliBee and searched
against genomic databases using BLAST version 2.2.12
[38,42,43].
