Abstract
Bioinformatics and Genomics are closely related disciplines that hold great promises for the advancement of research
and development in complex biomedical systems, as well as public health, drug design, comparative genomics,
personalized medicine and so on. Research and development in these two important areas are impacting the science and
technology.
High throughput sequencing and molecular imaging technologies marked the beginning of a new era for modern
translational medicine and personalized healthcare. The impact of having the human sequence and personalized digital
images in hand has also created tremendous demands of developing powerful supercomputing, statistical learning and
artificial intelligence approaches to handle the massive bioinformatics and personalized healthcare data, which will
obviously have a profound effect on how biomedical research will be conducted toward the improvement of human
health and prolonging of human life in the future. The International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (http://
www.isibm.org) and its official journals, the International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine
(http://www.inderscience.com/ijfipm) and the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design (http://
www.inderscience.com/ijcbdd) in collaboration with International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational
Biology (Biocomp), touch tomorrow's bioinformatics and personalized medicine throughout today's efforts in promoting
the research, education and awareness of the upcoming integrated inter/multidisciplinary field. The 2007 international
conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BIOCOMP07) was held in Las Vegas, the United States of
American on June 25-28, 2007. The conference attracted over 400 papers, covering broad research areas in the
genomics, biomedicine and bioinformatics. The Biocomp 2007 provides a common platform for the cross fertilization of
ideas, and to help shape knowledge and scientific achievements by bridging these two very important disciplines into an
interactive and attractive forum. Keeping this objective in mind, Biocomp 2007 aims to promote interdisciplinary and
multidisciplinary education and research. 25 high quality peer-reviewed papers were selected from 400+ submissions for
this supplementary issue of BMC Genomics. Those papers contributed to a wide-range of important research fields

including gene expression data analysis and applications, high-throughput genome mapping, sequence analysis, gene
regulation, protein structure prediction, disease prediction by machine learning techniques, systems biology, database
and biological software development. We always encourage participants submitting proposals for genomics sessions,
special interest research sessions, workshops and tutorials to Professor Hamid R. Arabnia (hra@cs.uga.edu) in order to
ensure that Biocomp continuously plays the leadership role in promoting inter/multidisciplinary research and education
in the fields. Biocomp received top conference ranking with a high score of 0.95/1.00. Biocomp is academically cosponsored by the International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine and the Research Laboratories and Centers of
Harvard University – Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Indiana University - Purdue University, Georgia Tech –
Emory University, UIUC, UCLA, Columbia University, University of Texas at Austin and University of Iowa etc. Biocomp
- Worldcomp brings leading scientists together across the nation and all over the world and aims to promote synergistic
components such as keynote lectures, special interest sessions, workshops and tutorials in response to the advances of
cutting-edge research.

Introduction
Establishing and maintaining productive collaboration
between bioinformatics and genomics domains are critical for the shoulder-to-shoulder advancement of science
and technology. The synergy of bioinformatics and
genomics proved effective and powerful in promoting science, technology, medicine and the interdisciplinary
research and education. Biocomp and the International
Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (ISIBM) aim to
promote the synergistic genomics and bioinformatics
research, therefore Biocomp 2007 received more than 400
high quality papers. Each paper was reviewed and ranked
by at least 3 experts in the field. After a rigorous and unbiased review process, 27% of the papers were selected as
regular research papers and 22% second-tire papers were
accepted as “short” research papers that require/recommend authors to reduce their page-length to five pages. In
addition, there are several invited keynote and tutorial lecture papers/abstracts from world top scientists in the
fields. Program, Advisory and Steering Committee Chairs
and Conference Co-Chairs have spent tremendous
amount of time and efforts out of their tight schedule to
this great academic event in evaluating 400+ papers and
keeping the scientific standard high.
Worldcomp committees elected distinguished plenary
keynote and tutorial lectures, given by world top scientists
such as Dr. A. Keith Dunker of Indiana University - Purdue
University, Dr. Jun S. Liu of Harvard University – Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy of
University of California at Berkeley and Member of the
National Academy of Engineering and Member of the
Institute of Medicine of National Academy of Sciences,
Dr. John Holland of University of Michigan, Dr. Mary Qu
Yang of National Human Genome Research Institute –
National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jack Y. Yang of Harvard
University, Dr. Joydeep Ghosh of University of Texas at
Austin, Dr. Howard J. Siegel of Colorado State University,
Dr Patrick S Wang of Northeastern University and supported their cutting-edge research lectures to imbue all the

1,850 conference participants with new ideas. In addition,
Biocomp 2007 hosted special genomics sessions focusing
on specific genomics topics to promote the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research and
fostered collaboration between the genomics and bioinformatics domains. Biocomp 2007 was evidently a large
flagship international conference in the fields and
received top ranking.
This BMC Genomics supplement consists of 25 peerreviewed papers selected from the 2007 international conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
(BIOCOMP07), which is an international conference held
simultaneously with a number of other joint conferences
as part of the World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (WORLDCOMP, http://www.worldacademyofscience.org) in Las
Vegas, U.S.A on June 25-28, 2007. WORLDCOMP is the
largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied computing. It
attracted over 1,850 computer science and engineering
researchers as well as computational biologists from 82
countries. The goal of the conference is to provide a forum
in which researchers can present their research projects,
exchange ideas in the research areas that interact and initiate the collaboration in their future research.

Scientific themes, process of submissions and
reviews
Bioinformatics and genomics play fundamental roles in
our understanding and designs of biological systems and
therapic medicine at all levels of organization, from
molecular biology, life sciences to engineering and computer sciences. Bioinformatics and genomics are “bourgeoning out” fields that study the sequence with the
development of algorithms, computational and statistical
techniques, and theories to solve formal and practical biomedical problems.

Obviously, the Biocomp 2007 would not have achieved
such a success without the hard work by contributors and
organizers. Organizing such a major academic event in
the fields is not possible without contributions from
members of program, scientific review, advisory and steering committee. Thanks must be given to them for their
professionalisms. We must express our sincere gratitude
program and scientific review committee members for
their high-quality timely evaluation of more than 400
full-length regular research papers. We must express our
sincere gratitude to the program and scientific review
committee members for their high-quality timely evaluation of more than 400 full-length regular research papers.
We must extend our sincere thanks to all to the conference
co-chairs, vice-chairs, session chairs, organizers and committee members for their dedication and professional
services. In particular, Michelle M. Zhu, Youping Deng,
Hamid R. Arabnia, Jack Y. Yang, Mary Qu Yang, Rattikorn
Hewett, Yunlong Liu, Jianlin Cheng, Vladimir N Uversky,
My Tra Thai, Yufang Jin and the scientific review committee members dedicated themselves for the scientific
reviews.. Hamid R. Arabnia managed the paper submission system and handled various important organizing
and academic affairs; Jack Y. Yang and Mary Qu Yang initiated the special genomics sessions with new components that are defined dynamically in response to specific
needs of inter/multidisciplinary cutting-edge research and
education, therefore, Mary Qu Yang, Jack Y. Yang and
Hamid R. Arabnia initiated and arranged the organization
of cutting-edge research workshops, keynote lectures, special sessions and poster presentations in addition to the
traditional tutorial lectures. The Biocomp committee
would like to acknowledge our appreciation of International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (ISIBM)
for their academic support and co-sponsorship; we must
express our sincere appreciation to the excellent professional services provided to the Biocomp by Isobel Peters
at BioMed Central Ltd for the BMC Genomics supplementary issue.
Biocomp received submissions both from the presenters
at the conference and from non-presenters. Submitted
manuscripts were reviewed by at least three referees. The
quality of each paper was evaluated based on the contribution to genomics and bioinformatics. The accepted
papers in the specific issue covered a broad range of subject areas and can be mainly divided into the following
categories:
Microarray data analysis
Eight papers discuss novel mathematical or statistical
approaches to analyze microarray datasets. Gu and Liu [1]
proposed a Bayesian biclustering model, and implemented a Gibbs sampling procedure and illustrated that
such Bayesian biclustering approach can effectively iden-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/S1/I1

tify multiple clusters from gene expression data. Zhu and
Wu [2] proposed a parallel computation-based random
matrix theory approach to analyze the cross correlations
of gene expression data in an entirely automatic and
objective manner to eliminate the ambiguities and subjectivity inherent to human decisions. Yang et al.[3] conducted extensive physiological and transcriptomic studies
to characterize Fur in Shewanella oneidensis, with regard
to iron and acid tolerance response with their own microarray expression datasets. Xu et al. [4] developed novel
graph-based methods to combine multiple microarray
datasets to discover co-expression network modules
related to cancer disease. Pirooznia et al. [5] compared
various microarray classification methods including;
SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods. Mao et al.[6]
investigated the transcriptomic profiling of three yeast
mutants lacking C2H2 zinc finger prote and found out
that the gene expression patterns were dramatically different between wild type and the mutants. Gong et al. [7]
studied the effect of explosive compounds such as TNT
and RDX on the transcriptomic pattern of earthworms.
Deng et al.[8] proposed an algorithms based on Integer
Linear Programming to select a minimum number of
non-unique probes for microarray experiment using ddisjunct matrices.
Genome and sequence analysis
Li et al. [9] proposed an effective algorithm to enable
rapid mapping of millions of oligonucleotide fragments
to a genome of any length. They were able to achieve at
least one order of magnitude speed increase over existing
tools by using bit shifting operation.

Liu et al.[10] quantified the effects of recombination on
populations by estimating the minimum number of
recombination events in the history of a DNA sample.
Two new algorithms were proposed for estimating the
lower bound under the infinite site model. The new lower
bounds can also be extended to allow for recurrent mutations. Yue et al. [11] extended current method GRAPPA for
reconstructing phylogeny from genome rearrangements
and develop a new method GRAPPA-IR to analyze gene
rearrangement from chloroplast genomes with inverted
repeat.
Protein structure prediction and classification
Yang et al. [12] exploited machine learning techniques
including variants of Self-Organizing Global Ranking, a
decision tree, and a support vector machine algorithms to
predict the tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins.
Hecker et al. [13] developed a state of the art protein disorder predictor and tested it on a large protein disorder
dataset created from Protein Data Bank. The relationship
of sensitivity and specificity is also evaluated. Habib et al.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9(Suppl 1):I1

[14] presented a new SVM based approach to predict the
subcellular locations based on amino acid and amino acid
pair composition. More protein features can be taken into
consideration and consequently improves the accuracy
significantly. Wang et al.[15] discussed an empirical
approach to specify the localization of protein binding
regions utilizing information including the distribution
pattern of the detected RNA fragments and the sequence
specificity of RNase digestion.
Gene regulation elements analysis
Yang et al.[16] extended their previous work, which identified candidate bidirectional promoters in the human
genome, to map the orthologous promoter regions in the
mouse genome. It was shown that bidirectional promoters can be classified apart from other genomic features
including non-bidirectional promoters. Chen et al.[17]
developed an analytical method to identify a thermodynamic model that best describes the mode of transcription
factor (TF)-TF interaction among a set of TFs for target
genes. Wang et al.[18] conducted research to simultaneously identify transcription factor and microRNA
(miRNA) binding sites from gene expression microarray
database. Two models for predicting the most influential
cis-acting elements under a given biological condition,
and estimating the effects of those elements on gene
expression levels are proposed.
Disease classification using machine learning techniques
Yang et al. [19] developed a multi-task learning technique
based on genetic algorithm to improve prediction accuracy of tumor classification by using information contained in such discarded redundant features.
Experimental results demonstrated that this approach is
effective and perform better than other heuristic methods.
Liu et al. [20] developed a feature selection method to
combines supervised learning and statistical measures for
the chosen candidate features/SNPs to reconcile the
redundancy information and, in doing so, improve the
classification performance in association studies. A Support Vector based Recursive Feature Addition (SVRFA)
scheme is also proposed to aid SNP-disease association
analysis. Yang et al.[21] developed an intelligent decision
system using machine learning techniques and markers to
characterize tissue as cancerous, non-cancerous or borderline. These algorithms can detect microscopic pathological changes based on features derived from gene
expression levels and metabolic profiles.
Biological network construction
Hub proteins in a protein network can bind to many different protein partners to regulate and control a wide variety of physiological processes. Oldfield et al. [22] studied
protein intrinsic disorder arising from structural plasticity
or flexibility and illustrated how such intrinsic disorder

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/S1/I1

can provide a means for hubs to associate with many partners. Jin et al. [23] presented their work on a nonlinear
control and stability analysis of genetic regulatory networks. Such control scheme can make the genetic regulatory network to get to desired levels by adjusting
transcriptional rates. This research the can also be used to
design model-based experiments for gene expression profiles regulation.
Genome and database search tools
Dai et al.[24] developed a visual editor for profile Hidden
Markov Models (HMMEditor), which can visualize the
profile HMM architecture, transition probabilities, and
emission probabilities. As open-source software, it serves
as a useful tool for biological sequence analysis and modeling. Vanteru et al. [25] introduced semantics enabled
technique to link the PubMed to the Gene Ontology for
ontology-based browsing. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
framework is used to semantically interface PubMed
abstracts to the Gene Ontology for better search performance since semantics is introduced.

Conclusion
As upcoming emerging fields, Bioinformatics and
Genomics integrate science and engineering knowledge
with modern state-of-art computing technology, which
has so far slightly influenced the academic community
and public consciousness. Bit new concepts and technologies are emerging at an incredibly pace and the synergy
of Bioinformatics and Genomics proved powerful in the
continuously evolving and emerging fields because the
development of engineering and computer science
approaches can be applied to both bioinformatics and
genomics fields, the resonance and synergy of these two
fields are enormous and will have significant impact on
the advances of science and medicine. It is important to
train the next generation of Bioinformatics and Genomics
experts with up-to-date technologies and knowledge of
advancement and development of these two emerging
field. To these ends, Biocomp07 strives to create opportunities to promote science, technology and education for
students, faculty, scientists and engineers in these new
emerging fields and helps them better prepared for new
initiatives and cutting-edge researches. Therefore,
Biocomp07 offers a number of keynotes and tutorial lectures and Biocomp07 committee appreciates organizers
performing their tasks in selecting best suitable papers in
this BMC Genomics supplementary issue. Biocomp has
attracted a wide scope of interests that significantly promote the science and technology with most updated cutting-edge technologies and breakthrough ideas win the
open discussions, keynote and scientific exchanges
among attendees to inspire innovations, novel ideas and
scientific discoveries. Biocomp provided such unique
platform and infrastructure to promote interdisciplinary
