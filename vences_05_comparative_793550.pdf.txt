Abstract
Background: Identifying species of organisms by short sequences of DNA has been in the center
of ongoing discussions under the terms DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy. A C-terminal fragment
of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as universal
marker for this purpose among animals.
Results: Herein we present experimental evidence that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fulfills
the requirements for a universal DNA barcoding marker in amphibians. In terms of universality of
priming sites and identification of major vertebrate clades the studied 16S fragment is superior to
COI. Amplification success was 100% for 16S in a subset of fresh and well-preserved samples of
Madagascan frogs, while various combination of COI primers had lower success rates.COI priming
sites showed high variability among amphibians both at the level of groups and closely related
species, whereas 16S priming sites were highly conserved among vertebrates. Interspecific pairwise
16S divergences in a test group of Madagascan frogs were at a level suitable for assignment of larval
stages to species (1–17%), with low degrees of pairwise haplotype divergence within populations
(0–1%).
Conclusion: We strongly advocate the use of 16S rRNA as standard DNA barcoding marker for
vertebrates to complement COI, especially if samples a priori could belong to various
phylogenetically distant taxa and false negatives would constitute a major problem.

Background
The use of short DNA sequences for the standardized
identification of organisms has recently gained attention
under the terms DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy [1-3].
Among the promising applications of this method are the
assignments of unknown life-history stages to adult

organisms [4,5], the large-scale identification of organisms in ecological or genomic studies [1,6] and, most controversially, explorative studies to discover potentially
undescribed "candidate" species [4,7,8]. Although it is not
a fundamentally new technique [9], DNA barcoding is
promising because technical progress has made its largePage 1 of 12

scale, automated application feasible [3,6] which may
accelerate taxonomic progress [10].
Although not necessarily under the specific concepts of
DNA barcoding and DNA taxonomy, the diagnosis and
even definition of taxa by their DNA sequences are realities in many fields and organism groups, such as prokaryotes, fungi, and soil invertebrates [1,6]. To use this
approach on a large and formalized scale, consensus of
the scientific community is essential with respect to the
most suitable genes that allow robust and repeatable
amplification and sequencing, and that provide unequivocal resolution to identify a broad spectrum of organisms.
While D. Tautz and co-workers [3] proposed the nuclear
ribosomal RNA genes for this purpose, P. D. N. Hebert
and colleagues have strongly argued in favor of a 5' fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase,
subunit I (COI or COXI) [2,11]. This gene fragment has
been shown to provide a sufficient resolution and robustness in some groups of organisms, such as arthropods
and, more recently, birds [2,4,7,11].
A genetic marker suitable for DNA barcoding needs to
meet a number of criteria [2]. First, in the study group, it
needs to be sufficiently variable to discriminate among
most species, but sufficiently conserved to be less variable
within than between species. Second, priming sites need
to be sufficiently conserved to permit a reliable amplification without the risk of false negatives when the goal is the
analysis of pooled samples, e.g. when the total of invertebrates from a soil sample is to be studied without separating individuals, or of environmental DNA such as
subfossil DNA remains from the soil [12,13]. Third, the
gene should convey sufficient phylogenetic information
to assign species to major taxa using simple phenetic
approaches. Fourth, its amplification and sequencing
should be as robust as possible, also under variable lab
conditions and protocols. Fifth, sequence alignment
should be possible also among distantly related taxa.
Here we explore the performance of a fragment of the 16S
ribosomal RNA gene (16S) in DNA barcoding of amphibians. As a contribution to the discussion about suitable
standard markers we provide experimental data on comparative amplification success of 16S and COI in amphibians, empirical data on conservedness of priming sites,
and an example from the 16S-based identification of
amphibian larval stages.

were concordant in yielding more reliable and universal
amplifications for 16S than COI. In a set of fresh and wellpreserved samples from relatively closely related mantellid frogs from Madagascar (Table 1, Additional file 1), the
16S amplification success was complete, whereas the
three sets of COI primers yielded success rates of only 50–
70%. Considering all three primer combinations, there
were two species of frogs (10%) that did not amplify for
COI at all (Boophis septentrionalis and B. tephraeomystax).
Priming sites
The variability of priming sites was surveyed using nine
complete amphibian mitochondrial sequences from Genbank (Fig. 1), and 59 mt genomes of fishes, reptiles, birds
and mammals (Fig. 2). A high variability was encountered
for COI. The sequences of some species were largely consistent with the primers: Xenopus had two mutations only
at each of the priming regions. However, other sequences
were strongly different, with up to seven mutations, all at
third codon positions. No particular pattern was recognizable for any major group that would facilitate designing
COI primers specific for frogs, salamanders or caecilians.
Interestingly the variability among the amphibian
sequences available was as large as or larger than among
the complete set of vertebrates at many nucleotide positions of COI priming sites (Fig. 2), indicating a possible
higher than average variability of this gene in amphibians.

In contrast, the 16S priming sites were remarkably constant both among amphibians and among other vertebrates (Fig. 1, 2). A wider survey of priming sites, i.e., the
alternative reverse priming sites used in arthropod and
bird studies [2,7], confirmed the high variability of COI in
amphibians, and in vertebrates in general (Fig. 2). A
screening of the first 800 bp of the C-terminal part of the
gene in nine amphibians of which complete mitochondrial genes were available did not reveal a single fragment
of 20 bp where all nine species would agree in 80% or
more of their nucleotides.

Results

Recovery of major groups
The phenetic neighbor-joining analysis using the 16S fragment produced a tree that contained eight major groupings that conform to or are congruent with the current
classification and phylogeny (Fig. 3): cartilaginous fishes,
salamanders, frogs, turtles, eutherian mammals, mammals, squamates, birds. Of these, the COI tree (Fig. 4)
recovered only the lineages of cartilaginuous fishes and
birds. The COI analysis did not recover any additional
major lineage.

Amplification experiments
We performed independent amplification experiments
with one set of 16S primers and three published sets of
COI primers [2,7] focusing on representatives of different
frog, salamander and caecilian genera. The experiments

of high anuran diversity in eastern Madagascar, Andasibe
and Ranomafana. These two localities are separated by a
geographical distance of ca. 250 km. The results will be
presented in more detail elsewhere.
We selected target species for which morphological and
bioacoustic uniformity suggests that populations from
Ranomafana and Andasibe are conspecific. All these species belong to the family Mantellidae. We then analysed
haplotypes within and between these populations. In
addition we assessed divergences among sibling species of
mantellid frogs (Tables 2-4, Additional file 1). These were
defined as morphologically similar species that are phylogenetically sister to each other, or are in well-defined but
phylogenetically poorly resolved clades of 3–5 species.
Results revealed a low intrapopulational variation of 0–
3% uncorrected pairwise distances in the 16S gene, a surprisingly large differentiation among conspecific populations of 0–5.1%, and a wide range of differentiation
among species, ranging from 1–16.5% with a mode at 7–
9% (Fig. 5). The few species separated by low genetic distances were allopatrically distributed. The interspecific
divergence was higher in those species pairs in which syntopic occurrence has been recorded or is likely (2.7–
16.5% divergence, mean 8.5%) as compared to those that
so far only have been found in allopatry (1.0–12.9%,
mean 6.9%).
Phylogenetic and phenetic analyses (Bayesian and Neighbor-joining) of these and many additional sequences (to
be published elsewhere) mostly grouped sequences of
those specimens from Ranomafana and Andasibe that a
priori had been considered to be conspecific (exceptions
were Mantidactylus boulengeri, not considered in the
intraspecific comparisons here, and M. blommersae). This
indicates that cases in which haplotypes of a species are
more similar to those of another species than to those of
other conspecific individuals or populations, are rare in
these frogs. Sharing of identical haplotypes among individuals belonging to different species, in our dataset, was
limited to three closely related species pairs of low genetic
divergences: Boophis doulioti and B. tephraeomystax, B. goudoti and B. cf.periegetes, Mantella aurantiaca and M. crocea.
Depending on the taxonomic scheme employed, our
complete data set contains 200–300 species of Madagascan frogs. Hence, haplotype sharing was demonstrated in
2–3% of the total number of species only.
To explore the reliability of tadpole identification using
the 16S gene we used local BLAST searches against a database containing about 1000 sequences of adult frogs from
a wide sampling all over Madagascar. 138 tadpoles from
the Andasibe region and 84 tadpoles from the
Ranomafana region were compared with adult sequences
in the database. In 77% of the cases the highest scores

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/5

were those from comparisons to adults from the same site
as the tadpoles. In most of the unsuccessful comparisons,
adult sequences of the corresponding species were not
available from the tadpole site (21%). In only 5 cases
(2%) conspecific adults collected from a different site
than the tadpoles yielded higher BLAST scores although
adult sequences from the same site were in the database.

Conclusion
DNA barcoding in amphibians
DNA barcoding has great appeal as a universally applicable tool for identification of species and variants of organisms, possibly even in automated handheld devices [14].
However, doubtless severe restrictions exist to its universal
applicability [9]. Some taxa, e.g. cichlid fishes of Lake Victoria, have radiated so rapidly that the speciation events
have not left any traces in their mitochondrial genomes
[15]; identifying these species genetically will only be possible through the examination of multiple nuclear markers, as it has been done to assess their phylogeny [16].
Some snails are characterized by a high intraspecific haplotype diversity, which could disable attempts to identify
and distinguish among species using such markers [17].

Haplotype sharing due to incomplete lineage sorting or
introgression is also known in amphibians [18] although
it was not common in mantellid frogs in our data set.
However, a number of species showed haplotype sharing
with other species, or non-monophyletic haplotypes, warranting a more extensive discussion. In Mantidactylus boulengeri, specimens from Andasibe and Ranomafana have
similar advertisement calls and (at least superficially) similar morphologies, but their 16S haplotypes were not a
monophyletic group (unpublished data). This species
belongs to a group of direct-developing frogs that, like the
Neotropical Eleutherodactylus [19] may be characterized by
a high rate of cryptic speciation. Further data are necessary
to decide whether the populations from Ranomafana and
Andasibe are indeed conspecific. In contrast, there is little
doubt that the populations of Mantidactylus blommersae
from these two sites are conspecific, yet the Ranomafana
haplotypes are closer to those of the clearly distinct
species M. domerguei. The species pairs where haplotype
sharing has been observed (see Results) all appear to be
allopatrically to parapatrically distributed and show no or
only low differences in advertisement calls, indicating that
occasional hybridization along contact zones may be possible [e.g., [20]]. Haplotypes of each of these species pairs
always formed highly supported clusters or clades, and
had divergences below 3%, indicating that haplotype
sharing in mantellids may only constitute a problem
when individuals are to be assigned to such closely related
sister species.

Although our data show that DNA barcoding in mantellids is a largely valid approach when both reference and
test sequences come from the same site, the occurrence of
non-monophyletic and highly divergent haplotypes
within species characterizes these and other amphibians
as a challenging group for this technique. Certainly, DNA
barcoding is unable to provide a fully reliable species
identification in amphibians, especially if reference
sequences do not cover the entire genetic variability and
geographic distribution of a species. However, the same is
true for any other morphological or bioacoustic identification method. Case studies are needed to estimate more
precisely the margin of error of molecular identification of
amphibian species. For many approaches, such as the
molecular survey of the trade in frog legs for human consumption [21], the error margins might be acceptable. In
contrast, the broad overlap of intraspecific and interspecific divergences (Fig. 5) cautions against simplistic diagnoses of presumably new amphibian species by DNA
divergences alone. A large proportion of biological and
evolutionary species will be missed by inventories that
characterize candidate species by DNA divergences above
a previously defined threshold.
Comparative performance of DNA barcoding markers in
amphibians
Phenomena of haplotype sharing or non-monophyletic
conspecific haplotypes will affect any DNA barcoding
approach that uses mitochondrial genes, and are also to
be expected with nuclear genes [e.g., [22]]. Nevertheless,
some genes certainly outperform others in terms of discriminatory power and universal applicability, and these
characteristics may also vary among organism groups. The
mitochondria of plants are characterized by very different
evolutionary patterns than those of animals, including
frequent translocation of genetic material into and from
the nucleus [23], which limits their use for DNA barcoding purposes. Nuclear ribosomal DNA (18S and 28S),
proposed as standard marker [3], has a high potential in
invertebrate DNA barcoding but its high-throughput
amplification encounters difficulties in vertebrates.

As a consequence, despite the need of consensus on markers for universal applicability of DNA barcoding, the use
of different genes in different groups of organisms seems
reasonable. It has been hypothesized that universal COI
primers may enable amplification of a 5' terminal fragment from representatives of most animal phyla due to
their robustness [2]. The success in DNA barcoding of lepidopterans and birds suggests that this gene fragment can
indeed be used as a standard for many higher animal taxa
[2,4,7].
In our experiments we compared 16S primers commonly
used in amphibians to COI primers that had been devel-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/5

oped for other vertebrates [7] or invertebrates [2]. It may
well be possible, with some effort, to design primers that
are more successful and consistent in amplifying COI
from amphibians. However, our results from mantellid
frogs (Table 1, Additonal file 1) indicate a very good
amplification success of the primers for some species, but
failure for other, related species. This and our results on
variability of priming sites predict enormous difficulties
in designing one pair of primers that will reliably amplify
this gene fragment in all vertebrates, all amphibians, or
even all representatives of any amphibian order. A set of
one forward and three reverse COI primers have been successfully used to amplify and sequence a large number of
bird species [7], but birds are a much younger clade than
amphibians with a probably lower mitochondrial
variability.
A further optimization of COI amplification may also be
achieved regarding the PCR protocol. Herein we used
standard protocols that optimized annealing temperature
only, whereas more complex touchdown protocols have
been used for birds and butterflies [4,7]. However, one
major requirement for a DNA barcoding marker is its
robustness to variable lab conditions. If DNA barcoding is
to be applied as a standard in many different labs, primers
and genes need to be chosen that amplify reliably under
very different conditions and under standard protocols.
This clearly applies to 16S, which we have amplified with
very different annealing temperatures and PCR conditions
in previous exploratory studies (results not shown).
Alignment of 16S sequences is complicated by the prevalence of insertions and deletions, and this gene is less
variable than COI [2]. Nevertheless, our results indicate
that even using an uncritical automated alignment this
gene has a higher potential than COI to assign vertebrate
sequences to the level of classes and orders.
The 16S gene is a highly conserved mitochondrial marker
but mutations are common in some variable regions, corresponding to loops in the ribosomal RNA structure. In
amphibians, where many species are relatively old entities
[24], this ensures a sufficient amount of mutations among
species. Our results for amphibians, and previous experience with fishes, reptiles and mammals, indicates that 16S
is sufficiently variable to unambiguously identify most
species.
A further mitochondrial gene that has been widely used in
amphibian phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies is
cytochrome b. This gene can easily be amplified in salamanders and archaeobatrachian frogs using primers that
anneal with adjacent tRNA genes. However, neobatrachian frogs (the wide majority of amphibian species) are
characterized by rearrangements of the mitochondrial

Page 9 of 12

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:5

genome [25,26], and cytochrome b in these species borders
directly to the control region. Although cytochrome b primers are available that work in many neobatrachians
[27,28], they are not fully reliable. According to our own
observations in mantellid frogs, these primers may
amplify this gene in one species but fail in other closely
related species, presumably because of mutations at the
priming sites and similar to the COI primers tested here.
In contrast, the 16S primer pair used here can be considered as truly universal not only for amphibians but even
for vertebrates. This is also reflected by the high number
of amphibian 16S sequences in Genbank (2620 hits for
16S vs. 483 hits for COI, as of September 2004). Moreover, the 16S and 12S rRNA genes have been selected as
standard markers for phylogeny reconstruction in
amphibians [29], which will lead to a near-complete global dataset of amphibian 16S sequences in the near future.
If the development of handheld devices [14] is envisaged
as a realistic goal, then the universality and robustness of
primers should be among the most relevant characteristics
of a gene for DNA barcoding. When pooled samples containing representatives of various higher vertebrate taxa
are to be analysed, the risk of false negatives strongly
increases with decreasing universality of primers. As a
consequence we recommend the use of 16S as additional
standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates, especially for but not limited to applications that involve
pooled samples.

Methods
To test for universality of primers and cycling conditions,
we performed parallel experiments in three different laboratories (Berkeley, Cologne, Konstanz) using the same
primers but different biochemical products and thermocyclers, and slightly different protocols.
The selected primers for 16S [30] amplify a fragment of ca.
550 bp (in amphibians) that has been used in many phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in this and other
vertebrate classes: 16SA-L, 5' - CGC CTG TTT ATC AAA
AAC AT - 3'; 16SB-H, 5' - CCG GTC TGA ACT CAG ATC
ACG T - 3'.
For COI we tested (1) three primers designed for birds [7]
that amplify a 749 bp region near the 5'-terminus of this
gene: BirdF1, 5' - TTC TCC AAC CAC AAA GAC ATT GGC
AC - 3', BirdR1, 5' - ACG TGG GAG ATA ATT CCA AAT
CCT G - 3', and BirdR2, 5' - ACT ACA TGT GAG ATG ATT
CCG AAT CCA G - 3'; and (2) one pair of primers designed
for arthropods [2] that amplify a 658 bp fragment in the
same region: LCO1490, 5' - GGT CAA CAA ATC ATA AAG
ATA TTG G - 3', and HCO2198, 5'-TAA ACT TCA GGG
TGA CCA AAA AAT CA-3'. Sequences of additional primers for COI that had performed well in mammals and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/5

fishes were kindly made available by P. D. N. Hebert (personal communication in 2004) and these primers yielded
similar results (not shown).
The optimal annealing temperatures for the COI primers
were determined using a gradient thermocycler and were
found to be 49–50°C; the 16S annealing temperature was
55°C. Successfully amplified fragments were sequenced
using various automated sequencers and deposited in
Genbank. Accession numbers for the complete data set of
adult mantellid sequences used for the assessment of
intra- and interspecific divergences (e.g. in Fig. 5) are

The performance of COI and 16S in assigning taxa to
inclusive major clades was tested based on gene fragments
homologous to those amplified by the primers used
herein (see above), extracted from the complete mitochondrial sequences of 68 vertebrate taxa. Sequences were
aligned in Sequence Navigator (Applied Biosystems) by a
Clustal algorithm with a gap penalty of 50, a gap extend
penalty of 10 and a setting of the ktup parameter at 2.
PAUP* [34] was used with the neighbor-joining algorithm and LogDet distances and excluding pairwise comparisons for gapped sites. We chose these simple phenetic
methods instead of maximum likelihood or maximum
parsimony approaches because they are computationally
more demanding and because the aim of DNA barcoding
is a robust and fast identification of taxa rather than an
accurate
determination
of
their
phylogenetic
relationships.
