Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) is one of the four subunits composing
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1. It catalyzes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the
ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner during protein synthesis, although it also seems to play a role in
other non-translational processes. Currently, little information is still available about its expression profile
and regulation during flatfish metamorphosis. With regard to this, Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is a
commercially important flatfish in which eEF1A gene remains to be characterized.
Results: The development of large-scale genomics of Senegalese sole has facilitated the identification of
five different eEF1A genes, referred to as SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4, and Sse42Sp50. Main
characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and mammalian eEF1As are described. Phylogenetic
and tissue expression analyses allowed for the identification of SseEF1A1 and SseEF1A2 as the Senegalese
sole counterparts of mammalian eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, respectively, and of Sse42Sp50 as the ortholog of
Xenopus laevis and teleost 42Sp50 gene. The other two elongation factors, SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A4,
represent novel genes that are mainly expressed in gills and skin. The expression profile of the five genes
was also studied during larval development, revealing different behaviours. To study the possible regulation
of SseEF1A gene expressions by thyroid hormones (THs), larvae were exposed to the goitrogen thiourea
(TU). TU-treated larvae exhibited lower SseEF1A4 mRNA levels than untreated controls at both 11 and
15 days after treatment, whereas transcripts of the other four genes remained relatively unchanged.
Moreover, addition of exogenous T4 hormone to TU-treated larvae increased significantly the steadystate levels of SseEF1A4 with respect to untreated controls, demonstrating that its expression is upregulated by THs.
Conclusion: We have identified five different eEF1A genes in the Senegalese sole, referred to as SseEF1A1,
SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4, and Sse42Sp50. The five genes exhibit different expression patterns in
tissues and during larval development. TU and T4 treatments demonstrate that SseEF1A4 is up-regulated
by THs, suggesting a role in the translational regulation of the factors involved in the dramatic changes that
occurs during Senegalese sole metamorphosis.

Background
G proteins constitute a large superfamily of regulatory
proteins that show a high similarity in primary structure
and organization of the functional center [1-3]. They all
share a common GTPase cycle, being turned on by binding GTP and off by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. Additional
regulatory proteins are often required to induce the conformational changes that occur during this cycle: guanine
nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze release of
bound GDP and promote its replacement by GTP, and
GTPase-activating proteins, which accelerate GTP hydrolysis. Such transition between active and inactive forms
allows for them to serve as molecular switches and to
make G proteins suitable for the regulation of a wide
range of cellular processes such as signal transduction,
cytoskeletal reorganizations, vesicular transport and protein synthesis [4]. The superfamily of G proteins includes
three main classes: Ras-like GTPases, Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, and the translation elongation factors.
The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha, currently termed eEF1A, is a member of the G protein family,
and one of the four subunits that compose the eukaryotic
elongation factor 1 [5,6]. It is the second-most abundant
protein after actin, comprising 1–3% of the total protein
content in normal growing cells [7,8]. In its GTP-liganded
form, eEF1A catalyzes the first step of the elongation cycle
during peptide synthesis, interacting with aminoacyltRNA to bring it to the acceptor site of the ribosome [6,9].
Following hydrolysis of the GTP, the complex
eEF1A·GDP is released from the ribosome and further
converted to the active GTP-bound form by elongation
factor 1 beta, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange
factor for eEF1A. Apart from its key role in protein translation, other functions have been reported as well. eEF1A
has been characterized as an actin binding protein with
the ability to bundle F actin [10,11] displaying microtubule severing [12] and stabilizing [13] activities, although
the biological significance of these interactions is still
unclear. In addition, eEF1A is thought to play a role in
mediating signal transduction, as it has been shown to
interact with PLCγ [14], and to be an activator of phosphoinositol 4-kinase [11,15], an enzyme belonging to the
signal transduction cascade activated by growth factors.
Furthermore, an altered expression of eEF1A has been
found in several kinds of tumors [16-20]. It has been also
demonstrated that eEF1A is required for the degradation
of Nα-acetylated proteins probably acting as a ubiquitin
C-terminal hydrolase, thus rendering the substrate more
easily degraded by the proteasome or by reducing the correct folding of the protein/ubiquitins complex for the subsequent proteolytic degradation [21,22]. Finally,
upregulation of eEF1A mediated either by p53 [23,24] or
in response to oxidative stress [25,26] seems to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/19

involved in apoptosis. It is likely that this broad diversity
of functions may explain why eEF1A is such a well-conserved protein in eukaryotic organisms.
Eukaryotes possess a variable number of eEF1A genes. In
plants from 10 to 15 eEF1A genes have been described in
maize [27], and nine in cotton [28]. In fungi, the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two eEF1A genes [29,30],
and Mucor racemosus has three [31]. In animals, the fruit
fly Drosophila melanogaster contains two genes, one of
which is found to be expressed only in certain stages of
development [32]. Three eEF1A genes in Xenopus laevis are
expressed at different developmental stages: the oocyte
form (eEF-1 O), present in male and female germ cells, the
somatic form (eEF-1 S), hardly detectable in oocytes but
present in embryos and adult cells, and the 42Sp50 form,
detected only in oocytes [33-35]. In the mammalian
genome many eEF1A-like loci exist, most of which appear
to be pseudogenes [36-38]. In fact, only two of these
sequences are currently known to be actively expressed in
human [39,40], mouse [41,42], rat [43-46], and rabbit
[47,48]. The two eEF1A protein isoforms encoded by
these genes are currently termed eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, and
display a quite different expression pattern in tissues.
Whereas eEF1A1 is expressed in all tissues, eEF1A2 is only
present in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, which are tissues composed of cells locked in a state of nonproliferation [40,45,49,50]. In teleosts, only one actively
transcribed eEF1A gene has been reported in Danio rerio
[51], Sparus aurata [52], Oreochromis niloticus [53], and
Oryzias latipes [54]. In flatfish, partial sequences of one
expressed eEF1A gene have been described in Scophthalmus maximus [55], Paralichthys olivaceus [56], and Paralichthys lethostigma [57].
Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis (Pleuronectiformes:
Soleidae), is a commercially important flatfish. This species undergoes metamorphosis from 12 to 19 days post
hatch (DPH) during larval development. The process
involves jaw and head restructuring, eye migration from
the left to the right side, and a change from a symmetrical
to an asymmetrical body shape [58]. These drastic morphological changes have been shown to be regulated by
thyroid hormones (THs) in flatfish [59,60]. Nevertheless,
few data are available about the biological role of eEF1A
in flatfish metamorphosis. In fact, only in Scophthalmus
maximus this question has been somehow addressed. In
this species, coincident T4 and eEF1A expression peaks are
detected at the climax of metamorphosis [55]. Nevertheless, the gene expression pattern of Senegalese sole eEF1A
during larval development and in tissues, and its dependence on THs, remains to be elucidated.
Large-scale genomics of Senegalese sole has allowed for
the availability of a high number of EST sequences. In this

study, we have identified and characterized five different
eEF1A genes, referred to as SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3,
SseEF1A4, and Sse42Sp50. The main sequence features are
described hereinafter. A phylogenetic analysis was carried
out to identify putative ortholog sequences. Gene expression profiles during larval development and in tissues
from juvenile soles were explored using real-time PCR.
Additionally, thiourea (TU) and T4 treatments were carried out in order to reveal the possible dependence of all
SseEF1A expressions on THs.

Results
Molecular characterization of Senegalese sole eEF1A
genes
Five Senegalese sole eEF1A genes, referred to as SseEF1A1,
SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4, and Sse42Sp50, were identified after EST analysis of a normalized cDNA library constructed from different larval stages (pre-, meta- and postmetamorphosis), undifferentiated gonads, and six adult
tissues (testis, ovary, stomach, intestine, liver and brain).
A total of 69, 10, 3, 1 and 4 clones were identified as
SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4 and Sse42Sp50,
respectively [DDBJ:AB326302 to AB326306]. Sequencing
of specific PCR products amplified from a pre-metamorphic library using Senegalese sole eEF1A-specific and the
universal T3 and T7 primers confirmed sequences for all
SseEF1A loci.

Main features of the cDNAs are summarized in Table 1.
The cDNA lengths ranged between 1,523 and 1,743 nucleotides (nt) for SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A1, respectively. All of
them contained a short 5'-untranslated region (between
31–73 nt) followed by an open reading frame of 1,365 nt
(455 codons; positions 74–1,438 for Sse42Sp50), 1,386 nt
(462 codons; positions 48–1,433, 35–1,420, and 32–
1,417 for SseEF1A1, SseEF1A3, and SseEF1A4, respectively), and 1,389 nt (463 codons; positions 40–1,428 for
SseEF1A2). The 3'-untranslated region varied between 103
(SseEF1A3) and 310 (SseEF1A1) nt long and included one
(SseEF1A2, SseEF1A4 and Sse42Sp50) or two (SseEF1A1
and SseEF1A3) canonical polyadenylation signals
(AATAAA), and a short oligo-A tail. The nucleotide
sequences surrounding the ATG initiator codon fit well to

the consensus sequence of Kozak [61], including A
(SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A4) or G
(Sse42Sp50) at position -3 and G at position +4 (considering position +1 the A from the ATG start codon). The predicted molecular weights and isoelectric points of the
translated amino acid sequences of Senegalese sole eEF1A
genes ranged between 49.86-50.53 kDa and 9.13-9.69,
respectively.
All SseEF1As possessed the characteristic regions G1 to G4
critical in GDP/GTP exchange, GTP-induced conformational change and GTP hydrolysis (Figure 1) [1]. The three
consensus elements GXXXXGK (G14-K20), DXXG (D91G94) and NKXD (N153-D156) [2] were identified in the
GTP-binding domain of the Senegalese sole polypeptides.
In addition, the predicted amino acid sequences were
scanned against the PROSITE database of sequence
motifs. The conserved motif DKLKAERERGITIDI(A/S)
was identified at positions 61 to 76 in each of SseEF1As as
the GTP-binding elongation factor signature (Figure 1).
SseEF1A genes shared high sequence homology at nucleotide level in the coding region (62.9–88.6% identity)
and at amino acid level (66.7–89.8% identity). A multiple
alignment was performed with the DNA (Table 2; below
diagonal) and amino acid sequences (Table 2; above diagonal) of eEF1A from other vertebrates (see Table 3). As
observed for Senegalese sole sequences, the identities
obtained in all the pairwise comparisons were lower at
DNA than at amino acid level, indicating that the highest
sequence variation was at the third codon positions. Identities of SseEF1A1 and SseEF1A2 amino acid sequences
were higher than those determined for SseEF1A3 and
SseEF1A4 with regard to eEF1A from the other species. By
the other side, 42Sp50 sequences exhibited high identities, with values above 87% in the comparisons performed.
The phylogenetic relationships of the five SseEF1As as
well as the predicted protein sequence of other vertebrate
eEF1A genes were determined using the maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods. The ProtTest analysis [62] determined the JTT + G model as being

SseEF1A4 appeared in a more basal position of both trees,
and no consistent clustering with any of the sequences
added was observed.
Expression levels of SseEF1A genes in tissues
Steady-state levels of the five SseEF1A transcripts were
quantitated in liver, spleen, intestine, stomach, head-kidney, gills, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and skin from
juvenile soles (Figure 4A). Relative gene expression levels
were normalized by measuring Ubiquitin gene and
expressed relative to liver. All SseEF1A genes were found in
detectable amounts in the tissues examined. SseEF1A1
transcripts were quite similar in all tissues examined
except in muscle (60-fold lower than in liver; P < 0.05).
SseEF1A2 reached the highest expression levels in skeletal
muscle, heart, and brain (28, 17, and 9-fold higher than
liver, respectively; P < 0.05). SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A4
showed very similar expression patterns, as they were
strongly expressed in gills (750 and 13,000-fold higher
than liver, respectively; P < 0.001) and skin (500 and
6,000-fold higher than liver, respectively; P < 0.001).
Finally, Sse42Sp50 was expressed at a relatively high level
in brain (32-fold higher than liver; P < 0.001).

Although they exhibited differential expression profiles,
we calculated the relative amount of the five SseEF1A
mRNA levels in the 10 tissues examined (Figure 4B). As a
whole, SseEF1A1 transcripts were the most abundant with
60, 2,000, 62,000, and 35,000-fold higher overall mean
expression ratios than SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4, and
Sse42Sp50, respectively. Nevertheless, SseEF1A2 showed
the highest values in muscle (20-fold higher than
SseEF1A1), and it was only 4 and 3-fold lower expressed

than SseEF1A1 in brain and heart, respectively. SseEF1A3
and SseEF1A4 reached relatively important expression levels in gills (7 and 3-fold lower than SseEF1A1, respectively) and skin (14 and 8-fold lower than SseEF1A1,
respectively). Finally, Sse42Sp50 was expressed at very low
amounts in all tissues.
Expression levels and regulation during larval development
Expression patterns of SseEF1A genes during larval development (from 2 to 22 DPH) were also determined. Data
were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH2) [63], and
further expressed relative to 2 DPH. All transcripts were
detected very early at 2 DPH (Figure 5A). Nevertheless,
they displayed different expression profiles during development. SseEF1A1 transcripts remained relatively constant with no significant changes between premetamorphosis and metamorphosis. A similar expression
pattern was observed for SseEF1A3, although a significant
peak in mRNA levels was observed at first feeding (1.89fold; P < 0.05). The expression profile of SseEF1A2 and
SseEF1A4 was quite similar. Both transcripts were constant until 15 DPH, when they increased significantly (7
and 22-fold, respectively; P < 0.001), and thereafter they
rose progressively until the end of metamorphosis. In
relation to Sse42Sp50, the highest expression levels were
detected at first developmental stages with no significant
changes from 6 to 22 DPH. As observed in tissues,
SseEF1A1 was the most abundantly expressed of all genes
during larval development (Figure 5B).

To study the involvement of THs on the expression of
SseEF1A genes, 7 DPH larvae were exposed to the goitro-

determined by the degree of eye migration. No differences
in survivability were observed with respect to the
untreated control (not shown). mRNA levels for SseEF1A
genes were quantified in whole larvae pools collected at 8
hours, and 6 days, 11 days, and 15 days after treatment
(dat). Untreated control larvae exhibited expression profiles similar to those described above in all cases (Figure
6). No significant differences in gene expression were
observed for SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3 and
Sse42sp50 between untreated control and TU-treated larvae. However, TU-treated larvae showed 3 and 4-fold
lower (P < 0.05) SseEF1A4 mRNA levels than untreated
controls at both 11 and 15 dat, respectively.

At the sight of these results, we carried out a rescue assay to
determine the ability of T4 to revert the TU effect on the
expression of SseEF1A4. For this purpose, 4 DPH larvae
were exposed to TU to ensure the lack of endogenously
synthesized T4 at day 7, when the exogenous T4 (100 ppb)
was supplied. mRNA levels of SseEF1A4 gene were determined in larvae sampled at 8 and 13 days after T4 treatment (datt). The metamorphosis blocking induced by TU
was not observed in TU+T4 treated larvae. The expression
patterns of untreated and TU-treated larvae were similar to
those described above (Figures 5 and 6). Interestingly,
TU+T4 treated larvae exhibited significantly higher
SseEF1A4 transcript levels than untreated (10.5 and 2-fold;
P < 0.05) and TU-treated (16.8 and 8.7-fold; P < 0.05) larvae both at 8 and 13 datt, respectively (Figure 7).

Discussion
Three rounds of large-scale gene duplications, referred to
as 1R, 2R, and 3R or fish-specific genome duplication,
have been proposed to take place in the fish evolutionary
lineage [64,65]. As a result, several gene copies have been
described in teleosts for some group of genes including
glycolytic enzymes [63,64], Hox genes [66,67], hormones
and their receptors [68,69], and keratins [70]. The majority of gene duplicates have been lost or silenced during
evolution but in some instances paralogue genes have
picked up new functions (neofunctionalization), or
divided the ancestral function between paralogs (subfunctionalization) [71,72]. Such a selective advantage would
have avoided loss of functionally active duplicates. In this
study, we have obtained the complete cDNA sequence of
five distinct Senegalese sole eEF1A genes, referred to as
SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4, and Sse42Sp50.
All of them share high identity at both nucleotide (62.988.6%) and amino acid (66.7-89.8%) levels. Amino acid
sequence analysis of the predicted polypeptides revealed
the presence of the consensus amino acid sequence that
identifies a GTP-binding protein [1,2] in all of them with

spacing between the characteristic sequence elements
GXXXXGK (G14-K20), DXXG (D91-G94) and NKXD (N153D156) that fell into the expected size (40–80 residues).
Furthermore, the five Senegalese sole proteins possessed
the characteristic motif that provides a signature for GTPbinding elongation factor. Altogether, these results indicate that SseEF1A genes actually encode for functional
eEF1A proteins.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using a wide range
of vertebrate eEF1A predicted proteins. A number of
sequences found in the complete genome of several teleosts and mammals belonging to eEF1A family were also
included, although it is not known if such sequences are
actively transcribed or represent pseudogenes. Phylogeny
gives strong support to the classification of SseEF1A1 as
the Senegalese sole ortholog of teleost eEF1A. Furthermore, we can consider that teleost eEF1A, including
SseEF1A1, is the fish counterpart of tetrapod eEF1A1.
Such a conclusion is based on two main observations.
Firstly, the high sequence identities of teleost with tetrapod eEF1A proteins as obtained with the sequences

employed in this study, ranging between 86.6–89.9%
(not shown). And secondly, gene expression analyses
indicate that teleost eEF1A [52-54] as well as SseEF1A is a
highly abundant mRNA transcript that exhibits a relatively uniform distribution across many tissues, as
observed in mammalian eEF1A1 [40,45,48,49,73]. In
contrast, strikingly enough, turbot SmaEF1A as well as the
predicted polypeptides of one O. latipes and G. aculeatus
sequences appeared closely linked to SseEF1A2 in a different clade to teleost eEF1A, being even more closely related
to mammalian (and avian) eEF1A isoforms. According to
the expression pattern in tissues of SseEF1A2, we suggest
that this fish paralog represents the counterpart to mammalian eEF1A2. In this sense, northern blot and immunoblotting analyses have revealed that expression of
mammalian eEF1A2 is limited to the terminally differentiated cells of the skeletal muscle, brain, and heart
[40,45,48,49,73], the same tissues where SseEF1A2
reached the highest expression levels. If this gene is only
expressed in the species analyzed here or in a wide range

of flatfish or teleosts is a problem that needs to be resolved
in future studies. In any case, the presence of these two
genes in fish and mammals suggests that such gene duplication was an early evolutionary event. An interesting
issue is that, in contrast to teleost, a close phylogenetic
relatedness between mammalian eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 isoforms was observed. One possible explanation for this
important difference is the increased evolutionary rate
that is known to occur in fish genes [74] making sequence
divergence between mammalian and fish counterparts
comparable to a pair of fish paralogous genes.
The biological roles of mammalian eEF1A isoforms have
been widely studied [6,8,75]. At present, it is unclear why
there are two isoforms of eEF1A. In vitro, the translational
elongation activity is similar but there is a difference in the
off-rate for GDP as eEF1A2 binds GDP more strongly than
GTP, whereas the opposite is true for eEF1A1 [48]. Given
that eEF1A2 is expressed specifically in cells that have permanently withdrawn from the cell cycle such as neurons,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/19

because it was poorly resolved, mainly due to the fact that
no teleost (and no mammalian) sequence significantly
clustered with them. Furthermore, we have failed to identify possible counterparts in the complete genome of
other teleosts and mammals available in databases. Nevertheless, we argue that both SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A4 are
probably the result of recent gene duplications. Both
genes expressed mainly in gills and skin, two tissues
involved in respiratory and osmoregulatory processes
[78]. It is tempting to assume that they could be involved
in the translational regulation of factors playing a role in
such important biological activities in the Senegalese sole.
And in the case of SseEF1A4, an additional role in metamorphosis will be discussed below.

cardiomyocites and myocites [40,41,48], it has been suggested that eEF1A2 may be involved in pathways of protein synthesis specifically for nonproliferating cells or in
the non-translational roles suggested for eEF1A. It seems
that eEF1A2 is anti-apoptotic [76], which is closely related
with its possible role in tumourigenesis [17,20,77]. If we
consider the high degree of structural and functional relatedness existing between eEF1A from different organisms,
it is highly probable that fish orthologous genes carry out
the same functions as mammalian isoforms.
All 42Sp50 proteins grouped together in a highly consistent cluster both in ML and NJ trees. Although orthologous
genes have been described in other teleosts, we could no
identify a mammalian counterpart in any of the complete
genomes available in databases. Thus, it seems that this
gene was lost early in the evolution of tetrapods. Little
information is found concerning its possible function. In
X. laevis, 42Sp50 transcripts have only been detected in
oocytes, and the protein interacts with other components
of the 42S RNP particle, which serves as storage of 5S
rRNA and various tRNAs [34]. Senegalese sole Sse42Sp50
was expressed in all tissues examined, but at a highly significant lesser amount than SseEF1A1. Phylogeny of
SseEF1A3 and SseEF1A4 is more difficult to interpret

Metamorphosis in flatfish is characterized by the change
from a symmetrical, pelagic larva to an asymmetric, benthic juvenile, and by the eye migration from one side of
the head to the other. THs have shown to play a key role
in flatfish metamorphosis. Important physiological and
molecular switches in erythropoiesis, myosin light chains,
troponin T, and gill mitochondria-rich cells as well as differentiation of gastric glands and epidermal adult cells,
and re-organization of the neural retina skin have been
reported to occur during this dramatic process in a THs
dependent manner [79-85]. More recently, it has also
been reported that THs down-regulate GAPDH1 transcripts after metamorphosis climax [63] demonstrating
the dependence of the glycolytic pathway on THs. With
regard to eEF1A an expression peak at the climax of metamorphosis, coincident with a T4 peak, has been detected
in turbot [55]. Interestingly, regulation by THs of the germ
cell specific EF-1αO gene has been demonstrated during
metamorphosis in X. laevis [86]. The start of metamorphosis has been associated to a surge of THs that increase
their levels until the metamorphic climax, and reduce
towards post-climax [59,60]. In this study, the possible
regulation of SseEF1A genes by THs was analyzed using
TU and combined TU+T4 treatments. TU is a blocking
agent of THs synthesis that can reduce T4 levels by about
95% [82]. Exogenous treatments with TU as well as other
types of thyroid inhibitors have proved useful to study the
involvement of THs on metamorphosis in flatfish
[59,82,84] and the transcriptional regulation of genes
involved in the pituitary-thyroid axis [87,88]. TU-treated
larvae exhibited significantly lower SseEF1A4 transcripts
levels than untreated larvae at late metamorphosis,
whereas mRNA levels of the other four genes remained
relatively unchanged. In contrast, addition of T4 increased
the amount of SseEF1A4 transcripts to significantly higher
levels than those detected in untreated and TU-treated larvae. These results demonstrate that THs up-regulate either
directly or indirectly SseEF1A4 expression, and constitute
the first report of the dependence on THs of an elongation
factor gene during flatfish metamorphosis. Although fur-

ther research will be required to elucidate the precise role
of SseEF1A4 in the drastic changes that occur during metamorphosis, it can be hypothesized that SseEF1A4 is
involved in the translational regulation of the factors that
promote an appropriate transition from larval to juvenile
stage in response to THs. In fact, elongation factors are
directly involved in the regulation of peptide synthesis
[89,90]. Yet, other non-translational functions during
metamorphosis cannot be ruled out.

Conclusion
In conclusion, in this work we describe the sequence and
main features of five eEF1A genes in the Senegalese sole,
referred to as SseEF1A1, SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4,
and Sse42Sp50. Combined phylogenetic and tissue
expression analyses revealed SseEF1A1 and SseEF1A2 as
the putative counterparts of mammalian eEF1A1 and
eEF1A2, respectively, and Sse42Sp50 as the ortholog of X.
laevis and teleost 42Sp50. In contrast, SseEF1A3 and
SseEF1A4 represent novel genes, as orthologous genes
have not been identified neither in fish nor mammals.
The five genes exhibited different expression patterns during larval development. TU and T4 treatments demonstrated that SseEF1A4 was up-regulated by THs, suggesting
a role in the translational regulation of the factors
involved in the dramatic changes that occur during Senegalese sole metamorphosis. The regulation and interaction of Senegalese sole elongation factors with other genes
are questions that need to be clarified in the future and
will help to improve the aquaculture conditions for this
species. Wih regard to this, present work constitutes
undoubtly a useful framework for further studies.

Methods
Source of fish and experimental rearing conditions
All experimental sole larvae were obtained from fertilized
eggs collected from breeding tanks, where breeders
spawned naturally under environmental conditions. Eggs
were incubated at a density of 2,000 eggs L-1 in 300 L cylinder conical tanks with gentle aeration, and water
exchange every two hours. Temperature and salinity during all experiments were 20°C and 38 psu, respectively.
Newly hatched larvae were transferred to a 400 L tank at
an initial density of 45 to 50 larvae L-1 with a 16L:8D photoperiod, and a light intensity of 600–800 lux. Larvae were
fed rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) 3 DPH until 9 DPH.
Enriched Artemia metanauplii were fed to them from 7
DPH until the end of the experiment. Pools of larvae from
2 to 22 DPH (n = 3) were collected, washed with DEPC
water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until
analysis. Metamorphic stages (S0-S4) were classified
according to [58].

Chronic exposure to 30 ppm TU was achieved in 200 L
round tanks. TU was added on day 7, and water was kept

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/19

stagnant for 24 hours. After this exposure, 20% of the
water was exchanged daily, with the subsequent addition
of the eliminated TU. A second tank with the same characteristics was used to rear untreated control sole larvae.
Larvae were initially stocked at a density of 100 individual
L-1, and lights were kept off until the onset of external
feeding on 3 DPH. Fluorescent lamps supplied an illumination of 800 lux on the water surface, while a 16L:8D
light cycle was used. Larvae were fed rotifers (Brachionus
plicatilis) and 48 hours Artemia metanauplii, according to
the experimental design. The Haptophyceae Isochrysis galbana (T-ISO strain) was employed for the enrichment of
both live preys, and was also added (2 mg dry weight L-1
d-1) to larval tanks during rotifer feed. Daily larval samples
were removed for metamorphosis control. Pools of larvae
(n = 3) were also collected, washed with DEPC water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until analysis.
For the rescue experiments, culture conditions were the
same as described above, but 30 ppm TU was added on
day 4 to ensure lack of endogenously synthesized T4 at the
commencement of exogenous T4 treatment. At day 7,
untreated control larvae were transferred to a pair of 16 L
cylinder conical tubes at an initial density of 45 larvae L-1.
TU-treated larvae were transferred to 4 tubes, two of which
were supplemented with 100 ppb T4. After this new exposure, 20% of the water was exchanged every two days, with
the subsequent addition of the eliminated TU and TU+T4.
Pools of larvae (n = 3) were collected 8 and 13 days after
the commencement of T4 treatment, washed with DEPC
water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until
analysis.
Juvenile Senegalese sole individuals (average weight =
169.60 ± 24.3 g; n = 3) were obtained from IFAPA Centro
El Toruño facilities (El Puerto Santa María, Cádiz, Spain).
They were sacrificed by immersion in tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) according to the guidelines on the care
and use of fish in research, teaching and testing from the
Canadian Council on Animal Care (2005). Head-kidney,
liver, testis, brain, heart, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen,
intestine, stomach, and gills were rapidly dissected, frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until use.
Identification and sequence analyses of elongation factor
1 alpha cDNAs in Senegalese sole
Ten cDNA libraries were constructed from different larval
stages and adult tissues of Senegalese sole using the ZAP
Express® cDNA Syntesis kit and Zap Express cDNA Gigapack® III Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene) following the
manufacturer's protocol (Cerdà et al., in preparation).
Libraries were pooled and normalized, and approximately
11,000 randomly selected clones were sequenced from
the 3'-end. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding
eEF1A genes were identified after EST annotation.

Sequences have been deposited with accession numbers
[DDBJ:AB326302 to AB326306].
Alignments of the predicted polypeptide sequences were
carried out, and the sequence identities calculated by the
MegAlign program from the LASERGENE software suite.
For this purpose as well as for the ML and NJ phylogenetic
analyses, predicted polypeptides of a range of vertebrate
eEF1A sequences retrieved from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ
were used (Table 3). Additional sequences belonging to
the eEF1A family were retrieved from ENSEMBL (Table 3).
Drosophila melanogaster [GeneBank:NM_079872) and
Artemia [EMBL:X03349] elongation factor 1 alpha
sequences were used as outgroups to root ML and NJ trees.
The bestfit model of sequence evolution was determined
by using the ProtTest v1.3 [62]. Phylogenetic analysis was
carried out using the PHYLIP package [91] as follows. A
bootstrap analysis was performed using SEQBOOT (200
replicates for ML; 1000 replicates for NJ). Data were then
analyzed by ML using the software PHYML that generated
200 trees. The consensus phylogenetic tree was then
obtained (CONSENSE). For NJ, data were analyzed with
PROTDIST that generated 1000 distance matrices. The
program NEIGHBOR was then employed to generate
1000 trees. Finally, the consensus phylogenetic tree was
obtained using CONSENSE. Trees were drawn using the
TreeViewX program v0.5.0. Presence of known domains
in the predicted protein sequence of Senegalese sole
eEF1As was determined by scanning in the PROSITE database [92].
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
Homogenization of juvenile tissues and larvae was carried
out using the Lysing Matrix D (Q-BioGene) for 40 s at
speed setting 6 in the Fastprep FG120 instrument
(Bio101). Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of pooled
larvae using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All RNA isolation procedures were performed in accordance with the

142

62

manufacturer's protocol. In all cases, total RNA was
treated twice with DNase I using the RNase-Free DNase kit
(Qiagen) for 30 min in order to avoid amplification of
genomic DNA. RNA sample quality was checked using
Experion (Bio-Rad), and quantification was performed
spectrophotometrically. Total RNA (1 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Lack of genomic DNA contamination
was confirmed by PCR amplification of RNA samples in
the absence of cDNA synthesis.
Real-time analysis was carried out on an iCycler (BioRad). Matching oligonucleotide primers were designed
using the Oligo v6.89 software (Medprobe). To confer
specificity, each Senegalese sole eEF1A primer pair
(Table 4) was designed using as template the corresponding 3'-UTR, where the high sequence variability made
impossible to correctly align them. In addition, amplification of specific SseEF1A encoding cDNA fragments was
verified by direct sequencing of PCR products in a previous assay. Real-time reactions were accomplished in a 25
μl volume containing cDNA generated from 10 ng of original RNA template, 300 nM each of specific forward (F)
and reverse (R) primers, and 12.5 μl of iQ™ SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad). The amplification protocol used was
as follows: initial 7 min denaturation and enzyme activation at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 70°C for 30
s. Each assay was done in duplicate. For normalization of
cDNA loading, all samples were run in parallel using the
housekeeping genes GAPDH2 [63] or Ubiquitin as loading
standards for larval development and tissues, respectively
(Table 4). To estimate efficiencies, a standard curve was
generated for each primer pair based on known quantities
of cDNA (10-fold serial dilutions corresponding to cDNA
transcribed from 100 to 0.01 ng of total RNA). All calibration curves exhibited correlation coefficients higher than
0.99, and the corresponding real-time PCR efficiencies
were in the range 0.92–0.98. Relative mRNA expression

was determined using the 2-(ΔΔCt) method [93]. To compare the amount of each of the Senegalese sole transcripts,
the relative mRNA expression was determined by subtracting the Ct value of GAPDH2 or Ubiquitin mRNA from the
Ct value of the target mRNA. Data were then expressed as
the ratio (calculated using 2-(ΔCt)) of target mRNA to reference (GAPDH2 or Ubiquitin) mRNA. Owing to the small
differences among amplicons both in size (62–142) and
%GC (52.8, 58.1, 52.4, 46.7 and 67.8% for SseEF1A1,
SseEF1A2, SseEF1A3, SseEF1A4 and Sse42Sp50, respectively), the relative sensitivity factor KRS was assumed to be
one [94].
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparisons
among groups were carried out with one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey test for identification of the statistically distinct groups. Significance was
accepted for P < 0.05.
