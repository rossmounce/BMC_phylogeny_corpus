Abstract
Background: Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) are crucial enzymes
in DNA synthesis. In alveolata both enzymes are expressed as one bifunctional enzyme.
Results: Loss of this essential enzyme activities after successful allelic assortment of knock out
alleles yields an auxotrophic marker in ciliates. Here the cloning, characterisation and functional
analysis of Tetrahymena thermophila's DHFR-TS is presented. A first aspect of the presented work
relates to destruction of DHFR-TS enzyme function in an alveolate thereby causing an auxotrophy
for thymidine. A second aspect is to knock in an expression cassette encoding for a foreign gene
with subsequent expression of the target protein.
Conclusion: This system avoids the use of antibiotics or other drugs and therefore is of high
interest for biotechnological applications.

Background
Tetrahymena thermophila is a ciliated eukaryotic unicellular
organism belonging to the regnum of protozoa and bearing two nuclei, a transcriptionally silent, diploid germline
micronucleus (MIC) and a transcriptionally active, polyploid somatic macronucleus (MAC)[1]. In 1923, when
Nobel Laureate Andre Lwoff succeeded in growing Tetrahymena in pure culture, the basis for exploiting this alveolate as a model organism was laid. Milestone discoveries
made in T. thermophila are the discovery of dynein
motors[2], telomeres[3], RNA-mediated catalysis[4], telomerase[5] and the function of histone acetyltransferases
in transcription regulation[6]. Within the last decades

molecular biological techniques have been developed to
alter T. thermophila's genome and proteome: DNA transfection methods range from microinjection[7] and electroporation[8] into the MAC to biolistic bombardment of
MIC and MAC[9]. Episomal plasmids based on an rDNAreplicon are available[10], as well as knock out/-in techniques based on homologous recombination[11,12].
On protein level heterologous expression of related species has been performed[13,14] and also endogenous proteins were silenced by a novel antisense-ribosometechnique[15]. The biotechnological potential of T. thermophila has been proven in numerous publications, demPage 1 of 11

Although known and analysed for decades, only a few
markers have been described for T. thermophila. So far

there are ribosomal point mutation mediated resistances,
a plasmid based neomycin resistance[19] and a beta-tubulin selection marker making use of an inducible promoter
in combination with mutated tubulins being resistant or
sensitive to the mitotic drug taxol[20]. Yet no true auxo-

trophic marker is available that permits selection without
the use of antibiotics or drugs.
Critical enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS).
DHFR catalyses the production of tetrahydrofolate from
dihydrofolate; TS is in charge of transferring a methylgroup from N5, N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate to
dUMP thereby generating dTMP and tetrahydrofolate.
These enzymes being crucial for pyrimidine synthesis
have been used as auxotrophic markers in various systems
by targeted gene disruption but also a number of inhibitors (antifolates) have been developed as anti-cancer
drugs[21]. In animals, fungi and eubacteria the DHFR and
TS gene are separately translated, whereas plants, alveolata and euglenozoa have a bifunctional fusion gene with
both enzyme activities combined in one protein ("DHFRTS").
The occurrence of the bifunctional enzyme in T. pyriformis
has been postulated in 1984 and 1985 but no functional
or even molecular biological analysis had been performed. A partial amino acid sequence of DHFR-TS of a
non determined "T. pyriformis-like strain" has been published in 2002[22], but this work is lacking any proof of
linkage to the described partial cDNA to enzyme function.
Here we present a first characterization of the T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene including gene structure and functional data on the enzyme and data on in vivo function.
For the first time we show that the T. thermophila DHFRTS locus provides an auxotrophic marker system that enables monitoring of allelic assortment processes. As PCR
based approaches always have to cope with wildtype alleles present in the MIC, the DHFR-TS auxotrophy system is
able to deliver direct proof of the allelic assortment to be
completed: Only in the case of all wildtype alleles in the
MAC having been substituted by the knock out construct
the auxotrophy will occur. Combining this methodology
with a knock in, a new, stable and useful strain to express
recombinant enzymes or proteins has been generated.

Results
Tetrahymenathermophila is a free-living ciliated protozoan
that has become increasingly interesting as an excellent
expression system. It is one of the best characterised unicellular eukaryotes and its genome has been sequenced in
its entirety (The Institute for Genomic Research[23]).
These features form the basis for using T. thermophila in
future biotechnology applications. However, appropriate
marker systems that are essential tools for genetic manipulations are limited. The enzymes dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) and thymidylate reductase (TS) play a crucial for
pyrimidine synthesis, therefore both enzymes have been
used as auxotrophic marker-systems in various species by
targeted gene disruption. The aim was to establish such a

DHFR marker system for T. thermophila. Interestingly, the
bifunctional DHFR-TS has been as taxonomic tool to set
up phylogenetic trees for years. These approaches led to a
very rudimental DHFR-TS amino acid fragment sequence
of a non determined "T. pyriformis-like strain". By using
this incomplete information and data from the entire T.
thermophila genome it was possible to determine the
whole sequence of the bifunctional DHFR-TS MAC gene
in T. thermophila. The T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene and its
flanking regions were amplified by using the primer pairs
DHFR 5'1F NotI, DHFR 5'2R BamHI for the 5'region non
coding region, the primer pair DHFR 3'1F XhoI: 5, DHFR
3'1R Acc65I for the 3'region and the primers DHFR CDSF, DHFR CDS-F for amplification of the coding region.
The T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene structure
The comparison of the amino acid sequences of related
species to the translated coding region of the DHFR-TS
structure gene revealed the corresponding cDNA (see figure 1). Alignment with the cDNA with the gene revealed
the intron exon boundaries. Figure 1 summarises the
results and shows the MAC gene structure with two

introns, the corresponding DNA sequence and the amino
acid sequence of the T. thermophila DHFR-TS.
Sequence alignment of the T. thermophila DHFR-TS
enzyme to other alveolates
The alignment of the DHFR-TS between the alveolates Tetrahymena thermophila, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
vivax, Cryptosporidium hominis and Toxoplasma gondii (Tt,
Pf, Pv, Ch, Tg in figure 2) illustrates a 50–60% degree of
identity between the proteins. This is also the case if the
ciliate DHFR-TS is compared to the analogous enzyme of
Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi (Lm, Tc in figure
2). This is almost due to the highly conserved thymidylate
synthase part of the bifunctional enzymes. A highly conserved histidine is found at position 198, suggesting that
the amino acids 198–485 represent the thymidylate synthase part of the bifunctional enzyme. Much more heterogeneity is found in the N-terminal part of the
bifunctional enzyme that consists of the DHFR part and a
linker site. The alignment reveals that almost all enzymes
bear one or more individual, non-homologue amino acid
stretches (figure 2).
Proper integration of the knock out construct into the
DHFR-TS locus and auxotrophy for thymidine
In order to verify that only one DHFR-TS activity is present
in T. thermophila and that the sequence given in figure 1
corresponds to this activity a construct for knocking out

the DHFR-TS gene was made. By inserting the flanking
regions of the DHFR-TS gene into a pBS II SK backbone we
created a plasmid for stable integration into the ciliate
genome. The neo2 cassette of pH4T2[19] was used to
monitor the successful uptake of this plasmid by selection
against paromomycin. Figure 3 shows that the neo2 cassette is flanked by the ~1.5 kb fragments of the 5' and 3'
parts of the non-coding regions of the DHFR-TS gene,
respectively. Because the pBS backbone lacks an appropriate origin of replication, paromomycin resistant T. thermophila clones argue for proper homologous
recombination in the DHFR-TS gene locus.
The most convincing evidence for the correct integration
into the DHFR-TS locus is a loss of the DHFR-TS activity
in the transformed strain. However, in the case of T. thermophila this requires the complete replacement of all
chromosomal DHFR-TS wildtype alleles (~45 ARPs) by
the ARPs that includes the knock out cassette. We
achieved this by allelic assortment, a phenomenon summarised in figure 4. This allelic or phenotypic assortment
is based on randomised distribution of the MAC chromosomes units (ARPs) during mitosis. In order to force the
assortment process into the desired direction – namely
into the recombinant resistance gene – the transformed
cells were cultivated for at least 3–4 weeks using increasing concentrations of the drug paromomycin. Single
clones were isolated and tested for DHFR-TS deficiency by

Growth of
Growth of DHFR-TS deficient T. thermophila compared to wildtype. A: Selection of DHFR-TS knock out cells by
growth on thymidine. T. thermophila cells with disrupted DHFR-TS gene (clone 1–3) do not grow without the presence of thymidine (CDM-T), whereas wildtype cells do. Addition of thymidine to the medium (CDM+T) recovers growth. B: Growth
kinetics of DHFR-TS knock out cells compared to wildtype cells in media with or without thymidine show, that the knock out
strain (pKOI) is growing as fast as wildtype cells on thymidine supplemented media (CDM+T). Knock out cells die without thymidine present (CDM-T). The curves are calculated by mean values of at least three independent experiments.

DHFR-TS knock out clones are real auxotrophic strains.
The mutants are able to grow in CDM with thymidine like
wildtype strains or strains with an incomplete allelic
assortment. In CDM lacking thymidine they are unable to
grow (figure 5).

selected because it allows a clear discrimination between
the DNase activity of heterologously expressed recombinant human DNase I and the basal activity due to at
least two endogenous DNases. The transformation, selection of positive clones and the directed allelic assortment
were done as described in the material and methods section.

Functional addition of an expression cassette to the knock
out construct
The knockout of the endogenous DHFR-TS gene of T. thermophila also provides the possibility to knockin a further
foreign gene that can be expressed heterologously in the
DHFR-TS knock out strains. Therefore we named our constructs pKOI (pKOI: knock out and knock in). To illustrate
this knock out/-in concept we constructed the pKOI DVL
plasmid. It consists of a pKOI backbone with an additional expression cassette that encodes the first 115 amino
acids (aa) of the precursor sequence of the PLA1 gene and
the mature human DNase I (aa 23 to 281). The PLA1 pre/
pro-peptide (aa 1 to 110) has significant similarity to
members of the cathepsin L family and mediates secretion
into the medium[24]. The five additional amino acids (aa
111 to 115) should ensure an optimal cleavage of the pro
PLA1-DNaseI fusion protein by endogenous pro-peptidases. In contrast to the neo2 cassette the expression of the
ppPLA115-DNase I fusion protein is regulated by the
inducible MTT1 promoter[25]. The inducible system was

Furthermore, we tested the correct and complete integration of both expression cassettes (neo2 and the DNase I)
in the DHFR-TS locus by a PCR approach (figure 6). In
order to demonstrate the pKOI concept, cells of these
DHFR-TS knock out strains carrying the ppPLA115-DNase
expression cassette were treated with and without Cadmium. Only induced strains showed an elevated DNase
activity in the supernatant (Figure 7). To confirm this
enzymatic data a specific antiserum against human DNase
I was used to analyse the cell extracts and the supernatant
of these human DNase expressing DHFR-TS knock out
strains by Western blot. The results illustrate that the
DHFR-TS knock out strains are capable of expressing and
secreting the functional recombinant human protein (Figure 8).

Proper integration of DHFR-TS knock out construct
Proper integration of DHFR-TS knock out construct. This figure illustrates the PCR approach to determine that the
knock out/-in construct has integrated into the DHFR-TS gene locus. Three different cells were tested: KI is a wildtype control,
KII are cells transfected with a plasmid carrying only the disrupting cassettes but no DHFR-TS gene sequences and pKOI DVL
are cells transformed with the pKOI DVL plasmid. PCR1 is a control reaction amplyfing 369 bp of the beta-hexosaminidase
gene. PCR2 is to detect endogenous DHFR-TS (note that in the pKOIDVL cells there still is a wildtype gene in the MIC). PCR3
only yields PCR-product for correctly integrated pKOI DVL DNA. PCR4 shows that the full-length expression cassette has integrated. The first scheme illustrate the overall structure of the DHFR-TS gene, exons are coloured in green and introns in blue.
The parts of the non-coding 5' and 3' regions of the DHFR-TS structure gene that we used as integration sites in the pKOI/
pKOI DVL plasmids are coloured in grey. The next scheme gives on overall structure of the pKOIDVL expression construct that
was used for transformation and integration into the MAC. The third scheme illustrates the disruption of the endogenous
DHFR-TS structure gene by proper integration of the resistance and expression cassettes into the MAC.

expression cassettes in the developing new MAC [28].

and

It is well known that altering the cell's phenotype ultimately needs direct or indirect (by MIC transformation
and conjugation) genetic engineering of the vegetative
MAC. The first approaches for heterologous expression
were done by using plasmids that use the vast amplification of the rDNA gene during anlagen/MAC development.
However, the episomal presence of these plasmids
depends on the drug concentration and the plasmid may
recombine homologously and non-directionally into
endogenous rDNA units.
Stable integration of expression cassettes into diploid MIC
can be achieved by biolistic bombardment. After conjugation of two different mating types the old MACs disappear
and new ones form that carry the new information
derived from the recombinant MIC. The whole process
follows the statistics of the Mendelian genetics. The
advantage of this approach is that one obtains stable
clones that maintain the genetic properties and that can
be crossed via classical genetics to combine various properties of different T. thermophila strains. This approach is
elaborative and time consuming. Furthermore, it has been
shown recently that scan RNAs (snRNA) derived from the
old MAC play an important role in DNA elimination during the development of the somatic MAC from the germline MIC (see [27] for review). The primary sequence of
these small RNAs explains how the parental MAC epige-

Therefore instead of episomal transformation by rDNA
based plasmids or the stable transformation of the MIC
we used a shortcut by combining MAC transformation
with allelic assortment. This combination has several
advantages. Firstly, the MAC transformation is much
more efficient because there are at least about 45 potential
integration sites per gene locus. This increases the probability of integration to at least one order of magnitude.
Secondly, not only conjugating but also non-conjugating
and therefore defined strains can be transformed. This is
very important, because it allows the stepwise improvement of strains by maintaining defined genetic properties.
Thirdly after completed allelic assortment the use of any
antibiotic is obsolete as wildtype alleles have vanished in
a one-way-manner. This allows cheap cultivation at large
scales for e.g. biotechnical production processes.

Conclusion
In summary use of the DHFR-TS gene locus as a target for
homologous genomic integration does not only provide a
robust and simple marker system to assure complete
allelic assortment of altered ARPs in the MAC but also the
pKOI concept combining the DHFR-TS knock out with an
additional knock in and subsequent expression of foreign
genes.

(neo2) was cloned into the intermediate pBS IISK by
BamHI and SmaI sites. Finally, the 3'-DHFR-TS integration site was amplified by primers DHFR 3' 1 F XhoI and
DHFR 3' 1 R Acc65I and cloned by using the XhoI and

Acc65I sites to finish the DHFR-TS knock out cassette. The
SacI site of the pBS II SK backbone had been destroyed by
site directed mutagenesis to facilitate the use of the endogenous SacI site in the 3'-DHFR-TS integrating sequence
and the XhoI site as unique cloning site in pKOI. The
whole pKOI basis vector is ~7.7 kb in size and contains a
multiple cloning site (figure 3).
Construction of pKOI DVL
The unique XhoI and SacI sites were used to insert the
ppPLA115-DNase knock in expression cassette (~2.5 kb).
This cassette encodes a fusion protein of the first 115 aa of
the endogenous PLA1 precursor and the aa 23–281 of the
mature human DNaseI, flanked by a ~1 kb MTT1 promotor active sequence and the ~0.4 kb BTU2 terminator,
leading to a ~10.2 kb vector. To ensure proper translation
of this fusion protein a codon optimised synthetic human
DNase I gene was used (submitted at BMC Biotechnol.)

The junction sequence between the MTT1 promoter and
the precursor sequence of PLA1 is given with the sequence
ATGgatatcAAC, using a EcoRV site (gatatc) between the
initial ATG of the MTT1 gene and the second codon
(AAC) of the PLA1 precursor sequence. The cDNA that
encodes the ppPLA115-DNase I fusion protein ends with
the TGA stop codon followed by a BglII site (agatct).
Therefore the "knock in" cassette (generated in an intermediate vector) offers a modular structure that allows the
simple replacement of the promoter (by XhoI/EcoRV), the
coding sequence (by EcoRV/BglII) and the terminator
DNA sequences (by BglII/SacI). Further details of the
primers and constructs are available from the authors.
Transformation of pKOI plasmids (biolistic bombardment)
We used conjugating cells, as well as vegetative, growing
or stationary T. thermophila strains. The transformation of
the T. thermophila cells was performed as previously
described in[9].
Selection, allelic assortment and DHFR-TS knock out assay
T. thermophila cell proliferation assay: For the first ca 16 h
after biolistic bombardment transformants were grown in
skimmed milk medium. After that transformed cells were
grown on SPP medium with in increasing concentrations
of paromomycin (from 100 µg/mL to 1000 µg/mL) to
support the allelic assortment process. After 3–4 weeks
each clone was cultivated on CDM replica plates with or
without thymidine (10 mg/mL). Functional DHFR-TS
knock out clones are only able to grow in CDM medium
supplemented with thymidine. The viability of the DHFRTS knock out strains was monitored by determining the
growth kinetic. The complete integration of the DHFR-TS
knock out and DNase I knock in cassette was confirmed
by PCR using the following primers:

A pH4T2 plasmid carrying the same neo2 and DNase I
expression/secretion cassettes was used as PCR control.
SDS-PAGE and Western blot
Aliquots of transformed cells and of SPP supernatants
were resuspended in sample buffer and separated on 15 %
SDS-PAGE. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes and blocked in PBS containing 0.05 % Tween
20 and 5 % skim milk (PBS-TM). The expression of
recombinant human DNase I in transformed Ciliates was
detected by two specific anti sera from rabbit against
human DNase I (antigen: recombinant human DNase I,
Pulmozyme, Roche). Both sera detected the recombinant
DNase I antigen. The serum was used in a 1:500 dilution
in PBS-TM. After washing with PBS/T and applying an
HRP-conjugated anti rabbit serum. The blots were developed by using chemiluminescence.
DNase I activity assay
The methyl green based DNase activity assay was performed as already published [30]. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 24 h on a microtiter plate. Absorbance
was measured at 620 nm. Calibration of the assay was
achieved by different amounts of defined DNase I Units of
Pulmozyme from Roche (CHO derived) in each experiment and linear regression. These results combined with
semi-quantitative Western blotting were used to calculate
the specific activity of expressed DNase I.
