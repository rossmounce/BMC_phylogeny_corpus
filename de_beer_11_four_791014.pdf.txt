Four plant defensins from an indigenous South
African Brassicaceae species display divergent
activities against two test pathogens despite high
sequence similarity in the encoding genes
Abré de Beer and Melané A Vivier*

Abstract
Background: Plant defensins are an important component of the innate defence system of plants where they
form protective antimicrobial barriers between tissue types of plant organs as well as around seeds. These peptides
also have other activities that are important for agricultural applications as well as the medical sector. Amongst the
numerous plant peptides isolated from a variety of plant species, a significant number of promising defensins have
been isolated from Brassicaceae species. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of four defensins
from Heliophila coronopifolia, a native South African Brassicaceae species.
Results: Four defensin genes (Hc-AFP1-4) were isolated with a homology based PCR strategy. Analysis of the
deduced amino acid sequences showed that the peptides were 72% similar and grouped closest to defensins
isolated from other Brassicaceae species. The Hc-AFP1 and 3 peptides shared high homology (94%) and formed a
unique grouping in the Brassicaceae defensins, whereas Hc-AFP2 and 4 formed a second homology grouping with
defensins from Arabidopsis and Raphanus. Homology modelling showed that the few amino acids that differed
between the four peptides had an effect on the surface properties of the defensins, specifically in the alpha-helix
and the loop connecting the second and third beta-strands. These areas are implicated in determining differential
activities of defensins. Comparing the activities after recombinant production of the peptides, Hc-AFP2 and 4 had
IC50 values of 5-20 μg ml-1 against two test pathogens, whereas Hc-AFP1 and 3 were less active. The activity
against Botrytis cinerea was associated with membrane permeabilization, hyper-branching, biomass reduction and
even lytic activity. In contrast, only Hc-AFP2 and 4 caused membrane permeabilization and severe hyper-branching
against the wilting pathogen Fusarium solani, while Hc-AFP1 and 3 had a mild morphogenetic effect on the
fungus, without any indication of membrane activity. The peptides have a tissue-specific expression pattern since
differential gene expression was observed in the native host. Hc-AFP1 and 3 expressed in mature leaves, stems and
flowers, whereas Hc-AFP2 and 4 exclusively expressed in seedpods and seeds.
Conclusions: Two novel Brassicaceae defensin sequences were isolated amongst a group of four defensin
encoding genes from the indigenous South African plant H. coronopifolia. All four peptides were active against two
test pathogens, but displayed differential activities and modes of action. The expression patterns of the peptide
encoding genes suggest a role in protecting either vegetative or reproductive structures in the native host against
pathogen attack, or roles in unknown developmental and physiological processes in these tissues, as was shown
with other defensins.

Background
Plants have developed complex defence systems to protect them against a multitude of plant pathogens [1-8].
These defence systems consists of an array of both chemical and biochemical substances that protect the plant
against colonization and subsequent spread of disease
and can broadly be divided into the innate and active
defence responses [7,9-13]. The innate defence
responses play an important role in establishing preformed barriers of defence to prevent colonization by
pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an
important component of the innate defence response.
They are small, mostly basic peptides that range in size
from 2-9 kDa and have been classified into nine groups.
Plant defensins [10,14-21], thionins [22-27] and lipid
transfer proteins [28-34] are the best characterized of
these nine groups.
Plant defensins are small, basic, heat stable peptides
with a conserved tertiary structure that consists of a single a-helix and three anti-parallel b-strands [17,35-37].
The defensin tertiary structure is internally stabilized by
disulphide bridges linking the a-helix to two of the bstrands to form a structure know as the cysteine stabilizing motif, a conserved motif identified in AMPs isolated from various prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes
[38-41]. In addition to the cysteine stabilizing motif two
additional conserved motives have been identified in the
plant defensin structure, namely the a-core, encompassing the loop connecting the first b-strand and a-helix
and the g-core containing the all important hairpin loop
connecting b-strand 2 and 3 (Lb2b3). Notwithstanding
this conserved tertiary structure, plant defensins share
very little homology at amino acid level. It is however
this variability in primary amino acid sequence that contributes to the different biological functions that have
been attributed to these peptides, where a single amino
acid can change the spectrum of activity exhibited by
closely related defensin peptides.
The role of plant defensins in the preformed defence
of plants is well documented. They play an important
role in the protection of germinating plant seeds, developing seedlings and reproductive structures of plants
[42-44] and have been isolated from roots [44-46], vegetative tissues and reproductive structures such as flowers
and fruits [45,47-55]. The majority of characterized
plant defensins show a constitutive pattern of expression, with an induction in expression in response to
pathogen attack, wounding and some abiotic stresses
[20,44-46]. Recently it was shown that pathogen-induced
expression of Arabidopsis plant defensins is dependent
on ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (EDR1),
which interferes with the repressor function of MYC2
allowing for defensin gene expression [56]. Some

defensins, however, show a strict tissue-specific and
developmentally regulated pattern of expression
[47,50,54,57,58] which in some cases were linked to specific biological functions other than plant defence, as
was demonstrated for the defensins from tomato and
maize that play a role during pollination [50,57].
Plant defensins are best known for their antimicrobial
activity against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens that
include bacteria [59,60], yeast [61-64], oomycetes [65,66]
and necrotrophic pathogens [47,61,64,65,67-71]. In addition to these strong antimicrobial activities that established them as important agricultural biotechnology
targets, some members also show activities important for
medical applications, including protease inhibitory activity [23,72], anti cancer activity [61,73] and HIV inhibition
[61,74-76]. Other agriculturally important activities
include insecticidal activity [35,36,77,78], activity against
parasitic plants [79] and heavy metal tolerance [80].
The isolation and characterization of a wide range of
defensin peptides are crucial for the continued development of economically and medically important products.
Analysis of the sequenced plant genomes revealed that
defensins are present as multigene families and are overrepresented in the genomes of some plants species
[46,81]. With the wealth of defensin nucleotide sequences
available, strategies of gene isolation coupled with recombinant production are increasingly been used for the
characterization of closely related plant defensin peptides.
This work describes the successful isolation of four
plant defensin genes from the South African Brassicaceae
species Heliophila coronopifolia. An isolation strategy
based on the sequence homology that exists within the
nucleotides encoding the signal peptides of defensins
from domesticated Brassicaceae species was used to isolate four defensin sequences, of which two were shown
to be novel for Brassicaceae defensins. Each of the defensin peptide was successfully purified through recombinant production in Escherichia coli and characterized for
their activity and mode of action against two test pathogens. These results as well as expression analysis in the
host showed that the four peptides have differential
expression patterns in vegetative and reproductive
organs, as well as differential activities and modes of inhibition under the conditions tested. In addition, the divergence in structural motifs and surface properties
observed for these peptides provide interest to study
structure-activity determinants in these peptides.

Results
Isolation and in silico characterization of the Hc-AFP
encoding sequences

PCR-based isolation of cDNA from H. coronopifolia tissues allowed for the isolation of four putative defensin

de Beer and Vivier BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:459

sequences ranging between 426 bp and 468 bp, containing open reading frames of 240 and 243 bp, respectively.
TBLASTN analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed
homology to sequences encoding for the super family of
plant antifungal peptides known as plant defensins. The
isolated gene sequences were thus termed H. coronopifolia antifungal peptide 1 to 4 (Hc-AFP 1 - 4) (Figure 1).
Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed
that Hc-AFP1 and 3 encode for 80 amino acid peptides,
whereas Hc-AFP2 and 4 encode for 81 amino acid peptides (Figure 1). SignalP results showed that the first 30
amino acids of each peptide encode for a signal peptide
followed by a 50 amino acid mature peptide for HcAFP1 and 3 and a 51 amino acid mature peptide for
Hc-AFP2 and 4 (Table 1). The peptide parameters
obtained from the Expasy-Compute pI/Mw tool (Table
1) showed that the peptides had predicted mono-isotopic masses ranging between 5.48 and 5.73 kDa and are
highly basic with isoelectric points above 8.2.
Alignment analysis of the deduced amino acid
sequences revealed that the newly isolated H. coronopifolia defensins shared the highest homology with defensins isolated from other members of the Brassicaceae
family (Figure 2). Disulphide-bridge analyses conducted
on the Hc-AFP peptides revealed that they share a disulphide bridge pattern common to all plant defensins (Figure 3). Further comparison of Hc-AFPs with members
of the Brassicaceae defensins (Figures 2 and 3) revealed
that Hc-AFP1 shared the closest homology to Hc-AFP3
at 94% similarity and Rs-AFP3 from Raphanus sativa at
82% similarity, whereas Hc-AFP2 showed the greatest
homology to the defensins isolated from Sinapsis alba
and R. sativa (Rs-AFP2) at 98% similarity (Figures 2 and
3). Hc-AFP4 was more closely related to PDF1.1 from
A. halleri, a defensin proposed to play a role in the zinc
tolerance of A. halleri.
Analysis of homology models obtained for the different Hc-AFPs in combination with the alignment analysis
of the Hc-AFPs showed that most of the amino acid differences occurred in the a-helical regions of the peptides. By plotting the amino acid differences between
the closely related Hc-AFP1 and 3 (94% similarity)
where Ser17, Gly18 and Asn22 in Hc-AFP1 is replaced
by Tyr17, Asp18 and Ser22 in Hc-AFP3 onto their
respective models, it was observed that the change from
a polar Gly18 to an acidic Aspartic18 residue in HcAFP3 resulted in a less polar a-helical region (Figure 4A
and 4B). Root mean square deviation (RMSD) comparison between the structures of Hc-AFP1 and 3 revealed
that these differences, although occurring in the a-helical region, caused a greater RMSD deviation in the Nand C-terminal ends of the peptide structure (Figure
4C). Comparative analysis of the amino acids sequences
of Hc-AFP2 and 4 showed that they also share 94%

Page 3 of 19

similarity, with Asn19 and 27 (numbering according to
Hc-AFP2) replaced with Gly19 and Arg27 and Lys30
replaced with Arg30 in Hc-AFP4 (Figure 4D and 4E).
Comparative analysis of the structural models of HcAFP2 and 4 revealed that these amino acid changes had
very little effect on the overall structure of these peptides and only had a RMSD difference of 0.26 Å in the
a-helical region of the peptides (Figure 4F), leading to
an extended a-helix in Hc-AFP2 when compared to HcAFP4 (Figure 4D and 4E). These amino acid substitutions did however result in a difference of the predicted
surface properties between the Hc-AFP2 and 4 peptides.
Hc-AFP4 is more basic and less hydrophilic in nature,
whereas Hc-AFP2 is more polar in the regions surrounding the a-helix (Figure 4D and 4E).
The amino acids encoding for the a-helical region of
Hc-AFP1 and 3 are unique when compared to defensins
isolated from the other Brassicaceae species. Structural
alignment of the backbones of the Hc-AFP1 - 4 models
revealed that these unique amino acids present in the ahelical region of Hc-AFP1 and 3 (designated Group 1)
resulted in a difference in tertiary structure when compared to Hc-AFP2 and 4 (designated Group 2) (Figure
4G). The a-helical regions of Group1 vs Group 2 had a
RMSD value of more than 1.7 Å, and importantly, a significant difference of more than 1.6 Å was also observed
in the Lb2b3 loop, which is encoded by amino acids 38
to 41 (numbering according to Hc-AFP2) (Figure 4H).
Expression analysis of the Hc-AFP encoding genes

Quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) analysis conducted on
the Heliophila defensin encoding genes revealed that the
reproductive and storage organs of the H. coronopifolia
plant, which include the flowers, siliques and seeds, contributed to 91% of the observed defensin transcript present (Figure 5A). When considering the expression
patterns of the individual peptides encoding genes, HcAFP1 and 3 showed expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues tested (leaves, stems, flowers), as well as
very low levels of expression in storage tissues (siliques
and seeds) (Figure 5B). The distribution of these transcripts within the tissue types differed however, with
Hc-AFP1 being the dominant transcript in stem and
flower tissue contributing 66% and 73% respectively of
the total defensin transcript present in these tissues. HcAFP3 was the dominant transcript in the leaf tissue contributing 73% of the observed defensin transcript present. In contrast Hc-AFP2 and 4 were the dominant
transcripts present in the storage organs of H. coronopifolia and not expressed in leaves, stems or flowers (Figure 5B). Hc-AFP2 was the dominant transcript in green
siliques contributing 79% of the total defensin transcript
present, but only contributed 19% of the total defensin
transcript observed in mature seeds. Hc-AFP4 was

predominantly expressed in seeds and to a much lesser
extent in green siliques (Figure 5B).
Bacterial production and purification of Hc-AFPs

The CBD-intein Hc-AFP fusions was successfully produced in E. coli strain BL21DE3 Rosetta gami pLysS and
was visible as a 30 kDa band on a SDS PAGE gel (result
not shown). The recombinant fusion proteins were successfully purified on a chitin bead column. On-column
cleavage and peptide elution was confirmed with TrisTricine SDS PAGE analysis (Figure 6). The peptides
were correctly folded, displaying the expected trimeric
forms (15 kDa bands on the Tris-Tricine gel in Figure
6) of the defensin peptides.
Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified Hc-AFPs
revealed molecular masses (in Dalton) of 5471.25 for
Hc-AFP1, 5710.3 for Hc-AFP2, 5516.0 for Hc-AFP3 and
5724.4 for Hc-AFP4 respectively, which correlates with
their predicted mono-isotopic masses calculated with
the Expasy-Compute pI/Mw tool (Table 1) (-8 Da
because of oxidized cysteines). This confirmed that the
purified defensins were derived from their respective
genes in the bacterial expression vectors and indicated
that the crucially important four disulphide bridges
common to all plant defensins peptides formed.
Antifungal activity of the recombinant Hc-AFP peptides

The four plant defensin peptides from H. coronopifolia
showed variable levels of activity against B. cinerea and
F. solani in liquid plate assays (Table 2 and Additional
File 1 and 2).
Hc-AFP2 was the most active of all the peptides tested
against B. cinerea with IC50 values ranging between 1015 μg ml-1 and a similar IC50 against F. solani. Hc-AFP4
inhibited B. cinerea with an IC50 value between 15-20
μg ml-1, and strongly inhibited F. solani, having an IC50
value ranging between 5-10 μg ml-1 (Table 2 and Additional File 2).
Microscopical analysis conducted on B. cinerea hyphae
treated with the four defensin peptides revealed that all
the defensins induced changes in Botrytis hyphal morphology under the conditions tested. Compared to the
untreated control, hyper-branching, fungal tip swelling,
increased granulation of hyphae and spores, as well as
hyphal and spore disruption could be observed in the
cultures treated with the peptides (Table 2 Figure 7 and

Additional File 3). In addition, Hc-AFP2 and 3 had a
severe effect on spore and hyphae integrity, resulting in
disintegration of the hyphae and spores, which could be
observed as leakage of the spore and hyphal cytoplasmic
content into the surrounding environment. Moreover,
assessment of propidium iodide assays revealed that the
antifungal activity of all four Heliophila defensins
against B. cinerea were associated with an increase in
membrane permeabilization (Figure 7 and Additional
File 3).
The peptides showed differential activity against F.
solani (Table 2 Figure 8 and Additional File 4). HcAFP2 and 4 caused severe hyper-branching, as well as
membrane permeabilization, whereas Hc-AFP1 and 3
caused mild hyper-branching and no membrane disruption against the wilting pathogen. Also, unlike the
results on Botrytis, no lysis was observed in F. solani
spores and hyphae when treated with the four plant
defensins (Figure 8 and Additional File 4).

Discussion
Plant defensins isolated from Brassicaceae species have
especially shown great promise in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and therapeutic drug design. Several
of these peptides have been overexpressed in crop species leading to disease resistant traits. The overexpression of BrD1, wasabi defensin and Rs-AFP2 have led to
the engineering of disease resistant rice species
[66,68,70,77], while the overexpression of AlfAFP1
yielded disease resistant potatoes at field trail level
[65,82]. The overexpression of wasabi defensin in tomatoes also showed resistance towards necrotrophic pathogens [83]. Brassicaceae defensins are also used to
evaluate the potential of defensin peptides in the design
of new therapeutic drugs against human pathogenic
yeast and fungi [62,63,84]. Moreover, since these defensins are well studied, they have been used as models to
study the mechanisms of action of plant defensins
against their target organisms [16,17,24,85-87]. Of the
449 defensin peptides listed in the protein database at
the NCBI, 379 peptides belong to the Brassicaceae
family.
Alignment analysis of the Brassicaceae defensin genes
in the NCBI database revealed a high level of similarity

homology, a PCR-based isolation strategy was used to
amplify putative defensins from pools of cDNA made
from the various tissue types of H. coronopifolia, a
native South African Brassicaceae species currently
unexplored for novel antimicrobial peptides. Four plant
defensin peptide encoding genes, termed Hc-AFP1 to 4
(Figure 1) were obtained and analysis of the deduced
amino acid sequences revealed that the newly isolated
peptide encoding genes shared the common structural
design of other Brassicaceae defensins. Alignment analysis of the mature region showed that the Hc-AFP peptides shared 72% similarity at deduced amino acid level
(Figure 3), and were more closely related to the defensins isolated from Brassicaceae species than from other
plant species (Figure 2). Hc-AFP1 and 3 grouped closely
together and displays amino acid sequences in the ahelix area unique to peptides in the Brassicaceae family.

The homology models of the Hc-AFP peptides (Figure
4) revealed important differences between the different
Hc-AFPs. Most of the amino acid differences occurred
in the a-helical region, forming two structurally defined
groups, with Hc-AFP1 and 3 in the first group and HcAFP2 and 4 in the second group. Despite the amino
acid differences occurring in the a-helical region a large
deviation were observed (1.7 Å) in the Lb2b3 loop when
the structures were superimposed (Figure 5G). Hc-AFP2
and 4 shares high homology to Rs-AFP2 and the Lb2b3
loop of Rs-AFP2 have been well studied over the past
years and have been linked to the antifungal activity of
this peptide [16,86,87]. It was shown that the sequence
ARHGSCNYVFPAHKCICYF is important for antifungal
activity, especially the basic Arg32 residue and Tyr48
(numbering according to Rs-AFP2) [86]. This sequence
is also present in the Hc-AFPs, but in Hc-AFP1 and 3

the important Arg32 is replaced by Ala, resulting in a
less basic loop for Hc-AFP1 and 3 (charge at pH 7:
+1.176) compared to Hc-AFP2 and 4 (charge at pH 7:
+2.176). Recently it was shown that the overall charge
of the Lb2b3 loop (also termed the g-core) is a determinant for the differential activities observed between closely related plant defensin peptides and might explain
the differential antifungal activity observed between the
Hc-AFP defensins [88]. The Lb2 b3 loop has also been
connected with other biological activities associated with
plant defensins, including anti insecticidal activity and
enzyme inhibition [36,78]. The Lb 2 b 3 loop is not the
only area of the peptide structure that plays a role in
antifungal activity and recently a role for the loop connecting the a-helix and first b-strand have been proposed for the interaction of plant defensins with their
fungal target [89,90], an area where the Hc-AFPs show
high sequence divergence and a deviation of 1.6 Å when
the structures are superimposed (Figure 5G and 5H).

Expression profiling of the Hc-AFP genes

The differential and tissue-specific expression pattern of
the Heliophila defensins proposes different roles for the
four defensins. The expression of Hc-AFP1 and 3 in the
vegetative and floral tissues propose a role in the protection against fungal infection of these tissues. The significant contribution of Hc-AFP1 to the total pool of
defensin transcripts present in the H. coronopifolia flowers might suggest a key role for Hc-AFP1 in the protection of the reproductive structure against pathogens.
The very lytic activity of the peptides against Botrytis
spores and hyphae might support this notion, since this
necrotrophic pathogen typically attack vegetative and
floral structures. Similarly, the strong activity against the
wilting pathogen of the Hc-AFP2 and 4 peptides and
their exclusive expression in the storage organs of the
plant suggests that these peptides could be instrumental
in protecting the germinating seeds against soil-borne
pathogens such as F. solani. Moreover, the expression of
the majority of Heliophila defensin transcript in the
reproductive and storage organs is not unexpected,
since the majority of isolated and characterized plant
defensin peptides have been isolated from these organs
[42,47-51,64,73,91-94], highlighting the importance of
plant defensins in the protection of the reproductive systems of plants. This is especially well documented for
the radish defensins Rs-AFP1 and 2, to which the Heliophila defensins share high homology. It has been shown
that the radish defensins form preformed barriers within
these tissues to stop the initiation or spread of fungal
infection [42]. The tissue-specific expression of Hc-AFP2
and 4 also propose a role in the protection of seeds
against fungal attack as well as a possible role in protection during seed germination as has been observed for
the radish defensins Rs-AFP1 and 2, which share 94%
and 98% similarity to Hc-AFP2 and 4, respectively.
The differential expression pattern might, however,
also indicate that the various peptides could play roles
in the developmental and/or physiological processes of
these organs and tissues, as was observed for some

defensins isolated from maize and tomato [50,57]. These
aspects need to be further evaluated with in vivo
analysis.
Recombinant production and purification

The high level of codon bias and the inability of E. coli
to form disulphide bridges, solubility issues and affinity
tag removal have made the production of plant defensins in bacteria notoriously difficult. By utilizing a
codon-optimized E. coli strain with the ability to form
disulphide bridges, we were able to successfully produce
all four peptides in a soluble state.
The expression and purification strategy resulted in
the purification (to homogeneity) of each peptide in a
single chromatographic step. Disulphide bridge formation could also be confirmed by LC-MS analysis.
Antifungal activity of the Hc-AFP peptides

Plant defensin peptides can be divided into three groups
based on their antifungal activity. The first group known
as morphogenic defensins are highly active against fungal pathogens and induce morphological changes in
treated hyphae which results in severe hyper-branching
of the fungal hyphae [14,21,71,95]. Most plant defensins
isolated from Brassicaceae species belong to this group.
The second group inhibits fungal pathogens, but do not
induce morphological changes and are known as nonmorphogenic defensins, with the third group not exhibiting any antifungal activity.
The peptides from H. coronopifolia were classified as
morphogenic defensins since they had severe effects on
hyphal development and morphology under the conditions tested. Recombinant Hc-AFP1 to 4 showed strong
antifungal activity, also confirming the correct folding of
the peptides during bacterial production. The peptides
were tested against two agronomically important pathogens namely B. cinerea, the most destructive necrotrophic pathogen with a wide host range and the wilting
disease agent F. solani. With the exception of Hc-AFP1,
the Hc-AFPs showed strong activity against B. cinerea

with IC50 values below 25 μg ml-1. All three peptides,
with the exception of Hc-AFP1, induced a severe hyperbranching effect in treated hyphae, a common characteristic of defensins isolated from Brassicaceae species. The
activity exerted by the Hc-AFPs against B. cinerea was

also linked to membrane permeabilization, similar to
what was observed for Rs-AFP2, a defensin from radish
against fungal pathogens [96]. Hc-AFP2 and 3 had a
severe effect on the integrity of Botrytis hyphae and
spores, resulting in the disintegration of the fungal

de Beer and Vivier BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:459
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/459

membrane and leakage of the cytoplasmic content into
the surrounding environment. This lytic activity has not
previously been described for Brassicaceae defensins
according to our knowledge. The differential activity
against F. solani, where Hc-AFP1 and 3 show reduced
activity compared to Hc-AFP2 and 4, correlates well
with their expression patterns. F. solani is a soil pathogen and Hc-AFP2 and 4, which show expression only in
the storage organs, shows strong activity against this
pathogen, strengthening the proposed role for these
peptides during seed germination and seedling protection against soil borne pathogens. The expression of
Hc-AFP1 and 3 in the vegetative tissues might also
explain why they show more activity against pathogens
evolved to infect vegetative tissues like the necrotrophic
pathogen B. cinerea.
The effects on Botrytis (positive membrane disruption,
severe morphological effects and even lytic activity) suggest that the activities could be orchestrated with the
membrane being the primary target. However, recent
evidence suggests that the cell wall also might play a
role in membrane permeabilization [67] and that the
membrane might actually be the secondary target. Interestingly, the Fusarium data indicated that Hc-AFP1 and
3 did not affect the membranes of the pathogen, since
no membrane permeabilization was observed. These
divergent activities of the Heliophilia peptides should be
studied further. Future work will focus on exploring the
structure-function relationships in the four peptides,
and the implications on activity, specifically since these
four peptides are highly homologous on amino acid
sequence level, but display a few pointed changes in certain important defensin motifs which might be underpinning the observed variation in activities and mode-of
action.

Conclusions
The homology that resides within the signal peptides of
plant defensins belonging to the same plant family is
significant and allowed us to successfully implement a
PCR-based method to isolate four Brassicaceae defensins. This strategy might be useful to isolate new defensin sequences from unsequenced plants species
belonging to the same plant family. Despite the high
level of homology on sequence level that was observed
for the peptides, they were predicted to differ in their
structural and surface properties, aspects that are known
to influence activity levels and range. These aspects, as
well as their observed divergent expression patterns,
activities and modes of action against two test pathogens, provide interest to explore the structure-activity
relationship of these peptides further.

Methods
Microbial strains and plant material

Escherichia coli strain DH5a were used for all cloning
experiments, while E. coli strain BL21 Rosetta-gami
pLysS DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) were used for
recombinant protein production. Fusarium solani and
Botrytis cinerea cultures were obtained from the Department of Plant Pathology (DPP), Stellenbosch University
and maintained on potato dextrose agar at 25°C until
sporulation. Spores were harvested in dH2O and spore
concentrations determined using a haemocytometer.
Heliophila coronopifolia seeds were obtained from Silverhill seed company, South Africa. H. coronopifolia
plants were established in potting soil from seeds and
maintained under green-house conditions at 25°C.
Design of Primer SPDEF-5’

The design of primer SPDEF-5 is based on the high
level of homology that exists within the nucleotide
sequences encoding for the signal peptides of plant
defensin peptides belonging to the plant family Brassicaceae. Plant defensin encoding sequences isolated from
Brassicaceae species was identified in the Genbank database of the National Centre for Biotechnological information (NCBI). The first 50 nucleotides encoding for
the N-terminal signal peptide of the Brassicaceae plant
defensin peptides were selected and aligned in AlignX
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) (Additional File 5). 72%
similarity existed over the first 50 amino acids. The consensus sequence were identified and the first 20 nucleotides were used to design primer SPDEF-5’ (5’ATGGCTAAGTTTGCTTCCATCAT-3’).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was isolated from stem, leaf, flower, green
siliques and mature seeds of H. coronopifolia. The tissue
was ground to a fine powder in the presence of liquid
nitrogen and total RNA was extracted from 200 mg
powdered tissue according to Chang et al [97]. Total
RNA was precipitated with 3 M LiCl and washed with
70% (v/v) ethanol and dissolved in 26 μl RNase free
water. The samples were treated with DNaseI (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) to remove
genomic DNA contamination in a 30 μl reaction. Sample volumes was adjusted to 200 μl with RNase free
water and the DNaseI removed by extracting with an
equal volume phenol/chloroform (50:50 v/v), followed
by an equal volume chloroform to remove the phenol.
The RNA was precipitated with a 1/10 volume 3 M
NaOAc and 0.7 volumes isopropanol, washed with 70%
(v/v) ethanol and dissolved in RNase free water. First
strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA

de Beer and Vivier BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:459
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/459

using an anchored oligo dT23 primer (Sigma, St Louis,
USA) and Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).
cDNA synthesis was performed as described by the
manufacturer.
Gene isolation and cloning

The coding regions of potential plant defensin
sequences were PCR amplified from total stem, leaf,
flower, silique and seed cDNA using primer set SPDEF5’ and the anchored oligo dT23 primer (Sigma, St Louis,
USA) used for cDNA synthesis. The PCR reaction was
performed in a 50 μl reaction containing: 1× Expand
buffer with 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 200 nM
SPDEF-5’ primer, 200 nM oligo dT 23, 10 ng template
DNA and 1 U Expand high fidelity polymerase (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The PCR
program was as follows: 95°C for 5 min; followed by 30
cycles of 95°C for 45 sec, 48°C for 30 sec and 72°C for
45 sec. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy
vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) and positive clones were identified through restriction digest
with EcoRI. Plasmids containing inserts were confirmed
by sequencing. Obtained sequences were analyzed with
the BLASTN algorithm http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi at the NCBI and clones containing open reading frames encoding for plant defensins were identified
and termed pGEM-Hc1-4. The sequences were deposited to Genbank with the following accession numbers:
JN203136 (Hc-AFP1), JN203137 (Hc-AFP2), JN203138
(Hc-AFP3) and JN203139 (Hc-AFP4).
Bioinformatical analysis of the four H. coronopifolia
defensin sequences

The deduced amino acid sequences of Hc-AFP1-4 was
created in BioEdit [98] and analyzed with the ExpasyCompute pI/Mw tool http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/
to obtain the different peptide parameters and Biochemistry online http://vitalonic.narod.ru/biochem to determine the overall charge of the peptides and their Lb2b3loops. The peptide structure of each peptide was evaluated for the presence of a signal peptide sequence with
SignalP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and the
possible disulphide bridge pattern for each peptide was
determined using the web services DIpro http://download.igb.uci.edu/bridge.html.
The deduced amino acid sequences encoding for the
mature plant defensin peptides were aligned against a
diverse set of mature plant defensin sequences isolated
from various plant genera. All sequences were obtained
from the NCBI and alignment with the newly isolated
defensins was performed in ClustalX [99]. A graphical
representation of the phylogenetic tree was created in
Arbodraw [100].

Page 14 of 19

Homology models for each Hc-AFP peptide was created with the Bioinformatics toolkit at the Max Planck
Institute for developmental biology http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/. The crystal structure of Rs-AFP1 (Protein
Data Bank: 1AYJ) from radish was used as template.
The models obtained were refined and analyzed with
YASARA structure [101,102] and the FoldX plugin
[103]. Models were visualized in Visual Molecular
Dynamics ver 1.8.4 and the final images rendered with
POV-Ray.
q-RT-PCR analysis of the Hc-AFP encoding genes

Analysis was conducted on each of the newly isolated
genes using the primer sets listed in Table 3. Each primer set was optimized to determine the optimal ratio of
the forward and reverse primer in the primer set. The
PCR efficiency was determined by setting up a standard
curve prepared from the cDNA used to isolate the
respective genes. The standard curve consisted of a 1/4
to 1/1024 dilution of the respective cDNA template. qRT-PCR reactions with different ratios of forward and
reverse primers were performed with the KAPA SYBR
FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, South Africa) in a 20
μl reaction. All q-RT-PCR analysis were performed on a
ABI7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
South Africa) with the following program: 95°C for 5
min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C, 15 sec; 60°C, 32 sec.
The 40 cycles was followed by a dissociation curve consisting of a ramp from 95°C to 60°C. The Ct values
obtained were used as input data in the REST2009 software package [104] to calculate the PCR efficiency of
each primer set. The optimized q-RT-PCR primer ratios
were used to evaluate the expression of Hc-AFP1-4 in
the different H. coronopifolia tissue types. The q-RTPCR reactions were done as described above with each
reaction containing the optimized primer concentration
listed in Table 3. The data obtained were analyzed in
LinRegPCR v11.0 software package [105] to determine
the transcript levels for each gene present at the time of
cDNA synthesis in the various tissue types. Elongation
factor alpha (EFa) was used to standardize the expression levels obtained between the different tissues. The
data for the individual genes are expressed as a percentage of the total defensin transcript present in the tissue.
Recombinant production of Hc-AFPs in E. coli

Hc-AFPs were produced in E. coli by using the
IMPACT system (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA). The DNA regions encoding for mature Hc-AFPs
was cloned into the pTWIN1 vector, which allows for
expression under control of the IPTG inducible T7 promoter. The cloning strategy allowed for a fusion
between the Hc-AFPs and a chitin binding domain

(CBD) to facilitate downstream purification using affinity chromatography. In the pTWIN system the HcAFPs and the CBD are separated by an intein peptide
sequence that under goes self cleavage upon induction
by pH and temperature shift.
The mature coding sequence of Hc-AFP1 to 4 was
PCR amplified from pGEM-Hc1 to 4 using the primer
sets listed in Additional File 6.
PCR reactions were performed in a 50 μl reaction
volume containing: 1x Expand buffer with 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 200 nm Forward and Reverse
primer, 1 ng template DNA and 1 U Expand high fidelity polymerase. The mature coding regions were PCR
amplified using the following program, 95°C for 5 min;
followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 sec, 55°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 45 sec. PCR products were cloned into
pGEM-T easy and positive clones were identified
through digestion with EcoRI. Positive clones were
termed pGEM-Hc1-Impact, pGEM-Hc2-Impact, pGEMHc3-Impact and pGEM-Hc4-Impact.
The mature coding regions were excised from their
respective pGEM-Hc-Impact vectors with SapI and PstI
and ligated into pTWIN1 vector prepared with SapI and
PstI. Positive clones were identified by restriction digest
and termed pTWIN-Hc1 to 4. All positive clones were
sequenced with the SsPDnaB intein sequencing primer
(5’-ACTGGGACTCCATCGTTTCT-3’) to confirm the
in-frame fusion between the CBD and the Hc-AFPs.
Recombinant production of the Hc-AFPs was performed in E. coli strain BL21DE3 Rosetta gami pLysS,
which contains a plasmid encoding for 6 rare codons
present in E. coli. pTWIN-Hc1 to 4 was transformed
into the BL21 strain using a heat shock method and
positive transformants were identified by plating onto
LB agar plates containing 34 μg ml-1 chloramphinicol,
12.5 μg ml-1 tetracycline, 15 μg ml-1 kanamycin and 100
μg ml-1 ampicillin. Ten colonies of each construct were
inoculated into a 5 ml preculture of LB broth containing
the above mentioned antibiotics and incubated over
night at 37°C. Four 2 L erlenmeyer flasks containing 400
ml LB broth plus antibiotics were inoculated with 1 ml

preculture and incubated at 37°C with continuous shaking at 175 rpm. When the OD600 reached 0.7, the cultures were cooled to room temperature (22°C) and
recombinant production of Hc-AFPs was induced with
0.4 mM IPTG (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Recombinant production of Hc-AFPs was
allowed to proceed for 6 hours at room temperature
with continuous shaking at 175 rpm.
Purification of Recombinant Hc-AFP defensins

Cells were collected from induced cultures by centrifugation. The cell pellet were resuspended in 40 ml cold
column binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 M
NaCl) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl and 0.2 mM
PMSF (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The cells were broken open by several cycles of
freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen and a 25°C water bath.
The viscosity of the crude lysate was reduced by adding
50 units of DNaseI enzyme and incubation for 20 min
at room temperature. The lysate was cleared of particulate matter by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm, at 4°C for
30 min.
Recombinant Hc-AFPs were purified using affinity
chromatography. The cleared lysate was passed over a
100 x10 mm chitin bead column (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA, USA) equilibrated with column binding
buffer at 4°C. The column was loaded using gravity flow
and a reduced flow rate of 500 μl min-1 . The column
was washed with 200 ml of binding buffer at a flow rate
of 3 ml min-1, followed by a quick flush of 20 ml cleavage buffer (200 mM NH 4OAc pH 6.0). After the column was flushed with cleavage buffer, self cleavage of
the intein peptide was induced by temperature shift to
30°C for 48 hours.
Cleaved peptide was eluted with 50 ml of cleavage
buffer and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried peptide was
subjected to a further two rounds of dissolving in 100
ml MilliQ water and freeze drying to remove most of
the volatile ammonium salt. The peptide was finally dissolved in 2 ml MilliQ water followed by heat treatment
at 80°C for 15 min to denature contaminant proteins.

de Beer and Vivier BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:459

The sample was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min
and desalted on an Isolute C8 (EC) column (Biotage AB,
Switzerland). The desalted peptide was eluted with 50%
(v/v) acetonitrile and freeze-dried. Purified Hc-AFPs was
dissolved in MilliQ water at a final concentration of 1
mg ml-1.
Analysis and identification of recombinant Hc-AFP
defensins

The purity of eluted Hc-AFPs was evaluated by separating 0.5 μg peptide on a 15% [w/v] Tris-Tricine gel [106];
after separation the peptide bands were visualized by silver staining.
Purified Hc-AFPs were subjected to LC-MS analysis to
confirm that the plant defensins purified originated from
their respective gene constructs. 10 μl purified Hc-AFP
peptide was injected on a Waters Alliance 2690 Gradient UPLC and separated on a Waters UPLC BEH C18
column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) (Waters Corporation
Milford MA, USA). The column was eluted with the
program listed in Additional File 7. The eluted peak was
submitted to MS analysis on a Waters API Q-TOF
Ultima with the following settings: Source, ESI+; Capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; Cone voltage, 35; RF1, 40; Source,
100°C; Desolvation Temp, 350°C; Desolvation gas, 400 L
h -1 and Cone gas: 50 L h -1 . The m/z ratios obtained
were used to calculate the mono-isotopic mass of each
peptide with all cysteine residues in an oxidized state.
The mass obtained for each peptide was compared to
the predicted mono-isotopic mass for each peptide generated with the Expasy-Compute pI/Mw tool (Table 1).
Antifungal activity of Hc-AFPs

Quantitative antifungal activity of the Hc-AFPs was
assessed using a microspectrophotometric assay [107].
The assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate
(Bibby Sterilin Ltd, Stone, Staffs, UK), where each well
contained 1000 fungal spores in 100 μl half strength
Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and purified Hc-AFPs
concentrations ranging from 5-25 μg ml-1. Control reactions contained no peptide. Plates were incubated in the
dark at 23°C for 3 days, with microspectrophotometric
readings taken every 24 hours at A595. Hc-AFP defensin
activity was scored after 48 h and expressed in terms of
% growth inhibition as described previously [107].
Microscopical analysis was conducted on B. cinerea
grown in the presence of 25 μg ml-1 Hc-AFP1 and 3, 15
μg ml -1 Hc-AFP2 and 18 μg ml -1 Hc-AFP4. F. solani
was grown in the presence of 25 μg ml-1 Hc-AFP1 and
3 and 12 μg ml-1 Hc-AFP2 and 4. Microscopical assays
were conducted in 200 μl reactions containing 1000 fungal spores in half strength PDB. After 48 h of growth at
23°C, the samples were treated with Anexin V and

Apoptosis Kit (Clonetech, Takara Bio Inc, Japan) before
images were captured on an Olympus IX81 inverted
microscope and analyzed with the CellIR ® software
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH). Fluorescent
images were captured with an intensity of 78% and an
exposure time of 880 msec-1. Constant background subtraction, with a setting of 10, was performed on all captured images.
