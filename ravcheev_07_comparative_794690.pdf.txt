Abstract
Background: Gamma-proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli, can use a variety of respiratory
substrates employing numerous aerobic and anaerobic respiratory systems controlled by multiple
transcription regulators. Thus, in E. coli, global control of respiration is mediated by four
transcription factors, Fnr, ArcA, NarL and NarP. However, in other Gamma-proteobacteria the
composition of global respiration regulators may be different.
Results: In this study we applied a comparative genomic approach to the analysis of three global
regulatory systems, Fnr, ArcA and NarP. These systems were studied in available genomes
containing these three regulators, but lacking NarL. So, we considered several representatives of
Pasteurellaceae, Vibrionaceae and Yersinia spp. As a result, we identified new regulon members,
functioning in respiration, central metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate
pathway, citrate cicle, metabolism of pyruvate and lactate), metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty
acids, transcriptional regulation and transport, in particular: the ATP synthase operon
atpIBEFHAGCD, Na+-exporting NADH dehydrogenase operon nqrABCDEF, the D-amino acids
dehydrogenase operon dadAX. Using an extension of the comparative technique, we demonstrated
taxon-specific changes in regulatory interactions and predicted taxon-specific regulatory cascades.
Conclusion: A comparative genomic technique was applied to the analysis of global regulation of
respiration in ten gamma-proteobacterial genomes. Three structurally different but functionally
related regulatory systems were described. A correlation between the regulon size and the
position of a transcription factor in regulatory cascades was observed: regulators with larger
regulons tend to occupy top positions in the cascades. On the other hand, there is no obvious link
to differences in the species' lifestyles and metabolic capabilities.

Background
Escherichia coli, the best-studied representative of gammaproteobacteria, can adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions. One source of this capability is the
presence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic respiratory
systems. To adapt to different growth conditions, this bacterium alter the composition of their respiratory systems
by changing the repertoire of substrate-specific dehydrogenases and terminal oxidoreductases. The concentration
of each component is strictly regulated in order to optimize the respiratory chains according to the available substrates and the physiological needs of the cell.
In facultative anaerobe E. coli, regulation of respiration
depends on the availability of electron acceptors, which
are used in a specific order. Thus, molecular oxygen
represses all other types of respiration and fermentation.
Under anaerobiosis, nitrate, the most favorable electron
acceptor in such conditions, represses other types of
anaerobic respiration and fermentation. This control is
effected by a variety of regulatory systems [1,2].
The first level of regulation is implemented via the Fnr
protein. Fnr is an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor.
Oxygen is sensed by iron-sulfur clusters formed by the Nterminal domain. Under anaerobic conditions, Fnr forms
dimers that are capable of binding DNA, whereas in the
presence of oxygen these clusters are reversibly destroyed
and the dimers dissociate [3,4]. Thus, Fnr is active only
under anaerobic conditions, when it activates genes necessary for the anaerobic metabolism and represses genes
for the aerobic respiration [2,5]. In E. coli, Fnr is the top
regulator of respiration, as it controls the expression of
genes for other transcriptional factors [6,7].
Another transcription factor regulating respiration is the
ArcA protein. ArcA is a part of the ArcA-ArcB two-component system, where ArcB is an inner membrane sensor
protein. ArcB is belived to sense the redox state of ubiquinones: in vitro, the activity of this protein depends on the
redox status of a ubiquionone soluble analog [8,9]. In the
absence of corresponding electron acceptors, ArcB phosphorylates ArcA, enabling it to bind DNA [10,11]. Thus,
under the anaerobic conditions, ArcA regulates expression
of genes for respiration and central metabolism, and
probably controls the switch between the respiration and
fermentation metabolisms [5,12-14].
The next level of regulation is provided by two homologous transcription factors, NarL and NarP. These proteins
are activated in the presence of nitrate and nitrite by two
homologous sensor kinases NarX and NarQ. The duplicated two-component system allows for the fine tuning of
the nitrate and nitrite respiration system to a dynamic
ratio of two alternative substrates. NarX and NarQ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/54

respond differentially to nitrate and nitrite. Thus, in this
subsystem three levels of the response specificity may be
distinguished: (i) interaction between sensor proteins and
respiratory substrates, (ii) interaction between sensor proteins and transcription factors, and (iii) interaction
between factors and their binding sites in DNA [15-18].
Upon activation, NarL and NarP activate genes for the
nitrate and nitrate respiration and repress genes for other,
less effective, pathways of anaerobic respiration [19-22].
Nevertheless, in some gamma-proteobacteria, only the
single NarQ-NarP system was found [23], accompanied
by reduction of the nitrate and nitrite respiratory system,
and the presence of only the periplasmic respiratory system. So, in most gamma-proteobacteria the fine tuning of
the system is not required and a single NarQ-NarP system
is sufficient for the control of the nitrate and nitrite respiration [24].
Although the physiology and regulation of respiration in
E. coli has been studied in considerable depth, the regulation in other organisms is poorly understood. Moreover,
in other representatives of gamma-proteobacteria, for
example, in Haemophilus influenzae, regulation of respiration looks to be quite different from E. coli [25,26].
Previously, comparative genomic analyses were performed separately for Fnr [27], ArcA [28], and NarP [24]
in a small number of microorganisms. Here we report the
results of a comparative genomic analysis of the respiration regulation in multiple genomes belonging to several
representatives of the three families of gamma-proteobacteria. Although the NarL-DNA interactions have been
studied in experiment [29-32], the existing methods for
prediction of transcription factor binding sites do not
allow for the reliable identification of candidate NarL
sites. Because of that, we analyzed the organisms containing only the NarP regulator. In such organisms, we studied three structurally different, but functionally related
Fnr, ArcA and NarP systems.

Results
Structure of the Fnr, ArcA and NarP regulogs
The procedure described in "Methods" was applied to the
analysis of regulation by Fnr, ArcA and NarP. All genes
predicted to form regulogs (orthologous regulons) were
classified according to their functions.

In comparison with previous studies, where single regulatory systems had been studied in several gamma-protoeobacterial genomes [24,27,33], here we predicted
additional regulatory interactions. These predictions were
made possible by the use of total pairwise comparison
and detailed simultaneous analysis of multiple regulatory
systems. Here we consider in detail only the relevant pre-

dictions. A summary of these predictions is given in Table
1, whereas more detailed data about site prediction,
including information about operon structure changes,
are shown in additional files 1 and 2.
Respiration
One of the most significant results was the identification
of conserved candidate sites upstream of the atpIBEFHAGCD operon. This operon encodes all subunits of the
ATP synthetase complex, the key component of the oxidative phosphorylation [34]. Experimental data about regulation of the atp operon in E. coli are conflicting. In
particular, expression of the atp operon was claimed to be
independent of Fnr or ArcA [35]. On the other hand, 1.5to 8-fold increase of the expression level of various atp
genes in the fnr mutant E. coli, as compared to the wildtype strain, was shown using a microarray assay [36]. Similarly, 1.9- to 14-fold increase of the expression level of
various atp genes was shown in the arcA mutant strain
[37]. Recently, candidate Fnr and ArcA sites were observed
upstream of the atp operon in E. coli K-12 genome; these
sites were conserved in many Enterobacteriaceae genomes
[Tsiganova and Ravcheev, unpublished observation]. In
the present study, candidate ArcA sites were observed
upstream of the atp operon in both Yersinia spp., and Fnr
sites were detected in all Vibrionaceae. Thus, in at least
some gamma-proteobacteria, expression of the ATP synthetase genes is controlled by the global regulators of respiration.

Candidate regulatory sites were found upstream of the
nqrABCDEF operon encoding Na+-exporting NADH dehydrogenase [38]. Candidate Fnr-binding sites are conserved
in all studied genomes, whereas ArcA sites have been
found in all Vibrionaceae and Pasteurellaceae, but not in
the Yersinia spp. The regulation by NarP seems to be specific for the Pasteurellaceae. Orthologs for the nqr genes
were not found in E. coli, but such orthologs were detected
in Klebsiella pneumoniae and various Vibrionaceae and Pasteurellaceae [38-43]. On the other hand, E. coli has an H+exporting NADH dehydrogenase enzyme, encoded by the
nuo operon, whose expression is regulated by the NarL
and Fnr transcription factors [44,45]. No genes of the nuo
operon demonstrate homology with the nqr genes.
Orthologs of the nuo operon were found in the Yersinia
genomes, but they were not preceded by candidate Fnr,
ArcA or NarP binding sites. Thus, in the studied genomes,
non-homologous displacement with a partial change of
function leads to the sodium-dependent energetics used
in conjunction with the proton-dependent one.
One more new regulog member is the dadAX operon. The
first gene of this operon encodes the small subunit of respiratory D-amino acids dehydrogenase [46]. Candidate
ArcA sites were detected in the Yersinia and Vibrionaceae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/54

genomes upstream of the dadAX operon. Thus, the use of
D-amino acids as electron donors in some genomes may
be controlled by ArcA.
An interesting example of taxon-specific regulation was
observed for duplicated operons for trimethylamine Noxide (TMAO) reductases and formate dehydrogenases.
Two operons for TMAO reductases, torCAD and torYZ,
were found in E. coli. [47,48]. The torCAD expression is
known to be repressed by the NarL protein and activated
by the transcriptional factor TorR [49,50], whereas torYZ
is transcribed at a constant low level [47]. In the three Pasteurellaceae genomes, where the torCAD genes are absent,
candidate sites for all three studied regulators were found
upstream of the torYZ operon. In the Vibrionaceae
genomes, the torCAD transcription is likely controlled by
Fnr, whereas the torYZ expression seems to be regulated by
NarP (see Table 1).
A similar situation was observed in E. coli for two formate
dehydrogenase operons: the fdn operon is known to be
regulated by the Fnr, NarL, and NarP proteins [51,52],
whereas the expression of the fdo operon is constant [53].
Previously Fnr binding site was predicted upstream of the
formate reductase operon in Y. pestis [27]. Careful analysis
of the phylogenetical trees for the Fdn and Fdo proteins
(additional file 3) revealed that both Yersinia spp. contain
fdo but lack fdn genes. In both Yersinia spp. expression of
the fdo operon is regulated by all three studied regulators.
Further, regulation was predicted for the fdhD gene whose
product is essential for the formation of the Fdn and Fdo
protein complexes [54]. Accordingly, candidate regulatory
sites upatream of fdhD were found only in genomes containing the fdo or fdn operon.
Central metabolism and fermentation
Previously, respiration-dependent regulation of some
genes involved in the central metabolism was studied in
experiment [5,55,56] and computationally [27,28]. Here,
candidate regulatory sites were observed upstream of
some more genes involved in the glycolysis, the gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the pyruvate and lactate metabolism: sfcA, ppsA, pckA, eno, pgk, talB
and aldB. Unexpectedly, in the Pasteurellaceae, candidate
NarP binding sites were found upstream of operons for
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and citrate cycle enzymes,
such as eno, pgk, mdh and sucABCD (see Table 1).
Metabolism of carbohydrates
Regulation of sugar metabolism genes by the three considered regulators has not been shown experimentally. Here,
conserved candidate sites for Fnr, ArcA or NarP were
found upstream of some operons involved in the metabolism of various sugars. This is not surprising: indeed, the
sugar metabolism is closely related to the central metabo-

Candidate sites are shown by letters: F – Fnr sites; A – ArcA sites, N – NarP sites; conserved sites are shown by capital letters, non-conserved ones
by lower-case letters (for details see "Methods"). Absence of sites is shown by dashes. Absent genes are shown by zeros. Cases when the operon
structure is not conserved are denoted by asterics.

lism and sugars provide substrates for the energy production [57]. In particular, candidate sites were observed
upstream of the operons ptsHI-crr and mtlADR (glucoseand mannitol-specific phosphotransferase systems,
respectively [58]), deoCABD (degradation of pyrimidine
deoxynucleosydes via deoxyribose-phosphates to acetaldehyde and glycerol-3-phosphate [59]), nagB (glucosamine-6-phosphate
deaminase
[60]),
gntXY
(gluconate transport system [61]), malQ (amylomaltase
[62]), and glgBXCAP (glycogen biosynthesis and catabolism [63]).
An unusual situation was observed for the glg genes.
According to criteria described in "Methods", these genes
were assigned to a single operon in the Yersinia spp. In the
Pasteurellaceae, the glg genes are preceded by the malQ
gene that belongs to the candidate malQ-glgBXCAP
operon. In both Yersinia spp., candidate Fnr sites were
found upstream of the glgB gene, whereas in the Pasteurellaceae, Fnr and NarP sites were found upstream of the
malQ gene. Site conservation despite operon reorganization shows that the regulation of the glg genes by respiratory factors is important for the bacterial cell.
However, the degree of conservation of candidate sites for
the carbohydrate metabolism genes is relatively low compared to genes from other groups, the observed sites are
often taxon-specific, and there are almost no cases of double or triple combinations. This also is not surprising,
since regulation of carbohydrate transport and catabolism
is extremely flexible and fast-evolving (O.Laikova, personal communication). On the other hand, each individual predictions should be considered as preliminary.
Fatty acids metabolism
The regulation of operons involved in the fatty acids
metabolism was not described previously, although there
were some indirect indications to the existence of such
regulation [27,64]. Some of these operons have conserved
binding sites and thus are likely to be regulated.

The homologous fabBA and fadIJ operons encode protein
complexes for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The FadBA
protein complex is used in the fatty acids degradation in
both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas FadIJ is
used predominantly during anaerobiosis [64,65]. Previously an effect of the arcA mutation on the fadBA operon
expression was observed, although direct regulation was
not shown [13]. Here, conserved candidate sites for Fnr
and/or ArcA were found upstream of both these operons
(Table 1).
The regulation was also predicted for the fadD, acpP-fabF,
and fadL operons involved in the fatty acids metabolism
and transport.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/54

There are two possible explanations for the regulation of
the fatty acids metabolism by the respiratory regulators.
First, the fatty acids metabolism is closely related to the
central metabolism, for example, through acetyl-CoA
[66,67]. Second, different enzymes for the fatty acids oxydation are preferred under aerobic and anaerobic conditions [64].
Nucleotide reductases
Fnr is known to activate the nrdDG operon in E. coli under
anaerobiosis, whereas expression of one more operon
encoding nucleotide reductase, nrdAB, is uneffected by the
Fnr protein in E. coli [68]. This situation is conserved in
the Yersinia spp. and the Vibrionaceae. In contrast, in the
Pasteurellaceae, candidate Fnr sites were found upstream
of the nrdAB operon. However, in H. ducreyi, where the
nrdDG operon is absent, no candidate sites were found
upstream of nrdAB. So, the overall picture seems to be that
at least one nucleotide reductase operon must be transcribed constantly.
Transport
Previously, regulation by at least one of the studied regulators was shown experimentally for a number of E. coli
transporter operons, see references in Table 1. Here, we
identified additional transporters in the studied regulogs
and demonstrated changes in the regulatory interactions.

Previously regulation of dicarboxylate transporters genes
dcuA, dcuB and dcuC was shown for E.coli (see references
in Table 1). However, in other gamma-proteobacteria the
regulation of these genes may be different. Thus, the regulation of the dcuA and dcuB genes is typical for the Yersinia
spp. and Pasteurellaceae, whereas in Vibrionaceae the regulation was observed for dcuC.
Regulators of transcription
Prediction of regulation of genes encoding different transcription factors seems to be one of the most interesting
results of this study. Previously, the fnr, arcA, narP, and
narQ genes were shown to be regulated by respiratory regulators in E. coli (see references in Table 1).

Fis is one of the most abundant DNA architectural proteins. It regulates supercoiling of bacterial DNA [69].
Experimentally it was shown that, in E. coli, Fis together
with Fnr and/or ArcA regulates expression of the nrf [70],
nir [71], ndh [72], adhE [73], yfiD [74], sdhCDAB-sucABCD
[75], acnB [76], and narK [77] operons. In E. coli, the fis
gene is cotranscribed with dusB [78] and the structure of
the dusB-fis locus is conserved in all studied genomes. In
the Pasteurellaceae, candidate Fnr and ArcA sites were
found upstream of the dusB gene. Thus, in these genomes
fis transcription is likely to be controlled by the respiratory
regulators. Since Fis participates in the control of expres-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:54

sion of respiration genes, it is possible that Fnr and ArcA
regulate expression of the fis gene to optimize the transcription control of these genes.
The cpxRA operon encodes a two-component regulatory
system involved in the environmental stress response
[79]. Some data point to cross-interactions between the
CpxR-CpxA and ArcA-ArcB systems in E. coli [80]. In the
Pasteurellaceae, conserved Fnr and ArcA sites were
detected upstream of the cpx operon.
OxyR is the transcriptional factor for the oxidative stress
response [81]. In all Pasteurellaceae, candidate ArcA sites
were observed upstream of oxyR gene. Since ArcA is active
as a transcription factor only in the absence of the oxygen,
it may be possible that in these conditions it represses the
transcription of the unneeded oxygen sensor gene oxyR.
However, the regulatory logic in this case is not absolutely
clear.
In the Pasteurellaceae, conserved Fnr sites were found
upstrean of the fur gene, whereas in the Vibrionaceae, the
fur gene has candidate sites for ArcA. The observation that
the Fur protein, ferric uptake regulator [82], is controlled
by the respiratory regulators is not unexpected, because
iron is an obligatory component of most respiratory complexes [2] and the transcriptional factor Fnr itself [83].
Other members of regulogs
In addition to the regulogs members described above,
some genes were assigned to regulogs based on the formal
criterion (see "Methods"), although their relevance to the
respiration and central metabolism is not obvious. These
genes and the candidate Fnr, ArcA, and NarP sites are
shown in additional files 4 and 5. Although in the absence
of a functional link, these predictions are somewhat
weaker then the ones in the previous sections, we belive
that they still warrant experimental verification.
Divergons and false-positive predictions
In some cases we found sites in intergenic regions
between two genes forming divergons. In such cases it is
not immediately clear, which of the two divergently transcribed operons is regulated. These divergent operon pairs
are fadR/nhaB-dsbB in most studied genomes, yfiC/brnQ,
torD/torR, and yhdWXYZ/VV12702 in the Vibrionaceae,
and fkpA/slyX in the Yersinia spp. and the Pasteurellaceae.
The data about candidate sites upstream of divergent
genes are present in additional file 5.

In other cases candidate regulog members in divergons
were dismissed, as functional analysis made it clear which
of two divergent operons was regulated. This category
includes the argR, ung, nfo and potABCD operons (additional file 6).

Discussion
Composition of regulogs in different families
The above analysis shows that regulation often differs
between bacterial families. To assess the relative role of
each studied regulator in different families, we calculated
the number of genes and operons belonging to each regulog in each studied family. As expected, the composition
of regulogs turned out to be quite diverse.

For example, in the Yersinia spp., the NarP regulog is significantly smaller than in other studied families (Figure
1a). It is not surprising, given that in these bacteria the
nitrate- and nitrite-respiration system is strongly reduced,
and only nitrate, but not nitrite, is used as an electron
acceptor [24]. Accordingly, in these organisms, the nitrate
respiration plays a less prominent role, and the nitratesensing system also is less important as compared to other
studied genomes.
In contrast, in Pasteurellaceae, the NarP regulog is somewhat enlarged in comparison with the other two taxons.
One more feature of this group is the increased overlap
between regulogs. For example, conserved sites for both
Fnr and NarP regulators were found upstream of 13 operons containing 53 genes (Figure 1b).
In the Vibrionaceae, the ArcA regulog is extended as compared to the other groups. In this family, conserved ArcA
sites were found upstream of 47 operons containing 99
genes (Figure 1c).
Regulatory cascades
Group-specific regulatory cascades were predicted based
on candidate sites upstream of the fnr, arcA, and narP
genes.

In E. coli, such cascades were analyzed experimentally
(Figure 2a) [6,7,84]. There, the Fnr protein is the main regulator of the respiration that controls expression of genes
for other regulators. Fnr represses transcription of the
narXL operon [6] and regulates expression of the arcA
gene [7]. Moreover, the fnr gene is autoregulated [6]. The
arcA gene was predicted to be positively autoregulated
[28]. The regulators of the nitrate and nitrate respiration,
in turn, form a complicated regulatory network, where
NarL activates expression of the narXL, narP and narQ
operons, and NarP, in turn, activates the narXL transcription [84].
However, this situation is not conserved in the genomes
of other gamma-proteobacteria. In the Yersinia spp., Fnr
apparently regulates the arcA expression and both fnr and
arcA genes are autoregulated (Figure 2b). No regulatory
sites were found upstream of the narP and narX genes.
Thus, in the Yersinia spp., Fnr is the main regulator of res-

piration, similarly to E. coli. However, unlike the situation
in the latter, in the Yersinia spp., the nitrate- and nitriteresponsive regulatory system does not participate in the
regulatory cascades.
Even more remarkable changes in the regulatory cascades
were observed in the Pasteurellaceae. In most of these
genomes, candidate sites for Fnr, ArcA and NarP were
found upstream of the fnr gene (Figure 2c), whereas no
conserved regulatory sites were observed for the arcA and
narP genes. This suggests that in this family the role of Fnr
in the regulatory cascades decreases in comparison with E.
coli. Minor differences were seen in H. ducreyi, where no
NarP sites were found upstream of the fnr gene (Figure
2c).
In the Vibrionaceae, autoregulation for all regulator genes,
fnr, arcA and narP, was observed. The ArcA protein also

seems to regulate the narP gene, whereas Fnr controls the
expression of the arcA and narP genes (Figure 2d). Thus,
in these organisms, Fnr again is the main respiration regulator, but the role of ArcA in the regulatory cascades is
increased as compared to E. coli.
Thus, the E.coli pattern of regulatory cascades is not conserved in other gamma-proteobacteria, and the relative
role of each regulator in the regulatory cascades differs
between families. When more genomes become available,
it might be possible to describe the evolution of this regulatory system in more detail.
Family-specific regulatory interactions
In addition to differences in the regulatory cacades, there
are major differences in the functional content of the respiration regulogs. These data are summarized in Figures 3,
4, 5.

Enterobacteriaceae (Yersinia spp.)
Two genomes of the Yersinia spp. were selected for this
study because of the presence of a single regulator of the
nitrate and nitrite respiration regulator NarP. These bacteria demonstrate a number of features that distinguish
them from both E. coli and the two other studied families
(Figure 3).

piration using formate as an electron donor (nap, ccm, fdo,
fdhD), and upstream of the nir operon, whose products
protect the cell from the toxic nitrite.

Most of these features relate to the nitrate and nitrite respiration. First of all, regulation is mediated by the unusual
pair NarX-NarP, in contrast to other bacteria that have the
pair NarQ-NarP (for details see below).

Pasteurellaceae
These bacteria demonstrate considerable changes in the
regulatory cascade structure (see above). In the organisms
from this group, Fnr loses the role of the main regulator.

Another feature of the Yersinia spp. regulation is simplification of the regulatory cascades (see above). In comparison with E. coli, only the Fnr-ArcA cascade is conserved,
whereas nitrate and nitrite responsive proteins seem to be
excluded from cascades. This has an effect on the NarP
regulog: in the respiration subsystem, candidate sites were
found only upstream of genes essential for the nitrate res-

A conspicious feature is the absence of orthologs for the
ArcA-activating sensor ArcB (data not shown). Such situation was observed in another gamma-proteobacterium,
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [85]. It is possible that the role
of the ArcA-activating protein is played by CpxA that is
homologous to ArcB. Regulation of the cpxRA operon by
Fnr and ArcA also points to this possibility.

On the contrary, the Fnr and ArcA regulogs seemed to be
quite similar to the corresponding regulogs in other studied genomes.

Figure 5
Regulatory interactions in Vibrionaceae
Regulatory interactions in Vibrionaceae. Notation as in Figure 3.
A specific feature of the Pasteurellaceae is also the existence of downstream cascades, as several transcription factor-encoding genes, cpxRA, fis, oxyR and fur, are preceded
by conserved candidate sites. All of these operons, except
fur, have no candidate sites in other studied genomes.
One possible explanation might be that drastic re-structuring of the regulatory cascades during evolution of the
Pasteurellaceae required additional fine tuning of the respiratory metabolism.
The increased role of the NarP transcriptional factor in the
regulatory cascades is consistent with the expansion of the
NarP regulog (Figure 4). This expansion is realized in different ways. For example, upstream of the cyd and nqr
operons, NarP sites emerged in addition to the existing
Fnr and ArcA ones. In the case of the mdh, eno and suc
operons, we observe a change in the regulatory interactions, where NarP candidate sites appear instead of Fnr of
ArcA sites seen in other families. Finally, NarP sites
upstream of the eno and talB genes appear in the Pasteurel-

laceae, while there are no sites for the studied factors in
other genomes.
Vibrionaceae
In these genomes, the Fnr role as the main regulator is
conserved, but the role of the ArcA in the regulatory cascades slightly increases.

Again, this agrees with the expansion of the ArcA regulog,
as there appear ArcA sites upstream of genes of central
metabolism (Figure 5). Conserved candidate ArcA binding sites were also found upstream of other genes (additional file 4).

there are no obvious links between the bacterial lifestyle
and specific regulatory interactions or regulog composition.

and development of comparative genomic methods,
extensive analysis of a complex regulatory system in multiple genomes has become possible.

Variability of the nitrate and nitrite responsive regulatory
system
Comparison of three global transcription regulators, Fnr,
ArcA and NarP, demonstrates that the NarP-dependent
regulation is the most flexible.

Here we applied a comparative genomic technique to the
analysis of global regulation of respiration in numerous
gamma-proteobacterial genomes. We analyzed three
structurally different but functionally related regulatory
systems.

As we could not construct a NarL-site recognition rule, we
considered only genomes containing NarP but not NarL.
In all these genomes, the cytoplasmic nitrate respiratory
system is absent and all reactions for the reduction of
nitrate through nitrite to ammonium must occur in the
periplasm. For this purpose, the proteins encoded by nap,
ccm and nrf are sufficient. On the other hand, the genes for
the cytoplasmic nitrate reduction, narGHJI and narK, are
absent. In some studied genomes, the Yersinia spp. and
most of the Vibrionaceae, the nir operon also is conserved
[24]. This operon is used for the cytoplasmic nitrite reduction to ammonium, neutralizing toxic nitrite and providing ammonium as a substrate for the nitrogen
assimilation [2]. Without the use of the cytoplasmic
nitrite reduction, there is no need to select between the
more effective, but also more dangerous, nitrate reduction
in the cytoplasm, and the less effective but safer periplasmic reduction. Thus, all studied organisms do not require
duplicated two-component regulatory systems and use
the single pair NarP-NarQ.

One of the advantages of the applied technique is the possibility to study genomes for which no experimental data
are available. It also allows one to find new members of
regulons and to detect taxon-specific features of regulation. Thus, the saturation of the taxonomic space by complete genome sequences increases the opportunities for
the application of comparative genomics.

In the Yersinia spp., an unusual sensor-regulator pair,
NarX-NarP, was observed (additional file 7) [24]. However, in these genomes the sensor protein lacks the
cysteine cluster typical for NarX from other species
[23,24]. Thus, we can suppose that NarX from Yersinia
spp. acts as NarQ.
Another interesting result was the observation of conserved candidate NarP sites upstream of genes for aerobic
respiration, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and citrate cycle,
mdh, eno, pgk, sucABCD and nqr in Pasteurellaceae, and
cydAB in the Pasteurellaceae and the Vibrionaceae. Regulation of genes for the aerobic metabolism by NarQ-NarP
system may be explained by the fact that the NarQ sensor
protein is sensitive to aeration [96].

Conclusion
Previously the regulation of respiration in the gammaproteobacteria was well studied only in Escherichia coli
and two experimental approaches prevailed. The first one
was studying the regulation of a particular operon by multiple factors. The second approach was the analysis of
multiple genes controlled by a specific regulatory system
in one genome. With sequencing of complete genomes

In this article and supplementary materials we present the
data about candidate sites, both conserved and non-conserved, in multiple genomes. These data are interesting
from the point of view of evolution and also may be of use
for experimental biology. At that, prediction of the specific sites upstream of particular operons facilitates the
work of experimentalist in finding new members of regulons.
In the particular case of the respiration regulation, we
were able to predict not only taxon-specific members of
regulons, but also taxon-specific changes in regulatory
cascades. We demonstrated considerable changes of regulatory interactions in different families and relative stability of the metabolic and regulatory systems taken as a
whole. Similar observations were made in studies of dissimilatory metabolism of nitrogen oxides [97], iron
homeostasis [98] and nitrogen fixation (work in
progress). Overall, existence of a stable system core, rewiring of regulatory cascades accompanied by shuffling of
the regulators, and existence of taxon-specific periphery
seem to be common features of all complex regulatory
systems. At present, it is not clear what drives these
changes. We have observed a correlation between the regulon size and the position of a regulator in regulatory cascades: regulators with larger regulons tend to occupy top
positions in cascaeds, and thus re-wiring of cascades is
accompanied with extension of regulons. On the other
hand, there is no obvious link to differences in the species'
lifestyles, metabolic capabilities, etc.

Methods
Genomes
Respiration was studied in ten genomes of organisms
from three bacterial families:

Enterobacteriaceae (Yersinia pestis KIM, YP; Yersinia enterocolitica type 0:8, YE), Pasteurellaceae (Pasteurella multocida
Pm70, PM; Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans HK1651,
AA; Haemophilus influenzae Rd, HI; Haemophilus ducreyi

CMCP6, VV; Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633, VP;

of divergently transcribed genes. These observations demonstrate that the filtration procedure seems to be sufficiently effective to remove most false positives. On the
other hand, each individual prediction should be considered as preliminary. Another caveat is that "orphan" sites
(species-specific sites upstream of genes not regulated by
other considered factors) cannot be identified by the
applied procedure.

The complete genome sequences of Y. pestis [99], P. multocida [100], H. influenzae [101], H. ducreyi [GenBank:AE017143], V. vulnificus [102], V. parahaemolyticus
[103], V. cholerae [104], and V. fischeri [105] were downloaded from the GenBank database [106]. The complete
sequence of Y. enterocolitica was taken from the Sanger
Institute web site [107]. The complete sequence of A.
actinomycetemcomitans was taken from the University of
Oklahoma's Advanced Center for Genome Technology
web site [108].

Possible operon structure was taken into account as follows. Genes were assumed to belong to one operon if (i)
they were transcribed in the same direction, (ii) the intergenic distances did not exceed 200 nucleotides, and (iii)
two previous conditions were met in genomes from different families. These conditions are known to perform well
in operon prediction [111].

Comparative genomics of family-specific regulation
To describe three interacting regulatory systems, comparative genomic approaches were used [109]. Candidate
sites were identified in upstream regions of annotated
genes, including hypothetical ones. A gene was considered a putative member of a regulog (a group of regulated
orthologs) [110], if it had an upstream candidate site in
several genomes. Site search was performed in gene
upstream regions, -500 to +100 nucleotides relative to the
gene start, excluding coding regions of upstream genes.
The recognition profiles (nucleotide weight matrices)
[109] for Fnr [27], ArcA [28] and NarP [24] were described
previously. The recognition profiles and sequence logos
are shown in additional files 8 and 9, respectively.

The cutoff profile scores for ArcA and FNR sites were set
using known E. coli sites from the dpinteract database
[111]. All E. coli FNR-binding sites passed the threshold
3.75, and all E. coli ArcA binding sites, but one outlier
(upstream of the gene pflA), scored above the used threshold 4.00. With these parameters about 600 genes per
genome had candidate sites in upstream regions. The cutoff for candidate NarP binding sites (3.50) was defined as
the minimum score of candidate NarP sites upstream of
the nitrate and nitrite respiration genes (nap, nrf and ccm)
in all studied genomes. This cutoff produced about 300
genes per genome.
Clearly, most candidate sites at this stage were false positives, but the threshold could not be made stricter without
loss of true sites. Anyhow, after the filtration procedure
described below the number of candidate regulog members significantly decreased. Only few genes with no obvious functional link to the studied systems remained, and
in most cases this was caused by sites occurring upstream

As the regulation of respiration had not been experimentally analyzed in any of the studied organisms, we developed a technique based on exhaustive pairwise
comparison of genomes within taxonomic groups. For the
Pasteurellaceae and the Vibrionaceae, a gene was assigned
to a regulog if candidate regulatory sites were found
upstream of an operon containing this gene in at least
three genomes of organisms from the same family. For the
Yersinia spp., a gene was considered to be a member of a
regulog if candidate sites were found in both Y. pestis and
Y. enterocolitica genomes. Such sites were called "conserved sites". Sites that did not satisfy these requirements
were called "nonconserved". Further, if a site for one regulator was found upstream of a particular gene in one
taxon, we searched for sites for all three regulators
upstream of this gene and its orthologs in all studied
genomes.
This approach allowed us to find new members of regulogs and to describe taxon-specific features of regulation.
Its limitation is that it allows one to detect only the fact of
regulation but, due to the absence of mapped promoters
in the studied genomes, does not predict the type of regulation, such as repression or activation.
Programs
The search for candidate sites was done using Genome
Explorer [112]. Orthologs were determined as pairs of
best bi-directional hits [113] identified by Genome
Explorer [112]. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were done using ClustalX [114]. Search for
homologs of studied genes in sequence databases was
done using the BLAST program [115] with E-value cutoff
e-20.
