Abstract
Background: Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations have been implicated in a broad
spectrum of diseases. With over 3000 mtDNA variations reported across databases, establishing
pathogenicity of variations in mtDNA is a major challenge. We have designed and developed a
comprehensive weighted scoring system (MtSNPscore) for identification of mtDNA variations that
can impact pathogenicity and would likely be associated with disease. The criteria for pathogenicity
include information available in the literature, predictions made by various in silico tools and
frequency of variation in normal and patient datasets. The scoring scheme also assigns scores to
patients and normal individuals to estimate the cumulative impact of variations. The method has
been implemented in an automated pipeline and has been tested on Indian ataxia dataset (92
individuals), sequenced in this study, and other publicly available mtSNP dataset comprising of 576
mitochondrial genomes of Japanese individuals from six different groups, namely, patients with
Parkinson's disease, patients with Alzheimer's disease, young obese males, young non-obese males,
and type-2 diabetes patients with or without severe vascular involvement. MtSNPscore, for analysis
can extract information from variation data or from mitochondrial DNA sequences. It has a webinterface http://bioinformatics.ccmb.res.in/cgi-bin/snpscore/Mtsnpscore.pl that provides flexibility
to update/modify the parameters for estimating pathogenicity.
Results: Analysis of ataxia and mtSNP data suggests that rare variants comprise the largest part of
disease associated variations. MtSNPscore predicted possible role of eight and 79 novel variations
in ataxia and mtSNP datasets, respectively, in disease etiology. Analysis of cumulative scores of
patient and normal data resulted in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of ~0.5 and accuracy
of ~0.7 suggesting that the method may also predict involvement of mtDNA variation in diseases.

Conclusion: We have developed a novel and comprehensive method for evaluation of
mitochondrial variation and their involvement in disease. Our method has the most comprehensive
set of parameters to assess mtDNA variations and overcomes the undesired bias generated as a
result of better-studied diseases and genes. These variations can be prioritized for functional assays
to confirm their pathogenic status.

Background
Mitochondria are the primary energy-generating
organelles in eukaryotes possessing the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) comprised of five protein
complexes. While the majority of the protein subunits of
these complexes are nuclear encoded a set of 13 protein
subunits as well as 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs are encoded in
human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [1]. These form the
essential structural and functional components of complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport chain and of
complex V (ATP synthase). Besides, mitochondria are also
involved in other processes like intracellular signalling,
apoptosis and intermediary metabolism [2].
Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to disease phenotypes
with diverse and over-lapping symptoms as well as multiorgan involvement is being increasingly reported. These
result from mutations in mtDNA or nuclear genes and in
a majority of cases typically have cardiac and neurological
manifestations [3-5]. Heritability of mitochondrial diseases is highly variable – ranging from maternal, to Mendelian to a combination of the two [2]. The presence of
both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic mtDNA along with
extensive basal polymorphisms of the mitochondrial
genome (over 3000 variations are reported across databases like OMIM [6], MitoMap [7] and mtDB [8]) further
complicate the genetic analysis of mtDNA diseases.
Establishing pathogenicity of a sequence change in
mtDNA or identifying causal/functional polymorphisms
from this huge diversity remains a major challenge despite
many attempts in this direction [9]. For instance, the
canonical criteria for pathogenic mtDNA point mutations
proposed by DiMauro and Schon [10] is limited by its
dependence on the presence of heteroplasmy, a feature
which is not universal for pathogenicity [9]. Efforts
toward determining pathogenicity for the tRNA [11] and
Complex I genes [9], using various criteria are still insufficient for classification of a large proportion of reported
mutations or to predict their impact on phenotype and fitness [10].

mtDNA mutations in causing these diseases is unclear and
debatable [13,14]. This prompted us to develop a comprehensive method for assessing pathogenic impact of
mtDNA variations. This novel method, MtSNPscore, identifies and scores disease associated mtDNA variations by
filtering out polymorphic sites and sites with no reported
or predicted functional role. It also provides a cumulative
score for the entire mitochondrial genome in the patient
and normal individual. Thus it allows prioritization of
variations which could significantly impact function as
well as predicts through cumulative analysis whether
mitochondrial associated pathogenesis could be implicated in a diseased individual.
This method has been tested on variations in 92 sporadic
ataxia patients whose mtDNA was sequenced in this
study. Ataxia is a central nervous system (CNS) manifestation etiologically characterized by heterogeneous symptoms e.g. myoclonus or action tremor, sensory loss,
pyramidal signs, etc. This disorder is generally associated
with varying length of repeat expansion in the nuclear
genome. However, in most populations nearly 50% of the
cases of ataxia are sporadic and are not associated with
repeat expansion. In one of the autosomal recessive
ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia, involvement of the frataxin
gene encoding a mitochondrial protein has been demonstrated. This suggests that mitochondria may have an
important role in the etiology of ataxia [15]. These sporadic cases provide an ideal test set for exploring the role
of mitochondrial variation in ataxia. Involvement of trinucleotide repeat expansion in all the known ataxia genes
was excluded in the studied individuals.
We also analyzed mtSNP data comprising of 576 mitochondrial genomes of Japanese individuals from six different groups, namely, patients with Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's disease, young obese males, young non-obese
(thin) males, and type-2 diabetes patients with or without
severe vascular involvement and 96 Japanese centenarians
as controls [16].

Results and discussion
There is growing body of evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of or
influences the risk of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cardiovascular disease including cardiomyopathy, etc [3,4,12]. But the exact role and involvement of

Scores (WS). The flowchart depicts that input can either be variation or sequence data. In case sequence data is provided, it
is converted to variation data. Although the variation data is generated by comparison with rCRS, the most common normal
base is used to compare the frequency of the variation in patients and normal individuals. The variation is scanned for reported
or predicted functional impact only if its frequency is higher in patients or the variation is absent in the normal individuals. Each
variation is tested for its reported or predicted functional impact based on its genomic context (in protein coding genes/tRNA/
rRNA, etc). A Weighted Score is assigned to each variation based on the information obtained from literature and the in silico
prediction tools (scores shown in pink boxes). As seen in the inset, the scoring scheme is conceptually driven following the
Central Dogma and the scores range from 1 to 10, where a more deleterious variation gets a higher score. The parameters
and scores are implemented in a flexible manner to ensure their easy modification and updation with the advent of new information.

ence Sequence (rCRS- GenBank: AC_000021, gi:
115315570) as the reference sequence for this purpose. A
variation is scored for pathogenicity only if it is unique to
patients or its frequency is significantly higher in patients
compared to normal individuals. Each variation is
assigned a Weighted Score (WS) based on its predicted/
reported functional impact. The scoring scheme is conceptually based on the central dogma. Since mitochondrial
depletion has been reported in many diseases, the factors
that regulate mtDNA replication are thus given the highest
scores. Further, the absence of protein subunits has also
been implicated in various mitochondrial diseases and
hence transcription initiation and regulatory sites are also
given high scores. Changes at conserved sites in the members of the translation machinery (tRNAs and rRNAs) are
expected to be deleterious and are scored depending on
their conservation and implication in diseases based on
literature survey and through computational predictions.
Missense mutations are also analyzed for their effect on
protein structure/function using various prediction tools
(details in Materials and methods).
Validation of in silico prediction tools incorporated in
MtSNPscore
Four in silico prediction methods have been incorporated
in our scoring scheme to assess variations for their functional significance and possible role in disease etiology.
The efficacy of these methods was tested using a dataset of
"reported pathogenic mutations" from OMIM, MitoMap
and PubMed. Mutations which fulfilled at least one of the
following criteria were included in the analysis-

(a) a reported biochemical effect (for example, lowered
activities of the complexes)
(b) is supported by functional studies in cell lines (transmitochondrial cybrids)
(c) have been independently reported in multiple studies
As a first step, we selected mutations from literature. 121
of them which satisfied the above-mentioned criteria were
integrated in the pipeline [Additional file 1]. Of these, 52
mutations were in protein-coding genes, 66 in tRNA and
three in rRNA genes [Additional file 2].
Mutations in the protein-coding genes were used for testing the predictive power of SIFT [17], PolyPhen [18],
PHD-SNP [19] and PLHOST [20]). Excluding mutations
leading to six stop codons and three INDELs the remaining 43 mutations were tested by the four methods.
All the mutations were predicted to be deleterious/intolerant/disease-associated by at least one of the prediction
methods, 30 by two, 16 by three and two mutations by all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S8/S7

the four methods [Additional file 3 and Additional file 4].
Pathogenic mutations in the tRNA genes analyzed using
the compensatory co-evolution method [21] predicted 54
out of the 66 reported tRNA gene mutations to be deleterious. Of the remaining 12 mutations in tRNA genes,
majority were in the loop region and were not predicted
to be deleterious by this method [Additional file 3]. Taking the above observations into consideration, we integrated all of these tools into our pipeline to
comprehensively assess the functional impact of novel
mutations.
Frequency difference is not an effective parameter to
associate variations in mitochondria to diseases or
phenotypes
Amongst all the variations, those which had relatively
higher weighted score and hence predicted to be potentially deleterious were designated as prioritized variation
in ataxia and mtSNP. We observed these variations in 28
of the 37 mitochondrial genes in both the data sets [Figure
2]. A majority of these were in tRNA genes which are also
reported hot spots in many mitochondrial diseases.

Comparison of all observed variations in normal and
patient datasets show that almost half of these variations
occur with high frequency in patients [Figure 3], whereas
a much smaller fraction is predicted to be potentially deleterious. Thus, frequency difference does not seem to be a
sole determinant for disease association. A large number
of variations when analysed in the pipeline seem to be
inconsequential as determined by the weighted scores. We
discuss these observations in seven datasets – Ataxia and
six mtSNP phenotypes [Figure 4].
Ataxia data analysis
We compared entire mitochondrial genome sequences
from 92 ataxia patients against a control dataset comprised of 92 sequences from Indian population retrieved
from mtDB [8]. Variations were observed at 324 positions
across the mitochondrial genome in these ataxia patients.
Some of the variations were common and present in equal
frequencies in normal individuals and patients and some
(197) were observed at a higher frequency in ataxia cases.
Even though more that 50% of the variations were
observed at high frequency in the patients, only eight variations gave a WS greater than the threshold value set at 3
[The threshold for WS has been detailed in the methods
section]. Amongst these seven (1 – MT-ND3; 1 – MTND5; 2 – MT-COX1; 1 – MT-COX3; 2 – MT-ATP6) map to
the protein-coding genes and one to the MT-TR gene
[Additional file 5]. The T10191C mutation in MT-ND3 is
reported to be associated with Complex I deficiency
[22,23]. This non-synonymous mutation changes a
hydrophilic serine to hydrophobic proline and it is possible that defects in protein-folding may lead to decreased

of this mutation. Thus, from an initial set of 324 variations we prioritized 8 potentially disease-associated candidates. However, functional assays are required to
confirm their pathogenic status.
mtSNP data analysis
To assess the involvement of mitochondrial mutations in
other diseases, we analyzed with our method mtSNP [16]
data which consists of entire mitochondrial genome
sequences of seven groups from Japanese diseased and
healthy population. The Japanese Centenarians were used
as control data for the analysis. Our method predicted 3–
4% of the total variations (WS >= 3) as disease associated
for each mtSNP group. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), from
a total of 529 variations, 17 high-scoring variations were
obtained. Similarly, for Parkinson's disease (PD) – 20/
567, Type 2 diabetes with angiopathy (T2DA) – 21/513,
Type 2 diabetes without angiopathy (T2D) – 23/550,
obese phenotype (OB) – 19/525 and thin phenotype
(TH) – 23/558 were assigned high WSs [Additional file 5;
Figure 3; Figure 4]. These high scoring variants are probably disease-associated. Out of the total of 84 putatively
pathogenic variants, five have been reported to be disease
associated in various studies.

Summary of results – showing properties of prioritized variations in Ataxia and mtSNP groups. The summary of
the output generated by our method for the ataxia patients and mtSNP diseases. As is clear from the graph, some variations
are prioritized in more than one dataset but some are unique to the phenotypes, represented as 'overlapping' and 'unique',
respectively. Thus, these unique variations are still more potent targets for designing functional assays. All variations prioritized
in Ataxia are unique. Further, of the total 92 prioritized variations only 5 have been reported. (Intolerant – Amino acids
changes predicted deleterious by SIFT; Possibly/Probably damaging – Amino acids changes predicted deleterious by PolyPhen;
Invariant – Present at invariant sites as predicted by PLHOST; Eba – tRNA variations Predicted deleterious by compensatory
co-evolution method; AT – Ataxia; AD – Alzheimer's Disease; PD – Parkinson's Disease; T2DA – Type2 Diabetes With Angiopathy; T2D – Type2 Diabetes; OB – Obese; TH – Thin).

We also observed a few overlapping high scoring variations across mtSNP datasets not observed in the centenarians. This suggests the systemic involvement of these
mitochondrial variations in diseases or phenotypes [Figure 4]. For instance, 10 out of 17 high scoring variations
in Alzheimer's dataset are also scored high in other mtSNP
phenotypes indicating a modifier role for these variations.
The seven variations not observed in other sets may be
unique to Alzheimer's and can be tested for validation in
different AD cohorts.
Overall statistics of the mtSNP data are similar to the
trends obtained from ataxia subset. From 1275 nonredundant sites which vary in the mitochondrial genome
across these datasets our method prioritized 84. Only five
of these 84 have been reported to be disease associated in
various studies. Thus the remaining 79 high scoring variants distributed across protein-coding (some of which are
highly conserved amino acids in mammals), tRNA,
12SrRNA genes and the D-loop can be potential candidates associated with mtSNP phenotypes. Our method is
not biased towards prioritizing known mtDNA variations
and thus demonstrates that integration of available infor-

mation with predictions would be helpful in identifying
candidates for disease association studies and to some
extent overcomes the ascertainment bias resulting from
better-studied genes and diseases.
Cumulative scoring from entire mtDNA hints at
mitochondrial involvement in disease
MtSNPscore also assigns cumulative scores to patients and
normal individuals. This allows assessment of the overall
impact of variations. In the case of the Ataxia patients, the
score ranges from 1 to 41.2 and from a total of 92 patients,
32 scored more than the threshold score. On the other
hand, none of the 92 normal individuals had a score
higher than the threshold score. This resulted in an MCC
value of 0.46 and accuracy of 0.67. Similar values were
computed for the mtSNP datasets where the MCC values
range from 0.5 to 0.55 and accuracy from 0.7 to 0.73
[Additional file 6]. This suggests that the approach is useful in differentiating normal from patients and is particularly significant in case of mitochondrial diseases where it
is difficult to assess the disease-causing role of mitochondrial variations in the presence of enormous amount of
background variations.

Limitations and future strategies
Our method is an effort to provide a conceptual framework for prioritization of variations in mtDNA to assess
their functional involvement in disease phenotypes. We
have tested our hypothesis on a limited dataset restricted
to a few studies. Mitochondrial variations can be tissue
specific or its function could be a consequence of mutations in nuclear DNA, or variability in environment factors. Also, there are various studies wherein
mitochondrial variations associated to disease phenotypes are observed only in muscle tissue but not in blood
[24]. Therefore any inferences on study of mitochondrial
variations from peripheral blood have to be made with
caution.

Since the field of mitochondrial genomics has gained considerable importance leading to a surge in sequencing
data [25,26] our method is designed in a flexible manner
to incorporate any novel changes in the analysis pipeline.
We expect that the performance of this method will
improve in future updates with the advent of additional
literature and a widespread production of standardized
genome-wide association data. As a prospect, this can also
be enhanced as a systems approach wherein detrimental
defects in any one of the genes encoding members of a
correlated set of reactions i.e., reactions that always or
often function together in metabolic network, can result
in similar phenotypic consequences. This approach will
further help in understanding the genotype-phenotype
relationships and the potential identification of therapeutic targets and strategies for disease treatment [27].
Nuclear modifiers are also known to play an important
role in mitochondrial diseases and hence are also
accounted for in the scoring scheme. For example, a mutation in the MT-TE (T14709C) is reported to alter an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide in its anti-codon loop
(reference in Additional file 1) and is expected to be deleterious. In this context, another study [28] suggests the
involvement of nuclear factors in the expression of the
phenotype. This indicates that nuclear background is significant while assessing the effect of certain mitochondrial
mutations. However, this feature is presently not scored in
MtSNPscore. Also, in the present study D-loop mutations
were not scored in the datasets and the pipeline only maps
and reports the D-loop mutations. Given the enormous
heterogeneity in frequency of different variants in this
region, it is difficult to assess these variations for disease
association. This issue cannot be resolved by comparing
allele frequency differences among cases and controls but
requires understanding of the world phylogeny of human
mtDNA [29]. However, MtSNPscore web server may be
easily customized to score D-loop mutations for further
analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S8/S7

Our scoring scheme priorities only mtDNA mutations,
however, it is important to note that there are 170 nuclearencoded OXPHOS subunits and an estimated 1,500 mitochondrial proteins that are as yet untested. A systematic
evaluation of mtDNA and nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes and an investigation of epistatic interactions
between the two genomes will reveal the extent to which
mitochondrial defects play a causal role in human disease.

Conclusion
We have developed a novel and comprehensive method
to prioritize mtDNA variations for disease association. It
is evident from the analysis of sporadic ataxia patients and
mtSNP datasets, rare variants comprise a bulk of the highscoring mutations. Our results indicate that common variants in mitochondrial genome are not disease associated
as also corroborated by earlier reports [14,30]. Therefore,
whole mitochondrial genome sequencing is imperative to
evaluate its involvement in a particular disease or phenotype instead of studying the effect of individual variations.
Overall, MtSNPscore even in this limited dataset has predicted 87 novel candidates. We believe that this approach
can be implemented as a regular pre-screening method in
high throughput entire mitochondrial genome sequencing studies to prioritize mtDNA mutations for disease
association and to evaluate mitochondrial involvement in
disease as well as in reducing subsequent genotyping cost
and effort. These can be followed up through functional
assays to confirm their pathogenic status.

Materials and methods
Datasets for analysis
The study was carried out on complete mitochondrial
genome sequences of 92 probands diagnosed for sporadic
ataxia and 92 (Indian) control data from mtDB [8]. Most
of the patients were from Northern India and clinically
diagnosed at the Neuroscience Department of All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Patients were clinically tested for neurological symptoms in legs, arms,
tremor, etc. There was a wide heterogeneity in the age of
onset ranging from 1 year to 74 years. The involvement of
trinucleotide repeats expansion in all the known ataxia
genes was excluded in all these samples [Additional file

deletions in addition to substitutions. These variations
were organized individual-wise. Often instead of complete sequences only variations are reported for the complete mitochondrial genome of an individual. In such
cases to obtain the complete mitochondrial genome of
the patient the variations are mapped onto the reference
sequence. Another module has been developed to stitch
the variation data on the background of the reference
mitochondrial DNA to generate patient's mitochondrial
genome. This module adjusts for INDELs (insertion-deletions) and accordingly generates the entire mitochondrial
genome for the patient dataset. In human mtDNA there
are seven instances of overlapping bases among genes
[Additional file 8]. As can be seen that the maximum overlap is between MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8 of 45 bases, followed by 6 base overlap between MT-ND4 and MT-ND4L,
3 base overlap between MT-TI and MT-TQ and four single
base overlaps between MT-ND1/MT-TI, MT-TC/MT-TY,
MT-CO1/MT-TS and MT-ATP6/MT-CO3. It is obvious that
these variations when reported as per the rCRS will map
to two different genes and hence care is taken to map and
predict the impact of variations in such overlapping
regions.
Selecting control dataset
As mentioned earlier, for our ataxia patients, the control
dataset (Indian) was taken from mtDB. Of the 672 Japanese sequences in mtDB, 96 sequences belonging to Japanese Centenarians were used as control dataset for
comparison against the mtSNP datasets. This was done
primarily because of absence of valid control groups in
the mtDB database, as the remaining 576 Japanese
sequences in mtDB are sequences of these mtSNP datasets. Also, Centenarians might have accumulated maximum possible mtDNA mutations with age but were still
healthy. However, it is important to mention that the role
of mitochondrial mutations in mammalian aging remains
speculative, and it is still an area of intense debate [31].
For this study, Centenarians worked as a good control set,
given that their age, phenotype and variations are known,
as compared to selecting a random normal set where these
parameters may not be available.
Selection of predictive parameters and development of
scoring scheme
Scoring reported mutations
Weighted Scores are assigned to each reported mutation
as mentioned above [scores presented in Additional file 1,
column 5; Figure 1 contains a summary of the Weighted
Scores]. In case there is only one published report, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S8/S7

mutation is scored only when a cybrid (fused rho zero
cells with donor cells from patients harbouring mtDNA
mutations) or a functional assay supports the findings.
The default score assigned for this category is 6. In case the
mutation has been reported by more than one independent group and is supported by a cybrid or functional assay,
it is assigned a score of 8. On the contrary, if multiple
association studies have reported the mutation but no
other experimental validation is available, then a score of
6 is assigned. However, if the mutant phenotype is
observed only in a particular background (nuclear or
mitochondrial), then 2 is subtracted from the scores [Figure 1].
Variation in regulatory sites
(i) Promoters
Mammalian mitochondrial genome contains 2 promoters: LSP (Light Strand Promoter) & HSP (Heavy Strand
Promoter), which produce near-genomic length transcripts. After transcription RNA processing releases individual mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs [32]. Transcription from
LSP is necessary not only for gene expression but also for
production of RNA primers required for initiation of
mtDNA replication. Mitochondrial polymerase recognizes promoter elements in a sequence-specific manner
[33]. Mutations may change this interaction and affect the
mtDNA transcription rate. Hence mutations in LSP and
HSP are given default high scores of 10 and 8, respectively
(score for LSP is higher because it plays dual role – in
mtDNA replication and transcription).
(ii) Hormone Response Elements (HRE)
There are four HREs in the mitochondrial genome present
in MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2 and MT-TL1, MT-ND1 and MTDLOOP. A study suggests that steroid and thyroid hormone effects on the mitochondrial genes are direct, concomitant with the effects on nuclear genes and involving
similar molecular mechanisms as those mediating steroid-thyroid hormone actions on nuclear gene transcription [34]. The variations in HREs may affect transcription,
therefore these changes are given a high score of 8.
Variation in tRNA genes
Variations of the 22 mitochondrial tRNAs are of particular
interest because these tRNAs span only 10% of the human
mitochondrial genome yet they harbor more than half of
all known mitochondrial pathogenic mutations. It has
been reported that mitochondrial tRNA stem sites harboring pathogenic mutations have a tendency to co-evolve
with their complementary stem sites and this can be used
to distinguish pathogenic mutations from polymorphisms. On the basis of these criteria of conservation and
compensatory co-evolution, a mutation can be classified
as either benign or deleterious [21]. This method follows
evolution based computational analysis of the differences

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 8):S7

between pathogenic and non-pathogenic substitutions. It
has a high rate of accuracy for distinguishing benign variants from severely and slightly pathogenic ones. This
method has been applied to all possible mutations of the
22 mitochondrial tRNAs. The mutations disrupting
Watson-Crick (WC) pairing in stems were predicted to
have the highest probability of being deleterious, whereas
mutations in stems that to do not disrupt WC pairs have
the lowest. Mutations that are not located in stems have
an intermediate probability of being deleterious, most
likely due to the inclusion of the highly conserved anticodon loop. Lethal mutations were also classified as deleterious by this approach. Our method integrates the results
of this published analysis to score tRNA variations and
assigns deleterious changes a score of 6.
Transcription termination of the human mitochondrial
genome requires specific binding to termination factor,
mTERF. mTERF binding site coincides with tRNA-Leu
(UUR) [3237–3249]. Mutations that map within these 13
bases are given a score of 6. Further, a conserved fragment
within this region (TGGC 3237–3240) is given a score of
7. Furthermore, it has been shown that at 3243 position,
"G" is not tolerated, therefore this mutation is given a
high score of 8. Thus, scoring for mTERF is categorized in
three sections based on varying degrees of conservation
within this fragment [35]. A recent report implicates
mTERF in mtDNA replication as well [36], further underlining the importance of variations in this region.
Variation in rRNA genes
For ribosomal RNA, reported mutations and HRE sites are
screened and scored if present in the patient variation
data.
Variation in protein coding genes
Changes in protein coding genes can be synonymous or
non-synonymous. Codon assignments for mtDNA are different from the universal genetic code and thus the alternate codon table is utilized for reporting codon changes
[37]. For both non-synonymous and synonymous
changes, scores are assigned based on their association
with mitochondrial dysfunction as reported in literature.
In addition, for non-synonymous changes, predictions
from PolyPhen (Polymorphism Phenotyping: gives predictions on the basis of structure and function using physical and comparative parameters), SIFT (Sorting
Intolerant from Tolerant: gives prediction based on amino
acid conservation) and PLHOST (Peptide library based
homology search tool) have been used. Predictions of
PolyPhen and SIFT were obtained for the entire set of
mitochondrial proteins by replacing the wild-type amino
acid at all positions with every other amino acid.
PolyPhen classifies a mutation as probably damaging,
possibly damaging, benign or unknown. If a mutation is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S8/S7

predicted to be probably damaging it is given a score of 5
and if possibly damaging it is given a score of 3. Similarly,
SIFT classifies a mutation as tolerant or intolerant. A score
of 5 is assigned to intolerant mutations with high confidence and 2 to intolerant mutations with low confidence.
Further, mutations in protein motifs that are conserved
across species are expected to be deleterious. Such invariant peptides have been predicted using PLHOST. Mutations mapping to invariant peptides are given a score of 6.
Lastly, modulus of the difference in the hydrophobicity
values of the normal and mutated amino acids (obtained
from Wimley & White [38]) is added to the score. Nonsynonymous mutations altering the initiation and stop
codons are given a high score of 10.
A threshold score is set to differentiate between possible
benign and candidate pathogenic variations. In
MtSNPscore, the threshold weighted score is 3 as this is
the lowest score assigned to any parameter indicating the
pathogenicity of the variation.
Segregating variations based on their frequency difference
Variation frequency in patients is compared against the
control data by applying the Chi-square test. Although
variation data is generated by comparison with the rCRS,
for finding frequency difference, the most common base
in the normal individuals is used. The variations with significant frequency difference in the cases and controls
were subjected to further analysis.
Scoring patients and normal individuals
The cumulative score of all variations in a patient is the
Patient Score. All the variations in each patient were
scored in all normal individuals and the average of this is
the Normal Score. Patient and Normal Scores were estimated to predict involvement of mitochondrial variations
in disease.
Estimating performance of prediction
A cumulative frequency distribution curve is used to calculate the threshold score, to distinguish patients from
normal subjects. Number of patients correctly picked,
having score more than the threshold score are 'True positives' and patients that are wrongly classified, having
score less than the threshold, is 'False negative'. Similarly,
normal subjects, classified as patients, having a score
more than threshold are 'False positives'. On the contrary,
normal subjects correctly classified are 'True negatives'.
Using these four attributes performance-estimating
parameters, namely, accuracy (The percentage of predictions that are correct), sensitivity (The percentage of
patients that were predicted as patients), specificity (The
percentage of normal individuals that were predicted as
normal), precision (The percentage of positive predictions
that are correct), Kerr (The fraction of false predictions)

and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were calculated.
Age of onset and disease severity
Our method has an optional age of onset parameter in the
scoring scheme that can be used to assign scores if the
impact of age needs to be evaluated. Selection of normal
samples becomes significant in this aspect wherein data
regarding the age of normal individuals should also be
included in the analysis.
The "And" logic for assessing cumulative impact of
variations
The cumulative scores were obtained using the "AND"
logic, where individual scores were multiplied. The AND
logic implements logical conjunction meaning a high output results only if the inputs are high. The basic reason
behind selecting "AND" logic was two fold. First, to evaluate the cumulative effect of variations and second, to
account for the highly polymorphic nature of mtDNA,
where variations neither reported nor predicted to have a
role in disease are not considered even if they are informative based on their frequency difference from the control
dataset. Thus, in absence of additional information for a
variation, the score falls below threshold and mere presence of variation is not scored.
