Abstract
Background: Catalytic domains of Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) belong to a few unrelated three-dimensional
folds. While the PD-(D/E)XK fold is most common among these enzymes, crystal structures have been also determined for
single representatives of two other folds: PLD (R.BfiI) and half-pipe (R.PabI). Bioinformatics analyses supported by mutagenesis
experiments suggested that some REases belong to the HNH fold (e.g. R.KpnI), and that a small group represented by R.Eco29kI
belongs to the GIY-YIG fold. However, for a large fraction of REases with known sequences, the three-dimensional fold and the
architecture of the active site remain unknown, mostly due to extreme sequence divergence that hampers detection of
homology to enzymes with known folds.
Results: R.Hpy188I is a Type II REase with unknown structure. PSI-BLAST searches of the non-redundant protein sequence
database reveal only 1 homolog (R.HpyF17I, with nearly identical amino acid sequence and the same DNA sequence specificity).
Standard application of state-of-the-art protein fold-recognition methods failed to predict the relationship of R.Hpy188I to
proteins with known structure or to other protein families. In order to increase the amount of evolutionary information in the
multiple sequence alignment, we have expanded our sequence database searches to include sequences from metagenomics
projects. This search resulted in identification of 23 further members of R.Hpy188I family, both from metagenomics and the
non-redundant database. Moreover, fold-recognition analysis of the extended R.Hpy188I family revealed its relationship to the
GIY-YIG domain and allowed for computational modeling of the R.Hpy188I structure. Analysis of the R.Hpy188I model in the
light of sequence conservation among its homologs revealed an unusual variant of the active site, in which the typical Tyr residue
of the YIG half-motif had been substituted by a Lys residue. Moreover, some of its homologs have the otherwise invariant Arg
residue in a non-homologous position in sequence that nonetheless allows for spatial conservation of the guanidino group
potentially involved in phosphate binding.
Conclusion: The present study eliminates a significant "white spot" on the structural map of REases. It also provides important
insight into sequence-structure-function relationships in the GIY-YIG nuclease superfamily. Our results reveal that in the case
of proteins with no or few detectable homologs in the standard "non-redundant" database, it is useful to expand this database
by adding the metagenomic sequences, which may provide evolutionary linkage to detect more remote homologs.

Background
Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) form one of the
largest groups of biochemically characterized enzymes
(reviews: [1,2]). They usually recognize a short (4–8 bp)
palindromic sequence of double-stranded DNA and catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds at precise
positions within or close to this sequence, leaving "blunt"
ends or "sticky" (5' or 3') overhangs. They form restriction-modification (RM) systems together with DNA
methyltransferases (MTases) of the same or a similar
sequence specificity, whose enzymatic activity leads to
methylation of the target sequence and, consequently, its
protection against the cleavage by the REase [3]. Type II
RM systems behave as selfish "toxin-antitoxin" genetic
modules; they undergo rampant horizontal transfer and
parasitize the cells of prokaryotic hosts to ensure the
maintenance of their DNA [4-6]. The activity of the RM
systems manifests itself by destruction of DNA molecules
without the required methylation patterns, e.g. DNA molecules of invading phages or plasmids, or the genomic
DNA of their host cells that once had the RM genes but
have lost them.
The activity of REases is the target of selection pressure
involving various agents: their host, the invading DNA
molecules, and their competitors including other RM systems [7-10]. Presumably because of the absence of simple
constant selection pressure on the REase activity, they
undergo rapid divergence, and as a consequence, different
REase families exhibit very little sequence similarity
(review: [11]). Besides, there is formidable evidence,
mainly from crystallographic analyses, that these enzymes
have originated independently in the evolution on at least
several occasions.

tion has been recently supported by mutagenesis of the
R.Eco29kI active site [23]. Among of all REase folds, the
mechanism of action of GIY-YIG and half-pipe nucleases
is least well understood, and no co-crystal structures are
available for any member of these superfamilies.
A recent large-scale bioinformatics survey of Type II REase
sequences [24] indicated that for about 81% of experimentally characterized (i.e. not putative) enzymes, the
three-dimensional fold can be predicted based on
advanced bioinformatics analyses, mainly protein foldrecognition and analysis of amino acid conservation patterns and secondary structure prediction (review of methodology: [25]). However, the other REases remain
unassigned to known folds and the architectures of their
active sites and potential mechanisms of action remain
obscure.
R.Hpy188I is one of the REases, for which no fold prediction have been made thus far. R.Hpy188I recognizes the
unique sequence, TCNGA, and cleaves the DNA between
nucleotides N and G in its recognition sequence to generate a one-base 3' overhang [26]. Its orthologs are found
among many, but not all, strains of Helicobacter pylori that
have been tested with respect to the REase activity [27]. In
this work, we present the results of a bioinformatics analysis that has detected remote relationship between
R.Hpy188I and known GIY-YIG nucleases thanks to utilization of metagenomics sequences to generate a multiple
sequence alignment with enhanced evolutionary information. We suggest that this approach could be applied to
predict structure of other proteins, for which fold-recognition analyses done with standard alignments have failed.

Results
Thus far, REases have been found to belong to at least five
unrelated structural folds. Most of REases belong to the
PD-(D/E)XK superfamily of Mg2+-dependent nucleases,
which also includes various proteins involved in DNA
recombination and repair [12,13]. Two REases with different folds have been found to be Mg2+-independent: R.BfiI
belongs to the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily of
phosphodiesterases [14,15], while R.PabI exhibits a novel
"half-pipe" fold [16,17]. A number of REases have been
predicted to be related to the HNH superfamily of metaldependent nucleases, which groups together enzymes
with various activities, such as recombinases, DNA repair
enzymes, and homing endonucleases [12,18]. For some
of these REases from the HNH superfamily, bioinformatics predictions of the active site have been substantiated
by mutagenesis; examples include R.KpnI [19], R.MnlI
[20], and R.Eco31I [21]. Finally, R.Eco29kI and its two
close homologs have been predicted to belong to the GIYYIG superfamily of nucleases that includes e.g. DNA
repair enzymes and homing nucleases [22]; this predic-

Initial bioinformatics analysis of R.Hpy188I and its
homologs
The lack of overall sequence conservation among REases,
the absence of invariable residues even in the active site
and the presence of several alternative folds makes structure prediction and generation of multiple sequence
alignments for these enzymes a non-trivial task. In order
to predict the structure of R.Hpy188I, we used the GeneSilico meta-server, which is a gateway to a number of
third-party algorithms (see Methods). In particular, we
predicted the secondary structure of this enzyme and carried out the fold recognition analysis to identify the structures of potentially homologous proteins in the Protein
Data Bank that could serve as modeling templates. Unfortunately, querying the meta-server with R.Hpy188I
sequence alone has not revealed any significant matches
to proteins of known structure (for a discussion of significance thresholds of individual FR methods, see the Methods section). Of all methods used, only HHSEARCH
revealed a match to GIY-YIG nucleases, albeit at the 9th

position of the ranking, with a score that did not indicate
statistical significance (probability 0.113, e-value 68).
Most of fold recognition methods make their predictions
not for a single sequence, but for a multiple sequence
alignment generated by PSI-BLAST searches of the nonredundant (nr) NCBI database (or of a subset of
sequences culled from this database). Analysis of an independently carried out PSI-BLAST run against that database
(with e-value threshold of 1e-3) revealed only one nearly
identical sequence, of REase R.HpyF17I that exhibits only
1 amino acid difference and 4 additional amino acids at
the N terminus (Sapranauskas, R., Lubys, A. and Janulaitis, A. unpublished reference "Cloning and analysis of
the TCNGA-specific restriction-modification system from
Helicobacter pylori strain A17-2"). The results of fold recognition analysis starting from R.HpyF17I or from an alignment of R.Hpy188I and R.HpyF17I, were the same as
those starting from R.Hpy188I alone. Thus, R.Hpy188I
can be considered an "ORFan" [28], at least with respect
to the nr database.
Previously, in the course of bioinformatics analysis of
R.NlaIV enzyme, we found that inclusion of sequences
from metagenomics projects can increase information
content of a multiple sequence alignment and improve
detection of remote homologies, in particular for proteins
with very few homologs in the nr database [29]. Thus, we
carried out a new PSI-BLAST search for R.Hpy188I (also
with e-value threshold of 1e-3), of the env_nr database
(protein sequences deduced from environmental DNA
samples), obtained from the NCBI server database. This
search revealed 9 sequences, with e-values ranging from
3e-10 to 3e-4. Again, running FR analyses for these
sequences gave no significant matches to any structure.
Nonetheless, a PSI-BLAST search of a database comprising
both nr AND env_nr revealed an increased number of
sequences. In the search, 25 sequences including 18 from
marine metagenome [30] were found to exhibit significant scores (e-values < e-4) and a conserved pattern of residues (I/V)-Y-X9-(K)-I-G (where X indicates any amino
acid residue) associated with a predicted β-hairpin structure that remotely resembled the genuine bipartite GIYYIG motif. FR analysis of a multiple sequence alignment
calculated for the sequences returned by the PSI-BLAST
search revealed the relationship of these sequences to the
GIY-YIG superfamily, according to the following servers:
HHSEARCH (probability 0.946), FFAS (score -12.6),
mGenTHREADER (probability 0.422), FUGUE (score
10.3), INUB (score 44.1). According to the Livebench
evaluation, all these scores indicate higher reliability than
the threshold of approximately 5% false positives (see
Methods) and in our experience can be taken as reasonably confident 3D fold prediction. Further, the consensus
predictor PCONS selected 1yd0 as a preferred template

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/48

with score 0.665, a value almost exactly at the threshold.
Thus, we estimate that a probability of incorrect fold prediction for the R.Hpy188I family is around 5%.
We conclude that utilization of evolutionary information
from metagenomics sequences can greatly increase the
information content of a multiple sequence alignment, to
the point where a reasonably sized family can be detected
for a sequence, which appears as an "ORFan" when only
the nr database is considered. An extended multiple
sequence alignment that includes metagenomics
sequences together with proteins from the nr database can
then be used as a sensitive probe in protein fold-recognition, for detection of remote homologies to proteins of
known structure.
Molecular modeling of R.Hpy188I
It is well known that fold recognition methods can produce artifacts. For instance, sequence alignments to wrong
templates can reveal misleading local similarity of amino
acid residues, and generate structures that are completely
misfolded. Thus, in order to substantiate the sequencebased prediction of membership of R.Hpy188I in the GIYYIG superfamily (with the confidence of FR predictions
estimated to be around 95%), we decided to build a
model of its structure and evaluate its quality on the threedimensional level. Although the GIY-YIG domain of UvrC
[31] has been identified as the preferred structure, fold
recognition alignments reported by different methods
exhibited differences. Thus, we used the "FRankenstein's
Monster" approach to simultaneously generate a model of
the protein core and optimize the target-template alignment by generation, evaluation, and recombination of
alternative models [32,33]. This approach has been evaluated as one of the best template-modeling methods in
CASP5 and CASP6; we have also used it to generate accurate models of REases R.SfiI [34] and R.MvaI [35], which
were confirmed by independent crystallographic analyses
[36,37]. The final alignment (Figure 1) indicated that
regions 1–59, 89–103, and 113–121 of R.Hpy188I lack
the counterpart in GIY-YIG domains of known structure
and cannot be modeled "by homology".

Initially, we attempted to fold regions 1–59 (N-terminal
extension), 89–103, and 128–143 (two insertions and a
structure of low sequence similarity to the template) using
ROSETTA (see Methods), while keeping the rest of the
model 'frozen'. However, the resulting models (lowenergy representatives of the 5 largest clusters of decoys)
exhibited relatively poor packing (data not shown). Thus,
we subjected these models to refinement with the
REFINER method [38], using additional restraints on secondary structure, according to the consensus prediction
reported by the meta-server. Recently, we have used this
approach to correctly predict the structures of MiaA, MiaB,

and MiaE enzymes [39]. Among all the refined R.Hpy188I
models, the one with the lowest predicted deviation to the
native structure (root mean square deviation from the
native structure of about 4.25 Å according to the MetaMQAP method, and LGscore of 3.536 i.e. 'very good
model' according to PROQ) has been selected as the final
model (Figure 2) and subjected to further analyses.
Analysis of the R.Hpy188I model
Comparison of the R.Hpy188I model with the much
smaller template structures of GIY-YIG domains of UvrC
and I-TevI homing endonuclease (Figure 2) illustrates the

challenge of modeling, in particular with respect to
regions that have no counterpart in the templates and
have been added de novo. Nonetheless, our model
obtained very good scores, which suggests that it is likely
to be well-folded and that potential errors are unlikely to
occur in the structurally most important regions. Parts
modeled de novo do not form an autonomously folded
(sub)domain. Instead, they pack against the homologymodeled GIY-YIG core. The secondary structure in the
model fulfills the restraints used during model building;
interestingly, a part of the N-terminal loop (residues 6–8)
has formed a small β-sheet with a part of the insertion

and Q169 (Figure 3). In comparison with the GIY-YIG
domains analyzed so far [22], R.Hpy188I and some of its
homologs are the first to exhibit K (K73 for R.Hpy188I) at

(Y of the YIG half motif) and Q (Q169 for R.Hpy188I) at
the position corresponding to N88 of UvrC and N90 of ITevI (Figure 3 and 4).
The mechanism of phosphodiester bond hydrolysis has
not been elucidated experimentally for any protein from
the GIY-YIG superfamily, however a tentative mechanism
has been proposed based on analysis of the crystal structure of a GIY-YIG domain from the UvrC enzyme [31]. In
analogy to that tentative mechanism, the divalent metal
ion may function as Lewis acid, while E149 of R.Hpy188I
may be responsible for metal coordination, K73 (alternatively Y63 or Y88) may function as a general base, and R84
may stabilize the negative charge of the free 5' phosphate

after DNA cleavage. The hydoxyl group of Y29 of UvrC has
been proposed to accept a proton from a nucleophilic
water molecule while simultaneously transferring its proton to the metal-bound hydroxide [31]. The amino group
of K73 might act in a similar way.
Interestingly, among the afore-mentioned residues of the
putative active site, R84 (indicated by an asterisk in Figure
1) is not absolutely conserved in the R.Hpy188I family
alignment. However, in a number of R.Hpy188I
homologs, a corresponding Arg residue (indicated in Figure 1) is found not in the α-helix, but in another loop, on
the opposite side of the active site (positions 104 or 105
in R.Hpy188I). The distributions of R84 and R104/105
are exactly complementary. Modeling of the active site

variants with the Arg residue in these alternative locations
(Figure 4) revealed that the positively charged guanidino
group at the tip of its side chain can assume spatially similar location as in the "orthodox" position. This finding
suggests that R104/105 may fulfill the same role of phosphate binding as R84 despite being attached to a nonhomologous position in the protein backbone. Such a
spatial "migration" of a catalytic residue has not yet been
observed in enzymes from the GIY-YIG superfamily; however, it has been reported for two different residues (Glu/
Asp or Lys/Arg) in a number of nucleases from the PD-(D/
E)XK superfamily [40-42]. Thus, it will be interesting to
test experimentally the functional significance of the
swapped Arg residue in the newly discovered GIY-YIG
enzymes described in this work.
In addition to potential catalytic residues, the model of
R.Hpy188I (Figure 4) revealed a pair of semi-conserved
cysteines (C90 and C101) in the vicinity of the alternative
positions of the afore-mentioned Arg residue (84 and
104/105). The presence of these two Cys residues is
strongly correlated: they co-occur in 11 sequences and a
single member of this pair is present only in 2 sequences.
Both Cys residues are absent from all 12 members of the
R.Hpy188I family that possess a shorter variant of the
intervening loop (Figure 1). It is tempting to speculate
that this pair of Cys residues might have a functional role,
e.g. somehow stabilize the longer variant of the loop that
may be involved in protein-DNA interactions. In the
model they are sufficiently close to each other to form a
disulfide, which is however unlikely to happen in nature
due to the generally reducing environment of the bacterial
cytoplasm, which prevents oxidation of sulfhydryl groups

[43]. Alternatively, if R.Hpy188I forms a dimer like most
of Type II restriction endonucleases, they could form an
intermolecular Zn-bindig site. Unfortunately, our model
cannot provide detailed clues as to the function of C90
and C101, hence we propose them as interesting targets
for experimental characterization.
Analysis of the protein surface with respect to the distribution of sequence conservation and the electrostatic potential (Figure 5) reveals that the surface of R.Hpy188I is
mostly positively charged. The predicted catalytic residues
line up a bottom of a pocket with an overall neutral charge
that is surrounded by a charged rim. Most of that rim
exhibits positive charge (complementary to the negative
charge of DNA backbone), suggesting its possible role in
the DNA binding. However, one side of the rim exhibits
local concentration of negative charge, suggesting potential involvement in interactions with the positively
charged metal ion.
Phylogenetics and genomic context analysis of the
R.Hpy188I family
In order to interpret the structural and genomic features of
different R.Hpy188I homologs in the evolutionary context, we have calculated a phylogenetic tree for the entire
family (Figure 6). It reveals that the R.Hpy188I family
comprises two subfamilies with different characteristic
features (hereafter dubbed R.Hpy188I branch and
R.HpyAORF481P branch after the representative members from REBASE). All the members of the R.Hpy188I
branch contain the phosphate-binding Arg residue at the
"orthodox" 84 position. All of them, except for two
sequences from environmental samples, contain the

aforementioned pair of cysteines. On the other hand,
members of the R.HpyAORF481P branch possess the
phosphate-binding Arg in the "alternative" location (104
or 105) and lack the aforementioned pair of Cys residues
(at positions corresponding to 90 and 101 in R.Hpy188I).
R.Hpy188I and its close homolog R.HpyF17I are the only
members of this protein family for which some function
has been determined [26]. Like virtually all Type II restriction enzymes, their genes are closely associated with genes
encoding a DNA modification methyltransferase with
cognate specificity. Thus, checking whether functionally
uncharacterized members of the R.Hpy188I family are
also genetically linked with DNA methyltransferase
homologs is a convenient way to predict whether they
could constitute a restriction-modification system. Unfortunately, most of R.Hpy188I members had been identified in metagenomic sequences, which typically contain
only short fragments of genomic DNA and may not necessarily include the associated MTase gene together with
the REase gene. Nonetheless, we carried out analysis of
DNA sequence context for R.Hpy188I homologs to identify their neighbors and attempted to predict their cellular
function beyond the putative generic nuclease activity.
It turned out that 19 members of the R.Hpy188I family
are flanked with DNA MTase homologs (Table 1). For the
remaining 6 homologs, the existence of a flanking MTase

gene could not be verified because of incomplete nucleotide sequences that did not extend beyond the REase-like
gene. We identified flanking MTase genes for 9 out of 13
members of the R.Hpy188I branch and 10 out of 12 of the
R.Hpy481P branch (Table 1). Conserved association of
members of the R.Hpy188I family with DNA MTases suggests that all of them are or used to be a functional restriction-modification system.
All but two (7 out of 9) MTases of the R.Hpy188I branch
are closely related to M.Hpy188I (BLAST E-value < 1e-9).
The remaining two members (GIs 136020097 and
140872195) are accompanied by truncated homologs of
M.Hpy99ORF1012P and M.EsaSS1928P. In the case of
136020097 we cannot exclude that a second MTase
closely related to M.Hpy188I is present on the unsequenced side of the REase gene. On the other hand,

[44,45] for reviews of classes and permutations in DNA
MTases). Finally, one member of the R.HpyAORF481P
branch (GI 144033223) is associated with a MTase related
to M.MunI, a member of beta class of N-MTases [46]. The
lack of evident sequence similarity between members of
the three classes of MTases and their different topology

suggests that their ancestors have diverged long before the
divergence of R.Hpy188I and R.HpyAORF481P. This indicates that REases have exchanged their MTase partners at
least twice in the evolution of the Hpy188I family of RM
systems.

Several systems from the HpyAORF481P branch appear to
be associated with another RM system (Table 1). The most
interesting case is observed in the genome of Campylobacter upsaliensis RM3195, where another putative RM system has been inserted into the CupORF237P system
comprising homologs of R.HpyAORF481P and
M.HpyAORF481P. Insertion of a restriction-modification
gene complex into another restriction-modification gene
complex has been already suggested to have occurred in
Helicobacter pylori [47].

Conclusion
Our results reveal that R.Hpy188I and its homologs are
new members of the GIY-YIG superfamily, despite the fact
that they exhibit two deviations from the consensus catalytic motif of the superfamily. First, R.Hpy188I exhibits
Lys instead of Tyr of the "YIG" half-motif. Second, in one
branch of R.Hpy188I family, a presumably catalytic Arg
residue is missing at its typical position in sequence, but
instead is found in a non-homologous position that
nonetheless allows for spatial conservation of the guanidino group potentially involved in phosphate binding. Our
discovery provides important insight into sequence diversity of GIY-YIG nucleases and suggests that other members with unusual active sites might await discovery. In
this context, the theoretical model of R.Hpy188I structure
developed in this work will serve as a convenient guide for
experimental analyses aimed at understanding of the
cleavage mechanism of GIY-YIG nucleases.
Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the R.Hpy188I family can be subdivided into two branches, one comprising
close homologs of R.Hpy188I itself, and the other comprising close homologs of R.HpyAORF481P. Members of
either branch are characterized by a different set of features, including localization of residues predicted to participate in the enzymatic activity and possibly in structural
stability. They are also found associated with MTases from
different classes. Last, but not least, sequence context analyses revealed that in the family of R.Hpy188I homologs,
comprising mostly sequences detected in metagenomics
data, all genes that have appropriate flanking sequences
present in the database, are accompanied by a putative
DNA MTase gene or its fragment, suggesting that they all
are or used to be functional restriction-modification systems.

Methods
Sequence database searches, phylogenetic analyses and
genomic context analyses
Searches of the non-redundant version of current
sequence database (nr) and the database of environmental protein sequences (env_nr) were carried out using PSIBLAST [48], initially separately for nr and env_nr via the
websites of NCBI and MPI-Tuebingen, and finally using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/8/48

the local version (against the combined nr+env_nr database). The final search was carried out with the e-value
threshold of 1e-3. The multiple sequence alignment of
R.Hpy188I and proteins identified in nr+env_nr database
was calculated using MAFFT [49] with default parameters
and refined by hand to ensure that no unwarranted gaps
had been introduced within α-helices and β-strands.
Finally, based on the alignment, the phylogenetic tree was
calculated using MEGA 4.0 [50], employing the Minimum
Evolution method with the JTT model of substitutions.
The stability of individual nodes was calculated using the
bootstrap test (1000 replicates) and confirmed by the
interior branch test. Genomic context analyses were carried out using hmmpfam from the HMMer package [51]
against the PFAM [52] and TIGRFAMs [53] databases with
e-value threshold of 1e-3.
Protein fold prediction
Preliminary structure predictions were carried out via the
HHPRED server [54]. As soon as we identified (by eye)
sub-optimal alignments of R.Hpy188I sequence to GIYYIG nucleases of known structure, we resubmitted it to the
GeneSilico metaserver gateway [55] for secondary structure prediction and fold recognition. Structural predictions were carried out both for the R.Hpy188I sequence
alone (without success), for the alignments of R.Hpy188I
with sequences from the env_nr database (with somewhat
better, but still statistically insignificant results), and
finally for the alignment of the sequences found by
searching the combined nr and env_nr database. It is
important to indicate that different FR servers use completely different scoring systems, with different scales (e.g.
Z-scores, e-values, percent values etc.). Moreover, the
meaning of scores changes over time and may not be the
same as reported in original publications describing the
methods, as servers are modified and databases grow continuously. The comparable reliability thresholds for a
number of servers are estimated e.g. by the Livebench
benchmark [56,57] conducted by Leszek Rychlewski and
co-workers. For the servers, whose results are discussed in
this work, the results of the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis, indicating a rough estimation of the
score below which the servers' predictions become less
reliable are as follows: HHSEARCH [58] probability:
0.629, FFAS [59] score: -8.9 (here the scale is inverted, i.e.
lower scores are better), mGenTHREADER [60] probability: 0.351, FUGUE [61] score: 7.00, INUB [62] score:
25.35, PCONS [63,64] score: 0.6657. These thresholds
correspond to the average servers' scores for their 8th
incorrect predictions, which amount to 5% of incorrect
predictions for all targets in the Livebench test set [65].
The scores were taken from the last Livebench run (Livebench-2008.2), with the sole exception of PCONS, which
has not been included in Livebench-2008.2 and its score
was taken from the CASP7 evaluation [66].

Protein structure modeling
Homology modeling of the catalytic core was carried out
using the "FRankenstein's monster" approach (see [32,33]
for a detailed description). Briefly, preliminary models
were built with MODELLER [67] based on alternative
sequence alignments between R.Hpy188I and template
structures obtained from various fold-recognition servers
with significant scores (all templates used for modeling
were members of the GIY-YIG superfamily). The preliminary models were scored by MetaMQAP [68] and a
"hybrid" model was generated by merging fragments with
consensus alignment with those non-consensus fragments that exhibited best MetaMQAP scores. Additional
evaluations of protein structure quality were carried out
with PROQ [69].

The "hybrid" model obtained was used as a starting point
for folding simulations of the complete sequence using
ROSETTA [70]. The homology-modeled core of
R.Hpy188I (residues 60–88, and 104–112) was completely "frozen" and the search of conformational space
for the variable regions (residues 122–170) was restricted
by the choice of fragments from known crystal structures
that were compatible with the sequence and predicted secondary structure of R.Hpy188I. However, the models
obtained by this protocol exhibited relatively poor packing and unsatisfactory MetaMQAP and PROQ scores (data
not shown). Therefore, the final simulation of R.Hpy188I
folding was conducted by the REFINER method, which
uses a reduced representation of the protein chain and a
statistical potential of mean force to describe intramolecular interactions [38]. REFINER is a real-space version of a
lattice-based algorithm CABS [71] we have earlier successfully combined with the "FRankenstein's Monster"
method in CASP6 [72] or for modeling of R.Eco29kI
enzyme, another member of the GIY-YIG superfamily
[23]. The folding was carried out with restraints on predicted secondary structure. Models generated during the
simulation had their full-atom representation rebuilt and
were scored using PROQ and MetaMQAP. The best-scoring structure (in terms of predicted root mean square deviation with respect to the unknown true structure) was
selected as the final model. Mapping of sequence conservation onto the model was done for the multiple
sequence alignment of the Hpy188I family, initially with
COLORADO3D [73], and ultimately with the ConSurf
server [74].
