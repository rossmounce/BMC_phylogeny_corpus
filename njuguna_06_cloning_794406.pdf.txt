Abstract
Background: Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. However, genetic
information about its pathogenesis is limited at present, due to the lack of a reproducible in vitro cultivation
method. Sequencing of the Plasmodium vivax genome suggested the presence of a homolog of
deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) from P. falciparum, the key regulatory enzyme in the first committed step
of hypusine biosynthesis. DHS is involved in cell proliferation, and thus a valuable drug target for the human
malaria parasite P. falciparum. A comparison of the enzymatic properties of the DHS enzymes between the
benign and severe Plasmodium species should contribute to our understanding of the differences in
pathogenicity and phylogeny of both malaria parasites.
Results: We describe the cloning of a 1368 bp putative deoxyhypusine synthase gene (dhs) sequence from
genomic DNA of P. vivax PEST strain Salvador I (Accession number AJ549098) after touchdown PCR. The
corresponding protein was expressed and functionally characterized as deoxyhypusine synthase by
determination of its specific activity and cross-reactivity to human DHS on a Western blot.
The putative DHS protein from P. vivax displays a FASTA score of 75 relative to DHS from rodent malaria
parasite, P. yoelii, and 74 relative to that from the human parasite, P. falciparum strain 3D7. The ORF
encoding 456 amino acids was expressed under control of IPTG-inducible T7 promoter, and expressed as
a protein of approximately 50 kDa (theoretically 52.7 kDa) in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells. The N-terminal
histidine-tagged protein was purified by Nickel-chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing
conditions. DHS with a theoretical pI of 6.0 was present in both eluate fractions. The specific enzymatic
activity of DHS was determined as 1268 U/mg protein. The inhibitor, N-guanyl-1, 7-diaminoheptane
(GC7), suppressed specific activity by 36-fold. Western blot analysis performed with a polyclonal antihuman DHS antibody revealed cross-reactivity to DHS from P. vivax, despite an amino acid identity of 44%
between the proteins.
Conclusion: We identify a novel DHS protein in the more benign malaria parasite,P. vivax, on the basis
of specific enzymatic activity, cross-reactivity with a polyclonal antibody against human DHS, and amino
acid identity with DHS homologs from the rodent malaria parasite, P. yoelii, and human P. falciparum strains.

Background
Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed human
malaria parasite and infects 70–80 million individuals per
year worldwide. In most malaria endemic regions, P. falciparum and P. vivax infections coexist, and mixed infections
are prevalent. Interactions between the two parasites
determine the outcome of the disease and future therapeutic perspectives with regard to infection control. However, there is limited knowledge about the biology of the
P. vivax parasite at present, due to the lack of an in vitro
culture system.
To accelerate drug discovery for the more benign P. vivax,
genome sequencing of the malaria parasite was performed
to facilitate its annotation [1]. A transcriptome approach
[2] was applied to study gene expression in the mixed
erythrocytic stages of a P. vivax field isolate. Transcribed
genes (30%) displayed significant homology to those
involved in metabolism and ribosomal proteins consistent with the trophozoite stage of the field strain.
Over recent years, increasing resistance of malaria parasites to therapy, and in particular, re-emergence of P. vivax
infections, has increased the need to develop strategies of
identifying novel drug targets. The polyamine pathway
has been exploited for antiparasitic chemotherapy. Our
research is focused on the formation of the novel amino
acid hypusine, which involves two steps. In the first step,
deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) [EC 1.1.1.249] transfers
an aminobutyl moiety from the triamine spermidine to a
specific lysine residue in the eIF-5A (eukaryotic initiation
factor 5A) precursor protein to form deoxyhypusine. In
the second step, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DHH) [EC
1.14.9929] completes hypusine biosynthesis through
hydroxylation. Deoxyhypusine modification is important
for the viability of eukaryotic cells [3]. We have recently
cloned two genes involved in hypusine biosynthesis from
the malaria parasites P. falciparum and P. vivax, specifically, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (EIF-5A). To elucidate the phylogenetic
relationship between deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) proteins from both parasitic species, we clone the putative dhs
gene from P. vivax, and determine its specific enzymatic
activity.

Results
Nucleotide sequence of a putative dhs gene from P. vivax
The DHS amino acid sequence of P. falciparum strain NF
54 [4] was used to screen a library of expressed sequence
(EST) tags from P. vivax strain PEST Salvador I. Based on
the 5' and 3' ends of dhs, two primers were constructed to
amplify the 1368 bp sequence encoding 456 amino acids
from the genomic DNA of Plasmodium vivax strain PEST
Salvador I. The purified fragment was subcloned into pSTBlue-1AccepTor vector, and sequenced (accession number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/91

AJ549098). The dhs gene has an AT content of 52%, and a
comparable GC content of 48%.
The deduced amino acid sequence of the P. vivax protein
was aligned with different putative DHS sequences from
other Plasmodium species, i. e., P. falciparum Dd2 and 3D7
strains (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), rodent malaria parasite P.
yoelii (Fig. 1, lane 3), and Anopheles gambiae (Fig 1, lane 6).
The P. vivax DHS amino acid sequence displayed FASTA
scores of 74 and 73 relative to the P. falciparum strains
Dd2 and 3D7, respectively. Notably, P. vivax DHS exhibits
66% amino acid identity between positions 1–236 and
91% identity between positions 276–443 with the P. falciparum Dd2 strain.
There are several gaps in the amino acid stretches at positions 103, 240, 257 and 442 in the P. vivax DHS protein,
which are absent in the P. falciparum homolog (numbering refers to the amino acid sequence from P. vivax). The
P. vivax DHS protein has a FASTA score of 75 to its
homolog from the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii, while
amino acid identity to the human DHS protein (Fig. 1,
lane5) is only 44%. The lowest FASTA score of 49 was
obtained between P. vivax and Anopheles gambiae DHS
proteins (Fig. 1, lane 6)
Expression of P. vivax DHS protein in E. coli cells and
affinity purification
The purified P. vivax DHS protein has a calculated molecular size of 50 kDa (theoretically 52.7 kDa), and a pI value
of 6.0. Initially, primers#1 and #2 containing NdeI and
BamHI restriction sites, respectively, were used for amplification of dhs, which was cloned into the pET15b vector
for protein expression. Protein extracts prepared after 4 h
of induction with IPTG exhibited a prominent band of
approximately 50 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A, lane
3). In contrast, no band was detectable in the uninduced
control culture (Fig. 2A, lane 2.) The recombinant protein
was expressed with a six-histidine tag at the amino-terminus, allowing purification by Nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
(Fig. 2). The protein was detected at 50 kDa in both eluate
fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7).
Modification of P. vivax eIF-5A precursor protein by P.
vivax deoxyhypusine synthase
For the deoxyhypusine synthase assay, the purified eIF-5A
precursor protein and DHS enzyme from P. vivax were
applied [5]. The incorporation of radioactively labeled
spermidine into the substrate precursor protein was
assayed using a filter paper assay [14]. Purified samples
were immediately used to determine specific enzymatic
DHS activity. The average specific enzymatic activity from
two experiments was 1268 U/mg protein suggesting that
DHS protein from P. vivax is able to modify the eIF-5A

Reduced in vitro susceptibility [6] of field isolates from
Plasmodium falciparum strains to artemeter derivatives is
an alarm signal necessitating the rapid deployment of
drug combinations. There is an urgent need to elucidate
the genome of human malaria parasites. In 2000, after the
completion of the P. falciparum genome project, the
sequencing of expressed sequence tags (EST) from the
human malaria parasite P. vivax of Salvador PEST strain I,
isolated from a malaria patient from Thailand, was initiated. No information about this parasite is available to
date. In contrast to P. falciparum, it infects reticulocytes,
which are young immature erythrocytes. Due to the lack
of a reproducible continuous in vitro culture system [7],
detailed molecular analyses were not possible.
Recently, we exploited the biosynthetic pathway of the
generation of the novel amino acid, hypusine, in the
human malaria parasite P. falciparum [8]. Two proteins,
i.e., DHS and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A)
involved in the formation of deoxyhypusine, the first
committed step in the hypusine biosynthetic pathway, are
potential new drug targets in Plasmodium falciparum [9].
To identify the phylogenetic homologs of the dhs gene in
different Plasmodium species, a library of Plasmodium vivax
expressed sequence tags was screened for a DHS homolog
from P. falciparum. The putative DHS sequence from P.
vivax is encoded by a 1386 bp nucleic acid sequence, with
the most significant FASTA scores of 75 to P. yoelii and 74
to P. falciparum strain 3D7. These results are in agreement
with initial comparative analyses of the P. vivax genome
with the other related Plasmodium species, which revealed
significant conservation of gene synteny between the different species within chromosome cores, in contrast to
subtelomeric regions displaying reduced homology [10].

P. vivax DHS displays striking amino acid sequence identity to its homolog from P. falciparum. Notably, 89%
amino acid identity is observed between P. vivax DHS protein (Fig. 1, lane 4) and the human homolog between residues 290–308 (human DHS numbering) (Fig. 1, lane 5).
However, several gaps appear in the P. vivax protein
sequence at positions 103, 240, 257 and 442, which are
absent in the Plasmodium falciparum homolog.
The most significant differences between human and Plasmodium DHS homologs are evident in the spermidine
binding site (residues 243–342, human DHS numbering), although the active site is highly conserved. The
active site includes a conserved region of six amino acids
from Glu 323 to Lys 329 (human DHS numbering) (Fig.
1) [11,12]. Asp 316, one of the charged amino acids at the
bottom of the active site tunnel responsible for binding to
spermidine and the GC7 inhibitor, is highly conserved in
DHS proteins in Plasmodium [13]. Moreover, in both DHS
proteins, Gly 314 is within hydrogen-binding distance of
the guanidinium group [13].
The NAD-binding site (positions 105–342, human DHS
numbering) is strongly conserved between the different
Plasmodium species and their human homologs. However,
a stretch of 85 amino acids mainly comprising asparagine
in this site is missing in DHS homologs from Plasmodium.
To confirm the function of P. vivax DHS, we determined
its specific enzymatic activity in modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-5A, by incorporation
of the aminobutyl-moiety of 14[-C]-spermidine as a substrate (Table 1, column A). Specific enzymatic activity was
determined as 1268 U/mg protein, which was 9-fold less
than that calculated by Molitor and colleagues (2004)
[14], who used human DHS protein for the modification
of eIF-5A from P. falciparum. In a control experiment with
water instead of DHS from P. vivax, no specific enzymatic
activity was detected.
In a parallel inhibition experiment, the most commonly
used competitive inhibitor of DHS, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7) (Table 1, column C), was employed.
GC7 inhibits DHS in a competitive manner by binding to

its active site [15], as observed in crystallized form II that
was recently obtained for the complex of DHS and GC7.
This inhibitor reduced specific enzymatic activity by 36fold (Table 1, column C).
While the amino acid identity between human and Plasmodium vivax DHS is only 44%, we detected cross-reactivity between a polyclonal antibody raised against the
human DHS enzyme and the expressed Nickel chelatepurified protein (Fig. 2B, lane 1) from P. vivax, suggesting
that the anti-DHS antibody recognizes specific epitopes
present in both proteins.

Conclusion
The putative P. vivax DHS protein consists of 456 amino
acids with significant FASTA scores of 75 to P. yoelii and 74
to P. falciparum strain 3D7 DHS proteins. A specific DHS
enzymatic activity assay with 14C-labeled spermidine as
the substrate and inhibition by N-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7) confirmed functional activity. Moreover,
the DHS protein from P. vivax cross-reacted with a polyclonal antibody against anti-human DHS. Further biochemical characterization analyses of the P. vivax DHS
protein are currently underway.

Expression and purification of DHS protein from P. vivax
by Nickel-chelate affinity chromatography
After purification (Quiaex), the 1386 bp fragment was
subcloned into petBlue-1 vector (Novagene), and transformed for expression in Tuner™ (DE3) pLacI cells (Novagen). Insertion of the open reading frame in the correct
orientation was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech,
Munich). Cells with an optical density of 0.6–1.0 at
OD600 were resuspended in 3 ml of fresh Luria Bertani (LB
medium) supplemented with 0.5–1.0 % glucose and 100
μg/ml ampicillin were used to inoculate 100 ml LBmedium with the same concentration of supplements at
37°C until OD600 0.5–1.0. Prior to induction, cells were
split into two 50 ml cultures. One culture was supplemented with 500 μl of 100 mM IPTG, while the other
served as the uninduced control. Protein extracts were prepared 4 h after induction by centrifugation, lysed, heated
at 100°C, and run on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel at
100 V. The 10 kDa protein ladder (Gibco BRL) and RainBow Marker were used as molecular weight markers.

P. vivax DHS protein was expressed under control of the
T7-inducible promoter in pET15b vector (Novagene),
which allows purification of 6xHis-tagged proteins. PSTBlue 1 AccepTorVector (Novagene) containing the dhs
gene was used as a template for subcloning the full-length
dhs sequence by amplification with expression primers
(forward 1# 5'-AAC CCC ATA TGA CGA ACC AAG GGG
CTT TT-3' containing an Nde I restriction site (underlined)
and a Bam HI restriction site (underlined; reverse 2 # 5'AAAA GGA TCC TCA CCT GAG CTG CGC TTC-3'), respectively. Protein purification was performed by Nickel
chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen).

protein extracts were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (12 mM Tris, 96 mM glycine and
20% methanol). The primary polyclonal antibody against
human DHS protein was kindly provided by MH. Park
(Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, National Institute of
Health, Bethesda). The polyclonal human anti-DHS antibody was diluted (1: 800) in TBS (10 mM Tris, 15 mM
NaCl) buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and
washed twice with TBS-Tween buffer. The primary antibody was detected with a secondary immunopure rabbit
anti-mouse- IgG- alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce)
at a dilution of 1: 10.000. The membrane was washed
with TBS-Tween buffer, and detected with nitroblue tetrazolium phosphate (5% in 70% dimethylformamide) and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (5% in 100%
dimethylformamide) in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100
mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2).

Enzymatic activity assay of deoxyhypusine synthase
expressed from P. vivax
Deoxyhypusine synthase activity was measured by the
incorporation of 40 mM [14-C] spermidine into eIF-5A
precursor protein. A total volume of 50 μl consisted of
83.3 mM Nickel affinity-purified eIF-5A, NAD+ 1 mM, 0.1
M glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol and
Nickel-affinity purified DHS enzyme (1–5 μg). DHS activity assay was performed after a second buffer exchange
step on a NAP TM5 column (Amersham Pharmacia).
Assays were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The reaction was
terminated by adding 10 ml of 1 M potassium phosphate,
pH 6.3, with 60 mM spermidine. The incubation mixture
was absorbed onto a Whatman No.3 MM paper disc, and
developed using the method of Sasaki et al. (1996) [16].
Western blot analysis of DHS from P. vivax
Western blot analysis was performed using the sandwich
method in a semi-dry transfer electroblotting apparatus
(Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 25 V. After 3 h of induction,
