Abstract
Background: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are members of the superfamily of Zn2+
dependent extracellular or membrane-bound endopeptidases which have been implicated to play
critical roles in vertebrate development and human pathogenesis. A number of MMP genes have
been found to be upregulated in some or all organs during frog metamorphosis, suggesting that
different MMPs may have different functions in various organs/tissues. The recent advances in EST
(expressed sequence tag) sequencing and the completion of the genome of Xenopus (X.) tropicalis
prompted us to systematically analyze the existence of MMPs in the Xenopus genome.
Results: We examined X. laevis and X. tropicalis ESTs and genomic sequences for MMPs and
obtained likely homologs for 20 out of the 25 MMPs known in higher vertebrates. Four of the five
missing MMPs, i.e. MMPs 8, 10, 12 and 27, were all encoded on human Chromosome 11 and the
other missing MMP, MMP22 (a chicken MMP), was also absent in human genome. In addition, we
identified several novel MMPs which appears to be derived from unique duplications over
evolution, are present in the genomes of both Xenopus species.
Conclusion: We identified the homologs of most of the mammalian MMPs in Xenopus and
discovered a number of novel MMPs. Our results suggest that MMP genes undergo dynamic
changes over evolution. It will be of interest in the future to investigate whether MMP expression
and functions during vertebrate development are conserved. The sequence information reported
here should facilitate such an endeavor in the near future.

Background
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are Zn2+ dependent
extracellular or membrane-bound proteinases with overlapping substrate specificities [1-6]. They are capable of
cleaving proteinaceous components of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) as well as non-ECM proteins [2-5,7,8], thus
affecting cell fate through modifications of cell's microenvironment. MMPs have a similar domain structure that
includes a prepeptide for secretion, a propeptide to main-

tain latency, and a catalytic domain, featured by the signature sequence HEFGHXXH, for substrate cleavage. The
catalytic domain binds to a Zn2+ ion through the threehistidine residues within the signature sequence to form
the catalytic center [5,9,10]. The propeptide contains a
highly conserved sequence, PRCGXPD, the so called
"cysteine switch", within which the cysteine residue interacts with the catalytic Zn2+ to maintain enzyme latency
[11]. Most MMPs are secreted as latent enzymes and procPage 1 of 18

essed to the active forms upon the removal of the propeptide domain through various mechanisms. Other MMPs,
such as stromelysin 3 (ST3, also known as MMP11),
MMP21, MMP23, MMP28, and membrane type MMPs
(MT-MMPs) are activated intracellularly through the
removal of the propeptide domain by furin, a Golgi
enzyme [3,12,13].
MMP expression and distribution have long implicated
that MMPs play important roles in many physiological
processes including embryonic development, angiogenesis, tissue resorption and remodeling, and pathological
events such as tumor invasion and arthritis [8,14-22]. In
vitro and cell culture studies have provided strong evidence to show that MMPs can regulate cell fate and behavior by remodeling the ECM. On the other hand, increasing
evidences indicate that MMPs are capable of cleaving nonECM extracellular or membrane-bound proteins, suggesting the existence of multiple pathways for MMPs to regulate cells. Despite the extensive in vitro and cell culture
studies, the in vivo functions of MMPs are poorly understood. Surprisingly, with a few exceptions, transgenic
overexpression of MMPs and MMP knockouts in mouse
have little or weak phenotypes on mouse development
[23,24]. This appears to be at least in part due to the
redundancy in MMP expression and function. These findings emphasize the need for further in vivo studies by
using different model systems.
Frog metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to study
MMP function during postembryonic development in
vertebrates. This process is totally dependent on the presence of thyroid hormone (TH) and mimics the postembryonic period from a few months before to several
months after birth in humans [25-27]. During metamorphosis, dramatic tissue-specific remodeling occurs
through TH-regulated cell fate changes. These include
complete absorption of the gill and the tail, de novo generation of the limbs, and remodeling of most other organs
such as the intestine. For example, in the intestine, the larval epithelial cells die through apoptosis and adult epithelial progenitor cells, which may be derived from dedifferentiated larval epithelial cells, proliferate and eventually differentiate to form a multiply folded adult epithelium [28-31]. Numerous studies have shown that the
metamorphic effects of TH are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors, which control a gene regulation cascade
by regulating the transcription of the so-called direct THresponse genes. These direct response genes in turn affect
the expression of indirect TH-response genes to eventually
regulate cell fate and behavior during metamorphosis. Initial isolation and characterization of TH-response genes
revealed that Xenopus (X.) laevis ST3 (MMP11) and collagenase 3 (MMP13), and Rana catesbeiana collagenase 1
(MMP1) are regulated by TH during metamorphosis. Sub-

sequent studies have found that essentially all MMPs analyzed so far are regulated by TH in at least some organs/
tissues during metamorphosis [32-48]. Among them, ST3
and MMP9-TH in X. laevis and collagenase 1 in Rana catesbeiana have been shown to be direct response genes with
thyroid hormone response elements present in their promoters [43,49,50]. Furthermore, in vitro organ culture
analysis and in vivo analyses have provided strong evidence for the participation of MMPs in metamorphosis
[40,41,51-54]. For example, we have demonstrated that
ST3 is required for TH-induced ECM remodeling, intestinal larval epithelial apoptosis as well as adult epithelial
cell migration in organ cultures and that transgenic overexpression of ST3 alone at premetamorphic stages, e.g.,
stage 54, can induce larval epithelial apoptosis and ECM
remodeling in the intestine in the absence of TH [52,53].
These functional studies directly proved the function of
ST3 as first suggested based on expression analyses. Since
all MMPs analyzed so far are regulated by TH during metamorphosis, it is pertinent to ask whether the rest of the
MMPs are also regulated by TH and whether different
MMPs have different functions during metamorphosis in
different organs/tissues.
As an initiative to begin to address these important issues,
we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of MMP genes
in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis through a bioinformatic
approach by making use of the genome sequence information for X. tropicalis and cDNA sequences available for
X. laevis and tropicalis genes from the NIH Frog Initiatives
Program. We demonstrate that essentially all mammalian
MMPs have homologs in Xenopus, although the homologs
for some MMPs cannot be assigned with certainty. Furthermore, we have discovered a number of novel MMPs
and duplications that are uniquely present in the amphibian genome.

Results and discussion
Bioinformatic search for Xenopus MMPs
Many X. laevis MMPs were previously cloned
[32,33,39,41,43,44,46,47,55-58]. These cDNA sequences
were used to search for other MMPs in the public EST
database at the NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and
the Gene Index Project in Computational Biology and
Function Genomics Laboratory http://compbio.dfci.har
vard.edu/tgi/. Putative MMP protein sequences that were
derived from the retrieved cDNA sequences were pooled
and analyzed on a phylogenetic tree. Closely related
entries were compared pair-wise by using MacVector
(Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and redundant sequences
were removed. The resulting X. laevis MMPs were listed in
Table 1 (see Additional file 1 for their nucleotide
sequences). Compared to human MMPs, some X. laevis
MMPs were missing from the list and some others had
highly homologous duplicates, likely due to the pseu-

#Comparison of X. laevis and X. tropicalis MMPs. Pair-wise comparisons were done to obtain the percent of identities between the MMPs from the

dotetraploid X. laevis genome. The missing ones could be
due to either the absence of the genes in Xenopus genome
or incomplete sequence data available. Thus, we also
searched and analyzed the cDNA sequences for MMPs in
the highly related species, X. tropicalis. We aligned the
cDNA sequences of X. laevis or tropicalis MMPs to the JGI
X. tropicalis genomic scaffolds http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Xentr4/Xentr4.home.html (Table 1). When needed, we
also used human MMP sequences to search the X. tropicalis
genome database to ensure a complete search of the
genome.
Pair-wise sequence comparison (not shown) and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) allowed us to assign most of the
Xenopus MMPs to the corresponding human homologs
(except that chicken MMP22 was also used since MMP22
is absent in human [57]) (where an MMP name had been

previously assigned in the databases, we kept the same
name for consistency. As we discussed below, some of
these MMPs may not be the true homologs of the human
MMPs as currently assigned). As shown in table 1, all X.
laevis MMPs have a corresponding homolog in X. tropicalis
and the homologs are highly conserved with over 80%
amino acid sequence identities between X. laevis and X.
tropicalis. These include a duplicated gelatinase B
(MMP9TH) that is absent in mouse and human genome.
As X. laevis is a pseudotetraploid organism, it is not surprising that some MMPs (MMP1, MMP7, MMP13,
MMP14, MMP24, MMP28) have duplicate copies in X.
laevis but only one in X. tropicalis. Only four X. tropicalis
MMPs (MMP N2, MMP N4, MMP N5, and MMP N6, see
below for more on these MMPs) have no available
homologs in X. laevis yet, likely due to incomplete cDNA
sequence information available for X. laevis.

Xenopus MMPs with known human homologs
Phylogenetic (Fig. 1) and pair-wise sequence (table 2)
analyses suggest that the following human MMPs have
true homologs in Xenopus genome: MMP2, MMP9,
MMP11, MMP13, MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17,
MMP19, MMP20, MMP21, MMP23, MMP24, MMP25,
MMP28. The homologous human and X. tropicalis MMPs
cluster together in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) and share
highest sequence identities with each other than with any
other MMPs (one exception to this is X. tropicalis MMP25,
which shares similar homologies with human MMP17
and MMP25. Since the structurally related X. tropicalis
MMP17 share 70% homology with the human MMP17
but only 47% homology with the human MMP25, we
assigned this MMP as X. tropicalis MMP25) (table 2). In
addition, the homologous MMPs have similar lengths and
domain organizations (data not shown).
Likely Xenopus homologs of human MMPs
The homologs of the rest of human MMPs could not be
easily identified based on sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. These MMPs may have corresponding
homologs in Xenopus but their sequences have diverged
significantly that it is difficult to match the human and
Xenopus counterparts. For these MMPs, we kept the putative names for any Xenopus MMPs with previously
assigned names in the public databases or assigned the
names as described below.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/81

a homolog of X. laevis MMP18 (Table 1). X. laevis MMP18
is a known collagenase [42], suggesting that these three
MMPs are collagenases. Apart from the typical MMP
domains (i.e., the signal peptide, the conserved zinc binding motif characteristic of MMPs, and the conserved
cysteine-switch domain within the propeptide), X. tropicalis MMP1, as well as X. laevis MMP1A and 1B, contains a
16 aa proline-rich motif after the catalytic domain that
distinguishes collagenases from stromelysins, although
the X. tropicalis MMP N4 and N5 have deletions within the
region (X. tropicalis MMP N5 lacks the entire hinge
domain but has the intact catalytic and hemopexin
domain, a characteristic similar to that of the MMP21s)
(Fig. 2). These MMPs share less than 60% identity with X.
laevis collagenases MMP13 and MMP18. In addition, they
are also three amino acids shorter than the human MMP1
at the C- terminus (Fig. 2), just like the X. laevis MMP13
and MMP18. Taken together, these MMP genes are likely
X. tropicalis collagenases, but it is possible that the X. tropicalis MMP1 is not the true homolog of human MMP1,
especially considering that the MMP1 from another
amphibian species, Rana catesbeiana, is much more
homologous to human MMP1, although much shorter,
compared to Xenopus MMP1 (Fig. 1) [42].

MMP1
There were two entries for X. laevis MMP1 (GenBank
accession # BC054233 and BC084836), encoding two
closely related MMPs of 466 amino acids (aa) that are
90% identical (data not shown). Alignment of these X.
laevis MMP1s (MMP1A and MMP1B) to the X. tropicalis
genomic scaffolds showed significant homology at three
different loci on the Scaffold_119 (Note that the X. tropicalis genomic sequence is not complete and the individual
sequences are assembled into scaffolds instead of individual chromosomes). The putative cDNA sequences were
derived from these loci and used to deduce the protein
sequences of three related MMPs. Among these three putative MMP genes, the best-matched one has 87% identities
with X. laevis MMP1s and has the same length; it was
therefore named as X. tropicalis MMP1 (Table 1). The
other two were tentatively named as X. tropicalis MMP N4
and N5 (Table 1).

MMP3
MMP3 and MMP10, also referred to as stromelysin 1 and
2, respectively, are MMPs that have quite broad substrate
specificities and were originally described as proteoglycanases [59-62]. Neither Xenopus MMP3 nor MMP10 has
been characterized. A putative MMP deduced from a
cDNA entry for each Xenopus species (GenBank accession
number: BC077966 of X. laevis clone and
NM_001030331 of X. tropicalis clone) structurally resembles MMP3 and MMP10 (Fig. 3). Similar to human MMP3
and MMP10, the Xenopus MMP has an insertion (8 aa for
the X. tropicalis MMP and 14 aa for the X. laevis MMP) in
the 16 aa proline-rich motif after the catalytic domain
whose integrity is important for collagenase activity (Fig.
3). This suggests that the Xenopus MMP is likely a stromelysin. The two Xenopus homologs share 84% identity,
although the X. laevis one is 45 aa shorter than X. tropicalis
MMP3 at the N-terminus, likely due to incomplete 5'-end
cDNA sequence. Thus, the Xenopus MMPs are homologs of
each other and are tentatively named as MMP3 since they
are slightly more similar to human MMP3 than MMP10
(Table 2).

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that X. tropicalis MMP1,
MMP N4 and N5 cluster together with MMP N4 and N5
more closely related to each other than to MMP1 (Fig. 1).
These MMPs are related to several human MMP subfamilies including collagenases (MMP1 and 8) and
stromelysins (MMP3 and 10), etc. The MMP that is most
closely related to these three MMPs is X. tropicalis MMP18,

MMP23
MMP23 is characterized by the presence of a furin activation site, a type II transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, and a unique truncated C-terminal domain unrelated
to the hemopexin domain found in other MMPs, and it
lacks a typical prepeptide [63-66]. There are two reported
MMP23, MMP23A and MMP23B, in human that are

Sequence comparison of MMP1 with MMP N4 and
MMP N5. X. tropicalis (Xt) MMP1, N4 and N5, and X. laevis
(Xl) MMP1A and 1B were aligned with human (h) MMP1 for
comparison. The sequences of the putative signal peptide are
underlined. The predicted cleavage site between the signal
peptide and the propeptide is indicated by an arrow, and the
predicted cleavage site between the propeptide and the catalytic domain is indicated by solid arrowhead. The conserved
sequence in the propeptide involved in the "cysteine-switch"
is boxed, and the zinc-binding motif within the bracketed catalytic domain is indicated by a solid line on top. The three
conserved histidine residues in the zinc binding motif and the
conserved methionine residue of the nearby "Met-turn" are
indicated by stars below. The 16 aa sequence (shadowed) at
the end of the catalytic domain (bracketed) indicates the
region whose integrity is important for collagenase specificity
for collagen. An insertion of 8 or more aa within this region
at the site indicated by an arrowhead is characteristics of
stromelysins. The arrow marked "C" shows the beginning of
the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. A dot indicates an
identical amino acid as the corresponding one in Xt-MMP1.
Gaps (dashes) are introduced to optimize the alignment
among proteins. Note that MMP N4 and N5 contain internal
deletions in the linker region between the catalytic domain
and C-terminal hemopexin-like domain.

Scaffold_132. X. tropicalis MMP23 and MMP N6 differ
from each other at both the cDNA and protein sequence
levels, unlike the two human MMP23 genes (note that
there is only one MMP23 in the mouse genome).
Sequence comparison showed that X. laevis MMP23, X.
tropicalis MMP23 and MMP N6 have the same features of
human MMP23, although there is a sequence gap in X.
tropicalis MMP23 (Fig. 4), possibly due to incomplete
genomic sequence information (see Additional file 1).
The Xenopus MMP 23, MMP N6, and human MMP23 cluster together and are away from all other MMPs (Fig. 1)
with the MMP23 sharing 60% identity between Xenopus
and human, similar to other homologous MMPs (table
2).
encoded by two genes, likely due to a very recent, partial
duplication at Chromosome 1p36.3 [65]. Human
MMP23A and B are identical in amino acid sequences and
thus both are referred to as MMP23 here. Two overlapping
EST entries (CD302225 and CD302813) encode a putative X. laevis MMP23 of 381aa. Sequence search of the X.
tropicalis genome identified a putative X. tropicalis MMP23
on Scaffold_414. There was no EST entry representing the
X. tropicalis MMP23. However, two X. tropicalis EST entries
(CX344815 and CX344816) composed of cDNA
sequences that together encode another putative MMP
related to MMP23 (tentatively named as MMP N6). These
cDNA sequences aligned on to X. tropicalis genomic

MMP21
MMP21 was first cloned in X. laevis [67]. It has since been
found to be present in other vertebrates including human.
The common features of this MMP across different species, in addition to those characteristics of MMPs, are a
putative furin cleavage site between the propetide and the
catalytic domain, a relative long insertion (20~44 aa)
between the PRCGXPD cysteine switch motif and the
furin cleavage site (RXKR), and a unique cysteine residue
in the catalytic domain (Fig. 5). The putative X. tropicalis
MMP21 composes of 604 aa and shares 92% and 59%
identities with the X. laevis and human MMP21, respectively (Tables 1 and 2).

Interestingly, sequence search also revealed a cDNA entry
(TC84199), composed of X. tropicalis ESTs DR836290 and
CX386748, that encodes a putative MMP of 524 aa. This
MMP is highly homologous to X. tropicalis MMP21 and is
tentatively named as X. tropicalis MMP N3 (Fig. 5). In
addition, 4 highly homologous X. laevis ESTs, BG234242,
BU905338, CB558404, and CF547511, were also found
to constitute a putative cDNA sequence encoding a
homolog of X. tropicalis MMP N3 (see Additional file 1,
Table 1, and Fig. 5). The X. tropicalis MMP N3 is located on
the X. tropicalis genomic Scaffold_508, from which the rest
5'-end cDNA sequence was predicted. The putative X. tropicalis MMP N3 encodes a predicted protein of 627 aa. The
N-terminal sequence of X. laevis MMP N3 is still missing
in the databases. Sequence comparison clearly showed
that MMP N3 is highly homologous to MMP21 and is
likely derived from a gene duplication event (Fig. 5). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that Xenopus
MMP21 clusters with human MMP21 and is closely
related to MMP N3.
MMP7 and 26
MMP7 and MMP26 are the smallest MMPs known and
have no hemopexin domain at their C-terminus [62,6870]. X. laevis MMP7 was previously reported (GenBank
accession # AF573380) and found to be expressed specifically in tissue resident macrophages [56]. Bioinformatic
search revealed a closely related X. laevis cDNA clone
(GenBank accession # BC056040) encoding a protein of
259 aa vs. 252 aa for X. laevis MMP7. These two X. laevis
MMPs shared 85% identities in amino acid sequences and
82% identities in nucleotide sequences, and therefore, are
likely duplicated MMP7 genes in the pseudotetraploid
genome. We designated them as MMP7A (GenBank accession # AF573380) and 7B (GenBank accession #
BC056040), respectively. Both X. laevis MMP7A and 7B
aligned to X. tropicalis Scaffold_119 at the location that
encodes a X. tropicalis cDNA (GenBank accession #
NM_001005043). Thus, this X. tropicalis cDNA represents
X. tropicalis MMP7. X. tropicalis MMP7 is 259 aa in length
and highly homologous to X. laevis MMP7A/B (Tables 1
and Fig. 6).

catalytic domain is in bold and indicated with a black diamond
below. Note that the sequence for Xl-MMP N3 is incomplete

In addition to the MMP7 genes, the X. laevis cDNA clone
MGC69070 (GenBank accession # BC056080) and X.
tropicalis cDNA clone MGC108008 (GenBank accession #
NM_001032335) also encode a small MMP each (258 aa
and 261 aa, respectively). Like MMP7, both proteins
lacked the hemopexin domain (Fig. 6). They share 88%
identities with each other and the X. tropicalis gene is also
located on X. tropicalis genomic Scaffold_119. These two
proteins are closely related to X. laevis MMP7A/B and X.
tropicalis MMP7 on the phylogenetic tree and thus are tentatively named as X. laevis MMP26 and X. tropicalis

MMP26, respectively. (It should be pointed out that it is
difficult to assign with certainty which of the Xenopus gene
is the homolog of human MMP7 and which is that of
human MMP26. For consistency, we kept Xenopus MMP7
for the previously published sequence [56]).
Surprisingly, an additional X. tropicalis clone
(IMAGE7719439, EST# CX982585 and CX982586) was
also found to encode a similar MMP lacking the hemopexin domain. The cDNA sequence had two in-frame stop
codons after the 3'-end of the coding sequence (see Additional file 1) and another independent EST sequence (EST
#CX979196) overlapped with this region with 100%
identity (data not shown). Thus, this gene represents a
novel MMP that is structurally similar to MMP7 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/81

MMP26. It is tentatively named as X. tropicalis MMP N2
(Fig. 6). X tropicalis MMP N2 is also located on X. tropicalis
Scaffold_119 in between MMP7 and MMP26, suggesting
that it was derived from a gene duplication event.
Novel Xenopus MMPs
Gelatinases
Sequence analysis revealed the existence of an alternatively spliced form of X. laevis gelatinase A (MMP2)
(MMP2asv, Fig. 7). This alternatively spliced MMP2 transcript encodes a MMP that lacks most of the catalytic
domain, including the zinc binding motif, and part of the
C-terminal hemopexin domain. To date, no such spliced
form of MMP2 has been reported for other vertebrate species, including X. tropicalis.

In addition, there are two MMPs in both X. laevis and X.
tropicalis that are highly homologous to MMP9 or gelatinase B, MMP9 and MMP9TH, respectively [43] (Tables 1
and 2), and both cluster with human MMP9 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Xenopus MMP9 and MMP9TH have
all the features characteristic of a gelatinase (data not
shown). Since only one MMP9 genes have been found in
other vertebrates, MMP9TH and MMP9 represent a
unique duplication in Xenopus.
MMP N1
The assembly of a group of overlapping X. laevis ESTs (EST
# BE509380, BJ032306, BG813136, EB469763,
EC276067, BX852582, BJ047339, and BG578455) led to
a cDNA (see Additional file 1) encoding a protein of 562
aa that lacks the N-terminus and shares low levels of
homologies with others MMPs but has all the characteristics of an MMP (Fig. 8 and data not shown). Similarly, the
homologous X. tropicalis ESTs could be assembled into a
cDNA encoding a full length MMP of 573 aa that is 90%
homologous to the X. laevis counterpart (Fig. 8 and table
1). This X. tropicalis MMP has less than 40% homology to
any of human MMPs and represents a novel frog MMP
tentatively named as X. tropicalis MMP N1 (Fig. 8 and
Table 2). Its counterpart in X. laevis is therefore named as
X. laevis MMP N1 (Fig. 8 and Table 1).

While the Xenopus MMP N1 has all the domains typical of
an MMP, there are some differences distinguishing it from
other MMPs. First, both X. laevis and X. tropicalis MMP N1
had a "cysteine-switch" made of "PRCGKHE" instead of
the conserved "PRCGXXD" sequence and a deletion of
two amino acid residues around the predicted cleavage
site for the mature MMPs (Fig. 8). Second, these two
MMPs are most similar to collagenases and stromelysins
in their domain organization but have a 16 aa insertion in
the 16 aa collagen-binding motif of collagenases at the
exact position where an insertion is found for stromelysins (Fig. 8). Finally, there are a number of insertions
throughout Xenopus MMP N1 compared to human collagenases and stromelysins (Fig. 8). These unique features
suggest that Xenopus MMP N1 is a novel MMP distinct
from other known MMPs.
MMP N2
As described above, there are three X. tropicalis MMPs
homologous to human MMP7 and MMP26. Sequence
analyses allowed us to assign two of them as X. tropicalis
MMP7 and MMP26, respectively. The third one thus represents a novel gene of this subfamily (Figs. 1 and 6).
Interestingly, all three X. tropicalis MMP genes are located
consecutively on a single chromosome with MMPN2 in
between MMP7 and MMP26 (Fig. 9), suggesting that a
duplication event in amphibians led to the extra MMP in
the subfamily.

stromelysins as shown here for MMP3. The Xenopus MMP
N1 has a 16 aa-insertion within the same region (in bold letters) as well as some additional insertions within the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain (in italics). See Fig. 2 for other
information.

Comparison of the MMPs cluster on X. tropicalis Scaffold_119 to that on human Chromosome 11. X. tropicalis
MMP cDNA sequences were used to do BLAST search against the X. tropicalis genomic sequences to locate the genes on the

were arranged on the scaffold according to their location and orientation. The human MMPs on Chromosome 11 were
arranged according to the annotations for their locations and orientations in Human Genome Build 36.3 on the NCBI website.
The MMPs shown above the line for the chromosome/scaffold are MMPs specific to X. tropicalis or human while those shown
below are the MMPs present in both species. Mb, mega base pair; kb, kilo base pairs. Note the gene size was not drawn to scale
for clarity.

MMP N3
MMP N3 is one of the two genes in both X. laevis and X.
tropicalis that have similar levels of homology to human
MMP21 (Figs. 1 and 5). Although MMP N3 and MMP21
are located in different scaffolds in X. tropicalis genomic
sequence, it is possible that they are located adjacent to
each other in a chromosome as the genomic sequence
annotation is incomplete in X. tropicalis. Thus, these two
genes might have derived from a unique gene duplication
event in amphibians.
Collagenases
Based on sequence features and its enzymatic activity, X.
laevis MMP18 was proposed to be a novel collagenase
[42]. Indeed, potential homologs of mammalian collagenases MMP1 and MMP13 have been reported for Xenopus. Interestingly, while the amphibian MMP13 and

human MMP13 are 67% identical, the corresponding
MMP1s are only 51% identical (Table 2), similar to the
levels of homology that MMP18 has with human collagenases (MMP1, 8, and 13). Furthermore, human MMP1
and MMP8 have 3 extra amino acids (RKN) at the C-terminus that are lacking in Xenopus MMP1 and MMP18 as
well as the putative, novel Xenopus collagenases (MMP N4
and N5) (Fig. 2). In addition, a most likely homolog of
human MMP1 has been reported for another amphibian
species, Rana catesbeiana [40]. The Rana MMP1 is much
shorter but much more homologous to human MMP1
(about 80%), compared to these Xenopus collagenases
(data not shown and [42]). Furthermore, unlike the Xenopus MMP1, the Rana MMP1 clusters with human MMP1
on the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Thus, it is possible that
MMP1 has diverged extensively between amphibians and
mammals, leading to a very different size in Rana or its

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:81

loss in Xenopus. On the other hand, all known and putative collagenases in Xenopus are located consecutively in a
single chromosome in the order of MMP1, MMP N4,
MMP N5, MMP18, and MMP13 (Fig. 9). This suggests that
multiple duplication events might be responsible for the
generation of these MMPs. It is interesting to note that
human MMP 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 20, 26 and 27 are all
encoded by Chromosome 11 (Fig. 9). With the exception
of four MMPs (MMP8, 10, 12 and 27) that have no apparent homologs in X. tropicalis, the other six MMPs found on
human Chromosome 11 are clustered on the
Scaffold_119 together with four frog-specific ones
(MMP18, MMP N2, N4, and N5) in X. tropicalis (Fig. 9).
Thus, X. tropicalis Scaffold_119 appears to contain a large
region syntenic to human Chromosome 11 [71]. On the
other hand, with the exception of MMP13 and MMP20, it
is difficult to determine which MMP in this cluster of 10
X. tropicalis MMPs is the homolog of an MMP in the
human cluster based on sequence homology and syntenic
analyses. X. tropicalis MMP13 and MMP20 share high
degrees of homology (about 70%) with their human
counterparts, supporting that they are true homologs of
the human MMPs. Consistently, phylogenetic analysis of
X. tropicalis and human MMPs showed that these two
MMPs evolved earlier than the other MMPs in the cluster
(see Additional file 2). In addition, the drastic differences
in the distances between MMP7 and MMP26 on the chromosome (100 mega bp in human and 100 kb in Xenopus)
(Fig. 9) and on the phylogenetic trees (Supplemental Fig.
2), suggest that this duplication occurred after the separation of amphibians from mammals. The other six MMPs
in the cluster appear to have diverged rapidly during evolution and/or evolved through duplications and/or losses
independently in amphibians and mammals.

Conclusion
Through a bioinformatic approach, we have identified
Xenopus homologs for most human MMPs. By comparing
the MMPs in the two highly related species, X. tropicalis
and X. laevis, we have been able to discover several unique
duplications of MMPs genes in amphibians that are
absent in mammals. On the other hand, several human
MMPs have no apparent homologs in Xenopus and were
possibly evolved de novo in mammals. Among the likely
duplicated genes, genes in the following two pairs, MMP9
and MMP9TH, MMP21 and MMP N3, MMP 7 (or
MMP26) and MMP N2, are more homologous to each
other than to their human homologs (Fig. 1), suggesting
that the duplications occurred after the separation of
amphibians from mammals. On the other hand, MMP23
clusters closer to its human homolog than to the putative
duplicate MMP N6 (Fig. 1), suggesting the possibility that
MMP23 might have duplicated before the separation of
amphibians and mammals and one copy was lost subsequently in mammals. Duplications and loss in MMP

genes are also evident when comparing the largest MMP
cluster located on human Chromosome 11 with the MMP
cluster on X. tropicalis Scaffold_119, where a number of
novel MMPs were found and several MMPs were lost in X.
tropicalis. Our findings thus demonstrate a dynamic process for MMP gene evolution. It will be of interest in the
future to investigate whether MMP expression and function are conserved during vertebrate development. The
sequence information reported here and the advantage of
the amphibian metamorphosis for functional studies in
vivo should facilitate such an endeavor in the near future.

Methods
We first searched the public EST database at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://

Xenopus MMP genes for other possible MMP sequences
based on sequence similarities. The identities of putative
Xenopus MMPs were tentatively determined by building a
