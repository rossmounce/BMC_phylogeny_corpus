Abstract
Background: Among tuberculosis (TB) high incidence regions, Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly
affected with approx. 1.6 million new cases every year. Besides this dramatic situation, data on the
diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains causing this epidemic in this area
are only sparsely available. Here we analyzed the population structure of strains from Sierra Leone
with a special focus on the prevalence of M. africanum.
Results: A total of 97 strains isolated from smear positive cases registered for re-treatment in the
Western Area and Kenema districts in years 2003/2004 were investigated by susceptibility testing
(first line drugs) and molecular typing (IS6110 fingerprinting, spoligotyping, and MIRU-VNTR
typing).
Among the strains analyzed, 32 were resistant to isoniazid, and 11 were multidrug resistant (at least
resistant to isoniazid and rifampin). The population diversity was high with two previously
described M. africanum lineages (West African-1, n = 6; West African-2, n = 17) and seven M.
tuberculosis lineages (Haarlem, n = 14; LAM, n = 15; EAI, n = 4; Beijing, n = 4; S-type, n = 4, X-type,
n = 1; Cameroon, n = 4). Furthermore, two new M. tuberculosis genotypes Sierra Leone-1 (n = 7)
and -2 (n = 10) were found. Strain classification according to a 7 bp deletion in pks1/15 revealed
that the majority of M. tuberculosis strains belonged to the Euro American lineage (66 out of 74).
Conclusion: Resistance rates in Sierra Leone have reached an alarming level. The population
structure of MTBC strains shows an intriguing diversity raising the question of possible
consequences for TB epidemic and for the introduction of new diagnostic tests or treatment
strategies in West Africa.

Background
Pathogens of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTBC) such as M. tuberculosis and M. africanum are the
causative agents of tuberculosis (TB) and remain one of
the leading infectious killers worldwide. According to the
latest WHO report, there have been approx. 8.8 million
new TB-cases worldwide in year 2005 and 1.6 million
people died of TB [1]. Furthermore, treatment and control
of TB is increasingly complicated by the emergence of
drug resistant or even multidrug resistant (MDR, resistance to at least isoniazid [INH] and rifampin [RMP])
strains [2]. Levels of MDR-TB among new patients have
reached 14% in some areas of the world making successful treatment very difficult [2]. Among the regions with a
high incidence of TB, Sub Saharan Africa is particularly
affected with approximately 2 million new cases every
year [1,3]. Furthermore, the TB epidemic in Africa is reinforced by the mutual interaction of TB and HIV as HIV
increases the risk of reactivation of latent TB as well as the
rapid progression to active TB after infection [4].
Besides this dramatic situation in several Sub Saharan
countries, data on the diversity of MTBC strains causing
the epidemic in this area are only sparsely available. However, recent reports indicate that the genetic heterogeneity
of MTBC strains is higher than previously anticipated and
may influence host pathogen interaction, immunogenicity, transmissibility, development of drug resistance, and
the performance of diagnostic tests [5-8]. Starting with the
introduction of the first effective strain genotyping technique, IS6110 DNA fingerprinting [9], a number of further molecular methods such as spoligotyping [10],
investigation of chromosomal deletions (regions of difference, RD), and most recently mycobacterial interspersed
repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRUVNTR) analysis have been established to analyze the
diversity and population structure of clinical MTBC
strains [6,10-12]. These studies confirmed a phylogeographical population structure of the MTBC. In addition
to the classical species M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, M.
microti, M. caprae, M. bovis and M. prototuberculosis
(including M. canetti), several well defined sub lineages
were described within every species such as Haarlem or
Beijing genotype among M. tuberculosis and West African1 and West African-2 among M. africanum [6,11,13].
Based on the new tools for the efficient analysis of the
MTBC population structure, an increasing number of
investigations mounted evidence that the bacterial
genomic background indeed can influence disease related
characteristics [8,14]. This might result e.g. in an
enhanced capability to spread or an enhanced propensity
to gain drug resistance when certain genotypes were considered and can influence diagnostic test such as the newly
developed interferon-gamma-based T cell assays [5,8,14].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/103

In contrast to Europe and USA, where the majority of
human TB cases is caused by M. tuberculosis, a significant
number of TB cases in West Africa has been reported to be
caused by M. africanum strains which can be further subdivided into the two main lineages West African I and
West African II [6,15]. While some studies suggest a lower
virulence and infection frequency of M. africanum which
might result in a longitudinal extinction of this species
[6,16,17], others still indicated higher levels of M. africanum infection prevalence and did not find significant differences in clinical presentation between M. africanum
and M. tuberculosis [18,19]. It appears to be a geographical
gradient in the distribution of both M. africanum lineages
with West African-1 dominating in Cameroon and West
African-2 dominating in Gambia. However only a limited
amount of data based on molecular classification of clinical isolates is available.
To further investigate this question, we have performed a
retrospective study on the population structure of clinical
MTBC strains obtained from patients registered for retreatment in Sierra Leone in years 2003/2004 with a special focus on the prevalence of M. africanum. Sierra Leone
is one of the high burden countries in West Africa with a
TB incidence of 475/100.000 and TB mortality of 111/
100.000 in year 2005 [1]. A study from 1993 reported a
significant number of M. africanum infections in that
region and was used to investigate the longitudinal trend
of M. africanum prevalence [20]. In addition to molecular
typing, drug susceptibility testing was carried out to monitor the level of MDR-TB among previously treated
patients in the study area.

Results and Discussion
In the study period, MTBC cultures were grown from specimens of 103 patients registered for re-treatment between
March 2003 and June 2004 in the Western Area and Kenema districts in Sierra Leone. Chromosomal DNA was successfully isolated from 97 strains which were used for
further analysis. Six strains were not viable at the time
when the DNA isolation was carried out. The main reason
for registration for re-treatment among the 97 patient
were relapse (n = 41) and treatment after interruption (n
= 38). Twelve patients were treatment failure and for six
no data are available.
The level of drug resistance was high; resistance to any first
line drug was found in 50 patients (52%), any resistance
to INH was documented in 32 patients (33%), 14 were
resistant to RMP (14%), and MDR-TB was found in 11
patients (11%). The detailed distribution of drug resistance is shown in Table 1. Our data demonstrate that drug
resistance rates in re-treatment case in Sierra Leone have
reached a level that is comparable with that of other resistance "hot spots" e.g. located in Eastern Europe [2,21].

These findings argue strongly for a systematic surveillance
of drug resistance rates in new as well as previously treated
cases to get a clear picture on the actual resistance situation in Sierra Leone. Systematic susceptibility testing to
rapidly detect drug resistance should be implemented in
combination with effective treatment adapted to individual resistance profiles. This is essential to avoid an ongoing spread of resistant and MDR strains especially in a
particularly vulnerable population with a high HIV rate.
The potential danger posed by such strains has recently
been shown by the longitudinal spread of a highly transmissible MDR strain in the KwaZulu-Natal region which
has finally resulted in the development of extensively drug
resistant variants [22].
To investigate the population structure of the 97 MTBC
strains, molecular typing with IS6110 DNA fingerprinting,
spoligotyping and analysis of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci was
performed. For all strains, clear cut IS6110 DNA fingerprint and spoligotyping profiles were obtained. MIRUVNTR typing was also successful for all strains with the
exception that VNTR 2163b could not be amplified for
one strain and an exceptional large fragment was obtained
for VNTR 0577 for one isolate.
All genotyping data were digitized and analyzed with the
Bionumerics software. A dendrogram based on the similarity of MIRU-VNTR typing data revealed a surprising
high population diversity comprising several groups

which can be mainly allocated to MTBC genotypes
described previously (Fig. 1; for MIRU copy numbers and
SpolDB4 types see Additional file 1). Genotype identification was carried out according to SpolDB4 [13] and by
using the freely assessable MIRU-VNTRplus web database
[23], which comprises genotyping data of a reference
strain collection of validly described MTBC genotypes.
Overall, 23 strains (24%) were identified as M. africanum
and 74 as M. tuberculosis (76%). The most prominent genotype was M. africanum West African-2 (17.5%) followed
by M. tuberculosis LAM (15.5%) and Haarlem (14.4%)
(Table 2). In addition to genotypes described before, we
identified two new strain types which are defined by
closely related IS6110 DNA fingerprint and MIRU-VNTR
patterns and were designated Sierra Leone-1, and Sierra
Leone-2, respectively (Fig. 1). In total, this accounts to a
great variety of a total of 11 different genotypes/phylogenetic lineages that were present among this small sample
of strains from Sierra Leone (Table 2).
To further confirm the genotype classification, we used
the MIRU-VNTR data to calculate a Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST), which uses a maximum parsimony algorithm
to investigate phylogenetic relationships and to identify
clonal complexes within a population. The MST strikingly
confirmed the genotype classification according to
UPGMA tree based analysis (Fig. 1) and to comparison
with the MIRU-VNTRplus web database [23]. All lineages
suspected from dendrogram-based analysis were also
detected as clonal complexes in the MST (Fig. 2) including
the newly described genotypes Sierra Leone-1 and -2, thus
confirming the existence of previously undefined phylogenetic lineages in Sierra Leone. The MST analysis also
helped to assign strains with unclear classification to
known genotypes as some of these were clearly grouped in
the Haarlem complex and others to genotypes Sierra
Leone-1 or -2 (Fig. 2). Overall, there is a very high concordance between genotype classification based on spoligotyping data according to SpolDB4 [13] and to that
based on MIRU-VNTR data. However, MIRU-VNTR typing
is clearly superior to spoligotyping as it allows a clear genotype identification also for strains of heterogeneous (ill
defined) spoligotype clades such as the T-family [13]. Furthermore, compared to spoligotyping that is based on the
analysis of one locus only it is more reliable to measure
genetic distance since it based on 24 independent loci
scattered around the genome [12].
To further investigate the deep phylogenetic branching we
investigated sequence polymorphisms within the polymorphic pks1/15 locus. Interestingly, nearly 70% of all
strains investigated (n = 66, Table 2) showed a 7 bp deletion that is typical for a major MTBC lineage so called
Euro-American lineage according to Gagneux et al. [6].

The wild type pks1/15 sequence was obtained for strains
of genotypes Beijing, EAI, and West African-1 while all
West African-2 strains had a 6 bp deletion which has also

been described before [24]. These data indicate that
strains of the Euro-American lineages might be the major
cause of TB in West Africa, however, with a large diversification in several well defined phylogenetic lineages as
detected by MIRU-VNTR typing (Table 2).
If compared with other studies, it is striking that the M.
tuberculosis Cameroon lineage, which represents 40% of
TB cases in Cameroon [17] and 30% in Burkina Faso [25],
was not prevalent in Sierra Leone where it represents only
4% of all strains investigated. This indicates a geographical influence on the distribution of MTBC lineages in West
Africa. Possible reasons, e.g. differences in host-pathogen
interaction [6], are not yet clear and represent an interesting field for future research.

Due to the limited amount of available patient information and the small study sample, we could not perform a
deeper analysis of possible associations between disease
characteristics and infection with certain genotypes. However, a striking observation made is that out of 4 Beijing
strains three are MDR (Table 2). This is in accordance with
higher rates of MDR among Beijing strains reported from
several parts of the world especially Eastern Europe
[14,26]. Interestingly, the level of MDR was also unequally distributed among strains of other lineages (Table
2). However, due to the small numbers further studies are
necessary to investigate this finding.
To analyze the overall discriminatory power of IS6110
DNA fingerprinting plus spoligotyping compared to 24
loci MIRU-VNTR typing plus spoligotyping in the study
collection (spoligotyping was not considered alone since

Page 5 of 8

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:103

it is known that its discriminatory power is too low), we
have determined the cluster rates obtained with the two
different combinations. IS6110 DNA fingerprinting plus
spoligotyping resulted in 79 distinct typing patterns and
grouped 30 strains (31% of all) in 12 different clusters
ranging in size from 2 to 5 strains (data not shown). The
combination of MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping had a
slightly higher discriminatory power with 85 distinct
types reducing the number of clusters to 10 with 22 strains
(23% of all).
If the correlation between the two typing schemes is considered, there were a total of eight IS6110 DNA fingerprint/spoligotyping clusters that were split by MIRUVNTR typing (data not shown) with confirmed changes in
at least two loci making a real epidemiological linkage
rather unlikely [27]. The highest number of MIRU-VNTR
differences (12 loci out of 24 had a variation) occurred in
a cluster with four EAI genotype strains with just one
IS6110 band and an identical spoligotype. However, this
is not surprising as in this case IS6110 DNA has no discriminatory power which can not sufficiently be increased
by additional use of just spoligotyping in the case of EAI
strains. Out of the 10 MIRU-VNTR/spoligotyping clusters,
five were split up by differences in IS6110 DNA fingerprint
patterns (one up to three bands, data not shown). The
combination IS6110 DNA fingerprinting with MIRUVNTR typing yielded the best discrimination of the strains
analyzed resulting in 91 different types and only 6 clusters
with 12 strains (13%).
These data suggest that the discriminatory power of both
typing schemes is not optimal in this high incidence setting. This might be explained by our sampling procedure
(short study period/not population based) which made it
difficult to detect real transmission chains. However, it is
noteworthy that the epidemiological significance of the
discordant cases of clustering, especially for those involving slight changes in IS6110 DNA fingerprint patterns,
remains unknown given the absence of epidemiological
and contact tracing data for individual patients. Furthermore, the discriminatory power of molecular typing techniques can be significantly influenced by the composition
of the MTBC population investigated. It has already been
shown that IS6110 DNA fingerprinting is not discriminative in strains with lower band numbers as also observed
for strains of the EAI genotype in this study [28]. In a
diverse population of MTBC strains such as in Sierra
Leone, this might result in a lower correlation between
different typing methods if identical molecular typing patterns were considered.
However, the overall concordance between both typing
systems is high if similarity rather than identity is considered. The close relationship of strains in IS6110 DNA fin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/103

gerprinting/spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing/
spoligotyping cluster, respectively, is clearly supported by
the fact that the MIRU-VNTR changes of strains in fingerprint clusters and changes of IS6110 DNA banding patterns of strains in MIRU-VNTR clusters are mainly small,
respectively.

Conclusion
Our study confirmed a high level of drug resistance in
patients registered for re-treatment in the Western Area
and Kenema districts in Sierra Leone. This demonstrates
the need for implementing routine drug susceptibility
testing for all culture positive cases and improved public
health measures to improve the control of the spread of
drug resistant and MDR strains in Sierra Leone.
MIRU-VNTR typing proved to be an excellent tool for
analyses of the population structure of MTBC strains. It
allows the application of automated tools for genotype
identification (such as the MIRU-VNTRplus database
[23]) and is well suited for the identification of new phylogenetic lineages in a study population. Together with
spoligotyping, its discriminatory power is superior to the
combination of spoligotyping and IS6110 DNA fingerprinting, although the highest discriminatory power was
achieved by the combination of all three methods.
The population structure of MTBC strains from Sierra
Leone was found to be surprisingly divers with a total of
11 different genotypes/phylogenetic lineages. With 24%
of all strains investigated, M. africanum still represent a
significant number of cases which appears to be not lower
compared to that reported from a study performed in
years 1992/1993 in Sierra Leone [20]. However, the
majority of strains belonged to the M. tuberculosis European American lineage [6], which can be further subdivided in seven sub lineages of which two have not been
described before. The consequences of this intriguing high
MTBC population diversity for the TB epidemic in this
high incidence setting as well as for the application of new
diagnostic tests or treatment strategies are not yet clear
and need to be urgently addressed in further studies.

Methods
Study design
All smear positive cases registered for re-treatment (failure
at month 5 or above, relapses, treatment after interruption) between March 2003 and June 2004 in the Western
Area and Kenema districts in Sierra Leone were recruited.
Direct microscopy was performed on all cases at the TB
Reference Laboratory, Freetown, Sierra Leone, before
shipment to Germany. Sputum samples were shipped to
the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) in Borstel,
Germany, for cultivation, susceptibility testing, and
molecular characterization.

Strain cultivation and drug susceptibility testing
Primary isolation and cultivation of mycobacterial isolates were performed at the SRL in Borstel as described
elsewhere [29]. For all strains, resistance to the key
antimycobacterial drugs (INH, RMP; ethambutol, [EMB],
streptomycin [SM], pyrazinamide [PZA]) was determined
by using the proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen
(LJ) medium. If growth was insufficient, drug-susceptibility testing was performed by using the modified proportion method in BACTEC 460TB according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Becton-Dickinson).
DNA techniques
Extraction of genomic DNA from the mycobacterial
strains and DNA fingerprinting using IS6110 as a probe
were performed according to a standardized protocol as
described elsewhere [9]. All isolates were analysed by the
spoligotyping technique as described previously by
Kamerbeek et al. [10]. For MIRU-VNTR genotyping
twenty-four loci were amplified by PCR as described previously [12,27]. Briefly, analyses were performed using
multiplex PCRs, Rox-labeled MapMarker 1000 size standard (BioVentures, Inc, Murfreesboro, USA) and the ABI
3100 sequencer with 16 capillaries (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, U.S.A). Sizing of the PCR fragments and
assignment of the various VNTR alleles were done using
customized GeneScan and Genotyper software packages
(Applied Biosystems).

The molecular typing data were analysed with the Bionumerics software (version 4.5; Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) as instructed by the manufacturer.
Similarities of IS6110 RFLP, spoligotyping and MIRUVNTR patterns were calculated by using the Dice or the
categorical coefficient, respectively. A dendrogram was
generated using the unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic averages (UPGMA). Minimum Spanning Tree
analysis based on MRIU-typing data was done by using
the categorical coefficient. Creation of hypothetical types
was not allowed. The priority rule was to link types first
that had highest number of Single Locus Variants.
