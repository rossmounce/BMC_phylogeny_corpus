Abstract
Background: The chondrichthyan or cartilaginous fish (chimeras, sharks, skates and rays) occupy
an important phylogenetic position as the sister group to all other jawed vertebrates and as an early
lineage to diverge from the vertebrate lineage following two whole genome duplication events in
vertebrate evolution. There have been few comparative genomic analyses incorporating data from
chondrichthyan fish and none comparing genomic information from within the group. We have
sequenced the complete Hoxa cluster of the Little Skate (Leucoraja erinacea) and compared to the
published Hoxa cluster of the Horn Shark (Heterodontus francisci) and to available data from the
Elephant Shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome project.
Results: A BAC clone containing the full Little Skate Hoxa cluster was fully sequenced and
assembled. Analyses of coding sequences and conserved non-coding elements reveal a strikingly
high level of conservation across the cartilaginous fish, with twenty ultraconserved elements
(100%,100 bp) found between Skate and Horn Shark, compared to three between human and
marsupials. We have also identified novel potential non-coding RNAs in the Skate BAC clone, some
of which are conserved to other species.
Conclusion: We find that the Little Skate Hoxa cluster is remarkably similar to the previously
published Horn Shark Hoxa cluster with respect to sequence identity, gene size and intergenic
distance despite over 180 million years of separation between the two lineages. We suggest that
the genomes of cartilaginous fish are more highly conserved than those of tetrapods or teleost fish
and so are more likely to have retained ancestral non-coding elements. While useful for isolating
homologous DNA, this complicates bioinformatic approaches to identify chondrichthyan-specific
non-coding DNA elements

Background
The Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) are one of the
three extant major clades of jawed vertebrates and comprise two sister-groups; the elasmobranchs (sharks, skates
and rays) and the holocephalans (chimeras and ratfish Figure 1). Although relatively species-poor by comparison

to their osteichthyan (bony vertebrate) relatives (~970
species of chondrichthyan, ~55,600 species of bony vertebrates [1]), they occupy an important phylogenetic position as the sister-group to all other jawed vertebrates and
as one of the first lineages to diverge after the two rounds
of whole genome duplications that occurred early in ver-

tebrate evolution [2]. Despite this, there have been relatively few studies dealing with chondricthyan genomics.
Those that have been carried out have usually used cartilaginous fish as the outgroup to studies of bony vertebrates [3,4]. One problem is the large size of many
chondricthyan genomes, which range from 1.5 to 16.7 Gb
with a median value of 7.1 Gb or roughly twice the size of
the human genome [5]. Venkatesh et al. [6] completed a
1.4× coverage draft survey of the Elephant Shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome (a member of the holocephalans,
the sister group of the true sharks and rays), having chosen
this species because of its smaller genome. Additionally, a
Little Skate (Leucoraja erinacea) genome project has been
approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute. However, there is currently little information available on patterns of genome evolution within the
cartilaginous fish. To start to rectify this omission, we
undertook the sequencing and analysis of a complete Hox
cluster from the Little Skate.

The Hox genes play important roles in determination of
anterior-posterior patterning during embryonic development [7]. Their clustered organisation in the genome is a
consequence of their origin from tandem gene duplications and is intimately associated with their expression
during development. To date, all invertebrate lineages
have been found to have only a single set of Hox genes,
generally arranged in a single Hox cluster. In contrast, vertebrates have multiple more compact clusters, with four
being present in tetrapods (Hoxa, Hoxb, Hoxc and Hoxd
[8]) as a result of two rounds of whole genome duplication at the base of the vertebrates. Teleost fish have up to
eight clusters and, within teleosts, the salmonids have at
least thirteen as the result of additional genome duplications [9-11]. Furthermore, teleost Hox clusters are known
to evolve at a faster rate than those of tetrapods, making it
difficult to identify ancient conserved non-coding
sequences [12]. Two Hox gene clusters (Hoxa and Hoxd)
have been fully sequenced from a chondrichthyan (the

Horn Shark Heterodontus francisci [3,4]). Because of this,
and the availability of the complete sequence of the Hoxa
cluster of the Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus [13]) - a
member of the earliest diverging lineage of ray-finned fish
and therefore unaffected by the whole genome duplications which increased Hox cluster number in teleosts - we
chose to analyse the Hoxa cluster of Little Skate (Leucoraja
erinacea), a member of the oldest extant lineage of Elasmobranchs [14]. Together with the data from the more
recently diverging Horn Shark and outgroup Holocephalan sequences we can for the first time carry out a comparative genomic analysis within the cartilaginous fish.

Results and Discussion
Size of Chondrichthyan Hoxa clusters
The 133, 863 bp sequence of the Little Skate BAC clone
0081H20 (submitted to Genbank under accession #
FJ944024) contains the full Hoxa cluster as deduced by
comparison to the published Horn Shark and Elephant
Shark clusters [3,4,6], as well as those of other vertebrates
(Figure 2). Although coelacanth has a Hoxa14 gene, we do
not believe that this gene is present in either Skate or Horn
Shark because of the distribution of conserved non-coding elements between the three species. Thus a conserved
element found 5' to Hoxa14 in coelacanth is present 5' to
Hoxa13 in Little Skate and Horn Shark. The distance from
the start codon of Hoxa13 to the stop codon of Hoxa1
comprises 104,602 bp, strikingly similar to the 105,289

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/218

bp figure for the Horn Shark despite the genome size of
the Horn Shark being around twice the size of that of Little
Skate (6.65-8.6 Gb for Heterodontus francisci; 3.4 Gb for
Leucoraja erinacea [5]). This similarity is also reflected in
the intergenic distances within the clusters themselves
(Figure 3). If the larger size of the Horn Shark genome is
due to an expansion of repetitive DNA, then this is clearly
not reflected in the overall size of the Hoxa cluster. Indeed
gnathostome Hox clusters are renowned for being free of
repetitive DNA [15] (although see [16] for an exception).
It is currently not possible to determine the total length of
the Hoxa cluster in the elephant shark, since the draft
genome sequence has relatively short contigs [6]. However, several contigs contain the full coding sequence of
single Hox genes so for these genes it is possible to compare gene length between the three chondrichthyans
(Table 1). In these cases, the Horn Shark and Little Skate
are virtually identical, whilst the Elephant Shark typically
has slightly larger total gene lengths.
Sequence conservation in Chondrichthyan Hoxa clusters
Within the Little Skate Hoxa cluster, only 9522 bp codes
for protein (compared to 9525 bp in Horn Shark). Hox
gene coding sequence is typically around 95-98% identical at the amino acid level between the two species. Turning to non-coding DNA, an alignment of the Little Skate
Hoxa cluster with the orthologous regions of other vertebrates (Figure 4) reveals a striking level of sequence iden-

and an actinopterygian (ray-finned fish), Polypterus senegalus. The Skate and Horn Shark clusters are remarkably similar in overall length and intergenic distance.

tity between the two elasmobranchs even at reasonably
stringent (but biologically arbitrary) alignment conditions of ≥ 70% identity over a 100 bp window. This is
especially surprising given that the skates are thought to
be the sister-group to all other extant elasmobranchs [14]
and therefore must have diverged from them in the late
Triassic or early Jurassic at least 200 million years ago.
Even if skates and rays are not the sister group to other
elasmobranchs, the divergence time of Little Skate and
Heterodontus must still be at least 180 million years ago,
based on the age of the oldest fossil Heterodontids and
Batoids (skates and rays) from the Toarcian Stage of the
Early Jurassic [17]. A comparable figure would be the
divergence of the marsupial and human lineages around
162-191 million years ago [18].
Ultraconserved regions in chondrichthyan Hoxa clusters
Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) were originally defined
as regions of 200 bp or more conserved at 100% identity

between human and rodent genomes [19]. Recently,
Stephen et al. [20] identified a large number of ultraconserved elements that are 100% identical over ≥ 100 bp in
at least three placental mammals and Wang et al. [21]
found that 41% of these UCEs were present in the Elephant Shark genome at an average identity of 79.8%. Of
the 13,736 UCEs identified by Stephen et al. [20], thirty
are located in the human Hoxa locus (UCEs El11507El11536, I. Makunin, personal communication) and of
these, fifteen are also found in Little Skate (at least 75%
conserved with an uninterrupted stretch of at least 20 bp
at 100%). With the complete sequence known for the
Hoxa cluster of two species of chondricthyan, it is now
also possible to look for UCEs conserved within the cartilaginous fish. We find 20 regions of ≥ 100 bp that are conserved at 100% identity between Little Skate and Horn
Shark, nine of which overlap with coding regions and two
of which are conserved at 100% identity over 200 bp (Figure 5a), of these, 14 are identifiable (but not 100% con-

served) in the Hoxa clusters of a sarcopterygian (human)
and a non-duplicated actinopterygian (Polypterus). This
very high degree of conservation of ultraconserved elements between Little Skate and Horn Shark is surprising
given the length of time that has passed since the divergence of these two elasmobranchs. By comparison, there
are only three UCEs conserved absolutely between the
Hoxa clusters of human and marsupials (both Platypus
and Opossum), species that have been separated for
approximately the same period of time. If the Elephant
Shark genome is taken to be approximately 75% complete
[21] one would expect to find ~15 of the 20 UCEs conserved between Skate and Horn Shark in this species. In
fact, only three UCEs (3, 12 and 16) are missing from the
current genome assembly, with the remaining 17 gener-

ally being present at 95-98% identity and five (UCEs 4, 10
and 13-15) present at 100% identity. Again, this level of
conservation is surprising since holocephalans have been
separated from the elasmobranchs for at least 375 million
years (based on the oldest Holocephalan fossils from the
Frasnian stage of the late Devonian [17]). A comparable
figure for the human genome would be the divergence of
human and frog (Xenopus tropicalis); species which have
been separated for at least 330-350 million years and in
which only a single Hoxa ultraconserved element at 100%
over ≥ 100 bp is found. If the conservation threshold is
lowered to 90%, then there are still only nine elements
conserved between human and frog, five of which overlap
with Hox coding sequences.

Predicted non-coding RNA in chondrichthyan Hoxa
clusters
Vertebrate Hox clusters are known to contain several
microRNAs (mir10a and mir10b in the Hoxb and Hoxd
clusters; mir196a1, mir196a2 and mir196b in the Hoxa,
Hoxb and Hoxc clusters) which are known to be involved
in anti-sense regulation of Hox genes both within and
across clusters [22]. The microRNA located in the Hoxa
cluster (mir196b) is known to regulate Hoxa7 in the
mouse through a reduction of protein level, rather than
mRNA destabilisation [23] and has several potential binding sites in the 3'UTR of the Hoxa7 gene. There are four
potential mir196b binding sites in the 3' UTR of Horn
Shark Hoxa7 [24] and these are also found in the Little
Skate sequence, although there is also an additional site at
the beginning of the Skate Hoxa7 3' UTR. Bioinformatic
identification of microRNA targets is complicated by the
fact that the miRNA-target binding can include mismatches and gaps and often involves only a small part of
the mature miRNA [25]. Interestingly, the Polypterus sen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/218

egalus HoxA cluster has retained mir196b despite the loss
of the Hoxa7 gene, lending support to the suggestion that
mir196b has other targets within vertebrate Hox clusters
[22]. We have identified four putative non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs - Figure 6) in the Little Skate BAC sequence
through the prediction of stable stem-loop secondary
structures. One predicted RNA is the known mir196b,
indicating that the analysis can reliably recover ncRNAs.
The second predicted RNA is located upstream of Hoxa13
and is found only in the Little Skate. The third is located
within the intron of Hoxa10 and is conserved between Little Skate, Horn Shark, Elephant Shark and Indonesian
Coelacanth, but not in teleosts or tetrapods. The final predicted ncRNA is more problematic, having an unusual
secondary structure in skate and an even more unusual
structure in Elephant Shark (not shown). Closer examination of this RNA suggests that it may not be functional,
since it is located near to several repetitive elements (Figure 5b) in both Skate and Elephant Shark and the first 30
bp (which are also the last 30 bp due to the stem-loop

structure) show numerous strong hits to many cartilaginous fish sequences on GenBank (including sequences
from Callorhinchus, Triakis, Heterodontus, Squalus, Ginglymostoma and Bathyraja) as well as a very large number of
hits to the Elephant Shark genome sequence. It is possible
that this prediction actually reflects two repetitive elements in opposite orientations suggestive of a stable stemloop structure.
Repetitive DNA
Vertebrate Hox clusters are usually free of complex
repeats. However, the Little Skate Hoxa cluster contains a
109 bp region between Hoxa11 and Hoxa10 which shows
high (84%) identity to the Deu-domain and 3'-tail region
of SacSINE1 identified by Nishihara et al. [26] in the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias). SacSINE1 is a 463 bp tRNAderived SINE related to the SINE3 family of zebrafish and
thought to be derived from the L2 clade of LINEs. The Little Skate SINE fragment lacks the 5' promoter for transcription by RNA III polymerase, indicating that it is a
non-functional retroposon although it may have accumulated some other function which accounts for the degree
of sequence conservation to SacSINE1. Alternatively, the
Little Skate SINE may represent a recent retroposition into
the Hox cluster which has been inactivated by the loss of
the 5' promoter region. The orthologous region of the
Horn Shark Hoxa cluster shows no sequence similarity to
the Little Skate SINE fragment and it will be interesting to
trace the evolution of this SINE within other members of
the Rajidae. Repeatmasker [27] identifies 6523 bp
(4.87%) of the Little Skate BAC clone as being repetitive,
of which only 2432 bp (2.33%) is located in the gene-containing region between HoxA1 and HoxA13. The same
region of the Horn Shark Hoxa cluster contains only 1205
bp (1.14%) of repetitive DNA, despite the larger genome
size of Horn Shark. Aside from the SINE fragment in the
Little Skate cluster, the rest of the repeats are simplesequence elements such as mononucleotide tracts (see
below) or microsatellites with a repeating unit of 2-6 bp.
It seems likely therefore that the constraining force on
repetitive DNA in vertebrate Hox clusters is not the preservation of precise intergenic distances (since microsatellites are known to expand and contract by strand slippage
during DNA replication) but rather the exclusion of alternative transcriptional start sites in LINE or SINE promoters which may disrupt the tightly controlled expression of
Hox genes during development.

Both the Skate and Horn Shark Hoxa clusters contain a
number of guanine-rich sequences (Figure 5b). Regions
such as this have been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes through the formation of stable
four-stranded structures (the G-quadruplex or G4 DNA
[28]) and it is possible that these sequences may be
involved in transcriptional control of the Hoxa genes. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/218

Quadparser program [29] identifies 13 putative G4-forming regions in the Little Skate BAC sequence, nine of
which are located within the coding region between
Hoxa13 and Hoxa1. The orthologus region in Horn Shark
contains 14 such sequences and although some relative
positions appear to be conserved (such as between Hoxa9
and Hoxa10 and a doublet between Hoxa4 and Hoxa5)
these do not appear to be homologous based on conservation of both the G4 quadruplex and surrounding
sequences. Because of this, it appears unlikely that G4
DNA plays an ancestral role in Hoxa gene regulation,
although it is still possible that there are some cell- or species-specific requirements for the G4 structures in nonembryonic Hox expression.

Conclusion
The Little Skate Hoxa cluster is strikingly similar to that of
the Horn Shark in terms of both sequence conservation
and intergenic distances despite the two lineages having
been separated by at least 180 million years. The available
data from the ongoing Elephant Shark (Callorhinchus
milii) genome project suggests that the Hoxa cluster of this
species is also highly conserved with respect to the Skate
and Horn Shark despite having been separated from them
for around 375 million years. Comparisons of the human
Hoxa cluster to those of marsupials and amphibians
reveal a much lower level of sequence conservation over
similar periods of time, indicating either a faster rate of
molecular evolution in the tetrapod and mammalian lineages or a slower rate of evolution in the cartilaginous
fish. This finding echoes the suggestion of Wang et al. [21]
that UCEs and protein-coding genes are evolving more
slowly in Elephant Shark compared to other vertebrates. If
the level of conservation seen in the chondrichthyan Hoxa
clusters in reflected across the entire genome then this will
complicate attempts to identify functional conserved noncoding elements within the cartilaginous fish using phylogenetic footprinting. This is an important consideration
given the two cartilaginous fish genomes currently in the
pipeline and the likely increase in this number due to
recent advances in genome sequencing technologies.

Methods
The Little Skate BAC clone 0081H20 was isolated in a low
stringency pooled homeobox screen of a set of 4.1× coverage BAC library (BAC Library RE__Ba (Little Skate)) filters
from the Clemson University Genomics Institute (CUGI).
The BAC was shotgun sequenced to 9.3× coverage by contract to the Genome Center at Washington University,
resulting in 14 major contigs in 4 scaffolds. Remaining
gaps were filled using a combination of direct sequencing
on BAC DNA or by cloning and sequencing of PCR products from primers designed to cross gaps in the scaffolds.
Genes were annotated by comparison to published Horn
Shark genes (from BAC sequences described by [3] and [4]
