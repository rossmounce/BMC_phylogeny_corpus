small piroplasm in dogs - first report from
Portugal and possible vertical transmission

Abstract
Background: Canine babesiosis (or piroplasmosis) is endemic in northern Portugal, but molecularly confirmed
cases of infection with small piroplasms have not been reported in the country. Three German shepherd dogs a bitch and its 2-month old pup and an unrelated male - clinically suspected of piroplasmosis were assessed for
babesial infection.
Results: Parasitemia with small piroplasms was detected by microscopy in two dogs. All three dogs were positive
by PCR and the Babesia microti-like small piroplasm (syn. Theileria annae) was identified by DNA sequencing. These
are the first confirmed cases of babesiosis caused by the B. microti-like piroplasm both in dogs from Portugal and
in dogs suspected of clinical piroplasmosis outside of Spain.
Conclusions: Although the bitch and the male had visited neighboring Galicia (northwestern Spain), where the
disease is endemic, incursion of this piroplasm into northern Portugal is evident and infection of the non-traveled
pup was due to either vertical transmission or autochthonous tick infection.

Background
Species of protozoa from the Babesia and Theileria genera (order Piroplasmida) infect dogs in many parts of
the world and cause important diseases known as babesiosis or piroplasmosis [1]. The etiological agents are
transmitted by ixodid tick vectors [2], although transmission via blood transfusion [3] and the placenta [4]
have been reported for some babesial species and dog to
dog transmission of B. gibsoni by dog bites is strongly
supported by epidemiological evidence [5-8]. Canine
babesiosis may range from being sub-clinical to severe
and fatal, depending on the virulence of the pathogen
species or strain [9] and also on the susceptibility of the
individual host as related to its age, immune status and
concurrent infection or illness [1,10]. Lethargy, anorexia,
pale mucous membranes, hyperthermia, hemoglobinuria,
splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia

are clinical manifestations frequently described in dogs
suffering from piroplasmosis [11,12].
The size of their pear-shaped intraerythrocytic stages
(piroplasms) has traditionally been used for the identification of Babesia species in dogs: large forms of Babesia
canis (3-5 μm) and small Babesia gibsoni (0.5-2.5 μm).
Additional criteria, especially molecular techniques, have
further differentiated several “large” or “small” agents of
canine piroplasmosis, including three subspecies of
B. canis [13] currently regarded as separate species
[1,14,15] and one yet unnamed large Babesia sp. from
North Carolina genetically related to Babesia bigemina of
cattle [16,17]. Babesia canis is the main etiological agent
in temperate regions of Europe and causes mild to severe
disease [18]. Babesia vogeli, the least virulent subspecies, is
also present in Europe [12] as well as in tropical or subtropical areas of Africa [19], Asia [20], Australia [21], and
North and South America [6,22]. Babesia rossi, notoriously the most virulent subspecies, has been reported in
western, eastern and southern Africa [23]. Babesia gibsoni
is present in five continents [1,6,11,20,24], including
Europe [25-29]. Other genetically distinct small piroplasms
capable of causing disease in dogs are Babesia conradae,

from California [30], and the canine Babesia microti-like
“Spanish isolate” or Theileria annae (phylogenetically
close to zoonotic B. microti of humans). The latter is endemic in Galicia, northwestern Spain [31], but was also sporadically found in asymptomatic dogs from Croatia [28]
and Mississippi [8].
The increased mobility of dogs may promote the circulation and exchange of vector-borne agents, including
canine piroplasms, and their spread into geographical
areas where they were previously not endemic [32]. Due
to differences in the virulence of babesial species infecting
dogs, information on the regional occurrence and prevalence of these agents is important for the diagnosis and
management of individual clinical cases. Blood smear
examination is useful to distinguish large from small
intraerythrocytic piroplasms, but molecular diagnostic
tools, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
DNA sequencing, are more sensitive methods that provide
an accurate identification at the species, subspecies or
genotype levels [20,33].
Canine babesiosis is endemic in northern Portugal.
Ninety six per cent of the molecularly characterized
cases of disease have been found infected with large
B. canis and only 4% with B. vogeli [34,35]. However,
confirmed cases of small piroplasms in dogs have not
been reported in this country. The present study reports
three cases of babesiosis in dogs from northern Portugal
found infected with small piroplasms.

Methods
Dogs and samples

During 2009, blood samples were received at Inno
laboratories, in the city of Braga, northwestern Portugal,
from three German shepherd dogs clinically suspected
of having piroplasmosis: a 4-year old bitch and a 1-year
old male (October) and a 2-month female (November).
Reported clinical signs included lethargy and pale
mucous membranes for all the animals; anorexia for the
bitch and the pup; and fever (40°C) for the bitch. The
three animals were from the same breeder. The pup had
been born from the bitch in late September 2009 and
never left Portugal. At the time samples were received,
the bitch and pup still lived together, in the district of
Braga, in an outdoor environment. Four other littermates had already been taken to other locations and
were not available for medical examination. The male
dog was also living in an outdoor environment in northwestern Portugal. In early August 2009 the bitch had
been taken to Germany to mate and in the middle of
that month, on its way back to northwestern Portugal, it
was housed for 10 days in a kennel in Vigo, Galicia
(northwestern Spain). The male dog had also been
housed in the same kennel in Vigo, approximately at the
same time. The bitch had been found infested with

ticks, whose species was not identified, in the second
half of August 2009, after returning to Portugal; the pup
never had detectable ticks; and no information on the
presence of ticks could be retrieved regarding the male
dog.
Blood in EDTA was used to prepare thin glass-slide
smears that were air-dried, fixed with methanol, stained
with Hemacolor® (Merck, Germany) and then examined
under light microscopy (magnification of 1000×) for the
detection of possible piroplasms. Blood was also spotted
onto individual papers (7.5 cm × 2.5 cm; GB 002 Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) allowed to air-dry
and stored at -20°C until further use.
A complete blood count (CBC) was performed for all
the dogs and repeated CBC was carried out for the bitch
two days (day 2) and six days (day 6) after the primary
assessment (day 0). A reticulocyte count was done for the
bitch on day 2 using new methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich,
UK), as described by Tvedten and Weiss [36]. An additional determination of serum biochemical parameters
(total protein, albumin, globulins, urea, creatinine, total
bilirubin, glucose, alanine transaminase and alkaline
phosphatase) was done on day 0 from the bitch’s serum
(Prestige 24i; Cormay, Tokyo Boeki Medical System,
Japan).
DNA extraction, PCR and sequence analysis

DNA was extracted from filter papers as previously
described [35]. Primers Piro-A (5’-AAT ACC CAA TCC
TGACAC AGG G-3’) and Piro-B (5’-TTA AAT ACG
AAT GCC CCC AAC-3’) were used to amplify a 408 bp
fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp. by PCR
[37]. Amplification was done under the following conditions: 94°C for 1 min followed by 39 cycles of 94°C for
45 s, 62°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 45 s. DNA sequencing
was performed at the Center for Genomics Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Obtained DNA
sequences were evaluated with the ChromasPro software
version 1.33 and compared for similarity to sequences in
GenBank, using the BLAST program hosted by NCBI,
National Institutes of Health, USA http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov.

Results
Intraerythrocytic isolated ring-shaped bodies morphologically compatible with small piroplasms were detected
by microscopy in blood smears from the bitch and the
pup (Figure 1) but not from the male. Table 1 summarizes hematological results from the three animals.
The bitch primarily had a hypochromic normocytic anemia at day 0 that changed to hypochromic macrocytic on
day 2. An increasing level of polychromasia was evident
in the blood smear at days 0 (1+), 2 (3+) and 6 (4+), as
well as other hematological findings compatible with

regenerative anemia, i.e. anisocytosis, metarubricytes and
Howell-Jolly bodies. A count of 1 × 105 reticulocytes/μl
on day 2 (regarded as a mild to moderate increase, which
is compatible with 6 × 104 to 2 × 105 reticulocytes/μl),
further confirmed regenerative anemia. Toxic neutrophils
(10-30%), at days 0 and 2, exhibiting Döhle bodies and
cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolization, and reactive
lymphocytes were also observed. Thrombocytopenia was
also present and changed from severe at day 0 to mild at
day 6. Macroplatelets could be detected, at days 0 and 2,

suggesting increased bone marrow megakaryocytic activity. On the biochemical profile, bilirubin concentration
was mildly elevated at 0.63 mg/dl (normal range: 0-0.3).
Results for the other measured parameters were within
normal limits.
The male dog presented a moderate hypochromic
macrocytic anemia, with findings typical of red blood cells
(RBC) regeneration, i.e. polychromasia, 81% of nucleated
RBC (metarubricytes and rubricytes) and anisocytosis.
Mild leukocytosis (23.1 × 103 cells/μl) was noted, with
mild neutrophilia and severe lymphocytosis. Platelet count
could not be done, due to the existence of platelet aggregates, which were detected by blood smear observation.
The pup had severe hypochromic normocytic anemia
with polychromasia and anisocytosis. Moderate to severe
leukopenia with a degenerative left shift and more than
30% of toxic neutrophils exhibiting Döhle bodies, cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolization, and reactive lymphocytes
were found. Severe thrombocytopenia as well as macroplatelets were observed.
The three animals were all found positive for Babesia
spp. by the PCR assay. Further sequence analysis
revealed that the bitch and male yielded an identical
414 bp long sequence that was 409/414 (98%) identical
to the GenBank closest sequence EU583387.1, the
canine small Babesia “Spanish isolate” or B. microti-like
piroplasm. The pup yielded a 413 bp sequence that was
409/413 (99%) identical to GenBank EU583387.1 and
99% identical to the bitch and male sequence.
Imidocarb dipropionate (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection, repeated 14 days later) was used to treat the bitch
(on day 1), the male and the pup. Available information

suggested an apparent clinical recovery of the three
dogs; however, the pup died in December 2009 due to
parvoviral enteritis.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
molecular identification of the B. microti-like piroplasm
both in dogs from Portugal and in dogs suspected of
clinical piroplasmosis outside of Spain.
The designation B. microti-like piroplasm has been
used in the present description, as genetic analyses
revealed that T. annae [38] is more closely related to
B. microti, a rodent piroplasm that causes babesiosis in
humans, than to other Theileria spp. [8,39,40]. Furthermore, no evidence has been presented for pre-erythrocytic stages of this infection in leukocytes, which is a
characteristic of the theilerial life cycle [41]. The name
“Spanish isolate” also used to describe this pathogen [8]
comes from the first description of this causative agent,
which was made from a dog with piroplasmosis (originated from a Babesia-free area in Germany) that had
travelled to northeastern Spain [38].
The B. microti-like piroplasm can cause severe disease
and mortality in dogs and is endemic in Galicia, northwestern Spain [31,39], which northerly borders the area
where the three dogs from the present report lived in
Portugal. According to the published information,
the B. microti-like piroplasm had been molecularly
sequenced from dogs with clinical babesiosis only from
Spain and mostly from Galicia [31,39,42]. Besides, there
are reports of infection in a few clinically healthy dogs:
one from Tarragona, northeastern Spain [43], another
one from Croatia [28] and an additional one from Mississipi [8]. DNA of the B. microti-like piroplasm has also
been detected in foxes from central and northern Spain
[44-46], eastern Canada, North Carolina in the USA
[47], Croatia [48]; in cats from Portugal [49] and Italy
[50]; in a donkey from northern Spain [51]; in roe deer
from Italy [52]; in feral raccoons from Japan [53]; in
Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from
Italy [54,55]; and in I. ricinus and Ixodes hexagonus
from northern Spain [46]. To date, this piroplasm species has not been reported in Africa or Australia.
Ixodes hexagonus is the main candidate vector of the
B. microti-like piroplasm in Galicia [56]. This tick species
has also been found in northern Portugal [57,58], but the
endemic nature of the small piroplasm in this area cannot be ascertained. In the present report, the bitch and
the male dog were most probably infected during the 10day period they spend in Vigo (Galicia), although the
possibility that the infection originated in Portugal should
not be excluded. Both dogs became clinically suspected
two months after returning from Vigo. This fact suggests
a longer incubation period for the disease caused by the

Page 4 of 6

B. microti-like piroplasm in comparison with the 4 to 21
days described for other canine babesial infections [2].
However, the pup never left Portugal and could have
been infected by vertical transmission. The transplacental
transmission of B. gibsoni has been experimentally
demonstrated in a bitch that delivered a litter of one stillborn and four live pups [4]. These four pups died from
congenital babesiosis between 14 and 39 days post-birth.
In horses, once an animal is infected with T. equi it
remains a lifelong carrier, since anti-theilerial drugs do
not completely eliminate the parasite [59]. Infected
mares can transmit T. equi piroplasms across the placenta and this might result in abortion or neonatal piroplasmosis. Colostral antibodies to T. equi may suppress
parasitaemia in newborn foals thereby reducing the incidence of clinical neonatal equine piroplasmosis, which
could control parasitaemia during the foals’ early
months of life [59]. In the present report, a more than
2-month time interval between possible infection
in utero and clinical disease might be explained by a
similar protection conferred on the pup by maternal
colostrum. Nevertheless, and although it had no detectable ticks, the possibility that the pup was infected after
birth by a tick vector cannot be ruled out.
A severe regenerative haemolytic anemia and moderate to severe thrombocytopenia are common findings
among dogs infected with the B. microti-like piroplasm
[60,61]. In the present report, the three dogs had regenerative anaemia, based on reticulocyte count (performed
only for the bitch), presence of polychromasia, anisocytosis and nucleated RBC. The mechanisms related with
severe hemolytic anemia may be more dependent on the
host immune response than on the direct destruction of
RBC by the piroplasm [2]. The bitch and pup also had
confirmed severe thrombocytopenia, while platelet
count could not be assessed in the male dog. Mechanisms of local or systemic intravascular coagulopathy,
immune-mediated destruction or splenic sequestration
may be implicated in severe thrombocytopenias. On the
other hand, the almost constant presence of macroplatelets in blood smears is associated with a bone marrow
regenerative response to platelet consumption, as well as
sequestration or destruction [2].
The bitch had normal leukocyte counts, while the
male dog presented leukocytosis and the pup had leukopenia. Camacho-García [31] describes that half the dogs
with piroplasmosis due to the B. microti-like piroplasm
had normal leukocyte counts. Nevertheless, the values
may range between leukopenia and leukocytosis, with
the latter reaching extreme counts compatible with a
leukemoid response in immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia [60]. Many cases also develop serum biochemistry abnormalities compatible with a glomerular component of renal failure [31]. In a study describing 58

Simões et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:50
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/50

infected dogs, 36% were azotemic at the time of diagnosis and 22% died with azotemia being the main cause of
mortality [62]. In the present report, serum creatinine
and urea were assessed only for the bitch and found to
be within their normal range.
According to Camacho-García [31], animals infected
with the B. microti-like piroplasm had a syndrome clinically more severe than those infected with B. canis,
treatment with imidocarb dipropionate was less effective
and evolution towards renal failure more frequent. At
the time the pup died from parvoviral enteritis, one
month after diagnosis of babesial infection, it had apparently recovered from the clinical disease caused by the
small piroplasm.
The definitive diagnosis of babesiosis for the male dog
was achieved only after the PCR and sequencing results.
Indeed, in dogs clinically suspected of babesiosis, microscopy may lack sensitivity due to low parasitaemia [1].
Sensitive molecular detection and species identification
are important for the selection of the appropriate therapy and for prognosis, as well as for the screening of
subclinical infections and blood donors [29].

Conclusions
This study reports the first confirmed cases of canine
babesiosis caused by the B. microti-like piroplasm in
Portugal involving two adult dogs and a pup. Although
the two adult dogs may have been infected in the neighboring Spanish province of Galicia, incursion of this
infection into northern Portugal where possible suitable
tick vectors are present is evident. Infection of the nontraveled pup was due to either vertical transmission or
autochthonous tick infection. Awareness of the risk of
spread of the B. microti-like piroplasm to additional
countries via dog travel or infected vector transport
should be increased and efforts to prevent further
spread of this infection are warranted.
