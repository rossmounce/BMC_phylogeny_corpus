Abstract
Background: On porcine chromosome 7, the region surrounding the Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC) contains several Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) influencing many traits including growth, back fat
thickness and carcass composition. Previous studies highlighted that a fragment of ~3.7 Mb is located
within the Swine Leucocyte Antigen (SLA) complex. Internal rearrangements of this fragment were
suggested, and partial contigs had been built, but further characterization of this region and identification
of all human chromosomal fragments orthologous to this porcine fragment had to be carried out.
Results: A whole physical map of the region was constructed by integrating Radiation Hybrid (RH)
mapping, BAC fingerprinting data of the INRA BAC library and anchoring BAC end sequences on the
human genome. 17 genes and 2 reference microsatellites were ordered on the high resolution
IMNpRH212000rad Radiation Hybrid panel. A 1000:1 framework map covering 550 cR12000 was established
and a complete contig of the region was developed. New micro rearrangements were highlighted between
the porcine and human genomes. A bovine RH map was also developed in this region by mapping 16 genes.
Comparison of the organization of this region in pig, cattle, human, mouse, dog and chicken genomes
revealed that 1) the translocation of the fragment described previously is observed only on the bovine and
porcine genomes and 2) the new internal micro rearrangements are specific of the porcine genome.
Conclusion: We estimate that the region contains several rearrangements and covers 5.2 Mb of the
porcine genome. The study of this complete BAC contig showed that human chromosomal fragments
homologs of this heavily rearranged QTL region are all located in the region of HSA6 that surrounds the
centromere. This work allows us to define a list of all candidate genes that could explain these QTL effects.

Background

Results

Chromosome 7 contains a region of the porcine genome
in which the highest number of quantitative trait loci
(QTL) have been mapped, affecting most notably growth,
fat deposition and carcass composition [1-5]. Among all
QTL detected on this chromosome, many have been
mapped in an interval spanning the SLA complex in position 7p12-q12. Development of a high resolution porcine
gene map and comparison with the human map is a
major step towards the identification of the genes responsible for QTL effects. The development of two radiation
hybrid panels IMpRH and IMNpRH2 constructed after
irradiation of porcine cells at 7.000 and 12.000 rads [6,7]
provides tools of choice for such comparative mapping
studies at 2 complementary resolutions : 1) one breakage
could be observed on at least one hybrid of the panel for
markers at an average distance of >50 and 20 Kb, 2) the
order of a set of markers can be unambiguously determined, provided that the distance between adjacent markers range from 0.25 to 1.5 Mb on IMpRH panel and from
100 to 600 Kb on IMNpRH2 panel [8].

Development of a preliminary porcine gene map
To study the complete rearrangements that occurred in
this region of an estimated 3.7 Mb and containing the 3
genes LANO (previously called FLJ10775), BMP5 and
BAG2 [11,12], it was necessary to: 1) define the chromosomal blocks arranged differently between HSA6 pericentromeric region and SSC7; 2) determine if additional
human fragments moved in this porcine region. In the
first approach, we increased the density of genes mapped
in this region of the IMNpRH212000 panel [7]. Using the
ICCARE browser [13], we identified genes for which porcine EST were available. We chose 5 genes located on
HSA6p21.32 and 5 genes located on HSA6p12.1-6p11.2:
COL11A2 (33.24 Mb), HSD17B8 (33.28 Mb), RING1
(33.29 Mb), VPS52 (33.33 Mb), RPS18 (33.35 Mb), GCLC
(53.47 Mb), TINAG (54.28 Mb), HCRTR2 (55.15 Mb),
COL21A1 (56.03 Mb) and DST (56.43 Mb). No gene was
selected below PRIM2A since no porcine sequence was
available for the few genes located in this region very close
to the centromere of HSA6. When possible, primers were
developed in the 3' UTR sequence of selected genes (Table
1). For GCLC only, we had to choose primers in two consecutive exons framing an intron. Markers developed for
these 10 genes, as well as markers previously developed
[11,12] for RXRb (33.27 Mb), ELOVL5 (53.28 Mb) and
PRIM2A (57.29 Mb), were analyzed on the 90 clones of
IMNpRH212000 panel. In addition to markers produced in
the frame of this project, we included in the analysis
markers already mapped in this region on IMpRH and
IMNpRH2 panels, in particular HKE4 (33.28 Mb), RAB2L
(33.37 Mb), LANO (53.77 Mb) (called previously
FLJ10775),BMP5 (55.73 Mb) and BAG2 (57.15 Mb)
[11,12]. An average retention frequency of 40% was
observed, ranging from 27% for PRIM2A to 55% for
RAB2L and HKE4. A draft 1000:1 framework map was
then built with Carthagene software [14], using a stepwise
locus adding strategy (data not shown). The robustness of
the map was tested by comparison of the likelihood of the
reference map to the likelihood of maps derived from the
reference map by all possible permutations in a window
of 6 markers and by inversion of parts of the map using
the simulated annealing algorithm. The 6 additional
genes (COL11A2, RXRb, RING1, PRIM2A, COL21A1 and
RPS18) were mapped at their most likely location relatively to markers of this preliminary framework map, considering the distance between framework markers as fixed.

At first glance, the chromosomal region in which QTL
have been mapped on SSC7 seemed identical to the p arm
of HSA6 [9,10]. A more detailed study showed that a fragment of ~3.7 Mb found at a pericentromeric location on
HSA6 is situated at 23 Mb from the expected location on
the porcine genome, precisely in the region of interest
[11,12]. This fragment was defined by three genes
(FLJ10775, BMP5 and BAG2) located close to the centromere at 56 Mb on HSA6p12.1-6p11.2 and mapped on
SSC7q11 close to RAB2L and DAXX genes localized at 33
Mb on HSA6p21.32. A preliminary physical map of this
region was proposed by Barbosa [12], but 4 limited BAC
contigs were built in this rearranged region. However, it
failed to establish a complete comparative map of this
region and to ensure that no additional fragments found
elsewhere on the human genome are located in the porcine QTL region.
We now report the building of a complete BAC map covering the whole region. This was achieved by taking
advantage of the fingerprinting of a 5.5× BAC library
(Chardon et al, in preparation), undertaken to establish
primary BAC contigs. We monitored the assembly of the
complete contig by mapping genes and markers on the
high resolution IMNpRH212000 panel, as previously done
in the Halothane region [8]. Sequence comparison of BAC
ends from this contig with the human sequence allowed
us to identify 4 BAC containing the four synteny breaking
points detected in this region. A local bovine RH map was
also established in this region to determine if the rearrangements observed on the pig genome are specific of
suines or if they occurred in an ancestral species. A multispecies comparison of this region was finally performed.

To compare the order of genes between SSC7 and HSA6,
we determined the location of these genes on the NCBI
Build 35 assembly of the human genome available at
UCSC [15]. We confirmed the insertion in pig of a large
fragment between RING1 and VPS52 genes (fragments 1
and 2), which are only 40 Kb apart on the human genome
(Figure 1A). The fragment found in pig between these two

location of the QTL of interest. At that step, it was not possible to determine whether the rearranged fragment
includes a short fragment located on the q arm of HSA6.
The first gene found on HSA6q arm also mapped on the
porcine genome, being FLJ13159 located on SSC1 [11].

genes is located on human genome close to the centromere on the HSA6p arm. The mapping of these genes on
the porcine RH map allowed us to distinguish two main
conserved fragments: one fragment containing BMP5 –
HCTR2 – Sw2019 – TINAG – LANO – GCLC (fragment 4),
and a second fragment containing DST, BAG2 and
PRIM2A (fragment 5). The order of genes is conserved
inside each fragment; however, the 2 blocks are oppositely
oriented in the porcine and human genomes. A large distance is observed between GCLC and BAG2, suggesting
that another fragment is inserted between them, possibly
a fragment called "6" in the human genome. This additional porcine fragment is particularly interesting because
it contains Sw1856, a marker mapped at the most likely

Bac contig construction
In order to confirm the rearrangements previously
observed between HSA6 (6p21.32 and 6p12.1-11.2) and
SSC7 (7q11), we built a complete BAC contig of this
region. As in previous studies, an almost complete BAC
contig of the SLA region has been developed [12], but a
gap remained to be filled precisely in this region that was
very different between the human and pig genomes. We
screened by PCR the INRA BAC library [16] using primers
defined for microsatellites Sw2019 and Sw1856, and for
the 10 following genes RING1, HSD17B8, BMP5,
HCRTR2, TINAG, LANO, GCLC, PRIM2A, BAG2 and DST.
For each of these 10 genes or 2 markers (Sw2019 and
Sw1856), we identified one positive BAC (Figure 2). To
accelerate the establishment of a complete BAC contig, we
took advantage of the availability of preliminary BAC contigs built after the fingerprinting of 72 190 BAC of the
INRA library (Chardon et al, in preparation). It appeared
that 8 of these 12 BAC were mapped in 8 different INRA
contigs (contigs 5174, 1178, 5990, 3302, 2270, 137, 236
and 1421), containing from 3 to 21 BAC (Figure 2).

In the frame of the INRA physical mapping project, 35
000 INRA BAC regularly dispersed on the INRA contigs
had been selected. The sequence of their extremities were
determined at CNS (Evry, France) and compared with the
human sequence (Chardon et al, in preparation). Analysis
of 108 porcine BES anchored on the human region
between 33 and 34 Mb, or between 53 and 64 Mb,
allowed us to identify 55 BAC located on the pig genome
in the chosen region. Among these BAC, 39 belonged to
one of the 8 INRA contigs already identified. 8 additional
BAC allowed us to identify 3 others INRA contigs (contigs
5488, 6382 and 7444) located in this same region, and
the last 8 clones correspond to BAC that had not been fingerprinted.
To fill several gaps, the INRA BAC library was screened
with markers derived from BES, and 12 additional INRA
BAC (bI0149A04, bI0474F10, bI0403D01, bI0842H05,
bI0323A08, bI0159D05, bI0438F07, bI1044F02,
bI0135F11, bI0311E12, bI0105B03 and bI0032D02)
were recruited. For BAC of interest whose BES had not
been sequenced by the CNS, we sequenced the extremities
in order to get on with the construction of the contig;
these sequences were submitted to EMBL Nucleotide
Sequence Database (AM156864 to AM156903). To fill the
remaining gaps, we selected 7 additional BAC

Markers in bold belong to the framework RH map, whereas markers in italic are positioned at the most likely location. Other markers have been

and
bT220O06) on the international BAC map (Humphrey et
al, in preparation, and [17] that were overlapping with
BAC already selected. To check for the accuracy of the global contig, new markers were developed using BES. The
overlapping of BAC derived from the different INRA contigs was tested by PCR on BAC clones (Table 1 and Figure
2).
The building of the complete BAC contig was also monitored regularly by the mapping of BAC end- markers on
the IMNpRH2 RH panel, verifying that the order of the
markers and the distances between them were consistent
with the BAC contig results. In particular, markers found
at the extremities of the 11 INRA contigs were mapped on
the RH panel. For these 19 markers, an average retention
frequency of 35% was observed. A 1000:1 framework map
was then established, including previously mapped genes
and 11 markers derived from BES. The 8 others BAC ends
were mapped at their most likely location relatively to
markers of the framework. This RH map covering 550 cR

is in total agreement with the BAC contig covering the
whole region (Figure 2).
Analysis of BAC contig
The availability of BES from BAC located between
PRIM2A (fragment 5) and GCLC (fragment 4) permitted
characterization of the intermediate fragment in which no
genes were mapped (Figure 2). All the significant homologies detected with these BES show that this fragment corresponds to fragment 6 located on HSA6 in the interval
57.50 – 63.5 Mb framing the centromere. Among BES
anchored at this human region, bI0666E01F is highly
homologous to an intron of KHDRBS2, demonstrating
the presence of the gene in this porcine region. In addition, the comparison of porcine BES produced from BAC
bI0222C06, bI0223C10 and bI0819C05 revealed that
these sequences share significant homology with 2
human fragments at a distance of 600 Kb, suggesting the
presence of duplication in the human genome. A dot-plot
of the human region 57.73 Mb-58.9 Mb on itself was performed with Dotter, using its default settings [18]. The
dot-plot showed that this region contains many large

Figure BAC contig with anchoring on porcine RH map and on human sequence after BAC end sequence analysis
Porcine 2
Porcine BAC contig with anchoring on porcine RH map and on human sequence after BAC end sequence analysis. The full contig is presented including mainly INRA BAC. Some additional BAC where recruited on the international analysis available at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Projects/S_scrofa. The black circles represent sequenced BAC ends (BES) used
for screening INRA BAC library. The white circles are BES for which a marker has been developed for a quality control of the
contig by PCR on overlapping BAC (positive results are indicated with gray circles). The black boxes represent genes and microsatellites used for screening INRA BAC library, the white boxes indicate additional BAC on which a positive result has been
obtained by PCR with these markers. Markers in bold on the RH map belong to the framework map, whereas markers in italic
are additional markers mapped at the most likely location (when two locations are as likely, the marker is indicated on the left
side of the map and its possible locations are indicated with a line). The BES for which a significant homology has been identified with sequence of HSA6 are illustrated by dotted lines. The large arrows represent the extent and the orientation of the
different fragment conserved between pig and human genomes. The small arrows in fragment 5 represent the duplication identified on the human. Finally, the white box in fragment 6 is the fragment absent on the pig genome.

repeated sequences. A fragment of 290 Kb located at 57.74
Mb-58.03 Mb is duplicated in position 58.34 Mb-58.63
Mb, and a 50 Kb fragment from 58.07 Mb to 58.12 Mb is
duplicated and turned over in position 58.73 Mb-58.77
Mb on HSA6 (results not shown). In the pig, this fragment
covers ~40 cR, which corresponds to ~380 Kb suggesting
that a single copy is present in the pig genome.

Finally, for BAC bI0688H06 and bI0046E05 mapped in
the same region, hits obtained for the two BES of both
clones were 650 Kb apart, which is not compatible with
the size of a BAC. Analysis of this human region on
ENSEMBL database [19] indicates that no porcine BES
matches the human genome between 63.05 and 63.55
Mb, whereas BES were anchored in the surrounding
region on average each 20 Kb. Altogether these results sug-

Description of the synteny breakpoints between SSC7 and HSA6. The arrows represent the various fragments of
conserved synteny. The small green arrows symbolize a human duplication of a fragment of 290 Kb. The white box represents
a fragment of 500 Kb absent in the pig. Porcine BAC spanning each breakpoint are represented with anchoring of their ends on

gest that a 500 Kb region (in which no genes have already
been identified on the human genome) is missing in the
pig genome.
From this analysis, an estimate can be made of the size of
the rearranged region on the pig genome – considering
that the size of this region on the porcine genome is similar to the size of human region also found on the porcine
genome. The sizes of the three rearranged fragments are:
~2.5 Mb for fragment 4, 1.8 Mb for fragment 5 and 0.9 Mb
for fragment 6. The whole rearranged fragment covers
thus ~5.2 Mb of the porcine genome.
To confirm the reality of the rearrangements identified
during the building of the BAC contig, we tried to identify
a porcine BAC spanning each of the 4 breakpoints, with
BES anchored on the 2 expected locations on human

genome (Figure 3). In order to increase the probability of
identifying these BAC, we also selected from the international map [17] BAC overlapping INRA BAC close to synteny breaking points. For BAC with no significant
homology, we used FASTA to detect any potential homology, using less stringent parameters. In pig, one BAC
anchored on the 2 expected human locations was identified, for the 4 breaking points A-B, C-D, E-F and G-H
(bI0149A04 (33.03 Mb – 55.93 Mb), bT0141E11 (53.48
Mb-62.48 Mb), bI0222C06 (63.7 Mb – 57.85 Mb) and
RPCI44_0428O15 (56.20 Mb – 33.35 Mb)) (Figure 3).
Analysis of the anchorage on the human map of all BES
available in these regions, allowed us to estimate more
precisely the location of the 4 breakpoints on the human
genome (Figure 3): A/H breakpoint is located at 33.26 –
33.35 Mb, I/C at 53.24 – 53.48 Mb, B/G at 55.93 – 56.01,

Multispecies comparison of the organization of the studied
region
To compare the order of genes in this region between various species, we identified the location on the genome of
sequenced species of several genes representing each chromosomal fragment described previously: fragment 1
(RXRb, RING1), fragment 2 (VPS52, RPS18 and RAB2L),
fragment 3 (ELOVL5), fragment 4 (GCLC, LANO, TINAG
and BMP5), fragment 5 (COL21A1, DST and PRIM2A),

fragment 6 (KHDRBS2) and fragment 7 (GLULD1). Their
locations were determined by blasting the porcine
sequences against current genome assemblies: mouse
sequence Build 33 assembly from NCBI, dog whole
genome shotgun (WGS) assembly v1.0 (July 2004), and
chicken galGal2 assembly. To enrich the set of data available for the chicken genome, we developed markers for
VPS52 and RAB2L which were not identified on the
sequence of chicken genome with the ESTs available for
these genes. We mapped these 2 markers on chickRH
panel [20] and analyzed the results on ChickRH server
[21].

Markers in bold belong to the framework RH map whereas markers in italic are positionned with the best likelihood. Primer sequences, retention
fraction, RH map location on bovine map and human location are indicated.

It was also important to include a species phylogenetically
close to the pig in the comparison. We selected cattle, a
species for which both detailed comparative mapping
studies have been performed [22,23] and a partial
genomic sequence is available. However, in the region of
interest, the assembly of the bovine genome is by no
means complete (each gene is found in a different scaffold
after blasting the sequence of genes mapped in pig against
the bovine genome) and available RH maps are insufficiently detailed. This led us to develop a bovine RH map
in this region. We used the ICCARE browser [13], to select
bovine EST available for 16 genes of this region: RXRb,
RING1, HKE4, HSD17B8, VPS52, RAB2L, ELOVL5,
TINAG, LANO, COL21A1, DST, BAG2, PRIM2A,
KHDRBS2, PHF3 and PTP4A1 (Table 2). We developed
pairs of primers for each gene and we mapped them on
the RH5000 bovine panel [22]. An average retention frequency of 36% was observed, ranging from 26% for
GLO1 to 50% for PTP4A1. Vectors obtained for the 16
new genes were analyzed together with 31 markers previ-

ously available for BTA23 [22]. A 1000:1 framework map
including 10 genes, was built with Carthagene software
[14] in the region from PRIM2A to VPS52 (Figure 1B). In
addition gene KHDRBS2 is linked with a LOD score 3.5 at
the top of this map. Four additional genes HSD17B8,
RXRb, RING1, and HKE4 were found totally linked and
mapped at their most likely location relatively to markers
of the framework (Figure 1B). ELOVL5 was found linked
to markers previously mapped in a distal position. PHF3
and PTP4A1 were found significantly linked together
(LOD = 13.2), but totally unlinked to other genes.
In the dog genome, all the selected genes are grouped into
two large fragments (fragments 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and fragments 1 and 2) located on chromosome 12 (Figure 4). In
the mouse genome, the same region is similarly split into
3 conserved fragments (Figure 4): fragments 5, 6 and 7 are
located on MMU1; fragments 3 and 4 on MMU9; and fragments 1 and 2 on MMU17. In chicken, a conserved fragment containing fragments 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 is located on

Page 11 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:13

GGA3. Two other genes, VPS52 and RAB2L (fragment 2),
are mapped in a linkage group that also contains markers
derived from chicken MHC region located on GGA16
(Figure 4). No information is available for RXRB and
RING1 (fragment 1). If the order of genes is thus globally
conserved in these species, a very different situation is
observed on the bovine genome (Figure 4): 14 of the 16
selected genes are localized on BTA23, but in an order very
different from the generally conserved order, and 2 others
genes (PHF3 and PTP4A1 representing fragment 7) are
located on chromosome 9.
The analysis of these results shows that the whole fragment (comprising fragments 4, 5 and 6) inserted on the
pig genome between fragments 1 and 2 (RING1 and
VPS52) seems very well conserved in chicken, dog, mouse
and human. In cattle and pig, belonging both to the clade
of Cetartiodactyles, fragments 4, 5 and 6 are found at a different location. However, in this 5.2 Mb large fragment, a
total conservation of gene order was observed between
human and cattle genomes. A global analysis of the chromosomal rearrangements that occurred during evolution
was carried out using GRIMM. [24]. The results obtained
are summarized on Figure 4.

Discussion
The study of porcine chromosome 7 is of particular interest due to the presence of many QTL affecting traits of economic importance and of MHC [1,2]. One approach to
study this chromosome is to identify all the genes located
on this chromosome and to compare their order relatively
to that in the human genome. Previously, a strong conservation of gene order was found between a large fragment
of porcine SSC7 and human HSA6 p arm [9,10]. We had
highlighted the existence of a fragment estimated to be
less than 4 Mb rearranged between SSC7 and HSA6 [11].
This fragment defined by 3 genes (LANO previously
named FLJ10775, BMP5 and BAG2) located on
HSA6p12.1-6p11.2 is found in the pig genome between
genes located on HSA6p21.32 [11]. The building of a BAC
contig in the chromosomal region surrounding SLA complex provided additional information, even if the contig
remained incomplete [12]. This study describes a situation that is even more complex, suggesting the presence of
VPS52 (previously named SACM2L) within the rearranged region. In the pig genome, this rearranged chromosomal region is included in the region where the QTL
of interest is mapped, between markers Sw1856 and NFY
(Demeure et al, JAS, in press). In order to identify all candidate genes that may be responsible for the QTL effects,
it was particularly important to establish a detailed comparative mapping analysis of this region.
We first built a dense porcine RH map (Figure 1A) using
the high resolution IMNpRH212000rad panel, allowing us

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/13

to order unambiguously genes at distances of 100 to 600
Kb [7]. Our data confirmed the shift of the rearranged
fragment and its precise location in the pig genome
between RING1 and VPS52 genes (previously called
SACM2L) (fragments 1 and 2). In contrast to Barbosa et al
[12], we show that VPS52 is located close to RAB2L in
both species. We also determined more precisely the
extent of the fragment rearranged between the human and
pig genomes. The upper frontier of this fragment is
located between ELOVL5 (previously named HELO1) and
GCLC, located respectively at 53.28 and 53.43 Mb on
HSA6. The lower boundary of the fragment is defined by
the first gene located on HSA6q also mapped on SSC1.
This first gene was previously designated as FLJ13159, and
was located at 71.53 Mb on HSA6 [11]. We showed that
GLULD1, located at 64.05 Mb on HSA6, also mapped on
SSC1 and constitutes the limit currently identified in this
fragment.
The gene-based RH map (Figure 1A) that we built allowed
us to define 3 sub-fragments of this region arranged differently on the pig and human genomes. Two of these subfragments are delimited by genes: BMP5 and GCLC for the
first one (fragment 4), and PRIM2A and COL21A1 for the
second (fragment 5). No genes were identified in the third
fragment (fragment 6), which contains the anonymous
microsatellite Sw1856. This map greatly refines the internal rearrangements suggested by our previous work [11].
The sum of the sizes of fragments 4 and 5 is ~4.3 Mb and
is similar to the orthologous human region. Fragment 6
covers 1.4 Mb in the human map, whereas the size of this
fragment in the porcine RH map suggests a size of approximately 900 Kb which would indicate that a fragment of
500 Kb is absent in the porcine genome. The fragment
containing Sw1856 on the pig genome might thus be
orthologous to part of the region flanking the centromere
of HSA6, but at that step it remained to be proved (Figure
1A).
To confirm the order of genes suggested by RH mapping
and study this region in more detail, we built a contig of
BAC covering the entire region (Figure 2). The availability
of elementary contigs resulting from the fingerprinting of
clones from the INRA BAC library and sequences of
extremities of 35000 of these BAC (BES) (Chardon et al,
in preparation) greatly facilitated the establishment of this
complete contig. Our work completes the studies begun
by Barbosa et al [12], who presented 4 small contigs. The
analysis of porcine BES anchoring on the human genome
demonstrates that the fragment 6 containing porcine
marker Sw1856 corresponds to a fragment framing the
centromere of HSA6 (6p11.1-6q11.1). Taking into
account the average distance between two hits of porcine
BES on human genome, we can say that if additional fragments from other human chromosomes are located in

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:13

this rearranged region of the porcine genome, they should
measure <50 Kb.
Analysis of the anchoring of porcine BES on the human
genome highlighted also additional results: 1) It was
indeed possible to define the position of the 3 synteny
breakpoints (Figure 3). On the human genome, these synteny breakpoints (A-H, I-C and B-G) are situated between
genes RING1-VPS52, ELOVL5-GCLC and BMP5COL21A1. Each of these 3 synteny breakpoints are localized in a interval of ~100–200 Kb, between the human
positions 33.26 Mb-33.35 Mb, 53.24 Mb-53.48 Mb and
55.93 Mb-56.01 Mb. 2) The fourth synteny breakpoint (EF on the pig genome and F-D on the human genome) was
identified thanks to the anchoring of the BES in the
human genome: the two fragments framing HSA6 centromere were found in a different order on the pig genome
without the presence of a centromere (Figure 3). 3) For
several BES, alignment on the human genome showed 2
possible positions with similar likelihood. This result suggested the existence of duplicated sequences close to the
human centromere, which was confirmed by a dot plot on
itself of the sequence of this human region. Phylogeny
studies of human chromosome 6 demonstrated the repositioning of this centromere among primate species in a
region equivalent to 6p22.1 in Eulemur macaco, Callithrix
jacchus and Lagothrix lagothrica, to 6q22 in Macaca fascicularis and Presbytis cristata, and to 6p12 in the great apes
[25]. The repeated sequences we highlighted might then
correspond to sequences of an ancestral centromere positioned in HSA6p22.1 [25]. 4) Lastly, in silico analysis of
the BES alignments on the human genome provided evidence of the absence from the pig genome of a fragment
of ~400–500 Kb found in human genome. One can argue
that the 2 BES of BAC bI0688H06 match on the human
genome with sequences distant of 650 Kb (at 63.02 Mb
and 63.67 Mb). The absence of anchoring of other BES
between 63.05 Mb and 63.55 Mb, whereas one hit is
found for each 20 Kb in the surrounding region, confirmed that this fragment is absent from the pig genome.
This region appears to be heavily rearranged between the
porcine and human genomes. We wanted to determine if
these rearrangements are specific of suines or Cetartiodactyles, or occur in many other species. To identify gene
order in other species, we used the genomic sequence
when available. For Gallus gallus, the assembly of the
genome has not been totally completed; this is why we
enriched information obtained from the sequence by RH
mapping data when it was necessary (Figure 4). The order
of genes seems to be conserved between the chicken and
human genomes except for the RXRb and RING1 genes
(belonging to fragment 1). These 2 genes which may not
exist in the chicken genome are located in other species in
the extended class II region of MHC. The chicken MHC,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/13

named the B locus, is a 92 Kb DNA sequence containing
19 genes [26,27]. It defines a minimal essential set of
MHC genes conserved over 200 million years of divergence between birds and mammals [27].
As the available assembly of the cow genome consists of
many independent sequence scaffolds, we determined the
gene order by RH mapping [22] (Figure 1B). Our results
reveal that genes from GCLC to KHDRBS2 (fragments 4, 5
and 6) are similarly ordered on the human and bovine
genomes in this region, which suggests that the internal
rearrangements of these 3 fragments, comparing the
human and porcine genomes, are specific to the evolution
of the suine family. Everts-van der Wind et al. [18]
reported that 12 cattle chromosomes are entirely similar
to a complete human chromosome arm, and in particular,
that p and q arms of HSA6 are homologs of BTA23 and
BTA9. Our study modifies slightly this report, in that
KHDRBS2 (belonging to fragment 6), the first gene localized on the long arm of human chromosome 6, is probably located on bovine chromosome 23. As the number of
genes in this region, as in other species, is very limited; it
is difficult to develop and map markers in this region. The
end of BTA23 might thus signal the location of the centromere in the ancestors of Cetartiodactyles, in which the fission between the 2 chromosomal arms occurred. In this
region, a further comparison of the bovine genomic
sequence with the human sequence will be of interest.
We compared the gene order in the pig (Sus scrofa) and
cattle (Bos Taurus) with the situation in the genomic
sequence of Mus musculus, Canis familiaris, Gallus gallus
and Homo sapiens (Figure 4). We observed at first that on
the pig genome, a large fragment (comprising fragments
4, 5 and 6) of ~5.2 Mb is shifted between RING1 and
VPS52, 2 genes belonging to the extended class II region
of the MHC. If MHC is one of the most dynamic regions
of the genome [28], a high level of conservation of
genome organization provides evidence in this region of
extended class II genes [29]. Fourteen genes occur in this
region between RING1 and the VPS52 in dog, cat, human
and mouse genomes, which only differs in the presence of
processed pseudogenes [29]. This small fragment of 500
Kb containing RING1 and VPS52 is thus dynamically
involved in chromosomal evolution. It is interesting to
note that the translocation of the 5.2 Mb fragment occurs
in this region. In this region, the genomic organization of
the fragment and its flanking regions is similar in mouse,
human, dog and chicken, whereas translocation is
observed in pig and cattle. This suggests that this genomic
reorganization occurred after the divergence of the common ancestor of Cetartiodactyles from the Ferungulates
ancestor between 94 to 62 million years ago [30]. The
gene order observed in pig for the 5.2 Mb fragment is different from the one identified in other species, indicating

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:13

that these internal rearrangements occurred after ruminant-suine speciation. We identified a situation really different from the map presented by Everts-van der Wind et
al. for the proximal part of BTA23 close to the centromere
[23]. Further study of the rearrangements that occurred in
ruminants in this region of extended class II of the MHC
complex is clearly needed.
We used GRIMM to compare the different maps available
and to present a possible evolution of this region between
the various species [24]. The unrooted tree we obtained
(Figure 4) presents a very different view from a classical
phylogenic tree [31,32], highlighting a high rate of rearrangements in this region that have occurred recently in
Cetartiodactyles. The study of local rearrangements also
provides a view different from the recent multispecies
comparison of this region [33]. In order to filter out noise
induced by mapping errors, this analysis from Murphy et
al only took into account fragments >3 Mb, defined by
three genes. Among other results, they documented the
reuse of evolutionary breakpoint regions identified
between conserved homologous synteny blocks. Our
study indicates that such a study should be redone on a
more detailed scale, when the accuracy of mapping data is
adequate.

Conclusion
A QTL affecting fattening and growth had been mapped in
the porcine region SSC 7q1.2. As we had shown that a
small fragment is translocated between porcine and
human genome, it was important to establish a final comparative map of this region. The RH map and the BAC
contig we developed in this region allowed us to attest
that the translocated fragment is approximately 5.2 Mb
long. It consists in three blocks, found in HSA6 between
53.45 and 63.5 Mb, one of these blocks containing a few
genes, framing the centromere on the human chromosome. The multispecies study allowed us to confirm that
the translocation of this 5.2 Mb fragment occurred in the
common ancestor of pig and ruminants, whereas internal
rearrangements are found only in the pig genome. The
exact knowledge of the genomic content of this region
permits us now to establish a list of all possible candidate
genes that may affect the growth and fattening of pigs.

Methods
Markers and PCR amplification
The ICCARE (Interspecific Comparative Clustering and
Annotation foR Ests) tool available at [13] allowed us to
select 16 genes in the region between RXRB and RAB2L,
for which a porcine EST sequence is available (Table 1). In
addition, 88 markers have been developed from INRA
BAC ends. Several result from personal sequencing using
the BigDye Terminator V3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems) on the ABI 3700 automatic sequencer; these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/13

sequences were submitted to EMBL Nucleotide Sequence
Database (AM156864 to AM156903) [34]. Others come
from BAC ends sequences available on ENSEMBL [19].
Primers have been chosen using Primer3 software [35].
PCR was performed in a 15 µl reaction volume containing
25 ng template DNA, 200 µM dNTP, 0.25 µM specific
primer pair and 0.5 U Taq polymerase (GoTAQ) in the
reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Amplifications were carried out on a Gene-Amp System 9700
(Applied Biosystems) thermocycler. Thermal cycling
parameters were defined as follows: denaturation at 94°C
for 5 min, followed by 32 cycles of (1) 94°C for 45 sec, (2)
annealing temperature for 45 sec, (3) 72°C for 45 sec, and
a final extension was performed at 72°C for 5 min. PCR
products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, and visualized after ethidium bromide staining.
RH mapping
Markers were mapped on the IMpRH panel [6] and
IMNpRH2 panel [7] according to the INRA protocols. For
markers used on IMpRH panel, vectors were submitted to
the IMpRH web server at [36] for an initial two-point
assignment. Then, vectors obtained on IMpRH and
IMNpRH2 were analyzed with Carthagene software [14].
A 1000:1 framework map was built with buildfw option
using a stepwise locus adding strategy under an haploid
model of fragment retention. The different provisional
frameworks were checked using the simulated annealing
algorithm to test inversion of the map fragments, and the
flips algorithm to test all local permutations in a window
of 6 markers. The resulting RH map was drawn with Mapchart 2.0 [37]. An RH map was also established for the
bovine genome using the bovine RH panel RH5000 [22].
Several markers were also mapped on the chicken genome
using ChickRH6 panel [20].
BAC screening and chromosome walking
The INRA BAC porcine library [12], was screened by PCR
on BAC super pools and pools. The presence of the
expected sequence in the identified BAC was checked by
PCR on DNA from the isolated BAC clone. For the
selected BAC that had been previously fingerprinted and
incorporated in a primary INRA contig (Chardon et al in
preparation), all BAC from this contig were selected from
INRA BAC Server [38]. To confirm the BAC overlapping,
markers developed from BES were tested against DNA of
BAC belonging to its primary contig or BAC located at the
extremities of adjacent contigs.
Multispecies comparison
In order to determine genes order in other species, 12
genes (RXRB, RING1, VPS52, RAB2L, ELOVL5, GCLC,
BMP5, COL21A1, DST, PRIM2A, KHDBRS2, GLULD1)
were located with Blast in human by using NCBI build 35

tree.
