Abstract
Background: Certain eukaryotic genomes, such as those of the amitochondriate parasites Giardia
and Trichomonas, have very low intron densities, so low that canonical spliceosomal introns have
only recently been discovered through genome sequencing. These organisms were formerly
thought to be ancient eukaryotes that diverged before introns originated, or at least became
common. Now however, they are thought to be members of a supergroup known as excavates,
whose members generally appear to have low densities of canonical introns. Here we have used
environmental expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing to identify 17 genes from the uncultivable
oxymonad Streblomastix strix, to survey intron densities in this most poorly studied excavate group.
Results: We find that Streblomastix genes contain an unexpectedly high intron density of about 1.1
introns per gene. Moreover, over 50% of these are at positions shared between a broad spectrum
of eukaryotes, suggesting theyare very ancient introns, potentially present in the last common
ancestor of eukaryotes.
Conclusion: The Streblomastix data show that the genome of the ancestor of excavates likely
contained many introns and the subsequent evolution of introns has proceeded very differently in
different excavate lineages: in Streblomastix there has been much stasis while in Trichomonas and
Giardia most introns have been lost.

Background
One of the prominent features that distinguishes eukaryotic genomes from those of prokaryotes is the presence of
spliceosomal introns. Introns are intervening sequences
that are removed from expressed RNAs, in the case of spliceosomal introns through a series of transesterfications
mediated by a large riboprotein complex called the spliceosome [1]. Spliceosomal introns are only known from
eukaryotic nuclear genomes, and were the subject of
intense controversy over their potential role in early gene
origins and evolution, the so-called introns early versus

late debate [2-4]. One of the interesting features of intron
evolution that came to light during this debate was the
large range in intron density. At one extreme, introns
appeared to be lacking in several protist lineages that
were, at the time, thought to be the earliest-branching
eukaryotes. These lineages included diplomonads (e.g.,
Giardia) and parabasalia (e.g. Trichomonas).
The early-branching status of these organisms has since
been undermined by a variety of data, and now diplomonads and parabasalia are thought to be part of a large

assemblage of protists called excavates, which also
includes trypanosomes, euglenids, and a number of parasitic and free living flagellate or amoeboflagellate lineages
[5]. However, despite the accumulation of a considerable
quantity of molecular data from both Giardia and Trichomonas, as well as the identification of proteins involving splicing in Trichomonas [6], evidence for introns in
their genomes remained intriguingly elusive. Indeed, only
recently were introns finally characterized in these organisms [7-9], and remain extremely rare. Only three introns
have been found in G. intestinalis among thousands of
known genes [8,9] and forty-one introns were identified
in the T. vaginalis genome after exhaustive searches [7].
Information from excavates other than Trichomonas and
Giardia is scarce, but overall there seems to be a generally
low density of introns (with the possible exception of
Jakobid flagellates based on one family of genes[10]).
Moreover, other instances of non-canonical introns and
splicing are known in excavates [11-13], as are systems
where splicing machinery is put to a slightly different use
such as trans-splicing [14-16].
One of the excavate groups about which we know very little are the oxymonads. Oxymonads are anaerobic flagellates found almost exclusively in association with
animals, many in the guts of termites and wood-eating
roaches [17]. This is the only group of amitochondriates
for which secondary loss of mitochondria has not been
yet demonstrated, but they are closely related to the flagellate Trimastix, which has a vestigial organelle, so a primary lack of mitochondria in oxymonads is unlikely.
Mostoxymonads are not available in culture because they
live in complex communities with other protists and
prokaryotes. As a result, there are few molecular data
available from any oxymonad, and no introns have been
identified [18]. The oxymonad Streblomastix strix is asymbiont of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis angusticollis
from North American Pacific coastal region. This species
has a number of unusual morphological characters,
including a peculiar long slender cell shape with deep longitudinal vanes which is apparently maintained by intimate association with epibiotic bacteria [19], So far, many
copies of four genes (alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, HSP90,
and elongation factor-1 alpha) have been characterized
from S. strix [18], and the complete absence of introns
from all sequences (a total of 19,888 bp) suggests the oxymonads might share low intron densities apparently common to excavates. Here, we have used the recent
documentation of a rare non-canonical genetic code in
Streblomastix [18] to identify 17 oxymonad genes from an
environmental expressed sequence tag (EST) pool from
the hindgut of Zootermopsis. The genomic DNA sequence
for each mRNA was determined and we found that, in
contrast to other amitochondriate protists and the limited
data previously available for Streblomastix, a relatively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/34

high density of canonical spliceosomal introns. Moreover,
a large proportion of these introns are shared in position
with other distantly related eukaryotes, suggesting that
they are ancient intron positions retained in oxymonads
but lost in other excavates such as Giardia and Trichomonas.

Results and discussion
Identification of oxymonad sequences from ESTs
A total of 5,337 ESTs from a Z. angusticollis termite hindgut cDNAlibrary were sequenced and found to form 2,595
clusters of unique sequences. Overall, the sample was
dominated by sequences of parabasalian origin (transcripts encoding parabasalian actin and actin-related proteins alone represented 32% of all ESTs). Moreover, there
are few oxymonad sequences known outside this sample,
so Streblomastix cDNAs could not be identified based on
similarity to known genes (only 2 ESTs, corresponding to
known Streblomastix alpha- and beta-tubulin sequences,
were identified by BLASTX searches). Accordingly, we
used the presence of a rare non-canonical genetic code in
Streblomastix as a filter to identify at least those genes
where non-canonical codons were sampled. In Streblomastix, TAA and TAG encode glutamine (Q) rather than stop
as in the universal code [18], so all clusters were compared
to public databases using BLASTX and examined individually for in frame stop codons, in particular at positions
normally encoding glutamine. No other protist known to
exist in Z. angusticollis has been shown to possess a noncanonical genetic code. The other prominent protists in
this insect are parabasalia, which are not known to deviate
from the universal genetic code and whose sequences are
also easy to identify with BLASTX searches given their high
similarity with T. vaginalis genomic sequences.

Using the non-canonical code as a filter, we were able to
identify 17 protein-coding genes (Table 1), representing a
major increase in the available sequence data from oxymonads. Formerly partial sequences of 4 protein coding
genes were known from Streblomastix, and a handful of
cDNAs were known from other species [18,20,21]. From
this sample we recovered 8 complete protein-coding
genes, an additional 5 genes missing only 1 to 30 codons
at the N-terminus, and another three lacking from 100 to
160 codons at the N-terminus. In addition, a short fragment encoding 258 codons of the large protein UPF1 was
severely truncated, but we failed to obtain more sequence.
Complete or near-complete sequences included five ribosomal proteins (RPS7 and 9, RPL4, 18 and 21), alpha- and
beta-tubulin, the nuclear transporter Ntf2, cyclophilin, a
peptidyl-isomerase involved in assisting protein folding,
and NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. Also, two
versions of the cystein-protease Cathepsin B were
obtained. Although related, these sequences exhibited
several differences at the amino acid level, so they are

incomplete sequences, the number of missing amino acids were estimated from homologues from Giardia and/or Trichomonas. UPF1
shows extensive size variation among eukaryotic lineages (between 800 and 1600 amino acids, approximately), so it is difficult to
determine how much sequence this fragment is lacking. ND: not determined.

likely to represent multiples copies of the gene. We also
identified two copies of the carbon metabolism enzyme
pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), the functional and
evolutionary significance of which are discussed elsewhere [22]. One conserved hypothetical protein was also
found to use the Streblomastix genetic code. This protein
has homologues in diverse eukaryotes (e.g. Arabidopsis
thaliana AAM67532), buthas no assigned function. UPF1
is a key member of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).
This protein may be of interest in Streblomastix because it
is involved in a mechanism of mRNA surveillance devoted
to eliminating defective transcripts, such as those carrying
premature stop codons [23]. NMD has been described
and studied in animals and yeasts, but not yet found in
protists [24]. The presence of UPF1 in Streblomastix suggests NMD is used by oxymonads, and in organisms
where stop codons are reassigned to encode amino acids.
Finally, UAP56 is a member of the DEAD box family of
RNA helicases that is associated with the spliceosome and
intervenes in early steps of pre-mRNA splicing in mammals and yeasts, but is also linked to mRNA export
[25,26]. Even in the absence of introns, the presence of
UAP56 indicates the likely presence of the spliceosome in
oxymonads, and therefore by extension introns as well.
Introns in Streblomastix genes
Genomic DNA sequences were obtained for all Streblomastix coding regions identified from the cDNA library.
Despite the fact that many alleles and loci representing
four proteins were previously found to contain no
introns, we found that most of the genes encoding these

transcripts were interrupted by introns. In total, we found
21 introns in our sample of 17 genes with genes having as
many as 5 introns (Table 1). Including previously known
intronless EF-1 alpha and HSP90 genes (alpha and beta
tubulin are included in our sample) [18], the overall density is 1.1 introns per gene. However this is likely to be an
underestimation since some of our sequences are truncated and could contain further introns, and there is a bias
favouring genes that are more often intronless (e.g.
HSP90). This density is less than that observed in the relatively intron-rich mammals and plants, but comparable
to many other eukaryotic genomes, and certainly much
higher than Giardia and Trichomonas where only 3 and 41
introns have been detected despite very large quantities of
genomic data [7,9].
Overall, the Streblomastix introns were found to exhibit
characteristics typical of eukaryotic spliceosomal introns.
Introns ranged from 46 to 229 bases (Table 2), but most
were between 60 and 100 bases long, and the AT content
was markedly higher than that of the coding sequence
(Table 2). Spliceosomal introns are flanked by GT and AG
dinucleotides in the vast majority of known introns, while
about 0.1% are U12 AT-AC introns[27] and a very small
proportion of known introns use other non-canonical
splice boundaries. Interestingly, however, the first of only
three introns from G. intestinalis to be discovered has CUAG boundaries [8]. Of the twenty-one introns from Streblomastix, 20 featured canonical GT-AG boundaries, but
one intron in rps9 was flanked by AC-AG splice sites.
However, the Streblomastix intron is located very close to

the start of the transcript, so we cannot exclude the possibility that this intron sequence is incomplete and a canonical boundary lies upstream.
We also inspected intron sequences to look for conserved
features that may correspond to functional motifs.
Although signals important for intron recognition and
removal are not very well understood, some have been
studied in certain detail, especially in mammals and
yeasts. The branch-point is a sequence element required
for lariat formation during splicing [28]. The mammalian
branch point consensus sequence has been determined to
be CURAY, where the A corresponds to the actual branching point. In yeast, the branch point sequence is more
strictly defined as UACUAAC [29]. The plant branch point
appears to be similar to that of mammals [30]. In all cases,
the branch point is located near the 3' splice site, but the
exact location varies. In contrast, the putative branch
point found in the three introns of Giardia (ACURAC) is
located directly adjacent to the 3' splice site [9]. Likewise,
the potential branch points in Trichomonas are invariably
ACUAAC and are also adjacent to the 3' splice site [7]. The
apparently strict requirement for proximity between the
branch point and 3' splice site is rare in metazoa and
yeast, but common to Trichomonas and Giardia. This led to
the suggestion that the branch point and 3' splice site recognition could be combined in these species [7]. Aligning
the regions around the 5' splice site of all Streblomastix

introns (Figure 1) reveals highly conserved A, U and G residues at positions +3 to +5, respectively. This is in good
agreement with the first 5 positions of the yeast 5' splice
site (typically GUAUGU), suggesting that interaction with
U1 snRNA is conserved. At the 3' splice site no branch
point motifs like those of Giardia or Trichomonas were
observed, although the -1 position (adjacent to the AG
dinucleotide) was invariably a pyrimidine and the region
is T-rich. Overall, branch point specification in Streblomastix introns is probably different from that of Giardia or Trichomonas. Under the assumption that these lineages are
related it is possible that the peculiar features observed in
Giardia and Trichomonas may be a consequence of secondary implification in their spliceosomal apparatus.
Conservation of intron positions in oxymonad genes
Streblomastix intron-containing genes were compared to
homologues from other eukaryotes, and surprisingly
more than half of the Streblomastix intron positions were
shared with members of at least two different eukaryotic
supergroups, unikonts and plants (where the best sampling of intron-containing genes exists), and in one case
also with a chromalveolate (for six examples, see Figure
2). This suggests these are relatively ancient introns and
perhaps date back to the last common ancestor of all
eukaryotes. This degree of conservation is high, taking
into account data such as those of Rogozin et al., who calculated that approximately 20% of the introns in Plasmo-

dium are shared by at least one of the other genomes
analysed (Human, Anopheles, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis,
Arabidopsis, Schizosaccharomyces and Saccharomyces), and
that 25% of the human introns are shared by Arabidopsis
[31]. It is also possible that shared intron positions are
due to independent gains, but it is very unlikely that the
observed level of shared positions (about 50%) resulted
from parallel gains, in particular in the many cases where
the intron is found in several of the major lineages of
eukaryotes. Whether intron gains or losses predominate
in eukaryotic evolution is still a subject of controversy.
Recently, several studies using different analytic
approaches and datasets addressed this question with varied results, but in all cases, they show that ancestral conservation accounts for the large majority of shared
positions [32-36]. The degree of conservation observed in
Streblomastix intron positions suggests two things. First, it
suggests that the ancestor of excavates was relatively
intron rich and retained a large number of ancient introns,
many of which were subsequently lost in the genomes
where we have the most information, such as trypano-

somes, Giardia and Trichomonas. This assumes the relationship between oxymonads and other hypothesized
excavates is correct, but this is not certain and oxymonads
lack the morphological trait used to define excavates (the
ventral groove). However, other ultrastructural characters
[37] as well as molecular phylogenies have shown a close
affiliation between oxymonads and Trimastix [38], a free
living flagellate that does have excavate characteristics
[5,39]. Multi-gene phylogenies also lend additional support for a common origin of the lineages leading to oxymonads, diplomonads and parabasalia [21]. The second
implication of this data is that intron gain and loss have
taken place very slowly in the lineage leading up to Streblomastix: if intron turnover were rapid, then we would
expect a low proportion of ancient introns to remain
unless ancient intron positions were under some selection
to be retained. While this is probably true in a few individual cases where introns have acquired some function in
the control of gene expression, there is presently no evidence either for or against this as a common feature of
ancient introns. None of these shared introns are known

from either Giardia or Trichomonas, so any potential function is clearly dispensable, although it is interesting to
note that the rps9 intron 1 has been retained by the G.
theta nucleomorph, which is very intron poor, having kept
a total of only 17 introns [40].

Conclusion
The present sampling of protein-coding gene sequences
from Streblomastix suggests that oxymonad genomes contain a relatively large number of canonical splicesomal
introns, many of which are at ancient conserved positions.
This is in contrast to the better studied excavate genomes
such as those of kinetoplastids, Giardia and Trichomonas
where canonical spliceosomal introns are either rare or
have been co-opted in specific ways, such as the spliced
leaders in euglenozoa. The fact that many Streblomastix
introns are ancient shows that the genome of the ancestor
of these organisms, and indeed probably all extant
eukaryotes, contained many introns and that the intronpoor state found in Giardia and Trichomonas is more likely
independently derived.

Methods
cDNA library construction and EST sequencing
Termites were collected from a rotten log in Point Grey,
Vancouver, Canada. The whole hindgut content of about
60 individuals of Zootermopsis angusticollis from a single
colony was collected and total RNA was extracted using
TRIZOL (Invitrogen). A directionally cloned cDNA library
was constructed (Amplicon Express) and 5,337 clones
were sequenced from the 5' end. ESTs were trimmed for
vector and quality, and assembled into clusters by PEPdb
http://amoebidia.bcm.umontreal.ca/public/pepdb/
agrm.php.
Identification and genomic characterisation of
Streblomastix genes
Streblomastix sequences were recovered from EST data by
identifying protein coding sequences containing in-frame
TAA and TAG stop codons. Putatively stop-coding containing mRNAs were re-sequenced in both strands. In
cases where cDNA clones were truncated, the sequences
were extended by means of 3' and 5' RACE (Ambion)
using total termite hindgut RNA. The genomic sequence
for each mRNA was amplified using specific primers corresponding to the ends of each complete or partial cDNA
and PCR-amplified using genomic DNA purified from the
termite hindgut content. All PCR products were cloned
using TOPO and sequenced both strands. Accession numbers for new sequences are [genbankDQ363664,
