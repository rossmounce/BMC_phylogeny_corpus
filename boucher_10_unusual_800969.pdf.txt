Unusual duplication of the insulin-like receptor in
the crustacean Daphnia pulex
Philippe Boucher1*, Delphine Ditlecadet2, Caroline Dubé1, France Dufresne1*

Abstract
Background: The insulin signaling pathway (ISP) has a key role in major physiological events like carbohydrate
metabolism and growth regulation. The ISP has been well described in vertebrates and in a few invertebrate
model organisms but remains largely unexplored in non-model invertebrates. This study is the first detailed
genomic study of this pathway in a crustacean species, Daphnia pulex.
Results: The Daphnia pulex draft genome sequence assembly was scanned for major components of the ISP with
a special attention to the insulin-like receptor. Twenty three putative genes are reported. The pathway appears to
be generally well conserved as genes found in other invertebrates are present. Major findings include a lower
number of insulin-like peptides in Daphnia as compared to other invertebrates and the presence of multiple
insulin-like receptors (InR), with four genes as opposed to a single one in other invertebrates. Genes encoding for
the Dappu_InR are likely the result of three duplication events and bear some unusual features. Dappu_InR-4 has
undergone extensive evolutionary divergence and lacks the conserved site of the catalytic domain of the receptor
tyrosine kinase. Dappu_InR-1 has a large insert and lacks the transmembranal domain in the b-subunit. This
domain is also absent in Dappu_InR-3. Dappu_InR-2 is characterized by the absence of the cystein-rich region.
Real-time q-PCR confirmed the expression of all four receptors. EST analyses of cDNA libraries revealed that the
four receptors were differently expressed under various conditions.
Conclusions: Duplications of the insulin receptor genes might represent an important evolutionary innovation in
Daphnia as they are known to exhibit extensive phenotypic plasticity in body size and in the size of defensive
structures in response to predation.

Background
The insulin signaling pathway is evolutionary well conserved among multicellular organisms. In humans and
higher vertebrates, signaling through the insulin pathway
is critical for the regulation of intracellular and blood
glucose levels and has a pivotal importance in metabolic
diseases, such as diabetes, and cellular process such as
ageing [1-3]. It is also well recognized as a major regulator of growth in both vertebrates and invertebrates and
can also trigger diapause and regulate ageing in invertebrates [4-8].
The insulin signaling pathway is initiated by the secretion of insulin like peptides (ILPs), in response to

elevated glucose and amino acid levels [9]. Binding of
ILP initiates a complex cascade of events, starting with
phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the
insulin/IGF-like receptors (InR) [10]. Once activated,
these receptors phosphorylate a number of docking proteins; the best characterized are the insulin receptor
substrate (IRS/Chico) proteins [11]. IRS interact with
other intracellular signaling molecules primarily through
src homology 2 (SH2) domains leading to the activation
of several downstream pathways. These in turn coordinate and regulate vesicle trafficking, protein synthesis,
and glucose uptake [12]. The InR and its substrates,
therefore, constitute the first critical node in the insulin
signaling network and thus define the full set of proteins
that are tyrosine phosphorylated upon ILP stimulation.
The InR belongs to an ancient transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily [13]. Unlike the
other members of the RTK family, the InR forms a

tetramer of two extracellular alpha (a) subunits, linked
by disulphide bonds to two beta (b) subunits, which
pass through the cell membrane and have intracellular
tyrosine kinase domains. Both a and b chains are
synthesized from a single mRNA with a variable number
of exons [14]. Although there is an exceptional evolutionary conservatism in the function and components of
insulin signaling pathway, major changes have occurred
between vertebrates and invertebrates in the beginning
of the pathway. First, the early duplication events in vertebrates gave rise to specialized receptors, the insulin
receptor, the type 1 insulin growth factor receptor
(IGF1R) and the insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR)
[15]. The primary function of the insulin receptor is to
control blood sugar homeostasis while the IGF1R promotes pre and post-natal growth. These receptors show
a relatively high specificity with their respective ligand
[16]. The IRR is called an orphan receptor as the ligand
and its biological function is still unknown.
The insulin signaling pathway has been extensively
characterized in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster
and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and partially
described for a large variety of invertebrates from
sponges to insects [17-21]. Recent studies have revealed
that invertebrates possess many more insulin-like peptides than expected, up to 37 in C. elegans [22].
Although there are numerous insulin-like peptides in
invertebrates, only one insulin/IGF receptor homolog
has been described to date in all of them (but two distinct IR homologs have been found in the parasite trematode Schistosoma mansoni [23]). In this study, we
report for the first time, the presence of four InR homologs in Daphnia pulex (Crustacea, Cladocera). Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the four receptors belong
to the insulin receptor family. We discuss the evolutionary significance of the duplications and highlight the significance of these results for the biology of this species.

Results
Analyses of the newly sequenced D. pulex genome, the
first crustacean draft genome sequence, allowed us to
identify key components of the insulin pathway. The
D. pulex genome includes 25 putative genes belonging to
the insulin signaling pathway, which include all major
components of this signaling system. Daphnia pulex
appears to have a relatively low number of insulin-like
peptides as compared to other invertebrates but has four
putative insulin-like receptors. (Table 1). The rest of the
pathway appears similar to what is known from other
invertebrates with no appearance of duplication (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analyses of the receptors

Phylogenetic relationships of Dappu_InR1-R4 with various invertebrate and vertebrate InR were investigated.

Page 2 of 11

Tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of diverse RTK and InR
were aligned using MUSCLE 3.7 and the alignments
were refined with Gblocks 0.91b which eliminates poorly
aligned positions and divergent regions in order to focus
on unambiguously aligned residues. The RTK and InR
alignments used in the phylogenetic analyses included
187 amino acids, which represent 63% of the original
295 positions. Overall, there were 30 conserved positions and 122 parsimony informative sites.
The ML and Bayesian analyses of the InR using the
RTKs of the mouse EGFR as outgroup recovered the
phylogenetic tree (ML: - logL = 4403.76) shown in figure 2. The trees were generally reliable, consisting of
five major clusters namely porifera, nematodes, molluscs, deuterostomes, and arthropods. The main difference between the phylogenies produced by maximum
likelihood and bayesian were branch lengths and the
position of Ciona intestinalis that branched with Drosophila under maximum likelihood but not under Bayesian analyses. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the
monophyly of the four Daphnia insulin’s receptors suggesting an origin through duplication events. The fourth
InR was found to have undergone extensive evolutionary
divergence as its branch was much longer than the
other InR. The D. pulex InR were found to be closely
related to those of the other arthropods. The D. melanogaster InR showed a surprising grouping with the D.
pulex InR although the bootstrap support for this phylogenetic relationship was moderate. The phylogeny produced with the complete insulin sequence confirmed
the monophyly of the four D. pulex InR and the longer
branch of Dappu_InR4 but placed D.melanogaster with
the other insect taxa.
Comparative analyses of the insulin receptors

The length of the open reading frame of the Daphnia
pulex insulin receptors ranged from 1313 and 1865
amino acids. The A+T composition was very similar
among the four receptors. The exon-intron structure of
each gene presents a relatively complex and variable
structure and the receptors 1 to 4 were respectively
composed of 26, 15, 20 and 19 introns (Table 1). Two
assembly gaps were found, one of 6 kb in Dappu_InR1
located after exon 13 and another one of 1 kb in Dappu_InR2. Dappu_InR3 and Dappu_InR4 did not show
gaps (Additional Figure 1).
The insulin receptor is a modular protein containing
several specific functional domains. The structural analysis of the D. pulex insulin receptors revealed the presence of nearly all of the typical domains found in well
characterised insulin receptors such as human or Drosophila (Figure 3). Surprisingly, the fourth receptor lacked
the conserved site of the catalytic domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase.

Figure 1 Daphnia pulex insulin and TOR signalling pathways, adapted from Drosophila melanogaster [39]. The D. pulex insulin/insulin-like
growth factors signalling (IIS) comprises a group of insulin-like peptides (ILPs), four insulin receptors (InR1, InR2, InR3 and InR4) genes, an insulin
receptor substrate (IRS), the type phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K p85/p60 and PI3K p110), the lipid phosphatase PTEN, the protein kinase PKB/
AKT, the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) and the transcriptional factor FOXO. The TOR- pathway includes a TSC complex
(TSC1 and TSC2), a small GTPase RHEB, the target of rapamycin (TOR), two S6 kinase (S6K1 and S6K2), the 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and the Pol
I transcription factor TIF-1A. The AMPK-pathway involves the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) by the LKB1 protein kinase.

The insulin receptor is transmembranal and formed
by two a and two b subunits linked in a disulfide b-a-ab configuration. Dappu_InR1, Dappu_InR2, Dappu_InR3, and Dappu_InR4 possessed a 20 a.a. transmembrane domain in the beginning of the gene almost
in the same region as the one identified in Drosophila
The insulin receptor 2 had a second transmembranal
domain of 20 a.a. located upstream into the gene just
before the tyrosine protein kinase domain. The structure
of the extracellular region of the insulin receptor is predicted to be composed of six distinct structural domains
as follows: two homologous domains L1 and L2 flanking
a cysteine-rich domain CR followed by three fibronectin

type III repeats (Fn0, Fn1, and Fn2). All four analysed
receptors included two L domains but the Dappu_InR-2
lacked the cysteine-rich domain CR. Consequently, in
this receptor, the two L domains are separated by only
one a.a. In the extracellular region, we also identified
fibronectin type III domains. Dappu_InR1, Dappu_InR2,
Dappu_InR3, and Dapppu_InR4 contained three highly
similar fibronectin regions as in Homo sapiens and Drosophila (region I-II-IV in Figure 3). Dappu_InR1
included an additional fibronectin domain that we identified as an insert. The insertion (333 a.a. in length) was
located immediately after a predicted basic cleavage site
(KRR847) and had a tyrosine protein kinase domain that

itself included a protein kinase ATP binding conserved
site.
The intracellular region of the insulin receptor i.e. the
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase activity is responsible for
ligand-induced signal transduction to metabolic and
mitogenic responses. Compared to the extracellular
ligand binding determinant, this portion of the insulin
receptor was much more conserved among the four
Daphnia insulin receptors but also when compared to
the other taxa (Figure 4). Dappu_InR1, Dappu_InR2,
and Dappu_InR3 exhibited a protein tyrosine kinase catalytic domain signature which included ATP binding
site, sequence required for ATP stabilization, motif
implicated in phosphotransfer, Mg2+ binding site, consensus “PVRWMAPE” and two juxtaposed autophosphorylation sites characteristic of InR domain (for
details on conserved peptide motifs that define the 11
protein kinase subdomains see [24]).
Overall, the analyses of the gene arrangements of the
four InR of D. pulex revealed that the extracellular parts
were more variable than the intracellular components.
Dapppu_InR-3 appeared to be the more typical or conserved of the four as Dappu_InR-2 lacked the CR region
and Dappu_InR-1 had a long insert including an additional FN type 3 domain as well as an additional protein

kinase domain. Dappu_InR4 lacked the catalytic site of
the tyrosine kinase.
The dN:dS ratios did not show significant differences
in all species tested and in the four Daphnia receptors
and were mostly lower than one in all pairwise comparisons, thus congruent with purifying selection.

Expression analyses
Investigations of aligned EST sequences from condition
specific cDNA libraries on the Draft genome sequence
scaffolds revealed that all four InR were expressed under
various conditions. (Table 2). RT-qPCR confirmed the
expression of all four receptors. Single products were
found for each receptor and efficiencies rates were close
to 95%.
Discussion
In this study, we provide the first detailed genomic
study of the insulin signaling pathway in a crustacean
species. As expected, all the components of the insulin
signaling pathway were present, confirming the conservation of this pathway in metazoans. Few insulin-like
peptides were found in Daphnia in contrast to other
invertebrates. For example, D. melanogaster and C. elegans possess 7 and 37 ILPs respectively [22]. We report

here the presence of four putative InR in the D. pulex
genome, a unique case in arthropods. A single InR gene
has been described in a wide variety of invertebrates
including freshwater mollusks, nematodes and insects. A
duplication event of the insulin receptor has also been
reported in the helminth Schistosoma masoni but the
structural and functional particularities of one of these
receptors (SmIR-1) argued for its involvement in the
parasitic lifestyle of this organism [23]. In vertebrates,
two duplication events have led to the presence of three
InR paralogs (InR, IGF1R and IRR) [15]. The presence
of three or more paralogs in vertebrates but only one
gene in invertebrates is a common pattern in many protein families. Our results contrast with this trend. The
D. pulex genome is recognized as one of the most gene
rich metazoan genomes, surpassing the number of overall duplicated genes in the genomes of other well characterized species. Duplication of the InR is thus
consistent with large numbers of duplicates for other
common gene families in D. pulex http://www.biomedcentral.com/series/Daphnia. For example, 75 cytochrome
P450 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/169,
64 ABC proteins http://www.biomedcentral.com/14712164/10/170 and 11 hemoglobin genes have already
been documented in this species http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/7.
The phylogeny of the D. pulex InR is consistent with
three possible duplication events with a first duplication
of the InR gene that could have led to the ancestor of
Dappu_InR-1 and Dappu_InR-3 and to the ancestor of
Dappu_InR-2 and Dappu_InR-4, which were both subsequently generated in a second round of duplication.
Assembly gaps in two of these InR genes will need to be
resolved for a complete understanding, but our analyses
of the non-gap regions support the reported biological
differences.
Following duplication event, three possible fates are
possible for duplicated genes [25]. Briefly, (1) duplicated
genes are subject to mutation that can destroy incipient
function; (2) during the relaxed selection period following the duplication one copy can acquire a beneficial
mutation resulting in new function (neofunctionalization); and (3) the original functions of the single-copy
gene may be partitioned between the duplicates (subfunctionalization). In our results, Dappu_InR-4 may
have acquired new function based on three lines of evidence: 1) the modification of the TK motif involved in
phosphotransfer, 2) the longer branch seen on the phylogeny suggesting an unusual rapid evolution rate of
Dappu_InR-4 as compared to other InR, and 3) results
from cDNA sequencing showing that this receptor was
sampled in libraries created under various conditions.
Expression studies will need to be performed to determine if the original function has been partitioned

Page 8 of 11

among the four duplicates (subfunctionalization) or if
Dappu_InR4 has acquired new function by neofunctionalization. The three other InR appear functional even if
their ectodomains revealed some intriguing structural
features. In the well described InR of vertebrates, the bsubunit includes a single a-helical hydrophobic transmembrane domain [26]. Transmembrane domain interactions are thought to be involved in negative
cooperativity of InR [27]. Among the four InR, only
Dappu_InR-2 possesses this transmembranal domain on
the b-subunit. However, a transmembranal domain has
been identified in all four InR near the N-terminal of
the a-subunit. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of a second transmembranal domain located in the asubunit of the InR. This particularity is apparently not
restricted to D. pulex as we found this domain in insects
(e.g. Tribolium castaneum, Nasonia vitripennis and Drosophila melanogaster) and vertebrates (e.g. Mus musculus) (data not shown).
Another important difference observed among InR is
the absence of the furin-like cystein-rich domain in
Dappu_InR-2. The cysteine residues involved in the formation of disulfur bonds of this domain maintain the
quaternary structure of the extracellular portion of the
receptor [26]. These cysteines are highly conserved in all
paralogs across vertebrates. A similar pattern is found in
Drosophila [28] where the receptor assembles into a
quaternary structure but only 2 out of the 6 cysteines
described in human InR are conserved.
Experiments with chimeric InR have confirmed that
the cystein-rich domain constitutes a part of the insulin/
IGF1 binding specifity. In the nematode C. elegans, the
cystein-rich region is much shorter and contains only
two conserved cysteines [29]. Actually, it is not known if
the absence of this cystein-rich domain compromises or
modifies the activity of the receptor. We observed the
presence of a large insert of 333 amino acids in Dappu_InR-1 that included a fourth fibronectin type-3
domain and a TK domain. As this insert contains additional motifs characteristic of InR, it remains possible
that this sequence bears a specific function. As there is
already evidence from EST that these four InR are
expressed, further studies are needed to confirm if they
are expressed in different tissues and/or life stages i.e. if
they have different functions. As Daphnia are known to
exhibit extensive phenotypic plasticity in body size and
in the size of defensive structures in response to predation [30,31], duplications of the insulin receptor genes
might represent an important evolutionary innovation in
this group.

Conclusion
The insulin signaling pathway is of pivotal importance
in metabolic diseases, regulator of growth and ageing

and can also trigger diapause. This pathway has been
well described in vertebrate and in few invertebrate
model organisms but remains largely unexplored in
non-model invertebrates. Our study showed the presence of four InR which are likely the result of three
duplication events. All four receptors were found to be
expressed. One of these receptors (Dappu_InR-4) has
likely changed its function but does not appear to be
under positive selection. The three other receptors present some unusual structural features such as the presence of a large insert in Dappu_InR-1, the absence of
the transmembranal domain in the b-subunit in the
Dappu_InR-1 and Dappu_InR-3, and the absence of the
cystein-rich region in Dappu_InR-2. Although these InR
have some unusual features, the Daphnia pulex insulin
signaling pathway presents some characteristics (few
ILPs and more than one InR) that are more similar to
mammalian ISP which makes it an ideal candidate as a
model organism for the study of this pathway. Future
studies will examine if other daphniids also possess four
InR and what are the evolutionary consequences of
these duplications in Daphnia pulex.

Methods
Sequence retrieval

Molecular databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and
ENSEMBL http://www.ensembl.org/index.html were
screened for vertebrate and invertebrate InR using any
combination of words related to insulin receptors, e.g.
insulin receptor, IGF receptor, insulin, etc. Blast
searches were then performed using several well
described vertebrate and invertebrate InR sequences as
the queries. Other sequence databases that are publicly
accessible were also screened to retrieve unannotated
sequences. The following websites were used: Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Genome Portal http://www.jgi.doe.
gov/Daphnia/, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
http://www.sanger.ac.uk, the Institute for Genome
Research http://www.tigr.org/tdb/, Washington University Genome Sequencing Centre http://www.genome.
wustl.edu, H-invitational database http://h-invitational.
jp, Baylor College of Medicine http://www.hgsc.bcm.
tmc.edu, Dictybase http://dictybase.org, Ciona intestinalisgenome http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona/. Protein
sequences that were of full length or apparently of full
length (presence of initial methionine) were included
preferentially over partial sequences, although the later
were included for some organisms.
Annotation of insulin signaling pathway in D. pulex

We searched the Daphnia pulex genome http://genome.
jgi-psf.org/Dappu1/Dappu1.home.html for candidate InR
genes using a combination of key-word queries and the

Page 9 of 11

tblastn program. This database included a number of
gene prediction sets as well as a combined prediction
data set. Identification of putative InR gene orthologs
was completed by multiple protein sequence alignments
followed by phylogenetic analysis. In addition to the InR
genes, we also annotated major components of the insulin signaling pathway (Table 1) using the same methods
as described above. We described all component members (determined based on sequence homology) and
annotated them using an abbreviation of genus and species name followed by the most common designation
(for example, Dappu_InR-1 correspond to the first putative InR in Daphnia pulex). Numbering of sequences
does not imply homology with those of other organisms
but rather chronology of discovery or identification. We
suggest that all proteins described in this study, which
have not been functionally characterized, be considered
as putative, until confirmed by appropriate functional
assays.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

For phylogenetic analyses, alignments included additional InR sequences delimited by the well conserved
tyrosine kinase (TK) subdomain. This portion of the
gene was selected to include taxa in which the InR was
partially sequenced (e.g. Sycon raphanus) and allowed
the assessment of the genetic relationships of a greater
number of taxa from various groups than with the complete insulin sequence. A total of 30 TK domain
sequences were included in the phylogenetic analysis.
Amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE 3.7
[32] and the alignment was refined with Gblocks 0.91b
[33] which eliminates poorly aligned positions and
divergent regions in order to focus on unambiguously
aligned residues. The alignment of the ingroup taxa
included 187 unambiguously aligned residues with no
gap and used for the construction of phylogenetic trees
by two different analytical approaches: Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). We used PROTEST version 1.2.6 to select the substitution model that
best fit the empirical data set [34]. Then, the ML and
Bayesian analyses were performed using the fixed rate
amino acid replacement model Whelan and Goldman
(WAG) + G (a = 0.82). PHYML version 2.4.4 [35] was
used to find the ML tree. The robustness of the inferred
tree was assessed using bootstrapping (500 pseudoreplicates) as implemented in PHYML. Bayesian analysis was
also performed using MrBAYES software, version 3.1
[36]. Runs of 1,000,000 generations were executed, with
a sampling frequency of 10, a burn-in parameter of
25,000. Stability of the likelihood scores was assessed in
preliminary trials before setting the burn-in parameter.
To confirm that the results converged to the same
topology, we repeated the analysis three times. Bayesian

Boucher et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:305
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/305

posterior probabilities were calculated using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling approach implemented in
MrBAYES v3.1. For both phylogenetic analyses, we used
Mus musculus epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
as outgroup. We also performed the phylogenetic analyses on the complete insulin sequence (but on a
restricted number of taxa) to verify if the genetic relationships would be similar to those of the TK domain.
Positive selection was tested using Creevey-McInerney
[37] analysis with the Crann program. This analysis
compares the number of S and NS substitutions by
creating a neighbor-joining tree based on dN values (NS
substitutions per NS site) and then determining whether
mutations are variable (occur more than once in the
tree) or invariable (occur in only one branch of the
tree). Four values are compared to those predicted by
neutral theory: S variable (SV), S invariable (SI), NS variable (NSV), and NS invariable (NSI) mutations. If the
NS value is significantly greater than its S counterpart,
then positive selection is detected as nondirectional
(NSI>SI) or directional (NSV>SV).
Daphnia pulex InR domains

The different domains and subdomains were compared
to consensus domains using BLAST http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/Blast.cgi, SMART http://smart.
embl-heidelberg.de, ScanProsite http://www.expasy.org/
tools/scanprosite/ and MotifScan http://myhits.isb-sib.
ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan. A set of sequences from human
(IGF-1R) and D. melanogaster InR were aligned together
with those of Dappu InR-1, Dappu InR-2, Dappu InR-3
and Dappu InR-4 using clustalW program (MEGA version 4.0 [38] with the default parameters.
Expression analyses
CDNA libraries

Qualitative expression of the four Daphnia pulex insulin
receptors was obtained by cDNA sequencing of condition specific libraries. Data were extracted from wFleaBase and Gbrowse http://wfleabase.org/genepage/
daphnia/JGI_V11_314199, http://wfleabase.org/genepage/daphnia/JGI_V11_270048, http://wfleabase.org/

org/genepage/daphnia/JGI_V11_237791).

+sequencing+project.
Real-time qPCR analyses

RT-qPCR was used to confirm the expression of the
four receptors. Total RNA was extracted from 10 pooled
adult Daphnia with no eggs in the brood pouch from a
single D. pulex clone using a Qiagen RNA extraction
kit. RT was then performed on 2 ag of total RNA in 20
aL of 1 × M-MLV buffer (50 mmol·L-1 Tris-HCl, pH

Page 10 of 11

8.3; 50 mmol·L-1 KCl; 3 mmol·L-1 MgCl2; 5 mmol·L-1
DTT) containing 0.5 mmol·L-1 dNTPs mix, 2 μmol·L-1
oligo(dT)23 primer, 200 units M-MLV RT, and 20 units
of RNase inhibitor. Primers specific for each receptor
were designed based on unique exons (except for Dappu_InR4) from predicted cDNA sequences from FleaBase. RT-qPCR was performed in the myIQ BIORAD.
Each reaction contained 2al of cDNA template, 10 al of
Quantifast SYBRgreen PCR master mix (Qiagen) and 0.5
aM of primers (DpInR1F: 5’ CAAACACGTCATCCACAAC3’, DpInR1R: 5’GCCGCTTCATAAACTCAAGTAAT3’, DpInR2F: 5’GCCGCTTCATAAACTCAA

CCAATGAAACCGCTCGAA3’). PCR was carried out
using the following conditions: 5 min at 95°C, 50 cycles
consisting of 20 s at 95°C followed by 30 s at 60°C
(InR1), 67°C (InR2,3), and 72°C (InR4). Dissociation
curves were performed to test for the presence of primers-dimers.
