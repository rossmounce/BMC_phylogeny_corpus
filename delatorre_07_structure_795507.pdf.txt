Abstract
Background: Lectins are mainly described as simple carbohydrate-binding proteins. Previous
studies have tried to identify other binding sites, which possible recognize plant hormones,
secondary metabolites, and isolated amino acid residues. We report the crystal structure of a lectin
isolated from Canavalia gladiata seeds (CGL), describing a new binding pocket, which may be related
to pathogen resistance activity in ConA-like lectins; a site where a non-protein amino-acid, αaminobutyric acid (Abu), is bound.
Results: The overall structure of native CGL and complexed with α-methyl-mannoside and Abu
have been refined at 2.3 Å and 2.31 Å resolution, respectively. Analysis of the electron density maps
of the CGL structure shows clearly the presence of Abu, which was confirmed by mass
spectrometry.
Conclusion: The presence of Abu in a plant lectin structure strongly indicates the ability of lectins
on carrying secondary metabolites. Comparison of the amino acids composing the site with other
legume lectins revealed that this site is conserved, providing an evidence of the biological relevance
of this site. This new action of lectins strengthens their role in defense mechanisms in plants.

Background
Most of the biochemical lectin studies have been based on
monochromatic view since almost all the properties of

these proteins had been commonly reported in terms of
lectin-carbohydrate recognition. For several years, the definition of lectins has been improving focused on the car-

bohydrate-binding properties. The most recent accepted
definition establishes lectins as proteins with at least one
non-catalytic domain able to recognize and bind reversibly to specific mono and oligosaccharides. They are subdivided into four types: merolectins, hololectins,
chimerolectins and superlectins. This classification was
conceived in terms of the carbohydrate-binding domain
and another unrelated domain [1]. Several studies have
tried to find other binding sites that could possibly recognize plant hormones, secondary metabolites and isolated
amino acid residues [2-4].
Over 250 non-protein amino acids have been identified
in plants [5]. A number of these compounds are intermediates in the synthesis and catabolism of protein amino
acids [6]. However, many of these non-protein amino
acids may play a role as defensive agents. They show their
toxicity in many ways; some of them block the synthesis
and the absorption of protein amino acids or can wrongly
incorporated into proteins in organisms that feed on these
plants. Plants that synthesize non-protein amino acids are
not susceptible to the toxicity of these compounds. Seeds
from Canavalia ensiformis, which synthesize high quantities of non-protein amino acids, display a biological system capable of discriminating between these amino acids
and the others [7].
Non-protein amino acids are especially abundant in Leguminosae, Liliaceae and in several higher fungi and marine
algae. Plant organs rich in these metabolites are seeds
(Leguminosae) or rhizomes (Liliaceae). Concentrations
in seeds can exceed 10% of dry weight and up to 50% of
the nitrogen could be attributed to them. Since non-protein amino acids are often remobilized during germination, they certainly function as N-storage compounds in
addition to their role as defense chemicals [8]. If non-protein amino acids are taken up by herbivores, microorganisms or other plants, they may interfere with their
metabolism.
Aminobutyric acid (Abu) is a non-protein amino acid that
can protect certain plants against pathogens; for instance,
when introduced into Arabidopis plants, it has the ability
to induce resistance to certain pathogens. Abu protects
these plants against pathogens through the activation of
natural defense mechanisms of the plant, such as callose
deposition, hypersensitive response (HR), and the formation of trailing necroses. Induced resistance is often associated with a process called priming, which is an increased
capacity to mobilize cellular defense responses [9].
Most plant lectins not only play a role in the plant itself
(e.g., as a store of nitrogen or as a specific recognition factor) but are also capable of interfering with the functioning of foreign organisms through an interaction with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/52

glycoconjugates on the surface or in the digestive tract of
these organisms [10]. Although this interference has been
reported as a specific event of carbohydrate recognition, it
has not been elucidated yet. Stress-regulated pathways for
rapid and high gene expression are one of the essential
elements in stress acclimation. Salicylic acid, jasmonic
acid, systemin, ethylene, and aminobutyric acid have
been implicated in the potentiation of gene expression
[11,12], and other signal molecules have been shown to
play a similar role [9].
The content of free protein amino acids in seeds varies
among species and increases dramatically after germination. More non-protein amino acids were found in lentil
seedlings compared to the seeds [12]. Most plant lectins
are probably involved in plant defense [13]. The mechanism of action still remains unclear even though induced
response mechanisms are proposed for many pathogenmediated injuries in plants. The direct interference with
viruses and microorganisms is rather exceptional, and the
deleterious effects of plant lectins on both predatory
invertebrates and animals are well documented [13].
We report here the crystal structure of a native and complexed lectin isolated from Canavalia gladiata seeds,
describing a new binding pocket in ConA-like lectins,
which may be related to pathogen resistance, a site where
a non-protein amino acid, such as α-amino butyric acid,
can bind.

Results and discussion
Overall structure of CGL
The crystal structure of native CGL and in complex with αmethyl-mannoside (CGL-αMM) provides a new source of
information for the understanding of lectins and reveals a
new binding site for a non protein amino acid at the monomers contact interface of each canonical dimer of leguminous lectins. The overall structure of native CGL and
CGL-αMM has been refined at the 2.3 Å and 2.31 Å resolutions, respectively (Figure 1). The lectin CGL model was
refined in the absence of ligand to produce the Fo-Fc map.
This map is unbiased insofar as the atomic coordinates
used for phase calculations have never been refined
together with the ligand. The ligand was finally inserted to
produce the final coordinates after some further refinement. The models present good stereochemistry, and the
Ramachandran plot is consistent with a geometrically
well-defined structure (Table 1).

Among the leguminous lectins isolated from the tribe
Diocleinae, only those purified from the seeds of C. ensiformis, C. brasiliensis, C. maritima, Dioclea grandiflora, D.
guianensis and Cratylia mollis have three-dimensional
structures resolved by X-ray crystallography [14,15]. These
lectins showed respectively 98%, 98%, 99%, 84%, 82%

and 81% similarity in their amino acid sequences as compared with CGL.
The oligomeric structures of CGL and CGL-αMM involve
two 'canonical' dimers, and these dimers are associated by
salt bridges between β-strands. The model was examined
by Xfit, and one region around Asp 139 showed a welldefined electron density (fo-fc contoured at 5σ), not elucidated for the model, the atomic coordinates for this
structure were deposited without the elucidation of this
density with PDB access 1 WUV. After an analysis of the
amino acid and secondary metabolite content in leguminous seeds, α-aminobutyric acid (Abu), a non-protein
amino acid, was chosen according to electron density. The
atomic coordinates for the structure in complex with Abu
and α-methyl-mannoside (CGL-αMM) was deposited in
PDB with access code 2D7F.
An interesting feature of the presence of the Abu molecule
in CGL structures is the great increase in electron density
in loops. Previous ConA structures showed some poor

density regions at N-terminal residues and in surface
loops at residues 118–122, 149–151, 160–163 [16-18].
The CGL structure presents well-defined electron density
in these loops and is the first ConA-like structure that
shows a stable loop in 118–122 region.
In both CGL crystal structures, the amino acids involved
in metal binding are conserved. The calcium metal ion
bond drives the trans-to-cis isomerization of the Ala207Asp208 peptide bond, which is conserved in all known
legume lectin crystal structures. This cis-peptide bond
contributes to the stabilization of the binding pocket by
orienting the positions of residues Asn14 and Arg228.
The sugar-binding site is a highly conserved region in
ConA-like lectins. The role of conserved amino acid residues in monosaccharide interactions with lectins has been
extensively reported. Commonly, five to eight H-bonds
occur between monosaccharides and the Diocleinae lectin
domain amino acids Asn14, Leu99, Tyr100, Asp208 and
Arg228 [19]; CGL-αMM displays an alpha-methyl-mannoside recognition involving seven H-bonds with specific
amino acid residues and another with a water molecule.
The nitrogen side chain of Asn14 forms a single H-bond
with αMM O4 oxygen at 2.6 Å; the main chain nitrogens
of Leu99 and Tyr100 are connected with αMM O5 and O6
oxygens. O5 is at 3.0 Å from Leu99 and O6 is at 2.9 Å and
2.98 Å from Leu99 and Tyr100, respectively. Oxygens
from Asp 208 side chain are the CGL closest atoms from

the αMM. They are positioned at 2.5 Å from O7 and 2.7 Å
from O6, and the main chain nitrogen of Arg 228 makes
a 2.9 Å H-bond with αMM O3 oxygen.

α-aminobutyric acid (Abu) interaction
Abu was found at the monomers contact interface of CGLαMM (Figure 2). The Fo-Fc omit map in figure 3a is contoured at 3σ cutoff and confirms that the map is unbiased
and the electron density clearly has Abu fitted in the map.
Abu ligand is accessible to the solvent surface by the carboxyl group and interacts with one chain through hydrogen bond with Asp139 and an interstitial water molecule,
which interacts with Asn 124 and with the other chain
through hydrogen bonds with Ala 125 and with another
interstitial water interacting with Gln 137, and through
hydrophobic interaction with Leu126 and Val 179 (Figure
2). The presence of Abu at the monomers interface
increased the intermolecular contacts and strongly stabilized the canonical dimers. This interaction decreased the
vibrational spectrum and increased the X-ray scattering in
loop regions. In order to obtain further evidence for the
presence of ABU in the structure, we collected data in the
absence of glycerol at room temperature. Analysis of these
low resolution CGL structures (solved at approximately
3.0 Å resolution), also indicates presence of the electron
density for the Abu. At room temperature, protein crystals
were mounted in sealed thin-walled glass capillary tubes
for X-ray data collection, these conditions lead to a loss in
the resolution power. The best data set diffracted to 3.0 Å
and shows ABU in a non-conclusive electron density map,
but the electron density calculated at 2.3 Å shows clearly
that the map corresponding to the ABU density. Due to
the distance of atoms is really difficult to consider that this
density refers to a set of ordered waters in both structures.

The structure solved in the absence of glycerol and showing appropriate density for ABU is shown in figure 3b.
Hydrophilic interactions occur between Abu and Asp139
by H-bonds. The OD2 hydroxyl oxygen from Asp139 and
Abu oxygen display at 2.4 Å. The same Abu molecule oxygen builds another H-bond with a water molecule at 2.6 Å
and the Abu nitrogen also interacts with a water molecule
at 2.5 Å (Figure 4).
The residues that compose this hydrophobic pocket are
highly conserved in other ConA-like lectins from Phaseoleae tribe, such as, lectins from Canavalia brasiliensis
seeds (ConBr), Canavalia maritima seeds (ConM) and Dioclea grandiflora seeds (DGL). These residues were also
found to be highly conserved in various lectins from Phaseoleae, Glycineae and Sophoreae tribes from Fabales
order. Lectins isolated from seeds of Bowringia mildbraedii
(BMA), Dolichos lablab (Dlab) and Glicine max (GML and
SBA) presented in their amino acid sequences the same
residues that were found in CGL Abu site or, in some
cases, an amino acid conservative change (Table 2). All
the residues listed form the monomer-monomer interface
of the dimmers of these legume lectins. The conservative
changes in Abu site, specifically in Ala125, do not seem to
be a problem to perform the interaction with molecules
like Abu because the hydrogen bond occurs between the
Abu and the main chain of this residue. In addition, residues corresponding to Leu 126 and Val 179, which are
effective in hydrophobic anchoring of Abu, and the ones
corresponding to Asp 139 and Gln 137, responsible by
hydrophilic contacts, are highly conserved in spite of the
relative phylogenetic distance of these leguminous tribes.
It is important to consider that the origin of the genes that
codify plant lectin rose from a unique ancestral and the
little differences found between them were originated by
divergence evolutionary processes [20]. But structures are
more conserved than sequences during evolution. Therefore some differences found in the amino acids of Abu site
not necessarily mean an absence of functional correlations between the CGL and other lectins [21].
The mass spectrometry analysis of CGL reveals a very well
purified spectrum showing the peaks of ions with charge
from +18 (m/z = 1419.8669) to + 28 (m/z = 913.1152)
(Figure 5a). The deconvolution of this spectrum reveals
two peaks to CGL exact mass; the first peak (m/z =
12770.0010) is the double-charged ion and the second
one (m/z = 25541.0020) represents the mono-charged
ion and the exact mass of the protein (Figure 5b). The
presence of Abu in the CGL structure was confirmed by
mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of Abu displayed m/
z (+H) = 104.1131 ± 0.1 Min the low mass spectrum in the
CGL ESI-Q-ToF MS analysis. The fragmentation of this ion
in an MS/MS experiment revealed an ion-fragment with

m/z = 86.05 ± 0.1, this mass referred to Abu molecular
mass with a common loss of a water group (~18 Da). (Figure 5c).
The finding of Abu in CGL strongly indicates the capability of lectins to bind secondary metabolites. Some legume
lectins possess a hydrophobic binding site with high affinity for adenine and certain adenine-derived plant hormones [2]. The binding of adenine has been described
mainly for tetrameric legume lectins, including DBL,
PHA-E and SBA [3,4]. This new property of lectins supports their role in defense mechanisms in plants.
Physiological Properties
CGL reveals an interaction site for a non-protein amino
acid, which may be involved in defense mechanisms and
the induction of response against pathogens in synergy
with jasmonate, salicylic acid and abscisic acid pathways.
During the final step of the germination of leguminous
seeds, Abu concentration increases. In lentil experiments
shown by Rozan and collaborators [12], the total content
of non-protein amino acids in non-germinating seeds was
very low. This content increased after four days of germination and then even more when the stage of seedling was
reached [12]. There's a possibility that at least a part of the
increase in Abu concentration may be explained by the
release of this molecule when the canonical dimmer is
disrupted, when the lectins start to be consumed during
final steps of germination [22]. Consequently free Abu
increases in the seedlings. This hypothesis is schematically
depicted in Figure 6.

When Abu concentration increases in seedlings, it promotes the synthesis of ethylene. Once lectins are consumed at the end of germination, it's reasonable to
assume that there could be a correlation between lectinbinding substances such as Abu and the development of
plant response against stress and pathogens [11,22].
Other non-protein amino acids, such as the Abu isomers
β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), have been reported to be physiological inducers
in many processes related to response-induced resistance
and stress [9]. Actually, non-protein amino acids seem to
be involved in ethylene-dependent induced systemic
resistance [9]. If our hypothesis is true, lectins may have
an important role in this mechanism, which would define
a lectin-dependent ISR pathway.
It should be highlighted that this discussion above is simply a hypothesis and that we don't really have any certainties regarding the real relevance of this site and the
binding of Abu to the lectin. But the fact that the amino
acids present in this site are conserved in legume lectins as
mentioned before is undoubtedly an evidence that an
important biological activity is mediated by this site.
The common carbohydrate-binding site of lectins has
been reported as the main target in the study of lectins,
but evidence of new biological sites leads to questions
about the physiological function of these proteins, first
considered storage proteins and later found to play a role
in plant defense mechanisms.

Methods

Figure 4
Stereo view of Abu ligand site
Stereo view of Abu ligand site. H-bonds stabilize the Abu
(magenta) in the pocket after the anchoring by hydrophobic
interactions. The pocket is formed in the monomers interface, which build the canonical dimers of CGL, inside the
hydrophobic cavity. Asp 139 from one chain and Ala 125
from the other monomer chain interacts with abu by Hbonds. Two interstitial water molecules (red balls) perform
H-bonds with the amino and carboxyl groups of abu. The
hydrophobic contacts are established by abu and Leu 126 and
Val 179 from the same chain.

The increase in Abu concentration in the seedling corresponds to the increasing induction of hypersensitive
response in adult plants considering the high concentrations of HR inducers at this time of plant ontogeny as
described by Boege and Marquis [11]. In agreement, lectin
concentration in seeds declines drastically by the end of
germination and, therefore, is lower in the seedling (Figure 6).

Conclusion
Our study supports other investigations proposing a function for lectins beyond simple carbohydrate recognition.
Plant lectins are proteins which may also interact with secondary metabolites, displaying cell recognition, and
defense functions in plant physiology. Here, we described
a new interaction site not related to the sugar-binding site
in a ConA-like lectin that may be related to plant defense.

Crystallization and Data Collection
The purification of Canavalia gladiata lectin (CGL) was
performed as discribed by Cecatto et al. [23] and Moreno
et al. [24]. Crystals of the Canavalia gladiata lectin were
grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method,
drops contained 3 μL of protein solution and 3 μL of 0.1
M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Cryoprotected native CGL crystals diffracted to a resolution of
2.3 Å using a synchrotron radiation source and indexed,
integrated and scaled at the same resolution. Low resolution data sets have been collected in capillar without cryoprotection at 2.9, 3.0 and 3.1 Å resolution in room
temperature to confirm the presence of Abu. Native crystals were also soaked with a solution containing 1 mM αmethyl-mannoside. The complexed crystals diffracted to
2.3 Å. The data were indexed, integrated and scaled at 2.3
Å using MOSFLM [25] and SCALA [26]. Crystals belong to
the orthorhombic space group C2221. The calculated Matthews coefficient indicated a tetramer in the asymmetric
unit, and this protein assumes the same oligomerization
in biological conditions.
Molecular Replacement and Refinement
The crystal structures CGL and CGL-αMM were determined by molecular replacement using the MolRep program [26]. Canavalia ensiformis lectin (ConA) structure
without the complexed sugar and water molecules (PDB
code 5CNA) was used as the search model [16]. The Abu
coordinates were obtained by PRODRG program [27].
The initial structures were refined using REFMAC5 [28]
and water molecules were added to the models using
XtalView [29]. The crystal structures were deposited in the
PDB [30] with accession code 1 WUV and 2D7F. The crystallographic statistics data are shown in Table 1. An omit
map contoured at 3 σ to the aminobutyric acid was generated using CCP4 Omit program [28].
Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The presence of Abu in the molecule of native CGL was
analyzed in an ESI-Q-ToF/MS/MS experiment. An amount
of 1 mg of CGL was dissolved in 1 mL of a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 5% TFA. The protein solu-
