Abstract
Background: elicobacter pylori infection is associated with several gastro-duodenal inflammatory diseases of various
levels of severity. To determine whether certain combinations of genetic markers can be used to predict the clinical
source of the infection, we analyzed well documented and geographically homogenous clinical isolates using a
comparative genomics approach.
Results: A set of 254 H. pylori genes was used to perform array-based comparative genomic hybridization among 120
French H. pylori strains associated with chronic gastritis (n = 33), duodenal ulcers (n = 27), intestinal metaplasia (n = 17)
or gastric extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell MALT lymphoma (n = 43). Hierarchical cluster analyses of the DNA
hybridization values allowed us to identify a homogeneous subpopulation of strains that clustered exclusively with
cagPAI minus MALT lymphoma isolates. The genome sequence of B38, a representative of this MALT lymphoma straincluster, was completed, fully annotated, and compared with the six previously released H. pylori genomes (i.e. J99,
26695, HPAG1, P12, G27 and Shi470). B38 has the smallest H. pylori genome described thus far (1,576,758 base pairs
containing 1,528 CDSs); it contains the vacAs2m2 allele and lacks the genes encoding the major virulence factors
(absence of cagPAI, babB, babC, sabB, and homB). Comparative genomics led to the identification of very few
sequences that are unique to the B38 strain (9 intact CDSs and 7 pseudogenes). Pair-wise genomic synteny
comparisons between B38 and the 6 H. pylori sequenced genomes revealed an almost complete co-linearity, never
seen before between the genomes of strain Shi470 (a Peruvian isolate) and B38.
Conclusion: These isolates are deprived of the main H. pylori virulence factors characterized previously, but are
nonetheless associated with gastric neoplasia.
Background
Helicobacter pylori infections occur in approximately 50%
of the human population and are associated with several
inflammatory gastroduodenal diseases [1], including two
types of gastric cancers: gastric adenocarcinoma [2] and
gastric extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell MALT (mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma, first described by
Isaacson et al. [3]. Evolution of this bacterial infection

towards malignancy only occurs in approximately 1% of
infected individuals, suggesting that both bacterial and
host susceptibility factors are involved[4].
Since the discovery of H. pylori, several studies have
focused on elucidating H. pylori pathogenicity mechanisms (microbial factors) that are associated with disease
outcomes[5]. The cag-pathogenicity island (cagPAI) has
been recognized as a major pro-inflammatory actor, but
its association with MALT lymphoma strains has yet to
be clearly shown [6]. The VacA vacuolating cytotoxin,
thought to cause detectable alterations in gastric epithelial cells and immune cells, is also one of the most studied

H. pylori virulence factors [7]. VacA has also been suggested to play a role in H. pylori persistence, demonstrated by in vitro studies, based on its
immunosuppressive properties [8]. Adhesion of H. pylori
to gastric epithelial cells is another bacterial trait contributing to chronic state of the infection. BabA [9], SabA
[10], HopZ [11], HomB [12] and 30 outer-membrane-like
paralogs recognized as adhesins or potential adhesins are
encoded by the H. pylori genome [13]. Several studies
have highlighted their contribution to pathogen fitness in
human populations [14,15]. Over the last twenty years,
genes encoding these virulence factors have served as
genotyping markers to establish correlations between
these markers, alone or in combination, and clinical outcomes of H. pylori infections [16].
Few studies have been conducted in relation to gastric
MALT lymphoma-associated strains. Koehler et al.
reported that the vacAm2 allele predominated in MALT
lymphoma-associated isolates [17]. In previous studies
[18,19] including an identical collection of H. pylori gastric MALT lymphoma strains to that used here, the
authors confirmed this finding and suggested that certain
combinations of genomic markers may have a predictive
value for determining whether gastric MALT lymphoma
develops. All these data suggest the potential role for bacterial determinism in the clinical outcome of MALT lymphoma.
So far, comparative genomics involving sequenced H.
pylori genomes have been limited to five clinical isolates
isolated in the West and associated with gastritis [strain
26695 [20], peptic ulcers (strains J99 [GenP12
[EMBL:CP001217,
Bank:AE001439.1],
EMBL:CP001218]), atrophic gastritis (HPAG1 [21]), or
no known disease (strains G27 [22] and Shi470 [RefSeq:NC_010698]. However, no genome sequence of a H.
pylori strain isolated from MALT lymphoma is currently
available. Comparative genomics based on DNA-array
analyses, first conducted by Salama et al. on 15 Caucasian
isolates [23], led to the elucidation of the H. pylori core
genome comprising the pool of ubiquitous H. pylori
genes and strain-specific genes (non-ubiquitous). Gressmann et al. studied gene gain and loss during evolution,
by comparing the genome of 56 globally representative
strains of H. pylori; they reported that 25% of the genes
were non-ubiquitous [24]. Through comparative genomics based on the analysis of 24 clinical isolates from various geographical origins (Western, Asian, African
countries) using whole genome DNA arrays, we identified 213 non-ubiquitous or strain-specific genes [25]. In
this study, we describe the gene distribution of these 213
non-ubiquitous genes (Additional file 1) within genomes
from a large geographically homogeneous French collection of 120 well-characterized H. pylori strains associated
with chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, intestinal metapla-

sia or gastric MALT lymphoma. A hierarchical clustering
analysis of the DNA hybridization values identified a
homogeneous phylogenic subpopulation of strains containing all of the cagPAI minus MALT lymphoma isolates. The B38 isolate was selected as a representative of
this MALT lymphoma-specific cluster. Its genome
sequence was completed, fully annotated, and compared
with previously sequenced and published H. pylori
genomes.

Results and Discussion
Non-ubiquitous gene distribution in relation to associated
diseases

Hybridization results for the 120 studied DNAs used as a
probe and the home-made macroarrays derived from the
reference strain 26695 are presented in Additional file 1
(data based on the binary presence/absence analyses) and
Figure 1 (data based on the multidimensional analysis of
continuous values, see material and methods). Both presentations illustrate the distribution of each of the 254
genes (213 non-ubiquitous, and 41 ubiquitous, used for
normalization) with respect to associated diseases. Each
strain hybridization profile (Figure 1) is represented by a
series of vertically aligned bar charts, whereas the horizontal lines represent each of the 254 genes. Each strain
exhibited a unique profile. The most striking features
were related to the distribution of the cagPAI genes:
almost all H. pylori strains associated with metaplasia
harbored a complete cagPAI, a result consistent with
findings by Nilsson et al. [26]. However, a complete cagPAI was present in 70% of duodenal ulcer strains, and in
50% of chronic gastritis and of MALT lymphoma strains,
confirming previously published findings for isolates collected in the West [27].
Hierarchical clustering of the continuous values
derived from the hybridization experiments of 120
French clinical isolates presenting different disease characteristics was performed (Figure 1). This allowed us to
visualize a branch clustering almost exclusively isolates
associated with MALT lymphoma. Furthermore, principal component analysis allowed us to identify a combination of 48 genes (Additional file 1), which proved to be
the most informative during multidimensional analysis.
We then performed hierarchical clustering based on the
values of these 48 genes (Figure 2). Two main branches
were detected, one consisting of a distinct cluster of 20
isolates, all totally deprived of the cagPAI. Eighteen of the
isolates were associated with MALT lymphoma and two
with gastritis. Interestingly, none of the peptic ulcer or
metaplasia isolates clustered in this branch. The second
branch splits into two main clusters, one corresponding
to isolates that totally or partially lack cagPAI genes
mostly associated with gastritis and the other clustering
isolates associated with other diseases.

Figure 1 Hybridization reactions on a DNA macroarray membrane containing 254 PCR products that are representative of H. pylori strain
26695 (41 ubiquitous genes + 213 non-ubiquitous or strain-specific genes). Bacterial DNAs from 120 isolates involved in various diseases, including chronic gastritis (yellow), intestinal metaplasia (pink), duodenal ulcer (blue) and gastric MZBL (green), were tested by hybridization. Isolates are
listed on the horizontal axis, and the genes tested, on the vertical axis. Clustering (genesis software) was carried out using the continuous values from
120 heterologous hybridization experiments, where each value corresponds to the (log26695-logheterol.strain) value for each tested gene (see materials &
methods). Colors of the line range from blue, if the gene is present, to red, if absent. The range of intermediate colors reflects the degree of hybridization and thus homology, but also the redundancy of the tested genes. This figure represents the clustering based on the complete set of 254 genes.

To clarify the genetic determinism of the MALT lymphoma strains, we selected one strain that was representative of the MALT lymphoma cagPAI minus branch and
determined its genome sequence. We selected strain B38,
which was isolated from a 62-year-old man suffering

from MALT lymphoma. It fulfilled various requirements:
i) it belonged to the hpEurope phylogenetic branch
according to MLST analysis (Suerbaum, personal communication), a property that was consistent with the five
Helicobacter genome sequences previously published

(26695, J99, HPAG1, P12, and G27); ii) it was genetically
transformable; iii) it was plasmid free, and iv) it was capable of colonizing the mouse gastric mucosa. Its vacA status was s2m2 [18].
Main features of the B38 genome

The genome of the B38 strain consists of a circular chromosome containing 1,576,758 base pairs (bp) and an
average GC content of 39.2% (Figure 3). It is the smallest
H. pylori genome sequenced to date (Table 1). The B38
genome sequence was first automatically and then manually annotated using the MaGe system [28]http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage and was then compared
with the other sequenced H. pylori genomes. It contains
1,528 CDSs with a coding density (85.0%) similar to that
found in the other Helicobacter sequenced strains.
Among the 1528 CDSs, 1393 were predicted to be protein-coding genes (complete CDSs) with an average
length of 971 bp; 135 correspond to partial CDSs, of
which 133 are pseudogenes (i.e. 133 fragments representing 62 genes) and two are remnant genes (corresponding
to truncated genes for which we cannot find the missing
sections in close proximity) (Table 1).
Of the 1,528 annotated CDSs, a function was assigned
to 989 CDSs (64.7%). For 784 of them (79.3%), a function
was experimentally demonstrated either in the Helicobacter species (188, 12.3%) or in another organism (596,
39%). Two hundred and five CDSs (20.7% of 989) received
a function based on the presence of a conserved amino
acid motif, a structural feature, or limited homology. A
total of 378 CDSs have homologs in previously reported
sequences of the genus Helicobacter (43.6% of 378), in the
epsilon proteobacteria (35.2% of 378), or in other distant
bacteria (21.2% of 378). Protein function classification
based on the cluster orthologous genes classification
(COG) database allowed us to place 1189 of the 1528
CDSs (77.81%) in at least one of the COG functional
groups (Table 2): 454 were assigned to cellular processes
and signaling systems, 342 to information storage and
processing, while 595 were involved in metabolism. The
B38 genome exhibits the highest percentage of CDSs
associated with a COG group (77.97% vs 73.38% for
26695, 76.48% for J99, 76.15% for HPAG1 and, 73.49 for
Shi470), with the number of CDSs involved in defense
mechanisms slightly higher than in the other sequenced
Helicobacter strains.
There are a significant number of restriction/modification systems present in H. pylori; their composition and
activity have been shown to be strain-specific [29]. In the
B38 strain, 63 CDSs were involved in restriction/modification systems. Among them, 30 elements were fragmented into pseudogenes corresponding to 12 potential
genes, and three elements appeared to be partial genes
(Additional file 2). Thus, the proportion of potentially

Page 5 of 12

active genes (52%) appeared to be higher in B38 than in
strains J99 and 26695, in which only 30% of type II R-M
systems were reported to be functional [30].
The B38 genome harbors five complete copies of the
four-gene insertion sequence ISHp609. This insertion
sequence was frequently found in H. pylori strains from
Europe, Americas, India and Africa, but was almost
always absent in strains from East Asia [31]. Three of the
four genes (orf1, orf2, ORFA) demonstrated 100% of identity in the five B38 ISHp609 copies, whereas ORFB from
one of the five B38 ISHp609 copies (HELPY1334) exhibited a single mutation. Among the sequenced genomes
(Table 1), a single and complete copy of this element was
found in strain HPAG1, but it differed slightly from that
found in B38 (6, 8, and 9 mutations are present in orf1,
ORFA, and ORFB of HPAG1, respectively). This consistency in the five copies of ISHp609 in B38 indicated that
it has been acquired very recently, and that it is probably
an active element that is capable of transposition, a property never experimentally demonstrated for a transposable element in H. pylori.
Another property associated with the B38 genome
relates to the complete absence of four of the 45 genes
encoding outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from the
four conserved OMP families (Hop, Hor, Hof et Hom)
(Additional file 3). B38 lacks babB, babC, sabB, and
homB, four OMPs known to play a major role in adhesion
to gastric epithelial cells and possibly in long-term persistence of strains in the human gastric mucosa when associated with peptic ulcer diseases or gastric metaplasia
[32]. B38 lacks a high number of adhesin genes among the
sequenced genomes.
Comparative genomics and genome evolution

We then analyzed the genomic rearrangements through
pair-wise genomic synteny comparisons between B38
and the eight published Helicobacteriaceae genomes. For
five of the isolates (namely, 26695, J99, G27, P12,
HPAG1), we confirmed the previously reported relative
colinearity of the H.pylori genomes. This colinearity is
mainly interrupted by insertion elements, the cagPAI, and
genes encoding hypothetical proteins [33]. However,
unexpectedly, conserved synteny highlighted an almost
complete colinearity never described so far, between B38
and Shi470 (Figure 4). Shi470 is a clinical isolate from the
gastric antrum of an Amerindian resident of a remote
Amazonian village in Peru, and was thought to be related
to strains from East Asia [RefSeq:NC_010698]. This
unexpected absence of major genomic rearrangements
between the two genomes prompted us to compare the
genome of these two isolates more closely, as a way of
better understanding H. pylori genome evolution. B38
lacks 174 Shi470 genes, of which 70 genes cluster in three
insertion blocks: one corresponds to the well character-

block that includes 7 CDSs encoding hypothetical proteins, as well as one CDS encoding an exodeoxyribonuclease subunit which is unique to the Shi 470 isolate.

Conversely, loss of synteny was also due to the presence
of 110 CDSs in B38 that were not present in Shi470.
Forty-three of these CDSs appeared as clusters within
eight loci. Twenty corresponded to ISHp609 (5 complete
and conserved copies of ISHp609 each comprising orf1,

modification systems), HELPY0838 (encoding a putative
Rad50 ATPase), HELPY1330 (encoding a putative glycosyl-transferase), and HELPY1529 (a HAC prophage II
protein homolog). In addition to these five ISHp609
insertions, loss of synteny was also due to the presence of
CDSs in four other loci: i) a cluster of seven genes
(HELPY1520 to HELPY1525 and HEPLY1527,
HELPY1528 to HELPY1533) encoding HacII prophagelike proteins similar to those found in H. acinonychis
strain Sheeba [34]; however, the size of the prophage is
much larger (32 CDS) in this species, suggesting that the
prophage in B38 has been deleted, possibly following the
insertion of one copy of ISHp609; ii) a cluster of six genes
encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function
(HELPY0051 to HELPY0056); iii) a cluster of three CDSs
that are absent in Shi470, HPAG1, J99, P12, and G127,
but present in strain 26695, of which two encode alginate-O-acetylation proteins (HELPY0497-498); iv) a
cluster of seven CDSs that encode a putative helicase
(HELPY0989) and a putative serine kinase (HELPY0990),
two functional proteins not found in all of the other
sequenced strains.

H. pylori core genome and strain-specific genes

BLAST score ratio analyses and comparisons between
the B38 strain and the six other sequenced genomes,
which were analyzed and revised through the MaGe system (Table 1), allowed us to establish that the core of the
H. pylori genome consists of 1,275 CDSs. This number is
slightly higher than that recently published by McClain
and colleagues who identified 1,237 genes, as it takes into
account additional CDSs detected by the MaGe system
[35]. This number is lower than that calculated from data
presented in Additional file 1 (1,358 genes) based on the
macroarray hybridization analysis of 120 isolates. This
approach overestimated the number of ubiquitous CDSs,
as all small CDS (<350 bp) from the 26695 strain genome
were excluded from the analysis, and thus were systematically counted as ubiquitous CDSs.
To identify strain-specific genes present in the B38
strain but absent from the other sequenced strains, we
studied the putative orthologous relationship between
two genomes i.e. gene couples who satisfy Bi-directional
Best Hit (BBH) criteria. Criteria included a minimum of
30% sequence identity and 80% of the length of the small-

Thiberge et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/368

est protein (Additional file 4). Only 16 CDSs were found
to be unique to the B38 strain: nine seemed to be complete and thus putatively functional; six were shown to
encode the putative HacII prophage-like proteins
(HELPY1521-1522-1523-1524-1525-1527); three were
found to encode hypothetical proteins (HELPY0409,
HELPY0645 and HELPY0996), and seven corresponded
to fragments of genes (partial genes) coding for either
conserved
hypothetical
proteins,
prophage-like
sequences or for a restriction enzyme. Using the same
methodology, we looked for genes that were present in
the various H. pylori strains and absent in B38 (Additional file 5). If compared pair-wise, the number of CDSs
absent in B38 was between 105 and 175. The only genes
that were found to be exclusively absent in B38 corresponded to those of the cagPAI (Additional file 5), the
well-known cluster of genes involved in the induction of a
strong inflammatory response.
Specific properties associated with the genomes of strains
belonging to the MALT lymphoma PAI minus cluster

Of the 19 strains belonging to the MALT lymphoma PAI
minus cluster, all 19 contained the vacAm2 allele; 16
exhibited an s2m2 genotype, indicating that they encode
a non-functional cytotoxin, and three exhibited an s1m2
genotype [18]. We then investigated whether the properties found to be unique to strain B38 are shared by the
strains belonging to the cluster of the MALT lymphoma
PAI-minus cluster. The search for the presence of the
HacII-like prophage was done through hybridization
using internal fragments of HELPY1521, HELPY1525,
and HELPY1526 as probes. Four of the 19 strains (21%,
including B38) of the MALT lymphoma PAI minus cluster, contained HacII prophage-like sequences. By contrast, 1/24 (4%) strains isolated from patients with MALT
lymphoma containing cagPAI, 2/33 (6%) strains from
patients suffering from gastritis and 2/27 strains (7.4%)
from those with duodenal ulcers contained HacII
prophage-like sequences. Furthermore, the presence of
the two adjacent HELPY0989 and HELPY0990 genes
encoding a helicase and a serine kinase, respectively, not
previously found in the other sequenced genomes as
functional proteins were found in three of the 19 strains
(16%) of the B38 cluster. These two genes were not
detected in the other MALT lymphoma strains (cagPAI
positive), nor within the 22 isolates associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. Finally, three clustered conservative mutations in glmM (HELPY0072 - Ala332, Leu333),
leading to the absence of amplification of the 294-bp
internal fragment of the phosphoglucosamine mutaseencoding gene [36], were observed in five of the 19
MALT lymphoma PAI minus isolates (26%). However,
these mutations were not found in any of the 120 clinical
isolates of this study, nor were they found in more than

Page 9 of 12

400 H. pylori isolates associated with gastritis, peptic
ulcers or metaplasia that were tested with identical oligonucleotides (personal data). These conservative mutations may be indicative of a selective pressure to maintain
these mutations, together with a property encoded by a
gene present in close proximity to glmM, a property that
has yet to be identified. Thus, although none of the
unique properties of B38 were shared by all MALT strains
of the cluster, characterizing a cagPAI minus isolate containing either glmM mutations or HELPY0989-0990
genes may be predictive of MALT lymphoma, as these
two characteristics were found exclusively among the
strains of this cluster.

Conclusion
The study was initiated with the aim of gaining insight
into the existence of bacterial determinism for gastric
extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell MALT lymphoma.
DNA hydridization against the whole genome of 120 clinical isolates revealed a cluster of 19 H. pylori strains, all
completely deprived of cagPAI sequences originating
from patients with MALT lymphoma. We sequenced the
genome of strain B38, a representative of this cluster, and
describe the first genome sequence of a cagPAI minus H.
pylori strain. The absence of the cagPAI, including that of
several non-ubiquitous genes, makes the B38 genome the
smallest H. pylori genome described to date. The cagPAI
minus B38 strain lacks a functional cytotoxin (vacAs2m2)
as well as genes encoding the major adhesion factors
(absence of babB, babC, sabB, and homB); thus, compared with well-known pro-inflammatory H. pylori isolates, it appears to be deprived of all known pathogenic
determinants, but is nonetheless associated with gastric
neoplasia. Further investigation is required to fully
understand the difference in fitness between these strains
with low pro-inflammatory profiles and the human host
factors that may play a significant role in the development
of gastric MALT lymphoma.
Methods
H. pylori strains, and growth

We examined 120 H. pylori strains isolated from patients
from different areas of France enrolled in 3 multi-center
studies carried out by 1) the Groupe d'Etude Français des
Helicobacter (G.E.F.H.), 2) the Groupe d'Etude Français
des Lymphomes Digestifs (G.E.L.D.) [37] and of the Fédération Française de Cancérologie Digestive (F.F.C.D.)
[38], and 3) the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de
l'Adulte (G.E.L.A.). Criteria for patient inclusion were age
(>55 years), suffering from chronic gastritis (n = 33), duodenal ulcer without intestinal metaplasia (27), intestinal
metaplasia without ulcer (n = 17). We identified 43
strains from patients with gastric MALT lymphoma. H.
pylori was isolated from one biopsy specimen following

Thiberge et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/368

biopsy homogenization and culture under microaerophilic conditions (5-6% 02, 8-10% CO2, 80-85% N2) on
blood agar medium (BA; Oxoid blood agar base N°2) supplemented with 10% horse blood, as reported previously
[39]. One colony was selected at random from each primary culture; it was then sub-cultured and used to prepare chromosomal DNA. This DNA was extracted from
48-hour-old confluent cells using the QIAamp Tissue kit
(Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
In house DNA macroarray membrane preparation

A total of 254 PCR products were amplified in four 96well microtiter plates, corresponding to 41 ubiquitous
and 213 non-ubiquitous genes from the genome of strain
26695 as previously described [39]. Briefly, amplification
reactions were performed in 2 × 100 μl reaction volumes,
in which 2 μl of DNA corresponding to the recombinant
plasmid containing the full-length CDS (CoDing
Sequence) inserted into the pILL570-derivative vector
was used as template. Each PCR product was sequenced
to confirm the identity of the gene, and was then spotted
in triplicate onto a nylon membrane (Qfilter, Genetix 22.2
× 22.2 cm, N+) using a Qpix robot (Genetix). Denaturated 26695 genomic DNA was spotted in triplicate at the
four corners of the membrane (positive controls) and
seven squares were left empty as negative controls. Following spot deposition, membranes were fixed for 15
minutes in 0.5 M NaOH 1.5 M NaCl, washed briefly in
distilled water, and stored wet at -20°C until use [39].
Aliquots of 250 μl of DNA were labeled by random
priming with 2 μl of 33P-dCTP. Labeling was performed
for 3 hours at room temperature. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed by purification on Quick Spin
Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Diagnostics). Immediately before being used for hybridization experiments, the
sonicated, labeled, and purified chromosomal DNA was
heat-denaturated and cooled on ice. Hybridization was
conducted in 5 ml prewarmed (65°C) hybridization mixtures containing the heat denaturated probe, with overnight incubation. Membranes were then washed and
exposed for 25 hours to a phosphoimager screen (Molecular Dynamics).
Screens were scanned on a Storm 860 machine (Molecular Dynamics). Image analysis and quantification of
hybridization intensities for each spot were performed
using the Xdots Reader program (COSE) and determined
in pixels [39]. The intensity of the background surrounding each spot was substracted from that of each of the
spots. Twenty-one homologous hybridizations were performed. The average intensity of the 41 ubiquitous genes
was calculated for each reference array. This number
served to allocate a reference array to each heterologous
hybridization (average of the ubiquitous spots from the

Page 10 of 12

heterologous and the homologous reference hybridizations were not significantly different, Student's test), to
calculate the ratio used for normalization. Following normalization, the data were analyzed by attributing a binary
score (presence/absence - Additional file 1) or by multidimensional analysis based on continuous intensity values
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). To define the cutoff ratio for the
presence/absence of a gene, we analyzed the results for
the sequenced H. pylori J99 DNA hybridized with H.
pylori 26695; the threshold for the presence of a gene was
defined as >0.25. The multidimensional analyses (Genesis
software) for the hierarchical clustering as well as for the
Principal Component Analysis were performed using the
254 continuous values from the 120 heterologous hybridization
experiments,
each
corresponding
to
(log10normalized intensity values of strain 26695) minus
(log10normalized intensity values of the heterologous
strain) (i.e. log26695-logheterol.strain).
Sequencing and annotation of the B38 genome

Genomic DNA was randomly sheared by nebulization
(HydroShear, GeneMachines) and the ends were enzymatically repaired. SmaI fragments (1.5-4 kb) were
inserted into plasmid vector pBAM3/SmaI (derived from
pBluescript KS and constructed by R. Heilig). Large (3545 kb) DNA fragments generated from partial BamHIrestriction were inserted into the cosmid vector pHC79/
BamHI.
Plasmid DNA was prepared with the TempliPhi DNA
sequencing template amplification kit (GE HealthcareBio-Sciences). Cosmid DNA was purified with the Montage BAC Miniprep96 Kit (Millipore). Sequencing reactions were performed from both ends of DNA templates
using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing
ready reactions kits and were run on a 3700 or a 3730 xl
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence data base calling was carried out using Phred
[40]. Sequences not meeting our production quality criteria (at least 100 bases called with a quality over 20) were
discarded. Sequences were screened against plasmid vector and E. coli sequences. The traces were assembled
using Phrap and Consed [41]. Whole genome shotgun
sequencing was performed to ensure approximately 11fold coverage. Autofinish [42] was used to design primers
for improving regions of low quality sequence and for
primer walking along templates spanning the gaps
between contigs. Several strategies were used to orientate
contigs and to enable directed PCR-based approaches to
span the gaps between contigs. These strategies included
linking isolates and a Blast-based approach, which identified contigs with hits to the H. pylori strain 26695
genome. Various combined PCR techniques were used to
amplify genomic or cosmid DNA, to close the gaps
between the final contigs. Outward-directed primers

Thiberge et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:368
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/368

were designed for each of the contig ends; the primer
sequences were subsequently checked and confirmed to
be unique to the genome. This combined PCR process
required approximately 200 PCR reactions pairing each
of the primers. In addition, two cosmid isolates containing a rDNA operon copy each, were completely
sequenced by sub-cloning into a pSMART-LC vector
(Lucigen Corp.). The error rate was less than 1 error per
10,000 bp in the final assembly. The complete genome
sequence was obtained from 40 153 sequences, resulting
in 14-fold coverage.
AMIGene software was used to predict which CDSs
were likely to encode proteins [43]. The set of predicted
genes underwent automatic functional annotation using
the set of tools listed in Vallenet et al. [28]. All these data
(syntactic and functional annotations, results of comparative analysis) are stored in a relational database, called
PyloriScope. Manual validation of the automatic annotation was performed using the MaGe (Magnifying
Genomes, http://www.genoscope.cns.fr) web-based
interface, which allows graphic visualization of the annotations enhanced by the synchronized representation of
synteny groups in other genomes chosen for comparison.
