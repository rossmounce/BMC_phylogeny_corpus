brains during development

Abstract
Background: Neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) is evolutionarily well conserved, being present in
invertebrate animals such as the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as in the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster. Multiple cysteines are conserved between species and secondary structure prediction shows that
NDNF is mainly composed of beta-strands. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of NDNF.
Results: NDNF is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded secretory protein that contains a fibronectin type III domain.
NDNF promoted migration and growth and elicited neurite outgrowth of mouse hippocampal neurons in culture.
NDNF also protected cultured hippocamal neurons against excitotoxicity and amyloid beta-peptide toxicity.
Western blotting showed that NDNF was exclusively expressed in the brain and spinal cord. Immunostaining
indicated that NDNF was expressed by neurons and not by astrocytes. Cajal-Retzius cells, cortex neurons,
hippocampus neurons, olfactory mitral cells, cerebellar purkinje cells, cerebellar granular cells and spinal neurons
were found to be NDNF-positive. NDNF expression was observed in the neurons during development.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that NDNF is a novel neurotrophic factor derived from neurons
that may be useful in the treatment of neuronal degeneration diseases and nerve injuries.

Background
Extracellular signal molecules play an important role in
the development of distinct patterns of neuronal growth,
migration, differentiation and function. Neurotrophic
factors (NTFs) are a large class of secreted trophic factors that have been shown to play a critical role in the
development and function of the nervous system [1,2].
NTFs induce differentiation, support the activity of neurons and prevent neuron death in neurodegenerative
disorders and nervous lesions [3-5]. Since the discovery
of nerve growth factor (NGF), many NTFs that are able
to affect neurons in primary culture, during normal
development and in experimental neuron lesions have
been found, including neurotrophins, ciliar neurotrophic
factor and members of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. Our group is currently
trying to identify new neurotrophic factors.

The fly nord gene, which is primarily expressed in the
mushroom body, is involved in olfactory learning [6]. If
fly cells use the same molecules and genes as humans,
then there is a good chance that the pathway is conserved among organisms. The human ortholog of the
nord gene is c4orf31, which encodes a fibronectin typeIII domain-containing protein and belongs to a conserved protein family (Pfam10179: DUF2369) found
from elegans to humans. C4orf31 is highly expressed in
layer 1 cells of neocortex, potentially Cajal-Retzius (CR)
neurons [7]. CR cells are early-developing cells that are
important in cortical lamination [8]. Protein sequence
analysis indicated that c4orf31 protein contains a putative signal peptide and may be secreted by CR cells. As
a fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein and a
putative secreted protein by CR cells, c4orf31 may participate in the regulation of neural development, migration and differentiation.
In this study, c4orf31 was engineered to be expressed
in mammalian cells and identified as secreted glycosylated protein. C4orf31 promotes hippocampal neuron

migration and axons outgrowth in culture. Western
blotting and immunochemistry studies indicated that
c4orf31 is exclusively expressed in the brain and specifically expressed in neurons. Based on these findings,
c4orf31 is defined as neuron-derived neurotrophic factor
(NDNF). Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of
c4orf31 in the mouse brain during development.

concentrated by cold acetone precipitation. Tissue proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer and then separated
by SDS/PAGE. The nitrocellulose membrane signals
were detected by chemiluminescence. NDNF protein was
immunoprecipitated from mouse brain extracts and then
digested with N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to
the manufacturer’s protocols (New England Biolabs).

Methods

Immunostaining of cultured cells

Protein sequence analysis

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 0.4% sucrose for 30 minutes, permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
5 minutes and then blocked with 5% fetal calf serum in
PBS at room temperature for 45 minutes. After blocking,
the cells were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours
with NDNF antibody and anti-ERGIC-53/p58-Cy3, and
then with Alex488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary
antibody for 1 hour. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei.

Human (NP_078850), mouse (NP_765987), bovine
(XP_597721), chicken (XP_420627), frog (NP_001085901),
fly (NP_611900) and nematode (NP_500282) protein
sequences were used in this study. In addition, the rat
NDNF protein sequence was acquired by homology comparison. A sequence alignment software program, Clustalw
2.0, was used to align these protein sequences [9]. A program for displaying phylogenies, Treeview, was used to
display the protein phylogeny [10]. The signal peptide
sequence was predicted using SignalP3.0 [11]. The protein
secondary structure, N-glycosylation sites, disulfide bonds
and globularity were analyzed using the PredictProtein
program package [12-15].
Generation of pNDNF plasmid and transfection

The target gene fragment encoding the full protein was
RT-PCR amplified from human brain tissue using the following primers: forward primer (5’-CCGCTCGAGAGG
ATGGTGCTGCTCCACTGGT-3’); reverse primer
(5’-CCCAAGCTTACAGAACTTTCTAGTTTTCACA
ACC-3’). The products were then inserted between the
XhoI and HindIII restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 (-)/mycHis A, named pNDNF and verified by sequencing. Next,
control and pNDNF plasmids were introduced into
HEK293 and COS7 cells using the phosphate calcium
method described by Jordan et al. [16]. Transfected
HEK293 cells were then used to observe the intracellular
distribution and the NDNF secreted into the culture
medium was detected by western blotting. G418-resistant
COS7 clones were screened for NDNF expression by
immunofluorescence and the conditioned medium was
used to conduct a transwell chemotaxis assay.
Antibodies used and western blotting

Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the NDNF C-terminal
peptide SVKYQSKIVKTRK was prepared (Abmart,
Shanghai). The specificity of NDNF antibody was tested
by peptide blocking and overexpression. Mouse monoclonal antibody to neuN (Chemicon, MAB377), mouse
anti-reelin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, MAB5364),
mouse monoclonal [GF5] antibody to GFAP (abcam,
ab10062), rabbit anti-ERGIC-53/p58-Cy3 (Sigma, E6782),
mouse monoclonal antibody to beta-actin and Myc tag
(Santa Cruz) were used. The conditioned medium was

Histology and immunohistochemistry

All procedures used by our facility are conducted in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and are subject to annual review by the Animal
Care and Use Committee at Henan University. C57BL/6
mice (Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing) were
maintained on a chow diet. Postnatal mouse brains were
fixed by vascular perfusion with 4% PFA in PBS at pH
7.4 at physiological pressures (75-85 mm/Hg for the
anesthetized mice). Mouse embryos were fixed in 4%
PFA overnight at 4°C. Serial sections (5 μm) were used
for HE staining, Nissl staining and immunostaining.
After blocking with 5% goat serum in PBST (Blocking
buffer) for 30 minutes, the sections were incubated with
NDNF, reelin, neuN and GFAP antibody in blocking
buffer for 2 hours. The samples were then probed with
secondary antibody, Alex488 or Alex568-conjugated
anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular probes). All samples were then evaluated using a BX61 fluorescence
microscope (Olympus).
Hippocampal neuron culture

The method used for neuronal culture has been
described previously [17]. Briefly, cover slips were treated overnight with nitric acid. The cover slips were then
coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, P0899) in boric acid
buffer for at least 5 hours, followed by laminin (Sigma,
L2020) in PBS for 2 hours before plating cells. The neonatal wistar rats were then decapitated and their heads
were collected into a dish with chilled HBSS (Sigma,
H4385). Next, the skull was opened and the brain was
removed and transferred into a new dish with chilled
HBSS. The meninges were then removed and the hippocampus was isolated and removed. The hippocampus
was then digested in warmed 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen)

in HEPES buffer (pH7.2) with 1 mM EDTA for 20 minutes at 37°C. A fire-polished Pasteur pipette was then
used to homogenize the hippocampus in DMEM with
10% horse serum (Gibco, 16050130), after which the dissociated cells were centrifuged at 80 g for 5 min. The
supernatants were then removed and the cell pellets

were resuspended in neural basal medium (Gibco,
21103-049) with 1/50 B27 supplement (Invitrogen,
17504-044) and then plated on the cover slips within a
24-well plate at the designated cell density (25,000 cells/
cm2). EGFP expression and neuN co-staining were conducted to verify the culture method.

cells were carefully removed. The migrated neurons
were then photographed with a BX61 microscope and
the number of cells was calculated using the Image Pro
program. The number of migratory neurons, soma area
and neurite length were counted or measured and statistically analyzed by performing student’s t-test in SPSS
12.0 program. A significance level was accepted for p =
0.05. The experiment was repeated three times.
Analysis neuronal survival

Cells were plated at a density of 400 cells/mm2 of culture
surface, and experiments were performed in 3-day-old cultures. Ab25-35 and glutamate were purchased from Sigma
and 1 mM stocks were prepared in sterile water 2 h before
use. Vehicle, NDNF and BDNF, as in the transwell chemotaxis assay, were added to cultures 2 h before addition of
glutamate (10 uM) or Ab (5 uM). Twenty-four hours later,
neuron viability was analyzed by incubating cells with the
mitochondrial dye MTT for 3 hr and then assessed by
quantitation of colorimetric conversion in triplicate. Percent survival is expressed relative to control (100%). Student’s t-test was used for statistical comparisons.

Transwell chemotaxis assay

Transwell (Costar) 24-well inserts with 8 μm pores were
coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin as described
above. Hippocampal neurons were plated on the supports, while the bottom chamber contained control
medium from empty vector-transfected COS7 cells (600
ul), the conditioned medium from pNDNF plasmidtransfected COS7 cells (600 ul) or BDNF (20 ng/ml).
After 2 days, the inserts were fixed in methyl alcohol at
room temperature for 20 min and then stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 20 minutes, after which the upper

Human NDNF gene encodes a 568 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 65 kDa. Analysis using the SignalP software predicted that NDNF has
a signal peptide, which indicates that it may enter the
secretory pathway (Figure 1). Human NDNF contains
two FnIII domains (174-325, 445-554) and belongs to a
conserved protein family (Pfam10179). The fly ortholog,
nord, is primarily expressed in the mushroom body and
is involved in olfactory learning [6]. There are two
potential consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (322,
488), which are conserved among mammalian species.
Human NDNF protein contains ten cysteines, five of
which are conserved from nematodes to humans. Protein secondary structure analysis indicated that NDNF is
a predominantly beta-sheet protein (about 43%) with a
small amount of alpha-helix (about 5%). Prediction of

NDNF is predominantly distributed around the nuclei, representing endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi. The nuclear DNA was labeled with DAPI (blue)
to identify individual cells. Scale bars: 15 um.

the protein globularity demonstrated that NDNF
appears as compact and globular domain. These findings
demonstrate that NDNF is likely to be a glycosylated,
disulfide-bonded, secreted protein and that it may be
involved in neural function.
Intracellular localization and secretory characterization of
NDNF

To determine if human NDNF can function as a
secreted protein, we transfected HEK293 cells with
expression vectors encoding full-length human NDNF.
After 48 h of culture, the mediums from transfected
cells were analyzed by Western blot using NDNF

antibody. As expected, the pcDNA 3.0 vector, which
was used as a negative control, showed no protein band.
Consistent with the requirement for a signal peptide to
induce cellular secretion, the NDNF protein was
detected in the medium (Figure 2). Immunofluorescence
was used to identify the subcellular localization of
human NDNF proteins on transiently transfected cells.
The fluorescence microscope showed that NDNF was
predominantly distributed around the nuclei, and colabeling NDNF and ERGIC-p53/58, a membrane protein
of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, showed that intracellular localization of NDNF was consistent with
secreted proteins (Figure 3) [18].

Glycosylation is a very common phenomenon among
transmembrane and secreted proteins. These glycoproteins are involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions,
or regulation of cell surface receptors and hormone functions. To assess glycosylation of NDNF, NDNF was
immunoprecipitated from mouse brain extracts and then
digested with endoglycosidases PNGase F. Western blots
showed that the digested products migrated at a slightly
lower molecular weight than the undigested protein, indicating the presence of fairly small or few oligosaccharide
groups. These findings are consistent with the two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Figure 4A).

NDNF supports the survival of hippocampal neurons

NDNF promotes neuron migration and neurite growth

NDNF is exclusively expressed in neurons

To verify the primary neuron culture method, the plasmid expressing EGFP protein was transfected and neuN
was identified by immunostaining. The results indicated
that there were a large number of neurons in culture,
and that they were well differentiated (Figure 5A). To
examine the effects of NDNF on hippocamal neurons in
culture, we collected the medium from G418-resistant
COS7 cells that expressed NDNF. After hippocampal
neurons were planted on the inserts, control medium,
the conditioned medium or BDNF were added to the
bottom chamber and incubated for 2 days. The results
indicated that NDNF and BDNF promoted the migration (n = 10), body growth (n = 60) and neurite growth
of hippocampal neurons (n = 60, Figure 5). These findings demonstrated that NDNF is a potent neurotrophic
factor.

Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the
expression pattern of NDNF in mouse tissues, including
the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver and kidney. The
results showed that NDNF protein was only found in
the brain and spinal cord (Figure 4B). Subsequently,
immunofluorescence was used to reveal the expression
of NDNF in the nervous system in greater detail.
Clear immunofluorescence was detected in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and olfactory bulbs (Figure 7). In the
cerebral cortex, NDNF was highly expressed in the marginal zone, representing the Cajal-Retzius cells. In addition,
NDNF was expressed in other neurons under the marginal
zone of the cortex with less abundance. The hippocampal
neurons also expressed NDNF, but the fluorescence is not
strong as in the cortex. In the cerebellum, both Purkinje
cells and granule cells showed specific staining with NDNF

We assessed NDNF’s ability to promote the survival of
hippocampal neurons by MTT assay as described [19].
Exposure of cultures to glutamate (10 uM for 24 h)
resulted in a remarkable reduction in neuron survival.
Pretreatment of cultures with NDNF or BDNF (20 ng/
ml) for 2 h resulted in significant protection against the
toxicity of glutamate (Figure 6). Exposure of cultures to
5 uM Ab resulted in ~40% reduction in neuron survival
during a 24-h exposure period. Pretreatment of cultures
with NDNF and BDNF resulted in significant increases
in neuronal survival (Figure 6).

antibody, while the former had stronger signals. NDNF
also appeared in the olfactory mitral cells.
NDNF protein is co-localized with neuN protein, a
well-known neuronal marker (Figure 8). Double-labeling
by immunohistochemistry with NDNF and GFAP antibody showed that NDNF is expressed in the neurons
and not the astrocytes of the mouse brain and spinal
cord (Figure 9).

postnatal stages, after neuronal migration has been completed most CR cells disappear via cell death. Additionally, studies have shown that CR cells specifically
express reelin protein [20]. In adults, some interneurons
also express reelin protein [21]. Our co-localization
experiments showed that both reelin-positive CR cells
and reelin-positive interneurons that are not in the marginal zone express NDNF (Figure 11).

Expression pattern of NDNF during mouse brain
development

Discussion
Neurotrophic factors play essential roles in the developing and mature nervous system [2,4,22,23]. Accordingly,
the neurotrophic factors and the genes encoding them
have been studied in various developmental disorders,
birth defects and neurodegenerative diseases [24-26]. In
this study, we identified a novel, conserved and potent
neuron-derived neurotrophic factor that may be useful
for the treatment of neural degeneration diseases.
NDNF didn’t resemble the members of the neurotrophin family. The expression level varied among different
neurons and during brain development.
Prototypic neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth
factor (NGF) are secreted target-derived molecules that
bind to transmembrane receptors on the cell surface [27].
The receptor then dimerizes and is activated by transphosphorylation of the catalytic intracellular domain,
which starts a complex intracellular signaling cascade
that leads to immediate, early and late transcriptional
changes in the target cell [28]. Some neurotrophic factors
are secreted, but not derived from a distant target tissue.
These molecules, which include ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), have an auto- or paracrine effect on neuronal cells [3,29]. NDNF is exclusively expressed in
neurons and may act through an auto- or paracrine loop.
Fibronectin type III domain is one of three types of
internal repeats found in the plasma protein fibronectin
[30]. Approximately 2% of all animal proteins contain the
FnIII repeat, including extracellular and intracellular proteins, membrane spanning cytokine receptors, growth
hormone receptors, tyrosine phosphatase receptors and
adhesion molecules. FnIII-like domains are also found in
bacterial glycosyl hydrolases [31]. The FnIII region has a
fold similar to that of immunoglobulin domains, with
seven beta strands forming two antiparallel beta sheets
that are packed against each other [32,33]. FnIII-like
domains of NDNF are distant from other members of
FnIII superfamily, especially the conserved cysteines.
CR cells are transient neurons that contribute to construction of the cerebral cortex at specific developmental
stages, and its axons appear to establish synaptic contacts on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells [8]. Our
results indicated that CR cells also express NDNF protein at high levels, which may nourish CR cells and promote the migration and differentiation of neurons. The

Next, we evaluated changes in NDNF in the developing
mouse brain cortex. NDNF immunopositive cells in the
marginal zone and cortical plate from E16 to P90 were
observed (Figure 10). The results indicated that from
E16 to P0, there were a large number of NDNF immunopositive cells in the marginal zone and cortical plate,
which are neuron-rich tissues. From P7 to adulthood,
the NDNF-expressing neurons in both the marginal
zone and the cortical plate decreased.
Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells, which are the first postmitotic
neurons of the cerebral cortex, populate the marginal
zone throughout the cerebral cortex. During the early

findings presented here also suggest that NDNF might
play an essential role in cortical lamination.

Conclusions
NDNF is a novel neurotrophic factor derived from neurons that may be useful in the treatment of neuronal
degeneration diseases and nerve injuries.
