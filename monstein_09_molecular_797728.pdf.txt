Abstract
Background: Plasmid encoded blaCTX-M enzymes represent an important sub-group of class A
β-lactamases causing the ESBL phenotype which is increasingly found in Enterobacteriaceae including
Klebsiella spp. Molecular typing of clinical ESBL-isolates has become more and more important for
prevention of the dissemination of ESBL-producers among nosocomial environment.
Methods: Multiple displacement amplified DNA derived from 20 K. pneumoniae and 34 K. oxytoca
clinical isolates with an ESBL-phenotype was used in a universal CTX-M PCR amplification assay.
Identification and differentiation of blaCTX-M and blaOXY/K1 sequences was obtained by DNA
sequencing of M13-sequence-tagged CTX-M PCR-amplicons using a M13-specific sequencing
primer.
Results: Nine out of 20 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates had a blaCTX-M genotype. Interestingly, we
found that the universal degenerated primers also amplified the chromosomally located K1-gene in
all 34 K. oxytoca clinical isolates. Molecular identification and differentiation between blaCTX-M and
blaOXY/K1-genes could only been achieved by sequencing of the PCR-amplicons. In silico analysis
revealed that the universal degenerated CTX-M primer-pair used here might also amplify the
chromosomally located blaOXY and K1-genes in Klebsiella spp. and K1-like genes in other
Enterobacteriaceae.
Conclusion: The PCR-based molecular typing method described here enables a rapid and reliable
molecular identification of blaCTX-M, and blaOXY/K1-genes. The principles used in this study could
also be applied to any situation in which antimicrobial resistance genes would need to be
sequenced.

Background
Plasmid encoded blaCTX-M enzymes represent an important sub-group of class-A β-lactamases which hydrolyse
broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics causing an extended
spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype, which is

increasingly found in enterobacterial species including
Klebsiella [1,2]. To date, over 60 different CTX-M-type βlactamases have been described [3] and divided into five
different clusters that reflect similarity at the amino-acid
sequence level, namely blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-MPage 1 of 8

8, blaCTX-M-9, blaCTX-M-25 [2], respectively. More
recently, it has been suggested that blaCTX-M-45 forms a
new, separate cluster [4].

ered indicative of an ESBL-phenotype. Clinical isolates
were stored in glycerol containing Nutrient-broth No 2
(Lab M, Bury, UK) at -70°C until analysis.

Due to constitutive expression of a chromosomal class A
β-lactamases [5], Klebsiella oxytoca was shown to have a
high level resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime [6].
Originally, this class A β-lactamase was named K1 [7] and
later on referred to as KOXY [8] or blaOXY [6]. Sequence
diversity of the chromosomally located K. oxytoca K1-gene
and the existence of discrete groups of blaOXY-1 and
blaOXY-2 genes has been described in detail [5,9].

Susceptibility testing of K. oxytoca with K1-genes and K.
pneumoniae with blaCTX-M genes
MIC-values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime and piperacillin/
tazobactam were determined with Etest (bioMerieux Sverige AB, Askim, Sweden).

Numerous PCR-based typing assays for the identification
of blaCTX-M genes have been developed. Initially, detection of all members belonging to specific blaCTX-M groups
was achieved by combining multiple PCR amplification
assays [10,11]. To avoid multiple CTX-M PCR amplification steps, Boyd and co-workers [12] designed a pair of
universal, degenerated CTX-M primers, allowing the
amplification of hitherto all known blaCTX-M genes. However, identification of a blaCTX-M genotype at the nucleotide level often required cloning of the PCR-amplicons,
followed by DNA sequencing. These methods are labour
intensive, time-consuming, expensive and moreover,
require a battery of amplicon specific sequencing primers.
In this study, we report on the use of a simple, accurate
and universal CTX-M PCR amplification and sequencing
assay well suited for high-throughput analysis.

Bacterial type and reference strains
Control strain K. oxytoca 1980K1 was kindly provided by
Dr. D. Livermore, Health Protection Agency, Antibiotic
Resistance Monitoring and Reference Laboratory, London, UK. Type strains were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection [15] or the Culture Collection
University of Gothenburg [16]; K. pneumoniae ATCC
700603, K. pneumoniae CCUG 54718, and K. oxytoca
CCUG 15717T.
Multiple displacement amplification of bacterial DNA
To perform multiple genotyping analysis of our growing
collection of CTX-M suspected K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca of clinical origin and omitting tedious bacterial culturing, sufficient amounts of bacterial DNA were
produced by means of multiple displacement amplification of bacterial DNA [17]. For that purpose, bacteria
from frozen cultures (1 μl) and from the reference strains
were added to a GenomiPhi-DNA V2 amplification-kit
cocktail as recommended by the manufacturer (GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden).

Methods
Screening of Klebsiella spp. for cephalosporin resistance
during 2001–spring 2007
At the Department of Clinical Microbiology, University
Hospital Linköping, susceptibility testing was performed
on all Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca clinical isolates.
Cefadroxil was used for the screening of cephalosporin
resistance which was followed up by testing of resistant
isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime or direct testing
with cefotaxime and ceftazidime [14]. A biochemical
panel for identification and differentiation of Klebsiella
spp. was used. Indole-negative Klebsiella spp. clinical isolates were identified as K. pneumoniae and indole-positive
clinical isolates as K. oxytoca.
Phenotypic ESBL-screening
All cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime resistant clinical isolates were phenotypically screened by Etest using ceftazidime and cefotaxime with and without clavulanic acid
(bioMerieux Sverige AB, Askim, Sweden). A reduction of
MIC by ≥3 twofold dilutions of the cephalosporin in the
presence of clavulanic acid, i. e. a MIC ratio of ≥8 or the
presence of phantom- or deformation zones was consid-

Universal blaCTX-M gene PCR amplification
A PCR amplification assay was carried out using 10 pmol
of each universal degenerated primer M13-CTX-M.U1.SE
(CGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATGTGCAGYACCAGTAARGTKATGGC)
and
CTX-M.U2.AS
(TGGGTRAARTARGTSACCAGAAYCAGCGG) targeting
the CTX-M and OXY/K1-enzyme genes [modified from
12] and a HotStarTaq-Master mix (Qiagen GmbH,
Hilden, Germany) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl
using an Applied Biosystems thermo cycler 2720 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and 200 μl thin-walled reaction tubes. This yields an approximately 600 bp PCR
amplicon corresponding to 68% of the CTX-M and OXY/
K1-enzyme encoding nucleotide sequences.

PCR amplification conditions were as follows: initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s; annealing at 55°C for 30 s;
extension at 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension step at
72°C for 10 min. Subsequently, PCR-amplicons were separated electrophoretically on a precast 2% agarose E-gel
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

DNA sequence analysis
DNA sequence analysis of M13-sequence tagged CTX-M
PCR-amplicons was carried out using a M13 uni (-21)
primer by a customer DNA sequencing service (Eurofins
MWG Operon GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Prior to
DNA sequencing, PCR-amplicons were treated with
ExoSAP-IT to inactivate excess of oligonucleotide primers,
following the supplier's protocol (USB Europe GmbH,
Staufen, Germany). The PCR products were then
lyophilised and sequenced. Generated DNA sequences
were aligned, edited and compared with blaCTX-M DNA
and blaCTX-M-like DNA sequences using the CLC bioinformatics freeware v.3.2.3 [18]. blaCTX-M, blaOXY, K1, and
K1-like DNA sequences were retrieved from the NCBI Entrez Nucleotide database [19].

for primer comparison in figure 1 and DNA sequences
derived from the clinical isolates was constructed using
the CLC bioinformatics freeware v.3.2.3 [18] and UPGMA
clustering (Fig. 2). DNA sequences were edited to comprise the relevant DNA sequences between the two universal degenerated CTX-M primers (Fig. 1).

Results
Distribution of Klebsiella spp
The number of K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca clinical isolates of each year was in the range 457 to 864 (K. pneumo-

niae) and 270 to 455 (K. oxytoca), respectively, comprising
99% of the genus Klebsiella collected and analysed at the
Department of Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital, Linköping, Sweden.
Screening of cephalosporin resistance and ESBLphenotype
The cefadroxil resistance rate was in the range of 1.5% to
3.2% for K. pneumoniae and 3.7% to 6.4% for K. oxytoca.
Twenty K. pneumoniae and 34 K. oxytoca clinical isolates
were selected from a positive ESBL-phenotypic screening
during 2001 to spring 2007. All K. oxytoca isolates (n = 34)
revealed an ESBL-phenotype by screening with Etest using
cefotaxime with and without clavulanic acid. All isolates
were negative in the corresponding test with ceftazidime.
Similarly, a majority of K. pneumoniae isolates (16 of 20)
revealed an ESBL-phenotype in both ESBL Etests. Two of
the K. pneumoniae isolates revealed an ESBL-phenotype
only with cefotaxime and two isolates only with ceftazidime, respectively.
blaCTX-M PCR amplification and partial DNA sequence
analysis
DNA sequencing of M13-sequence-tagged universal CTXM PCR-amplicons of MDA-DNA derived from K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca of clinical origin revealed the presence
of blaCTX-M genes in 9 out of 20 K. pneumoniae and the
presence of the K1-gene in all 34 K. oxytoca clinical isolates. According to the phylogenetic tree constructed from
partial blaCTX-M, blaOXY and K1-DNA sequences located
between the two universal degenerated primers (Fig. 1),
nine K. pneumoniae clinical isolates formed a unique cluster with E. coli blaCTX-M-15, [GenBank:AY044436] and E.
coli blaCTX-M-28 [GenBank:AJ549244] which itself is
closely related to the C. freundii CTX-M-3 [GenblaCTX-M-3
K.
oxytoca
[GenBank:Y10278],
blaCTX-M-1
and
E.
coli
Bank:AB185840],
[GenBank:X92506] cluster, respectively (Fig. 2). Similarly,
the K. oxytoca K1 clinical isolates form a unique K1/
blaOXY-2 cluster together with K. oxytoca K1 [GenBank:AF473577, AY077489, AY055205, AY077487,
AY077485, and AY077488] and K. oxytoca blaOXY-2 [GenBank:Y17714], respectively (Fig 2). None of the K. oxytoca
K1 clinical isolates clustered within the K1/blaOXY-1 cluster. Clearly, partial DNA sequence analysis of the CTX-M
PCR-amplicons did not allow an unequivocal discrimination of the blaCTX-M genes. However, our data indicate the
presence of a blaCTX-M-15/28 genotype in the K. pneumoniae clinical isolates.

Susceptibility testing of K. oxytoca with K1-genes and K.
pneumoniae with blaCTX-M genes
The MIC-values for cefotaxime and ceftazidime for the K.
oxytoca isolates were in the range of 0.5 to 8 mg/l and
0.125 to 4 mg/l, respectively. Corresponding MIC-values

for the K. pneumoniae isolates with CTX-M genotypes were
in the range of 64 to 256 mg/l and 16 to 256 mg/l, respectively. The susceptibility for piperacillin/tazobactam was
lower in the K. oxytoca isolates with MIC-values ≥128 mg/
l compared to MIC-values between 4 to 64 mg/l for the K.
pneumoniae isolates.
In silico DNA sequence comparison
The finding that the universal degenerated CTX-M
primer-pair amplified the chromosomally located K1enzyme in K. oxytoca prompted us to perform a DNA
sequence alignment of the universal CTX-M primer-pair
with Enterobacteriaceae blaCTX-M, blaOXY, K1, and K1-like
genes retrieved from the Entrez Nucleotide database
(Methods). As illustrated in figure 1, the universal degenerated CTX-M primers revealed a high degree of DNA
sequence similarity between the target sequences present
in the E. coli, S. Typhimurium, C. freundii and C.

amalonaticus blaCTX-M type-gene; K. oxytoca blaCTX-M-3
and blaCTX-M-35 genes, K. oxytoca K1 and blaOXY-1 to
blaOXY-6 genes; the chromosomally encoded C. sedlakii
Sed-1 and C. amalonaticus CdiA showed a lower degree of
sequence similarity compared to C. koseri CKO, P. vulgaris K1, P. vulgaris CumA, and P. penneri HugA genes,
respectively. With the exception of C. koseri CKO, P. vulgaris K1, P. vulgaris CumA and P. penneri HugA DNA
sequences, most of the nucleotide variations are
observed at 5'-Y, R, K-3' positions in primer CTX-MU1.SE and 5'-R, R, R, S, Y-3' positions (were R stands for
purine, Y stands for pyrimidine, S stands for G or C, and
K stands for G or T) in primer CTX-M-U2.AS (Fig. 1). The
GC-rich 3'-ends of the primers are highly conserved
within the corresponding blaCTX-M, blaOXY, and K1 target DNA sequences. This may explain why the universal
degenerated CTX-M primer-pair amplified blaCTX-M and
K1 sequences.

Discussion
The increased prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae that produce blaCTX-M enzymes makes new demands on clinical
routine microbiology laboratories to perform blaCTX-M
typing. Due to the growing number of blaCTX-M enzymes,
the traditional iso-electrofocusing appears not to be the
method of choice for establishing an enterobacterial
blaCTX-M genotype any longer. Molecular techniques for
identification and classification of blaCTX-M genes in clinical isolates on a large scale have been described. Recently,
a multiplex CTX-M PCR (MP-PCR) amplification assay
was described which allows differentiation between different blaCTX-M subtype groups [21]. However, using this
particular MP-PCR assay, we often observed non-specific
PCR amplification in K. oxytoca isolates. Subsequent cloning and DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the unspecific PCR-amplicons represented K1-enzyme gene
sequences. Thus, misinterpretation of strains as active
blaCTX-M producers based on false positive PCR amplification might cause false reporting of blaCTX-M genes in K.
oxytoca.
A different approach has been used by Galas and co-workers [22]. These authors described the use of a CTX-M-consensus primer-pair to establish a blaCTX-M-genotype in
Enterobacteriaceae, including K. oxytoca [22]. However, in
silico DNA sequence analysis reveals that this consensus
CTX-M primer-pair [23] also targets blaOXY/K1-genes such
as K. oxytoca blaOXY-2 [Genbank:Y17714] at positions
348–367 (MA1 primer) and 872–391 (MA2 primer), and
K1 gene [GenBank:AY077482] at positions 369–378
(MA1 Primer) and 893–911 (MA2 primer), respectively.
Thus, based on PCR amplification alone, it seems to be far
from clear whether these K. oxytoca isolates would have a
blaCTX-M, or a blaOXY/K1-genotype, respectively. This
question can only be settled by DNA-sequencing of the
PCR amplicons.
The use of M13-sequence tagged PCR-amplicons in combination with M13-specific sequencing primers was originally described for sequencing of Staphylococcus aureus
protein A (Spa-typing) PCR-amplicons [24]. Our results
employing the same technique for sequencing of β-lactamase PCR amplicons convincingly demonstrate that that
the use of a M13-sequence tagged CTX-M.U1.SE primer
allowed for an unequivocal discrimination of blaCTX-M
and K1-genes. Moreover, our results support our previous
findings indicating that blaCTX-M and K1-enzyme genes
might have some degree of sequence similarity [13].
Extended in silico analysis furthermore revealed a high
degree of sequence similarities between Enterobacteriaceae
blaCTX-M, blaOXY 1–6, and K1 related sequences (Fig. 1),
respectively. Thus, based on PCR amplification alone
using universal degenerated CTX-M primer-pairs, it would
be difficult, not to say impossible to distinguish between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/7

an Enterobacteriaceae blaCTX-M or K1/OXY genotype if
sequencing had not been performed.
Fournier and co-workers [8] have described the existence
of two discrete groups of K. oxytoca blaOXY-1 and blaOXY-2
enzymes. Later on, it was shown that blaOXY-1 and blaOXY2 genes are expressed in two genetic K. oxytoca groups,
namely K. oxytoca strain SG266 and SG271, respectively
[25]. So far, six groups of OXY β-lactamases have been
identified and characterised in K. oxytoca [26]. In our
study we have found that all K. oxytoca clinical isolates
form a distinct K. oxytoca K1/OXY-2 cluster group distinguishable from the K1/OXY-1 and the K. pneumoniae CTXM15/28 cluster group, respectively. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree that was established implies the existence of a
chromosomally located β-lactamase super-gene family in
Enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with previous reports describing that chromosomally encoded class
A β-lactamases found in Klebsiella species are highly conserved at the amino-acid level compared to class A β-lactamases found in other Enterobacteriaceae [27-31]. The
Citrobacter spp. DNA sequences included in the phylogenetic tree form separate clades. This is in agreement with
earlier reports showing that C. koseri CKO-1 and C.
amalonaticus CdiA isolates carry highly divergent β-lactamase genes despite the fact that they show a highly similar
biochemical profile and 16S rDNA sequence similarity
[32]. Biochemical methods may not always be adequate
to identify Klebsiella spp. and their phylogenetic groups in
clinical microbiology laboratories because several species
share similar biochemical profiles [33,34]. Therefore,
molecular techniques as applied in the present study may
help to accomplish bacterial genotyping at reasonable
costs and time.
MIC-value determination of piperacillin/tazobactam in
this study also distinguished between K. oxytoca with K1 βlactamase from CTX-M producing K. pneumoniae, showing
higher MIC-values. Furthermore, the MIC-values for cefotaxime and ceftazidime for K. oxytoca with K1-genes was
lower than for CTX-M producing K. pneumoniae. Similar
results have been reported by Potz and co-workers [35].

Conclusion
The PCR-based molecular typing method described here
enables a rapid and reliable identification of CTX-M and
OXY/K1-genes. The principles used in the present study
can be applied to any situation in where antimicrobial
resistance genes are to be sequenced. This is desirable
because only sequencing of full-length reading frames will
allow for an unequivocal discrimination between various
subtypes of antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaCTXM, blaSHV and blaTEM gene-families, respectively. Moreover, the use of M13-sequence tagged primers in PCR

amplification assays facilitates amplicon sequencing since
only one single sequencing primer (M13) is required.
