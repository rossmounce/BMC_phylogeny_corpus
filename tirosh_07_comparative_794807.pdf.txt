Current genomes were shaped by numerous duplications of
single genes, chromosomal segments and even entire
genomes [1-3]. In most cases, one copy of the duplicated gene
is rapidly lost either by deletion or through mutations ('nonfunctionalization'), reflecting the lack of selection for each
individual copy. In other cases, however, both duplicates may

Results: We developed a novel method to compare expression profiles from different organisms
and applied it to analyze the expression divergence of yeast duplicated genes. The expression
profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae duplicate pairs were compared with those of their preduplication orthologs in Candida albicans. Duplicate pairs were classified into two classes,
corresponding to symmetric versus asymmetric rates of expression divergence. The latter class
includes 43 duplicate pairs in which only one copy has a significant expression similarity to the C.
albicans ortholog. These may present cases of regulatory neofunctionalization, as supported also by
their dispensability and variability.

deposited research

Background: Gene duplication provides raw material for the generation of new functions, but
most duplicates are rapidly lost due to the initial redundancy in gene function. How gene function
diversifies following duplication is largely unclear. Previous studies analyzed the diversification of
duplicates by characterizing their coding sequence divergence. However, functional divergence can
also be attributed to changes in regulatory properties, such as protein localization or expression,
which require only minor changes in gene sequence.

suggested [4]. First, duplicates could be retained due to selection for robustness through redundancy [5], although this
view has been frequently challenged [6,7]. Second, selection
for high protein dosage may favor the presence of two gene
copies [8]. In these cases, similarity between the two copies
can be maintained by negative selection or by gene conversion. Third, each of the duplicates may specialize in a subset
of the ancestral functions, such that the ancestral functions
require the activity of both genes ('subfunctionalization').
Fourth, one of the duplicates may retain the ancestral functions while the other evolves to perform a novel function
('neofunctionalization'). Identifying these scenarios and, in
particular, recognizing cases of neofunctionalization may
provide new insights into genome evolution, since duplications are believed to constitute the main origin of novel
functions.
The term neofunctionalization refers to the acquisition of a
novel function. However, it is typically difficult to define what
the function of a gene is, and what constitutes a novel function. One obvious aspect of gene function is the catalytic
activity performed by encoded enzymes. A broader definition
of gene function, however, should include other aspects, such
as protein localization, interactions with other proteins and
expression patterns. These features are usually difficult to
infer from the protein sequence, but the abundance of functional genomics datasets and the advent of microarray technology can now be used to analyze these properties directly.
Of particular interest are the expression patterns of genes in
various conditions. Changes in expression patterns have been
suggested to be the primary source of phenotypic divergence
among related species [9]. Such regulatory changes can have
a profound effect on the function of a duplicated gene and,
thus, lead to the preservation of a duplicate pair [10-12]. We
refer to this scenario, where one copy of a duplicate pair
diverges in expression pattern thereby facilitating the acquisition of a novel function, as regulatory neofunctionalization.
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model to
study the diversification of duplicate gene pairs. First, extensive functional annotations and expression data are available
for S. cerevisiae. Second, the S. cerevisiae ancestor has
undergone a whole genome duplication (WGD) event about
100 million years ago [13]. Sequencing of the pre-duplication
yeast, Kluyveromyces waltii, identified hundreds of duplicate gene-pairs that were retained following this WGD event
[2]. Many of these duplicate pairs accumulated extensive
divergence and evolved new or altered functions. For example, sequence comparisons between S. cerevisiae duplicate
pairs and their single orthologs from K. waltii revealed that in
a significant portion of the duplicate pairs (115 out of 457),
one copy has diverged in sequence significantly faster than
the other copy [2]. This was taken as evidence for neofunctionalization, with the more conserved copy retaining the
ancestral function and the other copy evolving to perform a
new or altered function. A similar analysis of expression pat-

Recent studies reported that 40% of the duplicate pairs in S.
cerevisiae differ significantly in their expression patterns
[14,15]. However, to identify cases of neofunctionalization,
the expression pattern of each of the copies must be compared with the ancestral expression pattern. To circumvent
this problem, Gu et al. [15] focused on gene families that contain a duplicate pair and at least one additional gene that was
assumed to represent the ancestral expression pattern. In the
absence of data about the expression of the ancestral genes,
however, the validity of this assumption is difficult to assess.
Here we analyze the diversification of yeast duplicates by
directly comparing their expression patterns in a post-duplication species (S. cerevisiae) to those of their single orthologs
in a pre-duplication species (Candida albicans) as a proxy for
the ancestral gene expression. We first describe a general
method for comparative analysis of expression profiles from
related organisms. We apply this method to compare large
datasets from hundreds of microarray experiments in both
yeast species. Focusing on duplicate gene pairs, we identify 43
duplicated gene pairs with asymmetric rates of expression
divergence. These gene pairs are likely to present instances of
regulatory neofunctionalization. Notably, the level of
sequence divergence in many of these duplicates is similar,
emphasizing the need to include gene regulation as a complementary means for analyzing functional divergence.

Results

We first describe our method for comparison of expression
profiles between one-to-one orthologs from two organisms,
and later extend it to examine the expression conservation of
duplicate gene pairs.

A novel method for comparative analysis of gene
expression
Ideally, we wish to compare the transcription responses of the
S. cerevisiae genes to those of their C. albicans orthologs
under the same set of conditions. However, the expression
data of the two species was measured under different conditions and by different laboratories and could not be directly
compared. We thus developed a novel method for comparing
the expression profiles of two organisms, called 'iterative
comparison of coexpression' (ICC; see Materials and methods
and Figure 1). To analyze the expression conservation of an
orthologous gene pair from S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans (aicer and aican, respectively), we compare their expression correlations with all other one-to-one orthologous pairs
(agcer, agcan; g = 1n), as described below. This method follows
the conceptual framework described by Ihmels et al. [16] and
Dutilh et al. [17] and compares the architecture of the coexpression networks.

if ajcer and ajcan have highly divergent expression profiles, then

Dutilh et al. [17] defined expression conservation as the similarity between (i) the expression correlations between a gene
from S. cerevisiae (aicer) and all other S. cerevisiae genes

its ortholog from Candida albicans (aican) and all other Candida albicans orthologs (agcan, g = 1..n), that is:

other genes (with orthologs) from the same genome. Equivalent rows in the two matrices correspond to the correlation vectors of a pair of orthologs
with all other orthologs from the respective genomes. The correlation between these vectors of correlations is defined as the initial estimation of
expression conservation (EC0). EC scores are then iteratively refined by calculating weighted Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCw) where EC scores
from the previous iteration are used as weights and genes with negative weights are excluded from the calculation. This procedure is repeated until
convergence of the EC scores (ECk ≈ ECk - 1). The iterative procedure can also be initiated from random weights to verify the convergence to a global
minimum (see Materials and methods).

approximately 1,700 expression profiles for S. cerevisiae and
244 expression profiles for C. albicans [16,19]. The results are

applied ten times with randomly chosen initial weights (red), and ten times
with randomly selected subsets of the expression conditions (blue). The
correlations between these controls and expression conservation (from
the original application) are shown after one to ten iterations. (b)
Expression conservation values were calculated by ICC for all S. cerevisiaeC. albicans orthologs (solid black), duplicates from the WGD and their C.
albicans ancestors (solid grey; both duplicates from each pair were
compared to their ancestor), and randomly selected S. cerevisiae-C. albicans
gene pairs (dashed black). Distributions are shown for bins of 0.1.

(Ri,gcer and Ri,gcan), larger weight should be given to orthologous pairs whose expression has been conserved. In other
words, when comparing a pair of orthologs, we would like to
focus on their correlations with other orthologous pairs
whose expression has been conserved.
To account for this effect, we employ an iterative algorithm
that estimates expression conservation iteratively (see Figure
1 and Materials and methods). Briefly, at the first iteration,
expression conservation is calculated as in Dutilh et al. [17];
at each subsequent iteration, the expression conservation values from the previous iteration are used as weights to calcu-

Several tests were performed to validate the results. First, we
ran the algorithm several times, starting from randomly chosen initial weights for each orthologous pair. In all cases the
algorithm converged to the same results (Figure 2a), thus verifying the robustness of the iterative procedure. Second, we
ran the algorithm with randomly chosen subsets of the
expression datasets consisting of half the number of conditions for each species. Also in this case, the algorithm converged to the same results (Figure 2a). Third, we defined the
set of conserved and divergent genes (5% highest or lowest
expression conservation values, respectively) and examined
their properties. Approximately 60% of the most conserved S.
cerevisiae genes are essential [20] compared with 26% for all
genes with orthologs in C. albicans (p < 10-16 by the hypergeometric test). Furthermore, ribosome biogenesis was found
to be the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) term among the
conserved genes (p < 10-50 by hypergeometric test), whereas
mitochondrion and mitochondrial ribosome were the most
enriched GO terms among the divergent genes (p < 10-17 for
both by hypergeometric test). Indeed, these latter groups
have undergone a large-scale adaptation of their expression
profiles following the WGD [19]. Thus, the results of our algorithm are in good agreement with prior knowledge and expectations. Finally, we compared the distribution of expression
conservation scores obtained for the orthologous pairs to that
obtained for randomly chosen (non-orthologous) gene pairs.
Expression conservation was higher for orthologs than nonorthologs (Figure 2b), indicating that the expression networks of the two yeast species have retained significant
similarities.

Comparison of duplicate gene pairs with their single
orthologs
We next focused on the expression conservation of duplicate
gene pairs. To this end, we used the expression conservation
scores generated by the ICC for each of the one-to-one
orthologs as weights to calculate the expression conservation
of duplicate genes. Namely, for each duplicate gene pair in S.
cerevisiae, we calculated two expression conservation scores
between each of the duplicates and their single ortholog from
C. albicans (see Materials and methods).

interactions

As shown in Figure 3a, a large percentage of the duplicates
appear to have evolved at a similar rate, as both gene pairs
show similar expression conservation to their single C. albicans orthologs (for example, 79 duplicates in the yellow
region). Notably, however, a similarly large fraction of duplicate pairs display distinctly different levels of expression conservation (for example, 63 duplicates in the green region).
These cases indicate asymmetric rates of expression evolution
among the two duplicate genes.

The first class corresponds to duplicate gene pairs for which
the expression of both copies resembles that of the C. albicans
ortholog. Of these duplicate pairs, 28 have significantly high
expression conservation for both copies; we refer to these as
duplicate pairs with conserved expression. This class includes
duplicate pairs whose divergence is probably related to other
aspects of protein function, such as protein structure or interactions. In addition, duplicates in this class tend to have
higher mRNA and protein abundance [21,22] than other
duplicates (Additional data file 2), suggesting that some of
these duplicate pairs could have been retained due to selection for high dosage.

the 96 duplicate pairs in which at least one of the copies has
significantly high expression conservation (EC > 0.37; see
dashed line in Figure 3a). This constraint removed cases for
which it is difficult to infer the ancestral expression pattern,
since the C. albicans expression pattern is much different
from that of both duplicate genes. The expression conservation of the least conserved duplicates, in these cases, display
a bimodal distribution with a boundary at approximately EC
= 0 (Figure 3b). This distribution thus partitions the duplicate gene pairs into two classes.

deposited research

Out of the 457 duplicate pairs from the WGD event [2], we
focused on 244 pairs compiled with the following two conditions. First, we performed a phylogenetic analysis and
required that a single ortholog from C. albicans was predicted
for both of the duplicates and that no other in-paralogs were
found in S. cerevisiae (Materials and methods). This single
ortholog serves as an out-group to estimate the expression of
the ancestral gene before the WGD. Second, to avoid cases
where the duplicates cross-hybridize to microarrays, thus
leading to artificial correlations, we considered only duplicate
pairs whose nucleotide sequence similarity was lower than
90%.

Recent studies have suggested that duplicate pairs arising
from a WGD event have different characteristics to those arising from smaller-scale duplications [26-28]. To examine if
this is the case with respect to gene expression evolution, we

repeated the analysis presented above with 46 gene pairs
from S. cerevisiae that were predicted to arise from smallscale duplications after speciation from C. albicans (see
Materials and methods). Interestingly, only 1 duplicate pair
had asymmetric expression divergence while 14 duplicate
pairs had conserved expression (see Additional data file 3).
This ratio is much different from the results in the WGD analysis where 43 duplicate pairs had asymmetric expression
divergence and only 28 duplicate pairs had conserved expression. This difference may indicate that divergence of WGD
duplicates is more likely to occur through regulatory divergence compared with small-scale duplicates.

Duplicate gene pairs with asymmetric expression divergence are predicted
to evolve by neofunctionalization, such that the copy with the higher EC
(conserved) retained the ancestral function and the copy with the lower
EC (divergent) performs a novel function. The percentage of essential
genes, the average normalized sequence divergence [24] and the average
normalized expression divergence [25] are shown for the conserved
duplicates, divergent duplicates and all duplicates. Error-bars correspond
to standard error, calculated by bootstrapping with 1,000 repeats.

Properties of duplicates predicted to undergo
regulatory neofunctionalization
Within a duplicate pair predicted to undergo regulatory neofunctionalization, our analysis distinguishes the conserved
from the divergent copy. We next compared the set of conserved copies with that of the divergent copies using several
datasets. First, we examined the fraction of essential genes
[20] in the two gene sets. While eight of the conserved copies
are essential, all of the divergent copies are dispensable (Figure 4). Second, we examined the extent of sequence variability [24], as well as expression variability [25], of these genes
among the closely related sensu-stricto species, which
diverged from S. cerevisiae long after the WGD. In both cases,
the divergent copies were, on average, more variable than the
conserved ones (Figure 4), indicating that they are still evolving rapidly. Taken together, these results suggest that the
conserved copies typically perform stable and important
functions, while the divergent copies are dispensable and
undergoing continuous fine-tuning, as expected for newly
derived functions.

To verify the asymmetric divergence of these duplicate pairs
we also performed an ancestral reconstruction analysis; since
our method relies on correlations of expression with multiple
genes, we performed a parsimony-based reconstruction [23]
for each correlation value (see Materials and methods). This
allowed us to decompose the expression divergence of each
duplicate gene into two components: duplicate versus ancestor and ancestor versus C. albicans ortholog (Figure 3c). By
definition, the ancestral reconstruction procedure tends to
estimate an ancestral state that is an intermediate between
the two duplicates. However, asymmetric expression divergence was still evident when examining the duplicate versus
ancestor expression similarity (Table 1 and Figure 3c). In all
cases, the expression similarity of the divergent copy was
much lower than that of the conserved copy, and in most
cases even lower than zero. Furthermore, the predicted
ancestral expression patterns were more similar to the C.
albicans patterns in duplicate pairs with asymmetric divergence compared to duplicate pairs with conserved expression
(Figure 3c; p = 0.004 in a Wilcoxon rank sum test). This
implies that expression of the duplicate pairs with asymmetric divergence is, in general, highly conserved, and divergence
in these cases was restricted to one of the copies after
duplication.

ancestral function while the divergent copy performs a novel

with symmetric expression divergence, such that both S. cerevisiae gene pairs displayed similar conservation with their C.
albicans ortholog. The expression of many of these duplicate
pairs is highly correlated (not shown), suggesting that they
were retained by selection for high protein dosage or evolved
through other functional aspects, such as protein structure or

substitutions were predicted in at least one of the copies are included (see
Materials and methods and Table 1). Red circles indicate duplicates with

the linear regression. The sign of sequence divergence asymmetry
indicates the consistency between sequence and expression divergence
(that is, negative values refer to duplicate pairs where the faster evolving
copy in terms of sequence is the slower evolving copy in terms of
expression).

Divergence of protein sequence versus expression
pattern
We asked whether the observed asymmetry in the evolution
of duplicates' expression patterns is correlated with asymmetric evolution of protein sequences [17,29,30]. To this end,
we used a parsimony-based approach to asses the protein
sequence divergence of each of the WGD duplicates from
their pre-duplication ancestors (see Materials and methods
and Table 1). We then compared the asymmetry of protein
sequence divergence with that of expression divergence as
estimated in the ancestral reconstruction analysis (Figure 5;
see Materials and methods). The two measures of asymmetry
are only weakly correlated (r = 0.15, p = 0.11). While most of
the copies with asymmetric expression divergence also have
high asymmetry of sequence divergence, others show similar
levels of sequence divergence, and some even show an opposite trend where the divergent copy in terms of expression is
more conserved in terms of sequence (negative sequence
divergence asymmetry in Figure 5). These results suggest that
although in many cases protein sequence and expression
divergence are correlated, they represent distinct evolutionary mechanisms for the acquisition of novel functions.

Discussion

We developed a new method for comparative analysis of
genome-wide expression data (ICC) and applied it to characterize the diversification of yeast duplicates that originated at

The second class includes 43 duplicate gene pairs in which
one copy showed a significant expression similarity to the C.
albicans ortholog while the other copy displayed no similarity
to the C. albicans ortholog. Some of these cases may represent neutral evolution of gene expression that has no functional significance. Alternatively, these cases may involve
regulatory neofunctionalization. Although our method is not
capable of detecting the action of directional selection, as
required for neofunctionalization, the high conservation of
one copy and the total lack of conservation of the other copy
appear to be inconsistent with a neutral model. We thus interpreted this class as enriched with cases of regulatory
neofunctionalization.
Another alternative interpretation is that this pattern indicates evolution by subfunctionalization, whereby the expression of the ancestral gene is partitioned between the two
copies [4,11]. Our method does not compare the expression of
duplicates and their orthologs under the same conditions,
and thus subfunctionalization can lead to different patterns of
expression conservation and is difficult to infer. In contrast,
the neofunctionalization model clearly predicts that the gene
with ancestral function will have high expression
conservation, while the gene with derived function has low
expression conservation. Our observations are, therefore,
more consistent with the neofunctionalization model. It is
important to note, however, that the neofunctionalization
and subfunctionalization models are not mutually exclusive.
For example, duplicates can evolve by subfunctionalization in
terms of protein structure but by neofunctionalization in
terms of expression profile. Furthermore, an initial subfunctionalization can be followed by neofunctionalization [31].
Our interpretation of neofunctionalization of the indicated
genes is supported by their increased dispensability and
enhanced variability in sequence and expression among
closely related yeast species. Importantly, each of these 43
cases (Table 1) entails a prediction for the function of the
ancestral protein in C. albicans and the evolutionary trajectory of the duplicate pair.
The new functions encoded by genes that evolved by neofunctionalization probably had an important role in the adaptation of yeast following the WGD. Perhaps the most significant
adaptation of the S. cerevisiae lineage was the transformation
from aerobic to predominantly anaerobic metabolism [32].

The Inparanoid software [18] was used to identify one-to-one
orthology between genes in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans.
Duplicate pairs from the WGD were taken from Kellis et al.
[2] and filtered with the following phylogenetic analysis: for
each duplicate pair we constructed a clustalw multiple alignment of the duplicates, their single K. waltii ortholog (which
was determined by synteny [2]) and all other matches from S.
cerevisiae and C. albicans with a BLAST p value smaller than
10-4. These alignments were used to construct a neighborjoining phylogenetic tree with the jukes-cantor distance, after
ignoring gaps. We then demanded that each tree (or its
subtree) contain only the pair of duplicates, the syntenic K.
waltii ortholog and a single C. albicans ortholog. To further
verify the C. albicans ortholog we also verified that the K.
waltii ortholog and one of the duplicates are its best matches
in the corresponding genomes.
The set of smaller-scale duplications was defined by: first,
taking all duplications predicted by Inparanoid (that is, clusters of one C. albicans gene and two S. cerevisiae genes); second, excluding those that were predicted to arise from the
WGD [2]; and third, filtering the remaining set using the phylogenetic analysis described above.

This corresponds to the initial estimation of expression conservation (EC) in which identical weights are given to the correlations with all genes. We then iteratively refined this
measure by calculating a weighted correlation, where the
weight for a correlation with each gene is given by the EC of
that gene from the previous iteration:

Expression datasets for S. cerevisiae and C. albicans containing multiple experimental conditions were collected as
described in Ihmels et al. [16]. These expression matrices
were restricted to genes for which orthology relationships
were identified and ordered accordingly (that is, equivalent
rows of the two matrices correspond to the expression
profiles of a pair of orthologs). Next, these matrices were converted into correlation matrices by calculating, within each
organism, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between
the expression profiles of each pair of genes, over all the con-

Genes can evolve new functions by modulation of different
characteristics, including the structure, physical interactions,
expression patterns and localization of the proteins they
encode. A comprehensive understanding of functional divergence thus requires an integrated analysis of different measures of divergence. Here, we studied the expression
divergence of yeast duplicate pairs and identified 43 pairs
with asymmetric divergence that is compatible with regulatory neofunctionalization. Importantly, most of these were
not identified by sequence analysis [2] and, in general, the
asymmetry of sequence divergence and that of expression
divergence were only marginally correlated. Future studies
will undertake the challenge of integrating these and other
data types to provide a better understanding of the functional
diversification of genes following duplications.

Neofunctionalization could also refine the function of existing
complexes by creating specialized subunits with an elaborate
regulation. For example, two of the duplicate gene pairs predicted to have evolved by neofunctionalization are alternative
subunits of the same complex: EGD1 and BTT1 of the nascent
polypeptide-associated complex [17,36], and FKS1 and GSC2
of beta-1,3-glucan synthase. Similarly, the transcription factors GZF3 (conserved) and DAL80 (divergent) are two regulators of nitrogen metabolism that can homo- or heterodimerize [37], presumably leading to different activities.
These cases may provide examples where regulation of the
alternative subunits' expression determines the composition
of the complex at any cellular state, and thus dictates its condition-dependent function.

comment

This adaptation involved the generation of novel pathways,
most notably the repression of oxidative phosphorylation and
related processes in the presence of glucose, known as glucose
repression [33]. Indeed, of the duplicate pairs with asymmetric expression evolution at least two encode isoenzymes, and
in these pairs the genes encoding the predicted novel function
(HXK1 and PYK2) are under the control of the glucose repression pathway, while the genes encoding the predicted ancestral function (HXK2 and CDC19) are not repressed by glucose
[34,35]. Another pair of isoenzymes (APA1 and APA2), which
are ATP adenylyltransferases whose functional distinction is
unclear, shows a similar pattern of regulation. The enzyme
with the predicted novel function (APA2) is co-regulated with
the anaerobic genes (expression correlation r = 0.4875 for
HXK1 and r = 0.3966 for PYK2 in the S. cerevisiae dataset),
while the enzyme with the predicted ancestral function
(APA1) is co-regulated with the aerobic genes (expression
correlation r = 0.5220 for HXK2 and r = 0.2940 for CDC19 in
the S. cerevisiae dataset). This observation suggests that
APA2 is the anaerobic ATP adenylyltransferase while APA1 is
the aerobic one.

Variability of protein sequence and expression profiles
Variability of protein sequences (adjusted Ka/Ks) among four
yeast species from the Saccharomyces sensu-stricto complex
were taken from [17], transformed as in the original study
(f(k) = Log [k + 0.001]), and normalized by subtracting their
mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Variability of
expression profiles in response to environmental stresses
among four yeast species from the Saccharomyces sensustricto complex were taken from [18].

This procedure was repeated until convergence:

Finally, to validate the iterative heuristic, we calculated EC
scores when the initial weights were randomly selected:

EC 0 (i ) = PCCw( Ricer , Rican )
,g
,g
where wi = rand([0,1]).
This was repeated ten times; in each case the algorithm
described above was applied until convergence and the EC
scores were compared to those without randomization. In all
cases the results from the randomized procedure were similar
to those of the original procedure (PCC > 0.99), indicating
that the original results reflect a global minimum.

Application to duplicate gene pairs
After EC scores were computed for all ortholog gene pairs,
these scores were used as weights for a similar analysis of
duplicates. For each pair of duplicates from S. cerevisiae and
their orthologs from C. albicans, we calculated two EC scores
for comparison of each of the duplicates with their ortholog.

mRNA and protein abundance
mRNA abundance averaged over various studies was taken
from Beyer et al. [22], and protein abundance was taken from
Ghaemmaghami et al. [21]. These values were log2-tranformed, and then centered and normalized.

Multiple alignments of the duplicates and their single
orthologs from K. waltii and C. albicans were used to estimate protein sequence divergence using a parsimony-based
approach. Namely, each position with the same amino acid in
the K. waltii ortholog, the C. albicans ortholog and at least
one of the duplicates was assumed to represent the ancestral
state before duplication; if the second duplicate had a different amino acid at that position, then a substitution was
inferred. The number of substitutions inferred for each duplicate gene is used as an estimate of protein sequence divergence (Table 1).

Asymmetry of sequence and expression divergence
Asymmetry was defined as

x1 − x2
x1 + x2

, where x1 and x2 are meas-

ures of divergence of the duplicate gene pair. For sequence
divergence xi represented the number of amino acid substitutions and for expression divergence it was 1 - EC. For each
gene pair, x1 was chosen as the copy with lower expression
conservation, such that asymmetry of expression divergence
is always positive and the sign of asymmetry of sequence
divergence reflects the congruence between sequence and
expression analyses (negative asymmetry of sequence divergence means that the copy with lower expression conservation had higher sequence conservation). Note that this
measure is not equivalent to that used to detect extreme cases
of asymmetry where we demanded that one copy has EC >
0.372 and the other copy has EC < 0.

Ancestral reconstruction of expression correlations
Each gene in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans is represented in
our analysis by its expression correlation with a reference set
of one-to-one orthologs. Thus, for each pair of duplicates and
each reference gene, we performed ancestral reconstruction
to infer the correlation of the ancestral gene (before duplication) with the reference gene. Ancestral reconstruction is
done with a parsimony-based procedure [23], which uses the
correlation values in each of the duplicates and the C. albicans ortholog to infer the ancestral correlation that minimizes the total divergence of that value. The inferred
correlations with the entire reference set defines the ancestral
expression pattern that is then compared to the duplicate pair
and the C. albicans ortholog using the EC score defined
above.
