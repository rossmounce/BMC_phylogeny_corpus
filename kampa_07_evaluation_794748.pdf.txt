Abstract
Background: Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is an important pathogen in cattle. The ability
of the virus to cross the placenta during early pregnancy can result in the birth of persistently
infected (PI) calves. These calves shed the virus during their entire lifespan and are the key
transmitters of infection. Consequently, identification (and subsequent removal) of PI animals is
necessary to rapidly clear infected herds from the virus. The objective of this study was to evaluate
the suitability of a commercial Erns-capture ELISA, in comparison to the indirect immunoperoxidase
test (IPX), for routine diagnostic detection of BVDV within a control programme. In addition, the
effect of passive immunity and heat-inactivation of the samples on the performance of the ELISA
was studied.
Methods: In the process of virus clearance within the Swedish BVDV control programme, all
calves born in infected herds are tested for virus and antibodies. From such samples, sent in for
routine diagnostics to SVA, we selected 220 sera collected from 32 beef herds and 29 dairy herds.
All sera were tested for BVDV antigen using the Erns ELISA, and the results were compared to the
results from the IPX used within the routine diagnostics.
Results: All 130 samples categorized as virus negative by IPX were tested negative in the ELISA,
and all 90 samples categorized as virus positive were tested positive, i.e. the relative sensitivity and
specificity of the ELISA was 100% in relation to IPX, and the agreement between the tests was
perfect.
Conclusion: We can conclude that the Erns ELISA is a valid alternative that has several advantages
compared to IPX. Our results clearly demonstrate that it performs well under Swedish conditions,
and that its performance is comparable with the IPX test. It is highly sensitive and specific, can be
used for testing of heat-inactivated samples, precolostral testing, and probably to detect PI animals
at an earlier age than the IPX.

Background

Methods

Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is a widely spread cattle pathogen with a significant economic impact on cattle
production [1]. The virus interferes with reproductive and
immunological functions and causes subsequent losses
due to reproductive disorders and impaired herd performance [2,3]. Based on phylogenetic comparison, the virus
can be classified into two genotypes: BVDV-1 and BVDV2. Whereas BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, BVDV2 appears to be highly prevalent only in North America
[4,5] and relatively rare in other continents [6,7].

1. Selection of samples
1.1. Samples from the field
In the process of virus clearance within the Swedish BVDV
control programme, all calves born in infected herds are
tested for virus and antibodies at an age of 12 weeks, or
older. Blood samples are collected in sterile 5-ml vacutainer tubes and sent for analysis to the National Veterinary Institute (SVA), Uppsala, Sweden. From each herd
detected as infected, one virus positive sample is selected
for further analysis and genotyping of the infecting strain
[17]. So far, only BVDV-1 has been detected in Sweden.

The ability of the virus to cross the placenta during the first
trimester of pregnancy can result in the birth of immunotolerant and persistently infected (PI) calves. These PI
calves shed the virus during their entire lifespan and are
the key transmitters of virus in an infected herd [8] and
responsible for maintaining BVDV infections in cattle
populations [9]. Consequently, identification (and subsequent removal) of PI animals is necessary to rapidly clear
infected herds from the virus.
To identify PI animals, virus isolation on primary bovine
cells, followed by immuno-enzyme staining is regarded as
the "gold standard" method. The indirect immunoperoxidase (IPX) test is a standard method to detect BVDV in
several diagnostic laboratories and is used in the BVDV
control programme in Sweden [10]. During the course of
this programme, the IPX test has shown to be highly effective for identifying PI animals [11,12]. However, the IPX
test is time consuming and requires a high investment
both in personal training and laboratory equipment,
which is why antigen-capture ELISAs have been increasingly used since the early 1990's. The NS2/3-capture
ELISA detects BVDV in leukocytes and tissue samples
using specific affinity monoclonal antibodies (MAb)
against the NS2/3 protein, and has been successfully used
to identify PI animals in BVDV control programmes in
Norway and in the Shetland islands [13,14]. Recently, an
antigen ELISA that uses MAbs against the Erns glycoprotein
has been developed to detect BVDV. This structural protein is secreted from infected cells during virus replication
and can be detected directly in serum which allows user
friendly and high throughput testing and gives it the
potential to be a diagnostic antigen [15,16].
The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability
of a commercial Erns-capture ELISA (Erns ELISA; HerdCheck BVDV antigen/Serum Plus, IDEXX Scandinavia AB,
Österbybruk, Sweden.), in comparison to IPX, for routine
diagnostic detection of BVDV within a control programme. In addition, the effect of passive immunity and
heat-inactivation of the samples on the performance of
the ELISA was studied.

From samples sent in for routine diagnostics to SVA
between September 2002 and February 2003, we selected
220 sera collected from 32 beef herds and 29 dairy herds
throughout Sweden. According to the results from the IPX
used within the routine diagnostics [18] 90 of the sera
were considered virus positive and 130 virus negative. All
sera were kept at -20°C until analyzed by the Erns ELISA.
1.2. Samples from PI calves with or without passive immunity
To study the influence of passive immunity on the performance of the ELISA and IPX, we selected serum samples from nine PI calves born after a previously described
experimental infection of pregnant heifers [19]. In total,
we tested 23 samples collected between day 0 (i.e. immediately after birth and before intake of colostrum) and day
11 post partum (Table 1). Of the nine calves, five (calves
1–5) were given colostrum free from BVDV antibodies,
and four (calves 6–9) were given colostrum from their
respective antibody positive dams. Antibody titres were
determined in all sera using a commercial indirect ELISA
(BVDV-Ab SVANOVIR™, SVANOVA Biotech AB, Uppsala,
Sweden).
1.3. Heat inactivated sera
To study the influence of heat inactivation, we selected a
subset of 20 sera (10 virus positive and 10 virus negative)
out of the 220 samples previously selected from the routine diagnostics. Each sample was divided in two parts,
and one was heat inactivated at 56°C for 90 minutes
before further analysis. Heat inactivated and non-heated
sera were then tested in parallel with the Erns ELISA.
2. Diagnostic methods
2.1. Detection of BVDV by IPX
The 220 samples from the field and the 23 samples from
PI calves were also tested for BVDV by IPX. The test was
carried out on 96-well plates using low-passage bovine
turbinate cells. Serum (20 μl) was added to each of four
wells before the addition of 100 μl of cell suspension. Positive and negative control sera were run on each plate. The
test plates were incubated for 4 days in 5% CO2, 37°C.
Plates were fixed and dried, then stained with immu-

Calves 1–5 were given colostrum free from BVDV antibodies, and calves 6–9 were given colostrum from their respective antibody positive dams. Samples collected day 0 were taken before intake of colostrum.
BVDV antibody titres were determined using a commercial indirect ELISA (SVANOVA Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in dilutions 1:10–1:1250.
a Samples

with COD > 0.30 as measured by the Erns ELISA were considered positive

noperoxidase as described by Meyling [18], using a polyclonal bovine anti-BVDV serum (BVD virus positive
control serum, VLA, Weybridge, UK) to detect the virus.
The presence of red-brown cytoplasmic staining in any of
the wells exposed to the specific anti-BVDV antibody
denoted a positive result.
2.2. Detection of BVDV by antigen ELISA
All samples were tested for BVDV antigen using the Ernscapture ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, provided detection antibodies were added
to all wells of a microtitre plate wells coated with Erns
MAbs. Positive and negative control sera were added to
appropriate duplicate wells, and the serum samples (50
μl) then added to the remaining wells. The plate was incubated for 2 hours at 37°C, before washing and addition of
conjugate and substrate. The optical density values (ODs)
were measured at 450 nm, and the corrected optical densities (CODs) of samples and positive control then calculated by subtracting the mean OD for the negative
controls from obtained OD (COD = ODobtained - mean

ODnegative controls). Samples with COD> 0.30 were classified as positive.
2.3. Detection of antibodies
The antibody titres of the sera from the nine PI calves were
determined using the commercial indirect ELISA in dilutions 1:10 to 1:1250. The ELISA was performed according
to the instructions of the manufacturer. The COD values
from the indirect ELISA (CODAb) were calculated before
interpretation of the result by subtracting the OD for control antigen from obtained OD (CODAb = ODobtained ODcontrol). Antibody titres were determined as the highest
dilution with CODAb ≥ 0.2.
3. Statistical analysis
The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the Erns ELISA
were calculated in relation to the IPX test, and the degree
of agreement between the tests was estimated by the
kappa (k) ratio. To estimate the effect of heat inactivation
on the performance of the ELISA we evaluated the repeatability of the test before and after heat inactivation of the

and 1:1250, 5 samples were tested positive in the Erns
ELISA and none in the IPX.

Results

Heat inactivation
The agreement between results obtained before and after
heat inactivation can be seen in Figure 2. There was a perfect agreement of the interpretations of the test results
obtained before and after heat inactivation, and the CCC
was calculated to 0.99. The BA plot (not shown) indicated
that 95% of the differences between heat-inactivated and
non-heated samples fell in the range of -0.39 and +0.22
units.

Samples from the field
The results from the testing of the 220 sera, selected
among samples sent in to SVA, are summarized in Table
2. All 130 samples categorized as virus negative by IPX
were tested negative in the ELISA, and all 90 samples categorized as virus positive were tested positive, i.e. the relative Se and Sp of the ELISA was 100% in relation to IPX,
and the agreement between the tests was perfect (k = 1.0).
The frequency distribution of COD values can be seen in
Figure 1. Out of 90 samples considered as virus positive
according to the IPX test results, 89 had COD values well
above the cut-off (>1.2).
Samples from PI calves with or without passive immunity
The results of the testing of the 23 samples from PI calves
are given in Table 1. Out of 14 samples with antibody
ELISA titres < 1:10, 14 were tested positive in the Erns
ELISA and 11 in the IPX. The three samples that were
falsely classified as negative by the IPX were all collected
day 0 post partum, i.e. before intake of colostrum. Among
the 9 samples with antibody titres ranging between 1:10

Discussion
The identification of PI animals (for subsequent elimination) is an essential element in any BVDV control programme, and depends on accurate diagnostic tests, i.e.
tests with high sensitivity and specificity that have been
thoroughly evaluated for routine diagnostic use. Moreover, for testing of large series of samples it is desirable that
a test is user friendly and allows automation. Even though
the IPX test currently used in Sweden has shown to be efficient for detection of PI animals, it is evident that the Erns
ELISA have several advantages: it is independent of cell
cultures, gives a test result within a few hours and is relatively inexpensive both to establish and run [22]. In addi-

tion, our results clearly demonstrate that it performs well
under Swedish conditions, i.e. for detection of BVDV-1,
and that its performance is comparable with the IPX test.
There was a perfect agreement between the results from
the two tests, and the separation between COD values
from negative and positive samples was good. Out of 220
samples, 219 had COD values either well below or well
above the cut-off. However, one sample, considered as
virus positive according to the IPX test results, had a COD
value close to the cut-off, and there are a number of possible explanations for this result. Firstly, as with the major-

ity of BVDV antigen ELISAs, this Erns ELISA has been
developed for the identification of PI animals. Whereas
virus titres in PI animals normally range between 102.2
and 106 TCID50/ml, titres during transient infections have
been reported to be as low as 100.9 [23-25]. It is likely that
the detection level of the IPX test is lower than that of the
ELISA, and it is possible that this serum sample originated
from a transiently infected animal. Secondly, although PI
animals normally have high virus titres, these may, as previously mentioned, show a wide range. Consequently, it is
also possible that this serum sample originated from a PI

manuscript. All authors have read and given final
approval of the version to be published.

Because the Erns ELISA, unlike the IPX test used, is based
on MAbs and has been developed and validated for detection of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, it is probably not as broadly
reactive as the IPX. It has been shown not to detect some
closely related border disease virus strains [26], and may,
consequently, also miss atypical pestiviruses. This should
be kept in mind, as there are indications that atypical pestiviruses are already circulating in cattle populations[27,28].

Acknowledgements

It was demonstrated that both tests might fail to detect a
large proportion of PI calves in the presence of persisting
maternal antibodies, confirming results from previous
studies[29,30]. However, whereas the IPX test gave false
negative results also in the presence of low antibody titres,
the Erns ELISA detected BVDV in three out of four sera with
antibody titres up to 1:250, indicating that the Erns ELISA
is less influenced by passive immunity. We could also
observe that the IPX test, unlike the Erns ELISA, gave false
negative results in three out of five newborn PI calves sampled before intake of colostrum. This has been observed
previously and is hard to explain (Rønsholt, personal
communication), but is one of several reasons for which
precolostral sampling is not practiced within the Swedish
BVDV control programme.

In addition, it was demonstrated that the performance of
the Erns ELISA was not influenced by heat inactivation,
which can be an advantage in laboratories where sera are
often subject to several analyses and therefore heat-inactivated by routine.

Conclusion
Based on these results we can conclude that the Erns ELISA
is a valid alternative to the IPX test. It is highly sensitive
and specific, can be used for testing of heat-inactivated
samples, precolostral testing, and probably to detect PI
animals at an earlier age than the IPX. However, it should
be kept in mind that this ELISA, unlike the IPX, uses
MAbs, and that it therefore is less likely to detect atypical
pestivirus strains.
