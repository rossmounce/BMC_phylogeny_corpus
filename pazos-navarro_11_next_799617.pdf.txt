Abstract
Background: Bituminaria bituminosa is a perennial legume species from the Canary Islands and Mediterranean
region that has potential as a drought-tolerant pasture species and as a source of pharmaceutical compounds.
Three botanical varieties have previously been identified in this species: albomarginata, bituminosa and crassiuscula.
B. bituminosa can be considered a genomic ‘orphan’ species with very few genomic resources available. New DNA
sequencing technologies provide an opportunity to develop high quality molecular markers for such orphan
species.
Results: 432,306 mRNA molecules were sampled from a leaf transcriptome of a single B. bituminosa plant using
Roche 454 pyrosequencing, resulting in an average read length of 345 bp (149.1 Mbp in total). Sequences were
assembled into 3,838 isotigs/contigs representing putatively unique gene transcripts. Gene ontology descriptors
were identified for 3,419 sequences. Raw sequence reads containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were
identified, and 240 primer pairs flanking these motifs were designed. Of 87 primer pairs developed this way, 75
(86.2%) successfully amplified primarily single fragments by PCR. Fragment analysis using 20 primer pairs in 79
accessions of B. bituminosa detected 130 alleles at 21 SSR loci. Genetic diversity analyses confirmed that variation at
these SSR loci accurately reflected known taxonomic relationships in original collections of B. bituminosa and
provided additional evidence that a division of the botanical variety bituminosa into two according to geographical
origin (Mediterranean region and Canary Islands) may be appropriate. Evidence of cross-pollination was also found
between botanical varieties within a B. bituminosa breeding programme.
Conclusions: B. bituminosa can no longer be considered a genomic orphan species, having now a large (albeit
incomplete) repertoire of expressed gene sequences that can serve as a resource for future genetic studies. This
experimental approach was effective in developing codominant and polymorphic SSR markers for application in
diverse genetic studies. These markers have already given new insight into genetic variation in B. bituminosa,
providing evidence that a division of the botanical variety bituminosa may be appropriate. This approach is
commended to those seeking to develop useful markers for genomic orphan species.

Background
Bituminaria bituminosa (L.) C.H. Stirt., commonly
known as Tedera in the Canary Islands, is a perennial
legume species widely distributed in the Mediterranean
Basin and Macaronesia. It is a self-pollinated diploid
species (2n = 20) with DNA content estimated to be
between 0.998 and 1.094 pg DNA per diploid nucleus
[1-3]. B. bituminosa shows particularly high diversity in
the Canary Islands, with three recognised botanical varieties: (i) var. albomarginata: native to semi-arid habitats
in coastal areas of Lanzarote island and a few other
niches in Fuerteventura, Tenerife and Gran Canaria,
with an annual rainfall of 150 mm to 300 mm; (ii) var.
crassiuscula: native to high altitude sub-humid areas in
Tenerife island with up to 500 mm rainfall per year; and
(iii) var. bituminosa widely distributed in all islands
across varying altitudes and rainfall levels [4,5]. In the
Mediterranean basin, only var. bituminosa is found [6].
These botanical varieties were identified using morphological characteristics and were largely supported by preliminary molecular analyses using arbitrary DNA
markers [7,8]. However, Juan et al. [7] found that accessions of var. bituminosa from the Mediterranean region
formed a cluster distinct from a Canary Islands cluster
that contained all three botanic varieties. Therefore,
there is some ambiguity in botanical variety definitions
that warrants further investigation.
In recent years, there has been growing international
interest in B. bituminosa as a potential source of pharmaceutical compounds and also as a drought tolerant
pasture species. The plant contains secondary compounds such as pterocarpans with antitumor activity
against leukaemia and colon cancer [9-11], antioxidants
[12] and furanocoumarins such as psoralen and angelicin, which are used in the treatment of skin diseases
(psoriasis, vitiligo, melanoma) [13-15]. As a forage crop
it is well adapted to high temperature and low rainfall.
An important attribute of this species is that, unlike
lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), it has a high retention of
leaves when moisture stressed, therefore providing valuable feed over summer [16,17]. Traditionally, the profitability and sustainability of livestock industries in
southern Australia and in other regions with Mediterranean-like climates is severely constrained by the quantity and quality of forage available over summer and
autumn. Therefore, there is strong demand for breeding
drought-tolerant and productive forage legumes as well
as improved understanding of the genetic basis of key
agronomic traits.
Molecular markers contribute valuable support to
breeding programmes [18]. Markers provide the means
to characterise genetic diversity within breeding programmes and help identify new genetic diversity in the

wild or in germplasm collections. Markers are valuable
in determining or confirming pedigrees and for markerassisted selection of traits that are difficult and/or
expensive to measure. However, B. bituminosa can be
considered a true ‘genomic orphan’ [19] in that there
are almost no genomic resources or high-quality codominant markers available for genetic analysis. The few
genomic resources readily available for molecular marker development for B. bituminosa consist largely of
chloroplast gene sequences developed for phylogenetic
studies within the tribe Psoraleeae and more broadly
among phaseoloid legumes [20,21]. However, B. bituminosa has a rich cousin in the genomic resources sense:
soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) that belongs to the
neighbouring subtribe Glycininae [21]. The complete
genome sequence of soybean was recently determined
[22], which could act as a useful reference genome for
B. bituminosa. However, the taxonomic divide between
these species is sufficiently wide to make marker transfer between soybean and B. bituminosa rather inefficient. Fortunately, the advent of new high-throughput
genome sequencing technologies provides a relatively
low cost opportunity for rapid development of locusspecific markers for a species like B. bituminosa that has
little available genomic resources.
This study reports the generation of a cDNA library
developed from leaf mRNA from a single B. bituminosa
plant and sampling of the leaf transcriptome using 454
GS-FLX pyrosequencing technology. Simple sequence
repeat (SSR) motifs were identified, primers designed
and a subset of these markers were used to characterise
a broad set of B. bituminosa accessions to assist in the
correct choice of parents in breeding programmes, and
which could be used to provide guidance in managing
and conserving germplasm collections. These SSR markers along with the first catalogue of expressed genes
provide valuable resources for B. bituminosa genetic
analysis and breeding.

Results
Sampling the B. bituminosa leaf transcriptome by Roche
454 sequencing

Sequencing of the B. bituminosa leaf-derived cDNA
library on the GS-FLX System resulted in 432,306
sequence reads with an average length of 345 bp (149.1
Mbp). These sequence reads were deposited at the
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database at NCBI [GenBank:SRA037309]. GS De Novo Assembler software
assembled 266,461 (61.6%) of the reads into 4,542 contigs that were ≥ 100 bp in length. It then grouped contigs into 2,929 “isogroups” (analogous to genes) and
3,798 “isotigs” (analogous to transcripts) with an average
isotig length of 707 base pairs. 3657 isotigs and

bp in length were deposited at NCBI Transcriptome

Functional characterisation of expressed gene sequences

3,838 isotigs and remaining singleton contig sequences ≥
100 bp were subjected to in silico functional characterisation using Blast2GO software. Gene ontology (GO)
terms were identified for 3,419 sequences (89.1%; Additional file 1). Figure 1 provides a summary of the main
GO terms defined according to the cellular component,
biological process and molecular function associated
with these 3,419 sequences. The species that received
the greatest proportion of BLAST hits was Glycine max
(3,013 hits, or 88.1%), and G. max was also the species
that was most frequently the top hit (for 1,454
sequences; 42.5%). The other main model legume species only rarely provided the most significant matches:
Medicago truncatula was the top hit for 185 sequences
(5.4%) and Lotus japonicus was the top hit for 14
sequences (0.4%). Together, these results indicate that
G. max will serve as the most representative reference
genome for B. bituminosa.

Biological process

SSR primer design and testing

With the aid of QDD software, primer pairs for 186
‘perfect’ SSRs and 54 ‘compound’ SSRs were designed
(Additional file 2). Of these, 49 primer pairs for perfect
SSRs and 38 primers pairs for compound SSRs were
selected in descending order of SSR motif length along
with a further 7 primer pairs were designed manually
with the aid of Geneious software using contigs containing SSR motifs (Additional file 3). In total, 94 primer
pairs were synthesised and screened for amplification
efficiency using genomic DNA from B. bituminosa plant
A13.1 as template. Without any specific optimisation, 82
out of 94 primer pairs (87.2%) amplified one or more
bands (visualised on low-resolution 1% agarose gels),
with one band being more common (78 primer pairs,
83.0%) than ≥ 2 bands (4 primer pairs, 4.3%) (Additional
file 3).
The 82 primer pairs that gave amplification products
were screened for gross-level polymorphism in eight
diverse B. bituminosa accessions (one plant per accession) by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels. Of the
82 primer pairs tested in this way, 21 showed clear band
size polymorphism and were selected for synthesis of
fluorescently labelled forward primers (Table 1). These
21 fluorescently labelled primer pairs were used to genotype 79 B. bituminosa accessions (one plant per accession). These accessions were classed as ‘original
populations’ (collected from wild or from traditional
pasture lands; n = 27) or ‘breeding lines’ (having

strength and was consequently omitted from subsequent
analysis. Of the 20 high-quality SSR primer pairs, 19
appeared to detect single loci (1 to 2 alleles per primer
pair) while one primer pair appeared to detect two loci
(2 to 4 alleles for primer pair ‘Bbit-SSR079’). In total,
130 alleles were detected at 21 high-quality marker loci,
an average of 6.19 alleles per locus indicating that these
markers were generally highly polymorphic. The 19 single locus SSR markers detected between 3 to 11 alleles
per marker, with polymorphic index content (PIC)
values ranging from 0.13 to 0.76 (average = 0.407)
(Additional file 4).
Validating SSR markers by genetic diversity analysis in 27
original populations

To determine if the SSR markers were suitable for
inferring genetic relationships among breeding lines, a
pairwise Euclidean distance matrix for 27 accessions
collected from the wild or from traditional pasturelands (termed ‘original populations’; Table 2) was analysed by hierarchical clustering and MDS analysis (Figure 2). In both analyses, accessions grouped together
according to botanical variety indicating that allelic
variation at these markers reflected well-established
botanical varieties. Interestingly, var. bituminosa accessions were sub-divided into two clear groups according

to geographical origin (Canary Islands and Mediterranean region). Cluster analysis revealed that some
accessions were genetically so similar that they could
not be distinguished using allele information at 21 SSR
loci (Figure 2a). Heterozygosity of the original populations ranged from 0-62% (mean = 16.4%; Table 2). An
analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) confirmed
that there was significant differentiation between populations accounting for 35% of the total allelic variance
observed (Table 3).
Using markers to characterise B. bituminosa breeding
lines

Having established that the usefulness of the new SSR
markers, genotype information from an additional 52 B.
bituminosa breeding lines was subjected to pairwise distance analysis, along with plants from the 27 original
populations (Additional file 5). This distance matrix was
analysed by MDS and hierarchical clustering techniques
(Figure 3 and Additional file 6). Adding these lines to
the analyses resulted in an increased complexity of
inter-relationships as evidenced by an increase in the
two-dimensional MDS stress from 0.16 (27 original
populations) to 0.23 (all 79 accessions). However, a similar pattern of groupings among the original populations
was observed (compare Figure 2b and Figure 3).

The term ‘breeding line’ indicates that the accession has been grown for one or more generation in breeding nurseries with possible cross-pollination among
accessions. The term ‘original population’ indicates that seed was collected directly from geographical location indicated with no opportunity for cross-pollination
among these accessions.

Heterozygosity was assessed at 21 simple sequence repeat loci.

Figure 3a-3d shows the placement of breeding lines of
three botanical varieties from the Canary Islands and
Mediterranean region relative to the original populations. In general, breeding lines described as var. albomarginata and var. bituminosa (from the Canary
Islands) were placed within or near their respective clusters of original populations with one notable exception:
breeding line S41c (Figure 3b) was described as Canary
Island bituminosa but had much greater affinity to Mediterranean bituminosa according to SSR marker genotyping. Breeding lines described as Mediterranean
bituminosa and var. crassiuscula had very wide distribution in the MDS plots (Figure 3c and 3d). The average

heterozygosity of breeding lines was substantially higher
(32.0%) than for original populations (16.4%), and had a
greater range of values (0-95%; Table 2).

Discussion
New high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies
offer many research opportunities for both model and
crop species alike [15]. Arguably, minor grain and pasture crop species (also known as “orphan” crop species
[19]) stand to gain the most since they are starting from
a very low baseline of genomic resources. This paper

Three populations were defined as var. albomarginata (n = 9), var. bituminosa
from the Canary Islands (n = 9) and var. bituminosa from the Mediterranean
region (n = 8). Botanical variety crassiuscula was not included because there
was only one accession used in this study.

sampling of the leaf transcriptome derived from a single
plant of B. bituminosa by Roche 454 pyrosequencing.
This method was highly effective with 75 out of 87
(86.2%) automatically designed primer pairs successfully
amplifying PCR products (Additional file 3). Of the 21
markers selected for high- resolution fragment analysis
in plants from 79 B. bituminosa accessions, 20 gave consistently strong amplification products and were highly
polymorphic (6.19 alleles per marker locus). The methods presented in this study could be used by researchers
for other genomic orphan species for rapid development
of high-quality codominant markers, although the extent
of marker polymorphism will vary between species and
between populations within species.
The usefulness of the SSR markers was demonstrated
by a clear delineation of groups according to botanical
variety and geographical location in plants sampled
from 27 original populations. These markers advanced
our understanding of genetic diversity in B. bituminosa
in that we could clearly distinguish var. bituminosa
types according to their geographical origin (Canary
Islands and the Mediterranean region; Figure 2). This
differentiation was of similar magnitude to that which
distinguished botanical varieties and extends the observation by Juan et al. [4] who found that Mediterranean
var. bituminosa formed its own grouping while all botanical varieties from the Canary Islands formed another
group. Therefore, there is a prima facie case for dividing
var. bituminosa into two botanical varieties according to
geographic origin (Canary Island or Mediterranean
region), each distinct from var. albomarginata and var.
crassiuscula. There are some differences in trait characteristics that support this division. For example, Mediterranean var. bituminosa are usually biennial whereas
Canary Island var. bituminosa are perennial.
These SSR markers provided some useful insights into
B. bituminosa breeding lines. Historically, the B. bituminosa breeding programme has practiced uncontrolled
open pollination. While most pollination in B. bituminosa is considered to be by self-pollination, a certain
proportion of out-crossing does occur [21] but until

now there has been little direct evidence to support this
assumption. In this study, two lines of evidence were
found to support the occurrence of out-crossing in the
B. bituminosa breeding programme. First, the average
level of heterozygosity increased approximately two-fold
in breeding lines (32.0%) versus original populations
(16.4%) (Table 2). Second, cross-pollination between B.
bituminosa plants from different botanical varieties and
geographical locations is the most likely explanation of
the wider distribution of breeding lines compared to original populations in MDS plots (Figure 3). Interestingly,
this increased distribution was most pronounced in
Mediterranean var. bituminosa. This may in part be
explained by breeder observations in Murcia (Spain)
that populations of var. bituminosa presented a higher
percentage of fruit set compared to populations of var.
albomarginata, which was taken to be indirect evidence
of higher cross-pollination frequencies in var. bituminosa [22]. The same observation was made for var. crassiuscula, though analysis of additional accessions is
necessary to confirm this preliminary conclusion.
An advantage of using the transcriptome sequencing
approach compared to more conventional genomic SSR
approaches is that markers should be more transferable
across species since they are based on gene sequences
that are relatively well conserved in evolution compared
to non-genic regions [23]. For example, these genic markers may prove useful in other Psoraleeae species that
remain genomic orphans, such as Cullen australasicum,
an Australian native perennial legume species that
shows promise as a drought-tolerant pasture species
[24].
In addition to generating useful SSR markers, this
study provides a repertoire of many thousands of
expressed gene sequences for potential follow-up experiments. Gene ontology analysis using Blast2GO was
highly effective in identifying putative cellular location,
biological process and molecular function in 3,419 out
of 3,838 (89.1%) assembled mRNA sequences. Examples
of follow-up experiments may include investigating
genes associated with flowering time regulation (e.g.
CONSTANS-like a [23]; isotig02726, Additional file 1) or
furanocoumarin biosynthesis genes (e.g. cytochrome
p450 monooxygenases [24,25]; e.g. isotig00288, Additional file 1). The species showing closest homology to
B. bituminosa in 3,013 out of 3,419 (88.1%) mRNA
sequences with significant hits was G.max, indicating
that G. max will serve as a useful reference genome for
future gene discovery and characterisation in B.
bituminosa.

Conclusions
This paper describes an efficient method for developing
valuable SSR markers for B. bituminosa, a species that

B. bituminosa, providing evidence that a division of the
botanical variety bituminosa may be appropriate.

biochemical pathways and/or important agronomic
traits.

Methods
Selection of a B. bituminosa accession for transcriptome
sequencing

In June 2008, one plant from each of 22 accessions was
analyzed for psoralen and angelicin content (Ewald
Sweeny, Chem Centre, Western Australia; unpublished
data). The plant A13.1 (from accession A13) had the
highest total content of furanocoumarins (highest in
angelicin and third highest in psoralen) out of the 22
plants evaluated. This accession is from an original
population collected from the Teno region of the Canary Islands. Plant A13.1 was cloned by propagating cuttings which were then kept at the Department of
Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA) in a
naturally lit glasshouse at a constant temperature of 25°
C. One such clone was used for transcriptome sampling.
mRNA extraction and cDNA preparation

Young leaves were harvested from A13.1 and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Leaves were ground to a
fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
and mRNA isolated using Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen).
mRNA was purified using RNeasy Minelute kit (Qiagen)
and quality checked at the Australian Genome Research
Facility (AGRF; Brisbane, Australia) using an RNA6000
Pico chip (Agilent) run on a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent).
A cDNA library was constructed by AGRF following the
standard Roche Diagnostics protocol ("cDNA Rapid
Library Preparation Method Manual-GS FLX Titanium
Series”, October 2009 (Rev. Jan 2010)).
Sampling the B. bituminosa transcriptome by Roche 454
sequencing

Sequencing of the cDNA library was carried out at
AGRF using the GS-FLX System (Roche Diagnostics)
with Titanium sequencing chemistry on one half of a
two-region gasket PicoTitre Plate; for full details, consult the Roche Diagnostics “Sequencing Method Manual-GS FLX Titanium Series”, October 2009 (Rev. Jan
2010). The GS De Novo Assembler software (Roche
Diagnostics) was used to assemble the sequencing output into contigs, using default parameters.
De novo assembly of B. bituminosa leaf transcriptome

The GS De Novo Assembler (version 2.3, Roche Diagnostics) software programs “newAssembly” (with “cdna”
parameter) and “runProject” were used to align and
assemble the sequencing output from Standard Flowgram Format into contigs and isotigs, using default
parameters as described by the manufacturer.

Page 11 of 13

Functional Analysis

Gene ontology (GO) classification was conducted with
the aid of Blast2GO software [26] using GenBank database version 173. Isotig and remaining singleton contigs
> 100 bp were included in the analysis. Matches with
significance values < 1e-6 were allocated to three GO
categories (Biological Process, Molecular Function, and
Cellular Component) in 1 to 11 levels of hierarchical
structure. For ease of visualisation, results are presented
at levels 2 or 3 (Figure 1).
SSR detection and primer design

The raw GS-FLX sequencing output in FASTA format
was submitted as input to the QDD program [27] for
detection of SSR markers and primer design. The QDD
program was run from the command line on a Linux
system using the default parameters as described in the
QDD user manual. For comparison, a manual search for
repeat motifs among the isotig/contig sequences was
performed and primers flanking a subset of repeats were
designed with the aid of Geneious 5.3 (Biomatters Ltd).
SSR marker amplification and fragment analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from 50 B. bituminosa
accessions provided by the Future Farm Industries
Cooperative Research Centre (FFI CRC) at the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (South
Perth, Australia) and 29 B. bituminosa accessions provided by the Spanish Breeding programme at Instituto
Murciano de Investigación y Desarrollo Agrario y Alimentario (Murcia, Spain) (Table 2), using Illustra
Nucleon Phytopure Genomic DNA Extraction Kits (GE
Healthcare). PCR reactions were carried out in a MasterCycler programmable thermal cycler (Eppendorf) in
20 uL volumes containing the following components:
2.5 ng/uL genomic DNA, 1x PCR buffer (comprising 50
mM KCl, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 9.0) and 0.1% TritonX), 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.04 U/uL Taq DNA
polymerase and 0.2 μM each of forward and reverse primers. Amplification conditions consisted of denaturation
at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 45 sec, primer annealing at 55°C for 45 sec
and extension at 72°C for 90 sec, followed by a final
extension step of 72°C for 7 min.
Initial screening of 96 SSR primer pairs for amplification efficiency was carried out using genomic DNA
from plant A13.1 that had been used for transcriptome sequencing. Primer pairs that successfully amplified fragments in A13.1 (assessed using conventional
TBE agarose electrophoresis) were then used to screen
eight diverse B. bituminosa accessions (individual
plants: A13.1, A27.2, A37.2, A42.3, A43.2, A48.2,
A51.2 and S2b) for polymorphism. For those markers
identified as polymorphic on 2% TBE agarose gels,

Pazos-Navarro et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:104

fluorescently-labelled forward primers were synthesised and used to amplify fluorescently labelled amplicons in 79 lines. Fragment size analysis was performed
relative to a Genescan LIZ500 internal size standard
(Applied Biosystems) using an AB3730xl capillary
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the resulting electropherograms analysed using GeneMarker
software (SoftGenetics) as described in detail by Nelson et al. [28]. Each marker allele was recorded as
estimated base pair length. For genetic distance estimates, alleles were scored as present (1), absent (0) or
unknown (999).
Genetic diversity analyses

Pairwise Euclidean distances among 79 B. bituminosa
accessions (Table 2) were calculated using NTSYSpc
2.21i (Applied Biostatistics Inc.). Pairwise distances were
subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using group
averages and multidimensional scaling (MDS) using
Kruskal fit scheme 1 with 100 restarts in Primer 6.1.6
software (Primer-E Ltd). Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA) of variation within and among original populations (n = 26, excluding var. crassiuscula as there was
only one accession represented) and allele frequencies
(n = 27) were calculated using GenAlEx 6.4 [29]. Polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated
using the formula described by Pradhan et al. [30].
