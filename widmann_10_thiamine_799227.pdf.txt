The Thiamine diphosphate dependent Enzyme
Engineering Database: A tool for the systematic
analysis of sequence and structure relations
Michael Widmann, Robert Radloff, Jürgen Pleiss*

Abstract
Background: Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes form a vast and diverse class of proteins,
catalyzing a wide variety of enzymatic reactions including the formation or cleavage of carbon-sulfur, carbonoxygen, carbon-nitrogen, and especially carbon-carbon bonds. Although very diverse in sequence and domain
organisation, they share two common protein domains, the pyrophosphate (PP) and the pyrimidine (PYR) domain.
For the comprehensive and systematic comparison of protein sequences and structures the Thiamine diphosphate
(ThDP)-dependent Enzyme Engineering Database (TEED) was established.
Description: The TEED http://www.teed.uni-stuttgart.de contains 12048 sequence entries which were assigned to
9443 different proteins and 379 structure entries. Proteins were assigned to 8 different superfamilies and 63
homologous protein families. For each family, the TEED offers multisequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and
family-specific HMM profiles. The conserved pyrophosphate (PP) and pyrimidine (PYR) domains have been
annotated, which allows the analysis of sequence similarities for a broad variety of proteins. Human ThDPdependent enzymes are known to be involved in many diseases. 20 different proteins and over 40 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of human ThDP-dependent enzymes were identified in the TEED.
Conclusions: The online accessible version of the TEED has been designed to serve as a navigation and analysis
tool for the large and diverse family of ThDP-dependent enzymes.

Background
Since the discovery of the first thiamine diphosphate
(ThDP)-dependent enzyme in 1937, a multitude of them
has been described and their catalytic mechanism was
intensively analysed [1-3]. ThDP-dependent enzymes
catalyze a wide variety of enzymatic reactions and therefore were assigned to the families of oxidoreductases,
transferases, or lyases [4]. The formation or cleavage of
carbon-sulfur, carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen, and
especially carbon-carbon bonds are of utmost interest
for bioorganic synthesis and organocatalysis [5,6].
Because of their ability to form asymmetric C-C bonds,
ThDP-dependent enzymes are versatile catalysts for a
variety of biotransformations [7-12]. In addition, the
ThDP-dependent enzyme family has been shown to possess a wide substrate spectrum ranging from small

compounds like formaldehyde to bulky hydroxyl-phytanoyl-CoA molecules [13,14]. For pharmacology, ThDPdependent enzymes of human origin are of special interest. They have been identified as being involved in a
variety of diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes
[15], and also play a role in tumor proliferation [16].
Their highly diverse substrate specificity and catalytic
activity is reflected in their sequence and structure
which differs significantly between different families of
ThDP-dependent enzymes. During the course of evolution, shuffling, rearrangement, and fusion of domains, as
well as mutation, and gene duplications have led to the
enormous diversity of ThDP-dependent enzymes
[17,18]. However, all ThDP-dependent enzymes contain
at least two conserved domains, the pyrophosphate (PP)
and the pyrimidine (PYR) domain, which have a similar
structure [18] and are essential for binding and activating ThDP [19]. The PYR domain has a conserved catalytic glutamic acid while the PP domain contains a

conserved GDX25-30N motif [17,20-22]. In addition to
these two domains, additional domains were found such
as the the transhydrogenase dIII domain (TH3) and the
transketolase C-terminal domain (TKC) [17,18,23].
These additional domains are often not well characterised and in many cases their function in the catalytic
process remains obscure [17]. A unified classification
scheme for ThDP-dependent enzymes based on a comprehensive analysis of sequence and structure does not
yet exist. Based on a structural comparison, it was suggested that a total of 4 families should be sufficient to
describe ThDP-dependent enzymes: DC (decarboxylases), TK (transketolases), OR (oxidoreductases), and
KD (2-ketoacid dehydrogenase) [18]. A sequence based
evolutionary analysis suggested at least 6 different
families, namely TK (transketolases)-like, PFRD (pyruvate ferredoxin reductase), 2OXO (2-oxoisovalerate
dehydrogenase)-like, PDC (pyruvate decarboxylase)-like,
SPDC (sulfopyruvate decarboxylase), and PPDC (phosphopyruvate decarboxylase) [17].
We established the Thiamine diphosphate dependent
Enzyme Engineering Database (TEED) as a tool for a
comprehensive and systematic comparison of ThDPdependent enzymes from different protein families and
annotated the conserved PP- and PYR domains. Thus,
the TEED is the first data resource of ThDP-dependent
enzymes which combines information on the individual
protein families, sequence alignments and a consistent
annotation of the conserved PYR and PP domains.

Construction and content
Source Data

The Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent Enzyme
Engineering Database (TEED) was established by utilising the data warehouse system DWARF [24]. The
DWARF system is a collection of tools for the automated retrieval and integration of protein sequences and
structures from different source databases and their subsequent integration into a local data warehouse system.
The initial step in the construction of the database consisted of the selection of seed sequences of 62 proteins
which represent members of the different ThDP-dependent protein families (Table A1, Additional file 1). Seed
sequences were selected based on the enzymatic activity
of the protein and the structural arrangement of protein
domains. This selection was based on previous work
[17,18] which divided the members of the ThDP-dependent enzymes in different protein families.
Database establishment

The combination of previous classification schemes
resulted in 8 different superfamilies, DC (decarboxylase),
TK (transketolase), OR (oxidoreductase), and two subfamilies K1 and K2 of the KD (2-ketoacid dehydrogenase)

family. In addition to these families, the SPDC (sulfopyruvate decarboxylase), the PPDC (phosphopyruvate decarboxylase), and the KDH (a-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase) family were included (Figure 1). To
populate the TEED, a BLAST search against the
sequence database at NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
was carried out for each seed sequence with an E-value
cut off of 10-5. New protein entries were assigned to a
homologous protein family based on their sequence
similarity to one of the seed sequences. If the sequence
similarity was less than 60%, a protein was assigned to a
new homologous family. The families were subsequently
manually evaluated and adjusted: protein fragments
were merged into the respective homologous family, and
proteins with high sequence similarity but a different
domain organization were separated into different protein families. This resulted in 63 different homologous
families.
Sequence entries with more than 98% sequence identity which shared the same source organism were
assigned to the same protein entry. If more than one
sequence was assigned to the same protein, the longest
sequence was set as the reference sequence. If structural
information was available for protein entries, structural
monomers were downloaded from the Protein Data
Bank [25] and stored as structure entries. Secondary
structure information was calculated by DSSP [26] and
displayed in the annotated multisequence alignments
which were generated by ClustalW (v1.83) with default
parameters [27]. Additional annotation on structurally
or functionally relevant residues (active site, disulfide
bridges, signal peptide) were extracted from the NCBI
entry and the respective residues were annotated in the
TEED. Abbreviations for the established protein families
are available in tabular form (Table A1, Additional file
1).
Features and functionalities

The online version of the TEED offers pre-calculated
multisequence alignments and can be browsed by
families, organisms, or structures. Phylogenetic trees are
visualized by the program PHYLODENDRON [28]. The
PP and PYR domain of each ThDP-dependent protein
family was manually annotated. If structural information
for a protein homologous family was available, a structural alignment of the available structures was performed using STAMP [29].
If no structure information was available, a set of
sequences from the respective homologous protein family
was selected and used to create a multisequence alignment. A reliable alignment was ensured by performing
this analysis for each homologous family separately to
ensure a high degree of sequence similarity. This set consisted of full length sequences from different organisms,

excluding protein fragments. The information on the
domain boundaries for these sequences was retrieved from
InterProScan [30]. Since in many cases, information on the
exact N- and C- terminal boundaries for each domain was
inconsistent, the boundaries were preferably assigned in
well conserved regions rather than in more variable
regions. For each multisequence alignment, a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) was created using HMMER [31].
For each homologous family, the individual HMM was
used to perform alignments of every protein sequence of
this family against the annotated multisequence alignment.
Based on this alignment, the PP and PYR domain annotations from the annotated sequences were transferred to
every sequence (Figure 2). Annotation information of the
PP and PYR domains is displayed for each pre-calculated
alignment of homologous families or superfamilies and
allows the systematic analysis and evaluation of properties
and relationships of these domains. The TEED consists of
12048 sequence entries which were assigned to 9443 different proteins and 379 structure entries. The largest
superfamily is the DC family. It consists of more than
4000 sequence entries and accounts for 35% of all
sequence entries. The TK and OR families are of

comparable size (2600 and 2257 sequence entries, respectively) and account for 21% and 19%, respectively. The
source organism of the majority of ThDP-dependent
enzymes in the TEED are bacteria (87%).
Human ThDP-dependent enzymes

66 sequence entries from the TEED are of human origin
(excluding sequences from crystal structure chains). Due
to their medical importance they were systematically
analysed. All human ThDP-dependent enzymes belong
to only three superfamilies, the DC, TK, and K2 superfamily (Table A2, Additional file 2). The 66 sequences
belong to 20 different proteins with several isoforms.
The transketolase (gi: 205277463) with most isoforms
(12) is implicated in the latent genetic disease Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome [32] and has been found to
be differentially expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex from patients with schizophrenia. Another
human ThDP-dependent enzyme with many isoforms
(7) is the 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit alpha
(gi: 548403), also known as branched-chain alpha-keto
acid dehydrogenase. This protein is involved in the catabolism of amino acids like isoleucine, leucine, and

valine, and a defect causes the accumulation of these
amino acids which leads to the maple syrup urine disease [33]. One third of all sequence entries was labelled
as ‘putative’ or ‘unnamed’ in the GenBank, and was
assigned to a specific protein or protein family based on
sequence similarity (Table A2, Additional file 2). However, because the function and substrate specificity can
vary considerably even between homologous proteins,
the assignment of a biochemical property based on
sequence similarity only should be regarded as putative.
All sequence entries were compared to the respective
full sequence and were subsequently classified as either
fragments or SNPs. Fragments consist of parts of the
full sequence but show no exchange of amino acids
while SNPs always show an exchange of amino acids
(Table A2, Additional file 2).

Utility and discussion
The analysis of the human ThDP-dependent enzymes led
to a reliable classification of several, previously unclassified proteins and demonstrates the advantage of a highly
enriched database of a specific protein family. SNPs have
been shown to play an important role in tumor development [34,35] therefore a complete analysis for SNPs was
included in the analysis of human ThDP-dependent
enzymes. This analysis of SNPs is limited to sequences
retrieved from GenBank [36] and thus complements specialised SNP repositories such as the dbSNP [37]. Our
analysis demonstrates that GenBank annotations are
often incomplete and unreliable for the identification of
proteins or protein variants. The transketolase (gi:
205277463) includes 12 different isoforms, of which 6
have been designated as protein fragments. Of these, only
one sequence (gi: 193787540) shows an internal deletion,
suggesting a truly altered protein product. The other 5
isoforms only show truncated N-termini and therefore
could be sequencing artefacts of the original protein.
This kind of analysis is not limited to proteins from a
specific organism but can be expanded to cover protein
superfamilies or specific homologous families. It has
been shown previously that a systematic classification of
protein families can be used as a reliable framework for
systematic analyses of protein families [38,39] and for
the engineering of protein mutants with improved biochemical properties [40,41]. With the implemented
domain annotation, an analysis is not limited to the
whole protein sequence but protein families can also be
specifically analyzed for differences and conserved features in the PP and PYR domains.
Web accessibility

The database can be accessed on the level of sequence,
structure, or organism. All protein entries link to the
respective NCBI entries. Annotated multiple sequence

alignments and phylogenetic trees are provided via the
online accessible version of the TEED at http://www.
teed.uni-stuttgart.de. For each family, the level of amino
acid conservation is calculated by PLOTCON [42].
BLAST searches [43] can be performed against the
TEED using a local BLAST interface. Updates for the
TEED will be performed regularly using an automated
scripting system. For new sequence entries referring to a
new structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), structure
information is updated as well. New sequence and structure entries are assigned to existing homologous families
and superfamilies based on their sequence similarity.

Conclusions
The Thiamine diphosphate dependent Enzyme Engineering Database (TEED) has been designed to serve as
a navigation and analysis tool for the large and diverse
family of ThDP-dependent enzymes. The annotation of
the conserved pyrophosphate (PP) and pyrimidine (PYR)
domains allows for a direct comparison and analysis of
these domains between different families. Thus the
TEED is a valuable tool for the study of the protein
families of ThDP-dependent enzymes.
