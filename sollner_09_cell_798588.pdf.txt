<p>A network of Zebrafish extracellular neuroreceptor interactions are revealed using AVEXIS, a highly stringent interaction assay.</p>
An extracellular neuroreceptor interaction network

Abstract
Background: The vast number of precise intercellular connections within vertebrate nervous
systems is only partly explained by the comparatively few known extracellular guidance cues. Large
families of neural orphan receptor proteins have been identified and are likely to contribute to
these recognition processes but due to the technical difficulty in identifying novel extracellular
interactions of membrane-embedded proteins, their ligands remain unknown.
Results: To identify novel neural recognition signals, we performed a large systematic protein
interaction screen using an assay capable of detecting low affinity extracellular protein interactions
between the ectodomains of 150 zebrafish receptor proteins containing leucine-rich-repeat and/or
immunoglobulin superfamily domains. We screened 7,592 interactions to construct a network of
34 cell surface receptor-ligand pairs that included orphan receptor subfamilies such as the Lrrtms,
Lrrns and Elfns but also novel ligands for known receptors such as Robos and Unc5b. A quantitative
biochemical analysis of a subnetwork involving the Unc5b and three Flrt receptors revealed a
surprising quantitative variation in receptor binding strengths. Paired spatiotemporal gene
expression patterns revealed dynamic neural receptor recognition maps within the developing
nervous system, providing biological support for the network and revealing likely functions.
Conclusions: This integrated interaction and expression network provides a rich source of novel
neural recognition pathways and highlights the importance of quantitative systematic extracellular
protein interaction screens to mechanistically explain neural wiring patterns.

Background

Identifying the vast number of precise intercellular connections that ultimately account for higher cognitive functions in
vertebrate nervous systems, and explaining how they
develop, remains one of the main challenges facing neuroscience [1]. Receptor proteins displayed on the surface of neurons are known to relay extracellular recognition events to

elicit appropriate cellular responses such as axon guidance,
neuron migration and synapse formation, but in comparison
to the complex cellular networks that they regulate, relatively
few extracellular recognition receptor interactions have been
identified [2,3]. Comparative genome analysis and largescale gene expression studies, however, reveal that vertebrates contain large families of neurally expressed receptor

proteins that are expanded relative to invertebrates [4]. These
genes are likely to account for the increased complexity of
vertebrate nervous systems and two major families are the
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and extracellular immunoglobulin
superfamily (IgSF). The neuronal roles of some proteins containing IgSF domains have been well documented (see [5] for
a review) but the functions of LRR family members are less
well characterized.
The cell surface LRR proteins cluster phylogenetically into
separate subfamilies with characteristic domain structures
(Figure 1a) [6,7]. Even within subfamilies, these genes have
discrete and dynamic expression patterns in the developing
vertebrate brain and functional analysis also suggests that
they have roles in neurodevelopment. For example, genes
from the Lrrn subfamily have roles in long-term memory formation [8] and retinal development [9]. Over-expression
and/or knockdown of representative members of other subfamilies in neuronal cultures have been shown to have effects
on axon outgrowth [10-13], synapse formation [14-16] and
axon fasciculation [17]. Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) and LINGO1, both members of LRR subfamilies, together with either
neurotrophin receptor p75 or TROY, form a receptor complex
for myelin components and are responsible for the inhibition
of axon regeneration in lesioned mammalian central nervous
systems [18]. In addition, genes encoding several LRR proteins have been implicated in neurological disorders, including LRRTM1 in schizophrenia [19], LRRTM3 in Alzheimer's
disease [20], SLITRK1 in Tourette's syndrome [21] and LGI1
in epilepsy [22].
Despite this involvement in neurological diseases, very little
is known about their function and especially their extracellular binding partners. Indeed, of the approximately 20 paralogous subfamilies of membrane-tethered vertebrate LRRdomain-containing receptors [7], extracellular binding partners have been identified for just five: the Lingo, Lrrc4, Flrt,
Amigo and NgR subfamilies. One explanation for this disparity is that membrane-embedded receptor proteins are experimentally intractable: they are generally of low abundance
and their amphipathic nature makes them difficult to solubilise since they usually contain both large hydrophilic glycans
and at least one hydrophobic transmembrane region. Interactions between receptor proteins are also characterised by
extremely low interaction strengths, often having half-lives of
fractions of a second when measured in their monomeric
state [23]. The fleeting nature of these interactions is necessary to permit facile independent motility of migrating cells
or growth cones when many receptor proteins arrayed on
apposing cell membranes interact. These properties, however, make identifying novel extracellular recognition events
mediated through cell surface proteins technically challenging.
The aim of this study was to identify novel receptor interactions that are involved in neural cellular recognition events,

focussing in particular on the LRR and also IgSF receptor
families. Furthermore, by identifying when and where each
gene of an interacting pair is expressed during neural development, we could construct dynamic maps of the neural
intercellular recognition program. Using a recombinant protein library of 150 neural receptor ectodomains and a highly
stringent interaction assay suitable to detect low affinity
extracellular interactions, we identified extracellular binding
partners for orphan receptor families - such as the Lrrtms,
Lrrns and Elfns - and novel partners for well-characterised
receptors, including Unc5b. Paired spatiotemporal gene
expression patterns of all genes within the network revealed
when and where these interactions might occur during neural
development. This neuroreceptor interaction network with
integrated gene expression data provides a useful resource to
mechanistically explain how complex cellular neural networks develop.

Results
A protein interaction network of leucine-rich repeat
neuroreceptors
To identify extracellular receptor interactions involved in
neural recognition processes, we initially focused on the
zebrafish LRR family since they represent a large group of
receptor proteins expressed in the nervous system, many of
which are 'orphan' receptors. We first identified members of
this family by performing a comprehensive bioinformatics
search of the zebrafish genome. Orthologues for each of the
known type I membrane-tethered and glycophosphatidylinositol-linked mammalian subfamilies [7] were identified
and at least one representative was successfully cloned by RTPCR, with the one exception of the Lrig subfamily (Figure 1a;
see Additional data file 4 for a comprehensive list). In total,
ectodomain expression constructs were made for 53 genes,
which accounts for the vast majority (approximately 80%) of
this class of LRR neuroreceptors in the zebrafish genome. To
identify novel interactions, we used the AVEXIS (for AViditybased EXtracellular Interaction Screen) assay developed in
our laboratory, which is able to detect very low affinity extracellular interactions (t1/2 ≤ 0.1 s) and can be scaled to screen
thousands of binding events with a very low false positive rate
[24]. This assay requires that each ectodomain is expressed as
a monomeric biotinylated bait as well as a multimerized,
enzyme-tagged prey (Additional data file 1). In total, 49 baits
and 52 preys were expressed at sufficient levels and were then
normalized prior to screening [24]. The biotinylated monomers were arrayed onto streptavidin-coated microtitre plates,
and binary interactions identified by probing these arrays
with the prey ectodomains. A primary screen between the
LRR receptors of 49 × 52 = 2,548 interaction tests was performed and all positive interactions were then re-tested in
both bait-prey orientations in a validation screen using fresh
protein preparations. Seventeen interactions between 12 proteins were identified and classified into two confidence categories (Figure 1b; see Materials and methods for full details).

MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA), and are shown as a phylogenetic tree, together with a schematic representation of their protein architecture.
All the proteins shown were included in the protein-protein interaction screen. Protein domain abbreviations: LRR = leucine-rich repeat; LRRNT =
leucine-rich repeat amino-terminal domain; LRRCT = leucine-rich repeat carboxy-terminal domain; IG = immunoglobulin superfamily domain; FN =
fibronectin type III domain; TIR = Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain; TM = transmembrane region; GPI = glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. (b)
A binding grid showing all tested reciprocal interactions between the extracellular LRR proteins using AVEXIS. The baits are vertically ordered in
correspondence to the tree shown in (a) and numbered as described in Additional data file 4. The preys are similarly ordered horizontally such that
homophilic interactions are on the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Interactions identified by a red square were positive in both screens; blue
squares were detected only once, but reciprocated. Baits 7, 8, 26 and 50 and prey 43 were expressed below the threshold required for the assay and were
therefore not included in the screen. (c) A binding grid showing the interaction screen between the zebrafish LRR and IgSF receptor families. The 97 IgSF
proteins are ordered horizontally according to their phylogenetic relationships and numbered as described in Additional data file 5; the 52 LRR proteins
are similarly arranged vertically. Red and yellow squares indicate high and lower confidence interactions, respectively, as detailed in Additional data file 6.

Essentially all of the interactions in the LRR neuroreceptor
network (Figure 2) were novel, with only the homophilic
Flrt1a interaction having been previously described [25]. The
network contained the first reported extracellular interactions for the Lrrtm and Lrrn orphan receptor subfamilies.
Interacting receptor pairs were often found to involve several
members of a subfamily, suggesting that the interacting binding face is conserved between related proteins. For example,

all four Lrrtm subfamily members were able to form both
homo- and heterotypic interactions between themselves, and
Lrrn1 interacted with two out of four members of the NetrinG1 ligand/Lrrc4 subfamily [14]. We also identified interactions between LRR proteins, which could not be clustered
into subfamilies such as the Islr2-Vasn interaction.

LRR neuroreceptors have binding partners within the
IgSF
Since the IgSF is a well documented receptor family for LRR
domains [26,27], we next systematically screened the LRR
proteins against a large library of 97 bait ectodomains belonging to the zebrafish IgSF (see Additional data file 5 for a comprehensive list). In total, 52 × 97 = 5,044 interactions were
screened and positive interactions were subsequently
retested using independent protein preparations in both baitprey orientations. A further 17 interactions involving nine
IgSF proteins were added to our neuroreceptor interaction
network and similarly placed into two confidence categories
(Figure 1c).

Receptors belonging to the same paralogous subfamily are grouped and
shaded within the network, and interactions classified according to
confidence: thick lines = interaction detected in the primary screen and
independent of bait/prey orientation; thin line = other detected
interactions, including those that are orientation dependent - see Materials
and methods and Additional data file 6 for full details. An orange line
indicates that the interactions were validated using an independent
technique, either surface plasmon resonance (Figure 3) or a bead-binding
assay (Additional data file 2). IgSF-receptors = blue nodes, LRR-receptors
= red nodes.

All interactions within the LRR-IgSF network except one [28]
were previously unknown. The systematic nature of the
screen revealed novel extracellular interactions for well
described axon guidance receptors. For example, we identified novel LRR-domain-containing transmembrane ligands
for the receptors Robo2 and 3, which we have shown bind to
zebrafish Slit proteins (see Materials and methods) demonstrating that they were functionally active. Robo2 interacted
with Lrrc24 and Lrrtm1, and Robo3 with Elfn1, suggesting
that the Robo receptors are able to respond to local membrane-tethered signals in addition to secreted ligands such as
Slit. Similarly, Unc5b, a known receptor for Netrin [29,30],
interacted with three out of the four Flrt-family homologs [31]
(Figure 2). Other IgSF-LRR receptor interactions were found
for the Lrrtm1 protein, which interacted with three out of four
fibroblast growth factor receptor homologs in the screen
(Fgfr4, Fgfrl1a and Fgfrl1b), and novel binding partners for
both the axon guidance receptor Boc, and the myelin-associated glycoprotein Mag.

considerably from the relatively strong approximately 4 μM
(Flrt1b) interaction where saturable binding was evident,
through approximately 14 μM (Flrt3) to the very weak Flrt1a
interaction, the KD of which could not be estimated reliably
using the injected concentrations of Unc5b protein, but was
in excess of 50 μM. A kinetic analysis of the interactions was
consistent with the equilibrium binding data, with off rate
constants (koff) varying from 0.6 s-1 (t1/2 = 1.2 s) for Flrt1b to ≥
7.0 s-1 (t1/2 ≤ 0.1 s) for Flrt1a (Figure 3b). These measurements
show that interactions between neuroreceptors within our
network have a low affinity and vary considerably in their
binding strength, even between proteins belonging to the
same paralogous family.

Paired receptor gene expression patterns reveal
dynamic cellular neural recognition maps
The binding network of IgSF and LRR receptors (Figure 2) is
a static representation of possible extracellular protein interactions and does not reflect the spatial and temporal ordering
of recognition events used in the developing nervous system.
To reveal when and where these binding events might occur,
we determined the expression patterns of all the receptor
genes within the network at four stages of zebrafish embry-

Normalized response (%)

One notable feature of our network is that nearly half (48%)
of the receptors have more than one heterophilic binding
partner (Figure 2). In all cases, each receptor combination
had compatible expression patterns, with its multiple binding
partners expressed in overlapping territories (see below),
raising the possibility of binding competition at the cell surface. In an attempt to resolve this problem, we asked to what
extent the strengths of interactions between shared receptors
might vary. We selected a subnetwork of interactions involving Unc5b and the Flrt paralogs and determined their relative
interaction strengths using monomeric proteins and surface
plasmon resonance. The ectodomain of Unc5b was expressed
as a secreted Cd4d3+4-6His-tagged protein using mammalian cells, purified and eluted as a monodisperse peak using
gel filtration (data not shown). The equilibrium dissociation
constant (KD) was calculated by injecting dilutions of monomeric purified Unc5b over each of the three biotinylated Flrt
baits immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip; the
reference-subtracted binding responses at equilibrium were
plotted against the injected Unc5b concentration (Figure 3a).
As expected, the KDs were in the micromolar range, but varied

Different concentrations of purified, monomeric Unc5b-Cd4d3+4-6H were injected over streptavidin-coated flow cells upon which biotinylated baits Flrt1a (1018 RU), Flrt1b (984 RU), Flrt3 (1027 RU) - and control Cd4d3+4 were immobilized. The amount of bound Unc5b was calculated by subtracting
responses in the control flow cells from those in the Flrt-immobilized cells once equilibrium had been reached. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs)
were obtained by fitting a non-linear binding curve to the data. To facilitate comparison, the binding responses were normalized by using the predicted
Rmax from the fit to the data. (b) Kinetic analysis of the Unc5b-Flrt interactions. Off-rate constants (koff) were calculated by globally fitting a first order
decay curve to the dissociation phase of three concentrations of Unc5b; half-lives (t1/2) were calculated as t1/2 = ln2/koff. Shown are the normalized,
averaged values (error bars = ± 1 standard deviation, n = 3). On-rate constants (kon) were calculated in the same way using an association model and were

and methods for details of an online database of paired stage
and orientation-matched images) using mostly two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization to directly compare the expression of each gene encoding an interacting receptor pair within
the same embryo.
The expression pattern of each gene encoding an interacting
pair was summarized by plotting a grid of time-resolved tissues within the central and peripheral nervous systems, highlighting where each pair was spatiotemporally congruous
(Figure 4). All heterophilic receptor pairs had compatible

local tissue expression, usually at several different stages of
development, providing independent biological support for
the interaction network. All interacting receptor pairs were
compatibly expressed within the central nervous system
between the 24 and 48 hours post-fertilization stages, coinciding with an active period of neural development, including
neuron migration and pioneering axonal outgrowth. In contrast, fewer of the interacting pairs were compatibly
expressed in the sensory systems, such as the retina, and
especially the acoustic and olfactory systems. Several receptors were also expressed in other tissues, although these were,
in general, not spatially compatible with their binding part-

ners in the network. This suggests the existence of additional
binding partners for these receptors outside of the developing
nervous system.
While such a summary provides a useful low resolution overview, further functional insights can be gained by correlating
the detailed expression patterns of interacting receptors to
known neurobiologies: we provide three examples. Firstly,
the Lrrtm family of receptors - which all interacted with each
other - showed a complex pattern within the developing brain
(Additional data file 7) but, most remarkably, were also
expressed in a largely mutually exclusive pattern within the
retina (Figure 5a-c). This receptor family could therefore be a
source of intercellular molecular recognition cues required
for directing the connectivity of the many cellular subtypes
within the retina [32]. In our second example, the gene
encoding the Vasn protein was expressed in the specialized
glial cells that make up the floor plate of the spinal cord (Figure 5d, e). Its receptor, encoded by the islr2 gene, was
expressed by head and spinal neurons (Figure 5d, e), including motoneurons whose axons are known to directly contact
the floor plate as they innervate ipsilateral muscle fields [33].
In our last example, the expression patterns of the genes
encoding the interacting receptors Flrt1b and Unc5b were
consistent with a role in regulating retinotectal mapping:
unc5b was restricted to the dorsal region of the developing
retina from mid-somitogenesis stages whereas its binding
partner, flrt1b, was expressed in the tectum (Figure 5f).
Unc5b-Flrt1b and Flrt1b homophilic interactions could also
be involved in neural recognition within the olfactory system
since flrt1b was expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and
unc5b and flrt1b were co-expressed in the olfactory bulb at 24
hours post-fertilization (Figure 5g-i). Overall, we frequently
observed overlapping or directly abutting expression for
interacting neuroreceptors within the developing nervous
system (for examples, see Additional data file 3). Therefore,
in addition to providing starting points to identify novel signaling pathways for known neurobiologies, the receptor interaction network coupled with the developmental gene
expression patterns is a useful resource to also identify new
potential cellular interactions on the basis that they compatibly express interacting receptors.

Discussion

This study represents the first step towards mapping an
extracellular interaction network between neural receptor
proteins, a resource that will be necessary to understand the
intercellular recognition processes that ultimately underlie
brain development and function. The importance of understanding these processes is becoming increasingly apparent
as neurological disorders are more frequently being viewed as
a product of abnormal brain development [34]. Significantly,
we have described here binding partners for three orphan
LRR receptor subfamilies, including the Lrrtms, which have
been implicated in neurological diseases, including schizo-

phrenia. While the LRR and IgSF are both large families of
neurally expressed receptors, there are several other families
of cell surface proteins that contribute to neural recognition
processes. A comprehensive extracellular network of interactions within the developing nervous system will require the
addition of these protein families to our protein library. Crucially, however, we have shown that the systematic screening
approach using the AVEXIS method has the scalability and
sensitivity to detect transient interactions that are not generally detected by other high throughput protein binding
assays. Beyond identifying extracellular binding partners for
orphan receptor families, this systematic unbiased method
can identify additional binding partners for receptors that
already have identified ligands.
Currently, our protein library contains approximately 80% of
the zebrafish neural LRR receptors, providing a high density
coverage for this family of receptors, which are known to be
important for synaptic target selection [35]. We have shown
that LRR receptor proteins are able to form both homophilic
and heterophilic interactions within the family but also interact with receptors from the IgSF. Despite this large scale
approach, we did not identify binding partners for all LRR
subfamilies; indeed, both the Slitrk and Lrrc3 subfamilies still
have no documented extracellular binding partner. LRR
receptors are also known to bind other protein families such
as the Netrin-G [14] and tumor necrosis factor-receptor family [36] and the future inclusion of these receptor families into
our interaction screens is likely to reveal further binding partners for these subfamilies.
The AVEXIS assay was developed and implemented at a high
stringency threshold to effectively eliminate false positives so
as to produce high-quality datasets [24]. Using this stringency, approximately 0.5% of unique interactions screened calculated using just one bait-prey orientation - are positive.
Although difficult to directly compare due to the ascertainment biases inherent in selecting proteins restricted to a particular subcellular localization (such as the plasma
membrane) or screening within protein families previously
demonstrated to interact, this interaction frequency lies
between large-scale binary yeast-two-hybrid assays (approximately 0.01%) [37] and the LUMIER assay (approximately
8%) [38]. The paucity of zebrafish protein interaction data
makes a false negative rate difficult to assess, but by using the
closest mammalian orthologue, the main class of false negatives comprised homophilic interactions. This is most likely
due to prey-prey associations [24], although it should be
noted that AVEXIS is able to detect some homophilic interactions and further work is required to determine the biochemical and/or structural reasons for this difference. A
complementary scalable assay dedicated to identifying
homophilic receptor interactions has been developed and
could be used to specifically detect this class of interactions
[39]. AVEXIS may also not be generally suitable to detect
interactions between ectodomains that interact in cis to form

co-receptor complexes since no interaction between NgR1
and Lingo1 ectodomains was detected [40]. During the preparation of this manuscript, an independent study reported the
Flrt3-Unc5b interaction in Xenopus and demonstrated its
role in cell adhesion processes during early embryogenesis
[28].
The systematic nature of our screening approach revealed
that many receptors have multiple binding partners with
compatible expression patterns, raising the possibility of
binding competition at the cell surface. While parameters
such as abundance, local clustering and accessibility will also
influence binding in vivo, the intrinsic binding affinity of a
ligand for its receptor is important for resolving and measuring these effects. The finding that the three Flrt paralogs have
different binding affinities for the Unc5b receptor, spanning
at least an order of magnitude, was surprising and is likely to
influence their ability to initiate signaling in vivo. Quantitative measurements of adhesion receptors in the immune system have shown that solution interaction strengths weaker
than approximately 50 μM are unlikely to be high enough to
support spontaneous interactions at physiological surface
densities, highlighting the functional relevance of these measurements [41].

Conclusions

We have initially focused on two large families of neural
receptor proteins - LRR and IgSF - as a starting point to begin
a systematic approach to identify all extracellular recognition
events required in the development of the vertebrate nervous
system. In principle, this approach could be applied to other
receptor families and secreted ligands. We anticipate that
these networks of recognition receptors interpreted in the
context of their corresponding gene expression patterns will
provide a valuable new resource for neurobiology and will
stimulate further research into the functional role of these
interactions.

domains, which were ligated into a mammalian expression
vector based on pTT3 [44]. The protein library was produced
as previously described [24].

Interaction screen
Interactions were identified using the AVEXIS procedure as
described [24]. Each plate contained both negative and positive controls as shown in Additional data file 1. Negative controls were the plate prey presented to the baits rat Cd4d3+4
(well H7), Cd200R (H8) and Cd200 (H9). Positive controls
were Cd200R prey and Cd200 bait (H10) and the Cd200 bait
diluted 1:10 (H11) and 1:100 (H12). Fifty-two LRR prey proteins were systematically screened against 49 LRR and 97
IgSF ectodomain bait proteins derived from membranebound receptors [24]. The vast majority of the LRRs and 28
of the IgSF proteins (indicated in Additional data file 5) were
initially screened in both bait-prey orientations. Protein pairs
that showed positive interactions in the first-pass screen were
re-expressed and systematically re-screened in the same
matrix-style manner as both baits and preys in an independent validation screen. Interactions that were positive in the
first screen and could be detected in a reciprocal fashion were
considered as high confidence interactions. Other interactions, such as those that were dependent upon the bait-prey
orientation, were regarded as lower confidence interactions.
Full details of the screening results are shown in Additional
data file 6 and the protein interactions from this publication
have been submitted to the International Molecular
Exchange Consortium (IMEx) [45] through IntAct (pmid:
17145710) and assigned the identifier IM-11659. Expected
interactions, including those between the zebrafish Robo and
Slit orthologs, were detected in subsequent and ongoing
interaction screens showing that the recombinant proteins
are functionally active and full details are available at IntAct:
Robo1-Slit1b, 2, 3 (EBI-2268920, EBI-2269164, EBI2269173), Robo2-Slit2 (EBI-2269141) and Robo3-Slit1b, 2
(EBI-2269026, EBI-2268001).

Fluorescent bead binding

Materials and methods
Zebrafish husbandry
Zebrafish were maintained on a 14/10 hour light/dark cycle at
28.5°C according to UK Home Office and local institutional
regulations, and staged according to Kimmel [42]. Embryos
used for in situ hybridization were the progeny of a WIK/alb
outcross; alb/alb embryos were used where endogenous pigment obscured staining signals.

Gene cloning and ectodomain library construction
The entire predicted extracellular and transmembrane
regions of cell surface LRR-domain-containing genes were
amplified by RT-PCR from mixed-stage zebrafish cDNA using
oligonucleotides designed from automated gene predictions
of the zebrafish genome [43]. PCR products were either
cloned or used as further templates to amplify predicted ecto-

The extracellular regions of rat Cd200, Lrrn1, Vasn, Robo2,
Lrrtm1, Unc5b and Flrt3 used in the AVEXIS screening were
cloned into a pTT3-based expression vector to produce a chimeric construct that contained the transmembrane domains
of the rat Cd200R and the green fluorescent protein in the
cytoplasmic region. HEK293E cells were transfected with
these constructs, harvested 2 to 3 days later, washed three
times in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin, vortexed and approximately 5 × 105 cells aliquoted into
each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtitre plate. Interactions were then detected using a modified version of the fluorescent bead binding experiments described in [46]. Cells
were then presented to biotinylated bait proteins immobilised around streptavidin-coated Nile Red fluorescent 0.4 to
0.6 μm microbeads (Spherotech Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) at
a ratio of approximately 120 beads per cell. After incubating
for an hour on ice the cells and beads were resuspended in

250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin and analyzed for binding events using a BD LSR II flow
cytometer and the data were analysed using FlowJo v7.5.3
software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Protein purification and BIAcore analysis
Protein purification and BIAcore analysis were performed as
described [24]. Briefly, the ectodomain of Unc5b was produced in mammalian cells as a Cd4d3+4-6His-tagged protein
and purified on a 1 ml His-Trap column (GE Healthcare,
Amersham, Bucks, UK). Protein aggregates, which are known
to influence kinetic experiments, were removed by gel filtration using a 125 ml Superose6 column prior to BIAcore analysis. The indicated amounts of the Flrt-Cd4d3+4-bio baits
were immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and
approximate molar equivalents of Cd4d3+4-bio were used as
a reference. All binding studies were performed in HBS-EP
buffer (GE Healthcare, Amersham, Bucks, UK) at zebrafish
physiological temperature (28°C). Flow rates of 100 μl min-1
were used for kinetic studies to minimize rebinding effects
and data were collected at the maximum rate of 10 Hz. Equilibrium dissociation and both on and off rate constants were
calculated using the appropriate fitting model in the BIAevaluation software.

In situ hybridization
Fluorescent two-color wholemount in situ hybridizations
were essentially carried out as described [47]. RNA probes
were prepared from a template amplified from the protein
expression constructs encoding the entire ectodomain fragments. To facilitate comparison, single color images of the
gene expression patterns at several stages of development
were stage and orientation-matched and are presented in an
online database at [48]. Expression data are also publicly
available at [49].
