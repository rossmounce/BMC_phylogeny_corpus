Abstract
Background: Rhinosporidiosis is a disease affecting primarily the mucosa of nose, conjunctiva and
urethra. It is endemic in some Asiatic regions, affecting people of any age and sex. Its manifestation
is a polypoid mass growing inside the affected cavity and the only treatment is surgical excision.
Rhinosporidium seeberi is the aetiological agent. Many discussions arouse regarding the taxonomic
classification of the microorganism, recent studies established it is an aquatic protistan parasite. The
lesion may recur and sometimes cause osteolytic bone lesions. In endemic areas it is not easy to
establish if recurrent lesions are due to relapse or reinfection.
Case presentation: A 26-year-old male patient from India, resident in Italy since 2005, presented
in March 2006 with a history of nasal obstruction of three months duration. Physical examination
showed an erythematous, papillomatous mass, 3 cm in diameter, obstructing the right nasal cavity.
A microscopic diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis was made. Few Italian human cases of this disease have
been previously reported in the literature.
Conclusion: Rhinosporidiosis is a condition which both clinicians and pathologists should keep in
mind when managing patients from endemic countries with nasal masses. Moreover, it is very
interesting in such cases to follow the clinical course: an eventual recurrence of the lesion in our
patient would mean a true relapse, excluding the possibility of a reinfection, more probable in the
endemic areas.

Background
Rhinosporidiosis is an infectious disease, endemic in
some areas of Asia, such as India and Ceylon, although it
may occur in the Americas, Europe, Africa, more commonly in the tropics. Outbreaks of human and animal
disease have been recently described in Europe and
reports of sporadical cases in temperate and tropical coun-

tries continue to appear [1,2]. The aetiological agent is
Rhinosporidium seeberi, whose taxonomy has been debated
in the last decades [3], since the microrganism is intractable to isolation and microbiological culture. Moreover, it
shows morphological features resembling those of fungi
and protozoa [4]. The biological agent has a mature stage
that consists of large, thick-walled spherical structures

coagulation. There is no demonstrated efficacy in using
antifungal and/or antimicrobial drugs. Recurrence, dissemination in anatomical close sites and local secondary
bacterial infections are the most frequent complications.
Few cases have been previously described in Italy: two
native Italian cases were reported by Karunaratne in 1963
(cited trough van der Coer review about rhinosporidiosis
in Europe in 1992) [6]. Two more case were described by
Di Tondo et al. in 1985 and by Gori and Scasso in 1994
[7,8].

Case presentation

Nasal rhinosporidiosis
Nasal rhinosporidiosis. In the insert, globular cyst containing
endospores (Haematoxylin & Eosin, 50×; in the insert, 400×)

(called sporangia) containing smaller "daughter cells"
(called "sporangiospores"), and it can be visualized with
fungal stains as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) and
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), as well as with standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Clinically, the lesion
presents as a polypoid, soft mass, sometimes pedunculated, of the nose (primary site of infection), the eye and
its adnexa, above all conjunctiva, or the urethra. Larynx,
trachea, skin and lung are less frequently involved. Osteolytic bone infiltration is another clinical presentation.
Generalized rhinosporidiosis with skin and visceral
involvement is extremely rare [5]. The only curative
approach is the surgical excision combined with electro-

Clinical history
A 26-year-old male patient from India, resident in Italy
since 2005, presented in March 2006 to the Department
of Otorhinolaryngology with a history of nasal obstruction of three months duration. The family history of the
patient revealed a similar disease in his mother, which
recurred twice (in 1994 and in 2000). The patient referred
recurrent epistaxis since the age of 7, treated with cold
packs, and a not better specified conjunctival inflammation cured with eyedrops in September 2005. Physical
examination showed an erythematous, papillomatous
mass, 3 cm in diameter, obstructing the right nasal cavity,
attached by a narrow pedicle to the nasal septum. No
abnormality was seen in the controlateral nasal cavity or
nasopharynx. The mass was resected endoscopically and
the base of implant was electrocoagulated. The patient did
not assume any drug therapy and, until today, after five
months of follow-up, during which he underwent a clinical exam twice, he is healthy with no sign of recurrence.
Macroscopic and microscopic findings
The excised mass weighed 4 grams, measured a maximum
diameter of 3 cm, was pink, with a fleshy consistence,
studded with whitish spots on its surface. On histological
examination, the lesion showed the characteristic features
of the rhinosporidiosis: the polypoid fibroconnective
stroma, covered by flat multi-stratified squamous epithelium, contained many globular cysts. Each of these cysts
represented a thick-walled sporangium containing
numerous "daughter spores" in different stages of development (Fig. 1). The stroma contained a vascular fibroconnective tissue with fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and
an inflammatory infiltrate (neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes). Histochemical
stains such as PAS, GMS (Fig. 2) and mucicarmine were
used to establish the correct diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis.
Morphological criteria were based on the diameter of the
endospores and sporangia, respectively 5–10 µm and 50–
1000 µm. These findings made easier the distinction of
Rhinosporidium seeberi from another common nasal mycosis aetiological agent, Coccidioides immitis.

Conclusion
Rhinosporidiosis is a rare chronic granulomatous disease,
endemic in South India, Sri Lanka and some areas of the
African continent. Infrequently, isolated cases were
reported in other parts of the world, mainly due to the
socio-cultural phenomenon of the migration. The major
debate about the aetiological agent, Rhinosporidium seeberi,
is regarding its precise taxonomy. Most microbiologists
initially considered it a fungus just because of its property
to be stained by fungal stains such as GMS and PAS; the
uncertainty arises from the difficulty to isolate and to
grow the microrganism in culture (only in tissue cultures
some could grow it through an entire life cycle). Some
authors recently postulated that the aetiological agent of
the disease was not a fungus but a prokaryotic cyanobacterium called Microcystis aeruginosa. This hypothesis was
based on the finding of this bacterium in rivers and ponds
where patients with rhinosporidiosis used to bathe, and
supported by laser-scanning confocal, light, electron
microscopy and molecular findings [9-12]. Nevertheless,
this observation can not provide a compelling evidence.
Moreover, some authors found no evidence of a relationship between this microrganism and Rhinosporidium seeberi [12], whereas others went to the conclusion (the most
accepted today) that the responsible agent is an aquatic
protistan parasite belonging to a novel group of fish parasites (Mesomycetozoa), located phylogenetically between
the fungal and animal divergence [4,13].
Rhinosporidium seeberi should be distinguished from
another microrganism, Coccidioides immitis. This latter has
similar mature stages represented by large, thick-walled,
spherical structures containing endospores, but the spherules are smaller (diameter of 20–80 µm versus 50–1000
µm) and contain small endospores (diameter of 2–4 µm).
Moreover, Coccidiodes does not stain with the mucicarmine.

incubation before clinical manifestation: we can presume
that the patient was infected before his arrival in Italy, and
the disease manifested as a polypoid nasal mass at least
after one year; indeed it is very likely that the real first
exposition to the aetiological agent happened many years
ago, when the patient was a child; recurrent epistaxis, one
of the most frequent initial clinical signs, presented since
the age of 7, i.e. 19 years ago.
At present, the treatment for rhinosporidiosis is the surgical excision. Some authors proposed a medical therapy
with dapsone [14,15], but the results are not convincent.
Antimicrobial therapy is ineffective, and the disease may
recur after months or years.
In conclusion, this is an infrequent Italian human case of
rhinosporidiosis, rare cases being previously reported in
the literature. Rhinosporidiosis is a condition which both
clinicians and pathologists should keep in mind when
managing patients from endemic countries with nasal
masses. Moreover, it will be very interesting to follow in
the next years the clinical course of our patient: an eventual recurrence of the lesion, usually occurring after a long
time, would mean a true relapse, excluding the possibility
of a reinfection, more probable in the endemic areas.

The pathway of transmission of Rhinosporidium remains
unclear, but, since the most affected sites are the nose and
the eye, it has been suggested that it is air- or water-borne;
water and soil are believed to be the reservoir of infection,
given the high incidence of the disease in sandworkers,
paddy cultivators and people bathing in stagnant waters.
It is interesting in our case that the patient treated his
chronic epistaxis only with cold packs: it is likely that in
his country people used to make cold packs with contaminated water; thus, many cases of recurrence could be
interpreted as reinfections, and this could explain the
occurrence of the same disease in his mother for two times
(in 1994 and in 2000). The "conjunctive inflammation"
he reported could be related to the same infection too, but
we do not have sufficient clinical elements to debate
about that. An important feature of the life cycle of the
Rhinosporidium that we could argue is its prolonged
