Abstract
Background: Many electron transport chain (ETC) genes show accelerated rates of
nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in anthropoid primate lineages, yet in non-anthropoid
lineages the ETC proteins are typically highly conserved. Here, we test the hypothesis that COX5A,
the ETC gene that encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, shows a pattern of anthropoidspecific adaptive evolution, and investigate the distribution of this protein in catarrhine brains.
Results: In a dataset comprising 29 vertebrate taxa, including representatives from all major
groups of primates, there is nearly 100% conservation of the COX5A amino acid sequence among
extant, non-anthropoid placental mammals. The most recent common ancestor of these species
lived about 100 million years (MY) ago. In contrast, anthropoid primates show markedly elevated
rates of nonsynonymous evolution. In particular, branch site tests identify five positively selected
codons in anthropoids, and ancestral reconstructions infer that substitutions in these codons
occurred predominantly on stem lineages (anthropoid, ape and New World monkey) and on the
human terminal branch. Examination of catarrhine brain samples by immunohistochemistry
characterizes for the first time COX5A protein distribution in the primate neocortex, and suggests
that the protein is most abundant in the mitochondria of large-size projection neurons. Real time
quantitative PCR supports previous microarray results showing COX5A is expressed in cerebral
cortical tissue at a higher level in human than in chimpanzee or gorilla.
Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that both protein structural and gene
regulatory changes contributed to COX5A evolution during humankind's ancestry. Furthermore,
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptations in ETC genes contributed to the
emergence of the energetically expensive anthropoid neocortex.

Background
The electron transport chain (ETC) genes encode essential
components of the mitochondrial machinery that carries
out aerobic energy production. Since the integrity of this
machinery must be maintained to sustain life, the mammalian ETC proteins are generally evolutionarily conserved. Among primates, however, the ETC genes show
marked upsurges in the rate of nonsynonymous (aminoacid changing) substitutions [1-17]. These upsurges,
indicative of adaptive evolution, have not occurred randomly; rather, they have occurred within anthropoid primates [9], a clade that includes New and Old World
monkeys and apes, including humans. Life history and
morphological features characteristic of this clade include
a relatively enlarged cerebral cortex, prolonged intrauterine fetal development followed postnatally by prolonged
dependency of the young on nurturing adults, and longer
lifespan. The aerobic demand of these features makes it
plausible that they have acted as selective pressures during
anthropoid evolution, producing adaptive amino acid
and possibly regulatory changes in aerobic energy producing ETC genes.
Previous work suggested that among ETC genes, COX5A,
the nuclear gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit
5A, may provide a striking example of adaptive evolution.
Initial characterization of subunit 5A in human revealed a
high degree of conservation with the corresponding subunit in cow [18]. In a subsequent bioinformatics study,
Schmidt et al. [13] found that, among COX5A protein
(COX5Ap) sequences from mammals, the human orthologue (the only primate representative in that dataset) differed by five amino acid residues from mouse, rat, cow
and pig, all of which had identical amino acid sequences.
Here, with newly generated COX5A coding region nucleotide sequences and bioinformatically extracted orthologues from publicly available whole genome sequences,
we tested whether this ETC gene shows the pattern of
anthropoid-specific adaptive evolution observed in 14
other ETC proteins [9,10]. We did so within the context of
a robust statistical framework, employing the PAML package [19] to determine: 1) whether the anthropoid clade
has a different ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous
substitution rates (i.e., omega value) when compared to
other placental mammals and 2) whether particular sites
in COX5Ap show the signature of positive selection
within the anthropoid clade.
In addition to these sequence-based analyses, we investigated patterns of COX5A expression and localization in
catarrhine brains using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) techniques. Finally, we
identified the anthropoid lineages on which changes in
COX5Ap residues that interact with other cytochrome c
oxidase (COX) subunits occurred. Based on these results,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/8

we explored the hypothesis that COX5A evolution in
humankind's ancestry involved both protein structural
and gene regulatory changes, and that the anthropoidspecific evolution observed in ETC proteins represents an
adaptive response to the increased energy demands of an
enlarged neocortex.

Results and Discussion
Complete COX5A nucleotide coding region and deduced
amino acid sequences encoding the mature peptide were
analysed in 26 vertebrate species, including newly generated data from 14 primate species: common chimpanzee
(Pan troglodytes), bonobo (Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla
gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), red-cheeked gibbon
(Nomascus gabriellae), siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus),
mantled guereza (Colobus guereza), olive baboon (Papio
anubis), pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea), whitelipped tamarin (Saguinus labiatus), white-eared titi monkey (Callicebus donacophilus), slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), brown greater galago (Otolemur crassicaudatus) and
brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus); and one marsupial, the
parma wallaby (Macropus parma). Partial sequences were
obtained for three additional taxa (cat, rabbit, and
chicken). Apart from a single amino acid difference in the
elephant sequence, the protein sequence alignment
showed no amino acid changes from the last common
ancestor of placental mammals to present-day nonanthropoids, in a sampling that includes representatives
from every major placental mammalian clade except
Xenarthra (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the elephant is similar to
anthropoids in that both share the aerobically demanding
feature of lengthy gestation. Within anthropoids, 13
amino acid replacements were inferred by all ancestral
state reconstruction methods, and eight of these occurred
on the human lineage from the last common ancestor
(LCA) of haplorhines (tarsier and anthropoids) (Fig. 2).
Evidence for adaptive evolution
Results from the model-based codeml analyses confirm
that COX5A omega ratios vary among lineages in vertebrates. Specifically, the statistical model assuming one
omega value for all branches (i.e., the one ratio model)
had a likelihood value of -1431.66, with an omega value
of 0.048. The model that assumes an independent omega
value for each branch (i.e., the free ratio model) had a
likelihood value of -1388. According to the likelihood
ratio test, the free ratio model fit the data significantly better than the one ratio model (p < 0.01). The inferred
omega values and the numbers of nonsynonymous and
synonymous substitutions under the free ratio model are
presented in Fig. 1. In addition, the model that segregates
anthropoids from non-anthropoid placental mammals fit
the data significantly better than the model that assigned
the same omega value to all placental mammals (p < 105), indicating that the ratio of nonsynonymous/synony-

mous substitution rates differs in this clade; in particular,
the omega value inferred for anthropoids is 52 times
greater than that inferred for non-anthropoid placental
mammals (0.431 vs. 0.008; Table 1).
Despite this elevated ratio in anthropoids, we note that
the overall ratio is still less than one. This result, however,
is based on the assumption that all codons are under the
same selective pressure and thus share the same underlying omega value. Because this assumption is "grossly
unrealistic" [20], and because important changes in function can result from a few key amino acid changes that do
not elevate the overall omega ratio above one [21], we
conducted a branch-site test of adaptive evolution. Here,
the Anthropoidea as a total group was fixed as the foreground lineage, i.e., the branches on which there was permitted a class of sites with an omega > 1. Results from this
test provide evidence of positive selection on particular
sites during anthropoid evolution: the model allowing a
class of sites with an omega higher than one (i.e., positive
selection) fit the data significantly better than an alternative model that fixed omega at one for this same site class
(p < 0.002). Specifically, five sites were identified as positively selected, four of which had a posterior probability >
0.95 (Table 1). Furthermore, we note that despite the
many amino acid replacements inferred to have occurred
throughout the Anthropoidea (see below), the five positively selected sites show changes occurring predominantly on stem lineages (anthropoid, ape, and New World
monkey) and on the human terminal branch. The localization of these particular sites to these three stem lineages,
combined with the M1 analysis (Fig. 1) depicting a classic
sequence [22] of markedly increased dN relative to dS, followed by descendant lineages with a markedly decreased
dN relative to dS, presents a pattern strongly indicative of
positive selection.

Ancestral state reconstruction methods confirm and
extend results obtained by the codeml analysis. Among
the five sites identified as positively selected by the branch
site test, four were inferred to have changed on more than
one anthropoid lineage, and three were inferred to have
changed on the anthropoid stem (Fig. 2). In addition, all
three ancestral state reconstruction methods inferred a
fourth amino acid change on the anthropoid stem that
was not identified by the branch site test: a methionine to
isoleucine at residue 33. It is tempting to speculate that
this replacement may have acted as a "permissive" change
that then allowed the selection of the other three amino
acid changes occurring on this and perhaps other
descendant anthropoid branch(es). This sequence of
events was recently demonstrated in an elegant study by
Ortlund et al. [23] in their investigation of cortisol-sensitive glucocorticoid receptor (GR) evolution in vertebrates.
Using a combination of structural, phylogenetic and functional analyses of ancestral corticosteroid receptors, the
authors identified a small set of permissive amino acid
changes that stabilized specific elements of the protein. In
conjunction with additional changes that diminished the
receptor's sensitivity to aldosterone and increased its sensitivity to cortisol, these permissive changes allowed an
additional and subsequent set of function-switching
amino acid changes that conferred a fully GR-like phenotype that is sensitive only to cortisol. With respect to
COX5Ap, verification of this hypothesis in future studies
would require additional, fine-tuned functional data
regarding the effects of each of the observed replacements
alone and in concert on the activity of the reconstructed
protein.
Expression and localization of COX5A
Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that relative COX5A
gene expression levels in the anterior cingulate cortex vary
among human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and macaque (Fig.
3). Specifically, human and macaque showed similar gene

COX5A Expression levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (solid bars) and microarray signal values (hatched bars). qRTPCR expression levels are expressed in relative terms, with samples compared to a calibrator amplified from human reference

expression levels, as did chimpanzee and gorilla, and the
first pair of species showed higher levels of expression
than the second pair (Fig. 3). This pattern confirms the
trend previously suggested by microarray analysis [24],
and represents a more robust dataset from which to make
such observations: unlike the previous experiment, which
involved hybridizing non-human samples to a humanspecific microarray, these qRT-PCR results are not confounded by sequence mismatches between sample and
microarray chip. Specifically, the COX5A expression
results reported by Uddin et al. [24] were based on an
Affymetrix probe set (203663_s_at) that shows 0.8% difference with the published chimpanzee genome sequence
[25] and 7.3% difference with the published rhesus
macaque sequence [26]. Thus, the present results suggest
that COX5A has undergone not only coding region
sequence evolution, but also regulatory evolution in
anthropoid primates. This hypothesis is supported by the
observation of primate COX5A expression patterns in
other tissues that differ from those reported here: in
microarray experiments performed on fibroblast cell lineages, humans showed a lower COX5A expression level

than did bonobos or gorillas, and comparison of the
human and bonobo expression levels showed a significant difference [27]. Nevertheless, without additional
samples from additional chimpanzees and gorillas, the
possibility that our results are due to interindividual differences within these species and/or age-related differences in gene expression profiles cannot formally be ruled
out.
Among macaques, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans,
the localization of COX5Ap as revealed by immunohistochemistry showed a punctate staining pattern that is consistent with the morphology of mitochondria (Fig. 4, data
from gorilla not shown). Similar staining patterns were
obtained in all species with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. As evident by colocalization with
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and neuronspecific nuclear protein (NeuN), COX5Ap was particularly enriched in the cytoplasm of the soma and proximal
apical dendrite of neurons, especially large pyramidal
cells. We also observed diffuse COX5Ap-immunoreactive
puncta throughout the neuropil, which corresponds to

understand more completely the functional role of
COX5A in neocortical circuits and the possible consequences of positive selection on this gene, it will be necessary to define further the phenotype and distribution of
cells in the brain that show high levels of expression for
COX5Ap using strategies such as laser microcapture dissection combined with qRT-PCR or mass spectroscopy
proteomics in future studies.
Role of accelerated COX evolution
As we have demonstrated, changes in COX5Ap are rare
among placental mammals outside the primate clade.
Among four positively selected sites identified by the
branch site test with posterior probabilities > 0.95, two
showed changes in their physicochemical properties: residue 5, which changed from positively charged to neutral
on the ape and New World monkey stems and on the
baboon terminal (Fig. 2); and residue 64, which changed
from nonpolar to polar in the anthropoid stem and from
polar to nonpolar on the human terminal. Interestingly,
the charge neutralizations are parallel to those observed at
the binding site for cytochrome c on COX in anthropoids,
where the binding site changes reduced the electrostatic
interaction between the docked molecules [15]. Of note,
one amino acid change on the human terminal at position 70 (Ala to Val) is a reversal of a change on the anthropoid stem (Fig. 2).

the space occupied by glia, dendritic processes, axons, and
synapses. Double immunostaining against glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) demonstrated that astrocytes do
not show high levels of COX5Ap. Indeed, 95.3% of cells
that are enriched with COX5Ap also contain the neuronspecific protein NeuN in macaques, as estimated by optical disector counting. The white matter did not display a
high density of COX5Ap staining.

Although the role of the inferred amino acid changes in
COX5Ap is currently unknown, it is noteworthy that the
changes in this protein are located in residues that are in
proximity to other, physically close, COX subunits (Table
2). Of the five positively selected sites identified by the
branch site test in COX5Ap, seven replacements within 10
Å of these sites have occurred in COX2p and COX4p during anthropoid evolution. Examination of the nature of
the changes suggests there has been an electrostatic
change such that the interaction between position 5 of
COX5Ap and residues 52 and 57 of COX2p has been neutralized; in addition, residues 55 and 56 of this subunit
have changed from polar to nonpolar. Furthermore, the
potentially interacting, altered residues of COX4p (22 and
63) have changed from neutral to positive charge (Fig. 2
and Table 2), forming a positive patch. Of particular interest is that COX4p residue 22, which has changed from Tyr
to His, is adjacent to the proposed ATP binding site that
includes COX4p 20 [29].

These results suggest that COX5Ap is most abundant in
the mitochondria of large-size projection neurons of the
neocortex. It is noteworthy that neocortical enlargement
in primates is associated with increasing numbers of large
pyramidal neurons that are intensely neurofilament H
protein-immunoreactive, have long-range projecting
axons, and are presumably metabolically costly [28]. To

An additional consequence of the location of COX5Ap in
close contact to the nucleotide-binding domain of COX4p
is potential regulation by 3,5-diiodothyronine (T2), a thyroid hormone produced when the iodothyronine deiodinase D3 acts over thyroxine (T4) [30]. T2 has biological
activity stimulating mitochondrial respiration by nuclear
independent pathways [30,31] and is known to bind to

COX5Ap and abolish the allosteric inhibition of respiration at high ATP/ADP ratios [32]. More generally, triiodothyronine (T3) thyroid hormone is considered to be a
major regulator of mitochondrial activity [33] and has
been shown to regulate the expression of a number of
COX subunits, inducing functional increases in COX
enzyme activity [34]. COX5A amino acid evolution may
thus represent the product of selective pressures acting on
the regulation of metabolism. In the context of this
hypothesis, we note that thyroid hormones are known to
play a critical role in early brain development [35-37] and
that humans show evidence for a greater affinity of transthyretin and/or thyroxine-binding globulin for thyroid
hormone when compared to chimpanzees [38]. Thus, it is
plausible that the interaction of thyroid hormones with
COX5Ap and other COX subunits may affect both the regulation of metabolism and the growth and development
of important organ systems.

Conclusion
We have shown that COX5A has been subject to protein
structural evolutionary changes in anthropoid primates
and that these changes have likely been accompanied by
additional gene regulatory changes affecting COX5A
expression levels. Furthermore, we have suggested that
these changes could affect aerobic energy metabolism
among members of this group, in part because COX5Ap is
a target of the thyroid hormone T2 [32]. In addition, a
recent analysis of cellular scaling in the neocortex of
anthropoids showed that elevated glia-neuron ratios correlate with brain enlargement [39], pointing to the role of
glia in providing metabolic support to neurons requiring

greater energy consumption for function. Because the
anthropoid amino acid changes are located in the mitochondrial matrix, close to coevolving sites in subunits 2
and 4 (Table 2) proposed to have a COX regulatory function [29], the COX5Ap amino acid replacements observed
in this study may have promoted better energy regulation
in an increasingly high demand environment. While alternative interpretations of the data are possible – that, for
instance, the higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions
in COX5A in anthropoids may be a function of their larger
body and smaller presumed effective population size [40],
which would reduce the effectiveness of purifying selection on slightly deleterious amino acid replacements [41];
or that the changed composition of mtDNA in anthropoids [42] may be the "motor" driving the putative positive selection of nuclear-encoded ETC [42], we note that
COX5Ap amino acid sequences are identical in mammals
with a wide range of body sizes and basal metabolic rates
(e.g., shrew, cow), and that, within the context of intergenomic interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrially
encoded ETC genes, it has been shown that rapid evolution in mitochondrially encoded subunits can indeed be
associated with rapid divergence in interacting subunits
[43] and that positive selection is particularly pronounced
among interacting residues in ETC proteins [15,44]. More
broadly, given that some of the main phenotypic differences associated with anthropoid origins are related to
aerobic energy metabolism (e.g., longer lifespan, larger
neocortex, and prolonged fetal development), both structural and regulatory evolutionary change in electron transport chain genes are likely to have contributed to the

emergence and evolution of anthropoid primates
[8,9,24,45].

Methods
DNA sequences
We sequenced the COX5A coding region for 16 mammalian species, including eight apes: human (Homo sapiens
(2X)), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), bonobo
(Pan paniscus), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo
pygmaeus), red-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae) and
siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus); two Old World monkeys: mantled guereza (Colobus guereza) and olive baboon
(Papio anubis); three New World monkeys: pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea), white-lipped tamarin (Saguinus
labiatus) and white-eared titi monkey (Callicebus
donacophilus); three strepsirrhines: slow loris (Nycticebus
coucang), brown greater galago (Otolemur crassicaudatus)
and brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) and one marsupial, the
parma wallaby (Macropus parma) via RACE-PCR [33]. Four
additional primate and two outgroup sequences were
obtained from public databases: Philipine tarsier (Tarsius
syrichta, AY_236506), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri
sciureus, AY_585857), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta,
AY_585861), human (NM_004255), mouse (Mus musculus, NM_007747), and cow (Bos Taurus, NM_00100289).
Finally, 8 additional outgroup species were obtained from
the ENSEMBL public database, including: frog (Xenopus
tropicalis, ENSXETT00000045679), chicken (Gallus gallus,
ENSGALT00000022855), gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica, ENSMODT00000011691), African elephant (Loxodonta africana, ENSLAFT00000006266), cat
(Felis catus, ENSFCAT00000010590), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, ENSMLUT00000013702), shrew (Sorex
araneus, ENSSART00000003977) and rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus, ENSOCUT00000003256). Species in which there
was more than one copy of COX5A, or for which poor reads
were available, were not included in the study. All
sequences newly obtained in this study were deposited in
GenBank (DQ987236–DQ987252). Human reference
sequence NM_004255 was used in the sequence analyses
described below.

RNA was isolated either with the phenol-chloroform
method or the RNeasy® midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
RACE PCR [33] was performed on these RNAs using the
following primers: Pri_R1, 5' GGTATCATCAGTATTTCCAGG 3'; Pri_R2, 5' TTAAGTTGGTCTAAGTTCCTGG 3';
Pri_R3, 5' CTTATGAGGTCCTGCTTTGTC 3'; Apes_R1, 5'
TTTGTCAAGGCCCAGTTCCTC 3'; Apes_R2, 5' GAGTGGA
GATTCCCAGTTCATT 3'; Apes_R3, 5' TTGGTCTAAGTTCCTGGATGAC 3'; 5AF1, 5' CATGGGTCACANGAGCANGA
3'; 5AF2, 5' GAGTTTGATGCTCGCTGGGT 3'; 5AF3, 5'
GCCAGAYATNGATGCYTGGGA 3'. RACE PCR conditions
were: 30 cycles of denaturation, 94°C, 40 s; annealing,
57°C, 30 s; and extension 72°C, 1 min and 10 s; initial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/8

denaturation at 94°C for 2 min and a final extension at
72°C for 7 min. RACE PCR products were visualized on
1% agarose gels and products were extracted using the
Qiaquick® (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) gel extraction kit. DNA
sequencing reactions were performed using the Big Dye®
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) cycle sequencing kit
according to the manufacturer's specifications.
Sequence analyses
Phylogenetic relationships used to investigate patterns of
COX5A nucleotide and amino acid sequence evolution
were obtained from the literature [46,47]. Sequences were
aligned using ClustalX 1.83.1 [48]. The PAML 3.15 [19]
package was used to investigate the signature of positive
selection among specific lineages and sites in the phylogeny. First, to investigate if rate heterogeneity existed
among lineages, we compared a one omega (dN/dS)
model (M0), which assumes the same relative rate (nonsynonymous divided by synonymous rate) for all lineages, with the free ratio model (M1), which allows rates to
vary freely among the branches. Second, to investigate if
the omega ratio varied among particular branches of interest in the phylogeny, we compared two different branch
models. In the first model, two omega ratios were specified, one for all placental mammals (as a total group) and
another for the remaining branches in the tree (i.e., the
background). In the second model, three omega ratios
were specified, one for the anthropoid clade (as a total
group), another for the non-anthropoid placental mammals, and another for the remaining branches in the tree
(i.e., the background). Finally, because all of these models
assume a homogeneous omega ratio across codons, we
also applied a branch-site test of positive selection on the
anthropoid clade [49,50]. Model A (branch-site test of
positive selection) assumes four classes of sites, the first
two classes having omega values 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1,
assuming purifying selection and neutrality, respectively.
The other two classes have the same assumption for the
background branches, but allow for positive selection (i.e.
ω2>1) on the foreground branches. This model was compared with the same model A, but fixing the last two site
classes to 1 according to Zhang et al. [50]. In all cases we
checked for the existence of multiple local optima, running all models three times, with three different starting
omega values (0.5, 1, and 2). Models were compared
using the likelihood ratio test.

In addition to the previous model-based analyses, we
reconstructed ancestral COX5A coding region nucleotide
sequences to infer the amino acid changes that occurred
among the sampled vertebrate lineages. Sequences were
reconstructed, translated, and compared by three different
methods: a maximum parsimony framework using
ACCTRAN and DELTRAN algorithms as implemented in
PAUP* [51], and the codon substitution model [52]

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:8

implemented in PAML 3.15 [19]. Finally, to identify
potential interactants with the COX5Ap amino acid
replacements that occurred during anthropoid evolution,
coding region nucleotide sequences were reconstructed,
translated and compared for COX2p and COX4p (i.e., the
genes encoding COX subunits in closest proximity to
COX5Ap) using a maximum parsimony framework
(ACCTRAN and DELTRAN). Ancestral reconstruction of
COX4p sequences were based on analyses of sequences
from Wildman et al. [16]. Ancestral reconstruction of
COX2p sequences were based on analyses of sequences
listed in Additional file 1. Proximity of potentially interacting residues in COX2p and COX4p was determined
based on the crystal structure of cytochrome c oxidase
2oCC, using Swiss-PDB viewer to identify the replacements occurring at a distance of 10 Å or less.
Real time PCR
To examine and potentially validate the pattern of COX5A
upregulation in humans reported in Uddin et al. [24], a
SYBR green-based quantitative real-time quantitative PCR
(qRT-PCR) strategy was designed to test the same individuals and species originally investigated by the microarray
experiments: Homo sapiens (N = 3), Pan troglodytes (N = 1),
Gorilla gorilla (N = 1) and Macaca mulatta (N = 3). cDNA
was synthesized using total RNA (50 ng) obtained from
the anterior cingulate cortex of each individual using the
Stratascript® First-Strand Synthesis System from Stratagene
(La Jolla, CA) by following manufacturer's protocols. A
serial dilution of reference cDNA was also amplified for
use in standard curve construction and as a calibrator for
subsequent real-time experiments using Stratagene's qRTPCR Human Reference Total RNA (100 ng). COX5A-specific primers were designed in regions that were 100%
conserved among the species and individuals hybridized
to the microarray: COX5AF2 (5'-ATCCAGTCAGTTCGCTGCTA-3') and COX5AR2 (5'GTTTATCCCTTTACGCAATTCC-3') amplified a 123-bp product. COX5A expression
levels were scaled to that of EIF3S7, a control gene on the
Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B microarray chips
that demonstrated one of the lowest standard deviations
in expression levels among all tested samples (data not
shown). Primers were designed in regions that were 100%
conserved among species with available genomic data:
EIF3F1 (5'-AATGTGTTTGCCACTGATGC-3') and EIF3R1
(5'AGGAGGTCAAAGTCAGAGTTGTC-3') amplified a
137-bp product. For both primer sets, one primer was
designed to fall in two exons in order to reduce the possibility of amplifying products from potentially contaminating genomic DNA. All primers were HPLC purified,
and optimal concentrations were established using serial
dilutions of reference cDNA in preliminary experiments.

Standard curves for both primer sets produced efficiencies
> 91% and Rsq > 0.99, thus meeting or exceeding the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/8

manufacturer's recommended values for ensuring a
robust qRT-PCR assay. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions
were run on Stratagene's Mx3000P instrument in triplicate for each and primer set on each individual and on
each no template control (NTC) using the FullVelocity®
SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix® (Stratagene) following
manufacturer's protocols and including both the optional
diluted reference dye and 0.25 μl of AmpErase® Uracil Nglycosylase from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
After ensuring that all NTCs were negative and that all
samples fell within the linear range of amplification as
previously determined by the standard curves, relative
COX5A expression levels were calculated using the 2-ΔΔC T
method described in Livak and Schmittgen [53] for target
and reference samples, amplified in separate wells.
Immunohistochemistry
The localization of COX5Ap was examined in neocortex
samples from non-geriatric adult macaque monkeys
(Macaca maura), gorillas, common chimpanzees, and
humans (N = 2 individuals per species). Macaque monkey
brains were obtained from animals transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde as part of an unrelated
study. Brains of gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans were
collected within 14 hours of death and immersed in 10%
formalin. Tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 40 μm
with a freezing microtome.

Immunohistochemistry was carried out on sections from
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Initial single-label
immunohistochemical staining was performed using two
different antibodies raised against the human COX5Ap, a
mouse monoclonal IgG antibody (A-21363; Molecular
Probes; dilution 1:200) and a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (11448-1-AP; Proteintech Group, Inc.; dilution
1:50). Prior to immunostaining, sections were pretreated
for antigen retrieval by incubation in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5) at 37°C in an oven for 30 minutes.
Sections were then incubated in the primary antibody
diluted in PBS with 2% normal serum and 0.1% Triton X100 detergent for approximately 48 hours on a rotator at
4°C. After rinsing in PBS, sections were incubated in a
1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Sudan Black B (1% in
70% ethanol) was used to quench the autofluorescence
generated by lipofuscin pigments.
To characterize further the cellular localization of COX5Ap,
we also performed double-labeling immunofluorescence
experiments in the perfusion-fixed macaque monkey samples using the polyclonal COX5Ap antibody in combination with mouse monoclonal antibodies against (1)
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (MAB3418,
clone AP20; Chemicon International; dilution 1:200), (2)
neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) (MAB377; Chemi-

con International; dilution 1:100), and (3) glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) (MU020-UC; BioGenex Laboratories,
Inc.; dilution 1:10,000). Both primary antibodies were incubated with the tissue simultaneously for 48 hours as
described above. Immunoreactivity was revealed using an
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody
to visualize COX5Ap and an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody to visualize MAP2, NeuN,
and GFAP. In all immunohistochemistry runs, specificity of
the reaction was confirmed by processing negative control
sections excluding the primary antibody. No immunostaining was observed in control sections.
Brain sections were imaged with a BioRad MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning system coupled to an Olympus IX-70
microscope. Images were acquired with a 40× objective
lens, a slice thickness of 1.5 μm, and a z step of 0.5 μm.
Figures show a z projection of three contiguous confocal
slices.
Quantification of the percentage of COX5Ap-immunoreactive cells that also contained NeuN in macaques (n = 2)
was performed using the optical disector method as
described previously [39] implemented in StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). In two
sections for each monkey, optical disector frames (30 μm
× 30 μm × 6 μm) were placed within a contour drawn
around the entire cortical width in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9). Optical disectors were
placed within this contour in a systematic random fashion
using the fractionator method. Counting frames were
investigated with a 63× objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat,
N.A. 1.4) and cells were marked if their nucleolus was
contained within the three-dimensional limits of the
counting frame. Our estimate of the percentage of
COX5A+NeuN-immunoreactive cells is based on a total
sample of 619 cells.
