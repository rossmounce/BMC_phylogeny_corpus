Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial tRNAs have been the subject of study for structural biologists
interested in their secondary structure characteristics, evolutionary biologists have researched
patterns of compensatory and structural evolution and medical studies have been directed towards
understanding the basis of human disease. However, an up to date, manually curated database of
mitochondrially encoded tRNAs from higher animals is currently not available.
Description: We obtained the complete mitochondrial sequence for 277 tetrapod species from
GenBank and re-annotated all of the tRNAs based on a multiple alignment of each tRNA gene and
secondary structure prediction made independently for each tRNA. The mitochondrial (mt) tRNA
sequences and the secondary structure based multiple alignments are freely available as
Supplemental Information online.
Conclusion: We compiled a manually curated database of mitochondrially encoded tRNAs from
tetrapods with completely sequenced genomes. In the course of our work, we reannotated more
than 10% of all tetrapod mt-tRNAs and subsequently predicted the secondary structures of 6060
mitochondrial tRNAs. This carefully constructed database can be utilized to enhance our
knowledge in several different fields including the evolution of mt-tRNA secondary structure and
prediction of pathogenic mt-tRNA mutations. In addition, researchers reporting novel
mitochondrial genome sequences should check their tRNA gene annotations against our database
to ensure a higher level of fidelity of their annotation.

Background
Mitochondrially encoded tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) are an excellent object of study for researchers in several fields for a
variety of reasons. The primary reason is the wide variety
of available completely sequenced mitochondrial
genomes, which provides a large data sample from a
broad phylogenetic background. Besides the obvious

availability factor, mt-tRNAs show several unusual properties. mt-tRNAs are of particular interest to structural
biologists, since the secondary structure of the mt-tRNAs
is not as conserved as that of their nuclear encoded counterparts [1], and some mt-tRNAs in several lineages show
accelerated rates of secondary structure evolution [2].
Although some changes of the secondary structure may be

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:441

of limited use as a phylogenetic marker the observation of
parallel loss of the D-loop structure [1-3] may lead to our
understanding of the broader issues associated with parallel evolution of secondary structure.
The evolution of secondary structure in mt-tRNAs is also
coupled with rapid compensatory evolution that is aimed
at the conservation of the secondary structure stability [4].
Indeed, as much as 50% of the substitutions in mt-tRNAs
may be compensatory [4], and further study of these molecules may shed light on the selective pressure governing
compensatory evolution. Compensatory changes have
also been observed on a larger scale, with the import of
nuclear coded Lys-tRNA was shown to compensate for
complete loss of mt-Lys-tRNA in metatherians [5]. Also,
mt-tRNAs appear to be targets for post-transcriptional
RNA modification mechanisms [6] including instances of
RNA editing where modification of nucleotides that
would otherwise be damaging to function or structure
takes place [7].
Although mt-tRNAs span only 10% of the entire mitochondrial genome, they appear to be "hotspots" of disease-causing mutations, such that 50% of all pathogenic
mutations that have described for the mitochondria have
been localized to one of the mt-tRNAs [8]. In addition,
some mt-tRNAs appear to harbor more disease-causing
variants than others [8,9]. While no explanation for these
observations has been adequately tested, they underline
the medical importance of mt-tRNAs [10,11]. The availability of secondary structure information [12,13] and evolutionary information including compensatory changes
[13,14] have made progress in the identification and possible treatment of deleterious variants in mt-tRNAs
[14,15]. Thus, a compilation of a manually curated database of mt-tRNAs incorporating a multiple alignment of
genes from many closely related species and an independent secondary structure prediction, would serve to
advance structural, evolutionary and medically relevant
studies of mt-tRNAs and aid in the annotation of mttRNAs in newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes.

Construction and content
We obtained complete tetrapod mitochondrial genomes
from GenBank [16] using the Entrez search system [17]
with "tetrapoda AND complete AND genome" in as the
key entry and setting the Limits option of the Entrez
search to mitochondrial sequences. A total of 277 different tetrapod genomes were obtained, including 148 mammalian, 53 amphibian and 76 saurosopoda genomes (all
GenBank files used are available at the database website).
We then obtained the sequence of all annotated tRNAs
and their flanking regions using a Perl script. All of the mttRNA sequences were aligned with the muscle program
[18] and then manually corrected, using the previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/441

available alignment based on secondary structure information from Helm et al. [1] and two more extensive datasets based on secondary structure alignments [4,14]. Due
to extensive divergence between tetrapods we made no
attempt to align sequences in D- and T- loops.
Obvious errors in the sequence and the alignment were
changed manually. Among large-scale errors annotation
of the tRNA on the wrong strand was the most common
(71 cases out of 6060 tRNAs) followed by labeling of the
tRNA as transporting the wrong amino acid or complete
omissions (20 cases out of 6060 tRNAs). However, most
errors were more subtle, such as an omission or addition
of several nucleotides in the flanks of the gene (690 cases
out of 6060 tRNAs), that were corrected only through the
analysis of secondary structure information coupled with
the availability of a multiple alignment for the entire gene.
Since mt-tRNAs are not as conserved in sequence and
structure as nuclear tRNAs [1-3] a compilation of a multiple alignment alone is insufficient for an accurate secondary structure annotation. Thus, we have chosen to add a
secondary structure prediction using mfold [19] in addition to that produced by the multiple alignment. We predicted secondary structure using mfold web server and a
Perl script to automate the Web routines. We ran mfold
specifying pairing constraints for stem structures predicted from the earlier step of the multiple alignment. We
made no attempt to restrict pairing of sequence sections
predicted to be loops. If the above constraints (binding of
some nucleotide pairs) returned implausible tRNA structures or no structures at all, the alignment and secondary
structure were modified and mfold was ran again to test
the plausibility of the new structure. Finally we ranked
each type of tRNA molecules according to their free energies and checked by hand 25% of tRNAs with the highest
free energy. Since we have not constrained loop sizes during these iterations some loop sizes decreased and stem
sizes increased, leading to increased stability of tRNA molecules.
Empirically we observed the following constraints of
tRNA secondary structure folding as performed by mfold:
1) minimum loop size was never less than 3 nucleotides
and 2) WC and GU pairs were not formed if both of the
neighbor nucleotides did not participate in pairing. A few
mt-tRNA mfold secondary structures predictions that did
not conform to the expected cloverleaf were manually
rechecked and the alignment altered until the mfold prediction yielded a cloverleaf-like structure. In addition,
some mt-tRNAs, including the mt-tRNASerAGY in all species
[1] and several reptilian and nine banded armadillo mttRNAsCys [1-3] showed secondary structures that differed
from the expected cloverleaf structure due to the loss of

the D-stem structure, which is a structural evolutionary
change particularly common in mt-tRNAs [2].

Utility and Discussion
Most tetrapod mitochondrial genomes code for 22 different tRNAs with the exception of Metatherians that have
lost the mt-tRNALys [5]. In addition, some tetrapod mitochondrial genomes that were labeled as complete were
only partially finished, such that seven mammalian
genomes did not have sequences for tRNAPhe (Dromiciops
gliroides, Metachirus nudicaudatus, Macrotis lagotis, Notoryctes typhlops, Perameles gunnii, Pseudocheirus peregrinus
and Thylamys elegans) and five mammals did not have the
sequence for tRNAPro (Arctocephalus forsteri, Dromiciops gliroides, Macrotis lagotis, Perameles gunnii and Thylamys elegans). Thus, our database contains complete manually
curated sequence and secondary structure information for
6060 mitochondrially encoded tRNA molecules.
Our database is available in 22 text files, one for each
tRNA, with sequences of the 277 different species presented in the same order in each file. The order of the species in the alignment is the same for each mt-tRNA gene
and roughly recapitulates the tetrapod phylogeny. Each
file in the database includes the species common and scientific names, basic phylogenetic information and a multiple alignment of the tRNA with unaligned flanking
sequence and annotated secondary structure (Figure 1 and
2). The "|" characters in the alignment delineate the conserved secondary structure prediction that was made using
the alignment of all tRNA genes. The capital and lowercase letters in the files represent paired nucleotides according to the secondary structure prediction that was made
with mfold. The two methods of secondary structure prediction generally showed similar results but small differences were common. For example, according to the mfold
prediction many species in the tRNAAsn gene form 3 WC
pairs in the D-stem, while the classical tRNA structure supported by the alignment predicts 4 interacting nucleotides
in this stem (Figure 1b). The value of showing separate
predictions made by the alignment and the secondary
structure is more evident in complicated cases, such as the
case of the anticodon stem in the tRNAAsn of the common
iguana. In this case the alignment delineates the overall
area where the anticodon stem should be formed, while
mfold predicts which nucleotides form WC pairs in the
structure (Figure 1b). Our database has a simple tabdelimited format with a set number of species in exactly
the same order in each file making it especially useful for
those researchers that wish to use our database in batch by
parsing information on the secondary structure from our
files.
The first database of mammalian mt-tRNAs which we
used as a kernel in our alignment reports only mamma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/441

lian species, it does not report any secondary structure that
is independent of a multiple alignment and excludes complicated cases, such as the loss of D-stems [1]. Another,
more current database that includes nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs from the entire diversity of life forms has
been, unfortunately, derived automatically [20] and is
unlikely to be useful to researchers requiring a high level
of sequence and structure annotation fidelity. In addition,
both of these databases are difficult to use in batch mode,
as they do not represent their results in a parsing-friendly
format. Thus, our database is likely to be more useful for
researchers that require a low level of annotation error, a
phylogenetically diverse sample or prefer to work with
many tRNA genes in simple text files. However, our database is not tailored to the needs of researchers that require
a graphical interface for their work.
In the course of re-annotation and the compilation of a
secondary-structure based multiple alignment, we have
modified the annotation of the mt-tRNA gene location for
13% of all mt-tRNAs presented in our database. Such a
high error rate in the annotation of such seemingly simple
molecules as mt-tRNAs underscores the importance of
availability of manually annotated databases such as the
one reported here. In particular, we suggest for researchers
reporting novel mitochondrial genome sequences to
check their tRNA gene annotations against our database to
ensure a higher level of fidelity of their annotation. Manually curated databases have an inherent advantage of a
lower error rate than automatically created ones. However, a manual assembly of such an extensive database as
the one reported here is a resource-intensive enterprise,
and it is unlikely that the current database will be considerably expanded using the same manual approach. Rather
the aim for the further development of this resource is to
use the alignments reported here as a basis for further
automatic enlargement.

Conclusion
We report a secondary structure based multiple alignment
of 6060 mt-tRNAs from 277 tetrapod species. In the
course of our work, we have re-annotated a large fraction
of mt-tRNA genes, and manually checked all secondary
structure predictions. We expect that our database will
facilitate further research of mitochondrially encoded
tRNAs from a structural, evolutionary and medical perspectives. Currently, mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs
are thought to have a high level of similarity to the canonical tRNA secondary structure [1]. However, an analysis of
exceptions to the canonical tRNA structures among the
vertebrate mt-tRNAs, which is made possible with the
database reported here, has not been undertaken. The
evolutionary implications of compensations on a molecular level have been investigated previously [4], however,
the study of CPDs in mt-tRNAs has been performed only

on mammalian mt-tRNAs. Finally, prediction of pathogenic mutations in mt-tRNAs relies heavily on evolutionary conservation [13,14] and the availability of a
secondary structure-based alignment of an expanded set
of species may contribute to a more accurate prediction of
the phenotypic consequences of mt-tRNA mutations.
