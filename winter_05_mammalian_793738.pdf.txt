Abstract
Background: The identification of sequence innovations in the genomes of mammals facilitates
understanding of human gene function, as well as sheds light on the molecular mechanisms which
underlie these changes. Although gene duplication plays a major role in genome evolution, studies
regarding concerted evolution events among gene family members have been limited in scope and
restricted to protein-coding regions, where high sequence similarity is easily detectable.
Results: We describe a mammalian-specific expansion of more than 20 rapidly-evolving genes on
human chromosome Xq22.1. Many of these are highly divergent in their protein-coding regions yet
contain a conserved sequence motif in their 5' UTRs which appears to have been maintained by
multiple events of concerted evolution. These events have led to the generation of chimaeric genes,
each with a 5' UTR and a protein-coding region that possess independent evolutionary histories.
We suggest that concerted evolution has occurred via gene conversion independently in different
mammalian lineages, and these events have resulted in elevated G+C levels in the encompassing
genomic regions. These concerted evolution events occurred within and between genes from three
separate protein families ('brain-expressed X-linked' [BEX], WWbp5-like X-linked [WEX] and Gprotein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein [GASP]), which often are expressed in
mammalian brains and associated with receptor mediated signalling and apoptosis.
Conclusion: Despite high protein-coding divergence among mammalian-specific genes, we
identified a DNA motif common to these genes' 5' UTR exons. The motif has undergone concerted
evolution events independently of its neighbouring protein-coding regions, leading to formation of
evolutionary chimaeric genes. These findings have implications for the identification of non proteincoding regulatory elements and their lineage-specific evolution in mammals.

Background
Discriminating mutations arising during the evolution of
mammals which were selectively neutral from those
which were adaptive is an important challenge for the current genomic era. In the main, beneficial mutations in
mammalian genomes appear to have been gene duplica-

tion, rapid sequence divergence, and alteration in gene
expression levels [1-4].
An additional lineage-specific mutational process which
is also a substrate for selection is concerted evolution, via
either unequal crossing-over or gene conversion [5,6].

Non-allelic gene conversion occurs during non-reciprocal
homologous recombination when sequence-similar paralogues are misaligned. Converting sequences are often
short, in the order of hundreds of basepairs, and when frequent and sustained can lead to the homogenisation of
multigene family sequences [7], as observed for mammalian histone [8] and Hsp70 [9] genes. During gene conversion, repair at mismatched positions appears to be biased
towards retention of G or C bases which leads to elevation
in G+C nucleotide content [10].
Non-allelic gene conversion thus results in phylogenetic
trees which display significantly greater proximity
between a species' gene paralogues than for gene orthologues of a sister species [11]. Such phylogenetic relationships, however, are also indicative of lineage-specific gene
duplication events. Nevertheless, when the affected genes
are widely-spread on the genome these relationships are
usually indicative of non-allelic gene conversion. This is
because gene duplication most frequently results in tandem consecutive genes along the chromosome.
Gene conversion events are expected to occur mostly
between protein-coding sequences of genes. This expectation arises from sequence conservation being, in general,
highest in protein-coding regions, intermediate in
untranslated regions (UTRs), and lowest within introns
and intergenic regions [12]. Gene conversion thus is not
expected between sequence-dissimilar and non-homologous genes.
Here, we describe genes whose evolution defies these
expectations. We present evidence for gene conversion
events between mammalian-specific genes which encode
sequence-dissimilar and possibly non-homologous, proteins. These conversion events occurred not within their
protein-coding or 3' UTR sequences, but rather within
their 5' UTRs and upstream regions. We suggest that the
occurrence of concerted evolution events during mammalian evolution led to multiple chimaeric genes, with 5'
UTR and protein-coding sequences possessing different
evolutionary pedigrees.
These proposed events occurred within and between
genes from three separate families ('brain-expressed Xlinked' [BEX], WWbp5-like X-linked [WEX] and G-protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein [GASP]),
all of which contain single protein-coding exons. Bex1, -2
and -3 are 'brain-expressed X-linked genes' whose intracellular products bind protein [13]. BEX1 and BEX2 bind
the olfactory marker protein (OMP) [14,15] whereas
BEX3 binds the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)
[16], and the second mitochondria-derived activator of
caspase (Smac) [17,18], as well as self-associating [16].
WEX proteins include WWbp5 which is a poorly-under-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/54

stood WW domain binding protein [19]. GASP-1 and -2
are G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) associated sorting
proteins (GASPs) which bind to the COOH-termini of
various GPCRs and modulate their endocytic sorting to
lysosomes [20,21].
Genes from these three families are all tightly-clustered
within a mammal-specific ~2 Mb region of human chromosome Xq22.1-q22.2. We find that these genes all arose
during early eutherian evolution and have experienced
substantial sequence divergence thereafter. Their localisation to brain tissues, and their unusual and rapid evolution, are thus consistent with their involvement in the
evolution of innovative brain cortical structures among
eutherian mammals.

Results and discussion
A 2.3 Mb region of human Xq22.1-q22.2 is specific to
placental mammals
Our studies focused on a 2.3 Mb region of human and
mouse X chromosomes that encode a collinear arrangement of multiple genes from BEX, WEX and GASP families (Figure 1; Table 1). This entire region has a
counterpart in neither the chicken nor the metatherian
(marsupial) Monodelphis domestica. Orthologues of two
genes that flank the region, Gla (encoding α-galactosidase; NM_013463) and Glra4 (encoding glycine receptor
subunit α4; NM_010297), are separated by less than 4 Kb
on chicken chromosome 4, and 10 Kb on Monodelphis
scaffold 13561 (which is expected to lie within the long
arm of its X chromosome [22]). These two non-eutherians' intergenic regions are both devoid of sequences
homologous to BEX, WEX and GASP genes, and of assembly gaps greater than 100 b.

Human Xq22.1-q22.2 thus appears to be an innovation of
eutherian (placental) mammals. This is surprising since
chromosome Xq initially arose after the divergence of the
lineages leading to modern birds and mammals, but prior
to the metatherian-eutherian split [23]. The observation
however, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate
issues underlying sequence innovation and functional
innovation. We were interested in three interrelated questions: (i) Which evolutionary processes led to the origin of
these genes? (ii) Are these genes' functions similar, and are
they related to physiological or anatomical innovations in
placental mammals? and, (iii) Why are these newlyacquired genes restricted to this one chromosomal region,
rather than being dispersed throughout the remainder of
the X chromosome or elsewhere?
BEX and WEX proteins are diverged homologues
We investigated the evolutionary origins of BEX, WEX and
GASP genes using database searches of known protein and
nucleotide sequences. We concluded that mammalian X-

linked GASP genes are members of an ancient family that
are discernible in early-branching bony vertebrates such
as teleost fish (FLJ20811; NM_212853). By contrast, from
the results of BLAST and PSI-BLAST [24] searches, BEX or
WEX gene homologues appear to be absent outside of
eutherian mammals. The order of BEX, WEX and GASP
genes is conserved between human, rodent and canine X
chromosomes and thus must have been present in their
common ancestor.
Nevertheless, despite their sequence divergence we find
that BEX and WEX protein sequences are homologous.
Using COMPASS [25], significant similarity (SmithWaterman score 82; E = 4.4 × 10-8) between a multiple
sequence alignment of 25 sequences from the BEX protein
family, and an alignment of 18 WEX sequences was
observed. We thus predict that WEX and BEX proteins
arose from a single ancestral gene early in eutherian evolutionary history, but diverged as separate families thereafter by numerous events of gene duplication. This is also
consistent with BEX and WEX gene families possessing a
common gene structure, namely three exons, with the
most 3' of these always containing the entire protein-coding sequence.
5' UTR sequences of BEX, WEX and GASP genes are
homologous
Despite the lack of evidence for homology between BEX
or WEX, and GASP proteins, we were surprised to observe
highly-similar sequences within the 5' UTRs of BEX and
GASP genes. For example, a 383 b sequence (human
chrX:101090862–101091244) which overlaps and
extends the first non-coding exon of BEX2 is 91% identical to a region straddling the first exon of human GASP4.

Using MEME [26] we searched the first 5' UTR exons of
human, mouse and rat BEX, WEX and GASP gene
sequences for conserved DNA motifs. A highly significant
DNA motif (E-value = 5.8 × 10-390, width = 57 bases) was
identified by MEME in 37 of these 50 sequences. Using
BLASTn searches of genomic sequences, we extended the
width and breadth of these motifs, which we call BGW
(Bex/GASP/Wex) elements (Figure 2). The program MAST
[27] and the position-specific matrix of the MEME BGW
motif was then used to search the NCBI non-redundant
DNA database for significantly scoring DNA alignments.
This search yielded statistically significant hits (E < 10-7)
for 18 genomic sequences on human, mouse or rat chromosomes X, all of which represent the 5' UTRs of BEX,
WEX and GASP genes. No significant alignments were
observed to non-mammalian sequence or to mammalian
sequence present outside of the X chromosome.
These BGW motifs are not randomly positioned with
respect to coding sequences: 18 of the 23 human

homologues occur within the 5' UTRs of BEX or WEX or
GASP family genes (Table 1). Of the remaining 5, 2 are
homologous to other BGWs that are upstream of BEX or
WEX or GASP family genes, as assessed by whole genome
BLASTn searches (p < 0.01); 1 is 5' to a neighbouring gene
HNRPH2 (and is highly conserved in orthologous
sequences in dog, rat and mouse); and, 2, including 1 5'
of GASP10ψ, are not upstream of known coding transcripts, so might represent false positives, pseudogenic
copies or longer-range regulators. We conclude that the
BGW element is a conserved non-coding sequence motif
shared by BEX, WEX and GASP genes, which is restricted
to eutherian chromosome Xq21-22.
Concerted evolution events within and between the 5'
UTRs of BEX, WEX and GASP genes
Further investigation demonstrated that the evolutionary
histories of portions of BEX, WEX and GASP genes were
not identical to the relationships expected from the species' phylogenetic tree. The first exon of the 5' UTR of
BEX2, BEX3 and GASP4 genes encompasses the BGW
motif and exhibits greater sequence similarities between
paralogues than it does between orthologues (Figure 3A).
This finding is indicative of independent concerted evolution events [7,9,11,28,29]. Bootstrap values are sufficiently high to indicate with confidence that concerted
evolution events have occurred among these genes in all

+

+
+

+
+
+

mammalian lineages examined (human, mouse, rat and
dog).
Notably, some of these concerted evolution events are lineage-specific. Bootstrap values (Figure 3A) support such
events between human or dog BEX2 and GASP4, but not
between mouse or rat BEX2 and GASP4, and between
mouse, rat or dog BEX2 and BEX3, but not human BEX2
and BEX3.
Similarly, phylogenetic analysis of WEX2 and WEX8
genes indicates that concerted evolution events occurred
recently, between the first 5' UTR exons, in the carnivore
and primate lineages (Figure 3B). Finally, concerted evolution also occurred between the 5' UTRs of human or
mouse GASP1 and GASP2 (Figure 3C).
Some of these concerted evolution events appear to have
occurred relatively recently. In particular, concerted
evolution between the 5' UTRs of mouse Bex2 and Bex3
(or rat Bex2 and Bex3) genes must have occurred very
recently because they exhibit no substitutions of nucleotides within their BGW motifs (Figure 2).
Chimaerism among BEX, WEX and GASP genes
Concerted evolution events between BEX2, BEX3 and
GASP4 are restricted to the non-coding regions of their

among BEX2, BEX3 and GASP4, while concerted evolution events in protein coding regions are supported only
between BEX1 and BEX2. Among WEX proteins, a similar
analysis indicates that WEX2, WEX4 and WEX8 coding
sequences have experienced concerted evolution events
(data not shown).
A pseudogene of human GASP10 (GASP10ψ), which is
positioned upstream of GASP10 on chromosome X,
appears to be converting with GASP10 in primate
(human), rodent (mouse) and carnivore (dog) lineages.
Bootstrap analysis supports that GASP10 and GASP10ψ
are significantly more similar to each other than they are
to their orthologues from dog or mouse (bootstrap value
= 100%, data not shown). Therefore, although GASP10ψ
does not encode a functional protein, it may function as a
redundant copy for facilitating gene conversion events to
its neighbouring GASP10 gene, as has occurred elsewhere
in the human genome [31,32].

genes. The GASP4 protein exhibits no discernible
sequence similarity to either BEX2 or BEX3 proteins;
moreover, BEX2 and BEX3 amino acid sequences are relatively divergent (42% identity). Thus, these three genes
appear to be chimaeric: their 5' UTRs are highly similar
and exhibit a recent ancestry, whereas their protein coding
sequences are more distantly related.
This surprising conclusion is supported by a phylogenetic
tree of BEX protein coding sequences (Figure 4). With
high reliability the protein coding regions of human BEX1
and BEX2 paralogues were found to be more similar than
they are to their rodent (mouse and rat), ruminant (cattle)
or carnivore (dog) orthologues; similarly mouse BEX1
and BEX2 are most closely related, as are dog BEX1 and
BEX2 genes. By contrast, the predicted evolutionary relationships of the three other paralogues, BEX3, BEX4 and
BEX5, recapitulate the expected species tree [30].
These results thus demonstrate distinct and complex evolutionary histories for different regions of genes: concerted evolution events in the 5' UTRs are supported

These and similar inferences of concerted evolution (collated in Additional file 1) could have arisen due to unequal crossing-over, gene duplication or gene conversion.
Unequal crossing-over and multiple gene duplications are
unlikely mechanisms for concerted evolution of these
genes because their orders and transcriptional orientations along their X chromosomes have suffered no rearrangements, inversions (except for one, involving rat
WEX2) or large deletions when human, dog and mouse
genomes are compared (Table 1; Figure 1; data not
shown).

The findings also could have arisen from exon shuffling,
where exons are duplicated and inserted into different
gene contexts [33]. However, inter-allelic gene conversion
is distinguished from exon shuffling in that it often occurs
within regions possessing high G+C nucleotide compositions [8-10,34]. Indeed, from G+C fractions for BEX, WEX
and GASP 5' UTRs and for the third positions of their protein coding regions ("GC3"), we found that sequences
with evidence for concerted evolution possess significantly higher G+C fractions than sequences without such
evidence (paired T-test, p(5' UTR) < 10-3, p(GC3) = 10-3)
(Figure 5, Additional file 1). This indicates strongly that
multiple events of interlocus gene conversion, rather than
de novo sequence duplication or exon shuffling, have
occurred among these genes.
Evidence for sustained gene conversion events
Our findings indicate that the vertical transmission of
BEX, WEX and GASP genes has been interrupted frequently by horizontal acquisitions of non-coding, as well
as coding, sequences from genes that are closely-linked on
human chromosome Xq22.1-q22.2. These genes'

homologous genomic regions. Maximum likelihood tree topologies and branch lengths were obtained using the program
BASEML [54], for a given DNA sequence alignment. Each alignment was bootstrapped a 1000 times using the neighbour-joining
method, and bootstrap values were overlaid the maximum likelihood tree. Abbreviations: Hs, Homo sapiens; Mm, Mus musculus;

sequences appear to have been homogenized by multiple
episodes of interlocus gene conversion. Because gene conversion is thought to proceed via formation of heteroduplexes between highly-similar sequences [35], this raises
an interesting conundrum: how has recent gene
conversion occurred between sequence-dissimilar genes
drawn from different gene families?
We resolve this question by proposing that BEX and WEX
proteins all arose from a common ancestral GASP-like

gene and rapidly diverged in sequence thereafter (Figure
6). We further propose that sequence similarity has been
preserved between these homologues' 5' UTRs by recurrent episodes of gene conversion, despite rapid divergence
of sequences elsewhere in their genes.
This scenario is supported by three observations: that BEX
and WEX genes are homologous, that all three families
utilize only a single exon to code for protein, and that
BEX, WEX and GASP protein-coding sequences evolved

rapidly. For the latter observation, we note that KA/KS values of these genes are high (median of 0.34) relative to a
median value of 0.10 for all Ensembl human-mouse single orthologues (data not shown). These genes might then
have arisen initially from duplication of GASP10, a gene
that contains the BGW element and whose orthologues
are known in earlier-diverging vertebrates, including fish
(hypothetical protein FLJ20811; NM_212853). Unlike
other GASP genes, GASP10 contains a three exon structure, similarly to these observed in BEX and WEX genes.

Selection of gene conversion events
To our knowledge there is only a single documented
occurrence of gene conversion between paralogues' 3'
UTRs [36], and a single observation of gene conversion
between paralogues' 5' UTRs [37]. However, multiple conversion events that differentiate between coding and noncoding sequences, as well as sequence conversion between
genes that otherwise are not demonstrably homologous,
are completely unexpected.

G/C levels are elevated in human genes that undergo concerted evolution events. 5' UTR G+C and protein-coding
GC3 properties of human BEX, WEX and GASP genes are indicated. (+) or (-) symbols represent presence or absence of a concerted evolution event in 5' UTR (first/left symbol) or in protein-coding (second/right symbol) regions.

We attribute this singular evolutionary scenario to placental mammal-specific functional innovation. BEX and
WEX genes appear, from the absence of homologues
among other vertebrates, to have arisen during mammalian evolution by rapid sequence divergence from a common ancestor. In other analogous situations, such as the
evolution of the caseins and histatins from a single ancestral gene [38], rapid gene duplication and sequence diversification is causally linked to innovation in physiology
and behaviour [2]. In this case, gene function is associated
with binding to brain-specific receptors, as seen for BEX
and GASP proteins [15,20,21].
On the basis of frameshifts, stop codons, the lack of an
initiating methionine codon or introns, all BEX and WEX
paralogues outside of the Xq22.1-q22.2 region appear to
be retrotransposed processed pseudogenes. This suggests
that there is selection for retention of these genes as a
closely-linked group on the X chromosome, and perhaps
points either to gene conversion being a necessary requirement for long-term sustenance and evolution of their

functions, or an X-linked factor that is necessary for their
proper gene functions.
Function prediction
The X chromosome contains a disproportionate number
of genes related to mental functions which has been
linked to the male preponderance of mental retardation
cases [39,40]. However, of 9 X-linked genes that, when
mutated, lead to mental impairment all possess orthologues in fish or even earlier-branching eukaryotes [40].
When expression information is available, all BEX, WEX
and GASP genes are found to be expressed in the brain
(Table 1). These eutherian-specific genes are thus possible
candidates for the adaptive evolution of the neocortex, a
region of the forebrain which is unique to mammals [41].

The presence of a conserved BGW element within the 5'
UTRs of BEX, WEX and GASP genes is suggestive of its participation in regulation of translation. This is because
translation rates have been shown previously to be
affected by regulatory sequences, which include the start

Proposed evolutionary events leading to BEX, WEX and GASP genes on human chromosome Xq22.1-q22.2
Proposed evolutionary events leading to BEX, WEX and GASP genes on human chromosome Xq22.1-q22.2. BEX
and WEX genes arise due to duplication of a GASP-like gene early in eutherian mammalian history. These genes undergo multiple duplication events thereafter, but prior to the divergence of human and dog lineages. Multiple events of gene conversion,
either between 5' UTRs or between coding sequences (Additional file 1), occur with the remaining coding sequence diverging
rapidly due to relaxed selective constraints and/or adaptive evolution.

site consensus sequence, secondary structures, upstream
AUGs, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and sequence
specific recognition site for regulatory factors, such as
protein or RNA [42,43]. Translational control of BEX,
WEX and GASP genes might indicate that their proteins
are utilized under specific physiological conditions [44],
at developmental stages [45] or in subcellular compartments [46,47]. Another possible role for the BGW element might be to regulate alternative splicing. Although
these genes possess only single protein coding exons there
are several examples of transcripts that exhibit alternative
splicing within their 5' UTR exons (e.g. WEX2 (mRNA

BQ068054)) and others that exclude the protein-coding
exon altogether (e.g. GASP5 (mRNA BC022066)).

Conclusion
We have described the evolutionary history of a large
region of human chromosome X, which appears to be an
innovation of placental mammals. This region
encompasses three previously unrelated protein-coding
gene families, BEX, WEX and GASP, which have been the
product of multiple gene duplications and large proteincoding sequence diversification since the earliest eutherian mammal. Despite the lack of protein-coding

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:54

sequence similarity between many genes, we were able to
identify a mammalian conserved DNA motif in their
exonic 5'UTR, suggesting that they are derived of a common single ancestor, probably a GASP-like gene, found in
early-branching bony vertebrates.
We have shown that the evolution of these paralogous
genes has been affected by multiple events of gene conversion acting to homogenize among 5'UTR sequences, protein-coding sequences or both. Events of gene conversion
in these regions have led to the occurrence of chimaeric
genes, where their 5' UTRs are highly similar and exhibit a
recent ancestry, but their protein coding sequences are
more distantly related. We showed that the composition
of sequences undergoing concerted evolution is enriched
with G and C nucleotides, suggesting that biased gene
conversion has been the underlying mechanism rather
than exon shuffling.
BEX, WEX and GASP genes are found to be expressed in
the brain (Table 1), suggesting that these eutherian-specific genes are possible candidates for the adaptive evolution of the neocortex, a region of the forebrain which is
unique to mammal. The presence of a conserved BGW element within the 5' UTRs of BEX, WEX and GASP genes is
suggestive of its participation in regulation of translation,
possibly resulting in different spatio-temporal localization of these genes products or in different alternative
splicing forms. These findings thus hint at hitherto unappreciated modes of 5' UTR evolution. The identification of
such 5' UTRs elsewhere in the genome thus will be
required as a contribution to the delineation of all human
sequence under selection.

Methods
Genome assemblies and gene models
The July 2003 human (based on NCBI Build 34), the
October 2003 mm4 Mus musculus genome assembly
(based on NCBI Build 32), the rn3 June 2003 Rattus norvegicus genome assembly (based on version 3.1), the
canFam1 July 2004 Canis familiaris whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly v1.0, the 13 Nov. 2003 chimpanzee
(Pan troglodytes) Arachne assembly – NCBI Build 1 Version 1, and the February 2004 chicken (Gallus gallus) draft
assembly were analysed. Gene annotations were extracted
from the UCSC genome browser [48], or were predicted
using Genewise [49] and available transcriptional
information.
BGW element
The ENSEMBL web browser blast application [50] and the
BlastN program [24] (without optimization for identical
hits) were used to perform a sequence similarity search
between a region 5' to Alex2 (chrX:99686693–99686992)
and the entire human genome assembly. Multiply aligned

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/54

genomic hits that were predicted (p < 0.01) to be homologous to this region were positioned on human X chromosome, only within an area containing BEX, WEX, and
GASP family members. A similar search was done in
mouse, rat, zebrafish and chicken genomes. Human,
mouse and rat sequences were thereafter multiply aligned,
and used to further search the human genomic area
(chrX:99850000–100250000) using an HMM [51]. Additional similar sequences (E < 0.1) were added to generate
the final multiple alignment (Figure 2).
Tree construction and bootstrap analysis
Protein-coding and exonic 5' UTR phylogenetic trees were
both constructed from DNA sequence alignments.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [52] or MULAN
[53], and alignments were subjected to a neighbour-joining bootstrapping process (n = 1000). Non protein-coding branch length estimations were calculated using a
maximum likelihood approach (BASEML [54]) as implemented by the molecular evolution package DAMBE [55].
In order to assign bootstrap values for the branch lengths,
neighbour-joining bootstrap values were superimposed
on the ML tree.
G+C and GC3 content analysis
G+C proportions contained within the exonic-5' UTR or
the entire 5' UTR were based on genomic sequences. GC3
content was calculated from examining the GC fraction of
the third nucleotide codon positions of protein-coding
sequences.
Exonic 5' UTR sequence comparisons
The longest 5'-UTR sequence of each gene was chosen
using all available mRNA and EST transcript information
(Table 1). In all cases, sequences were further extended by
300 bases, using genomic data, to account for foreshortened transcript evidence. UTR sequences were then
aligned using BLASTN and considered to be homologous
when p < 0.001.
KA/KS analysis
Ratios of KA (the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site) to KS (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) were
calculated using the yn00 method of Yang and Nielsen
[56].

Authors' contributions
EEW identified the shared homology between the 5'UTR
of BEX and GASP genes and generated much of the analysis. CPP identified the BGW motif, and assisted in data
interpretation. EEW and CPP both contributed to the
drafting of the manuscript.
